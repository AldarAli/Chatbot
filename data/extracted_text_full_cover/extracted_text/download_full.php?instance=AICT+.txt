AICT 2022
Forward
The Eighteenth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications (AICT 2022), held
between June 26th and June 30th, 2022, continued a series of events covering a variety of challenging
telecommunication topics ranging from background fields like signals, traffic, coding, communication
basics, to large communication systems and networks, fixed, mobile and integrated, etc. Applications,
services, systems, and network management issues also received significant attention.
The spectrum of 21st Century telecommunications is marked by the arrival of new business
models, new platforms, new architectures, and new customer profiles. Next generation networks, IP
multimedia systems, IPTV, and converging network and services are new telecommunications
paradigms. Technology achievements in terms of co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6, multiple access
technologies, IP-MPLS network design driven methods, multicast and high speed require innovative
approaches to design and develop large scale telecommunications networks.
Mobile and wireless communications add profit to large spectrum of technologies and services. We
witness the evolution 2G, 2.5G, 3G and beyond, personal communications, cellular and ad hoc networks,
as well as multimedia communications.
Web Services add a new dimension to telecommunications, where aspects of speed, security, trust,
performance, resilience, and robustness are particularly salient. This requires new service delivery
platforms, intelligent network theory, new telecommunications software tools, new communications
protocols and standards.
We are witnessing many technological paradigm shifts imposed by the complexity induced by
the notions of fully shared resources, cooperative work, and resource availability. P2P, GRID, Clusters,
Web Services, Delay Tolerant Networks, Service/Resource identification and localization illustrate
aspects where some components and/or services expose features that are neither stable nor fully
guaranteed. Examples of technologies exposing similar behavior are WiFi, WiMax, WideBand, UWB,
ZigBee, MBWA and others.
Management aspects related to autonomic and adaptive management includes the entire
arsenal of self-ilities. Autonomic Computing, On-Demand Networks and Utility Computing together with
Adaptive Management and Self-Management Applications collocating with classical networks
management represent other categories of behavior dealing with the paradigm of partial and
intermittent resources.
We take here the opportunity to warmly thank all the members of the AICT 2022 technical program
committee, as well as all the reviewers. The creation of such a high-quality conference program would
not have been possible without their involvement. We also kindly thank all the authors who dedicated
much of their time and effort to contribute to AICT 2022. We truly believe that, thanks to all these
efforts, the final conference program consisted of top-quality contributions. We also thank the members
of the AICT 2022 organizing committee for their help in handling the logistics of this event.
We hope that AICT 2022 was a successful international forum for the exchange of ideas and
results between academia and industry and for the promotion of progress in the field of
telecommunications.

environmental 
parameters, 
is 
performed.

 INTRODUCTION 
Sensor networks as a special subtype of wireless 
networks consist of a set of wirelessly connected sensor 
nodes. The connected sensor nodes form networks used for 
gathering and exchanging information, and for forwarding 
data via gateways to public or private servers [1]. Data is 
then collected on storage servers for easier access and data 
processing [2].  
Considering the fact that the sensor nodes can be 
equipped with different types of sensors, the field of 
application of wireless sensor networks is very wide. One of 
many possible areas of application of wireless sensor 
networks under Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm includes 
their 
application 
in 
agriculture 
and 
monitoring 
of 
environmental parameters [3-8]. In this case, the test 
environment consists of agricultural crops for which 
environmental and other parameters important for yield 
prediction are observed under different conditions. Wireless 
systems based on usage of sensor nodes make agricultural 
processes more intelligent, since they become more precise, 
data-oriented and highly automated [9]. 
The source of energy required for the operation of the 
sensor node is mainly a battery, which is sometimes 
connected to an additional system for its charging, for 
example with a solar collector. Replacing the battery is often 
impossible or impractical.  
Therefore, the power supply capacity of the battery of the 
sensor node is one of the most severely limited resources in 
the wireless sensor network. Moreover, for implementation 
of the wireless sensor network, it is important to take into 
account the optimization of energy consumption and to 
achieve maximum possible energy savings [10].  
Therefore, in this paper, an analysis of configurations of 
wireless sensor networks is carried out with regard to 
optimization of energy consumption. Optimization is 
analyzed in terms of selection of adequate topologies, node 
layouts, data collection and routing processes, as well as 
settings of network radio parameters. In Section II, selection 
of network technology used in further analysis is explained. 
In Section III, a comparative overview of energy 
consumption for different topologies of wireless sensor 
networks is presented. In Section IV, an analysis of adequate 
methods for data collection is performed. In Section V, 
additional analysis of configurations of radio parameters is 
conducted to select solutions that have appropriate range and 
energy efficiency. 
II. 
SELECTION OF NETWORK TECHNOLOGY 
Sensor nodes are characterized by small dimensions, low 
energy consumption, the ability to collect data via 
appropriate sensors, the ability to process data, and to 
support wireless communication within appropriate range. 
This concept enables the collection of data very close to the 
observed area, local aggregation of data and easy transfer of 
data to remote central locations intended for data collection 
and processing. Wireless sensor networks may contain a 
number of nodes located at relatively short distances from 
each other. Communication between nodes, as well as 
communication of nodes with the gateway can take place 
directly or through multiple nodes, within the so-called 
multi-hop 
topology, 
topology 
which 
extends 
the 
communication range [11]. 
Analyses of various aspects of wireless sensor networks 
implemented in rural environment are conducted hereafter to 
optimize operating parameters from the communications 
point of view. Optimization of wireless communication 
parameters is carried out with an aim of achieving fast and 
reliable communication with minimal energy consumption. 
Optimization is important for processes of directing the 
collected sensor data to a remote distant destination.

For use in agriculture and monitoring of environmental 
parameters, sensor networks are placed in remote locations, 
i.e., test fields. Therefore, it is necessary to use networking 
technologies that can achieve connectivity over long 
distances up to several tens of kilometers. For this reason, the 
application of short-range communication technologies (e.g., 
WiFi and ZigBee) is not suitable due to installation barriers 
of additional gateways, lack of suitable locations or 
inadequate electricity connectivity [12]. Although the 
deployment of communication via mobile networks meets 
the requirements on range and reliability, it is energy 
demanding and incurs additional costs in terms of a 
permanent subscriptions to the service provider. Hence, it is 
also not an optimal solution [13]. In addition to long range, 
the next important criterion in the selection of appropriate 
technologies is low energy consumption, so that the battery-
powered nodes achieve a sufficiently long autonomy and 
multi-year life expectancy. Therefore, technologies from the 
group of Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) 
technologies are suitable for application in precision 
agriculture scenarios [14]. LPWAN is the name for high-
range, low-power wireless technologies. The specifics of 
LPWAN technologies are low power consumption and long 
communication range for sending information over greater 
distances. These features make LPWAN technologies very 
practical for open area IoT implementations. There are many 
LPWAN technologies and new ones are constantly emerging 
and improving, but currently LoRa, Sigfox and Narrowband 
IoT (NB-IoT) are leaders in this field [15,16]. The advantage 
of application of these technologies in networking relates to 
the fact that the end devices working with these technologies 
are designed to consume energy efficiently and minimally 
[17]. Low power and narrow bandwidth allow very low 
power consumption when sending messages [18]. Due to the 
simplicity of LoRa deployment in the fields, this paper 
analyzes the application of LoRa in agriculture for 
monitoring environmental parameters and optimization of its 
energy consumption in related scenarios. Considering the 
range of communication, LoRa has sufficient range required 
for its application in rural areas [9]. 
III. 
SELECTION OF NETWORK TOPOLOGIES 
Through simulation procedures, networking scenarios 
using LoRa technology are analyzed. In these scenarios, 
sensor nodes communicate via a gateway with the rest of the 
network. The CupCarbon IoT simulator [19] is used for 
simulation and analysis of energy consumption during 
communication processes. For comparing topologies and 
selecting appropriate network topologies, a star topology is 
suitable for many and diverse IoT applications. However, in 
a number of scenarios, a more flexible network topology 
like decentralized multi-hop solution is needed [11]. 
Therefore, in order to compare the network topologies from 
the aspect of energy consumption, the star topology, i.e., 
one-hop topology, and topology in which linear structures 
are formed in clusters, i.e., multi-hop linear topologies, are 
selected, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The terminal devices 
in the access network are sensor nodes. 
Figure 1.  Star topology (one-hop). 
Figure 2.  Line topology within individual clusters (multi-hop). 
As presented in Figures 1 and 2, sensors measure data 
sent to the rest of the network via a gateway. Terminal 
devices, i.e. sensor nodes, rely on the gateway to transmit 
information from the access network to the network server. 
A. Star topology 
To start the analysis of energy consumption in different 
access network topologies, the star topology, topology in 
which each sensor node sends data directly to the gateway is 
chosen. The star topology is convenient for its ease of 
deployment.  
Figure 3 shows the access part of the network created in 
the CupCarbon IoT simulator which includes the sensor 
nodes, marked as s2 to s5, connected to the gateway. Figure 
3 also shows the radii of area coverage with signal for 
individual nodes, which depend on the area range each node 
needs to cover with its signal. Thus, for example, node s4 
needs a smaller signal coverage radius for covering the area 
up to the gateway, while node s2 needs a larger signal 
coverage radius so that the gateway can be reached, as 
presented in Figure 3. The ranges of area coverage with 
signal can be defined through an atpl parameter, which 
defines the percentage of signal coverage for each node in 
relation to the maximum possible coverage area, as defined 
in Table I for nodes s4 and s5. In the case when the specified 
parameter is not defined for the node, it is considered that the 
node covers the maximum possible area it can cover with its 
signal. As presented in Table I, the gateway waits for the 
data to be sent from the sensor nodes according to the 
randomly selected (randb) moment for data sending that has 
a certain time delay.

Figure 3.  Representation of communication between nodes in scenario 
with star topology.  
Figure 3 shows the star topology and communication 
among nodes in the access network. The illustration shows 
that the sensor nodes (s2, s3, s4 and s5) send data directly to 
the gateway. This is defined through a send parameter that 
defines which node sends data to which one. Thus, for 
example, the label send 1 1 in Table I defines that nodes s2, 
s3, s4 and s5 send one data packet to node 1, i.e., the 
gateway. The randb parameter is used to send data with a 
random delay variable x. In order to compare the topologies 
that can be used in communication between sensor nodes and 
the gateway, power consumption in the example of a star 
network topology is presented in Fig 4. According to the 
level of energy consumption shown in Figure 4, it can be 
seen that the sensor nodes closer to the gateway, i.e., s4 and 
s5, consume less energy than the more distant nodes, i.e., s2 
and s3. Further comparison of the results obtained should be 
possible when the results for different topologies are taken 
into account within a similar time period as indicated on the 
abscissa.

B. Multi-hop linear topology 
Next, the topologies in which linear structures are formed 
in individual clusters, i.e., multi-hop linear topologies, are 
analyzed. Unlike in mesh, in these topologies network data 
collision issues could be mitigated so they are selected for 
the analysis of reliable network data transmission. 
1) 
Line topology within clusters with CH nodes closest 
to the gateway 
In the combination of line network topologies presented 
in Figure 5, some sensor nodes within individual clusters can 
communicate with each other, e.g., s2 and s4, as well as s3 
and s5. The so-called Claster Head (CH) nodes, nodes s4 
and s5, communicate directly with the gateway. They rely on 
the gateway to transmit information to the network server, as 
shown in Figure 5. The other nodes, s2 and s3, forward data 
in the direction of CH nodes. Devices are synchronized and 
wake up at specific moments in time to receive data packets 
from their neighbors, which they can combine with their own 
data packets and send further along the line. This scenario is 
created considering the conclusion given for the star 
topology that the distance of the nodes affects the energy 
consumption. Therefore, for the CH node within each 
cluster, the node closest to the gateway within the cluster is 
selected and its choice is fixed throughout the simulation 
process of network data transmission.  
Figure 5 illustrates the determined signal coverage radii 
for individual nodes. They depend on the range each sensor 
node needs to have to cover the area with its signal. In this 
scenario, it is assumed that, in order to cover the area up to 
the gateway, node s4 needs the same signal coverage radius 
as node s2 in order to reach node s4. The reason is a 
comparison of the impact of different frequencies of data 
transmission of nodes on energy consumption. From Figure 
5 it can be seen that sensor nodes s2 and s3 send data to 
nodes s4 and s5. The nodes s4 and s5 then send their data, as 
well as data received from nodes s2 and s3, directly to the 
gateway. The two clusters with line communication within 
nodes are created, one with s2 and s4, and one with s3 and 
s5, in which the CH nodes are nodes s4 and s5. According to 
the configuration of the parameters of nodes, it can be seen 
that the specified ranges of signal coverage are also defined 
through the atpl parameter.

For each node, the percentage of coverage area in 
relation to the maximum possible coverage area of the node 
is defined as presented in Table II for nodes s2, s3, s4 and 
s5. From Table II, it can be seen that nodes s4 and s5 need 
the same signal coverage radius for covering area up to the 
gateway, as radius of node s2 to reach node s4, as well as 
radius of node s3 to reach node s5. According to the level of 
energy consumption shown in Figure 6, it is evident that 
node s2 sends data more often than node s3, so its energy 
consumption is higher. The CH nodes, i.e., nodes s4 and s5, 
although the closest to the gateway, consume more energy 
than the more distant nodes, i.e., nodes s2 and s3. The 
reason for this is the fact that CH nodes receive data from 
nodes s2 and s3, and send them to the gateway along with 
their own data. The gateway waits for the data sent from the 
CH nodes according to the randomly selected moment for 
sending with a certain time delay. In this scenario, the total 
energy consumption is higher than in the star topology. 
2) 
Line topology within clusters with CH nodes 
furthest from the gateway 
 To avoid fast energy depletion of CH nodes selected in a 
fixed manner, this scenario gives the analysis of energy 
consumption of randomly selecting CH nodes, and not fixed 
ones, as in the previous example. In the combination of line 
network topologies within individual clusters shown in 
Figure 7, sensor nodes can communicate with each other, 
e.g., s2 and s4, as well as s3 and s5. For CH nodes, the data 
transmission process relies on the gateway to transmit 
information to the network server. In this example, the CH 
nodes are selected at random.  
Figure 6.  Energy consumption of LoRa technology in scenario with line 
topology within clusters and with CH nodes closest to the gateway. 
Figure 7.  Representation of communication between nodes in scenario 
with line topology within clusters and with CH nodes furthest from the 
gateway. 
For the CH node within each cluster at one point, as well 
as the nearest, the nodes furthest from the gateway can be 
selected, i.e., nodes s2 and s3. In Figure 7, the signal 
coverage radii for individual nodes are shown, depending on 
the area ranges that the nodes need to cover with their signal. 
Thus, for example, node s4 needs a smaller signal coverage 
radius covering the area up to node s2, compared to the 
necessary radius of node s2 for reaching the gateway. The 
same is true for the radii of nodes s3 and s5.  
According to the level of energy consumption shown in 
Figure 8, it can be seen that the sensor CH nodes, i.e., nodes 
s2 and s3, furthest from the gateway, consume more energy 
than nodes s4 and s5. At one point, nodes s4 and s5 send 
their data to the CH nodes s2 and s3, which then send these 
data to the gateway in addition to their own data.  
For a comparison with the energy consumption in the 
example of a line topology within a cluster with CH nodes 
closest to the gateway, a much higher energy consumption of 
CH nodes can be noted in this scenario. Moreover, the 
comparison of the results from Figures 4, 6, and 8 shows that 
in a star topology, unlike multi-hop topologies, the optimal 
scaling strategy of LoRa radio parameters can be achieved to 
obtain the long range communication while enabling the 
lowest energy consumption.  
As defined in Table III for nodes s4 and s5, the specified 
ranges of signal coverage radii are also defined through the 
atpl parameter. There is also the case when the specified atpl 
parameter is not defined for the node. In this case, it is 
considered that the node covers the maximum possible area 
that it can with its signal. This is the case for nodes s2 and 
s3. This allows for random selection of CH nodes as each 
node, from s2 to s5, is able to cover the area to the gateway 
with its signal.  
The random choice of CH nodes was selected in this 
scenario to analyze the possibility of reducing the energy 
depletion of certain CH nodes selected in a fixed manner, as 
it was the case in the previous scenario with the fastest 
energy depletion of CH nodes selected in a fixed manner, 
i.e., the ones closest to the gateway. However, the total 
amount of energy consumed within the observed time period 
in this scenario is the highest.

From the comparison of the results in Figures 4, 6, and 8 
it can be concluded that the star network topology can be 
considered as the best option with regard to cumulative 
energy consumption. 
IV. 
SELECTION OF ADEQUATE VOLUME OF NETWORK 
TRAFFIC 
The following scenarios are created with the aim of 
analyzing the impact of the amount of transmitted network 
traffic within the network on the energy consumption in the 
network. These scenarios aim to reduce energy consumption 
with adequate traffic volume, and to improve the range. The 
energy consumption control is considered and the rate 
adaptation for one-hop scenarios presented in Figure 9 is 
analyzed. For this purpose, the network topology shown in 
Figure 9 was created, which consists of sensor nodes, 
marked s2 to s7, and a remote gateway. Star topology is used 
for communication between nodes.  
Figure 9.  Communication between nodes for one-hop scenarios. 
In previous examples, the star topology was defined as 
more appropriate in terms of total energy consumption 
compared to the line structure within clusters. The radii of 
area coverage with signal for individual nodes are shown in 
Figure 9, so the node closest to the gateway has the smallest 
radius, i.e., node s3, while the nodes furthest from the 
gateway, i.e., nodes s5 and s7, have the largest radii. 
A. Sending an equal amount of traffic from nodes equally 
distant from the gateway 
As shown in Table IV, in this scenario, the gateway waits 
for data to be sent from the sensor nodes s2 to s7 and then 
reads the sent data x and proceeds with data forwarding. 
The largest radius for data transmission is used by nodes 
s5 and s7, which can be seen according to the omitted 
parameter atpl in Table IV. This implies usage of the entire 
available coverage radii of the nodes s5 and s7. This 
parameter is specified for nodes s2, s3, s4 and s6. It can be 
seen that node s3 uses the smallest radius (50% of the total 
largest possible radius). Data is sent continuously (loop), but 
a delay is made between sending individual data. This 
scenario corresponds to predefined data transmission 
moments in which all nodes send data at the same time 
intervals. This is a common case in rural scenarios for 
sending data collected from the field.  
Figure 10 shows the energy consumption when applying 
LoRa technology in a star network topology with the same 
amount of data sent from nodes equally distant from the 
gateway. Therefore, the same amount of data is sent from 
nodes s2 and s4, and the same amount of data from nodes s5 
and s7, so there are overlaps on the graph in energy 
consumption for these nodes. The node closest to the 
gateway, node s3 consumes the least energy for sending, 
while the most energy is consumed by the farthest nodes, 
nodes s5 and s7, whose energy will be depleted the fastest.

Figure 11.  Energy consumption in a star topology with different amounts 
of data sent from nodes equally distant from the gateway. 
It can be concluded that node placement in star topology 
presents an important determinant of sensor node life time. 
However, although the nodes should be as close as possible 
to the gateway to reduce energy consumption, at the same 
time, adequate coverage of area with the signal must be 
achieved. With regard to the energy depletion of individual 
nodes, the star topology is more suitable for application in 
sensor networks than a cluster topology 
In cluster topology, the energy of CH nodes is depleted 
the fastest. CH nodes are difficult to replace, which causes 
the loss of functionality of the entire cluster, while in a star 
topology, the depletion of energy of an individual node does 
not cause such a loss in data delivery from the area which it 
covers with its signal. 
B. Sending different amounts of traffic from nodes equally 
distant from the gateway 
The parameters listed in Table V are similar to the data 
from the previous scenario, except that data from some 
nodes is sent more frequently. Despite the same distance of 
nodes s2 and s4 from gateway, more data is sent from node 
s2 to the gateway than from node s4. Moreover, from node 
s5 data is sent to the gateway more often than from node s7, 
although both nodes are equally distant from the gateway.  
Figure 11 shows the energy consumption when applying 
LoRa technology in a star network topology with different 
amounts of data sent from nodes equidistant from the 
gateway. Therefore, different amount of data is sent from 
nodes s2 and s4, and different amount of data from nodes s5 
and s7, so there are no overlaps on the graph in energy 
consumption for these nodes. The node closest to the 
gateway, node s3 consumes the least energy required for 
sending. The most energy is consumed by the farthest node 
s5. Moreover, it sends more data compared to node s7, which 
is at the same distance from the gateway as node s5.

Figure 12.  Energy consumption of LoRa technology in a star topology with 
the less frequent sending of data from sensor nodes to the gateway. 
The node s5 consumes more energy than node s7. From 
the results, it can be concluded that in scenarios where 
sending a larger amount of data is not necessary, as in the 
case of monitoring the state of yield, energy savings should 
be achieved by sending an adequately determined smaller 
volume of data from sensors. 
C. Less frequent data transmission 
The parameters listed in Table VI are similar to the data 
from the previous scenario, except that data from nodes is 
sent less frequently, which is seen by a higher value of the 
delay parameter that defines the time delay between sending 
individual data. In this scenario, data is sent twice as rarely 
compared to the previous scenario. 
Figure 12 shows the energy consumption using LoRa 
network access and star network topology. In this scenario, 
less frequent sending of data from sensor nodes to gateway 
is analyzed and compared with the scenario presented in 
Figure 11. From the comparison of the presented results, 
significantly less energy consumption can be noted within 
the same time interval when sending data with higher delay, 
i.e., less frequently. LoRa technology has adequate features 
for usage in wireless sensor networks if long-range 
communication with minimal power consumption should be 
achieved. LoRa supports data transmission with lower 
requirements for high transfer speeds and transfer of large 
amounts of data. Thus, as can be concluded from the 
presented results, the application of LoRa technology is an 
adequate solution in IoT scenarios where fast transmission 
of large amounts of data is not required, as in precision 
agriculture, where additional energy savings can be 
achieved by sending smaller amounts of data over longer 
periods of time between transmissions.

D. Effect of SF and CR parameters on Consumed Energy 
The LoRa access based wireless sensor network 
implemented in the field serves to connect sensor nodes 
located in different remote locations to centrally located 
storage and advanced data processing servers. The 
communication should be achieved in an energy efficient 
way. It can be highlighted that the range of communication 
in the fields and open spaces presents one of the most 
important parameters because it is necessary to ensure the 
energy efficient transmission of data over relatively long 
distances. In that case, the high data transfer rate is not so 
significant. The parameters 
described 
hereafter, the 
spreading factor and the coding rate, affect transmission 
range and energy efficiency. 
The Spreading Factor (SF) presents the number of chips 
per symbol. Its value is an integer number between 6 and 12. 
The greater the SF value, the more capability the receiver has 
to move away the noise from the signal. Thus, the greater the 
SF value, the more time is taken to send a packet, but a 
higher range will also be achieved because the sensitivity of 
the receiver is better. Thus, for example, if the expansion 
factor is minimal, i.e., SF = 6, a higher speed can be 
achieved, but with a reduction in the possible range.  
The expression for Coding Rate (CR) is CR =4/(4+n), 
where n is a value from 1 to 4. It denotes that each four 
useful bits are encoded by 5, 6, 7 or 8 transmission bits. The 
smaller the coding rate is, the higher the time on air is to 
transmit data. Prolonged data transfer time will also affect 
battery consumption. 
The analysis of the effect of different values of SF and 
CR LoRa radio parameters on consumed energy and range is 
performed hereafter.

Figure 13.  Energy consumption of LoRa technology in a star topology with 
SF=7, and CR=4/8. 
 As already stated, when the SF value is high, the time 
for data transmission increases which means that the sensor 
node consumes more power to transmit data. As presented in 
Figure 14, the SF expansion factor is set to a maximum value 
of 12, unlike in the case shown in Figure 13 where the SF is 
set to a value of 7. The reason for setting a high SF value is 
to maximize the transmission range as one of the most 
important factors in the field deployments.  
Furthermore, when the coding rate increases, the data 
transmission time and the consumed energy decrease. 
Therefore, in the case when a long range needs to be 
ensured, energy consumption can be regulated by the CR 
factor, as presented in Figures 13 and 14. The energy 
consumption shown in Figure 14 would have been higher if 
the same CR factor had been used as in the example shown 
in Figure 13. By increasing the CR value from 4/8 to 4/5, 
energy consumption can be reduced while maintaining the 
maximal range enabled by the high SF parameter value. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
LoRa technology can be applied in agriculture to 
monitor 
environmental 
parameters. 
It 
is 
used 
for 
communication among remote sensor nodes located in test 
fields in order to achieve energy efficient communication. 
The LoRa system aims at pushing optimization of energy 
consumption further while maintaining a long range, hence 
the scenarios for implementation of LoRa solutions in 
precision agriculture have been analyzed in this paper. LoRa 
sensor 
network 
implementation 
for 
monitoring 
of 
environmental parameters in agriculture is analyzed.  
The specifics of LoRa technology are low power 
consumption and long communication range used in 
sending information over large distances.

The biggest drawback is the low speed of data 
transmission and the limited amount of data that can be sent. 
For LoRa based environmental monitoring, high throughput 
and high transfer rate are not of great importance since, 
generally, small amounts of data is transmitted. Basically, 
mainly numerical values representing readings of different 
types of sensors that monitor plant parameters and their 
close environment are sent. Therefore, it is important to 
achieve long-range communication with minimal energy 
consumption, with lower requirements for the amount and 
frequency of data transfer.  
In this paper, LoRa star, i.e., one-hop, and multi-hop 
linear topologies have been compared. Considering 
cumulative energy consumption of sensor nodes in the 
network, the star topology is identified as the one which 
could better fit lower energy consumption in the presented 
scenarios. Moreover, the presented simulation results show 
that, for a star topology, optimal scaling strategy of LoRa 
radio parameters necessary for environmental monitoring 
can be achieved to obtain the long range while enabling low 
energy consumption. The presented results show that 
optimizing LoRa parameters, such as SF and CR, with 
regard to the required long range communication is a key 
element to reduce the consumed energy by the sensor nodes. 
Since the SF factor must have the highest possible value to 
achieve a greater range of communication necessary for 
precision agriculture, the presented results show that in that 
case the CR should be as high as possible to reduce total 
energy consumption. The presented findings of the effect of 
the studied network elements on the energy consumption 
collected through conducted simulations are important for 
further research activities in the field of LoRa based 
environmental monitoring and precision agriculture in rural 
areas.  
For a multi-hop linear topologies, energy consumption 
can also be optimized by applying different radio 
configurations for different network layouts. In these 
topologies, the density of nodes plays a determinant role in 
coverage and number of hops. Therefore, future work will 
include analysis of optimization of energy consumption in 
multi-hop 
networks 
by 
exploiting 
various 
radio 
configurations and the network topologies (e.g., the number 
of hops, the network density, the coverage), and a strategy 
to take advantage of combination of both star and multi-hop 
topologies will be proposed.

Abstract—Two classes of codes allowing high-throughput 
decoding: Spatially Coupled Low Density Parity-Check (SC-
LDPC) codes and staircase codes are compared. Accumulate 
Repeat-Jagged (ARJ)-based SC-LDPC codes provide better 
performance and lower complexity for Soft-Decision Decoding 
(SDD). However, the serious drawback of this construction is 
the severe performance degradation with code rate increase. 
The decoding complexity of SDD might still be too high to 
provide very high throughput. Reed-Solomon (RS)-based 
staircase codes under Hard-Decision Decoding (HDD) provide 
quite good performance with low decoding complexity. 
Moreover, the performance changes very smoothly with code 
rate increase.  
Keywords-SC-LDPC codes; Generalized Product Codes; 
staircase codes; high-throughput decoding. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Future Beyond-5G use cases are expected to require 
wireless speeds in the Terabit/s range. This sets a number of 
tough challenges on the physical layer and especially on the 
Forward Error Correction (FEC). The code constructions used 
in current 3GPP specs can hardly be used to provide this level 
of throughput under channel conditions considered in use 
cases. Apparently, some specific requirements should be 
applied to the choice of a code construction allowing high 
throughput decoding. The decoding complexity should be low 
enough and the decoding algorithm should be suitable for a 
high level of parallelization. Especially useful for high 
throughput decoding are codes with high locality property 
allowing the decoder to use structures that are independent of 
code length in terms of complexity, storage requirements and 
latency. 
Spatially coupled codes are known for both high locality 
and high performance. In this paper, we are comparing two 
code constructions, one of which represents the class of SC-
LDPC codes and another the Generalized Product Codes 
(GPC). The comparison is done not only in terms of 
performance/complexity, but also the ability to create the code 
family that can be easily adapted to different code rates is 
considered.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the code constructions considered in this paper. 
Section III describes the decoding of the considered codes. 
Section IV addresses the comparison of the considered code 
constructions with the focus on ability to provide high 
throughput. The conclusions close the article. 
 
II. 
CONSIDERED CODE CONSTRUCTIONS 
The main principle of spatial coupling is that the 
codewords 𝐯𝑡 of the block code defined by the parity-check 
matrix 𝐇 , instead of being encoded independently, are 
interconnected (coupled) with their neighbors at times 𝑡 −
1, 𝑡 − 2, … , 𝑡 − 𝑤  during the encoding procedure. This is 
done in such a way that the sequence satisfies the condition 
 
𝐯𝑡𝐇0
𝑇(𝑡) + 𝐯𝑡−1𝐇1
𝑇(𝑡) + ⋯ + 𝐯𝑡−𝑤𝐇𝑤
𝑇 (𝑡) = 𝟎, 
() 
where matrices 𝐇0(𝑡), 𝐇1(𝑡), … , 𝐇𝑤(𝑡) result from the 
decomposition of the original matrix 𝐇 [6]:  
 
𝐇0(𝑡) + 𝐇1(𝑡) + ⋯ + 𝐇𝑤(𝑡) = 𝐇,   ∀𝑡. 
() 
It is easy to verify that both code constructions considered 
in this paper satisfy (1) and (2), therefore, they define spatially 
coupled codes.  
A. SC-LDPC codes  
The idea of SC-LDPC codes was proposed in [1]. It can be 
interpreted as generalization of block and convolutional 
coding where the convolutional coding is applied to the words 
of some block code rather than to information symbols. One 
of the possible ways of constructing SC-LDPC codes is 
constructing with the help of coupling of protographs. Recall 
that a protograph can be considered as a graph representing 
the general structure of a graph-based code, e.g., LDPC code. 
A protograph can be represented with the help of a Base-
Graph (BG) matrix 𝐁  where the element 𝑏𝑖,𝑗 shows the 
number of edges connecting Check Node (CN) 𝑖 and Variable 
Node (VN) 𝑗 in the protograph. The base-graph matrix 𝐁 can 
be translated to the parity-check matrix 𝐇 by substituting each 
element in 𝐁 by the corresponding permutation matrix of size 
(𝑀 × 𝑀), where 𝑀 is the code lifting size. If the number of 
edges connecting CN 𝑖 and VN 𝑗 is more than 1 and ,e.g., is 
9

equal to 𝑘, the corresponding matrix of size (𝑀 × 𝑀) should 
be obtained as a sum of 𝑘 permutation matrices. For example, 
consider the protograph shown in Figure 1.

Notice that, without lifting, the protograph shown in 
Figure 1 with BG matrix (3) cannot represent any code and 
matrix (4) is not a unique representation of BG (3). It is 
possible to construct the SC-LDPC code by splitting the 
original BG into a set of BG matrices 𝐁𝑖 in such a way that  
 
𝐁 = ∑
𝐁𝑖
𝑤
𝑖=0
. 
() 
where 𝑤 is the SC memory. 
Then, the BG of the SC-LDPC code can be written in the 
form of  
 
𝐁𝐿 =

where  𝐿 is the number of transmitted consecutive blocks 
(initial protographs), i.e., defining the block code of length 
𝑀𝐿𝑏𝑣 with the number of CNs 𝑀(𝐿 + 𝑤)𝑏𝑐, where 𝑏𝑣 is the 
number of BG VNs and 𝑏𝑐 is the number of BG CNs. The rate 
of the corresponding code is 
 
𝑅𝐿 =
𝐿𝑏𝑣−(𝐿+𝑤)𝑏𝑐
(𝐿+𝑤)𝑏𝑐
. 
() 
As can be seen from the structure of the BG matrix (6), the 
CN degrees at both ends of the code are lower. It should be 
noted that CNs with lower degrees (at the ends) improve the 
BP decoding. This irregularity caused by the fact that 𝑤 top 
and 𝑤 bottom blocks of CNs in (6) are of lower degrees is one 
of the main reasons for the excellent performance of SC-
LDPC codes [4]: the small-degree CNs serve as starting points 
for the convergence of the iterative decoding process such that 
a “wave” of reliable information propagates towards the 
middle of the codewords. 
A BP decoding analysis of SC-LDPC codes shows that the 
performance of the iterative decoder is improved significantly 
by spatial coupling. In fact, the results in [4] and [5] show that 
asymptotically, as 𝐿 → ∞, the BP threshold is boosted to that 
of the optimal Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) decoder. Since 
the MAP thresholds of regular LDPC ensembles with 
increasing node degrees are known to converge to capacity, it 
follows that spatial coupling provides a new way of provably 
achieving capacity with low-complexity iterative BP 
decoding [6]. 
 The Quasi-Cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) codes are of special 
interest due to the fact that they have efficient encoder and 
decoder implementations. If each (𝑀 × 𝑀)  permutation 
matrix substituting non-zero elements in BG is a circulant, the 
corresponding matrix 𝐇 defines a QC-LDPC code. In [2]-[3], 
the QC-LDPC codes were thoroughly studied and the 
effective code construction with ensemble minimum distance 
growing linearly with block size was proposed. This code 
family is called ARJ construction. An example of a BG 
representing ARJ construction is shown in Figure 1 [3].  
The ARJ-based SC-LDPC code with memory 𝑤 = 2 was 
chosen for the comparison in this paper. As it was mentioned 
above the Belief Propagation (BP) decoding threshold 
approaches capacity for all SC-LDPC codes with 𝐿 → ∞. 
Except this the ARJ-based SC-LDPC codes show better than 
regular code based SC-LDPC codes minimum distance 
growth rate [8]. That means minimum distance increases 
linearly with block length 𝑛 and for ARJ-based SC-LDPC this 
increase is more than for SC-LDPC codes based on regular 
codes. 
After simple optimization, the following partitioning of 
the BG (3) was chosen

In case lifting sub-matrices are chosen to be a circulant 
(leading to QC code), the optimization of the lifting

permutation sub-matrices is reduced to the choice of the 
circulant powers. The corresponding lifting powers were 
optimized for lifting size 𝑀 = 8.  
B. Staircase codes  
Staircase codes and braided block codes comprise the two 
most known representatives of the GPC [17]. Moreover, both 
constructions provide quite similar performance. For this 
reason, it was decided to limit the scope of the GPC study to 
staircase codes only.  
Staircase codes introduced in [15] can also be considered 
as an example of spatially coupling principle. The staircase 
code 
construction 
combines 
ideas 
from 
recursive 
convolutional coding and block coding. Staircase codes are 
completely characterized by the relationship between 
successive matrices of symbols. Specifically, consider the 
(infinite) sequence 𝐵0, 𝐵1, 𝐵2, … of (𝑚 × 𝑚) matrices 𝐵𝑖. For 
simplicity, consider each matrix 𝐵𝑖 as a binary matrix (it can 
be generalized to non-binary case as well). 
Block 𝐵0 is initialized to a reference state known to the 
encoder–decoder pair, e.g., an (𝑚 × 𝑚)  matrix of zero 
symbols. Furthermore, select a conventional linear block code 
(e.g., Hamming, Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH), RS, 
etc.) in systematic form to serve as the component code; this 
code 𝐶, is selected to have block length 2𝑚 symbols, of which 
𝑟 are parity symbols. Encoding proceeds recursively on the 
𝐵𝑖 . For each 𝑖 , 𝑚(𝑚 − 𝑟) information symbols (from the 
streaming source) are arranged into the (𝑚 − 𝑟)  leftmost 
columns of 𝐵𝑖; we denote this submatrix by 𝐵𝑖,𝐿. Then, the 
entries of the rightmost 𝑟 columns (this submatrix is denoted 
by 𝐵𝑖,𝑅) are specified as follows. 
1) Form the (𝑚 × (2𝑚 − 𝑟)) matrix 𝐴 = [𝐵𝑖−1
𝑇  𝐵𝑖,𝐿]. 
2) The entries of 𝐵𝑖,𝑅 are then computed such that each 
of the rows of the matrix [𝐵𝑖−1
𝑇  𝐵𝑖,𝐿 𝐵𝑖,𝑅] is a valid codeword 
of 𝐶. That is, the elements in the 𝑗th row of 𝐵𝑖,𝑅 are exactly 
the 𝑟 parity symbols that result from encoding the 2𝑚 − 𝑟 
“information” symbols in the 𝑗th row of 𝐴. 
 
Generally, the relationship between successive blocks in a 
staircase code satisfies the following relation: for any 𝑖 ≥ 1, 
each of the rows of the matrix [𝐵𝑖−1
𝑇  𝐵𝑖] is a valid codeword 
in 𝐶 . An equivalent description, from which the term 
“staircase codes” originates is suggested in Figure 2, in which 
(the concatenation of the symbols in) every row (and every 
column) in the “staircase” is a valid codeword of 𝐶. 
The rate of a staircase code is  
 
𝑅 = 1 −
𝑟
𝑚, 
() 
since encoding produces 𝑟 parity symbols for each set of 𝑚 −
𝑟 “new” information symbols. 
At the end of the information sequence, termination can be 
used to protect the final information block. In this case, after 
𝐿 information blocks enter the encoder, 𝛬 additional all-zero 
blocks enter the encoder. Note that the all-zero blocks are not 
sent over the channel, but the resulting parity bits are 
transmitted. 
 
 
Figure 2. “Staircase” visualization of staircase codes [15]. 
Then, the actual rate of the staircase code, including the 
tail, is given by 
 
𝑅 =
𝑚−𝑟
𝑚+𝛬𝑟
𝐿
. 
() 
The staircase codes are well suited for HDD. In this case, 
low complexity syndrome decoder can be used for decoding a 
component code. Efficient, high-throughput table-lookup 
based methods for decoding the component codes are 
highlighted in [15]. On the other hand, SDD is also possible 
to use for a component code decoder [16]. 
It is easy to verify that the structure of the staircase code 
parity-check matrix is very similar to the structure of SC-
LDPC code parity-check matrix (6):  
𝐇𝑆𝑡 = [
𝐇2
𝐇1
𝐇0
𝟎
   …
 …
   𝟎
   …
𝟎
𝟎
𝐇2
𝐇1

⋮
 𝟎
 ⋮
  𝟎
  ⋮
  𝐇2

𝐇1
𝟎
 𝐇0
 𝐇2
…
⋱
]. 
() 
The difference is that, in the staircase code parity-check 
matrix, the number of (2𝑚 × 2𝑚) submatrices 𝐇𝑖 is exactly 
3, and each bunch of rows in (11) is shifted by the size of 2 
sub-matrices. One more attractive property of the staircase 
codes is that the minimum distance of the staircase code is no 
less than 𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑛
2
, where 𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑛  is the minimum distance of a 
component code [15]. 
III. 
DECODING OF THE CONSIDERED CODES 
In this study, the SC-LDPC codes were decoded with the 
help of SDD only. Decoding of the staircase codes was 
considered for both SDD and HDD.  
A. Decoding of SC-LDPC codes  
The convolutional structure of SC-LDPC allows to define 
a latency constrained decoder using a sliding window of size 
𝑊. Consider the blocks of VNs of size 𝑀𝑏𝑣 . Due to the 
convolutional structure of matrix (6) two VN blocks with 
indices 𝑖 and 𝑗, such that 𝑗 ≥ 𝑖 + 𝑤 + 1, do not share any 
parity-check equation, i.e., VNs from these blocks cannot be 
r

connected to the same CN. Window decoder exploits this 
property of the convolutional parity-check matrix of SC-
LDPC code to define a decoder that deals with 𝑊 received 
blocks such that 𝑊 ≥ 𝑤 + 1. It has been shown in [7] that 
SC-LDPC codes decoded with a window decoder outperforms 
LDPC block codes under equal latency. 
The most common window decoding uses the VN-
centered strategy where a decoding window of size 𝑊 is 
defined by the set of VNs for 𝑊 consecutive blocks (of size 
𝑀𝑏𝑣 each). Some VNs on the left-hand side of the decoding 
window then share CNs with VNs that have already moved 
out of that window. CN → VN messages sent along the 
corresponding edges are not updated any longer, i.e., they are 
read-only. Similarly, some VNs on the right-hand side of the 
decoding window share CNs with VNs that have not yet been 
processed by the WD. The messages along the corresponding 
edges are also not updated in the current window. In terms of 
parity-check matrix, the sliding window decoder of size 𝑊 
operates on a section of 𝑊𝑀𝑏𝑐  rows (CNs) and 𝑊𝑀𝑏𝑣 
columns (VNs) of the matrix 𝐇𝐿, corresponding to 𝑊 coupled 
blocks. Figure 3 depicts the decoding window of size 4 when 
assuming an SC-LDPC code with memory 𝑤 = 2. The grey 
rectangles correspond to the parts of parity-check matrix not 
involved in the decoding process. The parts of parity-check 
matrix corresponding to currently (at moment 𝑡) updated VNs 
are marked with red. Other parts of parity-check matrix 
belonging to the same window are marked with blue. 
Performing updates on VNs in the window still requires 
access to messages sent along edges connected to previously 
decoded VNs, i.e., parts of matrix depicted by green. 
However, those accesses are read-only. Moving the sliding 
window to the next position means shifting it down by 𝑀𝑏𝑐 
CNs and right by 𝑀𝑏𝑣 VNs. 
 
Figure 3. Parts of parity-check matrix involved in window 
decoding. 
The window BP decoder consists of 𝑊𝑀𝑏𝑐  CNs and 
𝑊𝑀𝑏𝑣 VNs. The decoding performance depends on the sub-
block size 𝑏𝑣  and the memory 𝑤 , rather than on 𝐿 . This 
locality property allows using decoder structures that are 
independent of 𝐿 in terms of complexity, storage requirements 
and latency. Since the window size 𝑊 is a decoder parameter, 
it can be varied without changing the code, providing a 
flexible trade-off between performance and latency [7]. In 
general, the storage requirements for the decoder reduces by a 
factor of 
𝐿
𝑊 compared to the BP decoder operating on the 
length of the whole codeword. 
It is assumed that the window decoder uses all iterations 
locally inside one window position and only after fully 
decoding target VNs, the window is shifted to the next 
position. That makes it possible to unroll the iterations, which 
can significantly decrease the overall latency up to 𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 
times (where 𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 is the maximum number of iterations), 
keeping the area requirements not too high. The unrolled 
window decoder requires CN network of 𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑊𝑀𝑏𝑐 CN 
processors, rather than 𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐿𝑀𝑏𝑐 CN processors in case of 
decoding the whole codeword. 
The complexity of a decoder can be roughly estimated as 
follows. 
Each CN input should be updated once for each layer. 
Considering the structure of sub-matrices (8) we can assume 
that each VN in window is updated on average 3 times before 
being used in CN processing, which translates to 3𝑊𝑀𝑏𝑣 
additions (120𝑊 additions for 𝑀 = 8, 𝑏𝑣 = 5) per window 
per iteration. On average, each CN is connected to 5 VNs, i.e., 
each CN processing involves on average 20 box-plus 
operations for SP or 20 min operations for MS (since the CN 
output should be generated for each of 5 connected VNs and 
each CN output involves (5 − 1) = 4  box-plus or min 
operations). That gives 20𝑊𝑀𝑏𝑐 = 480𝑊 box-plus or min 
operations per window per iteration. We can assume that on 
average 5𝑀 LLRs are updated at each layer, which translates 
to 5𝑀𝑊𝑏𝑐 = 120𝑊  additions per window per iteration. 
Then, the overall decoding complexity can be estimated as 
240𝐿𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑊 additions and 480𝐿𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑊 box-plus or min 
operations for SP and MS algorithm correspondingly, where 
𝐿 is the number of blocks (code length is 𝑀𝐿𝑏𝑣 = 40𝐿), and 
𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 denotes maximum number of iterations. The required 
memory can be estimated as 𝑊𝑀𝑏𝑐 = 24𝑊 elements to store 
CN outputs in current window.  
B. Decoding of staircase codes  
Staircase codes in this study were decoded both with SDD 
and HDD methods. In SDD, the one-sweep optimal decoding 
[10] was used for a component code decoding. In HDD mostly 
some low complexity modifications of Bounded Distance 
Decoding (BDD) were applied for decoding of a component 
code. 
Similarly to the SC-LDPC code decoding, the SDD of the 
whole staircase code is based on the concept of windowing 
decoding. Consider the iterative decoding for window of 
length 𝑊 = 3 for simplicity. Assuming that the target block 
is 𝐵𝑖, blocks 𝐵𝑖−1, 𝐵𝑖 and 𝐵𝑖+1 are involved in the iterations. 
Denote by 𝐋𝑗
(𝑐ℎ) the channel Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) 
corresponding to (𝑚 × 𝑚) block 𝐵𝑗, by 𝐋𝑗
(𝑎𝑝𝑝) the a posteriori 
probability (APP) LLRs corresponding to APPs obtained after 
decoding the component codes, by 𝐋𝑗
(𝑎) the a priori LLRs, and 
by 𝐋𝑗
(𝑒)  the extrinsic LLR corresponding to block 𝐵𝑗 . For 
window length 𝑊 = 3 the extrinsic LLRs corresponding only 
to block 𝐵𝑖 are exchanged in iterations. At first half-iteration 
the input for the first 𝑚 symbols of the received sequence 𝐲 is 
formed by LLRs chosen from 𝐋𝑖−1
(𝑎𝑝𝑝) and the input for symbols 
𝑦𝑚+1, … , 𝑦𝑛 is formed by the LLRs from the sum 𝐋𝑖
(𝑎) + 𝐋𝑖
(𝑐ℎ). 
12

We assume that block 𝐵𝑖−1 is already decoded, or in case 𝐵1 
is the target block, block 𝐵0 is known a priori. At first iteration 
a priori LLRs are assumed to be zero, i.e., 𝐋𝑖
(𝑎) = 𝟎𝑚×𝑚. After 
decoding of 𝑚 codewords, the extrinsic LLRs are formed:  
 
𝐋𝑖
(𝑒) = 𝐋𝑖
(𝑎𝑝𝑝) − 𝐋𝑖
(𝑎), 
() 
and the extrinsic LLRs 𝐋𝑖
(𝑒) are provided for the second half-
iteration as an a priori information. At second half-iteration 
first 𝑚 input LLRs are chosen from the sum 𝐋𝑖
(𝑎) + 𝐋𝑖
(𝑐ℎ) , 
where 𝐋𝑖
(𝑎) is substituted by the extrinsic LLRs (12) obtained 
at first half iteration. The input LLRs corresponding to 
symbols 𝑦𝑚+1, … , 𝑦𝑛 are chosen from the LLRs 𝐋𝑖+1
(𝑐ℎ). After 
decoding, the extrinsic LLRs are provided as an a priori LLRs 
for the next iteration. 
Now consider the computation complexity of staircase 
code SDD. The number of operations (additions and 
multiplications) required for one-sweep decoding is half of 
needed for the Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek and Raviv (BCJR) 
algorithm and can be estimated as 𝑂(𝑛2𝑛−𝑘)  per one 
codeword, 
i.e., 𝑂(2𝑚(𝑊 − 1)𝑛2𝑛−𝑘)  operations 
per 
iteration per target block. The required memory corresponds 
to storage of one section of the trellis, i.e., 2𝑛−𝑘. Calculation 
of the extrinsic information requires 2𝑚2(𝑊 − 2) additions 
per iteration per block. Then, the overall computation 
complexity can be estimated as 𝐿𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(2𝑚2(𝑊 − 2) +
𝑂(2𝑚(𝑊 − 1)𝑛2𝑛−𝑘))  operations, where 𝐿  denotes the 
number of blocks and 𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 maximum number of iterations. 
Obviously, the overall complexity of 
SDD grows 
exponentially with (𝑛 − 𝑘). Thus, only codes with the low 
correcting capability can be considered for a component code. 
HDD imposes serious performance loss in comparison 
with SDD (usually around 2 dB). On the other hand, using 
HDD of a component code can be very attractive from the 
computational complexity point of view. Another argument 
supporting HDD is that it provides more flexibility in using 
different codes as a component code. As it was mentioned 
previously the computational complexity of the syndrome- 
based decoding grows exponentially with the syndrome size 
and therefore the choice of the codes that can be used as a 
component code is very limited. Of course, another possible 
option is to use BP algorithm for the component code 
decoding. However, this option also limits the choice of a 
component code since most part of known good codes are not 
suitable for BP decoding due to low girth. That limits us to use 
LDPC codes as component code but usually short LDPC 
codes provide quite low performance and in case of using 
longer LDPC codes as component code the decoding 
complexity grows fast as well. One of the most attractive 
features of HDD is that it is possible to use low-resolution 
exchange messages for iterative decoding. 
The simplest iterative decoding algorithm of staircase codes is 
based on the bounded-distance decoding (BDD) [15]. Usually 
it is called iterative BDD (iBDD) algorithm or intrinsic 
message passing.  
In [11], Extrinsic Message Passing (EMP) algorithm was 
proposed. It improves the iBDD performance with almost 
negligible decoding complexity increase. 
Recently, several hybrid decoding schemes combining 
SDD and HDD architectures have been proposed, which 
provide a suitable performance-complexity tradeoff between 
SDD and HDD. The unifying idea of these schemes is to 
employ HDD as the decoding core, while exploiting some 
level of soft information to improve the overall decoder 
performance. Examples of such an approach can be found in 
[12] - [14]. 
If a linear binary code is used as a component code very 
simple syndrome decoding can be used for decoding of a 
component code. The complexity of the component code 
decoder in this case is defined by the complexity of a 
syndrome calculation, which requires (𝑛 − 𝑘)𝑛  XOR 
operations. The drawback of this method is quite high 
memory requirements, which are 𝑂(2𝑛−𝑘) elements. In this 
case, the decoding algorithm is stick to one particular code. 
If BCH codes are used as a component code, it is possible 
to apply the algebraic decoding. In this case, the 
computational complexity of the algorithm can be estmated by 
the number of operations in Galois field 𝐺𝐹(2log2 𝑛). The 
overall number of operations in Galois field (including 
calculation of error values that is redundant for BCH codes) 
can be estimated as 6𝑛𝑡 + 9𝑡2, where 𝑡 is the number of 
correctable errors (error correcting capability of the code). In 
this case, the memory requirements are practically negligible 
since the memory is used only for storing the coefficients of 
polynomials of power no more than (𝑛 − 𝑘). 
In the same manner as in SDD, windowed decoding can 
be used in HDD as well. In this case, decoding of one target 
block requires decoding of 2𝑚(𝑊 − 1)  codewords per 
iteration. If the EMP is used for HDD the only additional 
opeartions needed to calculate the messages is some small 
amount of logic operations. In case hybrid approach, e.g., like 
in [13] is used, the required additional complexity to calculate 
the messages is not negligible. For example, calculation of 
LLRs according to [13] requires 2𝑚2(𝑊 − 2) additions per 
iteration per block. Then, the overall computation complexity 
can be estimated as 𝐿𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(2𝑚(𝑊 − 1)(𝑛 − 𝑘)𝑛)  XOR 
operations 
and 
𝐿𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(2𝑚2(𝑊 − 2))
 additions, 
if 
syndrome decoder is used and as 𝐿𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(2𝑚(𝑊 −
1)(6𝑛𝑡 + 9𝑡2))  operations in Galois field if algebraic 
decoding is applied for decoding of a component code. If EMP 
(or any other binary message passing) is used 2𝑚2(𝑊 − 2) 
bits is enough to store the messages. In case of hybrid 
approach, the required memory amount should be increased 
according to message resolution, e.g., for ternary message 
passing in [13] the memory size increases up to 4𝑚2(𝑊 − 2) 
bits. In case the syndrome decoding is used, additional 
𝑂(2𝑛−𝑘)  memory elements are required. In case of 
calculation parallelization, the amount of memory should be 
increased according to the number of parallel processes.  
IV. 
COMPARISON OF THE CONSIDERED CODES 
In this section, we will try to compare the considered codes 
taking into account how easy the code or code family can be 
13

adapted to different code rates. We will try to compare both 
performance and decoding complexity of the codes with 
similar parameters.  
A. SDD of both SC-LDPC and staircase codes  
The most obvious way of adapting the code to the different 
code rates is to construct a mother code of low code rate and 
then puncture parity-check bits to obtain codes of higher rates. 
For comparison the following mother codes were 
constructed. 
SC-LDPC ARJ based mother code was constructed in line 
with the description in Section II with the following 
parameters: 
- 
Memory size 𝑤 = 2; 
- 
Lifting size 𝑀 = 8; 
- 
Number of blocks 𝐿 = 55; 
- 
Code length 𝑁𝑆𝐶−𝐿𝐷𝑃𝐶 = 2200; 
- 
Mother code rate 𝑅𝑆𝐶−𝐿𝐷𝑃𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 = 0.38. 
Windowed SPA layered decoding with window size 𝑊 =
9 blocks and maximum number of iterations 𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 = 5 was 
used. Floating point messages are used for message passing. 
In the staircase mother code, extended (32, 21) BCH code 
capable of correcting 2 errors was used as a component code 
(𝑚 = 16, 𝑟 = 11). The staircase mother code parameters 
are: 
- 
Number of blocks 𝐿 = 8; 
- 
Number of terminating blocks 𝛬 = 0; 
- 
Code length 𝑁𝑆𝑡 = 2048; 
- 
Mother code rate 𝑅𝑆𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 = 0.31. 
 
Figure 4. Performance comparison of ARJ based SC-LDPC 
(𝑁𝑆𝐶−𝐿𝐷𝑃𝐶 = 2200) and staircase code (𝑁𝑆𝑡 = 2048) at Rtarg = 
0.4. SDD. 
The staircase code was decoded with the help of the SDD 
described in Section III.B with window size 𝑊 = 3 blocks 
and maximum number of iterations 𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 = 5 . The 
syndrome based one-sweep decoding was applied for 
decoding of a component code. Floating point messages are 
used for message passing. 
Simulation results for different code rates 𝑅𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔  are 
represented in Figure 4, 5 and 6. 
As can be seen from Figure 4, 5 and 6, with target code 
rate 𝑅𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔 = 0.4 , the SC-LDPC code outperforms the 
staircase code by more than 1 dB. However, with increasing 
target code rate, this performance gap decreases and at 
𝑅𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔 = 0.7 it is negligible. This can be explained by the fact 
that the initial mother code rate of the ARJ-based is higher, 
but puncturing deteriorates its performance faster than the 
performance of the staircase code. 
 
 
Figure 5. Performance comparison of ARJ-based SC-LDPC 
(𝑁𝑆𝐶−𝐿𝐷𝑃𝐶 = 2200) and staircase code (𝑁𝑆𝑡 = 2048) at Rtarg = 
0.6. SDD.

(𝑁𝑆𝐶−𝐿𝐷𝑃𝐶 = 2200) and staircase code (𝑁𝑆𝑡 = 2048) at Rtarg = 
0.7. SDD. 
Comparing the decoding complexity of used decoders 
according to estimates in Section III.A and Section III.B we 
can observe that the complexity of the staircase decoder is 
about 3 - 4 times higher than the complexity of the SC-LDPC 
decoder (depending on how to estimate the complexity of the 
box-plus operation).  
Taking into account the lower computational complexity 
and better performance of the ARJ-based SC-LDPC code, it 
would be the obvious choice for SDD. On the other hand, the 
drawback of this code family is the serious performance 
degradation with target rate increase. Most probably with 
some optimization efforts it would be possible to find some 
specific puncturing patterns that can provide not so fast 
performance degradation but it will take time to find optimal 
distribution of punctured bits between the sub-matrices of the 
parity-check matrix.

B. HDD for staircase codes  
As it was mentioned in Section A, the complexity of SDD 
for staircase codes is too high and the performance is inferior 
to the performance of the ARJ-based SC-LDPC code at low 
code rates. However, the performance of staircase codes does 
not drop as fast as the performance of the SC-LDPC codes 
with the code rate increase.  
Since our goal is to consider the codes that can provide 
high throughput, it might be interesting to consider the 
possibility of using HDD. As it was discussed in Section III.B, 
the staircase codes are especially attractive for the HDD since 
some good codes allowing low-complexity algebraic 
decoding can be used as a component code. Moreover, the 
performance drop due to applying HDD rather than SDD can 
be partly compensated by usage of more powerful codes, 
which are not possible to use in SDD due to prohibitively high 
decoding complexity. 
For example, it is possible to consider RS codes as 
component codes. Except the good performance one of the 
attractive properties of the RS codes is that they belong to the 
class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes for 
which any 𝑘 symbols of a codeword, where 𝑘 is the number 
of information symbols, forms the information sequence. Due 
to this property all puncturing patterns for RS codes are 
equally good and there is no need in designing special 
puncturing patterns when adapting the mother code for the 
target code rate. 
In this section, we consider the comparison of longer 
codes. We again apply SDD for decoding of the SC-LDPC 
code, but of lower complexity. We consider Min-Sum (MS) 
algorithm rather than Sum-Product Algorithm (SPA) and 
decrease the exchanged message resolution. High resolution 
of the exchanged messages can hinder achieving high 
throughput since it will require a lot of additional wiring in 
comparison with the low resolution message passing leading 
to serious limitation in possible parallelizing of computations. 
Thus, the binary message passing is especially attractive for 
high throughput decoders. In our simulations, we decrease the 
message resolution to 3 bits. 
The parameters of the SC-LDPC ARJ-based mother code 
used in the simulations are as follows: 
- 
Memory size 𝑤 = 2; 
- 
Lifting size 𝑀 = 8; 
- 
Number of blocks 𝐿 = 510; 
- 
Code length 𝑁𝑆𝐶−𝐿𝐷𝑃𝐶 = 20400; 
- 
Mother code rate 𝑅𝑆𝐶−𝐿𝐷𝑃𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 = 0.398. 
Windowed MS layered decoding with window size 𝑊 =
18 blocks and maximum number of iterations 𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 = 5 
was used. 3 bits messages are used for message passing. 
In the staircase mother code, extended (32, 23) RS code 
over the 𝐺𝐹(25) capable of correcting 4 errors was used as a 
component code, i.e., the code length in bits is 32 ∙ 5 = 160 
(𝑚 = 80 𝑏𝑖𝑡𝑠, 𝑟 = 45 𝑏𝑖𝑡𝑠) . The staircase mother code 
parameters are: 
- 
Number of blocks 𝐿 = 3; 
- 
Number of terminating blocks 𝛬 = 1; 
- 
Code length 𝑁𝑆𝑡 = 22800; 
- 
Mother code rate 𝑅𝑆𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 = 0.368. 
 The staircase code was decoded with the help of the 
binary message passing with window size 𝑊 = 3 blocks and 
maximum number of iterations 𝑁𝐼𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 = 5 , the algebraic 
decoding of the component RS code was used. Notice, that 
despite the exchanged messages have 5 bit resolution, this is 
5 bit message per 𝐺𝐹(25) symbol, i.e., per 5 bits. Thus, we 
can consider it as a binary message passing. 
Performance comparison of the ARJ-based SC-LDPC 
code (MS decoding, 3 bit message) and (32, 23)-RS-based 
staircase code (𝑚 = 80 𝑏𝑖𝑡𝑠 , 1 bit message) is shown in 
Figures 7, 8 and 9.  
 
 
Figure 7. Performance comparison of ARJ based SC-LDPC 
(𝑁𝑆𝐶−𝐿𝐷𝑃𝐶 = 20400) and RS-based staircase code (𝑁𝑆𝑡 = 22800) 
at Rtarg = 0.4. MS decoder for SC-LDPC, HDD for staircase code. 
 
Figure 8. Performance comparison of ARJ based SC-LDPC 
(𝑁𝑆𝐶−𝐿𝐷𝑃𝐶 = 20400) and RS-based staircase code (𝑁𝑆𝑡 = 22800) 
at Rtarg = 0.5. MS decoder for SC-LDPC, HDD for staircase code. 
As can be seen from Figures 7, 8 and 9, the performance 
of the ARJ based SC-LDPC code deteriorates much faster 
with the target rate increase than the performance of the RS-
based staircase code. At the same time, the performance of the 
RS-based staircase code changes quite smoothly with code 
rate increase. 
Comparison of the decoding complexity depends on how 
to estimate the computational complexity of min operation 
and the operation in Galois field. Assuming that the 
computational complexity of the min operation is equal to 
15

AICT 2022 : The Eighteenth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications

addition complexity, and the operation in Galois field has the 
same complexity (addition in Galois field is equivalent to 
XOR operation and multiplication is equivalent to addition on 
modulo (𝑛 − 1), where 𝑛 is the RS code length, or both 
operations can be implemented with Look-Up Table (LUT)), 
we can estimate that the decoding complexity of the ARJ 
based SC-LDPC code is 7 – 8 times greater than that of RS-
based staircase code. 
 
 
Figure 9. Performance comparison of ARJ based SC-LDPC 
(𝑁𝑆𝐶−𝐿𝐷𝑃𝐶 = 20400) and RS-based staircase code (𝑁𝑆𝑡 = 22800) 
at Rtarg = 0.7. MS decoder for SC-LDPC, HDD for staircase code. 
Moreover, with current parameters the amount of memory 
needed for storing the exchanged messages in window for 
ARJ based SC-LDPC code is about 200 times more than for 
the RS-based staircase code if the messages in BP decoder are 
stored in (𝑏𝑐 ∙ 𝑀 ∙ 𝑊 × 𝑏𝑣 ∙ 𝑀 ∙ 𝑊) matrix. More realistic is 
the case when each message simply consists of value and 
address. The number of messages in windowed MS decoding 
of SC-LDPC code can be estimated as 5𝑏𝑐 ∙ 𝑀 ∙ 𝑊 = 2160. 
Assuming that there are 𝑏𝑣 ∙ 𝑀 ∙ 𝑊 = 720 VNs in window, 
each CN→VN message comprises 3 bits bearing the value and 
10 bits address. That gives 2160 ∙ 13 = 28080 bits, which 
4.3 times more than 6400 bits needed for messages in staircase 
decoder with window size 3. 
One obvious drawback of the RS-based staircase codes is 
less flexibility with the choice of the code length since it 
should be a multiple of 𝑚2. This value depends on the choice 
of the RS code. However, here some optimization is also 
possible. For example, for Galois field 𝐺𝐹(2𝑝) if 𝑝 is not a 
prime the field element can be represented differently (e.g. as 
a (1 × 𝑝) vector or as a (𝑞1 × 𝑞2) matrix, where 𝑞1 ∙ 𝑞2 = 𝑝). 
Then, one representation leads to 𝑚 = 𝑝2𝑝−1 and another to 
𝑚 = 𝑞22𝑝−1 . In first case, 𝑝2𝑝−1  RS codes should be 
decoded at each half-iteration for each block. The second 
representation leads to necessity to decode 
𝑞22𝑝−1
𝑞1
 codes. Of 
course, the performance in case of second representation 
should be less than in first case but it could worth of 
considering. An example of staircase codes based on different 
representation of 𝐺𝐹(24) symbol is shown in Figure 10. 
Two representation of 𝐺𝐹(24) symbol ((2 × 2) and (1 ×
4)) leads to the staircase codes with different block size and 
therefore different code length. Both codes in Figure 10 
comprise 4 information blocks and 1 terminating block (𝛬 =
1). Obviously both codes have the same original rate 𝑅 =
0.3243. Representation (2 × 2) gives the block size 𝑚 = 16 
(8 RS codes must be decoded in block), which leads to the 
original code length 𝑁𝑆𝑡 = 1184, and representation (1 × 4) 
gives the block size 𝑚 = 32 (32 RS codes must be decoded 
in block) leading to the original code length 𝑁𝑆𝑡 = 4736. As 
can be seen from the performance curves in Figure 10, the 
behavior of both codes is quite similar with changing target 
code rate. 
 
Figure 10. Performance of staircase code based on (16, 11) RS 
code with different representation of GF(2^4) symbol. (2 × 2) and 
(1 × 4). 
In case performance provided by the HDD of RS codes is 
not enough, two other options can be considered. One of them 
is to apply soft decoding of RS codes based on Guruswami-
Sudan (GS) list decoding [18]. Another is to consider LDPC 
codes as a component code. On the other hand, both options 
lead to severe complexity increase. For example, even 
applying Nielsen interpolation to GS, overall complexity of 
the list decoding is 𝑂 (𝑛2 (
𝑛
𝑘)
1 2
⁄
𝑟5)  [19], which again 
narrows the choice of a component code.  
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The performance and complexity comparison of the ARJ 
based SC-LDPC codes and staircase codes shows that SDD 
SC-LDPC codes provide better performance and lower 
complexity than the staircase codes. However, the 
performance of SC-LDPC codes deteriorates very fast with 
code rate increase. 
The usage of HDD together with the powerful RS codes 
brings a benefit of significant complexity decrease with an 
affordable performance loss. Moreover, the performance of 
the RS-based staircase codes changes quite smoothly with the 
code rate increase. One more benefit of HDD of the RS-based 
staircase codes is the possibility of usage of binary message 
passing, which decreases significantly the amount of data 
exchange between the nodes. The latter property is especially 
important for reaching a high throughput. 
Therefore, the HDD of the RS-based staircase code can be 
considered as a good option for high-throughput decoding. In 
case higher performance will be needed, one of the interesting 
directions could be considered: the usage of LDPC codes as 
component codes in staircase code and BP decoding of a 
component code.

Abstract— In this paper, we present a machine learning 
technique for channel selection in a Device to Device (D2D)-
enabled cellular network targeting a wireless industrial 
environment. The presented Base Station Assisted (BSA) 
reinforcement learning technique uses a distributed local Q-
table for the agents (users), to prevent global information 
gathering within the cellular network. A stateless Q-learning 
approach is adopted to reduce the complexity of learning and 
the dimension of the Q-table. After the training of the D2D 
agents, the Q-tables of the D2D users are uploaded to the base 
station for resource allocation to be implemented centrally. 
Simulations results show that the presented technique provides 
a Radio Resource Management (RRM) solution with a good 
Quality of Service (QoS) performance compared to other 
conventional approaches.

 INTRODUCTION  
   Device-to-Device communication (D2D) is considered as 
a promising solution for ultra-reliable low-latency use cases 
because of associated advantages in terms of reduced 
latency, 
improved 
reliability 
and 
throughput. 
The 
integration of D2D into future industrial wireless networks 
and smart manufacturing facilitates the creation of massive 
machine-type 
connections 
[1]. 
 
Machine-Type 
Communication (MTC) is expected to support large 
numbers of smart devices, predominantly with small data 
volume requirements, which aggregates into a massive 
amount of data from parallel transmissions of a large number 
of devices. Achieving ultra-high reliability and ultra-low 
latency pose challenges in terms of bandwidth requirements. 
Yilmaz et al. [2] studied the transmission bandwidth needed 
to enable Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication 
(URLLC) for factory automation and found that the system 
bandwidth depends on the number of connected pieces of 
user equipment and the behaviour of their traffic. The 
scarcity of radio resources and the limitations on the 
available system bandwidth makes spectrum sharing a 
necessity for D2D implementation of MTC for factory 
automation [3]. RRM schemes need to be efficiently 
designed for interference management and coordination 
while guaranteeing tight URLLC demands.     
   Channel reuse among active devices in the same cells will 
generate interference which degrades system performance. 
Interference management is crucial to ensure efficient 
utilisation of available spectrum resources which is also 
particularly challenging for D2D deployments in underlay 
cellular networks.  
   The 
two 
major 
approaches 
to 
Radio 
Resource 
Management (RRM) are based on centralised and 
distributed methods. The centralised scheme requires global 
information gathering by base stations which often results in 
a high signalling overhead and increased complexity which 
tend to increase with the number of users, thus making it 
impractical. The distributed approach does not need a central 
entity; resource allocation is implemented by users therefore 
reducing the amount of information gathering and 
processing by base stations. However, a distributed RRM 
algorithm may also increase signalling overheads due to the 
high amount of information interchange among devices [4]. 
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently gained a lot of 
attention because of its suitability for the decision-making 
process where there is unknown or partial channel 
information. RL has been widely studied for intelligent 
power and spectrum allocations for D2D communication in 
cellular networks. Asheralieva and Miyanga [5] formulated 
the resource allocation problem as a non-cooperative game 
model among D2D users and a mixed strategy Nash 
Equilibrium was obtained.   However, the Quality of 
Experience (QoS) metrics of cellular users sharing channel 
resources with D2D links were not taken into account in the 
reward model. A multi-agent actor-critic structure is 
proposed in [6] which involves interactions between users 
and centralised sharing of all historical information. This 
leads to an increase in signalling overheads and information 
exchange. In [5]-[8], the reward function captured the QoS 
metric of the cellular users in a centralised Q-learning 
approach, which leads to increased signalling overheads as 
well.  
   In this paper, we present a semi-distributed reinforcement 
learning scheme for D2D resource allocation in a cellular 
network in an industrial setting. After the decentralised 
training of the agents, their Q-tables uploaded are forwarded 
to the base station for a centralised resource allocation.  The 
reward function is modeled in such a way that there is no 
information exchange related to other agents’ action or 
reward. To address the problem of the ‘curse of 
dimensionality’ associated with Q-learning, a stateless Q-
learning is adopted to reduce the dimension of the Q-table, 
nonetheless capturing the QoS demands of the D2D users.  
The paper is organised as follows: The problem 
formulation and system model are presented in Section II. In 
Section III, a stateless reinforcement learning algorithm for 
base station-assisted resource allocation is presented. 
Section IV presents some results and discussions of the 
simulation scenarios considered. Conclusions and directions 
for future work are summarised in Section V.

II. 
SYSTEM MODEL  
   We consider D2D and cellular users coexisting within a 
cellular network for uplink spectrum-sharing. There are 𝑁 
Cellular User Equipment (CUEs) represented by a set 𝐶 and 
𝑀 D2D User Equipment (DUEs) denoted by a set 𝐷 
randomly deployed within the coverage of the base station 
(BS) in a single cell system. The cellular users have strict 
performance requirements in the form of minimum Signal to 
Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) values to guarantee 
their throughput. The D2D links also have minimum SINR 
thresholds to guarantee their throughput demands, in 
addition, to the reliability and delay constraints.    We 
assume that each CUE has been pre-allocated a resource 
block. The transmit power of the CUEs and DUEs are 
denoted by 𝑃𝑐𝑖 and 𝑃𝑑𝑗, respectively. We denote 
𝑔𝑐,𝐵,  𝑔𝑑𝑇,𝐵,  𝑔𝑑𝑇,𝑑𝑅 and 𝑔𝑐,𝑑𝑅 as the channel gains from the 
CUE 𝑐𝑖 to the BS, the interference link from the DUE 
transmitter 𝑑𝑇 to the BS, the D2D link from the DUE 
transmitter  𝑑𝑇 to the receiver 𝑑𝑅 and the interference link 
form the CUE transmitter to the DUE receiver 𝑑𝑅, 
respectively.  
   The instantaneous received signal-to-interference-plus-
noise-ratio (SINR) at the BS from 𝑖th CUE and 𝑗th DUE 
over 𝑖th sub-channel at time slot 𝑡 is given as:  
            Γ𝑐𝑖(𝑡) =
𝑃𝑐𝑖𝑔𝑐,𝐵(𝑡)

                        (2) 
   λ𝑗
𝑖 ∈ {0,1} denotes the binary resource reuse indicator, 
λ𝑗
𝑖 = 1 implying 𝑗th DUE selects 𝑖th CUE sub-channel at 
time slot 𝑡 and λ𝑗
𝑖(𝑡) = 0 otherwise.  
 The data rates of the 𝑖th CUE and 𝑗th DUE is at time slot 𝑡 
are given by: 
              T𝑐𝑖(𝑡) = 𝑊𝑖 log2(1 + Γ𝑐𝑖(𝑡))                          (3) 
               T𝑑𝑗(𝑡) = 𝑊𝑖 log2 (1 + Γ𝑑𝑗(𝑡))                         (4) 
where 𝑊𝑖 is the bandwidth of each resource block. The 
variance of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is 
denoted by σ2. The resource allocation problem for D2D 
communication in cellular network is NP hard and cannot be 
solved directly and often requires global information 
gathering which increases complexity. The channel gains for 
links 𝑞 to 𝑟 can be expressed as follows: 
                      𝑔𝑞,𝑟=𝐺𝑟γ𝑞,𝑟𝜒𝑞,𝑟𝐿𝑞,𝑟
−𝛼𝑟                                 (5) 
where 𝐺𝑟 is the pathloss constant, 𝛾𝑞,𝑟 is the small-scale 
fading gain due to multipath propagation and assumed to 
have an exponential distribution with unit mean. The large-
scale fading comprises pathloss with exponent 𝛼𝑟 and 
shadowing which has a slow fading gain 𝜒𝑞,𝑟 with a log-
normal distribution. 𝐿𝑞,𝑟 is the distance from terminal 𝑞 to 
terminal 𝑟 [9]. The channel gain from D2D link 𝑑𝑗 of 
transmitter 𝑑𝑇 to the receiver 𝑑𝑅 is 𝑔𝑑𝑇,𝑑𝑅, the channel gain 
of the interference link from 𝑑𝑇 to the base station is 𝑔𝑑𝑇,𝐵 
and from CUE 𝑐𝑖 to DUE 𝑑𝑗 receiver is ℎ𝑐,𝑑𝑅 and  ℎ𝑐,𝐵,  is 
the channel gain from CUE 𝑐𝑖 to the base station BS. The 
channel gain 𝑔𝑑𝑇,𝑑𝑅 and 𝑔𝑐,𝑑𝑅 can be estimated at the DUE 
receiver, 𝑑𝑅 and made available at its transmitter, 𝑑𝑇 
instantaneously [10]. Similarly, 𝑔𝑐,𝐵 and  𝑔𝑑𝑇,𝐵  can be 
obtained at BS through local information since uplink 
transmission is considered. The reliability of the DUE 𝑑𝑗 ∈
𝐷,  𝜉𝑑𝑗(𝑡), is defined as the probability of packet delay 
exceeding a predefined delay bound, 𝑙𝑑𝑗,max, for channel 𝑖 at 
slot 𝑡 is less than a threshold [11]. Only the transmission 
delay is considered in this work. The objective of the system 
is to maximise the total throughput, 𝑇𝑅, of paired CUE and 
DUEs while satisfying the QoS demands.

The minimum CUE SINR, Γ𝑐𝑖,min, to guarantee the 
throughput requirement of the CUEs is defined in constraint 
(6a). Constraint (6b) takes into account reliability and delay, 
where 𝑙𝑑𝑗 is the packet delay constraint for packet 
transmission of DUE 𝑑𝑗. The expression captures the fact 
that the end-to-end delay should be less than 𝑙𝑑𝑗,max with a 
probability of at least 1 − 𝜉𝑑𝑗
∗ . Constraints (6c) and (6d) are 
channel association criteria. The reliability of the DUE links 
in (6c) is evaluated using an empirical estimation of number 
of packets transmitted similar to [11], from 𝑑𝑇 to 𝑑𝑅 whose 
delay is within the budget 𝑙𝑑𝑗,max over the total number of 
packets sent to 𝑑𝑅 at time slot 𝑡 i.e.,

where 𝐿𝑑𝑗(𝑡) is the number of packets for which 𝑙𝑑𝑗 >
𝑙𝑑𝑗,max and 𝐿𝑑𝑗
′ (𝑡) is the number of packets transmitted with 
𝑙𝑑𝑗 ≤ 𝑙𝑑𝑗,max (or number of packet delivered within the 
delay bound). 𝐵𝑑𝑗(𝑡) is total packet transmitted by DUE 𝑑𝑗 
at time slot 𝑡. Reliability can also be measured in terms of 
the outage probability, which is the probability that the 
measured SINR is lower than a minimum is less than a 
predefined threshold. The closed expression of the outage 
probability of 𝑗th DUE conditioned on the selected 𝑖th 
channel at time slot 𝑡  is given below [12].

probability of 𝑑𝑗. The reliability of the DUE in terms of 
outage probability is expressed as: 
 
                          𝜉𝑑𝑗(𝑡) = 1 − 𝑝𝑅(𝑡)                               (9) 
 
Transmission delay is given as the ratio of packet size 
transmitted within delay bound to transmission rate [13].  
From (7), (8) and (9) the transmission of 𝑗th DUE on the 𝑖th 
RB is formulated as: 
                      𝑙𝑑𝑗(𝑡) =
𝐿𝑑𝑗
′ (𝑡)
𝑊𝑖log2(1 + Γ𝑑𝑗)                    (10) 
 The resource allocation problem for D2D communication 
in a cellular network is complex and a direct solution is not 
feasible. We present next a base station-assisted resource 
allocation scheme which adopts a semi-distributive RRM 
approach. 
 
III. 
STATELESS REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR         
BASE STATION-ASSISTED  RESOURCE ALLOCATION  
   The goal of the agents is to maximise the throughput in a 
D2D-enabled cellular network. At each time slot 𝑡, a DUE, 
observes a state 𝑠𝑡 and takes an action 𝑎𝑡 from the action 
space, (i.e., select an RB 𝑘𝑖), according to the policy π. Q-
learning enables an agent to determine the optimal strategy 
that maximises its long term expected cumulative reward 
[14]. The Q-value is updated as follows: 
 
𝑄𝑡+1  =
        {
𝑄𝑡(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) + 𝜎 [𝑟𝑡 + 𝜂 max
𝑎′ 𝑄𝑡(𝑠𝑡+1, 𝑎𝑡+1) − 𝑄𝑡(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡)]  
if  𝑠 = 𝑠𝑡,   𝑎 = 𝑎𝑡
𝑄𝑡(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) , otherwise                                                    (11)
     
 
where 𝜎 ∈ [0,1] is the learning rate. With 𝜎 = 0,  the Q-
values are never updated, hence no learning has taken place; 
setting 𝜎 to a high value such as means that learning can 
occur quickly and 0 ≤ 𝜂 ≤ 1 is the discount factor used to 
balance immediate and future reward [14].     
  The state-action dimension is reduced by adopting a 
stateless learning approach. For the considered scenario, any 
action 𝑎𝑖 ∈ 𝐴 taken by an agent will result in the end of an 
episode i.e., states 0 and 1 are terminal states, where 
𝑆𝑑𝑗
𝑖 (𝑡)  = 1 is the goal state of the DUEs. Therefore, the 
learning environment can be modelled entirely using a 
stateless Q-learning i.e., action-reward only since the state 
transition is not required. An agent can choose its action 
based solely on its Q-value and the updated Q-value of the 
chosen action is based on the current Q-value and the 
immediate reward from selecting that action. The update 
function in (11) is re-formulated as follows: 
 
𝑄𝑡+1(𝑎𝑡) = {𝑄𝑡(𝑎𝑡) + 𝜎[𝑟(𝑎𝑡) − 𝑄𝑡(𝑎𝑡)], if  𝑎 = 𝑎𝑡
𝑄𝑡(𝑎𝑡),          otherwise
  (12)            
                                                                                       
where 𝑟(𝑎𝑡) is the immediate reward of selecting 𝑎. In 
contrast to the standard Q-value update function in (11), it 
can be seen in (12) that not only the state-action formation 
(𝑠, 𝑎) is not necessary, but also the information of the next 
state 𝑠𝑡+1 is not required because the actions lead to a 
terminal state. Therefore, the Q-table is defined in terms of 
the actions only and updated using the immediate reward. 
This results in 1 × |𝑁| dimension Q-table for 𝑗th DUE.This 
method reduces the learning complexity and the Q-table 
dimension.  
   The traditional cellular users in the network need to be 
protected from the interference caused by the DUEs for their 
minimum SINR to be satisfied. This may be achieved by 
integrating the SINR of the CUE, Γ𝑐𝑖 in the state space or 
reward function modelling. This way, the DUEs can obtain 
the information from BS at time slot 𝑡 as in [15]-[17]; hence, 
the DUEs get a reward if the CUE SINR Γ𝑐𝑖 ≥ Γ𝑐𝑖,min , on 
the and a penalty otherwise. Rather than the BS exchange 
the measured CUE SINR, Γ𝑐𝑖, with the DUEs for every 
action 𝑎𝑡 taken at each time slot, we adopt a scheme in which 
the BS keeps a look-up table of the 𝑖th CUE based on the 
actions on the DUEs.

   There are a number of methods to select an action based 
on the current evaluation of the Q-value at every time slot 𝑡 
using a policy denoted by 𝑝𝑑𝑗
𝑡 . These methods are used to 
balance exploration and exploitation [18]. Epsilon greedy 
(𝜀-greedy) is one of the methods of choosing an optimal Q-
value.  
   The reward function is modelled such that it relies only on 
local observations and can be implemented in a distributive 
manner. The rewards of the 𝑗th DUE and 𝑖th CUE for taking 
an action 𝑎𝑖
𝑡 is expressed in terms of the achievable 
throughput using the Shannon capacity formula. Therefore, 
the reward is directly related to the objective function of the 
optimisation problem. The following is a summary of the 
Base Station Assisted (BSA) Reinforcement Learning 
Algorithm: 
  The 𝑗th DUE only gets a reward when all state variables 
are 1 (i.e., the minimum QoS demands are met) while 𝑖th 
CUE gets a reward if its minimum SINR is satisfied at each 
time slot for the action taken by 𝑗th DUE. From the reward 
function defined above, learning can be implemented 
independently in a decentralised manner such that each 
agent maintains a local Q-table. There is no information 
exchange relating to other agents’ actions or rewards and no 
cooperation is needed between the agents, which results in 
reduced signalling overheads and reduced complexity 
compared with a centralised Q-learning approach.  
IV. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
   The performance of the presented BSA scheme is verified 
by considering a single-cell network in an industrial 
scenario. The simulation setup and channel models are 
summarised in Tables I and II. The network dynamics are 
captured by generating the channel fading effects randomly. 
The throughput is the main metric used to evaluate the 
performances of the algorithms. The performances of BSA 
are compared with centralised optimisation and the game 
theoretic Deferred Acceptance (DA) schemes [9].

 The throughput performance of matched DUEs as a 
function of the number of DUEs in the system 𝑀, is shown 
in Fig. 1. It can be concluded that the sum throughput of the 
DUEs increases with the number of cellular users 𝑀 for all 
the considered algorithms. As expected, the number of 
admitted DUEs increases with the introduction of new 
DUEs to the system but remains unchanged if a valid 
cellular resource-sharing partner cannot be found because 
the minimum QoS requirements are not satisfied.  
   The centralised optimisation and BSA approaches are 
comparable, while the DA method shows the least 
performance. The BS-A algorithm outperforms the DA 
algorithms by up to 9.69% increase in the DUE throughput 
performance. However, it is semi-distributive as the final 
resource allocation is implemented by the BS whereas the 
DA approach is decentralised (the channel selection is user-
centric with no BS intervention to achieve autonomy). 
Players can make their resource allocations choices to 
maximise their individual and ultimately achieve system 
stability.   
   The performance of the sum throughput of the matched 
UEs (that is valid pairings between CUEs and DUEs) with 
respect to the number of cellular users 𝑀 is presented in Fig. 
2. The sum throughput increases with 𝑀. The BS-A 
approach shows better performance at 𝑀 ≤ 35 with up to 
12.05% increase in sum throughput compared to the 
centralised approach while the centralised approach 
performed better at 𝑀 > 35 with up to 9.39% increase in 
throughput. The DA algorithm again shows the least 
performance with up to 11.29% decrease compared with the 
BS-A technique.  The effect of the outage probability of the 
𝑝𝑅0, and delay threshold of the DUEs 𝑙𝑑𝑗,max  on the sum 
rate of the matched UEs for all algorithms is shown in Fig. 
3 and Fig. 4. The sum throughput of the matched UEs 
increases with 𝑝𝑅0 and 𝑙𝑑𝑗,max. This is because higher 𝑝𝑅0 
causes the interference from the CUEs to be more tolerable 
by the DUEs, therefore making potential CUE-DUE pairing 
possible. Similarly, higher 𝑙𝑑𝑗,max increases the sum 
throughput at fixed outage probability and payload since the 
delay requirement is less stringent. More DUEs are able to 
satisfy the delay constraint and the number of admitted 
DUEs are increased. 
 
V.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
   We presented a semi-distributed Base Station Assisted 
(BSA) scheme for Radio Resource Management (RRM) of 
a network with D2D and cellular users, targeting wireless 
industrial scenarios. The reinforcement learning based

approach relies on distributed training of the D2D agents. 
Subsequently, the look-up tables for the D2D agents are 
loaded to the base station for centralised channel allocation. 
Simulation results show that the throughput of the presented 
approach 
is 
comparable 
to 
traditional 
centralised 
optimisation and demonstrates an improved performance 
relative to the deferred acceptance (DA) scheme. The future 
work will focus on evaluating the trade-off between 
performance, complexity and signaling overheads for the 
BSA scheme relative to other techniques.
