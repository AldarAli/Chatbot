Forward
The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Cognitive Radio (COCORA 2016), held
between February 21-25, 2016 in Lisbon, Portugal, continued a series of events dealing with
various aspects, advanced solutions and challenges in cognitive (and collaborative) radio
networks. It covered fundamentals on cognitive and collaborative radio, specific mechanisms
and protocols, signal processing and dedicated devices, measurements and applications.
Most of the national and cross-national boards (FCC, European Commission) had/have a
series of activities in the technical, economic, and regulatory domains in searching for better
spectrum management policies and techniques, due to spectrum scarcity and spectrum
underutilization issues. Therefore, dynamic spectrum management via cognition capability can
make opportunistic spectrum access possible (either by knowledge management mechanisms
or by spectrum sensing functionality). The main challenge for a cognitive radio is to detect the
existence of primary users reliably in order to minimize the interference to licensed
communications. Optimized collaborative spectrum sensing schemes give better spectrum
sensing performance. Effects as hidden node, shadowing, fading lead to uncertainties in a
channel; collaboration has been proposed as a solution. However, traffic overhead and other
management aspects require enhanced collaboration techniques and mechanisms for a more
realistic cognitive radio networking.
The conference had the following tracks:

Mechanisms and Protocols

Applications, measurement and management
We take here the opportunity to warmly thank all the members of the COCORA 2016
technical program committee, as well as all the reviewers. The creation of such a high quality
conference program would not have been possible without their involvement. We also kindly
thank all the authors that dedicated much of their time and effort to contribute to COCORA
2016. We truly believe that, thanks to all these efforts, the final conference program consisted
of top quality contributions.
Also, this event could not have been a reality without the support of many individuals,
organizations and sponsors. We also gratefully thank the members of the COCORA 2016
organizing committee for their help in handling the logistics and for their work that made this
professional meeting a success.
We hope COCORA 2016 was a successful international forum for the exchange of ideas and
results between academia and industry and to promote further progress in the area of
cognitive (and collaborative) radio networks. We also hope that Lisbon, Portugal provided a
pleasant environment during the conference and everyone saved some time to enjoy the
beauty of the city.

Abstract—Even though wireless Internet service has grown
rapidly, the available wireless bandwidth resource is limited. So,
efficient network bandwidth resources management has become
an important issue. Recently, cognitive radio technology has been
getting a lot of attention to improve bandwidth efficiency. In this
paper, we propose an adaptive bandwidth management scheme
based
on
the
mechanism
design
and
negotiation
theory.
According to the user`s utility, Quality of Service (QoS) and trust
value, the proposed scheme allocates total resources while
dynamically
controlling
the selfish
users. In addition,
the
proposed scheme is able to make a control decision in a
distributed manner. This approach can reduce the excessive
number of operations and increase the primary user`s profit; it is
practical for real world network operations. Simulation results
show
that
the
proposed
scheme
provides
much
better
performance than the existing schemes.

INTRODUCTION
Radio spectrum is the scarcest resource for wireless
communications. Therefore, in the next generation wireless
network, it may become congested due to diverse types of
users and applications. Recently, regulatory bodies like the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United
States are recognizing that traditional fixed spectrum allocation
can be very inefficient. In order to fully utilize the scarce
spectrum resources, Cognitive Radio (CR) technology has
becomes a promising approach, which allows unlicensed
wireless users (secondary users: SUs) to dynamically access
the licensed bands from legacy spectrum holders (primary
users: PUs) on a negotiated or an opportunistic basis. Dynamic
spectrum access in CR networks can enhance the radio
resource utilization. To realize efficient spectrum usage, we
must migrate from the current static spectrum access to a
dynamic spectrum [1]-[3].
Most existing resource allocation approaches for CR
networks assume that SUs are truthful, cooperative and always
successful in operation. Therefore, SUs always send truthful
information in interference environment, even though they can
fail resource allocation. These assumptions are only available
in an ideal theoretical situation. However, in the real world,
untruthful SUs exist; they can lie in order to get more spectrum
resource by using untruthful information. In such cases, the CR
network administrator wishes to design a new protocol that
extracts the missing information from the SUs. Due to this
reason, we need a new game model to force selfish SUs to
cooperate.
To effectively manage the limited spectrum resource,
extensive research has been carried out. Nowadays, game
theory has become a powerful tool to analyze and improve the
performance of CR network control protocols. Game theory is
the mathematical theory of interactions between self-interested
agents. It can describe the possibility to react to the actions of
the other decision makers and analyze the situations of conflict
and cooperation. In particular, it focuses on decision making in
settings where each player’s decision can influence the
outcomes of other players. In such settings, each player must
consider how each other player will act in order to make an
optimal choice. In the game theory, a game consists of player,
strategies and payoff function [4]-[6].
Recently, researchers have proposed various algorithms to
optimally share the spectrum resource using cognitive radio
technologies. Auction game models also have been proposed
for efficient spectrum sharing in CR networks. Initially, auction
game has been studied extensively in the economics literature.
Usually,
it is implemented with
efficient
social choice
functions; participants have private information about their
preferences. An auction is a process of buying and selling
goods or services by offering them up for bid, taking bids, and
then selling the item to the highest bidder. In game theory, an
auction game may refer to any mechanism or set of trading
rules for exchange. A well-known auction mechanism is the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves
(VCG)
mechanism
[7].
It
is
a
generalization of the famous Vickery auction where bidders
submit written bids without knowing the bid of the other
bidders in the auction. The important properties of the VCG
mechanism are direct-revelation and strategy proof [8]; each
bidder reveals his/her true value no matter what strategies the
other bidder chooses. However, the VCG mechanism needs a
huge computational overhead. Therefore, the traditional VCG
mechanism might be impractical for the system’s overall
operations.
In 1982, Israeli economist Ariel Rubinstein built up an
alternating-offer bargain model based on the Stahl’s limited
negotiation model; it is known as a Rubinstein bargaining
process. This model can provide a possible solution to the
problem that two players are bargaining with the division of the
benefits [9]. Most of all, the Rubinstein can significantly

reduce the computational complexity and overhead. It is
practical and suitable for real implementation.
In this paper, we propose a new spectrum allocation scheme
for CR networks. In our game model, SUs are game players,
and
can
make
strategic
decisions
independently
while
maximizing their payoffs. By using the VCG mechanism, our
proposed scheme is designed as a cooperative game model. In
addition, to effectively reduce the computational overhead of
VCG mechanism, we adopt the Rubinstein bargaining model.
This integrated approach can simplify the implementation of
VCG mechanism. Therefore, our proposed scheme effective
controls selfish SUs to increase the total system utility while
reducing the VCG mechanism time complexity.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II explains the
related works. In Section III, we present the proposed
algorithms in detail. In Section IV, performance evaluation
results are presented along with comparisons with other
schemes. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section V.
II. RELATED WORKS
In this section, we introduce two game-theoretic models
for the effective resource allocation in CR networks. In
Section II-A, we present the desired properties of a VCG
mechanism design to effectively control selfish SUs. In
Section II-B, we introduce the Rubinstein Bargaining Model,
which can help VCG mechanism design to decrease time
complexity.
A. VCG mechanism
VCG mechanism is a field of Mechanism Design (MD) to
study a solution concept for the class of private information
games. Traditional MD consists of a specification of possible
agent strategies and the mapping of each strategy from a set of
strategies
to
an
outcome.
Agents
are
assumed
to
be
autonomous and economically rational; they select a best-
response strategy to maximize their expected utility with other
agents. The family of direct-revelation and strategy-proof
mechanisms has been derived from the MD theory and are
referred to as VCG mechanism. The VCG mechanism has
better computational properties than the original MD and
provides a normative guide for outcomes and payments. When
applying the VCG mechanism to complex MD problems, a
feasible outcome can be obtained from the results
of
computationally tractable heuristic algorithms [10]. Each
agent in the VCG mechanism is of a specific type. According
to its type, an agent selects a specific strategy, which defines
the agent’s actions. Generally, an agent type is represented
byߠ,(e.g., each agent i is of typeߠ௜).
The VCG mechanism is a special case among traditional
mechanisms, in which the agent-announced type (ߠ෠) is no
longer necessarily truthful; the symbolߠ෠ indicates that agents
can misreport their true types. Based on agent-announced
types, the choice rule (݇∗൫ߠ෠൯) is defined as follows [11]
݇∗൫ߠ෠൯ = argmax௞∈ࣥ ෍ݒ௜൫݇,ߠ෠௜൯
(1)
୧
where k is a feasible choice of the set of all possible
choices andݒ௜൫݇,ߠ෠௜൯ defines the agent i’s outcome of a choice
k with its typeߠ෠௜; the VCG mechanism implements the choice
k*
that
maximizes
∑ݒ௜(݇,ߠ෠௜)௜.
Therefore,
the
VCG
mechanism maximizes the total outcome of the system to the
agents. Based on ݇∗൫ߠ෠൯ , the payment rule ( ݌௩௖௚,௜(ߠ෠)) is
defined as follows
݌௩௖௚,௜൫ߠ෠൯ =ݒ௜൫݇∗൫ߠ෠൯,ߠ෠௜൯ − {ܸே − ܸேି௜}
(2)
where ܸே is the total reported outcome of k* and ܸேି௜ is
the total reported outcome of the choice that would be gotten
without agent i, i.e., ܸே = max௞∈ࣥ ∑ݒ௜൫݇,ߠ෠௜൯
୧
and ܸேି௜ =
max௞∈ࣥ ∑ݒ௝൫݇,ߠ෠௝൯
௝ஷ௜
.
B. Rubinstein Bargaining Model
In Rubinstein-Stahl bargaining model, players have their
own bargaining power (δ). The division proportion of the
benefits can be obtained according to the bargaining power,
which can be computed at each player individually. The
higher the bargaining power, the more a player benefits from
the bargaining. Players negotiate with each other by proposing
offers alternately. After several rounds of negotiation, they
finally reach an agreement as follows
(ݔଵ

That is to say, there is a first-proposer advantage in the
bargaining process. Traditionally, the bargaining power in the
Rubinstein-Stahl's model is defined as follows
ߜ=݁ିక×∆,ݏ.ݐ.,ߦ>0(4)
where ∆ is the time period of the negotiation round. Given
the ∆ is fixed (i.e., unit_time),ߜ is monotonic decreasing with
theߦ.ߦ is an instantaneous discount factor to adaptively adjust
the bargaining power.

time, the solution to this type of bargaining game was a
mystery. Therefore, Rubinstein’s solution is one of the most
influential findings in cooperative game theory [11].
III. PROPOSED SCHEME
In this section, the proposed scheme is explained in detail.
The proposed scheme is designed to provide an effective
resource allocation for CR network. The main objective of our
2

scheme is to maximize social welfare by the optimal resource
allocation.
A. Bargaining process for distribution of resources
In CR network, SUs use the spectrum bandwidth that
should not have interference. Due to this reason, only SUs who
are in available interference distance can use spectrum
bandwidth. To secure enough interference distance, SUs are
grouped as clusters by exchanging SU’s distance information,
and can guarantee the mutual interference. The SUs are
clustered as follows, i) all SUs exchange their distance
information and perform the cluster operation only with SUs
that are in their mutual interference, ii) in each cluster, leaders
are selected by random process, iii) all SUs in each cluster send
request message to leader, iv) leaders in each cluster send
cluster request message to administrator, v) the administrator
calculates each cluster leader’s Signal to Interference plus
Noise Ratio (SINR), and allocates allocation sequence number
by using SINR.
To allocate the total resource, the administrator starts to
bargain with each cluster leader, sequentially. In this paper,
Rubinstein bargaining approach is used for the fairness
allocation. In the Rubinstein bargaining model, the decision of
patience factor values is a key issue. For the SU’s patience
factor on the aggregated SUs’ payoff. If the sum of SU’s utility
increases, the total system payoff also increases. Therefore,
δ௚ can be defined as follows
δ௚ =
1
ߙ×ݒ+ߚ×ݍ+ߛ×ݐݎ,
ݏ.ݐ.,݀δ௚(ݒ)
݀ݒ>0, δ௚(0) = 1 and δ௚(∞) = 0
(5)
whereߙ,ߚ,ߛ are weighted factors for value (ݒ), importance
of traffic (ݍ) and trust value (ݐݎ). In the proposed scheme, to
provide the fairness for each leader, administrator decides
patience factor (δ஺) to be the midpoint of all leaders’ payoffs
like as
δ஺ =
2
∑
(݃௝(ݒ)+݃௝(ݍ)+݃௝(ݐݎ))௠
௝ୀଵ
(6)
Based on the obtained δ௚ and δ஺ values, we can develop
the Rubinstein bargaining process. The administrator collects
each leader’s bandwidth request, and defines each cluster’s
total request (g) as follows,
g௝ = ෍ r௜
௡
௜ୀଵ
(7)
where r௜ is the agent i’s bandwidth request, and g௝ is the
cluster ݆’s total request. According to the administrator’s offer
(x) and cluster ݆’s offer (y), the equilibrium point of Rubinstein
bargaining model can be obtained. Finally, the Rubinstein
bargaining equilibrium point can be expressed as follows:
ݔ∗=
1− δ௚ೕ
1 − δ஺δ௚ೕ
,ݕ∗=1− 
1− δ௚ೕ
1 − δ஺δ௚ೕ
(8)
In this work, VCG mechanism is used to effectively control
selfish users and resource allocation, which can increase a
social welfare. However, the main disadvantage of VCG
mechanism is the higher computation complexity. To reduce
the computation complexity, firstly, we group all SUs into each
cluster, and the Rubinstein bargaining model is applied to each
cluster, iteratively. According to the Rubinstein bargaining
process, we can distribute the total bandwidth resource (R) to
each cluster. Finally, the VCG mechanism is used in each
cluster to effectively control selfish users and resource
allocation, which can increase a social welfare. Our distributed
approach is more practical and justified for real network
operations.
B. Resource allocation based on trust VCG mechanism
In the VCG model, vector of allocation K is defined as
follows
ࡷ={∅,߬ଵழି௔௟௟௢, ߬ଶழି௔௟௟௢, … , ߬௜ழି௔௟௟௢}
(9)
Let ∅ and < −݈݈ܽ݋ be
respective
non-allocation
and
resource allocation, respectively. If the SU ݅ gets the resource
(k=߬௜ழି௔௟௟௢,ࡷ=∅), his cost function (c௜(ࡷ)) is defined as
c௜(τ) . The total system value function (ݒ௔௟௟௢(ࡷ)) can be
defined asݒ௔௟௟௢(ࡷ)=ݒ௔௟௟௢(߬). We define the vector of
successful probability = [݌ଵ(τ), … , ݌௜(τ)] , and the SU ݅ ’s
successful probability (݌୧(߬)) can be defined as the ratio of the
total successful task operation (∑
(߬௟ೞೠ೎೎೐ೞೞ
௜
)
௅
௟ୀଵ
) to the total task
(∑
(߬௟
௜)
௅
௟ୀଵ
).
݌୧(߬) =
∑
(߬௟ೞೠ೎೎೐ೞೞ

)

∑
(߬௟
௜)
௅
௟ୀଵ
,ݏ.ݐ.,(݌୧(߬) ∈ [0,1]
(10)
where ߬௟
௜ represents whether the task allocation is allocated
(0) or not (1), and ߬௟ೞೠ೎೎೐ೞೞ
௜
represents whether the task is
successfully operated or not. The expected value function
(ݒ̅௔௟௟௢(ࡷ,݌)) is defined based on the probability ݌୧(߬).
ݒ̅௔௟௟௢(ࡷ,݌)=ݒ௔௟௟௢(ࡷ)×݌௜(τ)
(11)
Each SU should send his own information about the
probability (݌̂) and cost function (ܿ̂) to the administrator. At the
same time, each SU also can send the un-trust information
(ܿ̂, ݌̂) to maximize his profit. In the proposed scheme, the
resource allocation is adaptively controlled based on the
accurate analysis of costs and payoffs. In more detail, the

Similar to the traditional VCG mechanism, the payoff of
each SU is defined as the marginal contribution of the selected
SU to the CR system; it is extracted by comparing the second
best decision, excluding the selected SU. Without the best SU,
the second-best expected payoff for the CR service, which
allocates resource can be obtained as follows by considering
success and fail cases.

whereࡷି௜ is a set of allocation without the SU i. With
probability (݌௜(߬)), the expected utility (ݑത௜(ܿ̂, ݌̂)) is achieved
based on the expected marginal contribution, which is the
difference between the best and the second-best expected
utility.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme
is validated through simulation. To emulate a real-world
CR environment and for a fair comparison, we carefully
select the system parameters as shown in Table 1. Using
our simulation model, the performance of the proposed
scheme is compared with the two CR resource allocation
schemes; the traditional VCG scheme [12] and the single
TBMs scheme [13].

Usually, the performance of CR systems depends on the
sum of SUs’ payoff, total system payoff, the SUs’ satisfaction
and task succession probability. In this paper, the performance
measures are plotted as the number of SUs.
Figure. 1. Total system efficiency due to the number of SUs
In Figure 1, the system revenues of each scheme are
compared to each other. System revenue is estimated as the
total sum of successful SU task profits. From the service
providers’ point of view, it is a very important performance
factor. From the simulation results, we can see that the system
revenue of our proposed scheme is higher than the other
existing schemes.

Figure 2 shows the QoS satisfaction of SUs. From the
viewpoint of SUs, QoS satisfaction is a critical issue. Usually,
QoS evaluation factors are availability (uptime), bandwidth
(throughput), latency (delay), error rate, and so on. However,

factor. Under various operation times or the number of SUs,
the proposed scheme can provide much better QoS satisfaction
than other schemes.
Figure. 3. Satisfaction of Trust with distance
Figure 3 shows the performance evaluation about trust
satisfaction. When the administrator allocates the spectrum
resource, trust satisfaction for all SUs is obtained. These results
represent the system’s satisfaction. Our proposed scheme
considers the trust value, QoS satisfaction and SU’s utility.
Therefore, the proposed scheme can maintain a better trust
satisfaction than other existing schemes.
V. CONCLUSION
Recently,
the
design
of
effective
CR

algorithms has been one of intense research issues. In this
paper, we propose a new adaptive bandwidth management
scheme based on the VCG mechanism and Rubinstein
bargaining model. Based on the SU’s payoff, QoS and trust
information, the proposed scheme can dynamically allocate
the total bandwidth resources while maximizing PU`s profit.
In addition, we make a control decision in a distributed
manner. This distributed approach can reduce the excessive
computation complexity of original VCG mechanism. It is a
highly desirable feature for real-world CR system operations.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can
provides much better system performance than the existing
schemes.

Abstract—In this paper, we analyze the effect of different 
degrees of node cooperation on the performance of routing 
protocols for cognitive radio networks. We first present an 
analytical model of the routing performance in terms of 
expected end-to-end packet delivery ratio (PDR) for cognitive 
radio networks with uncooperative node behaviors. We also 
performed extensive simulations to evaluate the analytical 
model. The simulation results show that Optimal Primary-
Aware Route Quality Protocol (OPERA) could provide better 
PDR 
performance 
under 
higher 
degrees 
of 
network 
cooperation and Shortest Path First routing protocol (SPF) 
works better under lower cooperation degrees. Finally, our 
results suggest that even a modest level of node cooperation is 
sufficient to achieve significant performance improvement with 
respect to the fully non-cooperative network in which all 
secondary users are selfish.  
Keywords- node selfishness; cognitive radio; routing. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The cognitive radio paradigm [1][2] has attracted much 
attention in the research and industrial community in recent 
years. Different from conventional spectrum regulation 
paradigms in which the spectrum is allocated to fixed 
licensed users (or primary users) for exclusive use, a 
cognitive radio system permits unlicensed users (or 
secondary users) to utilize idle spectrum in a dynamic 
manner. In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the secondary 
users (SUs) should sense the spectrum environment, find 
available spectrum channels and utilize them without 
interfering the transmission of primary users (PUs) [3]. 
Communication is opportunistic in CRNs because SUs 
can transmit in the spectrum channels if PUs are not using 
them. Meanwhile, connectivity is intermittent due to the 
unpredictable node mobility. Therefore, to ensure routing 
services, nodes are requested not only to act as packet 
forwarders but also to perform spectrum sensing. That means, 
both energy and computing resources, which are very limited 
in a typical mobile node, have to be sacrificed for the other 
nodes’ good. Hence, some SUs show lower degree of node 
cooperation with a selfish motivation to save their own 
resources [4][5][6]. It will lead to the failure of most existing 
routing protocols. This is because most existing routing 
protocols operate under the assumption that all SUs are fully 
cooperative in the routing operations [6].  
Since routing is the most important network functionality 
in CRNs, in this paper we focus our attention on evaluating 
the impact of node cooperation level on routing performance 
in terms of end-to-end packet delivery ratio (PDR). First, we 
present a theoretical framework for studying the effects of 
different node cooperation levels for proactive routing 
protocols. Then, we perform extensive simulations to 
evaluate the theoretical analysis model. More specifically, 
we consider three common CRN routing protocols, including 
Shortest Path First (SPF) [7], Spectrum Aware Mesh Routing 
Protocol (SAMER) [8], and Optimal Primary-Aware Route 
Quality Protocol (OPERA) [9]. The main findings of this 
evaluation are: i) OPERA has the potential to provide the 
best packet delivery ratio in presence of reduced node 
cooperation levels; and ii) even a modest level of node 
cooperation is sufficient to achieve a considerable 
performance improvement over the fully non-cooperative 
scenarios.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the system model. In Section III, we give the 
analysis framework, and derive the expected Packet Delivery 
Ratio (PDR) of routing under different degrees of 
cooperation. In Section IV, we validate the accuracy of our 
system model by simulation. Finally, we conclude this paper 
in Section V. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
We consider a CRN with a set of SUs, which is denoted 
by V. There exist M primary users, which are indexed by 1, 
2, … , M. Each PU n holds a licensed frequency channel n 
and the probability that PU n is active on its channel is 
denoted by λn. And each PU n has a interference range Rn. A 
SU could utilize channel n, if the SU is not in the 
interference boundary of PU n or PU n is not active. Then, 
the CRN could be modeled as a direct graph: 
 
G(t) = (V, E), 
(1) 
where a vertex vi ∈ V denotes a SU, and an edge eij ∈ E 
denotes the presence of at least one communication link 𝑒!"
! 
from SU vi to SU vj through the channel n:

Considering the uncooperative behaviors we study in this 
paper, we cluster the SUs into two groups respectively 
denoted by V1 and V2, where V1 denote the selfish SUs and 
V2 denote the selfless SUs. Let γ = |V1| / |V| denote selfish 
SU intensity in the CRN where |V1| means the number of 
SUs in V1 and |V| means the total number of nodes in the 
network.  
To model cooperation level of SUs in this paper, we 
define a cooperation value for each SU by the probability 
with which it would forward packets from other SUs. Let ρi 
denote the cooperation value of a SU vi, where vi ∈ V. In this 
paper, we assume that SUs in V2 will always forward packets 
from other nodes. Therefore, for vi ∈ V2, ρi =1. 
III. 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
In this section, we characterize the expected Packet 
Delivery Ratio (PDR) of routing under different degrees of 
cooperation. For mathematical tractability, we only consider 
the routing protocols with which routes are determined in 
proactive manner. Let Di,j denote the event that a packet is 
generated for a source-destination (vi, vj). Denote the route 
determined for the source-destination (vi, vj) by the ordered 
set L = {l1, l2, … , l|L|}, where lk∈ L denote the index of the 
kth SU along the route, l1=i, and l|L|=j. For simplicity, we 
also use lk to denote the SU 𝑣!!. 
In the CRN, whether a packet could be successfully 
delivered to the destination is dependent on the effect of the 
PU, SU mobility and/or SU cooperation level. Therefore, 
we measure the expected end-to-end PDR by explicitly 
accounting for the effect of the relative movement between 
two SUs, the relative movement between SU and PU, and 
the cooperation value of SU. 
A. Packet Delivery Ratio over a Link 
Let 𝐷!! denote the event that a packet sucessfully arrives 
at SU lk. Now we consider the next hop from SU lk to SU 
lk+1. Evaluating the expected PDR over the link from SU lk 
to SU lk+1 is equivalent to computing the conditional 
probability of the event “the packet is sucessfully received 
at SU lk+1”. Given 𝐷!!, then whether the packet could be 
successfully transmitted to SU lk+1 is totally dependent on 
the state of the communication link between SU lk to SU 
lk+1. If the link is connected and not affected by PU activity, 
then the packet could be transmitted to SU lk+1. But whether 
SU lk+1 would like to accept the packet and forward it to the 
next hop is totally dependent on its cooperation value. 
We denote the probability that the link between SU lk 
and SU lk+1 being connected by αk,k+1. The calculation of 
αk,k+1 is similar to that in wireless networks, which has been 
extensively studied by considering the relative movement 
between two mobile nodes. In this paper, we adopt the 
approach introduced in [10] to calculate αk,k+1. Since the 
calculation procedure is complex, we do not give an explicit 
expression of αk,k+1. Please refer to [10] to learn more.  
Let 𝛿!
! denote the probability that a SU lk enters into the 
 
interference boundary of PU n. A SU entering into the 
interference boundary of a PU means that the relative 
distance between the SU and the PU is less than the 
interference range of the PU. Similarly to the calculation of 
αk,k+1, we can obtain the probability 𝛿!
!. The activity of PU 
n can interfere with the communications between SU lk and 
SU lk+1 if either SU lk or SU lk+1 enters into the interference 
boundary of PU n. We use 𝛿!,!!!
!
 to denote the probablity 
that the activity of PU n can interfere with the 
communications between SU lk and SU lk+1. Then, the 
probability 𝛿!,!!!
!
 can be calculated by: 
 
. 
(2) 
Channel n is not available for communication between SU lk 
and SU lk+1, if the activity of PU n can interfere with the 
communications between them and PU is active on channel 
n. We use spectrum availability 𝛽!,!!!
!
to denote the 
probability that channel n is available for communication 
link between SU lk and SU lk+1 to use. Therefore, spectrum 
availability  𝛽!,!!!
!
could be given as: 
 
, 
(3) 
where, 𝛿!,!!!
!
 is given in (2), and λn is the activity 
probablity of PU n on channel n. And if no channel is 
avaialble for communication between SU lk and SU lk+1, 
then the transmission would be blocked. Let 𝛽!,!!! denote 
the block probability due to spectrum unavailability. Then, 
the block probability 𝛽!,!!! can be calculated by: 
 
. 
(4) 
For simplicity, we assume that the relative movement 
between SU lk to SU lk+1, the spectrum availability and the 
cooperative levels of SU lk+1 are independent. Therefore, the 
expected packet delivery ratio over a link from SU lk to SU 
lk+1 is given by (5), where  𝜌!!!! is the cooperation value of 
SU lk+1.  
Remark. The expected packet delivery ratio (5) allows us to 
estimate the packet delivery ratio sent over a link by 
accounting for three main factors that affect the 
transmission of this link: (1) the SU movement, via the 
probability αk,k+1; (2) the PU characteristics, via the 
probability 𝛽!,!!!; (3) the cooperation level of next hop, via 
cooperation value 𝜌!!!!. Notice that at the last hop, since the 
receiver of the last hop is the destination, it will always be 
willing to receive the packet. From (5), we can notice that 
the smaller is  𝜌!!!!, the smaller is the packet delivery ratio. 
Thus, the coopeartion value of the SUs should be considered 
into the route selection.

B. End-to-End Packet Delivery Ratio 
Based on the aforementioned work, we now derive the 
analytical expression of end-to-end packet delivery ratio. 
Evaluating the end-to-end PDR for the source-destination 
(vi, vj) is equivalent to computing the probability of the 
event “a packet generated at an SU vi is successfully 
delivered to destination vj”. Thus, we have 
 
 
. 
(6) 
Then the expected end-to-end delay over the whole 
network is calculated as: 
 
, 
(7) 
where P(Di,j) is the probability that a message is generated 
for the source-destination (vi, vj). It could be estimated 
based on the number of packets generated between vi and 
vj in the past. In this paper, we assume that the source-
destination pairs are randomly selected among all SUs. 
Then, P(Di,j) = 1/|V|(|V|-1).  
IV. 
MODEL VALIDATION 
In this section, we evaluate our analysis by comparing 
the theoretical results obtained based on our model with 
the simulation results, which are obtained by simulating 
the packet dissemination under three different routing 
protocols for CRNs (i.e., SPF, SAMER, and OPERA) with 
different cooperation levels.  
A. Simulaiton Setting 
In our simulation, the network topology consists of 50 
SUs randomly distributed in a square area of the side of 
500 m. All the SUs are mobile and follow the random 
walk mobility (RWM) model [11], in which each SU’s 
movement consists of a sequence of random length 
intervals called mobility epochs. During an epoch, a SU 
moves in a constant direction at a constant speed. The 
speed and direction of mobile during each epoch is 
uniformly distributed over (0, 20m/s) and (0, 2π) 
respectively. The transmission ranges of SUs are set to be 
30m. 
In the simulated area, there are 10 PUs and each PU 
possesses a licensed channel. Each channel n is utilized by 
a PU with a probability λn∈ [0.05, 0.95]. And the 
interference ranges of PUs are all set to be 50m.   
We vary the selfish SU intensity γ from 0.0 to 1.0 with 
step of 0.1. We will also vary the cooperation value ρi of 
selfish SUs with two different values: 0 and 0.5. For each 
value of γ and ρi, we run the simulation for 1000 times. 
B. Simulation Results 
Simulation results are shown as below. Figure 1 shows 
the expected end-to-end packet delivery ratio vs. γ for SPF 
protocol with values of γ from 0.0 to 1.0. Figure 2 shows 
the results for SAMER protocol and Figure 3 shows the 
results for OPERA protocol.

From the results, we first note that there is a very good 
agreement between the theoretical and the experimental 
results for two different cooperation values under SPF, 
SAMER and OPERA protocols.

Second, we could find that for all three protocols, the 
expected end-to-end PDR decreases as the number of 
selfish nodes increases. Thus, to provide efficient routing 
performance for CRNs, it is necessary to incorporate 
selfish node detection mechanisms into routing protocol.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  End-to-end PDR with OPERA routing v.s. selfish user 
intensity. 
Moreover, through comparison between results of 
different routing protocols, we can find that OPERA is 
able to provide the best packet delivery ratio in cases with 
higher cooperative level (lower selfish SU intensity γ and 
higher cooperation value). But when the selfish SU 
intensity γ increase to almost 1 and the cooperation value 
becomes 0, SPF protocol performs better than OPERA. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  End-to-end PDR with OPERA routing v.s. coperation value.  
We also give the results for SPF protocol with different 
values of  ρi from 0.0 to 1.0 in Figure 4. From Figure 4, 
we also find that a modest level of increase in node 
cooperation is sufficient to achieve a considerable 
performance improvement in packet delivery ratio. Thus, 
it is essential to enhance the cooperation willingness of 
SUs in order to provide efficient routing performance, 
such as introduce some reward-and-penalty mechanism. 
V. 
CONCLUSISON 
In this paper, we characterized the performance of 
proactive routing protocols for CRNs under different 
levels of node cooperation. We also perform extensive 
simulations to validate our analysis. The simulation 
results give some insights into future routing protocol 
designs for CRNs, such as incorporate selfish node 
detection 
mechanisms 
and 
reward-and-penalty 
mechanism into routing protocols. In the future work, we 
will focus on applying our conclusions to CRNs.

Abstract—In cognitive radio network, cognitive radios should
operate with a small battery. Operation schedule for cognitive
radio user (CU) strongly affects performance of a device with a
ﬁnite capacity battery. An energy harvester that harvests energy
from the environment to recharge the battery can be utilized to
extend the lifetime of the CU. While the CU consumes a similar
energy for sensing and transmitting data in all active slots, its
reward (i.e., throughput) may not be the same because of different
data trafﬁc (i.e., the amount of data that needs to be transmitted).
Therefore, in order to maximize performance of the cognitive
radio network, the CU needs to consider the current data trafﬁc
to determine its optimal action policy in terms of sleeping or
active. In this paper, we formulate the problem of choosing an
action by the CU by using a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) in which the CU’s three states in terms of data
trafﬁc, belief and remaining energy are utilized as main factors
to decide an optimal action of the CU in current time slot, and
the effect of current action to future reward will be considered
through POMDP. Simulation results prove the efﬁciency of the
proposed scheme.
Keywords—cognitive radio; energy harvesting; energy efﬁciency;
optimal action policy; POMDP.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cognitive radio (CR) technology can improve spectrum
utilization by allowing cognitive radio users (CU) to share
the frequency assigned to a licensed user, called the primary
user (PU). In order to avoid interference with the operation of
the licensed user, the CU is allowed to be active only when
the frequency is free. Otherwise, when the presence of the PU
is detected, the CU has to vacate their occupied frequency.
In the CR network, the CU often has a small battery that
can maintain operations of the CU in a short time. Therefore,
the performance of the CR network strongly depends on how
effectively the CU uses its electric power. The problem of
optimal energy management has been considered previously
in [1], [2] where an optimal energy management scheme for a
sensor node with an energy harvester to maximize throughput
was proposed. In [3], [4], a scheme to ﬁnd an optimal action
policy including sleeping to save energy or active to take
opportunity of transmitting data is proposed. Due to the
energy-constrained of the CU, the proposed scheme applies
the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)
[5], [6] to determine that optimal action policy.
In most of the previous works, data trafﬁc (i.e., the amount
of data that needs to be transmitted) was not considered in
order to decide the optimal action for energy efﬁciency. It
is often assumed that the CU always has data to transmit.
However, this assumption may be not real in practice. For
example, in wireless sensor network, in order to save energy,
only the change of data (e.g., the change of monitoring envi-
ronment) is tracked and reported. In this case, the data trafﬁc
varies in time. Therefore, the performance of CR network can
be strongly affected by the data trafﬁc. In order to maximize
performance of the cognitive radio network, the CU needs to
consider the current data trafﬁc to determine its optimal action
policy in terms of sleeping or active. In sleeping mode, the CU
is silent and waits until the next time slot for another action
round. In active mode, the CU ﬁrst determines the status of
the PU signal, if the PU signal is absent, the CU is allowed
to access the considered channel to transmit data. If the CU
wants to switch to active mode, it must have enough energy
for all operations of the mode (i.e., spectrum sensing and data
transmitting). In both sleeping and active mode, the CU can
harvest energy from the environment to recharge the battery.
In this paper, we formulate the problem of choosing an
action by the CU by using a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) in which the CU’s three states in
terms of data trafﬁc, belief and remaining energy are utilized as
main factors to decide an optimal action of the CU in current
time slot, and the effect of current action to future reward
will be considered through POMDP. It is expected that the
proposed scheme based on POMDP theory will provide the
CR system an improved performance.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
the system model that we consider in the paper. Section 3
details the proposed optimal action decision scheme based
on POMDP. Section 4 introduces simulation models and
simulation results of the proposed scheme. Finally, Section
5 concludes this paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a CR network and a PU that is assumed
to operate in a time slotted model. The status of the PU
changes between two states of the Markov chain model, that
is, Presence (P) and Absence (A) as shown in Figure 1.
The transition probability of the PU from state P to state
A and from state A to itself are deﬁned as PP A and PAA,
respectively.
The data that needs to be transmitted is stored in a data
buffer of the CU; the amount of data D in the buffer is deﬁned
as data trafﬁc of the CU. The buffer can store maximum Bmax
units of data. At the time t, data trafﬁc of the CU can be
deﬁned as,

where 0 ≤ c1 < c2 < ... < cξd ≤ Bmax and ξd is the number
of possible states of data trafﬁc.

PMF in (3) can be equivalent to:
Pdin (k) ≈ e−din

decision policy in terms of sleeping or active is formulated
as the framework of POMDP. For POMDP, we deﬁne the
value function V (D, p, er) as the maximum total discounted
throughput from the current time slot when the current state
of the CU is S(k) = {D(k), p(k), er(k)} where D(k), p(k)
and er(k) are data trafﬁc, belief and the remaining energy at
the beginning of the kth time slot. The value function is given
by:

CU achieved at the tth time slot, which is mainly dependent
on state S(t) and action decision a(t).

If the CU decides to remain sleeping, no throughput is
achieved, then R (S(t), S |φ1 ) = 0.
State S(t + 1) = {D(t + 1), p(t + 1), er(t + 1)} of the CU

The remaining energy of the CU for the next time slot can
be updated similar to the case of observation φ3.
According to those observations, the value function in (10)
can be expressed as (30). In order to ﬁnd an optimal mode
policy for maximizing throughput, the optimization problem
in (30) will be solved by using the value iterations method
[8].
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we present simulation results to prove the
efﬁciency of the proposed scheme. Myopic scheme only con-
siders the current time slot for the value function (i.e., α = 0)
to decide the CU’s action. This means that unless the CU has
not enough energy for spectrum sensing and data transmitting
or there is no data in the data buffer, Myopic scheme will
always allow the CU to be active. Simulation results of Myopic
will be provided for reference. The parameters for simulations
are shown in Table I.

Fig. 2. Reward versus battery capacity Emax.
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed
scheme, we deﬁne Reward of the CU as the average number
of units of data successfully transmitted in each time slot.
Figure 2 shows the Reward of the considered schemes
according to the capacity of the CU battery Emax. It can
be seen that the increase of battery capacity may help the
CU achieve higher Reward. However, when the battery is big
enough (i.e., it has enough space to store all harvested energy),
the increase of battery will not affect the Reward.
Figure 3 presents the relation between Reward and harvested
energy eh of the CU. Higher amount of eh provide more
energy for active mode of the CU, so that the CU can get
more Reward. However, when eh is high enough for active
mode of the CU in all time, eh has no more effect on the CU’s
Reward. In this case, the energy constraint will disappear; and
then the action of the proposed scheme and Myopic scheme
will be the same. That is the reason why they have the same
performance when the harvested energy is high.
Transmission energy et may give strong effect to the Reward
of the proposed scheme, as shown in Figure 4. More energy is
consumed by transmitting data, less Reward the CU achieves.
Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the Reward according to the
change of maximum transmission capacity smax of the CU
(i.e., the maximum amount of data that the CU can transmit
in whole duration of a time slot) and the change of SNR
in the sensing channel, respectively. These ﬁgures show that
better transmission capacity or better SNR will improve the
performance of the proposed scheme.
The simulations results shown in all ﬁgures prove that the
proposed scheme can offer the CU better performance than
the conventional Myopic scheme. That beneﬁt of the proposed
scheme is achieved by considering future Reward on deciding
current action.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a scheme to decide an optimal
action to maximize Reward of the CU on energy-constrained
and uncertainty data trafﬁc manner. By focusing on uncertainty
data trafﬁc, the proposed scheme is more practical than in
the previous studies. On the other hand, the proposed scheme
can take consideration into the effect of the future Reward
on current action of the CU by applying POMDP theory.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can obtain
better performance than conventional Myopic scheme.

Abstract—In cognitive radio (CR) networks, the knowledge
of primary user (PU) trafﬁc plays a crucial role in designing
the sensing slot duration and synchronization with PU trafﬁc.
However, the secondary user (SU) sensing unit usually does not
have the knowledge of the exact time slot structure in the primary
network. Moreover, it is also possible that the communication
among PUs are not based on synchronous schemes at all. In
this paper, the effect of unknown primary user (PU) trafﬁc on
the performance of multi-antenna spectrum sensing is evaluated
under a ﬂat fading channel. In contrast to the commonly used
continuous time Markov model of the existing literature, a
realistic and simple PU trafﬁc model is proposed which is based
only on the discrete time distribution of PU free and busy periods.
Furthermore, in order to assess the effect of PU trafﬁc on the
detection performance, analytical expressions for the probability
density functions of the decision statistic are derived considering
Energy Detection (ED) test as spectrum sensing method. It is
shown that the time varying PU trafﬁc severely affects the
spectrum sensing performance. Most importantly, our results
show that the performance gain due to multiple antennas in the
sensing unit is signiﬁcantly reduced by the effect of PU trafﬁc
when the mean lengths of free and busy periods are of the same
order of magnitude of the sensing slot.

I. INTRODUCTION
By accessing the unoccupied spectrum of licensed band,
cognitive radio (CR) based dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS)
is initially intended to alleviate the most challenging problems
of future wireless communications, namely, spectrum scarcity.
With real-time perception of surroundings and bandwidth
availability and with the help of spectrum sensing functionality
of CR, secondary users (unlicensed users) may dynamically
use the vacant spectrum and perform opportunistic transmis-
sions, by adapting the functionality intelligently to accommo-
date current wireless environments [1]. Thus, the domain of
spectrum sensing techniques has long been investigated by
many researchers: a detailed bibliography of the contributions
in this area can be found in [2], [3]. Despite the signiﬁcant
volume of available literature on spectrum sensing under
ideal scenarios, investigation under practical constraints and
imperfections are still lacking [3]. Thus, recent research efforts
are devoted to improve the accuracy and efﬁciency of sensing
techniques under practical constraints and imperfections.
Currently, most of the existing research on cognitive radio
spectrum sensing has been conducted based on the assumption
that SUs are perfectly synchronized with PUs, thus providing
a solid basis for guaranteeing that PU trafﬁc transitions occur
only at the beginning of the SU sensing frames. However,
the SUs may not have the knowledge of the exact time
slot structure in the primary network. Moreover, it is also
possible that the communications among PUs are not based
on synchronous schemes at all [5], [6]. Thus, under practical
scenarios, the primary trafﬁc transition may occur during the
sensing period, especially when a long sensing period is used
to achieve a good sensing performance, or when spectrum
sensing is performed for a network with high trafﬁc load.
Among a limited number of literature including [9]–[14]
that deal with unknown primary trafﬁc scenario, [9] was the
ﬁrst one to study the performance of well known semi-blind
spectrum sensing algorithms including Energy Detection (ED)
and Roy’s Largest Root Test (RLRT) under bursty primary
trafﬁc, in which the burst interval is comparable to or smaller
than the spectrum sensing interval. The trafﬁc model used
is limited to constant length bursts of the PU data, whose
length is smaller than the SU sensing duration. However, the
burst length of the PU may be varying with time following
some stochastic models [7], [8]. A more general scenario, in
which the PUs trafﬁc transition is completely random, may
affect the spectrum sensing performance. The analysis of the
spectrum sensing performance has been presented in [11]–[14]
by modeling the PU trafﬁc as an independent and identically
distributed two state Markov’s model. Using this primary traf-
ﬁc model, authors in [11], [13], [14] analyzed the effect of PU
trafﬁc on the sensing performance and the sensing-throughput
trade-off considering ED as a sensing technique under the half
duplex scenario. Moreover, the effect of multiple PUs trafﬁc
on the sensing-throughput trade-off of the secondary system
has been studied in [12]. Although all the aforementioned
contributions recognized the fact that the PU trafﬁc might
affect the sensing performance including sensing-throughput
trade-off, none of them considered the realistic scenario of
multi-antenna spectrum sensing in a complex signal sample
domain.
In this paper, the effect of PU trafﬁc on the performance
of multi-antenna spectrum sensing is evaluated under the
complex domain of PU signal, noise and channel considering
ED as a sensing technique. In contrast to the commonly used
continuous time Markov model in the existing literature, a
15

novel technique of modeling PU trafﬁc is proposed which is
only based on the discrete time distribution of PU free and
busy periods. The proposed model is more realistic and simple
compared to the continuous time Markov model proposed
in the previous literature [11]–[14]. Moreover, an analytical
performance evaluation of the decision statistic under the
considered scenario is carried out. It is shown that the time
varying PU trafﬁc severely affects the performance of ED.
More importantly, it is shown that the performance gain
due to multiple antennas in the sensing unit is signiﬁcantly
suppressed by the effect of PU trafﬁc when the mean lengths
of free and busy periods are small.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: A system
model is presented in Section II. Simple characterization of
the PU trafﬁc model is described in Section III. The sensing
performance is derived in Section IV. The simulation results
are discussed in Section V and ﬁnally, the conclusion in
Section VI.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a scenario where multiple antennas are em-
ployed by an SU. Suppose the SU has K antennas and each
antenna receives N samples in each sensing slot. We focus on
a single source scenario (single primary transmitter), which
is of particular interest in many detection problems in CRNs.
In a given sensing frame, the detector calculates its decision
statistic TD by collecting N samples from each one of the K
antennas. Subsequently, the received samples are stored by the
detector in the K × N matrix Y .
As described in Section I, when the primary transmissions
are not based on some synchronous schemes or the sensing
unit at the SU does not have any information about the
primary trafﬁc structure, the received vector at the sensing
unit may consist of partly the samples from one PU state and
the remaining from alternate PU state as shown in Figure
1. To simplify the scenario, we begin with the following
classiﬁcation of the sensing slots based on the PU trafﬁc status,
1) Steady State (SS) sensing slot: In such type of sensing
slot, all the received samples in one sensing slot are
obtained from the same PU state.
2) Transient State (TS) sensing slot: In such type of sensing
slot, a part of the received samples within the sensing
slot are obtained from one PU state and the remaining
from the next PU state.
In general, the probabilities of receiving SS and TS sensing
slots are dependent on the PUs trafﬁc model. At the end of the
sensing interval, based on the received samples, the detector
must distinguish between null and alternate hypothesis.
H0: the channel is going to be free,
H1: the channel is going to be busy.
This hypothesis formulation implies that in a TS sensing
slot, a transition from the PU busy state to the PU free state
is considered H0, while a transition from the PU free state to
the PU busy state is considered H1.
In the considered scenario, in an SS sensing interval, the
generic received signal matrix under each hypothesis can be
written as,
YSS =

V
(H0),
hs + V
(H1),
(1)
where V
≜ [v(1) · · · v(n) · · · v(N)] is the K × N noise
matrix , h
=
[h1 · · · hK]T
is the channel vector and
s ≜ [s(1) · · · s(n) · · · s(N)] is a 1 × N signal vector.
And in the TS sensing interval, the generic received signal
matrix under each hypothesis can be written as,
YT S =

hsN−D0 + V
(H0),
hsD1 + V
(H1),
(2)
where D0 represents the number of pure noise samples
in TS sensing slot under H0, D1 represents the number of
noise plus PU signal samples in TS sensing slot under H1,
sD0 ≜ [s1×(N−D0)|01×D0] with s1×(N−D0) a 1 × (N − D0)
signal vector and 01×D0 a 1 × D0 zero vector. Similarly,
sD1 ≜ [01×(N−D1)|s1×(D1)] with 01×(N−D1) a 1×(N −D1)
zero vector and s1×D1 a 1×D1 signal vector. In each of these,
the unknown primary transmitted signal s(n) at time instant
n is modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
complex Gaussian with zero mean and variance σ2
s : s(n) ∼
NC(0, σ2
s). The noise sample vk(n) at the kth antenna of the
SU at the time instant n is also modeled as complex Gaussian
with mean zero and variance σ2
v : vk(n) ∼ NC(0, σ2
v). The
channel coefﬁcient hk of kth antenna is assumed to be constant
and memory-less during the sensing interval.
III. CHARACTERIZATION OF PRIMARY USER TRAFFIC
In this paper, the PU trafﬁc is modeled as an i.i.d. on-
off random process with geometrically distributed busy and
free periods. To be in-line with the binary hypothesis testing
of a spectrum sensing problem, a two state on-off modeling
of the PU trafﬁc is rather realistic especially when we are
more concerned only about if the PU is transmitting or not.
Furthermore, we are actually dealing with the discrete set of
samples with a ﬁxed sensing interval, thus the geometrically
distributed busy and free periods are perfectly relevant in our
considered scenario.
Let Nb be the geometrically distributed random variable
denoting the number of consecutive busy samples with a
parameter pb. Similarly, let Nf be another identical and in-
dependent geometrically distributed random variable denoting
the number of consecutive free samples with a parameter pf.
Then, the probability mass function (pmf) for each of them
can be written as,
fNb(Nb = nb) = (1 − pb)nb−1pb,
for nb = 1, 2, .., ∞
(3)
fNf (Nf = nf) = (1 − pf)nf −1pf,
for nf = 1, 2, .., ∞
(4)
In the TS sensing slot, depending on the length of the free
period or the busy period, the PU state can change anywhere
within the sensing slot resulting the random variables (RVs)
D0 and D1. For instance, suppose the PU is previously in

Fig. 1. Primary user trafﬁc scenario and sensing slot classiﬁcation
the busy state. The PU state transition from busy to the free
state may occur anywhere, let’s say after (N − D0) samples
within the sensing slot. Thus, in each PU state transition from
busy state to free state, the sensing unit has to decide based
on D0 pure noise samples and (N − D0) noise plus primary
signal samples, which actually affects the overall sensing
performance. The following Lemmas compute the pmfs of
D0 and D1 respectively, based on the distribution of the busy
period Nb, free period Nf and the sensing length N.
Lemma 1. Given the number of samples in a sensing duration
N, the length of PU busy period Nb distributed as in (4), the
probability of having D0 noise only (PU signal free) samples
in a TS sensing slot under H0 is given by,
PD0(D0 = d0)|H0 = pb(1 − pb)N−d0−1
1 − (1 − pb)N
.
(5)
Proof. As mentioned earlier during binary hypothesis formu-
lation, the PU state transition from busy state to the free state
corresponds to H0 sensing slot. We consider thus, without loss
of generality, while dealing TS sensing slot under H0, PU state
transition from busy to free state depends only on PU busy
period Nb. Thus, for given Nb, the additional number of noise
only samples D0 which is required to complete a TS sensing
slot under H0 is given by,
D0 =
Nb
N

N − Nb.
(6)
Using the pmf of Nb, the probability of D0 can be written
as,
PD0 = pb(1 − pb)aN−D0−1,
(7)
where a =
l
Nf
N
m
. Now, from (6) and (7), it is clear that D0
can be obtained from many different values of Nb. To be more
precise, we obtain D0 for all Nb such that Nb = aN − D0.
Thus, in order to evaluate the pmf of D0, we need to sum
the probability of occurrence of all the instances of Nb, i.e.,
Nb = aN − D0, obtaining
PD0(D0 = d0) =
+∞
X
a=1
pb(1 − pb)aN−d0−1.
(8)
After some algebra and the truncation of inﬁnite sum of
geometric series, we obtain the pmf of D0 as in (5).
Lemma 2. Given the number of samples in a sensing duration
N, the length of PU free period Nf distributed as in (3), the
probability of having D1 noise plus primary signal samples in
a TS sensing slot under H1 is given by,
PD1(D1 = d1)|H1 = pf(1 − pf)N−d1−1
1 − (1 − pf)N
(9)
Proof. Using the same line of reasoning as in the proof of
Lemma 1, the proof of Lemma 2 is straightforward.
As depicted from (1) and (2), to ﬁnd the distribution of the
decision statistic under different hypotheses, the prior deduc-
tion of the chances of occurrence of SS sensing interval, TS
sensing interval, pmf of D0 and pmf of D1 is inevitable. The
following proposition computes the probability of occurrence
of SS sensing slot pSS|H0 under H0 and the probability of
occurrence of TS sensing slot is normally the complementary
of pSS|H0, i.e., pT S|H0 = 1 − pSS|H0.
Proposition 1. Given the sample length of a sensing interval
N, the length of PU free period Nf distributed as in (3), the
probability of receiving SS sensing slot under H0 is given by,
pSS|H0 =
P+∞
s0=0 s0P(s0)
P+∞
s0=0(s0 + 1)P(s0),
(10)
where P(s0) =

(1 − pf)s0N−1 − (1 − pf)N(s0+1)−1
.
Proof. Under H0, the probability of receiving s0 number of
SS sensing slot is given by,
P(s0) = P(s0N ≤ Nf < (s0 + 1)N)
= FNf (N(s0 + 1) − 1) − FNF (Ns0 − 1)
=
h
(1 − pf)s0N−1 − (1 − pf)N(s0+1)−1i
,

where FNf (·) denotes the Cumulative Distribution Function
(CDF) of Nf.
For each free period Nf, there occurs one TS sensing slot

period N. Thus, the probability of receiving an SS sensing
slot can be written as the ratio of the average number of SS
sensing slot that can be received for a given distribution of
Nf to the total number of sensing slots under consideration,
pSS|H0 =

Since the second summation in the denominator of (12)
is negligibly small compared to the ﬁrst summation, we can
neglect this summation leading to (10).
The following proposition computes the probability of
occurrence of SS sensing slot pSS|H1 under H1 and the
probability of occurrence of TS sensing slot is normally the
complementary of pSS|H1, i.e., pT S|H1 = 1 − pSS|H1.
Proposition 2. Given the sample length of a sensing interval
N, the length of PU busy period Nb distributed as in (4), the
probability of receiving SS sensing slot under H1 is given by,
pSS|H1 =
P+∞
s1=0 s1P(s1)
P+∞
s1=0(s1 + 1)P(s1),
(13)
where P(s1) =

(1 − pb)s1N−1 − (1 − pb)N(s1+1)−1
.
Proof. Using the same line of reasoning as in the proof of
Proposition 1, the proof of Proposition 2 is straightforward.

To analyze ED performance, it is necessary to express the
probability density function (pdf) of the decision statistic
in case of unknown primary trafﬁc. The following theorem
computes the pdf of the ED decision statistic under both the
hypotheses using the PU trafﬁc characterization presented in
Section III.
Theorem 1. Given a multi-antenna sensing unit with K
receiving antennas, N received samples in each slot and the
random PU trafﬁc with geometrically distributed free state
duration, the pdf of the ED decision statistic under H0 and H1
is given by (15) and (16) (shown at the top of the next page),
respectively, where fG(x, α, β) is a pdf of Gamma distribution
with shape parameter α & rate parameter β and fN (x, µ, σ2)
is the pdf of Gaussian distribution with mean µ and variance
σ2.
Proof. As noted from Section II, the term within the summa-
tion in (14) is different for the SS sensing slot and TS sensing
slot. Under the null hypothesis H0, the ED decision statistic
in (14) can be decomposed as a probabilistic sum of T SS
ED|H0
and T T S
ED|H0.

with a shape parameter α and a rate parameter β. Since the
goal is to ﬁnd the pdf of the sum in (14) under H0, we
replace the random variables in (19) with their respective pdfs
to obtain (15).
In the similar manner, under the alternate hypothesis H1,
the ED decision statistic in (14) can be decomposed as a
probabilistic sum of T SS

(16)
Finally, we replace the random variables in (22) with their
respective pdfs to obtain (16).
In essence, the pdfs in (15) and (16) consist of the sum
of independent random variables. From a statistical point of
view, the sum of two independent pdfs can be realized as
a convolution of these pdfs [16]. Thus, the sum of pdfs
can be computed using convolution or as an alternative, we
can exploit the characteristic function approach by computing
Fourier transform. In conclusion, (15) and (16) can be easily
evaluated by using standard Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
techniques.
A. Probability of False Alarm: Given the pdf of the decision
statistic in (15), we can compute the false-alarm probability.
Under H0, the PU is in free state at the end of the sensing
interval, but the decision statistic is erroneously above the
threshold τ and the PU signal is declared present. For deﬁning
the probability of false-alarm PF in our case, the following
Corollary of Theorem 1 holds.
Corollary 1. The false-alarm probability of the ED test under
unknown PU trafﬁc and complex signal space scenario is:
PF = P(TED|H0 ≥ τ) ≡
Z +∞
τ
fTED|H0 (x)dx.
(23)
B. Probability of Detection: Given the pdf of the decision
statistic in (16), we can compute the detection probability.
Under H1, i.e., the PU is in busy state at the end of the sensing
interval. Under this scenario, if the decision statistic is above
the threshold, the PU signal is declared present. The following
Corollary of Theorem 1 holds for deﬁning the probability of
detection PD.
Corollary 2. The detection probability of the ED test under
unknown PU trafﬁc and the complex signal space scenario is:
PD = P(TED|H1 ≥ τ) ≡
Z +∞
τ
fTED|H1 (x)dx.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, the effect of PU trafﬁc on the multi-antenna
ED is analyzed based on the the trafﬁc model developed in
Section II. The length of the free and busy periods of the
PU trafﬁc are measured in terms of the discrete number of
samples where each of them has Geometric distribution with
probability of success parameters pf and pb, respectively. In
this section, more often we use mean and busy period denoting

the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) performance of
the ED for different values of the mean free and busy period of
the PU trafﬁc. It shows that as the mean free and busy periods
of the primary trafﬁc increases, the detection performance
of SU also increases. The conventional model with perfect
synchronization of the PU-SU sensing slots performs better
than the one with unknown PU trafﬁc.
The variation of the sensing performance of the detector for
different number of receiving antennas is plotted in Figure 4.
It can be observed that unlike the rapid increase in sensing
performance with the increasing number of receiving anten-
nas under synchronized PU-SU sensing slot scenario (rapid
decrease in missed-detection probability with the increasing
number of receiving antennas), the sensing performance is
almost constant even if we increase the number of antennas
under unknown PU trafﬁc. During a TS sensing slot, from
each receiving antenna, the received signal samples are the
mixture of pure noise samples and the samples with both noise
and PU signal. Thus, even if we use multiple antennas, the
nature of the received signal doesn’t change much which is
the reason the sensing performance improvement is suppressed
by the unknown PU trafﬁc (more speciﬁcally, the TS sensing
performance) when the length of the free and busy periods of
PU trafﬁc are quite small (a few multiples of the length of the
sensing window).
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the effect of PU trafﬁc on the performance
of multi-antenna Energy Detector has been studied under a
ﬂat fading channel. A realistic and simple PU trafﬁc model
has been considered which is based only on the discrete
time distribution of PU free and busy periods. Moreover,
an analytical evaluation of the spectrum sensing performance
under the considered scenario has been carried out. It has been
shown that the performance gain due to multiple antenna in
the sensing unit is signiﬁcantly reduced by the effect of PU
trafﬁc when the mean lengths of free and busy periods are
small (in the range of a few multiples of the sensing period).

Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the use of repetition coding
(RC) in conjunction with code division multiple access (CDMA)
spread spectrum (SS), as a means to spread the signal power of a
secondary (cognitive) underlay system, operating at the same time
and on the same frequency band with a primary system. First, we
consider single user (SU) systems, where we ﬁnd the bit error rate
(BER) at the secondary receiver (SR), satisfying a given quality
of service (QoS) requirement for the primary system. Then, we
ﬁnd the maximum coding rate required to satisfy the QoS of both
systems. Also, we investigate the combination of RC and SS in
multiuser (MU) systems, where SS is used as a means to separate
the signals from each others. Simulation results show that, using
RC with low coding rate, can maintain the interference level
at the primary receiver (PR) below the maximum allowed level,
while, at the same time, improving the BER performance of the
secondary system. Furthermore, the largest coding rate required
to satisfy both systems’ QoS grows fast, as the transmit power of
the primary system gets larger than the minimum value for the
secondary system to operate. Finally, it is shown that, in some
cases, dividing the bandwidth between RC and SS is a better
option than allocating the whole bandwidth to SS only.

INTRODUCTION
Future wireless communication systems will require ever
increased data rate (or equivalently, bandwidth), required by
the demanding multimedia applications. This is challenging
as most of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum is licensed
to primary users. However, close investigations reveal that,
the EM spectrum can be utilized more efﬁciently, by making
the transmissions’ parameters adaptable to the surrounding
environment, as well as to the users’ demands [1]–[4].
These ﬁndings have triggered huge research activities on
developing techniques on how to access the spectrum more
efﬁciently, resulting in the so-called dynamic spectrum access
(DSA) techniques. In the literature, two models of DSA are
mainly studied: interweave and underlay models [5]. In the
interweave model, a cognitive secondary unlicensed system
uses only the white spaces, i.e., the portions of the spectrum
that are not currently utilized by the primary system, to whom
the spectrum is licensed, and hence has priority in using it.
This model, however, involves detection and tracking of the
white spaces, which are complex to implement, and could
lead to false detection. As a consequence, the quality of
service (QoS) of the primary system is sometimes jeopardized,
or white spaces can be gone unused by ready-to transmit
secondary users. Furthermore, the required white spaces are
not guaranteed to be found at the time a secondary system
is ready to transmit. On the other hand, in underlay model,
which is our focus, there are no temporal or spatial constraints,
but there are interference power constraints imposed by the
primary users, which has to be maintained below a given noise
ﬂoor, in order to maintain a given QoS. These interference
constraints can be met in one of two ways: using beamforming
in multiple antenna systems by focusing the signal power
toward the secondary receivers, and away from the primary
receivers, or spreading the signal power over large bandwidth,
to decrease the interference level within the primary users’
bandwidth of interest [5].
In this paper, our focus is on the underlay model, where
we investigate the usage of repetition codes (RC) as a means
to spread the signal power, with possibly spread spectrum (SS)
techniques for multiuser systems, i.e., code division multiple
access (CDMA) [6]. In particular, we consider a secondary
system operating at the same time and on the same frequency
band with a primary system. First, we consider single user
(SU) systems, and we set a QoS limit on the primary system
in terms of the largest bit error rate (BER) allowed at the
primary receiver (PR), and derive the BER performance at the
secondary receiver (SR) for different coding rates. Then, we
set a QoS requirement at the secondary system in terms of the
maximum BER tolerable at the SR for a satisfying service,
and ﬁnd the maximum coding rate required to satisfy the QoS
of both systems. We then consider multiuser (MU) systems,
where the primary system uses orthogonal spreading codes
such as Walsh-Hadamard (WH) codes [7], where the cross-
correlation between the spreading codes is zero, as a means to
spread and separate the primary signals, while the secondary
system uses a combination of RC and WH codes to spread
and distinguish the secondary signals. Simulation results show
that RC with low coding rate can be used as a simple means
to spread the signal power to satisfy the QoS of both the
primary and secondary systems. Furthermore, in MU systems,
it is shown that, in some cases, dividing the total available
bandwidth between RC and SS is a better option in terms of
BER at SRs than allocating the whole available bandwidth to
SS only.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the above proposed
systems haven’t been considered in the literature. The rest of
the paper is organized as follows: In Section II, the system and
channel model are presented, in Section III, the performances

of SU and MU systems are investigated, in Section IV, simula-
tion results are presented and discussed, and ﬁnally in Section
V, a conclusion is provided.
II.
SYSTEM MODEL
A. SU Systems
First, we consider a secondary (cognitive) system consist-
ing of one secondary transmitter (ST) and one SR, which
operates at the same time and over the same frequency band as
a primary system consisting of one primary transmitter (PT)
and one PR. All channels are assumed to be additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, where the additive noise at
the front-end receivers is assumed to have a single-sided power
spectral density (PSD) N0 Watts/Hz, and both systems use
binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation with the same
bit rate Rb bits/sesond, and thus both systems have the same
baseband bandwidth, W = Rb Hz, where rectangular pulse
shaping is assumed, and null-to-null bandwidth is considered.
Both systems are assumed to be synchronous. The power
received at the front-end receivers is noted to be P from the PT
and S from the ST. The QoS of the primary system is protected
by setting a maximum BER value τp allowable at the PR. This
implies that the minimum data bit energy-to-interference-plus-
noise PSD allowed at the PR, denoted by ηp,min, is given by
[8]
ηp,min = Q−1(τp)2

,

where
Q(.)
is
the
Q-function
given
by
Q(x)
=

√
2π
R ∞
x e−u2/2 du, and Q−1(.) is its inverse. From (1),
it is implied that the interference is approximated as a white
Gaussian random process. The secondary system uses a RC
scheme with coding rate Rc = 1/N, as a means to spread
its signal power over a wider bandwidth. At the SR, the
majority logic detection is used for decoding, where a bit is
declared 1(0), if the majority of decoded bits are 1s(0s). The
secondary system might have its own QoS requirement in
terms of maximum allowable BER at the SR, denoted by τs.
B. MU Systems
In multiuser systems, we consider a secondary system with
Ns transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) pairs operating simultaneously
with a primary system with Np Tx-Rx pairs, where all trans-
missions are assumed to be synchronous at both the bit and
chip levels. WH codes are used in both systems as a means
to spread and separate the signals from different transmitters
in a given system. It is assumed that the primary signals are
spread over the entire available bandwidth, with a spreading
factor (SF) Gp. For the secondary system, ﬁrst a RC with
coding rate Rc = 1/Ms is used, and then each coded bit is
spread by a SF Qs, where Qs = Gp/Ms, such that the signal
after coding and SS occupies the total available bandwidth, i.e.,
MsQs = Gp. The above description implies that, each user,
whether in the primary or secondary system, has a transmission
rate of GpRb chips/second at the channel input, where Rb is the
information bit rate measured in bits/second. Since WH code
matrices are squared matrices with dimensions of power 2, and
for mathematical convenience, we assume that the parameters
Gp, Np, and Ms are also variables of power 2, i.e., Gp = 2gp,
Np = 2np, and Ms = 2ms, where gp, np, and ms are all non-
negative integers. Also, it is assumed implicitly that Np ≤ Gp
and Ns ≤ Qs. Finally, all receivers are assumed to receive a
power P from all PTs, and power S from all STs. The other
parameters are the same as in SU systems.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
A. SU Systems
Let that the PSD of the primary signal be denoted Jp, and
that of the secondary signal Js. Then we have P = JpW
and S = JsW. In SU case, since RC coding with coding rate
Rc = 1/N is used, the secondary signal is spread by a factor
N, i.e., the bandwidth and PSD after coding are given by NW
and Js/N, respectively. Thus, the signal-to-interference-plus-
noise ratio (SINR) at the PR is given by
JpW
Js
N × W + N0W =
P
S
N + N0 W ,
(2)
where N0W is the noise power within the primary sig-
nal’s bandwidth, and the corresponding data bit energy-to-
interference-plus-noise PSD is given by [9]
ηp =

(3)
where γp

=
(Eb)s/N0 are the
interference-free signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at PR and SR,
respectively, where (Eb)p = P/W and (Eb)s = S/W. To
satisfy the QoS requirement of the primary system, we need
ηp =

N + 1 ≥ ηp,min,

which results in

(5)
At the input of the SR, and following the same logic as
done above for the PR, the SINR can be found to be

and the corresponding coded bit energy-to-interference-plus-
noise PSD is given by
ηs,c = γs/N

If the secondary system also has a QoS requirement, then
we aim to ﬁnd the largest coding rate, or equivalently, the
smallest value of N that is required to satisfy the QoS of both
systems. Toward that end, the BER at the SR needs to be
simpliﬁed as a function of N. It can be upper bounded, for
BERs,c ≪ 1, by [10]

In (21), we have found the maximum allowable power that
each SR can receive from the corresponding STs, which will
be used next to evaluate the BER at each secondary receiver
for different values of Ms, and Ns. Using the majority logic

Note that if the secondary users are spread the same way

spread over the entire bandwidth using a WH code matrix of

receivers. However, the BER at the secondary receivers will

SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section we evaluate the analytical results we derived
in the previous sections. First we show the results for SU
systems, when only the primary system has to meet a QoS
requirement, and then when both the primary and secondary
systems have to meet their respective QoSs. Then we illustrate
the performance of MU systems, and compare coded SS with
uncoded SS systems. All simulations were conducted using
MATLAB program version R2015a.

Figure 2. BER at SR BERs vs. SNR at PR γp in dB for
τp = 10−4 and N = 1, 5, 10, 20, 30.
A. SU Systems
First we consider the following parameters: τp = 10−4 and
N = 1, 5, 10, 20, 30. In Figure 1, the interference-free SNR
at the SR, γs, in dB vs. the interference-free SNR at the PR,
γp, in dB is shown. It is shown that as N increases, i.e., the
rate decreses, the allowed power from the secondary system
increases as well. This is because the interference margin at PR
is constant, while at the same time, increasing N decreases the
actual interference from the ST. The corresponding BER at the
SR, BERs, vs. the interference-free SNR at the PR, γp, in dB
is shown in Figure 2, where we can see that, as N increases,
the BER decreases for a given value of γp. This improvement
is attributed to coding gain, where as N increases, each bit is
repeated a larger number of times, while the SNR per coded
bit, γs/N, is kept constant, because of the increased power
allowed by the low coding rate, as it is shown in (5).
We now examine the case when both the primary and
secondary systems have a QoS requirements, we consider
the following parameters: τp = 10−2, 10−3, 10−4, 10−5 and
τs = 10−4. In Figure 3, the minimum number of repetitions
per bit to satisfy the QoS of both systems Nmin in dB vs. the
interference-free SNR at the PR γp in dB is shown. We can
observe two things here: ﬁrst, as the QoS requirement at the PR
becomes more stringent, the secondary system requires higher
power from the PT, to create enough interference margin to
start operating. Second, when γp is high enough for a given
τp for the secondary system to start operating satisfactory,
the coding rate required to satisfy both systems’ QoS is very
low, i.e., Nmin is very large. This is because the interference
margin is very low at the PR. However, Nmin decays fast as γp
gets larger than the minimum value required for the secondary
system to operate, and then it becomes almost constant at yet
higher γp. For example, if we want the secondary system to
operate immediately at γp ≃ 12 dB for τp = 10−5, then we
would need Nmin as large as 1000. However, Nmin ≃ 100 at
γp ≃ 12.5 dB, and Nmin ≃ 25 for γp ≥ 16 dB. In Figure 4 the
corresponding interference-free SNR at the SR normalized by
Nmin, i.e., γs/Nmin in dB is shown versus the interference-free
SNR at the PR γp in dB, where it is apparent that ST can
transmit at higher power for lower QoS requirements at the
PR.
It is worth mentioning here that, using RC to spread the
secondary system’s power, decreases the secondary system
bandwidth efﬁciency, because we transmit the same bit several
times. This is the cost the secondary system has to pay, in
exchange of accessing the channel, in the presence of a primary
system, with QoS constraints on the secondary and/or primary
systems. However, RC serves as a very simple coding scheme,
where all we have to do, is just to repeat each data bit at the
transmitter, and use the majority logic detection principle at the
receiver, and thus, very low coding rates can be realized with
reasonable complexity. More complex low coding rate codes
require increased hardware and computational complexities for
the encoding and decoding processes, although they may offer
better performance.

B. MU Systems
In the MU case, we consider the following parameters
for the numerical simulations: the total available bandwidth,
normalized by the baseband bandwidth is Gp = 210 = 1024,
and the number of primary users is Np = 29 = 512. The
maximum allowable BER at each PR is set to be 10−4.

In Figure 5, the interference-free SNR at each SR γs in dB
vs. the interference-free SNR at each PR γp in dB, is shown for
Ms = 21 = 2 repetitions per bit, and the number of secondary
users (SUs) is Ns = 2ns for ns = 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. We can see
that as the number of SUs increases, the allowed transmit
power at each ST decreases for a given γp. This is natural,
since as Ns increases, the interference at each PR increases,
and thus to maintain the maximum allowed interference power
at each PR, the transmit power at each ST must be decreased.
In Figure 6, the coded SS BER BERs,RCSS vs. interference-
free SNR at each PR in dB, is shown for Ns = 64 and
Ms = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]. For each value of Ms, a WH matrix
of dimensions Qs × Qs is used for SS, where Qs = Gp/Ms.
Also shown the case when the whole available bandwidth is
allocated to SS only (i.e., no coding is used), where a WH
matrix of dimensions 1024×1024 is used. We can see that for
Ms = 2, 4 coded SS outperforms uncoded SS, signiﬁcantly so
for Ms = 2. However, for Ms = 8, 16, coded SS has inferior
performance compared to uncoded SS. This trend holds true
for different values of Ns. The implication from this ﬁgure
is that, dividing the total available bandwidth between coding
and SS, is more beneﬁcial in some cases compared to uncoded
SS.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this paper, we investigated the use of repetition coding,
as a means to spread the signal power, possibly in conjunction
with other spreading techniques such as spread spectrum, in an
underlay cognitive radio system. We considered single user and
multiuser systems. In single user systems, we considered two
cases: when the primary system only has a QoS requirement,
and when both the primary and secondary systems have QoS
requirements. In multiuser systems, we incorporated Walsh-
Hadamard coding as an a means to distinguish the signals
from each others, while deploying repetition coding at each
secondary transmitter. Simulation results showed that, in single
user systems, repetition codes with low enough coding rate,
can decrease the interference level at the primary receiver
effectively, only by repeating each data bit, instead of using
more complex spreading techniques, while at the same time

enhancing the bit error rate at the secondary receiver due
to coding gain. In multiuser systems, it is shown that, in
some cases, dividing the total bandwidth between coding and
spread spectrum, is more beneﬁcial, in terms of bit error rate
performance at each secondary receiver, than allocating the
total available bandwidth to spread spectrum only. As a future
work, convolutional codes will be investigated and compared
with RC in terms of performance, as well as complexity
requirements.

Abstract— In cognitive radio (CR) networks, the secondary 
users (SUs) may encounter frequent IP handoffs due to high 
spectrum mobility, even if they remain static spatially i.e., their 
network attachment does not change. However, mobile IPv6 
(MIPv6) was not originally designed to deal gracefully with 
such handoffs induced by spectrum mobility only. As a result, 
the performance of the data applications running in SUs may 
degrade severely. This paper presents a simulation based 
investigation to gauge the seriousness of the issue and to 
suggest possible solutions. We have developed a CR Attribute 
Model, and implemented MIPv6 over it in the well-known 
simulator ns-3. For SUs, we have considered three spectrum 
selection strategies, namely Greedy (GDY), Most Recently 
Used (MRU), and Least Frequently Used (LFU). In each case, 
we have analyzed how the number of IP handoffs increases 
with rise in spectrum mobility, resulting in degraded 
throughput performance in SUs. Our study reveals that MIPv6 
is unable to work properly in CR networks mainly due to high 
default values of router advertisement (RA) interval, lifetime 
period of care-of-address (CoA), and duplicate address 
detection (DAD) period. So, we need to customize MIPv6 – in 
terms of appropriating the pre-set values of RA interval, 
lifetime for CoA, and DAD period – to make it work properly 
in CR networks, where spectrum mobility is high.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recent studies have revealed that significant parts of 
licensed spectrums remain underutilized for long duration; 
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reported 
that the utilization of licensed spectrum ranges from as low 
as 15% to 85% [1]. To improve the spectrum utilization 
maximally [1], cognitive radio (CR) networks harp on 
dynamic spectrum allocation, permitting opportunistic 
access to the unused spectrum by the unlicensed users [2][3], 
known as secondary users (SUs), when subscribed 
customers, known as primary users (PUs) are not using the 
spectrum. SUs are equipped with cognitive capability as well 
as re-configurability that enable them to figure out currently 
unused spectrum holes, decide the best spectrum hole to 
utilize, and exploit that spectrum. SUs have the ability to 
detect reappearance of PUs. As soon as the presence of PU is 
detected, SU evacuates the spectrum immediately and moves 
to another currently unused spectrum, if available. This 
process of switching from one spectrum to another is called 
spectrum mobility/handoff [4] by SUs. 
Today, the wireless environment is highly heterogeneous, 
where multiple wireless access systems coexist over a certain 
area. If we assume that they all implement CR technology in 
their own spectrum [5][6], the spectrum handoff in such 
heterogeneous environments may give rise to two scenarios: 
(1) if the SU switches spectrum within the same system, only 
spectrum handoff occurs (which is referred to as intra-system 
spectrum handoff), (2) if the SU switches to a spectrum of a 
completely different system, a spectrum handoff is followed 
by IP handoff (which is referred to as inter-system spectrum 
handoff) [7]. Figure 1 illustrates these two types of handoffs, 
where dotted lines indicate only spectrum handoff and solid 
lines indicate spectrum handoff as well as IP handoff. 
Conventionally, it has been assumed that IP handoffs occur 
only due to spatial mobility of users in wireless networks. 
But, in CR networks, spectrum handoff may result in IP 
handoff even in absence of spatial mobility. From Figure 1, it 
is clear that the unavailability of unused spectrum in SU’s 
current wireless network during spectrum mobility results 
into inter-system spectrum handoff that leads to an IP 
handoff. It is to be noted that the number of IP handoffs may 
be very high in case of high spectrum mobility, and so, IP 
handoff 
becomes 
a 
more 
common 
event 
in 
CR 
environments. This work mainly focusses on inter-system

spectrum handoff. 
The number of IP handoffs depends on the network 
parameters, such as PU arrival rate, PU channel holding 
time, and the number of SUs. In CR networks, the number of 
IP handoffs for an SU may be quiet high even when the SU 
is stationary. In modern wireless LAN (WLAN) and Long 
Term 
Evolution 
(LTE) 
or 
LTE-Advanced 
(LTE-A) 
networks, the channel usage occurs in discontinuous 
reception mode, where a PU uses a channel for a 
transmission and immediately releases the channel for the 
transmissions from other users [8]. For instance, for data rate 
of 20 kbps and transmission size 1000 byte, the average 
channel holding time is (1000*8/20000)=0.4 sec. So, for 
such small PU channel holding time with significant PU 
arrival rate, the duration of each spectrum hole becomes very 
small and SU interruption frequency becomes very high. It 
makes the CR network environment very dynamic for the 
SUs. This, in turn, poses a new set of challenges for the 
mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol [9], the de-facto standard for 
IP handoff management. Even if the SUs are static, they 
have to invoke MIPv6 to handle IP handoff triggered by 
spectrum mobility. MIPv6 was originally designed for 
handling spatial mobility only, and so is not optimized for 
frequent IP handoffs due to inter-system spectrum mobility. 
It is well known that the handoff procedure in MIPv6 takes a 
significant amount of time, approximately 1.896 sec to 2.47 
sec [10]. So, the net temporal overhead due to multiple IP 
handoffs becomes very high during the complete lifetime of 
a data connection for an SU, which degrades the data 
throughput significantly, giving rise to several new issues for 
CR networks. Recent research works on CR networks mainly 
focus on reducing the spectrum handoff latency [11][12], not 
exploring the IP handoff issues much.  
Hence, the objective of this paper is to investigate the 
performance of the standard MIPv6 [9] in CR networks, in 
particular, the effect of spectrum mobility on MIPv6. To this 
end, we have developed the following modules in network 
simulator ns-3 [13]: (1) a cognitive radio attribute module 
(CRAM) to simulate a typical CR network consisting of 
IEEE 802.11 WLAN and WiMAX, (2) three basic spectrum 
selection algorithms, namely greedy (GDY), most recently 
used (MRU), and least frequently used (LFU), (3) our own 
MIPv6 according to the descriptions given in RFC 6275 [9]. 
In the first set of simulations, our objective is to identify 
the issues of MIPv6 when used in CR networks. We have 
investigated the simulation traces and observed that the high 
values of router advertisement (RA) interval, lifetime of 
care-of-address (CoA), and duplicate address detection 
(DAD) timers are responsible for poor performance of 
MIPv6. In the second set of simulations, we have set RA 
interval, lifetime of CoA, and DAD timer to sufficiently 
small values (as deemed fit by us). Then, we have measured 
the number of IP handoffs and throughput performance of 
SUs for different spectrum selection algorithms by varying 
the PU arrival rate, PU channel holding time, and the number 
of SUs in the CR networks.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, we discuss recent research works on spectrum mobility 
and IP mobility in CR networks. Section III provides a brief 
description of our model implementation in ns-3. Section IV 
illustrates the MIPv6 issues noted in CR networks. In 
Section V, we analyze the number of IP handoffs and its 
impact on throughput performance of the SUs. Finally, 
Section VI concludes the paper. 
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
To access the Internet services using CR networks, the 
SUs cycle through three phases: spectrum handoff phase, IP 
handoff phase, and data transmission phase. The spectrum 
handoff phase consists of channel sensing, handoff decision, 
pause, and channel switching functions [4]. Similarly, IP 
handoff phase consists of RA, CoA formation, and tunnel 
setup [9]. The phase transition is illustrated in Figure 2. 
During data transmission, if reappearance of PU occurs, then 
SU moves to channel sensing phase where the SU attempts 
to find spectrum holes to switch to another empty channel. If 
an empty channel is unavailable, the SU continues sensing 
the busy set of channels, repeating channel sensing and pause 
phases continuously. In spectrum decision phase, the SU 
decides the best channel to switch to, based on available 
channels. The selection logic is closely related to the channel 
characteristics, and the operations of the PUs and the SUs. In 
the channel switch phase, SU changes its operating channel. 
If the channel switch occurs in the same system, data 
transmission begins immediately; otherwise, the SU 
encounters an additional MIPv6 handoff. 
Though many recent research works focus on spectrum 
mobility in CR networks, only a few research works focus on 
the resulting IP handoff and problems thereof faced by SUs. 
A. Spectrum Handoff 
Wang et al. [11][12] have proposed a dynamic 
programming based greedy algorithm to determine the 
optimal target channel sequence, and proved that greedy 
algorithm provides better results in terms of time complexity.

To optimize the data delivery time, a traffic-adaptive 
spectrum handoff mechanism is proposed in [12]. It changes 
the target channel sequence of spectrum handoffs based on 
traffic conditions. Southwell et al. [14] analyzed spectrum 
handoff delay, considering the cost of channel switching and 
congestion due to multiple SUs, with prior knowledge of 
heterogeneous channels. They have proposed a fast 
algorithm to determine the best single-user decision, 
depending on other user’s plans without communicating with 
each other. 
B. IP Handoff 
In [7], M. Kataoka et al. have proposed a MIP protocol 
based Cognitive Radio system architecture to reduce the 
handoff delay. The system architecture follows a hierarchical 
structure consisting of a wired and a wireless part. However, 
the downside of this protocol is that the control node 
becomes a bottleneck and may result in a single point failure. 
Chen et al. [15] have proposed a cross-layer protocol to 
optimize the data transmission time in Cognitive Radio LTE 
networks. Since the authors assumed homogeneous LTE 
network, they did not use MIPv6. Instead they used Standard 
LTE handoff mechanism which takes only a few 
milliseconds and so, there is no such noticeable impact of IP 
handoff in the transmission time. 
The above proposals have been made to reduce the IP 
handoff latency in CR networks. To the best of our 
knowledge, no efforts have been reported thus far in the 
literature to investigate the issues of network layer mobility 
management protocols, such as MIPv6 in CR networks. 
Also, no prior works exist to show the impact of spectrum 
mobility on MIPv6. These observations call for a detailed 
analysis of MIPv6 in CR networks which may give us an 
insight into the practical design issues of MIPv6 and the 
impact of spectrum mobility on IP handoffs. In this paper, 
we have attempted to identify those issues in MIPv6 and 
shown that MIPv6 must be customized to work properly in 
CR networks. 
III. 
COGNITIVE RADIO ATTRIBUTE MODEL (CRAM) 
We have implemented CRAM in ns-3 [13]. It takes 
traffic parameters and spectrum selection strategy as input. 
We describe CRAM in the following three subsections. 
A. Traffic Parameter 
We consider one WLAN network with C1 number of 
channels and one WiMAX network with C2 number of 
channels. At any point in time, each of these channels can be 
occupied by a PU or a SU or remains empty. For simplicity, 
we have assumed homogeneous traffic parameters for all 
channels. Let us assume that the arrival rate of both PU and 
SU is Poisson. Let λp (arrival/second) be the arrival rate of 
PUs and λs (arrival/second) be the arrival rate of SUs. Let the 
service time for PUs and SUs be Xp (second/arrival) and Xs 
(second/arrival), respectively; both follow exponential 
distribution. If ρp and ρs denote the channel utilization for the 
transmissions of PUs and SUs, respectively, then the overall 
utilization is:

It is to be noted that ρ≤1. We denote by Ip the inter arrival 
time of the PUs. Due to memory less property, it follows 
exponential distribution with rate λp. As given in [12], we

The CRAM model takes C1, C2, λp, and E[Xp] as input 
parameters. To obtain ρs we use M/M/C queuing model, 
where C denotes number of channels being used to serve the 
SUs. According to the definition of the M/M/C queue, the 
average number of SUs in the system can be written as [16]:

B. Spectrum Selection Strategies 
We 
have 
implemented 
three 
spectrum 
selection 
strategies: Greedy (GDY) [11][17], Most Recently Used 
(MRU) [18], and Least Frequently Used (LFU) [19]. These 
28

COCORA 2016 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Cognitive Radio

strategies are implemented based on the statistical 
information of the channels. In GDY strategy, the SU 
selects the first empty channel without any pre-estimation 
of its freeness. Typically, the works [12][17] on modeling 
and analysis of spectrum mobility events assume GDY 
strategy (called first-come-first-served in their system 
model). The GDY strategy is an opportunistic one; it 
selects the empty channel at random, not targeting to utilize 
the spectrum holes optimally [11]. In contrast, several other 
research works [11][15][18][19] adopt selection strategies 
to utilize spectrum holes efficiently for the purpose of load 
balancing among channels as well as reducing data 
transmission time and improving throughput of SUs. These 
works consider the typical heterogeneous CR network 
environment [15] with multiple PUs and SUs [11][18][19]. 
We also assume this type of scenario in this work. MRU 
and LFU are selected as two efficient spectrum selection 
strategies based on the concept applied in [18] and [19], 
respectively. In MRU strategy, the SU selects the channel 
which has been used most recently by a PU, expecting a 
lengthy absence of PUs in that channel in near future. In 
LFU strategy, the SU selects the channel which has been 
least used by the PUs thus far, hoping that it will remain so 
in near future too. 
In Figure 1, we have illustrated spectrum selection by a 
SU using these three strategies. At the time t1 and t2, the SU 
follows the GDY strategy to switch channel. At time t1, the 
SU selects the spectrum hole of the first channel even though 
channel 3 is also empty. Similarly, at time t2, the SU selects 
the spectrum hole of the first channel of WiMAX network. 
At time t3, the SU follows MRU strategy and selects the 
spectrum hole of channel 2 of the WiFi network as it is used 
most currently among the free channels. At time t4, the SU 
uses LFU strategy to switch to channel 2 of WiMAX 
network as the usage percentage of the channel by PU is less 
than other free channels. 
C. CRAM Implementation in ns-3 [13] 
We 
used 
the 
Time, 
Timer, 
Simulator, 
and 
RandomVariable classes to implement CRAM. The Time 
and Timer classes are used to schedule a task, such as 
assigning a channel to a SU/PU for a particular time interval 
and cancel it after completion of the task. The Simulator 
class is used for initial scheduling of the entire task in the 
simulation, i.e., it starts the PU and SU transmissions. The 
RandomVariable class is used to generate exponentially 
distributed random numbers. We used two schedulers: 
channel scheduler (Figure 3) and SU scheduler. The channel 
scheduler takes the mean value of λp and E[Xp] as input. 
Following the distribution, the sequence generator generates 
a large number of sequences (over 1000). Each sequence 
consists of PU service time and duration of spectrum holes. 
During simulation, it makes the state of the channel either 
busy or free, based on the generated values. In the PU busy 
state, the channel scheduler starts the PU timer and makes 
the state as busy. After expiration of the PU timer, the free 
timer starts and the channel state becomes free. It would 
remain free up to the spectrum hole duration of the current 
sequence unless an SU sends a busy trigger. The SU busy 
trigger changes the channel state into busy. After expiration, 
it queries for the next sequence. A channel sensor database is 
designed that acquires the channel information.  
In SU scheduler (Figure 4), user inputs its data 
transmission time and the spectrum selection strategy. The 
spectrum selection strategy acquires the channel information 
from all channels of all systems and makes a decision. It 
outputs the next channel number (k) and the remaining free 
time. If it gets the free time slot, it starts transmission timer, 
giving a busy trigger to the kth channel scheduler. The start 
transmission functionality makes the SU’s WiFi or, WiMAX 
netdevice state into ‘UP’. The Stop Transmission function 
makes the SU’s corresponding state into ‘Down’ state. If 
anytime the spectrum selection strategy cannot find a free 
channel, it pauses for a predefined timer value. After

IV. 
MIPV6 ISSUES IN CR NETWORKS 
We have developed our own MIPv6 module for ns-3 (as 
it is not available currently) on top of CRAM. 
A. Simulation setup 
We have considered a WLAN with 10 channels and a 
WiMAX network with 20 channels. SU is opportunistic to 
WLAN. We used constant position mobility model for the 
SUs because we are not interested in spatial mobility. We 
used λp=1.5 and E[NS]=4. The average connection length is 
480 bytes for exponentially distributed connections [20]. So, 
when the data rate of primary connection is 19.2 Kbps, we 
have E[Xp]=(480*8)/(19.2*103)=0.2 sec. The Pause timeout 
value and spectrum handoff delay are set as 0.05 sec and 
0.01 sec, respectively. Correspondent node (CN) and SU are 
running ‘UDP Echo’ application and transferring packets at 
the rate of 80 Kbps. The whole simulation is run for 1000 
sec. However, we present only the results selected from 100 
sec to 200 sec to highlight the design issues. 
B. High RA Interval and Lifetime Period 
If the duration of spectrum holes is very small, an SU 
may switch from one network (say WLAN) to another (say 
WiMAX), reside there for a very short time, and then may 
return to WLAN again. When the SU switches to WiMAX, 
the address configured in WLAN still remains valid for some 
more time. If it returns to WLAN quickly, it could use the 
previously configured CoA in WLAN, giving rise to two 
issues. First, when the SU is in WiMAX, another SU in 
WLAN may configure the same CoA and execute DAD 
procedure. The DAD procedure detects the address as valid 
for obvious reasons. So, when the SU returns to WLAN 
quickly, duplicate addresses would exist in WLAN even if 
DAD procedure detects no duplicity. Second, the binding 
update and tunnel setup procedures in MIPv6 are always 
triggered after the completion of DAD procedure. So, if the 
SU uses previously configured CoA in WLAN, those 
procedures are skipped. Since MIPv6 is not triggered, the 
tunnel set up between the SU and its home agent (HA) would 
still be the older one and the traffic would not be redirected 
towards the SU. As a result, the performance of the SU 
degrades drastically.  
In Figure 5, we illustrate the impact of high RA interval 
and lifetime duration on packet flow in CR networks. First, 
we used MaxRAInterval=3 sec and MinRAInterval=1 sec as 
given in [10]. So, after switching back to WLAN, the SU 
does not perform MIPv6 operations for a long time due to 
high RA interval and lifetime period. This is evident from 
long gaps in packet sequence number in Figure 5. Next, we 
decreased the values of RA interval to MaxRAInterval=0.07 
sec and MinRAInterval=0.03 sec. The corresponding 
simulation result (Figure 5) shows that MIPv6 is unable to 
work gracefully, resulting in long gaps in packet sequence 
number. So, we further reduced the values of RA intervals to 
7ms (MaxRAInterval) and 3ms (MinRAInterval), and then 
we found that all MIPv6 operations are completed 
successfully (Figure 5). We also observed that, under this 
circumstance, a large number of control packets are being 
generated, leading to congestion. So, we argue that the RA 
interval and lifetime period must be set considerably low in 
order to be appropriate for use in CR networks. 
C. High DAD Period 
RFC 6275 [9] has mentioned the default DAD period as 
1 sec. It may be higher than the considered duration of 
spectrum holes in CR networks. Whenever an SU switches 
to a new network, the address configuration procedure – in 
particular, the DAD procedure – consumes almost the entire 
time, and hence, the spectrum hole cannot be used for data 
transmission (Figure 6). So, the throughput of SUs degrades 
in CR networks. For this reason, the DAD period must also 
be reduced to make MIPv6 more effective in CR networks. 
V. 
ANALYSIS OF IMPACT OF SPECTRUM MOBILITY 
We have made some changes in the simulation setup, 
described in Section IV-A, to bring in more randomness in 
the availability of spectrum holes. The channels of CRAM 
are characterized as high usage and low usage to benefit

MinRAInterval = 30 ms, MaxRAInterval = 70 ms, Preferred LifeTime = 1.5 s, Valid LifeTime = 2 s

from LFU and MRU strategies. We used λp, E[Xp], and 
E[NS] variables to control the emptiness of the channels 
(Table I). Also, to alleviate the problems explained in 
Section IV, we have taken 7 msec and 3 msec for 
MaxRAInterval and MinRAInterval, respectively. The 
preferred and valid lifetime values are assumed to be 0.5 sec 
and 1 sec, respectively.

(E[XP])HIGH=0.3 
 
We have randomly assigned either (E[Xp])HIGH or 
(E[Xp])LOW values in all 30 channels, while keeping E[NS]=4. 
Increasing λp, increases the frequency of spectrum holes but 
with reduced duration of each. From Figure 7, we observe 
that (i) up to λp≤2.8, the number of IP handoffs increases, (ii) 
for 0.1≤λp≤2.2, all IP handoffs complete successfully due to 
sufficiently large spectrum holes. As a result, the throughput 
of the SU is reduced due to the lengthy handoff operation of 
Simulation Parameter Values MIPv6 as shown in Figure 8. 
For 2.2˂λp≤2.8, only few IP handoffs were not completed 
due to the small duration of the spectrum holes. As a result, 
there was not such a drastic degradation in the throughput of 
the SUs as shown in Figure 8. But, for λp>2.8, the spectrum 
holes became very small. So, the SUs could not get the 
opportunity to perform spectrum handoff as well as IP 
handoff for most of the time. In this case, SUs cycle between 
pause and channel sensing phases (Figure 2), thereby 
reducing the throughput performance of the SUs drastically 
(Figure 8). 
For λp≤2.2, the MRU strategy performs better than LFU 
and GDY strategies (Figure 8) because the MRU strategy 
always finds the freest channel, i.e., the SU can use the 
channel for a long time without needing to perform frequent 
IP handoffs. But that is not true for the other two strategies. 
However, for the range λp>2.2, the spectrum hole duration 
becomes very small and is consumed by the MIPv6 handoff 
procedure in all the three spectrum selection strategies. In 
this case, since MRU always selects the longest spectrum 
hole, it wastes more time than the other two strategies. For 
0.1≤E[Xp]≤0.4, the number of IP handoffs was increasing. In 
particular, for 0.1≤E[Xp] ≤0.3, all IP handoffs were 
completed successfully leading to throughput degradation 
due to lengthy MIPv6 handoff operation (Figure 9). But, for 
0.3<E[Xp]≤0.4, most of the IP handoffs were incomplete. As 
a result, the throughput of the SUs dropped quickly (Figure 
9). Also, for E[Xp]>0.4, the number of IP handoffs was 
reduced because the SUs were mostly cycling between 
channel sensing and pause phases (Figure 2). As a result, the 
throughput of the SUs degraded sharply (Figure 9).

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Our study reveals that MIPv6 cannot work properly in 
CR networks due to high values of RA interval, lifetime 
period of CoA, and DAD period – especially when the 
spectrum holes are becoming smaller. So, the values for 
these parameters must be reduced to appropriate levels for 
use in CR environment. We have also analyzed the number 
of IP handoffs resulting from spectrum mobility in the 
absence of spatial mobility. Those results indicate that, 
unless the afore-mentioned parameters are properly tuned, 
the number of IP handoffs escalates with increase in the 
number 
of 
spectrum 
handoffs, 
resulting 
in 
severe 
degradation of data throughput. Also, the throughput of an 
SU (irrespective of the GDY, MRU or LFU strategy used) 
depends upon various values of the PU arrival rate and the 
PU service time. For lower values of these traffic parameters, 
MRU and LFU have better performance than GDY has; but, 
for higher values of the traffic parameters, GDY is better 
than MRU and LFU. So, in dynamic spectrum availability 
scenario, designing an adaptive spectrum selection strategy 
would be a good approach to enhance the overall throughput 
of the SU. Thus, in effect, our analyses clearly indicate that 
more research efforts are needed to optimize MIPv6 before it 
is used in CR networks.

Abstract—In traditional cognitive radio approach, spectrum is
divided into black and white spaces. Black space is reserved to
primary users (PU) as secondary users (SU) are able to transmit
in white space. A modern approach is that the black space is
divided into black and grey spaces to get more capacity. Grey
space leads to novel type of interference environment because of
interfering signals coming from PUs and other SUs. In addition,
novel CR applications like long term evolution advanced (LTE-A)
and internet of things (IoT) generate interfering signals. Thus,
interference suppression is needed. In this paper, the performance
of the forward consecutive mean excision algorithm (FCME)
interference suppression method is studied in the presence of
relatively narrowband interfering signals existing in the novel
CR networks. Real-world LTE and WLAN signal measurements
were used to verify the usability of the FCME IS method in
future CR applications.

INTRODUCTION
Heavily used spectrum calls for new technologies and
innovations. Cognitive radio (CR) [1] [2] offers possibility
to effective spectrum usage allowing secondary users (SU)
to transmit at unreserved frequencies if they guarantee that
primary users (PU) transmissions are not disturbed. Earlier,
spectrum was divided into two zones (spaces): black and white
zone. As black zone was fully reserved to PUs and off limits
to secondary users, their transmission was allowed in white
zones where there were no PU transmissions. The problem in
this classiﬁcation is that if the spectrum is not totally unused,
secondary users are not able to transmit. Thus, the spectrum
usage is not as efﬁcient as it could be. Instead, spectra can be
divided into three zones: white, grey (or gray) and black zone
[3]. In this model, the SU transmission is allowed in white and
grey spaces, as black spaces are reserved for PUs.
Cognitive radio has several novel applications. Long Term
Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) is a 4G mobile communication
technology [4]. LTE-A exploits cognitive radio technology and
utilizes ﬂexible and intelligent spectrum usage. Its focus is on
high capacity. LTE-A enables one of the newest topics called
Wide Area IoT (Internet of Things), where sensors, systems
and other smart devices are connected to internet. Therein,
long-range communication, long battery life and minimal
amount of data, as well as narrow bandwidth are key issues. In
addition, Cognitive IoT (CIoT) has been proposed to highlight
required intelligence [5].
As cognitive radio technology offers more efﬁcient spec-
trum use, there are many challenges. One of those is that
the cognitive world is an interference-intensive environment.
Especially in-band interfering signals cause problems. There
are three main types of interference in CR: from SU to PU
(SU-PU interference), from PU to SU (PU-SU interference),
and interference among SUs (SU-SU interference) [6] [7].
The basic idea in CR is that SU must not interfere PUs.
Instead, SU may be interfered by PUs or other SUs. When
there are multiple PUs and SUs with different applications and
technologies, cumulative interference is a problematic task [8].
In grey spaces, there is interference from PU (and possible
other SU) transmissions. It is efﬁcient to mitigate unknown
interference in order to achieve higher capacity. Therefore,
interference suppression (IS) methods are needed.
Interference suppression exploits the characteristics of de-
sired / interfering signal by ﬁltering the received signal [9].
IS techniques include, for example, ﬁlters, cyclostationar-
ity, transform-domain methods like wavelets and short-time
Fourier transform (STFT), high order statistics, spatial process-
ing like beamforming and joint detection / multiuser detection
[10]. Filter-based IS is performed in the time domain. Optimal
ﬁlter (Wiener ﬁlter) can be deﬁned only if the interference
and signal of interest Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) are
known. Usually, those are not known, so adaptive ﬁltering is
an option. In ﬁlter-based IS, both computational complexity
and hardware costs are low but co-channel interference cannot
be suppressed, and no interference with similar waveforms
to signals can be suppressed. Cyclostationarity based inter-
ference suppression has low hardware complexity but medium
computational complexity. This may cause challenges in real-
time low-power applications. In transform domain IS, compu-
tational complexity is medium, but transform domain IS cannot
be used when interference and signal-of-interest have the same
kind of waveforms. However, waveform design may be used.
Transform domain IS has medium computational complexity
and low hardware complexity. High-order statistics based inter-
ference suppression is computationally complex, and multiple
antennas/samplers are needed, so its hardware cost is high and
computational complexity too. In beamforming, co-channel
interference as well as interference with similar waveforms
to the signal of interest can be suppressed, but because of
multiple antennas, the hardware cost is high. Its computational
complexity is medium.
The less about the interfering signal characteristics is known,
the more demanding the IS task will be. As most of the IS
methods need some information about the suppressed signals
and/or noise, there are some methods that are able to operate
blindly. Blind IS methods do not need any a priori information

about the interfering signals, their modulations or other char-
acteristics. Also the noise level can be unknown, so it has to
be estimated. Blind IS methods are well suited for demanding
and varying environments.
It is crystal clear that when operating in real-world with
mobile devices and varying environment, computational com-
plexity is one of the key issues. Fast and reliable as well as
cost-effective, powersave and adaptive methods are needed. In
this paper, a transform domain IS method called the forward
consecutive mean excision (FCME) algorithm [11] [12] is
proposed to be used for interfering signal suppression (IS) in
cognitive radio applications. The FCME algorithm is a blind
constant false alarm rate (CFAR) -type interference suppres-
sion method that is able to suppress all kind of relatively
narrowband (RNB) signals in all kind of environments and
in all kind of frequency areas. Here, RNB means that the
suppressed signal is narrowband with respect to the studied
bandwidth. The wider the studied band is the wider the
suppressed signal can be. First, cognitive radio applications
and interference environment are considered. Focus is on IS
in SU receiver interfered by PUs and other SUs. A scenario
that clariﬁes the interference environment is presented. The
FCME algorithm is presented and its feasibility is considered.
Measurement results for LTE and WLAN signals are used to
verify the performance of the FCME IS method.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II considers
future cognitive applications as in Section III, interference
environment in cognitive radios is studied. The FCME algo-
rithm is presented and its feasibility is considered in Section
IV. Measurement results are presented in Section V, and
conclusions are drawn in Section VI.

FUTURE COGNITIVE APPLICATIONS
Future applications that use cognitive approach include, for
example, LTE-A and cognitive IoT. LTE-A is an advanced
version of LTE. Therein, orthogonal Frequency Division Multi-
plex (OFDM) signal is used. In OFDM systems, data is divided
between several closely spaced carriers. LTE downlink uses
OFDM signal as uplink uses Single Carrier Frequency Divi-
sion Multiple Access (SC-FDMA). Downlink signal has more
power than uplink signal. Thus, its interference distance is
larger than uplink signals. OFDM offers high data bandwidths
and tolerance to interference. As LTE uses 6 bandwidths up
to 20 MHz, LTE-A may offer even 100 MHz bandwidth.
LTE-A offers about three times greater spectrum efﬁciency
when compared to LTE. In addition, some kind of cognitive
characteristics are expected [13] [14] [15]. RNB interfering
signals exist especially at grey zones. This calls for IS.
In the network ecosystem, it is expected that cognitive IoT
[5] [16] will be the next ’big’ thing to focus on. Wide-area IoT
is a network of nodes like sensors and it offers connections
between/to/from systems and smart devices (i.e., objects) [17]
[18]. Cognitive IoT enables objects to learn, think and under-
stand both the physical and social world. Connected objects
are intelligent and autonomous and they are able to interact
with environment and networks so that the amount of human
intervention is minimized. Therein, the long-range (even tens

of kilometers) connection of nodes via cellular connections is
expected. Data sent by nodes is minimal and transmissions may
seldom occur. Thus, there is no need to use wide bandwidths
for a transmission. This saves power consumption but also
spectrum resources. Proposed technologies include, e.g., LoRa
[19], Neul [20], GSM, SigFox [21], and LTE-M [22]. As
Neul is able to operate in bands below 1 GHz and LoRa
as well as SigFox operate in ISM band, LTE-M operates in
LTE frequencies. A common thing is that the ultra-narrowband
(UNB) signals are proposed to be used. For example, in LTE-
M, 200 kHz BW is to be studied. Maximum transmit power
is of the order of 20 dBm. In Neul, 180 kHz band is needed.
Most of those technologies are on the phase of development. In
any case, it is expected that the amount of narrowband signals
is growing. Thus, IS is required, especially when it is operated
in mobile bands.
III.
INTERFERENCE ENVIRONMENT IN CR
In modern CR, the spectrum is divided into three zones
- white, grey and black. In Figure 1, zone classiﬁcation is
presented. It is assumed that PU-SU distance is >y km in the
white zone, <x km in the black zone, and in the grey zone it
holds that x km <PU-SU-distance <y km [23]. It means that if
SU is more than y km from the PU, SU is allowed to transmit.
If SU is closer than y km but further than x km from the PU,
SU may be able to transmit with low power. Spectrum sensing
is required before transmission and there are interfering signals
so IS is needed to ensure SU transmissions. If PU-SU distance
is less than x km, SU transmission is not allowed.
Interference environment differs between the zones. White
space contains only noise. Therein, the noise is most com-
monly additive white Gaussian (AWGN) noise at the receiver’s
front-end, and man-made noise. This is related to the used fre-
quency band. Grey space contains interfering signals within the
noise which causes challenges. Grey space is occupied by PU
(and possible other SU) signals with low to medium power that
means interference with low to medium power. IS is required
especially is this zone. Black space includes communications
signals, possible interfering signals, and noise. In black space,
there are PU signals with high power and SUs have no access.
There must be some rules that enable SUs to transmit in grey
zone without causing any harm to PUs. According to [24], SU
can transmit at the same time as PU if the limit of interference
temperature at the desired receiver is not reached. In [2],

it is considered the maximum amount of interference that a
receiver is able to tolerate, i.e., an interference temperature
model. This can be used when studying interference from SU
to PU network. In [25], primary radio network (PRN) deﬁnes
some interference margin. This can be done based on channel
conditions and target performance metric. Interference margin
is broadcasted to the cognitive radio network. In any case, the
maximum transmit power of SUs is limited.
In our scenario presented in Figure 2, it is assumed that
we have one PU base station (BS), several PU mobile stations
and several SUs. SU terminals form microcells. Part or all of
SUs are mobile and part of SUs may be intelligent devices
or sensors (i.e., IoT). Between SUs, weak signal powers are
needed for a transmission. One microcell can consist of, for
example, devices in an ofﬁce room. They can use the same
or different signal types than PU. For example, in the ofﬁce
room case, a wireless local area network (WLAN) can be used.
Between the intelligent devices (IoT), UNB signals are used.
It is assumed that SUs operate at grey zone, so IS is required
to ensure the quality of SU transmissions.
SUs measure signals transmitted by PU base stations and
estimate relative distance to them. Using this information,
SUs know whether their short range communication will
cause harmful interference to the PU base station. To enable
secondary transmissions under continuous interference caused
by the PU base station this interference is attenuated by
interference suppression.
The secondary access point knows the locations of PU
terminals or SUs measure the power levels of the signals
coming from PU mobile terminals in the uplink. If it is
assumed that SUs know the locations of PUs, SUs do not
interfere with PUs. If SUs do not know PUs locations, their
transmission is allowed when received PU signal power is
below some predetermined threshold. If the level of the power
coming from a certain primary terminal is small, it is assumed
that secondary transmission generates negligible interference
towards primary terminal. However, it may happen that SUs
don’t sense closely spaced silent PUs.
Let us consider microcell 1 in Figure 2. There are one SU
transmitter SU TX1 and four terminals SU i, i = 1, · · · , 4. In
addition to the intended signal from SU TX1, SU 1 receives
the noise η, SU 2 receives PU downlink (PU BS) signal and
the noise η, SU 3 receives PU downlink (PU BS) and PU
uplink (PU 1) signals and the noise η, and SU 4 receives PU
downlink (PU BS) signal, signal from other microcell’s SU,
and the noise η. For example, if it is assumed that PUs are
in the LTE-A network and SUs use WLAN signals, receiver
SU 2 has to suppress OFDM signal, receiver SU 3 has to
suppress OFDM and SC-FDMA signals, and receiver SU 4
has to suppress OFDM and WLAN signals.
In addition, interfering and communication signals have to
be separated from each other. The receiver has to know which
signals are interfering signals to be suppressed and which
signals are of interest. An easy way to separate an interfering
signal from the intended signal is to use different bandwidths.
For example, in LTE networks, it is known that there are 6
different signal bandwidths between 1.4 and 20 MHz that are
used [4]. Especially if different signal type is used, it is easy
to separate interfering signals from our information signal. It
can also be assumed that interfering signal has higher power
than the desired signal. However, this consideration is out of
the scope of this paper.
IV.
THE FCME METHOD
The adaptively operating FCME method [11] was originally
proposed for impulsive interference suppression in the time
domain. It was noticed later that the method is practical also
in the frequency domain [12]. Earlier, the FCME method has
mainly been studied against sinusoidal and impulsive signals
which are narrowband ones. The computational complexity
of the FCME method is N log2(N) due to the sorting [12].
Analysis of the FCME method has been presented in [12].
The FCME method adapts according to the noise level,
so no information about the noise level is required. Because
the noise is used as a basis of calculation, there is no need
for information about the suppressed signals. Even though
it is assumed in the calculation that the noise is Gaussian,
the FCME method operates even if the noise is not purely
Gaussian [12]. In fact, it is sufﬁcient that the noise differs
from the signal. When it is assumed that the noise is Gaussian,
x2 (=the energy of samples) has a chi-squared distribution
with two degrees of freedom. Thus, the used IS threshold is
calculated using [11]
Th = −ln(PF A,DES)x2 = TCMEx2,
(1)
where TCME = −ln(PF A,DES) is the used pre-determined
threshold parameter [12], PF A,DES is the desired false alarm
rate used in constant false alarm rate (CFAR) methods,

Q is the size of the set. For example, when it is selected
that PF A,DES = 0.1 (=10% of the samples are above the
threshold in the noise-only case), the threshold parameter
TCME = −ln(0.1) = 2.3. The FCME method rearranges the
frequency-domain samples in an ascending order according to
the sample energy, selects 10% of the smallest samples to form
the set Q, and calculates the mean of Q. After that, (1) is used
to calculate the ﬁrst threshold. Then, Q is updated to include all
the samples below the threshold, a new mean is calculated, and
a new threshold is computed. This is continued until there are
no new samples below the threshold. Finally, samples above
the threshold are from interfering signal(s) and suppressed.
The FCME algorithm is blind and it is independent of
modulation methods, signal types and amounts of signals. It
can be used in all frequency areas, from kHz to GHz. The
only requirements are that (1) the signal(s) can not cover the
whole bandwidth under consideration, and (2) the signal(s)
are above the noise level. The ﬁrst requirement means that the
FCME method can be used against RNB signals. For example,
10 MHz signal is wideband when the studied bandwidth is
that 10 MHz, but RNB when the studied bandwidth is, e.g.,
100 MHz. In fact, it is enough that the interfering signal does
not cover more than 80% of the studied bandwidth. However,
the narrower the interference is, the better the FCME method
operates [26].
V.
MEASUREMENTS
The interference suppression performance of the FCME
method against RNB signals was studied using real-world
wireless data. The results are based on real-life measure-
ments. Measurements were performed using spectrum analyzer
Agilent E4446 [27] (Figure 3). Three types of signals were
studied, namely the LTE uplink, LTE downlink, and WLAN
signals. All those signals are commonly used wireless signals.
Both LTE1800 network frequencies and WLAN signals were
measured at the University of Oulu, Finland. IS was performed
using the FCME method with threshold parameter 4.6, i.e.,
desired false alarm rate PF A,DES = 1% = 0.01 [12].
LTE1800 network operates at 2 × 75 MHz band so that
uplink is on 1.710 − 1.785 GHz and downlink is on 1.805 −
1.880 GHz [28]. LTE downlink uses OFDM signal as uplink

uses SC-FDMA. LTE assumes a small nominal guard band
(10% of the band, excluding 1.4 MHz case).
One measurement at 1.7 − 1.9 GHz containing 1000 time
domain sweeps and 1601 frequency domain points is seen
in Figure 4. Therein, only downlink signaling is present.
Downlink signals have larger interference distance than uplink
signals. Interfering signals cover about 30% of the studied
bandwidth. In Figure 5, situation after the FCME IS is pre-
sented. It can be seen that the signals have been suppressed.
On uplink signal frequencies where no signals are present (600
ﬁrst frequency domain samples), average noise value is −99
dBm before and after IS.
In Figure 6, ﬁrst line (sweep) of the previous case is
presented more closely. The FCME thresholds after two cases
are presented. In the ﬁrst case, the FCME is calculated using

frequencies 1.8 − 1.9 GHz (downlink). Interfering signals
cover about 60% of the studied bandwidth. The threshold is
−89 dBm (upper line). In the second case, the threshold is
calculated using both uplink and downlink frequencies 1.7−1.9
GHz when there is no uplink signals (like case in Figure 4),
i.e., SU is so far away from PU that only downlink signals are
present. Interfering signals cover about 30% of the studied
bandwidth. In that case, the threshold is −91 dBm (lower
dashed threshold). It can be noticed that when the studied
bandwidth is doubled and this extra band contains only noise,
we get 2 dB gain.
Next, both uplink and downlink signals are present. There
were 2001 frequency domain points and 1000 time sweeps.
Figure 7 presents one measurement at 1.7 − 1.9 GHz. Both
uplink and downlink signals are present. In Figure 8, one
snapshot when both uplink and downlink signals are present
is presented. Therein, both signals are suppressed.
In the WLAN measurements, 2.4 − 2.5 GHz frequency area
was used. There were 1000 sweeps and 1201 frequency domain
data points. In Figure 9, one snapshot is presented when there
is a WLAN signal present and the FCME algorithm is used to
perform IS. As can be seen, the WLAN signal is found.
Next, the desired false alarm rate (PF A,DES) values are
compared to the achieved false alarm rate (PF A) values in
the noise-only case. Figure 10 presents one situation when
there is only noise present. According to the deﬁnition of
the FCME method, threshold parameter 4.6 means that 1%
of the samples is above the threshold when there is only noise
present. Here, there are 1201 samples so PF A,DES = 1% = 12
samples. In Figure 10, 12 samples are over the threshold, so
PF A,DES = PF A. We had 896 measurement sweeps in the
noise-only case at WLAN frequencies. Therein, minimum 1
sample and maximum 19 samples were over the threshold as
the mean was 10 samples and median value was 9 samples.
Those were close of required 12 samples. Note that the
deﬁnition has been made for pure AWGN noise.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, the performance of the forward consecutive
mean excision (FCME) interference suppression method was
studied against relatively narrowband interfering signals ex-
isting in the novel cognitive radio networks. Focus was on
interference suppression in secondary user receiver suffering
interfering signals caused by primary and other secondary
users. Real-world LTE and WLAN measurements were per-
formed in order to verify the performance of the FCME
method. It was noted that the FCME method is able to suppress
LTE OFDM and SC-FDMA signals as well as WLAN signals.

Abstract—The paper seeks to identify mobile network 
operators’ business opportunities in the new Citizens 
Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) shared spectrum access 
framework. More flexible and scalable use of the 3.5GHz 
spectrum aims to increase the efficiency of spectrum use in 
delivering fast growing and converging mobile broadband and 
media services while paving way to new innovations, e.g., in the 
area of Internet of Things and 5G. The opportunity analysis 
indicated that the mobile network operators could benefit 
significantly from the new, shared CBRS bands enabling to 
cope with increasing asymmetric media data traffic and to 
offer 
differentiation 
through 
improved 
quality 
and 
personalization of services. Heterogeneous network assets 
leveraging 3GPP LTE evolution were found to be the key 
enabler while regulatory actions may frame the availability of 
spectrum and limit the economic value for an operator. The 
concept of co-opetition was found useful to characterize the 
business environment regarding CBRS spectrum sharing.  
Keywords-business opportunity; mobile network operator; 
mobile broadband; cognitive radio; Citizens Broadband Radio 
Service. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
We have witnessed the rapid growth of wireless services 
with a large range of diverse devices, applications and 
services requiring connectivity. The number of mobile 
broadband (MBB) data subscribers, connected ‘things’ and 
the amount of data used per user is set to grow significantly 
[1] leading to increasing spectrum demand. The US 
President’s Council of Advanced Science & Technology 
(PCAST) report [2] emphasized the need for novel thinking 
within wireless industry to meet the growing spectrum crisis 
in spectrum allocation, utilization and management. The 
essential role of spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum 
access were underlined to find a balance between the 
different systems and services with their different spectrum 
requirements and system dynamics. For any spectrum 
sharing framework, where several radio systems operate in 
the same spectrum to be a feasible and attractive, early 
cooperation across regulation, business and technology 
domains is essential. Collaboration in the technology and 
innovation domain between industry and research enables 
validation of the enabling technologies and new concepts 
while ensuring economies of scale and scope in 
implementation. Furthermore, regulation has a key enabler 
role through spectrum harmonization and providing 
incentives for early adopter while on the other hand defines 
limiting factors and competition framework. The spectrum 
regulation has played central role in the wireless ecosystems 
in creating current multibillion business ecosystems, for 
MBB operator businesses via exclusive Quality of Service 
(QoS) spectrum usage rights and at the same time for 
unlicensed Wi-Fi ecosystem drawing from the public 
spurring innovations. 
So far, only a subset of the spectrum sharing research has 
reached the regulation domain, the early studies on cognitive 
radio (CR) on license exempt access with intelligent user 
terminals and spectrum sensing as the general interference 
mitigation technique as one example. Furthermore, several 
spectrum sharing concepts widely studied, standardized and 
supported by national regulatory authorities (NRA) has not 
scaled up commercially as expected, TV White Space 
(TVWS) [3] and [4] being the latest example. Based on the 
decade of profound CR and in particular unlicensed TVWS 
concept studies, a couple of novel licensing based sharing 
models have recently emerged and are under regulatory 
discussion and early stage standardization, the Licensed 
Shared Access (LSA) [5] from Europe and the Citizens 
Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) 3 tier Spectrum Access 
System (SAS) from the US [6]. For these prominent 
spectrum sharing concepts currently under research, 
particularly the SAS, there is not much prior work available 
regarding their business model analysis. An initial evaluation 
of the general spectrum sharing concept from the business 
modeling point of view can be found in [7] and LSA focused 
analysis from [8] and [9]. That work is extended by focusing 
on more systemic, complex dynamic CBRS SAS sharing 
concept and analyzing the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) 
business opportunities using co-opetitive (co-operation and 
competition) business opportunity framework. This paper 
investigates: 
 
1) How can CBRS spectrum sharing be defined for 
MNOs? 
2) What are MNOs’ business enablers and opportunities 
regarding CBRS? 
 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, the 
CBRS 3 tier sharing framework and the SAS models are 
presented and defined for a MNO in Section II. Theoretical 
background for co-opetitive business opportunity framework 
is introduced and elements framing business opportunities 
derived and evaluated in Section III. Finally, conclusions are 
drawn in Section IV.

CITIZENS BROADBAND RADIO SERVICE SPECTRUM 
SHARING FRAMEWORK 
The key policy messages of the PCAST report were 
further strengthened in 2013 with Presidential Memorandum 
[10] stating that “…we must make available even more 
spectrum and create new avenues for wireless innovation. 
One means of doing so is by allowing and encouraging 
shared access to spectrum that is currently allocated 
exclusively for Federal use. Where technically and 
economically feasible, sharing can and should be used to 
enhance efficiency among all users and expedite commercial 
access to additional spectrum bands, subject to adequate 
interference protection for Federal users, we should also 
seek to eliminate restrictions on commercial carriers' ability 
to negotiate sharing arrangements with agencies. To further 
these efforts, while still safeguarding protected incumbent 
systems that are vital to Federal interests and economic 
growth, this memorandum directs agencies and offices to 
take a number of additional actions to accelerate shared 
access to spectrum.” 
Followed by intense discussion and consultation with the 
industry the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
released Report and Order and Second Further Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking to establish new rules for shared use 
of the 3550-3650 MHz band in April 2015 [6]. The FCC sees 
the opening of the 3.5 GHz Band as “a new chapter in the 
history of the administration of one of our nation’s most 
precious resources—the electromagnetic radio spectrum.” 
The framework defines a contiguous 150 MHz block at 
3550-3700 MHz for MBB that the FCC calls Citizens 
Broadband Radio Service. The 3550-3650 MHz spectrum is 
currently allocated for use by the US Department of Defense 
(DoD) radar systems and Fixed Satellite Services (FSS) 
while the 3650-3700 MHz spectrum incumbents are the FSS 
and the grandfathered commercial wireless broadband 
services. FCC prefigures CBRS as an “innovation band” 
where they can assign spectrum to commercial MBB 
systems like the 3GPP LTE on a shared basis with 
incumbent radar and FSS systems and promote a diversity of 
Heterogonous Network (HetNet) technologies, particularly 
small cells. The sharing framework consists of three tiers: 
Incumbent Access (IA), Priority Access (PA) and General 
Authorized Access (GAA), as shown in the Figure 1.

Figure 1.  The US CBRS 3-tiered authorization framework with the FCC’s 
spectrum access models for 3550-3650MHz and 3650-3700MHz spectrum 
segments. 
The PA users will obtain a FCC PA license (PAL) to 
operate up to 70 MHz of the 3550-3650 MHz spectrum 
segment and are protected from harmful interference from 
the GAA operations. PA layer covers critical access users 
like hospitals, utilities and governmental users and non-
critical users, e.g., MNOs. PA users receive short term 
priority 
authorization 
to 
operate 
within 
designated 
geographic areas with PALs such as 3 year 10 MHz unpaired 
channel in a single census track, awarded with competitive 
bidding. During the first application window only, an 
applicant may apply for up to two consecutive three-year 
terms for any given PAL. Licenses will be permitted to hold 
no more than four PALs in one census tract at one time. This 
will ensure availability of PAL spectrum to at least two 
licensed users in the geographic areas of highest demand. 
PALs are assigned specific frequencies within their service 
area, and their frequency assignment should not be 
dynamically controlled by the SAS database. At the end of 
its term, a PAL will automatically terminate and may not be 
renewed.  
The third GAA tier will operate under a licensed-by-rule 
framework and will be allowed throughout the 150 MHz 
band without any interference protection from other CBRS 
users. This framework aims to facilitate the rapid 
deployment of compliant small cell devices while 
minimizing administrative costs and burdens on the public, 
licensees, and the FCC. GAA users may use only certified, 
Commission approved CBRS devices and must register with 
the SAS with information required by the rules, e.g., operator 
ID, device identification, and geo-location information. 
CBRS Devices (CBSDs) which are fixed stations, or 
networks of such stations will be assigned spectrum 
dynamically by the FCC selected SAS which could be 
multiple. User equipments, e.g., handsets are not considered 
as CBSDs. SAS controls the interference environment and 
enforces exclusion zones to protect higher priority users as 
well as takes care of registration, authentication and 
identification of user information. As the IA users have 
primary spectrum rights at all times and in all areas over PA 
and GAA, all the CBRS users must be capable of operating 
across the entire 3.5 GHz band and discontinuing operation 
or changing frequencies at the direction of the SAS to protect 
IA. Automated channel assignment by a SAS will simply 
involve instructions to these users to use a specific channel, 
at a specific place and time, within 3550-3700MHz. 
It will be mandatory for all the CBRS users to protect the 
IA users in the band. Based on nature and critical 
requirements of the federal incumbent the FCC adopted rules 
to require Environmental Sensing Capabilities (ESCs) to 
detect federal spectrum use in and adjacent to the 3.5 GHz 
the band. The federal IA user protection will be adopted in 2 
phases. In the first phase, a large portion of the country 
outside the static exclusion zones will be available after SAS 
is commercially available and FCC approved, at the second 
phase, the rest of the country, including major coastal areas, 
will become available as exclusion zones will be converted 
to protection zones through the ESC system detecting federal 
incumbent use. The SAS receives input from ESCs and if 
needed, could order commercial tier users to vacate a 
40

COCORA 2016 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Cognitive Radio

spectrum resource in frequency, location, or time which 
when in proximity to federal incumbent presents a risk of 
harmful interference. Prospective ESC operators must have 
their systems approved through the same process for SASs 
and SAS administrators. An ESC consists of one or more 
commercially operated networks of device-based or 
infrastructure-based sensors that would be used to detect 
signals from federal radar systems in the vicinity of the 
exclusion zones. Within 60 seconds after the ESC 
communication of a detected federal system signal, the SAS 
must either confirm suspension or relocation of operations to 
another unoccupied frequency. 
The opportunistic GAA with no interference protection 
from other CBRS users is planned to provide a low-cost 
entry point into the CBRS band for a wide array of users and 
services first while PAL system operations have to wait 
auction process estimated to start after the US 600 MHz 
incentive auctions targeted for 2016. For the meanwhile, the 
FCC has encouraged multi-stakeholder groups to consider 
various issues raised by the rules. The Wireless Innovation 
Forum (WINNF) Spectrum Sharing Committee [11] with 
representatives from the MBB, Wireless broadband, Internet, 
Internet of Things (IoT) / machine to machine (m2m) and 
defense ecosystems has started initial standardization work 
on interfaces between a MBB system and a SAS work 
targeted to allow sharing of the CBRS within 2016. The US 
Government has initially identified an additional 2 GHz of 
spectrum below 6GHz owned by DoD and other users for 
future shared commercial use conditionally if the spectrum 
sharing at 3.5 GHz proves successful. This paves way to 
make licensed spectrum sharing a third mainstream way of 
licensing spectrum to commercial users complementing 
traditional exclusive licensing and unlicensed spectrum 
access. The FCC has vision to repeat WiFi success through 
lowering the entry barrier QoS spectrum for new entrants 
and verticals, e.g., enterprise, utilities, healthcare, public 
safety, smart cities, etc. 
III. 
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OF CBRS FOR MNOS 
A. Co-opetitive business opportunity framework 
In this section, we analyze the business opportunities of 
CBRS for MNOs. An entrepreneurial opportunity can be 
defined as the possibility to serve customers better and 
differently [12] framed by enablers, limiting factors as well 
as challenges caused by the business context. In the CBRS 
context, business opportunities are made to create and 
deliver value for the stakeholders, value that is co-created 
among various actors from MBB, wireless and incumbent 
ecosystems as a joint effort. An equally important aspect is 
the ability of the stakeholders to capture value, i.e., obtain 
profits [13], which in the context of this study can be called 
value co-capture. Furthermore, value co-creation can be seen 
as a cooperative and the parallel value co-capture as a 
competitive process [14]. The third term co-opetition 
illustrates the increased system complexity of the CBRS 
business environment, where companies simultaneously 
compete and cooperate with each other not only over 
spectrum but also over customers. Figure 2 below depicts the 
framework used in this paper to develop and frame the 
business opportunities for MNOs.

B. Analysis of the business opportunities 
In the analysis for the business opportunity elements of 
the CBRS, five key ecosystem roles are identified: the 
national regulator authority, federal incumbent, MNOs, SAS 
administrator, 
infrastructure 
vendors 
and 
device/chip 
manufactures. In the systemic framework change like CBRS, 
all the stakeholders play a vital role in adopting of novel 
CBRS concept and spectrum sharing in general. In addition 
when developing and analyzing the opportunity frame 
authors argue that three domains; regulation, business, and 
technology, affecting spectrum sharing concept should 
proceed in tandem. Enabling, limiting and challenging 
elements framing the business opportunities for the MNO are 
next discussed and listed in Table 1. 
Business and technology elements can be identified as 
enablers for value co-creation. Fast growing demand and 
lack of exclusive spectrum combined with the drastic 
changes in the consumption habits will urge the adoption of 
novel more flexible and efficient spectrum management 
concepts. Framework radically unbundles investment in 
spectrum, network infrastructure and services, which enables 
novel services and business models. Furthermore, different 
spectrum sharing schemes are high in regulators agenda with 
aims to lower the entry barrier to spectrum for new 
alternative types of operators which could consider entering 
the wireless broadband business. Utilization of the LTE 
ecosystem scale and harmonization will reduce risk related 
technology maturity and provide tools to seamlessly 
integrate additional capacity to MNOs HetNet, e.g., through 
Carrier Aggregation (CA) [15], LTE Unlicensed (LAA) [16] 
and Self Organizing Network (SON) [17] technologies. Big 
data analytics capabilities will play a major role in coping 
with the SAS dynamic requirements and enabling low 
transaction costs.  
Regarding limiting factors, sound, sustainable and 
harmonized regulatory environment can be the limiter that 
needs to be addressed before MNO can co-create and co-
capture value from it with ecosystem partners. The limited 
spectrum availability in frequency, time or location with 
potential restriction and uncertainties may negatively 
41

COCORA 2016 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Cognitive Radio

influence the MNOs outlook on shared use and the spectrum 
valuation. A specific technology item to be considered is the 
degree of business (MNOs) and mission (DoD) critical 
information needed to share and resulting need for the ESC 
system. In addition to MNO opportunities, it is essential to 
consider reciprocal incentives for the current federal 
spectrum holders to further transition to CBRS.  
Policy risk and uncertainty are the main elements of the 
co-opetitive 
challenges 
in 
the 
competitive 
domain. 
Fragmented national and global market structure deprives 
economies of scale and scope, raising costs and hampering 
innovation in the ecosystem. Furthermore, introduction of 
sharing models may influence the MNOs current exclusive 
spectrum licensing model and availability in the future. The 
regulatory approach and in particular the 3-tier concept could 
unbundle investment in spectrum, network infrastructure and 
services. Faster access to spectrum with lower initial 
investment (annuity payments for spectrum rights) enables 
local ‘pro-competitive’ deployments and further expands 
sharing mechanism for pooling spectrum and infra resources 
between operators. At the same time, the complexity of the 
CBRS framework and the SAS might influence the value of 
the spectrum and the required time of recovering the network 
investments. On the competence domain, MNOs need to pay 
attention to dynamic capabilities needed to deploy, manage 
and optimize multilayered HetNets under sharing conditions. 
Traditional MNOs support for the 3.5GHz spectrum in their 
networks is paramount to encourage chip and device 
manufacturers to support the whole 3.5GHz band 
introduction with competitive terminals. Attractive and 
dynamic spectrum market with potentially lower transaction 
costs may increase and change competition, e.g., through 
introducing new and alternative operator types locally and 
from other business domains.

In summary, in order to realize the business potential of 
the CBRS, MNOs have occasion to simultaneously co-create 
and co-capture value with ecosystem players in a co-
opetitive 
business 
environment 
where 
co-operation 
(spectrum) and competition (customers & services) exist 
parallel to each other. MNOs are in unique position to 
leverage additional multi-tiered capacity CBRS concept 
offers. Faster access to QoS licensed small cell optimized 
spectrum without mandatory coverage obligations will help 
them to timely cope with booming asymmetric data needs. 
Additional scalable and flexible spectrum resource leveraged 
with LTE technology enablers will enable MNOs to better 
retain and grow existing customer base with changing 
demand and consumer habits, offer differentiating services 
and explore new vertical segments. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
This paper discussed the transformative role of the novel 
Citizen Broadband Radio Service framework in the future 
mobile broadband networks as an endeavor to meet the 
growing 
traffic 
demand 
and 
changing 
consumption 
characteristics of the customers while paving the way to 
make licensed spectrum sharing a third mainstream way of 
licensing spectrum to commercial users complementing 
traditional exclusive licensing and unlicensed spectrum 
access. We utilized co-opetitive business opportunity 
framework for understanding mobile network operator’s 
enablers and opportunities and how they are framed from 
policy, technology, and business perspectives in the future, 
CBRS shared spectrum networks. 
We argue that policy and regulation will be on the one 
hand the key enabler in the path toward shared spectrum 
access and on the other hand will play key role in removing 
limiting and challenging elements critical in the first steps of 
that path. In particular, the sharing framework for the priority 
access licenses should be attractive and feasible to encourage 
mobile broadband industry to invest which could lower the 
barrier for change and furthermore create economies of scale 
across tiers and for the whole ecosystem.  
More flexible and scalable use of the spectrum aims to 
increase the efficiency of spectrum use in delivering fast 
growing and converging mobile broadband, media and 
Internet content to meet changing consumer needs. The 
proposed opportunities enable mobile network operators to 
retain existing customers, acquire new customers and 
strengthen overall market position by offering improved 
personalized mobile broadband data services timely. 
Furthermore, through unbundling investment in spectrum, 
network infrastructure and services co-operative business 
opportunities may open with vertical segments, new 
alternative operator types and the internet domain. 
Mobile operators are optimally positioned towards these 
business opportunities in parallel with their traditional 
business model leveraging technology enablers from mobile 
broadband 3GPP LTE evolution and big data analytics while 
waiting for the more optimized cognitive 5G solutions. 
This paper serves as a starting point for analyzing the 
business enablers, opportunities and business environment 
around CBRS. We saw that the concept of co-opetition could 
be used to characterize the business environment regarding 
spectrum sharing. However, future work is needed to expand 
research to cover also other key stakeholders and to dwell 
deeper into the framework of value co-creation, co-capture 
and co-opetition for identifying MNOs’ business models and 
ecosystem relations in the new CBRS concept and in the 
third opportunistic GAA layer in particular.
