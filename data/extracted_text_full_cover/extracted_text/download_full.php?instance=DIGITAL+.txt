DIGITAL 2021
Forward
Advances on Societal Digital Transformation (DIGITAL 2021), held between November 14 and
November 18, 2021, initiated a series of international events covering a large spectrum of topics related
to the digital transformation of our society.
The society is continuously changing with a rapid pace under digital transformation. Taking
advantage of a solid transformation of digital communications and infrastructures and with great
progress in AI (Artificial Intelligence), IoT (Internet of Thinks), ML (Machine Learning), Deep Learning, Big
Data, Knowledge acquisition and Cognitive technologies, almost all societal areas were redefined.
Transportation, Buildings, Factories, and Agriculture are now a combination of traditional and advanced
technological features. Digital citizen-centric services, including health, well-being, community
participation, learning and culture are now well-established and set to advance further on. As counter-
effects of digital transformation, notably fake news, digital identity risks and the digital divide are also
progressing in a dangerous rhythm, there is a major need for digital education, fake news awareness,
and legal aspects mitigating sensitive cases.
We take here the opportunity to warmly thank all the members of the DIGITAL 2021 technical
program committee, as well as all the reviewers. The creation of such a high-quality conference program
would not have been possible without their involvement. We also kindly thank all the authors who
dedicated much of their time and effort to contribute to DIGITAL 2021. We truly believe that, thanks to
all these efforts, the final conference program consisted of top-quality contributions. We also thank the
members of the DIGITAL 2021 organizing committee for their help in handling the logistics of this event.

Abstract - “Fake news” has become a common buzzword in 
public, political, and scientific debates. Whereas the definition 
of the term and its political consequences are often highlighted, 
this paper seeks to provide an overview of the development, the 
most common dimensions of fake news, and their mode of 
action. Research shows that fake news can trigger and act in 
conjunction with numerous effects that influence recipients. A 
comprehensive overview of these effects is given in this paper. 
 Keywords 
- 
fake 
news; social 
media; 
misinformation; 
disinformation.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
In 1835, the New York Sun published a story by Richard 
Adam Locke saying that the renowned astronomer Sir John 
Herschel discovered life on the moon. The story was 
published for of a few days with new information about the 
discovery including the geography, lunar vegetation, and the 
inhabitants: bat-people. The story was reprinted by other 
papers and the New York Sun’s circulation increased from 
about 4.000 daily sales to 19.000 [1]. Of course, the Great 
Moon Hoax was made up by Locke without the knowledge 
of Herschel who was not amused to see his name used [2]. 
Locke later explained that he intended to write a satire and 
never meant it to be a hoax; his goal was to mock the 
gullibility of Americans and their belief in extraterrestrial life 
[2]. Locke’s famous news stunt would probably be called 
fake news today. In recent history, the term “fake news” is 
heavily associated with the emergence of social media or the 
role it played in the 2016 US general election [3]. Since the 
incident at a press conference in the White House on 
February 16, 2017, when the then President Donald Trump 
called CNN media representatives "fake news", refusing to 
allow any questions, the term has become a hot topic in the 
scientific discussion about modern and social media [4]. 
However, the frequent use and popularity of the term led to a 
more and more blurred understanding and vastly different 
interpretations among scholars and the general population, 
leaving it unclear as to what is considered fake news [5]. It is 
further unclear what mechanisms of action of fake news are 
prevalent in social media.  
In order to grasp fake news as a whole, a comprehensive 
understanding 
of 
the 
associated 
mechanisms 
and 
dissemination methods is important. Above all, this is 
necessary to recognize all aspects and occurrences of false 
and misinformation in social media. This work aims to 
provide a uniform view and to deliver a basic systematization 
of all dimensions of fake news and its prevalence in modern 
media.  
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In order to 
classify the fuzzy concept of fake news, we will present the 
historical development of the term fake news in Section 2. In 
Section 3, we will discuss the methodology used to capture 
all dimensions of the phenomenon of fake news. We will 
present the results of a comprehensive literature and study 
analysis and characterize a total of 28 dimensions of fake 
news. In the final section, we evaluate the dangers of fake 
news, classify the results of this study, and provide an outlook 
for future studies. 
II. 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF FAKE NEWS 
The term "fake news" was recorded in lexicons in the 
USA as early as the late 19th century. Prior to that, the term 
"false news" was used [6]. Originally used to refer to made-
up or false news [7], today the term “fake news” is also used 
to refer to false news on social media, to undermine work by 
news outlets [8] [9] or to describe fabricated news in satirical 
contributions [10]. Fake news is often described as 
intentionally 
deceptive 
[3][11]. 
Other 
sources 
also 
acknowledge the possibility that the dissemination of fake 
news may also happen unintentionally [6][12]. Apart from 
the pure intention to deceive, other motivations, such as 
political ideologies or financial goals, are sometimes also 
attributed to creators of fake news [3]. Similarly, some 
sources define fake news as being written in a way that has 
news characteristics [9][13]. For some authors, online 
dissemination is an important aspect of fake news [14] or 
even a characteristic of it [15], while other sources do not pay 
particular attention to it [6]. Some definitions require fake 
news to be completely false, i.e., to have no basis of fact 
underneath [3][16], which raises the issue of classifying half-
truths and manipulating the context with a "core of truth". 
Tandoc et al. address this problem by distinguishing high and 
low levels of "facticity” [9]. Another approach to the 
argument is to call something "fake news" only if the 
intended deception has succeeded, otherwise, it is just fiction 
[9]. In a contrasting theory, fake news does not necessarily 
have to be believed in order to be considered as such [17]. In 
contrast to lies, fake news has less socially motivated

purposes, such as protecting oneself or avoiding harm, but 
rather serves those who create it to achieve financial or 
political goals or to promote themselves [18].  
It becomes clear that the definition of the term determines 
the time of recognition and what is counted as fake news; 
therefore, historical examples or its different types and sub-
categories vary. In this work, the term fake news refers to the 
deliberate dissemination of erroneous information by the 
creator with the intent to deceive. 
Examples of fake news could be documented in the pre-
printing press era. While the invention of the printing press 
and the spread of literacy helped the spread of knowledge, it 
also resulted in its monetization [19].  Information became a 
commodity that could be produced, published, and sold in a 
high number of copies. Through the 17th century in France, 
false stories became very popular on printed broadsides: the 
so-called “canards” [19]. Progressing in history, mass media 
and the press have had an important role in the spread of 
hoaxes.  
Fake news today differs from the historical examples due 
to the instant and global distribution through the new media 
and the “systemic ways in which fake news mobilizes our 
cognitive biases and heuristics” [20]. The motivations did not 
change, but they increased on a global level: young 
Macedonian people spreading fake news for the US election 
2016 with no other interest than money, Donald Trump 
defining established mainstream media as “fake news“ or the 
famous so-called “pizzagate“ conspiracy theory which 
culminated in a shooting [10][20][21]. Spreading real or fake 
news through online media and social networks led to an 
enormous amount of information, making it more difficult to 
classify its validity. In addition, producers of fake news make 
use of the design of established news sources disguising their 
origin and intent [8]. Therefore, the consequences of fake 
news combined with social media are toxic and explosive 
because they make it possible for the creator to target an 
audience specifically and manipulate cognitive biases 
[20][22]. These dimensions of fake news, which can be direct 
effects of fake news or work in conjunction with them, are 
described next. 
III. 
THE DIMENSIONS OF FAKE NEWS 
To obtain information on the development and impact of 
fake news, first, a broad literature search was conducted via 
Google Scholar using the search terms "fake news” and “fake 
news effects”. Since this search term delivers over half a 
million search results, the search was further narrowed down 
to results that deal with fake news and its effects on people. 
After reviewing over 500 articles, 28 different effects or 
mechanisms of action could be identified. To examine these 
more closely, a snowball and depth-first search was then 
carried out for each effect. 
The creators of fake news often use various mechanisms 
or effects that work in conjunction with fake news and can 
make false information more effective for the recipient, 
amplify 
existing 
effects 
or 
immunize 
against 
counterarguments. These dimensions can be used by the 
creators of fake news. However, some dimensions that can 
play a significant role in the effectiveness of fake news are 
not necessarily used purposefully. Instead, these can result 
from the recipient's environment or handling of fake news. In 
TABLE I, common influential dimensions and effects in 
conjunction with fake news are listed and explained in 
alphabetical order according to their most common name (if 
available). 
 
TABLE I.  DIMENSIONS OF "FAKE NEWS". 
Dimension 
Explanation 
Astroturfing 
Astroturfing is an attempt to convey an incorrect 
impression of public opinion, e.g. by feigning 
that a large majority of people is in favor of a 
certain decision. In contrast to a “grassroots 
movement“, however, the population is not 
actually behind it, but it is organized by a covert 
initiator [23]–[27].   
Even though it is not a new phenomenon [28], 
astroturfing can spread more effectively by 
means of the Internet [29][30]. 
Availability 
Cascade 
Individuals tend to adopt the views of others 
when those views gain popularity in their social 
environment [31]–[33]. Informational cascades 
and reputational cascades can make this possible 
through different motivations and may occur 
together [32].   
Availability 
heuristic 
The probability of events is measured by how 
available a similar event is in memory. So a 
recent or frequent reporting of certain events 
ensures that they are considered more likely 
[34]–[40]. This also applies if these reports are 
purely thought-provoking [41].  
Backfire effect 
It was found that subjects believed even more 
strongly in the original, incorrect information 
after it had been corrected [42][43]. It is 
assumed that this effect only occurs in specific 
situations, since it could not be proven with 
another experimental setup [44]–[47]. If 
judgements are formed immediately during 
reception, backfire effects can be reduced [48]. 
Research suggests that emotions may be 
relevant in this process [49]. Additional research 
is needed [50]. This can also be called 
“boomerang effect” [51][52]. 
Bandwagon 
effect 
This refers to the assumption that if other people 
perceive something as good, it will also be 
judged good by oneself [53]–[55]. Own 
opinions are formed on the basis of other 
people’s opinions. This phenomenon has also 
been observed in online reviews, for example 
[55][56].  
Clickbait 
Information gaps created by news titles arouse 
the potential reader's curiosity for the rest of the 
article. Often a forward reference is used, which 
refers to further information in the article [57]–
[59]. This may increase the readership of an 
article but does not necessarily have further 
negative effects [60].  
Confirmation 
bias 
People unconsciously prefer information that 
coincides with their own opinion. If it does, they 
consider it more credible [61]–[66]. It is 
suspected that this contributes to the emergence 
of echo chambers and filter bubbles [67].  
Conservatism 
bias 
This refers to the tendency of individuals to 
inadequately adjust their attitudes when 
2
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2021.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-927-0
DIGITAL 2021 : Advances on Societal Digital Transformation

confronted with new information [64][68]–[70]. 
Thus, if a person already believes in fake news, 
their beliefs are difficult to correct. 
Continued 
influence effect 
Even the negation and correction of incorrect 
original information usually cannot completely 
reverse its effect. It continues to influence the 
recipient [71]–[76], even when warnings are 
given [77]. This effect is weakened if instead of 
a simple correction a suitable alternative 
explanation for a scenario is offered [78]. Partly 
this may be because recipients do not accept a 
correction [79]. This is also called "belief 
perseverance" [70][80]. 
Echo chamber 
effect 
If users mainly interact with other users or 
institutions that have a similar opinion to their 
own, an echo chamber is created. The users thus 
reinforce each other's opinions [81]–[83]. The 
confirmation bias works in a similar way. Often, 
however, users are not completely isolated, but 
continue to be confronted with opposing 
content, especially online [84]–[87]. Thus, this 
effect may not be as strong as initially 
perceived.  
Emotional 
memory 
enhancement 
Emotionally charged information is better 
retained than neutral information [88]–[92]. 
Suggestion has an even stronger effect than pure 
emotionality [92].  
Filter bubble 
This term refers to information bubbles that are 
created in social media in particular and in 
which algorithms select or pre-filter content that 
is then displayed to the user. This content often 
corresponds to existing interests. Users are often 
unaware of the filter bubble [93]–[97]. Thus, no 
contrary opinions are displayed that could 
invalidate fake news. This effect is similar to 
echo chambers. It is still debated whether filter 
bubbles exist and are problematic as some 
evidence points against it [87][95][98][99].  
Framing effect 
Small changes in context or in the way 
information is conveyed can lead to a major 
change in decision-making behavior [100]–
[102]. Emotions may be an important aspect of 
this [103][104]. The effect of framing can be 
reduced through warnings  [105][106].   
Google effect 
People tend not to remember information in 
itself, but instead where it can be found when 
needed [107][108]. Thus, insufficient 
background knowledge of a person might not be 
enough to counter fake news. 
Hostile media 
effect 
Biased subjects feel disadvantaged by media 
coverage, even if a large proportion of recipients 
perceive it as appropriate [109]–[114]. The 
disadvantage is perceived to be unfavorable of 
one's own opinion. This may reduce belief in the 
correction of fake news by major news outlets. 
Illusory 
truth 
effect 
Statements that are heard several times are 
attributed a higher truth value than statements 
that are heard for the first time [115]–[118]. 
This means that repetition increases the 
probability that a statement will be considered 
true. This is true even if the plausibility of the 
statement is low [119] or in the case of warnings 
against it [120]. This effect is also referred to as 
the "validity effect" [121].   
Implied 
truth 
effect 
If other news is recognized or labeled as fake 
news, but one is not, it is more likely to be 
considered true [122]. However, this effect may 
be small [123].  
Informational 
cascade 
People who lack complete information on a 
subject may rely on the perceived beliefs of 
others [32][124]–[126]. A decision is made 
based on the decisions of others, even ignoring 
personal knowledge, expecting the crowd to be 
right. This is called an “informational cascade” 
or “information cascade”. This way, fake news 
can be propagated through a network. The 
strength of ties of a person to the other people in 
their group may influence their decision-making 
behavior [127]. Self-corrections by further 
cascades are possible [128]. 
Misdirecting 
Misdirecting is employed when contextual 
hashtags are used in social media, but a 
completely different topic is being reported on 
[129]. To do this en masse, social bots can be 
used. This distracts from the actual topic and 
actual information is lost in the amount of news 
[130]. In another study, this could not be 
detected [131]. 
Misinformatio
n effect 
Untruthful reporting following an event 
damages the correct memory of that event 
[132]–[137]. Later corrections may be able to 
reduce that effect [138].   
Negativity bias 
People have a tendency to give more weight to 
negative information than to positive 
information [66][139]–[144].  
Primacy effect 
& 
Recency 
effect 
Information that a recipient takes in first has a 
stronger impact on them than the information 
that follows (primacy effect). Likewise, the 
information received last remains in the memory 
longer (recency effect) [145]–[149]. The 
primacy effect may be stronger than the recency 
effect [147]–[150].  
Reputational 
cascade 
Like with the informational cascade, people 
base their decisions on the decisions of their 
peers. However, here they do so regardless of 
their own thoughts because they are motivated 
to earn social approval and avoid disapproval 
[32][151][152]. Because of the perceived social 
pressure, this cascade may be more resilient 
than informational cascades [153]. 
Reputation 
heuristic 
Instead of checking the content of a source’s 
information, the source itself is checked for 
credibility. If the source has a good reputation 
or is considered credible, the information is 
more likely to be believed [73][154]–[157]. If 
fake news creators succeed in imitating a 
credible source, their credibility increases. 
Rumor 
refutation 
Rumors on social media that are incorrect take 
longer to be resolved than true rumors. 
Unverified rumors are often shared earlier and 
reach a larger user base than resolved rumors 
[158][159].  
Smoke 
screening 
Smoke screening works like misdirecting with 
the difference that at least similar content to a 
hashtag is posted [129]–[131].  
Tainted 
truth 
effect 
Warnings of false information issued 
erroneously in relation to truthful content can 
damage the credibility of the truthful 
information [137][160][161].  
3

DIGITAL 2021 : Advances on Societal Digital Transformation

Third 
person 
effect 
People tend to believe that mass media 
influence other people more strongly than they 
influence themselves [162]–[167]. As a result, 
the influence of fake news on oneself can be 
underestimated. 
 
Human memory can be affected by internal and external 
influences and is not infallible [92]. The effects of fake news 
that operate in this context are presented in this paper. Fake 
news can initially be an external influence with numerous 
associated effects on a person's perception. How strong the 
impact of these effects ultimately turns out also depends on 
the internal circumstances of this person. While some 
personal characteristics may support the effect of fake news, 
others weaken it. The susceptibility to fake news can be 
influenced, for example, by a tendency toward analytical 
thinking [168], skeptical attitudes [168], emotions [169], 
frequency of media use [3], conditions of one's own networks 
[3][168][173], age [170], and the culture from which 
someone comes [171][172]. Some effects may bypass some 
of these factors by operating at a low cognitive level [168].  
Numerous other, even previously undiscovered or 
unexplored internal possibilities of influence by a subject's 
personality or attitude may exist. Thus, in addition to further 
investigation of the effects of fake news, a closer look at the 
recipients of fake news and their circumstances also offers 
research potential for the future. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
Fake news has been with mankind for a long time and has 
made multiple appearances in the past. Although the 
phenomenon of fake news may not be new, it is crucial to 
understand that the latest developments are a danger to 
democratic societies. In this work, the basis for the 
understanding of various phenomena in the field of fake news 
is laid in order to ensure a holistic view of the topic for future 
research projects. Fake news can be spread particularly easily 
and quickly through modern technologies such as social 
media. Furthermore, it is evident that fake news and its 
impact should be considered within the respective cultural, 
social and political contexts [10]. This makes the dimensions 
with which fake news works even more relevant for current 
discussions, even more so when emotions are considered 
more valuable than facts [21]. Since it has been shown that 
fake news can influence a person's opinion formation in 
numerous ways, a danger to opinion formation in society as 
a whole is possible. Therefore, especially regarding the 
aspects of opinion formation and freedom of expression, 
attention should be paid to fake news and, if necessary, its 
spread should be curbed. The dimensions of fake news 
presented in this paper can be used in further work and serve 
as a reference standard to better classify and categorize fake 
news effects in social media, but also beyond. In this way, 
further studies could investigate which effects are 
particularly prevalent in the various social media.

Abstract—For patients suffering from a stroke, the time until 
the start of the treatment is a crucial factor with respect to the 
recovery from this condition. In rural regions, transporting the 
patient to an adequate hospital typically delays the diagnosis 
and treatment of a stroke, worsening its prognosis. To reduce 
the time to treatment, different policies can be applied. This 
includes, for instance, the use of Mobile Stroke Units (MSUs), 
which are specialized ambulances that can provide adequate 
care closer to where the stroke occurred. To simulate and 
assess different stroke logistics policies, such as the use of 
MSUs, a major challenge is the realistic modeling of the 
patients. In this article, we present an approach for generating 
an artificial population of stroke patients to simulate when and 
where strokes occur. We apply the model to the region of 
Skåne, where we investigated the relevance of travel behavior 
on the spatial distribution of stroke patients.

 INTRODUCTION 
Every year, more than 1 million people in the European 
Union suffer from a stroke and the one-month case-fatality is 
up to 35% [1]. The occurrence of strokes is associated with 
the age of the individual and most of those suffering from a 
stroke are 70 years of age or older. Hence, as the number of 
people that are older than 70 years will increase, the number 
of strokes is also expected to increase [2][3].  
 There are two types of acute strokes, acute ischemic 
strokes (AIS), where a clot or narrowed blood vessel blocks 
the flow of blood to the brain, and hemorrhagic strokes, 
caused by a burst blood vessel [4]. Both types of strokes 
require immediate treatment and delays negatively affect the 
patients’ outcomes. Yet, the treatment of these two kinds of 
strokes differs greatly. To dissolve the blood clot and to 
restore the blood flow, an AIS needs to be treated with 
thrombolytic medication as quickly as possible. In case of 
hemorrhagic strokes, however, there is a contraindication for 
thrombolysis as it might kill the patient. Instead, the effect of 
blood thinners must be counteracted to control and stop the 
bleeding. Hence, making the right diagnosis is a vital first 
step for the efficient treatment of strokes.  
Imaging of the brain, e.g., through CT or MRI scans, and 
specific laboratory tests are required to adequately diagnose 
the cause of a stroke. However, especially in urban areas, the 
access to such scanners and laboratories is limited and the 
patient needs to be transported to a suitable hospital, causing 
valuable time to pass. A stroke logistics policy that can be 
applied to address this challenge is the deployment of Mobile 
Stroke Units (MSUs), which are specialized ambulances 
with all equipment required to diagnose stroke patients. 
Through this, the time between the onset of symptoms and 
the beginning of treatment of the stroke can be shortened, 
which significantly can improve the prognosis of the 
patients. The feasibility of this concept and its capability to 
prevent brain damage of stroke patients was demonstrated by 
Walter et al. [5].  
To investigate the suitability and effects of stroke 
logistics policies for a specific region, computer simulation 
can be used. This allows for investigating different policies 
under realistic conditions without jeopardizing the health of 
the patients as they can be analyzed and compared in an 
artificial system. The use of simulation in healthcare is well 
established. Barnes et al. [6], for instance, provide a 
comprehensive overview of how simulation can be applied 
in healthcare operations management and underline the 
successful application of simulation for evaluating policy 
alternatives. An increasing application of simulation in 
healthcare has also been identified by Almagooshi [7], e.g., 
for the analysis of patient flows, emergency departments, and 
treatment of, e.g., stroke. 
A major challenge when simulating stroke logistics is the 
modeling of the patients’ whereabouts. For instance, in terms 
of MSUs, where the number of vehicles is limited, the 
locations of the MSUs should be determined such that the 
time to treatment can be reduced for all inhabitants of the 
region. To this end, Amouzad Mahdiraji et al. [8] studied the 
average time to treatment for different distributions of MSUs 
and showed that a small number of MSUs can indeed 
significantly reduce the time to treatment for most 
inhabitants in the region. For their study, the authors used 
demographic data on the inhabitants’ place of residence for 
determining where the demand for emergency care occurs. 
However, this does not consider that individuals travel and 
might not be at home when having a stroke, for instance, due 
to leisure activities, shopping, or work. Yet, the spatial 
distribution of strokes potentially affects the suitability of 
different stroke logistics policies and, thus, might need to be 
considered when assessing their suitability. 
In this article, we present an agent-based model for 
generating a synthetic population of stroke patients and to 
simulate their travel behavior. This allows for testing 
different policies without jeopardizing the health of the 
patients. We apply this model to the region of Skåne in 
southern Sweden to investigate how travel behavior is 
expected to affect the spatial distribution of stroke patients. 
Moreover, the generated synthetic population of stroke 
patients can be used to assess different stroke logistics

policies, e.g., to compare different placements of MSUs and 
to assess how this affects the time to treatment. 
The rest of the article is structured as follows. Section II 
presents related work on the use of agent-based modeling 
and simulation in healthcare, on policy making for treatment 
of acute strokes, and on methods for population generation. 
In Section III, the model for generating a population of 
stroke patients with travel behavior is presented. Section IV 
presents and discusses the results of the case study in Skåne, 
Sweden, and in Section V, conclusions are drawn, and future 
work is presented. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
Diagnosis and treatment processes in healthcare often 
include multiple consecutive steps and involve different 
specialists and caregivers. Planning and optimizing such 
complex processes are challenging and requires the 
comparison of potential configurations under different 
circumstances. Evaluating these processes in the real-world 
prior to their implementation might not only be costly and 
time consuming but also pose a danger to the patients’ well-
being. To overcome this, simulation can be used. By 
building a virtual model of the real-world, an artificial 
system can be created to investigate different scenarios and 
to observe the effects different measures and decisions 
might have on the process of care provision.  
A. Agent-based modeling and simulation in healthcare 
There exist different simulation paradigms, i.e., 
approaches for modeling and simulating phenomena or 
systems. In healthcare, as well as in other domains where 
humans are the object of investigation, individual-based 
simulation paradigms are often applied. An example is 
agent-based simulation (ABS), a form of microsimulation, 
which consists of the simulation of states and behavior of 
individuals over time [9]. Here, each individual is 
represented by an agent, an autonomous entity that, for 
example, imitates human-like behavior and reasoning. This 
includes the subjective perception of the environment but 
also the individual decision making based on the personal 
traits and characteristics of each individual, which leads to 
individual actions and behavior. 
In logistics and production, for instance, the use of 
simulation is well established [10]. But also in healthcare, 
for instance in terms of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the 
use of simulation is feasible [11]. Cabrera et al. [12] use 
simulation for designing a decision support system that can 
provide management support for emergency departments. 
This is achieved by analyzing the optimal staff 
configuration to minimize patients’ waiting time and 
maximize patient throughput. A more extensive simulation 
model of hospital processes has been proposed by 
Djanatliev & German [13]. It combines individual-based 
simulation with system dynamics for analyzing different 
innovative workflows prior to their implementation, e.g., 
prostate cancer screening and effects of MSUs on onset-to-
treatment times. 
Simulations of stroke treatment were presented by, for 
instance, Monks et al. [14] and Chemweno et al. [15]. 
Monks et al. investigate clinical benefits of reducing delays 
in thrombolysis (alteplase) of AIS patients. They propose a 
discrete-event simulation model of stroke patients arriving 
at a large district hospital, where measures can be adopted to 
reduce in-hospital delays (e.g., prealert of paramedics) and 
where certain limitations of alteplase treatment (i.e., 
extension of treatment deadline from 3 to 4.5 hours and 
patient age over 80 years) can be relaxed. To assess and 
compare the benefits of policies for reducing waiting times, 
the authors model two treatment paths, the traditional 
treatment and one that takes measures into account for 
reducing in-hospital delays. The results show that an 
extension of the time window in combination with reduced 
delays can lead to 5-times increased thrombolysis rates. 
Chemweno et al. present a discrete-event simulation of the 
diagnostic path of patients in a stroke unit to investigate the 
effect of different test capacities. This is to overcome 
shortcomings of traditional queuing theory models, which 
cannot predict waiting times due to the complexity of 
treatment pathways and interrelationships between required 
resources. This allows for the assessment of policy changes 
in capacity profiles and test resources. The study outlines 
the effects different policies might have on waiting times, 
e.g., adding extra timeslots, shifting from MR to CT scans, 
and implementing joint timeslots.  
B. Policies for Treatment of Acute Strokes 
For the treatment of acute ischemic strokes, intravenous 
thrombolysis to dissolve the blood clot is the only approved 
reperfusion 
treatment 
[16]. 
However, 
according 
to 
Fassbender et al. [17], only less than 5% of the stroke 
patients receive this therapy. One potential explanation is 
that the critical time window of 3 hours is exceeded due to 
the transport to the hospital. To reduce the time to treatment, 
the use of Mobile Stroke Units (MSUs) was proposed, i.e., 
specialized vehicles that are equipped with devices required 
for adequately diagnosing and treating stroke patients. 
Walter et al. [5] compared the use of MSUs to hospital 
treatment and found that the time from alarm to therapy 
could be reduced from 76 to 35 minutes. Calderon et al. [18] 
analyzed the worldwide status of MSUs and compared 
different services outlining the success of the approach. The 
economic viability of MSU treatment was analyzed by Kim 
et al. [19], underlining its cost-effectiveness due to earlier 
provision of therapy.  
The success of MSUs and their effect on treatment times 
also depends on where they are located. Rhudy et al. [20] 
visually analyzed data of MSU dispatches and the 
occurrence of strokes to optimize service provision. For 
Sydney, Australia, Phan et al. [21] searched for optimal 
locations for MSUs by investigating travel times from 
suburbs to each potential MSU hub. For a similar purpose, 
Amouzad Mahdiraji et al. [8] developed an agent-based 
model that allows for analyzing the benefits of different 
MSU configurations. In their study, Amouzad Mahdiraji et 
al. investigated the average time to treatment for different 
distributions of MSUs and showed that a small number of 
MSUs can significantly reduce the time to treatment for 
most inhabitants in the region. Moreover, agent-based 
12

simulation can also be used to assess other stroke logistics 
policies, e.g., whether patients should be brought to the 
closest hospital or to a specialized thrombectomy center 
[22]. To assess this, Al Fatah et al. developed a simulation 
model of logistical operations of stroke patients, i.e., 
whether patients should be transported to the closest 
hospital or towards a stroke center. The results showed that 
those patients that require special treatment indeed benefit 
from being transported in the direction of a stroke center 
whereas those who do not require specialist treatment 
benefit from being transported to the closest hospital.  
None of the presented approaches takes travel behavior 
into consideration when investigating and optimizing 
locations and service designs of MSUs. Instead, individuals 
are assumed to stay at their home location, which can be 
derived from census data or randomly selected using Monte 
Carlo approaches [22]. 
C. Population Generation 
To generate realistic results when applying agent-based 
simulation, individuals and their behavior must be modeled 
in a realistic way. Especially when modeling a larger 
population of individuals, it is important that the relevant 
features of the artificial population, e.g., age distribution or 
employment status, correspond to those of the original 
population. However, due to privacy reasons, data on each 
individual’s properties is usually not available. The 
challenge associated with synthetic population generation is 
that aggregated data, e.g., census data, and disaggregated 
personal data need to be combined to model each individual, 
such that the characteristics of the modeled population 
correspond to the used input data [23][24]. In transportation, 
for instance, population generation is used to model 
individual demand for mobility services [25][26]. 
III. 
AN AGENT-BASED MODEL FOR GENERATING A 
POPULATION OF STROKE PATIENTS WITH TRAVEL BEHAVIOR 
To allow for a more dynamic and realistic assessment of 
stroke logistics policies, we developed an agent-based 
model that takes travel behavior of individuals into account. 
To this end, we generate a synthetic population of potential 
stroke patients, combining socio-demographic census data, 
data on real strokes cases from a healthcare provider, and 
travel data from a transport service provider. This allows for 
the simulation of the dynamical spatial and the temporal 
component of stroke occurrence and treatment.  
For the study, we selected Skåne, a region in southern 
Sweden. Skåne consists of approximately 1.4 million 
inhabitants, that live in 33 municipalities with a total area of 
nearly 11 000 km2. In Skåne, there are 9 hospitals with 
emergency departments that can treat acute strokes. In 2015, 
there were 3 973 stroke incidents recorded in Skåne out of 
which 3 830 patients also live in Skåne. Moreover, 12 
patients that have their place of residence in Skåne were 
treated in the neighboring counties Kronoberg, Blekinge, or 
Halland and most of the patients are 45 years of age and 
older. Based on data from the regional healthcare provider, 
Södra Sjukvårdsregionen (Southern Health Care Region; 
SHR), we derived the daily distribution of strokes per hour 
(see Figure 1). Most strokes are reported during the 
afternoon with most of the incidents occurring around 4 
p.m.  
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Total number of strokes per hour extracted from data of the 
regional healthcare provider. 
To model travel behavior, we used data from a regional 
travel survey (Resvaneundersökning för Skåne; RVU) that 
was conducted in Skåne in 2013 [27]. As part of this study, 
travelers were asked about their traveling habits and the 
resulting dataset contains information on approximately 
56 000 distinct trips. This includes, for instance, the origin, 
destination, duration, and purpose of the trip but also socio-
demographic data on the travellers, e.g., age, gender, and 
place of residence.  
Finally, for generating a realistic population, we used a 
census dataset from Statistiska centralbyrån (Statistics 
Sweden; SCB), the Swedish government agency for 
statistics. The SCB dataset includes, for instance, 
information of the density and age of the population of 
Skåne. Yet, this data only provides information on the 
permanent residence of individuals and not on their actual 
location. To allocate the anonymized trips of the RVU 
dataset to actual individuals from the SCB dataset, we 
randomly match the datasets based on the individuals’ age 
group and home municipality.  
For modeling the inter-arrival time of stroke incidents, 
we used a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) [28]. 
In contrast to ordinary Poisson processes, that are used to 
model events that occur with a fixed average rate of arrivals 
(λ), the rate of arrivals can vary over time in an NHPP 
where λ(t) is the rate function for time segment t for all  
t ∈ [0, t0] and λu(t) is the maximum number of actions in a 
time series with 0 ≤ λ(t) ≤ λu(t). By this means, we can 
explicitly model the accumulation of stroke events during 
the afternoon. In our NHPP, we divide each day into 24 time 
segments, each equipped with a specific probability that a 
stroke occurs during this hour in relation to the number of 
strokes occurring per day.  
Based on the generated number of daily stroke incidents, 
we define two probability mass functions to distribute 
strokes across age groups and municipalities. These two 
distributions are then used to generate stroke incidents. Each 
generated stroke event consists of the patient’s age group, 
municipality, day of the year, and time of the day. This 
dataset is then matched with the population dataset, to 
13

predetermine the stroke patients as well as the point in time 
when the stroke will occur.  
When executing the model, the travel behavior, i.e., each 
trip of an individual, and the resulting locations of each 
individual of the population is simulated over time. The 
generated NHPP events define when the individual stroke 
incidents occur, and, at the generated time of each stroke 
incident, the individual’s current location can be determined 
based on the simulated trips.  
In recent years, ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and 
Details) protocols have been used to describe the structure 
and the dynamics of agent-based models in a standardized 
document [29]. They provide more detailed insights into the 
model and the underlying assumptions, which can be 
relevant for the interpretation of the results as well as for 
replicating experiments. The ODD of the model presented in 
this article can be found in [30].

IV. 
RESULTS OF THE SCENARIO STUDY IN SKÅNE 
We implemented the agent-based model of stroke patient 
travel behavior in the Repast Simphony simulation 
framework [31]. In the simulation, each time unit (tick) 
corresponds to 1 minute in reality. Hence, each day is 
simulated as 1440 ticks. For each tick, it is determined 
whether an individual will go on a trip and move to another 
location. When the predetermined stroke events occur, it is 
checked whether the individual is on a trip, to determine 
where the stroke occurred. 
The probability distributions that we extracted from the 
dataset are shown in Figure 2. The charts show the real data 
(orange) in comparison to the NHPP events we calculated 
(blue). There are only minor deviations from the original 
data for the stroke incidents per hour, per municipality, and 
per age group. To quantify how well the artificial data 
replicates the original data, the Relative Squared Error 
(RSE) and Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE) are given as 
measures. No significant deviation of the generated data 
from the real data can be observed considering the hour of 
the day (RRSE: 0.160) and the age group (RSSE: 0.046). 
Only for the municipalities in Skåne, a difference can be 
observed for Malmö (RRSE: 0.259). This might be due to a 
bias, which results from Malmö’s role as center of the 
region and as the city has notably more inhabitants 
compared to all other cities and municipalities in Skåne.,  
Instead of simulating all inhabitants of Skåne, we only 
simulated the trip activities of those individuals that were 
predetermined to suffer from a stroke. This is to reduce the 
computational complexity of the simulation. To reduce the 
effect of stochastic variations in the results, we replicated 
the simulation five times and calculated the average values 
from these runs. 
On average, 3 912 strokes occur in our simulation. The 
results indicate that 3 839 (98.1%) strokes occur at home 
whereas 73 (1.9%) strokes happen while the individual is on 
a trip and at another location. To check the plausibility of 
these results and to validate the study, we compare them to 
existing data. In the RVU travel data, only 15% of the 
recorded trips are performed by individuals that are 65 years 
of age or older, the main risk group for suffering from a 
stroke. Out of these trips, only 35% are taken in the 
afternoon, which is the time of the day where the occurrence 
of a stroke is most likely. 
Moreover, we analyzed the dataset of stroke incidents 
from SHR. Out of 3 842 stroke incidents of patients that live 
in Skåne, which were recorded within SHR, 3 830 actually 
got their treatment in Skåne. 3 106 (80.84%) of the patients 
that got a treatment in Skåne also got it within their 
municipality or at the hospital that is responsible for their 
municipality. Out of the remaining 736 patients (19.16%) 
that did receive their treatment at another hospital, 497 
patients live in municipalities where the responsible hospital 
does not provide emergency services around the clock. Of 
the remaining 239 patients, 80 were treated at Skåne 
University Hospital, which also provides highly specialized 
treatments for severe cases, 57 received treatment at private 
facilities, whose exact location is unknown, and 59 were 
treated at a hospital in a neighboring municipality, which 
might be due to the patients living closer to the hospital in 
the neighboring municipality. In total, only 46 patients 
(1.2%) receive their treatment obviously outside their home 
municipality, where it can be assumed that they were 
traveling. This corresponds to the results of our simulation.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this article, we address the challenge of generating a 
realistic population of stroke patients, which takes travel 
behavior into account. Such an artificial population of stroke 
patients is required in agent-based simulations and allows 
for the assessment of different stroke logistics policies, such 
as the optimal placement of MSUs across a region. We used 
aggregated and individual-based data from different sources, 
from which we derived probability distributions that were 
then used to generate an artificial population of agents. 
To demonstrate the feasibility of the presented approach, 
we used data from the region of Skåne in southern Sweden. 
In the presented study, we simulated the travel behavior of 
stroke patients to investigate where strokes occur. Through 
this, a better understanding of the spatial distribution of 
stroke occurrence is achieved. This is relevant, for instance, 
for the optimal distribution of MSUs, such that the time to 
treatment is reduced for stroke patients. 
Our results show that the generated artificial population 
corresponds to the real data in terms of the time of the day at 
which strokes occur, the distribution of strokes across the 
municipalities, and the age group of the patients. In total, 
approximately 1.9% of the strokes occur while the 
individual is on a trip and not in their municipality of 
residence. This observation corresponds to data on strokes 
that was provided by the healthcare provider. Hereby, were 
able to show by means of simulation that traveling only has 
a minor impact on where strokes occur and, thus, for policy 
making in stroke logistics. 
The generated artificial population of stroke patients is 
based on socio-demographic, healthcare, and travel data of 
the investigated region, to ensure the realistic representation 
of the real-world population. Yet, the presented model can 
also be applied to other regions, assuming that the required 
input data is accessible. This facilitates the conducting of 
agent-based simulation studies for investigating the effects 
different stroke logistics policies might have. It also 
increases the credibility of the simulation results such that 
conclusions can be drawn regarding the real world. 
As part of future work, we plan to incorporate the results 
from the population generation into simulations for 
assessing and comparing different policies for stroke 
logistics. Moreover, we intend to investigate and include 
seasonality effects into the model, i.e., tourists that come to 
the region and changed travel behavior during weekends.

provision of the anonymized data on the occurrence of 
strokes in Skåne.

Abstract—This work-in-progress paper examines adolescents’ 
experiences with personalized content on social media and how 
it influences them. Through group interviews with Norwegian 
students aged 15 to 19 years, we investigated their awareness, 
comprehension, 
and 
emotions 
towards 
targeted 
and 
personalized content. The sample consisted of 48 participants 
(20 males and 28 females). The preliminary analysis uncovered 
three themes: 1) Encounters, awareness, and comprehension, 2) 
Emotions, and 3) Increasing use and appreciation. 
Keywords-social media; digital competence; influence; 
adolescent; personalized content. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Young people spend a lot of time online. In Norway, the 
average exceeds five hours a day for adolescents and young 
adults [1]. This age group is also very active on social media 
[2], which implies that they are exposed to social influence 
both in their physical and digital lives. The continuing 
increase in so-called screen time has caused alarm, among 
researchers 
and 
government 
agencies 
alike 
[3][4]. 
Adolescents’ use of social media has received particular 
focus, likely due to the time spent, but also because this age 
group might be less digitally competent than they believe 
themselves [5][6]. In fact, research has shown that adolescents 
are largely unaware of how personalization shapes their 
everyday life [7][8]. Moreover, social comparison and social 
influence is prominent in adolescents’ [9], this may make this 
age group particularly vulnerable to targeted and personalized 
online content. On the other hand, some claim that moral panic 
has biased the research in a negative direction, thus there is a 
need for more nuanced studies on the impact of social media, 
including potential positive effects of exposure to social media 
content [10][11]. 
The body of research on adolescents’ use of social media 
is substantial [12]. However, recent criticism stresses the 
methodological limitations of many of the quantitative 
studies, such as correlations between screen time and mental 
health measures [4]. A few recent studies have instead used 
qualitative methods to better understand how adolescents 
experience social media and their impact. Some look at 
targeted advertising [13][14], others look at curated news 
stories [7][15]. Others still attempt to uncover how people 
reason about the technology behind social media, particularly 
algorithms [8][16]-[19], but these do not focus on adolescents 
as a separate group. 
Following the sound direction of recent research, this 
qualitative study examines adolescents’ experiences with 
personalized content and how personalized content shape the 
digital world of youth, both positively and negatively. With 
this work, we wish to address the consequences of social 
media that remain unclear from the current body of research. 
This unclarity is partly due to methodological limitations [4], 
and partly due to contradictory research findings that point to 
small and large, positive and negative, and sometimes absent 
effects of screen time, on well-being [20]. 
Considering that media consumption is no longer a passive 
process, but a mutual and active exchange of information, we 
need more insight on this age group’s digital competence 
related to social media technologies, we also need to 
understand how potentially vulnerable adolescents navigate 
their personalized internet realities and how they are affected. 
This need underlines the aim of this study to assess 
adolescents’ experience with targeted and personalized 
content on social media.  
The article is structured into five sections. Following 
Section I, the introduction, Section II describes the method, 
including 
information 
about 
the 
sample, 
ethical 
considerations, material, data collection and analysis. In 
Section III, the preliminary results are presented and 
discussed; it is divided into three sub-sections, one for each 
theme. Section IV addresses the study’s strengths and 
limitations. Finally, Section V presents the conclusions. 
II. METHOD 
The study presented here is a work-in-progress built on a 
qualitative design with eight focus group interviews. These 
interviews represent participants’ varied experiences, to map 
out associations, variations, and different aspects of 
experiences on a selected topic [21]. Thus, the study aims for 
insight on subjective experiences with personalized content.  
A. 
Sample 
Prior to recruitment, principals from two different schools 
in the same region were contacted through e-mail. Thereafter, 
an employee at each school was assigned with the 
responsibility of recruiting students willing to participate, 
following our inclusion criteria. The students were recruited 
from different classes and the respective teachers informed the 
17

students about the project. A random draw was done by the 
teacher in classes where more students than needed were 
willing to participate. A few participants were unable to attend 
the interview due to quarantine, in those situations we were 
able to recruit additional participants from a waiting list. 
The inclusion criteria were that the participants had to be 
students in secondary school, aged between 15 and 19 years 
old, and willing to participate in the study. The final sample 
included 48 participants (20 male and 28 female students). 
The youngest participants (12 males, 12 females) were 
recruited from the last year of lower secondary school (aged 
15-16). The remaining participants were recruited from three 
levels of upper secondary school, 12 (6 males, 6 females) from 
level one (aged 16-17), six (1 males, 5 females) from level two 
(aged 17-18) and six (1 male, 5 females) from level three 
(aged 18-19). Participants were interviewed with their peers 
in groups of six, making it a total of eight focus group 
interviews. One male participant was excluded in retrospect 
due to his considerably older age; he was judged to be 
unrepresentative of the sample’s general level of digital 
competence. Thus, there are 19 males included in the analysis.  
B. 
Ethics Statement 
After volunteering for the study, participants received and 
signed an informed consent form, which they later brought to 
the interview. Students aged 15 years also provided a parent’s 
consent. Each focus group interview started by introducing the 
purpose and content of the study, including information about 
their ethical and voluntary rights. The study protocol, data 
plan and related documents received approval by the 
Norwegian Centre for Research Data (reference 644850). 
Anonymization was ensured by transcribing the interviews 
and allocating fictitious aliases. All participants received a gift 
card for their time, valued equivalent to 35 USD / 30 EUR.  
C. 
Material 
The current study is part of a larger project with an overall 
aim to assess social media habits among adolescents. The 
larger project includes an ongoing longitudinal diary study 
where we aim to follow 24 adolescents through high school. 
For the purpose of this work-in-progress, only questions and 
findings on adolescents’ experiences with targeted and 
personalized content on social media are analyzed and 
reported. For each focus group, a timing of 90 minutes was 
scheduled, including an introduction for the study’s purpose. 
A semi-structured interview guide was prepared with open-
ended questions to ensure a coherent narrative of experiences 
with targeted and personalized content on social media.  
The interviews were recorded with a secure Dictaphone 
application running on three mobile devices simultaneously, 
each placed in a different location in the interview room.  
D. 
Data Collection and Analysis 
All interviews were conducted between April and June 
2021, in suitable rooms at the respective schools. Each 
interview lasted between 42 to 91 minutes, excluding the 
introduction and de-brief, and was recorded and transcribed 
verbatim. Two researchers were present throughout the 
interviews, the researcher leading the interview was always 
the same. The researcher who did not lead the interview used 
a spreadsheet to note down the time and order of speakers. 
The preliminary analysis is based on transcriptions of 
recorded interviews, aided by notes on speakers and times. 
Transcripts were reviewed to identify specific experiences, 
and the initial analysis of the transcripts resulted in temporary 
themes that originated from the interview guide and the 
study’s intent [22]. Thereafter, a theoretical interpretation 
was performed, so that the transcripts could be systematized 
to cover the various themes and sub themes meaningfully. 
The analysis was a joint effort that relied on Brinkmann 
and Kvale’s steps [23] for interpretation and conveyance of 
understanding; participants’ quotes represent understanding 
of self, interpretations of quotes correspond to critical 
understanding based on common sense, and implications are 
placed in a larger context of theoretical understanding. 
The selection of included quotes is the result of the 
researchers’ mutual agreement on how best to shed light on 
the relevant major themes that emerged through the data 
analysis. The quotations presented in this study have been 
translated from Norwegian to English, they have also been 
edited for better readability. Nonetheless, the quotations have 
been kept as close to the original statements as possible.  
III. PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
All participants had one or more social media profile 
which they had used from the age of 10 to 12. The main 
reasons provided for joining social media were fear of 
missing out and keeping in touch with friends and family. The 
high availability of having a phone and having a large amount 
of screen time in general, was mentioned. These findings 
correspond to the results from a Norwegian national survey 
on adolescents, where 75 – 79% of females and males 
between the ages of 15 to 19 reported having minimum 3 
hours of daily screen time. Furthermore, 36% of respondents 
between 13 and 19 years reported spending a minimum of 3 
hours on social media [2]. In the current study, the reported 
average time spent on social media platforms was 3 to 4 hours 
on normal weekdays. The most popular and most used social 
media platforms mentioned by our participants were TikTok, 
Snapchat and Instagram, across all ages. Although the large 
majority of participants stated that they ‘follow’ people on 
social media, meaning that they have taken action to receive 
content from friends, family, influencers and other 
celebrities, some of them modified this response later and 
clarified that they mostly followed friends and only a few 
celebrities.  
The pattern appears to be that most do not have a 
particular plan for what type of content they want to watch 
while on social media. Instead, they let the platform make the 
selection on their behalf, based on the accounts they follow 
and what they have liked before. As Rebecca (15-16) put it: 
“Like, I follow only what I find interesting and, um, my 
friends or people I know”. Ethan (15-16) from a different 
interview added: “I think most people tend to be on ‘For 
You’”, referring to the page on TikTok where random videos 
18

pop up based on their previous actions. The overall 
observation that adolescents do not deliberately seek out and 
select specific content may indicate that they freely allow 
social media to influence them, be it a conscious or an 
unconscious decision.  
The reported experiences with targeted and personalized 
content on social media converged under three main themes: 
1) Encounters, awareness, and comprehension, 2) Emotions, 
and 3) Increasing use and appreciation. 
A. 
Encounters, Awareness and Comprension 
Awareness and comprehension about targeted and 
personalized content differed to some extent across gender 
and age groups. Participants in the age of 17 to 19 expressed 
broader understanding and greater awareness of personalized 
and targeted content throughout the interviews, compared to 
the youngest age groups. The same pattern of broader 
understanding and greater awareness was seen for the 
females as compared to the males. There is little research 
addressing age and sex differences in social media usage 
among the young, thus it is premature to extend the 
interpretation of these differences. However, on the age 
matter, a qualitative study has shown that students in the age 
19 to 22 did have an understanding of personalization [15].  
Most of the groups mentioned indirectly that they 
encountered targeted and personalized content on their most 
popular social media platforms (Instagram, TikTok, 
Snapchat, YouTube), before we asked questions related to 
personalization. TikTok was predominant, and many 
participants said that they quickly observed that they were 
receiving personalized content while on TikTok. “But like, 
the thing about TikTok is that they notice what you like, so 
they come up with suggestions on videos for you. If, for 
example, you like a football video, then a lot more football 
videos may show up”, explained Marcus (15-16). Meredith 
(17-18) also emphasized and showed a broad understanding 
of targeted and personalized content: «There are algorithms 
and such, aren’t there? That somehow find out what you look 
at, what you like and what you sort of bump into, or what you 
search for and such. That's what kind of makes my TikTok 
full of food and humor, while um others are full of other 
things.” As found by Swart [16], some of the algorithms that 
personalize content are easier to recognize than others. For 
instance, when labelled as ‘suggestions for you’ or ‘for you’, 
content can more easily be recognized as personalized 
compared to more subtle personalization [16]. This was also 
the case for the participants in our study. Several of the 
participants explicitly mentioned the ‘For You’ page on 
TikTok, revealing their reflections on the targeted and 
personalized content. They also pointed out that the content 
they encountered on their social media platforms was 
uniquely selected for them. For example, when we asked 
what they saw while on TikTok, Victoria (15-16) said: “It’s 
of course very different the content we get, because it 
[TikTok] tries to like show you videos that it thinks you will 
like. So, it’s kind of very different from person to person.”  
It emerged through the interviews that most participants 
had experiences where their engagement to specific content 
or items on social media and/or online browsing would lead 
to related advertisement. As Regina (18-19) put it: “Like, if I 
search for something on a regular website, it’s often that I see 
advertisement for that thing I searched for, when I enter 
Facebook.” Rebecca added: “They kind of want you to click 
on more things, because… Um, one time when I was on 
TikTok, it came up an advertising link for a product that I 
looked at. And then when I went on Instagram, the same thing 
showed up there too [as an advertisement].” Similar 
experiences with online actions resulting in targeted 
advertising across platforms, were reported in a qualitative 
study of Facebook’s newsfeed. Combined, these findings 
point to a blending of commercial and regular content that 
may be difficult for social media users to discern. Hence, it 
might be difficult for adolescents to distinguish whether they 
are being influenced through social media.   
B. 
Emotions  
A majority of the participants explained that they enjoyed 
receiving personalized content because it brought them 
relevant and interesting content, rather than irrelevant and 
uninteresting. This was prominent both for regular content 
and for commercial content and advertising. For example, 
when we asked participants how they felt when they received 
targeted and personalized content, Joanna (16-17) replied: 
“It’s nice, then only content you like to watch appears”, with 
some fellow classmates agreeing with her. Even though 
Joanna did not use the word ‘influence’, she indirectly 
conveyed that personalized content had a positive influence 
on her daily life and well-being. Other participants shared 
similar appreciations of social media’s positive influence. 
Enjoyment of targeted and personalized content has been 
reported earlier, for instance with young people emphasizing 
the benefits of recommended systems [16].  
Conversely, several of the participants expressed that they 
felt unease towards targeted and personalized content. “It’s 
like seeing my phone predict my next choice (…). Your 
phone or an app based on what you have pressed or which 
videos you have liked, somehow in a way can predict how 
you are as a person. It's a little, or it's not a little, it's very 
scary”, said Mia (15-16). Even though many agreed with her 
and shared her fear, several of the participants disagreed and 
held on to the positive sides of personalized content on social 
media. Nevertheless, a couple did express some fear when it 
came to how much the applications knew about them. Lucas 
(16-17 years) explained one of the reasons for why he thought 
of personalization as ‘scary’: “If one is on a website, they 
know exactly how fast I move the mouse to when I press on 
that thing [I’m looking at]. And they can take that data to 
different advertisers.” Not everyone felt unease, however, 
some simply felt annoyed. When Noah (16-17) shared his 
thoughts on targeted and personalized content, he said: 
“Well, it's good that they do it, but it can sometimes be a bit 
too much. For example, if I search for a hoodie I want, then 
19

advertisements come up all the time for it, for a few months 
on all my social media channels.” His voice stressed the 
words ‘all’ and ‘all the time’. A mixture of negative emotions 
towards receiving targeted content have also been found in 
previous studies; Youn & Kim [13] found that some of the 
young adult participants voiced their experiences with 
personalized advertisement as scary and creepy, whereas 
others found it annoying and irritating. 
Receiving personalized advertisement without ever 
searching for the product was something many participants 
had experienced. Several expressed that they had a feeling 
that the phone could hear them, adding that this experience 
was the scariest when it came to personalization. Miranda 
(15-16) explained: “It has happened to me, that I have talked 
about one thing [verbally], and then a few days later a lot of 
advertisement has shown up for that thing [I talked about]. 
Then I’m like, was I kind of monitored now?” This feeling 
was shared by many participants across interviews. These 
experiences have also been shared by participants in other 
qualitative studies [17][19]. However, these statements 
represent personal theories, theories that have yet to be 
scientifically verified [25]. As Meredith added: ‘It might just 
be a conspiracy theory.”  
No clear age difference was found for the themes relating 
to emotions of enjoyment and unease concerning 
personalized content, although the participants from upper 
secondary school came across as the most reflected age 
group. Furthermore, there were participants across all groups 
who said they did not care that they received personalized 
content. Although the younger participants expressed little 
reflection on the reason, the participants from the two highest 
levels of upper secondary school hypothesized that the lack 
of concern was due to them becoming accustomed or 
acceptive of personalized content. The age group differences 
stand in accordance with the oldest showing better general 
comprehension and expressing more advanced reflections on 
targeted and personalized content. For example, Richard (15-
16) said: “I don’t think as much about it [personalized 
content], because clearly I like it.” On the other hand, the 
older Regina said: “Like, I know many people who thinks it’s 
[personalized content] kind of uncomfortable. But I notice 
that I don’t really care so much about it, because you do 
accept it.” A fellow female classmate Ashley (18-19) added: 
“I think many of us have gotten used to it, being tracked 
online. You are aware of it, but everyone gets tracked online 
anyways, so you can’t really do anything about it unless you 
just decide to not have social media anymore.” Considering 
that adolescents have previously been found to be less 
digitally competent than they themselves believe [5], [6], it 
follows that the lack of concern may be more than 
habituation. The acceptance of algorithmic intervention may 
be partly driven by superficial comprehension of how the 
technology accomplishes personalization, as well as a lack of 
understanding of how it influences them. On the other hand, 
it may also be motivated by benefits that in certain contexts 
are deemed to outweigh the cost of giving up personal data 
[26]. 
C. 
Increasing Use and Appreciation 
Where some participants were mostly uneasy, others were 
ambivalent on the topic of personalization, others again were 
positive. Across several interviews, participants expressed 
how the personalization improved their experiences with 
social media. These participants shared an appreciation 
towards the applications for making social media a nice and 
easy experience with their personalized strategy. For 
example, Maria (16-17) said: “I kind of think that if I only 
got content on my phone that wasn’t interesting to me, I 
probably would have used social media much less. So that’s 
probably the reason to why I use social media a lot, because 
I only receive content I find interesting”, with many of her 
fellow classmates agreeing with her. Her comment sheds 
light on how personalized content not only influences, but 
also increases social media usage. Relatedly, algorithmic 
awareness has previously been found to increase social media 
usage; one proposed explanation is that an adolescent’s 
knowledge of algorithmic selections leads to more control 
and acceptance [8].  
Among the participants in this study, some of the 
youngest males were impressed with the social media 
applications. A few talked about how the algorithm works, 
and even though it scared them to a small extent, it did not 
bother them as much. “It’s actually very impressive. They 
find out what I like very fast”, said David (16-17). This 
echoes the ambivalence expressed by others, possibly 
indicating that not all situations are controllable and not all 
content is acceptable. A few participants explained that they 
were aware of the option to unselect content they are not 
interested in; for example, Rebecca explained that by doing 
this “they [social media platforms] make sure that the content 
[you are not interested in] gets taken away from your feed.” 
At the same time, the participants who brought up this subject 
also had a tendency to add that they rarely made use of the 
option to unselect or block content; unless the content was 
especially disturbing, they would simply scroll on. The 
tendency to ignore rather than block content coincides with 
Swart’s results [16], findings from both studies point to 
acceptance and appreciation of personalized content among 
adolescents. It remains unclear whether the tendency to not 
act, but rather ignore, unwanted content is only due 
appreciation, or whether it also reflects a lack of critical 
reflection and digital competence.  
IV. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 
Our study adds to a research field built mainly on a large 
body of quantitative studies, using focus group interviews 
that contribute insight based on a qualitative approach. This 
is a first strength of the study. Second, internal validity was 
prioritized by including a researcher with experience in 
qualitative research to supervise the data analysis. Third, both 
mixed and same-sex focus groups were used to enable a 
20

DIGITAL 2021 : Advances on Societal Digital Transformation

 
variety of opinions and interactions during the discussions. 
Fourth, our sample size is large considering the qualitative 
design. Throughout the interviews most themes and topics 
were repeated, supporting the assumption that topics relevant 
to personalized content on social media was sufficiently 
described and discussed. Fifth, most of the participants were 
unaware of the monetary compensation prior to volunteering, 
hence financial motivation was likely not present. 
There are some limitations to this study that are important 
to mention. First and foremost, although the study was 
designed to be explorative, we might have missed 
determinants due to selection bias. Moreover, a rather 
homogeneous sample was included, particularly in upper 
secondary school where female participants outnumbered the 
males. Additionally, this study is based on a cross section. 
Even though we did find differences across age and gender, 
we do have the grounds to predict individual development 
over time. Finally, it should be noted that the study was 
conducted in Norway where internet usage and social media 
are widely common [2]. This may cause a skew in our 
participants’ experiences on social media and their 
understanding of personalization; although their digital 
competence may have shortcomings, it may still be more 
advanced than what can be observed among adolescents in 
other countries in- and outside Europe. Consequently, our 
results may not be generalizable to populations where social 
media are less common and digital competence is lower. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Social media were actively used by all participants, with 
TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram being used the most. The 
majority of the participants revealed that they did not have a 
plan when using social media, many tended towards using 
different 
systems 
for 
recommendations. 
Most 
had 
encountered targeted content, but only the older participants 
delivered reflections on how their previous actions could 
facilitate this personalization. Personalized content improved 
experiences with social media for several participants, which 
also led to increased social media usage. Regarding their 
emotions towards targeted content, the participants typically 
enjoyed and appreciated personalized content. Some, 
however, shared sentiments of unease, this was predominant 
for targeted advertisement. Moreover, some of the 
participants did not care whether they received targeted 
content, instead they stated that they had chosen to ‘just 
accept it’. This may represent a lack of choice when it comes 
to receiving personalized content, particularly salient for 
adolescents who want to be on social media partly due to fear 
of missing out. Few participants used available options to 
block content, most would simply scroll on. Unexpectedly, 
several participants believed that their phone could hear 
them. Even though the participants themselves assumed that 
this was a conspiracy theory, it was a prominent finding and 
a sentiment shared by participants across interviews. This 
finding exemplifies that adolescents’ understanding of social 
media personalization does not always reflect advanced 
digital competence. Future research should aim for 
longitudinal studies that follow individuals’ development 
over time, to obtain more accurate predictions and a more 
comprehensive overview over adolescents’ experience with 
targeted and personalized content on social media. This work 
is currently ongoing by this project group.

Abstract— Existing Light Field (LF) refocusing techniques 
refocus to all the pixels of a certain depth plane. However, in 
reality, the human eye focuses only on the object of interest 
while everything else is in depth-wise out of focus. In this 
paper, we propose a LF refocusing technique that is consistent 
with human visual perception. To this end, we perform 
instance segmentation on LF content and bring the whole 
object of interest in-focus rather than only the parts of the 
object that are in the same depth plane or all the objects that 
are on the same depth plane as the object of interest. 
Experimental results show that the proposed method is more 
consistent with the human visual perception than existing 
methods, yielding significantly improved visual quality results.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
LF technology emerged as an “upgrade” to the way we 
capture and reproduce visual information [1][2]. It offers 
even more immersive and holistic imaging experience than 
360 video and omnidirectional stereo videos [3]. It allows 
post-shoot refocusing, perspective shifts, depth of field 
change, and 3D-like content generation with great precision. 
In fact, refocusing is the most far-reaching potential 
application of LF technology and the foundation for more 
realistic mixed reality applications. As augmented reality 
(AR)/ virtual reality (VR)/ mixed reality (MR) technologies 
use position and eye tracking, the experience needs to adjust 
to user’s head and eye movement making it more 
comfortable and immersive. However, with the current state 
of LF refocusing, we can only alter the focal plane of a 
captured LF and refocus on all the objects (pixels) 
belonging to that focal plane. In other words, we bring all 
the pixels pertaining to the desired depth in-focus and 
everything else is out of focus.  
LFs are captured either by plenoptic cameras or camera 
arrays. Plenoptic cameras [1] place an array of microlenses 
in between primary lens and photosensor to capture angular 
information. Limited photosensor resolution forces us to 
choose between spatial or angular resolution. In contrast, 
camera arrays [2] arrange multiple cameras on a rig to 
capture a scene. The distances between the lenses of the 
cameras (centimeters) are far greater than they are in 
plenoptic cameras (nanometers). This means that the point 
of views are further apart in camera array than they are in 
plenoptic camera. For camera array setups, the number of 
cameras 
dictates 
the 
angular 
resolution/number 
of 
viewpoints. Each camera's photo-sensor captures a single 
image, resulting in higher spatial resolution LFs. Traditional 
camera array systems are bulky and require a lot of 
hardware [4] but through camera miniaturization [5] these 
problems are being rapidly solved. As camera array content 
has larger baseline, typical refocusing methods lead to 
aliasing problem in the out of focus region [6].  
A stereo-image refocusing method was introduced by 
Busam et al. [7]. This method selectively blurs the image 
based on the estimated depth using the stereo image, to 
create a refocused effect. However, this method was not 
extended for more than two cameras. Similar problems were 
found in the works of Cossairt et al. [8] and Bando et al. [9]; 
the former creates a refocused image using three images, 
whereas the latter generates the entire LF from a single 
image. Recent method by Wang et al. [10] also proposes to 
generate the out of focus region using depth-based 
anisotropic filters and in-focus region is produced by 
reconstruction based super resolution. Up to this point, all 
LF refocusing research assumed the new focal plane for 
refocusing will be parallel to the camera. Another recent 
work by Alain et al. [11] considered the scenario where the 
viewer tilts their head and the desired refocus plane and 
viewpoint are no longer parallel to the camera. In summary, 
all the above-mentioned approaches are designed for 
refocusing to a new focus plane, thereby, bringing all the 
pixels that are a certain distance from the camera in-focus 
and rendering everything else as depth wise blur. However, 
when we observe a scene and focus on an object, every part 
of the scene having the same distance from our eyes does 
not come into focus for us. Instead, we see that object 
clearly and everything else is in depth wise blurred with 
respect to that object. 
In this paper, we propose a realistic, more immersive, 
and more visually pleasing object-based LF refocusing 
technique, which uses a deep learning network to synthesize 
an appropriate number of new views and another deep 
learning network for object segmentation.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, we present our object segmentation-based enhancement 
method. Experimental results are presented and discussed in 
Section III. We conclude our work in Section IV. 
II. 
PROPOSED METHOD 
Our proposed refocusing scheme for LF camera array 
videos uses a deep learning-based view synthesis method 
and a shift and sum approach combined with a unique object 
segmentation-based enhancement technique for the in-focus 
object. Viewers select the object they wish to refocus on, and 
our method refocuses on that object while depth wise 
blurring the rest of the scene. The following subsections 
describe our approach in detail. 
A. Object Segmentation of LF videos 
At first, we segment individual objects in the video. We 
used an object segmentation deep learning network 
Detectron2 [12] on LF videos [13] and segmented the 
objects. We used COCO Annotator [14] to annotate 1 frame 
per second for the LF videos and trained Detectron2 using 
these frames. Then, we used the trained network to segment 
all the other frames of the video. Figure 1 (a)-(c) show the 
original frame, the COCO Annotator annotated frame and 
the Detectron2 segmented frame correspondingly. 
B. View Synthesis 
After object segmentation, to reduce the aliasing artifacts 
caused by the wide baseline of camera arrays, we synthesize 
novel views in between existing views using a factor of n. 
Here, n=1 is equivalent to one novel view between two 
adjacent views and 1 view between each pair of 
horizontal/vertical synthesized views. Therefore, the total 
number of views is (nN – n+N)2, where N×N is the 
arrangement and number of cameras on the camera array. 
We used a pre-trained fully-convolutional encoder-decoder 
deep learning network [15] architecture (modeled after the 
popular convolutional neural network VGG-19 [16] by the 
Visual Geometry Group) to synthesize the novel views. This 
network does not require any camera parameter information, 
and thus it can be generalized to any LF video dataset. Given 
two input views captured by two horizontally/vertically 
aligned cameras and the distance between those two 
cameras, the network can synthesize as many novel views 
between the input views as desired. Figure 2 shows view 
synthesis for n=3.  
C. LF Refocusing 
 During the refocusing process, one camera will be 
picked as the reference camera. Then, the user selects any 
object on the reference view to refocus on. We estimate the 
depth of that object using Depth Estimation Reference 
Software (DERS) [17]. Next, we need the disparity shift of 
all the views from the reference view at the determined 
depth. The disparity shift for original views can be found in 
[13]. The synthesized views are calculated by linearly 
interpolating between the disparity shifts of the two adjacent 
original views. Finally, we apply the generalized shift and 
sum algorithm [11] using the interpolated and original 
disparities to produce the refocused video. 
D. Object Segmentation based Enhancement Method 
After refocusing, we see that all the objects/pixels of the 
refocused plane are in-focus rather than the object of interest. 
We also observe that the refocused plane appears to be a 
little blurry, especially when it is close to the camera. The 
reason for this is that the synthesized views are not as 
accurate as the original views and as a result the average 
values for the in-focus pixels are not accurate either. To 
address 
these 
problems, 
we 
introduce 
an 
object 
segmentation-based enhancement method. First, we segment 
the object of interest from the reference view using the 
trained deep learning network. Next, we replace the pixels 
values of the segmented object at the refocused view with 
those of the reference view.

synchronized 4×4 camera array at 30fps. The cameras are 
70mm apart with 50°×37° field of view. Each LF video has 
2048×1088 spatial resolution in raw 4:2:0 8bit YUV format 
and is 12.3 seconds long (i.e., 372 frames). We demonstrate 
the original reference frame, refocused frames without and 
with our proposed object segmentation- based enhancement 
in Figure 3. We have experimented with different numbers 
of synthesized views n = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10}, at various depths 
(in meters) from the camera: z = {1.9, 2.0, 3.0, 3.2, 4.0}.  
For demonstration purposes, we show the 75th frame of 
the “Painter” LF video sequence in Figure 3. We observed 
that as we increase the value of n for view synthesis, the 
refocusing results improve, with acceptable results achieved 
by n = 3 (total 169 views with 16 original views). Based on 
the above observations and the increased computational 
complexity of generating more views, we decided to fix n = 
3. Results of both without and with enhancement refocused 
at a 2m distance are shown in Figure 3 (b) and Figure 3(c), 
respectively. From Figure 3, it is obvious that object 
segmentation-based enhancement results are more consistent 
with human visual perception, more visually pleasing and 
natural compared to the results where object segmentation 
has not been used. The object of interest here are the books 
on the stool and they have been brought in sharp focus with 
object segmentation-based enhancement, whereas the 
background experiences depth wise blur. Please refer to the 
zoomed results in Figure 3(f). When refocused without 
object segmentation-based enhancement, as in Figure 3 (b), 
we observe the in-focus region/object is not at sharp focus, 
but rather looks a little blurry and suffers from some aliasing 
artifacts. This is more evident in the zoomed in version of 
Figure 3 (e). This is because we used original and 
synthesized views for refocusing and the synthesized views 
are not accurate and as a result the refocusing is not accurate 
either. Therefore, an enhancement technique is essential. For 
both with and without enhancement, the background still has 
some aliasing artifacts. This can be mitigated through more 
accurate view synthesis or by using blurring filters [10]. 
Comparing the backgrounds of the original all in-focus 
Figure 3 (d) and the proposed method in Figure 3 (f), we can 
notice that the background patterns (floral foliage from the 
painting behind) in Figure 3 (d) are clearly visible, whereas 
in Figure 3 (f) those patterns experience depth wise blur as 
they should in a human visual perception consistent 
refocused view. We also observe that the refocused region is 
blurrier if the object/region is closer to the camera. In Figure 
4, we present the results of the same frame refocused on the 
painter at 3.2m distance from the camera. We notice the 
refocused region is blurry but free of any aliasing artifact. 
Even then, the object segmentation-based enhancement

would expect a smooth transition from the in-focus books on 
the table to the not in-focus region. This is a drawback of the 
proposed method. We leave this as future work, planning to 
explore the use of depth wise blending techniques for 
achieving better smoothing transition.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this work, we presented an efficient and human-like 
visual perception refocusing scheme for LF camera array 
content. Our approach uses a deep learning network to 
synthesize an appropriate number of new views and an 
object 
segmentation-based 
enhancement 
technique 
to 
improve the overall visual quality of the refocused frame. 
We found that the quality enhancement approach improves 
the visual quality of the in-focus regions by replacing the 
blurry pixels of the object of interest with corresponding 
pixels from the reference view using object segmentation. As 
a result, our method achieves visually acceptable and 
natural-looking refocused LF videos. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first method designed to refocus 
camera 
array 
LF 
content, 
offering 
unprecedented 
immersiveness, consistency with human visual perception 
and an excellent infrastructure for producing high-quality 
mixed reality content. Along with this paper we publish the 
code and an easy-to-use UI application [18] which might be 
of special interest for the community. Our future work will 
focus on finetuning the object segmentation process and 
increasing the size of our training dataset to include as many 
unique objects as possible.

Abstract—Due to advancements in digital technologies in
recent years, the security of exchanged data has become the
most attractive topic for many researchers. Consequently, several
cryptography schemes have been introduced and proposed for
securing the exchanged sensitive data in the network. In this
paper, we propose new chaos-based protection in order to secure
both the exchanged identity text and the image data. In addition,
we applied the proposed encryption to secure the exchanged
heterogeneous data inside a C# chat application. The analysis
of the simulation results shows that the proposed scheme offers
a better performance in terms of security and robustness than
some similar schemes.
Keywords—data security; cryptography; chaos; C# application.
I. INTRODUCTION
With the advent in Internet and networking applications,
security becomes a major concern in the current era of
information technology. The security threats and attacks are
increased due to the huge amount of exchanged data over
the network. As a solution to these threats, information
security is a well known proposal which provides protection
to data availability, privacy, and integrity [1]. Moreover, data
encryption is considered as the most traditional technique
that secures highly conﬁdential information by using some
conventional algorithm, which already exists [2]. Looking for
more ﬂexibility and security, Saraf et al. [3] have proposed
an AES(Advanced Encryption Standard)-based encryption
and decryption for text and image data. For text encryption,
128-bit text inputs are synthesized and simulated using a
code composer studio tool in C developing language code.
For image encryption, a Java developing language code is
synthesized and simulated by Java Application Platform. By
combining the AES and the Elliptic Curve Cryptography
(ECC), [4] proposes an extension of a public-key-based
cryptosystem. To overcome the drawbacks shown in the
traditional 128-AES, the introduced scheme proposes a
hybrid encryption system including ECC and AES schemes.
The optimized technique includes a trade-off between the key
space (192 bit) and the number of iterations (12). For text
encryption application, a new technique has been proposed
in
[5]. The proposed new technique addresses the leak of
mapping the characters to reﬁne points in the elliptic curve
showed in classic techniques. The main idea of this solution
is to pair values of plain text and corresponding ASCII to
serve as input for the elliptic curve based encryption. The
proposed algorithm is designed to be used for encryption
and decryption of exchanged text data. In
[6], Singh et al.
presented a new encryption scheme based on symmetric key
encryption. The proposed algorithm converts the plain text to
get the corresponding ASCII values, which are considered as
the input text of the cryptosystem. Similarly, the decryption
process starts also by converting the cipher text to ASCII
values which will be the input of this process. In [7], Chandra
et al. proposed double encryption, which is a content-based
algorithm that implements a folding method and a circular
bit-wise operation. In this technique, encryption of plaintext
occurs two times with a secret key, providing cipher text by
using a circular bit-wise binary addition operation. Another
concept based on double encryption is proposed in
[8] to
provide high level of security. In this technique, the plaintext
is encrypted by an encryption technique using a secret key,
which is also encrypted by another algorithm. Then, the
plaintext is encrypted again using the encrypted secret key.
However, all of these proposals suffer from key distribution
and resources consumption, which make them less suitable for
constrained devices and real time applications [9]. Moreover,
more complex schemes have been highlighted by many
studies proving their high computational cost, which affects
mainly the resource-limited devices that are included in the
new networks [10].
One of the advanced cryptography techniques is Attribute-
Based Encryption (ABE), which was introduced to overcome
the limited functionalities of the traditional public key
cryptography schemes [11]. However, in multi-authority
27

DIGITAL 2021 : Advances on Societal Digital Transformation

systems, many complicated issues can be experienced when
the ABE systems are built (revocation problem) [12]. For
example, to tie the work of all authorities together, some
existing systems use a central authority, which can cause a
bottleneck problem and is contradictory to the distributed
control principle [12].
Nowadays, chaotic encryption method seems to be much
better than traditional encryption methods [13]. Chaos-based
schemes have introduced the use of chaotic system properties
such as sensitivity to initial condition and loss of information.
Therefore, many chaos-based encryption methods have been
presented and discussed in the last decades. Moreover,
Babaei
[14] included a logistic chaotic map as an input
of a One-Time-Pad algorithm (OTP) for image encryption
application. In addition, for text ﬁles encryption, authors
have proposed a new algorithm based on a chaotic selection
between original message strands and OTP DNA strands [14].
The obtained result of the proposed solution proved the
efﬁciency of the proposed algorithm in both image and text
encryption. However; all these schemes have shown some
shortcomings regarding the key space offered by the chaotic
system and the robustness of the used chaotic system. Hence,
unlike all the previous proposals, we introduce through this
paper a novel and dynamic chaos-based cryptosystem in order
to secure both the exchanged identity text and the image
data. In addition, we applied the proposed cryptosystem for
secure exchanged heterogeneous data inside a C# application.
Therefore, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:
(i) A new four-dimensional (4-D) chaotic system that shows
good chaotic properties; (ii) A new and a simpliﬁed algorithm
based on a chaos system and a hash function for multimedia
data encryption purpose.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section
2 gives the proposed chaotic system. Section 3 includes
the application of the conﬁgurable chaos-based cryptosystem.
Conclusion and some perspectives are given in Section 4.
II. THE PROPOSED CONFIGURABLE CRYPTOSYSTEM
The
proposed
conﬁgurable
chaos
system
is
multidimensional
system
including
several
systems
(2-
D, 3-D and 4-D systems) that are extracted from our proposal
given in [17].
The ﬁrst system is a 2-D dimension described as follows:
(
X(n + 1) = 1 − a ∗ X(n)2 + Y (n)
Y (n + 1) = d ∗ X(n)
(1)
The 3-D system deﬁned by ﬁve (05) nonlinear terms and
three (03) controllers is described as follows:





X(n + 1) = 1 − a ∗ X(n)2 + (Y (n) ∗ Z(n))
Y (n + 1) = 1 − b ∗ Y (n)2 + (X(n) ∗ Z(n))
Z(n + 1) = d ∗ X(n) ∗ Y (n)
(2)
Fig. 1: Signal Graph X(i) of the Proposed Chaotic System.
Fig. 2: Signal Graph Y(i) of the Proposed Chaotic System.
Finally, the proposed 4-D map with seven (07) nonlinear
terms is given as follows:









X(n + 1) = 1 − a ∗ X(n)2 + (Y (n) ∗ Z(n) ∗ P(n))
Y (n + 1) = 1 − b ∗ Y (n)2 + (X(n) ∗ Z(n) ∗ P(n))
Z(n + 1) = 1 − c ∗ Z(n)2 + (X(n) ∗ Y (n) ∗ P(n))
P(n + 1) = d ∗ X(n) ∗ Y (n) ∗ Z(n)
(3)
where X, Y , Z and P are the state variables and a, b, c and
d are the control parameters or the controllers of the system.
To obtain the chaotic behavior of the proposed system (
see Figures 1 to 10) , we deﬁne the values of the controllers
as: a=1.65; b=1.45; c=1.7 and d=0.35; all with initial state of
X(0)=Y (0)=Z(0)=P(0) = 0.1. All these values are selected
to ensure the chaotic behaviour of the proposed system, using
the algorithm presented in [18].
Figures 1 to 4 show the signals of the variables X, Y , Z and
P, which conﬁrm the behaviour of the system. Moreover, we
used the plan projection of the trajectories obtained through

Figures 5 to 10.
III. APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED CRYPTOSYSTEM
We present an application of the proposed conﬁgurable
chaos system to secure the exchanged sensitive data in digital
communications.
A. Algorithm Design and Implementation
A secure communication channel is a software application
that includes user’s interface and a cryptosystem to ensure
data encryption. Due to the variety of the exchanged data and
the high demand of lightweight cryptosystem, we introduce a
conﬁgurable chaos-based cryptosystem using the chaotic maps
deﬁned by equations (1), (2) and (3). The proposed algorithm,

Fig. 12: Hash Function Design.
as shown in the ﬂow chart in 11), runs as follows:
(i) Once the communication is established, we distinguish
between two (2) main cases: sending data or receiving data;
(ii) In the case of sending data, we run the encryption process
according to the data type. For only text data, we use the 2-D
system for the encryption. Then, for only image data, we use
the 3-D system. Finally, we use the 4-D system in the case of
both image and text data;
(iii) In the case of receiving data, we run the same steps as in
(ii) for the decryption process according to the received data
type.
The reason of using the 2-D system for encrypting only text
data is that the text data does not require a higher dimensional
chaotic system. Moreover, we used the 3-D system only for
image encryption in order to follow the approach based on
the 3-D chaos system proposed in [18]. Finally, the 4-D
system is used for encryption of heterogeneous data (text and
image) by allowing three (3) components for the image and
one (1) component for the text.
To enhance the security of encrypted text, we include the
solution called SHA2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) or SHA256
(see Figure 12) as hash function which is considered better
than MD5 (Message Digest 5) and SHA1 [15]. The proposed
hash function is implemented using some widely used security
applications and protocols, including Transport Layer Security
(TLS), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Internet Protocol
Security (IPsec).

Fig. 14: Second User’s Interface.
B. Performance Analysis
We use C# programming language to implement the pro-
posed solution and application. The proposed application is
composed of two (02) interfaces for exchanging messages (see
Figure 13 and Figure 14), and a third separate interface to
show the encryption process’s results (see Figure 15).
Fig. 15: Encrypted Exchanged Data Using the Proposed Sys-
tem.
1) Key Sensitivity: To evaluate the sensitivity to initial
conditions of the proposed system, we consider a changing
by 10−10 of the initial values related to the variables X(0),
Y (0), Z(0) and P(0). The sensitivity to the slightest changes
of the different variables is obtained by generating two tra-
jectories L1(X(0) ,Y (0) ,Z(0) ,P(0)) and L2(X(0)+10−10,
Y (0)+10−10, Z(0)+10−10, P(0)+10−10) keeping the same
control parameters. The results shown in the Figures 16 to 19
prove that, even with the weakest difference in initial values
attributed to X(0),Y (0),Z(0) and P(0), we observe signiﬁcant
changes after only around 50 iterations, which conﬁrms the

sensitivity dependence on the initial conditions of the proposed
maps.
2) Key Space:
Usually, chaos-based cryptosystems are
made of Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG) used
as key streams for ciphering. Among the required conditions
for an encryption scheme to be secure, we ﬁnd the large
key space condition to resist against brute-force attacks [16].
Thereby, the analysis of the key space parameter, which is
deﬁned by the number of the parameters and the size of the

desired key, is used as a basis of comparison between the
proposed system and some existing systems. Therefore, by
supposing the generation of cipher keys on 32 bits, the key
space parameter is computed for each map and showed in
Table I.

3) Security of Hash Encryption: In practice, there are
two common methods used to attack the hash encryption
algorithm.
The ﬁrst method is based on ﬁnding the collision by
introducing different characters, which would help to get
the same hash values when the collision occurs. Therefore,
the attacker could crack the SHA256 by obtaining the same
hash value with the one used during the encryption process.
However, in our case with 256 bits of SHA256 and 32 bits
of the generated chaotic sequence, the task of cracking our
algorithm becomes impossible.
The second method found in the literature for attacking
the hash encryption algorithm is called exhaustive method.
For some short and simple combination, this method is very
efﬁcient. Nevertheless, due to the adopted process of this
method based on single character scan, and the combination of
the words in the dictionary, the exhaustive method is difﬁcult
to work with the number of the characters included in the
output of the SHA256 hash encryption algorithm.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
With the development of Internet and digital networking
applications, security has become a major concern in the
current era of Information Technology.
Unlike all the previous related works, we presented in this
paper a novel and dynamic chaos-based cryptosystem in order
to secure both the exchanged identity text and the image data.
First, we described and analyzed the different dimensional
chaotic systems (2-D, 3-D and 4-D). Then, we applied
the proposed chaotic systems inside a C# chat application
to secure the exchanged data. The encryption/decryption
processes are run using the 2-D system for exchanged
text data, the 3-D system for only image data and the
4-D system for both text and image data. Results showed
that the proposed chaotic maps are very sensitive to initial
conditions and provide larger key space to perform secure
communication.
As future work, the integration of digital FPGA (Field-
Programmable Gate Array) technology for data encryption
in an IP-communication with the proposed solution will be
investigated. Moreover, the evaluation of the proposed scheme
where several input data of different types and complexities
will be performed and compared against the results obtained
through existing schemes.

Abstract—In this paper, we present a smart digital design
interface, IslandPaint: digital painting floating island design.
Through IslandPaint, users can design 3D floating islands with
simple 2D single-view conceptual digital paintings. As shown
in our numerical experiments, after the procedural modeling
process proposed by us, 3D floating islands that look like the
original 2D paintings can be generated automatically. Given our
interface, floating islands design becomes easier for digital art
designers, digital multimedia producers, digital movie makers,
and digital game authors.
Keywords—digital culture; digital art design; digital painting;
interactive interface; procedural modeling.
I. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of digital multimedia technolo-
gies, digital culture becomes a critical part of people’s lives.
As important ingredients of digital culture, digital arts, digital
movies, and digital games are gaining more and more popular-
ity among young people. Computer graphics technology plays
an important role in digital art design. With a realistic graphics
rendering engine, various types of amazing effects can be visu-
alized realistically on screens, or even on immersive devices.
Given these inevitable trends of digital culture’s progressing
and propagating, computer graphics modeling technologies
open people’s field of view. The virtual world is beyond the
imagination and not beneath the facts. Physics laws in the
limited real-world will no longer exist in the entire virtual
digital world. The floating island is definitely solid proof of
this point of view.
As a direct derivation of the digital culture, floating islands
are those islands floating in the sky or space that can never be
seen in the natural world. Due to the attractive visual effects
and their special existence, floating islands are becoming
more and more widely welcomed by digital art designers,
digital movie conductors, digital game authors, players, and
audiences. Typically, floating islands are the terrain blocks that
look like those mountains which are pulled out from the soils
and they mostly look like a small part of a terrain that is cut
out from a larger part of the terrain.
However, traditional terrain procedural modeling methods
are not easily applied for procedural floating island gener-
ation. Even though there are some existing works that are
aiming at generating floating islands automatically, most of
their approaches are based on complex logic flow and have
not considered the well-studied terrain features. Also, none
of the existing works have considered the interactive user
interface for procedural floating island modeling. Therefore,
it is challenging to devise an efficient procedural modeling
approach to automatically synthesize the floating island from
users’ conceptual design. In this paper, we present a digital
painting-based interface, IslandPaint, to help users design their
floating island with conceptual digital paintings. As shown
in Figure 1, a demo of our proposed interface is presented:
The left subfigure shows a user’s original digital painting
of a floating island; the right subfigure is the 3D model
generated with our approach. Demo video of this example
can be accessed at [1]. Contributions of our work include:
• Devising a novel digital painting-based interface for float-
ing island procedural modeling.
• Conducting experiments to demonstrate the results of dig-
ital painting-based floating island procedural modeling.
• Discussing the limitation of our approach and proposing
future works to extend our interface, to inspire the follow-
up works on this research direction.

II. RELATED WORKS
Terrain Procedural Modeling. Lots of terrain procedural
modeling technologies have been widely studied in computer
graphics research communities. The history of research works
on terrain procedural modeling can be dated back to the
late 20th centuries. Since 1982, when Fournier et al. [2]
propose stochastic models to add fractal details on curves
and surfaces, the idea of procedural terrain modeling has
born. However, the first work on terrain procedural modeling
might have been started even earlier. In 1985, the idea of
image texture synthesizer for terrain modeling has been
proposed by Perlin et al. [3]. In 1989, the first eroded fractal
terrain has been generated by Musgrave et al. [4]. After that,
procedural terrain texturing modeling approaches have been
widely studied by Ebert et al. [5] in 2003. Since 2007, digital
elevation models have been applied to terrain synthesis [6].
Due to advanced technologies in parallel computing, the
tasks for generating complex procedural terrain were moved
from the CPU to the GPU in 2007 [7]. At the same time,
special terrain features, such as spheroidal weathering have
been modeled by Beardall et al. [8]. In 2009, with the notion
of human-centered computation, interactive user interfaces
have been applied onto terrain procedural modeling [9]. At
the same time, other complex terrains, such as arches have
been successfully modeled by Peytavie et al. [10]. Later,
in 2014, procedural generation of 3D canyons has been
studied by De et al. [11]. In 2015, parallelity, realism, and
controllability have been systematically incorporated in the
terrain procedural modeling process. In 2017, volumetric
terrain features have been considered in the procedural
generation process [12]. Recently, a desertscape terrain
generation approach has been proposed by Paris et al. [13]
in 2019. At the same time, procedural modeling techniques
in riverscapes synthesis have been studied by Peytavie et
al. [14]. Most recently, Argudo et al. [15] have systematically
simulated the growth of glaciers terrains. Obviously, there is
a trend in the research communities that two factors are very
important considerations for terrain procedural modeling: one
being considering the scientific aspect of the terrain features
while another being the interaction and controllability from
the users. Therefore, comparing with other existing work
on floating island synthesis, our work focuses on these two
factors for interactive procedural floating island generation.
Procedural Floating Islands. Designing and generating
floating islands or floating continents is an interesting topic
for digital movies and games designs. There are lots of works,
especially within the digital multimedia design industry, that
are focusing on how to generate floating islands smartly. For
example, Houdini procedural modeling tutorials [16] have
been posed to teach users how to generate floating islands
using Houdini [17], a 3D animation software application
developed by Toronto-based SideFX. Houdini has been widely
adopted as the PRISMS suite of procedural generation soft-
ware tools. Similarly, 3D Blender [18] tutorials share similar
methods [19], [20] and a voxel plugin [21] shows a procedural
method to generate voxel-based floating islands. However,
all methods are very hard for the users to parameterize
an arbitrary floating island from their own will, and the
learning curves to master these interfaces are very high for
beginners. Therefore, those approaches to generate floating
islands lack users’ control. On other hand, Houdini or Blender-
based procedural modeling approaches have not considered
professional procedural modeling approaches [5], [22], [23]
studied by researchers. Rather, they all are trying to deform
a given manifold surface, such as a sphere, through different
sorts of noises, to generate different types of floating terrains.
Another related work is proposed by Sandberg et al. [24],
but unfortunately, their work is directly deleting the triangles
outside the terrain shape and directly copying the bottom
mesh from the top mesh, therefore, it results in very poor
modeling quality. Although these works can be applied to
digital arts or games, the limited control from the users will
result in the degradation of the originality and the value of
their artworks designs. Different from these existing works,
our work focuses more on the user’s control over their floating
island designs. Also, we model the floating island based on
professional terrain procedural modeling approaches.
III. OVERVIEW
Figure 2 shows the overview of our approach. Given an
image of 2D conceptual digital painting floating island design
as input (a), we segment the top image (b) and bottom image
(c) according to the color palette, which in this case is grass
blue as the top and dark brown as the bottom. Then, we per-
form separate tasks for the top and bottom images differently.
For the top image, we do an image shape distribution analysis

along the y-axis (the blurred image on top) to get the basemap
for the floating island’s top heightmap. Simultaneously, we to
a contour polygonization as the border shape of the floating
island. For the bottom image, we apply a half-distribution
analysis of the image shape and then we get a silhouette of
the bottom part of the floating island (the white curve on the
bottom). Then, we multiply the half-distribution onto the top
image so that we get a basemap for the floating island’s bottom
heightmap (the blurred image on the bottom). Detailed term
concepts and mathematical definitions will be expanded and
explained in the following section.
Then, according to the feature map of the generated terrain
(d), we synthesize the top mesh of the floating island through
the top image, top basemap, and contour polygon (terrain
shape). Similarly, we synthesize the bottom mesh of the
floating island through the top image, bottom basemap, and
contour polygon. In order to avoid any intervals between the
top mesh and the bottom mesh, we introduce the middle mesh
as a strip that connects the silhouette of the top mesh and the
silhouette of the bottom mesh. After the last step of combining
these three terrain meshes seamlessly, we get the synthesized
floating terrain as the output of our approach (e).
IV. TECHNICAL APPROACH
In this section, we will present the detailed concepts and
mathematical definitions for those terms mentioned in the
previous section. Note that our approach is proposed based
on an important hypothesis that the user’s original digital
painting design is the abstract conceptual design and there
is a loss of depth and texture details. For simplification of
the digital image understanding process, we assume the top
shape of the original floating island conceptual design is flat.
Terrain Shape Extraction. Given the above assumption,
we can extract the terrain shape from the top image in three
steps shown in Figure 3. First, as shown in (b), we need to
track the silhouette of the white area of the top image using
a directional table-based binary image silhouette extraction
algorithm [25]. Next, as shown in (c), given these pixels in
the extracted silhouette from the top image, we do a line
fitting algorithm to approximate the shape of the silhouette
as a polygon; We also call this a polygonization process of
the top shape. Polygonization is important for reducing the
noises on the edge of the synthesized floating island terrain.
Then, the last step is to trim the 2D square terrain mesh
into polygonized terrain mesh. As shown in (d), we take
advantage of the Active Edge Table (AET) polygon filling
algorithm [26] and modify it to generate the trimmed terrain
mesh with polygon edges [27]. This terrain shape extraction
process can be both applied on the top mesh and the bottom
mesh synthesis for the procedural floating islands generation.
Terrain Basemap Synthesis. The basemap of the terrain is
an important concept for the elevation-based terrain procedural
modeling techniques. Basemap is typically used for mixing the
elevation map of terrain through two different elevation maps,
one is the basemap B(u, v) while the other one is the featured
heightmap H0(u, v). Then, the elevation map of the resulting
terrain is the H(u, v) = α(βB(u, v) + (1 − β)H0(u, v))
where α ∈ R is the heightmap scale factor and β ∈ [0, 1] is
the basemap scale factor. Through this calculation, featured
heightmap H0(u, v) is used for adding features on top of
the terrain, while basemap B(u, v) plays an important role in
setting the foundation of the terrain. In our work, we consider
the basemap to synthesize the terrain heightmap from a given
featured heightmap H0(u, v).
From
the
observations
that floating islands have
lower elevations near the
edge while higher elevations
far away from the edge,
therefore, we consider a sta-
tistical method to evaluate the basemap B(u, v); We call
it image shape distribution analysis. The idea is, given a
texture coordinate (texcoord) on a binary image and given
a direction, say, v-axis, then the image shape distribution
analysis along v-axis will return two functions: shape mean
µ(v) and shape deviation σ(v). Let binary image I(u, v)
return 1 where texcoord (u, v) is inside the shape; Other-
wise, I(u, v) return 0. Then, as shown in the above figure,
shape mean µ(v) is lying on the central curve of the image
shape. Mathematically, µ(v) = (umin(v) + umax(v))/2 where
umin / max(v) = min / max{u|I(u, v) = 1}. Similarly, σ(v) =
(umax(v) − umin(v))/2. Then, we calculate the basemap of
terrain B(u, v) as:
B(u, v) =
(
sin(cos−1 
|u−µ(v)|
σ(v)

)
σ(v) ̸= 0
0
σ(v) = 0
(1)
Bottom Shape Analysis.
In
order
to
analyze
the
shape of the bottom part
of the floating island, we
define another calculation:
half-distribution analysis of
the image shape. This calculation is similar to the previous
distribution analysis process. But, this time, we introduce
two texcoords vmin and vmax., which is the left most point
and right most point on the image shape. Mathematically,

vmin / max = min / max{v|∃u ∈ [0, 1] ⇒ I(u, v) = 1}.
Then, as shown in the above figure, the bottom shape
curve
cb(v)
can
be
calculated
through
this
formula:
cb(v) = µ(v) + σ(v) − [(1 − t)µ(vmin) + tµ(vmax)], where
t = (v − vmin)/(vmax − vmin). Then, the bottom basemap
B′(u, v) = cb(v)B(u, v), where B(u, v) is the basemap
function defined in Equation 1.
Floating Island Generation. After the top basemap and
bottom basemap are calculated, the floating island is ready to
be assembled from those elevation maps. The top heightmap
of the floating island is Htop(u, v) = αtop(βtopB(u, v) + (1 −
βtop)H0(u, v)). As the bottom heightmap of the floating island
is beneath the sea level, therefore αbottom < 0. Then, we have
the bottom heightmap of the floating island as: Hbottom(u, v) =
αbottom(βbottomB′(u, v)+(1−βbottom)H0(u, v)). After the final
generation of the top mesh and buttom mesh using these
heightmap equations, we add another mesh called middle mesh
to make up the intervals between these two meshes. Then, the
final floating island is generated with our approach.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In order to validate the effectiveness of our approach, we
have conducted a series of computational experiments. As
shown in Figure 4, we have collected six different digital
paintings of floating island design. Given these designs, we run
our algorithms to automatically generate the floating islands
that are resembling the original input designs. We have im-
plemented our algorithms on Unity 3D with the 2019 version.
The hardware configurations contain Intel Core i5 CPU, 32GB
DDR4 RAM, and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 4GB GDDR6
Graphics Card. Figure 4 shows the results of the procedural
floating island generations with the following settings. For the
top terrain mesh, the settings are: heightmap scale αtop = 0.2;
basemap scale βtop = 0.2. For the bottom terrain mesh, the
settings are: heightmap scale αbottom = 0.8; basemap scale
βbottom = −2.5. The terrain feature heightmap H0(u, v) is
generated with the standard canyon filters. Subfigures are
showing the top view and front view, respectively, for each
synthesized 3D floating island terrain.

Fig. 5. Experimental results of changing terrain features and textures. In this figure, we present the visual effects when applying
different types of terrain features on the same digital painting input. The first column shows the synthesized floating islands
on the first digital painting input with different terrain features. The second column shows the synthesized floating islands on
the second digital painting input with different terrain features. The first row shows the synthesized floating islands with stony
mountain-style features for the first design and the second design, respectively. The second row and the third row show the
synthesized floating islands with the glaciers landscape style and the volcanic landscape style, respectively.
As we can see from Figure 4, the generated floating islands
are matching well with the user’s conceptual digital painting
designs. For example, in subfigure (b), we can see three
spherical blocks specified in the user’s original digital painting
design as plotted in the left-bottom corner where the blocks
on two sides are smaller than the center block. The same
effects appear in the result. Also, in order to consider the
foreshortening effects on the digital painting concept design
from an orthogonal view, we provide an automatic scaling step
to stretch the top image (green part) so that the 3D results are
zoomed-in along the z-axis of depth direction. By default, the
scaling factor is set to 1.5 and this effect is obvious in subfigure
(d). Users can also manually set up this scaling factor to adjust
the synthesized 3D outputs to satisfy their expectations.
Changing Terrain Features and Textures. Besides testing
our proposed interface with different user inputs, we have
tested the robustness of our approach on different types of
terrain features and terrain textures. As shown in Figure 5, with
the same terrain settings as claimed before, different terrain
features are added onto the generated floating islands. In this
experiment, we take two different digital paintings from users
as inputs. For each input, we applied three different types
of terrain features and textures. These are: stony mountain
style textures, glaciers landscape style textures, and volcanic
landscape style textures, respectively. As shown in the results,
our approach can not only generate realistic floating islands
according to users’ different digital paint designs, but also can
be able to add different types of terrain features.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we present IslandPaint, a smart user interface
for digital painting-driven floating island design. In order to
let users efficiently design the 3D floating islands with simple
2D single-view conceptual digital paintings, we proposed a
novel approach to automatically extract the 3D information
hidden in the conceptual designs. We first propose a hypothesis
that the users’ paintings are focused on flat floating islands.
Then, we segmented the top shape and bottom shape using an
image segmentation algorithm. In the next steps, we extract the
polygon geometry from the top image and extract the height
information from the bottom image. Therefore, we can recon-
struct the floating islands whose top views are matching with
the top image correctly while the front views are matching
with the bottom image correctly. Then, after the procedural
modeling process proposed by us, 3D floating islands that
look like the original 2D paintings will be automatically
generated. As shown in the experimental results, we validated
our approach through different user’s digital painting designs
and the results look promising. At the same time, we tested
our interface on different types of terrain features. Both results
show that our approach can be compatible and extended with
existing terrain procedural modeling technologies very well.
However, there still are some limitations in our work. First,
our approach is based on the hypothesis that the user’s digital
paintings are merely referred to as those floating islands that
have flat top surfaces. As a matter of fact, there are lots of
floating island design works that are referring to the bumping
terrains. Therefore, our approach will not be able to work
correctly on these scenarios. In order to solve this, it will rely
on proposing an optimization framework to extract the 3D
information from the 2D paintings by minimizing the costs
functions that are evaluating how well the reconstructed 3D
information matches with the perceived 2D information. This
is a challenging topic and is worthy to explore as future work.
On the other hand, our interface does not allow users to add too
many details on the terrain surface. This limited the freedom
of degree on user’s artistic creations. However, by adding more
details of the design, such as wrinkles, the degree of the user’s
control over the floating island design process will improve
significantly. This is another challenging topic to try as the
follow-up of this research work.
According to the experimental demonstration of our pro-
posed interface presented in this paper, we believe that, using
the interface of IslandPaint proposed by us, floating islands
design will become easier for digital art designers, digital
multimedia producers, digital movie makers, and digital game
authors in the near future. Also, we believe that our work opens
an interesting research topic on interactive procedural floating
island design and will attract more researchers to further
explore academic studies along this direction and follow up
with the technical approaches presented in this paper.

Abstract—As Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have become
popular and democratic in recent years, academic researchers
have been exploring ways to employ advanced VR technologies
in traditional education and edutainment. In this paper, we
present comprehensive digital transformation case study plans
about how to apply VR technologies to modern educations. In
our proposal, the teacher standing in front of a blackboard is
teaching in a classroom in a traditional way, while, after the
digital transformation through our case study plan, the teacher
will teach in virtual reality and students will present in a virtual
classroom. In this paper, we will explore and prospect important
considerations for achieving such a goal through our case study
plans.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of electronic multimedia tech-
nologies, education has become an interesting area for fast
digital transformation. Such evolution in digital transformation
from traditional education towards electronic education is
inevitable due to the upgrade of modern computer technolo-
gies. In particular, Computer Graphics Animations (CGA) and
Virtual Reality (VR) are two powerful areas that can affect
the education industry in a tremendous way. With a realistic
graphics rendering engine, various types of amazing effects
can be visualized realistically on screens, or even on immersive
devices such as virtual reality display headsets. This opens a
novel vision of how education can affect students’ lives.
Many recent research works have focused on VR education
and VR training. Some examples include: children education
proposed by Roussou et al. [1], immersive virtual reality
museum educational tool proposed by Huang et al. [2], and vir-
tual reality-based rehabilitation training applications for people
with intellectual disabilities developed by Standen et al. [3]. In
addition, Matsentidou et al. [4] developed a VR application for
training and enhancing the social skills of children with autism
through immersive visualizations in a VR cave environment,
Webster et al. [5] proposed an immersive virtual learning
environment for corrosion prevention and control training,
Chang et al. [6] proposed an immersive virtual environment for
foreign language teaching, Bastiaens et al. [7] studied the role
of virtual world design for supply chain education, Rahimian
et al. [8] developed an immersive game-like virtual real-
ity interface for Architecture-Engineering-Construction (AEC)
professionals education, Ali et al. [9] devised an interactive
virtual chemistry laboratory for simulation of high school 
experiments, Griol et al. [10] proposed an approach to de-
velop intelligent learning environments by means of immersive 
virtual worlds, Braun et al. [11] populated a virtual learning 
environment for interpreting students with bilingual dialogues 
to support situated learning in an institutional context, Kleven 
[12] proposed an approach for medical training and health 
education 
through 
a 
virtual 
university 
hospital, 
De 
Ribaupierre et al. [13] developed virtual reality serious 
games for healthcare training enhancement, Roussou [14] 
studied young learn-ers’ activity within interactive virtual 
environments, Detlefsen [15] proposed a method to teach 
middle-school children astronomy using ego-centric virtual 
reality, and Izatt et al. [16] proposed an immersive 
visualization and fitting tool for neutrino physics education.
However, no research works have proposed a comprehensive 
case study plan on how to apply a thorough digital transfor-
mation from traditional education towards VR education. In 
this paper, we discuss the important facts about the teaching 
strategies in VR. Next, we propose three detailed case study 
plans for elementary school classes for teaching Chinese as 
a second language in virtual reality. These case study plans 
include (1) VR classroom activities, (2) a full VR lesson 
design, and (3) a multi-cultural project. In the end, we illustrate 
the diagnostic assessments for differentiation of students in a 
VR class.
II. TEACHING STRATEGIES IN VR
An important question is: through VR technologies, what 
are the teaching strategies and activities that the teachers 
should plan to use to help students meet the lesson’s objec-
tives? In addition, what are the steps that the teacher will take 
to deliver this lesson (e.g., introduce the author, read the poem, 
etc.)? In this section, we list what we expect the teacher and 
students to do as part of this activity through VR teachings.
Critical Thinking. Critical thinking is very important for 
education. For example, in order to let the students think, 
students can be asked to write down the advantages and 
disadvantages of their choice of careers. Also, students can 
be asked to evaluate themselves and their peers, come up with 
a self-reflection, and revise the project at the end. In the end, 
such activity can be simulated in a virtual classroom that gives 
students rewards through virtual things such as VR flowers and

DIGITAL 2021 : Advances on Societal Digital Transformation

40
VR toys, etc. to increase the students’ interest in answering
questions.
Group Work. In a VR classroom, students can be asked
to evaluate their classmates and peers. Also, students can be
asked to finish a task in their group by collaborating in VR.
Literacy skills.
Finally, students can present their final
work in writing and deliver it through electronic documents.
This part can be done in VR living writing boards.
III. CASE STUDY PLAN I: VR CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES
In this section, we give some example of classroom activi-
ties planned for VR.
A. Activity1: Present Topic ”Me and My Family” in VR.
We design a class activity in VR that allows students
to present the topic ”Me and My Family” in the a virtual
classroom. In this class, the teacher will send the learning
material to the students in advance, and they will present what
they learn in the virtual class. The purpose of this activity is to
stimulate the students’ learning motivation, make connections
with the language skills and real-world, as well as prompt the
students’ critical thinking and group work skills.
Before the VR Class. The teacher will send the instruc-
tions’ video and the Quizlet link to the teams 3 days in
advance. The students will learn the new words by themselves
using Quizlet. The students will make a presentation about the
topic before the lesson and present it in the virtual class. After
the students finish their presentation, they will hand it in, and
the teacher will let them know if they need to add something
to reach the presentation standards.
During the VR Class. The students will present the topic
in the VR classroom, including basic information about family
members, their jobs and their own dream school, dream job,
what are the advantages and disadvantages of choosing their
dream school, why they choose a particular career, and so on.
The students can choose VR video or VR slides, or VR 3D
animation for this presentation. After that, the students will
be asked to review their own presentation and their peers’
presentation, writing feedback on the presentation through VR
interactions.
After the VR Class. The students will be asked to revise
their presentation and write down their self-reflection on what
they learned from the presentation and how they can make
it better next time. After that, they will hand in the final
work for evaluation by the teacher. Also, the students will be
asked to evaluate their experience in the VR classroom. This
is important for improving the VR classroom application.
B. Activity2: Learning new Vocabulary and Sentences in VR.
Through help with VR applications, teachers may give
the students more supportive and specific comments on their
work through VR interactions. Teachers can comment on the
students work and give them positive feedback, but that may
not be specific enough in traditional classroom. Rather, in a
VR classroom, teachers can give more specific feedback to the
students and make the students feel they really did a great job
on the presentation through VR gifts. Secondly, VR apps can
remind teachers to ask students’ opinions regarding previous
presenters. In addition, VR apps can make the students interact
more with each other, not only present by themselves. They
can also discuss some points with their classmates through VR
chat boards. Below is the detailed plan.
Before the VR Class. The students will be given the vocab-
ulary Quizlet link in advance. They will study by themselves
at home through the VR headset and will have a competition
that will include the entire VR class.
During the VR Class. The students will be evaluated by
the teacher if they already understand the pronunciation of
the new vocabulary during the VR class. Besides, there will
be a quiz competition to see if the students understand the
meaning of the new vocabulary. The teacher will observe and
take notes in the process of evaluating and make reteach plans
as necessary through VR animations.
After the VR Class. The students will be asked to draw a
picture or write a sentence using VR controllers, or explain in
a different language the words they found hard to understand
in VR.
IV. CASE STUDY PLAN II: A FULL VR LESSON DESIGN
Here, an example of a full VR lesson design is presented.
The target amount of time for the full lesson is 40 minutes.
During the VR class, first, let the students use Pin Yin to
read simple texts independently. Then, let the students write
in VR by dictating the Chinese characters to be learned under
the Four Skills Requirement (listening, speaking, reading, and
writing). After that, let the students understand basic, simple
language materials closely related to their personal lives and
everyday situations. In the end, let students continue to develop
good habits in listening and speaking. Students will be able
to present the topic ”Me and My family” in Chinese. Students
will be able to connect the prior knowledge (such as my
family, hobbies, etc.) to the new knowledge (such as career,
occupations, etc.). Students will be able to talk about their
dream school and dream job in a critical way.
Evaluations of VR Class. The evaluation of the VR class
can be done through three criteria: (1) Whether the students
can use Chinese to do presentations; (2) Whether the students
can pronounce different job names in Chinese correctly; (3)
Whether the students can work in a team or individually to
finish the Quizlet task on understanding the meaning of new
words.
Student Diversity and Differentiation. Different students
develop different skills according to their own personal weak
points. For listening, teachers can give the same instructions to
the whole class, but check with everyone if they understand
the instructions or if they need extra support. For example,
teachers can use some English to explain complicated instruc-
tions. Teachers can use Chinese to talk to advanced students to
meet their needs. For reading comprehension, students can be

41
asked to read most of the content. Teachers can ask students’
opinions to see if they need help through VR hints. Students
can use simple words and sentences in their presentation,
but VR gizmos can help students improve the vocabulary
when they need it. For speaking, when students are doing
presentations, since they prepare in advance, there might not
a big problem with it. However, when it comes to answering
questions, teachers can give them a chance to choose the
question they feel comfortable answering by doing VR quests.
This way, the students with lower speaking ability will not
feel nervous in the class. For writing, there can be writing
homework after the VR class.
Formative and Summative Assessments. As shown in the
described in-class activity of the presentation on the topic ”Me
and My Family”, students will present the topic in the VR
classroom, including basic information about family members,
their jobs and their own dream school, their dream job, what
are the advantages and disadvantages to choosing their dream
school, why they choose their career, and so on. They can
choose VR video or VR PPT for this presentation. As for
dictation, there can be a dictation in VR or by VR robot for
this unit about the words learned that day. There can also be a
Quizlet competition on vocabulary-related jobs. After the unit,
at the end of the week, there will be a summative assessment
on the topic of career, including speaking, reading compre-
hension, writing, listening, and other VR class activities.
V. CASE STUDY PLAN III: A MULTI-CULTURAL PROJECT
Project Overview. Here, we give an example of a VR class
project proposal called Minorities in China. The China Studies
program includes multi-cultural projects about the ancient
town of Lijiang and Naxi culture in China, in which students
will learn about China’s ethnic cultures and special cultural
practices. The Social Studies course includes ”Passport to the
World”, which will lead students to understand the cultures
and cultural differences around the world. Therefore, the idea
of this project was born with the idea of leading students to
understand the culture and cultural differences of China and
other parts of the world through the Google Earth VR app, and
by consulting materials and personal experience and making a
culture introduction VR PPT about a certain place on Google
Earth through virtual tours.
Project Objective. Students can learn to use VR technology
tools (such as Google Earth App) to search information and
sort out the information in a logical sequence. The community
can understand more about the minorities in China after
listening to the students’ presentations. The whole school
community would be more respectful of different cultures and
have a better understanding of the school mission.
Project Description. All the students are divided into four
groups. In the VR class of Chinese studies, they will learn
about the minority cultures of Naxi and the ancient town
of Lijiang under the guidance of the teacher and they will
experience the secrets of minority cultures in the process
of learning Dongba pictographs through VR applications.
Then, the teacher will introduce the cultural characteristics
of different countries in theme classes. Later, the teacher will
introduce several minority cultures other than Dongba culture,
such as African minority culture, American Indian culture,
etc. on VR Google Earth. The students will be allowed to
choose or search the minority culture they are interested in.
Later, the information will be collected in groups in order
for the students to learn about the cultural characteristics of
ethnic minorities they are interested in, to introduce them to
their parents at home, and make a VR PPT. In the end, the
students will collect information and write interview questions.
They will interview teachers or adults at school about their
understanding of the minority culture and their first impression
of it. The students will make VR posters to briefly introduce
this special culture and put them on the doors and windows in
the virtual classroom. These proposed VR class projects align
with the missions in art, technology, and culture. This project
aligns with culture. In the implementation of this VR project,
teachers will link it to the art class and students will create
VR posters to demonstrate different minorities. All students
will use VR technology tools to search for information and
show the presentation, so this project aligns with technology
and art as well.
Project Syllabus. In weeks 1-2, the teachers will introduce
the minority groups to the whole class through the VR
classroom. Then, the students will discuss what impressed
them and what are the minority groups they are interested
in. Then, the students will choose a minority group in China
to explore in the Google Earth VR app. Between weeks 3-6,
the students will work in a group to search information such
as facts, traditions, taboos, dress, etc. In week 7, the students
will present and make the survey in the VR classroom. They
will also be giving presentations to the community members
in the school to introduce different minorities and interview
the community’s opinions regarding different minorities. In
week 8, the students will have an evaluation. They will make
posters and post them in different places in the VR classrooms.
Teachers will use this rubric to evaluate the students work and
their projects.
VI. DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS FOR DIFFERENTIATION
Importance. The data collected from the pre-assessments
in VR education can help the teacher easily have a general
idea about the students’ learning stages. It is important to
know the students in-depth as well. It can also guide the
formative assessment or the summative assessment later in the
learning process. Teachers can target the students’ weaknesses
to give instructions and assessments for the students through
personalized VR classes. It is important for grouping as well.
Either for homogeneous or heterogeneous grouping methods,
the teachers need to know the differences between the students
in advance. Teachers can give specific support with the data
collected from the students. This is similar to a doctor helping
the patient according to the diagnostic results. For teachers
themselves, it can also be helpful. Teachers can use the data to

DIGITAL 2021 : Advances on Societal Digital Transformation
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2021. ISBN: 978-1-61208-927-0
42
make teaching plans and learning objectives instead of wasting
time teaching subjects all the students already learned or
understand. For example, when the teachers get the data from
the pre-assessment, they can delete the object that may appear
on the standard guidelines, but actually, for these students, they
all get a good understanding of it. In this way, time can be
saved for both teachers and students. Meanwhile, the learning
proficiency and effectiveness are improved. This practice can
also help with school-wide learning. By getting the data on
the students, teachers from the whole school can find out the
weaknesses of the students and can also cooperate with each
other to help the students according to the pre-assessment data.
This is also useful for parents’ communication. With the data
of the pre-assessment, teachers can easily have the evidence to
show the parents how much their kids improved and in what
areas the progress was made.
Impact on Students. In a VR classroom, the students can be
both interested and challenged. They will listen more carefully
and pay more attention to what they are doing because the
teaching content can be both interesting and challenging for
most of the students due to the powerful algorithms employed
in VR applications. They will get a chance to improve them-
selves by focusing on whatever they need according to the pre-
assessment. The students will enjoy group work more because
teachers can form the groups according to the pre-assessment
results and the VR is user-friendly for easy interactions. The
grouping method will make all of the students feel comfortable
and safe, which can improve the working efficiency at the
same time. The students will get an idea on what the teachers’
expectation is and will have a clear aim about what they need
to do at the next stage. Students will be less stressed when they
face summative assessments at the middle or the end of the
semester because they know that, although there will not be the
exact same questions, the learning objective will be the same,
and if they work hard during the learning process, they will
make progress for sure. Students will be more motivated in the
VR classroom. Students will participate more in the different
VR activities because they know that all of the assessments
are related to each other; if they work hard, they can get a
good result at the summative assessment. Meanwhile, they will
enjoy the VR interface of the virtual school.
Pre-Assessment vs. Summative Assessment. How can
teachers align the pre-assessment and the summative assess-
ment for Chinese education in VR? After having the pre-
assessment (dictation for each unit) in VR, teachers will un-
derstand what they should focus on at the next teaching stage.
Then, teachers will finalize the learning goal for the whole
semester and arrange different goals into different learning
periods, such as monthly goals, weekly goals, even daily goals.
Then, when teachers prepare the summative assessment, they
can make sure all the content that appears in the assessment
had been taught already. Teachers can separate the small
goals into different learning units. They can give students pre-
assessment in VR (Quizlet and Kahoot, because for the CAL
students, most of the content are words and sentences.) on
every unit to find out the difficulties. After the pre-assessment,
the teachers can use the RTI method to separate students
into different groups. The teachers can give differentiated
instructions according to the pre-assessment results. They can
set up different goals for students in different tiers, give
different instructions, and design appropriate VR activities
for different students. They can summarize and review the
semester goal at the end of the semester. They can finalize
the summative assessment according to the students’ academic
performance in different tires and the pre-assessment results.
In addition, they can give students the summative assessment
containing the whole semester goal which aligns with the pre-
assessment as well.
Information from the Pre-assessment Data. Here, we
address the question on how can the data that teachers gather
from pre-assessment inform instruction and grouping practices
in the VR classroom as well as how to use this data to make the
teaching plan. Teachers will delete the objectives students al-
ready learned based on the pre-assessment data. Teachers will
focus more on the objectives students have common difficulties
with during the VR class activities. For the students who have
their own strengths, but show some difficulties, teachers will
differentiate when implementing activities. Teachers will use
the pre-assessment data to group the students according to
the different learning activities through the VR technologies.
Teachers will mix students with different levels when teachers
want them to help each other through VR communications.
Besides, when the teachers want to make the activity meet
each level of students’ needs, they will use a homogeneous
group of students. Collecting the pre-assessment data lets
teachers know exactly where each student stands compared
to their classmates and peers nationwide. So, teachers can
make different groups of students and give them differentiated
instructions. For example, if they have similar interests, they
will be grouped into one group when teachers have different
topics in the class, but towards the same teaching objectives.
When teachers want the students from different groups to
help each other, they will group students in a heterogeneous
way to mix students belonging to different levels into one
group. With the data of the pre-assessments, teachers can
use the it to develop individual academic learning goals with
students. Going beyond the individual student level, teachers
will collaborate with other teachers in the school and adjust the
school-wide goal. For example, the pre-assessment data can be
used when developing Chinese teaching VR apps. Teachers
will delete the learning objectives of the words and skills
all students already have based on the pre-assessment. The
teachers will make a record about the pre-assessment for other
teachers’ reference. If teachers feel a learning goal should be
moved from the VR classes, they will suggest making some
changes to the VR teaching package.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present several thorough case study plans
for welcoming the digital transformation from traditional ed-
ucation towards VR education. We first discuss the important

DIGITAL 2021 : Advances on Societal Digital Transformation

43
facts about the teaching strategies in VR by addressing four
factors in VR language education: (1) Critical Thinking,
(2) Group Work, and (3) Literacy skills. Then, we propose
three detailed case study plans for elementary school classes
teaching Chinese as a second language in virtual reality.
These case study plans include (1) VR Classroom Activities,
(2) A Full VR Lesson Design, and (3) A Multi-Cultural
Project. In the end, we illustrate the diagnostic assessments
for differentiation of students in VR class. As for the VR
classroom activities plans, we propose two different in-class
activities: (1) student presentations in VR and (2) learning
new vocabulary and sentences in VR. In the full VR lesson
design, teachers will emphasize students’ skills in reading
using Pin Yin, students’ skills in writing with VR by dictating
the Chinese characters and students’ understanding of basic,
simple language materials closely related to their personal lives
and everyday situations. In the multicultural project, students
will learn about China’s ethnic cultures and special cultural
practices through VR Google Earth App and learn to speak
Chinese as a second language at the same time. In future
work, we will extend our proposal into a real VR teaching
application package and conduct a large-scale user study
to apply such teaching plans to elementary schools’ digital
education. We believe our proposal and follow-up works will
become stepping stones to open a new age of digital education
through virtual reality.

Abstract—With the rapid development of Virtual Reality (VR)
technologies in recent years, VR displays have become more pop-
ular, democratic, and attractive for users. Therefore, academic
researchers are exploring the way to employ advanced VR tech-
nologies to achieve a smooth digital transfer from traditional user
interfaces towards VR interfaces. In this paper, we present Make
OS Home: a digital transformation implementation prototype
from a traditional 2D-screen-based operating system towards
a home-like immersive 3D operating system in virtual reality.
We will present implementation details about the interactions
between users, VR controllers, and the operating system to
achieve such digital transformation on operating systems.
Keywords—digital transformation; operating system; virtual re-
ality; virtual desktop.
I. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of Virtual Reality (VR) tech-
nologies, there are more and more chances to transform the
traditional user interfaces into immersive user interfaces in
VR. Such evolution in digital transformation provides re-
searchers with lots of opportunities to explore how different
user interactions between 2D screens-based platforms and 3D
immersive VR platforms affect user experiences. Therefore,
many research works on user VR experiences have been
proposed in diverse aspects of life such as VR aided shape
modelings [1], VR education and training [2], VR enter-
tainments [3], VR sports [4], VR performance arts [5], VR
music [6], VR agriculture [7], VR business management [8],
etc. As one of the most fundamental studies of computer
science, operating system design is a very important topic
that can affect people’s daily work and life. VR technologies
provide infinite chances to change people’s feelings about the
operating system and computer-related working experiences.
Therefore, it is a promising topic to show how the evolution of
the operating systems can affect users’ experiences and how
to further extend such evolution through VR technologies.
During the 1980s, early ages of operating systems had no
Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), such as Microsoft’s MS-
DOS [9]. Since 1985, Windows 1.0 first introduced GUI.
Through various generations of the graphical Microsoft Win-
dows operating systems [10]. We have Windows 10 as the most
popular operating system today. As shown in Figure 2, the
earliest GUIs of Windows operating systems mainly consisted
of simple shapes, such as rectangles, rough vector icons, and
monotonic colors themes, such as green and grays. Until Win-
dows XP (2001), pictures were introduced into the main theme
of OS. At the same time, icons were more photo-realistic than
before which were drawn with simple vector graphics. Since
Windows VISTA (2006), 3D effects were introduced when
switching between windows using win+tab keys. This was a
great evolution in Windows OS and gave users great visual
effects. Later in Windows 7 (2009), while the 3D components
were being kept, transparent icons were introduced. This was
the peak masterpiece of work for windows with great visual
effects and impressive user experiences. But unfortunately,
due to the large amount of computation efforts that were
put on graphical computing, the system was tending to be
slow and wasting more electricity. Therefore, in Windows

Fig. 2. History of windows operating systems from Windows 1 (1985) to WIndows 10 (2015).
8.1 (2012) and Windows 10 (2015), the 3D and transparent
effects were removed. Then, system became faster and less
power-demanding. The advantage of Windows 10 was the
introduction of photo icons in the start menu. As we can
see, within these 30 years, there were more than 10 different
versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems. An obvious
trend can be seen that Windows operating systems are becom-
ing more and more user-friendly and environmental-friendly
while achieving stronger visual performance and optimizing
the system’s efficiency.
As advanced technologies in virtual reality are emerging,
a notion of ”working in VR” is appearing as well. Lots of
recent works are focused on moving workspace from the
real world to virtual space in VR. For example, as shown
in Figure 3 (a), immersed [11] presents a novel VR interface
for creating private working space, supporting multiple virtual
monitors without adding additional hardware. Also, immersed
is portable as it supports mobile and wireless headsets so that
it can be taken anywhere. As shown in Figure 3 (b), Virtual
Desktop [12] is an application developed for the Oculus Rift
/ Rift S, HTC Vive, Valve Index, and WMR (Windows Mixed
Reality) headsets that can visualize the screen of a computer
as a virtual screen in VR. As shown in Figure 3 (c), VR-
OS [13] is an operating system that replaces the monitor with
a head-mounted display in an immersive virtual environment.
It provides the virtual mouse and virtual keyboard that can
match with the real ones on the desk. VR-OS allows powerful
workflows in virtual reality platforms. As shown in Figure 3
(d), Falkengren et al. [14] presented a concept VR OS User
Interface (UI) that was developed with basic OS features, such
as viewing files and opening programs. As the closest work
to ours, Falkengren et al. [14] developed a prototype virtual
operating system that considers 3D icons and file browsers
through VR operations, such as fragging and dropping. But
unfortunately, all of those proposed works are actually pseudo-
3D visualizations where all displays, icons and browsers are
visualized through flat or curved virtual 3D surfaces which
look like 2D plat or curved screens hanging in the 3D virtual
environment. This visual effect lacks immersiveness.
Therefore, given these observations, we propose Make OS
Home: a home-like operating system in virtual reality. In Make
OS Home, all 3D icons can be created, dragged, and clicked
in full 3D space that is not restricted to a flat surface of the
pseudo-3D space. In this interface, users are able to manipulate
3D icons as if manipulating 3D things at home. During each
operation on 3D icons in the virtual environment, operating
system APIs will be invoked simultaneously to modify the
file system within the operating system. At the same time,
we provide a screen of the operating system through a virtual
monitor, so that users can identify the operations that happened
in the operating system while they are manipulating the 3D
icons using VR controllers. Our work reveals a novel aspect
and a new level of control degree for operating system user
interactions and GUI, which opens a new dimension of how
to interact with the operating system in an entirely immersive
way. In the future, by regarding our interactive interface of
Make OS Home as a prototype, extending our interfaces with
other types of operating system operations, such as hardware
settings, network settings, visualizing image and video within
3D volumes, and so forth, the GUI of the future operating
system will be entirely transferred in virtual reality. As shown
in Figure 1, a desktop of standard Windows 10 operating
system is shown in (a); Through the implementation presented
in this paper, the desktop will be transformed into a virtual
desktop in home-like environment through virtual reality as
shown in (b). The full demo of the video can be accessed at
[15] which shows manipulating folders and documents with
our devised VR interface.

II. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
In this section, we present the implementation details of
Make OS Home. In our implementation, we are mainly focus-
ing on how to connect the file systems in an operating system
with 3D virtual objects as manipulable icons in virtual reality
and how to display such files system through to two views
(1) a virtual monitor that records the screen of the operating
system and (2) the user’s 3D view in a virtual environment.
Our work extends an operating system with VR operations
through the proposed two views. We have implemented the
Make OS Home system using Unity 3D with the 2019 version.
We have implemented the VR interactive interface using the
Steam VR 2.0 plugin. The hardware configurations include
Intel Core i5 CPU, 32GB DDR4 RAM, and NVIDIA GeForce
GTX 1650 4GB GDDR6 Graphics Card. The VR program is
configured on Oculus Quest 2.0.
File System. Given our purpose to connect the file system
with VR objects of 3D icons, we propose an extended version
of the data structure to represent the file system. In our imple-
mentation, we mainly consider two types of files (1) a folder
and (2) a document. A folder can have an arbitrary number
of subfolders, a document has no subdocument. Therefore,
a file system is typically a tree data structure. Let us call a
node representing a folder or a document a file node, then,
the file system is the tree consisting of a root node and
its descendants. In our case, the root node is the desktop
folder, and other subfolders on the desktop are its children. As
shown in Figure 4, a detailed representation of the file node is
presented. We store the file information, such as file name and
file type (folder or document) within a class called FileValue.
FileValue also contains the icon object which is a game object
in Unity and the icon behaviour which is a C# class defining
the interactions between icon and VR controllers. FileValue is
always paired with a string called FileKey. The reason is we
have maintained all file nodes not only in a file tree, but also
in a Hash table for easy access.

component of a file system in our Make OS Home interface.
Different colors represents different C# classes in Unity.
User
Interactions. We have
implemented several different file
operations, such as creating file
icons, dragging file icons, scal-
ing file icons, and delete file
icons. Each operation is followed
by a selection detection, which
is achieved by calculating a line intersection between the
lightsaber shooting out from the controller and the selected
object. After the selected object is determined, we will check
whether there is a click on the right controller. If so, we will
react according to which icon is selected: if the selected icon
is the create folder or create document icon as shown in the
figure above where there are green plus signs attached, then,
we will call the system API to create that file at the current
path. Otherwise, if the selected icon is a subfolder of the
current folder, we will switch to that subfolder where all of
the children files or documents in that subfolder will appear.
Perhaps, the selected icon is a
document in the current folder. In
this case, we will call a system
API to run a notepad app to open
such text file. Or, if the selected
file icon is the current folder it-
self, then, we will hide all of the
children subfolders and switch to its parent folder. If there
are no clicks from the grab button on the right controller,
then, we will detect whether the pinch button is pressed. If so,
a dragging operation is applied on that file icon. If that file
icon is dragged into a recycle bin icon as shown in the figure
above, then, we will call a system API to remove that folder
or file recursively. This operation can be achieved by adding
a specially tagged collider onto the recycle bin so that every
game object that hit the recycle bin will disappear. During the
dragging operation, the user can also push the joystick up with
the thumb to zoom in the 3D icon or push the thumb down
to zoom out the 3D icon in the virtual environment.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we give a frame-by-frame demo of a running
example to illustrate our proposed system. As shown in
Figure 5, subfigures (1)-(3) demonstrate a process to zoom
in and zoom out the desktop icon in VR. Users first point
their controllers towards the desktop icon in VR. Then, the
shining bounding box will pop up (1). When holding the pinch
button down, users can push the joystick on the controller
up and down to zoom in the desktop icon (2) and zoom
out the desktop icon (3). Subfigures (4)-(9) demonstrate a
process to create a folder and delete a folder. After a click
at the desktop icon with the grab button on the controller,
the create folder/document icon will pop up (4). After another
click at the create folder icon (5), a new folder icon will be
created randomly between the controller’s position and the
desktop icon position using a randomized linear interpolation
(6). Then, users can drag the folder icon in mid-air (7) until
it hits the recycle bin icon (8), the folder icon disappears (9).
Note that the 2D folder icon on the desktop in the virtual
screen appears and disappears together with the 3D folder icon
simultaneously, as the system API is called to create and delete
the file along with the user’s VR operation automatically. Also,
the screen recorder API will update the VR monitor screen’s
texture to reflect the changes made in the operating system.
There is another testing case in this experiment as shown in
Figure 6. This time, the user creates a folder (1) but does
not drag the folder to the recycle bin, instead, somewhere
else nearby (2). When the user clicks on the folder icon, the
user will navigate into that folder (3). If users click the create
icon again, the files will be created under that folder. (4)-(6)
show the process to create and drag a folder while (7)-(9) are
creating and dragging a text document.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we present Make OS Home: a digital trans-
formation implementation prototype from a traditional 2D-
screen-based operating system towards a home-like immersive
3D operating system in virtual reality. We demonstrate the
functionalities of our proposed interface in the experiments.
Through Make OS Home, users can successfully create, nav-
igate, and delete the files when operating 3D icons in VR.

In future work, we will extend our proposed system by
adding new features, such as moving folders into another
through dragging the icons similar to the delete operation,
adding a start menu in VR to trigger more apps other than the
notepad app, adding hardware configuration settings in VR,
adding network connections in VR, and rendering 3D images
in VR, etc. In the end, we intend to build an entirely new VR
OS without relying on another existing OS, such as Windows.
We believe our work can open the new dimension to think
about how the future operating systems will look like on a
VR platform.
