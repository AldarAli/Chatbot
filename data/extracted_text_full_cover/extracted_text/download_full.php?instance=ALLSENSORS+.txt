ALLSENSORS 2020
Forward
The Fifth Conference on Advances in Sensors, Actuators, Metering and Sensing (ALLSENSORS
2020) covered related topics on theory practice and applications of sensor devices, techniques,
data acquisition and processing, and on wired and wireless sensors and sensor networks.
Sensor networks and sensor-based systems support many applications today above ground.
Underwater operations and applications are quite limited by comparison. Most applications
refer to remotely controlled submersibles and wide-area data collection systems at a coarse
granularity. Other remote sensing domains and applications are using special sensing devices
and services. Transducers and actuators complement the monitoring and control and constitute
an area of interest related to sensors. They make use of specific sensor-based measurements
and convey appropriate control actions.
ALLSENSORS 2020 was intended to serve as a forum for researchers from the academia and the
industry, professionals, standard developers, policy makers, investors and practitioners to
present their recent results, to exchange ideas, and to establish new partnerships and
collaborations.
The accepted papers covered a large spectrum of topics on techniques and applications, best
practices, awareness and experiences as well as future trends and needs (both in research and
practice) related to all aspects of sensor-based applications and services.
We take here the opportunity to warmly thank all the members of the ALLSENSORS 2020
technical program committee as well as the numerous reviewers. The creation of such a broad
and high quality conference program would not have been possible without their involvement.
We also kindly thank all the authors that dedicated much of their time and efforts to contribute
to the ALLSENSORS 2020. We truly believe that thanks to all these efforts, the final conference
program consists of top quality contributions.
This event could also not have been a reality without the support of many individuals,
organizations and sponsors. In addition, we also gratefully thank the members of the
ALLSENSORS 2020 organizing committee for their help in handling the logistics and for their
work that is making this professional meeting a success.
We hope the ALLSENSORS 2020 was a successful international forum for the exchange of ideas
and results between academia and industry and to promote further progress on the topics of
sensors.

Abstract— In this contribution, we show the advances in the
direction of designing Radiofrequency Identification (RFID)
antennas with sensing capabilities. In this particular case, we
have integrated a force/pressure sensor made of a silicon-based
organic polymer in one of the arms of a dipole antenna made of
silver paste. The sensor response to external forces modifies the
resonance frequency of the dipole antenna that can be detected
by an external RFID reader, building up a wireless force sensor
system.

I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we focus on the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF)
band (860 MHz) that is commonly used for Radiofrequency
Identification (RFID) tags and communications. In particular,
lots of effort has been made in the past decades to develop
antennas operating in this frequency band with the so-called
printed electronics [1]-[3]. The reasons behind this are the
attractive features that such technology offers with respect to
conventional ones, like the feasibility of creating electronics in
virtually any substrate, its cost-effectiveness and large-scale
manufacturing, among others [4]. There are many examples in
the literature where printed UHF antennas are embedded in
RFID tags with sensing capabilities [5]-[7]. However, these
tags require the utilization of silicon chips to transmit the
information, leading to hybrid electronics, which slows the
fabrication
process
and
makes
more
difficult
their
industrialisation [8]. An alternative that has arisen interest in
the last years is the implementation of wireless chipless
sensors. The characteristic of these sensor tags is the design of
sensors
whose
information
is
associated
with
their
electromagnetic properties, such as the resonance frequency or
the threshold power magnitude [9].
What we describe in this paper is precisely an UHF
chipless sensor for pressure detection. The sensor is fabricated
by
screen
printing
of
silver
and
poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) and its working principle is the variation in the
resonance frequency when a certain pressure is applied in the
UHF antenna.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2,
the fabrication of the sensor and its characterization are
presented. The results of the sensor’ characterization are shown
in Section 3, together with the discussion. Finally, the main
conclusions are drawn in Section 4.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
The silver (Ag) screen printing paste employed in this work
to print the antenna was LOCTITE ECI 1010 0.2KG E&C by
Henkel (Germany) used without modifications. An array of
pillar was made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) formulated
as in [10], but deposited with screen printing. All pastes were
printed
onto
thermally
pre-heated
(100°C
for
30
min)
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) Melinex 506 of DuPont of a
thickness of 100 µm. A manual screen printer (Nino from
Coruna, Switzerland) was used to print with a screen with 120
threads/cm of mesh density. After printing, the pastes were
dried at 100°C for 30 min in an Memmert oven before printing
the next type of paste.
The E5061B ENA Vector Network Analyzer of Keyight
was utilized for the S11 parameter measurements, as described
in [11]. Similar capacitive pressure sensors were already
studied in [12].
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We investigated the use of our thin pressure sensors
without a dielectric, as these are shorted at a certain pressure.
Figure 1 shows the patterned area that acts as the sensor. The
dielectric
is
structured
in
pillars
and
the
contact
area
corresponds precisely to the areas between pillars when certain
pressure is applied in the patterned area. At UHF frequency,
the sensor device behaves as a capacitor in series with one of
the antenna dipole arms. When pressure is applied, the sensor
device behaves as a series resistor, ideally a short-circuit,
leading to a change in both the resonance frequency and the
magnitude, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 1. Pressure-sensing area.
We studied the frequency response, represented in Figure 2,
by pressing and releasing several times with a plastic clamp
(button area) over the sensor area.
Figure 2. S11 magnitude for open and close states. Close 0 corresponds to the
first attemp of closing the button, followed by Open when the button is
released and finally Close 1 when the button is pressed again.
The dipole antenna that can be modelled as RLC series
circuit was designed to resonate at 868 MHz when the sensor
is pressed. When the sensor is released, a small series
capacitance is added to the dipole series capacitance causing a
shift of the resonance frequency upwards. This detuning of the
resonance frequency is enough to be discriminated by an
RFID reader, but it is not enough to inhibit the wireless link
between the reader and the sensor tag.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this contribution, we present the possibility of designing
a printed UHF sensor for force detection based on PDMS and
silver on a flexible substrate. In particular, there is a shift in the
resonance frequency as well as a change in its magnitude when
the force is applied in the area where the structured PDMS has
been deposited. When pressing the mentioned area, the
resonance frequency is increased and its magnitude decreases.
This solution paves the way for including sensor information in
printed RFID antennas. In the future, we will study in depth the
influence of the force applied on the resonance frequency
together with the analysis of the area where the structured
PDMS is located.

Abstract—This work presents a novel approach for the
fabrication of Electrochemical Capacitors (ECs) based on the
screen-printing of a commercial carbon-based conductive ink
on flexible substrates. This technique enables the fast and cost-
effective
production
of
ECs
with
high
flexibility
and
outstanding performance over bending states and voltage
cycling, as demonstrated by means of cyclic voltammetry and
galvanometric charge-discharge measurements. Despite the
fact that the specific areal capacitances achieved are lower
than the ones obtained using other carbon-based materials
(~22 µF/cm2), the results show that, as soon as new screen-
printable
carbon-based
pastes
become
available,
this
fabrication method will enable the mass production of ECs
that can be attached to any surface as a conformal patch, as it
is being required by a large number of the emerging
technological applications.

I.
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, flexible electronics has attracted the
attention of many researches. This technology is expected to
cause a disruption in the field of electronics devices, since it
arises from the need to fulfill the demands required by novel
technological applications, such as wearables or biomedical
sensors, which cannot be addressed by means of the
traditional
silicon-based
electronics
[1].
Many
of
the
advances in this context come with the emergence of new
conductive and flexible materials. Examples of those are
Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) [2], graphene and its derivatives
[3]-[5], or silver nanowires (AgNWs) and nanoparticles
(AgNPs)
[6][7].
Additionally,
alternative
fabrication
processes enabling cost-effective processing on large flexible
substrates are targeted. Those processes include printing
technologies or laser treatment approaches, among others
[8][9].
Thus, the combination of these two emerging lines of
research has resulted in the development of many flexible
electronics
devices,
including
sensors
[10][11],
Radio
Frequency Identification Tags (RFID) [12][13] and antennas
[14][15]. Besides, apart from these latter, the flexible
electronics progress is also requiring of flexible energy
storage devices that, combined with energy harvesting
technologies, contribute to the development of self-powered
devices [16].
Numerous studies have been conducted to examine
different materials as electrodes for the fabrication of flexible
Electrochemical Capacitors (ECs). Among them, carbon-
based materials are the preferred to play this role for several
reasons: i) exceptionally high surface area, ii) relatively high
electrical
conductivity
and
iii)
acceptable
cost
[17].
Examples of materials studied so far are Laser-Induced
Graphene (LIG) [18][19], reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO)
[20] and single walled CNTs [21]. Many researchers agree
that carbon-based electrodes will play an important role in
the supercapacitor technology and that is why a big effort is
being devoted to further optimizing its properties through
doping
[22]
or
surface
treatments
[23].
Besides,
the
performance of the electrochemical capacitors does not only
rely on the material of the electrodes, but also on the
electrolyte used. Therefore, it is also important to achieve a
proper
interaction
electrode-electrolyte.
Then,
different
acid/base/salt-Poly(Vinyl Alcohol) (PVA) gel electrolytes
have been widely studied for this purpose, being the
PVA/phosphoric acid (PVA/H3PO4) and the PVA/sulfuric
acid
(PVA/H2SO4)
the
ones
which
report
the
best
performance [24][25].
In this contribution, we present a novel approach for the
fabrication of flexible ECs based on the screen-printing of a
commercial carbon-based electrically conductive ink using
PVA/H3PO4 as electrolyte. We have opted for a 2D
architecture,
which
consists
of
several
InterDigital
Electrodes (IDEs) arranged on a flexible substrate, since this
configuration offers some advantages over the conventional
designs, such as lower thicknesses and smaller distances
between electrodes [16]. This paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes the materials and methods used. Section
III presents the performance of the presented ECs and,
finally, Section IV addresses the main conclusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Materials
Transparent polyester films for water-based inks with a
thickness of 160 µm (from ColorGATE Digital Output
Solutions GmbH, Hannover, Germany) were used as a
flexible substrate for the fabrication of the capacitors. The

name: C-220, was provided by Applied Ink Solutions
(Westborough, MA, USA). Both Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA,
Mw 31,000-50,000, 98-99% hydrolyzed) and phosphoric
acid (H3PO4, product name: 1005731000) were acquired
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Electrical access
to the capacitive devices was achieved using a silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs) screen printable ink (LOCTITE®
ECI 1010 E&C from Henkel AG, Düsseldorf, Germany).
B. Devices Fabrication
Figure 1 shows the scheme for the fabrication of the
carbon-based flexible electrochemical capacitors. First, the
in-plane interdigital electrodes were printed on the flexible
substrate using a 90 Nylon threads per centimeter (T/cm)
mesh with a FLAT-DX200 screen printing machine (from
Siebdruck-Versand, Magdeburg, Germany), as shown in
Figure 1a and 1b. The capacitive structure considered has the
following dimensions (number of fingers N: 20, width W: 1
mm, spacing S: 1 mm, interspacing i: 1 mm and length L: 1
cm), which results in an effective area of 4 cm2, see Figure
1c.
Following
the
manufacturer
recommendations,
the
samples were dried at a temperature of 130 ºC for 3 min to
remove all residual solvent using a UF55 oven (from
Memmert, Schwabach, Germany). Following the same
screen-printing process, electrical contacts were printed
using silver ink (Figure 1d), and the sample was dried
afterwards again (this time at 120 ºC for a duration of 15
min). Furthermore, the gel electrolyte was prepared by
dissolving 1 g of PVA in 10 mL of de-ionized water (10
wt%) with stirring at 80 ºC for 2 h using a VWR 12365-382
hot plate stirrer (from VWR International, Radnor, PA,
USA). Once the PVA was completely dissolved, 1.2 g of
H3PO4 was added to the solution and it was stirred for
another hour [26]-[28]. The final homogeneous gel solution
was drop casted (~1.5 mL) on the capacitive IDE structure
covering all the effective surface area (Figure 1e). Finally,
once the device is left standing overnight to remove the
excess of water, the EC looks as shown in Figure 1f.

C. Characterization
Microscope pictures were obtained with a ZEISS
Axioscope 5 (from Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).
The sheet resistances were measured through the four-point
method at a constant Direct Current (DC) of 100 µA using a
probe head from Jandel connected to a B2901A Keysight
(Keysight Technologies, Inc., CA, USA) Source Measuring
Unit
(SMU).
Cyclic
Voltammetry
(CV)
and
charge-
discharge measurements at Constant Current (CC) were
performed using a 2602B Keithley SMU from Tektronix Inc.
(Beaverton, OR, USA). The impedance of the samples was
obtained
using
the
impedance
analyzer
4294A
(from
Keysight Technologies, Inc., CA, USA). The performance of
the devices as a function of the temperature was studied
using
the
climate
chamber
VCL4006
(from
Vötsch
Industrietechnik GmbH, Balingen, Germany). A custom
bending setup was built to perform the bending tests using a
PD4-N5918M420 stepper motor together with a GPLE60
precision planetary gear (from Nanotec Electronic GmbH &
Co. KG, Feldkirchen, Germany). All the measurement setup
was automated using the software LabView 2017 (from
National Instruments Corporation, TX, USA).
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Microscope images of the screen-printed electrodes are
shown in Figure 2. On one hand, Figure 2a shows the
printing resolution achieved. From the microscope images, it
can be obtained that the average electrode width is W =
1.168 mm, while its interspacing and separation are found to
be i = 0.892 mm and S = 0.902 mm, respectively, as a
consequence of the paste spreading once it is deposited on
the substrate. On the other hand, the porous nature of the
carbon-based electrodes can be observed in Figure 2b. The
sheet resistance of these conductive patterns is 503.6 ± 74.4
Ω/sq.

First, the electrochemical performance of the ECs was
investigated
through
Cyclic
Voltammetry
(CV).
The
experiments were conducted considering a potential window
of ΔV = 1 V, from -0.5 V to +0.5 V, at different scanning 
rates (20 mV/s, 50 mV/s, 90 mV/s, 120 mV/s), as shown in
Figure 1a. It can be noted that the CV curves maintain the
quasi rectangular shape over the increasing scan rates,
indicating a good reversible Electrostatic Double-Layer
Capacitive (EDLC) behavior [29]. From these curves, the
capacitance can be calculated as follows:

where ΔV is the potential window, s the scan rate and I(V)
the current response as a function of the voltage [20]. The
results, depicted in Figure 3b, show an average capacitance
of ~12.5 µF (~3.1 µF/cm2). As seen, the capacitance does not
suffer from a considerable decrease as the scan rate
increases, which indicates a good interaction electrode-
electrolyte [30].

Galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements are also
commonly used for the characterization of ECs. The
resulting curves associated with these measurements are
displayed in Figure 3c. In this case, the quasi triangular
symmetric shape demonstrates a good charge propagation
across
the
carbon
electrodes
and
negligible
internal
resistances [31]. In the same way, these results can also be
used to calculate the specific capacitance by the following
equation:
ܥ௖௖=
ூ
ௗ௏/ௗ௧


where I is the discharge current and dV/dt the slope of
galvanostatic discharge curve [22]. In this case, the specific
capacitance obtained is around 86 µF (~22 µF/cm2) with a
slight decrease as the discharge current increases (ΔC/C0 =
4.7%), see Figure 3d. This specific areal capacitance is
similar to that obtained with other non-treated carbon
materials [32][33].
The outstanding performance of the ECs under different
bending conditions (r = 1.25 cm, 0.75 cm and 0.5 cm) is
demonstrated in Figure 4. It can be noted how the EC
presents almost unchanged CC and CV curves for the
different bending states, which would allow to use these ECs
in
conformal
applications
with
no
effect
on
their
electrochemical performance.
The electrochemical cycling durability of the ECs has
also been studied. The results, displayed in Figure 5, have
shown that the capacitors are able to retain their capacitance
even after 1000 bending cycles (ΔC/C0 < 1%). However, it
can also be noticed how the rectangular shape of the CV
curves
is progressively deformed. This latter
can
be
attributed to the appearance of reversible pseudocapacitive
effects, indicating that an increasing number of continuous
cycles boosts the electrosorption, redox and intercalation
processes
on
the
surface
of
the
porous
electrodes
[20][34][35].

the real one is almost linear (up to ~65 Hz), then a
semicircle appears in the high frequency region indicating
the
transition
between
resistance
and
capacitance
behaviours. It should also be noticed that, at this point, the
curve faces the real axis at a ~45º angle, which is a common
characteristic when a porous electrode is saturated with
electrolyte [30][36][37]. Moreover, the interception with the
real axis is associated with the Equivalent Series Resistance
(ESR), which is estimated to be ~250 Ω. Lastly, Figure 6b 
and Figure 6c show the behaviour of the analyzed ECs if we
simplify its model to a capacitance in parallel with a
resistance.

curves at the four different states. Inset shows a bent EC, while the diagram

Finally, the temperature effect on the performance of the
ECs is represented in Figure 7. As demonstrated by both CC
and CV experiments, the specific capacitance increases as
the temperature incresases, as it has been demonstrated for
several
electrode/electrolyte
systems,
such
as
rGO-
PVA/H3PO4 [37], CNT-PC/TEABF4 [38] and others [39].
This effect has been attributted to changes in the electrolyte,
since an increase of the temperature possibly leads to the
physisorbtion of the electrolyte ions [37][38].
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we report the fabrication of thin-film
flexible electrochemical capacitors trough the screen-printing
of a carbon-based conductive ink on a flexible substrate.
Using PVA/H3PO4 as electrolyte, the devices present good
performance
as
ECDL
capacitors,
which
has
been
demonstrated trough cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge
experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Although
the
specific
capacitances
obtained
for
this
electrode material does not achieve those obtained with other
carbon-based materials, further studies aim to treat the
conductive ink in order to optimize its properties and
increase
the
specific
areal
capacitance.
It
has
been
demonstrated that this method paves the way towards an
alternative method for the large-scale and cost-effective
fabrication of flexible electrochemical capacitors.

Abstract—The irruption of Internet of Things and 5G in our soci-
ety comes along with several technological challenges to overcome.
From an overall perspective, the low-cost and environmental
friendliness of these technologies need to be ensured for their
universal deployment in different areas, starting with the sensors
and ﬁnishing with the power sources. To address these challenges,
the production and maintenance of a great number of sensor
nodes incur costs, which include manufacturing and integration
in mass of elements and sub-blocks, changing or recharging of
batteries, as well as management of natural resources and waste.
In this article, we demonstrate how Radio Frequency Energy
Harvesting (RFEH) and printed ﬂexible technology (a growing
technology for sensors) can solve these concerns through cost-
effective mass-production and utilization of energy harvesting
for the development of energy-autonomous nodes, as part of a
wireless sensor network. We present as illustration a sprayed
ﬂexible relative humidity sensor powered with RFEH under the
store-and-use principle.
Keywords–Radio frequency energy harvesting; printed ﬂexible
sensors; IoT; sprayed ﬂexible technology; store-and-use principle.

INTRODUCTION
The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is merging every-
day objects, vehicles, buildings, etc., with electronics as part
of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), giving new perspectives
to a broad range of areas traditionally out of the innovation
scope. In the following years, while it deploys, a lot of
effort will focus on the expenses, security and energy sources
of the WSN-nodes, as they occur to be the most critical
issues. Under these circumstances, Energy Harvesting (EH)
methods and low-cost hardware techniques such as Radio
Frequency Energy Harvesting (RFEH) and printed technology,
respectively, appear to be innovations to overcome successfully
these matters and that aim at the same time at the series
production and distribution.
Depending on the application, the energetic demands of the
deployed nodes differ vastly. While the tendency in the low-
power cases is the use of non-rechargeable chemical (lithium)
batteries [1], in several situations is not an option due to:
•
Longevity of a minimum time frame of months or
years without compromising the quality of service.
•
Large-scale deployment of nodes, materialized in im-
practical maintenance.
•
Hard access to the devices (high structures, wild
animals, etc.).
•
Cost of the batteries during the whole product life.
Besides, the massive employment and disposal of batteries
cost a big price to the environment in the shape of resources
over-exploitation and wastes [2], [3].
On the other hand, EH takes advantage of the existing am-
bient energy such as thermal, solar, vibrational or electromag-
netic waves among others; providing energy-autonomous sys-
tems that do not need batteries for their operation. Speciﬁcally,
RFEH exploits the far ﬁeld region of ambient radiation whose
frequencies range between some kilohertzs and hundreds of
gigahertzs [4].
Likewise, the usage of printed sensors solves a number
of problems that often head towards an increase of the costs
in manufacturing, integration and assembly. In contrast to
traditional integrated sensors, printed ones can integrate at
the same instance a broad combination of variables like
environmental gas concentrations, temperature, human heart-
beat, relative humidity or biopotentials, among others. Large-
scale and multipurpose fabrication techniques allow as well
their manufacture in a cost-effective way. Additionally, their
ﬂexible capabilities open the doors to use-cases as wearables
whose manufacturing costs decrease, facilitating their broad
utilization.
Having these two technologies together brings low costs
in production (cheap printed materials and integration) and
maintenance (no batteries), along with respect for the envi-
ronment. Moreover, printed sensors present ultra-low power
requirements, ﬁtting perfectly with RFEH which stays in that
energetic range in most of the scenarios.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II explains the
general concepts of RFEH and ﬂexible electronics technology,
keeping a perspective under the common linker of IoT. Section
III introduces and analyzes their integration and describes the
proposed solutions in terms of hardware and working principle.
Finally, Section IV presents the conclusions.

BACKGROUND
A. RF Energy Harvesting
An IoT energy harvester is a system that captures energy
from ambient sources and converts it into electricity for further
use. Normally, the goal will be powering wireless autonomous
devices like nodes part of a WSN.
The selection of the source depends only on the ambient
conditions around and on the application requirements, i.e.,
amount of energy needed, update period, part of the day of

operation, among others. Figure 1 compares the most common
EH methods in terms of energy harvested.
RFEH grants clear advantages in contrast with the rest of
techniques or wired options [2], [5]:
•
Everywhere and every-time availability (unlike solar
or thermal).
•
Predictability and stability over time (unlike wind ﬂow
or vibrational).
•
Wireless nature (unlike the common USB-powered
option).
•
Low-cost implementation (an antenna and a simple
rectiﬁcation circuit sufﬁce).
•
Small form-factor (within the interest frequency
range).
However, as seen in the previous ﬁgure, the available power
presents the mayor challenge, since extremely high efﬁciencies
in the circuits are needed for its usage. Friis equation deter-
mines the inverse square relation with the distance to the signal
source and with the efﬁciency of the rectifying and converting
circuits [6]. Moreover, often the availability of the signal is
permanent but not constant, e.g., Wi-Fi router duty-cycle or
mobile phone random use [3], [7].
RFEH is usually categorized as “ultra-low power” (barely
tens of microwatts), although it can be also employed as a
wireless energy transfer technique. Using a dedicated signal
emitter unlocks a broader range of applications more power
consuming, reaching hundreds of microwatts. The advantage
against the well-known inductive coupling (including resonant
inductive) is the effective distance reached (it presents 20 dB
attenuation per decade versus 60 dB [5]), although it has much
lower source-to-load energy efﬁciency. That turns the maxi-
mum separation of a few centimeters into several kilometers.
The basic operation of a RFEH harvester (see Figure 2)
starts with an antenna (or antennas) capturing the signal carrier
of interest. A rectiﬁer follows, which converts the microwave
energy into dc, consisting of Schottky diodes or CMOS struc-
tures in diode conﬁguration in nearly all the literature. For
the best power transfer between these two stages, a matching
network tuned at the target frequency is needed.
In order to obtain an appropriate and constant voltage level,
a voltage regulation stage is essential, generally in form of a
boost converter or a charge pump. Once at the desired level,
the energy is stored in a capacitor, dimensioned according to
the application needs.

B. Flexible Electronics Technology
Together with the EH technology, ﬂexible electronics has
attracted signiﬁcant attention in the ﬁeld of WSNs. Recent ad-
vances show promising future prospects in diverse areas, such
as wearables, electronic skin (e-skin) and even implantable
devices [8], [9], which satisfy requirements that were not
affordable with the current rigid silicon-based solutions.
In addition to its inherent properties (ﬂexibility, lightness,
transparency, etc.), the interest in ﬂexible electronics relies on
the possibility to reduce the manufacturing cost of large-area
devices, since its associated fabrication processes are usually
compatible with roll-to-roll techniques [10].
Over the years, diverse methods and materials have been
presented for the manufacturing of ﬂexible electronics, such
as screen- and inkjet-printing of conductive pastes, or spray
deposition and laser processing of nanomaterials [11]–[13].
However, the development of fully ﬂexible IoT devices is still
in early stages, and precisely because of that, most proof-of-
concept designs are based on hybrid technologies in which
the ﬂexible part is limited to the sensors or antennas [14]–[16]
and, more recently, to the energy storage devices [17], [18]
(see Figure 3).
III.
ENERGY-AUTONOMOUS AND LOW-COST IOT NODES
Within the IoT and WSN world exist several scenarios
where the application requirements are not too demanding
towards the update period or transmission range. With the

inclusion of printed ultra-low power sensors and if the sur-
rounding environment enhances its usage, RFEH appears as
a singular method for powering the nodes, becoming an
excellent composite for both technologies.
The complete IoT node consists of: i) printed sensor, a
capacitive structure in this case for measuring the Relative
Humidity (RH) of the air; ii) a microcontroller (µC) plus
transceiver chip, the logic and communicator of the circuit
(also able to be manufactured in bendable technology); iii)
different antennas, for communication (868 MHz) and harvest-
ing from Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)
(949 MHz); iv) RFEH block, outputting directly regulated dc
voltage to a v) storage capacitor.
In this manner, we achieve energy-autonomous and low-
cost nodes, since we avoid the use of any sort of battery and the
production, integration and maintenance phases are remarkably
cheaper.
A. Working Principle
The working principle attends to the one described in
Figure 4, commonly known as duty-cycled operation. In this
manner, after a measurement and transmission cycle, the
system will be most of its time in sleep mode (ultra-low pow-
er consumption or even disconnected), while the harvesting
electronics charge the capacitors for a new measurement.
The wake-up process can be triggered in different ways:
•
With a ﬁxed period determined by the application,
although within a certain time range where the ca-
pacitors are assured to be charged (Radio Frequency
(RF) energy available is stable and predictable).
•
With an extra wake-up radio that triggers the active
mode [4].
•
Or every time a certain voltage level is reached while
charging.
In any case, the minimum period will depend only on the RF
spectrum, i.e., how much energy is available around the node,
and of course, on the application needs.
Once a measurement is carried out and sent, the gateway
-or objective node depending on the communication topology-
will forward the message to the cloud and answer the node
in case of need. These points are assumed to not work with
energy harvesting.
B. Harvested Energy
The power levels in city open-spaces nowadays go up to
−30 dBm and even −20 dBm at bands of high usage such
as GSM, tv broadcasting, license-free bands or wireless local
networks [19]–[21]. Furthermore, with active emitting, the
levels can reach in average more than −3 dBm [5].
The losses, from the source emission until the load, can be
split in two parts. The ﬁrst and largest are the propagation loss-
es along the path, deﬁned by the Friis transmission equation,
and increased by presumable obstacles and misalignment of
the antennas. The second part is related to the efﬁciency at the
rectiﬁer-converter-storage chain. Slight drops in this efﬁciency
will stop the system from working, since the voltage levels are
close to the thresholds of the actual silicon electronics.
The current state of the art in rectiﬁcation and storage
for the power levels mentioned satisﬁes the energy needs

for several IoT use-cases, although the conversion stage gets
harder to deal with due to the low levels of power and/or
voltage. Most of the off-the-shelf converters are considered
“low-power” (range of milliwatts) and are able to operate either
with extremely low levels of voltage or power, but not with
both together. This results in a harder employment of EH
techniques, as the converter stage must be custom designed
or, alternatively, this task is taken over by the rectiﬁer, being
then only valid under certain energy conditions.
Nevertheless, making use of the store-and-use principle as
an intermediate stage [22], more energetic bursts in periods can
be output to the converter. In this way, and with a favorable
environment as the mentioned before, the power harvested
from some microwatts to hundreds of them, can be stored in
the desired voltage level for its use by the application unit in
a duty-cycled fashion.
In this direction, we have developed a battery-less har-
vesting block capable of capturing RF energy while using
commercial low-power dc/dc converters (see Figure 5). Making
use of an innovative autonomous switched capacitor design,
we implemented the store-and-use principle, functioning not
only as an energy adaption phase, but also as an impedance
matching.
C. Flexible Relative Humidity Sensor
The developed IoT node integrates a ﬂexible sensor in-
tended for the monitoring of the ambient RH. The opera-
tion of this sensor, shown in Figure 6-a, is based on the
outstanding sensitivity to humidity changes of the dielectric
constant of Graphene Oxide (GO) [23], [24]. For that, a ﬂexible
PolyEthylene Terephthalate (PET) substrate was coated with a
thin-layer of GO, which was prepared at a concentration of
0.4 wt% following a modiﬁed version of the Hummers and
Offeman’s method, as described in [25]. The spray-coating of
the substrate (38.5 µL/cm2) was done using a manual airbrush
similar to the presented in [26], [27]. Finally, once the GO
layer was completely dried, a capacitive structure consisting of
16 InterDigitally arranged Electrodes (IDE) was screen-printed
on its surface using a silver-based conductive ink (LOCTITE®
ECI 1010 E&C from Henkel AG, D¨usseldorf, Germany), as

depicted in Figure 6-b. We opted for this conﬁguration for two
main reasons. Firstly, to have a more uniform layer on which
the GO can be deposited with a better control of the thickness
and, secondly, to minimize the impact of the substrate on the
performance of the sensors. Electrical connections were glued
to the electrodes using silver conductive paint (186-3600 RS
Pro, RS Components, Corby, UK), following the manufacturer
recommendations, which did not affect the thermal reduction
of the GO.
The calibration curves obtained for this humidity sensor
are shown in Figure 7. The experiments were performed using
the climate chamber VCL4006 (from V¨otsch Industrietechnik
GmbH, Balingen, Germany) at a constant temperature of 40 ◦C
to use the whole humidity range of the chamber. The results
show that the impedance decreases with both increasing hu-
midity and frequency values (see Figure 7-a). These impedance
values were used to extract the equivalent parallel capacitance
as a function of the RH at four different frequencies (100 Hz,
1 kHz, 10 kHz and 100 kHz) as shown in Figure 7-b. The
sensitivity offered by this sensor depends on the frequency
of the excitation signal, being 385.53 pF at 100 Hz, 70.07 pF
at 1 kHz, 15.44 pF at 10 kHz and 1.72 pF at 100 kHz.

CONCLUSION
In this article, we introduced a solution for the use of
RFEH in conjunction with ﬂexible printed sensors as a form
of decreasing the costs of WSNs deployment. Besides the
general cost reduction due to the omission of battery-recharge
or substitution and wiring; the employment of innovative low-
cost printed sensors provides an extra boost in manufacturing
and integration savings.
The presented sprayed GO-based sensor is an example
of how this technology can achieve satisfactory measurement
results in an extremely cost-effective manner and with ultra-
low power requirements. On the other end of the system,
the store-and-use principle applied to RFEH provides lower
levels from where the energy can be harvested, through energy
accumulation and impedance matching between the rectiﬁer
and converter stages.
The future work encompasses the optimization of the
energetic sub-blocks in order to reach lower levels, as well
as the improvement of the sensor accuracy.

INTRODUCTION
Today, alcohol vapor sensors have a great demand in
various fields. Ethanol sensors are used in food industry,
medicine and biotechnology. Ethanol sensors are also
extremely important during the production of ethanol and
alcoholic drinks to monitor the wine quality. They are used
in processes such as: food–packages, clinical analysis,
agronomic, vinicultural and veterinary analysis, also toxic
waste and contamination analysis, fuel processing, Trends in
Analytical Chemistry (TRAC) management and societal
applications, as well as chemical processing in industry [1]-
[5]. Several methods and strategies have been reported for
the detection of ethanol, e.g., gas chromatography, liquid
chromatography,
refractometry
and
spectrophotometry,
semiconductor gas sensors and so on [2][6][7].
The solid-state gas sensors based on Metal Oxide
Semiconductors (MOSs) with different nanostructures have
played
an important role in environment
monitoring,
domestic and car safety, control in chemical processing due
to their distinct advantages, such as simple implementation,
low cost, high sensitivity, stability and reproducibility, low
detection limit, easy production, nontoxicity, easy-achieved
real-time response and compatibility with micro-fabrication
processes [8]-[10]. Various MOSs materials, such as SnO2,
In2O3, WO3, ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3, CuO, Ga2O3, CTO (CrTiO)
with different nanostructures and dopant have been studied
and showed promising results for detecting Volatile Organic
Compounds (VOCs) [11]. Among these materials, the SnO2
has good electrical and chemical properties. It is an n-type
semiconductor with tetragonal rutile structure and it has a
large energy band gap of 3.6 eV at 300 K. It has been
widely exploited as an ultrasensitive gas sensor for the
detection of carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia, ozone,
carbon dioxide, hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide, nitrogen
dioxide, ethanol and so on [12]-[14]. The wide range of
possible applications has attracted many researchers to work
on this material with different nanostructures, such as
nanograins, nanorods, nanowires and nanofibers synthesized
by various methods. It has a high sensitivity to reducing and
oxidizing gases, fast response and recovery behavior and
low sensitivity to humidity [15]-[17].

Although many conductometric gas sensors made of
MOSs have been commercialized for the last decades, a lot
of problems still need to be solved in order to improve the
performance of gas sensing devices. The main issues are
related to sensitivity, selectivity and stability but the
lowering of sensor’s operating temperature is still one of the
main concerns. Resistive metal oxide based gas sensors
normally operate at an elevated temperature (in a range of
200 ºC
to
400 ºC).
This
results
in
higher
power
consumption, limits the use of the sensor in explosive
environments, and causes difficulties for the sensor to be
attached to electrical systems [18][19].
There
are
many
studies
aimed
at
applying
new
technologies
and
reducing
operating
temperatures.
To
ensure a low operating temperature, several techniques have
been used, such as doping the metal oxides with additives,
using catalytic particles, applying a high electric field across
the sensor terminals and illuminating the sensors with UV
radiation [20][21]. The irradiation of UV-assisted MOS
sensors is an important alternative to activate chemical
reactions on metal oxide surface and reduce the resistance of
the thin sensing layer instead of the more common use of
energy-demanding heating. Almost completely replacing the
effect of thermal energy, UV irradiation greatly influences
the adsorption and desorption processes of the gas on the
semiconductor surface enhancing their reactivity with the
analyte gas. Under the influence of UV illumination, as a
result of the formation of electron–hole pairs, more neutral
atoms and molecules of absorbed oxygen on the surface of
the semiconductor become ions, which then interact with
analyte gas. UV irradiation can also be used to clean the
active surface of a gas sensing layer, but the more important
function is to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the
gas sensor by reducing the operating temperature. If it is not
possible to lower the operating temperature to room
temperature
by
using
UV
irradiation,
UV
irradiation
combined with heating can be used to stimulate the gas
sensor [22]-[24].
In this paper, we focus on low temperature sensing of
SnO2 based thin film sensors under UV illumination. In
Section 2, the fabrication steps of SnO2<Co> sensor are
presented. In Section 3, the studies of sensing properties of
UV assisted ethanol sensor are presented. The conclusions
are outlined in Section 4. The sensor exhibited good
sensitivity
to
low
concentration
of
ethanol
vapors.
Fabricated sensors have also sufficient selectivity and
stability over time.
II.
SENSOR FABRICATION
Sensitive layers based on SnO2<Co> were deposited by
RF magnetron sputtering technique. Firstly, appropriate
quantities
of the
corresponding
metal
oxide
powders
(SnO2+2 at.%Co2O3) were weighed and mixed thoroughly
for 10 hours. Then, the mixture was subjected to pre-heat
treatment at 800 0C for 5 hours (the initial annealing
temperature was chosen based on the composition of the
compound). The preheating of mixed powder eliminates the
moisture of the metal oxide raw materials, which facilitates
homogeneous mixing and milling of the powders (when the
ceramic tablet is made of dry powders, it reduces the
probability of formation of mechanical cracks during final
annealing). Then, the mixed powder was milled for 20 hours
until becoming fully homogeneous and pressed (with
2000 N/cm2 pressure) in a form of a tablet (with 50 mm
diameter). The sputtering ceramic target based on SnO2
doped with 2 at.% Co (using the pressed tablet) was
synthesized by solid-phase reaction method using thermal
treatment in the atmosphere by the programmable furnace
Nabertherm, HT O4/16 (with the controller of C 42). The
final annealing was carried out at temperature range of
500 °C-1100 °C
for
20
hours.
The
synthesized
semiconductor solid solution was subjected to mechanical
treatment in order to eliminate surface defects. So, a smooth
and parallel target with a diameter of 40 mm and thickness
of 2 mm was prepared as a magnetron sputtering target (see
Figure 1).
The thin sensing layers were deposited on Multi-Sensor-
Platforms by RF
magnetron sputtering
method
using
synthesized SnO2<Co> target. The Multi-Sensor-Platforms
were purchased by TESLA BLANTA (Czech Republic).
The platform has a temperature sensor (Pt 1000) for
controlling operating temperature. There are platinum heater
and interdigitated electrodes on the ceramic substrate of the
Multi-Sensor-Platform
(see Figure 2).
The
heater
and
temperature sensor were covered with an insulating glass
layer. Gas sensitive SnO2<Co> layer was deposited onto the
non-passivated electrode structure, so the Multi-Sensor-
Platform was converted into gas sensor. Then, palladium
catalytic particles are deposited on the surface of the
magnetron sputtered sensing layer by ion-beam sputtering
method for sensitization of active layer. The working
conditions of the high-frequency magnetron sputtering and
ion-beam sputtering are presented in Table I (the base
pressure was 2×104 Pa for both cases). The manufactured
sensors were annealed in the air at 350 °C for 4 hours for
homogenization of sensing films and stabilization their
parameters. The fabrication steps of photo-assisted gas
sensor are presented in Figure 1.
The thickness of the SnO2<Co> thin film was measured
by the Alpha-Step D-300 (KLA Tencor) profiler. The result
of the study of the film-substrate transition profile is shown
in Figure 3. The thickness of the SnO2<Co> film was equal
to 180 nm.
The
electrical
and
gas
sensing
properties
of
the
SnO2<Co> thin layer was measured using a home-made
computer-controlled gas testing system. The testing system
has
a
test
chamber,
pressure
sensor
(Motorola-
MPX5010DP) and a data acquisition system (PCLD-8115)
[25]. For measurement of alcohol vapor concentration, the
SnO2<Co> based sensor (the Multi-Sensor-Platform) was
attached in the test chamber connecting the six pins (two
pins of temperature sensor, two pins of heater and two pines
of resistance measurement electrodes, see Figure 2) with the
corresponding inputs on sensor holder. The UV LED
(λ=365 nm) was attached 0.5 cm away from the active layer 
with illumination of 2 mW/cm2. The gas sensing properties
of
the
SnO2<Co>
sensor
were
measured
at
room
temperature in the dark and under UV illumination. The

GAS SENSING PERFORMANCES
Initially, we tested the influence of the UV illumination
on the baseline resistance of the SnO2<Co> sensor at room
temperature. It can be seen from Figure 4 that the value of
R0/RUV (~350) ratio is larger than 1, indicating the decrease
of the sensor baseline resistance under UV illumination. The
response time of the Co-doped SnO2 thin film under UV
irradiation is a few minutes.

The manufactured sensor is resistive and its operation is
grounded
on
changes
of
resistance
of
gas
sensitive
semiconductor layer under the influence of ethanol vapors
caused by an exchange of charges between molecules of the
semiconductor
film
and
absorbed
ethanol.
The
high
operating temperature of these types of sensors is mainly
due to the high activation energies of chemical reactions.
For this reason, these types of sensors mainly do not
sensitivity at room temperature. The UV light promotes the
gas adsorption and desorption on the surface of the
semiconductor participating to the sensing mechanisms [23].
Figure 5.
Resistance variation of the SnO2<Co> sensor under the
influence of UV irradiation at room temperature in the presence
of 150 ppm ethanol vapors.
The thin film SnO2<Co> based sensor did not show
sensitivity to ethanol vapors at room temperature without
UV irradiation. We measured the resistance variation (also
the signal repeatability) of the SnO2<Co> sensor in the
presence of ethanol vapors under the influence of UV
irradiation at room temperature. The resistance of the thin
film changes by almost 400 Ω in the presence of 150 ppm 
ethanol vapors (see Figure 5).
Sensor response and recovery times are in minutes and it
is clear that recovery times are faster because UV light more
stimulate the desorption processes from the surface of the
sensing layer.
Figure 6.
The SnO2<Co> sensor response to 900 ppm of ethanol vapors
under the influence of UV irradiation at room temperature.
Figure 6 shows the transient response of the SnO2<Co>
sensor in the presence of ethanol under UV light at room
temperature. The response to 900 ppm ethanol vapors under
UV illumination is sufficiently high (24 %).
We extracted the response vs. concentration curve for
the Co-doped SnO2 sensitive film. Figure 7 shows the
dependence of response on the ethanol vapor concentration
under the influence of UV irradiation at room temperature.
The dependence has almost linear characteristic, which will
allow not only to detect of ethanol vapors but also to
accurately measure the low concentrations of this gas.

under the influence of UV irradiation at room temperature.
The resistance change of the Co-doped SnO2 sensor
under the influence of ethanol vapors at high operating
temperature in dark conditions was also measured. The
sensitive layer resistance decreases more than 25 times in
the presence of 150 ppm ethanol vapors at 200 0C operating
temperature (see Figure 8). The response and recovery times

of the sensor at high operating temperature are a few
seconds. At high operating temperature in dark condition,
the sensor performance is quite promising but the power
consumption of fabricated sensor at 200 0C is about 2.5 W.
It is more than two orders high then the power consumption
(24 mW) needed the sensor operating with UV irradiation at
room temperature.

CONCLUSION
In summary, a simple technology has been used to
manufacture semiconductor thin film sensor based on SnO2
doped
with
2 at.% Co.
The
fabricated
SnO2<Co>
chemiresistive gas sensor showed a good sensitivity to
different concentrations of ethanol vapor (from 150 to
900 ppm) at room temperature with the activation of low-
powered UV LED (24 mW, 365 nm). The sensor displayed
a good signal repeatability and long-term stability. These
sensing characteristics made the present SnO2<Co> based
sensor a promising candidate for practically detecting
ethanol vapors at room temperature.

Abstract— In our previous work, we developed a solid-state pH
sensor for real time pH measurement. In this work, we discuss
the use of this sensor for extension applications in the health
monitoring field. The pH sensor system needs to be super
compact in size and have a bio-friendly interface in order to
provide a good user experience. In this paper, we introduce a
smaller transistor and a new sensing material for realizing an
optimized sensor structure and measurement system. The
measured results show that the antimony-based pH sensor has
a reasonable responsivity for pH real-time monitoring.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
technology has undergone many advances, such as super
compact size, high sensitivity and high uniformity of
working functions. Based on the MEMS technique, we
developed a solid-state pH sensor that has already been used
in some application fields, not only in chemical engineering,
but also in industry and agricultural science [1] [2].
In this study, we would like extend the given sensor for
applications in the health monitoring field. Figure 1 shows
the schematic view of our proposed pH sensor measurement
system. The typical electrodes were fabricated using the
MEMS technique for realizing high dimensional and high
performance homogeneity. The sensor system combines the
measurement and transmission boards (see insert images).
The electrodes connect the gate terminal of a Metal-Oxide-
Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET). The
specific FET is loaded on the measurement board and used
to measure the pH value of target solutions. The transmission
board has a wireless or a Bluetooth module to transmit the
tested date to the user terminal devices (smart phone or PC),
respectively. Figure 1 also shows the potential application
fields of the given pH sensor: (1) the compact sensing
system unit could be set in a nappy or a diaper, for real-time
monitoring the health condition of children or old people; (2)
the compact sensor could be packaged with a bio-friendly
surface; (3) the ultra-small low-power wireless sensor node
may also be implanted into animal body to measure the urine
condition of pets.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2,
we are going to describe the fabrication method of sensor
electrodes and system. In Section 3, some preliminary
measurement results will be presented. In Section 4, we will
present a discussion and conclusion on this work.

potential applications.

SENSOR FABRICATION AND SPECIFICATION
In our previous works, we already comprehensively
presented the fabrication processes of Indium Tin Oxide
(ITO) -based pH sensor electrode [1]. Silicon wafers with
200-μm-thick SiO2 for passivation layers were used to
fabricate the MEMS devices in this work. After under-metal
and sensing layers generation, photolithography and metal
etching methods were used to generate the sensing electrode
and the bottom electrode layers with high precision. Then, to
pattern the sensing area and protect it with a long life time, a
fluoropolymer thin film coating was fabricated on the sensor
electrode. Finally, O2 plasma was used to remove the
photoresist and other residuals. On the other hand, in this
work, the comparison sensor with the following specification
of thick film antimony for the working electrode was used:
the sensing area has a 4-mm diameter circular window.

PRELIMINARY MEASUREMENT RESULTS
A.
Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor
measurement
To provide a good user experience, the pH sensor system
components should also be improved, because a small sensor
node can minimize the discomfort of the users. The
components on boards should be optimized with the size as
small as possible. After the measurement board can be
shrunk to a very compact size, the sensor system will also
have a tiny size. In the new sensor system, an n-channel
MOS transistor (with very low price, lower than 20 Japanese
yen) was used on the sensing board for testing the pH value
of solutions.
The performance of the small MOS transistor was
measured. The output current of the transistor has a range
from 0.875 V to 0.890 V, correspondingly to the measured
pH value from 7 to 4. The responsivity of the new sensor has
a reasonable value of 5 mV/pH.
B.
Performance comparison of different sensing electrodes
and different transmission systems
We did a performance comparison of different sensing
electrodes. Figure 2 shows the digital output of the pH sensor
with different sensing materials versus the measured pH
values. As the results show, the ITO- and antimony-based
pH sensors have similar output/pH values (the relative error
between the two sensors does not exceed 5% in average).
Both sensors can keep a linear output proportional to the
changes in the pH value. The very small different slope
between the fitting curves showed that the antimony-based
pH sensor has a relatively higher sensitivity (see Figure 2
fitting curves). However, the antimony-based pH sensor also
suffers from a larger deviation error comparison with ITO-
based pH sensor. On the other hand, some researchers prefer
the antimony-based pH sensors to apply on bio-sensing
technology, for a better biocompatibility [3]. We can
understand the merits and demerits of sensing materials,
reasonably. After correct calibration, the sensor node can be
used in field measurements to prove its stability and
reliability. We also tested the power consumption of wireless
and Bluetooth transmission systems; we found that they have
similar power consumption at the mW level, but Bluetooth
has an inner antenna, which causes the Bluetooth-based pH
sensor system to be very compact in size, with larger
application potentials.
IV.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
We developed a solid-state pH sensor for real time pH
monitoring. In this work, we extend its applications into the
health monitoring field. In order to realize the solid-state pH
sensor with super compact size and bio-friendly interface to
provide a good user experience, a small transistor and a new
sensing material are introduced for fabricating the sensor
structure and measurement system, respectively. As the
results show, the antimony-based pH sensor has a reasonable
responsivity for pH real-time monitoring. Super compact
solid pH sensors can provide mass data of target solutions
and water to help companies realize an Internet of Things
management system.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Optimizing the performance of an engine has been the
goal of numerous research efforts [1][2], since proper
prediction of its main operation parameters (such as torque
fluctuation during various loading, etc.) can significantly
contribute to efficient fault diagnosis, fuel economy, gas
emissions reduction and optimum engine performance in
general. The value of the instantaneous rotational speed of
the crankshaft is an important parameter employed widely in
engine operation analysis and fault diagnosis [3]-[6], since it
is relatively easily accessible employing low cost equipment.
In general, there are two established methods for measuring
the specific parameter: the timer/counter-based technique
and the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) based technique
[7][8].
The vast majority of modern engine speed monitoring
systems are based on the “magnetic pick-up” principle of
operation, which is a timer/counter based method. In order to
detect the engine’s speed, a given number of dents of
appropriate size and geometry are patterned on the surface of
the metallic flywheel of the engine, which is attached to the
rotating shaft; an inductive sensor is then employed to detect
the presence of each dent as the engine is operating (Fig. 1).
The rotational speed is deduced from the sensor’s output
pulse-train signal.
We should note that the maximum resolution of the above
described system (i.e., maximum
number
of
velocity

measurements during a single rotation of the crankshaft) is
mainly affected by the minimum resolution of the sensor,
that is, the minimum size required for each dent in order to
be magnetically detected.
In a typical low power industrial engine [9], the above
setup provides a maximum resolution of 120 measurements
per cycle (i.e., the speed is measured every 3o of crankshaft
rotation). In order to increase that figure, one should
increment the number of dents available on the flywheel,
resulting in an increase of its overall dimensions; thus, the
maximum resolution of such a system is limited by the
available space provided for the flywheel –a constrain that
cannot be altered easily, especially in the typical case of
low/medium power engine.
Although the measuring principle described above is
widely
adapted
regarding
engine
rotational
speed
monitoring, other alternative methods have been reported in
literature. In more detail, angular speed recording with high
accuracy by employing an appropriate optical measurement
system has been successfully performed in a low power four
stroke, four cylinder industrial engine [10], while the
development and installation of a speed monitoring system
which is based on a rotary encoder (on a four stroke, six
cylinder industrial engine) has also been described [11].
Both of the previously mentioned methods lead to
substantial increase of the maximum resolution of speed

(i.e.
angular
speed
measurements
with
a
resolution of less than 0.5° are reported) compared to the
established “magnetic pick-up” principle of operation. We
should
note
though
that
an
important
constraint
for
employing widely such monitoring systems and rendering
them practically useful to typical industrial engines - already
operating on-site, focuses on the need of altering the initial
engine setup, in order for the measuring system to be
installed. With our proposed method, this constraint is
practically removed.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section II,
we present the proposed measurement system, while in
Section III, the obtained preliminary results after applying
the system to a typical industrial engine are discussed.
Finally, we conclude the work in Section IV.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED METHOD
The
proposed
measurement
system
overcomes
the
restriction imposed by the size of the flywheel and the
necessity of altering the initial engine setup in general. This
is achieved by employing an incremental rotary encoder in
order to measure the instantaneous rotational speed which is
mounted directly on the engine’s crankshaft through a
custom-designed coupling, manufactured by a 3D printer.
Figure 2.

the incremental encoder is mounted directly on the flywheel (region A)
through an appropriate/custom-designed coupling.
In more detail, a low-cost commercially available sensor
(IFM electronic, type RVP510) has been employed. The
sensor was mounted on the engine’s crankshaft (Fig. 2)
through an appropriate coupling (Fig. 3) which is designed
and then manufactured by a 3D printer, according to the
specific engine’s crankshaft design. Thus, in the proposed
setup, the maximum resolution of the measurement system
is not limited by the available space provided for the
flywheel as in the case of a typical engine speed measuring

encoder’s shaft is visible at the center of the coupling.
system (i.e. the number of dents available to be magnetically
detected) but only by the resolution of the employed
encoder which is directly coupled to the crankshaft. Typical
incremental rotary encoders can easily perform more than
2,000 measurements per revolution [12] while the specific
industrial type encoder that was employed has a maximum
resolution of 10,000 measurements per cycle.
Furthermore, the appropriate coupling –manufactured by
3D printer, can be custom-designed in order to fit to the
crankshaft of basically any low/medium power already
installed and working IC engine that needs to be monitored
in a short time, eliminating the need for performing any
alteration on the initial engine setup; the only addition
necessary is the creation of a mechanical support for the
encoder.
III.
RESULTS
Angular speed monitoring of 9,000 measurements per
crankshaft rotation was successfully obtained employing the
developed system on a typical low power four cylinder
Diesel Engine, installed
in the Department of Naval
Architecture at the University of West Attica (Fig. 4). Note
that all four cylinders firings are clearly noticeable at speed
recording with an angular resolution of 0.04°.
We should point out that the speed profile presented in
Fig. 4 is deduced directly from raw experimental data with
no filtering applied for noise reduction purposes, making the
specific method extremely immune to noise compared to
similar results in literature [11], which are presented in Fig.
5. The above characteristic makes the system particularly
suitable
for
fault
diagnosis
and
engine
performance
optimization applications.

under the same operating conditions. The corresponding re-

CONCLUSIONS
A novel low-cost measurement system for monitoring
with high accuracy, the instantaneous rotational speed of an
internal combustion engine has been developed. The system
has been employed successfully for measuring the rotational
speed of a typical industrial four cylinder engine with a
resolution of 0.04 degree of crank angle, revealing its
suitability for fault diagnosis and engine performance
optimization applications.
The
key
features
of
the
proposed
measurement
configuration are very high monitoring accuracy, low-cost
and ability to be installed on-site, to an already operating
engine with no major modifications, suggesting numerous
potential applications.
Ongoing studies are focusing on fabricating a metallic
coupling for long-term monitoring and also on determining
how effectively the developed sensing arrangement can be
employed in optimizing an engine’s performance and in real-
time fault diagnosis monitoring under different engine load
conditions.

Abstract—In this work, we report on a new evaluation of metal
oxide based on carbon dioxide sensors, using barium titanate
nano-powder. The sensing principle is based on a change in
conductance of semiconducting oxides when carbon dioxide is
present. The sensitive layer was deposited on a SiO2/Si
substrate by screen printing technology. The sensor responses
were studied between 100 and 5000 ppm of carbon dioxide in
the air with 50% relative humidity. The sensor presents good
sensitivity toward carbon dioxide, with a stable baseline, and
fast response and recovery time. These results are promising
for carbon dioxide sensing.

INTRODUCTION
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the main gases
responsible for the greenhouse effect and, consequently, the
global warming trends. Hence, its monitoring is subject of a
major societal challenge. With an outdoors concentration up
to 500 ppm in urban areas, the ventilation balance is
affected and the development of reliable low-cost CO2
sensors at multiple sites becomes an industrial strategy.
Nowadays, the most commonly used method to detect CO2
is based on optical sensors. Despite their efficiency in CO2
detection, these technologies are expensive, have high
electric consumption and are not fully miniaturized. Metal
oxide gas sensors show potential features such as low-cost,
mass
production,
miniaturization,
fast
response
and
recovery times.
In 1991, Ishihara et al. [1] first proposed a composite
material based on p and n-type semiconductors, by mixing
copper oxide (CuO) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) powders.
In 2001, Liao et al. [2] showed that pure CuO and pure
BaTiO3 gave no response to CO2. Since then, these pure
materials have been definitively abandoned and only
composites have been studied. But, the sensors of Liao et al.
[2] were in the very basic form of large discs of sintered
powders with unknown granularity, connected by Ag paste
electrodes. Thus, we propose herein a new evaluation of
BaTiO3 based CO2 sensors.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, we describe our approach based on BaTiO3 nano-powder
deposition on platinum interdigitated electrodes by screen
printing, a low cost, and an easily used technique. Then, in
Section III, the sensing results are discussed based on a
change in conductance of BaTiO3 when CO2 are introduced.
Finally, a conclusion is given in Section IV.
II.
DESCRIPTION OF APPROACH AND TECHNIQUES
This description is composed of two parts; one is the
sensing film fabrication; the other is the measurement
system set-up.
A.
Gas sensors
Our gas sensor is made of Ti/Pt interdigitated electrodes
(5 and 100 nm, respectively) deposited on Si/SiO2 by
magnetron sputtering. BaTiO3 thick films were deposited by
screen printing on these electrodes to produce a CO2
sensitive layer. BaTiO3 nano-powder (<100 nm, 4 g) was
mixed with glycerol (1.5 g) and screen printed on Si/SiO2
substrate with interdigitated platinum electrodes spaced by
50 μm (Figure 1). 
Figure 1. Sample image of SiO2/Si substrate (4 x 4 mm2) with platinum
electrodes (bottom) and the final sensor with the BaTiO3 thick film (top).
The deposited film was annealed at 400°C on a hotplate,
in ambient air. The film structure was determined by X-Ray
Diffraction (XRD) with a Philip’s X’Pert MPD equipment
( = 1.54 Å).
B.
Setup
0.1 V DC voltage was applied to the sample while the
electrical
resistance
was
monitored
by
a
homemade
LabVIEW program using a Keithley Model 2450 Source
Measure Unit (SMU) Instrument (Keithley, U.S.A.). Dry air
(no humidity) was used as both the reference and the carrier
gas. A gas dilution and humidification system generates an
output mixture at the target CO2 concentrations (1 to 5000
ppm) with a variable humidity (0% to 90%). The sensing
properties of BaTiO3 sensors were tested by measuring the
sensor resistance for 5 min under CO2 diluted in dry air and
in humid air with a standard Relative Humidity (RH) value
of 50 %. The sensors were operated at several temperatures
from 200°C to 300°C on a hotplate. A constant total flow
was maintained at 500 Standard Cubic Centimeters per
Minute (SCCM) via mass flow controllers.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The XRD diffractogram of BaTiO3 thick film (Figure 2)
shows the presence of BaTiO3 nanocrystals in the tetragonal
phase of BaTiO3 [3].
Figure 2. BaTiO3 diffractogram using  = 1.54Å (Philip’s X’Pert MRD).
The BaTiO3 sensors for different CO2 concentrations
provide a measurable response depending on the CO2
concentrations in the 100 - 5 000 ppm range and 50% RH at
various
temperatures.
The
higher
response
amplitude
variations were obtained at 280°C. Figures 3 and 4 show,
respectively, the response and the sensitivity of the BaTiO3
sensor under CO2 in the air with 50% RH at 280 °C, the
optimum working temperature. It gives reversible responses
to CO2 concentrations between 100 ppm and 5000 ppm.
Figure 3. Resistive responses of BaTiO3 to six CO2concentrations
with 50% RH at 280°C.
The sensor response is defined in (1) as the ratio between
the sensor resistance under CO2 exposure and the sensor
resistance in the air:
R = Rgas / Rair
(1)
where Rair is the sensor resistance through humid airflow and
Rgas the sensor resistance in the presence of CO2.
The response time was less than 2 minutes and the
recovery time was about 5 minutes. The responses are
proportional to the CO2 concentrations, and they restored
the original baseline in less than 5 minutes.
Figure 4. Sensitivity response of BaTiO3 to different concentrations of CO2
with 50% RH at 280°C.
These results are in agreement with the recent review on
chemiresistive CO2 gas sensors [4].
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
This work reported preliminary results on a screen
printing BaTiO3 sensor working at an optimum temperature
of 280°C and for 50% RH. Our experiments showed stable
baseline
responses
with
fast
response/recovery
times
towards CO2. These sensors seem promising for measuring
indoor and outdoor air quality and for CO2 detection.
However, after a few weeks, using the same operational
conditions, the sensor responses were weakened on the
record. New experiments and analyses are in progress to
understand this phenomenon.

Abstract—This paper deals with a preliminary evaluation of a
new data-driven approach aiming to discriminate several gases
in a gas mixture, with a single Metal Oxide (MOX) sensor,
under real conditions of use, i.e. in the permanent presence of a
gas concentration. This method relies on a database obtained
using temperature modulation of the sensor, for fixed gas
concentrations. The database is increased by extracting the
temporal attributes of the signal, and then reduced using
principal
component
analysis
to
extract
only
useful
information. Gas discrimination is achieved by the online
projection of measurements in the principal space consisting of
the two main components. Experimental results obtained on a
test bench show the effectiveness of the proposed approach:
carbon monoxide, ozone and nitrogen dioxide are clearly
discriminated using one single MOX gas micro sensor.

INTRODUCTION
The quality of outdoor and indoor air has become a very
important health, societal and political issue. The health issue
is recognized by institutions (World Health Organization in
the leading position) and, for populations, air quality has
become a major concern. The most harmful pollutant gases
to health include carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). The
variety
of
pollutants
being
large
and
the
harmful
concentrations for health being very low, it has become
imperative to design detection systems that are both highly
sensitive and highly selective. Today, only measurements by
on-site sampling and laboratory analysis can meet these
requirements, but remain expensive and incompatible with
real-time monitoring. The development of highly sensitive,
reliable, portable and low-cost detection systems is still
limited because they are not sufficiently selective. Metal
oxide (MOX) gas sensors are readily available and widely
used in portable and low-cost gas monitoring devices
because of their high sensitivity, stability and attractive
lifetime. However, this type of gas sensor suffers from an
inherent
lack
of
selectivity,
since
the
gas
detection
mechanism is rather nonspecific and more or less any type of
reducing or oxidizing gas is detected. To overcome this low
selectivity, MOX type gas sensors are most often assembled
to form an electronic nose. The electronic nose is a complex
system consisting of a set of multiple sensors, an information
processing unit, software with digital pattern recognition
algorithms, and databases with reference libraries [1][2]. The
challenges of miniaturization and reduction of energy
consumption involve minimizing the number of sensors. For
this purpose, it is necessary to increase the amount of
information
provided
by
one
sensor
using
advanced
measurements,
such
as
temperature
modulation
or
fluctuation enhanced sensing [3]-[5].
The
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
provide
gases
identification methods that can discriminate several gases
with a single MOX sensor, under real conditions of use, i.e.
in the permanent presence of a gas concentration. As a first
step of the study, we report here on the evaluation of a new
method based on temperature modulation of the sensor and
data treatment using temporal attributes of the sensor
response. The used methodology and the experimental set-up
are described in Sections II and III, respectively. In Section
IV, we present the results for three air quality gases (O3, NO2
and CO). Then, the capability of discriminating gases was
evaluated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We
conclude the work in Section V.
II.
METHODOLOGY
The methodology is summarized in Figure 1. First, a
database is created by measuring the sensor’s resistance
when modulating its operating temperature for fixed gas
concentrations. Then, the database is increased by extracting
the temporal attributes of the obtained signal, and then
reduced using principal component analysis to extract only
useful information. Gas discrimination is achieved by the
online projection of measurements in the principal space
consisting of the two main components. PCA is a robust and
unsupervised model recognition approach commonly used
for multivariate data analysis. It is a statistical procedure that
converts a set of observations of possibly correlated variables
into a new set of values called principal components. PCA
has proven its effectiveness in many areas of application [6]-
[8], including electronic noses [2].

EXPERIMENTS
In order to obtain a large amount of data, we have chosen
to operate our microsensor in variable temperature mode: the
heating voltage of the sensitive layer is varied triangularly
between two extreme values with a very small voltage step.
The maximum value of the triangular signal will correspond
to the optimal detection temperature for the targeted gases.
The sensor must have a transducer with a fast and efficient
heating system. The sensor used in this study comes from a
new technology developed by the IM2NP laboratory and the
NANOZ-SAS company [9]. The sensor device has two
distinct heaters and four detection zones offering several
operating modes in single or multi-sensors. Figure 2 shows a
picture of the sensor indicating the contact pads for the four
sensors, the two heaters and the ground.

membrane; 3- WO3 sensing layer covering the two heaters and the four
detection zones. The transducer design showing the four sensitive zones
and the two heaters is hidden for copyright reasons.
One of the innovations of our sensor is that the heating
element is located on the same plane as the sensing element,
on a SiO2 membrane. The heaters and sensing electrodes
were first realized in a sputtered platinum thin film using
classical photolithography. Then, the WO3 thin sensing layer
was
deposited
by
reactive
magnetron
radio-frequency
sputtering and annealed at a temperature well above the
operating temperature during two hours to improve its nano-
crystallization and stability. As part of this study, we chose
to operate in single sensor mode according to the diagram in
Figure 3. We note RS1, RS2, RS3 and RS4 the sensor
resistances of the four detection zones, and RH1 and RH2 the
resistances of the two heaters.

heaters are powered by a staircase waveform of amplitude
0.4V centered on 1.6V, as illustrated in Figure 4. The voltage
value 1.8V allows to heat the sensitive layer at a temperature
of 252 °C. This temperature corresponds to an optimal
detection
of
the
tested
gases.
The
voltage
of
1.4V
corresponds to a temperature of 199 °C, which is the limit of
detection.
The
staircase
waveform
is
generated
by
programming the PXIe 4113 voltage source. The variation
between each step is 10mV and the duration of each step is
1s. The configuration and control of the PXIe devices are
performed with our developed LabVIEW application.

The sensor device is placed in a 3D-printed prototype test
chamber developed in the IM2NP laboratory. This chamber
enhances the gas flow hydrodynamics, in particular the gas
concentration
homogeneity
and
the
reduction
of flow
recirculation and dead volumes [10]. To generate gas
concentrations and measure sensor responses, we developed
an experimental test bench shown in Figure 5. The dilution
system provides a concentration range of 200 ppb to 16 ppm
in order to test the limit thresholds of the tested pollutants.
Mixed gases are admitted and evacuated from the test
chamber via distribution valves.

RESULTS
This work is focused on the monitoring of air quality
using metal oxide sensors. The microsensor has been
exposed to three gases related to the air quality: ozone (O3),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). For each
gas, we have chosen three concentrations close to the
sanitary thresholds (see Table I). The WO3 sensitive thin film
deposited on our specific transducer enables to detect all
these concentrations.

For each gas concentration, we proceeded with the
following protocol:

constant exposure of the sensor to a given gas
concentration;

biasing sensors at VS=VS1=VS2=VS3=VS4 = 0.9V.

heating of the sensitive layer at the optimum
detection temperature (VH = VH1 = VH2 = 1.8V)
during 5 minutes;

heating
of
the
sensitive
layer
using
staircase
waveform during four periods of the signal described
in Figure 4;

return to the optimal detection temperature.
In Figure 6, we present an example of the response of the
sensor (bottom curve) to the staircase waveform in thermal
modulation (top curve) for an ozone concentration. We have
obtained similar responses for all gases, but all responses
have
different
signal
parameters.
The
proposed
gas
discrimination method is based on the characterization of the
temporal attributes of the signal, including certain statistical
parameters. Indeed, these mathematical moments enable to
characterize a distribution and are interesting to take into
account when studying transient phenomena. In our case,
they
can
characterize
mechanisms
related
to
gases
adsorption-desorption processes on the surface of the
sensitive layer.
Figure 6.
Example of sensor response (bottom curve) to triangular
temperature variation (top curve) for 160 ppb of O3.
To obtain a sufficient number of variables and to
constitute a statistics database, we calculated the following
temporal attributes for each gas response:

peak to peak value.

mean value.

the root mean square value.

the third standardized moment called skewness.

the fourth standardized moment called kurtosis.

the crest factor.

the shape factor.

the variance.
From the sets of calculated parameters of each gas
concentration,
we
have
evaluated
the
possibility
of
identifying
the
three
studied
gases
using
Principal
Component Analysis. In PCA, the score diagrams show the
relationships between the analyzed
variables (different
concentrations of the three gases in our studies). PCA has
been performed using the Pearson matrix calculation. The
PCA variables are the parameters of the temporal attributes.
All PCA variables have a significant length in the PC1 / PC2
plane. The scores graph of the first two principal components
(PC1 and PC2) is given in Figure 7. We clearly observe three
groups of data. Each group corresponds to a gas. A first
separation can be made according to the component PC1.

The corresponding CO data have a strongly positive PC1,
while the NO2 and O3 have negative PC1 values.
Figure 7.
PCA scores plot.
The component PC2 makes it possible to separate these
two gases. Indeed, the values of O3 have a negative value of
PC2. Conversely, the values for NO2 have a positive value
on PC2. The results of the PCA show that a clear distinction
is possible between the three studied gases. Our results are
consistent with other studies which have shown that the
staircase waveform to modulate the temperature of sensing
layer was the most effective to distinguish several gases with
one single sensor [4].
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have presented a preliminary evaluation
of a new gases identification method aiming to discriminate
several gases with a single MOX sensor, under real
conditions of use, i.e. in the permanent presence of a gas
concentration.
This
method
is
based
on
temperature
modulation of the sensing layer of the sensor, for a fixed gas
concentration, followed by data treatment using temporal
attributes
of
the
sensor
response.
Finally,
the
PCA
multivariable analysis method, applied to all data, has shown
that it is possible to discriminate NO2, O3 and CO using one
single MOX sensor.
After this preliminary step, more work is in progress in
order to:

study whether the number of temporal attributes can
be reduced;

increase
the
database
by
adding
more
gas
concentrations and mixing the gases with each other
and with humidity;

apply and test classification algorithms such as
Support Vector Machines, k Nearest Neighbors or
Neural Networks.

Abstract—Printed electronics on flexible substrates have 
awakened special interest in the scientific community in recent 
years due to its potential applications. Some of these 
applications are directly connected to the use of textiles and 
fabrics as wearables. The present project has considered all the 
relevant topics that are needed to be taken into account in this 
type of development. The performance and constraints of both 
conductive inks and dielectric materials have been evaluated. 
The results achieved have been used to develop capacitive 
sensors that can bear the flexibility and stretchability 
conditions required by textile substrates, without undergoing 
any damage.  
Keywords - printed electronics; smart textiles; sensors; 
wearables; stretchable; flexible; screen- printing; textile; inkjet;

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Electronics that imitate the natural world by bending, 
flexing and stretching are becoming more and more 
significant as the technology is integrated into our lives, our 
environments and even our bodies. One of the most 
challenging applications is the combination of electronics 
with textiles or fabrics. This idea was defined as smart 
textiles [1] or smart fabrics [2]. The elements included in 
these solutions, such as conductive fibers, conductive 
filaments, conductive yarns, together with woven, knitted or 
non-woven structures, are able to interact with the 
environment of users [3]. Smart textiles are normally used as 
sensors and they are combined with external microprocessors 
units, in order to analyse the information and create some 
kind of action, such as an alert or activation. Smart textiles 
sensors can be mainly classified depending on their 
capability to measuring either resistivity or capacitance 
variations. On one hand, resistive sensors measure variations 
of resistance of a conductive structure that can be a wire or a 
conductive stretchable fabric [4]. On the other hand, 
capacitive sensors use more complex structures that allow to 
measure capacitance variations between two conductive 
materials that can be also conductive threads or conductive 
textiles. This idea has been successfully developed in order 
to measure parameters such as strain [5][6], pressure [7][8], 
respiration [9]-[11], humidity [12][13], gas [14] or 
temperature [15], among others. Moreover, sensors based on 
conductive surfaces such as electrocardiogram (ECG) 
[16][17], 
electromyography 
(EMG) 
[18] 
or 
electroencephalogram 
(EEG) 
[19] 
have 
also 
been 
implemented. 
In addition to conductive threads or conductive fabrics, 
conductive particles or materials can also be printed on the 
surface of textiles [20]. Printed electronics [21] on flexible 
substrates [22][23] have drawn the attention of the scientific 
community during the last years, due to the great potential in 
terms of flexibility and possible final applications. 
Furthermore, these electronics have a lower cost than the 
current standard techniques, which is an added value [24], 
since they can be implemented with reel to reel industrial 
machines [25].  
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the 
materials and manufacturing procedures used. Afterwards, 
Section III presents the experimental results and a discussion 
of them. Finally, section IV provides an overview of the 
conclusions. 
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
During the project, different prototypes have been 
developed using different technologies that can be used in 
smart fabrics. All of them were related to the design and 
development 
of 
fabrics 
with 
intelligent 
properties, 
investigating the scope and limitations of the technologies, in 
order to discover the potential of these applications. 
Most common types of conductive inks are based on 
conductive nanoparticles or microparticles dispersed into a 
polymer matrix. These particles are based on carbon 
particles, metallic particles, such as silver and gold, as well 
as conductive oxides such as ITO or ZnO. These inks are 
usually dried or cured by heating; however, laser or UV 
curing is also possible. When the ink is cured by heat, the 
binder and solvent are removed, forming a conductive layer 
on the surface of the substrate. The required curing 
temperature depends on the type of ink, but the usual range 
covers from 100⁰C to 250⁰C for 5 to 30 minutes. Depending 
on the type of substrate, the curing procedure needs to be 
adjusted.

The use of printed electronics in textiles, despite it is in 
an early stage, is a very promising technology within the 
scope of the smart textiles field. Two critical parameters in 
the global design of the electronic system are the textile 
substrate in which the printing process is carried out, and the 
protection process of the printed ink. Each material or 
element has characteristics that will have an impact on the 
final application. Likewise, the typology of inks, their 
deposition and circuit design, with the added complexity of 
properties such as flexibility and elasticity, pose a challenge 
for their use. In addition, another aspect to consider is the 
interconnection between the flexible electronic and the rigid 
PCB electronic. Therefore, the selection of the connectors 
and the attachment systems are crucial. 
The developed prototypes comply with the requirements 
of functionality and resistance. A careful selection of the 
appropriate materials to use was carried out, as well as the 
optimal conditions of application and manufacture. It should 
be noted that the knowledge acquired throughout the project, 
especially the one derived from the experimentation in the 
application of electronic inks on fabrics, will be very useful 
for future developments. Thus, the results achieved can be 
used in new and more complex applications, or in other 
environments, based on the previous knowledge acquired. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Initially, different ink characterization tests were carried 
out on different substrates, evaluating temperature and 
optimal curing time. These tests were developed taking into 
account the orientation of the tissues in relation to the 
printing direction, as well as other parameters, such as fabric 
roughness, fabric materials and possible surface finishes. 
These tests have been performed using different printing 
technologies depending on the substrate. It can be observed 
that in the case of the fabrics with higher thickness and 
higher diameter of thread, the samples did not show 
electrical conductivity and the values of resistance obtained 
were very high. The rougher a substrate is, the more quantity 
of ink is required during the printing process to reduce the 
negative effect of the substrate surface. In this type of 
substrates, screen-printing technology offers the best 
performance. On the other side, technologies such as 
flexography or inkjet enable a more precise control of the 
quantity of ink added and the line thickness.

relax process. 
In addition, the behaviour of the inks printed on different 
elastic substrates, in terms of their adhesion and 
conductivity, has been evaluated. Stretching percentages 
have also been studied by assessing the variations in 
conductivity produced as a consequence of the undergone 
stretching. These variations in conductivity must be 
considered, in order to minimize the effect in the electronic 
performance. Figure 1 presents the test performed using strip 
lines of conductive material on stretchable substrate. Another 
aspect to consider is the negative effect of the contract-relax 
stretching repetitions, that can produce a considerable 
damage. 
During the project, several prototypes based on 
capacitive sensors have been developed. This type of sensor 
offers the advantage of better supporting the conductive 
limitations than other types of resistive sensors. Initially, a 
study of the relative permittivity of the different materials 
used in this work was carried out. This assessment was 
applied to every non-conductive material, such as fabrics, 
dielectric inks, adhesives and films. The effect of these 
materials has been considered from the fabrication process 
point of view, but also from the sensor performance 
perspective. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The tests carried out with conductive, dielectric and 
resistive inks, that can be stretched or flexed, enable to 
improve the durability of the circuits on flexible substrates, 
such as textiles. For this purpose, a specific selection of 
materials and a proper design of the fabrication process 
needs to be done. In addition, the design process of the 
electronic circuit must consider the existing constraints, in 
order to adjust or minimize the negative effect. On the other 
hand, it was observed that it is possible to reproduce 
electronic circuits on textiles, taking into account certain 
parameters of optimization of ink application and an 
adequate selection of tissues that facilitate the proper 
application and homogeneity.

Abstract— The aim of this idea is to show an early stage draft
for measuring the electrical resistance in a designed/elaborated
textile printed sensor with a mobile Arduino microcontroller.
The textile sensor was developed by the screen printing
technique based on a water dispersion of carbon nanotubes
printing composition. By stretching and squeezing the T-shirt
during breathing, we change the electrical resistances of the
printed sensor. The measured resistance corresponds to the
number of breaths of a person wearing it. The microcontroller
can calculate the number of breaths as a number of electrical
resistance peaks which can lead to monitoring human live
parameters.

INTRODUCTION
Manufacturing textronic systems is not an easy task. In
order for the garment to meet certain properties, it is
necessary to pay attention to a number of factors. When
creating a design of clothes, one cannot forget about the
requirements that accompany electronic products (including
accuracy, measuring range), the behavior of the selected
textile products (including low weight, flexibility), as well as
the applicable principles of materials science and automation.
The proper selection of textiles and electronic systems as
well as their mutual integration is a big challenge for
scientists. With the increase in technology development, the
quality of manufactured systems has improved. Textronic
products are created mainly using everyday clothes by
combining them with a miniaturized electronic system,
sensors, and a power supply system.
The creation of textronic systems is possible due to the
use of sensors. The characteristic properties of some raw
materials from which textile products are made include
piezoelectric and electrostatic properties, as well as shape
memory. Materials using these features are called intelligent
and they combine the functions of both the sensor and the
activator.
The most common sensors are sensors that provide
information in one of the electrical quantities, such as
voltage, current, and electrical resistance. This is due to the
fact that electric current is a signal that is easily amplified,
transmitted over long distances, further processed using
digital techniques and computers, and saved. Their properties
change under the influence of an external stimulus, which
may be e.g. a mechanical stimulus or an electrical impulse.
Several research works [4]-[8] conducted at the Institute
of Material Science of Textiles and Polymer Composites in
Lodz, Poland, showed a real possibility of creating flat fiber
products
with
sensory
properties
containing
carbon
nanotubes. The aim of the presented work is an early stage
draft
for
measuring
the
electrical
resistance
of
the
designed/elaborated printed textile sensor on the chest part of
a garment [6][8], using a mobile Arduino microcontroller.
The measured electrical resistance corresponds to the number
of
breaths
of
a
person
wearing
it.
The
Arduino
microcontroller can calculate the number of breaths as a
number of electrical resistance peaks.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, we present the state of the art in the topic of sensors
controlling human live parameters. In Section III, we present
the practical measurement and aim of calculations we may
follow. Finally, we conclude the work in Section IV.

STATE OF THE ART
The idea of using Arduino is not new [1]. [1] describes the
LilyPad Arduino, a fabric based construction kit that enables
novices to design and build their own soft wearables and
other textile artifacts. An assortment of sensors and actuators
elements can be sewn to cloth substrates and each other with
conductive thread to build e-textiles. In [2], the authors
investigate aspects regarding the use of wearable electronic
sensors, embedded in clothing for monitoring the health
using simple electronics such as Arduino board to perform
signal analysis processes. In [3], there is a breathing rhythm
and an electrocardiography (ECG) measured using flexible
substrates on a T-shirt with bi-axial accelerometers involved.
The work in [3] is a slightly similar to ours, but ours is much
easier to do and simpler to use in everyday life.

Idea of research
The aim of the research is to measure the electrical
resistance with the Arduino microcontroller [9][10] of an
elaborated textile sensor for changes of electrical resistance
during normal activity of a human who is wearing a T-shirt.
The number of breaths may be calculated by the logic inside
Arduino by counting the picks of resistance within 60
seconds. An exemplary architecture diagram is showed in
Figure 1. We will use two resistors: the first resistor is 10k
Ω and the second is represented by the textile sensor. From 
the point of view of Ohm's law, it is important that the
resistors are connected in series. The resistor with a known
resistance of 10k Ohm is between the ground and the cable
connected to the A0 pin, while the tested textile sensor
resistor is between the cable connected to the A0 pin and 5V
from Arduino.
According to Ohm’s law, the current flowing in the
system is the quotient of voltage and resistance of a given
system.
I = U / R
(1)
where I is the current, U
is the voltage, and R isthe
resistance.
Our system consists of two resistors connected in series
with values that we will denote by R1 and R2. R1 will be our
known resistor, while R2 will be a textile sensor. Current I
flows through the system. Such current flows through both
R1 and R2. The voltage drop is in the whole system and in
each of the resistors the voltage changes proportionally to its
value. The voltage that falls on the whole system is the
voltage taken from Arduino, i.e., 5V - we will denote it as U.
Having the above in mind, we can determine the following
formula:
U / (R1 + R2) = U1 / R1
(2)
R2 = ((R1 * U) / U1) – R1
(3)
where R1 is the known resistor 10k Ohm and R2 is the
resistance of the textile sensor.
Formula (3) may be calculated inside the microcontroller.
The values can be stored in the Arduino memory for 60
seconds interval. An average value of peaks, corresponding
to the number of human breaths, may be calculated and
displayed on the LCD. By normal breathing, we perform the
change of the textile sensor electrical resistance, we change
the value of resistance which is connected to the center pin
of the resistor series. This changes the voltage at the center
pin. This voltage is the analog voltage that we will read as an
input by the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). In case of
difficulties with the calculation of the number of peaks, we
may add a derivative element between the textile sensor at
A0 pin and 5V power pin. The potential use of internal timer
may make the calculations easier. It all depends on how the
measurements proceed.

CONCLUSIONS
Works currently carried out by the authors allow to state
that it is possible to measure breaths of humans by using a T-
shirt textile sensor. The authors are aware of the challenges
of

Abstract—Virtual Reality (VR) is based on the use of sensors,
and the customization of its use for agricultural analysis is still
a challenge. This study presents a solution for the analysis of
agricultural soils based on sensor devices, signal conditioning,
X-ray tomographic images, and a VR interface. In such a
context,
tomographic
images
from
soil
samples
can
be
submitted though a user interface to a process of manipulation
and volumetric visualization based on graphic-computational
resources which add functionalities like immersion for the
user’s interaction with the samples. Validation was based on a
case study involving the analysis of the porosity of agricultural
soils samples in which preferential paths for water flow were
reconstructed and manipulated by VR interaction techniques.
In fact, by using 59.6 keV of energy and a time window of 10
seconds for sampling of each tomographic projection, it was
possible to reconstruct digital tomographic images from
agricultural soils to be analyzed using such a system. Results
indicated both a new and non-invasive way for the evaluation
of
the
spatial
organization
and
physical
properties
of
agricultural soils and its potential use for food production.

INTRODUCTION
Evaluating the current evolution in the soil sciences, one
can
observe
an
increasing
interest
in
the
scientific
community in the development and application of non-
invasive techniques for the study of physical characteristics
of agricultural soils. Since the 1980s, one of the noninvasive
methods used for the evaluation of water movement into soil
due to morphology as well as aggregates distribution has
been the application of sensors and Computed Tomography
(CT) for agricultural soil imaging [1]–[8]. From that time, it
has been observed an expressive decreasing in the use of the
invasive gravimetric and neutron probes techniques for water
content
measurements
in
agricultural
soils
[9][10].
Additionally, combined with the development of CT, new
methods of three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction have
been developed, mainly motivated by the lack of information
from two-dimensional models for a precise diagnosis in
studies that require volumetric information [11]. Other
challenges regarding such aspects were associated with the
image reconstruction process, as well as with reconstruction
algorithms, computational capacity, and handling large
amounts of data [12]. Therefore, since then, it has been
understood tomographic reconstruction must consider large
amounts of data and the need to have a large processing
capacity [13][14].
Moreover, owing to the advent of precision agriculture, it
has become imperative to have adequate models for
management based on data analyses not only related to
spatial variability, but also due to the temporal variability in
the
areas
used
for
agriculture.
In
this
sense,
the
standardization of data storage and the architecture of
distributed information systems that allow integration of
different types of data in a simple and transparent way have
become quite important for the development of new methods
for non-invasive analyses in agricultural industry [15]-[20].
For example, digital agricultural soil images are obtained by
tomography and take into account several projections.
Moreover, because one soil sample is scanned at different
angles, a large amount of data needs to be computationally
processed. Nowadays, the use of tomography not only allows
us to obtain information about soil density and moisture at
the pixel level, but also allows quantification of the pore
volume and its representation in three dimensions. The soil
pores vary in size and shape and can be interconnected.
In
1982,
Bouma
highlighted
the
importance
of
determining the continuity of the pore network for the flow
of water in soil [21]. Therefore, not only pore diameter, but
also
pore
continuity,
interferes
with
the
process
of
redistribution of soil water. In such a context, it is important
to assess the porosity of the soil, because, depending on the
soil management strategy adopted for planting, restriction of
soil water flow may occur, thus compromising plant growth.
To determine the soil porosity, volumetric measurements are
conventionally used [22][23]. For this, it is necessary to
collect undisturbed soil samples for quantitative evaluation
of its porosity based on the use of tomographic scanners.
Methods based on volumetric reconstruction have been
developed for such a purpose, mainly due to the inadequacy
of information provided by two-dimensional models for
accurate
diagnosis
in
studies
that
need
volumetric
information. Thus, such methods suggest the composition of
surfaces and volume of the samples under analyses and
contribute to the increase of precision in the process of
information extraction. However, it is still a challenge
gathering all the information from agricultural soils, i.e., the
continuity, size, and shapes of the pores in a soil sample,
among others.
CT is one methodology that allows observing the
structural
components
of
the
soil,
allowing
better
visualization of the behavior of the structure and soil porous
space. However, the interconnection for preferential flow

requires additional methods which can be beyond what CT
can provide. Sensors-based VR techniques can be combined
with CT to assist noninvasive research through immersive
and interactive processes.
VR was born in the eighties to help differentiate
traditional computational simulations of the synthetic worlds,
and researchers like Bolt [24] and Lanier [25] played a key
role in its development. VR transports a person into a fully
immersive and interactive experience with a degree of
realism. Academics, software developers, and researchers are
still trying to define a VR based on their own experiences.
However, it is possible to observe in specialized literature
that all of them technically consider the term related to a
immersive and interactive experience, i.e., based on images
generated by computers, rendering, or not in real time [26]-
[29]. In fact, the concept of sensors-based VR is related to
the use of sensors in external devices, i.e., digital gloves,
video-helmets, digital caves, digital tables, among others. In
1994, Machover stated that the quality of a VR system is a
significant consideration, because it stimulates the user to the
maximum in a creative and productive way, providing
feedback coherently regarding the user’s movements [30].
Presently, only some units of research have developed
projects using sensors-based VR applications in the area of
scientific visualization, such as tomographic reconstruction,
due to the high cost and technical difficulties involved in
such processes. However, some proposals have appeared to
minimize the difficulties of development and maintenance of
the systems and necessary programs.
Additionally, a better organization of human resources
has now been observed to integrate areas of the knowledge
leading to the application of such advanced methods based
on the connection and use of those technologies. Thereby,
the main objective of this work is to present the development
of a VR system to support the analysis of 3D reconstructed
soil samples using innovative immersive visualization and
interaction techniques by integrating sophisticated external
sensors-based devices.
Specifically, this paper presents the organization and
implementation of a synthetic environment that makes
possible the visualization, analysis, and manipulation of soil
samples
produced
by
an
algorithm
of
volumetric
reconstruction of X-ray tomographic images through graphic
computational tools and non-conventional sensors-based VR
devices, aiming immersion and user interaction at the scene
entities, making possible the non-destructive analysis of
agricultural soil samples, as shown by a case study in Soil
Science.
The materials and methods used in this work are
described in Section 2. In Section 3, the obtained results are
discussed, and the conclusions are presented in Section 4.
II.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The conceptual and methodological structuring applied to
the development of the sensors-based VR system dedicated
to the inspection of digital tomographic images from
agricultural
soils uses data obtained
by
means
of a
volumetric reconstruction algorithm. Figure 1 shows a
general view of the sensors-based VR system dedicated to
the tomographic inspection of agricultural soil samples, as
well as the dataflow. From this tomographic image data, soil
samples can be reconstructed, imported, and treated by
several VR processes, focusing on the analysis related to the
soil science area.
Figure 1. General view of the sensors-based VR system customized for the
inspection of tomographic samples of agricultural soils, as well as a view of
the dataflow from the acquisition process to the visualization process.
The software system was organized based on the concept
of classes. In object-oriented programming, a class is an
extensible program code template used for creating objects,
providing initial values for states (member variables), and
implementations
of
behavior
(member
functions
or
methods). In this work, the following classes have been
considered:
Reconstruction,
Loader,
Transformations,
Polygonal
Attributes
Extraction,
Filter,
Transparency,
Illumination,
Coloring,
Conventional
Collision,
Non-
conventional Collision, Conventional Model Manipulation,
Non-conventional Model Manipulation, Conventional Scene
Manipulation,
Non-conventional
Scene
Manipulation,
Quaternion, Visualization, and VR Environment.
All
classes
were
implemented
using
the
Java
programming language and the Java3D API [31].
A CT scanner from Embrapa Instrumentation was used to
obtain the tomographic image data. All of the tomographic
projections
allowed
image
reconstruction,
i.e.,
turning
possible generation of mass attenuation coefficient maps
given in cm2/g with spatial resolution equal to or larger than
1 mm. All of the soil samples were submitted to the
acquisition process using an amount of energy of 59.6 keV
and a time window equal to 10 seconds for sampling of the
points for the tomographic projection.
For two-dimensional reconstruction, an algorithm of
Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) was used, with a filtering
based on the use of the Hamming´s window, implemented
under 1-D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), using the C++
language [32]. After that, a suitable filtering technique was
37

ALLSENSORS 2020 : The Fifth International Conference on Advances in Sensors, Actuators, Metering and Sensing

also used with the 2-D reconstructed images. The filtering
technique was based on the use of the Wavelet Daubechies
Transform (WDT), which allowed filtering of only certain
image areas preserving borders and details, i.e., through
using a window with 76 coefficients [33].
An
interpolation-based
overlapping
algorithm
of
reconstructed
two-dimensional
slices
was
adopted
for
volumetric reconstruction. Such a technique consists of
setting up the plans generated by the function f(x, y, zi) for i
= 0... (n-1), where n is the number of reconstructed plans.
Consequently,
specific
two-dimensional
slices
were
interpolated to reconstitute the spaces left among these
overlapped plans.
Figure 2 shows the overlapping original plans and the
interpolated plans. This method was used to reduce the
computational costs and the radiation time, with the use of
interpolation in between the spaces of the reconstructed
slices based on the use of B-splines [34]. Thus, with only a
few slices, the algorithm was prepared to estimate and
complete the entire information.
The sensors-based VR system for the inspection of
agricultural soils samples was organized based on the CT
images and a set of non-conventional sensors to support the
VR environment. In addition, for the evaluation of the
preferential paths for the water movement in soil, sensors
were used to detect motion based on the use of gloves and
the space based on 3-D visualization (using a CCD head-
mounted
display)
as
well
as
microelectromechanical
actuators based on piezo-electrical devices [35][36]. Such
sensors were necessary to translate movement and to help the
users understand the relation of the workspace with the
agricultural soil samples.
Figure 2. Volumetric reconstruction based on a set of reconstructed slices
and the use of B-spline interpolator.
At the end of the process, the volumetric model is
converted into the Wavefront File Format (.obj) using the
vtkOBJExporter class from the vtkOBJExporter.h package of
the visualization toolkit. This format has been chosen for its
high performance and flexibility when importing such
models to a virtual environment, where all their attributes
can be customized for graphic APIs.
The Attributes Extraction class obtains the voxels data
from a volumetric image, using those above-mentioned input
non-conventional
devices,
i.e.,
supplying
the
users’
information
on
a
specific
point
of
the
volumetric
representation.
Initially,
the
objects
of
the
classes
PickCanvas and PickResult are instantiated, and these
objects are responsible for activating the data extraction of a
Canvas3D object and storing such data in vectors of event
results. Based on user interest, a region can be selected and
attributes extracted using a coordinate z, since it can be
stabilized on the selected region in the display, allowing
selection through a two-dimensional viewport in an intuitive
way.
Thus, the available data for picking operations under
instances of Shape3D and their respective methods are: the
borders, with getBounds; the scene graphs, with getLocale
and numBranchGraph; the geometries, with getGeometry;
ColoringAttributes, with get.ColoringAttributes; the material
under the Hue, Saturation, Lightness (HSL) and Red, Green,
Blue
(RGB)
formats,
with
getMaterial;
the
transparency,getTransparency; and the polygons, with the
getAppearance.getPolygonAttributes.getPolygonMod class.
In addition, an object is instantiated, belonging to the
PickIntersection class, also of the com.sun.j3d.utils.picking
package, responsible for sheltering the collision point
between an entity/node and the two-dimensional cursor.
Thus, this instance stores in its content the intersection
product among an entity of PickResult with the chosen
Canvas3D
point,
which
is
passed
to
the
getClosestIntersection
method
as
the
parameter.
The
PickIntersection class can offer through its events: the
distance between the point and the observer with the
getDistance method; the coordinates of the point with the
getCoordinates method; the coordinates of the closest vertex
with the getClosestVertexCoordinates method; the normal
straight line of the point with the getNormal method; and the
transformation head offices with the getMatrix method.
The classes PickIntersection and PickResult, as well as
the Attributes Extraction class, can allow the reading of each
mass
attenuation
coefficient
value,
present
in
the
tomographic volume. In this context, these values can be
obtained through the gray level tones, which are represented
by luminance, index “L” from the HSL pattern, obtained by
using the class getMaterial method.
The Non-conventional Scene Manipulation class is one of
the most important for user interactivity and immersion in
the VR environment, since it allows user browsing in all
directions through the synthetic scene, approximating and
going into the reconstructed structures using data gloves
P5Glove [37]. For the accomplishment of such events, the
manipulation classes and the model of the scene are both
based on another auxiliary class called FPSGlove, which is
available in the com.essentialreality package offered by the
device manufacturer. The FPSGlove classes is responsible
for including all the parameters regarding non-conventional
devices, and include the positioning, orientation, and finger
bending, i.e., making it possible to detect the proximity and
inclination, and thus launch a series of customized events.
On the other hand, in relation to the constructor method
of classes, additional parameters of the same importance can
be activated, such as: (1) P5_Init; (2) P5_setForward; (3)
P5_setMouseState;
(4)
P5_setFilterAmount;
and
(5)
P5_setRequiredAccuracy. These classes are responsible for
initializing, determining the positive direction, and turning
off the mouse, filtering the sign and determining the
precision movements, respectively. Soon afterwards, the
methods responsible for detecting the position of the glove in

the real environment are declared. The methods are the
getXPosition, getYPosition and getZPosition, which map the
triggers mentioned before to launch an event type; it means,
they monitor the values received by the glove through
instances of the class P5State, a class responsible for
determining the current state of the glove. Thus, through the
filterPos method of P5State, the exact position of the device
is obtained and then assigned to the methods to check if the
limits were or were not outdated.
In a manner similar to the positioning detection methods
still in the FPSGlove class, the methods getYaw, getPitch,
and getRoll are described, as a solution for detecting the
inclination of the device in the Y, X, and Z axes, to
determine if the established limits for the flags were reached.
After having implemented the monitors and triggers of
events with the auxiliary class, the Non-conventional Scene
Manipulation class is also used with the ViewingPlatform
class. In such a way, two other specific parameters are
included, each of them related to the translation and rotation
steps respectively. Such an arrangement is responsible for
defining when the virtual models will be moved or leans in
each movement of the device in the real world and
recognized by the FPSGlove class.
Once such a process is concluded, the instance of the
Non-conventional
Scene
Manipulation
class
should
be
harnessed to the object of the ViewingPlatform class of the
current Canvas3D object, so that all of the movements can
be related on the scene and not the volumetric model, i.e.,
through
the
setViewingPlatform
method.
The
Non-
conventional Model Manipulation is a class responsible for
accomplishing
the
three-dimensional
representation
movement through real movements of the data glove
P5Glove, where the user can change the positioning and
orientation of models in real time in all directions and angles,
contributing to the VR environment interactivity in six
degrees of freedom. To operate such a process, it is
important
to
consider
the
Non-conventional
Scene
Manipulation class, in which the current implementation
uses the support FPSGlove class.
Thus, the Non-conventional Model Manipulation class is
an extension of the Behavior class, a class that describes
behaviors, customized for reactions to the movements of the
device.
Furthermore,
after
assigning
the
methods
getXPosition, getYPosition, and getZPosition to obtain the
positioning, and the methods getYaw, getPitch, and getRoll
to obtain the orientation under instances of the FPSGlove
class, the method rotateQuaternion is called. Such a method,
responsible for converting rotations is accomplished based
on the Euler angles in Quaternion coordinates and is useful
to establish rotations with complex numbers and imaginary
axis, in order to contribute to the movement’s precision.
The rotateQuaternion method assigns to its class the axis
and angles parameters in Euler coordinates and returns a
quaternion description; a set used in the same Quat4f
constructor, constructing a quaternion of float, and after a
setRotation
executes
a
rotation
with
instances
of
Transform3D.
At the end of the process, the product of Non-
conventional Model Manipulation class is encapsulated in a
BranchGroup object and assigned to the transformation
group,
TransformGroup,
which
conducts
the
three-
dimensional representation movements in a distinct way
from the previous class. In such a way, not only all of the
movements’ detection but also the effective positioning
change and the entities orientation produce effects under the
current models in the Canvas3D object.
The
Non-conventional
Collision
class
treats
the
implementation of a collision detection algorithm added to
the Non-conventional Scene Manipulation class and is
restricted to events that use non-conventional input data
devices, specifically those provided by the data glove
P5Glove. In that way, through the algorithm, the users are
also prevented from crossing the faces of a three-dimensional
representation during the browsing process in synthetic
scenes, allowing only the cameras transpositions inside the
empty spaces among such faces, simulating real physical
processes.
Thus, each spatial position of the glove is tested as the
current instance of itself; each direction of movement is
limited to a specific moment, where the possible alternatives
are:
left,
right,
up,
down,
forward,
and
back.
After
identifying the positioning of the glove in the moment of a
supposed collision, the Non-conventional Collision class can
block the device movement. Thus, the last movement of the
glove when a collision has been stopped is recorded,
although the glove can freely be moved in the real
environment. This is caused by a new instantiation of the
current position of the glove, assigning empty vectors to
them, in other words, initialized in the origin, i.e., causing
the immediate stop of the device movement.
Additionally, at the same time, when accomplishing any
other move that does not take them to a continuation of the
blocking, the class interprets them and allows continuing the
valid movements series through a new instantiation of the
mapped positions of the glove, using as parameters the
position where the collision began and the linear step was
adopted by the class. At the end of this process, a Shape3D is
added to PhysicalBody to detect the browsing of the scene
being used by a user, allowing interaction and selection of
each three-dimensional face. The algorithm of such a class
allows both preventing the browsing to continue (or not) in a
scene, as well as providing information of the direction of
the glove movement since it became active.
The Quaternion class implements a conversion algorithm
so that the system stops using just rotations on the x, y and z
axes,
and
starts
to
accomplish
orientations
on
some
intermediate axis, defined by a vector that goes through the
origin and reaches a point in space. Such a type of an axis
can be represented by a specific coordinate of the real
device, e.g., the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) of one of the
eight LEDs present in the controller tower which is used
with the glove [38].
To accomplish this operation, it uses imaginary bases and
complex numbers, providing an alternative parameter for the
setRotation, method of the Transform3D class, which allows
using a quaternion as an argument. Thus, calling an instance
of Quaternion to accomplish a rotation with the non-
conventional device P5Glove, the orientation of the glove is

interpreted by the FPSGlove class and translated by Non-
conventional Scene Manipulation or Model, is converted
from the Euler system to the Quaternion base, returned for
the system new orientation coordinates, to then be executed
by the Quat4f method of Transform3D, which encapsulates
the entire functioning of the quaternion as previously
described.
For the implementation of the Visualization class, the
system interface prepares a volumetric tomographic image to
be visualized. This way, the volumetric tomographic image
is prepared to be adjusted to the 3-D model, i.e., to occupy
the whole extension of the Canvas3D object, so that all of
the spaces are taken advantage of, contributing to the
visualization quality.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Based on the use of the tomographic projections and the
two-dimensional
reconstruction
FPB
algorithm,
it
was
possible to get volumetric images by means of use of the B-
spline algorithm.
Figure
3
presents
examples
of
the
volumetric
tomographic images obtained for stratified agricultural soil,
degraded soil, and a clay soil sample, respectively. Based on
the Attributes Extraction class, intrinsic characteristics of the
scene and of agricultural samples could be obtained through
the use of either the mouse or the P5Glove, with a data origin
in
the
three-dimensional
representations
in
the
VR
environment. The data set was divided into two categories:
one concerning the scene, and the other concerning the CT
measurements.
In relation to the first category, the synthetic scene data
are related to: borders, which have represented the geometry
limits or the geometry limits that involved it; the scene
graph, that has represented the node hierarchy in the tree; the
current geometry in the model and its composition, the
distance of a certain voxel in relation to the coordinates
chosen in the scene, the closest vertex to the chosen point in
the scene, the three-dimensional coordinates, and the normal
straight line in the closest face, which involved the chosen
coordinates.
Secondly, concerning the tomographic data, the obtained
data were: color attributes, which represented the individual
color of each voxel, independent of illumination intensity;
the mass attenuation coefficients values of the agricultural
soils, which are represented by the colors of each analyzed
voxel, and are related to the light intensity in each position;
transparency attributes; and polygons attributes, and finally
the saturation and matrix of the HSL coefficients.
An experiment for validation of the result was prepared
considering a digital and volumetric tomographic image
obtained from a latosol soil. For such a volumetric image, the
value of an arbitrary voxel was taken as presented in Figure
4.
Based on the developed method, the attributes can be
obtained from the latosol soil tomographic image at the
sensors-based
VR
environment,
i.e.,
under
the
two
mentioned
aspects,
through
the
choice
of
any
voxel
coordinates, assuring the reliable recovery of the sample
data.

As an example of such a result, attributes can be obtained
and presented as below:
In relation to the Non-conventional Scene Manipulation,
the feedback produced by the class implementation has
indicated absolute control of user browsing on the scene
using the P5Glove. In this context, according to device
positioning, the users can browse through the scene where
the displacement of their hand is faithfully translated in
scene
movements,
including
moving
the
environment
cameras in real time. Analogously, such movements are also
translated in the three-dimensional displacements.
Practically,
such
movement
with
a
glove
should
commence with closed hands, where the sensors are
activated by bending fingers, thus starting the action. The
Non-conventional Model Manipulation class simulates the
manual support of 3-D samples, as well as its total
movement inside the scene, with 6 degrees of freedom.
Also, the Quaternion class, when evaluated, presented an
adequate
conversion
from
Euler`s
coordinates
to
Quaternion`s
coordinates.
In
addition,
the
results
of
application of the Transform3D class produced smooth
orientation changes. Table I presents an example of results
for the 180º rotation, considering the initial position of the
LED = (-1.0, 1.0, 0.0), and the origin of the three axes that is
at coordinates (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
Figure 5 presents the visual results of the applied
transform. Such a result has demonstrated that the three
rotations were composed by commutation of four other
rotations of smaller angles. Also, the transposition of an
orientation for another happened in a soft way, without leaps
or arbitrary paths, leading to an intuitive result.
The
three-dimensional
samples
were
examined
immersively by the Head Mounted Display through the
Visualization class. First, Canvas3D, responsible for the
rendering of three-dimensional images, was maximized to
omit the parts related to the main interface in the device to
focus only on the region where the sample was shown. Thus,
each display of HMD forms an image which is shown and
interpreted by the user’s brain with a larger depth effect.
Secondly, such an effect also has allowed performing the
analyses of the preferential paths of the water flow into the
agricultural soil samples, called fingering effects, as well as
the verification of the percentage of pores in the samples.

As
described
in
the
Non-conventional
Scene
Manipulation class, as the cameras are moved with the
navigation processes, activated by keyboard interaction, or
data glove P5Glove, the traveled paths can be demarcated;
leaving
the
itinerary
registered
under
visual
and
mathematical form. Furthermore, for each device movement
identified, a new position for the camera is established, i.e.,
given by new coordinates (x, y, z).
Such positions are unique and occupied only one at a
time. Thus, activated by the demarcation process, forming
any point, the traveled path can be simulated for a certain
water flow, i.e, when working with an agricultural sample.
When accomplishing a certain movement, the current point
occupied by the camera receives a Shape3D under the form
of a blue sphere, which simulates the presence of a fluid drop

occupying the previous position of the camera, leaving a
bluish trace through where the camera passed. Similar to the
simple scene manipulation, such demarcation obeys the laws
imposed by the Non-conventional Collision class, i.e., the
traveled path is prevented from passing over the non-porous
faces of the agricultural sample, leading the flow of fluids to
pass through the related pores, which are the preferential
paths.
The process can be repeated several times in ways similar
to real situations. It is also possible to make border
calculation where the limits of three-dimensional samples are
identified in space, as in the case of Attributes Extraction
class through the use of getBounds on Shape3D instances
combined
with
a
three-dimensional
borders
detection
algorithm called Polytope, available in the Bounds package
of Java3D API.
Besides, by using such an algorithm has become possible
drawing plans around of the surfaces of the soil samples
images, i.e., to delimit their borders exactly. Thus, it allows
the nonporous parts of the samples, including the internal
ones, to be identified, allowing the verification of its volume
in cm³.
Figure 6 presents the results of the case study based on a
tomographic image from degraded agricultural soil, where
the sample is in gray tones and the water flow is represented
with a blue color, demarcating the traveled paths.
Figure 6. Result of the case study using a degraded soil sample, i.e., with
representations of the non-porous soil portion (gray), emptiness (yellow),
and water flow (blue) in between the soil pores.
In fact, once the non-porous part has been identified, the
remaining portions were recognized based on the emptiness
of the sample, which present the color that corresponds to
those voxels in which there was an absence of the photons
attenuation. The porous voxel was filled out with a semi-
transparent yellow color, seeking a larger prominence close
to the sample. With such available data, it is possible to
calculate the total volume of the sample (sum of the non-
porous parts with its complement) in cm³. Thus, starting
from the total volume and the individual volume of the non-
porous part, it is possible to calculate exactly the volume
represented by the emptiness of the three-dimensional
sample.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
This work presented the development of a new method
which considered the integration of a sensors-based VR
environment with a CT for the dedicated inspection of
agricultural soils. Results have shown both the possibility of
accessing CT digital images of the agricultural soils and the
opportunity of handling three-dimensional manipulation and
graphic
visualization
processes
through
computational
devices. Such a developed method allowed the addition of
immersion and the user`s interaction with soil samples.
These resources involved rendering control, illumination,
coloring, attributes extraction, and physical transformation,
as well as the integration of non-conventional data input and
output devices, such as a Head-Mounted Display (video-
helmet), and digital gloves.
In addition, it was also observed that the Java3D API
provided, in its group of classes, essential methods for HMD
programming.
Such
development
has
encapsulated
practically all of stereoscopy programming. Furthermore, the
case study demonstrated the applicability of the method in
visualization processes and agricultural soil sample analysis,
considering the progress and facilities when accomplishing
non-invasive inspections.
Finally, the integration of CT and sensors-based VR
made possible the measuring of volumes of emptiness of the
samples, i.e., the pores, and simulation of the water flow path
for the formation of preferential fingering. Future work will
consider embedded systems based on the use of the Field
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), as well as use of the
augmented reality concepts.

Abstract—In this paper, we present an outline of our livestock 
monitoring system using long range (LoRa) in a low-power 
wide-area network and evaluate the performance of our LoRa 
device for use as a livestock monitoring system. We herein 
present the purpose of the project, an evaluation of LoRa 
transmission distance on a farm, and the application of our 
results. On the basis of our evaluation of LoRa, we confirm that 
it is a feasible technology for monitoring the behavior of 
livestock, particularly cows, on large farms.

 INTRODUCTION 
Several changes recently occurred in the methods of farm 
management in Japan. Farm size has become more extensive 
and efficient, promoting the American large-scale herd-
management method. As a result, Japanese-style breeding 
management, which is based on a relationship of trust with 
livestock, has been lost. Breeding selection has dramatically 
improved the lactation ability of cows, but it led to a decline 
in body condition and weakening of reproductive behavior, 
primarily because of the lack of energy. Accordingly, artificial 
insemination at the correct time presents difficulties; it was 
reported in U.S. that the rate of successful pregnancies of 
cattle has been reduced to roughly 30% in the late 1990s 
(which was previously 60% in the late 1970s) [1], and in Japan 
to roughly 46% in 2009 (which was previously 60% in 1989) 
[2]. As a result, the number of cows and the production of raw 
milk have decreased.  
Fine-grained, low-stress feeding management can reduce 
morbidity, increase reproductive efficiency, and improve the 
quality of raw milk. Breeding management that involves 
taking care of each animal and maximizing its individuality 
and ability can lead to the production of high-value-added 
milk. In this context, grazing is currently attracting attention 
for its ability to manage cows in a less stressful and more 
natural environment. The relationship between the production 
of high-value-added milk through pasturing and observing the 
feeding behavior of cows while grazing and the overall health 
status is not entirely clear. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
explain the design of our proposed system. Section III 
introduces related research. In Section IV, we discuss the 
long-range (LoRa) [3] technology (included in ARIB STD-
T108 in Japan [4]). In Section V, we explain an experiment 
for measuring the communication distance of LoRa in a 
different environment in detail. Finally, Section VI presents 
our research results and Section VII concludes the paper.

 SYSTEM DESIGN 
Generally, cow health must be maintained to ensure the 
production of high-quality raw milk. Fig. 1 shows the 
relationship between a cow’s health and its behavior. An 
outline of this study is presented in Fig. 2.  
To measure the effect of grazing, we set three technical 
targets as follows: 
• 
Target 1: Real-time tracking of cow-feeding 
behavior 
• 
Target 2: Real-time measurement of cow rumen pH 
levels 
• 
Target 3: Application of a machine-learning model 
to estimate the quality of raw milk 
The outline of each target is explained in the following 
subsections.  
A. Real-Time Tracking of Cow-Feeding Behavior 
Purpose: To understand the behavior of cows while 
grazing and investigate the relationship between 
this behavior and milk quality. 
Tasks: 
Develop a sensor box that can detect location (Global 
Navigation 
Satellite 
System, 
GNSS) 
and 
accelerometer data. Send the data to a server via LoRa. 
• 
The number of steps and the number of chewing 
cycles are estimated from accelerometer data. 
• 
Activity is estimated from the walking distance 
calculated using location data. 
B. Real-Time Measurement of Cow Rumen pH Levels  
Purpose: To understand the health situation of cows and 
clarify the relationship between the pH level and 
the quality of raw milk.  
Tasks: 
• 
Develop a pH sensor that can be used on rumen and 
that can send data external to the cow’s body. 
• 
Develop a communication system to send a pH sensor 
outside the rumen. 
C. Machine-Learning Model for Estimating the Quality of 
Raw Milk 
Purpose: To estimate the quality of raw milk from the 
behavior and pH level of cow rumen. 
Task: 
• 
Develop a machine-learning model to estimate the 
quality of raw milk from the behavior and pH level of 
cow rumen. 
In the following two sections, related work and a technical 
outline of LoRa will be described. 
III. 
RELATED WORK 
Many studies have measured the behavior of livestock. In 
[5], a method was introduced to track the movement of cows 
using a black-and-white pattern of the surface of a cow house. 
In [6], a location-detection technique in a cow house using 
ultrawideband and tags was presented. In [7], a technique for 
observing the cow-feeding behavior using an accelerometer in 
a cow house was addressed. All of these technologies focus 
on the use of a cow house. 
In [8], a technique for monitoring locomotion and posture 
activity was presented, but no function for transmitting data to 
the server in real time was provided. The work in [9] explains 
system aspects such as nodes, gateways, and servers and is 
based on a LoRa wide-area network (LoRaWAN). However, 
in that study, no real field tests were conducted. In [10], the 
performance of LoRa and custom protocols for monitoring 
livestock was discussed; however, hypothetical situations are 
always slightly different from the conditions on a real farm.

LORA 
It is highly expected that LPWA will be used for 
communication technologies in IoT systems. This technology 
has the following features: 
• 
Low cost 
• 
Low-power consumption, except for Bluetooth 
Low Energy and ordinary near-field 
communication technologies, which require a 
generous power supply 
• 
Long-distance coverage (from several hundreds of 
meters up to several kilometers) 
• 
Connectivity to multiple devices 
• 
Transfer of small amounts of data at speeds 
ranging from 100 bps to 1 Mbps 
The most popular LPWA standard is LoRa [3]. The LoRa 
Alliance particularly defines LoRaWAN [12]. LoRa defines 
the modulation technology of the physical layer of a chip, and 
LoRaWAN also includes a media access control layer. 
Furthermore, LoRaWAN specifies the interoperability of

Low-Power Wide rea (LPWA) [11] is a type of network 
that is becoming popular for LoRa license-free wireless 
communication technologies. This type of network can 
provide news services for long-distance communication 
(from several hundreds of meters up to several kilometers) in 
rural areas. Additionally, LPWA operates at the subgigahertz 
(sub-GHz) band, which has excellent penetration. It is 
expected that LPWA will be able to provide several useful 
features for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as low 
cost, low-power consumption, long-distance communication, 
connection of a significant number of IoT devices, and small-
scale data transmission (ranging from 100 bps to 1 Mbps).

LoRa devices. LoRa employs chirp spectrum spread, thereby 
allowing long-distance communication. 
When using LoRa, two parameters must be included: 
bandwidth (BW) and spreading factor (SF). A smaller BW 
allows for communication across a longer distance, whereas 
a larger SF allows for communication over a longer distance. 
However, if we wish to achieve communication over even 
longer distances, we need to select appropriate parameters. 
The relationship between the BW and the SF of the ES920LR 
LoRa chip that we used in 2019 is described in Table I. 
V. 
EXPERIMENT 
We performed several trials to check the communication 
distance of LoRa.  
A. Locations 
In order to check the communication distance, we used 
four locations as follows:  
(1) Oku-Nikko: flat, wide forest and marsh in the Nikko 
National Park (400 ha, roughly 4 × 4 km). 
(2) Utsunomiya University Farm: flat farmland with some 
trees (50 ha, roughly 1 × 0.5 km). 
(3) Near the Engineering Department: city area with 
buildings and factories surrounding the campus area.  
(4) Ozasa Farm: one of the largest livestock farms in 
Japan (362 ha, roughly 4 × 4 km).  
B. Devices and GNSS Data 
 We developed a LoRa device using the following 
parameters. 
 In these experiments, the transmitted data, including the 
GNSS location data, were 35 bytes. According to Table I, we 
estimated that one data could be transmitted within 5 s. Fig. 3 
shows the receiver and transmitter that we used in the 
experiment conducted at Ozasa Farm, both of which used the 
same LoRa chip (ES920LR [13]). The transmitter had a GNSS 
receiver and sent location data to the receiver. 
C. Okumura-Hata Model 
The Okumura–Hata model [14][15] is an approximate 
curve used for estimating the radio-wave propagation 
characteristics of wireless devices at the development stage 
of mobile communication systems in different environments 
in open areas; suburbs; and small, medium, and large cities. 
The equations shown in Fig. 4 were used for loss calculation. 
In the experiment, we measured not only the communication 
distance but also the fitting of the Okumura–Hata model. If

the results showed a good fit with the Okumura–Hata model, 
we would be able to use that model to estimate the reach of 
LoRa. 
D. Experiments 
We started performing LoRa tests in 2018 (see [16][17]) 
under different situations (e.g., in city, forest, and farm areas), 
as described in Table II. In [16][17], we reported the LoRa test 
results for three different cases (Cases 1, 2, and 4 in Table II) 
and confirmed that the communication distance closely fit the 
Okumura–Hata model. 
We herein explain a recent experiment (December 3, 2019) 
conducted on a farmland in a mountainous area (Case 3 in 
Table II). 
As previously noted, Ozasa Farm is one of the largest 
livestock farms in Japan (362 ha). Fig. 5 shows a panoramic 
view of the farm. We set a LoRa receiver at the center of the 
farm on a tripod (at a height of roughly 2 m) and then traversed 
the farm on foot holding two LoRa transmitters. As noted in 
Section 5-B, data including the GNSS location were 
transmitted every 5 s. We used a BW of 62 and an SF of 12 to 
achieve the highest possible sensitivity. Fig. 6(a) shows the 
trace of the transmitted location, and Fig. 6(b) shows the trace 
of the received data with location. The log shows that LoRa 
was able to cover almost all areas. Table III shows the 
message-receiving rate, which was on average greater than 
80%. We believe that this result indicates that LoRa is a 
feasible measure for monitoring livestock. Fig. 7 shows fitting 
of the Okumura–Hata model with these results. The results 
show that a loss occurred between open land and suburbs but 
that the results nonetheless met the requirements for Ozasa 
Farm. The Okumura–Hata model can, therefore, be used to 
estimate the potential of LoRa in a farm environment.  
In the next step of our research, we will design sensor 
devices and a matching receiver for cows. If the transmitter 
sends data every 5 min and each data transmission requires 5 s, 
we will be able to obtain data from 60 cows using the same 
band. Each transmitter will have a GNSS device, allowing the 
scheduling of the transmission time for each cow without 
congestion. The LoRa device [13] will have 37 channels if the 
BW is narrower than 125 kHz; this will enable us to monitor 
2,220 cows at the same time. Ozasa Farm generally supports 
1,500 cows grazing on its pasture. As such, our system will be 
able to monitor them all. 
VI. 
APPLICATION OF THE RESEARCH RESULTS 
The Japanese Government is currently promoting the 
notion of Society 5.0 [18], an idea that was proposed at the 5th 
Science and Technology Basic Plan (2016–2020) for 
conducting a future Japanese society. The aim of Society 5.0 
is to achieve a high degree of convergence between 
cyberspace (virtual space) and physical (real) space. In 
Society 5.0, a significant amount of information from sensors 
in physical space is accumulated in cyberspace. In cyberspace, 
this big data is analyzed by AI, and the analyzed results are 
fed back to physical space in various forms to support society, 
business, and economics. 
An outline of Society 5.0 for agriculture is described in Fig. 
8. In order to solve problems related to agriculture and food,

AI and big-data analysis technology are used to produce 
higher-quality primary products, such as milk, meat, and rice. 
Then, these high-quality products allow smart food chain and 
smart production systems to produce high-quality secondary 
and tertiary products. In addition, robots support the primary 
agricultural industry to solve problems such as aging among 
farmers. After realizing a new style of agriculture, we expect 
developing a new business model as illustrated in Fig. 9. Once 
we can produce high-quality raw milk, we will be able to 
produce high-quality butter and cheese and, subsequently, 
flavorsome sweets and dishes. The effect of such products and 
services is expected to promote gastronomy and health 
tourism.  
The results of this research provide a potential platform for 
gathering real-time data from livestock within a wide area 
using LPWAs such as LoRa. Developing such a platform to 
gather data from sensors by LPWAs will serve as an important 
basis for reforming agriculture in a Society 5.0 context. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we introduced our research results for 
developing a monitoring system that can track the behavior of 
cows and pH levels for grazing and an AI model to estimate 
the quality of raw milk. With this research ongoing, we were 
able to explain in detail the performance of LoRa in a real 
situation. Accordingly, LoRa was able to cover the entire area 
of farmland evaluated. Furthermore, we also briefly addressed 
the broader scope of a new food chain business model based 
on the Society 5.0 context. 
We hereby plan to develop a system based on the results 
of this research in the second quarter of 2020 and to evaluate 
said system by the end of 2020.

Abstract— Agricultural production has grown in recent years,
increasing the use of Organic Fertilizers (OF). For that reason,
the use of these compounds must be controlled in fertigation
water. In this paper, we test three prototypes, using different
combinations of coils, to determine the amount of OF in the
water. A coil is powered by a sine wave of 3.3 peak-to-peak
Volts for inducing another coil. The objective of this system is
to detect different kinds of problems that can cause incorrect
fertilization, which affects the sustainability of agriculture. We
present the tests to verify the proper functioning of the
prototypes. We test our prototypes by means of different
dilutions of OF. The used concentrations of OF are between 0
and 20 g/l. We measure the conductivity for each concentration
and the output voltage of our prototypes. The results show that
prototype 3 is the one that has the best performance, obtaining
1.47 V of difference between the maximum and minimum
output voltage and a good correlation coefficient. Finally, a
verification test is carried out; the average error in the
different samples tested is 0.2212%.

INTRODUCTION
The
use
of
fertilizer,
pesticides,
agriculture
mechanization, and high-yielding varieties of plants have
generated an increase in crop productions. This increase has
produced a decrease in food prices and reduced world
hunger. However, the use of fertilizer, pesticides, and large
agricultural machines causes essential problems in the
environment, which can cause a reduction in the production
of harvest in the future.
The use of an incorrect technique of fertilizing can cause
severe
problems
in
the
environment.
These
problems
include: (i) nitrification of groundwater, (ii) pollution of
surface water, (iii) transport of pollutants in soils, and
accumulation of fertilizer in soils [1][2]. In addition, the
excess of fertilizer causes an increment in the cost of
maintenance
of
the
crops
without
an
increment
of
production. Traditionally, fertilizers are used without any
control. Some farmers think that if production is poor, they
need to use more fertilizer. However, the correct fertilizer is
not being added even at the right points. For proper
fertilization of the crops, the right quantity and type of
fertilizer need to be used. If there is an excess of the
fertilizer, this excess is not used by plants, and it accumulates
in the soil or groundwater. In addition, the fertilizer can
increment the concentration of limited nutrients in the soil. If
a nutrient is limited in the soil, the plants cannot absorb the
fertilizer by growing. This will cause an excess of nutrients
in the soil because the nutrients are not absorbed by plants
[3]. The limiting nutrient can be defined as the nutrient that
is bioavailable in lower concentration than is used for
growing
biological
organisms.
This
causes
biological
organisms
to
not grow even
if they have
sufficient
concentrations of other nutrients. For this reason, it is
essential that fertilization does not produce huge imbalances
between the limiting nutrient and the other nutrients.
We can differentiate fertilizers using different criteria,
such as: (i) Simple or multi nutrient fertilizers, depending if
they are composed of one or more nutrients, (ii) Organic or
inorganic, and (iii) Fast or Slow release. The use of fertilizer
composed of one or more nutrients depends on the needs of
the soil. Generally, it is recommended to use multi nutrient
fertilizers. This is due to the fact that the increase of a single
nutrient ends up creating new limiting nutrients. The fast-
release fertilizers generate more pollution because they
escape rapidly from the area when the plants cannot absorb
them. Organic fertilizers commonly have slow release and
they are multi nutrient. In addition, the use of wastewater
sludge and compost of urban waste allows the recovery of
waste materials. Finally, the use of organic fertilizer and
water-saving politics have the potential to reduce the
emission of N2O (greenhouse gas) [4].
The use of sensors in crops has grown in the last years.
Different works have been developed, such as wireless
sensor networks for monitoring the state of the fruit, saving
water, detecting disease, etc. [5]. This new trend is called
precision
agriculture
and
involves
the
inclusion
of
monitoring
technology
in
agriculture
(sensors,
image
processing, etc.).
In this paper, we propose an inductive sensor to monitor
the use of organic fertilizer in irrigation. The selected
prototypes have been previously used to detect the illegal
dumping of wastewaters [6]. The proposed sensor is based
on two copper solenoid coils. One coil is powered by
alternative current and induces the other coil. We expect to
have a variation on the value of the induced voltage
according to the changes in the concentration of the organic
fertilizer. Our sensor is located in the pipes that distribute the
water in drip irrigation.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, we present the related works. The methodology used in
the experiment is presented in Section 3. The results of the
different prototypes are presented in Section 4. Finally,
Section 5 shows the conclusions and future works.

RELATED WORK
In this section, we show different related work, and we
explain the advantages of our system.
A solution for reducing the use of fertilizer is using a
smart fertilizer. Feng et al. [7] proposed a controlled/slow-
release fertilizer. This fertilizer is composed of polymer
brushes of poly (N, N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate).
Usually, slow-release fertilizers have increased discharge of
nutrients with temperature and pH. This smart fertilizer has a
slower release. A similar solution was proposed by Boli et al.
[8].
They
studied
the
use
of
slow-release
fertilizer
formulations basis of natural attapulgite, clay, ethylcellulose,
film,
and
sodium
carboxymethylcellu-lose/
hydroxyethylcellulose hydrogel. Their study concluded that
the use of this fertilizer reduces nutrient loss, improves the
use efficiency of water, and prolonges irrigation cycles.
However, temperature, pH, and other soil properties can
affect nutrient releasing. The paper indicated that the
evaluation of soil organic matter content, soil texture,
residual soil N, right irrigation strategies, and cropping
systems need to be developed for reducing fertilizer use.
The use of slow-release organic fertilizers is a partial
solution to the contamination problem. However, the farmers
still ignore the amount of fertilizer that should be contributed
to the field (except based on their own experience, without
following
technical
criteria).
To
improve
fertilization
following technical criteria, some authors propose the use of
sensors. Vijayakumar and Nelson Rosario [9] used different
sensors for monitoring the water and fertilizer need. They
used leaf wetness, soil moisture, soil pH, and atmospheric
pressure sensors connected to 2.40 Hz MICAz mote,
MDA300CA. The soil moisture sensor has been used for
monitoring the water needs of the crop. For tracking the
fertilizer, the system sends an SMS to the farmer with the pH
value and it selects the amount of fertilizer. Zhang et al. [10]
used the information of sensors in the crops and big data for
determining the needs of water and fertilizer. The system is
composed of 4 modules. The first one is the data acquisition
system, the second one is the transmission data, the third is
the big data layer, and finally, the fourth is the decision layer.
The data acquisition is divided into a manual and automatic
collection. The automatic collection is composed of a
weather, soil, and crop growth sensors system. The manual
collection used information about types of plants, the period
of seedling, etc. These data are sent to a database with
wireless technology. In the database, they are saved for
future decisions. In the decision layer, the data are processed
with irrigation and growing models for making decisions and
to the historical archive of the crop data.
The use of inductive sensors has been reported in
numerous scientific articles. Wood et al. [11] developed a
system to measure the salinity. The system is based on two
sensors: a temperature sensor, i.e., conductivity sensor, and
a microcontroller. The two sensors are controlled by an
Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) microcontroller that
saves the data on a flashcard and sends the data. The
conductivity sensor is composed of two coils in solenoid
form (a powered and an induced coil) covered with 1-
dodecanethiol protection against corrosion. The temperature
sensor is used to adjust the values of conductivity to salinity.
The maximum measure of the sensor is 67 g/l of table salt.
In other papers, Parra et al. [12] developed a system
based on two coils for monitoring the conductivity in
aquifers. They studied the different design of the coils that
can be summarized in (i) changes in the number of spires
maintaining the spires relationship. (ii) change the relation of
spires. (iii) changes in the wire diameter (iv) change in the
coil diameter. They concluded that the best prototype has 80
spires in the induced coil, 40 spires in the powered coil, a
copper diameter of 0.4 mm, and 25 mm of coil diameter.
Rocher et al. [13] demonstrate the use of coils for monitoring
fertigation in crops. They compared the induced voltage
caused by table salt and nitromagnesium (a fast release
fertilizer). The different prototypes are composed of two
coils (powered coil and induced coil) in a solenoid form.
They concluded that prototypes with a powered coil of 40
spires and 80 spires in the induced coil are the better
prototypes in the two studied salts. They found differences in
the induced voltage depending on the salt that causes the
conductivity. However, both papers did not study the use of
organic fertilizer. It has less conductivity than inorganic
salts, which can modify the behavior of the coil.
In these papers, we can observe the use of sensors based
on coils for monitoring the conductivity of the water. As the
inorganic fertilizer is composed of mineral salts, they
suppose an increase in water conductivity. However, the OF
is composed of organic components that provide less
conductivity than inorganic fertilizers. Therefore, it is
necessary to check if it is possible to measure the
concentration of OF by using coil-based sensors.
III.
TEST BENCH
In this section, we describe the materials used in the coils
as well as the methodology used.
We created the coils with a PVC pipe, 3mm of thickness,
and a diameter of 25mm. Moreover, the length of the PVC
tube is 10cm. The copper used is enameled copper of 0.4
mm. We selected prototypes based on 40 spires in the
Powered Coil (PC) and 80 spires in the Induced Coil (IC)
from the previous works [12] and [13]. The copper is located
on PVC pipe distributed in 2, 4, or 8 layers. The values of
turns, layer numbers, and photography of the different
prototypes are shown in Table I. Also, the copper was coiled
in the clockwise direction in each one of the prototypes. This
helps to maintain a similar basis for all prototypes and to
obtain more relevant data. We power the coil in a clockwise
direction, using the other end of the coil as a ground
reference with a voltage of 3.3 Vpp, and we measure the
induced voltage with an oscilloscope.
We have added a resistance of 47 Ohm in series to the
PC. The induced coil has a capacitor of 10 nF in parallel. The
model of the signal generator is AFG1022 [14], and the
oscilloscope is TBS1104 [15]. The conductivity of the
samples is measured with a conductivity model Basic 30
[16]. We tested it with concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10,
12.5, 15, 17.5, 20 g/l of organic fertilizer.

In all tests, we prepared 500 mL of the sample that was
introduced in a glass. The glass has a height of 16.2 cm and 8
cm of diameter. We used 6 out of 9 samples for calibrating
the sensor. The other 3 samples were used for verification of
the sensor functioning. In Figure 2, we can observe the
experiment being carried out.
The induced voltage measurements have been taken by
varying the value of the frequency in the signal generator.
They have been tested in a frequency range of 10 to 300 kHz
every 10 kHz. This process has been carried out for all the
samples we have mentioned above.
IV.
RESULTS
In this section, we show the obtained results of the
different concentrations of organic fertilizer. Firstly, we test
the prototype behavior in a specific spectrum of frequency.
Next, we do the calibration of the sensors to verify the best
R2 (similarity between the mathematical model and the
points we are trying to predict) with the obtained data. Then,
we analyze the precision and exactitude of the results.
Finally, we select the best prototype.
Figure 2. Experimental setup.
A. Prototype behavior
The first step is to analyze the response of the three
prototypes that we include in this test. Therefore, three
samples with different concentrations of OF are used. The
objective of this part of the experiment is to find the
Working Frequency (WF) of the sensors to use this WF for
the calibration. The WF is the frequency in which the
prototype has the maximum difference in the induced
voltage between the lowest and the highest concentrations of
the OF.
For this test, we used three samples of 0, 5, 20 g/l,
respectively. We have used a maximum concentration of
20g/l due to the fact that the level of fertilizers does not
usually exceed this threshold in the irrigation of the fields.
Besides, the conductivity of the samples has been measured
using the EC meter model Basic 30, which is a professional
conductimeter, to obtain the most exact values. The results
obtained with this device are 0.37, 1.13, and 6.14 mS/cm.
The obtained results with these prototypes are shown
below. Figure 3 represents the results of P1. We can see that
the range, in which the Magnetic Field (MF) generated by
the coil shows more significant interaction, is between 90
and 110 kHz. Even though the peak is found at 100 kHz, the
maximum difference of Inductive Voltage (Vout) between
the lowest and highest concentrations is obtained at 90 kHz.
Next, the behavior of P2 is displayed in Figure 4. According
to Figure 4, the most sensitive region of the MF is between
90 and 130 kHz, with a peak at 120 kHz. The most
significant change occurs at 110 kHz. Finally, in Figure 5,
we present the portion of the spectrum in which the P3 works
better. This range goes between 120 and 150 kHz. The peak
is located at 140 kHz, which is the working frequency.
In the case of P1 at the WF, the lowest Vout is related to
the smallest conductivity and the highest output with the
biggest value of conductivity. P2 shows the same behavior as
P1. Besides, P3 exhibits another way to work. In this case,
the lowest conductivity is related to the highest Vout in
Figure 5, and the lowest Vout is for the highest conductivity.

Figure 4. Representation of the frequency spectrum of P2.
Figure 5. Representation of the frequency spectrum of P3.
All the prototypes showed a very similar range in which
the generated MF and Vout are more sensitive to changes in
the conductivity of the environment. Nonetheless, the way in
which they respond to this change in the environment is
different between them.
It will be necessary for these prototypes to perform some
requirements in order to be selected as sensors:

The Vout obtained must be as high as possible,

The difference of Vout between the different quantities of
organic fertilizer must be high (IV difference),

The Vout for all tested dissolutions must be different, and

The working frequency must be as low as possible (At
smaller frequency cost decreases).
B. Calibration of prototypes
After scanning in a wide frequency spectrum, the results
of the peaks for P1, P2, P3 have been analyzed. The highest
difference of Vout between 0 and 20 g/l (IV difference)
indicates the WF for each prototype, as can be seen in Table
II. The three prototypes have been tested for their WF using
the Statgraphics program [17]. Statgraphics is used to obtain
the mathematical model for all the prototypes and observe
how these adapt to the collected data. In addition, we use this
program to calculate the confidence interval and the
prediction interval.
The calibration of P1 is reflected in Figure 6. The best
model which fits with the experimental points is the potential
model. Besides, it has been realized the confidence interval
and the prediction interval of the model that shows a good
correlation between the Vout and the conductivity. Likewise,
the model of P2 has been obtained. This is represented as a
potential model (Figure 7). In this case, the confidence
interval and the prediction interval are more separated from
the model that describes the lowest correlation of the values
than in the P1. Finally, the model of P3 is shown in Figure 8.
The best fit model is an exponential model. In this prototype,
the values of the output voltage decrease with the increase of
the conductivity. The prediction interval and the confidence
interval are more tithed than in the P2 ,but less than in the
P1, although the correlation of the experiment point is
excellent.
The
Vout
of
the
sensors
is
compared
with
the
conductivity of the different concentrations of organic
fertilizers. The mathematical models of the three kinds of
prototypes are shown in (1)-(3).

The R2 of the models are 0.9937, 0.9852, and 0.9923 for

C. Accuracy of the values
The last step is to obtain the verification of the prototypes
P2 and P3. P1 has not been estimated because the difference
of Vout between the lowest and highest concentration is
under 1V. To obtain these results, we use the data of Vout
and conductivity of our measurements on new samples of
5g/l, 10 g/l, and 15 g/l.
The values of Real Voltage (RV) and Model Voltage
(MV) for P2 and P3 are represented in Table III. The RV is
the Vout that was measured in the laboratory. Moreover, MV
is the theoretical value according to the model of (2) for P2
and (3) for P3.
The absolute error and the relative error are calculated
and represented in Table III. On the one hand, the absolute
error is the difference between the Real voltage and the
Model voltage. On the other hand, the relative error is the
absolute value divided by the real value (in the two cases, it
can be a positive or a negative value).
Our results indicated that P2 has 0.03 V of absolute error
and 0.32 V of relative error. Meanwhile, P3 has 0.01 V and
0.22 V of absolute and relative error. As can be seen, the
highest errors are found in P2, where the lowest error is in
P3. This shows that P3 has the most significant accuracy of
the values, unlike P2, which has the lowest accuracy.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented an inductive sensor for
monitoring OF in agriculture. The obtained parameters can
be used to control the amount of OF that the irrigation water
has.

TABLE III. ACCURACY OF THE VALUES
After we performed the measurements, we determined
that the highest Vout is for P2, which shows a value of 9.81
V in the WF. P1 and P3 obtained 6.53 V and 7.65 V.
Moreover, the biggest difference between 0 and 20g/l is
given in P3, with 1.47V. In P1 and P2, the obtained results
are 0.39 V and 1.41 V. Correspondingly, the lowest working
frequency is presented in P1 in the 90 kHz, while the WF of
P2 and P3 were 110 kHz and 140 kHz. Observing the
absolute and relative error, the best accuracy is for P3,
followed by P2.
Finally, we choose P3 as the best prototype to measure
OF. Although the results of P1 are right, the difference
between different concentration is very low.
In future works, we are going to study the effect of the
extreme temperatures on the values of the measures.
Furthermore, tests with different kinds of organic fertilizers
will done.

Abstract—This paper discusses an application of a portable
electronic nose based on an array consisting of 8 piezoelectric
sensors with nanostructured solid-state coatings to detect
volatile biomolecules secreted by nasal mucus and skin. A
fundamentally
new
approach
is
proposed
for
a
quick
assessment of the status of the human body as a whole (normal,
stress, inflammation) and the work of individual systems
(reproductive, endocrine, digestive), based on the results of the
assessment of the qualitative and quantitative composition of
the gas mixture of biomolecules secreted by the skin in the
Zakharyin-Ged zone. An algorithm is proposed for reading
and
visualizing
signals
from
an
array
of
sensors
understandable to any user. Also, a portable electronic nose
was applied in the veterinary field for assessment of the health
status of calves’ respiratory system. Unlike the traditional
approach in diagnostics using sensor array, one sample of
nasal mucus was monitored for 5-9 hours with an interval of 2-
3 hours. The integral analytical signal of sensors, in that case,
was connected to the microbiological contamination of the
sample
or
its
absence.
The
speed
and

of
measurement using an electronic nose with nanostructured
piezoelectric sensors allow painlessly scanning the body for
metabolic disturbances and estimating the presence of certain
pathologies as well as the effectiveness of treatment.

I. INTRODUCTION
Biosamples are complex objects to analyze. The problem
of their study consists not only in the absence of a constant
composition, but also in its almost instantaneous change
when substances are excreted from the sample. Despite the
emergence in recent years of new methods for the analysis
and study of biostructures at the level of individual cells, the
scheme still remains traditional: selection of biomaterial,
sample preparation and detection of target components. The
use of highly selective and effective methods of analysis (gas
chromatography-mass
spectrometry,
high-pressure
liquid
chromatography, etc.) suggests a special sample preparation,
which can change the natural profile of the biosamples. The
method of sample preparation is determined by the purpose
of the analysis, but the integrity of the biological object is
lost. Also, the results obtained by advanced analysis methods
do not reflect the complex structure and behavior of a
biological object. Therefore, recently, in the analysis of
complex living objects (food, environmental objects, human
and
animal
biosamples),
complex
methods
with
a
multivariate analytical signal have been used more often.
Such methods, by their methodology, include systems of
artificial tongues, noses, eyes [1]. The undoubted advantage
of highly sensitive sensor systems with the rapid response is
the ability to monitor the state of small volumes and masses
of biological samples in a fairly short time (from 2 to 9
hours). Given the lack of their contact with the environment
(in
vitro),
primarily
with
oxygen,
small
volumes
of
biosamples, which means fast processes of changing their
properties,
open
up
a
unique
opportunity
to
obtain
information about the status of the studied object, even if the
specific methods for determining individual substances or
laboratory
indicators
(primarily
microbiological)
are
unavailable.
A possible approach for assessing the status of the body
in the absence of biomaterial selection is to analyze the
chemical composition of the gas, sweat of the skin in the
zones of Zakharyin-Ged. Earlier, the presence of redness,
peeling, rash, temperature changes in these areas was widely
used as an additional parameter to confirm the malfunction
of organs corresponding to these zones. The detection limits
of modern methods of analysis, the complexity of the
instrumentation of the most sensitive methods do not allow
non-invasive
scanning
and
determining
the
chemical
composition of the gas phase of secretions from the skin.
Therefore, the creation of an integrated system for scanning a

volatile metabolome [10] using a device with a sensitive
detection from biomolecules of normal and disordered
metabolism, inflammation, to microbial metabolites is actual
for now.
There are some state-of-the-art approaches, including
portable devices, for assessing the state of the body using
electronic noses and various data processing methods: for
exhaled breath air [2][4], for the analysis of biomaterials
(blood, urine, secrets of the endocrine glands, etc.) [5][7].
Different approaches for assessment of health status by skin
based on using electrochemical or optical methods are
proposed in [8][9]. The authors did not find in the literature
similar hardware solutions about the development of an
electronic nose for diagnosing human health by volatile
metabolites secreted by the skin.
The purpose of this paper is the development and
application of a new mobile device based on piezoelectric
sensors (portable electronic nose) for assessing the health
status of organs and systems of humans and animals by
analyzing the volatile metabolome.
We will demonstrate our approach in two ways: 1)
analysis of nasal mucus samples of calves for the diagnosis
of respiratory diseases and 2) characterizing of the health
status of humans by skin odor in the Zakharyin-Ged zones.
In Section 2, the features of the experiment, description
of biosamples and methods of analysis are presented. Section
3 contains technical characteristics of the proposed device,
characteristics of the used sensors and their coatings, and a
description of the procedure for obtaining and recording of
output data of the sensor array. In Section 4, we show the
results of the application of the proposed portable electronic
nose (e-nose) for solving diagnostic problems according to
the purpose of the work. Section 5 is devoted to conclusions
and perspective of development.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A.
Diagnosis of Respiratory Diseases in Calves
17 samples of nasal mucus from calves (10-20 days of
life) both with signs of respiratory system damage and
conditionally healthy were analyzed. A sampling of nasal
mucus was carried out with sterile cotton swabs in individual
sterile containers. The time from sampling to analyzing on e-
nose was taken into account.
All calves were clinically studied in detail using a point
system (WI score) developed at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison (USA) [11] with mandatory laboratory control at
the All-Russian Scientific Research Veterinary Institute of
Pathology, Pharmacology and Therapy: bacteriological and
molecular

for
infectious rhinotracheitis, parainfluenza-3, viral diarrhea-
disease cattle mucous membranes, rotavirus, adenovirus,

pathogenic
mycoplasmas
(M.

M.
bovirhinis), hematological indicators of inflammation in the
blood
(leukogram,

were
determined.
For
the
isolation
of

and
typing
of
microorganisms, meat and peptone broth and agar, milk salt,
enterococcal agar, Endo medium, blood agar, glucose-serum
broth and agar produced by NICF (St. Petersburg, Russia)
were used. The isolated Escherichia coli were typed in an
agglutination reaction using O-serums.
B. Characterizing the Some Deviation from Normal Status
by Human Skin Odor
The area of the forearm of human skin was chosen to
analyze the volatile metabolome by a portable electronic
nose. Over 100 conditionally healthy volunteers took part in
the investigation duration for 2 years. The volunteers
periodically
were
clinically
(visits
to
physicians)
and
laboratory (general analysis of blood, urine, biochemical
analysis of blood (glucose, cholesterol, some hormones))
tested to control health status. For conditionally healthy
volunteers, the results of laboratory tests corresponded to the
norm, and the symptoms did not match with clinically
significant for illness. Clinically not diagnosed conditions,
so-called descriptive states (tiredness, excitement, agitation,
stress, lack of sleep, spasm, pain), were recorded from the
words of the volunteers.
III. DESCRIPTION OF PORTABLE E-NOSE AND
MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE
A.
Making of Piezoelectric Sensors
We used piezoelectric quartz resonators (PQR) with a
natural frequency of 14 MHz with an established linear
response with a film mass on its electrodes up to 20 μg/cm2.
The array contained 8 piezoelectric sensors with electrodes
covered by films of carbon nanomaterial, biohydroxyapatite,
zirconium salts of different mass (1-5 μg) (NANO-BIO 
array).
1)
Characteristics of the Used Sorbents
Hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH was obtained by the sol-
gel method developed at Nizhny Novgorod State University
named after N.I. Lobachevsky and optimized by us to obtain
nanostructured coatings with good sorption properties.
The reaction was carried out according to the following
equation:
5Ca(NO3)2·4H2O + 3H3PO4 +10NaOH → Ca5(PO4)3OH +
10NaNO3 + 29H2O
To a solution of calcium nitrate (2 mol/dm3) prepared
from Ca(NO3)2·4H2O in bidistilled water has added a
solution of H3PO4 in the amount necessary to maintain the
ratio Ca/P = 5/3. The resulting solution was thermostated for
one hour at 37 °C, then its pH was adjusted to 7-8 using a
NaOH solution with a concentration of 2 mol/dm3. At pH =
4, a Ca5(PO4)3OH sol began to form. The reaction mixture
was kept at this temperature for 1 hour. Then, the resulting
gel was centrifuged and dried in air. The obtained sorbent
can be stored for at least 0.5 years in airtight conditions.
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes were obtained by gas-phase
chemical deposition during ethanol pyrolysis. Nickel was
used as a catalyst; the temperature of deposition was 450-
500
°C.
Then
nanotubes
were
washed
with
HNO3
concentrated (Institute for Extra Pure Materials of the
Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka). The solvent

for the suspension of hydroxyapatite and carbon nanotubes
was
chloroform.
Zirconium
nitrate
(ZrO(NO3)2•2H2O),
(chemically pure) was obtained from aqueous solutions
containing zirconium and nitrate ions (Reachem, Russia).
The solvent for the suspension of zirconium nitrate was
acetone. These sorbents are selective and sensitive to
volatile metabolites of bacteria and inflammation according
to the results of a preliminary experiment [12].
2)
The Method of Forming Films on the Surface of the
Piezoelectric Quartz Resonator
To change and control the sensitivity and selectivity of
micro-weighing of vapors of organic substances, thin films
were uniformly deposited to the electrodes of piezoelectric
quartz resonators, fat-free with acetone or chloroform, by
immersion in solutions of sorbents suspended by ultrasound.
The hydroxyapatite, as well as carbon nanotubes and
zirconium nitrate, formed the sensors using the following
procedure:
Step 1 – the measurement of the initial oscillation
frequency of the piezoelectric resonator (10 or 14 MHz) F0,
Hz with an accurate record, for example, 9999280 Hz;
Step 2 – suspension was prepared in the beaker as
dissolution of sorbent (0.5 g) in 10 ml of solvent;
Step 3 – processing in an ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes
at a power of 90 W;
Step 4 – exposure of the quartz piezoelectric resonator in
suspension for 15 s;
Step 5 – drying the coating in an oven (40 minutes at a
temperature from 50 ° C) in the holder vertically;
Step 6 – the measurement of the oscillation frequency of
the sensor, calculation of the coating mass (Δm) according
to the Sauerbrey equation [13]:
(1)
where ΔF is the change in the oscillation frequency of the
quartz plate of the resonator after film deposition and
removal of an unbound solvent, MHz;
2.27•10-6 – calibration constant of piezoelectric quartz
resonator at normal condition, cm2/g;
F0 — base oscillation frequency of the PQR, MHz;
0.2 – the area of electrodes of PQR, cm2.
B.
Characteristic of Portable E-nose
The portable device for diagnosing the status of humans
and animals is a miniature case, consisting of two functional
parts (Figure 1): head 1 and the protective part of the body
6, a microprocessor 2 with terminals for sensor mount
sockets, a block for fixing and transmitting information 3 to
the recording device of any type (laptop, tablet, PC); the
sockets are located in the cover 4, into which removable
sensors 5 are mounted on the outside, separated from the
environment by the protective part of the body 6, which is
tightly attached to the head 1. Optionally e-nose is
supplemented by an internal gas-permeable gasket 7, which
separates the sensor region and the free air region of the
body 6.
Figure 1.
General view of the 3D model of the portable e-nose for
diagnostics: 1 – head; 2 – microprocessor with terminals for sensor mount
sockets; 3 – block recording and transmitting information to a recording
device of any type; 4 – cover; 5 – removable sensors; 6 – protective part of
the body; 7 – internal gas-permeable gasket; 8 – nozzles; 9 – power supply
from the electricity; 10 – removable battery.
To reduce interfering factors (external fluctuation in
airflow, temperature, air composition in the near-sensor
space), protective nozzles of various types 8 from inert
materials (fluoroplastic) are used in accordance with the
nature of the analyzed sample. The e-nose is powered by
either an electronic device, with which is combined via a
USB cable, either from electricity 9 or a removable battery
10.
The developed portable device is an electronically
counting frequency meter with 8 channels for measuring the
oscillation frequency of BAW-type piezoelectric quartz
resonators with a base oscillation frequency of 5 to 20 MHz
with a resolution of 1 Hz and a time interval (step) of 1
second. The electronic counting frequency meter is switched
on in the network (220 V); it warms up for 10-15 minutes.
In this case, to reduce measurement errors, the sensors
should be in the device. But their subsequent inclusion is
also possible. It takes about 5-10 minutes to stabilize the
baseline of the oscillation frequency of the quartz plate.
To
simultaneously
record
(read)
the
oscillation
frequency of each sensor independently of each other every
second for a certain time interval (from 1 s to a maximum of
6000 s), the device is connected to a computer via USB
cable, and other connection options are possible (via Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth).

a voltage of 220 ± 22 V and a frequency of 50 ± 0.5
Hz.


C. Specification of Software
The responses are recorded in the instrument software,
which not only saves the current measurement but also
converts it into analytical information
a change in the
oscillation frequency of each resonator individually without
load or with load at each measurement moment relative to
the starting point of measurement (-ΔF, Hz). The full output
curve is displayed in the form of a set of chronograms for all
resonators installed in the e-nose (Figure 2). During the
interaction of vapors with the surface of the piezoelectric
sensors, sorption occurs on the films or electrodes, as a result
of which the frequency changes. Individual colors reflect a
change in time of the base oscillation frequency of each of
the 8 piezoelectric sensors (Figure 2). In the developed
software based on chronograms, the “visual print” is
constructed using different algorithms depending on the
purpose of analysis. The quantitative characteristic of “visual
prints”, therefore, the total amount of volatile substances
excreted by samples and sorbed by piezoelectric sensors, is
the area of “visual print” (Sv.p., Hz´s). The area of “visual
print” is calculated in software as a sum of definite integrals

samples [14] or to describe additional analytical information
about sample characteristics.
D. Technique of Measurement
The gas phases over nasal mucus samples were studied
with the front input method into the detection cell. For
analyzing the volatile substances excreted by the skin on the
forearm area (20 cm2) the open detection cell of device
contacted with this area. The registration time of the sorption
of volatile substances excreted by the skin and nasal mucus
was 80 s, the registration of desorption was 120 s. Thus, the
full time of one measurement was 200 s.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Diagnosis of Respiratory Diseases in Calves
Based on the results of clinical studies, the determination
of hematological and biochemical markers of inflammation
(leukocytosis, an increase in the concentration of haptoglobin
in the blood serum), pathogens of viral and bacterial
infections accompanied by damage to the respiratory system
of calves, we selected three groups: “healthy respiratory
system” (n=4), “with the subclinical course of respiratory
diseases” (n=8), “early signs of respiratory disease” (n=5).
A natural change in the composition of the mucus taken
at a weekly interval can reflect only significant changes in
the condition - for example, a vivid manifestation of the
inflammatory process. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches to
the diagnosis of respiratory diseases by one measurement of
biosamples [5-7], for the first time, it has been proposed
monitoring one sample for 5-9 hours with an interval of 2-3
hours. It allows recording changes in the state at the micro-
level associated with microbiological contamination of the
sample or its absence. The areas of “visual prints” were
calculated for all samples of nasal mucus. Early it was shown
that the values of the area of “visual prints” correlate with
biochemical indicators of inflammation characterizing the
disease of respiratory organs in calves [15].
All results of one-day monitoring of nasal mucus
biosamples can be divided into three groups (Figure 3).
1) Positive (increasing) dynamics of changes in the value
of the integral analytical signal of the sensor array (area of
“visual print”) - indicates the destruction of nasal mucus and
production of a large number of volatile compounds
including microorganisms metabolites.
2) The negative (decreasing) dynamics of the change in
the value of the analytical signal of the sensor array indicates
the decreasing of volatile substances excreted from nasal
mucus due to increasing of its viscosity by the high level of
proteins, mucin, which is observed in the acute phase of
respiratory disease [16].

3) The almost constant value of the integral signal from
the array of sensors, which is observed at the first sign of
respiratory disease (subclinical course), indicates that the
excretion of substances at the destruction of nasal mucus and
the production of metabolites by microorganisms are not so
active. If one takes another sample of nasal mucus from an
animal with the subclinical course of the respiratory disease
within 5 minutes after the first selection, then the time
dependence of area of “visual print” for this sample will be
like for conditionally healthy (curve 1, Figure 3). It is in
good agreement with the data on the formation of local
protection of the respiratory tract of calves [16]. Thus,
several measurements of one biosample during the day allow
easy clarifying the diagnosis without multivariate analysis of
sensor signals unlike modern approaches [3][5].
B.
Characterizing the Some Deviation from Normal Health
Status by Human Skin Odor
A forearm zone of skin was chosen for scanning the
health status of the whole organism according to information
about the diagnostic significance of the Zakharyin-Ged zone.
The primary database contained the responses of 8
sensors in 200 seconds of measurement (1590-1600 signals).
Based on the analysis of the skin odor of 100 volunteers in
various states according to their words and the results of
laboratory tests, a primary algorithm of “visual print”
construction has been developed for linking the features of
the forms of “visual prints” with the human condition and
possible causes of deviation (Table 1, Figure 4). The
proposed algorithm is different from the traditional approach
to visualize the sensor signals, used in the state-of-the-art
methods [3]. Moreover, such visualization is simpler and
clearer for the user.

Statistically significant typical changes in the shape of the
integral signals of the sensor array of the portable e-nose for different
conditions of one person (for left forearm – the blue color and for right –
red color).
Figure 4 shows the comparison of “visual prints” forms
for left and right hands, which used for visual assessment of
descriptive states. As a result, statistically reliable responses
and smell trace forms were determined, what correspond to
the physically normal functioning of the body (norm), stress,
tiredness, inflammation, headache, and weakness, in total no
less than 17 states (some of them are shown in Figure 4).
This is more than in other research [4][5]. Besides, reference
limits for the degree of its severity have been established for
each state, for example, the low level of tiredness, the middle
level of tiredness, the high level of tiredness and the critical
level of tiredness. It is established that the geometric shape
of the “visual print” is strictly individual for each person and
the calculated parameters (A(i/j)) – for health status (Figure
4, Table 2). The shape of “visual print” is influenced to a
greater extent by the health of the body, by the psycho-
emotional state during measurement, by gender, and to a
lesser extent by age. If we normalize for one person the

The electronic nose was trained by 45 individual
substances of normal and pathogenic metabolism: C1-C5
alcohols, ketones, C5-C7 cyclic ketones, aldehydes, N-, S-
containing aldehydes, C1-C5 carboxylic acids; primary,
tertiary, cyclic amines, O-containing amines. Therefore, it is
possible to evaluate the appearance of these substances in the
descriptive states (Table 2). Thereby, using portable e-nose
for

allows
determining the diverse variation in health status, including
the descriptive states, the presence of 45 individual volatile
substances at ppm-ppb level [14] in comparison with state-
of-the-art methods [4][5][8][9].
For the convenience of deciding the health status of the
organism, the state sphere is constructed using parameters
A(i/j) (Figure 5), while the color of the sector corresponding
to a certain parameter, which is determined by its numerical
value in Table 2.
Figure 5.
Example of the sphere for human health status on parameter
A(i/j) in the dialogue window of the software.
The greener the sectors in the health status sphere, the
closer it is to normal. For instance, in Figure 5 the value of
parameter A(2/6) is in the red zone accordingly to the results
of clinical and laboratory tests which are confirmed as an
inflammatory process in the digestive and respiratory tracts.
Thus, according to the parameters of sensor signals, one can
easily and quickly obtain extended information about the
work of both individual organs and the deviation of the
health status from the average norm.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
According to the responses of the electronic nose, when
monitoring biosamples of nasal mucus from 17 calves during
5-9 hours, with an interval of 2-3 hours, it is possible to
assess changes in the qualitative composition of biosamples
gas phase in an atraumatic way, in place.
For the first time, a fundamentally new approach is
proposed for a quick assessment of the health status of the
human body as a whole (normal, stress, inflammation) and
the work of individual systems (reproductive, endocrine,

digestive), based on the results of an integrated assessment of
the qualitative and quantitative composition of the gas
mixture of biomolecules secreted by the skin in the
Zakharyin-Ged zone.
The correct interpretation and prediction of the status of
biosamples and a person’s state have been proved by
traditional diagnostic and analysis methods (leukogram,
biochemical, microbiological, molecular genetic analysis).
An algorithm is proposed for reading and visualizing signals
from an array of sensors understandable to any user. More
information about data processing for e-nose implementation
will be in this paper [17].
The time of one analysis of volatile substances excreted
by the biosamples or skin using portable e-nose, including
visualization and processing, is up to 5 min, which is faster
than that described in works [2][5] and without any sample
preparation unlike other modern research works [2][7][8].
We believe that the approach proposed in this work for
the analysis by sensor array is appropriate for other
biosamples, such as blood, cervical mucus, exhaled breath

Abstract—Detecting and mapping obstacles is an important com-
ponent in mobile robots. In this paper, we use only an economic
2D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor to make a
3D map of the scene, classifying the scanned data into ground,
obstacles and potholes. To do this, the points from the LiDAR
are clustered in segments, and then they are classiﬁed depending
of their height. The method successfully classiﬁes in low dynamic
structured environments, and generates compact 3D map that
represents the scene with a few points.
Keywords–Mobile robots; LiDAR; 3D map; Low-cost.
I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we present a novel method to generate a 3D
map from the data of a 2D downward looking LiDAR. This
map has enough information to identify the ground, obstacles
and potholes, but it is also cost efﬁcient in terms of memory.
This information will help the robot to decide where it can
go and where not. The importance of this method is that only
a low-cost sensor is used, so economic mobile robots can be
produced in the future.
To generate the map, each scan is segmented into lines and
then they are classiﬁed as ground, obstacle or pothole using
the line height. Therefore, the map is made up of few points
which represent the lines.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes work that is related to this research. Section III des-
cribes the algorithm that does the detection and classiﬁcation
of the lines. Section IV presents the experimental results of this
method. Finally, in Section V, the conclusions are exposed and
future work lines are introduced.
II. RELATED WORK
The 2D LiDAR sensor can be used in two ways. On
the one hand, it can be placed horizontally, so the sensor
only detects obstacles with the same height as the sensor or
higher. On the other hand, the sensor can be put downward
looking, enabling the detection of short obstacles and potholes.
However, this way has more difﬁculty to detect dynamic
objects as a drawback. In the last case, the scanned points
can be divided in segments searching consecutive points with
a difference in height greater that the a given threshold [1].
From this division, the segments can be classiﬁed into ground,
obstacles or potholes.
Recently, methods based on neuronal networks have been
used to classify the data from LiDAR sensors. Wang et al. [2]
propose the use of a 3D LiDAR and a camera to determine the
class of the points by projecting the points in the image and
classifying the objects of the image using a You Only Look
Once (YOLO) network. In a different way, VoxelNet [3] is
a neural network that uses the points as input and classiﬁes
them by dividing the point cloud in uniform voxels. Kruˇzi´c et
al. [4] use the data from a 2D LiDAR in networks trained by
simulation to avoid collisions. In this case, it is not used for
the classiﬁcation, but to directly avoid the obstacles.
In 2D images, the optical ﬂow has been used to determine
dynamic objects by analysing the movement of the point
between frames. This method can be applied to the points
scanned by a LiDAR. In the case of 2D LiDAR placed
horizontally, the method can be used to detect and track the
trajectory of dynamic objects [5]. By using multiple sensors,
the system is more robust and safe. This method is difﬁcult to
apply in a downward looking LiDAR in movement because the
sensor captures different points constantly. To determine the
optical ﬂow in 3D LiDAR, Vaquero et al. [6] have proposed
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which obtains the
optical ﬂow from the data of the sensor.
III. METHODOLOGY
In this research, the acquisition of the data from the
LiDAR, the creation of the 3D map and the detection of
obstacles are implemented using Robotic Operative System
(ROS) nodes. This makes it possible to obtain a modular
software that can be easily customized for other mobile robots
with other features and sensors.
Next, we explain how the data is obtained and is trans-
formed into a point cloud in a global coordinate system.
Then, the line detection will be explained, and how the lines
are added to the map. At the end of the section, the line
classiﬁcation will be presented.
A. Data acquisition
In this research, the Hokuyo UBG-04LX-F01 sensor, a 2D
LiDAR sensor, has been used. Since the objective is to detect

obstacles or potholes in the ground, the sensor is placed with
an inclination of 15o with respect to the horizontal axis. Data
needs to be obtained from approximately 2 meters in front of
the robot so that it has enough time to change the trajectory, a
sufﬁcient distance if the maximum speed is considered 1 m/s.
With the distance and the inclination, it was determined that
the sensor has to be placed at a height of 55 cm. Besides,
higher heights were tried, but higher the sensor is placed, the
more noise it is seen in the data, so the previous height was
chosen.
The Hokuyo sensor reads the distances in a range of 270o.
To use the sensor in ROS, the node urg node was used with
a median ﬁlter of 5 samples to reduce the noise in the data.
B. Point cloud map
The data is represented in a 3D map where the origin
of coordinates of the global axis are in the ground. At the
start of the program, they are just below the sensor. The
global and local axis are represented in Figure 1. Next, the
transformation of the scanned points from local axis to global
will be explained.
Figure 1. Global and local coordinates systems.
First, the obtained data is transformed to a point cloud. It
is a simple transformation from polar coordinates to Cartesian.
Then, a rotation in the Y axis of α degrees and a translation
in the Z axis of h meters are made. With this, the height
and inclination of the sensor are taken into account. In our
case, α = 15o and h = 0.55. So, the following transformation
matrix is applied to every point:


0

0

−sen(α)

cos(α)



Finally, another transformation is made to obtain the points
in the global coordinate system. For this purpose, the robot’s
position is obtained from a message, which is published from
other nodes of ROS, like an odometry node. The robot’s
position is represented by the values x, y y z; and the
orientation is determined by a quaternion Q = [q1, q2, q3, q0].
So, the transformation matrix is:


1 − 2q22 − 2q32
2q1q2 + 2q0q3
2q1q3 − 2q0q2


C. Line detection
To detect the obstacles, the point cloud will be segmented
in lines, which will be classiﬁed as ground or obstacle. A
threshold δ around the ﬁrst point of the line will determine if
a point belongs to the line or not. If the distance in Z axis
between the ﬁrst point and the new point is lower than δ, then
the point belongs to the line. This is done because big changes
in this axis means the existence of an obstacle or pothole.
Furthermore, it should be considered the distance between
points, because if the sensor does not detect points in a zone,
there will be big distances between points. For this reason,
the euclidean distance between consecutive points cannot be
greater than a maximum distance d. Both conditions are
represented in 2D in Figure 2. In addition, a minimum number
of points n is needed to consider a line. With this, the number
of little lines is reduced.
Figure 2. Diagram of the detection of lines.
Then, the lines are reﬁned because there are a lot of lines
that were segmented because of the height difference with the
ﬁrst point. This occurs frequently in the lateral walls.
If the normalized vector from the ﬁrst point to the last point
of a line is equal to the normalized vector of the next line and
to the vector from the ﬁrst point of the ﬁrst line to the last
point of the second line, both lines are grouped into one line
because they belong to the same straight. In Figure 3, these
vectors and the result of the reﬁnement can be observed. In
this reﬁnement, a slight error γ in the equality of vectors is
allowed. The different parameters of the detection of lines will
be determined during the experimentation.
D. Map of lines
The map of the segmented lines has been divided into
cells called submaps. The submaps will have the lines that
are between the limits in the X and Y axis. So, the map
will be a vector of submaps that will add dynamically new
submaps when they are needed. This allows to reduce the
time of computation in different functions because it is not
necessary to search in all the lines of the map. When a line is
added to the map, Figure 4 is used.
The lines are deﬁned by two points, the ﬁrst and the last.
Firstly, we search the submap where the ﬁrst point is. If it does

end
not exist in the map, a new submap is created and it is added
to the vector. Then, the submap is updated. In this function,
the nearest line to the new one is searched. If the distance is
smaller than a threshold, then the old line is replaced by the
new one. Otherwise, the line is added to the submap. Doing
this, the submap doesn’t accumulate lines that were detected,
saving the most recent information.
Lastly, we check if the last point of the line is in the same
submap. If it is in another, the other submap is also updated
so that the line is considered in searches in both submaps.
Furthermore, in this last case, it is possible that the line goes
through a third submap (when the line is near the corners of
submaps).
The size of the submaps is customizable. In this research,
it has been decided to use square submaps with the side of
10 m. It is considered large enough that there will not be an
excessive number of submaps and also small enough that the
search of lines is done in the required time. Moreover, as the
sensor has a range of 4 meters, a line can be in a maximum
of three sub-maps of this size.
E. Line classiﬁcation
The lines are classiﬁed depending on the mean heigh of
the line. If the height is in a threshold ζ around the actual
height of the robot, the line is considered as ground. If the
height is greater, the line is classiﬁed as obstacle, otherwise
the line is a pothole. The classiﬁcation is done continuously
because, depending the height of the robot, some lines that
were classiﬁed as obstacles can be ground, like on the ramps
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, the results will be shown. During the
experimentation, a mobile robot was not used, the sensor was
moved manually and a ROS node changed the position of the
X axis constantly.
In Table I, the values of the different parameters are shown.
In this research, the parameter settings indicated in Table I
produced good results.

In the visualization of the results, the ground lines are
represented in green, the obstacles in red and the potholes
in yellow. In Figure 5, the generated lines can be compared
with the point cloud of the scene. There were not obstacles,
so the ground and the walls were detected.
During the experimentation, a video was also recorded.
The detected lines can be projected in the video to see the
correspondences of the lines with the real world. In Figure 6,
the projection in a scene with obstacles can be observed.
The detection of potholes can be observed in Figure 7. The
scene shows a ﬂight of stairs from the top,, but there was not
enough space to detect the ﬁrst steps, so the potholes have to
be seen from far. However, in the absence of ground lines, the
robot should avoid the pothole.

Table II shows the results of the line classiﬁcation in ap-
proximately 7 minutes of experiments. The ground sometimes
is confused with potholes due to the sensor error. Also, it can
be observed that there are many obstacle’s lines, because there
is an oversegmentation in the obstacles. The tests were done
in an indoor environment, so there were no potholes, except
in the case of Figure 7.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
To conclude, we have presented a method that segments the
data of a 2D LiDAR sensor in lines and classiﬁes them. We

demonstrated that this approach detects correctly the obstacles
and potholes in a structural environment. However, the point
cloud is segmented in more lines than necessary, but it could
be improved changing the parameter of line reﬁnement.The al-
gorithm is less restrictive when grouping lines if the parameter
value is higher.
Moreover, it is necessary to address the issue of dynamic
objects in future works, analysing the movement in the lines. In
the great majority of scenes, there are some dynamic changes
that should be considered to improve the control of the robot.

INTRODUCTION
To realize the early detection of lung cancer via e-nose,
sensors with high response to low concentrations of Volatile
Organic Compounds (VOCs) biomarkers are necessary.
Metal oxide sensor is a good candidate for the sensors in e-
nose [1][2]. Isopropanol is one of the important biomarkers
of lung cancer. The concentration of isopropanol in the
breath of lung cancer patients can come up to over 270 ppb,
with an average concentration of 438 ppb [3]. In this work,
we present a sensor that can detect ppb level isopropanol as
low as to 250 ppb with good stability in humidity.
In Section Ⅱ, we will introduce the method we use to
synthesize the sensing materials, characterizing the as-
synthesized powders and making the sensing test. In Section
Ⅲ, the results of characterization and sensing test are shown.
We conclude our work in Section IV.
II.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The ZnO nanoneedles are synthesized via a simple
hydrothermal method. 3×10-3 mol of Zn(NO3)•2H2O were
dissolved into 44 ml of deionized water. Meanwhile, 1 g of
Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB) was dissolved
in 22 ml of ethanol. After that, 3×10-2 mol of NaOH was
added into the Zn(NO3)2 solution, then the two different
solutions were mixed, followed with the addition of 10 ml
ethylenediamine. The solution was treated at 100oC for 2 h in
an oven. The obtained powder was washed and dried in an
oven overnight. To prepare the Fe-doped ZnO needles,
Fe(NO3)3 solutions with different concentrations were slowly
added into the Zn(NO3)2 solution before the addition of
NaOH. The doping contents of Fe were 1%, 3% and 5% by
atom ratio, which are written as 1 at%, 3 at% and 5 at% Fe-
ZnO. The sensors are prepared on alumina substrate with
gold interdigitated electrodes by spraying.
The
as-synthesized
powders
are
characterized
by
Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) [4], Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) [5] and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
[6]. The gas sensing test is carried out in a home-made
system. The gas flow is controlled at 1 L/min by 3 flow
meters. Before the sensing test, all the sensors were pre-
heated at 350oC for 1 week. The response of the sensors was
defined as S=(Ra-Rg)/Rg. In the equation, S refers to the
response of the sensor, Ra represents the electrical resistance

The response and recovery time were respectively defined as
the time needed to reach 90% of the maximum response and
the time needed to recover to 110% of the baseline.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD of the samples indicated that all the samples
are ZnO or Fe-doped ZnO without any other impurities. The
main peak of Fe-ZnO has a small shifting to the left with the
increase of the amount of Fe, indicating that the Fe3+ was
doped into the ZnO. The SEM picture of pure and different
Fe-doped ZnO are shown in Figure 1. All the samples have
needle like nanostructure. The Fe doping changed the
structure of ZnO, making the needles become smaller.

Fig. 2 (a) and (b) exhibited the resistance change and gas
sensing performance of Fe-ZnO to different concentrations
of isopropanol at 275oC with 50% Relative Humidity (RH).
The resistance of the four sensors decreased significantly
with the presence of isopropanol, which indicated that the
Fe-doped ZnO remains n-type. The response of 5 at% Fe-
doped
ZnO
nanoneedles
can
reach
23.6
when
the
concentration
of
isopropanol
is
5
ppm.
When
the
concentration of isopropanol decreased to 250 ppb, the
response still can reach around 4.7. The response and
recovery time of 5 at% Fe-doped ZnO to 5 ppm ZnO is
calculated as 51 s and 762 s respectively. Fig. 2 (c) shows the
response to 5 ppm isopropanol at different temperature. It
can be seen that the Fe doping not only increases the
response,
but
also
decreases
the
optimal
operating
temperature. Fig. 2 (d) is the response to 5 ppm isopropanol
under different RH. From 25% to 100%, the response of 5
at% Fe-ZnO is not affected by RH a lot. In Table 1, we
compared the results with some other works.
For the gas sensing mechanism, we consider that the
isopropanol reacted with both the adsorbed oxygen ions and
the Fe3+ doped in the ZnO.
IV.
CONCLUSION
ZnO and Fe-doped ZnO nanoneedles were synthesized
via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The Fe doping
changed the morphology of ZnO. The Fe-doped ZnO retains
the n-type semiconductor property. The 5 at% Fe-doped ZnO
showed the best sensing performance to isopropanol at
275oC with fast response. The improvement of sensing
properties is considered as the adjustment of the band
structure by the doping of Fe.

Abstract—This paper presents a 3D point cloud mapping 
method for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-denied 
and dynamic environments using a scanning multilayer Light 
Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) mounted on a motorcycle. The 
distortion in the scan data from the LiDAR is corrected by 
estimating the motorcycle’s pose (3D positions and attitude 
angles) in a period shorter than the LiDAR scan period based 
on the information from Normal Distributions Transform 
(NDT) scan matching and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). 
The corrected scan data are mapped onto an elevation map. The 
static and moving scan data, which originate from static and 
moving objects in the environments, respectively, are classified 
using the occupancy grid method. Only the static scan data are 
applied to generate a point cloud map using NDT-based 
Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). The 
experimental results obtained in an urban road environment 
demonstrate the qualitative effectiveness of the proposed 
method.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, numerous studies were conducted on the 
active safety and autonomous driving of vehicles and 
personal mobility devices, while many also focused on last-
mile automation by delivery robots. Important technologies 
from these studies include environmental map generation 
(mapping) [1]–[3]. In this study, we focus on mapping with a 
Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) mounted on a vehicle.  
Within the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems 
(ITS), maps are generated using mobile mapping systems [4]. 
These maps are applied to the areas of autonomous driving 
and active safety for automobiles in wide road environments, 
such as highways and motorways. In this study, we focus on 
environment maps for the active safety and autonomous 
driving of personal mobility devices and delivery robots as 
well as for various social services such as disaster prevention 
and mitigation [5][6].  
In the process, we address generating 3D point cloud 
maps for narrow road environments, such as community 
roads and scenic roads in urban and mountainous areas, using 
LiDAR mounted on two-wheeled vehicles (e.g., bicycles and 
motorcycles) with higher maneuverability than four-wheeled 
vehicles (e.g., cars and buses). To generate 3D point cloud 
maps using LiDAR-based Simultaneous Localization And 
Mapping (SLAM), the LiDAR data captured in the sensor 
coordinate frame must be accurately mapped onto the world 
coordinate frame using the pose (i.e., position and attitude 
angle) information of the vehicle. Since LiDAR generally 
obtains data via laser scanning, all the scan data within one 
scan cannot be obtained at the same time when a vehicle is 
moving or is changing its attitude. Therefore, if such data are 
transformed based on the vehicle’s pose at the same time, 
distortion appears on the environmental maps.  
To reduce the distortion in the scan data, several methods 
were proposed [7]–[10]. Most conventional methods were 
aimed at correcting the distortion in the scan data from a 
LiDAR mounted on four-wheeled vehicles moving on flat 
road surfaces. To the best of our knowledge, very few studies 
exist that addressed distortion correction when vehicles 
change their poses drastically.   
Thus, we proposed a Normal Distributions Transform 
(NDT)-based SLAM for application in Global Navigation 
Satellite Systems (GNSS)-denied environments using a 
scanning LiDAR mounted on two-wheeled vehicle that 
change their pose drastically [11]. The pose of the two-
wheeled vehicle was calculated via NDT scan matching [12] 
using the LiDAR scan data obtained for each scan period. By 
estimating the vehicle’s pose in a period shorter than the scan 
period via an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the distortion 
in the scan data was corrected. The corrected scan data were 
applied to 3D point cloud maps. The experimental results of 
the road-environment mapping by a scanning LiDAR 
mounted on a bicycle under a zigzag motion validated the 
efficacy of the proposed method. 
However, further improvement to our NDT-based SLAM 
is needed. While it was designed to be used in static 
environments, moving objects such as cars, buses, two-
wheeled vehicles, and pedestrians exist in practical 
environments. The presence of moving objects in practical 
dynamic environments deteriorates the mapping performance. 
This problem can be addressed by integrating SLAM with 
moving-object detection. Many SLAM methods were 
presented for use in dynamic environments [2][13]–[15]. 
However, most of the methods were based on the use of a 
sensor mounted on a four-wheeled vehicle.  SLAM with a 
sensor mounted on a two-wheeled vehicle in dynamic 
environments remains a challenging issue. 
Thus, in this paper, we present an NDT-based SLAM 
using a scanning LiDAR mounted on a motorcycle in GNSS- 
denied and dynamic environments. This paper is an extension 
of our previous paper [15] on NDT-based SLAM, which used 
a scanning LiDAR mounted on a four-wheeled vehicle within

follows. Section II describes the experimental system. 
Section III summarizes the scan-data mapping based on the 
NDT scan matching. Section IV explains the distortion 
correction method for the LiDAR scan data, and Section V

and future work in Section VII. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM 
Figure 1 shows the overview of the motorcycle (Honda 
Gyro Canopy). A scanning 32-layer LiDAR (Velodyne HDL-
32E) and an IMU (Xsens MTi-300) are mounted on the upper 
part of the motorcycle. The maximum range of the LiDAR is 
70 m, the horizontal viewing angle is 360° with a resolution 
of 0.16°, and the vertical viewing angle is 41.34° with a 
resolution of 1.33°. The LiDAR provides 384 measurements 
(the object’s 3D position and reflection intensity) every 0.55 
ms (at 2° horizontal angle increments). The time that the 
LiDAR beam takes to complete one rotation (360°) in the 
horizontal direction is 100 ms, and 70,000 measurements are 
obtained in one rotation.  
The IMU provides the attitude angles (roll and pitch 
angles) and the angular velocities (roll, pitch, and yaw 
velocities) every 10 ms with an attitude angle error of ±0.3° 
(typ.) and an angular velocity error of ±0.2 °/s (typ.). 
In this paper, one rotation of the LiDAR beam in the 
horizontal direction (360°) is referred to as one scan, while 
the data obtained from this scan is referred to as scan data. 
The LiDAR’s scan period (100 ms) is denoted as 
 and the 
scan data observation period (0.55 ms) as 
. The 
observation period (10 ms) of the IMU is denoted as 
IM U , 
which means the IMU data are obtained 10 times in one scan 
of the LiDAR (τ = 10ΔτIMU), while the LiDAR scan data are 
obtained 18 times within the observation period of the IMU 
(ΔτIMU =18Δτ). 
III. 
NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS TRANSFORM  
SCAN MATCHING 
The scan data mapping is based on NDT scan matching 
[12]. For clarity, we explain the NDT scan matching using the 
LiDAR scan data in which the distortion is corrected. The 
distortion correction method is detailed in the following 
section. 
A voxel grid filter is applied to downsize the scan data. 
The voxel used for the filter is a tetrahedron with a side length 
of 0.2 m. In the world coordinate frame, 
W , a voxel map 
with a voxel size of 1 m is used for NDT scan matching. For 
the i-th (i = 1, 2, …n) measurement in the scan data, the 
position vector in 
b  is defined as 
bi
p  and that in
W  as 
ip . 
Thus, the relation is given by the following homogeneous 
form:

NDT scan matching involves conducting an NDT for the

calculating the mean and covariance of the LiDAR 
measurement positions. By matching the new input scan at 
t  with the reference scan data obtained prior to 
)1
(t
, the 
motorcycle’s pose 
X (t)
  at t   can be determined. The 
motorcycle’s pose is used for conducting a coordinate 
transform with (1), the new input scan can then be mapped to 
W , and the reference scan is updated.  
In this study, we use the point cloud library for the NDT 
scan matching [16].

If the motorcycle is assumed to move at nearly constant 
linear and angular velocities, a motion model can be derived 
as (A.1) in the Appendix. We express (A.1) in the following

B. Distrotion Correction 
Figure 3 shows the correction flow of the LiDAR scan 
data [11]. The LiDAR’s scan period 
  is 100 ms, the 
observation period 
IM U  of the IMU is 10 ms, and the scan 
data observation period 
 is 0.55 ms. When the scan data 
are mapped onto 
W  using the motorcycle’s pose, which is 
calculated for every LiDAR scan period, distortion appears 
on the environmental map. Therefore, the distortion in the 
LiDAR scan data is corrected by estimating the motorcycle’s 
pose using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for every scan 
data observation period 
. 
The IMU data are obtained 10 times per LiDAR scan (τ = 
10ΔτIMU). The state estimate of the motorcycle and its error

V. REMOVAL OF MOVING SCAN DATA 
In dynamic environments where moving objects such as 
cars, motorcycles, and pedestrians exist, the LiDAR scan data 
related to moving objects (referred to as moving scan data) 
must be removed from the entire scan data, and only the scan 
data related to static objects (static scan data), such as 
buildings and trees, have to be utilized for the mapping. 
We previously studied moving-object detection and 
tracking in crowded environments [17][18]. This method is 
applied to extract the static scan data from the LiDAR scan 
data. 
To extract the static scan data, the LiDAR scan data are 
first classified into two types, scan data originating from road 
surfaces (road-surface scan data) and scan data originating 
from objects (object scan data), according to a rule-based 
method. The object scan data obtained in 
b  are mapped 
onto an elevation map represented in 
W  using the 
motorcycle’s pose calculated by (1). In this study, the cell of 
the elevation map is a square with a side length of 0.3 m.  
A cell containing scan data is referred to as an occupied 
cell. For moving scan data, the time to occupy the same cell 
is short, while for static scan data, the time is long. Therefore, 
using the occupancy grid method based on the cell occupancy 
time [17], the occupied cells are classified into two types of 
cell, moving and static, which are occupied by the moving 
and static scan data, respectively. Cells that the LiDAR 
cannot identify due to obstructions are defined as unknown 
cells, and their cell occupancy time is not counted.  
Since the scan data related to an object generally occupy 
multiple cells, adjacent occupied cells are clustered. Then, the 
scan data in clustered static cells are applied to the mapping. 
When moving objects such as vehicles pause (e.g., at a 
red light), the occupancy grid-based method often 
misidentifies their scan data as static scan data. To address 
this problem, the road-surface scan data are mapped onto the 
elevation map, and the cells in which the road-surface scan 
data are occupied for a while are regarded as the road-surface 
cells. If the road-surface cells contain the object scan data, the 
object scan data are always determined as moving scan data 
and are removed from the entire scan data. 
VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Mapping experiments were conducted within road traffic 
environments (Figure 4). Figure 5 shows photos of areas 1 and 
2, which are shown in Figure 4. The traveled distance of the 
motorcycle was around 2,886 m, while its maximum speed 
was 30 km/h. The motorcycle turned left six times and then 
tilted approximately 10° in a roll direction.

Figure 6 shows the mapping result using NDT-based 
SLAM in conjunction with distortion correction of the LiDAR 
scan data and the extraction of the static scan data.  
To evaluate the mapping performance in detail, enlarged 
maps of areas 1 and 2 in Figure 4 are compiled, as shown in 
Figures 7 and 8. Figure 7 presents the map when the 
motorcycle is turning left, while Figure 8 presents the map 
when the motorcycle is going straight. Figure 9 also shows the 
mapping result of a traffic sign in area 1, in which the 
motorcycle is turning left. In area 1, there are four cars and 
four pedestrians, and in area 2, there are four cars and three 
pedestrians. 
For comparison purposes, the maps were generated in 
terms of the following cases: 
Case 1: Mapping by the proposed method: NDT-based 
SLAM with the distortion correction of the LiDAR scan data 
and the extraction of the static scan data from the entire 
LiDAR scan data.  
Case 2: NDT-based SLAM with the distortion correction 
but without the extraction of the static scan data.  
Case 3: NDT-based SLAM without either method. 
 
As Figures 7 and 8 show, case 1 (proposed method) 
removes the track (red dots) of any moving objects (cars and 
pedestrians) more than cases 2 and 3. Meanwhile, as Figure 9 
shows, the mapping results obtained in case 1 are more crisp 
than those obtained in case 3. Thus, the conclusion exists that 
the proposed method provides a better mapping result than 
cases 2 and 3. 
 However, our method of moving-object detection exhibits 
one drawback. When, for example, cars slow down at an 
intersection, stop at a red light, or pause to turn left (or right), 
they are sometimes determined as static objects. Then, the 
LiDAR scan data that relate to cars partially remain on the 
mapping.  
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presented NDT-based mapping using a 
scanning LiDAR mounted on a motorcycle in GNSS-denied 
and dynamic environments. The distortion in the LiDAR scan 
data was corrected based on the information from the NDT 
scan matching and the IMU via EKF. The moving scan data 
were removed from the entire LiDAR scan data using the 
occupancy grid-based method, and the static scan data were 
applied to 3D point cloud maps using the NDT scan matching. 
The efficacy of the mapping was qualitatively demonstrated 
through experimental results obtained in road environments. 
We are currently conducting quantitative evaluations of the 
presented method in various environments.  
Some improvements to the presented method are 
required.   Since the distortion correction of the LiDAR scan 
data requires a great deal of computational time, Graphical 
Processing Unit (GPU) must be utilized in real-time 
operations. NDT-based SLAM degrades the mapping 
accuracy over time due to the accumulation error and must be 
integrated with Graph-based SLAM to reduce the drift. In 
addition, NDT-based SLAM with moving-object detection 
should be extended to SLAM with Detection And Tracking 
of Moving Objects (DATMO) for advanced rider assist 
systems. The SLAM DATMO approach will improve the 
mapping performance of both the mapping and the moving-
object tracking.

Abstract—In a biomedical context linked to the detection of 
biological particles in a liquid by a biosensor, we have modeled 
a piezoelectric transducer based on Gallium Arsenide. The 
future application will enable to evaluate the mass of biological 
specific elements present in a complex fluid. The multiphysics 
simulations of this transducer allowed us to identify a quasi-
transverse thickness mode at around 2 MHz. For this mode, 
the out-of-plane displacement is low, which is a prerequisite to 
keep the performance when immersed in a liquid medium. In 
this study, we demonstrated the effect of holes distributed over 
the structure on the in-plane/out-of-plane displacement ratio 
and on its resonance frequency.  
Keywords-Gallium Arsenide; Acoustic transducer; Holes 
numbers. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In the medical field, the growing need to provide real-
time information on the presence of a specific biological 
element in a complex environment has motivated the 
development of a multitude of detection technologies [1][2]. 
Nevertheless, it is important to mention that many methods 
of detection still use culture processes before measurement 
because their limit of detection is too high. The culture of 
biological elements requires a lot of time and does not allow 
a real time monitoring of the biological liquid. The objective 
of this study is to design a transducer whose sensitivity and 
limit of detection in liquid media are at the state of the art 
[3][4]. 
For this purpose, we propose an original acoustic 
transduction microdevice to detect the immobilization of 
specific analytes. The challenge of this type of transducer is 
to maintain its quality factor Q at the value in air when it is 
immersed in a liquid medium, especially in a viscous 
medium such as blood. To get close to this result, we must 
cancel as much as possible the out-of-plane components of 
the vibration. 
Previous works [5][6] on wave propagation in clamped 
plates have demonstrated the strong attenuation that these 
embedding could generate on these waves, making 
measurements difficult when the plate is immersed in a 
liquid medium. To avoid signal losses when the plate is in 
contact of a fluid, two alternatives are studied: (1) to clamp 
the plate along two sides rather than four, and (2) to add 
holes so as to soften the structure in the plane of the plate.  
II. 
EXPERIMENT 
In this study, the considered transducer structure is a 
rectangular thin plate in the plane (x, y) made of 
piezoelectric gallium arsenide (GaAs) which size is 
3000x2000x50 μm3 (Figure 1(a)). GaAs was chosen because 
of its pure crystallinity and its knowledge in terms of 
microfabrication. The generation of the elastic wave in the 
structure is ensured by means of three gold electrodes 
deposited by sputtering on the upper surface. These 
electrodes are oriented along the plate width and separated 
equidistantly. The structure is clamped along x direction. All 
the numeric simulation are performed using COMSOL 
Multiphysics© software.

With this configuration, the attenuation due to the fluid in 
contact with the membrane is minimized, but not negligible. 
In order to increase the in-plane amplitude of the acoustic 
wave in the GaAs crystal, we generate several circular holes 
in the plate (Figure 1(b)). The objective of these holes

distributed over the plate is to increase the elasticity of the 
plate and then to improve the electrical response of the 
transducer. In this study, the effect of a circular holes array 
evenly distributed between each electrode is presented. The 
simulated results shown in Figure 3(a) and 3(b) highlight 
the impact of the size and number of holes on the in-
plane/out-of plane displacements ratio. As seen in this 
figure, the displacement ratios X/Z and Y/Z have the same 
trend. Because of the orientation of electrodes toward Y 
axis, the ratio X/Z is higher than Y/Z. The most important 
displacement ratio (in the two directions) is obtained for a 
holes number equal to 90 and a hole diameter equal to 50 
μm. Other recent simulations on equivalent models prove 
that the frequency step of the model is a significant 
parameter and impact on the displacement ratios. The 
apparent plateau observable in displacement ratio of Figure 
3(a) is due to a lack of simulation points for a given holes 
configuration.

μm) and b) holes diameters (holes array in the plate considered: 10x9) on 
the X/Z and Y/Z displacement ratios. 
Figure 4(a) displays the resonance frequency evolution 
with the number of holes for a hole diameter equal to 50 
μm. The resonance frequency shift vs the number of holes 
behaves as a linear curve. Figure 4(b) shows that for two 
different sizes of holes the behavior of resonance frequency 
with the hole diameters is non linear.

CONCLUSION 
A 
plate 
mode 
(including 
clamped), 
with 
few 
displacement, depending on the thickness, and, therefore, 
having small attenuation in contact with the fluid, has been 
identified around 2 MHz. The addition of holes has the 
effect of shifting this mode towards lower frequencies. The 
displacement ratio gives better results for a holes number 
equal to 90 and a hole diameter equal to 50 μm. Future work 
will focus on the validation of this model with different 
fluid media: air, water, ionic solution and a biological fluid. 
For this purpose, several steps will be undertaken: 
 
Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of the 
electrical impedance as a function of the size and 
the number of holes in the plate.  
 
Microfabrication of the GaAs / electrode structures 
by wet chemical etching and measurement of the 
acoustic impedance at the resonance frequency of 
the device placed in air and in liquid. The goal is to 
validate experimentally the previous results. The 
experimental study will focus on the "solid" 
structure and then on structures with holes. Some 
of the different tests that can be performed include: 
o 
The electrical impedance measurement 
with impedance analyzer enables to check 
the resonance frequency value of the 
mode and provides the quality factor of 
the resonators. 
o 
The 3D vibration measurements enable to 
conclude on the evolution of the out of 
plane displacement of the structure 
according to the holes parameters. 
 
These experimental validations aim to conclude on the 
relevance of these microstructured devices for biosensing in 
liquid.

Abstract— In this paper, a non-linear model is presented for a 
magnetostrictive force sensor and the effective parameters in the 
sensor are highlighted. It was found that pre-stress and bias 
magnetic fields are the most significant parameters.  It was 
observed that the presented force sensor has linear behavior for 
an applied force range from 100 to 1700 N.  Response Surface 
Method (RSM) was employed to analyze the sensitivity of the 
sensor against the effective parameters. It was found that the 
pre-stress and bias magnetic field and their interactions play a 
significant role in the sensitivity of the force sensor. 
Furthermore, it was manifested that the linearity can be 
enhanced by increasing the pre-stress. On the other hand, the 
sensitivity of the sensor will be sacrificed by increasing the pre-
stress. Bias magnetic field plays the same role. The sensor’s 
sensitivity can be enhanced by increasing the bias magnetic field. 
Conversely, the sensor loses its linearity in a higher magnetic 
field. Therefore, there is a trade-off between sensor sensitivity 
and nonlinearity and both are adjustable by both, pre-stress and 
magnetic bias.

 INTRODUCTION  
Nowadays, the force sensing element is an inevitable 
feedback element in many control systems in industries.  
Warning alarms of the seat belt in automobiles, manipulators 
of robots, and oil/gas monitoring systems are highly 
dependent on the force/pressure sensing elements. Compared 
to the traditional force sensors using strain gages, smart 
materials 
are 
promising 
better 
static 
and 
dynamic 
characteristics. Piezoelectric elements have been employed as 
smart sensors for many years [1][2]. However, the 
piezoelectric element is brittle and its output signal 
transmission cannot be wireless. On the other hand, a 
magnetostrictive force sensor has some outstanding merits in 
comparison with the other force sensors such as machinability 
[3]-[6], high coupling factor between elastic and magnetic 
states (about 0.7), heavy loads withstanding [7], adaptive with 
a harsh environment [8], low response time (about a few 
microseconds), zero-energy consumption [9] and is suitable 
for wireless applications [10]. It is required to mention that 
magnetostrictive materials suffer from some disadvantages 
such as Hysteresis behavior, Eddy current loss, and thermal 
instability. Talebian presented a good enough model for 
Hysteresis [11] and Eddy current loss [12].  Furthermore, 
Ghodsi et al. employed a thermoelectric cooler to remove heat 
generated by the excitation coil [13][14]. Magnetostrictive 
force sensors are based on the Villari effect [15]. Therefore, 
when subjected to a mechanical force, their magnetization 
varies and we can measure the variation of magnetic field 
density passing through the magnetostrictive bar. This 
variation can be proportional to the applied mechanical load. 
Calkins et al. and Stachowiak investigated the effects of pre-
stress on the dynamic performance of Terfenol-D 
transducers/actuators [16][17]. Many researchers developed 
various types of magnetostrictive force sensors. Zhu et al. 
proposed a model for a giant magnetostrictive force sensor 
and investigated the effect of frequency on the output voltage 
of the sensor [18].  A precise impact force sensor using 
Galfenol has been developed by Shu et al. They showed that 
the cantilever type is more sensitive than the rod type [19].   
Galfenol was employed to develop a high sensitivity and 
linearity tactile magnetostrictive force sensor in 2019 [20]. 
Despite high linearity, this cantilever force sensor is suitable 
for a low range of force detection less than 5 N.  
In this paper, after presenting the principle of the sensor in 
Section 2, a non-linear magneto-mechanical model for giant 
magnetostrictive force is combined with Faraday’s law to 
predict the generated voltage by a search coil.   Furthermore, 
the sensitive analysis of the sensor and the effects of 
parameters on the sensor’s performance will be discussed in 
Section 3.

II. 
PRINCIPLE AND MODELING OF FORCE SENSOR 
A. Principle of Operation 
The proposed force sensor consists of a core made of Giant 
Magnetostrictive Material (GMM) which is in the presence of 
a bias magnetic field, a search coil, and an excitation coil to 
generate a bias magnetic field (Figure 1). The bias magnetic 
field can be generated by permanent magnets or a coil 
energized by a variable DC power supply. Applied force 
changes the magnetic flux density pass through the Terfenol-
D. Based on Faraday's law, the variation of magnetic flux can 
be detected by the generated voltage across the resistive load 
connected to the ends of the search coil. The amplitude of the 
generated voltage (V2) is proportional to the amplitude of the 
applied force (Fm). The proportional relationship can be 
changed to an equal relationship by (1).        
𝑉2 = 𝑘 (𝐻0, 𝐹0) 𝐹𝑚                                   (1)  
k is the coefficient, which is dependent on the magnetic bias 
and pre-stress applied to the Terfenol-D.  The effect of 
magnetic bias and pre-stress will be examined in the next 
section. 
B. Non-linear Analytical Modeling 
This section aims to find a relationship between the 
amplitude of the applied force and the amplitude of the 
induced voltage. By applying axial harmonic force consists 
of bias force to the magnetostrictive bar, Terfenol-D, the 
sensitive part of the sensor is subjected to tensile and 
compressive normal stresses. By assuming the vibration as 
the axial harmonic force, the non-linear magneto-mechanical 
relation of Terfenol-D can be presented in (2) [21].

        (2) 
where 𝐵 is magnetic flux density, H is the magnetic field  , 
and  are strain and the applied stress, respectively. For 
Terfenol-D, the best value of  and Ms are -347 and 0.8, 
respectively [12][22].  The magnetic field consists of two 
components of (a) magnetic field bias, H0, (b) magnetic field 
caused by generated current, 𝐻.
̂  Using Ampere’s law, the 
magnetic field can be concluded as (3). 
𝐻 = 𝐻0 + 𝐻̂ = 𝐻0 + 𝑁𝑖2

                                  (3) 
where N is the number of turns of the search coil, i2 is induced 
current due to the applied force and l0 is the length of the 
Terfenol-D bar. Based on Faraday's law, the relationship 
between magnetic flux and generated voltage can be written 
as follow: 
𝜑 = 𝐵𝐴 = − 1
𝑁 ∫ 𝑣2𝑑𝑡                                       (4)  
By substituting (3) and (4) into (2) and considering F=A and 
v2=Ri2 the induced current can be derived by solving 
differential (5).

To solve this non-linear differential equation, we 
employed the Simulink of MATLAB (Appendix A). The 
parameters of the force sensor are shown in Table I. The 
sample of output voltage calculated by Simulink is shown in 
Figure 2 while the sensor is under harmonic force. Figure 3 
shows the simulated relationship between applied force and 
output voltage when the magnetostrictive force sensor is under 
various magnetic fields from 100 to 20 kA/m, and constant 
bias compressive force is about 1000 N.  It is obvious that the 
force sensor has a linear behavior in the range from 100 to 
1700 N. Furthermore, magnetic bias has a positive effect on 
the sensitivity of the sensor while its nonlinearity is magnified 
for force amplitude larger than 1700 N. The effect of bias force 
(pre-stress) is simulated in Figure 4.  It is found that higher 
pre-stress causes lower sensitivity. However, pre-stress is 
helpful to enhance the linearity of the sensor in a force range 
higher than 1700 N.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE FORCE SENSOR 
Referring to the (5), and the sample of the voltage output 
shown in Figures 2 to 4, the magnetic bias and pre-stress seem 
to be effective on the measured voltage across the search coil.  
To examine this assumption, the Design Of Experiments 
(DOE) was exploited [23][24].  The goal of this part is to 
determine the optimum operating conditions while the pre-
stress and bias magnetic fields are assumed adjustable. The 
variable factors in this force sensor are F0 and H0.  To 
maximize the output voltage, the Response Surface Method 
(RSM) is employed to find proper values for each factor to 
have optimum output voltage [25][26]. To specify a regression 
equation between the amplitude of output voltage and pre-
stress and magnetic bias, Minitab 17 software is used.  Table 
II shows two factors with five levels for each. Based on the 
design proposed by RSM and selection of= 1.44, it is found 
that nine simulation results including one center point are 
required (Table III). Table IV shows the Pvalue and the 
coefficients of each factor.  Since the Pvalue of H0× H0 is greater 
than 0.05, the effect of this term, H0×H0, is ignorable on the 
output voltage. However, F0, H0, and their interaction are 
effective, since their Pvalue is smaller than 0.05. R-Sq = 98.38% 
shows the goodness of the model represented by RSM.

and H0  
 
 
Figure 6.  Interaction between F0 and H0 
 
 
Figure 7.  RSM optimizer to predict the maximum output 
Based on the coefficients presented in Table IV, the output 
voltage can be modeled by (6): 
 
V2 (v) = 0.07411+0.05982 F0 + 0.04381 H0 + 0.02801 F0× F0 
+ 0.02575 F0× H0                                                           
                                                                                      (6) 
Therefore, among the factors and their interactions, F0 has the 
highest effect since its coefficient is the largest. Figures 5 and 
6 show the main effects and interactions between the main 
factors. One of the biggest advantages of RSM is determining 
the maximum output voltage. Figure 7 predicts that the 
maximum amplitude of output voltage (Vm) can be enhanced 
to 0.32 V, when both F0 and H0 are 1060 N and 8.6 kA/m, 
respectively.  This prediction is confirmed when these values 
are substituted in (5) and the amplitude of output voltage (Vm) 
reaches 0.4 V.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
A magnetostrictive force sensor was modeled using non-
linear magneto-mechanical coupling equations. The effect of 
the pre-stress and bias magnetic field was investigated on the 
sensitivity and nonlinearity of the force sensors. It was 
highlighted that the presented applied force has linear 
behavior for the applied force range from 100 to 1700 N.  
Response Surface Method (RSM) was employed to analyze 
the sensitivity of the sensor against the effective parameters. 
It was found that the pre-stress and bias magnetic fields and 
their interactions play a significant role in the sensitivity of the 
force sensor. Furthermore, it was manifested that the linearity 
can be enhanced by increasing the pre-stress. On the other 
hand, the sensitivity of the sensor will be sacrificed by 
increasing the pre-stress. Bias magnetic field plays the same 
role. The sensor’s sensitivity can be enhanced by increasing 
the bias magnetic field. Conversely, the sensor loses its 
linearity in a higher magnetic field. Consequently, there is a 
trade-off between sensor sensitivity and nonlinearity and both 
are adjustable by both, pre-stress and magnetic bias.

Abstract—Due to the broad range of options that wireless 
systems offer, Wi-Fi products are increasingly being used in 
agriculture environments to improve farming practices and 
better control the output of the production. However, the 
foliage has proven to harm radio-frequency propagation as 
well as decreasing the coverage area of Wireless Sensor 
Networks 
(WSNs). 
Therefore, 
near-ground 
channel 
characterization can help in avoiding high antennas and 
vegetation. Nevertheless, theoretical models tend to fail when 
forecasting near-ground path losses. This paper aims at 
determining how the field components such as soil, grass and, 
trunks affect radio-links in near-ground scenarios. To do this, 
we measure the Received Signal Strength (RSSI), the Signal to 
Interference Ratio (SIR) and the Round-Trip Time (RTT) of a

INTRODUCTION 
Smart Farming (SF) emphasizes the use of Information 
and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to leverage the 
farm management cycle. Improving the production capacity 
does not only enhance business efficiency but increases 
production and reduces the environmental impact. Since the 
United Nations expects the world population to reach 9.8 
billion by 2050, human societies are facing the challenge of 
providing nourishment and livelihoods, while addressing the 
effects of climate change [1]. As it is, smart farming applies 
measures 
ecologically 
meaningful 
and 
site-specific, 
focusing on implementing auto-piloted harvesters and other 
farm machinery to achieve the smartest treatment [2]. 
The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing are 
expected to move forward in farming management 
development by introducing these technologies into 
machinery and production systems [3]. The gathered 
information will then be sent via different technologies such 
as IEEE 802.11 standards, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, 
6LoWPAN, 3G, 4G, etc., depending on the amount of data 
to be transmitted and the distance [4]. Nevertheless, IoT 
systems usually deal with small amounts of data to be 
transmitted through short distances. The two main storage 
systems used to save the gathered information from the 
sensors are traditional databases or clouds. The most used 
databases are MySQL and SQL, while the Thingspeak 
platform is the most used in cloud systems [4].  
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are needed to 
monitor environmental conditions and provide decision-
making information. This type of networks is composed of a 
group of spatially dispersed sensors to monitor and record 
environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, 
soil moisture, etc. WSNs are made up of four parts: a 
wireless sensor node, a gateway node, a wireless 
communication network, and a server [5]. With the 
evolution of microelectronic technology, sensor nodes have 
evolved to be small devices with sensing, communication 
and computing devices. However, each node can only 
monitor a specific part of the field. Thus, the coverage area 
is a key problem since all nodes among a WSN must be 
autonomous to cooperatively pass data through the network 
to a main location. Moreover, its topology can vary 
enormously depending on the field. 
Whatever WSN application may be, IEEE 802.11 g/n 
standard is generally used in WSN because it allows 
distances up to approximately 300 meters in outdoor 
environments (when there is free space between devices) 
[5]. This allows a maximum raw data throughput of 54 
Mbps or 600 Mbps, depending on the standard used. 
Likewise, the radio-frequency band can vary from 2.4 GHz 
to 5 GHz using Modulation Code Keying (CCK), Direct-
sequence 
Spread 
Spectrum 
(DSSS) 
or 
Orthogonal 
Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation 
schemes.  
In 2019, Bacco et al. [7] conducted a survey on SF 
research activities to state the achieved results and current 
investigations within EU territory. As a result, challenges 
impeding the adoption of recent technologies and techniques 
were highlighted. Although the current use of sensor nodes 
and analytic techniques is boosting Decision Support 
Systems (DSSs) in farms the lack of diffusion programs is 
preventing areas affected by the digital divide from 
incorporating ICTs. Nevertheless, technology is expected to 
have an increasing role in agriculture so that operations, 
such as planting and harvesting, may be automatized. 
Moreover, the availability of real-time data will allow finer 
control of pesticides and other chemicals. However, none of 
these will be possible without supporting policies to address 
poor telecommunication infrastructures and reduced digital 
skills. 
As for Precision Agriculture (PA), Lindblom et al. [8] 
conducted a review on agricultural DSSs within the frame of 
the ongoing Swedish project. This project intends to identify 
the scientific disciplines and other competences that need to

work together in developing technology for agricultural 
DSS. Therefore, the discussion is focused on the importance 
of considering in-land processes to design suitable WSNs. 
However, the lack of active participation in agricultural 
research and development processes is preventing the 
development of new practices and behaviours for more 
sustainable farming. 
This paper aims to study near-ground wireless coverage 
in rural environments to ease multi-hop routing design. To 
this end, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), the 
Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) and the Round-Trip Time 
(RTT) of a wireless signal were measured at an orange field. 
This study aims to determine how near-ground radio-links 
are affected by field components such as grass, soil, trunks, 
etc. In this experiment, measurements were made at two 
different scenarios: one without vegetation and one at an 
orange tree plantation. In both cases, we used an access 
point and a laptop to take measurements at different 
distances, 30 cm above the ground. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II 
presents some related works. In Section III, the most 
popular 
propagation 
models 
are 
explained. 
The 
methodology and materials used in the experiment are 
presented in Section IV. In Section V, the experimental 
results are analysed. Finally, the main conclusions and 
future work are exposed in Section VI.  
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
Few technical works characterize near-ground radio-
frequency propagation. In this section, some of the related 
works are discussed. 
In 2011, Lloret et al. [9] presented a WSN that uses 
image processing to detect bad leaves in vineyards and 
sends an alarm to the farmer. In this case, wireless 
communications are made through IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n 
standard to allow long-distance connections. Although the 
proposed system does not identify the cause of the 
deficiency, it detects bad leaves and notifies it to the farmer 
who can then decide what actions need to be taken. This 
solution provides a cost-effective sensor based on IP routers 
that have been adapted to fulfil this purpose. The designed 
WSN takes into account both sensing and radio coverage 
areas to allow low bandwidth consumption and higher 
scalability. The system to detect bad leaves goes through a 
5-stage process before the node decides whether an alarm 
needs to be sent. 
 In [10], Wang et al. depicted a statistical model for near-
ground channels based on experimental data collected 
through three different scenarios at 2.4 GHz. The main 
objective of this study was to develop a WSN to collect data 
in military explosive research. To do this, sensor nodes were 
fixed on the ground and had an antenna height of 3 cm to 
resist damages from detonations. Different propagation 
models were applied to predict path loss and compare the 
results with the performance of the obtained model. The 
main conclusion of this research was that antenna height 
determines the breakpoint distance of the nodes. 
Luciani et al. [11] described a study done on near-
ground node range at different heights in Wi-Fi crowded 
environments. The designed WSN used IEEE 802.15.4 
standard to avoid direct Wi-Fi interference. Signal quality 
and range were determined by collecting RSSI data of three 
nodes at increasing node separation distance until signal 
loss. To perform the tests, measures were taken at three 
different heights: 15 cm, 30 cm, and 100 cm, at three 
different scenarios. The results of this experiment showed 
that prediction models failed to accurately forecast path loss. 
Moreover, ground-loss proved to be a major issue that 
determines node range and thus, must be taken into account 
when designing WSNs.  
In 2015, Szajna et al. [12] characterized path loss and 
near-ground channels at 2.45 GHz on forested areas covered 
by snow. This study aimed to investigate the impact of 
antenna height and distance between nodes on path loss and 
special correlation. To do this, measurements were carried 
out in two different scenarios: a multi-purpose sports facility 
and a forested area covered by 15 cm of snow. In this case, 
antenna heights varied from 0 to 130.8 cm and the distance 
between the nodes varied in steps of 15.24 m and up to 79.2 
m. The analysis of the results showed that reducing antenna 
heights increased path loss and reduced spatial correlation. 
In [13], Torabi et al. proposed a near-ground prediction 
model to facilitate accurate WSN simulations using the 
principles of the Fresnel zones. In this study, the effects of 
antenna height, frequency, polarization, and electrical and 
geometrical properties of the terrain were studied. The 
accuracy of the proposed model was verified by comparing 
the theoretical results with near-ground measurements 
carried out in outdoor open areas. The results of this study 
showed that antenna height was by far the most influential 
parameter on network connectivity. Moreover, the wireless 
connection was proven to be fairly sensitive to the reflection 
coefficient in near-ground situations. 
Sangodoyin et al. [14] presented a near-ground channel 
model to achieve precision ranging and localization of 
ultrawideband 
(UWB) 
propagation 
channels. 
This 
experiment was performed using a self-built channel 
sounder with an arbitrary waveform generator and a high-
bandwidth sampling oscilloscope. In this case, antenna 
heights ranged from 10 cm up to 2 m above ground to 
determine its effects on signal strength. The results showed 
that the distance-dependent path loss was highly dependent 
on antenna heights. Moreover, under near-ground situations, 
frequency-dependent path loss exponent and shadowing 
variance increased.  
In 2017, Klaina et al. [15] presented a narrowband radio 
channel model operating under near-ground conditions [15]. 
To do this, a WSN based on ZigBee was designed to analyse 
the effects caused by soil and grass fields. In this case, radio 
communications were made at 868 MHz, 2.4 GHz and, 5.8 
GHz. In order to estimate signal quality, RSSI was 
measured and compared to path loss. Finally, they 
concluded that the ground has no effects on RF propagation 
except in the cases where antenna heights were 40 cm or 
less. However, signal levels decreased in the presence of 
grass fields and soil. 
Tang et al. [16] studied a near-ground WSN at 470 MHz 
in four different scenarios to obtain the corresponding path 
loss models. To do this, measurements were taken on a flat 
concrete road, flat grass and two derived scenarios placing 
the transmitter directly on the ground. Three different 
antenna heights were used: 5 cm, 50 cm and, 1 m, and the 
RSSI was measured every meter at a distance up to 10 m, 
every 2 m at a distance of up to 20 m and every 5 m at a

distance of up to 50 m. The results showed that when 
antenna height is lower than 50 cm, prediction models tend 
to inaccurately forecast path loss and thus, network 
connectivity.  
After analysing previous works, we can conclude that 
near-ground wireless systems are difficult to characterize. In 
[9], the presented solution did manage to detect bad leaves. 
However, in this case, vegetation loss was not introduced 
into the power balance formula. The statistical model 
described in [10] demonstrated that antenna height 
determines coverage area and that propagation models fail 
to accurately forecast path loss. Moreover, the study 
depicted in [11] demonstrated that ground-loss is a major 
issue when determining node range. Nevertheless, this 
experiment was performed in Wi-Fi crowded environments. 
The study performed in [12] concluded that reducing 
antenna 
heights 
increased 
path 
loss, 
though 
this 
investigation was carried out in forested areas covered by 
snow. The research in [13] demonstrated that wireless 
connections were fairly sensitive to the reflection coefficient 
in near-ground situations. The experiment performed in [14] 
to characterize near-ground UWB propagation channels 
showed that the node range is highly dependent on antenna 
heights. Furthermore, the study carried in [15] to design a 
WSN based on ZigBee under near-ground conditions 
showed that grass fields and soil affect signal strength. 
Finally, in [16], a near-ground WSN where a transmitter 
was placed directly on the ground was presented, showing 
that prediction models fail to forecast path loss when 
antenna heights are lower than 50 cm. 
For the reasons stated above, in this work, we present a 
site-specific study to guarantee the performance of near-
ground radio-links in orange tree plantations. 
III. 
ANALYTICAL STUDY 
In this section, three propagation models are presented to 
predict the average signal strength drop and assess the level 
of accuracy that can be achieved in near-ground WSN 
scenarios. Thus, this section is divided into three different 
subsections. 
A. Free-Space Model  
The Free-space propagation model is the simplest way to 
calculate radio-signals propagation. From [17], we can 
extract the Free-Space propagation model based on Friis 
Transmission Formula. This equation is usually used when 
there are no obstacles in the line-of-sight, and it is given by 
equation (1). 
𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟 = 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟𝜆𝜆2
(4𝜋𝜋)2𝑑𝑑2
 
(1) 
where: 
Pt: transmitter power, in watts. 
Gt: transmitter antenna gain. 
Gr: receiver antenna gain. 
λ: wavelength. 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
However, it is possible to calculate the losses between a 
transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx) in terms of the 
frequency with equation (2). 
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 20 log 4𝜋𝜋 𝑑𝑑 𝑓𝑓
𝑐𝑐
− 𝐺𝐺𝑇𝑇 − 𝐺𝐺𝑅𝑅  
(2) 
where: 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
f: frequency in Hz. 
c: speed of light in the vacuum (meters per second). 
GT: transmitter antenna gain, in dBi. 
GR: receiver antenna gain, in dBi. 
B. Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model  
The Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model predicts path 
losses between a Tx and a Rx when they are both in line-of-
sight but have different antenna heights. This way, the 
received signal has two components: the line-of-sight 
component and the multipath component which is given by 
ground reflected waves. From [17], the given equation for 
the Two-Ray Model can be expressed by equation (3).  
𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟 = 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟

(3) 
where: 
Pt: transmitter power, in watts. 
Gt: transmitter antenna gain. 
Gr: receiver antenna gain. 
ht: transmitter antenna height, in meters. 
hr: receiver antenna height, in meters. 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
Nevertheless, from the work in [16], we can tell that 
when radio-waves propagate near-ground in line-of-sight 
conditions, the path loss can be described by the plane-earth 
path loss formula, given by equation (4). 
𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 40 log 𝑑𝑑 − 20 log ℎ𝑟𝑟 − 20 log ℎ𝑡𝑡  
(4) 
where: 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
ht: transmitter antenna height, in meters. 
hr: receiver antenna height, in meters. 
C. One-Slope Log-Normal Model  
The log-distance path loss model is a statistical model 
that takes into consideration object blockage, environmental 
clutter, and other changes to predict path loss. From [17], 
the log-normal model can be described by equation (5). 
𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑑𝑑 = 𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑑𝑑0 + 10𝑛𝑛 log

where: 
PL (d): path loss at distance d, in dB.

PL (d0): path loss, in dB, at reference distance of 1 meter 
(FSPL at 1 meter). 
n: path loss factor (n = 2). 
Xσ: zero mean Gaussian distributed variable with 
standard deviation σ. 
σ: linear regression of measured data. 
However, from reference [18] we can express One-Slope 
Log-Normal Model by equation (6). 
𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑑𝑑 = 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑓𝑓, 1 𝑚𝑚 + 10𝑛𝑛 log
𝑑𝑑

(6) 
where: 
PL (d): path loss at distance d, in dB. 
FSPL (f, 1 m): free space path loss, in dB, at a reference 
distance of 1 meter. 
n: path loss factor (n = 2). 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
Other studies have determined that, when antenna 
heights are lower than 50 cm, the One-Slope Model tends to 
estimate path losses better than other models [16]. However, 
other researches state that the use of these theoretical 
models can lead to overestimations of the networking 
capacities and should be avoided [17]. In the following 
sections, we will compare these three models with collated 
data to evaluate their performance and verify their accuracy 
in near-ground scenarios. 
IV. SCENARIO DESCRIPTION AND TOOLS USED 
This section describes the devices used to perform the 
experiments, as well as the setup. Therefore, this section is 
segmented in four different subdivisions. 
A. Place of measurement 
In order to evaluate the path loss in near-ground radio 
wave signals, we sought out an orange tree plantation with 
an area of 1.775 m2, with a length and a width of 71 m by 25 
m, with no walls. 
B. Hardware used 
To perform this experiment, we used Linksys 
WRT320N-EZ router as a Tx configured to work at 2.4GHz 
with IEEE 802.11 b/g/n standard [19]. This router has three 
internal antennas with 1.5 dBi of antenna gain and an RF 
power of 17 dBm. The Rx was ASUS Gaming Notebook 
GL753V, which has a 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7-7700 HQ 
processor, 16 GB of memory. Wireless connections are 
made with Intel Dual Band Wireless Wifi Bluetooth Card 
7265NGW that uses the IEEE 802.11 ac standard and has 
two antennas of 5 dBi of gain. 
C. Software used 
The measurements were made using the software 
Vistumbler [20] to scan the wireless network and measure 
both the SIR and the RSSI. As for the latency of the 
connection, it was measured by sending a ping signal 
through MS-DOS commands to the gateway. 
D. Set-up of the experiment 
Both Tx and Rx were positioned along the same line, 30 
cm above the floor to measure the SIR and the RSSI. The 
evaluation of the path loss of RF signals was made by taking 
measurements in two different scenarios. 
• Scenario 1: Measurements were made at an orange 
tree plantation, with data being collected every meter 
30 cm above the ground. 
• Scenario 2: Measurements were made on a field with 
no vegetation, collecting data every meter 30 cm 
above the ground. 
Fig. 1 illustrates the set-up of the experiment at the 
orange tree plantation. In order to be able to perform 
comparisons of the signal strength, measurements were 
made at the same distances in both scenarios. Fig. 2 shows 
the set-up in Scenario 1. The noise floor in both cases was 
80 dBm. Measurements were taken three times at each 
point. 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In this section, the accuracy of the chosen prediction 
models will be verified by comparing them to near-ground 
measurements. First, the measured data will be examined 
and then prediction models will be discussed and compared 
to collated data. 
Fig. 3 shows the RSSI levels measured in the chosen 
scenarios. The RSSI from Scenario 1 fluctuates much more 
than the one from Scenario 2. This can be due to the random 
distribution of vegetation, as well as the presence of trunks. 
Moreover, the absorption of energy in Scenario 1 may be 
caused by the presence of grass. 
Fig. 4 shows the SIR measured in both scenarios. It can 
be inferred that the presence of vegetation has little effect on 
the quality of the signal, though the reflection on the ground 
may cause errors depending on the modulation used. 
Fig. 5 shows the RTT measured during the experiment. 
In this case, the time delays vary far more in Scenario 1 than 
in Scenario 2. This agrees with the observed fluctuations of 
RSSI in Scenario 1.  
In Fig. 6, One-Slope Model was plotted as a function of 
the logarithm of the distance, in meters. The accuracy of this 
model was validated by performing its trend line and the 
related R-squared value. As Fig. 6 shows, the trend line that 
best fits the plotted data has a linear tendency and an R-
squared value of 1. 
Finally, we compared the selected prediction models by 
plotting them together with the collected data from both 
scenarios in Fig. 7. In this figure, One-Slope Model overlaps 
Free-Space Model. Attending to the collected data curves, 
the path loss is higher in Scenario 1. However, the Two-ray 
Model 
failed 
to 
predict 
the 
attenuation 
correctly. 
Furthermore, the collected data from Scenario 2 shows a 
greater path loss than one the predicted by the Free-Space 
Model and the One-Slope Model.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we attempted to determine how near-
ground radio-waves are affected by field components such 
as grass, soil and, trunks. To this end, we performed an 
experiment at two different scenarios: one with vegetation 
and one without vegetation, where measurements were 
taken 30 cm above the ground. 
In this case study, we analysed the signal quality by 
measuring the RSSI, the SIR and the RTT of a wireless 
signal and compared the collated data with three different 
path loss prediction models. The results showed that, in 
near-ground scenarios, the RSSI tends to fluctuate much 
more in the presence of vegetation (Scenario 1). In other 
terms, the geometry of the trees and the presence of grass 
produced a scattering of energy, as well as a higher number 
of reflections and refractions. However, the interference was 
only noticeable from 15 m. As for the selected prediction 
models, none of them managed to accurately forecast the 
path loss, though Free-Space Model and One-Slope Model 
were close to the measured RSSI of Scenario 2. 
As future work, we would like to include in the 
experimental test different types of plantations agriculture 
environments such as vineyard [9]. Additionally, it could be 
interesting to perform these practical experiments with other 
technologies such as LoRa [21], Zigbee and Sigfox which 
are currently being used in farming activities and compare 
them with the results of IEEE 802.11 standard.
