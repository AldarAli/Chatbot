SPACOMM 2022
Forward
The Fourteenth International Conference on Advances in Satellite and Space Communications
(SPACOMM 2022) continued a series of events to evaluate the state of the art on academia and industry
on the satellite, radar, and antennas-based communications bringing together scientists and
practitioners with challenging issues, achievements, and lessons learnt.
Significant
efforts
have
been
allotted
to
design
and

global
navigation
satellite
communications systems, Satellite navigation technologies, applications, and services experience still
challenges related to signal processing, security, performance, and accuracy. Theories and practices on
system-in-package RF design techniques, filters, passive circuits, microwaves, frequency handling,
radars, antennas, and radio communications and radio waves propagation have been implemented.
Services based on their use are now available, especially those for global positioning and navigation. For
example, it is critical to identify the location of targets or the direction of arrival of any signal for civilians
or on-purpose applications; smarts antennas and advanced active filters are playing a crucial role. Also,
progress has been made for transmission strategies; multiantenna systems can be used to increase the
transmission speed without need for more bandwidth or power. Special techniques and strategies have
been developed and implemented in electronic warfare target location systems.
We take here the opportunity to warmly thank all the members of the SPACOMM 2022 technical
program committee, as well as all the reviewers. The creation of such a high-quality conference program
would not have been possible without their involvement. We also kindly thank all the authors who
dedicated much of their time and effort to contribute to SPACOMM 2022. We truly believe that, thanks
to all these efforts, the final conference program consisted of top-quality contributions. We also thank
the members of the SPACOMM 2022 organizing committee for their help in handling the logistics of this
event.

Abstract—A load-balancing technique is proposed, executed,
and tested against a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) implemen-
tation with well-known characteristics. This would prove that
transparently inserting Software Defined Networking (SDN) to
achieve load balancing without re-configuring the DTN portion
is possible. In addition, two routes were taken to alleviate a DTN
bottleneck threat. The first used a P4 networking switch. This
manual load-balancing test will balance the incoming packets
without the users at the end-points knowing that their original
packet destinations and/or sources may have been changed. The
second route utilized a High-rate Delay Tolerant Networking
(HDTN) receiving node instead of the typical DTN implemen-
tation used. Bench-marking results of the DTN implementation
receiving node and the HDTN receiving node will be compared.

I. INTRODUCTION
As space networks expand and increase complexity, bundle
(and packet) throughput will also increase. This leads to the
idea that individual nodes must be able to handle increased
traffic, particularly from multiple sources and to multiple
destinations. Consider an example with two nodes. Node 1 is
sending bundles, at its processing limit, and likewise node 2
is receiving bundles at its limit. If a third node was introduced
to this system sending any number of packets to node 2,
then node 2 will be over capacity. In this case, the best-
case scenario is that bundles must be re-transmitted. The
question becomes how cases like these could be handled at a
system level. An approach for future networks to load-balance
themselves through a Software Defined Networking (SDN)
switch or a High-rate Delay Tolerant Networking (HDTN)
capability is outlined in [1].
Space networks are well-known for links featuring high
propagation times and intermittent connectivity. These diffi-
culties give rise to Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN), which
is an experimental network protocol designed for this en-
vironment. The DTN implementation used in this paper is
the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION), which is NASA’s
current implementation of delay tolerant networking for space
communication applications [2]. Previous work shows ION’s
performance limitation capabilities where it can process, at
most, low-thousands of bundles per second [1]. This provides
concerns with scaling networks and limiting throughput. Since
ION imposes clear constraints on network performance, it is
easy to see noticeable improvement within the system if the
load-balancing alleviates bundle throughput.
SDN switches range in capabilities due to hardware con-
figuration limitations and the networking software. For the
experiments within this paper, an Aurora 710 networking
switch by Netberg was used. This particular switch provides
32 x 100GbE four-lane Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable
(QSFP) interfaces with programmable pipelines using the
Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4)
language. The Intel Tofino switching Integrated Circuit (IC)
is capable of 3.2T switching and, therefore, will not be a
bottleneck in this experiment [3]. ION was configured to
transmit bundles over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and
hence the Aurora 710 P4 networking switch was programmed
to seamlessly load balance UDP packets. The authors hasten
to add that any protocol, including custom protocols, could
have been used.
P4 is one of many different network switch languages that
can be used to change how a typical network switch works,
but was chosen as it is open-source and has been around since
2013. Prior to the language’s first appearance, vendors of data
plane devices had total control over any device’s functionality.
However, now it is possible to implement specific behavior
in the network within minutes by avoiding firmware and
hardware development. Since P4’s initial debut, the language
has gone through two major reworks, known as P414 and P416

[4]. The Aurora network switch is compatible with both, but
P416 was used for this paper.
Next generation space networks require systems that can
handle longer latency times than naturally occur on Earth.
HDTN is a performance-optimized implementation of DTN
used in this paper, and is optimized for a nearby network
of space systems [1]. HDTN is designed with a message
bus architecture to attempt to eliminate software bottlenecks
caused by shared memory and related locking mechanisms,
such as semaphores and mutexes. HDTN decodes bundles
and metadata into internal messages to control how data flows
through the system.
Figure 1 shows a high level diagram of one of the network
components discussed in this paper. Two ION nodes send
bundles over UDP to HDTN through the P4 switch. Bundles
are received by HDTN’s ingress module, which decodes the
bundle header to determine the message’s desired destination
and Time-To-Live (TTL). If there is no route available to
reach the destination, bundles are saved to disk by HDTN’s
storage module. The scheduler determines if a link is available
to transfer bundles to another node. HDTN can either send
bundles directly through to the egress module, or storage will
retain the bundle until it receives a release message. Here
would be an example of when bottlenecks of data transmission
can pose a problem. If the storage is not large enough, the
packets are dropped [5]. In addition, if the receiver is unable
to process the data quick enough to handle the two ION nodes,
packets can also be lost. For the experiments conducted in this
paper, bundles were stored to disk when they were received.
Figure 1. High Level Network Components.
This paper is structured logically to answer these questions
regarding continuous data transmission at nodes’ capacities.
It first mentions the SDN development procedure in Section
II. This area lays out the P4 code behind the scenes. Then in
Section III, testing starts with placing the SDN switch between
two ION nodes to test a small scale load balancing effort.
Section IV enhances this effort to balancing multiple DTN
nodes with HDTN. And finally, Section V summarizes and
concludes the work presented.
II. SDN DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURE
The Aurora 710 networking switch was provided blank,
that is, without any inherent protocol support. The switch
was first coded in P4 to perform packet switching on Layer
3/Internet Protocol (IP) logical addressing. Once completed,
Layer 4 was taken into account. Because bundles were sent
over UDP to port 4556, which is normal for DTN, the switch
can easily determine if incoming packets were bundles or not.
The network design was straight-forward, and is illustrated in
Figure 2. Recall that in ION, node names are numbers; in our
case these are the final octets of the node’s IP address. Hence
Rho, which has IP 10.10.10.1, is node ipn:1.
After basic Layer 3 switching and packet header checks,
Network Address Translations (NAT) happen next. To start
with, if the final octet of the IP address ends in 10 to 19,
its original destination will remain unchanged. However, to
load balance the traffic, if the source IP address’s final octet is
between 20 and 29, then the destination IP will change to the
first non-zero digit. For example, if the source IP ends in .20,
then its destination IP end is changed from .1 to .2. When
reversing the traffic flow, source IP address will be analyzed.
If the source IP address does not end in a .1, the source
IP address will change back to the original 10.10.10.1
address. See Table I for the NAT rules for traffic on port 4556.
All the IP address renaming happens on the networking switch
in real time. The checksums were then checked before the
packet left the switch and were updated if necessary.

10.10.10.[30-39, 100]

Once the P4 code was compiled and uploaded to the SDN
switch, we were ready to start. We enabled the hardware
ports, wrote the switching tables, and manually configured the
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables (statically) between
the machines. An example of the hardware ports and switching
tables are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Each port shown in
Figure 3 connects to another computer with a corresponding
IP address to Table I. For example, port 1 could be connected
to the machine with IP address 10.10.10.100 and port
2 is connected to machine with IP address 10.10.10.1.
These addresses might change per test group performed due
to computer malfunctions and/or limitations. Figure 4 tells the
switch where to send the packet depending on its destination
address via port number. Terminology overlaps here where
the port number in Figure 3 is the hardware cage and lane
number used. The port number in Figure 4 connects with the
D P column for Device Port (logical pipe) in Figure 3.

Once operational, preliminary tests were conducted of the
P4 software using a packet creation software called Scapy via
[6] before adding in the DTN implementation. Following Table
I, the results showed that the code alters packets only if it was
a UDP bundle on port 4556 and all other UDP and TCP
packets were switched as normal.
III. SDN MANUALLY LOAD BALANCING ION TO ION
The users from each endpoint should be hidden from the
knowledge that their packet destination was altered in the
middle of its way to the destination. Hence, between IP
addresses ending between .1 and .10, packets are switched
without modification. Between .2 and .20 the switch changes
the source of .2 to .1 or the destination (if packet is coming
from .20) to .1. For a visual of this, see Figure 5. Here, the
switch shows that it can manually load balance based on what
IP address it came from by changing the destination address.
However, due to how Linux’s TCP/IP stack is designed and a
computer malfunctioning, the DTN implementation tests were
broken up between simple switching and modified switching;
see Figure 2 for details of each DTN implementation link
tested.
The ION implementation’s version of bpchat was used to
test link connection but was also verified with Wireshark via
[7]; this software is often used diagnostically to send text mes-
sages over bundles. Because the ARP was not implemented in
P4, the ARP tables were manually edited to establish the links.
The first test completed used simple UDP switching with an
UDP destination port equaling 4556. This test had no changes
to the IP and hardware addresses as expected. See results in
Figure 6.

Figure 7. Modified Switching with the SDN Switch.
The second test required the SDN switch to modify the
packets and kept the UDP destination port as 4556. For
bpchat to work, it required IPv4 and UDP checksums to be
correct at the receiving node. The address changes are shown
in Figure 7 and follow Table I.
The last test of the manual load balancing efforts with
the Aurora 710 network switch found throughput limitations
for each DTN link. This was to give a baseline prior to
sending traffic from two DTN nodes to a single recipient DTN
node with HDTN. Typical performance-measuring tools for
DTN, and particularly ION, include bpdriver and bpsink,
which can send fixed numbers of bundles or stream bundle
continuously. Both are designed to work as quickly as possible.
These results are shown in Table II. At 1000 bundles the
TTL value was hit. We recall that in the context of DTN, TTL

is not hop-based, but rather time-based. The tool bpdriver
uses a default value of 30 seconds. The SDN switch was able
to send each packet through but the destination DTN node
could not process as many before the TTL expired. This shows
that the DTN implementation used is asymmetric with itself
and that in this scenario for 1000 bundles, a node to node
link fails. In addition, the results show that the network works
loss-free when the nodes are not at their maximum capacity.
We will be using the 1000 bundle case, which fails here, to
compare against HDTN.
IV. BALANCING MULTIPLE DTN NODES WITH HDTN
The DTN implementation transmitting machine names for
these tests are named Rho (with IP address ending in .1) and
Omicron (with IP address ending in .2). The HDTN node
resides on Eta with an IP address of 10.10.10.100. The
Aurora 710 network switch will be between the ION nodes
and the HDTN node. Here the HDTN node should only see
packets from 10.10.10.1 and therefore will be listening for
only that IP, as shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8. DTN to HDTN Load Balancing Overview.
The HDTN node was configured first to non-volatile stor-
age. Once results were received, bpsink capabilities were
tested. No differences of the results proved one configuration
was more ideal than the other for these tests with ION.
For a preliminary test of DTN to HDTN, the same test of
Table II was conducted except Eta was configured with HDTN.
The results brought forth all successes for both ION node
links. In addition, when both ION nodes were transmitting
1000 bundles, the HDTN node received all as shown in Table
III. Since the previous results of the DTN implementation used
had failures (as described in Section III), the PASS results for
HDTN under the same conditions are prodigious.
The

sends
its
first
bundle
twice
which does not pose counting issues with its counterpart,
bpcounter. Since HDTN counts every packet going to
storage, even if it is a duplicate, it counts that first packet
from both transmitting DTN nodes. This results in the extra
two packets counted at the receiver.

V. CONCLUSION
With increasing network throughput and capability needs,
bottlenecks are important to avoid. Therefore, it is crucial to
circumvent performance restrictions of the network. Thank-
fully, some options have been found for DTN implementation
nodes. Manually load balancing packets with a SDN switch
and/or using an HDTN receiver node instead are both viable
options for the modern network system.
A benefit to utilizing a SDN switch is that it can handle
many different types of networking protocols at line rates.
This would enable current and future networks in space to
be harnessed with one simple device. The downside is that a
SDN switch is not an all-in-one solution since it is unable to
create packets to be sent. This would be where a HDTN node
plays a key role. It is designed to work with the long latencies
and intermittent connections in space. Since its framework
is light, it can process and send much faster than current
DTN implementations i.e. ION. However, HDTN is a newer
implementation that is still in the process of interoperability
testing with other DTN implementations such as ION and
DTNME. While HDTN is a complete bundle agent, there
is a smaller subset of applications and features compared
to the larger implementations that have been in use longer.
Due to HDTN being still new, it uses modern dependencies
and programming techniques. An ideal scenario would be to
make use of both, a HDTN and a SDN switch, at each node.
This will enable a very intelligent, fast, and expansion-enabled
network.
SDN
development
continues
to
provide
solutions
to
100Gbps data rates for HDTN. Current research in teaching
the Aurora network switch platform how to automatically
load balance traffic between ports without the need of the IP
changes hard-coded into the P4 code continues. In addition,
future work will incorporate the bundle egress to neighboring
node and finding limitations to HDTN’s capabilities.

Abstract - A miniaturized selective composite microstrip Band Pass 
Filter (BPF) with a 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 52.5% (14.2 GHz 
to 
24.5 GHz) 
with 
wide 
upper 
stop-band 
for 
satellite 
communication (SATCOM) application is proposed. The design 
consists of a composite BPF implanted with a pair of quarter-
wavelength open-circuited stub and spurline. These elements are 
combined to form a miniaturized filter with a compact occupied 
area of 0.72λg× 0.55 λg (≈ 0.26 cm2). The filter is simulated on 
0.008” (0.203 mm) Rogers 4003C with dielectric constant, ɛr=3.55 
using commercial full-wave electromagnetic simulator HFSS v16. 
Simulated results show that BPF has resonant frequency (f0) as 
14.2 GHz and wide (>3f0) stop band without increasing the circuit 
size. Further, Spurline behaves as notch filter to suppress the first 
harmonics (or second pass band) of the proposed BPF.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
     Band Pass Filters (BPFs) have found numerous applications 
in satellite communication and play a vital role in several 
microwave and Radio Frequency (RF) applications. A high 
filtering performance, compact size, wide bandwidth, low 
insertion loss, wide upper stop-band and low cost are amongst 
the desired criteria while designing a band-pass filter [1].  In 
recent time, a significant amount of research work has been 
going on to design a compact BPF with high selectivity and 
good stop band performance for Ku/K band applications. Due 
to scarcity of the bandwidth in lower bands and availability in 
higher bands, the Ku/K band has become very popular for 
various satellite communication (SATCOM) applications [2]. 
     Significant studies have been done over the past few years 
on the design of wideband band pass filters for Ku/K frequency 
bands using microstrip and Substrate Integrated Waveguide 
(SIW) [3] technology. Xu et al. [4] projected a Ku band BPF 
using folded feedlines and quarter-wavelength stepped-
impedance resonators to generate multiple coupling paths. Lin 
et al. [5] proposed a compact novel K band BPF based on 
Photonic Band Gap (PBG) structure. Owing to its slow-wave 
characteristics, the PBG structure reduces the filter size to one-
tenth of conventional filters with spurious free response and 
deep attenuation level. The filter design cascaded several PBG 
structures introducing a coupling gap. Recently, Navya et al. [6] 
proposed the design of a low-profile and broad band BPF for Ku 
band satellite applications which consisted of four λ/4 
transmission lines and two feed lines to connect the resonating 
lines. In addition, selective band-pass filters for Ku and K bands 
have been reported by [7] using folded SIW technology 
incorporating E shape slot in the middle septum. Also, a 
wideband band-pass filter for Ku band was proposed by [8] 
using multi-mode resonator Substrate Integrated Waveguide 
(SIW) technology. Nonetheless, these filters suffered from 
fabrication complexity due to metallic vias. Further, stop-band 
response was not very satisfactory. In 
the 
past, 
various 
researchers have proposed band pass filters, but either the 
design was quite complex with large size or it suffered from 
poor selectivity or poor stop band. The present work utilizes the 
expediency of open stubs and spurline with a composite band 
pass filter for realizing miniaturized selective band pass filter 
with wide stop-band. Also, the proposed filter is very easy to 
fabricate. The designs are simulated using electromagnetic 
(EM) simulator High Frequency Structure Simulation (HFSS) 
v.16 software [9].  
     Section I explains the introduction and literature review. The 
rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II explains the 
design of the composite band-pass filter by combing a low pass 
and high pass filter. Section III shows the effect of adding open 
stub on the composite band pass filter for better selectivity. 
Section IV discusses the effect of adding spurlines for 
enhancing stop band performance and, finally, Section V 
presents the conclusion of the proposed work.

II. DESIGN OF THE COMPOSITE BAND PASS FILTER 
      A wideband BPF can be designed by cascade of a Low Pass 
Filter (LPF) and a High Pass Filter (HPF) [10], as shown in 
Figure 1.  In this contribution, a stepped impedance structure 
has been used to design the LPF section as it occupies less area. 
The function of stepped impedance LPF is to attenuate the 
second pass-band (harmonics) in the upper stop-band. For 
attaining the high-pass characteristic, quarter-wave long short-
circuited stubs are tapped to the high-impedance sections of the 
low-pass filter to insert attenuation poles at DC. The objective 
of the proposed band pass filter is to achieve high selectivity and 
roll off rate.  
 
A. Design of Maximally Flat (Butterworth) Low Pass Filter 
(LPF) 
      A butterworth filter has advantage of having more linear 
phase response in the pass-band thereby able to provide better 
group delay performance. The column 2 gives element value 
(g)[10] for maximally flat LPF for N=5. The width and lengths 
of hi –low impedance sections for maximally flat Low Pass 
filter (LPF) with cutoff frequency (fc) = 24 GHz, Filter order (N) 
= 5, substrate RT Roger 4003 (ɛr = 3.55) and substrate height 
(h) = 0.203 mm is calculated using [11] and is given below in 
table 1. We have considered Zl (low impedance value) = 20 Ω, 
Zh (high impedance value) =120 Ω, and characteristic 
impedance, Ro=50 Ω. The electrical length (βl) for C is found 
using expression 
C
Ro × Zl  and for L, it is given as  
𝐿
𝑍ℎ × 𝑅𝑜 . The 
overall dimensions of LPF are:  Length, L = 4.4 mm and Width, 
W = 4.0 mm.

          Figure 3 shows the frequency response of LPF. From the 
graph, it is clear that the LPF possess cutoff frequency of 24 
GHz.

B. Shorted Stub as High Pass Filter (HPF)  
      To realize the lower frequency stop-band, quarter-wave 
short circuited stubs are used with metallic via at the open end 
of the stub which acts as HPF section of the composite BPF. The 
length of shorted stub is λg/4 (λg : guided wavelength) which 
turns out to be 1.8 mm for lower cutoff frequency (fl). 
C. Design of Composite Band Pass Filter 
      To design a composite band pass filter, a High Pass Filtering 
(HPF) section need to be combined with Low Pass Filtering 
(LPF) section. The quarter wavelength (λg/4) long short 
circuited stubs act as HPF. After examining various orientations 
of shorted stubs, it was found that the shorted stubs placed in 
alternating positions as shown in Figure 4, gave satisfactory 
response. The value of various design parameters are as follows: 
diameter (D) =0.25 mm, width (W5) = 0.5 mm and length (L5) 
= 2.6 mm.  The overall dimension of the filter is 6 mm x 4.4 
mm.

         Figure 5 depicts the frequency response of the composite 
BPF. From graph it can be seen that the filter center frequency 
(fo) is 18.5 GHz with % Fractional Bandwidth (FBW) of 48%. 
Further, there appears first harmonic placed near 2fo in the stop 
band which results in poor stopband performance. Also, the 
selectivity of the filter is quite poor.

III. COMPOSITE BAND PASS FILTER INTEGRTAED 
WITH OPEN STUBS 
         To improve the stop band performance and enhance the 
selectivity of the proposed elliptic filter, open stubs of length 
λg/4 are placed opposite to the shorted stubs, as shown in Figure

                        Figure 6. Band-pass Filter with open stubs 
      To generate a band notch in an Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) 
BPF, Shaman et al. [12] has proposed the concept of embedded 
open-circuit stub. The notch effect occurs when the length of 
open stub is quarter wavelength long [13]. The resonant 
behavior of λg/4   open-stub can be explained by the equivalent 
circuit as shown in Figure 7.  
 
 
Figure 7. Equivalent circuit of open stub 
 
From the transmission line theory, input impedance for the 
open-stub is given as:

          From (1), the impedance of open-sub is low at integer 
multiple (n λg/4 ) of resonant frequency thus achieving band-
stop or notch characteristics. Also, open stub introduces one 
Transmission Zero (TZ) augmenting the selectivity of the filter 
by suppressing the undesired harmonic [14]. The length of the 
open stub to suppress first spurious responses (located near 
twice of the fundamental frequency) is calculated to be:   
L6=1.55 mm. The width W6 is kept at 0.30 mm.                     
Figure 8 depicts the frequency response of composite BPF 
embedded with open stubs. From the curve, it is apparent that 
the center frequency (fo) of the band pass filter is 19.6 GHz with 
FBW calculated to be 54.6%.

Figure 8. Frequency response of band pass filter with open stubs 
       Also it is evident from frequency response that the first 
harmonic (near 2fo) is suppressed up to -10 dB with the addition 
of open stubs, but still stop band performance is not satisfactory. 
IV. COMPOSITE BAND PASS FILTER INTEGRATED 
WITH OPEN STUBS AND SPURLINE 
       Generally, by cascading additional open stubs into 
microstrip filter, a wider and a deeper rejection can be achieved. 
The drawback of this method is high insertion loss in the 
passband and increased circuit size.  A spurline is realized by 
etching L shape slot on microstrip line exhibiting band-stop 
(notch) characteristics and also used for further suppressing the 
harmonics [15][16]. The spur-line filter consists of coupling 
between two microtrip lines. Figure 9 shows a spur-line filter 
configuration. Here, ‘A’ is the length of the spur-line and B is 
width of the microstrip line. 
 
Figure 9. Structure of spurline 
         
      Figure 10 shows the structure of the proposed band pass 
filter incorporating open stubs and spurline. All the dimensions 
in this layout have been mentioned earlier.

Figure 10. Band pass filter with open stub and spurline 
       Figure 11 shows the parametric analysis of spurline for 
various lengths. The length of spurline (A) is calculated by using 
parametric analysis and it is found that first harmonic (fo = 38.5 
GHz) is well suppressed below -20 dB for spurline length (A) 
equal to 0.75 mm.  
 
Figure 11. Parametric analysis of spurline for various lengths 
      Figure 12 shows the frequency response of final proposed 
band pass filter with open stubs and spurline. It is evident from 
the response that filter has pass-band from 14.2 GHz to 24.5 
GHz with center frequency (fo) at 19.2 GHz and % FBW  
calculated to be 52.5%. As can be seen from Figure 12, that   
additional attenuation is achieved at the first harmonic 
frequency by the incorporation of the spur line without 
increasing the circuit size. The harmonic at 38.5 GHz (2fo) is 
suppressed from -10 dB to -22 dB with the spurline band-stop 
filter (BSF).  
     Hence, an improvement in suppression of 12 dB is achieved 
and out-of-band rejection level is ≥ 20 dB.

V. CONCLUSION 
       In this paper, a microstrip composite BPF is proposed and 
simulated using shunt open stubs and spurlines. Basically, open-
stub section helps in achieving a wide rejection bandwidth. 
Further, Spurline with its inherently compact characteristics is 
inserted on input/output feed-lines that introduce attenuation 
pole to further suppress the higher harmonic mode resulting in 
better rejection performance without increasing the size. The 
proposed filter has merit of compact size with good filtering 
properties and can be useful for various SATCOM applications.
