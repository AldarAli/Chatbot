VISUAL 2016
Foreword
The First International Conference on Applications and Systems of Visual Paradigms
(VISUAL 2016), held between November 13-17, 2016 - Barcelona, Spain was an inaugural event
in putting together complementary domains were visual approaches are considered in a
synergetic view.
Visual paradigms were developed on the basis of understanding the brain’s and eye’s
functions. They spread over computation, environment representation, autonomous devices,
data presentation, and software/hardware approaches. The advent of Big Data, high speed
images/camera, complexity and ubiquity of applications and services raises several requests on
integrating visual-based solutions in cross-domain applications.
We take here the opportunity to warmly thank all the members of the VISUAL 2016
Technical Program Committee, as well as the numerous reviewers. The creation of such a high
quality conference program would not have been possible without their involvement. We also
kindly thank all the authors who dedicated much of their time and efforts to contribute to
VISUAL 2016. We truly believe that, thanks to all these efforts, the final conference program
consisted of top quality contributions.
Also, this event could not have been a reality without the support of many individuals,
organizations, and sponsors. We are grateful to the members of the VISUAL 2016 organizing
committee for their help in handling the logistics and for their work to make this professional
meeting a success.
We hope that VISUAL 2016 was a successful international forum for the exchange of
ideas and results between academia and industry and for the promotion of progress in the area
of visual oriented technologies.
We are convinced that the participants found the event useful and communications very
open. We also hope the attendees enjoyed the charm of Barcelona, Spain.

Abstract—In this paper, we describe an ontology-based system 
to inventory and model installed sensor and respective data 
processing resources on-board airborne surveillance aircrafts. 
The algorithms are packaged and described in form of discrete 
processing modules, each representing a low level image 
processing step. While the implementation of the algorithms is 
kept detached in a separate library, the description of modules 
and its parameters are stored in an ontology, representing a 
knowledge database using Web Ontology Language as a 
knowledge representation language. Based on the module 
description stored in the knowledge database, it is possible to 
identify and manage processing chains capable of solving 
complex image processing tasks. 
Keywords-Ontology; Web Ontology Language (OWL); Image 
Processing Management; Knowledge Management; sensor and 
data ressources.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Presently we witness an increasing demand for highly 
automated deployment of heterogeneous sensors on-board 
unmanned aircraft, either to yield better environmental 
awareness in the context of collision free flight or, as in the 
given case, to conduct typical Intelligence, Surveillance & 
Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in a more automated fashion, 
thereby relying mostly on imaging sensors operating in 
various spectral regions. However in aviation space, power 
and processing resources are limited. Therefore it is 
necessary to work economically with resources and manage 
them in an intelligent way. Furthermore, the sensor data 
processing and evaluation on-board a flying platform takes 
place under changing circumstances for example resulting 
from changing position and orientation of the Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicle (UAV), varying lighting conditions and 
different surface backgrounds (e.g., rural, urban, maritime). 
To cope with this situation it is meaningful to have a wide set 
of different sensors and associated data processing 
algorithms, since there is no algorithm that performs in an 
adequate way in every situation. For a complex image 
processing task (e.g., vehicle- and person detection) there are 
several equal processing steps, which have to be executed for 
each task, e.g., preprocessing steps or region-of-interest 
(ROI) selection. When executing multiple tasks one can save 
resources and computational time reusing the processing 
steps, which are required repeatedly instead of starting the 
same algorithm multiple times. Thus, there is a need for a 
system that manages sensor resources and image processing 
capabilities in a meaningful way. The Institute of Flight 
Systems published several papers ([1]–[5]) on the topic of 
airborne sensor- and perception management. In this paper 
we now focus on the ontology based knowledge extension of 
the so called Sensor and Perception Management System 
(S&PMS), first introduced in [4]. 
The S&PMS is best described as a three layer 
architecture to inventory relevant resources (e.g., sensors and 
image processing algorithms) and manage their usage as 
shown in Figure 1.

Management System. 
One of the S&PMS’s key aspects is the module based 
approach to package image processing algorithms into 
perception modules. Each module fulfils a special low level 
image processing requirement, e.g., noise reduction or ROI. 
Modules are designed to be standalone or to be combined 
with different modules to solve a higher level image 
processing task (perception task), like vehicle detection 
within a given street segment. The combination of at least 
two low level modules or a sensor-module combination 
creates a perception chain. Eventually a considerable variety 
of different perceptions chains (redundant chains) results, 
which potentially solve the same perception task, based on 
the (sensor) configuration of the UAV and the available 
perception modules. This entirety of resources (modules, 
sensors, etc.) and possible combinations is called perception 
graph. Such graph can be used to visualize all possible chain 
combinations for different perception tasks.

Figure 2. illustrates the relationship between sensors, the 
perception- modules, chains and graph. The graph is 
represented by the infrared (IR) / electro-optical (EO) sensor, 
all rectangles, each one providing a different low level 
capability, and their connections. Furthermore, there are two 
different perception chains in the figure to detect, e.g., a car 
from on-board the aircraft, sharing the first and last module 
(blue and orange rectangles). Both chains can use either an 
electro-optical sensor or an infrared sensor. 
Packaging image processing algorithms into perception 
modules 
allow 
the 
interpretation 
of 
algorithms 
as 
capabilities. It also supports reusability and therefore limits 
the power consumption and processing power onboard 
UAVs. Figure 2. shows several approaches to achieve the 
same goal (e.g., detecting a vehicle). A goal oriented usage 
of perception chains is enabled through detailed descriptions 
of the modules containing:  
 
 
What is the output of a module (Capabilities) 
 
How can a module be combined in a 
meaningful way (Requirements) 
 
Under which circumstances can a module be 
used (Constraints) 
 
Furthermore, there is a need for a managing entity that 
loads and interprets the module descriptions to create 
relational knowledge. Such knowledge is used to identify the 
availability of low level and high level capabilities 
depending on given circumstances. The statements also 
provide information about possible module combinations to 
create perception chains that provide high level capabilities 
(HLCs). These high level capabilities in turn can be used to 
achieve different perception tasks. 
In this paper we therefore propose an ontology based 
approach, using the knowledge representation language 
OWL, that has been first introduced in [1], to create a 
knowledge database. This knowledgebase can be inferred by 
a reasoning mechanism to create statements, describing 
which resources are available and how they can be used. 
This paper is structured as follows: The structure and 
concept of the presented ontology is being explained in 
section 2. In section 2.A the class taxonomy is being 
presented. Next, in section 2.B we will describe the 
differences between persistent and dynamic individuals. In 
section 2.C we get into detail with the resource-capability-
resource concept. The data and object properties are 
discussed in section 2.D. In the last part of section 2 we 
describe the rules of the Semantic Web Rules Language 
(SWRL). In section 3 the experimental evaluation and results 
are being presented. First, in section 3.A we show how we 
realize the identification of available high level capabilities. 
Next, in section 3.B methods to provide valid perception 
chains are being exposed. In section 3.C we discuss the 
results for a proof-of-concept ontology. In section 4 there is a 
conclusion and an outlook into future work. 
II. 
STRUCTURE AND CONCEPT OF THE ONTOLOGY 
The ontology has been created using the Web Ontology 
Language OWL [6]. Three versions of OWL are available:  
 
 
OWL Lite, very inexpressive and mostly used 
just to create taxonomies  
 
OWL DL (description logic), suitable for 
practical applications    
 
OWL Full, too expressive creating situations, 
where the inference mechanism will loop 
infinitely (see [6] for details). 
Since OWL DL is widespread and has an advanced tool 
and library support it is used to model the presented 
ontology. OWL contains three main concepts to model 
information: classes (concepts), individuals (instances) and 
properties (roles).   
A. Class Taxonomy 
The OWL classes serve as group container for different 
types of individuals (In OWL individuals are instances of 
(real) objects that belong to special class, e.g., “Sony CBR” 
is an individual of the class “Sensor”). There are two ways 
how an individual can be assigned to a class:  
 
1. 
When an individual is loaded into the ontology it 
gets its main class (e.g., an electro optical sensor 
would belong to the class “EOSensor” (Figure 3. 
)).  
2. 
The individual gets additional class assignments by 
the inference mechanism.  
 
Our ontology has six top level classes: 
Concept: contains the definition of the high and low 
level capabilities. Low level capabilities (LLC) are split into 
more detailed groups, for example sensor-, image 
processing- and platform capabilities. LLCs are provided by 
resources 
like 
perception 
modules 
or 
sensors. 
Simultaneously, each module needs a predefined set of LLCs 
as input so it can work as intended. The input LLC required 
by a module though is different to the LLC that is provided 
by this module. High level capabilities are used by 
perception tasks, which can be commanded from a third 
party system. The more detailed subdivision is based on the 
taxonomy presented in [7]. 
Environment: covers all individuals to describe the 
composition of the ground, daytime, weather and lighting 
conditions (e.g., sky formations). 
Hardware: describes the sensors and sensor mountings 
that are attached to the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle or another 
platform. Subdivision categories of the sensor class are radar, 
thermal, optical, laser and virtual sensor.

Platform: includes the classes that describe the user of 
the S&PMS. The subcategories are aerial platform, ground 
platform and human team. 
Software: implies the image processing algorithms 
represented as perception modules and other services (e.g., a 
geo information service (GIS Service)). 
Status: This class is empty when the S&PMS is started. 
It states if any individual is available and can be used or not. 
The inference mechanism assigns each individual to its status 
class. E.g., if a module can provide a certain low level 
capability the module is assigned to the “operative module” 
class and the capability that is provided by this module to the 
“available low level capability” class. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Taxonomy of the ontology.  
Figure 3. illustrates the taxonomy of the ontology. In total 
there are 123 classes. 
B. Persistent and dynamic individuals 
The concept of the ontology takes two different 
behaviors of individuals into account: the persistent 
individuals are always a part of the ontology and dynamic 
loaded individuals, based on the connected systems. The 
ontology itself contains only high and low level capabilities 
and their assigned SWRL Rules (see section E.). These 
capabilities are modelled by an expert and remain persistent 
in the database. When the S&PMS is loaded or services and 
sensors are connected to the S&PMS, the represented 
individuals (e.g. Sony Sensor1) are loaded into the ontology. 
If a sensor stops working or a perception module crashes, the 
representative individual is removed from the ontology. As 
soon as the system notices a change in the ontology the 
“reasoner” gets invoked to update the overall status of the 
ontology and notify the S&PMS about system changes. 
Depending on services and sensors connected, and with 
respect to requirements and constraints of perception 
modules that are modelled using SWRL Rules, different low 
and high level capabilities, sensors and modules are 
unlocked. The reasoner infers, using SWRL rules and OWL 
axioms, which individuals can be assigned to the status 
classes mentioned before in section A. 
C. The resource-capability-resource concept 
Since there are individuals that are added and removed 
from the ontology in a frequent way during runtime, it is not 
possible to make a statement about available individuals. For 
this reason you can never tell, which resources (e.g., 
modules, sensors, etc.) are currently available hence it is not 
possible to connect two individuals directly. Therefore we 
introduced the resource-capability-resource concept with 
permanent capability individuals that are always a part of the 
ontology and therefore can be used as a reference to create 
rules for individuals that are dynamically added to the 
ontology. These permanent low level capability individuals 
can be seen as input and output configurations for image 
processing modules or other resources.

Figure 4.  Resource-capability-resource vs. resource-resource connection.  
Figure 4. illustrates the difference between the direct 
connection of resources and the usage of capability 
individuals between two resources. In (a) the sensor and 
module are connected directly. Removing the targeted sensor 
(EO Sensor) implies removing the rule from the source 
module (RGB Receiver), because there is no more reference 
to the target. Re-adding the targeted sensor does however not 
imply adding the rule to the source module since the source 
module does not get notified about the existence of the 
targeted sensor. Another reason against solution (a) is the 
fact that during modelling time of e.g., RGB Receiver there is 
no knowledge about other resources like sensors or modules. 
So it would not be possible to create a rule that connects both 
resources since there is no way to get the information of the 
existence of e.g., EO Sensor.  
In (b) each resource holds rules connected to a capability-
individual. In this case, when EO Sensor gets deleted, only 
rules included in EO Sensor get removed and no other 
resource is “touched”. When EO Sensor gets added again, its 
rules get added too. Since the individual RGBData is a 
permanent individual that is always a part of the ontology, 
rules that are used by RGB Receiver can reference it. Using 
the inference mechanism a “uses” relationship between the 
sensor and the module can be established.   
D. Data and Object properties 
In OWL we see two different property types, the object 
and the data properties. Data properties are used to connect 
individuals with their data represented as parameters. These 
parameters can be of different built-in types, e.g., string, 
integer, byte, date or bool. In our ontology, data properties 
are used to describe the parameters of an image processing 
algorithm and other numeric information.

VISUAL 2016 : The First International Conference on Applications and Systems of Visual Paradigms

Object properties are used to describe relationships 
between individuals. The most common property is the “is-
a” relation between classes (e.g., UAV is-a Aircraft). Each 
object property has several characteristics that can be 
assigned to it to affect its functional role (e.g., functional, 
transitive, reflexive, etc.). Additional information can be 
found in [8]. Within the framework there are four main 
object properties and their inverses (TABLE I. ).

OBJECT PROPERTIES: LEFT: PROPERTY, RIGHT: INVERSE 
PROPERTY.

The first two describe the relationship between a module 
and its capabilities. The third and fourth describe the 
relationship between modules and the relationship within 
capabilities. The “is-a”-property to connect individuals with 
its classes or classes with subclasses is not listed, because it 
is not a custom property but a basic property that is 
available in every ontology. 
Figure 5. illustrates a usage of the different object 
properties to describe the relationship between the 
individuals and their classes. For clarity the inverse 
properties are omitted.

E. SWRL Rules 
To grant OWL more flexibility and expressive strength it 
is possible to use rule based languages in combination with 
the rule markup language (RuleML). Semantic Web Rule 
Language (SWRL) [9] can be seen as a combination of OWL 
DL and RuleML. A rule in SWRL is defined as follows: 
 
𝑎1^𝑎2^ … ^𝑎𝑛 → 𝑏1^𝑏2^ … ^𝑏𝑛                 (1) 
 
Variables are called atoms. While 𝑎𝑖  describes a 
precondition (body), 𝑏𝑖  describes a post condition (head). 
Atoms can be class expressions ( 𝐶(𝑥) ) or property 
expressions (𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦)), in other words relationships between 
two individuals. There are built in expressions that can be 
used to model a rule. Some of them are 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑒𝐴𝑠(𝑥, 𝑦), 
𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝐹𝑟𝑜𝑚(𝑥, 𝑦) and 𝑏𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑛(𝑟, 𝑧1 …  𝑧𝑛) . Built in 
expressions 
contain but 
are 
not 
limited 
to: date, 
mathematical, string operation. A rule can be read as:  
 
“If precondition X is true, then the post condition is also 
true.” 
 
An empty precondition is always true, an empty post 
condition always false. All rules that can be accomplish with 
the OWL axioms can also be modelled with SWRL rules, on 
the other side there are SWRL rules that cannot be 
accomplish with OWL axioms. 
Each individual that is added dynamically by a service 
into the ontology contains its own SWRL rule set. Since the 
capabilities-individuals of the ontology are permanently 
stored in the database immutable, the SWRL Rules can refer 
to the individual’s names of the capabilities but not to the 
names of other individuals like sensors or modules.  
The SWRL rule belonging to Module C of Figure 5. can 
be written as follows: 
 
AvailableLLC(Cap A) ^ capabilityProvidedBy(Cap A, ?a)           
 → AvailableModule(Module C) ^                                                  (2) 
uses(Module C, ?a) ^ providesCapability(Module C, Cap C) 
 
In SWRL “?x” is being used to declare variables. The 
rule reads as: 
 
“If the individual Cap A belongs to the class 
AvailableLLC and  the individual Cap A has the object 
property capProvidedBy, referencing to any other individual 
?a then assign Module C to the class AvailableModule and 
assign the object property uses referencing to any other 
individual ?a to the Module C and the object property 
providesCap Cap C.” 
 
Since there are two other modules that provide Cap A, 
Module C will belong to the classes “Module” and 
“AvailableModule” and will have the object property “uses 
Module B” and “uses Module A” and also have the object 
property “providesCap Cap C”. If another module or a 
perception task intends to use “Cap C”, there are two 
perception chains that can be used:  
 
 
Module B → Module C 
 
Module A → Module C 
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION 
The evaluation of the ontology comprises two categories. 
It is necessary to know (see section III.A) if at least one 
perception chain exists, that can solve a given perception 
task or respectively can provide a high level capability. Next 
it is necessary to (see section III.B) investigate if all available 
perception chains for a given HLC are valid and if all 
possible solutions have been found. Therefore some proof of

VISUAL 2016 : The First International Conference on Applications and Systems of Visual Paradigms

concept experiments have been done to validate that the 
identification of HLCs and the perception chains work as 
expected.  
A. Identifying available high level capabilities 
Testing to check if the ontology identifies available 
HLCs correctly, can be accomplished directly in the widely 
used ontology editor Protegé [10]. As mentioned in Figure 3. 
there is a special class category “Status”, more accurate 
“AvailableHLC” where an HLC individual gets assigned by 
the reasoner when there is a perception chain that provides 
this individual. This evaluation includes several SWRL rules 
for chain components that have to be tested. Each chain 
component should work self-contained and in combination 
with other components. Each component requires a positive 
and a negative test. The positive test describes a situation 
where the configuration of the ontology provides individuals 
that should allow the reasoner to assign a given HLC to the 
“AvailableHLC” class. For the negative test, the ontology 
gets changed in a way, that there is no valid path anymore to 
assign the HLC to the “AvailableHLC” class.

Figure 6.  Five chain components that can appear during modelling 
perception chains.  
Figure 6. illustrates five different chain components that 
can appear in the modelling phase of HLCs. For each 
component there are different SWRL rules to achieve a 
desired behavior. The illustration shows a very simple setup 
starting with the sensor, using one layer of perception 
modules and connecting it with the HLCs. 
(a) is the most simple component where the HLC does 
need only one capability. The HLC does not care, which or 
how many modules there are, providing this capability, as 
long as there is at least one module available. The rule looks 
like: 
 
AvailableLLC(Capability) ^ capProvidedBy(Capability,  
?a) → AvailableModule(HLC) ^ uses(HLC, ?a)                         (3)                
 
(b) illustrates a component where the HLC can be 
activated either by “Capability A” or “Capability B”. The 
rule is similar to listing (3) but in this case there is the need 
for two SWRL Rules, one for “CapabilityA” and the other 
for “CapabilityB”: 
 
AvailableLLC(Capability A) ^ capProvidedBy(Capability   
A, ?a) → AvailableModule(HLC) ^ uses(HLC, ?a)      
                                                                                                         (4) 
AvailableLLC(Capability B) ^ capProvidedBy(Capability   
B, ?a) → AvailableModule(HLC) ^ uses(HLC, ?a)                   
              
In 
(c) 
there 
is 
an 
“and”-relationship 
between 
“CapabilityA” and “CapabilityB”. The HLC does need both 
capabilities to get classified as “AvailableHLC”. In Figure 6. 
there are two possible configurations: (Module A ˄ Module 
C) and (Module B ˄ Module C). The corresponding rule is: 
 
AvailableLLC(Capability A) ^ AvailableLLC(Capability B) 
 ^ capProvidedBy(Capability A,?a) ^ capProvidedBy               
(Capability B, ?b) → AvailableModule(HLC) ^                             (5) 
uses(HLC, ?a) ^ uses(HLC, ?b)      
                                                                                               
(d) shows a more restrictive component. Here it is not 
enough that there is a perception module that provides 
“Capability A”; there is also the restriction that the module 
that provides “Capability A” should also use “Capability B”. 
This guarantees that only the combination (Sensor ˄ Module 
A) but not the combination (Sensor X ˄ Module B) is a valid 
chain. 
 
AvailableLLC(Capability A) ^ AvailableLLC(Capability B) 
 ^ capProvidedBy(Capability A,?a) ^  capProvidedBy               
(Capability B, ?b)^ uses(?a,?b) →                                                  (6) 
AvailableModule(HLC) ^ uses(HLC, ?a)  
 
The rule in listing (6) looks similar to listing (5), expect 
that in (6) there is a “uses(?a,?b)” in the body that 
determines that individual “?a” that also provides 
“Capability A” has to use individual “?b”, which also 
provides “Capability B”. 
 (e) illustrates a exception where the HLC does need both 
capabilities “Capability A” and “Capability B”. But in this 
case it must be guaranteed that data, which is used by the 
modules providing both capabilities, must be from the same 
sensor. 
 
AvailableLLC(Capability A) ^ AvailableLLC(Capability B) ^ 
AvailableLLC(Capability C) ^ AvailableLLC(Capability D) ^ 
capProvidedBy(Capability A, ?a) ^ capProvidedBy(Capability B, 
?b) ^ capProvidedBy(Capability C, ?d) ^                                       (7) 
capProvidedBy(Capability D, ?e) ^ uses(?a,?c) ^  
uses(?b,?c) → AvailableModule(HLC) ^ uses(HLC, ?a) ^  
uses(HLC, ?b) 
 
To realize the behavior shown in (e) it is necessary to 
introduce another variable “?c” representing an individual. 
This individual has to be used by both modules, the ones that 
provide “Capability A” and the others that provide 
“Capability B”. If “Capability C” would be provided only by 
“Sensor” and “Capability D” would be provided only by 
“Sensor X” all capability and perception module individuals 
would be available but the HLC would still be not available 
because the rule “uses(?a,?c) ^ uses(?b,?c)” from listing (7) 
would be false.

B. Provide valid perception chains 
After collecting information about available high level 
capabilities it is necessary to verify that the provided 
combinations of perception modules (in form of perception 
chains) result in the correct outcome. The list of existing 
perception chains for a specific HLC does not allow chains 
that cannot handle the perception task. Therefore the chain 
count as well as the chain composition is tested against an 
expert model. All valid chains must be represented. The 
concatenation and validation of modules into perception 
chains is done outside the ontology in a special application 
that can read, write and parse the ontology. The algorithm 
checks the dependency from one individual to another, 
starting with the HLC individuals. Recursively each 
dependency is put into a list (the perception chain list). If an 
individual has more than one dependency, the chain gets 
split. The process ends, when an individual has no more 
dependencies to other individuals. Individual can have 
multiple SWRL rules, resulting in equal chains. During the 
concatenation process chains can arise that are formally 
correct but not valid for the specific HLC since not all low 
level capabilities can be satisfied within the chain. After the 
recursive process terminates, duplicates and invalid chains 
are filtered. There are some cases where the algorithm cannot 
filter all invalid chains due to rule complexity. In these cases, 
special data properties are parsed after the initial validation. 
Whichever parameters are set, special filtering mechanisms 
are being triggered inside the application to erase the 
remaining invalid chains. 
To guarantee that all valid chains have been found 
smaller ontologies can be manually matched against an 
expert design result. For bigger ontologies the complexity 
rises with each individual added. Above a certain ontology 
size it gets very difficult for an expert to observe all possible 
outcomes. It may also be the case that the inference 
mechanism discovers perception chains, which the expert did 
not intend to create. This outcome must also be checked 
against an expert’s design results manually. This can be an 
advantage since solution can arise that are more intelligent or 
less resource intensive. But it can also be a disadvantage due 
to the difficult way to evaluate the systems correct way of 
working. 
C. Proof of concept  
Based on the founding functions in A) and B) a more 
general proof of concept was conducted using the example 
depicted in Figure 6. . The perception graph obtained from 
the ontology is illustrated in Figure 7.

The system assumes all resources (sensors and modules) 
to be available and operational. From this point all available 
HLCs and their perception chains are calculated. Starting the 
reasoner, we can observe that all HLCs are available like 
expected (see TABLE II. (a)). 
       Next each sensor is deactivated until no HLC is 
available. Each step the perception chains are recalculated by 
the inference mechanism. The results can be observed in 
TABLE II. One can see that the modeled rules are working 
as anticipated: the available HLCs and chain count 
decreases.

In TABLE II (a) all sensors are available hence all

When deactivating “Sensor2” (cf. (c)) three modules are 
not operative any more since there is no sensor that can 
provide the required data respectively capabilities. As a 
hoped consequence “HLC3” and “HLC 4” is being 
deactivated and the chain count for the operative HLCs drops 
drastically. When “Sensor 3” is also being deactivated we 
can observer that in (d) “Module 4” stops working and there 
are no more available high level capabilities. 
TABLE III. TABLE IV. and TABLE V. list the possible 
module compositions for the results illustrated in TABLE II. 
(a), (b) and (c). In TABLE IV. one can see that no more 
chain compositions for Sensor 1 are available anymore. In 
TABLE V. only chain compositions using Sensor 3 are 
available since Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 are deactivated and for 
the other two sensors there are no perception chains. Overall 
the experiments show a supposed behavior of the inferred 
results taking the modeled relationship and SWRL rules into 
account. The results prove a suitable usage of the ontology to 
model sensor and data processing resources using OWL. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We presented an approach to manage sensor and data 
resources with an ontology based knowledge management 
system. It was shown how the knowledge representing 
language OWL can be used respectively. The presented 
solution proposes to model image processing algorithms as 
perception 
modules 
providing 
different 
low 
level 
capabilities, which in turn can be combined to high level 
capabilities, representing various perception tasks e.g., 
vehicle detection. For each task different perception chains 
are calculated, dependent on the current environmental 
situation 
and 
platform 
setup 
respectively 
resource 
configuration (sensors, algorithms, etc.). 
An important next step is to develop a decision-making 
system that takes available perception chains for a given 
perception task in account and determines, based on different 
parameters and meta-information, which chain is most 
suitable to solve the given task. 
The system shall be further tested in a multi UAV 
scenario where each UAV has a different sensor and 
perception module configuration. The aim here is to combine 
different capabilities onboard UAVs and let the UAVs 
collaborate to solve a complex perception task as a team. 
Eventually investigations are planned in human-machine 
scenario, where a helicopter operator can fall back to 
S&PMS functions that assist him during his mission and 
therefore reduce the operator’s workload. The operator can 
choose between different automation levels so that the 
S&PMS can process full perception tasks or only parts of it 
[11]. In this scenario, the human capabilities are a part of the 
knowledge base and are modeled into the ontology. The 
inference mechanism takes the human capabilities into 
account when generating perception chains for different 
perception tasks. For example, when there is no algorithmic 
way for a processing step, the S&PMS can make use of 
human capability to still find an adequate perception chain.

Abstract—The increasing interest in higher automation of 
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) rises the challenge of 
implementing sophisticated perception functions. Since 
such functions, whether being used for navigational (e.g., 
sense & avoid) or surveillance purposes (e.g., object 
detection & tracking), are heavily influenced by 
environmental conditions. Hence, a careful selection and 
parametrization of the perception functions during flight 
is required to maintain perceptual efficiency on-board 
the UAV. This paper introduces a method to predict the 
performance of perception functions, allowing a ranking 
for algorithm selection. The proposed method uses 
expert knowledge to model the influence of the 
environment on the perception functions using fuzzy 
logic. An evaluation of the proposed method is 
performed with an aerial vehicle detection algorithm on 
an imagery dataset, generated from virtual simulation, 
taking into account fog density and cloud cover. The 
results show that the method can predict the algorithms 
performance in general and has the advantage of 
expressive modelling of the expert knowledge. 
Keywords-Perception functions; fuzzy logic; algorithm 
selection; algorithm ranking; expert knowledge.

 INTRODUCTION 
The automation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 
navigation and guidance is an active research area. Further, 
the on-board analysis of mission sensor data is needed for 
environmental 
awareness 
and 
reconnaissance 
and 
surveillance missions. The anticipated benefit of higher 
levels of automation of UAVs is seen by reducing costs, 
being able to control multiple UAVs by a single operator, 
and deploying UAVs in areas where no infrastructure for 
communication and navigation is available. 
Mature data processing algorithms for UAV mission 
sensors are designed for specific use cases, for example often 
in the domain of object detection and tracking. Therefore, the 
algorithms regularly produce reliable results only under 
certain constraints. However, during UAV missions, the 
environment can change considerable for example in terms 
of ground surfaces, field of view, lighting conditions and 
atmospheric effects, influencing the sensor data quality, as 
well as the performance of data processing algorithms.  
Hence, a management of sensors and sensor data processing 
algorithms is advisable to assure the quality of the automated 
sensor data evaluation in the aforementioned application 
domains. 
For this purpose, a respective system concept was 
introduced in [1], namely the Sensor & Perception 
Management System (SPMS). Thereby, the SPMS selects 
appropriate sensor types, e.g., electro-optical (EO), infrared 
(IR), and light detection and ranging (LIDAR), and applies 
adequate sensor data processing algorithms to accomplish 
certain perception tasks, such as object detection, tracking, 
and obstacle recognition. Selecting and parametrizing 
perceptual 
capabilities 
according 
to 
the 
current 
environmental situation eventually results in maintaining 
algorithm performance. 
We developed a method to predict the quality or 
performance of such perceptual capabilities of the SPMS, 
allowing the ranking and selection of the best suited 
algorithms. In Section II, the related work is briefly shown 
and Section III presents an algorithm selection method using 
a weighting function based on fuzzy logic and compares its 
performance prediction for a selected vehicle detection 
algorithm with ground-truth obtained from an evaluation 
dataset. The results of our method are presented and 
discussed in Section IV. Section V closes the paper with a 
conclusion and future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Rice [2] formulated a general concept for the problem of 
selecting an algorithm from a set of algorithms. Using a case 
base, which contains cases from learning or observing 
successful executed tasks with their solution, is as a general 
methodology for algorithm selection and was proposed by 
[3]. A similarity measurement [4] compares the new task 
with the case base using the tasks problem description to 
select the appropriate solution. 
Hochgeschwender et al. [5] addressed the problem of 
selecting marker detection algorithms, based on image 
interest point detection, under different illuminations in an 
indoor scenario to maximize detection performance. During 
a training phase, the performance of the algorithms is 
evaluated and image histograms, as well as respective 
algorithm parameters, are stored whenever the performance 
seems reasonable. The selection algorithm uses the 
Kullback-Leibler divergence as measurement to compare the 
current image histogram with the saved ones to rank the 
algorithms.

An automatic selection approach for color constancy 
algorithms is proposed in [6]. They extract simple features 
from images and using a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference 
system to reason about the appropriate algorithm. Thereby, 
the fuzzy rules and sets are learned from example. 
In [7], an approach for selecting sensor processing 
algorithms with Bayesian networks is proposed. Here, the 
environmental and sensor requirements of the algorithms, as 
well as their implementation quality, is modelled to estimate 
the performance of the algorithms.  
A meta-learning approach is used by [8][9] for ranking 
the algorithms with a relative score, in respect of the 
algorithm with the highest score. They extract meta-features 
(e.g., mean illumination or noise-signal ratio of an imagery 
dataset) and evaluate the performance of the algorithms from 
the learning datasets. Afterwards, a meta-learner uses the 
performance and meta-features to derive a model, enabling 
the computing of relative performances of the algorithms on 
a new dataset. This method allows the automatic learning of 
an algorithm selection mechanism without the need for 
explicit expert knowledge as required in the here presented 
method. However, a sophisticated learning dataset must be 
provided to achieve reliable results. 
Other approaches [10]–[12] also model the algorithms 
constraints with expert knowledge and apply machine 
inferencing about the availability of the algorithms [13]. Our 
approach now uses the idea of modelling the environmental 
impact with probabilities [7], since they can be considered as 
not completely observable. It is realized with fuzzy logic 
where expert knowledge is mapped to fuzzy rules. The 
notation and concept introduced by [2] is used in this paper. 
III. 
METHOD 
The selection of an algorithm requires a ranking metric. 
In the proposed method, a weighting function predicts the 
performance of the algorithm with respect to a given 
perceptive task (e.g., vehicle detection), in dependency of a 
feature vector describing the actual environment state. The 
weighting function returns a normalized value, describing 
how successful a certain algorithm can be applied. Fig. 1 
shows an overview of the proposed algorithm selection 
method. The selection function takes the algorithm set and 
the environment state vector to choose an algorithm with a 
parameter set, in dependency of the calculated performance. 
Expert knowledge declare the impact of the environment 
state vector on the algorithms performance. 
The algorithm selection s  requires features

each algorithm

were chosen, because it is human understandable and 
machine-processible. In addition, since the environment is 
not completely observable, the if-then fuzzy logic rule 
notation is capable of modelling vague knowledge. Such 
fuzzy inference system requires the fuzzification of the input

center of the union of the areas is calculated to obtain the 
performance value. This work uses the Mamdani-type fuzzy 
inference [18], because of its expressional power which 
allows a clean modelling of expert knowledge as examined 
by [19]. 
IV. 
EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION 
On the basis of an aerial vehicle detection algorithm, 
developed by [20], an evaluation of the proposed method is 
performed. The vehicle detection algorithm uses weak 
classifiers in a cascade to detect vehicles with Haar-like 
image features and local binary pattern features. The 
variables describing the environment are the cloud cover and 
fog density of the scene as mentioned above. First, the 
average performance of the algorithm is determined with a 
ground-truth 
evaluation 
dataset 
obtained 
in 
virtual 
simulation, using Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3) [21]. The 
average performance is then compared with the output of the 
modelled fuzzy inference system to evaluate the precision of 
the weighting function. 
The dataset includes 22 scenarios from one VBS3 map 
with fixed cloud cover and fog density values from zero to 
one, where zero defines clear sky or no fog and one defines 
full cloud cover or dense fog. Fig. 3 shows some example 
images form the dataset. Each scenario consists of 7500 
images in 1920x1080 resolution with annotations of the 
vehicle locations. The parameters for the image generation 
are 50 meter distance from camera to the center of the image 
and an elevation of -45 degrees. These parameters where 
selected from the evaluation of the algorithm in [20], where 
the average performance has the highest score. The image 
generation process scans the scenarios in a grid with 
randomly selected azimuth angles and each vehicle from 
azimuth angles ranging from zero to 360 degrees. The 
vehicles, 50 per scenario, are randomly placed on the map. 
The vehicle detection algorithm is tested on each scenario to 
calculate a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to 
determine 
the 
algorithm’s 
average 
performance, 
in 
dependency of the cloud cover and fog density value 
separately.

The resulting ROC curves from the scenarios are shown 
in Fig. 4, where the area under the curve is the measurement 
for the average performance of the vehicle detection 
algorithm on the related scenario, and the circles mark the 
optimal operation point for the classifier. The upper plot in 
Fig. 4 shows the ROC curves for cloud cover and the one 
below for influences of the fog density. The scenarios to 
evaluate the cloud cover impact have zero fog density and 
the scenarios for evaluating the fog density impact have 50 
percent cloud cover. 
The fuzzy inference system calculates the prediction of 
the algorithm performance using as input the cloud cover and 
fog density and as output the performance. In Fig. 2 the

membership functions for the fuzzy variables are shown. The 
fuzzy rules can be read as follows: 
• 
If fog density is hardly and cloud cover is barely 
then performance is high 
• 
If fog density is hardly and cloud cover is partly then 
performance is high 
• 
If fog density is hardly and cloud cover is heavy then 
performance is very high 
• 
If fog density is moderate and cloud cover is barely 
then performance is high 
• 
If fog density is dense and cloud cover is barely then 
performance is average 
With increasing cloud cover, the average performance of 
the algorithm increases from 62 to 71 percent as depicted in 
the upper graph of Fig. 5. While the cloud cover increases, 
the appearance of shadows and the illumination decreases. 
Therefore, the algorithm is obviously robust against 
illumination changes and shadows. The error between the 
calculated performance and the predicted performance is 7.6 
percent. In the upper graph of Fig. 5 the error is the 
highlighted area between performance and prediction curve.

to 59 percent. Comparing the calculated performance with 
the predicted performance results in an error of 0.3 percent 
(see lower graph of Fig. 5). 
It can be observed, that the proposed method can in 
general describe the trend of environmental impact on the 
algorithm and is therefore useful for predicting the 
performance of the algorithm. The advantage of the proposed 
method is the clear description of the environmental 
influence, with fuzzy rules from expert knowledge, but the 
disadvantage is the lack in accuracy between the calculated 
and predicted performance. The introduction of a greater set 
of membership functions for the fuzzy variables can increase 
the accuracy, but it also increases the modelling effort and 
therefore, detailed expert knowledge is required, but it is 
unlikely that such detailed knowledge is available. Thus, we 
recommend a clear set of membership functions. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The management of perceptual capabilities requires the 
estimation of the performance of the underlying algorithms 
in dependency of the environmental state. In this paper, such 
performance prediction was demonstrated using a fuzzy 
logic approach. The results show, that it is possible to model 
the general influence of the environment state at the 
algorithm performance. 
In [6] image features where used to select the best 
algorithm via learning of an fuzzy inference system. In 
contrast to our approach, the image data must be available to 
select the algorithm, while our method can predict the 
algorithm performance without image data. Tenorth and 
Beetz [11] use expert knowledge to reason about the 
appropriate vision algorithm for a personal robot. Unlike our 
approach, 
they 
require 
detailed 
expert 
knowledge. 
Comparing our method with [5], the modelling of the 
environmental influences takes less effort, but the 
performance prediction accuracy is lower. In addition, when 
expert knowledge is not available, our method cannot be 
used. Therefore, in a next step, the missing expert knowledge 
shall be obtained by machine learning approaches to shape 
the membership function and generate fuzzy rules to enhance 
the performance prediction accuracy. For future evaluation, a 
larger scaled dataset will be generated to test learning 
approaches as well as suitable methods to determine the 
environmental state vector.

Abstract—In this paper, we present a new appearance based
feature descriptor, named Local edge/corner Feature Integra-
tion (LFI), which efﬁciently summarizes the local structure of
face images. LFI is a nonparametric descriptor that utilizes a
combined edge/corner detection strategy. The proposed method
uses the approach suggested by Frei and Chen for corner and
edge detection with nine different masks. After we obtain the
information about corners and edges of the image, for each
pixel position, we describe the relationship of pixels to their
local neighborhood from the local edge/corner features using the
edges and corners information separately. Then, we concatenate
these patterns together to form the ﬁnal LFI feature vector.
The performance evaluation of the proposed LFI algorithm is
conducted on several publicly available databases and observed
promising recognition rates.

I.
INTRODUCTION
During the past few years, face recognition has received a
great deal of attention and become one of the most popular
research areas in the ﬁelds of computer vision, image pro-
cessing, pattern recognition, and machine learning. The key of
each face recognition system is the utilization of the feature
extraction technique that must be able to extract features from
the face image, which are distinct and stable under different
conditions during the image acquisition process.
In the recent years, much research work has been done on
extracting image features. Many computer vision applications
employ the texture analysis algorithms. Two of the highest
performing texture algorithms that based on the concept of
local pattern descriptors, namely Local Binary Pattern (LBP)
and Local Directional Pattern (LDP), which describe the
relationship of pixels to their local neighborhood. They detect
only the important local textures by labeling each pixel with
the code of texture primitive that best matches the local
neighborhood. Fig. 1 shows some of these texture primitives
that can be detected by the local pattern descriptors that include
spots, line ends, ﬂat area, edges, and corners [1].
LBP is a nonparametric method which extracts local struc-
tures of images efﬁciently by comparing each pixel with its
neighboring pixels. If a neighbor pixel has a higher gray value
than the center pixel (or the same gray value) then a 1 is
assigned to that pixel, which is otherwise a 0. Finally, the LBP
binary code for the center pixel is produced by concatenating
the eight 1s or 0s, which can be converted to a decimal number
to produce the new value of that central pixel. The original
LBP operator was introduced by Ojala et al. for texture analysis
[2], and has proved a simple yet powerful approach to describe
local structures. LBP operator has a number of extensions
that have been extensively used in many applications, such
as face image analysis [3][4], image and video retrieval [5][6],
environment modeling [7][8], visual inspection [9][10], motion
analysis [11][12], and biomedical and aerial image analysis
[13][14]. LBP-based facial image analysis has been one of
the most popular and successful applications in recent years.
Nevertheless, LBP considers only ﬁrst order intensity pattern
change in a local neighborhood which fails to extract detailed
information especially during changes in face image due to the
noise and illumination variation problems.
LDP encodes the directional information in the neighbor-
hood instead of the intensity as LBP does with higher com-
putational cost. LDP is a gray-scale pattern that characterizes
the spatial structure of a local image texture. It computes the
edge response values in eight different directions at each pixel
position by convolving the image with the Kirsch masks in
eight different orientations, centered on its own position. Then
it uses the relative strength magnitude to encode the image
texture. The presence of a corner or an edge shows high
response values in some particular directions. Therefore, in
order to generate the LDP code, we need to know the n most
prominent directions. Then, the top n directional bit responses
are set to 1 and the rest (8 − n) bits of 8-bit LDP pattern are
set to 0 [15][16]. Since the edge responses are more noise and
illumination insensitive than intensity values, the resultant LDP
feature maintains more information than LBP and describes
the local primitives stably, including different types of curves,
corners, and junctions. However, LDP technique still suffers
in non-monotonic illumination variation and random noise.

In this paper, we present a new local pattern descriptor,
named Local edge/corner Feature Integration (LFI) that is sim-
ple but effective, and it can be a potential tool to extract image
features. LFI is a nonparametric method which extracts local
structures of images efﬁciently by comparing each pixel with
its neighboring pixels from edge/corner responses separately,
then combining these thresholding responses to form the ﬁnal
code. Unlike LDP whose codes are generated by setting the top
n directional bit responses to 1 and the rest to 0, which may
ignore some important information in the local neighborhood.
LFI uses the information of edge/corner changes around pixels
and labels the pixels by thresholding a 3×3 neighboring pixels
with the central pixel separately then considering the results
as binary codes. After that concatenates these binary codes to
form the ﬁnal LFI feature vector.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
2, the mathematical details of the proposed LFI algorithm is
provided. Discussion on the datasets and experimental results
are presented in Section 3. Finally, the conclusion is drawn in
Section 4.

LOCAL EDGE/CORNER FEATURE INTEGRATION (LFI)
This work aims to improve the face recognition accuracy
under illumination-variant environments by detecting much
stable edges especially in dark areas, which can be done by
the help of Frei-Chen edge detector [17]. The proposed LFI
technique can be summarized into three stages: edge/corner de-
tection, binary encoding and decoding, and feature integration.
Fig. 2 illustrates the framework of the proposed technique. The
details of each stage are described below.
A. Corner/Edge Detection
We suggest to utilize the properties of Frei-Chen edge
detector to extract more detailed corner and edge information
from input image. Frei-Chen edge detector works as nine
convolution masks that work on a 3×3 window size denoted as
Ki for i = 1, 2, ..., 9 as shown in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst four masks
Ki for i = 1, ..., 4 are used to ﬁnd the edges’ subspace, the
ﬁrst two of them K1 and K2 represent the isotropic smoothed
gradient weighting function, which will be supported by the
second two K3 and K4 to span the above edge’s subspace
by contributing to the magnitude of the edge’s subspace
components. The second four kernels Ki for i = 5, ..., 8 are
utilized to ﬁnd the corners’ subspace. By summing all of these
four, all possible discrete realizations of the points can be
detected. The last one K9 is used to compute the mean which
we use as a normalization factor [17].
Mathematically, given an input image I(x, y), the nine
different edge, corner, and mean responses gi can be computed
by
gi = I(x, y) ∗ Ki,
i = 1, 2, ..., 9
(1)
Where ∗ represents a convolution operation. Fig. 4 shows
an example of Frei-Chen kernels ﬁltered images. In the ﬁgure,
the upper row and the ﬁrst image starting from the left in
the middle row are the edge ﬁltered images, the second four
images are the corner ﬁltered images, and the last one is the
mean ﬁltered image. All nine edge, corner, and mean responses
gi are extracted with their corresponding masks Ki for i =
1, 2, ..., 9 respectively.

responses of each image.
In terms of the edge detection denoted as E, we choose

the two projection equations above.
B. Image Encoding and Decoding
After the edges and corners are detected separately as
mentioned above, which can be seen in Fig. 5, a binary coding
strategy is applied by exploiting the center pixel value in each
3 × 3 neighborhood regions, to encode the local structures
information in the neighborhood. To form the edge or corner
patterns, we compare each pixel with its neighboring pixels.
If a neighbor pixel has a higher edge/corner value than the
center pixel (or the same value) then a 1 is assigned to that
pixel, which is otherwise a 0. The edge/corner binary code for
that center pixel is produced by concatenating the eight 1s or
0s. Finally, to retrieve the edge and corner features map, we
change that binary codes into the corresponding decimal codes
D, which can be deﬁned as

where dc and dp denote the edge or corner values of the
central pixel and its neighbors respectively. We use the detected
edges image E and the detected corners image C, to generate
a pattern for each pixel position. Fig. 6 shows a raw image,
edge feature map, and the corner feature map after applying
the binary coding and decoding strategy.

C. Feature Integration
To generate the ﬁnal LFI feature vector, we map each
edge/corner patterns to their corresponding histogram bin, then
a 256 bin histogram would be computed for each edge and
corner patterns separately. Finally, all the histograms will be
concatenated to form the ﬁnal LFI histogram vector for each
input image. By this way, the LFI histogram contains all the
information about the distribution of the local micro patterns
such as edge, corener, line-end, ﬂat, and spot, which can be
used to statistically describe the image characteristics.
III.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
For evaluation, we use two publicly available face datasets,
named extended Yale B database [18][19] and AT&T (ORL)
dataset [20]. In terms of the feature extraction process, to
consider the local information of face components, we divide
each image into small blocks as can be seen in Fig. 7. After
that, we extract the information of each block separately using
our proposed technique LFI and represent it as a local LFI
histogram. Finally, we concatenate these local histograms to
form a global histogram for each input image that contains
information about the distribution of the local micro-patterns
of the image, and can be used to statistically describe the face
image characteristics. The length of this feature vector (global
histogram) depends on the number of blocks (regions) of each
image.
When it comes to the face recognition process, the objec-
tive is to compare the encoded feature vector from one image
with all other candidate feature vectors of the dataset using two
different method for classiﬁcation. The ﬁrst one, is a library
for support vector machines (LIBSVM) [21], and the second
one is, chi-square metric χ2, which is a measure between two
feature vectors, H1 and H2, of length N, that can be deﬁned
as
χ2(H1, H2) =
N
X
i=1
(H1(i) − H2(i))2
H1(i) + H2(i) + ϵ
(6)
where ϵ is a very small value that used to avoid division
by 0.
Figure 7. A face images is divided into small blocks and the features are
extracted using LFI and a histogram is built for each area. Then all the
histograms are concatenated.
A. Extended Yale B Database
The extended Yale B database has a total of 2280 face
images for 38 subjects representing 60 illumination conditions
per subject under the frontal pose, all the images resized to
64 × 64. Fig. 8 shows sample faces of this dataset. In the
ﬁgure, from the bottom raw it is hard even for human being
to recognize the person in some cases, especially the right
bottom sample we cannot even say if there is a face or any
other object in the image. Fig.s 9 and 10 show the edge
and corner map of the face images in Fig. 8. It is clear that
using Frei-Chen edge/corner detector, the edges and corners in
dark areas of the image are likely to be detected. Therefore,
the illumination variation problems will be overcome, which
signiﬁcantly helps to improve the face recognition performance
under uncontrolled illumination/lighting environments.

To avoid any bias, by using the χ2 we select one image
per subject of the data for training and the rest of the data
for testing. The experiments were repeated 60 times as there
are a total of 60 samples/subject, then the average results
are calculated. On the other hand, by using LIBSV M we
randomly select half of the data for training and the other half
for testing. The experiments were repeated 30 times, then the
average results are calculated for comparison. The performance
results of well known face recognition algorithms like local
ternary patterns (LTP) [22], Weber-face [23] and gradientface
(GradFace) [24], as well as LBP and LDP [16], with the
proposed method on extended Yale B dataset are presented
in Table I. Note that, the results we compared with are as we
got from their original references which are mentioned in the
table. Meanwhile, part of the extended Yale B dataset (standard
Yale B dataset) was used in [23][24].

B. AT&T Dataset (ORL)
The ORL database contains a total of 400 face images
corresponding to 10 different images of 40 distinct subjects.
Some sample faces are shown in Fig. 11. The images are
taken at different times with different speciﬁcations, including
slightly varying in illumination, different facial expressions
such as open and closed eyes, smiling and non-smiling, and
facial details like wearing glasses. All the images resized to
64 × 64. Table II summarizes the highest recognition rates
of the proposed local edge/corner feature integration method
compared to well known face recognition algorithms together
like (GLCM+LDP+EDGE) [25], and State Preserving Extreme
Learning Machine (SPELM) [26], and a combined phase
congruency and Gabor wavelet techniques (PC/GW) [27], as
well as LBP and LDP, with the proposed method on ORL
dataset with the use of χ2 similarity measure and LIBSV M.
Note that, the results we compared with are as we got from
their original references which are mentioned in the table, since
we do not have any original codes of of these algorithms.
The procedure of splitting the training and testing data has
been done as in the previous experiment. Therefore, we select
one image per subject of the data for training and the rest of
the data for testing to avoid any bias. The experiments were
repeated 10 times, then the average results were calculated for
comparison using χ2. Additionally, we select seven images of
the data randomly for training the LIBSV M classiﬁer and
the rest for testing. The experiments were repeated 10 times,
then the average results were calculated.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have introduced a new feature descrip-
tor technique named local edge/corner feature integration.
Throughout the performance evaluation, we found that LFI is
robust for face recognition regardless of extremely variations
of illumination/lighting environments as in extended Yale B
database, and slightly differences of pose conditions as in
AT&T dataset. In addition, compared to the other state-of-
the-art methods, we can say that our method provides better
accuracy in most test cases. From the results above, it is clear
that the LFI provides a stronger discriminative capability in
describing detailed texture information than the LBP and LDP.
In general, considering all comparison results, we can assess
that LFI can be a promising candidate for face recognition
applications. The work is progressing to investigate the ability
of the proposed technique LFI with different applications such
as dynamic texture recognition.

Abstract—Natural growth processes tend to generate shapes in the
form of imprecise planar tesselations, where the tiles do not match
exactlyand leave some space among them. In this paper we model
these tesselations by means of Voronoi Diagrams. We look for
the set of 2D-sites whose Voronoi Diagram better approximates
the given imprecise tessellation. Since we conjecture the Inverse
Voronoi Problem (also known as Voronoi-ﬁtting Problem) to be
NP-hard, we describe in this paper a heuristic algorithm that
looks for the optimal set of sites.. We study the algorithm’s
performance and validity on a set of tesselations extracted from
real-life images. With the aid of these experiments, we ﬁnd
optimal values for a tunable parameter of the algorithm. In the
long run, our main goal is to develop a tool that can automatically
analize an image of a tessellation that is expected to be modelled
with a Voronoi Diagram (e.g., pictures from chrystals, trees in a
forest, etc), and decide whether the growth process was or was not
affected by some external force. This inverse computation should
be able tell how far is the image from its theoretical model.
Keywords–Planar tesselations; Voronoi Diagram; local search;
Inverse Voronoi Diagram.

INTRODUCTION
Voronoi Diagrams (or Dirichlet tesselations) are a funda-
mental geometric structure with many applications in Graphics
and Image Processing, among other uses. Informally, the
Voronoi Diagram generated by a set S of points in the
Euclidean plane is a subdivision of the plane into (convex)
cells, where each cell is associated with one point p ∈ S, and
consists of the points on the plane that are closer to p than
to any other q ∈ S. In other words, the cell associated with
some point p can be thought of as a sort of sphere of inﬂuence
of p. For the precise deﬁnition, as well as the most important
properties of Voronoi Diagrams, we refer the reader to any one
of the many standard texts on the subject, such as [1].
The above deﬁnition lends itself very naturally to many
generalizations, such as using sites other than points, consider-
ing metrics other than the Euclidean metric, dimensions higher
than two, or surfaces other than the plane. Since many growth
processes in nature follow this very simple model, in this paper,
we will restrict ourselves to the Euclidean plane, the Euclidean
metric and point sites. In fact, due to the applied focus of this
paper, we will restrict the area of study to a bounded rectangle
in the 2D-plane where the tessellation is given, and perform
the algorithm’s adjustments using real-life image pictures.
Planar Euclidean Voronoi Diagrams have been applied to
describe images and other visual or spatial patterns since
the late 1970s [2], [3] and [4]. In particular, [2] attempts to
approximate a cellular pattern by a Voronoi Diagram and this
is, to the best of our knowledge the ﬁrst reference to what we
now call the Inverse Voronoi Problem. In this paper, we present
an algorithm that focuses on ﬁnding how a picture, that looks
like a Voronoi Diagram to the naked eye, can (or cannot) be
approximated by that model. We conjecture that ﬁnding the
model that better approximates the ﬁnal picture of a growth
process can give useful information on how the process itself
happened and if unforseen external circumstances may have
altered it. The Inverse Voronoi Problem (IVP) can be stated as
follows:
Problem 1 (Inverse Voronoi Problem): Given a Voronoi
Tesselation T in the Euclidean Plane, ﬁnd the set of points
P that generate T.
After [2], this problem was addressed again in [5] and [6].
The approach followed by Suzuki and Iri in [6] is similar to
that of [2]: their aim is to ﬁnd a Voronoi Diagram that best
approximates the tesselation T, according to some measure of
approximation. On the other hand, in [5] Ash and Bolker try
to ﬁnd the Voronoi Diagram that ﬁts T exactly. Unfortunately,
this is not always possible, since not every tesselation T
corresponds exactly to a Voronoi Diagram, even if all the cells
of T are convex.
In this paper, we continue along the lines of [2] and [6]: We
consider a relaxation of the concept of planar tesselation, and
we devise an algorithm that tries to ﬁnd the Voronoi Diagram
that best approximates this relaxed tesselation.
In a standard tesselation of the plane, the tiles cover the
entire plane, and their intersection is a set of edges, with mea-
sure zero. However, this ideal situation does not correspond to
reality in many cases. In many actual spatial patterns, including
images, the cell boundaries may have some thickness, or to put
it in another way, the tiles do not match exactly, leaving some
space between them. This situation was recently considered in
[7], where the Voronoi edges have some constant width w > 0.
In this paper, we consider a more general situation, which we
may call imprecise planar tesselation.
Deﬁnition 1 (Imprecise planar tesselations): An
imprecise (or incomplete) tesselation of a bounded region
R ⊆ R2 is a set P of polygons, or tiles (not necessarily
convex), such that each P ∈ P is strictly contained in R, has
a non-empty interior; and T
P ∈P P has zero measure.
Note that we preserve the condition that the intersection
between cells has zero measure, but we do not require that
S
P ∈P P covers the entire Euclidean plane R2, hence P is not

a tesselation in the usual sense. The set R − S
P ∈P P will
be called the grey area. When we try to approximate P by a
Voronoi Diagram, we care about where each P ∈ P lies with
respect to the Voronoi Diagram, but we are indifferent as to
where some part of the grey area goes.
Section II describes the heuristic algorithm to approximate
planar imprecise tesselations. In Section III, we give examples
of imprecise tesselations of the plane taken from real-life
applications, and we run the algorithm with those tesselations,
in order to analyze its performance. From these experiments,
we draw conclusions regarding a certain tunable parameter of
the aforementioned algorithm. Please note that, since this is
a Work In Progress, the obtained values and the decisions
made in order to tune our algorithm are still subject to further
research.
II.
APPROXIMATING IMPRECISE TESSELATIONS
In the following, we will assume that P consists of n
polygons {P1, . . . Pn}, and our aim is to approximate it by a
Voronoi Diagram V with exactly n cells {V1, . . . Vn}, i.e. one
per polygon. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the Voronoi cell Vi should
cover the tile Pi as much as possible, and perhaps some of the
gray area, but should refrain from invading any other tile Pj,
with j ̸= i.
Using the area of the missclasiﬁed region as a measure of
the ﬁtness of a candidate solution, we can deﬁne our goal as
follows: For each Voronoi cell Vi, we compute the area of the
portions of polygons in P other than Pi that lie inside Vi. The
sum of the areas of all regions for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n is the
area of the missclasiﬁed region. (Note that the portions of Pi
that do not belong to Vi will be counted when the containing
Voronoi cell is processed.)
Since we will, in practice, never work with the entire plane
but with a bounded region, typically a rectangular section R,
if a(X) represents the area of a polygon X, we may deﬁne
the normalized unwanted area of V, relative to P, as follows:
ΥP(V) =
1
a(R)
n
X
i=1
(a(Pi) − a(Pi ∩ Vi))
=
1
a(R)
n
X
i=1
a(Pi) −
1
a(R)
n
X
i=1
a(Pi ∩ Vi)
(1)
Hence, we treat the problem of approximating P as an
optimization problem, where we have to minimize the ob-
jective function Υ, which in general, is a non-linear and
non-differentiable function. Note that the ﬁrst term of (1),
i.e.
1
a(R)
Pn
i=1 a(Pi), is constant, therefore, minimizing Υ
amounts to maximizing the term Pn
i=1 a(Pi ∩ Vi).
In order to minimize Υ, we may use any of the well-
known heuristics developed for non-linear optimization, such
as any variant of local search, simulated annealing, genetic
algorithms, etc. (see [8], for instance). In this paper, we settle
for a simple variant of local search, which is roughly described
in the algorithm in Fig. 1 as a ﬁrst attempt to explore the
solution space. We will also see that looking for this minimum
is not an easy task and that, being the optimal location for each
point dependant on every point other than itself, careful tuning
needs to be performed in order not to fall in a local minimum.
Starting with the centroids of the tiles, the algorithm is going to
try to move one site at a time in any of the 8 main directions.
Input: An imprecise tesselation P = {P1, . . . Pn}, an
approximation ϵ.
Output: A set of sites S = {s1, . . . sn} whose Voronoi
Diagram approximates P.

The best among these positions for that particular site, will
be chosen and the site will be reassigned to that location. We
iterate this process until no site in the current solution can
be moved. When this happens, we decrease the distance that
we are going to test, looking for locations that are closer to
the site. Since we don’t expect real-world Voronoi Diagrams
to be centroidal, at the beginning, farther positions from the
centroid are explored. As the algorithm proceeds, the sites tend
to get closer to the optimal location and smaller steps are given.
We will see in Section III that how we reduce the distance in
those tests, drastically affects the ﬁnal solution and the running
times.
Algorithm in Fig. 1 shows the main idea that we have
followed in order to implement the descent method for our
problem. Even though many different approaches can be tested
and small modiﬁcations can slightly improve the ﬁnal result or
the computational time, we describe here the main decisions
that have been taken in order to optimize a given imprecise
tesellation.
•
A candidate solution is found when translating one
site in the previous candidate solution. Note that this
movement has a direct effect on all Voronoi neigh-
bouring cells and, in the long run, might force the
move of any other site in S.
•
Translation vectors have been carefully studied show-
ing that 8 directions give good enough approximations
in practical cases.
•
Translation distance happens to be one of the most
important parameters, showing our results that both
optimization and performance beneﬁt from a distance
reduction by some factor each time the algorithm gets

stuck in a local minimum for the present distance.
•
The algorithm terminates when the improvements in
the normalized unwanted area is smaller than ϵ after
several attempts.
We have implemented and tested several variations on this
algorithm in order to ﬁnd a good balance between achieving a
good approximation and the computational time needed to ob-
tain it. Note that, whenever a new candidate solution is tested,
the whole Voronoi Diagram might have to be recomputed.
We brieﬂy discuss in the following the choices that we have
made in our implementation and justify them according to our
experimental results:
•
If site si moves in along a certain direction in one
iteration, we have seen that it is very probable that
the same direction will be chosen in the next move.
Therefore, we have also implemented versions for the
algorithm where not all 8 directions are tested, but
we move a site if the same direction as the previ-
ous iteration already gives an improvement without
needing to test the other 7 directions. This choice
does reach similar results in the approximation bounds
while being more efﬁcient.
•
Once all sites are tested and no movement is found to
improve the present solution, we decrease the distance
for the translation (which will be proportional to its
distance to its nearest neighbour). Intuitively, this
process allows the points to approach fast their best
location and improve within that location afterwards.
•
Even though when we approach the best location
improvements tend to be small, this condition might
be also met during the whole process. We establish the
number of rounds in which we will already consider
that no further improvement is expected.
III.
COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS
In order to test the performance of Algorithm 1 we have
chosen some imprecise tesselations, obtained by segmenting
real-life images coming from different domains.
The example, Fig. 2 [9] shows a honeycomb, which is an
almost perfect hexagonal tiling of the plane. With this im-
age, since the Voronoi Diagram originating perfect hexagonal
tilings is centroidal (i.e. generators lie on the centroids of
the cells), the objective function is essentially minimized at
the initialization step. On the other hand, we have several
non-centroidal Voronoi tesselation of the plane. Fig. 3 [10]
is a microscopic image of common waterweed, Canadian
pondweed (Elodea canadensis), an aquatic plant from North
America. Fig. 4 [11] is another microscopic image, from a
metal’s crystalline structure. Finally, Fig. 5 [12] is a satellite
image of a farming area in Oxfordshire, UK. Despite the limits
between farms not appearing through a natural growth process,
their resemblance to a Voronoi Diagram is remarkable (In the
best run, Υ = 4.6%, even smaller than our best run for the
crystal structure).
All the aforementioned images show a clear pattern of
tiles that tesselate the plane in an imprecise manner. We have
segmented the images in order to obtain imprecise planar
tesselations and, for each one of these tesselations, we have
run our algorithm with different step reduction factors. For
each experiment, we have measured the number of iterations,
the running times and the initial and the ﬁnal values of the

objective function. We have randomized the order in which
the sites are processed in each loop. Even though neither the
running times nor the optimal solution is dramatically affected
by this randomness, we have run the algorithm ten times for
each distance factor, and have taken the average of these ten
values for each parameter. In each case we have also computed
the relative cost, which is the number of iterations that are
necessary to gain one percentage point of accuracy in the
approximation. Tables I, II and III contain the results of those
measurements. The experiments have been carried out on a
personal computer equipped with an Intel Core i5 processor,
with 8 GB RAM, running under Windows 10 and the algorithm
has been implemented using the R language.

Algorithm 1 for the images above. Although the level of
approximation varies substantially from one image to another,
note that the maximum approximation is attained in all cases
with a step reduction factor approximately equal to 0.7.
Besides the degree of approximation, we are also interested
in the amount of work done to achieve the desired approxima-
tion. Fig. 7 makes a graphical comparison of the relative cost

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we have introduced the concept of imprecise
planar tesselation, in order to model images arising in many
practical situations. Our experiments show that imprecise pla-
nar tesselations can be approximated quite accurately with the
aid of Voronoi Diagrams, which provides a nice geometric
model for several types of images. Moreover, we have detected
a coincidence in relation with the step reduction factor: in
all four images, the best approximation is achieved when
the step reduction factor is approximately equal to 0.7, and
the algorithm performs more efﬁciently with a larger step
reduction factor, although the approximation decreases sharply.
This gives us some rough guidelines for tuning the step
reduction factor, depending on our priorities at each moment.
As a rule of thumb, a step reduction factor between 0.7 and
0.75 seems to be a good choice, leaning towards 0.7 if we want
more accuracy, or towards 0.75 if we need more efﬁciency.
However, these guidelines have to be conﬁrmed by more

extensive experiments.
There are many ways to improve our method for ap-
proximating imprecise planar tesselations. We can replace
our algorithm by a more sophisticated metaheuristic, such as
simulated annealing, or an evolutionary algorithm. Another
improvement may be derived by considering a more general
variant of the Inverse Voronoi Problem, where we would allow
more than one Voronoi cell per tile. This Generalized Inverse
Voronoi Problem has already been considered before in [13]
and [14], for instance, but these two papers have focused on the
exact version of the problem only. The approximated version
might yield better results, in the sense that a reasonably good
aproximation might be found with far fewer Voronoi generators
than those used in [13] and [14].

Abstract—This article presents a model and a prototype 
implementation of a technical application programming 
interface (API) for incremental reconstruction of the moving 
objects trajectories captured by closed-circuit television 
(CCTV) and High-definition television (HDTV) cameras.  This 
paper proposes a unique, much simpler model-driven approach 
which is more efficient than other approaches for dynamic 
tracking such as Microsoft Kinect. The research reported here 
is part of a research program of the Cybersecurity Research 
Group of London Metropolitan University for real-time video 
analytics with applicability to surveillance in security, disaster 
recovery and safety management, and customer insight.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Intelligent and prompt moving object tracking is a difficult 
issue in the computer vision research area. Multiple objects 
tracking has many useful applications in scene analysis for 
computerized surveillance. If the system can track different 
objects in an environment of multiple moving objects and 
reconstruct their trajectories, then there will be a variety of 
applications. This research is focused on reconstructing the 
trajectory of body movements in continuous stream of signals 
of a video for the purpose of further analysis and extracting 
information. Our method is based on the use of a moving 
object ontology to capture a more detailed information about 
the trajectory. The approach used in this article has not been 
explored much by the research community – see [1][2] for the 
use of structure motion description and initial estimations, 
[3][4] for the preset trajectory information in robotic control 
and [5][6] for interoperability of traditional trajectory 
information and generic sensors.  
This research is part of the research program for 
Simulation-based Visual Analysis of Individual and Group 
Dynamic Behavior of the Cybersecurity Research Group of 
London Metropolitan University. The research group is 
interested in real-time video analytics with applicability to 
surveillance in security, disaster recovery and safety 
management, and customer insight. The ultimate goal of this 
research program is to construct an efficient framework for 
visual analytics in real time as shown in Fig. 1. 
  
 
Figure 1.  General workflow of the overall framework [8] 
Moving object tracking in our approach is based on the 
object-centric representation of the position which forms a 
tube-like model of the spatial navigation and allows isolated 
manipulation of the video objects within the focus.  This can 
be achieved through an incremental algorithm for processing 
the flow of information as illustrated in the Fig. 2. 
  
 
Figure 2.  Incremental trajectory reconstruction 
The moving human object in the video is modeled as a 
collection of spatiotemporal object volumes (object tubes). 
Key for reconstructing of the trajectory in this model is the 
estimation of the object positions and the navigation 
parameters of the object movements such as rotation, direction 
of movement and speed. 
Reconstruction of moving object trajectories starts with 
extraction of the motion information from the video and 
representation of object trajectories in a 3D grid. Motion based 
on video representations have been used in other video 
navigation and annotation systems, but the focus of these

systems is mainly on providing an in-scene direct moving 
object trajectory from the video. As expected, the 
reconstruction of the trajectory is based on analytical methods 
for connecting the spatial locations of the identified objects 
across the frames.  This is pursued on the basis of incremental 
approximation of the spatial locations of the video frames 
using different computational techniques and approximations. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows; Section II 
describes the foundation of incremental reconstruction of 
trajectories. Section III describes the method of distance 
calculation. Section IV addresses the direction estimation. 
Section V goes into finer details about types of movements.  
Section VI explains about camera position. Section VII 
reports about the implementation of framework. The 
conclusions and references close the article. 
II. 
FOUNDATION FOR INCREMENTAL RECONSTRUCTION 
OF THE TRAJECTORIES 
There are many ways to model the moving objects and 
they all have different values for the task of trajectory 
reconstruction.  Researchers constantly search for better 
models in order to make the trajectories’ reconstruction 
process more adequate as well as efficient, so that it can be 
used in real-time.  
A. Comparinsion of the basic geometric shapes  
Initially, our research started with a point-based model. 
After exploring the benefits and limitations of this model, we 
moved to a more adequate but more complex triangle shape-
based model.  Fig. 3 shows the trajectory reconstruction with 
the help of point based model: 
 
 
Figure 3.  Trajectory reconstructed using point based model 
The moving object was tracked in the video and annotated 
graphically by dot shaped labels. Reconstructing of the 
trajectories with the point-based model is easy and needs less 
computational resources. The mathematical representation of 
the points requires only co-ordinates for the dots. It is 
relatively easy to extract this information from the video in 
order to reconstruct the trajectory of the moving object. 
Point-based model is not appropriate for objects of 
different size. Also, it is not capable of representing the 
changes in the shape of object on a move. For instance, the 
bending and twisting of moving object cannot be represented 
in point-based model. Therefore, the authors decided to move 
to a prismatic shape model as it wraps up the whole volume 
of the physical object body. This is shown in Fig. 4. 
 
Figure 4.  Trajectory reconstructed using prismatic model 
The prismatic model helps in estimating the size of the 
object. At the same time, there is a possibility that different 
prismatic shapes can represent the different parts of the 
moving object. The prismatic shapes can be combined to 
create bigger and even different shapes. For instance, a 
number of prismatic shapes when combined can form a 
sphere. This approach is widely adopted in computer games 
where the moving objects are wrapped up in an invisible 
“capsule”. 
This model is a step towards estimating the correct size of 
the moving object. But still it is not possible to cover the 
motion of the body parts of moving object, for instance, 
bending, and we are also unable to estimate the twisting of the 
moving object. To overcome these weaknesses, we obviously 
need to extend the moving object model through combining 
multiple shapes, but before that we need to consider its 
simpler counterpart, the spherical shape model, since it deals 
with rotations more naturally. Fig. 5 illustrates the trajectory 
based on spherical model. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Trajectory reconstructed using spherical model 
B. Choice of the composite model of the dynamic objects 
The starting point of the 3D reconstruction of the object 
movements using their 2D projections on the frames of a 
digital video signal is the choice of a suitable composite 
model. Different approximations are possible depending on 
the precision needed and the complexity of the recognition 
algorithms we can afford. For the purpose of the analysis at 
this stage of the research, we are using seven spheres model 
25

(see Figure 6). It is an optimal in the sense that it combines the 
simplicity of the spherical shape with the sophistication of the 
composite capsule. 
The main parts of the body in this model are represented 
by separate spherical shapes with one extra sphere to cover the 
whole body. These six spheres allow tracking of the major 
type of motions – directed (like forward), rotational (like 
turning left), as well as relative to the body (like bending and 
standing up). This model can be presented schematically as 
shown in Fig. 6.

Other models are also possible but they all have different 
benefits and drawbacks from our point of view. The following 
table summarizes the comparison of some of the popular 
moving object models.

In future, we do not exclude the possibility to switch to more

spheres model is fully adequate for our purpose and has

additional benefits from computational point of view, since 
the algorithms for extrapolating the volumes are more 
efficient. 
III. 
CALCULATING DISTANCES 
One of the challenges in this research is to find various 
distances within the 3D space based on the 2D projections on 
the video frames - between the camera and the moving object, 
between the front and the rear of an object etc. This is also 
known as depth calculation. There are some methods already 
available for this task, but they have their own limitations 
[8][9]. For instance, they need the camera focal length and 
other values for preliminary calibration, some methods 
require constant use of two cameras, etc. 
To find a way to overcome this challenge, we have 
adopted a simple geometrical approach, which calculates the 
absolute 3D sizes based on their relative 2D projections; as all 
models used in this research have coordinates values about the 
moving object then these can be used to find the depth 
distance. Consider the configuration in Fig. 8: 
 
Figure 8.  Moving object at point P1 and P2 at two different time instances 
with depth calculation 
In this simple approach and in order to estimate absolute 
sizes, all what we need are the coordinates of the projections, 
assuming the position of the camera is fixed in the middle of 
26

the observable space. The advantage of this approach is in its 
simplicity and independence on any preparatory work 
although it may lead to more complex algorithms in the case 
of multiple cameras observing the same space. 
IV. 
ESTIMATING DIRECTIONS 
Two main directions need to be estimated for the purpose 
of the behavior analysis in video analytics – navigation 
(moving direction) and line of sight (viewing direction). The 
direction of movement is estimated entirely using analytical 
methods which use a simple geometry of space. As far as the 
viewing direction, we use a combinsation of statistical and 
analytical methods.  
As a first approximation we assume that the viewing 
direction is the same as the moving direction, at a later stage 
the viewing direction will be corrected on the basis of the 
horizontal rotation of the sphere which represents the head. 
The following possible cases are forming the body of the 
algorithm for estimating the viewing direction: 
 
If the body is moving forward along a line then we will estimate 
the difference between the moving directions of the object over 
the time interval and if it is stable then the two directions are 
kept identical. If there is a change caused by rotation of the head, 
the viewing direction is estimated as the difference between the 
angle of side rotation and the moving direction. 
 
If the object is not moving, then the viewing direction is 
considered to be the difference between the angle of facing the 
camera and the angle of rotation of the head. 
 
If the head is rotating in both directions (i.e., oscillating 
horizontally) the amplitude of the oscillation is estimated to 
calculate the viewing direction as the middle point. 
To implement the above algorithm two parameters have 
been introduced; the time instance head is turned into a 
different direction from the moving direction, and the 
amplitude of oscillation of the head around the viewing 
direction. 
V. 
TYPE OF MOVEMENTS 
In order to provide informative reconstruction of the 
trajectories, it is essential to track various possible spatial 
movements, the most important cases are as follows: 
Continuous linear movement: The capsula is moving in a 
direction without rotation. This type of movement generates a 
simple trajectory. 
Static object starts moving: In initial time instance, this static 
object does not move, however after a few ticks it changes the 
position. In initial time instance, there is no trajectory for this 
type of motion but after few time instances the trajectory 
appears. 
Static object moves under the influence of another moving 
object: This type of motion is similar to the previous but in 
this case the object motion is caused by another moving object 
(knock-down effect); for instance, a walking person reaches a 
wall, picks a briefcase from the ground, drops it, etc. In this 
case the trajectory starts appearing after few time instances. 
 
Moving object disappearing from the scene: At the beginning, 
the object has a trajectory, but at some point, this trajectory 
interrupts due to the objects navigating outside of the visual 
scope of the camera. 
Object rotation: This rotation is either the whole moving object 
rotation or a rotation of some of its parts. This calculation is 
simpler with the spherical model. 
VI. 
CHANGING THE CAMERA POSITION 
All the explanations, figures, and descriptions included in 
this article are based on the use of two dimensional space as a 
projection of the three dimensional physical space. 
A. Standard Origin 
The origin of the two dimensional space is initially 
considered at the top left (or in three dimensional space, at the 
top left bottom) corner of the visual scope. The initial position 
of origin is illustrated in the Fig. 9 where spheres are used to 
represent the positions.  
 
Figure 9.  Normal space with origin at the top left corner 
We assume that a camera is at the bottom center of the 
space. The calibration depends upon the space rather than 
upon the position of the camera so our choice is for 
convenience only. From the above figure the equation of the 
origin can be described as follows; 

(𝑥𝑂0, 𝑦𝑂0)

The position of a camera is represented below, 
 
𝐶 = (𝑥𝐶0,   𝑦𝐶0) 
(2) 
While the position of the sphere is expressed as; 
 
S = (𝑥𝑆0, 𝑦𝑆𝑂)
(3)

The vector from the camera to the sphere can be described as; 
 
𝐶𝑆
⃗⃗⃗⃗ = 𝐶 − 𝑆  
(4) 
 
𝐶𝑆
⃗⃗⃗⃗ = (𝑥𝑆𝑂 − 𝑥𝑐0, 𝑦𝑠0 − 𝑦𝑐0) 

The length of the vector can be given as; 
 
| 𝐶𝑆
⃗⃗⃗⃗ |
= √(𝑥𝑆𝑂 − 𝑥𝑐0)2 + (𝑦𝑠0 − 𝑦𝑐0)2 

B. Shifting the origin at the camera location 
To make the whole calculation and explanation simpler, 
we can move the origin of the space to the position of the 
camera. This is shown in Fig. 10 where red rectangles denote 
the updated calibrations. 
 
Figure 10.  Modified space with the origin at the camera location 
The new origin position can be rewritten as below: 
 
𝑂′ = (𝑥𝑜0  +  𝑎 , 𝑦𝑜0 + 𝑏) 

where a is the displacement value of the origin along X-Axis, 
while b is the displacement value of the origin along Y-Axis. 
 
Due to the above origin displacement, now the camera 
position is the same as the origin; 
 
𝐶′ = (𝑥𝑜0  +  𝑎 , 𝑦𝑜0 + 𝑏)

The position of the sphere with respect to the new origin is; 
 
𝑆′ = (𝑥𝑠0 − 𝑎, 𝑦𝑠0 −  𝑏)

By default, the values a and b should be subtracted from the 
original value of the sphere. However, if origin displacement 
involves crossing of the sphere position then the final value 
should be multiplied by -1. In this case the new vector between 
a camera and a sphere can be given as below; 
 
𝐶′𝑆′
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ = 𝐶′
⃗⃗⃗ − 𝑆′
⃗⃗⃗  
(10) 
 
𝐶′𝑆′
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ = ((𝑥𝑠0 − 𝑎) − (𝑥𝑜0  +  𝑎) , (𝑦𝑠0 −  𝑏)
− (𝑦𝑜0 + 𝑏)) 

Then, the distance between the camera and the sphere is; 
 
𝐶′𝑆′
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ 
= √((𝑥𝑠0 − 𝑎) − (𝑥𝑜0 + 𝑎))2 + ((𝑦𝑠0 − 𝑏) − (𝑦𝑜0 + 𝑏))2 
 

All above calculations are relatively simple and can be 
implemented efficiently which allows the algorithms to be 
executed in real-time without much difficulties.  
VII. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FRAMEWORK 
The trajectory reconstruction module of the video 
analytics framework does the actual processing of the video 
frames using OpenCV open source engine [10]. The module 
supports the following main operations; 
 
High-level GUI and Media I/O  
 
Image processing of the video frames 
 
Geometric transformations 
 
Structural analysis and shape approximation 
The module operates in real-time using recurrent 
algorithms based on the model described in the paper. It 
includes several components which are introduced below; 
A.  Selection of video frames for processing 
Every video data consist of video frames which are 2D 
graphical objects. These frames are combined in the time 
sequence to form a video by the digital devices as shown in 
Fig. 11.

Typically, most of the CCTV and HDTV surveillance 
cameras produce frames at a rate which does not exceed thirty 
frames per second.  The above figure illustrates the flow of 
frames in a video movie. 
Most of the video processing frameworks do not process 
each and every frame of video data. Some of the frames 
presented in the above picture are shown in white color and 
few more are shown in gray color because we assume that we 
are processing only the frames in grey after skipping few 
frames in white. The criteria for choosing which frames to 
process depends on the complexity of the algorithms and the 
frame content. 
B. Moving objects segmentation 
This component of the trajectory reconstruction module 
performs operations on all selected frames to identify and 
approximate the contour of the objects within the frame (Fig. 
12). 
 
Figure 12.  Moving object and sequences of points around the moving 
object shaping its projection on the frame 
The segmentation component first converts the frame into 
binary format and then performs processing of the pixels to 
find the approximate contour of the moving object. 
C. Computing moving objects displacement 
Displacement component keeps track of the moving object 
identified by the segmentation component of the module. It 
calculates the displacement of the moving objects in each 
processed frame which is needed for subsequent trajectory 
reconstruction. 
D. Reconstructing the moving objects trajectory 
The reconstructed trajectory data is calculated on the basis 
of the information about object location, their descriptors and 
the values of displacement. It is a continuous stream of 
information calculated recurrently and generated as an output 
of the module for further analysis. 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
This paper presents an efficient model-driven approach to 
moving object trajectory reconstruction which can be used for 
real-time video analytics. Our approach has a number of 
advantages compared to Microsoft Kinect model commonly 
endorsed in computer games industry [11][12]. First, the 
trajectory data can be reconstructed using less information 
because of the simpler geometry which lowers the 
requirements for preliminary visual image processing. 
Secondly, the reconstruction of the trajectory is more efficient 
because of the simpler approximation, which makes this 
approach preferable for real-time systems. Thirdly, the overall 
algorithms of moving object trajectory reconstruction are far 
simpler than the other algorithms reviewed in the literature 
and the software becomes more compact, which allows an 
easy embedding in other software for visual analytics. 
Our immediate plans, after finalizing the trajectory 
reconstruction module, is to implement an extension for 
estimating the viewing direction, which is needed for further 
analysis of the dynamic behavior patterns in areas such as 
customer insight. Next, we are planning to enhance our model 
through combining features of the seven spheres model used 
here with the six lines model of Kinect in order to be able to 
analyze gestures as well.

Abstract—This paper describes a fast audiovisual attention 
model applied to human detection and localization on a 
companion robot. Its originality lies in combining static and 
dynamic modalities over two analysis paths in order to guide 
the robot’s gaze towards the most probable human beings’ 
locations based on the concept of saliency. Visual, depth and 
audio data are acquired using a RGB-D camera and two 
horizontal microphones. Adapted state-of-the-art methods are 
used to extract relevant information and fuse them together via 
two dimensional gaussian representations. The obtained 
saliency map represents human positions as the most salient 
areas. Experiments have shown that the proposed model can 
provide a mean F-measure of 66 percent with a mean precision 
of 77 percent for human localization using bounding box areas 
on 10 manually annotated videos. The corresponding 
algorithm is able to process 70 frames per second on the robot. 
Keywords-audiovisual attention; saliency; RGB-D; human 
localization; companion robot. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
With the rapid advances in robotics, companion robots 
will tend to be more and more integrated in the human daily 
life [12]. These robots have the particularity to be both 
sociable, mobile and destined to evolve in an indoor 
domestic environment. One of the main requirement for 
them is to be able to quickly analyze their surrounding in 
order to interact with humans. That is why it is necessary to 
prioritize the perception, detection and localization of 
humans. They also need to behave as natural as possible in 
order to become acceptable presences for the humans [12].  
To reach these requirements, cognitive based audiovisual 
attention mechanisms are a possibility that has been 
investigated in this work. Their related concepts can indeed 
provide the robot with the natural idea that it should give 
more attention to some positions than others.  
A fast multimodal attention model for human detection 
and localization on a companion robot has thus been 
conceptualized and developed.  
This model is distinctive from state-of-the-art methods 
presented in Section II due to both its application on a robot 
that can travel between different places during time, and to 
its architecture that combines visual, depth and audio data 
through two independent static and dynamic analysis paths. 
Moreover, since the robot and the humans can both move, 
the robot will not ever be in a situation where a specific 
characteristic of a human (face, leg, etc.) would be 
detectable. And since the detectors associated with these 
characteristics may sometimes fail, it has been decided not to 
use them in the proposed model in order to avoid false 
detections. This model may thus be considered as a bottom-
up external information guided model.  
It has been realized using the open source robot Qbo Pro 
Evo (Fig. 1) produced by TheCorpora©. Qbo’s height is of 
456 millimeters. It integrates an Intel i3-2120T 2.6 gigahertz 
processor and 4 gigabytes of random access memory. This 
hardware is conducted by a Linux Mint 17.1 operating 
system that has been enhanced with the Indigo’s version of 
the Robotic Operating System (ROS). It embeds an Asus 
Xtion Pro Live RGB-D camera at the top of its head. This 
camera can stream depth and color images with a resolution 
of 640 by 480 pixels at 30 frames per second (FPS). It also 
provides two stereo microphones with a gap of 147.5 
millimeters between them. Thanks to this system, the 
proposed model is able to analyze multimodal data as soon 
as they arrive. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes state-of-the-art ideas about audiovisual attention 
and its applications to robotics. Section III describes the 
proposed model in details. Section IV presents the dataset 
that has been used and the results of the evaluation. Section 
V concludes this study and presents future work perspectives 
related to the proposed model.

II. 
PREVIOUS WORK 
This section presents previous work related to the 
proposed model. 
A. Audiovisual attention 
Audiovisual attention is a fast human cognitive process 
that aims to guide human interest through the most salient 
(i.e., remarkable) areas [7]. This process has been widely 
studied during the past three decades in neurosciences, 
psychology and computer sciences. This section focuses on 
the computational models developed using computer 
sciences methods.  
Their goal is to represent the saliency level of different 
sources on a grayscale image called saliency map. On this 
map, the more salient an element is, the higher its intensity is 
[7]. Most attention models are referred as saliency models. 
As described in [2], a huge number of saliency models 
have been implemented during time. Their efficiencies have 
been evaluated on different benchmarks using neurosciences 
ground truth results [3]. 
Anyway, these benchmarks are mostly available for the 
models designed for static two dimensional images only. 
They are not suitable to evaluate a multimodal or a 
dynamical model. This may be explained by the fact that 
most of state-of-the-art work are only based on static visual 
data (“single input image” [3]). These models have the 
particularity to give out salient regions independently of the 
content of the scene. This means that they may detect 
elements that do not correspond to a given target. In order to 
bias the results obtained with those classical models, some 
works have however incorporated other modalities, such as 
depth, motion, or sound.  
Reference [5] demonstrated the utility to use a depth bias 
over two dimensional visual saliency results in order to 
increase their efficiency on ground truth evaluations obtained 
through eye-tracking processes. The authors notably 
concluded that humans are more attentive to close elements.  
Reference [9] proposed to use motion detection on video 
images in order to localize areas that are moving and to 
combine them with a 2D static saliency model. The idea 
behind this is that the human gaze may be more attracted by 
moving objects than static objects. The authors proposed to 
drastically increase the saliency of moving objects. 
Reference [4] has shown that adding sound analysis to 
visual cues may help to increase the saliency of a talking 
human for dynamic conversational purposes. Reference [10] 
used a visual additive two dimensional Gaussian bias 
centered on a horizontal sound localized position to improve 
the detection of a target in a complex visual environment.  
B. Applications in robotics 
Applications of the attention’s concepts in the field of 
robotics are still uncommon but are gaining more and more 
importance in the design of methods for robots’ perception. 
Reference [11] proposed to combine a static visual 
attention model with a two dimensional sound localization to 
guide the gaze of a static humanoid robot thanks to the Head 
Related Transfer Function (HRTF) transform. This transform 
is effective to localize a sound in a human manner. However, 
it requires precisely designed humanoid ears covering the 
microphones, making the results of the HRTF difficult to 
reproduce with a standard robot such as Qbo. 
Reference [12] used a multimodal approach to control the 
emotions of a sitting conversational humanoid robot 
according to the most interesting face of the human being. 
The authors used color, depth and sound data. In their 
method, they considered that the human faces will always be 
present in the scene. They used specific methods for human 
characterization such as emotion and head pose recognition. 
Their camera was detached of the robot and connected to an 
external computer. They did not consider algorithm speed 
issues. 
III. 
PROPOSED MODEL 
This section presents a novel approach for human 
detection and localization using audiovisual attention 
concepts on a companion robot. It has been inspired by the 
previously described independent literature results that have 
rarely been combined all together. The corresponding model 
thus combines multiple state-of-the-art ideas and methods in 
an all-in-one modular model represented on Fig. 2. It extracts 
independent static and dynamic features using visual, depth, 
and sound data. These features are then fused together in 
order to increase the saliency of the areas that may 
correspond the most to a human being.  
In order to achieve this goal, the proposed model has 
been designed considering real domestic conditions through 
the following hypotheses: hypothesis (1) the robot will 
sometimes not be in presence of a human being, hypothesis 
(2) the robot may move over time, and will thus see different 
places with different points of view, hypothesis (3) a human 
being is a multimodal entity that can move and emit sound 
that the robot should be attentive to, hypothesis (4) the robot 
should be more attentive to close elements in order to avoid 
background salient elements detection, and hypothesis (5) 
the model has to be fast in order to eventually enable other 
processes to run at the same time on the robot. Its 
development was made considering the robot stationary 
while analyzing a scene. The mobility constraint has been 
considered through hypothesis (2). 
A. Processing architecture of the model 
As shown on Fig. 2, the proposed model has been 
decomposed in five steps and two independent static and 
dynamic analysis paths. It combines static visual 2D saliency 
with depth, motion and sound biases as referred in Section 
II.A. These modalities have been chosen according to the 
hypothesis (3) made in Section III. From a computational 
point of view, the model has been first developed using 
Matlab toolboxes before it was implemented on the robot 
using the C++ language through the ROS packages structure 
and the open source libraries OpenNI and OpenCV. 
In the following sections, the proposed model is going to 
be presented step by step, from static to dynamic modalities 
and from visual to audio cues. 
B. Step 1 – Data retrieval 
This step’s goal is to get the data from the sensors.

As explained in Section I, color and depth images are 
both acquired at a speed of 30 FPS with a resolution of 640 
by 480 pixels thanks to the RGB-D camera.  
Stereo sound signals are discretized using a sample 
frequency of 44.1 kilohertz and bufferized in a one 
dimensional array. 
C.  Step 2 – Preprocessing 
This step aims to reduce observation noises and 
computational time using simple but efficient operations. 
The following observations about the data have been made 
during this study:  
 
Color channels are not used in Step 3. 
 
Illumination variations generate noise on both 
color and depth images. 
 
Randomly located “holes” can be observed on 
depth images (i.e., not out of range areas that 
are considered as if they were out of range). 
 
Sound signals show an inconstant amplitude 
offset coming from the functionning robot’s 
system ego-sound. 
The following operations have been realized. Their 
results are shown on Fig. 3.   
First, the last retrieved color image is converted in 
grayscale, dividing by three times its computational cost.  
Second, in order to improve the robustness of the images 
to noisy variations during time, a simple but efficient 
approach, driven by empirical considerations, has been 
chosen. It consists in blending the current image with the 
previous blended image. The resulting image is named 
reference image. Equation (1) describes this temporal 
fusion. This method has the advantage to take care of the 
hypothesis (2) made in section III because it does not 
consider explicit background information for illumination 
noise removing. 
 
 
 
In (1), α represents a parameter that can increase or 
decrease the importance of the previous images over time. 
The lower α is, the higher their importance is. Therefore, 
having a low α is important to consequently reduce noise 
variations over time, but it also gives less importance to the 
current image and tends to generate a less precisely localized 
motion. In the proposed model, α has been set to 0.8 for 
color (grayscaled) images and to 0.2 for depth images in 
order to smooth the depth holes while not having a high 
incident on the motion localization described in Sections 
III.D.3 and III.D.4. 
Third, the noise from sound data is filtered with a low-
pass 6th order Butterworth filter using a cut off frequency of 
(1)

4 kilohertz designed on Matlab. It is then thresholded 
according to the intensity of its energy in order to avoid false 
detections coming from the ego-sound of the robot. The 
threshold used has been determined by analyzing energy 
values on 33 milliseconds records with and without external 
sound.  
D. Step 3 – Feature extraction 
This step represents the multiple processes that are 
applied to extract the interesting features used in the fusion 
step. It has been separated in two paths. The static path 
includes modalities that will always be detected. The 
dynamic path includes modalities that may be present at 
instant “t” but may be absent at instant “t+1”. After each 
process of a same step, resulting images are normalized. The 
results are shown on Fig 4. 
1)  2D salient areas localization: This process consists 
in applying a visual static saliency model to the previously 
grayscaled reference image. Like in [1], the model of [6] has 
been choosen for its efficency and its rapidity. Its principle 
is based on the spectral residual concept. The idea behind 
this is that salient areas on natural images (i.e., not artificial) 
may be considered as the less redundant ones. The method 
of [6] consists in applying a fast discrete two dimensional 
Fourier transform on a grayscale image of size 64 by 64 
pixels. A logarithmic transform and a 3 by 3 mean filter are 
then applied to the amplitude spectrum of this image. The 
spectral residual spectrum is obtained via the substraction of 
the mean logarithmic representation with the original 
amplitude spectrum. The inverse fast discrete 2D Fourier 
transform is then used with the spectral residual spectrum 
instead of the amplitude spectrum. The resulting image is 
filtered with a 7 by 7 gaussian filter in order to obtain a 2D 
saliency map representing gaussian salient areas. 
2)  Depth bias determination: The goal of this process is 
to make the depth reference image represent closest values 
with the highest intensities in order to use the depth bias 
concept of [5] in the fusion step. It provides the robot with a 
more human-like perception model. It also helps to consider 
the hypothesis (4) described in Section III. First, the image 
is subsampled to a resolution of 64 by 64 pixels in order to 
be spatially equivalent to the saliency map. Its intensity 
values are then inversed. Values that are out of the sensor’s 
range are set to zero in order to represent the absence of 
information. Finally, a closing operator with 3 by 3 
rectangular structuring element is applied in order to remove 
the small detected holes. 
3)  2D fine motion localization and fine salient motion 
bias determination: These processes aim to detect motion 
between consecutive reference images and to represent the 
saliency levels of the moving areas. This motion is 
considered as fine because it is detected on full resolution 
images. It is thus considered as able to capture motion 
having both small and high amplitudes. Since this process 
needs to be fast, a well known mean of the absolute 
difference operation is used via (2). The mean filter helps to 
remove false and small detected moving areas. Its size is of 
N by N pixels. N is equal to 7 in this model. 
The process described in Section III.D.1. is then applied 
on the resulting difference image. The obtained result 
represents the detected motion through a salient gaussian 
areas representation: the 2D fine salient motion bias. 
4) 3D coarse motion localization and coarse motion 
bias determination: These processes aim to detect motion 
between consecutive reference images that have been 
subsampled to a resolution of 64 by 64 pixels. It has been 
supposed to be only able to detect motions having a high 
enough amplitude. This motion is thus considered only if a 
fine motion as been detected. Moreover, since we have 
access to both depth and color (grayscaled) images, the 
coarse motion is detected on both in order to provide a more 
robust motion localization with the idea of a three 
dimensionnal motion. First, (2) is applied on the subsampled 
reference images. Second, an additive mean of the two 
difference images is realized in order to combine both 
motion representations. The result is binarized keeping only 
pixels with an intensity higher than 60% of the maximal 
possible value. The binarized areas are named blobs. Only 
blobs containing at least 40 pixels are considered as true 
moving areas. Their centroids are found and convoluted 
with a vertical gaussian whose size depends of the mean 
depth value obtained on a 3 by 3 area around the centroids. 
This representation is the 3D coarse motion bias. 
5) 1D sound localization and sound bias determination: 
The sound is localized on the horizontal dimension using 
the cross correlation and the Interaural Time Difference 
(ITD) of [8]. First, a sound buffer of 33 milliseconds is 
retrieved from the two microphones. The size of this buffer 
corresponds to the required time in order to get an image 
with the camera. A cross correlation between left and right

sound components is applied using a moving window of 20 
samples. The ITD is then determined. It gives the angle 
position of the detected sound in the robot coordinates. This 
angle is converted in the 64 by 64 image pixels coordinates 
and a vertical gaussian is set at the sound location according 
to [10]. This is the 1D sound bias. 
E. Step 4 – Feature fusion 
This step aims to obtain the final saliency map by 
successively combining the various detected features from 
step 3 according to the hypotheses developed in Section III. 
First, saliency and depth bias are combined through an 
element by element multiplication. This operation has been 
chosen in order to only impact the already salient areas. 
Then, the non-zero dynamic biases are successively added 
to the result. These operations are weighted additions in 
order to modify the relative saliency levels between the 
areas of the previously obtained image. The weights for fine 
motion, coarse motion and sound biases are respectively 
60%, 60% and 30% in order to give a lot of importance to 
motions. Since experiments have shown that sound cannot 
be localized as precisely as visual features and as it is added 
after the motions, its weight is lower than motions’ ones.  
F. Step 5 – Determination of human positions 
Human positions are retrieved using bounding boxes 
generated from the final saliency map.  Bounding boxes are 
localized over the areas with a final saliency intensity of at 
least 50% of the maximal possible intensity in order to 
eliminate outliers without advantaging precision nor recall. 
In order to define whether a detected bounding box 
should be considered as a human position, the correlation 
between a human being presence and the detected dynamic 
modalities has been learned. These modalities are 
represented by the dynamic biases and are the only available 
information sources that can help to make a decision about 
the eventual detection of a human being. The dataset 
described in Section IV has been used. The results are 
shown on Tab. 1. True positives (TP) correspond to a 
modality detection while a human is present, and false 
positives (FP) correspond to a detection when no human is 
present. True negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) are 
also represented. The total detected (TD) values indicate 
when a modality has been detected over all the images. 
Since all the false positive rates are low, it has been 
decided to use a simple binary decision for this model: if at 
least a fine motion or a sound has been detected, then it 
means that a human has been detected (i.e., is present).

At this step, detected bounding boxes may be classified 
using their mean saliency values in order to determine 
which area is the most interesting. This operation may be 
useful in order to keep only one area to guide the robot’s 
gaze towards the most interesting position. 
IV. 
EVALUATION OF THE RESULTS 
The results obtained by the proposed model have been 
evaluated on a dataset that has been acquired with the robot 
in two different rooms. It is made of 34 videos with 
durations between 7 and 20 seconds for a total of 10312 
images. Only 4 videos also include sound data. At least one 
human is present on a part of each video. This human may 
be moving, sitting, standing or talking at any distance from 
the robot, but he is not necessarily always in the field of 
vision of the camera. The videos have been manually 
annotated with the frame ranges on which humans are 
present. For 10 of these videos (2 with sound), annotations 
also include the bounding box locations (ground truth) 
corresponding to the human 2D positions.

First, the resulting bounding box locations from step 5 
have been compared with the ground truth using Matlab. 
The comparison method was to determine the precision, the 
recall and the F-measure between the bounding box areas 
obtained by the model and the ground truth. It has been 
determined that the model is able to generate a mean F-
measure of 66% with a precision of 77% for human 
localization. The detailed results are shown on Tab. 2. 
The following are a detailed explanation of these results. 
First, depth helps to increase both the recall and the 
precision of the human localization generated by the 
saliency. This corresponds to the fact that when humans are 
close to the robot, it is difficult to define very salient areas 
because humans are recovering a large amount of the image, 
it gives them an important spatial redundancy and induces 
difficulties for the method of [6]. Second, the hypotheses 
that have been made about the dynamic data are confirmed: 
they greatly improve the human localization. It is interesting 
to observe that the coarse motion bias does not improve the 
F-measure but the precision, and that the sound bias 
improves both the recall and the F-measure. Moreover, 
these results do not support the fact that humans may be 
detected even in the absence of dynamic data thanks to 
saliency. This means that one should use a specific detector 
on the detected areas in order to characterize them. In that 
case, the specific detector would not be used as an input of 
the model like in [12], but like a final recognition step.  
Third, since a fast model was desired through the 
hypothesis (5) detailed in Section III, the computational 
time of the proposed model has been evaluated at different 
instants in time after the algorithm has been adapted in C++. 
The robot is able to process incoming flow at a mean speed 
of 70 FPS, which is twice more than required to process 
every frame using the Asus Xtion Pro Live RGB-D camera.   
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, an original approach to detect and localize 
human beings using audiovisual attention’s concepts on an 
indoor companion robot has been presented. It is able to 
detect and localize humans at 70 FPS with a mean F-
measure of 66% and a precision of 77% using bounding 
boxes on a stationary robot.  
Since the proposed model uses motion and sound 
localization, future work will focus on studying the effect of 
ego motion compensation on this model using visual and 
non-visual odometry state-of-the-art methods. Adding a 
supplementary step in order to characterize detected areas 
while no dynamic data is available will also be studied.  The 
adaptation of the proposed model to other depth sensors will 
be considered in order to make it suitable for an outdoor 
use.

Abstract—Currently, the technological evolution has led to the
birth of the image processing discipline which processes and
analyzes images in different fields including marine image
processing. Identifying a dolphin from a picture which has sea
feature is difficult because the background of the picture is
complex and has some similarities with the target. For this
reason,
we
make
a
thorough
research
on
the
target
segmentation and the existing identification algorithms used to
solve this problem. In this paper, we will present a new
segmentation algorithm based on clustering threshold in the
RGB color space to process dolphin images. We will combine it
with the SIFT algorithm for image post-processing feature
extraction. Then we will present how to build a dolphin growth
model to identify a dolphin.

INTRODUCTION
In digital image processing, it is desired that the machine
recognition is capable of recognizing the object effectively
from the complicated image and make a judgment, same as
the human eye
discriminates. Therefore, research and
application of image segmentation technology and image
recognition technology are very significant. Now, image
recognition technology has been applied in more and more
fields, such as face recognition, medical image processing
and ocean image processing. We are interested in the
application
of
the
image
recognition
technology
in
recognizing dolphins.
Dolphins are some of the world's animals that are at risk
of extinction. When wild dolphins’ conservation experts
study the wild dolphin colonies, they often estimate the age
of dolphins by the artificial method. The method is that they
need to compare the photographs one by one to estimate the
age and distinguish individual dolphins according to the
characteristics of the surface of dolphins. For experienced
maritime workers, the correct rate of recognition of dolphin
is relatively high. However, in order to distinguish the
dolphins accurately, young marine workers need to take a lot
of time to learn. The artificial recognition method has a big
workload and high error rate. Therefore, we need to explore
a new method of image recognition to solve these problems.
Ma Yan et al. [1] proposed a new algorithm for automatic
object segmentation in different color space. Gondra et al. [3]
proposed a target segmentation algorithm based on machine
learning. The gray image segmentation is highly efficient.
The color image segmentation splits the image from different
color spaces. Lowe [5][6] proposes a SIFT feature extraction
algorithm with scale invariance. This algorithm is relatively
stable in feature extraction and it can effectively deal with
affine transformation and perspective transformation.
Each dolphin has its own characteristics, which can be
used to distinguish different dolphins. In this paper, we
improved the commonly used target segmentation algorithm
and the identification algorithm and apply it to the field of
dolphin image identification. We will present how to
distinguish the identity of the dolphins through image
recognition technology. We will present how to establish the
identification model and the growth model of dolphins based
on the surface characteristics of dolphins. We will also
present an automatic management process of dolphins’
image.
In Section 2, we will analyze dolphins target image
segmentation.
In
Section
3,
we
will
present
image
preprocessing and SIFT feature-matching algorithm. In
Section 4, we will present our growth model. In Section 5,
we will illustrate our experiments.

DOLPHINS TARGET IMAGE SEGMENTATION
In this paper, we need to segment the dolphins’ targets
from the background of sea image. However, there are a lot
of waves on the ocean surface, which can lead to incorrect
segmentation results. The color image segmentation divides
the image from different color spaces, as in [3][4]. The
image may be an image composed of multiple complex
images, and the gray image segmentation may not divide the
image, as in [1][2]. In this paper, we will propose two
methods of using the color image segmentation:

1)
Color image target segmentation;
2)
Manual target segmentation.
The color image target segmentation technology uses an
average clustering method. The dolphin image background is
seen as a category and the dolphin target as another category.
We used fuzzy C-means clustering methods to separate the
dolphin image from the original color image. Then we
obtained the dolphins’ image target.
The implementation of the specific steps is as follows:
3)
Determine the clustering center;
4)
Adaptively
determine
the
clustering
center
and
classify the dolphins image according to the clustering
strategy: sea background as class Ⅰ and dolphins target as
class Ⅱ;
5)
Separate class Ⅰ from the dolphin in the image to
obtain the dolphins of target class Ⅱ.
We use the distribution of RGB color components as the
scope of clustering in Figure 1. The integer value range of
RGB three components is from 0 to 255. These points are
contained within a quarter of the ball whose radius is 255; in
Figure 1, the ordinate represents G component, the abscissa
represents R component. Dolphin image pixel range is in the
black line and blue line around the area. The scope of pixels
of the water is in the red line and green line around the area.

After calculating the Euclidean distance of all the pixels

regard the area within the scope as the sea background and
the pixel is set to 0; the area that is beyond the scope is to
keep the original pixel distribution. The results are shown in
Figure 2.
Figure 2.
Image using color segmentation algorithm
Manual segmentation is done by manipulating the mouse
on the image, as shown in Figure 3. The blue line in Figure
3a is the route of the mouse in manual segmentation. Figure
3b is the goal and Figure 3c is the result after the image
segmentation. The steps of manual target segmentation are:
Firstly, mark the needed segmented regions, and set the
pixels of the image in the area to 1, the pixels of other areas
of the image to 0. Then the template image of Figure 3b is
obtained. Secondly, the result of the template image and
original image multiplication is the target image after
segmentation.

Manual target segmentation
Automatic target segmentation is more effective and has
fewer human errors. But if the image quality is low and it

needs higher segmentation precision, it is better to use
manual target segmentation.

IMAGE PREPROCESSING AND SIFT FEATURE
MATCHING ALGORITHM
In this section, we obtain the distribution of the spots on
the surface of dolphins by image preprocessing, and then we
can calculate these spots and establish the growth model of
dolphins.
A. Image pre-processing phase
The spots on the surface of the dolphin are the feature
points of the dolphin identification. The spots on the surface
of the dolphin are dense and vary in size, which will increase
computation of spots extraction, and produce errors easily.
So we have taken three steps to preprocess: remove the edge;
spot inflation; spot polymerization.
In this paper, we used Prewitt edge detection algorithm to
process the dolphin image that has been segmented, and
accurately detected the dolphins’ surface spots edge. At the
same time, manual segmentation region contour edge was
detected.
These
contours
can
produce
unnecessary
interference to identify the effect, so it needs to be removed.
We used 5*5 square matrix corrosion structure elements.
The target shape of the corrosion has not been changed, and
the image edge was removed.
Now, the dolphins’ surface spots are accurately marked
out. However, the spots very in size and are unevenly
distributed, which makes the statistics and identification
prone to error. We carry out the result by expansion
processing these spots, and make some small spots together,
as a new feature point. The structural elements of expansion
which we use is:

. We carried out on the spots three
times in the expansion operation.
We can see from the picture that small spots formed
together big spots, and features are more obvious.
B. SIFT feature matching algorithm
SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) features keep
the invariance to image scaling, rotation, scale brightness
unchanged, which is a very stable local l feature, as in [7],
thus has very extensive application value.
SIFT feature matching algorithm is used to identify the
matching function that can be divided into three phases. The
first stage is the feature point detection. Extract all of the
images for matching feature points. The second stage is the
feature descriptor. Add a detailed description for the local
feature of the extracted feature points. The third stage is to
generate the feature vector and feature vector match. Find
out the mutual matching feature points by comparing the
original image and the target image feature points, thus we
could establish the corresponding relationship between
objects.
We have found the key points and have given them
position, scale and direction information. However, we need
a special set of key vector to describe the key points of the
image and the key points that include not only the key, but
also include the pixels around the key points for its
contributions. Descriptor will be used as the basis of target
matching.
We took the 8 * 8 window centered on key points. The
squares of window are divided into groups with size of 4 * 4,
using statistical methods to obtain the gradient direction and
gradient magnitude in each group. In the end, the gradient
and direction of these different groups form a set of vectors.
This group can be used to describe the key point and the
descriptor. Being generated according to pixel of the key
points in the field, the descriptors have strong inhibition to
noise.

GROWTH MODEL
Jefferson et al. [8] had proposed to divide the Chinese
white dolphin into six age groups, but the boundary was not
clear. It was also not clear how to represent the ages. The
recognition criteria are shown in table I according to the
different age paragraphs.
TABLE I.

childhood skin color is dark gray, no spots,
body length smaller, body length is about 1/3
to 1/2 of adult; early youth individuals is

childhood, body length is about two-thirds of
the adult.

The change of Chinese white dolphins’ spots and the
change rule of age are shown in Figure 4. The horizontal axis
is the dolphins’ age, unit is the month. The vertical axis is the
number of feature points of the dolphins’ image detected.
Figure 4.
Dolphins spots variation
We can see that from born to 20 months old, the number
of the dolphins’ surface spots are sparse, and with the
passage of time, the number of spots gradually increased.
However, when dolphins are teenagers, there will be a
substantial increase in growth of the number of spots. When
the number of dolphins’ surface spots reached a peak, the
number of spots will decline rapidly. In the end, the spots of
38

dolphins disappear or there are only a few spots, which is the
sign of the maturation of the dolphin. So we can complete
statistics of dolphins’ age through statistics of the number of
their surface spots. But among the spots on the surface of the
dolphins, some are big and some are small. Therefore, we
expand the small spots in the image. The spots shape
characteristics are not changed when the small spots get
together. The size and number of the spots on the surface of
a dolphin are both the mark of a dolphin's age and identity.
For the experimental part, we used 190 dolphin images
provided by the Pearl River estuary Dolphin Conservation
base. 100 images are randomly selected from these images.
Then the selected images are processed automatically by
object segmentation, image preprocessing, and feature point
extraction.
Thus
their
feature
points
distributions
are
obtained, and then we obtain the images corresponding to
their age. The results are shown in Figure 5 which is the age
distribution of dolphins.
Figure 5.
The age distribution of dolphins
There are three conclusions in Figure 5.
1)
When the age of the dolphin is between 0 to 12
months old, the number of the key points detected on the
dolphin's surface is between 200 and 760.
2)
When the age of the dolphin is between 15 to 38
months old, the number of the key points detected on the
dolphin's surface is between 800 and 1200.
3)
When the dolphin's age is greater than 40 months,
the number of the key points detected on the dolphin's
surface is between 0 and 200.
V.
EXPERIMENTS
In this paper, we used 190 images of the White Dolphin
after artificial classification. Each image is attached with the
age information. We use 90 images as the experimental
object to verify the accuracy of the dolphins’ growth model.
90 images were processed in order to extract the feature
points, and to determine the age of dolphins according to the
number of feature points. The results were compared with
the results of the dolphin protection workers. Through the
experiment, the correct rate using dolphins’ growth model to
estimate the age of the dolphins was 85%, the remaining
15% of the error rate is because there are some waves in the
dolphins’ image covering the key points. However, due to
the high transparency of the waves, the human eye can see
the spots on the surface of the dolphins through the spray,
and identify the dolphin's age.
The matching strategy judges the dolphin's identity
through
key
points.

The matching rate of the experimental result was 80%.
After more than three sets of experiments, it can be
shown when the rotation, occlusion and other factors
influence the image; the recognition rate is still higher than
60%. SIFT feature extraction algorithm is very effective in
the use of dolphin identification.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied the dolphin image
segmentation, the image preprocessing, and key point
detection. Then, we summed up the relationship between the
key quantity and dolphin age, and the dolphin growth model.
Through the experiment, we used a dolphin growth model to
estimate the age of the dolphins and the correct rate was 85%.
Finally, the key points can be used to accurately describe the
characteristics of the image. The accuracy of the dolphin
matching is measured, and the accuracy rate is above 60%.
In this paper, the growth model of dolphins established by
key points can estimate the age of dolphins by the number of
key points. But when the part of the key points of dolphins’
surface are covered, the result is not accurate. In the future,
we will study how to use probability estimation to estimate
the dolphin's age when the key points of the dolphin are
covered.

Abstract— A 2013 Decision of the European Parliament and of 
the Council requires relevant national and appropriate sub-
national level authorities to establish risk assessments covering 
the full spectrum of consequences. These may be expressed in 
terms of human, environmental, economic, and political/social 
impacts. Modern society is increasingly dependent on critical 
infrastructure and on the services that it provides. The loss of 
one of these services may hit the public immediately in manners 
which are not always predictable. Furthermore, the amount of 
time that a given service is unavailable will affect other services 
through numerous direct and indirect dependencies, which are 
seldom considered. Natural or man-made disasters, and 
combinations of both, will have effects that are difficult or 
impossible to foresee without the appropriate tools. Due to the 
rapid progress in electronic communications and information 
technology, one would expect today’s crisis managers to have 
access to situational awareness and to the tools needed to inform 
their decisions. While much has been achieved for single-service 
operational headquarters like those of police, firefighting and 
ambulance services, there are no solutions that address the 
interactions and interdependencies of all critical functions and 
all critical infrastructure in a Public Protection and Disaster 
Response context. If a crisis develops when some aspect of 
critical infrastructure is partly or completely unavailable, crisis 
managers must make decisions using a very different 
framework compared to that used to handle limited incidents in 
normal times. Considering the difficulties resulting from the 
dependencies and interdependencies of critical infrastructure in 
normal times, making good decisions is becoming more and 
more difficult for crisis managers during a crisis. These 
challenges, combined with the enormous and possibly tragic 
consequences of suboptimal crisis management, provide good 
reasons to explore the subject.

 INTRODUCTION 
The main objective and ambition of the Visual Protection 
of Critical Infrastructure (Visual PCI) project is to create a 
coherent system for visualisation of all crisis management 
activities and assets able to handle full real-life complexity. 
There are many existing visualisation systems for specific 
aspects of crisis management, but all are strictly focused on 
their own narrow slice of the crisis management domain. Our 
goal is extremely ambitious: there is no known system capable 
of visualising all aspects of a crisis management situation 
simultaneously.  
Visual PCI’s ambition is to provide a novel and integrated 
tool for risk assessment, planning activities and crisis 
management at international, national, and appropriate sub-
national levels. 
The value of a system as a whole is generally much greater 
than the sum of the values of its parts considered in isolation: 
it is much better to have a car than just to have four wheels. 
The same is true for IT systems and simulation systems. A 
system capable of coherently simulating or visualising several 
aspects of a phenomena can also take into account 
interdependencies and feedback between those aspects, so 
raising the quality of simulation or visualisation to an entirely 
new level.  
Consequently, the main value of Visual PCI is to create a 
coherent visualisation system capable of handling multiple 
aspects of crisis management at the same time, in accordance 
with selection criteria applied by the end user. Such a wider 
view will allow the end user to perceive interdependencies 
between various crisis-related phenomena and activities that 
could otherwise pass unnoticed. Thus the project will allow an 
appreciation of a crisis situation having a completeness far 
beyond the abilities of any existing system. The project’s 
primary contribution is to allow interaction with – and 
visualisation of – the multiple layers that are relevant under 
disaster emergency conditions. The project will also build on 
the work done in the coMap project[1], which explored the 
specific roles which people should have when making 
decisions using table-top visualisation systems, and how such 
policies can be enforced.  
If accepted by relevant end users, at national or even 
European level, Visual PCI has the potential to influence 
standardisation activities, as implied by [2],  [3],  and [4]. 
Because Visual PCI will rely on standards already used at 
a European level, data input from statistics and geospatial data 
will be facilitated, and previously-developed models may be 
used with no or little modification by all implementations. 
Thus, the use of Visual PCI in Member States is facilitated, 
while a federation of implementations may serve at European 
level. 
Visual PCI will be designed to be used in different 
configurations comprising: 
• 
A stand-alone solution, 
• 
Multiple identical implementations in a distributed 
architecture to maximise Information Assurance by 
means of redundancy, 
• 
Inside a federation to allow exchange between 
neighbouring implementations,

In a hierarchical structure able to respond to 
organisational concepts and to provide scalability,

RELATED WORK 
The Visual PCI project is aware of some recent projects in 
related areas of national risk assessment, public protection and 
disaster response as well as critical infrastructure. The 
following projects have been analysed for their relevance; 
Visual PCI differs from all of these in the novelty of its 
integrated tool for risk assessment, activity planning, and 
crisis management at international, national and appropriate 
sub-national level, accommodating human, environmental, 
economic and political/social impacts. 
CRISADMIN: Critical Infrastructure Simulation of 
Advanced Models on Interconnected Networks resilience [5], 
was concerned with the evaluation of the impact of large 
catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks on critical 
infrastructure, by deploying/developing a decision support 
system. 
THREVI2: Threat-Vulnerability Path Identification for 
Critical Infrastructures [6] focussed on: identification of 
potential hazards and threats to CI systems; assessing the 
vulnerability of CI systems or components against these 
hazards; and defining accurate scenarios. 
FACIES: Online Identification of Failure and Attack on 
Interdependent 
Critical 
Infrastructures 
[7] 
defined 
cooperation strategies for automatic detection of failures and 
attacks on CI, by promptly identifying a failure and/or attack 
on several interdependent types of critical infrastructure. 
CISIM set out to improve an existing framework for 
simulating the resilience of critical information and 
communication technologies of CT) infrastructure against 
threats, such as power failures, floods and terrorist attacks. 
DISASTER 2.0: This project [8] investigated ways of 
strengthening public resilience to disasters by identifying: 
technologies, such as social media and semantic webs, that 
government organisations use to communicate with the 
public; innovative ways in which these technologies have 
been used; and how the public use these technologies during 
disasters. 
CRISMA: Modelling crisis management for improved 
action and preparedness [9], this project focused on large scale 
crisis scenarios with often irreversible immediate and 
extended 
human, 
societal, 
structural 
and 
economic 
consequences and impacts. The project developed a 
simulation-based decision support system for modelling crisis 
management, aiding improved action and preparedness. 
DRIVER: The Driving Innovation in Crisis Management 
for European Resilience) project [10] is developing an 
environment that will allow research and innovation to 
flourish in crisis management. The experiments that it enables 
may inform the building of scenarios for Visual PCI. 
Finally, the use of a multi-touch table in disaster 
management is explored in [11]; this is just one aspect of the 
remit of Visual PCI. 
III. 
VISUALISATION 
The rapid development approach to a risk assessment 
support tool through visualisation with the early involvement 
of end users is the key to the success of Visual PCI. 
Visualisation of model building, data input, situational 
awareness and simulation is essential for user ergonomics. 
While the basic components for visualisation must be 
developed by IT professionals, it is also necessary that trained 
end users can add and modify elements in order to refine the 
models. Visualisation will provide confidence to end users 
about their ability to use Visual PCI and to improve the 
solution over time by fine-tuning the models. Visualisation 
will produce confidence in making risk assessments by 
allowing the navigation of risk chains through mouse clicks in 
order to check the origins of given risks and their impacts. 
Visualisation will also support situational awareness by 
producing maps with overlays providing relevant information 
about incidents, Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) 
resources and critical infrastructure services. Finally, Visual 
presentation of alternative courses of action will support crisis 
managers' decision process. 
For example, the visualisation of Fig. 1 illustrates the 
dependency of the road network on electrical power. During 
blackouts, the lack of security services in tunnels, of 
illumination, and of control by traffic lights reduces the 
capacity of the road network. 
The visualisations will also show time-driven effects like 
the build-up of traffic jams or changes in strategic fuel stocks. 
Slow and fast motion can be used as required by end users. 
Visual PCI requires the following components: 
• 
A robust visualisation component to facilitate the 
input and interpretation of information, the adaptation 
of models and the creation of scenarios to provide 
planning support for working groups and situational 
awareness and decision support for crisis managers.

• 
A database holding statics and discrete information 
regarding population, environment, economic and 
political/social aspects, as well critical infrastructure 
and PPDR elements. The data required will be driven 
by the area of responsibility of the implementing end 
user. 
• 
A computation environment, allowing the models to 
compute risk assessments and to run simulations 
regarding the impact of threats and hazards. 
• 
A lightweight and flexible interface infrastructure for 
heterogeneous data sources allowing the updating of 
relevant data from different stakeholders, including 
real-time data from sensors. 
• 
A 
document-generation 
capacity 
to 
produce 
periodical and updated risk assessments as required 
by end users. 
IV. 
VISUALISATION: POSSIBLE SCENARIO  
The following section explains how a planning group 
would use the interface during an incident. 
As seen in the background of the figure 2, the interface 
consists of a large display providing selected information 
about a plane crash for the entire planning group, while an 
interactive table is used by a reduced number of people from 
the core team to make the actual decisions. The types of screen 
provided by Visual PCI will be in line with identified user 
requirements. 
The large, wall-mounted display provides key statistics, 
still and live pictures showing the incident, the evolution over 
time of the number of victims confirmed and remaining at the 
site, and the first responder coverage capacity at the site. In 
the lower right, the functional layer of the highway system 
shows possible access routes and the expected delays 
ambulances will encounter. Zooming into the incident area 
provides details of the chosen location. 
The concept of Visual PCI will allow planning groups to 
input a minimum of data to set the scene for a scenario. Once 
the site and the date/time have been chosen, Visual PCI is able 
to extract from its database the information required to display 
the vicinity of the scenario, to estimate the traffic situation and 
to provide the probable number of people around the site. 
(This is not an exhaustive list of possible data types.) The 
information will be presented immediately in a way which is 
designed to avoid information overload and to reduce the time 
needed to reach decisions. 
The team will then input the data relating to the incident. 
In the case of a plane crash, it is necessary to provide the 
number and categories of victims. The presumed injuries of 
the survivors will dictate the urgent work load of the rescuers. 
It will also be possible to predict the time necessary to register 
the victims and thus provide this information with a delay (as 
in real world accidents). Weather conditions may be chosen 
as a function of the season. 
Visual PCI will show the PPDR resources available to 
intervene on the site, such as police patrols, ambulance crews 
and firefighters active or on standby in the region. The data 
available on traffic density and the weather conditions will 
dictate the travelling times to the scene. The use of blue lights 
by the emergency services will be considered by the 
simulation. 
In risk assessment mode, Visual PCI will use a model 
response to simulate the evacuation of wounded people to 
hospitals. This simulation may then be repeated by Visual PCI 
for varying crash sites, number of wounded people and 
date/timing considerations. 
The same scenario may be used for training crisis 
managers. In this setting, the model will wait for trainee input 
before dispatching PPDR resources. Fig. 3 provides a possible 
screenshot of the interactive table during training. Visual PCI 
may be configured to provide to the trainee key with 
information about predicted outcomes of possible decisions. 
Those may include traffic information or reduced emergency 
service efficiency for non-optimal options. This function will 
speed up training and enhance the confidence of the trainee 
through the provision of visual feedback.

In planning mode, selected scenarios developed by 
particular planning groups may be used by planning boards 
having differing vocations and expertise. This multi-
disciplinary approach will enhance overall effectiveness. 
The Visual PCI system will make use of a variety of 
technologies. For example, we expect to use Kivy1 (an open 
source Python library) to allow for interaction on the multi-
touch surface. Kivy is also cross-platform, ensuring that the 
outputs of the project are not tied to a particular vendor. 
Additionally, 
an 
appropriate 
3D 
modelling/game 
environment, such as Unity 3D 2  or perhaps open source 
alternatives such as Crystal Space 3 will be considered. In 
order to allow for iterative and rapid development, high level 
programming languages such as Python or Ruby will be used. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Visual PCI will simplify and optimise risk management, 
planning and crisis management and therefore speed up 
recovery and costs and the number of victims. But Visual PCI 
will bring even more: 
Visual PCI will know the local critical infrastructure and 
its dependencies and interdependencies. It has the capabilites 
being adaptable to local circumstances and of following the 
evolution of the infrastructure. 
While Visual PCI is for crisis managers, the tool may also 
be used to detect infrastructure weaknesses and to predict 
future bottlenecks if fast-growing infrastructure outpaces the 
evolution of supporting structures. Therefore, Visual PCI has 
the potential to assist not only in risk assessments and PPDR 
planning, but also in national or regional development 
activities. 
Visual PCI has the potential to influence the development 
of European Resilience Management Guidelines and 
demonstration through its pilot implementation.

Abstract— Incremental classification is still a challenge with an 
important industrial impact by allowing a class training 
process simplification. Recently, works on Incremental 
Growing Neural Gas (IGNG) have demonstrated the ability of 
this technology to cope with this challenge for Optical 
Character 
Recognition(OCR)-based 
image 
classification. 
Previous proposals focused on the classifier itself but did not 
deal with descriptors which were not in the scope of these 
studies taking an a priori fixed descriptors set. This 
assumption is not applicable in real-life when the environment 
is progressive and the incremental system does not know a 
priori the image content to learn. In this paper we proposed an 
enhancement of an incremental system based on an IGNG 
extension (A2ING) with a combination of graphical, re-using 
the Blurred Shape Model (BSM), and a novel strategy based on 
incremental textual descriptors. Performance achievement 
shows a better precision with an acceptable recall than 
predefined descriptors.  The benefit is to not require a prior 
descriptors selection.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Even if more and more documents are managed by 
electronic exchanges, the paper document is still used and 
need an image capture for automatic processing. Moreover, 
the increasing use of mobile devices generates nowadays a 
large volume of images which can be digitized papers 
(receipts, etc.) or natural scene image with text (a board, an 
advertisement, etc.) all so-called documents. It is an 
industrial challenge to classify all these images for indexing, 
archiving or business processing. In this paper, we are 
interested in supervised image classification containing 
textual information. 
Currently, we use an OCR-based system with a 
supervised classifier. Each class is known and for the 
training, we have representative images preprocessed by the 
OCR. A word-class pair weight is calculated to extract 
specific words featuring the document classes. Thus, 
learning algorithms calculate the proximity between images 
and predict which class the document belongs to. We can use 
different standard algorithms: Support Vector Machine 
(SVM), Naïves Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN). 
To set-up these systems, we need an a priori groundtruth 
with labelled document by class. These methods are usually 
efficient but we face to limitations and new needs:  
• 
adding easily a new class in the system,  
• 
discovering new data along the process, 
• 
reducing the number of sample, 
• 
processing big data. 
 
Incremental classification approaches [9] can 
theoretically manage these issues. Similarly to supervised 
approaches, incremental classification systems require a 
feature vector to model the problem. For instance, an image 
can be represented by its pixels. For a text-based document, 
the vector could be a bag-of-words. As we will see for this 
last case, an issue lies in the selection of these words. The 
number of descriptors is problematic as well. How many 
have to be selected to represent our vector, knowing that the 
vector length cannot be growing?  
Proposals on incremental classification are numerous 
[6][10][14]. We chose to use the Active Incremental 
Growing Neural Gas (A2ING) algorithm which is one of 
most recent proposals. Our contribution is not yet on the 
A2ING itself but we propose a novel method based on the 
A2ING to classify incrementally textual document without a 
priori knowledge using both a shape-based vector and a 
dynamic text-based vector discovering significant words 
throughout the process.  
In section II, we introduce the A2ING and some related 
systems. Hence, we describe our system enhancement in 
section III and comment our results in section IV. 
Perspectives are given as conclusion in section V. 
II. RELATED WORKS 
Incremental classification is not a new method in 
machine learning. Basically, incremental classification learns 
along the process to cover the samples representation space 
according to given descriptors. Its benefits are plural. As it 
learns along the process, it does not need all necessary 
classes at the beginning and thus, can discover new data. 
When a class has enough elements to classify documents, it 
stops asking the class label to the user [9]. So, we can reduce 
the number of sample for each class. 
Polikar et al.[14] gives an overview of several algorithms 
for incremental classification. Some of them are an evolution 
of classical algorithms (incremental SVM [12], Incremental 
K-means [15]).  Other approaches are based on Incremental 
Growing Neural Gas (IGNG) and variations like the one 
proposed by Hamza & al.[6] for clustering (unsupervised

classification). Among IGNG family, Bouguelia & al.[9][10] 
have proposed an incremental semi-supervised classifier 
(A2ING). This system is introduced below (Figure 1). 
 
 
Figure 1.   Rafik Bouguelia’s A2ING general scheme[10]. 
 (1) Each object X is represented as a vector. When an 
unknown object X is classified (2), according to an 
informativeness criteria, the object is rejected (3) for user 
annotation or predicted to a class C. During the annotation 
(3) the user can give an existing class reinforcing (4) the 
system or create dynamically a new class to expend the 
system scope (4).  
Theoretically, the system is never ending. It adapts itself 
due to the ability of introducing a new class on real-time. 
Drawbacks, all these different algorithms rely on a set of 
fixed descriptors to feature all classes, usually, a vector X 
representing the object to classify. The performance comes 
from both the classifier and the feature vector to figure out 
discriminations. In all the quoted references, different feature 
vectors are used showing the flexibility of the classifier to 
various problems. Bouguelia [9] experimented normalized 
snippet pixels to feature characters, temporal and spatial 
features for on-line characters, bag-of-words for textual 
documents, etc. In any case, the vector is defined a priori, 
fixed size and hence, it closes obviously the ability to feature 
a new problem. For instance, when using a bag-of-words 
which does not include English words, you cannot classify a 
document written in English.   
Literature offers many descriptor proposals oriented for 
the classification purpose: for detecting human being in a 
scene, we can use gradients, colours information [11]; for 
handwriting/machine print classification, we can measure 
linearity and profile regularity on pseudo words [16]; for 
logo classification or document classification, we can use a 
Blurred Shape Model [3] or pixel density quantification on 
patches [4]; for structure document classification, layout 
feature or structural features can be used [2]; LLAH 
approaches for retrieving textual documents [7]; and 
weighted bag-of-words for text classification [5]. Bag-of-
words are usually large vectors of words where each word 
defines a dimension. 
To summarize all these experiences, graphical or pixel based 
descriptors are fine for structured information (forms, logo, 
tables, etc.) but less efficient in case of variable document 
structures (news, emails, etc.). Text-based descriptors are 
more robust to the document structure variation, allowing 
natural language text classification. These descriptors are 
words or group of words supposed to be discriminant for the 
classification. To select this lexicon, a previous statistical 
analysis of the domain is required. Basically, Term 
Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) 
methods [5] can be applied. 
According to us, the definition of the feature vector for 
the incremental classification of textual images is a 
bottleneck. Moreover, we cannot plan neither the domain nor 
the structure of any new image class appearing along our 
process. 
Hamza and al.[6] and Bouguelia and al.[10] successfully 
experimented textual features (bag-of-words) for textual 
documents incremental classification. However, they never 
discussed the lexicon selection because this topic was not in 
the center of their works. They suppose a preprocessing stage 
to define the vector before to start the incremental learning. 
Here, a prior TF analysis on text samples was performed to 
select words for the vector. This preprocessed word learning 
stage is contradictory with our incremental classification 
objectives. An additional difficulty is that the feature vector 
proposed for the A2ING shall be fixed-size. This is due to 
the used vector distance function (cosine or euclidian). 
Notice the similar issue for many standard classifiers (SVM, 
Perceptron…).  But obviously, the bag-of-words dimension 
depends on the variability and complexity of the corpus 
vocabulary. It differs from a domain to another. [5] 
demonstrates on different corpus (Popol and Reuters) the 
impact of the vector dimension on classification results. A 
generic model cannot be a fixed-size vector. 
Deep Learning approaches [17][18] offer today a strategy 
to avoid the explicit feature selection. For instance, quoted 
reference authors apply deep learning for text understanding 
from character-level inputs. They use temporal convolutional 
networks to let the system discovers relevant features. Even 
if this approach is interesting, it is not yet compatible for 
incremental learning based on few samples discovered along 
the process. 
As described above, image analysis approaches provide 
generic structural and holistic descriptors but they are 
inefficient and difficult to tune [4] for poorly structured 
documents. Unfortunately, they often appear in our image 
workflow (receipts, invoices, bank notice, payslips, etc.)  
To cope with this challenge, we design an innovative and 
real full incremental system for textual document images.  
III. PROPOSAL 
We propose to combine a standard shape-based 
descriptor and an original adaptive and generic textual 
descriptor with the A2ING. 
A. Shape-based classification 
Many shape-based descriptors are compliant to document 
incremental classifiers because they can be fully computed 
during the process, they are fixed-size, and they are 
independent of the document semantic or the document 
content (genericity). For all these reason, we propose to use a 
46

shape-based vector. One of them is the Blurred Shape Model 
(BSM)[3]. The BSM splits the picture in 8x8 squares and 
each square is calculating from a blur pixel representation. 
We have chosen this method due the simplicity and the 
demonstrated efficiency on various document image 
classification problems: structured document classification, 
and logo classification [8]. 
 
Figure 2.  Example of blurred image by the BSM 
But, this method is not efficient on semi-structured 
textual document because in this case the information is 
more carried by the text and words than the structure itself.  
B. Text-based classification 
Hence, a text-based vector for textual classification is an 
alternative method when the classification depends on 
accurate semantic textual information. Secondly, we can 
have documents (text in a natural scene) without recurrent 
structural information.  
In the initial A2ING, the text-based vector is pre-
computed. Our proposal is to enhance the system by 
dynamically discovering and expending the dimension of the 
text-based vector along the system life.  
At the beginning, the feature vector X of the A2ING is 
empty (no dimension). Then, the vector Xi with i dimension 
is enlarged by n dimensions ( Xi+n = Xi U wn ) when a set wn 
of n “relevant” words are discovered to model a new class. 
This definition is compatible with an Euclidian distance 
because wn new features are valued to 0 for any existing 
classes (already modelled by the Xi vector). At this stage, 
any new classes will be modelled by the Xi+n vector. 
The issue is both to discover the wn features and to 
decide when the text-based vector dimension shall be 
enlarged. 
The discovery of relevant words for text classification is 
not a new topic. There are several statistical metrics in the 
state-of-the-art to figure out the relevance of words in a 
corpus. The most well-known method [5] is based on the 
Term Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency (TF/IDF). 
Basically, selected words are those frequent for one class and 
not frequent in all the others. It means selected words are 
discriminative. A more semantic method named Latent 
Semantic Analysis is used to make correlations between 
words in a document. It produces topic features instead of 
word features. Finally, these methods calculate a weight of a 
word or a concept to rank them. The selection is given by the 
top weights according to the ranking.  
These statistic approaches need a representative training 
set to model several variables: language, domain, classes, 
etc. In our case, all these issues cannot be pre-defined 
because we do not know anything about captured images. 
Bouillot [5] demonstrates that there is no best solution for 
all the cases but the only metric which is both dependent of 
an image class and independent of others is the Term 
Frequency. Far to be the best metric, TF is interesting 
because it can be computed incrementally each times a new 
sample appears without constraint from other classes and 
future unknown classes.  
In this study, we propose the Term Frequency as a first 
approach for the wn evaluation. 
Most m frequent terms Wm(k)  for a class k give some 
key recurrent features for an image sample of the class. 
Statistically, we except Wm(k) to be included (at least 
partially) within the terms of the image related to k. Let 
suppose we have j dimensions for the feature vector Xj, the 
vector Tj is the terms of an image limited to the identified Xj 
features and Xj(k) is the A2ING instanced model vector for a 
class k:  
the distance D(k)=Tj- Xj(k) is minimized for the class k 
when Wm(k) is included in Xj because Wm(k) should be 
included in Tj as explained above. Then, the A2ING can 
predict this class. 
If Wm(k)  is not included in Xj, the distance D(k) is 
maximized and the informativeness criteria of the A2ING 
will reject the prediction. In this case Xj+m = Xj U Wm(k) will 
minimize D for the class k and in the same time may 
maximize D for any other class. The prediction is enhanced. 
The feature vector is dynamically enlarged. 
The issue is to select the n terms wn among Wm(k) to add 
to the vector X. In this first study we propose to limit wn to 
the n words with the best TF value for the class k and which 
are not yet in X when an image prediction is rejected. 
Actually, we set n to 1 to get the most frequent term not yet 
in X representing k. But it may happen that few terms occur 
always together due to an equal TF. With this strategy, we 
introduce a minimum number of “best” terms. If added terms 
are sufficient and discriminative to predict the class, then the 
incremental classification is optimal, otherwise the system 
will wait for further samples. The system will manage itself 
up to a sufficient number of terms to predict a class. 
What happens if the system can never learn an image 
class and the X vector increase as infinite? This could be 
dramatic, moreover if image class samples occur frequently. 
To be honest, we have not yet deal with this question which 
is a perspective. For the moment we threshold the system to 
a maximum number of M considering that if the system 
cannot learn an image class with M Terms means the class is 
unpredictable. 
Another difficult question is to decide when Wm(k) is 
relevant. If only few images were captured for a class k, 
W(k) is not representative. Waiting for more samples to take 
a decision will delay the incremental learning, by keeping X 
out of W(k) inputs. This question is still to be explored. We 
have not yet found out a solution and we work around with a 
47

parameter giving a minimum number of samples to threshold 
the TF. This parameter can be set by experiments. 
C. Multi-classifier-based classification 
We can describe our system by the figure 3 below. 
 
Figure 3.  Schema of classification process 
The BSM vector is computed directly on the image. The 
text classifier needs an OCR processing to compute the Text 
Vector X. The combination of both is a cooperative-
concurrent classifiers.  
1) Concurrent classifiers 
Each classifier is an A2ING based classifier allowing 
parallel incremental learning. Each one has its own feature 
vectors: BSM Vector and Text Vector.  
2) Cooperative classifiers 
Both A2ING deliver a class prediction. Each answer (red 
link in figure 3) can be used as a feedback for the other to 
learn without waiting for the end-user feedback. End-user 
feedback

enables 
the 
TF 
computation for the Text Vector selection (if needed). 
IV. RESULT COMPARISON 
We have experimented our proposal on the ITESOFT 
corpus that Bouguelia used for its measures. We describe this 
corpus below. Reusing this corpus, we can compare our 
proposal to the “a priori” defined textual vector as in [9][10]. 
A. Dataset 
The ITESOFT corpus is available on demand according a 
NDA. Images are machine-printed document like invoices, 
mails, forms, etc. We have both TIF images and OCR 
readings. Thus, we can easily use shape and text vectors.  
The corpus includes two datasets so-called MMA and 
LIRMM. MMA contains 2591 images divided on 25 classes. 
LIRMM contains 1951 images and 24 classes. To compare 
with Bouguelia, the dataset is splitted in two parts:  
• 
Learning phase: to initialize a classifier and do not 
measure from scratch because the lack of samples 
biaised the measure. We take 2/3 of the dataset. 
• 
Test phase: measure on remaining documents (1/3 of 
the corpus) while the classifier continues to learn. 
B. Results on different approaches 
We evaluate each single A2ING and the combination 
(table 1). We compare to initial Bouguelia works (table 2). 
For the quantification of the classification performance, we 
used the standard Recall and Precision measures like in [9].

BSM has the worst performance because the corpus 
contains mainly semi-structured documents. This vector is 
efficient only on very structured images. Hence the 
performance of the Multi-classifier really comes from the 
Text-classifier. However, BSM is useful for a part of the 
dataset: few classes with structured images and very few 
instances of image. In this case, the TF does not reach our 
threshold to be learnt by the Text-classifier. 
Result difference between LIRMM and MMA is explained 
by different corpus complexity (more variability [9]).

vector A2ING and our proposal come from Bouguelia report

Unquestionably, recall is much better with Bouguelia 
approach while the precision is better with our system. 
However, performances are quite acceptable when you 
consider that the system started from scratch. It demonstrates 
both that descriptors can be learnt incrementally and that an 
A2ING can cope with a growing feature vector. 
Our analysis shows two important reasons of the reduced 
performance:  
• 
First comes for the selection of the vector X. Only 
based on the TF metric, iteratively updated by image 
along the processing of each dataset, we cannot 
converge to the same dictionary than a pre-computed 
TF/IDF. The table III demonstrates the difference. In 
our proposal we retrieve more than 91% of the 
TF/IDF dictionary from [9]. This is very good but 
we introduce a lot of unexpected additional words. 
They are for instance named entities (first name, last 
name, city names, etc.) or unrelevant words (natural 
48

langage syntactic operator like “like” “you”, “of”, 
“the”…) occurring in many images. For MMA the 
text variability is larger hence many best frequent 
words are not so frequents even if they are still the 
best frequent. The impact is to increase the D 
distance and in consequence the rejection. Positively 
it impacts the precision but it is a side effect.

• 
A second reason is the learning delay of our 
approach. First learnt classes are re-learnt during the 
process because the first learnt classes are only based 
on a small X vector. The increasing of selected 
features maximizes the distance with previous learnt 
classes when a learnt class shares some new 
introduced descriptors. Fortunately, the system 
manages itself the relearning but introduces a delay 
in the network convergence and of course, more 
feedback from the user. Notice that 10% recall 
difference is 10% more rejection and hence, 10% 
more user feedbacks. In perspective, we plan to 
evaluate larger corpus to analyse this issue.  
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
All these observations show the importance of the feature 
selection criteria. TF seems an interesting proposal because 
independent of other classes but not yet sufficient to filter 
unexpected terms. For instance generic terms shared by 
different classes are filtered by the IDF. The exploration of 
the criteria enhancement is a major perspective, like 
simulating the IDF or exploring the TF standard deviation. 
The system was set-up for text vectors. However, our 
statistic approaches to discover a feature and embed it into 
A2ING is generic for any kind to feature which we can be 
observed within images. Our principle of a full incremental 
system for image classification could help computer vision 
and robotics to adapt to different progressive environments. 
In conclusion we demonstrate both that we can have a 
full incremental efficient system, starting from scratch with 
really no prior knowledge and that an A2IGN can cope with 
a dynamic incremental feature vector. This system gives 
acceptable performance and several perspectives exist.

Abstract—An efficient algorithm is proposed not only to reduce 
the computation cost of the hash-based intra block copy (IBC), 
but also to achieve the Bjontegaard delta bit rate (BDBR) gain 
for High Efficiency Video Coding standard (HEVC) screen 
content coding(SCC). Recently, the HEVC Screen Content 
Coding Draft 6 was published including several new tools. 
Among those, hash-based intra block copy shows the high 
coding gain but it has a massive computational complexity 
even though it is adopted as a fast algorithm for global block 
search for IBC mode. The proposed algorithm suggests the 
effective way to calculate the lower bound for rate-distortion 
(RD) cost when performing the hash-based IBC process and to 
eliminate the impossible candidates earlier. Experimental 
results show that about 50% on the average and up to 86.80% 
of the search points can be early terminated as well as 0.21% 
on the average BDBR saving can be achieved compared to 
HM-16.8+SCM-6.1.

 INTRODUCTION  
High Efficiency Video Coding standard (HEVC) [1] is 
the most recent international video coding standard jointly 
developed by Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding 
(JCT-VC) and it was finalized in January 2013. HEVC is 
able to achieve around 50% bit-rate reduction under the 
equivalent subjective visual quality circumstances, compared 
with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC standard [2][3]. 
Recently, on the other hand, there has been a 
proliferation of applications which utilize the computer 
generated contents, such as wireless display, remote desktop, 
external display interfacing, and cloud computing, etc. [4]. 
However, the type of video content used in these applications 
has different characteristics compared with that of the 
camera-captured content, such as containing no sensor noise, 
having large uniformly flat areas, repeated patterns, and a 
limited number of different colors and so on.  
Even though there are several sequences that contain 
screen contents in the common test sequences, such as Class 
F, HEVC may not be efficient for the sequences whose 
characteristics are different from the camera-captured natural 
video contents because it was developed with a main focus 
on dealing with camera-captured natural video contents. 
Accordingly, there have been requirements for coding of 
screen content. In order to reflect these requirements, the 
MPEG Requirements subgroup published a set of 
requirements for an extension of HEVC for coding of screen 
content in January 2014 [4] and currently the HEVC Screen 
Content Coding (SCC) Draft 6 was published in February 
2016 [5][6]. 
In HEVC-SCC, 4 major techniques/tools have been 
introduced: Palette mode, Adaptive colour transform (ACT), 
Adaptive motion vector resolution, and Intra block copy 
(IBC). Palette mode utilizes the observation that a number of 
different colour value frequently exist for screen content. A 
lot of HEVC-SCC test materials consist of RGB colour 
format or YCbCr 4:4:4 format, whose inter-colour 
component correlation is very high. In order to remove inter-
colour component redundancy, ACT has been introduced in 
SCC. Unlike camera captured content, there is no need to use 
fractional motion compensation for much screen content. For 
this reason, adaptive motion vector has adopted in SCC. 
There are a lot of repeated patterns such as characters in 
screen content, so the motion estimation and compensation 
within the current picture can be effective. IBC is the 
technique that conducts the motion estimation and 
compensation within the current picture as shown in Fig. 1. 
In HEVC-SCC Draft 6, there are two kinds of block 
vector search method for IBC: local search mode and global 
search mode and hash-based block vector search technique 
has been adopted for global search mode. This paper 
provides an overview of technical issues of IBC and presents 
a tool for improving IBC, especially hash-based block vector 
search.

INTRA BLOCK COPY (IBC) IN HEVC-SCC DRAFT 6 
Basically, IBC is the technique that conducts the motion 
estimation (ME) and compensation within the current picture. 
Block matching is performed in order to find the optimal 
block vector and to calculate the lowest rate-distortion (RD) 
cost like ME but within a current picture. On the other hand, 
there are two kinds of IBC modes in SCC: local block vector 
search and global block vector search for IBC mode. In SCC, 
a local area search is performed first and a global search is 
followed. Comparing RD cost from both search, choose the 
block vector with the minimum RD cost.  
 
A. Local block vector search for IBC mode 
In this step, there are two steps find the optimal block 
vectors (BVs). First, find the four best BVs according to their 
RD cost, where

within 2 CTU for the local search as depicted in Fig. 2 
where

 is the number of bits needed to signal the BV. In 
this step, only the SAD of the luma component is used. For 
the chosen four best BVs, additional RD cost is calculated as

The RD cost corresponding to

is denoted by 
_cos local

. 
B. Global block vector search for IBC mode 
Global block vector search is conducted for 8x8 and 
16x16 blocks. As shown in Fig. 3, the entire reconstructed 
current picture before loop filtering is the global search 
prediction area. For 16x16 blocks, a one-dimensional search 
is performed over the entire reconstructed current picture, as 
shown in Fig. 4. For the horizontal search, block matching is 
performed only in the horizontal direction that means vertical 
components of BVs are zero with the same height of the 
current block and the vertical search is performed in the 
same manner.  
For 8x8 PUs, a hash-based full picture search is used to 
search the optimal BV. The 16-bit hash entries for the 
current block and the reference block are calculated using the 
original sample values. Let Grad denote the gradient of the 
8x8 block and let dc0, dc1, dc2, and dc3 denote the DC 
values of the four 4x4 sub-blocks of the 8x8 block. Then, the 
16-bit hash entry H is calculated as:

where MSB(X,n) represents the n most significant bits of X.  
The procedure of hash-based IBC is as follows: First, the 
hash-value of the current PU is calculated. Search the blocks 
which have the same hash value with the current PU in the 
pre-calculated hash list. Then, the blocks that have the same 
hash value with that of the current block perform the RD cost 
and choose the eight best BVs according to (1). For the 
chosen eight best BVs, additional RD cost is calculated using 
(2) in order to find the 
global
BVopt
.

C. Fast block vector search for IBC mode 
If the residual of inter prediction is not zero, some fast 
search and early termination methods are employed, between 
evaluating the RD cost of inter mode and intra mode. It is 
applied only to 2Nx2N partition of various CU sizes. If the 
residue of fast IBC search is not zero, then regular intra 
mode will be performed as described in Sections A and B. 
The SAD-based RD costs of using a set of BV predictors 
are calculated in the fast search. As shown in Fig. 5, the set 
includes the five spatial neighboring BV as used in inter 
merge mode and the last two coded BVs. In addition, the 
derived BVs of the block pointed to by each of the 
aforementioned BV predictors are also included.  
 
III. 
PROPOSED ALGORITHM 
Hash-based IBC mode for the 8x8 PU has a critical role 
in SCC. Compared with SCC without hash-based IBC, up to 
75% Bjøntegaard Distortion bitrate (BD-BR) gain can be 
achieved. On the other hand, even though the main purpose 
of using hash-based search is to speed up the full picture 
search, it has a massive computation burden when there are a 
number of blocks in the hash list. For example, over 70 
thousand times RD cost calculations are performed on the 
average 
for 
8x8 
PU, 
when 
we 
encode 
“sc_wordEditing_1280x720_8bit_444” sequence under the 
intra_main_SCC condition. In order to alleviate this, we 
apply the concept of the successive elimination algorithm 
(SEA) [7] for the 8x8 PUs which are used for hash-based 
search.  
The derivation of the SEA starts from the following basic 
triangular inequalities,

This means that the difference of the sum norms of the

Note that all the procedure of the proposed algorithm is

the proposed algorithm is as follows: Calculate the

first and then check (6) with the sum norms and the value of 
RD_cos min
t
. If the condition does not hold, discard the 
search point and move on to next search point. Once the 
search point is skipped, that point cannot be included as a 
candidate set aforementioned in Section II. C. 
Note that the sum norm for each block has been already 
calculated when calculating the 16-bit hash entry H in (3). In 
other words, there is no additional computation to get the 
sum norms of the current block and reference blocks.

EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
In order to demonstrate the coding efficiency of the 
proposed algorithm, we simulated five sequences in the 
common test conditions (CTC) used during the development 
of HEVC-SCC [8] and a sequence from the HEVC CTC in 
Class F as listed in Table I under the intra_main_scc 
configuration condition. HM-16.8+SCM-6.1 was modified to 
include the proposed algorithm. 22, 27, 32, and 37 are set for 
QPs.

Table II shows the bit-rate savings SCC tools over HM-
16.8 for intra main configuration. Note that negative number 
indicates the BD-BR saving. BD-BR savings in the range of 
28.24% to 84.01% and 60.25% on the average can be 
observed.  
Aforementioned in Section III, hash-based global IBC 
search has an important role in SCC as shown in Table III. 
Except some sequences like “MissionControlClip3”, BDBR 
saving rate is quite high; about 40% BDBR saving can be 
observed. 
Table IV shows the performance comparison between 
HM-16.8+SCM-6.1 and the proposed algorithm. Even 
though we proposed a kind of an early termination methods 
over hash-based IBC, we can achieve the BDBR saving up to 
0.62% and 0.21% on the average. The interesting point is 
that the sequences which have the higher coding gain by 
using hash-based IBC also have the higher coding gain for 
the proposed algorithm. We can obtain the coding gain by 
eliminating the impossible search points that may be a bad 
influence on BV predictors from as a candidate set 
aforementioned in Section II. C. 
It is demonstrated that the impossible search point can be 
effectively removed by checking (6) as shown in Table V. 
The impossible candidates are removed up to 86.80% and 
about 50% on the average.  
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, enhanced hash-based intra block copy 
algorithm using successive elimination algorithm is proposed, 
after analyzing the conventional IBC technique in HEVC 
SCC Draft 6, especially hash-based IBC. The proposed 
algorithm suggests the efficient way to calculate the lower 
bound for RD cost when performing the hash-based IBC 
process and to eliminate the impossible candidates earlier. 
Experimental results show that about 50% on the average 
and up to 86.80% of the search points can be early 
terminated as well as 0.21% on the average BDBR saving 
can be achieved compared to HM-16.8+SCM-6.1.

INTRODUCTION 
With the development of image processing technology 
and 
laser 
scanning 
technology, 
3D 
reconstruction 
technology has become an important research content for a 
wide range of applications in the field of reverse 
engineering, pattern recognition, film and television, and 
obtained the rapid development. The complex model is 
constructed quickly and accurately through the 3D point 
data. The existing reconstruction algorithms are mainly 
divided into two main categories: volume reconstruction 
and surface reconstruction [1]. Volume reconstruction 
needs a long execution time to be processed. Surface 
reconstruction processing speed is relatively fast, and it is 
good for real-time processing. Surface reconstruction 
mainly includes three phases: contour line connection, 
contour 
extraction 
and 
triangulation. 
Contour 
line 
connection means connecting the adjacent cross section 
contour points. Contour extraction is a virtual cube formed 
by the eight neighbouring points, which represent the 
contour surface of a polygon. Triangulation is a 
construction of tetrahedral mesh. The higher the processing 
speed of surface reconstruction, the lower accuracy it has, 
because of the lack of some contour points. For this reason, 
we propose a 3D data reconstruction algorithm based on 
improving Voronoi diagram in which the 3D point data is 
filtered and de-noise.  
The details of our research are as follows. In Section II, 
we introduce the critical technologies related with our 
research, 
including 
3D 
visualization 
class 
library 
Visualization 
Toolkit 
(VTK), 
Voronoi 
diagram 
reconstruction 
method 
and 
semi-automated 
mesh 
simplification method. In Section III, our new method 
realization is presented, including realization of new 
construction method and Semi-automatic simplification 
method. There are two tests in Section IV, the first test is 
used to prove that our surface reconstruction method is 
feasible and efficient, the second test is to confirm that our 
method of semi-automatic mesh simplification has good 
interface and is accurate. In Section V, we present a 
conclusion about our research.  
II. 
CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES 
In this section, we introduce critical technologies related 
with our research, including 3D visualization class library 
VTK, reconstruction method and semi-automated mesh 
simplification method. 
A. 3D visualization class library VTK 
In 3D visualization class library VTK, there are three 
key parts: Voronoi tessellation code, Vanderpool (VT) and 
VTK. Voronoi tessellation code defines a cellular-like 
structure, where each particle is associated to a region in 
which any point in that region is nearer to that particle than 
to any other particle. The parallel Voronoi tessellation code 
is an open source code, and it has the following 
characteristics: (1) parallel and optimization, has full 
advantage of actual multicore and distributed memory, (2) 
user-friendly in documentation and interface, (3) has typical 
I/O formats used in the field of NN-body simulations. In 
addition, this code also has the properties such as Voronoi 
densities, cell volumes, density gradients, and immediate 
neighbour lists. In the field of astrophysics, particularly for 
NN-body simulations, Voronoi tessellation code is a very 
useful tool to identify immediate neighbours of particles,

and it is one of the best adaptive methods to recover a 
precise density field from a discrete distribution of points, 
with 
a 
clear 
advantage 
over 
smoothed 
particle 
hydrodynamic or other interpolation-based techniques. Its 
principal asset is complete independence of arbitrary 
smoothing functions and parameters specifying their 
properties.  
Vanderpool (VT) in 3D visualization reproduces the 
anisotropies of the local particle distribution and through its 
adaptive and local nature proves to be optimally suited for 
uncovering the full structural richness in the density 
distribution. Other remarkable uses of VT in this field are 
filamentary structure identification, NN-body simulation 
code 
AREPO, 
halo 
and 
void 
identification, 
and 
nonparametric determination of halo concentrations. 
In 3D visualization class library, VTK is a set of 3D 
graphics, image processing and visualization tools which is 
integrated with the C++ library developed by the United 
States Kitware company. It is a source development, 
visualization technology and image processing software 
system; it can be used in C++, TCL/TK, Java and Python 
language environments [2]. It combines computer graphics, 
image processing and visualization technology, and it has 
an absolute advantage in the field of visualization and 
image processing. It has become often used in the research 
of image visualization system. VTK system mainly has two 
kinds: the graphic model object and visualization object 
model. The main function of graphical model is 
representing the scene which is formed from geometry by 
graph. VTK has 3D interactive components where users can 
choose the functions of parallel processing, running 
algorithm and visualization process. Visualization process 
includes functions of read data, filtering, mapping and 
rendering. 
B.  The method of Voronoi diagram reconstruction 
The accuracy and efficiency are two key factors of 3D 
surface reconstruction by data. The accuracy is required to 
maintain the topology and shape. The efficiency is required 
to reduce the reconstruction time in the premise of 
maintaining the original topology under. Distance algorithm 
deals with noisy scattered data and it also reconstructs the 
surface of triangular mesh concerning for sample density 
and surface details based on a greedy filter. 
The original Voronoi diagram [3] has a great effect on 
the distance between the point and other geometric objects. 
Assuming that in a given plane or space, there are n 
scattered points, point set

Delaunay triangulation is dual related to Voronoi 
diagram, which has the characteristics of the maximum of 
the minimum angle, the cavity and the local reconnection 
[4]. Power map is an extension of Voronoi; its generating

If we hope to obtain better approximation of the surface 
vector of sampling point, we need to improve the surface 
reconstruction algorithm. The details of our improved 
method are described in Section III A.  
C. Semi-automated mesh simplification method 
For regular models, such as airplane, tank, etc., model 
conforms to a certain rule, automatic error correction can be 
easily achieved by feature preserving simplification [5]. 
However, for the cows, dinosaurs and other irregular model, 
or users who have special expectations to simplify models, 
we need select error correction mode and the expected 
characteristics of the region are preserved. 
The basic error measure is quadric error metrics, which 
focuses on the feature of size in shape variable before and 
after the simplification. In many cases, the curvature of the 
model is more important than the feature ones. For surfaces 
that are in the same plane, only a few polygons can be 
expressed, however highly curved surfaces require more 
polygons to represent [6]. For this reason, we study the 
curvature error and the two-error weight as the result of 
automatic error correction, and do research on the triangle 
optimization factor to the quality of triangle.  
The three vertices of the triangle V3, V2 and V1 are 
used to calculate the product of vectors, which are the 
normal vectors of triangle:

In order to improve the result of the simplification, 
users can mark in 3D model to refine and retain in the 
simplified platform directly, and simplify to achieve new 
simplified results. The user impact factor of the marked 
area is embodied in the way of weight. In our new error 
method, we set weight value of W both by system 
initialization and by calculation of each point. The 
initialization value of W is 1. If the user did not make any 
other decision, the way of automatic error correction will be 
followed. If the user tag, the tag area will be given a new 
weight, and the value of W > 1, the twice error will be 
modified by following formula:

The error is multiplied twice by a weight. To calculate

REALIZATION OF OUR NEW METHODS 
There are two improved methods in this section; one 
improved method is to improve Power Crust Algorithm, 
other 
improved 
method 
is 
semi-automatic 
mesh 
simplification method.  
A. The concrete realization of Power Crust  
Power Crust algorithm has the advantages of a simple 
process to accurately reconstruct the results, for a large 
number of scattered point cloud data without a normal 
vector [13]-[14].  The processing speed is very fast, but the 
disadvantage of this method is that it is not accurate [15]. 
Power Crust algorithm can generate a watertight and sealed 
3D mesh; in addition, it can construct the estimators from 
the central axis of the original surface which contains noise, 
sharp and unclosed points cloud data. The steps of Power 
Crust algorithm are: 
 
Calculate centre axis of the sample, find out 
v vertices to create graph on Voronoi 
triangulation , 
 
Connect through triangulation points of the 
original point cloud into triangular mesh 
model,  
 
Delete the grid which does not comply with 
requirements.  
 
 Construction of the grid mesh 
The advantage of Power Crust algorithm is that it can 
construct the region with dense points. Its disadvantage is 
that the output of discrete surface has sparse points. We 
modify Power Crust algorithm based on Voronoi diagram:  
1) Set Delaunay triangulation by sampling point S; and 
find the Voronoi vertex which the boundary box of vertex is 
considered to be the sampling point in Power diagram. 
2) Determine which Voronoi vertices are poles. 
3) The generation of the pole penalty set Bp, calculated 
the Power chart. 
4) Mark each pole inside or outside. 
5) Set the triangle as the output, and return the results. 
We would prove that our modified algorithm has better 
result by experiments in Section IV. 
B.  Modified Semi- automatic mesh simplification method 
There are two methods to set weight value in mesh 
simplification method; in the first method, users input a 
weight value, the second method consists on setting an 
initial weight value by the system, because it may be 
difficult for some users and cases to actually set suitable 
weights.  For different grid model, weights will have great 
differences. 
The two methods of set weight value are: 1) User 
input weight value to system. This method can meet user 
different 
requirements. 
The 
weight 
values 
include 
maximum and minimum values. 2) Initial label the mean

value of the error in the actual simplification process for 
different mesh models. If the pre-set weight range is large, 
it is likely that role to the quadric error led to final folding.  
We modify semi-automatic mesh simplification 
method by calculating the weight value two times so that 
the error would not make model losing retention effect. 
Model when it is in the medium errors are in reasonable 
way because that model retention effect is better than at 
other errors .The twice error and the weight of the transfer 
process are done separately. The definition of weight 
transfer is as follows: 
1) The process of Edge collapse: Point 
1v  and 
2v  fold 
to 
'v .The weight value of
1v is
1
w , weight value of 
2v is
2
w . 
Weight value of
'v is average value of  
1
w  and 
2
w . 
2) The process of Split point process: The parent node 
V is split into two nodes, if v weight is w, then two sub-
node weights are w. 
The semi-automatic mesh simplification code is 
described as follows: 
1) E(u,v):=v.quadric/v.opt+F(u,v); 
2) W(u,v):=(u.weight+v.weight)/2; 
3) Cost(u,v):=W(u)*E(u)+W(v)*E(v); 
4) Mesh.list.sort(mesh.v,cost(u,v)); 
5) Mesh.list.popfront(); 
6) Mesh.update(); 
7) If is Ok (mesh) then 
8) return mesh; 
9) else goto step5; 
10) end if 
    The algorithm needs to deal with a large amount of data, 
so the definition of a suitable data structure ensures 
simplification and the capability of handling large data 
models quickly. The modified semi-automatic mesh 
simplification is as follows: 
1) Set sequence of vertices, which record each vertex 
and adjacency edge, adjacent triangles, error values and 
weights. 
2) Record vertex triangle index sequence. 
3) Identify the sequence of vertices and triangles 
sequence model data structure. 
4) Store the folded edge in the record list. 
    The modified algorithm will be tested and analysed by 
experiments in section IV. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS 
There are two tests in this section; one test is a 
reconstruction test aiming at proving our improved 
algorithm of reconstruction described in section III A; the 
second test is to verify our improved algorithm of semi-
automatic mesh simplification method being described in 
section III B.  The data used in experiment came from the 
3D scanned images stored in the Txt text [16] in the form of 
3D coordinates. 
A.  Reconstruction test and analysis  
The 
program 
of 
surface 
reconstruction 
and 
visualization in 3D point cloud are designed based on 
Visual C++ Microsoft platform. We choose two sets of 
three dimensional point cloud data, such as data of whale 
and ocean to do the tests. They are shown in Figure 1 and 
Figure 2. 
 
Figure 1.  The reconstruction of whale 
 
Figure 2.  The reconstruction of ocean 
We achieve two reconstruction effects both by using 
Crust Power algorithm through the 3D point cloud data and 
by using our algorithm through the 3D point cloud data to 
carry out a comparative analysis. Table 1 summarizes the 
results of the reconstruction of the two algorithms.

Through the above tests, we can find that the time 
efficiency of power crust algorithm is lower than our 
method. Our reconstruction method based on Voronoi 
diagram can achieve the stereo effect of 3D point cloud 
well and can retain some details of the original object. 
Therefore, our reconstruction method based on Voronoi 
diagram is an effective method in surface reconstruction. 
B.  Experiment and analysis of semi-automatic mesh 
simplification method 
Our semi-automatic mesh simplification method was 
implemented by the standard C++ language. There are 
several parts in this program, such as error correction, edit 
mode, different simplified models and default settings.  
User error correction for weight allows the users to do 
marking operation. In edit mode, the user can alter attention 
region (the region should be distinguished by different 
colors) which facilitate the user operation through CTRL + 
mouse to select smear colour; SHIFT + mouse to delete the 
selected colour. For different simplified models, the range

of calculation errors and the ranking results are different. 
The weight of the error is proposed to properly affect the 
calculation of the results of the calculation error, and 
therefore, the appropriate value of the initial weight is the 
key influence on error calculation. According to the 
different weights of the experimental model, the optimal 
setting is to obtain the minimum and maximum error, and 
then take the average value between the two values as the 
initial value for the corresponding model. The default 
settings for the user's marking area are the initial value and 
the value of the tag. Specific weights are set shown in Table 
II.

The results of our method to achieve the 3D model of 
simplification are shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5. 
According to the initial weight of the set rules, the weights 
are the average between the initial weight and the maximum 
error.

We use the function of user error correction to get the 
best simplification result. Labelled and unlabelled mesh 
simplification results are shown in Table III.

THE NUMBER OF MESH MODEL SIMPLIFICATION RESULTS. 
From the experiment results, we conclude that our 
semi- automatic mesh simplification algorithm can obtain 
the simplified model conforms to the simplified criteria. It 
can also fully retain the local area which users concern 
about maintaining the appearance. It can be seen that our 
modified algorithm is important in generating a simplified 
model and it is consistent with user's requirements. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we firstly analyse the existing surface 
reconstruction of Voronoi and Delaunay triangulation 
Power Crust algorithms and study the implementation 
toolkit of VTK. Secondly, we modified Power Crust 
algorithm based on Voronoi diagram to reconstruct the 
surface by using the cloud data into VTK which has a 
strong image processing capabilities. Our modified method 
can effectively improve the efficiency of reconstruction and 
has a good visualization performance. Thirdly, based on the 
two error metric algorithm, we proposed a new method of 
semi-automatic 
mesh 
simplification. 
Our 
algorithm 
provides automatic error correction and user error 
correction which has twice error correction functions 
according to different models with different types of error 
correction. By comparing with different models obtained by 
different 
experiments, 
our 
semi-automatic 
mesh 
simplification method has the characteristics of good 
retention effect and can simplify the complex structure of 
the model.
