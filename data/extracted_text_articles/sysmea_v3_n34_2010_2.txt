Abstract—In this work, we compute the Wigner distribution
from wavefunctions that are generated by solving the Schr¨odinger
equation. Our goal is to propose an avenue of research that
may help better understand certain limitations of deterministic
Wigner transport equation solvers, such as negative electron
densities or limited charge drops in presence of potential barriers.
We evaluate the numerical accuracy required by the Schr¨odinger
solver to compute the Wigner function and compare the perfor-
mance of an analytic and a numerical solver applied to a constant
potential proﬁle, as well as to single- and double-barrier one-
dimensional structures. Then, we investigate how the Wigner
function boundary conditions vary in these same structures as
the contact length increases. We also investigate the range of
the wave vector grid required to accurately compute the charge
from the Wigner function. Finally, we carry out the same study
on biased structures.

I. INTRODUCTION
T
He constant drive toward increasing integration densities
is pushing the size of electronic devices down, ever closer
to the nanometer scale. As an example of this trend, the oxide
barrier in ULSI MOS transistors was expected to shrink to
a thickness below one nanometer by the 45 nm technology
node, prior to the introduction of high-permittivity dielectrics.
Another example is the channel length of this same type of
transistors, which is expected to drop below 10 nm within
the next few technology process generations, according to the
current ITRS roadmap [2].
As the size of electronic devices approaches the nanometer
scale, quantum phenomena begin to affect the charge carriers’
distributions and currents, and TCAD simulators must be
capable of accounting for these phenomena in order to model
device operation accurately. Instead, current commercial sim-
ulation software mostly implements classical models such as
the drift-diffusion, thermo- and hydrodynamic ones [3]. These
models are derived from the phase-state Boltzmann Transport
Equation (BTE) and do not take into account the wave nature
of charge carriers. Quantum effects are in general treated
only tangentially, to simulate parasitic phenomena such as
tunneling currents and conﬁnement levels. In order to be
capable of accurately simulating next-generation electronic
devices, TCAD software needs to implement full-quantum
models. This would enable engineers not only to better predict
and characterize parasitic effects in current devices, but also to
explore innovative quantum-based designs, such as Resonant
Tunneling Diodes (RTD) and quantum dots.
The Schr¨odinger Equation (SE) is the starting point for a
number of approaches that model quantum phenomena. In its
one-dimensional (1D) transient form, this equation represents
carriers as wavefunctions ψ(x, k, t) of energy E(k), which
propagate through a lattice potential energy U(x). x indicates
the real space and k the wave vector space. The carriers are
given an effective mass m∗ = mrm0, where mr is the relative
mass and m0 the electron mass in vacuum. The SE is thus
given by:
i¯h ∂
∂tψ + ¯h2
2m∗
∂2
∂x2 ψ = Uψ
(1)
¯h is the reduced Planck constant. Although the SE can
be solved analytically or numerically through a number of
different schemes, it remains ill-suited to simulate carrier
transport. A major shortcoming is that it is difﬁcult to match
the electron wavefunction to measurable physical quantities at
the boundaries of a system. It is also problematic to account
for parasitic phenomena such as carrier-carrier interactions.
One way to address these shortcomings is to use the Wigner
Function (WF) instead of the SE to compute charge densities
and currents. The WF is a quasi phase-space distribution
function that is obtained by solving the Wigner Transport
Equation (WTE), which is itself derived from the SE. The
WTE was ﬁrst studied by Wigner [4], and was implemented
numerically much later by Kluksdahl, to simulate quantum
tunneling [5], [6], and by Frensley, to study a 1D RTD device
[7], [8]. Frensley’s implementation uses a ﬁrst-order differenti-
ation scheme and assumes a constant effective mass across the
structure. Higher-order schemes were later studied by Jensen
and Buot [9]–[14], while Tsuchiya [15] and Gullapalli [16],
[17] applied a varying effective mass. Implementations on
RTD devices are also studied by Miller [18] and Wu [19].
Biegel compares various differentiation and self-consistency
schemes and applies them to the simulations of RTD devices
[20]. Grubin looks at the resolution of the transient WTE
[21], while Nedjalkov analyzes the issue of interactions [22].
Yamada studies a 3D mixed self-consistent scheme applied
to a silicon nanowire transistor, by solving the SE across
the device’s cross-section and the WTE along the transport

direction, using a differentiation scheme up to the third order
[23]. Finally, Keﬁ-Ferhane simulates a thin 2D MOS transistor
by applying a WTE solver along the channel and a Schr¨odinger
solver perpendicularly [24].
In this paper, we discuss a number of issues that we encoun-
tered when implementing the 1D deterministic numerical WTE
solver described by Frensely. In order to better understand
these issues, we study a method to compute the WF directly
from the SE, rather than by solving the WTE. We hope that
this approach may give us better insight into the nature of
the WF and help us in the future in addressing the problems
encountered. In this paper, we present some signiﬁcant initial
results, as we look at the WF boundary conditions in unbiased
and biased structures and estimate the minimum contact length
that has to be applied to a device in a simulation. In addition,
we investigate the minimum range that has to be used for
the wave vector mesh in order to accurately compute carrier
densities from the WF.
II. DERIVATION OF THE WIGNER EQUATION
The WTE is derived from the SE by calculating the Density
Matrix Function (DMF) and then carrying out a variable
change and a Fourier Transform (FT). In the formulae that
follow, the transient nature of the wavefunction is implied.
The DMF ρ(r, s) is derived by correlating the wavefunction
on (r, s) couples of points in real space. In the case of a
1D structure with entry and exit contacts (the “Emitter” and
“Collector” respectively), this gives [8]:
ρ(r, s) =

ψ(r)ψ(s)fFD(E(k)) dk
(2)
h is the Planck constant, kB the Boltzmann constant, and
T the absolute temperature, which is set to 300 K in all
the simulations presented in this work. The ﬁrst term of the
formula represents wavefunctions incident at the emitter, i.e.,
with a positive wave vector k, while the second represents
wavefunctions incident at the collector, i.e., with a negative
wave vector. The wavefunctions are weighed by the carrier
energy spectrum density, which is given by a Fermi-Dirac Dis-
tribution (FDD) fFD(k) integrated over transverse momenta:
fFD(k) = ln

EF is the Fermi energy level at the contact. Assuming a
parabolic band, the carrier energy E is given by:
E(k) =

By applying the SE to the DMF and then carrying out the
following variable change:
r = x + y/2

s = x − y/2
u(x, y) = ρ(x + y/2, x − y/2)

In this formula, fW (x, k, t) designates the WF. The formula
includes a scattering term that accounts for carrier interactions.
Note that the FT transforms the space variable y into the wave

III. WTE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
At present, commercial simulation software typically deals
with quantum parasitic phenomena by applying ad-hoc models
to the areas of a device that are most affected. As the device
size decreases and these areas become relatively larger, full-
quantum simulators might eventually come to replace current
classical models. Even after repeated shrinks, however, some
regions in a device might still behave classically (e.g., the
contacts), and quantum models should therefore be capable
of smoothly handling the transition between quantum and
classical transport.
In the speciﬁc case of WTE solvers, when simulating
sufﬁciently large devices with negligible quantum effects, the
values of the charge and the current should be consistent with
those obtained by solving the BTE. On smaller devices, as
quantum effects begin to appear, the simulated characteristics
should be consistent with those yielded by other, comparable
quantum models.
Fig. 1 tests these consistency constraints by showing an
edge-case classical structure that is sufﬁciently small to let
quantum effects begin to appear. The simulated structure is an
abrupt silicon N+P+N+ double junction. Each region is 15 nm
long; the device is not biased. The ﬁgure displays the electron

density plots obtained by solving the WTE, the BTE and the
Schr¨odinger equations self-consistently with the same mesh
numerical parameters. The details concerning the Schr¨odinger
solver implementation are discussed in Section IV. For the
time being, note that this solver should be considered as the
one providing the most accurate results when quantum effects
are taken into account.
The preponderant classical nature of the simulated device
can be seen from the large drop in the electron density
(over 20 decades) given by both the BTE and Schr¨odinger
solvers. Quantum effects result in a less abrupt slope in the
middle-region valley in the Schr¨odinger plot compared to the
BTE one. This can be explained by taking into account the
penetration of the electron wave packet into the P+ barrier. The
slope in the WTE plot is consistent with the Schr¨odinger one,
which indicates that quantum effects are correctly accounted
for. However, the WTE plot shows a glaring artifact, as the
electron density in the middle of the valley takes negative
values, which has no physical sense. Moreover, the minimum
electron density in the WTE plot is 10 decades higher than
that in the Schr¨odinger one.
The shape of the WTE plot seems to suggest that the WTE
solver cannot handle a drop in the charge by more than a few
decades. This is consistent with the literature on the WTE,
which mostly presents simulations displaying limited drops in
charge and current. For example, the peak/valley current ratio
simulated in RTD devices is generally lower than one decade
[20], while the nanowire transistor simulated by Yamada has
an IOn/IOff ratio of about 100 [23]. If the WTE solver is indeed
accurate only for small variations of the simulated electric
macroscopic quantities, it could be problematic to use it to
simulate devices with a mixed quantum and classical character.
Investigating these issues with WTE solvers is somewhat
problematic, due to memory constraints. Indeed, as the WTE
contains an integral term, it is implemented numerically as a
block matrix [20], where the number of non-zero coefﬁcients
increases with the square of the mesh density in the wave vec-
tor space. The rapidly-growing memory footprint thus limits
the resolution at which the WF can be calculated, as well as the
ability to investigate its properties. By computing the WF from
the SE, rather than from the WTE, we are able to reduce this
footprint; this enables us to deﬁne much denser meshes than
those used in a WTE solver, and thus to thoroughly investigate
the issue of boundary conditions in single- and double-barrier,
classical and quantum 1D structures.
IV. COMPUTATION OF THE WF WITH A SCHR ¨ODINGER
SOLVER IN UNBIASED STRUCTURES
In order to test whether the WTE solver can accurately com-
pute high charge and current drops, one could try to increase
the x- and k-grid resolutions (Nx and Nk respectively). How-
ever, memory constraints rapidly limit this technique, as the
size of the drift term matrix increases proportionally to NxN 2
k
[20]. In fact, it would be more efﬁcient to apply the solver to
only a small region of interest where quantum phenomena
take place, e.g., between the two ends of a potential barrier.
The memory overhead of meshing the contact regions could
thus be avoided. However, this technique poses the problem of
what boundary conditions to apply to the solver as, according
to Frensley, a FDD can be used only if the boundaries are
distant from the quantum region [8]. Moreover, to the best of
our knowledge, no study has yet been conducted to evaluate
the minimum contact length at which equilibrium conditions
can be applied.
In order to investigate the matter of the minimum contact
length, we implement a solver that computes the WF directly
from the SE. Its ultimate purpose in future studies will be to
apply its solution to the WTE as a boundary condition. This
section focuses on developing an accurate implementation of
this solver, and on assessing its limitations. The Schr¨odinger
solver algorithm is implemented as follows: ﬁrst, a number
of wavefunctions are cast into a given potential proﬁle; then
(2) is applied to compute the DMF, and ﬁnally (9) is used
to calculate the WF. The solver thus works on three different
1D grids to account for the x, y and k variables. Nx, Ny
and Nk denote the respective grid resolutions. The details
of the numerical implementation, including grid spacing, are
discussed further at the end of this section.
The solver has been applied to three potential proﬁles at
zero bias: (a) a constant potential over a length of 50 nm; (b)
one with two contacts separated by a 7 nm-thick rectangular
barrier and (c) one with two contact regions and two 1 nm-long
barriers separated by a 3 nm well. The optimal length of the
contact regions is discussed in Section VI. In all three cases,
the Fermi level is set equal to the conduction band energy at
both contacts. For the constant potential proﬁle, a relative mass
of 0.5 is taken. For the other two, two different combinations
are tested: (a) a relative mass of 0.5 and a barrier height of
1.5 eV, which are representative of a generic silicon/nitride
structure, and (b) a relative mass of 0.067 and a barrier height
of 0.3 eV, which are representative of a generic III-V structure.
The solver used in this work is not self-consistent, as the
purpose of this study is simply to compute the WF from
a given potential proﬁle. However, self-consistency can be
implemented, as for the plot in Fig. 1.
Fig. 2 illustrates how wavefunctions are computed. Starting
at the emitter contact, plane wavefunctions ψEmitter(x, k) of the
form:

from the emitter and collector contacts, within an 1 eV-wide range from the conduction band upwards. The x, xB, xW and xC axes, as deﬁned in (11) and
(13)-(15), are displayed and their origins are marked.
ψEmitter(x, k) = eikx + bEmitter(k)e−ikx
(11)
are cast into the device, where k is the positive wave vector
and the carrier energy E is given by (4). These wavefunctions
are used to compute the ﬁrst integral term in (2). Each
wavefunction contains a normalized incident component with a
positive wave vector and a reﬂected component with a negative
wave vector and a complex reﬂection coefﬁcient bEmitter(k).
For each incident wave vector, the wavefunction is computed
at each node on the x-grid through either an analytic or a
numerical scheme.
The analytic scheme applies the transfer-matrix method.
In short, this method is composed of four steps: ﬁrst, the
structure is divided into separate regions, namely the contacts,
the barriers and the well. Then, the wavefunction is calculated
symbolically in each region by solving the SE. As the SE
is a second-degree differential equation relative to space, its
solution in region i is the linear combination of two functions
fi(x, k) and gi(x, k), and has the form:
ψ(x, k) = ai(k)fi(x, k) + bi(k)gi(x, k)
(12)
ai(k) and bi(k) are the wavefunction coefﬁcients in the
region. In the third step, these coefﬁcients are evaluated by
setting up a system of two equations at each interface between
adjacent regions; these equations express the continuity of the
wavefunction and of its ﬁrst derivative at the interface. When
all interfaces are accounted for, solving the overall system
yields the wavefunction coefﬁcients in each region. Finally,
the wavefunction can be evaluated at all points.
The potential proﬁle in each region needs to be regular
enough so that there exists a symbolic solution for the SE.
This is possible for instance if the potential is constant, as
discussed further in this section, or if it varies linearly, as seen
in Section VII; in the latter case, the solutions are given by
Airy functions, which can be evaluated to a high precision with
appropriate numerical libraries. With a ﬂat or linear potential
proﬁle, the wavefunction can be calculated symbolically at all
points in the structure, and to evaluate it numerically as a last
step.
In the barriers, for a constant potential U(x) = UB the
solutions of the SE take the form:
ψEmitter(xB, k) =





aBarrier(k)eikBxB + bBarrier(k)e−ikBxB
E(k) > UB
aBarrier(k)xB + bBarrier(k)
E(k) = UB
aBarrier(k)ekBxB + bBarrier(k)e−kBxB
E(k) < UB
(13)
In this formula, kB =
p
(2m∗|E(k) − UB|)/¯h and xB is
the x coordinate with the origin set at the left foot of the
barrier. In the case of a double barrier, the solution in the well
is:
ψWell(xW , k) = aWell(k)eikxW + bWell(k)e−ikxW
(14)
The origin of xW is set at the left end of the well. Finally,
the solution at the collector contact is of the type:
ψCollector(xC, k) = aCollector(k)eikxC
(15)
This wavefunction has no negative wave vector, as no wave
is incident at the collector. The origin of xC is set at the start
of the collector region.
The numerical scheme solves the SE by applying the
Numerov method [26]. Once again, the process can be divided
into four steps. The computation starts at the collector, where
the wavefunction has only one component. This component is
temporarily normalized, i.e., aCollector is set equal to 1. This
makes it possible to use (15) to evaluate the wavefunction at
the ﬁrst two nodes in the collector region:
ψCollector Normalized(xC = 0) = 1
ψCollector Normalized(xC = ∆x) = eik∆x
(16)
Then, from these two data points, the Numerov method
is applied to compute the wavefunction backwards into the
structure. When the emitter contact is reached, the following
step consists in evaluating the wavefunction coefﬁcients aEmitter
and bEmitter in this region. At the emitter boundary, the function
and its ﬁrst derivative are given by (11) and have the form:
ψEmitter(x = 0) = aEmitter + bEmitter
∂ψEmitter
∂x
(x = 0) = ikaEmitter − ikbEmitter
(17)

Note that aEmitter is not equal to 1 because the wavefunctions
are normalized at the collector instead of the emitter, for
the time being. The numerical value of the ﬁrst derivative
is computed by applying a differentiation scheme [26] cen-
tered on the emitter boundary node. Having computed both
the wavefunction and its derivative, the system (17) can be
solved for the two coefﬁcients. Finally, all wavefunction values
calculated across the structure are divided by aEmitter, so that
they are correctly normalized.
According to Pang [26], the Numerov method can be
considered to be of order O(N 4
x). However, its present ap-
plication limits convergence to the order O(N 2
x), because of
the evaluation of the wavefunction derivative at the emitter
contact. Once the wavefunction packet incident at the emitter
has been evaluated, normalized wavefunctions are similarly
cast into the structure from the collector, in order to compute
the second integral term in (2).
The numerical implementation of (1), (2) and (9) requires a
certain care in order to avoid aliasing of the discrete FT. To be
consistent with Frensley’s scheme, the condition ∆y = 2∆x
is imposed, where ∆x and ∆y are the x- and y-grid spacings
respectively. In this way, the x-grid vertices can be reused
for the y-grid. In addition, in (9), the k-grid is implemented
symmetrically to k = 0, such that [8]:
ki = {−kMax + (i + 1/2)∆k}i=0..(N−1)
(18)
where ∆k is the k-grid spacing. The y-grid is deﬁned as:
yi = {−yMax + i∆y}i=0..(N−1)
(19)
kMax and yMax are the half-ranges of the two grids, which
have the same number of nodes N = Ny = Nk. kMax and
yMax are related by:
yMax = π/∆k = πN/(2kMax)
(20)
Note that this last condition cannot be fully satisﬁed,
because yMax is rounded to the nearest node on the x-grid.
The error on yMax is, however, equal to ∆x/2 at most, i.e., less
than 1% for N > 50. Also note that, in order to fully mesh
the y-grid, the x-grid must be extended by yMax/2 beyond
the emitter and collector contacts. The k-grid deﬁned in (18)
should be reused in (2) in order to calculate the wave vectors
that are cast into the SE. However, we observed that this is
not necessary: in [1], we determine that 500 vectors spaced
linearly over a 8 eV wide range from the conduction band
upwards are sufﬁcient to compute the DMF and WF without
signiﬁcant aliasing. In a subsequent study, we determine that
even lower values (250 vectors over a 1 eV range) can be used
[27], [28].

begin to separate from the central FDD peak about 4 decades
below the WF maximum. The charges given by the analytic
and numerical solvers are thus consistent within 1%.
Fig. 4 provides some insight into the nature of the nu-
merical error, by highlighting the computation of the DMF
ρ(y/2, −y/2) at x = 0. The different plots show how the value
of the partially-computed ρ integral varies as the upper bound
k′ increases up to its maximum value kMax. The plots obtained
from the numerical and analytic solvers are compared. For
y > 10 nm, the value of the integral peaks at k′ = 0 and then
drops as k′ increases. For y = 50 nm, the drop for the analytic
solver spans about 15 decades. By looking at this speciﬁc plot,
one realizes that the integral is subject to a variation of 15
orders of magnitude as it is computed. This means that, in
order for the DMF to be calculated accurately, the integrand,
i.e., the wavefunctions, must be evaluated to a relative accuracy
of the same order.
The analytic solver is shown to be capable of this level of
accuracy, as the three plots obtained for y > 10 nm drop to
clearly distinct values. On the contrary, the numerical solver
is not, because the same three plots are indistinguishable once
they drop by only two decades below their peak. In the case
of y = 50 nm, the accuracy of the numerical solver should
be improved by more than 10 orders of magnitude to match
the analytic one. Because of the insufﬁcient accuracy of the
numerical solver, all simulations presented in the following
sections are based on the analytic one.
VI. STUDY OF THE MINIMUM CONTACT LENGTH AND OF
THE WAVE VECTOR GRID RANGE IN UNBIASED
STRUCTURES
The ﬁrst part of this section presents a study of the length
of the emitter and collector contact regions. Its purpose is to
determine the minimum contact length where the WF at the
boundaries is equal to the equilibrium FDD within machine
precision. The second part discusses the range of the wave
vector grid that has to be applied to the WF in order to
accurately evaluate the charge densities at all points in a given
structure.
Fig. 5 shows the DMF and the WF computed at the
emitter contact of a silicon-based single-barrier structure with
varying contact lengths. The plots show that a minimum length
between 20 and 30 nm should be used. Fig. 6 shows similar
plots on a III-V based structure. In this case, the WF at the
boundary converges to a FDD proﬁle for a contact length of

about 60 nm. As we explain in [27], this is due to the smaller
relative mass in the III-V materials.
As for double barriers, Fig. 7 shows the DMF and WF
computed at the emitter boundary of a silicon device. While
in a single-barrier structure the plot drops to the level of
numerical noise within less than 100 nm from the origin of
the y-axis, in the case of a double-barrier it keeps oscillating
with an amplitude that remains about constant over several
hundred nanometers. The WF plot is also quite different from
its single-barrier equivalent, as oscillating lobe-like artifacts
separate from the central FDD peak about 4 decades below its
maximum. This behavior is unaffected by the contact length.
In [1], we hypothesized that this behavior was caused by an
inaccurate computation of the wavefunctions. However, further
analysis in [27] shows that the oscillations in the DMF are
due to the very sharp peaks in the transmission spectrum that
occur when the well resonates. While the amplitude of the
oscillations is expected to drop eventually as y increases, it
does so very slowly: indeed, the y-grid range would have to be
extended by orders of magnitude in order for the oscillations
to fall below the level of numerical noise, which is not feasible
due to computational resource constraints.
Aside from the contact length, there is another parameter
that has a signiﬁcant effect on the accuracy of a simulation,
namely, the range of the wave vector grid that is applied to
the WTE solver. Indeed, because the charge is computed by
integrating the WF over the wave vector space, a too-narrow
range can cause it to be underestimated. Here, we evaluate the
minimum ranges that have to be used in order to compute the
charge within error margins of 1, 5 and 10%. The reference
charge used in the error computation is evaluated by applying
the very large range kMax = 20 nm−1. Fig. 8 shows how the
wave vector range varies across a silicon-based structure for
each error threshold. Note that, even if the double-barrier WF
is affected by lobes as shown in Fig. 7, these cause an error in
the integrated charge by less than 1% and are thus not expected
to signiﬁcantly affect the minimum range plots, at least for the
5 and 10% error thresholds.
For a single barrier, the minimum range plots show distinct
spikes at the barrier end points. In fact, Fig. 9 shows that
the WF at the foot of the barrier has a much gentler slope
than in the contact region, thus requiring a wider wave vector
range to accurately evaluate the charge. Also note that the WF
in the middle of the barrier is much more oscillatory, which
means that a ﬁner mesh has to be applied. A similar behavior
is observed in the double-barrier structure, as the plots reach
their maximum values at the two ends of each barrier.
Finally, Fig. 10 shows a similar behavior in a III-V based

standard double precision, then the maximum relative error between their
absolute values is evaluated.
VII. COMPUTATION OF THE WF WITH A SCHR ¨ODINGER
SOLVER IN BIASED STRUCTURES
In this section, we look at the WF at the emitter and
collector boundaries of structures where a bias is applied. Our
goal is to observe whether lobes appear, and to make a rough
estimate of their height. Three conﬁgurations are studied: the
devices either have no barrier, or one, or two, as shown in
Fig. 11. Each structure is composed of 30 nm long contacts
that enclose a middle region which has a thickness of 7 nm
in the no-barrier and single-barrier conﬁgurations and of 5 nm
in the double-barrier one. In the single-barrier device, the
middle region contains the barrier; in the double-barrier one,
it contains both the barriers, which are 1 nm thick, and the
well, which is 3 nm thick. The applied material parameters
are representative of a silicon-based structure.
The potential proﬁle is constant at the contacts and falls
linearly in the middle region. This simpliﬁcation makes it
possible to solve the SE symbolically using Airy functions.

The symbolic wavefunctions formulae are very complex and
are not optimized to reduce the numerical error. When eval-
uating them, it is therefore usually necessary to use a higher
computing precision than the IEEE 754 standard machine
double one. The MPMATH arbitrary-precision Python library
is used [29]. Fig. 12 displays the level of numerical precision
needed to calculate wavefunctions in single-barrier structures.
It plots the numerical error in the wavefunction module at
different working precisions, relative to a reference of 200
signiﬁcant digits. The wavefunctions are computed across the
structures at different bias points, by casting 250 incident
wave vectors within a 1 eV energy range. The modules of
the wavefunctions are then computed, and they are ﬁnally
converted to double machine precision. The plots in the ﬁgure
trace the maximum relative difference compared to the 200-
digit reference. The plots all end as the relative difference
reaches a value of about 10−15: this is due to the conversion
to double precision, which does not allow to measure relative
errors smaller than about 15 decades. The end point of each
plot indicates the minimum working precision that is needed
to compute the wavefunctions to double data type accuracy.
It can be seen that the required minimum precision is much
greater than for unbiased structures, where standard double
precision sufﬁces. For double-barrier structures, the numerical
precision required in the computation is similar to that for
a single barriers; on the contrary, for no-barrier structures,
double precision is once again sufﬁcient. It should be stressed
that optimizing the symbolic wavefunction formulae to reduce
numerical error propagation might be beneﬁcial in lowering
the minimum required working precision; nevertheless, stan-
dard machine precision may still not be enough.
Fig. 13 shows the WF computed at the emitter and collector
boundaries on a biased silicon single-barrier structure. The
plots are virtually indistinguishable from those obtained on a
device with no barrier. The emitter WF looks very similar to
the symmetric FDD proﬁle obtained on an unbiased device. In
fact, the left side (k < 0) of the curve bulges a little less than
the right one; this effect is however difﬁcult to spot visually
and can only be seen by looking at the numerical values of
the WF. An asymmetric WF curve is expected, as it indicates
a current ﬂow between the emitter and the collector. In this
structure, however, the high and thick barrier insulates well
the two contacts. This occurs even at high bias points, as the
different curves overlap almost perfectly. On the other hand,
on a no-barrier structure, wavefunctions that are incident at
the emitter can propagate freely towards the collector, once
again independently of the bias point. On the collector side,
the asymmetry is more evident, yet it still occurs many orders

Fig. 14 plots the WF at the emitter and collector boundaries
of a double-barrier structure. On the emitter side, one notices
that the asymmetry between the left and right lobes is more
evident, especially at the 1.5 V bias point. On the collector
side, the asymmetry of the WF plot is again very evident, and
lobes again appear about 5 decades below the peak. The plots
in III-V-based devices are similar.

region; the left peak (high-bias contact) is however higher in
general than the right one (low-bias contact). The difference
in height is especially marked in the case of the double-barrier
structure, although it is no greater than 30%. In both single-
and double-barrier structures, the difference in the heights of
the peaks with and without an applied bias is also quite small.
The biggest difference compared to the no-bias plots occurs
next to the middle point of the structure, where a very high
peak appears. This peak varies considerably with the applied
bias and is especially high on the double-barrier structure,
where it goes up to 60 nm−1 at a bias of 1 V. In fact, in the case
of the double-barrier device, two distinct peaks appear near
the middle of the structure, with the right one being higher.
Fig. 16 shows the WF at the point where the peak is highest:
while the plot is markedly asymmetric, it oscillates about the
origin, with the negative and positive areas being very similar
in size and canceling each other out when the charge integral
is evaluated. Similar trends are observed when applying III-V
material parameters.
As the WF is computed from the wavefunctions, scattering
effects are not accounted for. Normally, interactions have the
effect dissipating the charge carriers’ energy, thus screening
the electric ﬁeld [30]. It is thus possible that the high-energy
peaks observed in Fig. 15 may be considerably lower if
interactions are simulated, as the distribution proﬁles would
be pushed back toward the origin of the wave vector space.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this work, we have studied the Wigner Function (WF)
by computing it directly from the Schr¨odinger Equation (SE),
rather than by solving the Wigner Transport Equation (WTE).
We have shown that, in order to accurately compute the WF
over a large wave vector range, an extremely high machine
precision is required, often higher than the IEEE 754 double
data type. In fact, the numerical solver which we implemented,
despite being able to computing charge densities well within
1% accuracy, generated lobes on the WF curves that could not
be eliminated by applying denser grids.
This difﬁculty in computing the WF accurately comes from
the density matrix integration step, followed by the application
of the Fourier transform. Because these two operations are

an inherent part of the WTE, the problems encountered in
their implementation might explain those met in solving the
WTE itself, namely the negative charge densities and the low
charge drop-offs in presence of large barriers. These points
have to be investigated further, and the SE solver may be of
help, as it allows to compute accurate boundary conditions in
the quantum region, at least for a single rectangular barrier
structure. These boundary conditions can then be applied to
the WTE solver, thus eliminating the memory overhead of
meshing large contact regions.
This approach has also helped investigate some basic ge-
ometry parameters and numerical implementation conditions
that must be applied to the WTE solver in order to accurately
simulate 1D single- and double-barrier structures. As for
the device geometry, the minimum contact length has been
investigated. In single-barrier structures, it has been found that
the WF at the boundaries follows a Fermi-Dirac Distribution
(FDD) if the contact length is greater than 30 nm in silicon-
based devices and about 60 nm in III-V-based ones; in double-
barrier ones, the WF separates from the FDD reference proﬁle
a few decades below the peak and forms oscillating lobes
that are not signiﬁcantly affected by either the contact length
or the numerical computing precision. As for the simulation
numerical parameters, this work investigates the range of the
WF in the wave vector space required to accurately compute
the charge. In silicon-based structures, this range is estimated
between 10 and 15 nm−1 for an error smaller than 1%, and
ﬁve to ten times lower in III-V equivalent structures.
This work also presents WF plots in silicon biased struc-
tures. The potential proﬁles used are simpliﬁed in order to
allow for a symbolic solution of the SE, and carrier interactions
are not taken into account. Nevertheless, it is still possible
to observe some trends at different bias points, namely the
increasing asymmetry in the lobes for positive and negative
wave vectors in the WF plots at the collector of the different
structures.
