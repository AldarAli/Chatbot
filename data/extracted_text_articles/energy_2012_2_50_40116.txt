Abstract—We 
present 
multiple-input 
multiple-output 
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) 
based broadband power line communication (BPLC) using 
antenna and fading diversity. We evaluate the proposed 
MIMO-OFDM system over multi-conductor power line 
channels, with or without cross-talk between the antenna paths. 
The proposed scheme employs maximum ratio combining 
(MRC) that effectively combines both the multiple antenna 
diversity gain and the multipath fading diversity gain over 3-
phase (2´2 MIMO, outdoor) power line channels. Simulation 
results prove that the proposed scheme improves the bit error 
rate performance over the existing schemes, irrespective of 
whether cross-talk exists.

 INTRODUCTION 
Smart grid (SG) is a future power grid network based on 
regenerative green energy; it requires high-rate data 
transmission technology for bidirectional information 
exchange among electric power providers, electricity 
industries, 
and 
consumers. 
Broadband 
power 
line 
communication (BPLC) that allows a reliable high-rate 
transmission over power cables is available at a low cost 
because it does not require any additional infrastructure; 
further, it is ubiquitous because it is available anywhere 
where there is electricity and is easy-to-access with a plug-in 
power cable. Hence, a BPLC network is a promising medium 
for SG and its associated services such as advance metering 
infrastructure. Moreover, since an international BPLC 
standard, IEEE 1901 [1], was adopted in 2010, there has 
been a growing interest in various other BPLC applications 
including 
home 
networks, 
high-speed 
Internet, 
and 
emergency backup networks. 
A BPLC signal transmitted via an electric power cable 
experiences severe channel distortions such as multipath 
fading and impulse noise. In this study, we use the 
Middleton class A model [2] for handling the impulse noise 
and the Zimmermann frequency model [3] for handling the 
power line multipath fading.  
In the case of a 3-phase 4-wire power cable, we implement 
a 2×2 multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency 
division 
multiplexing 
(MIMO-OFDM) 
BPLC 
with 
maximum ratio combining (MRC). A recent literature search 
revealed several MIMO-OFDM BPLC schemes [4-6] that 
use antenna MRC (AMRC) for obtaining the spatial diversity 
gain. In particular, the authors in [4] first introduced a space 
frequency (SF)-coded MIMO-OFDM over power line 
channels. The authors in [5] implemented a space time (ST)-
coded MIMO-OFDM for outdoor multi-conductor power 
cables and performed an experiment showing the capacity 
loss caused by antenna coupling. The authors in [6] 
compared the simulation results of SF-, ST-, and space time 
frequency (STF)-coded MIMO-OFDM over indoor power 
line channels and demonstrated the superiority of STF 
coding.  
Contributions. The contribution of this paper is a novel 
SF-coded MIMO-OFDM scheme employing antenna and 
fading MRC (AFMRC) that effectively combines both 
multiple antenna and multipath fading diversity. Through a 
computer simulation, in this study, we prove that a coupling 
effect is not negligible with respect to the performance of a 
MIMO system. Simulation results also verify that the 
proposed scheme is superior to conventional schemes, 
irrespective whether cross-talk between antenna channels 
exists. The proposed scheme improves the bit error rate 
(BER) performance not only in the 2×2 MIMO system via a 
3-phase 4-wire power line but also in the single-input single-
output (SISO) system via a single-phase 2-wire power line; 
note that the SISO system uses fading MRC (FMRC) instead 
of AMRC. We also evaluate the system design parameters 
by comparing the BER when the impulse noise index A is 
varied. 
Organization of the paper. The rest of this paper is 
organized as follows: Section II explains the power line 
channel characteristics including impulse noise and 
multipath fading and presents the proposed MIMO-OFDM 
BPLC system model over multi-conductor power line 
channels. Section III presents the simulation results of the 
proposed scheme, which are compared with those of the 
existing schemes. Finally, concluding remarks are given in 
Section IV.

SYSTEM MODEL 
A. Impulse Noise and Fading Channel in BPLC 
A BPLC channel can be characterized by both impulse 
noise and multipath fading owing to the multiple signal 
reflections caused by a power line impedance mismatch. 
First, for handling the impulse noise, we use the Middleton 
class A model [2], whose pdf (probability density function) is 
defined as

where L is the number of fading paths. α0, α1, and u are the

indicate the lower limit of the OFDM bandwidth (BW)), Df is

B. MIMO-OFDM BPLC System 
In this study, we design a MIMO-OFDM system that 
contains I (transmit antennas) × J (receive antennas). In the 
OFDM transmitter, the kth subcarrier modulation signal, 
S(k), experiences the following inverse fast Fourier 
transform (IFFT)

where s(n) is the nth (= 0, 1, …, N-1) time sample and N is 
the number of subcarriers. 
In a MIMO BPLC system, a pair of electrical wires is 
converted into a single antenna channel; hence, the number 
of transmitting and receiving antennas is typically limited to 
two for a 3-phase 4-wire power line and one for a single-
phase 2-wire power line. Therefore, MIMO-OFDM is used 
either indoors or outdoors with a 3-phase 4-wire power line, 
whereas SISO-OFDM is mostly used indoors with a single-
phase 2-wire power line. Fig. 1(a) shows the block diagram 
of a 2×2 MIMO-OFDM BPLC system that uses a 3-phase 4-
wire power line (Fig. 1(b) shows its cross-cut interior 
structure). This 2×2 MIMO system has two antenna paths 
that consist of a single antenna path formed by C1 and C2 
and another single antenna path formed by C3 and C4; C0 
assumes the role of a ground connection [4]. An SF encoder 
is used for reducing the error probability caused by the 
interference in the MIMO channel. The following two SF 
encoder vectors S1 and S2 are formed by arranging the same 
subcarrier signal samples in an appropriate order (i.e., vector 
S2 is the circular-shifted version of S1 [4]) for this SF 
encoder.

where S1[k] = S2[k], (k = 0, 1, …, N-1) and (×)T refers to the 
transpose of (×). S1 and S2 are respectively converted to the 
corresponding time sample vectors, s1=IFFT{S1} and 
s2=IFFT{S2}, through the IFFT process (see (4)) and then 
transmitted to the receiver via each antenna path. In the 
system shown in Fig. 1(a), this transmission process occurs 
at the signal encoder and modulator, and the corresponding 
receiving process is processed at the linear combiner and 
detector. A cyclic prefix (CP) is added to the OFDM 
modulated sample vectors (s1, s2) before their transmission to 
prevent inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by the 
multipath delay. The signal received via the fading channel 
undergoes the SF decoding process, i.e., fast Fourier 
transform (FFT), an inverse circular-shift operation, and then 
the MRC process, to recover its data stream after the removal 
of the added CP.

1) MRC without Cross-Talk 
For simplifying the simulation, we assume that there is no 
coupling between the two antenna paths (this assumption is 
practically reasonable for the carrier frequency fc < 25 MHz 
[6].).

The diversity gain of a conventional system that uses 
AMRC is obtained by multiplying its optimum weight to the 
different spatial antenna paths. The system proposed in this 
paper employs AFMRC, a combined technique of AMRC 
and FMRC. The proposed system has one receiver per fading 
path to achieve the FMRC gain. Assuming the same transmit 
signal via the jth antenna L fading paths, i.e., Sj(k) = Sj,1(k) 
= Sj,2(k) = … = Sj,L(k), we can write the jth (j = 1,2) 
antenna received signal Yj(k) at the kth subcarrier as

where Es represents the average energy of the transmit

subcarrier noise component, that is the result of the FFT 
operation of the time axis impulse plus Gaussian noise 
signal xj,l(n) with the variance σ2 (see (1)). In this study, we 
assume ideal fading channel estimation to simplify the 
simulation [7]. 
In the application of the proposed MRC (AFMRC) to 
the single-phase 2-wire SISO BPLC (just using FMRC) 
and the 3-phase 4-wire 2×2 MIMO BPLC, we express the 
output Ŝ (detected signal) of the maximum likelihood 
(ML) receiver as

However, as shown in (7), the receiver complexity of the 
AFMRC-based SISO/MIMO system increases L-fold due 
to the addition of FMRC. Even in the case of the indoor 
single-phase 2-wire SISO channel, the proposed scheme 
has the FMRC diversity gain. 
2) MRC with Cross-Talk 
The proposed MIMO system, shown in Fig. 1(a), might 
have cross-talk (its capacity loss might not be negligible 
(but less than 16%), especially in the case of fc ³ 25 MHz 
[6].) between two parallel antenna channels; this cross-talk 
degrades the system performance. The 2×2 MIMO channel

SIMULATION RESULTS 
We simulate the proposed system model with the QPSK 
constellation under the power line channel conditions, and 
compare its uncoded BER results to that of a conventional 
system [6]. We assume a multipath fading PLC channel 
with L = 6, whose simulation parameters are the same as 
those given in Table I of [6]. For the sake of simplicity, we 
also assume the same fading channel parameters for the 
two antenna paths1). We set N = 1024, CP size = 120 
(unit: sample), fc = 25 MHz, Df (frequency spacing) = 1 
KHz, and BW = 1.024 MHz for the simulation; hence, the 
maximum data rate is approximately 1.83 Mbps. 
 
Figure 2.  BER Comparison of 2×2 MIMO PLC for different values of A. 
Fig. 2 presents a comparison of the BER of the 2×2 
MIMO BPLC system when the impulse noise index A is 
varied. For this experiment, we set τ = 0.1. While for a 
large value of A (³ 1), the noise channel characteristics 
approach those of Gaussian noise, for a small value of A 
(<1), they are similar to those of impulse noise. Hence, the 
BER decreases when the value of A increases, as shown in 
Fig. 2. For example, in the case of A = 10, we can obtain 
approximately 1-dB gain at BER = 10-5 as compared to the 
case of A = 1, 3-dB gain as compared to the case of A = 0.3, 
and 5.5-dB gain as compared to the case of A = 0.1. 
Practically, in the BPLC channel environment, A has a 
value within the range of 0.0001 to 0.35; hence, we choose 
A = 0.3 for the next experiment [6]. 
Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the BER performance 
between the conventional AMRC and the proposed 
                                                           
1)  In the case of PLC channels using 3-phase 4-wire power line, the cha
nging of channel parameters between the antenna paths is almost neglig
ible in practice [8]. 
AFMRC in the SISO/MIMO-OFDM systems. First, in the 
case of the MIMO system, AFMRC results in a 
performance gain of approximately 1 dB at BER = 10-5 as 
compared to AMRC. Fig. 3 also shows a comparison of 
the conventional method (with no MRC) and the proposed 
method (with FMRC) in the case of the SISO-OFDM 
system; it shows a 1.5-dB improvement in the case of BER 
= 10-5 for the proposed scheme. Therefore, the simulation 
verifies that the proposed SISO/MIMO-OFDM system is 
more effective, in the case of both an indoor single-phase 
power line and an outdoor 3-phase power line, than the 
conventional SISO/MIMO-OFDM system.

Fig. 4 shows the performance of an SF-based MIMO 
BPLC system with cross-talk. The proposed scheme has a 
gain of approximately 0.7–0.8 dB over the conventional 
scheme at the BER = 10-5. When the CR value increases from

1% to 15%, the BER performance of both schemes degrades 
by approximately 1 dB. As a result, it is observed that the 
effect of crosstalk on the performance of an MIMO-OFDM 
system is not negligible. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We proposed an MIMO-OFDM-based BPLC system 
with antenna and fading MRC (AFMRC) that effectively 
combines multiple antenna and multipath fading diversity. 
We evaluated the proposed MIMO-OFDM system over 
multi-conductor power line channels with or without cross-
talk between the antenna paths. The computer simulation 
verified that the proposed scheme was more efficient in 
terms of system performance in the case of both the indoor 
single-phase (SISO) and the outdoor 3-phase (MIMO) BPLC 
applications than the conventional schemes.
