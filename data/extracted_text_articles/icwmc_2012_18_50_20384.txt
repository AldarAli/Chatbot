Abstract— The article reports the results of the research on 
reducing handicaps level to radio signal in a Wi-Fi network. 
The authors consider the theory of multi-media in order to 
understand the processes taking place during reflection of 
electromagnetic waves with a frequency of 2.4GHz. The 
resulting numerical modeling conclusions are used to develop 
measures for the processing of premises multilayer materials. 
Experiments have shown that the rate of data transmission in 
wireless IEEE 802.11n standard after treatment of premises 
increased by 15-20%.

INTRODUCTION 
Recently, content of data transmitted has more changed 
to the side of multimedia. This leads to an increase in the 
volume of data transmitted. To transmit large volumes of 
data need to increase the data rate. Adopted in 2009, the 
IEEE 802.11n declares transmit rate of 300 Mbit/s, but the 
real data transmit rate is 20-30% of the declared. The 
statistical theory of radiowave distribution indoor is 
described in our paper [1]. It offers a way to increase the 
speed of the network. Let us consider another way. 
Section "Interference handicaps" is devoted to research 
features the work of the interference noises of wireless 
networks. In the section "Definition of factor of reflection 
interference materials», we consider the theory of the 
behavior of the reflection coefficient of the vertical and 
horizontal polarization plane waves at oblique incidence in 
the controlled environment. The section "Definition of 
permittivity" is devoted to research of one of the methods for 
determining the different materials dielectric permittivity ε *. 
On the basis of the developed theory, we conducted a pilot 
research that is presented in section "Application of the 
geometric theory at construction of Wireless Networks".

INTERFERENCE HANDICAPS 
Interference 
handicaps, 
arising 
due 
to 
repeated 
radiowaves reflection from surrounding subjects, are shown 
in simultaneous receipt in the receiver of useful signal 
"copies" set with the displaced phases that can result in its 
easing or even full disappearance on separate sites of the 
spectrum (so-called "fading"). 
Under the same system Direct Sequence Spread 
Spectrum (DSSS) external conditions appear steadier to 
fading, than Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum(FHSS) (as 
well as in case of the narrow-band handicaps, the useful 
signal appears deformed only on separate frequencies); 
however, they are much more sensitive to displacement in 
time of the protected binary signal - because of considerably 
shorter (approximately ten times) pulses duration the levels 
wrong interpretation probability 0 or 1 grows at gate. 
At electromagnetic radiation interaction with materials in 
the last absorption (dielectric and magnetic decreasees), 
dispersion (due to structural heterogeneity of a material) and 
radiowaves interference take place. Non-magnetic materials 
from the radio signal absorption view subdivide on 
interference, gradient and combined. Interference materials 
will consist of alternating dielectric and conducting layers. 
The waves reflected from electro conductive layers and from 
a protected object metal surface interfere among themselves 
in them. Gradient materials (the most extensive class) have 
multilayered structure with smooth or step change of 
complex dielectric permeability on thickness (it is usual 
under the hyperbolic law). Their thickness is rather great and 
makes> 0.12-0.15 λmax, where λmax - the maximal working 
wave length (in our case 0.12м). The external (matching) 
layer is made from firm dielectric with the big maintenance 
of air inclusions, with the dielectric permeability close to 
unit, with other (absorbing) layers - from dielectric with high 
dielectric permeability with absorbing conducting stuff. Also 
materials with a relief external surface (formed by ledges as 
thorns, cones and pyramids), named subulate materials are 
conditionally related to gradient materials. Reflection's factor 
reduction is promoted by repeated waves reflection from 
thorns surfaces (with waves energy absorption at each 
reflection) in them.  The combined materials - a combination 
of gradient and interference materials. They differ in action 
efficiency in the expanded wave band. 
The greatest level interfering handicaps is provided with 
signals at direct falling a radiowave on a material. At 
application of not directed aerial access point is a wall or a 
ceiling to which the aerial fastens. Application gradient 
material for processing a wall or a ceiling in the aerial 
fastening point can provide increase in a ratio signal/noise up 
to 6 dB. The aerial direction on a concave surface is 
inadmissible, as it results in a high level interfering

handicaps and high non-uniformity of a radio signal. Walls 
on which the direct radiowave gets are processed interfering 
or gradient materials. 
III. 
DEFINITION OF FACTOR OF REFLECTION 
INTERFERENCE MATERIALS 
The most difficult for practical work is reflection factor 
definition of materials premises used for processing. 
Radiophysical diagnostics systems work and the control 
interference environments are based on the reaction analysis 
of the researched environment on probing signal. 
One of the most actual the problem is problem of the 
electromagnetic waves interaction adequate description with 
sound the environment characterized by complex dielectric 
permeability (ε *) by the sounding data interpretation 
methods development.  It is connected by that sound material 
environments represent complex dielectric structures.  These 
environments constantly contact to a variable temperature 
field and water in its various modular conditions in real 
conditions. These variable components define, basically, 
dielectric properties of such environments. 
It is necessary to take into account spatial distribution ε * 
at the of radiowave diagnostics of a condition and properties 
of such environments problems decision. The data about 
profile distribution ε * can be received or from the aprioristic 
data, or using the approached theoretical models, or 
experimentally. One of the reflected signals interpretation 
methods perfection directions is connected with the 
modeling tasks decision of which are taking into account flat 
waves interaction with the layered environment which is 
described by real geometrical parameters and real dielectric 
characteristics. 
Let us analyze reflection factor behaviour of flat waves 
of vertical and horizontal polarization at inclined falling on 
the controllable environment. Sharing of vertically and 
horizontal the polarized waves results allow to take the 
information on dielectric properties layers. 
Statement of a task 
On the flaky-non-uniform dielectric environment from 
free space (ε * =1, µ * = 1) the flat electromagnetic wave 
under various Θ angels (Fig. 1) falls.

Figure 1.  Geometry of a problem 
It is required to define values of factor of reflection K 
from the researched environment depending on a horizontal 
and vertical polarization waves falling angel in case of a 
presence on the dielectric layers environment surface. The 
top and bottom layers have half-infinite thickness, and 
thickness of second rather thin layer is a variable quantity 
and commensurable with a wave length. Values ε * the 
second and third layer change during experiment. 
Physical model 
Environment with profile distribution ε usually is 
represented as multilayered system for carrying out of 
numerical modeling. In this case, ε * will be function of 
coordinate Ζ, and on borders between layers this function can 
be explosive. Dependence ε * (Ζ) inside each layer is set by 
numerical values in some points Ζi. We consider ε * between 
points Ζi and Ζi+1 constant and homogeneous in Χ and Υ 
directions on layers for simplification of calculations. 
Mathematical model 
The multilayered environment reflection factor is defined 
under the recurrent formula [2]:

Reflection factors modules for wave’s horizontal |KH| 
and vertical |KV| polarization have been designed at various 
falling Θ angels on sound environment by formulas (4−8) for 
different environment conditions (Fig. 1). Thus thickness of 
a thin layer h2 varied, various values ε * a thin layer and the 
third layer were set. For presentation thickness of a thin layer 
was set in relative units and normalized thus to a wave length 
in the environment

The formulas (4-8) analysis and diagrams on Figs. 2-4 
shows, that factors of reflection |KH| and |KV| on Figs. 2-3 
behave classically, as in case of falling a flat wave on the 
homogeneous 
dielectric 
environment. 
Diagrams 
|KH| 
monotonously grow from the minimal value at Θ = 0 up to 
maximal - at Θ =90. Dependence |KV| from a falling angel 
has more complex kind. In the beginning of coordinates 
diagrams monotonously decrease up to zero, and then grow 
up to unit more sharply. Position of a minimum on the 
diagram depends on thickness and ε * thin a layer, and also 
ε * the third layer (Figs. 2-7). Besides concurrence of 
diagrams |KV| and |KH|, received is observed in case of a thin 
layer absence, with diagrams when a thin layer thickness is 
equal 0.5λε (Figs. 2,3-6,7). This fact indicates that the 
reflected waves from a thin layer and environment are 
summarized in a phase.

In certain situations the behavior of diagrams |KV| and 
|KH| differs from considered above (Figs. 8-9). At the certain 
values ε1, ε2, ε3 layers and thickness of a thin layer equal 
0.25λε the reflected waves from the top layer and a spreading 
surface are summarized in an antiphase, as results in change 
of a kind of diagrams |KV| and |KH|.

The figures analysis confirms characteristic failures

parities ε1, ε2, ε3 layers, a falling angel Θ and a thin layer

presence of decreases in the environment and a thin layer. 
The fact of presence of special points in behavior of factors 
of reflection |KV| and |KH| can be used for development of 
algorithms of definition ε * or thickness of a thin layer. 
Presence of characteristic failures on diagrams at small 
values ε2 allows picking up such material, the reflection 
factor from which will be minimal (Figs. 8-11). At the big 
size ε2 characteristic, dependence is observed; the increase in 
a thin layer h2 thickness results in increase in reflection 
factor (Figs. 12-15).

We research theoretically an opportunity of application of 
linear aerials for measurement of thickness (h2) and 
permittivity (ε2) first layers of the two-layer environment on 
a variable frequency method. Let us define h2 and ε2 by 
measurement results of an ultrahigh-frequency linear aerials 
entrance impedance available above environment in turn. 
Linear aerials impedance measurements are carried out with 
the help of a transfer complex factors measuring instrument. 
Let us assume, that aerial A in length 2l is set at height h 
above the horizontal - layered environment in parallel a 
surface of environment (Fig. 16). Environment consists of 
two layers. The first layer is characterized by thickness h2 
and complex permittivity ε2 *, the second layer - thickness 
h3 and complex permittivity ε3*. 
 
Figure 16.  The plan to a problem about definition of an impedance 
of the linear aerial located above the two-layer environment  
Assume that the environment first layer is dielectric, and 
the second layer - conductive. The first layer thickness is 
finite, the second layer represents half-subspace (h3 → ∞). 
Let us consider three cases. In the first case the first layer 
will be a pine board (ε2 = 2.73, h2 = 0.07 м), in the second 
case - a burnt brick (ε2 = 5.5, h2 = 0.066 м), in the third 
case - the block from a glass (ε2 = 6, h2 = 0.117 м). In all 
three cases value of the factor of decreases of the first layer 
we shall accept equal 0.01. Let aerials will be adjusted on 
frequencies 300, 350.. 2200 MHz (with step 50 MHz). 
The length of each aerial without taking into account the 
aerial thickness  is determined n the following way:

c – speed of distribution of waves in free space, m/s 
f – frequency of tuning of the aerial, Hz.  
Each aerial is above environment at the height equal to 
optimum height of the half-wave linear aerial arrangement 
above a homogeneous environment
h = .0 28λ
. 
Under condition of an the half-wave linear aerial 
arrangement above a homogeneous environment at the 
height equal or not enough distinguished from 0.28λ, the 
maximal value of the module of an impedance of the aerial 
is observed. 
Results of the calculation executed with use of theoretical 
model [3], are submitted in Fig. 17 as diagrams of 
dependences of the half-wave linear aerial impedance 
module located above the two-layer environment, from the 
aerial tuning frequency. The curve 1 conforms to a case 
when the environment first layer is the pine board, curve 2 - 
a burnt brick, a curve 3 - the block from a glass.

2: ε2* = 5.5 – 0.01i (burnt brick), h2 = 0.066 m;  
3: ε2* = 5.3 – 0.0035i (glass), h2 = 0.12 m 
Under the diagrams submitted in Fig. 17, it is possible to 
determine one of first layer parameters of the two-layer 
environment (h2 or ε2) if another is known. For calculation 
of thickness of the first layer we shall use the formula

For example, for a case when the environment first layer 
is the pine board; on a curve 1 in Fig. 17, we find fmin1 = 
1401.542 MHz and fmin2 = 2711.424 MHz.  
Thus ∆f = 654.941 MHz. Having substituted values ε2 
and ∆f in the formula (10), we receive value h2, equal 0.069 
m. In this case, the deviation of settlement value of 
thickness of the first layer from a preset value (∆h2) is equal 
1.4%.

Similarly we determine a material thickness for a burnt 
brick and glasses. We use the minimal values close to 
frequency researched by us 2.4GHz. 
Results of calculation under the formula (10) the two-

For the definition of permittivity dielectric, which 
thickness is unknown, the following algorithm is applied. 
First the difference of frequencies ∆f1 is defined, 
corresponding to unknown thickness of a layer h2 then the 
superficial part of a layer having thickness ∆h2 is removed. 
Then the difference of frequencies ∆f2 is defined, 
corresponding to the stayed thickness of a layer (h2 - ∆h2), 
and depend on ε2. For research of a permittivity dielectric 
measurement opportunity with unknown thickness we return 
to third of the considered cases. 
Let us reduce thickness of the first layer (the block from a 
glass) by 0.036 m and we calculate the module of an linear 
aerials impedance, serially available above the two-layer 
environment.  
 
1: ε2* = 5.3 – 0.035i (glass), h2 = 0.12 m;  
2: ε2* = 5.3 – 0.035i (glass), h2 = 0.084 m

of tuning at various thickness of the first layer  
Results of calculation are submitted in Fig. 18 as a curve 
of 2 the half-wave linear aerial impedance module 
dependences located above the two-layer environment, from 
frequency of tunnig of the aerial. The curve 1 corresponds to 
a case when a glass layer thickness is equal 0.12 m, and is a 
part of the curve 3 represented in Fig. 17. 
Under the diagrams submitted in Fig. 18, it is possible to 
define ε2, not knowing h2. For calculation of the first layer 
permittivity when its thickness is unknown, we shall use the 
formula

∆f2 – The difference of frequencies corresponding to 
thickness of the first layer (h2 - ∆h2), Hz, 
∆h2 - a difference of thickness of the first layer, m. 
Having substituted in the formula (13) values ∆f1 and 
∆f2, found under the diagrams represented in Fig. 18, we 
receive the value ε2 equal 5.256. In this case, the deviation 
of settlement value ε2 from a preset value is equal 1 %.

standard equipment IEEE 802.11n usage. Router Linksys 
WRT610N, Netgear WNDR3700 and TRENDnet TEW-
671BR are used as POP. 
The research was carried out on the basis of method [4] 
and rate was measured by IxChariot [5]. 
TCP-traffic (with max size package mainly) is generated 
by the program and different situation as receiving, 
transmission and both synchronous (direction to adapter in 
PC)  is modeling. POP (Depending from model no all point 
was available) is set to operate with 802.11n range on 
channel 1(5) in regime  «40 MHz», previous generation  
network security regime was switched off, ciphering WPA2-
PSK whit с AES algorithm was switched on. Other settings 
were standard. 
That network works sufficiently stable should take into 
account, as data transmission rate negligible changed  during 
all test. After the first cycle of measurements, we treated the 
room multilayer materials. Special attention was given to 
surface where the falling electromagnetic wave at the first 
reflection. Then there was held the measurements second 
series. 
Test results are shown on Figs. 19, 20, 21, and 22.

CONCLUSIONS 
The results of the modeling calculations carried out by 
the authors allow to draw a conclusion that the layered 
environments parameters control is possible with the helt of 
electromagnetic waves of vertical and horizontal polarization 
in the range of 2.4 GHz. To determine the dielectric layers 
were suggested the method of using half-wave antenna. The 
given theory we used for the treatment premises. The model 
calculations results were approved in the experiments. The 
experimental results at frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz 
have shown that after a special treatment of premises rate 
increased by 5-10%.
