Abstract-A smart electrical grid is highly instrumented and can 
be intelligently controlled. We describe a smart grid study in 
which we assume that utilities dynamically price electrical 
power to help regulate supply and demand balance, and that 
consumers have the ability to intelligently schedule times for 
the operation of their home appliances in response to prices. 
We present a mixed integer linear fuzzy goal programming 
with priorities imposed on different appliances. The goal 
programming formulation allows time preference constraints 
to be elastic rather than rigid. Another important feature of 
the model is flexibility of time slot delays for pairs of 
appliances for which the operation of one must follow the other 
(a washer/dryer pair for example). Numerical experimental 
results based on real spot prices for electricity are presented. 
In addition, computational time and the influence of time slot 
lengths and priorities are discussed.

INTRODUCTION 
Dynamic electricity pricing on an hourly basis is 
increasingly common in the United States [1]. This pricing 
policy is intended to help reduce system peak demand and 
also shift some load to off-peak, less expensive time periods. 
This can achieve more balance between energy demand and 
generation. Hourly pricing provides customers with 
opportunities to reduce their costs by managing the times at 
which electricity is consumed in the home. Smart appliances 
that can be accessed and controlled under the expanded 
addressing space of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) are 
becoming common, and older appliances can be IP 
controlled through devices such as smart power bars.  
Several studies on optimal scheduling of home 
appliances have been reported. Using Markov chains to 
model both energy prices and residential device usage, an 
energy management system called CAES for residential 
demand response applications to reduce residential energy 
costs and smooth energy usage was proposed [2]. In 
developing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) 
problem formulation for electricity management in multiple 
homes, Oliveira et al. considered both cost and variations in 
the availability of the power supply [3]. Sou et al. proposed 
an MILP formulation with discrete time-slots [4]. In that 
model, one execution period (e.g., one day) is discretized 
into a prescribed number of uniform time slots.  Amounts of 
energy are assigned to each time slot for each phase of 
appliance operation. Inspired by the model of Sou, Wu 
included the CO2 footprint cost into the objective function 
by giving it a weight for modeling environmental concerns 
[5]. Giorgio developed a similar MILP formulation, but also 
included domestic renewable energy and batteries as energy 
sources [6].  
In our work, we schedule home appliances using time 
slots and a MILP, based on portions of the existing work [4]. 
We expand the approach by adopting a fuzzy goal 
programming formulation [8]. Our model supports priority 
distinctions for the different appliances, and rigid time 
preference constraints are transformed into soft ones and 
included in the fuzzy goal programming framework with 
priorities. In addition, we devised constraints for modeling 
alternative delay times between running times of closely 
related appliances. The new method uses electricity prices 
known 24 hours in advance; so, the scheduling is exactly 
one day ahead.  
Section II briefly introduces the concept of MILP and 
fuzzy goal programming; Section III presents the 
mathematical formulation for our mixed integer linear fuzzy 
goal programming model; Section IV provides the 
numerical experiments and results; and Section V presents 
the conclusions. 
II. 
MILP AND GOAL PROGRAMMING 
MILP is a widely used subset of mathematical 
programming in which the objective function is a linear 
function of the decision variables, which can be either 
integer or non-integer. Each constraint is formed from a 
linear combination of the decision variables [7].  
When multiple, conflicting objectives or goals are 
involved in an optimization problem, goal programming is a 
powerful and effective tool. The two major differences of 
goal programming from conventional single-objective linear 
programming are the incorporation of flexibility in the 
constraint functions, and the satisficing approach that seeks 
a balanced and practical solution rather than an absolute 
optimal one [8]. To solve optimization problem with 
multiple conflicting goals using fuzzy goal programming, 
which is also called Chebyshev goal programming [8], each 
original single goal is first optimized to get the 
corresponding optimal goal value, then a solution that

minimizes the maximum deviation from any single 
optimized goal value is sought. Based on the degree of 
importance of each goal, priorities can be added to these 
deviations to reflect different penalties applied to different 
failures to meet the optimal goals [9]. A new general goal 
based on the weighted sum of deviations can therefore be 
formed and solved.

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 
A. Assumptions and Parameters 
We define an energy phase as an uninterruptible sub-
process of the entire operation process of an appliance.  
Each appliance has a single phase or multiple energy phases 
that must be operated in sequence, with each using a pre-
specified amount of electrical energy. The technical 
specifications of appliances defined by the manufacturers of 
appliances must be met. Constraints are employed to ensure 
the sequential operations of some appliances, to model the 
delay between the running of two closely related appliances, 
to ensure that the total energy consumed within a certain 
period does not exceed the peak energy allowed, and to 
ensure that user time preferences are met. The overall 
objective of the model is to produce the schedule for 
running the appliances that saves a consumer as much 
energy cost as possible, while meeting all of the constraints. 
Our MILP formulation is for a single 24-hour day. Each 
hour is uniformly discretized into   time slots, so that the 
number of total time slots in a day is    24*  . N is the 
number of appliances, and for each appliance i (   
       ),   is the number of uninterruptible energy phases 
for each appliance.  
Parameters
   (                      )   
satisfying ∑
       
   
, are used to model the priorities 
assigned to each single deviation goal in the fuzzy goal 
programming model. Here,               is for the 
deviation goals for each corresponding appliance energy 
cost, and      is the priority for the user time preference 
penalty deviation goal.                        
is specified by the user according to their preferences for 
different appliances. 
                          represents the nominal 
processing time for energy phase   for appliance   in 
minutes,   and   (              ) are lower and 
upper processing time limit factors for energy phase   of 
appliance  . To denote the lower and upper limits of power 
assignment, respectively, to the corresponding energy phase, 
   
  and    
  are introduced. The delay between two energy 
phases of an appliance is restricted by     and    , the 
appliance technical specifications defining the lower and 
upper delay time, respectively, in minutes.     is used to 
denote the total energy that a  phase should use according to 
the technical specification. 
 
B. Decision variables 
Real 
(continuous) 
decision 
variables    
 
    
                               are used to indicate 
the energy assigned to energy phase   of appliance   during 
the period of time slot  .  
      To indicate during time slot k whether a particular 
energy phase   of appliance   is being processed, a series of 
binary decision variables    
  {   } are used, with    
    
indicating energy phase being processed, and otherwise not 
being processed.  
Binary variables    
  {   }  are utilized to indicate 
whether the processing of a particular energy phase is 
already finished by a particular time slot. If and only if 
   
   , energy phase j of appliance   is complete by time 
slot  .  
To indicate whether appliance   is making a transition 
between energy phase     to   at time slot  , binary 
variables     
            are utilized.     
    if and only 
if during time slot  , the appliance   has finished energy 
phase     in some earlier time slot, but the energy phase   
has not yet started. These variables are useful for restricting 
the delay between energy phases of an appliance.  
For 
the 
fuzzy 
goals, 
parameters           
           are introduced to denote the normalized 
maximum deviation between the best and the worst values 
of each single objective function. Specifically,      
         are for the corresponding appliances, and      is 
for the user time preference.   
C. Constraints 
    1)  Single appliance energy cost objective function:     
The total electricity cost for appliance   during the entire 
execution period, denoted by               , is 
                                  ∑
∑
     
 
  
   
 
   
                              (1) 
where,    denotes the electricity price for time slot  .  
    2) Objective function for user time preference violation 
penalty:  Here, we consider a simple user time preference in 
which the household user divides the day into two general 
parts: one that can be used to run a certain appliance and the 
other one cannot. Rather than use rigid constraints to 
absolutely prohibit using an appliance during the non-
preferred time, we allow the time period to be used but 
impose a penalty on doing so. Let    
  {   } denote the 
user time preference interval, and    
    if and only if 
none of the energy phase of appliance   is to be run during 
time slot  . Assume       
 
,     
 
, and     
 
 is the first, 
middle, and the last slot number of the whole user 
prohibited time period (which is continuous) for appliance  , 
respectively; then the penalty for using prohibited time is 
expressed as 
                    ∑

where,     is a constant, and     
 
 [       
 
     
 
  
⁄ ]. 
This is the objective function for the violation penalty for a 
user time preference, and is denoted as     . Note that this 
function is a weighted penalty in that the closer to the 
middle of the prohibited time zone, the higher penalty that 
results.  
    3) Maximum single objective deviation constraints:  Let 
   and    be the best possible and worst possible values, 
respectively, for the     single objective, then we have the 
following constraints: 
                                       
⁄
      (3) 
                                                           (4) 
Each                 represents the worst deviation 
level for the     objective. Each    and    are obtained by 
optimizing corresponding    and     alone, respectively, 
without regard to other objectives. The expression      
    in (3) helps normalize the objective deviation level and 
thus adjust different levels to similar fluctuation ranges. 
With the normalized deviation levels, applying desired 
priorities to different objectives is easier. In consideration of 
the interaction between or among appliances and user time 
preferences,    may be close to but not the real possible 
optimal single objective value. So, an auxiliary coefficient 
  is incorporated to    to help use a better objective value 
than the “false” best possible value. Since in this study the 
best single objective value is the minimum value,    should 
be a positive constant and less than 1.  
    4) Sequential processing between appliances:  Suppose 
appliance  ̃ must be finished before appliance   starts (for 
example, the washing machine operations must be finished 
before the dryer starts), then the following constraint 
restricting the relationship between the last energy phase of 
the appliance  ̃  and the first energy phase of appliance    
must be satisfied: 
                                   ̃  ̃
     
                                      (5) 
    5) Between-appliance delay: In reality, some appliances 
are more closely related than just following the constraints 
restricting their sequential processing. For example, the 
dryer can start running only after the washing machine is 
finished, as specified by (5), and in practice the delay 
between the two appliances usually cannot be very large. 
Suppose, for example, that if the dryer must start working 
within 3 time slots after the washing machine is done, then 
the following constraints holds: 
  ̃  ̃
    ̃  ̃
      ̃  ̃
     
       
       
    
                                         ,                            (6) 
These constraints should be used together with (5), 
namely, appliance  ̃ and   must satisfy (5) first.  
To establish that these constraints are theoretically 
correct, consider the logic below. 
If    is the first time slot after the last energy phase of 
appliance  ̃ is finished, then      is the last slot when the 
last energy phase of appliance  ̃ is being processed. This 
also implies:  
      i) When     ,   ̃  ̃
    ̃  ̃
     , and   ̃  ̃
        , so, 
the left side of the constraints is always equal to or less than 
0. In this case, the constraints hold. Also in this case, the 
appliances sequential processing constraints ensure that all 
   
         . 
      ii) When     ,   ̃  ̃
      ̃  ̃
     , and   ̃  ̃
   , so, 
the left side of the constraints is always equal to 1. In this 
case, the constraints require that at least one of the time slots 
right after the finishing of the previous appliance must be 
used to start processing of the second appliance. 
      iii) When     ,   ̃  ̃
    ̃  ̃
     , and   ̃  ̃
   , so, the 
left side of the constraints is always equal to 0. In this case, 
the constraints hold. 
    6) Sequential processing between energy phases:  
Usually an energy phase of an appliance cannot start 
working unless its preceding phases have finished. The 
following constraints specify this condition:  
                           
 
    
                                (7) 
    7) Between-phase delay: The delay between two energy 
phases of an appliance is restricted to a specific range. 
Suppose that      and     are the appliance technical 
specifications defining the lower and upper delay, 
respectively, in minutes, then the following constraints must 
be satisfied: 
        ⌈
   
   ⌉  ∑
   
 
 
   
 ⌊
   
   ⌋                      (8) 
             
         
 
    
     
                         (9) 
    8) Uninterruptible operation of an energy phase:       To 
ensure the integrity and continuity of an energy phase, the 
following constraints should be satisfied: 
                          
       
                                       (10) 
             
       
     
                                 (11) 
                  
       
                                     (12) 
    9) Energy phase process time limits: Process time limits 
are enforced by the following constraint: 
                 ⌈
    
   ⌉  ∑
   
 
 
   
 ⌊
    
   ⌋                    (13) 
where   is the number of time slots in each hour,     is the 
nominal processing time for energy phase   in appliance   in 
minutes,   and   (              ) are the lower 
and upper processing time limits factor for energy phase   in 
appliance  .  
    10) Energy phase energy assignment requirement and 
bounds: Each energy phase uses a certain amount of energy 
    specified by the manufacturer: 
                            ∑
   
 
 
   
                                    (14) 
To ensure power safety, the total energy assigned in any 
time slot is not allowed to exceed the peak signal or in other 
words the total slot energy upper bound: 
                     ∑
∑
   
 
  
   
 
   
                              (15) 
The energy assignment in any time slot for each energy 
phase of each appliance should satisfy the following 
constraint:

                             (16) 
where,    
  and    
  are the lower and upper limits of power 
(not energy) assignment, respectively, to the corresponding 
energy phase. These limits are specified by the appliance 
manufacturer.  
    11) Basic decision variable constraints:  
                                 
                                     (17) 
                                  
  {   }                                  (18) 
                                      
  {   }                              (19) 
                           
  {   }                              (20) 
D. Cost function 
Finally, the following total cost function, which 
represents the weighted sum of the maximum objective 
deviation from each single goal, is specified:  
                                         ∑
    
   
   
                               (21) 
E. General formulation 
The general formulation of the proposed framework is 
summarized as follows:  
                                                  
Subject to:      Constraints (3)-(20) 
This is a MILP formulation transformed from the fuzzy 
goal programming formulation, and it can be solved using 
classical algorithms or heuristic search methods [4][5].

NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS 
All experiments were conducted on a desktop computer 
with an IntelR CoreTM 3.40GHz CPU and 16GB RAM. The 
optimization problem was solved using MATLAB interface 
of YALMIP and IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.5 solver 
[10][11][12].  
The 24-hour ahead hourly electricity price data of Nov. 
3rd, 2013, for Long Island of New York State used in this 
paper was taken from the NYISO [13]. From midnight to 
next midnight, these predicted pricing data in USD/MWh 
were 32.19, 27.63, 26.51, 24.6, 26.41, 22.57, 27.21, 28.6, 
31.45, 35.64, 36.35, 36.86, 36.87, 36.21, 34.82, 35.17, 41.37, 
57.86, 54.65, 55.44, 50.31, 45.73, 39.02, and 35.67. From 
these data it can be seen that the highest price (57.86) was 
2.56 times the lowest price (22.57).  
This study involved three controllable same smart home 
appliances including a dish washer, a washing machine, and 
a dryer, similar to those used by Sou et al. [4]. Three 
different lengths of time slot, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 
minutes, were investigated in the numerical experiments. 
The dishwasher is not supposed to be run during midnight to 
7 o’clock in the morning, and both the washing machine and 
dryer are not supposed to be run during midnight to 6 
o’clock in the morning. The parameter  , which is the  
penalty term for using user prohibited time, was set to 1.1. 
The dryer can only start working after the washing machine 
has finished, and the delay between them should be no more 
than 3 time slots. The parameters     in (8) for all phases is 
assumed to be 0, and     in (8) for the dishwasher, washing 
machine and dryer were set to 5, 10, and 0 minutes, 
respectively. The parameters   and   in (13) were set to 0.8 
and 1.2, respectively. The peak signals in (15) for 3-minute, 
5-minute, and 10-minute time slots are assumed to be 3300 
Wh, 5500 Wh, and 11000 Wh, respectively. The dishwasher, 
washing machine and dryer have 6, 8, and 1 energy phases, 
respectively. The parameter   in (3) was set to 0.5. The 
detailed technical specifications of the three appliances are 
shown in Table I through Table III. All of the rest of the 
parameter values can be found in these tables. Three 
representative user priority combinations               
for the objective function were selected for study, as is listed 
in Table IV. In reality, all the priority choices are made by 
the users and completely up to them with regard to their 
preferences.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 
A. Computational time 
Prematurely terminating the optimization process using 
the first feasible solution terminating condition can 
dramatically save computational time and at the same time 
have little influence on the final objective function value. 
Table V lists the relative extra time cost in using the default 
optimal solution terminating condition compared to using 
the first feasible solution terminating condition. Table VI 
shows the relative objective function error between the two 
terminating strategies. In view of this fact, our study 
adopted the first feasible terminating strategy in the 
remaining experiments.

B. Influence of time slot length on electricity cost 
The relative extra total electricity cost using the worst 
solution instead of the best solution is used to facilitate the 
investigation of the influence of time slot length on 
electricity cost, and the results are shown in Table VII. Here, 
the total electricity cost refers to the sum of the three single 
appliance energy cost objectives specified in (1). From 
Table VII, it can be seen that the worst-case total energy 
cost is approximately double that of the best case. The 
average relative extra energy cost for each time slot 
indicates no obvious cost savings between the 10-min time 
slot and the 5-min time slot, while the 3-min time slot can 
save significant money. This is because the smaller the time 
slot length, the more flexibility for appliances scheduling. 
However, the computation time for the 3-min time slot case 
is more than 3 times and 10 times that for the 5-min and 10-
min time slot case, respectively. This illustrates the tradeoff 
between time slot size and computational time.

C. Influence of objective priority choice on electricity cost 
The influence of the single objective priority choice 
made by the user can be seen from Table VII. Priority 
choice 3 (0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1) saves more money because of its 
very low user time preference priority and hence more 
prohibited time used. Using Choice 1 (0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3) and 
Choice 2 (0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5), similar results were produced. 
There are three reasons for this. First, the user time 
preference deviation objective    has great influence on the 
general fuzzy goal objective relative to appliance-related 
deviation objectives.  We observe that the average optimal 
value of the user time preference-related deviation objective 
is more than 10 times that any of the other single objective 
values. Although the use of the worst and best objective 
values in constructing the fuzzy objective dramatically 
resizes the fluctuation range to a range that is similar to that 
of the other objectives, the great difference still exists. 
Second, the user time preference objective priority level 0.3 
and 0.5 have almost the same effects on this single objective 
value. Third, only three appliances were involved in this 
study and two of them are closely related, resulting in small 
scheduling flexibility. Separately selecting and treating the 
user time preference objective priority levels can produce 
better effects.  
Illustrations of the price data (Fig. 1) used in this study 
and some typical energy assignment examples (Fig. 2 – Fig. 
4) are given below. All the energy assignment examples are 
based on the 10-min time slot. With the increase of the user 
time preference-related objective priority, the violation of 
the user prohibited time decreases, and eventually no 
prohibited time is used when this priority is very high.

D. Comparative discussion 
The 
research 
of 
applying 
adaptive 
fuzzy 
goal 
programming theory with priority considered to the area of 
optimal scheduling of smart home appliances is still quite 
new. Compared with the reported existing models, our 
model is more realistic and practical with the new developed 
between-appliance delay constraints, the soft user time 
preferences, and the priorities imposed on each single 
objective. In [4] and [14], only the plain MILP formulation 
was used to model the home appliance scheduling problem 
based on rigid user time preferences and without 
considering the priority of each appliance. A very simple 
household appliances scheduling formulation taking into 
account only  the peak hourly load constraints was proposed 
[15]. Samadi et al. [16] proposed a real-time residential load 
scheduling that took consideration of the load uncertainty, 
but quite different energy phase concepts such as sleep, 
awake, active, finished, etc., were used. A type of semi-soft 
user time preference constraints were proposed in home 
appliances scheduling [17], however, there are two 
limitations in this study: the user time preference constraint 
under each discrete sensitivity level was still a rigid one; no 
energy 
phase 
concepts 
were 
adopted 
for 
detailed 
investigation. Direct comparison of the energy saving 
between the proposed model and other models would be 
totally meaningless as each model was established based on 
quite different assumptions, objective, and constraints. In 
many cases, electricity cost is only part of the general 
objective.  
The proposed fuzzy goal programming model for home 
appliances scheduling does involve more variables and 
constraints than does a plain MILP model. The 
implementation time required for our model is 13% more on 
average than that for [3]. Since the proposed scheduling is 
supposed to make one day in advance and only a few 
minutes or even less than one minute is needed to finish the 
implementation, the extra time cost becomes marginal.

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The proposed mixed integer fuzzy goal programming 
model for adaptive scheduling of smart home appliances 
was shown to be effective in saving user’s total electricity 
cost. The user time preferences were transformed from rigid 
constraints to soft violation penalty objectives and 
integrated into the fuzzy goal programming formulation. 
Our optimization solution also allows users to give preferred 
priorities to different appliances objectives and the user time 
preference objective as well. The newly introduced 
constraints that restrict the delay between two closely 
related appliances make the proposed framework practical. 
More appliances with same or different type are to be 
included in the future research to further investigate the 
performance of the proposed method. The general 
conclusion of the study is that a closed-form optimization 
model is an effective approach for adaptation of home 
appliance schedules to changing prices of electrical power.  
Future work is to include more common and frequently-
used smart home appliances in the study to further test the 
validity of the proposed model.
