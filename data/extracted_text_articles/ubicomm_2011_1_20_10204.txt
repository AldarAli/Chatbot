Abstract—The efﬁcient broadcast of messages in Vehicular
Ad-hoc Network (VANET) still faces many challenges in
current research. In this paper, we are interested in multi-
hop broadcast communication for neighborhood discovery
applications which increase driver visibility. These applications
need to send information with a high rate causing congestion
in the network. To avoid this congestion, we propose a new
broadcasting scheme consisting in favoring the information
of the closest vehicles in a high vehicular density context.
Therefore, we introduce the concept of message energy, which
generalizes the typical time-to-live value. Our proposal is
evaluated and compared with several existing broadcasting
schemas using a network simulator. The results show an
improvement in neighbor discovery in a congestion context.

I. INTRODUCTION
Car-to-car communication systems are come very promis-
ing when it to enhancing security and safety during a
trip. There are plenty of types of services/applications that
can be built on top of a wireless device (from safety to
entertainment applications). In this paper, we are focusing
on broadcast-based applications. For instance, an application
can send the geographical position of its vehicle to the
neighborhood (Figure 1). For such applications, a routing
functionality is not required.
We are interested in multi-hop broadcast communica-
tion for neighborhood discovery applications which increase
driver visibility. When the vehicular density is high, we pro-
pose an auto-adaptive algorithm to compute the initial Time-
To-Live (TTL) and interval of message sending depending
on the local vehicular density.
This paper is structured as follows. First, we describe the
later development in broadcast schemes. Then, we introduce
our energy-based protocol. Finally, we compare our proposal
with those already existing.
II. RELATED WORK
Many projects study applications for Vehicular Ad-hoc
NETwork (VANET) [1]. Several applications need a broad-
casting efﬁciency protocol [2]. Our application is based on
this kind of protocol: the information on a vehicle (such as
position, speed, type) is broadcast at regular intervals to their
neighborhood in a geographical zone.
Flooding is the classical broadcast mechanism: each node
in the network retransmits the received messages. This is a
simple and easy method with a high delivery rate. However,
it may lead to a very serious problem, such as the increasing
of the bandwidth consumption and that may lead to high
collision rates.
Many mechanisms have been proposed to limit the chan-
nel congestion. The main mechanism consists in reducing
the number of relays [3]. Another proposal to limit channel
congestion is power adjustment. The study of [4] estimates
the local vehicle density to adjust the power transmission.
The optimal selection of relays has been described in most
works [3], [5], [6]. To reduce the number of relays, the
most popular method is the contention method with implicit
acknowledgments [7], [8]. On receiving a packet, there is a
contention delay for each node before forwarding the packet.
The node receiving the forwarded packet cancels its own
forwarding. Deﬁning the contention delay value is a hard
problem. First, the contention delay might be bounded by
a maximal value. Second, the contention delay is computed
from a random value, distance from a node (position of the
previous sender, source, or destination) or a mix of multiple
values.
A recent work [9] proposes a hybrid method between
random value and distance from the previous sender. Beyond

a distance threshold, contention delay is based on distance,
but random value is used for the other nodes nearest to the
sender. The aims of this work consist in reducing the delivery
delay of a message.
A congestion control is proposed in [10]. An abnormal
vehicle starts to transmit the Emergency Warning Messages
(EWM) at a high rate and the EWM transmission rate is
decreased over time until the minimum rate is reached.
In this paper, we propose a different approach. We would
favor the information from the nearest nodes by introduc-
ing a new TTL-like value: message energy. Messages are
initially sent at regular interval but with different initial
energy levels. When a node forwards a message, energy
decreases of at constant value. If the energy is inferior to a
value proportional to the local node density, the message is
dropped. Therefore, the average time between information
update depends on both the distance from the source and
the local density. A classic TTL does not have this property.
III. PROPOSED BROADCAST SCHEME
Our application consists in broadcasting the information
about a vehicle. This information is the payload of a message
whose header is described in Figure 2. Information type
depends on vehicular information and deﬁnes the payload
size, hop is the number of forwards for this message. Se-
quence number is a unique value. Lifetime is the information
life time. Node ID is the vehicular ID. Longitude, latitude,
elevation is the last forwarded node position.

Message header format
For our application, all the vehicles broadcast ﬁve kinds
of information: type (car, truck, motorbike, bike, etc.),
geographical position, speed, course and geolocation time.
Geolocation time is the time given by the geolocation
system. The format of this data is described in Figure 3
We note two occurences of the node position: one in the
header, another one in the vehicle information. In message
header, the geographical position is that of forwarder (relay
vehicle) and is necessary for the distance-based protocols.
Then, this position is updated at each hop. The position in

Vehicular information format
vehicular information is the position of the vehicle which
has initially sent the message. This position is not revised
during the broadcast.
A. Distance-based forwarding
Our proposed scheme is a distance-based forwarding.
On message reception, a vehicle starts a timer T inversely
proportional to the previous sender:
T = tmax ∗ (1 − d
R)
with tmax the maximum contention time, d the distance
from previous sender, R the radio range.
The main issue with the distance-based approach is the
duplication of forwarding. Indeed, the nodes close to the
optimal position forward the message together in a short
time. Thus, some duplications can occur, especially when
the density of vehicles is high.
B. Energy message
We add the energy ﬁeld in the message instead of the TTL
value. On message reception, the energy value decreases by
node weight:
En+1 = En − W
with En the energy at n-th hops and W the node weight.
This is already used with the classic TTL.
On message reception, a forwarding condition is added
according to the energy value. The energy should be greater
than a value according to local density. The higher the
density, the higher the energy should be in order to forward
the message. The following equation shows this condition
forwarding:
En > αNR
with NR the number of vehicles in a R range, α the
penalty factor. We can retrieve the TTL mechanism in a
classic protocol when α = 0.
The initial energy value might be set according to the
message range required. The higher the initial value, the
further the message goes away. In addition, the message
range depends on the local density: the energy of a message
should be high enough to cross the high density zone.

Figure 4.
The messages are sent at different times. Depending to road
density and distance from source, the average of update interval is different
for the vehicles.
We would broadcast vehicular information at regular in-
tervals to update this information for the neighborhood. But
we favor the nearest vehicular information. Then, in the case
of high density, the nearest vehicles can receive information
more often. Therefore, we propose to set different initial
energies depending on when the message is sent (Figure 4).
For instance, with the update interval set at 500 ms, at
t = 0 the initial energy E0 is set at 256, at t = 0.5,
E0 = 128, t = 1.0, E0 = 64, and t = 1.5, E0 = 32. At
t = 2.0, the initial energy goes back the maximal value
E0 = 256. Then, we deﬁne two values: E0max and E0min.
Here, E0max = 256 and E0min = 32.
C. Local density evaluation
We deﬁne local density as the number of vehicles in a
range R. Therefore, a vehicle computes the distance d from
the initial sender with the geographical position incorporated
into the message. Then, the density is the number of vehicles
with d < R.
We notice that estimating the local density as the number
of one-hop messages received by a vehicle is not a good
idea. Indeed, the density is not proportional to the number
of received messages due to the interferences proportional
with the number of nodes. Therefore, the local density is
computed from any received message without taking into
account the number of hops from the source.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the performances of our
proposed broadcast scheme. We compare our protocol to
several other protocols. In the following, we introduce the
used metrics, a detailed description of the other protocols,
the simulation details, and, ﬁnally, the results.
A. Used metrics
The main metric is the number of discovered vehicles
Nd. This value must be compared to the total number of
vehicles N in the network. Ideally Nd = N − 1, the
sender not being taken into account. The delivery delay is
the time between the message sending and its receipt. The
maximum contention time affects this delay. In high density,
the message queuing in the MAC layer affects it also.
Finally, the time between information update is the metric
to evaluate the wrong effect with our proposed protocol.
Indeed, some messages with lower energy do not reach
all the vehicles, increasing the time between information
update.
B. Other evaluated protocols
We compare our proposal with four other protocols:
(1) Flooding is the simplest protocol: all the new messages
received are forwarded.
(2) A simple distance based protocol (SDP), consists of a
contention delay proportional to the distance from the
previous sender as described in [9].
(3) A third class of protocol is random-based [11]. The
contention time is a random value between zero and
tmax: T = random(0, tmax).
(4) Finally, the protocol introduced in [9] is also evaluated.
We call it threshold. This is a hybrid method between
random-based and distance-based protocols to reduce
the delivery delay.
Tupper =

R)
where d > dth
tmax
where d ≤ dth
Tlower =
 0
where d > dth
tmax ∗ (1 − dth
R )
where d ≤ dth
T = random(Tlower, Tupper)
Where dth is the distance threshold constant.
C. Simulations details
We use the OPNET Modeler [12] network simulator
to evaluate the protocols. The OPNET modeler supports
some mobility models: random way-point, trajectory and
satellite. Trajectories are deﬁned as ﬁles containing node
positions at multiple times. No vehicular mobility model
exists for the OPNET Modeler. But we have developed
a framework [13] to use SUMO [14] with the OPNET
Modeler. SUMO generates vehicular positions in a trace ﬁle
and our framework converts this trace to trajectory ﬁles and
a project ﬁle for the OPNET Modeler. Thus, we can use a
realistic mobility scenario to evaluate the protocols.
Protocols are implemented in the routing layer above the
Medium Access Control (MAC) layer IEEE 802.11b. But
back-off contention delay can disrupt the contention delay
in the proposed protocols. Indeed, in high density, messages
are queued to wait for the medium access. To bypass this
problem, we set queuing size to one message. If the queuing
is full, the message is dropped, but a neighboring vehicle will
send the same message after its contention waiting time.
The scenario consists of a simple one-way road with three
lanes and a length of 15 km. The vehicles are initially
uniformly distributed on 10 km. We increase the density
by increasing the number of vehicles from 50 to 450. The
simulation duration is 10 s.
MAC layer bitrate is 11 Mbit/s, with message length at
544 bits. The real radio range is about 550 m. Thus, we
deﬁne R at 550 m as a parameter for our protocol.

The default tmax is 100 ms. The distance threshold dth
for threshold protocol is 170 m. For our proposed protocol,
the initial energy is ﬁxed as follows: E0max = 256 and
E0min = 32. Energy is divided by two for each new hello
message sent until En < E0min.
All parameters and there default values are summarized
in Table I.
D. Simuation results
1) Convergence time: To set simulation time for the next
evaluations, we want to know how long it takes the number
of discovered neighbors to reach a maximum, i.e., the
convergence time. This convergence time is the consequence
of our application which has a multi-hop aspect. No free
canal, error of transmit, or null energy in the message
involves message dropping. Thus, the vehicle must wait for
the next message to add the neighbor in his table.
Figure 5 shows a convergence time of about 5 seconds (ten
times the message sending interval) with 350 vehicles reach-
able. Between zero and 2 seconds, the number of discovered
neighbors increases linearly to reach about 275 vehicles.
We conclude that a simulation time of 10 s is adequate.

2) Ajust MAC buffer size: To avoid a wrong effect of
contention in IEEE 802.11b MAC layer, we evaluated a sim-
ple distance-based protocol with two buffer sizes: OPNET
default (256 kbits) and size of one message (544 bits). Thus,
either the canal is free and the message is transmitted, or the
canal is busy and the message is dropped.
We can see in Figure 6, with a buffer size at 256 kbit,
the maximum number of neighbors discovered is above 200.
But a buffer size corresponding to one message allows us
to discover more than 250 neighbors when the total number
of reachable vehicles is 300.
In addition, with a buffer size at 256 kbit, the delivery
delay explodes from 200 neighbors (Figure 7).
Limiting the buffer size implies that the message does
not wait in the MAC layer queue and the delay remains
constant when the network trafﬁc increases. The results in

Figure 9 conﬁrm this hypothesis. For the next simulation
results, the buffer size limit is one message, except for the
ﬂooding protocol.
3) Capacity evaluation: We would evaluate protocols
introduced in the above by varying the total number of
reachable vehicles on the road. Thus, we evaluate protocol
achievement in a high vehicular density context with and
without our broadcast scheme.
As expected, the maximum number of discovered neigh-
bors with ﬂooding protocol is low, about 120 and SDP
protocol improves considerably the number of discovered
neighbors (Figure 8). The random-based protocols (Random
and Threshold) allow us to limit the duplication of message
forwarding in high density context (more than 250 vehicles).
Thereby, the number of discovered neighbors is greater than
with SDP protocol.
Our proposal allow an increase of the number of dis-
coreved neighbors for three of the evaluated protocols.
Indeed, messages with low initial energy do not reach all
nodes and the number of forwarded messages is lower and
the network capacity is not reached with 450 vehicles. We
can see that the maximum number of discovered neighbors is
reached by the threshold protocol. In a trade-off, the update
interval of vehicle information is less for vehicles further
away (Figure 9).
In high density context, many messages are lost. That is
why the interval update information without our proposal
grows with the number of vehicles. Our proposal prevents
this message loss by reducing the number of messages sent
by the source.
Although message delivery delay is not the main preoc-
cupation for our VANET application, Figure 10 show this
result. Random-based schemes allow to reduce the delay as
described in [9]. The threshold protocol with our proposal
is the best in terms of delay. Thus, our improvement in the

4) Optimal penalty evaluation: Previouly, the penalty has
been set at the arbitrary value 1. An optimal penality value
could be determinate with a theorical model but this is part
of our future works.
The penalty value impacts on the neighborhood discovery.
Indeed, the higher the penalty, the lower the distance traveled
by the message with the same initial energy. But, if penalty is
too low, our proposal scheme does not improve performance.
Figure 11 conﬁrms this hypothesis. The number of vehi-
cles is set at 350. Between 1 and 3, the number of discovered
values is maximal.
To reﬁne this value, we observe the information update
interval in Figure 12. With a penalty value between 1 and 3,
the best information update interval is with 1 and 1.5 penalty
values. Then, a value equal to 1 for the penalty is correct.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
We have proposed a new broadcast scheme by adding
the concept of message energy. This energy value is a
generalization of the typical time-to-live value allowing us to
consider both distance from the source and the local density.
Therefore, this scheme favors the information of closest
vehicles, limits the number of forwarded messages and the
network congestion in a vehicular high density context.
These properties are adapted to VANET applications which
broadcast information (geographical position, speed, course,
type, etc.) to vehicles on the road. We have evaluated our
proposal with some other existing schemes and we improve
the threshold scheme proposed recently in a high vehicle
density context. Our future work will concern the develop-
ment of a model to compute the penalty optimal value and
initial energy values and improve neighbor discovery. We
want to go into more concerning detail message queuing
problems in the MAC layer.
