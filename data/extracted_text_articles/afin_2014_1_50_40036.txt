Abstract—In a sensor network, sensor data messages reach the
nearest stationary sink node connected to the Internet by wireless
multihop transmissions. Recently, various mobile sensors are
available due to advances of robotics technologies and com-
munication technologies. A location based message-by-message
routing protocol, such as Geographic Distance Routing (GEDIR)
is suitable for such mobile wireless networks; however, it is
required for each mobile wireless sensor node to know the current
locations of all its neighbor nodes. On the other hand, various in-
termittent communication methods for a low power consumption
requirement have been proposed for wireless sensor networks.
Intermittent Receiver-driven Data Transmission (IRDT) is one of
the most efﬁcient methods; however, it is difﬁcult to combine the
location based routing and the intermittent communication. In
order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a probabilistic
approach with the help of one of the solutions of the secretaries
problem. Here, each time a neighbor sensor node wakes up from
its sleep mode, an intermediate sensor node determines whether it
forwards its buffered sensor data messages to it or not based on an
estimation of achieved pseudo speed of the messages. Simulation
experiments show that the proposed probabilistic method achieves
shorter transmission delay than the two naive combinations of
IRDT and GEDIR in sensor networks with mobile sensor nodes
and a stationary sink node.

INTRODUCTION
A sensor network is anticipated to play an important role of
a fundamental infrastructure for Internet of Things (IoT) and
the big data support. A sensor network consists of multiple
wireless sensor nodes and a stationary sink node connected
to the Internet. Sensor data messages are transmitted along
a wireless multihop transmission route which is a sequence
of wireless sensor nodes to the sink node. Then, the sensor
data messages reach a dedicated server computer through the
Internet [1]. Since only limited battery capacity is available in
each sensor node, it is not reasonable for each sensor node to
transmit sensor data messages directly to the sink node. Hence,
each sensor node transmits sensor data messages to one of its
neighbor nodes within its wireless signal transmission range.
In order for the sensor data messages to reach the sink node,
intermediate sensor nodes forward the received sensor data
messages. For such wireless multihop transmissions, various
ad-hoc routing protocols have been proposed [9]. In most
of such routing protocols, it is assumed that all wireless
nodes are always active; i.e., the wireless nodes can send and
receive data messages anytime. However, in wireless sensor
networks, due to limitation of battery capacity and difﬁculty
for continuous power supply, low-power communication is
required. Especially, for support of mobile wireless sensor
networks, such as mobile robot networks with various sensors,
human centric sensor networks and vehicle-mounted sensor
networks for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), the low-
power consumption requirement is serious.
Intermittent communication technique is widely introduced
in sensor networks for reduction of power consumption. In
each wireless sensor node, its wireless communication module
should be active when it observes objects and creates sensor
data messages as a source sensor node and when it forwards
sensor data messages in transmission as an intermediate sensor
node. Otherwise, i.e., while the wireless sensor node is not
engaged in any sensor data transmissions, it gets in its sleep
mode to reduce its battery consumption for longer lifetime. In
order to realize the intermittent communication, it is difﬁcult
for each intermediate sensor node to synchronize with its
previous- and next-hop sensor nodes. In a source sensor node,
its wireless communication module is required to be active
only after the sensor node observes certain objects and achieves
its sensor data. Hence, it simply enters its active mode. On
the other hand, in an intermediate wireless sensor node, it is
required to be active before it receives sensor data messages
from one of its neighbor sensor nodes. Hence, it is difﬁcult
for the intermediate wireless node to determine when it gets
in its active mode.
Intermittent Receiver-driven Data Transmission (IRDT)
is an asynchronous intermittent communication protocol for
sensor networks [4]. In IRDT, an intermediate wireless sen-
sor node with sensor data messages in transmission waits
for its next-hop neighbor wireless sensor node to be active
without continuous transmissions of control messages which
is required in various Low Power Listening (LPL) [6] proto-
cols. Though it is a power-efﬁcient communication method,
it is difﬁcult for conventional ad-hoc routing protocols to
be applied since the protocols are designed to support only
wireless networks consisting of always-on stationary wireless
sensor nodes. In order to realize power-efﬁcient routing with
intermittent communication in wireless sensor networks, this
paper proposes IRDT-GEDIR under an assumption that a
location acquisition device, such as a GPS module is in each
sensor node. IRDT-GEDIR is a combination of IRDT and
a well-known location-based greedy ad-hoc routing protocol
Geographic Distance Routing (GEDIR) [8]. GEDIR is based
on the message-by-message routing, which is suitable for
various sensor networks where short sensor data messages are
usually transmitted and especially for dynamic sensor networks
whose topology is not stable due to mobility of sensor nodes

and their removal caused by battery consumption and failure.
An asynchronous intermittent communication reduces power
consumption; however, the transmission delay of sensor data
messages usually gets longer by synchronization overhead in
each intermediate sensor node with its previous- and next-
hop sensor nodes. In addition, for combination of IRDT and
GEDIR, location acquisition overhead for next-hop selection
is not negligible in mobile wireless sensor networks. In IRDT-
GEDIR, introduction of a novel probabilistic next-hop selec-
tion method reduces the transmission delay of data messages.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II shows the
related works for intemittent sensor data transmission proto-
cols. In Section III, we propose IRDT-GEDIR which combines
intermittent sensor data transmissions and a geographical ad-
hoc routing protocol. Section IV evaluates the performance of
IRDT-GEDIR. Section V concludes this paper and shows the
future works.

RELATED WORKS
Battery capacity in sensor nodes consisting of wireless
sensor networks is limited and usually there is no continuous
power supply to them. Hence, intermittent communication is
introduced where sensor nodes switch between their active and
sleep modes [11]. Their communication module works only
in the active modes. In order for sensor data messages to be
transmitted to the sink node along a wireless multihop trans-
mission route, each intermediate sensor node should be in the
active mode when its previous-hop node forwards a sensor data
message. Such intermittent communication methods are clas-
siﬁed into synchronous and asynchronous. In the synchronous
methods, all the sensor nodes are closely synchronized and
each sensor node transmits sensor data messages according
to a predetermined schedule as in Trafﬁc-Adaptive Medium
Access Protocol (TRAMA) [10] and Lightweight Medium
Access Protocol (LMAC) [5]. However, they are based on
the close synchronization among sensor nodes which requires
frequent exchange of control messages as the distributed clock
synchronization protocols [3]. Even though the required clock
synchronization overhead is acceptable, additional control
messages are required to be transmitted to update their sleep-
wakeup schedules consistently to follow the unstable network
topology due to the mobility of the wireless sensor nodes.
On the other hand, in the asynchronous methods, syn-
chronization among neighbor nodes is required only when a
sensor node forwards a sensor data message to its next-hop
sensor node. In LPL [6], when a sensor node requests to
transmit a sensor data message to its next-hop sensor node,
it continues transmissions of a preamble message during a
mode switching interval and all its neighbor nodes receiving
the preamble message should be in an active mode even if
they are not the next-hop sensor node as shown in Figure
1. In IRDT [4], a current-hop sensor node Nc waits for
receipt of a polling message from its next-hop sensor node
Nn as in Figure 2. Every sensor node switches between its
active and sleep modes in the same interval and broadcasts
a polling message with its ID each time when it changes its
mode active. Then, it waits for a transmission request message
Sreq from its previous-hop node in its active mode. If it
does not receive Sreq, it goes into its sleep mode. Otherwise,
i.e., if Nc receives a polling message from Nn which enters
its active mode and transmits Sreq to Nn with its ID, Nn
transmits an acknowledgement message Rack back to Nc and
a virtual connection is established between them. Then, data
messages are transmitted from Nc to Nn. Different from LPL,
a current-hop node Nc does not transmit a preamble message
continuously but only waits for receipt of a polling message
in IRDT. Therefore, low-overhead, i.e., low battery consuming
intermittent communication among wireless sensor nodes is
realized.

In [7], a wireless multihop routing protocol for IRDT-
based sensor networks has been proposed. It is a proactive
routing protocol where each sensor node keeps its routing
table for the shortest transmission route to a sink node up-to-
date. In order for the sensor nodes to determine their next-hop
neighbor sensor node, a ﬂooding of a control message initiated
by the sink node is applied. Though it works well in usual
ad-hoc networks consisting of always-on mobile nodes, it is
difﬁcult for sensor networks with intermittent communication
since a control message is not always received by all the
neighbor sensor nodes due to their sleep mode. Thus, the
control message is required to be retransmitted. Hence, in
the worst case, a sensor node unicasts the control message
to all its neighbor nodes one by one. In addition, in order
to support mobile wireless sensor networks, it is difﬁcult for
proactive routing protocols to keep the routing tables consistent
to the current network topology especially with the intermittent
communication among the mobile sensor nodes.

wireless sensor nodes, a novel routing protocol is required to be
developed. In order to reduce the communication overhead and
transmission delay for sensor data message transmissions with
intermittent communication, this paper proposes a combination
IRDT-GEDIR of IRDT and GEDIR [8] which is one of the
well-known location-based ad-hoc routing protocols with low
communication overhead for synchronization among sensor
nodes. GEDIR is a message-by-message based routing pro-
tocol. That is, an intermediate node determines its next-hop
node for each data message according to the most up-to-date
locations of itself, its neighbor nodes and the destination node.
Each sensor node with a GPS-like location acquisition device
broadcasts its current location information in a certain interval
and thus it achieves location information of its neighbor nodes.
The original GEDIR is designed for always-on wireless nodes
and the broadcasted location information is surely received
by all the neighbor nodes. Only the localized information,
i.e., location information of not all but only neighbor nodes,
is required to determine its next-hop node according to the
following method.
[Next-Hop Selection in GEDIR]
An intermediate wireless sensor node Nc selects one of its
neighbor sensor node Nn as its next-hop node where the
distance dn = |NnS| to the sink node S is the shortest among
all its neighbor sensor nodes as shown in Figure 3. 2
Nc

Figure 3. GEDIR Overview.
In IRDT, each sensor node transmits a polling message
each time it enters its active mode. Thus, by piggybacking
its location information to the polling message as in Figure
4, its location information is broadcasted without additional
communication overhead and notiﬁed to its possible previous-
hop nodes. However, the polling message is not surely received
by all its neighbor sensor nodes since they might be in their
sleep mode where their network interfaces do not work. If the
sensor nodes are stationary, a neighbor node which receives the
polling message by chance holds the location information and
uses it for its next-hop determination. However, in a mobile
sensor network, the achieved location information gets stale
and the most up-to-date location information is required for
the next-hop selection.
An intermediate sensor node Nc requires location infor-
mation of its neighbor nodes only when it has a sensor data
message to be transmitted to the sink node through its next-
hop sensor node. Thus, in our proposal, based on the location
information piggybacked to the received polling messages, Nc
determines its next-hop sensor node. Here, since a neighbor
sensor node N waits for receiving an Sreq message only for a

predetermined interval after transmission of a polling message
from N, Nc should determine during this interval whether it
selects N as its next-hop node or not.
In order to solve this problem, according to a certain
criterion, Nc evaluates N and compares the evaluation result
and an expected evaluation where one of the later activating
neighbor sensor nodes are selected as its next-hop node. In
GEDIR, the distance to the destination sink node is applied as
the criterion for selection of its next-hop node for achieving
shorter transmission route to the sink node. On the other hand
in IRDT-GEDIR, since wireless sensor nodes communicate
intermittently, forwarding to the neighbor sensor node nearest
to the destination sink node does not always reduce the
transmission delay. Even when a sensor node N is not the
nearest to the sink node, shorter transmission delay might be
achieved by forwarding it to N being active currently. Thus,
this paper introduces a novel criterion pseudo speed of sensor
data message transmission which is achieved by division of
difference of distance to the sink node S, i.e., |NcS|−|NS|, by
the time duration between the transmission request and receipt
of the polling message as shown in Figure 5. It is a reasonable
criterion for selection of a next-hop sensor node in intermittent
communication environments for shorter transmission delay to
the sink node.

sensor node Nc should determine whether it selects a neighbor
sensor node N as its next-hop node soon after it receives a
polling message from N since Nc should transmits an Sreq
message to N while N is in its active mode. That is, Nc cannot
compare all pseudo speed sv i each of which is achieved in
case that Nc forwards a sensor data message to a neighbor
node Ni since each sv i is only achieved when Ni wakes
up and broadcasts its polling message containing its current
location information. This is almost the same setting as in the
secretaries problem [2].
The secretaries problem is one of the famous problems of
the optimal stopping theory. It has been studied extensively in
the ﬁelds of applied probability, statistics and decision theory.
The basic form of the problem is as follows:
• An administrator is willing to hire the best secretary out
of n rankable candidates.
• The candidates are interviewed one by one in an random
order.
• A decision about each particular candidate is to be taken
immediately after the interview.
• Once rejected, a candidate cannot be recalled.
• During the interview, the administrator can rank the can-
didate among all candidates interviewed so far; however,
it cannot rank the candidate among unseen forthcoming
candidates.
• The problem is about the optimal strategy to maximize
the expectation of the rank of the selected candidate.
In our next-hop selection, neighbor nodes get active one by one
and an intermediate sensor node with sensor data messages in
transmission can evaluate the pseudo speed of data messages to
them at that time. It should immediately determine whether it
selects the currently active neighbor node as its next-hop node
or not even though it cannot evaluate the pseudo speed of data
messages to the forthcoming active neighbor nodes. Thus, the
solution of our next-hop selection problem is expected to be
achieved based on the secretaries problem.
Nc evaluates the pseudo speed sv where it forwards a
sensor data message to N from which Nc receives a polling
message and the expected pseudo speed sv where it forwards
it not to N but to one of the later activating sensor nodes. If
sv > sv, Nc transmits an Sreq message to N; i.e., it selects
N as its next-hop node. Otherwise, i.e., sv < sv, Nc does not
transmit an Sreq.
B. Expectation of Pseudo Speed
In the proposed method in the previous subsection, an
intermediate sensor node determines whether it forwards a
sensor data message to a currently active neighbor sensor
node from which it receives a polling message by comparison
of pseudo speed of transmission of a data message. For the
comparison, this subsection discusses the method to evaluate
the expected pseudo speed of transmission of a data message in
case that the intermediate node forwards the message not to the
currently active neighbor node but to one of the later activating
nodes. Here, let T be the constant interval of activations in
sensor nodes, i.e., the interval of consecutive transmissions
of polling messages and n be the number of neighbor sensor
nodes of an intermediate sensor node Nc with a sensor data
message in transmission.
First, we investigate the distribution of distances |NS| from
neighbor nodes N of Nc to the destination sink node S. As
shown in Figure 6, let r, dc and d be a wireless transmission
range of Nc, the distance from Nc to S (dc > r) and the
distance from N to S (dc − r ≤ d ≤ dc + r). Under an
assumption that sensor nodes are distributed with the same
density, the probability DP(d) where the distance |NS| is
shorter than d is as follows:

Next, we examine the distribution of time duration from
the transmission request of a sensor data message in Nc to the
receipt of a polling message from N. Here, the transmission is
29

supposed to be requested at t = 0. Let ti be the time when the
ith polling message is transmitted from one of the neighbor
nodes of Nc. Thus, i−1 neighbor sensor nodes transmit polling
messages in an interval [0, ti) and the rest n − i neighbor
sensor nodes transmit polling messages in an interval (ti, T ).
Under an assumption that the transmission time t of the polling
messages from the n− i neighbor sensor nodes are distributed
in the interval (ti, T ) according to the unique distribution, the
probability density function pp(i, j, t) where jth (i < j ≤ n)
polling message is transmitted from one of the neighbor sensor
nodes of Nc at time t ∈ (ti, T ) is as follows:

(4)
Since the location of a neighbor sensor node and the time
when it transmits a polling message are independent each
other, the probability density function g(i, j, t, l) where Nc
transmits a sensor data message to a neighbor sensor node N
which transmits the jth (i < j ≤ n) polling message at time
t (ti < t < T ) and the distance to the sink node S is reduced
l by this forwarding is induced by (3) and (4) as follows:
g(i, j, t, l) = pp(i, j, t) · p(l)
(5)
Here, the pseudo speed sv of transmissions of sensor data
messages is l/t.
In case that Nc does not select a neighbor sensor node
which transmits the ith polling message at ti as its next-hop
node, Nc selects another sensor node which transmits the jth
(i < j ≤ n) polling message at tj (ti < tj < T ) or a sensor
node transmitting its second polling message after t = T .
In the latter case, kth (1 ≤ k ≤ i) polling messages are
transmitted at tk (0 ≤ tk ≤ ti) and the distance reduction
by forwarding to the neighbor node is lk. Thus, the pseudo
speed achieved by forwarding on receipt of the second polling
message is svk = lk/(tk + T ). Since Nc has already achieved
both tk and lk (1 ≤ k ≤ i), the expected pseudo speed where
Nc forwards a sensor data message at t ≥ T is as follows:
svn = max
1≤k≤i svk = max
1≤k≤i
lk
tk + T
(6)
This is an expected pseudo speed in case that Nc does not for-
ward a sensor data message to a neighbor node transmitting the
nth polling message. Based on (6), we evaluate the expected
pseudo speed svj when Nc does not forward a sensor data
message to a neighbor node transmitting the jth (i ≤ j ≤ n)
polling message.
In case of j = n, p(l) and pp(i, n, tn) are deﬁned in an
area (−r ≤ l ≤ r and ti < tn < T ) as shown in Figure 7
and g(i, n, tn, l)=pp(i, n, tn) · p(l). Here, the area is divided
into S and S′ by a line l=svntn. In S, since the pseudo speed
l/tn is higher than svn, Nc forwards a sensor data message
to a neighbor node transmitting the nth polling message. On
the other hand, since the pseudo speed l/tn is lower than
svn in S′, Nc forwards a sensor data message to the node
transmitting not nth but kth polling message which gives the
maximum lk/(tk + T ) in (6). Therefore, svn−1 is evaluated
by the following formula:

Generally, the expected pseudo speed when Nc does not
forward a sensor data message to a neighbor node transmitting
the jth (i ≤ j < n) polling message is also evaluated as in the
same way. That is, the area (−r ≤ l ≤ r and ti < tj+1 < T )
in which g(i, j +1, tj+1, l) is deﬁned is divided into sub-areas

the pseudo speed l/tj+1 is higher than svj+1, Nc forwards
a sensor data message to a neighbor node transmitting the
j + 1th polling message. On the other hand, since the pseudo
speed l/tj+1 is lower than svj+1 in S′, Nc forwards a sensor
data message to the transmitting node of not j + 1th polling
message but a later transmitted polling message. Therefore,
svj is evaluated by the following formula:

According to (6) and (8), Nc calculates svi. Thus, if
a neighbor sensor node N which is li nearer to the sink
node S than Nc transmits the ith polling message at time ti,
Nc determines whether it selects N as its next-hop node as
follows:
• If li/ti ≥ svi, Nc forwards a sensor data message to N.
• Otherwise, i.e., if li/ti < svi, Nc does not forward a
sensor data message to N.
In our proposed protocol, only ID and location information
of mobile sensor nodes are piggybacked. In a wireless sensor
network with stationary sensor nodes, it is enough for precisely
estimate the pseudo speed of its neighbor nodes. However, in a
mobile wireless sensor network, since no mobility information
is piggybacked, it is impossible for an intermediate node to
estimate future locations of its neighbor nodes. Thus, it may
possible that the achieved locations are changed when the next
polling messages are transmitted. That is, lk might be changed
and in the worst case the neighbor node goes out of the wireless
transmission range of the intermediate node when it transmits
the next polling message. The effect is later discussed in the
performance evaluation and the conclusion sections.
IV.
EVALUATION
First, we evaluate the 1-hop transmission performance
achieved by the proposed IRDT-GEDIR next-hop selection
method. Here, pseudo speed is evaluated in IRDT-GEDIR and
two conventional naive methods. A wireless transmission range
of a wireless sensor node is assumed 10m and the distance
from an intermediate node Nc currently holding a sensor data
message to the sink node is 100m. 5–20 neighbor sensor nodes
are randomly distributed in a wireless signal transmission
range according to the unique distribution randomness. All
sensor nodes are assumed stationary. The interval of activations
in each sensor node is 1s and the initial activation time
is also randomly determined. The proposed IRDT-GEDIR is
compared with the following two conventional methods and
an unrealistic locally optimum method;
• Nc forwards a sensor data message to the neighbor
node which transmits the ﬁrst polling message after the
transmission request in Nc. (Greedy Conventional)
• Nc forwards a sensor data message to the neighbor node
which provides the highest pseudo speed determined after
receiving polling messages from all the neighbor nodes
of Nc. (Conservative Conventional)
• Nc forwards a sensor data message to the neighbor node
which provides the highest pseudo speed determined by
the information of locations and activation times in all the
neighbor nodes. (Locally Optimum)
Locally Optimum is evaluated only for comparison since it
is impossible for Nc to achieve location information of its
neighbor nodes without any overhead. If Nc is a dead-end
node which cannot select its next-hop node, the pseudo speed
is evaluated as 0m/s.
Figures 9–12 show the results of simulation experiments.
Here, the value of the distribution function f(sv) = p(sv′ <
sv) of probability where pseudo speed sv′ is lower than sv.
In all the results, higher pseudo speed is achieved in the order
IRDT-GEDIR, Greedy Conventional and Conservative Con-
ventional. Locally Optimum provides the ideal pseudo speed,
since Nc achieves all the required information to determine its
next-hop node in advance. The performance of Conservative
Conventional is low since the overhead to receive all the
polling messages is too high. Though the performance of
Greedy Conventional and IRDT-GEDIR is almost the same in
low density environments, higher pseudo speed is achieved by
IRDT-GEDIR in more dense environments. In IRDT-GEDIR,
no additional control messages are required to determine its
next-hop nodes as discussed in the previous section. Therefore,
IRDT-GEDIR is expected to realizes low-power shorter-delay
transmissions of sensor data messages in intermittent wireless
sensor networks.

Next, we evaluate the multihop transmission performance

square simulation ﬁeld, 1,000 mobile wireless sensor nodes
with 10m wireless signal transmission range are randomly
distributed according to the unique distribution randomness. It
is assumed that the interval of activations in each sensor node
is 1.0s, communication overhead for 1-hop transmission is 0.1s
and the activation time offset is also randomly determined
in each sensor node according to the unique distribution
in [0s, 1s). The speed of mobile wireless nodes is 0.1–
2.0m/s and their mobility is according to the Random-Way-
Point model. A location of a stationary sink node is also
randomly determined, which is assumed to be advertised to
all the mobile sensor nodes in advance. In IRDT-GEDIR, for

calculation of expectation of pseudo speed, the number of
neighbor nodes n is needed; however, it is difﬁcult for an
intermediate sensor nodes to determine n in an intermittent
communication environment. Hence, the average number of
mobile sensor nodes in its wireless transmission range is
applied as n in the simulation experiments. Thus, in this
experiment, n = 1, 000 ÷ (100 × 100) × (10 × 10 × π) = 31.
End-to-end transmission delay and hop counts of a sensor data
message is evaluated in IRDT-GEDIR, Greedy Conventional,
Conservative Conventional and Locally Optimum. Figures 13–
17 and Figures 18–22 show the simulation results of 1,000
trials of end-to-end transmission delay and hop counts, respec-
tively. The x-axis represents distances between a source mobile
sensor node and the stationary sink node when the multihop
transmission is initiated.
Though an intermediate sensor node transmits a sensor
data message soon after it receives a polling message from
one of its neighbor sensor nodes in Greedy Conventional
and Locally Optimum. However, it determines its next-hop
sensor node after receipt of all the polling message always in
Conservative Conventional and sometimes in IRDT-GEDIR.
In such cases, due to the interval between the receipt of the
polling message and the transmission of a sensor data message
and mobility of the sensor nodes, it may fail to forward the
sensor data message if the neighbor node moves out of the
wireless transmission range. In our simulation results, only
Conservative Conventional fails to forward as shown in Table
1. Thus, it is not suitable especially for high speed mobility.

As shown in Figures 13–22, independently of the mobility
speed of wireless sensor nodes, all the simulation results,
i.e., both end-to-end transmission delay and hop counts are
proportional to the distance between a source sensor node to
the destination sink node. The order of transmission delay is
Locally Optimum, IRDT-GEDIR, Greedy Conventional and
Conservative Conventional and the order of hop counts is
Conservative Conventional, Locally Optimum, IRDT-GEDIR
and Greedy Conventional. Though Conservative Conventional
achieves the smallest hop counts, which means the lowest
power consumption transmissions are realized, it requires too
long transmission delay and suffers too high transmission
failure ratio. The relation among Locally Optimum, IRDT-
GEDIR and Greedy Conventional is almost the same in all the
results. In IRDT-GEDIR and Greedy Conventional, 18.56%
and 23.06% additional transmission delay and 21.70% and
35.64% additional hop counts are required to those of Locally
Optimum. Hence, IRDT-GEDIR achieves improvement in both
power consumption and end-to-end transmission delay.

CONCLUSION
This paper proposes IRDT-GEDIR which is combination of
IRDT intermittent communication protocol with lower power
consumption and GEDIR location-based message-by-message
ad-hoc routing protocol. In intermittent communication, it
is difﬁcult for an intermediate node to select its next-hop
node due to difﬁculty to achieve location and activation time
information from neighbor nodes. By introduction of a solution
of the secretaries problem and a pseudo speed criterion,
a novel next-hop selection method is induced. The 1-hop
simulation experiments in a stationary sensor network show
that the proposed method achieves better next-hop selection
with higher pseudo speed. In addition, the wireless multihop
transmission experiments in a mobile sensor network show that
it is expected for IRDT-GEDIR to achieve shorter end-to-end
transmission delay and smaller hop counts of sensor data mes-
sages even with the sleep mode in intermediate sensor nodes
due to the intermittent communication. Here, no forwarding
failure occurs even without mobility information of neighbor
nodes. Therefore, IRDT-GEDIR improves the performance of
mobile sensor networks.
In this paper, all the mobile sensor nodes assume to
have the same activation interval. However, it is required for
mobile sensor nodes to have different activation intervals, e.g.,
depending on the battery capacity. In our future work, the next-
hop selection method is extended to support variation of the
activation interval in sensor nodes.
