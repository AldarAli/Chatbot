Abstract—Tracking

of

for 
assessing 
decontamination and sterilization quality is of utmost 
importance in medical and other clean environments. 
However, classical tests for spore contamination rely on 
bacterial growth, which is slow. Rather than monitoring 
bacterial growth, one can detect the spore germination process. 
Here, we present our method for reliable testing for spore 
germination by fluorescence detection of the associated DPA 
release. Extrapolating our results, we estimate that single spore 
detection will be possible with our method.

 INTRODUCTION 
Tracking viability of spores for assessing disinfection and 
sterilization quality is of uttermost importance in medical 
and other clean environments. Biological indicators, or spore 
tests, are the most accepted means to assess the sterilization 
process. They directly control the sterilization by exposing 
known highly resistant microorganisms and then controlling 
for residual bacterial growth, which is a slow process 
extending over several days [1].  
Rather than monitoring bacterial growth, one could 
detect the germination process. We are developing a method 
for reliable testing for spore germination. During spore 
germination, dipicolinic acid (DPA) is released [2], which 
can be monitored by adding Tb3+-ions to the solution and 
monitoring the fluorescence [3]. 
Here, we present details on our specific approach and 
first experimental results. Extrapolating our results to 
microfluidic systems, we estimate that single spore detection 
will be possible. In Section II the experiment is described 
and in Section III the results are presented and discussed. 
 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
The measurement consists in the determination of the 
fluorescence from a Tb3+ complex formed with DPA. 
Terbium (Tb3+) is chosen as it forms a complex with high 
fluorescence quantum yield [4]. 
For the investigated use case, we developed a laboratory 
setup based on time-resolved fluorescence collection as 
schematically shown in the inset of Figure 1. Briefly, UV 
pulses at 266 nm with a repetition rate of 18 Hz were used to 
excite the sample. The emitted fluorescence was collected 
orthogonally to the excitation by a large numerical aperture 
lens and refocused onto a Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) 
with a 3x3 mm2 active area (Ketek, PM3315-WB). No 
spectral filter was used in the detection path, to maximize the 
fluorescence collection. Instead, the signal was temporally 
resolved, which allows to filter out short-lived contributions 
from autofluorescence or scattered light.  
Figure 1. shows fluorescence measurements for different 
concentrations of DPA. Signals start to saturate at ~500 nM. 
Concentrations below 50 nM can still be well quantified. 
These curves were used for calibration, in order to estimate 
DPA concentrations in the samples. 
From different tests, the best conditions had to be 
determined, in order to provide favorable biochemical 
conditions for spore germination, which, on the other hand 
do not interfere with the fluorescence measurements. The 
indicator 
spores 
we 
used 
were 
Geobacillus 
stearothermophilus obtained from Merck. 
The best results were achieved using 10 mM Trizma 
buffer, in part because its pH can be tuned to the value of 
8.0, a commonly accepted optimum for the germination of 
spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus.

Geobacillus stearothermophilus typically requires a 
relatively complex nutrient mixture for efficient growth [5]. 
Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the early steps in the 
transition from a spore to a vegetative cell can be induced in 
simple media containing organic acids [6]. Here, incubation

was conducted in a solution containing 1 mM L-valine 
solution at 65°C. Sterilization was done by exposure of the 
spore-samples to H2O2 over 45 minutes.

A spore solution (Bacillus stearothermophilus, Merck) 
was centrifuged, in order to remove residual DPA in the 
solution and then deposited on a substrate, which was 
exposed to H2O2 vapor for approximately one hour for 
sterilization. Subsequently the sample was dissolved in 
buffer solution (Tris, pH=8) and L-Valin was added to 
support germination. Germination was triggered by heating 
to 65°C and samples were taken after 30, 90, and 120 
minutes of incubation. Flourescence decays were measured 
after adding TbCl3.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Results showing the kinetics of germination are 
summarized in Figure 3. Spore solutions with 107, 106 and 
105 CFT/ml were prepared and centrifuged for removing 
DPA from the solution. Germination was initiated by adding 
L-valine and heating to 65°C. Samples were taken at 0, 30, 
90, and 120 minutes.

Figure 3.  DPA-concentration measured on the germination samples. 
Sampling times are indicated in the inset. Concentrations of the original 
spore solutions were 107, 106, 105 CFT/ml for sample-series A, B, C, 
respectively. (Concentrations were estimated by comparing the measured 
fluorescence decays with calibrated samples like in Figure 1) 
Estimating an average DPA content of 2.3 108 molecules 
per spore and assuming a fraction of 3% of DPA released by 
the spores [6], we estimate the concentration of DPA after 
germination of the spore suspension above (106 CFU/ml) of 
about 11 nM. Indeed, the jump in DPA concentration from 
germination can easily be measured and it is in the range of 
expected signal.  
Extrapolating to the single spore regime, we would 
obtain a similar DPA concentration by confining the volume 
to the nanoliter. One spore confined to a single nl, would 
release a DPA amount of 12 attomol corresponding to an 
effective concentration of 11 nM within the small volume. 
Thus, single spore measurements are attainable in a 
microfluidic environement, where the spore and laser light 
are confined to a volume of 1 nanolitre, corresponding to 
channel dimensions in the order of 100 µm. This should be 
achievable in a micro-fluidic set-up combined with 
microscopic fluorescence detection. Further experiments will 
be necessary to get a better estimate about repeatability and 
measurement errors. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Overall, we present first results from our approach of a 
rapid assay for spore germination detection, which can be 
used for sterilization validation. Using an optimized 
combination of germination conditions and a highly sensitive 
time-resolved fluorescence detection set-up based on pulsed 
laser excitation, we could determine the DPA, which is 
released during germination with nM sensitivity under 
realistic conditions.  
We also estimated that single spore detection could be 
realistic, however, in order to reach sensitivities approaching 
the single spore regime, a microfluidic environment would 
be necessary.
