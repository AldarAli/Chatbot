Abstract— In order to enable the coexistence of an ever-
increasing number of communication systems in a 
limited amount of frequency, the traditional static 
frequency allocation is not the best solution any longer. 
Cognitive Radio (CR) technology, based on a dynamic 
spectrum access, is a possible solution for improving the 
efficiency of spectrum usage. A first step in order to 
identify the frequency bands that are more suitable for 
opportunistic usage is to evaluate the degree in which 
licensed bands are currently used. Although some 
measurement campaigns have already been carried out, 
most of them were done in urban environments and only 
a few in other locations. This paper presents results of 
two measurement campaigns conducted in Romania 
both in urban and rural environments, covering the 
frequency range from 25 MHz up to 3.4 GHz. The 
results are confronted with the frequency allocation 
table published by the national authority for radio 
communications and a comparison and analysis of the 
obtained data are being made.

 INTRODUCTION 
During the last decades, the demand for more radio 
spectrum increased with the development of wireless 
communications. With the deployment of more wireless 
communications systems, most of the available spectrum 
has been statically allocated. Therefore, many countries are 
facing the problem of spectrum insufficiency. Nevertheless, 
measurement studies have revealed that most of the 
allocated spectrum experiences low utilization efficiency. 
These two facts motivate the introduction of dynamic 
spectrum access, which allows secondary users to 
reuse/share the same radio spectrum originally allocated to 
the primary (licensed) users.  
Cognitive radio (CR) technology is the key technology 
that enables a system to use spectrum in a dynamic manner. 
The CR term was coined by J. Mitola III in [1], defining a 
wireless communication system that allows spectrum sharing 
over a wide frequency range and that is able to handle 
multiple radio access technologies. In order to avoid any 
interference to the primary system, the CR equipment should 
include the following functionalities: frequency-agility and 
re-configuration of radios, spectrum sensing, and spectrum 
management.  
Prior to developing standards for CR applications, there 
is a need for a thorough investigation of potential spectral 
regions to be used. Therefore, it is important to gather 
spectral investigation results from as many as possible 
different geographical regions and scenarios. These results 
will facilitate the CR standards development, to make the CR 
devices work under several circumstances, with different 
spectral regulations. 
Several measurement campaigns concerning spectrum 
occupancy were conducted worldwide [2]-[10], most of them 
were carried out the in the USA [2]-[3] and only a few in 
other locations worldwide, 
including Singapore [5], 
Germany [6], New Zeeland [7], Spain [8] and Italy [9], in 
urban or suburban scenarios. Results of a measurement 
campaign conducted in Chicago, USA showed a mean 
occupancy as low as 17.4% in the frequency band 30 to 3000 
MHz [2]. Studies were also targeted at narrower frequency 
bands, like the public safety ones, and the benefits of 
cooperative sensing were highlighted [3]. The difference 
between indoor and outdoor locations was discussed in [5] 
based on measurements performed in Aachen, Germany. The 
study in [9], based on measurements performed in Spain and 
Italy, focuses on determining the hidden noise margin in 
order to find out if cognitive devices are able to detect and 
distinguish between empty and occupied TV channels. 
Recently, after a thorough investigation of real radio 
communications systems, accurate statistical models for the 
time-domain spectral occupancy were proposed in [10].  
 The paper is organized as follows. Section II contains a 
description of the equipments used to perform our 
measurements. The methodology and the obtained results of 
the measurements are presented in Section III. In Section IV, 
the measurement results are analyzed from a CR perspective. 
Finally, in Section V, the conclusions are drawn and future 
work aspects are presented.

MEASUREMENT LOCATION, SETUP AND EQUIPMENT 
The measurements for an urban environment were 
performed in Bucharest from the top of the main building of

our Department (GPS location: latitude 44°26'01" N, 
longitude 26°03'27" E, MSL altitude 150 m, relative altitude 
30 m). The location is excellent for such a measurement 
campaign, having direct line of sight with several FM 
transmitters, Analog and DVB-T TV transmitters, GSM and 
UMTS base stations and several other stations The 
headquarters of the governmental agency for special 
telecommunications is also located just a few hundreds of 
meters away from the measurement location.  
The small village of Maneciu (GPS location: latitude 
45°18'49" N, longitude 25°59'38" E, MSL altitude 584 m, 
relative altitude 10 m) was chosen for the measurements in a 
rural environment. The village is located in a hilly region 
approximately 100 km away from Bucharest and at least 40 
km away from any other big city. A map of the southeastern 
part of Romania, having highlighted the measurement 
locations is given in Figure 1. 
The antenna used for collecting the measurement data is 
a wideband discone antenna (Sirio SD3000N), mounted on 
the building terrace. The antenna has an omnidirectional 
pattern in the horizontal plane and was connected using a 
low-loss RF cable to a high performance signal analyzer 
(Anritsu MS2690A - 50 Hz to 6 GHz). Images showing the 
equipment that was used during the measurement campaigns 
can be found in [11].       
The measurements covered the frequency range from 25 
MHz to 3400 MHz, the whole band being divided into 14 
sub-bands according to the type of service and the 
bandwidth of the allocated signal.  
The measurement data was collected from the spectrum 
analyzer using a remote mode, the necessary commands 
were generated using a notebook connected through the 
network interface. Data was acquired for each of the 14 
spectrum sub-bands at intervals of around 70 seconds, 
resulting more than 1000 samples for each of the sub-bands 
for each day.  
A list containing values of the parameters used to 
configure the equipment in order to perform the 
measurements is given in Table I.

MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
Several sensing methods can be used in order to decide if 
a certain frequency band is available for opportunistic 
access: energy detection, matched filtering, cyclostationary 
feature detection, eigenvalue detection, wavelet detection 
[12]-[15]. In order to evaluate the spectral occupancy in the 
several frequency bands presented in Table I using the data 
collected during the measurement campaigns we chose the 
energy detection method. 
The energy detection method provides an optimal 
detection in cases where the primary user signal is 
unknown, as it does not require any a priori knowledge 
about it. Some other advantages offered by this method are 
low computational costs and a short necessary sensing time. 
The main drawbacks of this method are that the results 
obtained are highly susceptible to changes in the 
background noise and interference level and that it cannot 
distinguish primary users from secondary ones. However, 
research has been done, like the one described in [12] in 
order to improve the detection performance of such a 
method by dynamically adjusting the threshold value.  
One of the main challenges when using the method is a 
proper selection of the energy threshold. If the value used 
for the threshold is too high, weak signals will be treated as 
noise and this would result in an underestimation of the 
actual occupancy. On the other hand, choosing a too low 
value for the threshold will increase the false alarm 
probability caused by high-power noise samples and this 
would cause an overestimation of the actual occupancy.  
In order to estimate the noise level, several methods are 
available. Although the most simple one would imply a 
measurement using a matched load (of 50 Ω in case of our 
configuration) instead of the measurement antenna, this 
would imply that the evaluation of the noise level would be 
made at a different moment of time from the one when the 
measurements are being made. In this case, the accuracy of 
the measurement would not be acceptable, and moreover the 
values obtained could not be dynamically adjusted to reflect 
possible changes in the radio environment. To overcome 
these disadvantages we determined the noise level using a 
sliding window in the frequency domain, having an adaptive 
width. An algorithm was used to determine the most wide 
frequency interval without any active signal for each of the 
14 frequency bands described in Table I, and a mean of the 
values for this interval would indicate the current noise level 
for the corresponding band.  
To mitigate the effects of high-power noise samples in 
order to decrease the false alarm probability, a second sliding 
window with a calculated width of 100 kHz was used in 
order to mean out such samples. 
In Table II, an example calculation was made for the 470 
to 766 MHz frequency band by choosing several different 
values for the false alarm probability.

The threshold value was chosen in order to respect a 
chosen false alarm probability of 10% for all the frequency 
bands that were considered during the measurement 
campaigns. As expected, when the value chosen for the false 
alarm probability is increased, the value of the necessary 
threshold will decrease. As a result, the measured spectral 
occupancy will have higher values, as signals having levels 
close to the noise level will be taken into account.  
As it can be noticed, having a 19 % variation in the false 
alarm probability implies also almost a 15% variation in the 
determined occupancy. The value of 10% for the false alarm 
probability was highlighted, as it is the value that was used 
during the measurement campaigns.  
Table III contains the measured spectrum occupancies for 
both the urban and rural environments for the 25 MHz to 3.4 
GHz frequency band. The listed results were obtained by 
using a value of 10% for the false alarm probability for the 
threshold for each of the 14 different frequency sub-bands.  
Occupancy results were calculated for both the urban and 
the rural areas using data collected over intervals of 48  
hours, one working day and one week-end day. 
 
IV. 
MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS 
Figures 2 and 3 contain spectrum occupancy results for 
some of the 14 frequency sub-bands analyzed during the 
urban environment measurement campaign. In case of sub-
band 470-766 MHz (Figure 2) different metrics are used in 
order to express the degree of spectral occupancy. A first 
sub-figure contains the maximum, minimum and mean 
power spectral density value for an 8-hour observation 
interval. In a second sub-figure the occupancy duty cycle is 
represented, expressing the amount of time (in %) in with 
each of the frequencies from the respective frequency band 
was occupied or not. A third sub-figure is a histogram 
showing a map of the instantaneous spectral occupancy for 
the whole 8-hour interval. In case of Figure 4 the maximum, 
minimum and mean power spectral density value are given 
for four different sub-bands. 
The frequency spectrum below 1 GHz shows the highest 
occupancy values from the whole frequency domain that was 
covered during our measurement campaigns, both in the 
urban and rural environments. Nevertheless, in both cases the 
calculated values are below 50% (37.23% in the urban area, 
19.19% in the rural area), which means that even in this 
frequency range there are bands with some potential for 
cognitive radio applications. Another aspect worth being 
noticed is that for this frequency interval the difference 
between the two environments is the most significant one, 
the occupancy being almost double in case of the urban area. 
The reason for this difference is the lower density of 
broadcast radio and TV stations and a lower number of 
frequency channels used in case of the GSM mobile 
networks in the rural area.

The frequency band 25 to 230 MHz exhibits a quite high 
occupancy degree especially in the urban environment, 
mainly because of (Figure 3a). The occupancy results in case 
of this particular frequency band during the whole 
measurement period, divided in 6 time intervals, are given in 
Table IV. 
The frequency band 470-766 MHz (Figure 2) is licensed 
for analog and digital TV broadcasting. Although due to 
European regulations analog TV broadcasting in Romania 
was initially intending to be completely replaced by digital 
one beginning with the 1st of  January 2012, things are not 
quite there yet. In Figure 2 several analog TV broadcasting 
stations can be noticed in the urban area (the level for the 
station located on 506 MHz is higher than average, as the 
broadcast antenna is located on the same building from 
where the measurements were performed). This is also the 
frequency band where the biggest difference between the 
occupancy measured in the two environments was noticed 
(43.06% in the urban area compared to 11.42% in the rural 
one). The reason is mainly the DVB-T broadcasting that is 
for the moment performed only in the area surrounding 
Bucharest. The corresponding signals can be found in Figure 
2 on the 546 MHz carrier frequency (channel 30) and on the 
738 MHz carrier frequency (channel 54). Considering the 
fact that the spectral efficiency of the digital TV 
broadcasting is much higher than in case of the analog one, 
once the analog TV stations will cease broadcasting a drop in 
the spectral occupancy in this frequency band is to be 
expected. 
The 
Romanian 
National 
Authority 
for 
Management and Regulation in Communications (ANCOM) 
established 2013 as a new term for ceasing the analog TV 
broadcasting, so new measurements will have to be 
conducted in order to evaluate spectral occupancy in this 
frequency band afterwards. This frequency band is also 
targeted by several new standards based on dynamic 
spectrum access (including 802.22 and 802.11af). 
The lowest spectral occupancy below 1 GHz was 
obtained in the 766 to 880 MHz band (Figure 3b), however 
most of this band is for the moment licensed for military 
applications. In this frequency band, only a test DVB-T 
broadcast station (carrier frequency 778 MHz, channel 59) 
was detected in the urban area during the measurement 
campaign, although other possible applications are allowed 
according to the National Table for Frequency Allocation in 
Romania [16]. 
The 880-960 MHz (Figure 3c) and 1710-1880 MHz are 
licensed for the GSM 900 and 1800 mobile communication 
system. In the frequency bands corresponding to the 
downlink direction (925-960 MHz for GSM 900 and 1805-
1880 MHz for GSM 1800) a higher power level was 
measured, as the transmit power employed is considerably 
higher than the one used in case of mobile stations. In case of 
the rural environment, a significant difference in the degrees 
of occupancy was obtained in this frequency band depending 
on the time interval, as described in Table V. 
In order to prove the reason for such a big difference in 
the degree of occupancy, in Figure 1 are pictured the 
histograms for the three 8-hour intervals listed in Table V.  
As it can be clearly seen, a certain number of frequency 
channels used during the day (05:00 to 18:00) are turned off 
during nighttime, probably because of lack of traffic during 
off-work hours. Although in frequency bands corresponding 
to the uplink (880-915 MHz and 1710-1785 MHz) the 
measured 
occupancy 
was 
extremely 
low 
in 
both 
environments, it should be noted the measurement locations 
and the low transmit power of mobile stations might cause 
an underestimation of the real occupancy. CR equipment that 
are designed to function in these frequency bands should 
have a detection mechanism capable of recognizing low-
power signals with energy close to the noise floor, in order to 
avoid interference to primary users active in the area. 
The overall spectrum occupancy measured for the 
frequency bands above 1 GHz was extremely low for both 
environments (mean occupancies of less than 20% in both 
cases). As it can be noticed from Table III, the differences 
between the values obtained in the two areas are very small, 
excepting two bands: the 1710-1880 MHz band licensed for 
GSM 1800 and the 1880-2200 MHz band (Figure 3d) 
licensed for UMTS. In both cases because of the lower 
population density from the rural area the network operators 
use less frequency channels, this being the reason for the 
lower occupancy measured in the rural environment. 
Considering the very low spectrum occupancy degree, most 
of these frequency bands are potential candidates for CR 
applications.

The ISM band 2400 to 2500 MHz is a very good 
opportunity for testing CR prototype devices, as the 
measured occupancy is quite low in both cases (17.66% in 
the urban environment and 15.90% in the rural area) and 
there are multitudes of commercially available hardware 
devices that are able to operate in this frequency range. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Results obtained during the measurement campaign 
conducted in both urban (Bucharest) and rural (Maneciu)           
environments in Romania clearly indicate that several 
frequency bands allow opportunistic access for future CR 
applications, especially in the rural environment and for the 
frequency bands above 1 GHz. The analyzed frequency 
range was 25 MHz to 3.4 GHz, and the mean occupancy 
ratio over the whole band was as low as 21.00% in the urban 
environment and 14.19% in the rural environment. 
It is difficult to make a direct comparison between the 
results 
obtained 
during 
the 
different 
measurements 
campaigns mentioned in Section I and the measurement 
campaigns performed in Romania. The main reasons are the 
differences that can be found in the measurement setup 
(frequency intervals, spectrum analyzer bandwidth) and in 
the signal processing section (imposed false alarm 
probability). However, a common conclusion that can be 
drawn from the measurements is that the spectral occupancy 
degree that can be obtained by using a ‘classical’ static 
allocation approach is far from being optimal. The dynamic 
spectrum access proposed by technologies such as cognitive 
radio promises to bring substantial improvements in terms of 
efficiency of spectrum usage. 
Despite the fact that the calculated occupancy for some 
frequency bands is quite low (e.g., the GSM 900 and 1800 
uplink bands), CR devices intended to operate in these 
frequency areas should be properly designed in order to 
avoid interference with licensed systems. 
In order to increase the relevance of the obtained data, 
measurements in wider frequency bands (up to 6 GHz) are 
intended in the near future. 
Further measurements will be necessary in case of the 
470-766 MHz frequency band once the analog TV 
broadcasting will be completely replaced by the digital one.
