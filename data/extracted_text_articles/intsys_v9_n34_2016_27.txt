Abstract—With the current trend of embedding location ser-
vices within social networks, an ever growing amount of users’
spatiotemporal tracks are being collected. These tracks can be
used to generate user proﬁles to reﬂect users’ interests in places.
User-contributed annotations of places, as well as other place
properties, add a layer of important semantics that if considered,
can result in more reﬁned representations of the users? proﬁles.
In this paper, we study how such place-oriented proﬁles can
be used to represent similarity between users of Location-Based
Social Networks (LBSN). Spatial as well as semantic dimensions
of the user-provided information are used within a folksonomy
data model to represent relationships between users, places
and tags. The model allows simple co-occurrence methods and
similarity measures to be applied to build different views of
personalized user proﬁles. Basic proﬁles capture direct user
interactions, while enriched proﬁles offer an extended view of
user’s association with places and tags that takes into account
relationships in the folksonomy. The main contribution of this
work is the demonstration of how the different data dimensions
captured on location-based social networks can be combined to
represent useful views of user proﬁles and to compute similarity
between users.

I. INTRODUCTION
This work focuses on Location-Based Social Networks
(LBSN) that collect information on users’ interests in physical
places in the real world. By “switching on” location on
devices, we are giving away information on our whereabouts,
our daily routines, activities, experiences, and interests. Thus,
in comparison to other personal information, location data are
possibly the most crucial type of data of relevance to privacy,
as it pulls together our virtual and physical existences and
thus raises critical questions about privacy in both worlds.
This work proposes methods for constructing user proﬁles
using different dimensions of the data captured from users on
LBSN [1], and demonstrates how these proﬁles can be used
to measure different aspects of similarity between users.
Studying user similarity from LBSN data is useful, as
information available about users, their locations and activities
are normally sparse. User similarities can be exploited to
predict types of activities and places preferred by a user based
on those of users with similar preferences. So far, previous
works have studied data produced from LBSN from the point
of view of enhancing the services provided by these networks,
namely, for point of interest (POI) recommendations. There,
the question of concern is to ﬁnd places of interest to a
user based on their history of visits to other places and their
general interaction with the social network. Most works relied
mainly on the spatial dimension of user data [2], with some
works more recently exploring the relevance of the social and
content data dimensions on these networks [3]. However, data
dimensions are normally treated separately, or their outputs
are combined in fused models.
In this paper, both semantic and spatial interactions of
users are used to project distinct and complementary views of
personalised user proﬁles. Thus, user’s annotations on places
they visit are compiled in semantic proﬁles, while collective
user annotations on places are used to create speciﬁc proﬁles
for places that encapsulate user’s experiences in the place.
Place proﬁles, in turn, are used to construct personalised
user proﬁles. In comparison to previous works in the area
of recommendations, LBSN data are treated as folksonomies
of users, places and tags. User annotations in the form of
tips, their interaction with places, in the form of check-ins, as
well as general place properties, namely, place categories and
tags, are analysed concurrently to extract relations between
the three elements of the folksonomy. Simple co-occurrence
methods and similarity measures are used to compute direct
and enriched user proﬁles.
Similarity between users can then be computed using the
different views of user proﬁles; using their direct interactions
with the social network or extended with a holistic view of
other users’ interaction with the network in different regions
of geographic space. Previous works attempting a similar
approach used matrix factorization techniques to handle the
multiple data dimensions, but did not consider the use of the
range of content data as used in this paper. Sample realistic
data from Foursquare are used to demonstrate the approach
and evaluation results show its potential value.
The main contributions of this work can be summarized
as follows: 1) Collecting users’ direct feedback on venues
from LBSNs. Users’ interaction on LBSNs can be regarded as
user feedback on geographic places they visited and interacted
with. User’s visits to places are recorded along with their
comments and tags. 2) Modelling different levels of user
proﬁles extracted from the heterogeneous user feedback in
LBSNs. User-generated traces at venues in LBSNs include
both spatial and implicit semantic content. The location traces
are treated equally to the semantic traces inferred from their in-
teraction with the place through tagging and tipping. Collective
behaviour of users on the network are also used to understand
the place characteristics and these in turn are further used in
the modelling of user proﬁles. 3) Similarity between users on
LBSN is approached in a uniform manner within the proposed

framework, thus providing means of computing spatial, seman-
tic or a combined view of user similarity on these networks.
4) Evaluation experiments are carried out using samples of
realistic data sets for a representative number of users with
different levels of usage of the LBSN.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section
II provides an overview of related work and approaches.
In Section III, a geo-folksonomy data model for LBSN is
introduced and in Section IV different types of user proﬁles are
deﬁned using this model. Section V describes the approaches
to computing similarity between users and detailed evaluation
experiments are reported in Section VI. The paper concludes
in Section VII with an overview of future work.
II. RELATED WORK
Works on modelling user data in LBSN mainly consider two
problems; a) place (or point of interest) recommendation, and
b) user similarity calculation. Different types of data are used
by different approaches, namely, geographic content, social
content as well as textual annotations made by users. Also,
different methods are used in analysing the data, for example,
distance estimations for geographic data modelling and topic
modelling for annotation data analysis. In the area of POI
recommendation, works range from generic approaches that
uses the popularity of places [4] to recommendation methods
that are based on user’s individual preferences [5]. A useful
survey of these approaches can be found in [6].
Based on check-in data gathered through Foursquare,
Noulas and Mascolo [7] exploit factors such as the transition
between types of places, mobility between venues and spa-
tiotemporal characteristics of user check-in patterns to build
a supervised model for predicting a user’s next check-in. Ye,
Lui and Lee [5] investigated the geographical inﬂuence with
a power-law distribution. The hypothesis is that users tend to
visit places within short distances of one another. Other works
considered other distance distribution models [8]. Gao, Tang
and Liu [9] considered a joint model of geo-social correlations
for personalized POI recommendation, where the probability
of a user checking in to a new POI is described as a function
of correlations between user’s friends and non-friends close
to, and distant from a region of interest. Liu, Xiong and
Papadimitriou [10] approached the problem of POI recom-
mendations by proposing a geographical probabilistic factor
model that combines the modelling of geographical preference
and user mobility. Geographical inﬂuence is captured through
the identiﬁcation of latent regions of activity for all users of
the LBSN reﬂecting activity areas for the entire population
and mapping the individual user mobility over those regions.
Their model is enhanced by assuming a Poisson distribution
for the check-in count which better represents the skewed data
(users visiting some places one time, while other places 100s
of times). Whilst providing some useful insights for modelling
the spatial dimension of the data, the above works do not
consider the semantic dimension of the data.
Correlations between geographical distance and social con-
nections were noted in [11] [3]. Techniques of personalized
POI recommendation with geographical inﬂuence and social
connections mainly study these two elements separately, and
then combine their output together within a fused model.
Social inﬂuence is usually modeled through friend-based col-
laborative ﬁltering [12] [5] [13] with the assumption that a user
tends to be friends with other users who are geographically
close to him, or would want to visit similar places to those
visited by his friends. Ying, Lu, Kuo, and Tseng [14] proposed
to combine the social factor with individual preferences and
location popularity within a regression-tree model to recom-
mend POIs. The social factor corresponds to similar users;
users with common check-ins to the user in question. In this
paper, we also use this factor when extending user proﬁles to
represent places of interest within the region of user activity.
More recently, the importance of content information for
POI recommendation was recognised. Two types of content
can be considered, attributes of places and user-contributed
annotations. Place categories are normally used as an indica-
tion of user activity, thus a user visiting a French restaurant
would be considered as interested in French food, etc. User
annotations in the form of tips and comments are analysed
collectively to extract general topics to characterise places
or to extract collective sentiment indications about the place.
Examples of works that considered place categories are [15]
[16] [17] [18]. In [15] [16], Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
model was used to represent places as a probability distribution
over topics collected from tags and categories or comments
made in a place and similarly aggregate all tips from places
a user has visited to model a user’s interest. Aggregation was
necessary as terms associated with a single POI are usually
short, incomplete and ambiguous. [17] on the other hand
modelled topics from tweets and reviews from Twitter and
Yelp, and assumed that the relations between user interests and
location are derived from the topic distributions for both users
and locations. In [18], a probabilistic approach is proposed that
utilize geographical, social and categorical correlations among
users and places to recommend new POIs from historical
check-in data of all users. In this paper, we also model user’s
association to place through the place’s relation to tags, but
add the inﬂuence of other users relations in the place to the
equation. Aiming at improving the effectiveness of location
recommendation, Yang, et al [19] proposed a hybrid user
POI preference model by combining the preference extracted
from check-ins and text-based tips which were processed
using sentiment analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis is an
interesting type of semantics which we do not consider in this
work, but can be incorporated in future work.
So far, most works on user similarity mainly focused on
structured, e.g., geographic coordinates, or semi-structured,
e.g., tags and place categories, data. Recently, Lee and Chung
[20] presented a method for determining user similarity based
on LBSN data. While the authors made use of check-in
information, they concentrated on the hierarchy of location
categories supplied by Foursquare in conjunction with the
frequency of check-ins to determine a measure of similar-
ity. Mckenzie, Adams, and Janowicz [16] suggest exploring

unstructured user-contributed data, namely tips provided by
users. A topic-modelling approach is used to represent users’
interests in places. Venues (places in Foursquare) are described
as a mixture of a given number of topics and topic signatures
are computed as a distribution across venues. User similarity
can then be measured by computing a dissimilarity metric
between users’ topic distribution. Their method of modelling
venues is interesting, but it limits the representation of user
proﬁles, where proﬁles are based on generated topics derived
from collective user annotation on places. Thus, individualised
association of users with the place is somewhat ignored. In
contrast to the above approach, our model does not assume
constraints on the number of topics represented by the tags,
but combines the individual’s association with both tags and
place in the creation of user proﬁles.
Social links between users have also been widely utilized to
improve the quality of location-based recommender systems,
since the social friends are more likely to share common
interests on POIs than strangers. Most current works derive the
similarities between users from social links and put them into
the traditional memory-based or model-based collaborative ﬁl-
tering techniques. For example, some literature [8], [13], [21]–
[23] seamlessly integrated the similarities of users into the
user-based collaborative ﬁltering techniques, while others [19],
[24], [25] employed the user similarities as the regularization
terms or weights of latent factor models.
III. THE GEO-FOLKSONOMY MODEL
The location-based social networking platform Foursquare
was used as our source of data. It holds a large number
of crowdsourced venues (> 65 million places) from a user
population estimated recently to around 55 million users.
As the application deﬁnes it, a venue is a user-contributed
“physical location, such as a place of business or personal
residence.” Foursquare allows users to check in to a speciﬁc
venue, sharing their location with friends, as well as other
online social networks, such as Facebook or Twitter. Built with
a gamiﬁcation strategy, users are rewarded for checking in
to locations with badges, in-game points, and discounts from
advertisers. This game-play encourages users to revisit the ap-
plication, compete against their friends and contribute check-
ins, photos and tips. Tips consist of user input on a speciﬁc
venue, normally describing a recommendation, experience or
activity performed in the place.
In this work, we use a folksonomy data model to represent
user-place relationships and derive tag assignments from users’
actions of check-ins and annotation of venues. In particular,
tags are assigned to venues in our data model in two scenarios
as follows.
1) A user’s check-in results in the assignment of place
categories associated with the place as tags annotated by
this user. Thus, a check-in by user u in place r with the
categories (represented as keywords) x, y and z, will be
considered as an assertion of the form (u, r, (x, y, z)).
This in turn will be transformed to a set of triples
{(u, r, x), (u, r, y), (u, r, z)} in the folksonomy.
2) A user’s tip in the place also results in the assign-
ment of place categories as tags, in addition to the
set of keywords extracted from the tip. Thus, in the
above example, a tip by u in r with the keywords
(t1, · · · , tn), will be considered as an assertion of the
form (u, r, (x, y, z, t1, · · · , tn)), and is in turn trans-
formed to individual triples between the user, place and
tags in the folksonomy.
The process of extracting keywords from tips is done by
tokenizing the tip into a set of words (terms) on white space
and punctuation. Then we remove all words with non-latin
characters and stop words. The output is a set of single words
(term vector). Furthermore, we use Wordnet syntactic category
and logical groupings for classifying the extracted terms. For
example, Wordnet ’noun.act’ category is used to ﬁlter action
verbs and nouns to describe a user- or place- associated activity
(ex. swimming, buying or eating).
The data capturing process results in the creation of a
geo-folksonomy, which can be deﬁned as a quadruple F :=
(U, T, R, Y ), where U, T, R are ﬁnite sets of instances of
users, tags and places respectively, and Y deﬁnes a relation,
the tag assignment, between these sets, that is, Y ⊆ U ×T ×R,
[26] [27].
A geo-folksonomy can be transformed into a tripartite
undirected graph, which is denoted as folksonomy graph GF.
A geo-Folksonomy Graph GF = (VF, EF) is an undirected
weighted tripartite graph that models a given folksonomy
F, where: VF = U ∪ T ∪ R is the set of nodes, EF =
{{u, t}, {t, r}, {u, r}|(u, t, r) ∈ Y }} is the set of edges, and
a weight w is associated with each edge e ∈ EF.
The weight associated with an edge {u, t}, {t, r} and {u, r}
corresponds to the co-occurrence frequency of the correspond-
ing nodes within the set of tag assignments Y . For example,
w(t, r) = |{u ∈ U : (u, t, r) ∈ Y }| corresponds to the number
of users that assigned tag t to place r.
Figure 1 depicts the overall process of user proﬁle creation.
The process starts with data collection of check-ins and tip
data from Foursquare, that are then processed to extract users,
places and tags and their associated properties. The modelling
stage includes the deﬁnition of relationships between the
three entities and the application of folksonomy co-occurence
methods to extract the different types of proﬁles. Place and
tag similarity calculations are used to further extend the basic
proﬁles to build different views of enriched user proﬁles.
IV. USER MODELLING STRATEGIES
We propose an approach to modelling users in LBSN that
represents a user’s spatial, semantic and combined spatio-
semantic association with place. A spatial user proﬁle rep-
resents the user’s interest in places, while a tag-based proﬁle
describes his association with concepts associated with places
in the folksonomy model. A spatio-semantic proﬁle describes
the user speciﬁc interest in certain concepts associated with
places in his proﬁle. A user proﬁle is built in stages. Starting
with a basic proﬁle that utilises direct check-in and annotation
histories, a user proﬁle is then extended by computing the

Fig. 1. The framework of the proposed system.
relationship between places and concepts derived from the
collective behaviour of other users in the dataset. A basic
proﬁle represents actual interactions with places, while the
extended proﬁle describes “recommended” associations given
overall interactions between users, places and concepts in the
dataset. We are able to model such interactions separately in
the extended proﬁle by controlling the similarity function used
to create the proﬁle. For example, we can focus on modelling
the types of places visited by the user or take into account
visit behaviour of other users whose proﬁles overlap with the
user, as discussed below.
A. Basic User Proﬁles
Deﬁnition 1: Spatial User Proﬁle A spatial user proﬁle
PR(u) of a user u is deduced from the set of places that u
visited or annotated directly.
PR(u) ={(r, w(u, r))|(u, t, r) ∈ Y,
w(u, r) = |{t ∈ T : (u, t, r) ∈ Y }|}
(1)
w(u, r) is the number of tag assignments, where user u
assigned some tag t to place r through the action of checking-
in or annotation. Hence, the weight assigned to a place simply
corresponds to the frequency of the user reference to the place
either by checking in or by leaving a tip.
We further normalise the weights so that the sum of the
weights assigned to the places in the spatial proﬁle is equal to
1. We use PR to explicitly refer to the spatial proﬁle where
the sum of all weights is equal to 1, with
w(u, r) =
|{t∈T :(u,t,r)∈Y }|
n
P
i=1
m
P
j=1
|{ti∈T :(u,ti,rj)∈Y }|, where n and m are the
total number of tags and resources, respectively. More simply,
w(u, r) = N(u,r)
NT (u) , where N(u, r) is the number of tags used
by u for resource r, while NT (u) is the total number of tags
used by u for all places.
Correspondingly, we deﬁne the tag-based proﬁle of a user;
PT (u) as follows.
Deﬁnition 2: Semantic User Proﬁle A semantic user proﬁle
PT (u) of a user u is deduced from the set of tag assignments
linked with u.
PT (u) ={(t, w(u, t))|(u, t, r) ∈ Y,
w(u, t) = |{r ∈ R : (u, t, r) ∈ Y }|}
(2)
w(u, t) is the number of tag assignments where user u
assigned tag t to some place through the action of checking-in
or annotation.
PT refers to the semantic proﬁle where the sum of all
weights is equal to 1, with w(u, t) = N(u,t)
NR(u), where N(u, t)
is the number of resources annotated by u with t and NR(u)
is the total number of resources annotated by u.
Furthermore, we deﬁne a spatio-semantic proﬁle of a user
PRT (u), that is a personalised association between user, place
and tag.
Deﬁnition 3: Spatio-Semantic User Proﬁle Let Fu =
(Tu, Ru, Iu) of a given user u ∈ U be the restriction of
F to u, such that, Tu and Ru are ﬁnite sets of tags and
places respectively, that are referenced from tag assignments
performed by u, and Iu deﬁnes a relation between these sets:
Iu := {(t, r) ∈ Tu × Ru|(u, t, r) ∈ Y }.
A spatio-semantic user proﬁle PRT (u) of a user u is
deduced from the set of tag assignments made for place r
by u.
PRT (u) ={([r, t], wu([r, t]))|(t, r) ∈ Iu,
wu([r, t]) = |{t ∈ Tu : (t, r) ∈ Iu}|}
(3)
where w([r, t]) is how often user u assigned tag t to place r.
PRT is the spatio-semantic proﬁle where the sum of all
weights is equal to 1, with wu([r, t]) =
N(u,[r,t])
NRT (u) , where
N(u, [r, t]) is the number of times u annotate r with t, and
NRT (u) is the total number of tags assigned by u for r. (Note
that tag assignment by users for a place comes from both
the explicit action of annotation as well as implicit action of
checking-in as represented in the geo-folksonomy model).
B. Basic Place and Tag Proﬁles
So far, the basic user proﬁle provides only a limited view of
the user association with places and concepts derived directly
from captured data. Basic proﬁles reduce the dimensionality
of the folksonomy space by considering only 2 dimensions at
a time; user-place and user-tag, leading to a loss of correlation
information between all three elements.
Users proﬁles can be extended to represent possible latent
relationships in the data. Thus a user proﬁle can be used to
present places (respectively tags) similar to those in the basic
proﬁle, where similarity between places (respectively tags)
is measured through the collective actions of other users of
check-ins and annotations.

To compute tag-tag similarity, proﬁles for tags are ﬁrst
deﬁned through the places they are used to annotate. Thus,
a place-based tag proﬁle (PR(t)) of a tag t is a weighted
list of places r that are annotated by t. That is, w(r, t) is
determined by the number of users’ check-ins and tips that
resulted in assigning t to r in the geo-folksonomy. Similarity
between tags is deﬁned as the cosine similarity between their
place-based tag proﬁles as follows.
CSim(t1, t2) = |PR(t1) ∩ PR(t2)|
p
|PR(t1)|.|PR(t2)|
(4)
On the other hand, similarity between places is deﬁned
by measuring the similarity of their tag-based and user-based
proﬁles. Let PT (r) and PU(r) be the tag-based place proﬁle
and user-based place proﬁle for place r (deﬁned in a similar
manner to user proﬁles above). Conceptually, a tag-based place
proﬁle is a description of the place by the tags assigned to it
and a user-based place proﬁle is an account of users’ visits to
the place.
Cosine
similarity
between
tag-based
place
proﬁles
(CSimtag(r1, r2)) and between user-based place proﬁles
(CSimuser(r1, r2)) deﬁne a tag-oriented ranking and user-
oriented ranking, respectively. These similarity rankings can
be aggregated using the so-called Borda method [28] to
compute a generalised similarity score between two places.
PSim(r1, r2) = γ ∗CSimtag(r1, r2)+(1−γ)∗CSimuser(r1, r2)
(5)
where 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 is a parameter that determines the balance of
importance given to similarity scores from PT (r) and PU(r).
Conceptually, similarity between two places is a function of
the overlap between their tag assignments only (for γ = 0),
a measure of their common visitors only (for γ = 1), or both
(for γ between 0 and 1).
C. Enriched User Proﬁles
We extend the basic user proﬁles by the information ex-
tracted from the computation of tag and place similarity above.
The enriched user proﬁles will therefore present a modiﬁed
view of how users are associated with places that reﬂect
collective user behaviour on the LBSN.
Deﬁnition 4: Enriched Spatial User Proﬁle An enriched
spatial user proﬁle ´PR(u) of a user u is an extension of the
basic proﬁle by places with the highest degree of similarity to
places in PR(u). Let Ru be the set of all places in PR(u) and
wi is the weight associated with place i in the proﬁle.

wi =
 wi

wi∗Max(P Sim(ri,rj))

(6)
We extend the proﬁle by the 10 most similar places to every
place in the user proﬁle. The process of building the enriched
spatial proﬁle from place similarity with γ as an input is shown
in Figure 2. The complexity of the enrichment algorithm is
O(N ∗ M), where N is the number of users and M is the
number of places in the user proﬁle.

basic proﬁle by tags with the highest degree of similarity to
tags in PT (u). Let Tu be the set of all tags in PT (u) and wi
is the weight associated with tag i in the proﬁle.

(7)
A similar algorithm to that of enriching place proﬁles is used
for choosing the tags and weights.
Deﬁnition 6: Enriched Spatio-Semantic User Proﬁle
An enriched spatio-semantic user proﬁle ´PRT (u) of a user
u is an extension of the basic proﬁle by tags and places with
the highest degree of similarity to tags in PRT (u). Let Tu be
the set of all tags in PT (u), Ru be the set of all places in
PR(u) and wij is the weight associated with tag i and place
j in the proﬁle.
´PRT (u) =< [ri, tj], wu(ri, tj) > |wu(ri, tj) =

(8)
The spatio-semantic proﬁle is extended with the most similar
places to the user proﬁle and these are assigned a weight
computed using the place similarity value for all tags in their
place-tag proﬁles and 0 for tags that are not in their proﬁle.
Thus the user simply inherits relationships with all the tags
and their associated weights from basic places that are deemed
similar to those in his proﬁle.
1) User Proﬁle Example: Here an example is given of a
sample user proﬁle created from the dataset used in this work.
’user164’ checked in 600 different venues, with associated 400
venue categories. Note that one venue can have more than one
venue category. Figure 3 shows the top 20 tags in his semantic
user proﬁle. Figure 4 shows the ﬁltered tags from his proﬁle
that represent human activity (approximately 5% of all tags),
as derived by mapping to Wordnet noun.act category.
Figures 5 and 6 show the spatial proﬁle and the enriched
spatial proﬁle for user ’user164’, respectively. γ = 0.5 was
used in the place similarity equation of the enriched proﬁle.

The size of the dots in the ﬁgures represents the weight
(representing the degree of association) of the place in the
proﬁle. As shown in the ﬁgure, the level of association is
more prominent for many more places in the enriched spatial
proﬁle.

V. MEASURING USER SIMILARITY
Similarity between users can be measured on the basis
of their spatial, semantic or spatio-semantic proﬁles. Spatial
proﬁles gives a measure of user preferences in places. While
the basic spatial proﬁle will discover a map of common places
that the users visited or annotated, the enriched spatial proﬁle
Fig. 6. Enriched spatial user proﬁle for user ’user164’ with γ = 0.5.
will produce an extended map of places that are likely to be of
interest to both users. Similarity of spatial proﬁles can answer
the question of which other users visiting habits to places are
similar to mine?
Semantic proﬁles, on the other hand, is a conceptual mea-
sure of user interests. Semantic ﬁlters on the types of concepts,
e.g., themes of user activity or place type, can be applied to
the folksonomy to give a more focussed view of user interests.
Similarity of semantic proﬁles can answer questions such as,
which other users share the same sort of activities as I do?
Spatio-semantic user similarity is a measure of personalised
interests in places, as well as their associated concepts. It gives
a holistic view of user preferences in place and will answer
questions of which other users are interested in this (speciﬁc)
place and share the same experiences or interests in this place.
Cosine similarity between any of the above types of proﬁles
can be used to compute the similarity between users. The
application of this process can be constrained by region of
interest, by considering only users who have a high degree of
similarity between their basic spatial proﬁles.
Figure 7 shows a bar chart of similarity values between
’user164’ and other users, using their basic spatial and en-
riched spatial proﬁles. The ﬁgure demonstrates the impact
of enrichment on user similarity, where this user appears to
become more similar to other users in his proﬁle (e.g., with
’user134’), given an extended view of their interests in places
and their associated concepts.
VI. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
A. Datasets
Data about venues, tips and users who left the tips can be
collected directly from Foursquare. However, users’ check-in
data are normally private. Many Foursquare users tend to push
their check-in activity through Twitter; thus allowing another
means of tracing the check-in information.
Approximately (10 months) of check-in data in New York
city were collected from Foursquare between April 2012 and
February 2013. This data consists of 227,428 anonymized
user check-ins, with venue ids, venue category, longitude and

latitude of venues and time stamps of check-ins. The data was
then used to recursively extract venue-related tips (tip id, text
and time stamp), and subsequently all venues for users related
to the tips collected. 604,924 tips were collected for 167,786
users in 36,940 venues. Time stamps of the tip data range
from January 2009 to June 2015. Figure 8 shows the number
of places versus the number of users in the collected dataset.
As the ﬁgure shows, about 94% of the users visited less than
10 places and about 3% of users visited 11 to 20 places and
the remaining 3% visited 21 to 400 places.

Experiments were carried out using a sample of 400 users
(200 users with a high frequency of check-ins and co-location
rate and 200 users with a low frequency usage). Evaluation
results for the proﬁles are presented for the high frequency
users, but later a comparison between the two data sets is also
given. Tables I, II shows summary statistics of the used sample
datasets for both groups of users.

B. Evaluation of User Proﬁles
The evaluation experiment aims to measure the impact of
using the full range of content captured on LBSN when
building user proﬁles in comparison to using only partial views
based on the check-in information. The experiment takes the
form of place (and tag) top-N recommendation problem using
the different constructed user proﬁles and seeks to establish
how well the proﬁles reﬂect the user spatial and semantic
characteristics when using the LBSN. The algorithm used for
computing the top-N recommendations using spatial proﬁles
is shown in Figure 10.
We use recall@N, precision@N and F1@N as our success
measures, where N is a predeﬁned number of places (or tags)
to be recommended. Recall measures the ratio of correct
recommendations to the number of true places (or tags) of
a test check-in or tip record, whereas precision measures the
ratio of correct to false recommendations made. Recall and
precision are given by the following equations.
recall
=
TP
TP + FN
precision
=
TP
TP + FP
True positives (TP) is the number of correct place (or tags)
recommended; false positives (FP) is the number of wrong
recommendations and false negatives (FN) is the number of
true place (or tags) which were not recommended. F1 is a

The values of TP, FP and FN are determined by randomly
splitting the users into two sets; the training set and the
testing set. Multi-fold cross-validation was used to ensure a
fair partitioning between test data and training data. Data were
split 90% for training and 10% for testing, and the process was
repeated 5 times to create 5 folds and the mean performance
was reported.
1) Evaluation of Spatial Proﬁles:
Results for the en-
riched user proﬁles using the proposed top-N recommendation
method are presented. Different versions of the enriched
spatial proﬁles, using different place similarity measures were
created, a) using γ = 0 (to represent enrichment with place-
tag similarity only), b) using γ = 1, (to represent enrichment
with place-user similarity only), and c) using γ = 0.5 for an
aggregated view of both effects. Hence, result sets are shown
for the following user proﬁles. 1. Enriched-(Spatial + Tag) 2.
Enriched-(Spatial+ User) 3. Enriched-(Spatial + All).
We compare the results of the top-N recommendation using
the three different proﬁles with traditional Item-based Col-
laborative Filtering (IBCF) [29] and User-based collaborative
Filtering (UCBF) [30] approaches, applied against the basic
spatial user proﬁle for recommending top-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10,
20, 30, 40, 50. Figures 11, 12 and 13 show the precision,
recall and F1-measure for all approaches. As is shown in the
ﬁgures, enriched user proﬁles demonstrate signiﬁcantly better
performance in comparison to the traditional approaches. In
particular, the F1 measure for the combined proﬁle (Spatial +
All) outperforms the UBCF approach by 10% on average and
the IBCF approach by 12% on average.
2) Evaluation of Semantic proﬁles: A similar experiment
was carried out to evaluate the semantic user proﬁles. Again,
the results were compared to the UBCF and IBCF approaches.
Figures 14, 15 and 16 show the results of the top-10, 20,
30, 40, and 50 tag recommendations using the different
Fig. 11. Precision values for the top-N place recommendations.
Fig. 12. Recall values for the top-N place recommendations
methods. As shown in Figure 14, the enriched semantic proﬁle
demonstrates signiﬁcant improvements with respect to both the
UBCF and IBCF approaches. Results demonstrates the quality
of the enriched semantic user proﬁles, and thus conﬁrm their
utility for more accurate representations of user proﬁles.
C. Evaluation of User Similarity Approaches
1) Methodology: The measure of user similarity is evalu-
ated as an Information Retrieval problem where we search for
the most similar user to a particular user in question. Place
categories are used as a basis of ground truth comparison and
evaluation.
Table IV shows an example; where distinct categories for
the top-10 most visited places are shown for two sample users
(with similarity value of 0.65). Foursquare attaches more than

one category to a place, and thus, there may be more than 10
categories for the top-10 places . The highlighted cells show
the common categories between the two users.
Precision, recall and F-Measure are used as evaluation metrics
in the same way they are used in the IR literature. These are
deﬁned below.
Precision = |f(u) T f(usim)|
f(usim)

Recall = |f(u) T f(usim)|

Fig. 16. F1 measure values for top-N tag recommendations.
TABLE IV. Distinct categories for top-10 most visited place for two users
with similarity value of 0.65
where f(u) is the set of the distinct categories of the top-k
places of user u, usim is the most similar user, and f(usim) is
the set of distinct categories of the top-k places of the most
similar user usim. Hence, precision represents the ratio of
common categories between the two users in reference to those
of the ﬁrst user, while recall presents the same ration with
respect to the second user. The F1 measure is the harmonic
mean of precision and recall.
2) Similarity of Spatial Proﬁles: The evaluation experiment
aims to measure the impact of using the full range of content
captured on LBSN when building user proﬁles in comparison
to using only partial views based on check-in information.
We calculate the user similarity between the following user
proﬁles:
1) Spatial User proﬁle; (user sim)
2) Enriched Spatial with CSimtag, γ = 1; (user simtag)
3) Enriched Spatial with CSimuser, γ = 0; (user simuser)
4) Enriched Spatial with combined similarity, γ = 0.5);
(user simcombined)
Table V is a compilation of the precision, recall and F1-
measure values for the various user similarities. For each
proﬁle, we fetch the frequent top-5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 venues
and then evaluate their categories using the equations.
As can be shown in the table, similarity computation with
the enriched spatial proﬁles produce a higher degree of preci-
sion, recall and F-measures in general, whilst the best results
are for the enriched proﬁles with the combined place similarity.
Results indicate that location tracks may not be the best basis
for ﬁnding similar users and that a combined treatment of
both the spatial and semantic dimensions can produce more
accurate views of user proﬁles.
To further clarify the improvements in the evaluation metrics
ﬁgures 17, 18 and 19 present the improvement in percentage of
the metrics of the enriched proﬁle over the basic spatial proﬁle.

A positive value means an improvement in performance. As
can be observed, the average gain in precision and recall is best
demonstrated in the case of enriched proﬁle with the combined
spatial and semantic measures.

To evaluate the overall performance of similarity methods,
the Mean Average Precision (MAP) measure is employed.
MAP is a commonly used summary measure of a ranked
retrieval run. In our experiment, it stands for the mean of the
precision score after each relevant user is retrieved for different
top-N values, as in Equation (12).
MAP =

different user similarities from different proﬁles baselines, and
conﬁrms the improved results for the enriched combined user
similarity.

to the above is carried out for evaluating both the basic and
enriched semantic proﬁles. Table VI shows the precision, recall
and F1 measure values. As can be seen in the table, the
enriched semantic similarity method performed better than the
basic one. A compilation of an overall picture of the spatial

4) Inﬂuence of User Activity: Here a comparison is made
between the similarity methods, given different levels of user
activity on the LBSN. 200 users were chosen with high
frequency of usage of the network and 200 others with a much
reduced frequency as described in Table III.
Figure 22 summarises the results of the evaluation using
the similarity method with γ = 0.5. As can be expected, the
ﬁgure demonstrates how both the precision and recall values
are higher in the case of frequent user.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
This paper considers the problem of user proﬁling on
location-based social networks. Both the spatial (where) and
the semantic (what) dimensions of user and place data are
used to construct different views of a user’s proﬁle. A place
Fig. 22. Activity effect on combined user similarity
is considered to be associated with a set of tags or labels that
describe its associated place types, as well as summarise the
users’ annotations in the place. A folksonomy data model and
analysis methods are used to represent and manipulate the data
to construct user proﬁles and place proﬁles. It is shown how
user proﬁles can be extended from a basic model that describes
user’s direct links with a place, to enriched proﬁles describing
richer views of place data on the social network. The model
is ﬂexible and can be adjusted to focus on the spatial and
semantic dimensions separately or in combination. Results
demonstrate that the proposed methods produce user proﬁles
that are more representative of user’s spatial and semantic
preferences. The framework is used a a basis for computing
different methods of similarity between users. Experimental
results were carried out on a representative set of users of a
LBSN and demonstrate the efﬁcacy of basing the similarity on
proﬁles that combine both the semantic and spatial information
in the data. To our knowledge, no other works have proposed
similar treatments of the problem before. Future work will
consider the temporal dimension of the data, which adds
another layer of complexity as well as explore further inference
of useful semantics from the data, e.g., representation of
activities or experiences carried out in geographic places.
