Abstract— This paper describes the design and assessment of a
highly sensitive micro biosensor functioning at microwave
frequencies.
The
proposed
technique
allows
single
step
dielectric characterization and measurement of human cells. In
this work, two resonators are etched on the center of the
planar device. Their microscopic sensing area is an Inter-
Digital Capacitor (IDC) used to guarantee an intense electric
field, especially between 15 and 35 GHz. Hence, the inter
resonators detection capabilities are demonstrated on normal
(HaCaT) and cancerous (Glial) biological cells, which are
shaped as solid octagonal with the electrical proprieties found
in the literature. Experimental results on human cells are
presented showing the biosensor’s ability to differentiate at
least two particular cell types by means of frequency.

INTRODUCTION
In electrical approaches, the term dielectric spectroscopy,
which describes the interaction of an electromagnetic field
with biological elements, has become a topic of increasing
research interest in many fields, including biological and
medical fields [1][2].
Dielectric spectroscopy is therefore highly important in
non-invasive characterization of living biological cells [3].
Moreover, microwave frequencies can be used in different
biological researches for investigating the properties of
living matter by means of electromagnetic waves. Thus, at
high frequency, the electric field penetrates biological
elements
unimpeded
so
that
significant
induced
that
wavelengths are roughly equal to the dimensions of living
matter [4]. Also, dielectric proprieties which are related to
biological parameters of tested cells are ideally done in a
label-free manner and with electromagnetic readout.
Moreover, water is the single most abundant chemical
fund in cells, accounting for 70 % or more of the total cell
mass [5]. It shows relaxation ( ) dispersion that is suitable
for microwaves, with a corresponding frequency located
around 20 GHz [6], by means of its molecular reorientation
dynamic. It is now possible in this range to better understand
cancer mechanisms that constitute strong challenges to the
biologists and physicians communities.
Several kinds of bio-detection methods have been
adapted for the development of tools dedicated to both
manipulation and analysis, even with a low number of cells.
In particular, we mention the high sensitivity mechanical
method [7][8], optical (using fluorescence properties) [9][10]
or even electrical method. Nevertheless, specific markers are
used in order to have an efficient way to discriminate cells,
which can strongly modify cell properties and damage them.
Contrarily, electronic detection methods [11][12] become
interesting as they can be label-free.
Based on similar sensor topology, this paper presents a
CoPlanar Waveguide (CPW) resonator based on IDC
structure. The CPW-fed IDC biosensor has been designed
using standard microelectronics technologies which permits
to attain cell scale. In order to integrate the IDC sensor on
lab-on-chip, its planar configuration makes it a good
candidate for this system approach which is used also for
microfluidic method [13].
We propose an original biosensor design based on
microwave frequency impedance measurement for biological
cells. The biosensor is designed and simulated using a full-
wave
electromagnetic
simulation
tool.
Thanks
to
its
structure, this bio detection technique presents the advantage
of working with a very limited number of cells. The
presented
biosensor
successfully
discriminates
between
different cell types by means of frequency shifts.

After a review of the analysis, the modeling and the
characterization of this microwave resonator (Section 2), the
simulation results on the two types of human cells, normal
(HaCaT) and cancerous (Glial) cells are shown in Section 3
and
the
dielectric
parameters
are
extracted.
Finally,
conclusions are given in Section 4.

BIOSENSOR DESIGN
A.
RF design
Using the electromagnetic simulation software High
Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS), the biosensor was
designed to have several structural resonances between 15
and 35 GHz when a biological cell was present.
Hence, the proposed cell biosensor design is based on a
coplanar resonator structure made with an inter-digital
capacitor. The sensor is designed on a 500 um thick fused
silica substrate for its low loss properties in the RF frequency
domain and its transparency that allows easy observation of
cells through it. Indeed, molecular properties of pure glass
substrate provide a suitable and comfortable surface for cell
growth and colonization. Moreover, metal lines are made of
gold for its biocompatibility and its fast conductivity, with
thickness up to 7μm. As shown in Figure 1, a 20 um thick 
SU8 resist layer is deposited on the sensor surface to
delimitate the micro-culture chambers in order to allow
locating cells only in the areas where the EM field is strongly
concentrated (between comb capacitor fingers).
The dimensions of the proposed coplanar resonator
biosensor, as shown in Figure 2 and Table I, are optimized to
resonate at microwave band frequency.

DIMENSION DETAILS OF PROPOSED STRUCTURE
As illustrated in Figure 3(a), at resonance frequency the
IDC lines concentrate on most of the electric field. The
electric field between fingers is 9.749×10 5 V/m and near
inductor is 6.097×10 4 V/m. On the contrary, the magnetic
field, as shown in Figure 3(b), is minimum at the IDC area at
5.315×10 3 A/m and near the inductor is 2.048 A/m.

Accordingly, these areas will be highly sensitive to any
dielectric perturbation and have to be carefully designed to
efficiently interact with cells. So, spaces between these metal
lines are set to 10 um that represent dimensions in the same
range than cell size offering a better interaction with the
microwave signal.

IDC Structure
IDC is the main constituent of the proposed design, and
each element is discussed as follows. The dimensions of the
IDC structure are shown in Figure 2. The coplanar geometry
can be transformed into a parallel plate geometry using a
conformal transformation technique [14]. The capacitance of

SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we present the frequency response of the
designed sensor before and after addition of a sample with
different permittivities and losses at different positions on the
sensor.
A.
Expremental verification and Discussion
After modeling the sensor, the resonance frequency of
the biosensor in this work is chosen to be between 15 and 35
GHz and two peaks in the microwave frequency band are
observed, as frequencies above 10 GHz allow penetrating the
intrinsic content of biological cells. It is the case that
biological cells of interest are too small with an average
diameter about ~10 µm. As the sensor sensitivity is
concerned,
the
region
of
the
resonator
is,
therefore,
optimized to increase interaction between the EM fields and
cells. In the present sensor design, 10 μm gaps have been 
used.
The investigations focued on two cell types: HaCaT cell,
which
represents normal
cells with
measured relative
effective permittivity of 42 ± 3 and conductivity of 1.8 ± 0.3
S/m at 18 GHz and Glial cell, which represent tumor cells
with measured relative effective permittivity of 36 ± 3 and
conductivity of 0.1 ± 0.02 S/m at 18 GHz [15].
For all simulation results, we suppose that the cells are in
dry condition. This supposition is deemed fundamental
because signal absorption losses at high frequencies present
by aqueous saline solutions, which degrade RF performances
of the device.

Cancer cells are modeled as solid octagonal (Figure 2),
with a radius of 10 μm and the implemented medium is 
equivalent to ≈ 8 cells. As shown in Figure 4, the simulated 
reflection spectrum (S11) presents two peak frequencies at
17.8 GHz and 31.8 GHz, respectively, when the detection
area is empty (unloaded). Figure 5 illustrates the simulated
magnitude of the reflection coefficient (S11) of the coplanar
resonator biosensor when the interdigital capacitor lines are
loaded with a single normal (HaCaT) cells. Figure 6 depicts
the simulated reflection spectrum (S11) of the biosensor,
when the gaps between sensitive lines are loaded with
cancerous (Glial) cells. The interaction (field/cells) in this
region creates an electromagnetic perturbation frequency
shift in S11 response, whose amount varies from a cell type
to another.

Hence, the effect of eight living HaCaT cells on the
biosensor have been observed resulting in a frequency shift
of about 200 MHz and an increase of the S11 parameter of
about 0.7 dB while Glial cells show a frequency downshift of
200 MHz and a slight decrease of 11.7dB in the S11
parameter.

Nevertheless, according to these simulation results, the
biosensor can discern between the two cell types. In practice,
the cell’s global permittivity can be extracted with a good
accuracy probably on a large frequency band around the
sensor resonance frequency.
IV.
CONCLUSION
The developed sensor model has the advantage of
differentiating permittivity based on the resonant frequencies
and is well adapted for low concentration conditions. The
results
confirm
the
hypothesis
that
the
electrical
characteristics of normal and cancerous cells are different.
These preliminary simulation results can be used for other
cell types discrimination. It was also highlighted that these
simulations
can
become
a
relevant
alternative
to
conventional labeling techniques and could be more suitable
for complex and sensitive biological samples studies. The
practical realization of these sensors always remains a
challenge for us, especially as it requires a very high level
technology. Another interesting direction will be to develop
analytical modeling of the sensor resonant frequency versus
the
biological
media
permittivity,
based
on
graphene
substrate.
