Abstract—In this paper, an analytical threshold voltage model 
is developed for short-channel Strained-Si (s-Si) on Silicon-
Germanium-on-insulator (SGOI) MOSFET including the 
effects of interface charges. The two-dimensional Poisson’s 
equation is solved in the undamaged and damaged strained-Si 
and relaxed Si1-xGex regions to find out the surface potential 
minimum for calculating the threshold voltage. The results 
obtained from the developed model have been compared with 
the numerical simulation results obtained using ATLASTM 
from Silvaco. The extent of influence of hot carriers induced 
effects in terms of interface charges and damaged s-Si/front 
gate oxide interface on threshold voltage roll-off and drain 
induced barrier lowering (DIBL) have been studied.

INTRODUCTION 
The use of strained silicon channel has become an 
unavoidable feature for sub 100nm regime CMOS 
technology, 
to 
maintain 
the 
expected 
performance 
improvements through scaling [1]. Among various proposed 
strained channel MOS structures, strained-Si on silicon-
germanium-on-insulator (SGOI) MOSFET has received 
considerable attention because of providing more flexibility 
to control the strain in channel [2]. At such nanometer scaled 
devices, hot-carrier induced interface charges grievously 
affect the device performance, [3]. Besides this, downscaling 
of device also makes the short-channel effects (SCEs) severe 
[4]. It has been reported that the performance of the 
nanometer strained-Si devices is significantly dependent on 
the interface state charges near the Si/SiO2 interface [5]. 
Thus, it becomes obligatory to investigate the depth up to 
which the interface charges can affect the short-channel 
device performance. A number of researchers have reported 
the study including interface charges for strained-Si SOI 
MOSFETs [3, 6]. Recently, a threshold voltage model is 
presented for strained-Si on SGOI MOSFETs [7]; however 
the effects of localized charges on short-channel effects are 
not investigated.  
   In this paper, a threshold voltage model is presented for 
strained-Si on SGOI MOSFETs including the effects of 
interface charges. Effects of the interface charges on the 
drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and threshold voltage 
roll-off are discussed. A uniform distribution of localized 
charges has been taken into consideration. In Section II, the 
device structure is briefed in terms of various device 
parameters. Section III deals with the modeling approach 
carried out while deriving the surface potential and threshold 
voltage of the device. All the theoretical results have been 
compared with the 2D simulation results, obtained by 
ATLASTM 2D device simulator [8], and discussed in Section 
IV. The paper has been concluded in Section V.

DEVICE STRUCTURE 
Fig. 1 shows the schematic cross sectional view of the 
strained-Si on SGOI MOSFET structure with induced 
localized charges. A layer of Si is grown pseudomorphically 
on the relaxed Si1-xGex layer, where x is the Ge mole 
fraction, which causes the strain in the Si layer due to lattice 
mismatching with Si1-xGex.

MODELING APPROACH 
     Fig. 2 displays the change in silicon energy band 
structure because of strain in the silicon channel. The device 
simulator model library of ATLASTM, thus, has been 
modified according to the effects of strain on Si band 
structure [9].

A. Surface Potential Formulation 
First, To find out the potential distribution ( (
φ x, y)
) in 
the channel region, the 2D Poisson’s equations has been 
solved in all the four regions of strained-Si and relaxed Si1-
xGex layers as shown in Fig. 1. The equations are

concentration; q is the electronic charge;

B. Threshold Voltage Formulation 
The Because of the coexistence of the damaged and the 
undamaged regions in our device structure, the minimum 
surface potential of device is determined by the magnitude 
and polarity of the charge present in the damaged region. 
Thus, depending on the polarity of interface charges, 
threshold voltage, say
Vth+(−)
, for positive (negative) type of 
interface charges can be found as follows as [7]:

where, 
ΦF,Si
 is the difference between the Fermi potential 
and the intrinsic Fermi level in the bulk region, 
∆Φs−Si
 is 
the change in the work-function of silicon due to strain, 
Φth
 
is the value of surface potential at which the volumetric 
inversion electron charge density in the strained-Si device is 
the same as that in the unstrained-Si at threshold, i.e., equal 
to the body doping. 
Solving (24), we obtain the final expression of threshold

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
This section contains the comparison between the 
analytical results obtained from our proposed model with the 
numerical simulation data extracted from simulating the 
device structure under consideration with a commercially 
available 2D device simulator ATLASTM [8]. The threshold 
voltage is extracted from the ATLAS simulation by 
maximum transconductance method. Fig. 3 shows the 
variation of threshold voltage roll-off with positive and 
negative interface charge densities for different damaged 
region length, Ld. It is found that threshold voltage roll-off 
increases for both positive and negative interface charge 
densities but rate of increment is higher for negative charge 
density. However, the nature of variation is different in both 
of the cases. In the case of positive interface charge density, 
there is an increase in threshold voltage roll-off with Ld 
whereas for negative interface charges, roll-off decreases 
with Ld. Fig. 4 discusses the impact of drain voltage on 
device characteristics in terms of drain induced barrier 
lowering (DIBL) variation with respect to interface charge 
density. It can be observed that that DIBL increases very 
sharply with increasing negative interface charge density but 
very slightly decreases with positive interface charge density.

DIBL is large for smaller damaged length for negative 
interface charge density. Finally, Fig. 5 compositely 
illustrates the effect of damaged region length on threshold 
voltage roll-off and DIBL for different Ge mole fraction (x). 
It is observed that larger x, which also corresponds to the 
higher strain in the channel region, suppresses the threshold 
voltage roll-off and drain induced barrier lowering 
effectively. However, with respect to the length of damaged 
region, the trend of variation becomes reverse i.e., the 
threshold voltage roll-off decreases whereas DLBL increases 
with the increases in Ld.

CONCLUSION 
An analytical threshold voltage model is derived 
including the effect both positive and negative interface 
charges. It is observed that the negative interface charge 
density has more severe effect than the positive interface 
charge density on the DIBL and threshold voltage roll-off of 
the strained-Si on SGOI MOSFETs. However, it is found 
that strain in the silicon channel suppresses short-channel 
effects. The proposed model results are in good agreement 
with the numerical simulation results.
