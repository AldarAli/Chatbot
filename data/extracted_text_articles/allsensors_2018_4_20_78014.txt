Abstract— The detection of gaseous pollutants such as Benzene, 
Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene (BTEX) under real 
conditions requires working in a humid environment. It is well 
known that the humidity reduces the performances of gas 
sensors, particularly in terms of sensitivity. Using a filter based 
on an ionic liquid (IL), low concentrations of BTEX can be 
detected with a tungsten trioxide (WO3) thin film (50 nm) 
deposited by reactive radio frequency (RF) magnetron 
sputtering on a transducer which has developed in IM2NP 
laboratory. With this absorption upstream, we are able to detect 
500 ppb of BTEX gases without a sensor sensitivity decrease 
with 50% relative humidity in the inlet feed.

INTRODUCTION 
Air quality monitoring has become an important health 
and societal issue. Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and 
Xylenes (BTEX gases) are among the targeted VOCs 
(Volatile Organic Compounds). It is well known that relative 
humidity is an important factor influencing the performance 
of metal oxide gas sensors, especially in terms of sensitivity 
[1]. In this work, we demonstrated the possibility to detect low 
BTEX concentration (500ppb) with 50% relative humidity in 
the inlet feed, without loss of the sensor sensitivity, using a 
WO3 gas sensor with an ionic liquid (IL) based filter upstream. 
We also demonstrated that the ionic liquid only captures the 
humidity in air and does not affect the sensor response. 
In Section II, we describe the WO3 microsensor, the test 
bench and the IL filter. In Section III, we present and comment 
experimental results showing the effect of the IL filter on the 
detection of low BTEX concentration under 50% relative 
humidity.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
A. Microsensor design and sensitive layer 
Our device is composed of an integrated Pt heater and Pt 
electrodes for the measurements, deposited by sputtering on a 
Si/SiO2 substrate (Fig.1) [2]. The sensitive layer of tungsten 
trioxide (50 nm) was deposited on the top of these electrodes, 
by reactive RF magnetron sputtering. Then, the device was 
annealed at 723K during two hours in order to stabilize the 
crystallinity of the sensitive layer. 
The tungsten trioxide (WO3) is a n-type metal oxide with 
a large gap and oxygen vacancies. The conductivity of this 
oxide depends on the composition of the surrounding gas 
atmosphere [3].  
During all our studies, we used an operating temperature 
of 513 K. The electrical measurements were made under a 
constant gas flow of 100 sccm.

B. Test bench for electrical characterization under BTEX 
gases and humidity 
We used a test bench specially designed for the BTEX 
detection in the presence of different humidity levels. It is 
composed of a gas dilution and humidification system that 
generates an output mixture at very low concentrations (1 to 
500 ppb) with a variable humidity (0 to 90%), an integrated 
test cell and an acquisition system to characterize the electrical 
responses of the gas microsensor (Fig.2). 
Humidity is generated starting from pressurized liquid 
water, which is vaporized through a microporous membrane. 
The water vapor is injected into the dry gas mixture by means 
of a proportional valve. This valve, controlled by a humidity

sensor placed at the humidifier outlet, makes it possible to 
keep the hygrometry of the mixture constant. The vapor 
pressure is kept sufficient by heating and regulating the 
temperature of the vaporization cell. A second humidity 
sensor is placed at the output of the filter.

C. Ionic liquid based filter 
Ionic Liquids are classified like polar solvents and they 
have attractive properties such as low vapor pressure, thermal 
stability or selective solubility [4]. The innovation of this filter 
is to adsorb the water molecules in the atmosphere without 
capturing the BTEX gas molecules [5]. The 1-Butyl-3-
methylimidazolium bromide (bmimBr) has been chosen for 
its great hygroscopic property. In order to eliminate the 
influence of a solid matrix or any other form of support, the 
filter is made by bubbling the gas mixture into a glass 
container filled with the IL.

RESULTS AND DISCUSION 
A. Influence of wet air on sensor response to BTEX 
To study the humidity influence on the sensor response, 
we exposed our sensor to 500 ppb of BTEX for 4 minutes (Fig. 
3) under dry air and wet air (50% RH). The sensor response 
was calculated using the relation (1): 
𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒 (%) = (𝑅𝑎𝑖𝑟 − 𝑅𝑔𝑎𝑠
𝑅𝑔𝑎𝑠
) ∗ 100             (1) 
with Rair, the sensor resistance in air before gas exposure and 
Rgas, the sensor resistance in presence of BTEX. 
Under dry air, the sensor response to 500 ppb of BTEX is 
24%. The introduction of 50% of relative humidity in the 
atmosphere reduces the sensor response to 12%. The sensor 
response is divided by 2 under 50% of relative humidity.  
This behavior is well known and has been already reported 
in the literature. Several hypotheses have been made about this 
behavior [6]. Firstly, the adsorption of the water molecules 
leads to a decrease in the chemical adsorption of the oxygen 
species on the surface of the metal oxide [7]. Secondly, The 
BTEX molecules compete with the water molecules to react 
on the same adsorption sites [8]. In both cases, the 
introduction of relative humidity in the atmosphere leads to a 
decrease of the sensor response.

wet air (50%) 
B. Influence of ionic liquid based filter on sensor response 
to BTEX under wet air 
To reduce the humidity influence on the sensor response, 
we placed the IL filter upstream to the sensor and we exposed 
the sensor to 500 ppb of BTEX for 4 minutes (Fig. 4) under 
wet air (50% RH). In Figure 4, we can observe that when the 
IL filter is placed upstream the sensor, the response to 500 ppb 
of BTEX remains 25%. Hence, with this filter, we keep the 
BTEX detection performance of our sensor, even in presence 
of 50% of relative humidity in the atmosphere.

wet air (50%) with ionic liquid filter 
The main objective of this work being to validate the filter 
ability to trap water vapor, we first chose to work with a 50% 
humidity rate which is considered as a good reference for gas 
sensors tests. Now that we have shown the performance of this 
type of filter, it will be interesting to study, in future 
experiments, the variation of operating conditions as higher 
humidity levels, different flow rate or BTEX concentration. 
This will help to understand at which humidity the sensor 
response significantly declines.

Furthermore, Figure 4 shows that the response of the 
BTEX sensor with the filter inserted into the gas flow is 
slightly higher and has a larger slope compared to the response 
under dry air. This behavior is reproducible. It may be related 
to the high viscosity of the ionic liquid, which causes pressure 
and flow rate variations at the gas sensor. Further experiments 
are needed to validate this hypothesis.  
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this work, we proposed a new solution to protect metal 
oxide gas sensors from the influence of humidity. We show 
the possibility to detect low BTEX concentrations under wet 
air with a WO3 gas sensor associated with a filter based on an 
ionic liquid. We also demonstrated that the ionic liquid did not 
disturb the BTEX detection.  
Further work is in progress to study the behavior of the IL 
filter under high humidity and to insert the IL into a solid 
matrix to make a more convenient filter [5].
