Abstract - For a long time, the shipping industry has relied on
Noon Reports to extract the main parameters required to
define both the ship’s performance and fuel consumption,
despite the fact that these reports have low sampling frequency
(approx.
24
hours.
Nowadays,
satellite
communications,
telemetries, data collection, and analytics are making possible
to treat a fleet of ships as a single unit. Thus, the shipping
industry is definitely part of the information business. In the
current work, we present a qualitative and quantitative
comparison between the models developed from historical
trends
that
are
extracted
from Noon
Reports
and
the
Continuous Monitoring System. The analysis is based on
parameters that are reported by both data sources. While
effort has been made in order to quantify variances due to the
different sampling rate, our main focus was on quantification
of uncertainty and the resulted confidence interval in order to
clarify the potential and limitations of the resulting predictive
models. The paper aims to contribute to the areas of tools and
mechanisms of data analytics, in the specific area of maritime
intelligence.

INTRODUCTION
Today’s ships are equipped with numerous sensors and
advanced systems which help to operate vessels more
efficiently. Any decision making inside a shipping company
must be based on accurate and verifiable data and not just
on feelings, instincts, or intuition. Managing a fleet of
vessels involves complex processes. The ability to utilize
data to
obtain actionable knowledge, predictions and
insights allows for continuous process improvements and
optimal performance throughout the lifetime of assets.
The ability to manage all data and information from
different systems onboard in a safe and efficient manner
enables a new level of possibility to analyze and monitor
situations, critical operations and adverse conditions as well
as
to
increase
performance
awareness.
Integration
of
performance indicators across systems is vital for getting the
full overview of actual asset operation. Aggregation of
lower level performance indicators into top-level Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) is a proven approach to
performance management as the condition and operation of
sub-systems is crucial for the total system operational
predictability and the need for maintenance. Knowing how
the vessel and its systems perform in real operation is a
cornerstone for optimizing the fuel efficiency and technical
maintenance of the vessel and its systems.
Aldous [1] provides a comprehensive review of the
recent developments in performance monitoring based on
data derived either by Noon Reports or by Continuous
Monitoring System. In this work,
an extensive review of
the models, namely theoretical, statistical and hybrid used in
ship performance assessment is provided. Additionally, the
author
refers to
eight categories of application of ship
performance models: i) Operational real-time optimization
(e.g
Armstrong
[2],
Psaraftis
&
Kontovas
[3]),
ii)
Maintenance trigger (e.g. Walker & Atkins [4]), iii)
Evaluating technological interventions (e.g. Stulgis [5]), iv)
Operational delivery plan optimization (e.g. Rakke et al.
[6]), v) Fault analysis (e.g. Spandonidis & Giordamlis [7],
Djeziri et al. [8]), vi) Charter party analysis, vii) Vessel
benchmarking (e.g. Bazari [9]) and viii) Inform policy (e.g.
Smith et al. [10]). In that framework, Aldous et al. [11]
provide a method for quantifying the uncertainty in reported
fuel consumption between two months and one year’s worth
of
data
from
89
ships.
The
subsequently
calculated
confidence is then compared to the uncertainty in the data
acquired from an onboard continuous monitoring system.
Furthermore, ISO [12] describes the uncertainty entered into
the measurement from various sources as well as proposes a
data handling methodology. Nevertheless, utilizing data
from ships in order to support the decision-making process
of shipping companies, and to provide insight for cost-
efficient operations, is not a new idea. This has been
previously mentioned as part of traditional methods based
on Noon Reports data, which are quite popular within the
marine industry.
In the current work, we take the first step towards
quantifying
the
statistical
trustworthiness
of
different
methods of data collection, as obtained by Noon Reports
(NR) and from LAROS Continuous Monitoring System (L-
CMS). Our aim is to examine the capabilities of each
method
to
provide
reliable
input
in
performance
assessments, by presenting a case study based on real
obtained datasets from NR and L-CMS.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In
Section II, we present briefly the basic architecture of the
LAROS Continuous Monitoring System. In Section III,
verification, validation, and software modules of the L-CMS
platform are presented. Test results and corrective actions
taken are also discussed. In Section IV, we present the
methodology used in the current work for the quantification
of performance based on a standard indicator as well as the
tested ship and methods of data acquisition.

measures for the quantification of the reliability level of
each method are utilized. A study on how differences in the
frequency of the reporting could affect trim optimization is
also included. Finally, in Section V, we discuss the key
results of the study.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
For the Continuous Monitoring System, we relied on
LAROS system.

Smart Collectors are connected using the appropriate
interface to analog or digital signals coming from
different sensors and instruments of the vessel.

Smart Collectors analyze the signals and calculate
the required parameters. The sampling rate, as well
as the rate of the parameters calculations, can be set
from 100 msec up to 30 minutes.

Smart Collectors set up a wireless secure network
inside the vessel to transmit the processed data to the
Gateway with a user-defined sampling rate and
ability to maintain and customize them remotely.
The wireless protocol is based on IEEE 802.15.4
MESH (Adams [13]) with additional layers and data
format to cover the requirements of the vessel
environment and increase the network Quality of
Service.

Through
the
Gateway,
all
the
measured
and
processed parameters are stored in Central Server
(onboard). The Server periodically produces binary
files and compresses them in order to reduce the size
of the data to be sent via normal satellite broadband.

The compressed files are transmitted through File
Transfer Protocol (FTP) to the HQ database.

In
the
data
center,
there
is
a
service
that
decompresses the incoming files and stores the new
measurements in the main database.

SOFTWARE (SW) SYSTEM TESTING
The test plan followed can be briefly described as
follows:
A. SW Module Verification
In order to verify our results, that is, to ensure that the
code runs correctly given the equations of the model, two
kinds of reliability tests were performed:
a)
Evaluation
of
conservation
principles
and
the
subsequent execution of SW algorithms;
b) Monitoring of the systematic and the statistical error.
B. SW Validation
SW
validation
should
involve
comparison
of
characteristically obtained results with the same data
obtained by other systems or sensors. However, there was
lack of data during the implementation phase, as the vessel
was at port/berth and main systems were inactive. In
addition, Trim/List sensor was not mounted. To overcome
this difficulty, two different kinds of validation tests were
performed by different testing groups:
a) Regression testing. This represents the evaluation of
data quality in the long term. The crew was instructed to
report
daily
both
LAROS
measurements
and
sensor
measurements of critical systems. Measurements were noted
on regular periods (e.g. every 3 hours). Regression models
(linear) were applied in order to estimate any deviation.
b) Performance testing. Performance testing was done
by performing system and regression testing with a smaller
sampling
rate
during
both
transient
and
steady-state
conditions.

C. Test results
Testing procedure was performed according to the
initial plan. Minor difficulties faced during the process were
resolved ad hoc. The calculated uncertainties are standard
deviations of the average (e.g. Speed over ground, Torque,
etc.) at a 95% confidence level. The software module
performs very well with a standard deviation of less than
1% in the steady state. Furthermore, for transient state
validation showed the deviation of measured results from
experimental data is less than 2%. This deviation was
judged to be of acceptable level and is mainly caused by the
sampling rate (60 sec) of hardware equipment. During the
test period, based on data measured by the crew, onboard
support engineers identified that main engine’s fuel oil
temperature presented a nonlinearity compared to actual
measurements.
Figure 2 presents some samples of the
collected data: The issue resolved upon calibration of the
collector with the appropriate linear function. Table II
summarizes the results of system testing.

METHODOLOGY AND CASE STUDY RESULTS
We focus on a time period of 9 months for the
performance assessment of hull and propeller, targeting
mainly hull fouling degradation. The ship that provided the
data for the comparison study is a 170000 DWT Bulk
Carrier. In a first instance, we choose to use average values
per hour from the L-CMS. The ship sailed about 60.5% of
the considered time.
A. Evaluation based on power deviation
The targeted performance indicator is the increase of
the required power, which affects significantly the ship’s
fuel consumption. The performance indicator is calculated
as (ISO [12]):
%ܲ݋ݓ݁ݎ݅݊ܿݎ݁ܽݏ݁=
௉೘೐ೌೞೠೝ೐೏ష௉೐ೣ೛೐೎೟೐೏
௉೐ೣ೛೐೎೟೐೏
(1)
where Pexpected corresponds to the expected delivered
power needed to maintain a given speed at a specific
loading condition and with no effect from environmental
conditions. For the estimation of the expected power, we use
as a model the reference power – speed curves obtained
from sea trials, corresponding to the ballast and full load
condition. We apply a correction on the power values for
displacement deviation of the actual values from the
reference ones using the Admiralty formula, according to
the next equation:
ܲୣ = ܲୣ(୰ୣ୤) ൬
୼ೌ೎೟
୼೏(ೝ೐೑)൰
ଶ ଷ
⁄
(2)
Furthermore, no extrapolation of speed-power curves is
allowed, thus we utilize data only for the speed range of the
trial tests. In addition, we are not considering measurements
that correspond to values of displacement and trim that
deviate more than 5% Δ and 0.5% LBP from the respective
values
of
the
reference
conditions.
Furthermore,
the
performance
index
presented
before
is
calculated
by
filtering data that exceeds various upper bounds of wind
force (e.g. 4 Beaufort Force (BF), 5 BF etc.).
Different data acquisition methods are available for
carrying out the assessment. The first is based on NR filled
out by the crew on a daily basis and the second one relies on
the L-CMS, in which several reporting frequencies have
been examined (hourly, 15 and 5 min). We test the
capability of the trend prediction over time using the 2
methods. The key idea for this comparison study is to use a
fraction of the available information as hindcast data and the
remaining period to play the role of the forecast period. The
first three months are used as the hindcast period. The
forecast trend is calculated based on hindcast (or trained)
data using a linear regression model. The actual trend is
calculated by the known data of the “forecast” period using
the same model. In the framework of this study, we assume
that the linear regression model is capable of providing the
trend, as we focus on the comparison between the 2
methods.
Figure 3 shows the results when an upper bound of
wind force of 5 BF is applied. In order to quantify the
comparison between the actual and the forecast trend, we
calculate the standard error of the estimate for the “forecast”
period and we average over the whole wind force range
(Figure 4). In this graph, we have also included the
respective values of the various reporting periods. As
expected, the frequent periods result in smaller estimate
errors for the forecasting period.

B. Trim optimization based on Heickel coefficient
Trim is defined as the difference between the draughts
at ship’s aft and forward, with positive trim to the aft. Being
one of the usual methods for improving ship performance
and energy efficiency optimization, trim optimization refers
to minimization of the required power at vessel specific
displacement and specific speed, thus reducing the hull
resistance and/or increasing the total propulsive efficiency.
Normally, the procedure demands dedicated model tests
and/or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling [14].
Next, we are using a traditional and reliable measure for the
assessment of the hull and propulsion efficiency, such as the
well-known
Heickel
coefficient
that
reflects
the
hydrodynamic efficiency of ship’s hull form [15] in order to
evaluate the ability to optimize the trim based on L-CMS
and NR data. Heickel coefficient is defined as:
ܪ݈݁݅ܿ݇݁ ܥ݋݂݁.=ܸ∙ ቀ√௱
௉ ቁ
ଵ ଷ
⁄
(3)
where Δ is the displacement, P the engine power, and V 
the ship’s speed. Figure 5 illustrates Heickel coefficient
propagation for the 9-month period under evaluation.
Figure 5.
Heickel Coefficient propagation for L-CMS (up) and NR
(down) data.
In general, the Heickel coefficient is operational speed
and displacement dependent. In order to overcome this
106

dependence, we evaluate the coefficient against the Froude
number given by the equation:
ܨ݊=
௏
ඥ௚∙௅ೢ
(4)
where g is the gravity acceleration and Lw is the ship’s
waterline length. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the contour plots
for Heickel coefficient with respect to Froude number and
trim distributions for ballast and full load condition,
respectively. The same filters and operational conditions
were used for both cases (L-CMS and NR). Visual
evaluation of the plots produced by L-CMS data (up) and
NR data (down) prove that the limited number of sampling
point from the latter make it almost impossible to produce
any constructive result. In contrast, the plurality of data
acquired from the former gives a good navigation map for
delicate trim optimization. As shown, Heickel coefficient is
directly related to trim, hence optimal trim with respect to
the Froude number should be selected in order to reduce
ship resistance.

Working in that direction and based on L-CMS data,
we evaluated the potential gain of trim optimization for
specific operational conditions. Thus, we considered only
data for wind force below 2 BF and Froude number between
0.09 and 0.125, which proved to be the normal value limits
for normal operation. Figure 8 illustrates the contour plots
for trim values with respect to Heickel coefficient and
Froude number distribution for ballast (up) and full load
(down) conditions. As shown in both cases and for Froude
number close to 0.105, a correction to the trim value of the
order of half a meter may result in a 4% reduction of fuel
consumption. Table III presents some indicative results for
the estimation of fuel and cost reduction on the assumption
of half meter trim correction from ordered trim.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
A step towards the assessment of the trustworthiness
level
of
different
data
collection
methods
used
in
performance assessments was presented. For the current
work, we restricted our efforts only to parameters that are
reported by both sources: Noon Reports and LAROS
Continuous Monitoring System. Power increase (%) was
used as an evaluated performance indicator, while a trim
assessment study was also carried out. Special attention was
given to the quantification of our comparison study and
especially to the frequency of the reporting period by
examining the capability of prediction potential through the
standard error of the estimate in each case.
The
results
indicated
that
NR
data provide
less
statistically reliable data than the L-CMS. Of course, this
depends also on the quality of the NR, which according to
our analysis, in this specific case was quite sufficient. It is
also derived that the high-frequency data of the L-CMS
method provide a more detailed insight, as shown in the
trim assessment study.
A logical next step in our research would be the
systematic evaluation of the impact of the sampling rate on
energy/emissions
efficiency
and
key
performance
indicators, as well as of the learning procedure of predictive
algorithms.
