Abstract—In this work, we suggest to model the dynamics of
power grids in terms of a two-layer network, and use the Italian
high voltage power grid as a proof-of-principle example. The
ﬁrst layer in our model represents the power grid consisting of
generators and consumers, while the second layer represents a
dynamic communication network that serves as a controller of
the ﬁrst layer. In particular, the dynamics of the power grid is
modelled by the Kuramoto model with inertia, while the com-
munication layer provides a control signal P c
i for each generator
to improve frequency synchronization within the power grid.
We propose different realizations of the communication layer
topology and different ways to calculate the control signal. Then,
we conduct a systematic survey of the two-layer system against
a multitude of different realistic perturbation scenarios, such as
disconnecting generators, increasing demand of consumers, or
generators with stochastic power output. When using a control
topology that allows all generators to exchange information, we
ﬁnd that a control scheme aimed to minimize the frequency
difference between adjacent nodes operates very efﬁciently even
against the worst scenarios with the strongest perturbations.

I. INTRODUCTION
Global warming, the growing world population and power
demand, with a subsequent increase in carbon power emis-
sions, have provoked governments and energy utilities to take
solid steps towards the use of renewable energies [1] and
their integration within the existing power transmission and
distribution systems, thus challenging scientiﬁc and techno-
logical research towards the goal of increasing the efﬁciency
and ﬂexibility of the power system [2]–[5]. The existing power
grid was developed using a centralistic approach, therefore we
have a few very high-power ac plants operating at 50 or 60
Hz interconnected by ac or dc transmission systems operating
at very high voltages (e.g., 400 kV) and many substations,
where the high voltage is transformed to the distribution level
(e.g., 20 kV). In order to distribute the power in a capillary
way, a huge number of distribution lines is present, supplying
the loads directly (in the case of high-power loads) or after
voltage transformation in the case of residential or low-power
industrial loads (e.g., 400 V in Europe). Recently, renewable
energy generators, which produce a few kilowatts in the case of
residential photovoltaic systems, up to some megawatts in the
case of large photovoltaic and wind generators, have become
widely dispersed around the world, thus transforming the
present power system into a large-scale distributed generation
system incorporating thousands of generators, characterized by
different technologies, voltage, current, and power levels, as
well as topologies [6] [7]. Hence, their integration with the ex-
isting network is fundamentally changing the whole electrical
power system [8] [3]: the drawback of renewable energy power
plants is that their output is subject to environmental ﬂuctua-
tions outside of human control, i.e., clouds blocking the sun or
lack of wind, and these ﬂuctuations emerge on all timescales
displaying non-Gaussian behaviour [9] [10]. In addition, these
issues are further complicated by the aging infrastructure
of the existing power grid, which already cause problems
to utilities and customers, providing low power quality at
increasing cost. In particular, the power grid infrastructure is
very critical and contains a large number of interconnected
components: generators, power transformers, and distribution
feeders that are geographically spread. Moreover, its increasing
complexity and geographical spread, and the side effects
caused by the high penetration of renewable, stochastically
ﬂuctuating energy generators make it very vulnerable, both
from the point of view of required sophisticated security
mechanisms [11] and from the point of view of dynamic
stability, since renewable sources are usually employed by
microgrids in isolated modes to maintain their capability of
connecting and disconnecting from the grid [12]. Due to the
design of the current power grid as a centralized system where
the electric power ﬂows unidirectional through transmission
and distribution lines from power plants to the customer, the
control is concentrated in central locations and only partially in
substations, while remote ends, like loads, are almost or totally
passive. Therefore, it is necessary to design new systems that
provide more effective and widely distributed intelligent con-
trol embedded in local electricity production, two-way elec-
tricity and information ﬂows, thus achieving ﬂexible, efﬁcient,
economic, and secure power delivery [13]. The new approach,
widely known as Smart Grid [14], requires both a complex
two-way communication infrastructure, sustaining power ﬂow
between intelligent components, and sophisticated computing
and information technologies, as well as business applications.
The new approach will include grid energy storage, needed for
load balancing and for overcoming energy ﬂuctuations caused
by the intrinsic nature of renewable energy sources, in addition
to preventing widespread power grid cascading failures [15]

[16]. In particular, control is needed in power networks in
order to assure stability and to avoid power breakdowns or
cascading failures: one of the most important control goals
is the preservation of synchronization within the whole power
grid. Control mechanisms able to preserve synchronization are
ordered by their time scale on which they act: the ﬁrst second
of the disturbance is mainly uncontrolled, and in this case a
power plant will unexpectedly shut down with a subsequent
shortage of power in the system, energy is drawn from the
spinning reserve of the generators. Within the next seconds,
the primary control sets on to stabilize the frequency and to
prevent a large drop. Finally, to restore the frequency back to
its nominal value of 50 (or 60) Hertz, secondary control is
necessary. In many recent studies on power system dynamics
and stability, the effects of control are completely neglected
or only primary control is considered [17]–[22]. This control
becomes less feasible if the percentage of renewable power
plants increases, due to their reduced inertia [23] [24]. Few
studies are devoted to secondary control [25]–[27] and to time-
delayed feedback control [28]–[30].
The present extended abstract is organized as follows: In
Section II we present the main results, while in Section III a
discussion addressing the impact of the proposed research is
presented.
II. PROPOSED SOLUTION
We consider a two-layer network in a full dynamic descrip-
tion. It consists of a power grid layer and a communication
layer, which provides the control for the power grid. Each
layer is governed by its own dynamics, which is dependent
upon the state of the other layer. In particular, the physical
topology that relates the interconnection of distributed gen-
erators and loads is described by coupled Kuramoto phase
oscillators with inertia, closely related to the swing equations
[31], while the communication topology, which describes the
information ﬂow of the power system control measurements,
depends on the information of the neighbors of each node
[32]. Starting from the ideal synchronized state, we investigate
the effect of multiple different perturbations to which the
system is subject, modelling real threats to synchronization
of the network, e.g., failure of nodes, increased consumer
demand, power plants with stochastically ﬂuctuating output.
To describe the ﬂuctuating power output of renewable energy
power plants both Gaussian white noise and more realistic
intermittent noise have been used (see [33] for more details).
For each perturbation, different setups of the communication
layer are tested to ﬁnd an effective control strategy that
successfully preserves frequency synchronization against all
applied perturbations. As a proof of concept, the Italian high
voltage power grid has been considered. In the communication
layer we have assumed a selection of different control schemes
(control functions f diff
i
, f dir
i
and f comb
i
) and control topolo-
gies (adjacency matrices cloc
ij
and cext
ij ). All control schemes
take advantage of the second layer by collecting information
from adjacent nodes to calculate the control signal. This can be
done either in a local setting (cloc
ij ) where generators possess
the same communication links as in the power grid layer, or
in an extended control layer topology (cext
ij ) where additional
communication links between all generators are present. We
have tested (i) a control scheme aimed at synchronizing the
frequency of the controlled nodes with their neighbors (differ-
ence control f diff), (ii) a control scheme aimed at restoring
the original synchronization frequency in the neighborhood of
the controlled node (direct control f dir), and (iii) a mixed
approach combining both (f comb). The only control scheme
being able to effectively counteract all of the perturbations is
the difference control scheme f diff in the extended control
topology, while the direct control has some advantages in
the local control topology only. Moreover, the calculation of
different topological measures shows that nodes in the power
grid layer which are more affected by perturbations are not
characterized, in general, by speciﬁc topological features. It
turns out that the Italian power grid can be divided in two
speciﬁc parts: the northern, continental part, with a higher
average connectivity, which is more resilient to perturbations,
and the southern, peninsular part, characterized by a low
average connectivity. The elongated structure of the southern
part makes it less robust to perturbations.
III. CONCLUSION
The aim of this work is to investigate the controllability of
power networks subject to different kinds of perturbations and
to develop novel control concepts considering the communica-
tion infrastructure present in the smart grid. Few works have
included the communication layer into the synchronization of
power networks. Even though the communication infrastruc-
ture plays an important role in control and synchronization,
preliminary works [34] [35] assume trivial networks, without
disconnected nodes, which, however, is of great importance in
stabilizing smart grids, due to the necessity of synchronizing
grids with isolated generators, microgrids, or even coupled
microgrids that can be connected or disconnected to the main
grid at any time. Moreover, the inclusion of a communication
infrastructure has added new challenges in control and stability
[36], where communication constraints emerge, e.g., time-
delays, packet losses, sampling and data rate, among others,
but, up to now, attention has focussed on sampling problems
in order to assure that synchronization is independent on the
sampling period [32]. On the other hand, the same two-layer
topology, here implemented, has been already investigated in
[37] to understand how localized events can present a severe
danger to the stability of the whole power grid, by causing
a cascade of failures, but without considering the dynamics
of the control nodes. Here the focus of our investigation is
on the interdependence of the communication network and
the power grid: Random failure of a power plant causes
the malfunction of connected elements in the communication
layer. Communication nodes isolated due to the failure become
inert, causing generators connected to them to shut down as
well as eventually leading to a far-reaching blackout. In short,
our proposed control techniques preserve synchronization for
different perturbations [38], thus demonstrating the powerful

perspectives of our control approach which considers synchro-
nization of power systems based on the coupled dynamics of
the smart grid architecture and the communication infrastruc-
ture.
