Abstract—Parents or child-care personnel generally read aloud
to an infant, when infants who are not able to read characters
read a picture book. Infants are able to perceive the contents
of the book by listening to the voice and watching the pictures.
Therefore, reviews for picture books have different characteristics
than general book reviews. There are descriptions of an infant’s
reactions as well as descriptions of reviewer’s impressions in
reviews. We focus on descriptions of an infant’s reactions, and
analyze those extracted from reviews. Especially, in this paper,
we study the relation between the contents of picture books and
an infant’s developmental reactions. More speciﬁcally, we select
six typical expressions representing an infant’s developmental
reactions. Then, we analyze characteristics of picture books which
have sufﬁciently high frequency of those six expressions repre-
senting an infant’s developmental reactions. Moreover, we further
examine which characteristics of each picture book actually
contribute to letting infants show developmental reactions.

INTRODUCTION
Educational books generally focus on a speciﬁc subject to
be learned such as science and sociology. Picture books are,
on the other hand, exceptional because they are efﬁcient in
infants’ cognitive developments [1], having no intention on
speciﬁc educational subject with their style of expressions,
i.e., funny stories and pictures. Furthermore, readers of picture
books are parents or child care personnel who make the book
talk for infants who do not have sufﬁcient literacy yet. Infants
perceive and interpret incoming stimuli of the book talks and
the pictures. Thus, considering such a situation, picture books
are outstanding compared to other educational books, in that
those who read them are separated from those who perceive
them.
It is known in the research in the developmental psychology
that infants express a variety of cognitive reactions to the
external stimuli in accordance with their developmental stage.
Supposing that picture books work as those kinds of stimuli,
it is also expected that infants might express the cognitive
reactions when the stimuli of picture books are perceived.
Further considering that infants are free from understanding
the printed letters of picture books, this tendency might be
ampliﬁed to some extent.
In order to examine how the stimuli of picture books
induces a variety of reactions in infants, we take an approach
of applying a text mining technique to a large amount of
the reviews on picture books written by their parents or the
childcare personnel. Reviews for picture books have different
characteristics compared to general book reviews. There are
descriptions of an infant’s reactions as well as descriptions of
reviewers’ impressions in reviews. We focus on descriptions
of an infant’s reactions, and analyze those ones extracted
from reviews. Especially, in this paper, we study the relation
between the contents of picture books and an infant’s devel-
opmental reactions. More speciﬁcally, we select six types of
expressions representing an infant’s developmental reactions.
Then, we classify picture books according to the frequency
distribution of those types of expressions representing an
infant’s developmental reactions.
The results of the classiﬁcation show there exist picture
books drawing active children’s reactions and those that are
not. These facts imply picture book drawing active reactions
might have some advantageous factors in their directions. We
compare picture books drawing active reactions and those that
are not so as to specify the factors affecting the degree of
children’s reactions.

on picture books we utilize in this paper. Section III describes
infants’ reactions to picture books we examine in this paper.

analyze in this paper. Section V analyzes the characteristics

THE WEB SITE SPECIALIZED IN PICTURE BOOKS
To analyze the infants’ reactions, text data of reviews on
picture books are collected from EhonNavi [2], a Web site
specialized in picture books. EhonNavi provides information
concerning picture books such as publishers, authors, outlines
as well as a large amount of reviews written by the parents
or child care personnel, where the numbers of the titles of
the picture books included in EhonNavi amount to about
65,400. The number of the reviews amount to approximately
330,000 as of September 2016 (shown in Table I). Other than
EhonNavi, popular Web sites with a large amount of book
reviews include Amazon [3] and Booklog [4]. Out of them,
EhonNavi has a unique characteristic in that its reviews tend
to be elaborated, reﬂecting the reactions of those who make the
books talk, as well as those who perceive them. Additionally, it
is also the EhonNavi’s characteristic that the age of the infant is
attached to each review. All these characteristics are preferable
for our work aiming at detecting the infants’ reactions in
accordance with their developmental stages. Therefore, we
employ the reviews on EhonNavi for the analysis of this paper.
Figure
shows an example of a review of EhonNavi. As
shown in the ﬁgure, the header of each review includes the
age of the infant to whom the reviewer reads the picture book.
As described above, reviews on EhonNavi include descriptions
of book readers’ reactions, mixed with infants’ reactions. Since
reviewers are book readers in all the cases, infants’ reactions
described in reviews are those observed by reviewers.

INFANTS’ REACTIONS DETECTED IN REVIEWS ON
PICTURE BOOKS
According to the theory of developmental psychology,
infants express age speciﬁc reactions to incoming stimuli.
We collect such infants’ reactions that are speciﬁc to ages
ranging from 0 to 3 from publications or papers concerning
developmental psychology [5]–[8] and list them in Table II.
In this table, we list those six types of reactions in the order
from those observed in the early age 0 to those observed in the
later age 3. This result indicates that infants at their very early
age tend to react automatically with their physical expression,
such as pointing the ﬁngers, or grasping gestures, meanwhile,
those at their later ages tend to react consecutively expressing
their intention, such as game of make-believe, or asking why,
though some reactions are common over multiple ages.
Then, in order to collect typical expressions representing
each of the six types of infants’ reactions listed in Table II, we
randomly picked 345 reviews from 16 titles of picture books.
We manually examine those randomly picked 345 reviews and

collect typical expressions representing each of the six types
of infants’ reactions [9], [10]. In order to detect an infant’s
developmental reactions in reviews on picture books, Uehara et
al. [9], [10] previously studied 10 expressions representing an
infant’s developmental reactions with frequency. Out of those
10 expressions, we focus on those that are more frequently
observed, and allocate them to six types of infant’s reactions
as in the right hand side column of Table II.
According to the studies in developmental psychology [5]–
[8], the infants’ reaction “gaze at / stare hard / listen hard”,
“point ﬁngers”, and “pretend” are mostly observed around the
age of 1, “imitate” around that of 2, “game of make-believe”
around that of 2 to 3, and “enter into” and empathy around
that of 3.
IV.
SELECTING PICTURE BOOKS FOR ANALYSIS
Reviews including six expressions in Table II do not neces-
sarily represent infants’ reactions. Some of them represent their
parents’ reactions. In order to estimate the number of reviews
which include six expressions representing infants’ reactions
only, we apply the following estimating procedure.
Let f(b, a, e) be the frequency of an expression e out of
the six expressions, in a title b and for an age a. Let fs(b, a, e)
be the number of samples randomly selected from the reviews
belonging to each f(b, a, e). The maximum value of f s(b, a, e)
is set to be 10. Out of them we manually count the number of
reviews representing infants’ reactions. Let fsc(b, a, e) be this
number. Under these assumptions above, the estimated number
of infants’ reactions, fc(b, a, e) is expressed as the following
formula.
fc(b, a, e)
=
fsc(b, a, e)
fs(b, a, e) × f(b, a, e)
We set a threshold on the outcome of the formula above to
distinguish the picture books drawing active infants’ reactions
from the ones that are not. If applying formula above to any of
six expressions belonging to a picture book results in the value
≥ 10, the threshold, the picture book is recognized as the one
drawing active reactions. And those picture books fulﬁlling
this condition are classiﬁed into the set B≥10 as follows.
B≥10
=

b


a,e
fc(b, a, e) ≥ 10

Meanwhile, picture books not fulﬁlling this condition are
classiﬁed into the set B<10 as follows.
B<10
=

b


a,e
fc(b, a, e) < 10

We rank picture books in descending order of the number
of reviews and select the topmost 100 titles, where the total
number of the reviews of those 100 titles amount to around
27,000 (as of December 2014). Out of them, we found 45 titles
fulﬁll the condition of the set B≥10. 22 titles are internationally
published, and these are the ones for our analysis. Meanwhile,
we found 19 titles belonging to the set B<10. 6 titles are the
ones for our analysis which are also internationally published.
V.
ANALYZING CHARACTERISTICS OF PICTURE BOOKS
We found each picture book belonging to either set B ≥10 or
B<10 above, shows different distribution patterns of frequency
of the expressions described in Table II. We classify picture
books based on the distribution patterns, then make comparison
between the picture books belonging to set B≥10 and the
ones belonging to set B<10 both of which are in the same
characteristics of developmental reaction in Table II. By this
comparison, we try to specify the factors contributing to the
contrast in children’s reactions,
A. Representation of Picture Books
Table III shows two examples of picture books both of
which belong to set B≥10. Both of the expressions, “enter
into” and “empathy” form one category, because they repre-
sent the same developmental reaction as mentioned in Table II.
The distribution pattern of two examples shows obvious dif-
ference. Apparently infants’ reactions concentrate on “pointing
ﬁngers” in the case of Table III(a). Meanwhile, Table III(b)
shows diversities in expressions. In order to specify an infant’s
expressions of each picture book, we set the threshold as below.
Threshold for specifying an infant’s expressions:
The expressions with frequencies over 60 % of the
number of most frequent expressions.
Taking Table III(b) as an example, the most frequent reaction
is “pointing ﬁngers”. Frequencies of both of reactions “gaze
at” and “imitate” are over 60% of the number of “pointing
ﬁngers”, while frequencies of both of “pretend” and “game of
make-believe” are under the value. Then, an infant’s expres-
sions are “pointing ﬁngers”, “gaze at”, and “imitate”.
Meanwhile in the case of the picture books belonging to
set B<10, only the most frequent expression are used as an
infant’s expression.

mental Reactions in Reviews on Picture Books

multiple infant’s expressions belonging to set B≥10 are clas-
siﬁed into multiple categories. In such a case, the titles are
attached with hyphenated number, as in the column “Picture
Books Effective for the Reactions”.
Additionally, we make sub-categories under each expres-
sion as the column “The Intentions of Reactions” by manu-
ally interpreting contexts surrounding the expressions in the
reviews. Followings are the explanations of each sub-category.

orful illustrations.
(b) “pointing ﬁngers”
•

dence between narrations and the illustrations.
•

ence out from various kinds of illustrations.
(c) “imitate”
•
imitating to eat · · · Infants imitate to eat printed foods
on the picture books.
•

acters performance on the picture books.
(d) “game of make-believe”
•
reproduction of the story · · · Infants reproduce the
story after he/she listened to picture book readings.
(e) “enter into, empathy”
•
care about character’s situation · · · Infants express
their empathy for the characters’ painful situations.
“Ages” on the 3rd column represents the range of ages
at which the frequency of each expression exceed 10, the
threshold introduced in the previous section. The last column
“Picture Books Ineffective for the Reactions” in Table IV are
allocated ones from set B<10 which evoke weak reactions. If
there is no such picture book at all, the space is left blank.

C. Characteristics of Picture Books with Frequent Develop-
mental Reactions of Infants
The fact that there are picture books in each sub-category in
Table IV indicates that there exist types of picture books effec-
tive for infants’ reactions and types that are not so effective.
We compare effective picture books and ineffective ones by
each sub-category in Table IV to specify the features which
might realize the gap of infants’ reactions. The comparison
is limited to the sub-categories for which the column space
“Picture Books Ineffective for the Reactions” is not blank.
Followings are the results.
1)
gazing at faces:
Effective picture books have a very simple style. For
example, they contain scenes with repetitive peek-
a-boo gestures. Meanwhile, an example of ineffec-
tive picture book has a pop-up that might draw the
infants’ attentions on the pop-ups themselves. That
is, the infants’ interests on the peek-a-boo might be
interrupted by the pop-ups.
2)
ﬁnding correspondence:
Picture books effective for this reaction tend to il-
lustrate objects with the straight forward styles, and
corresponding texts appear with large and clear fonts.
These styles might make it easier for infants to be
aware of correspondence between illustration and the
texts.
3)
selecting preference:
In the case of effective picture books, a variety of
characters and their actions seem to draw the infants’
attention, thereby encouraging them to express their
preference by pointing ﬁngers. Ineffective picture
books tend to use the same characters and conven-
tional actions throughout the story.
4)
imitating to eat:
Picture books effective for this reaction are a kind
of food entertainment.Taking Guri and Gura as an
example, scene of baking sponge cake are effective
for raising infants’ expectations for eating. Also,next
scene of sharing sponge cake among lots of animals
depict deliciousness of sponge cake. Picture books

not effective for this reaction do not have any kind
of entertainment.
5)
reproduction of the story:
Effective picture books in this sub-category comprise
of scenes with repetitive rhythmical narration. This
simple rhythm seems to help infants understand-
ing stories impressively. On the contrary, ineffective
picture books have been found to be composed of
changing narrations with each scene without any
rhythm.
VI.
CONCLUSION
In this research, we classify picture books based on the
types of infants’ developmental reactions and try to specify the
factors contributing to each active reaction. Analysis implies
that infants’ reactions vary depending on various features of
picture books, such as clarity, rhythm, simplicity etc. Although
the research samples are limited, these ﬁndings will contribute
to constituting picture books so as to purposely draw speciﬁc
reactions. To establish this knowledge, we will expand our
analysis.
