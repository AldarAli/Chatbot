Abstract—The design and software implementation of a 
standard for International Patient Summary (IPS) is recently in 
the focus of several updates of major eHealth standards and 
technical specifications in European Union countries. The 
design goal of the final draft version of this European standard 
is to be implementation independent and to enable semantic 
interoperability in exchanging clinical data.  The paper makes a 
detailed analysis of the relations of this standard with other 
European projects. The objective of this paper is to implement 
the IPS standard making use of archetype concepts and 
demonstrates the implementation in a fully functional web 
application for exchange of IPS clinical data. The paper makes 
a detailed review of the dataset structure and the patterns used 
to describe the sections in the IPS standard focusing on the 
Medication summary section. On this basis two archetype 
models are created correspondingly with EN ISO 13606 and 
openEHR archetypes. A client-server  web application is 
developed to demonstrate the practical application of the 
archetype model using openEHR specifications. The discussion 
of the computer experiments leads to the conclusion that 
archetype models of the IPS standard can fully satisfy the 
objectives of this standard for cross- border semantic 
interoperability. The obtained results correspond to existing 
sample implementations of the IPS with Message paradigm 
technologies. These results are novel because for the first time 
they demonstrate the implementation in a client- server 
application of the IPS standard designed with archetypes.

INTRODUCTION 
Today people, businesses and data resources are globally 
connected. Every day a lot of people travel around the world 
or simply move from place to another in the country of their 
origin. This active way of life of modern people relates to the 
need of exchanging at least a minimum set of patient data 
between healthcare professionals. The availability of such 
data at the right time in case of unscheduled and in scheduled 
care is essential for providing quality health services. For 
example, in the outbreak of dangerous virus in one country, a 
person leaving this country may suddenly fell ill in another 
country. Then the assignment of proper treatment for this 
patient requires interoperability of services allowing to obtain 
among the rest the history of illnesses, allergies and the 
medications he or she used to take in the country of permanent 
stay. The requirement for establishing and maintaining a 
standard International Patient Summary (IPS) becomes 
imperative in times when huge amounts of people migrate 
from country, seek employment or better life abroad. 
The research work for the development of a standard for 
an International Patient Summary (IPS) has a long history [1]. 
It has started with the European Patients – Smart Open 
Services (epSOS) project having as a main objective to enable 
a service infrastructure for cross-border interoperability 
between Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems in Europe 
[2] [3]. This pilot infrastructure has been planned to allow a 
citizen from one EU country to receive relevant treatment for 
unscheduled health need in another country. The outcomes of 
this project have laid the foundations for sharing and 
exchanging patient summary and electronic prescription 
records. Research work has continued in several other EU 
projects like the Joint Action to support the eHealth Network 
project (JAseHN [4]) and the obtained results have been 
implemented in  the eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure 
(eHDSI [5]) or adopted by the eHealth Network (eHN [6] [7]).  
The European Commission for Standardization (CEN) in 
a collaboration with HL7 [8] [9]  produced final  draft versions 
correspondingly of a standard (EN 17269 [10]) and a technical 
specification (FprCEN/TS 17288 [11]) for an IPS. These two 
documents provide a detailed abstract specification of an IPS 
model from which concrete models can be derived and 
implemented. Therefore, the IPS model is described in terms 
of clinically relevant data set that is “minimal”, “specialty- 
agnostic and condition- independent”.  
The objective of this paper is to investigate these newly 
published documents from the perspective for software 
implementation of the proposed domain information model 
and the dataset specifications. For example, it is important to 
learn how well this IPS model can be expressed with  
EN ISO 13606 and openEHR [12]., where EN ISO 13606 [13] 
is the EU approved standard for semantic interoperability. The 
reason to explore this subject in EN 17269 is that the 
collaboration of CEN with HL7 has led to a rather unbalanced 
interpretation of the use cases in terms of software 
technologies exclusively related to HL7 FHIR [8] and HL7 
CDA [14]. Indeed the data set references to ISO 21090 [15]

make this model compatible with the data sets used in 
information models based on American Standards HL7 v3, 
HL7 FHIR or an EU standard like EN ISO 13606. On the other 
side, the IPS draft standard prEN 17269 does not provide 
guidance for implementing semantic interoperability in the 
exchange of IPS records. In fact, the draft version of 
FprCEN/TS 17288 provides just a short informative reference 
to EN ISO 13606 and openEHR archetypes, while semantic 
interoperability appears to be out of the scope of this IPS 
model. Moreover, the evaluation of the IPS model is presented 
only in terms of the Messages Paradigm of HL7 CDA and 
HL7 FHIR making use of a specific ART-DECOR template 
exchange format with Native XML databases (NXD) [16]. 
Besides, practical experience shows that the support for 
semantic interoperability of the Messages paradigm is 
problematic and it is difficult to scale it at national levels [17]. 
Our approach to evaluate the IPS model is based on 
designing and implementing the IPS document with archetype 
concepts 
satisfying 
the 
Archetype 
Object 
Models  
of EN ISO 13606 [18] [19] and openEHR [12]. It is a novel 
research work because it aims to evaluate newly published 
draft versions of a standard and the accompanying it technical 
specification for IPS, where the Archetype paradigm is 
superficially 
taken 
in 
consideration. 
Note 
that the  
ART-DÉCOR template format is not directly compatible with 
the Archetype Description Language (ADL) [19] [12]. The 
above formulated issues are currently poorly explored in the 
existing literature especially regarding their software 
implementation. In this paper, we take one of the required 
sections of the IPS as a case study to validate the application 
of our approach for introducing semantic interoperability 
support in the scenarios for managing IPS extracts. The details 
of our approach are as follows:  
• 
Implement 
the 
IPS 
Medication 
section 
in  
EN 17269 both in terms of EN ISO 13606 Archetype 
Object Model (AOM)and in terms of the openEHR 
AOM. 
• 
Explore the compatibility of the obtained EN ISO 
13606 Archetype conceptual design with respect to 
the requirements of an openEHR engine for running 
openEHR Operational templates. 
• 
Explore the W3C XML Schemas of IPS archetype 
conceptual models with respect to potential practical 
implementations of the proposed standard. 
• 
Develop a client- server application for testing the 
openEHR Operational template on an openEHR 
engine in a local and cloud environment. 
• 
Propose 
a 
methodology 
for 
transforming 
a  
EN ISO 13606 or openEHR archetype conceptual 
models into a format that enables the creation of 
archetype instances compatible with NXD. 
This paper is divided into sections as follows. In the 
following section, we review the genesis of the IPS standard 
and make an overview of the whole standard. A detailed data 
analysis for the Medication summary section of this standard 
is presented in Section III. In Section IV we design the IPS 
with archetype concepts employing well- structured archetype 
modeling methodology[20]. In Section V, we present our 
software implementation details. In Section VI, we summarize 
the obtained results and on this basis a methodology for 
implementing the Archetype paradigm with the IPS standard 
is proposed. Section VII summarizes the research results.   
II. 
BACKGROUND 
The development of IPS started as a “Patient Summary” 
(PS) service designed by the epSOS project (2008-2014) [2] 
to demonstrate the operation of a service infrastructure for  
cross- border interoperability between systems maintaining 
electronic health records in Europe. The clinical rationale that 
led to the definition of the PS dataset is founded on a 
normative use case scenario of unplanned care (emergency, 
accident). In this scenario a health professional of country B 
(country of treatment) gets access to essential information he 
needs to provide care or consult a patient from country A 
(country of origin).  
By definition [21](p.2) “An epSOS Patient Summary is a 
standardized set of basic patient data, which includes the most 
important clinical facts needed to ensure safe and secure 
healthcare”. The meaning of the variables included in the 
proposed PS dataset is described initially in Table 2 of the 
Guidelines on electronic data exchange (Release 1) [6] 
adopted  by the eHealth Network in 2013. The dataset is split 
into two groups of data, the Patient administrative data group 
and the Patient clinical data group. Both groups distinguish 
required fields (part of the Mandatory dataset) and optional 
fields (part of the Extended dataset) in the PS.  
It is noteworthy that from the very beginning the PS 
document is designed to be compliant to HL7 Common 
Document Architecture (CDA) Version 2, level 3 [14]. In 
accordance with this design decision a guide for the 
implementation of the PS with HL7 technologies has been 
published [22]. This way the PS document is built by a large 
number of sections and entry content modules derived from 
existing HL7 templates and using proprietary encoding. The 
initial clinical definition of terms in the PS dataset strongly 
depends on terminology and technical implementations in 
national infrastructures among European countries. The 
dataset definition itself lacks a common semantic structure 
based on standardized data types for information interchange. 
For example, the proposed translation and transcoding process 
causes ambiguous identification of a foreign patient. The 
Guideline on electronic data exchange (Release 2) [7] 
published  in 2016 only partially resolves patient privacy and 
security issues in the PS dataset design. On the other side this 
guideline presents a well-structured description of the use case 
for cross- border PS for unscheduled care and serves as a 
foundation for the development of the EN 17269 standard of 
the IPS and its technical specification, FprCEN/TS 17288.  
The EN 17269 standard overcomes the major limitations 
in the implementation of the PS. Its design goal is to be 
implementation independent; it is all about the IPS data and 
its logical definition. Unlike the PS, the EN 17269 standard 
for IPS is underpinned by the System of concepts to support 
continuity of care (Contsys) EN ISO 13940:2016 [23] and 
standard data types for information exchange like  
EN ISO 21090 [15] and HL7 FHIR [8]. For instance, Contsys 
concepts are used by this standard to interpret the primary use 

36

case of the PS in the epSOS project [5]. Moreover, the 
technical specification FprCEN/TS 17288 extends the scope 
of this primary use case to include four scenarios that are 
combinations of cross- border(international scale) and local 
(national scale) exchange of PS data with exclusive demands 
for unscheduled care and scheduled care. References to  
EN ISO 21090 datatypes support harmonization of the IPS 
with EN ISO 13606, openEHR, HL7 and FHIR. For example, 
a Coded element in the IPS standard represents a single 
concept that provides a reference to a terminology, code 
system or ontology such as SNOMED-CT [24]. Although the 
IPS standard employs an abstract data model that is 
implementation independent such kind of references and 
Contsys concepts enable semantic interoperability of 
documents satisfying the requirements of this standard. 
An IPS document in cross- border applications must be 
structured into the following six Required sections (Fig. 1) in 
order to claim full conformance with EN 17269: 
• 
Patient Attributes 
• 
Allergies and Intolerances 
• 
Medication Summary  
• 
Problems 
• 
Provenance  
• 
Cross- Border (conditional) 
In national scale scenarios the Cross-border section can be 
omitted. The three sections with clinical content (Allergies 
and Intolerances, Medication Summary and Problems) among 
these six sections are mandatory. In case no information is 
available for any of these sections, then a dedicated data 
element in such a section must state the reason for the absence 
of data. The IPS standard outlines a group of sections that are 
“required if known”, or the so- called group of Recommended 
sections (Immunizations, History of Procedures, Medical 
Devices and Patient’s Address Book). Data in these sections 
may not be universally available, may not be collected or such 
data like data in the “Patient’s Address Book” section is 
confidential in some aspect. There is also a group of Optional 
sections (Advance Directives, Functional status, History of 
Pregnancy, History of Past Illness, Plan of Care, Results, 
Social History and Vital Signs) that may be omitted in the IPS 
document without specifying any reason for it. For 
completeness, the EN 17269 standard allows to include 
optionally Non-IPS sections in the IPS document as well. The 
structure and content of such sections is not defined in this 
standard and it allows to the extend the IPS with condition- 
specific data. 
Figure 1.  Standard International Patient Summary sections.  
Each one of the IPS sections is represented by a 
hierarchical data structure, where nesting determines the 
hierarchical level of the data elements. Since the IPS standard 
is implementation independent the data elements are 
described in generic form making use of “patterns”. Most of 
these “patterns” correspond to “well- known” data types like 
Identifier, Coded element, Date- Time and Address. For 
clarity, the EN ISO 21090 datatypes are referenced to 
illustrate the expected main characteristics of the data 
element. Besides, when referring to an EN ISO 21090 
datatype it is not assumed that an IPS document 
implementation must comply with this standard. However, in 
our opinion compliance of datatypes of the data elements with 
EN ISO 21090 is a requirement is a necessary condition for 
ensuring semantic interoperability in cross- border exchange 
of IPS documents. 
Nowadays there exist only two trial implementations of 
the IPS standard that are reported in the existing literature. 
Both 
of 
them 
make 
use 
of 
the  
Message paradigm [17] and implement the IPS standard  
correspondingly 
with 
HL7 
FHIR 
[8] 
and 
with  
HL7 CDA R2 [9]. Both implementation guides share the same 
design principles and demonstrate the creation of IPS core set 
of sections as a templated document making use of pre-
existing CDA templates and Value sets. An important feature 
of these sample implementations is the use of terminologies 
like SNOMED CT [24], ATC [25], LOINC [26] , UCUM [27] 
for units of measures and EDQM [28] for dose forms and routs 
of administration.  
For example, the HL7 FHIR implementation of a 
Medication statement encodes the Medication Product 
Common Name and Medication Product code for the drug 
SIMVASTATIN in terms of its ATC code C10AA01 (Fig.2). 
Figure 2.  Representimg a Coded element in IPS implementations.  
The IPS standard does not consider the IPS dataset 
implementation in the clinical practice. Therefore, these two 
trial implementations of the IPS serve as a helpful resource for 
examples about how to interpret the data structure of IPS 
sections and the “patterns” used to describe the datatypes. The 
success or the failure of the IPS standard, however, strongly 
depends on making this standard acceptable for clinical use.  
There are several problems that remain to be resolved in 
order to make the trial implementations useful for the practice. 
One serious obstacle in this respect is providing user friendly 
access to terminology services and codes that enable semantic 
interoperability in cross- border exchange of IPS. Most of 
these resources are not freely available and identifying the 
desired code value is time consuming. Some other resources 
like the set of EN ISO IDMP set of standards [29] are not fully 
implemented in practice. Although the current IPS standard 
does not impose obligatory usage of terminology services and

codes, it is self-understood that semantic interoperability is 
impossible without binding clinical concepts and terms to a 
coding system. Another major problem that concerns the 
clinical practice is the management of IPS records. The trial 
implementations illustrate merely the interpretations of IPS 
data making use of HL7 related technologies that represent the 
view of the Message paradigm in Health informatics.  
At first glance it seems to be straightforward to accomplish 
mapping 
of 
datatypes 
between 
Message 
paradigm 
technologies and Archetype paradigm technologies because 
more or less these datatypes derive from EN ISO 21090. 
However, each one of these two major groups of technologies 
has their inherent limitations in terms of management of EHR 
like IPS data [30] [31] [32] [33]. This refers to storage and 
exchange of IPS data taking in consideration related issues of 
privacy and confidentiality regulations, language translation 
of clinical concepts and differences in national legislation as 
well as availability of tools for executing queries and data 
visualization. Finally, there should be a convenient way for 
transforming existing heterogeneous clinical data into a 
document structure that conforms to the IPS standard. In short, 
the available IPS implementation guides are too simplified 
and biased by the advantages and disadvantages of one of the 
existing paradigms in health informatics for exchange of 
clinical information. 
In the following sections we consider the IPS design from 
the perspective of the Archetype paradigm. For this purpose, 
we first analyze the data structure of a required section in the 
IPS standard. Next, we will implement this section in terms of 
archetype concepts. Unlike the existing IPS implementation 
samples we won’t just create a computer model of an IPS 
section. From practical point of view, it is important to 
investigate and discuss management of instances of the thus 
created IPS model. Therefore, we build a server- client web 
application and demonstrate IPS data management of 
archetype with this application.

III. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA MODEL 
Without loss of generality, we consider the Medication 
Summary section of the IPS standard, which is one of its six 
Required sections (Fig. 3).  
The hierarchical data structure and the data types used in 
this section are described in full details in Tables 15 and 16 of 
the EN 17269 standard (Fig. 3). The final draft version of this 
standard describes the same way the rest of the sections of the 
IPS, where the dataset borrows data types from EN ISO 
21090. Therefore, the same approach for can applied for 
analyzing the remaining sections of the IPS standard. The 
standard provides detailed description with all the information 
necessary for building a conceptual model of these sections in 
terms of archetype concepts.  
The “IPS Section: MEDICATION SUMMARY” is 
closely related to EN ISO IDMP set of standards and it is 
important part of European eHealth projects like the epSOS 
project. The IPS standard taking into consideration the limited 
scope of EN ISO IDMP implementations has relaxed the 
requirement for using IDMP notations and specifications by 
introducing high level of abstraction in concept descriptions. 
This way the IPS standard leaves the option for adopting 
IDMP notation and specification with Medication summary 
concepts, when they become available. 
The dataset of the Medication summary section comprises 
a Content status data element and a list of Medications. For 
clarity we keep the same names and order of introducing the 
data elements of the Medication Summary dataset as they are 
defined in the IPS standard. The Content status element is of 
type denoted in the IPS standard using the pattern Coded 
Element. The semantic meaning of this pattern with reference 
to Content status is a predicate taking for example, values true 
and false. When the Content status is true, then the list of 
Medications shall be not empty. Otherwise, the list of 
Medications shall be empty. 
Each one of the elements of the Medications list contains: 
• 
Reason 
• 
Medicinal product 
• 
Administration instruction 
The Reason element is Optional in the Medications list. It 
has the purpose to state, if known or allowed by the patient, 
the reason for the Medication prescription. 
The Medicinal product and the Administration instruction 
are Required datasets of elements that together provide a 
“minimal and non- exhaustive” description of that product. 
The following elements belong to the Medicinal product 
dataset: 
• 
Product code 
• 
Product common name( and strength) 
• 
Pharmaceutical dose form 
• 
Brand name 
• 
Active ingredients 
The Product code element is Optional, and its datatype is 
described with the pattern Coded element. The semantics of 
the product code description in the IPS standard implies a 
reference to some unique identifier from the EN ISO IDMP 
set of standards. However, the IPS does not impose such a 
requirement rather allows for using a more general code from

a terminology like ATC as shown in the sample 
implementation on Fig. 2.  
The Product common name (and strength) is a 
ReqiuredIfKnown element of type String. According to the 
IPS standard it is used to record in free text a non-proprietary 
name of the pharmaceutical product eventually including the 
strength of each ingredient. It should be consistent and 
associated with the Product code value. For example, once the 
Product code is selected from a given terminology 
classification (ATC) then this determines the Product 
common name (“simvastatin”) (Fig. 2).  
The Pharmaceutical dose form is a Required element 
described by a value described by the pattern Coded element. 
This element denotes the physical state of Medication (Solid, 
Liquid, Semi- Liquid and their variants). The codes for these 
states are listed in Table A.1 of  EN ISO 11239, which is one 
of the EN ISO IDMP group of standards. 
Brand name is an Optional element of type String. For a 
given Product code there could be multiple titles under which 
the medication is sold on the market. For example, given the 
ATC code C10AA01 the Brand name could be “Simvastatin 
40 mg Filmtabletten” or “Simvastatin 40 mg Tablets”. The 
standard recommends providing a Brand name always when 
it is justified by the healthcare professional or the medicinal 
product is of biological origin. 
The list of Active ingredients is represented by a set of the 
substances that separately or in combination produce the 
intended effect of applying the medicinal product. This list is 
a Required element in the Medicinal product dataset. The 
elements of the list are described in terms of Substance code 
and Strength. 
Substance code is a Required element described by a value 
described by the pattern Coded element. The IPS standard 
refers to codes in conformance with the EN ISO IDMP set 
standards and in particular, satisfying the information model 
for substance codes  EN ISO 11238:2018 like the Chemical 
Abstract Service (CAS) Registry Numbers, European 
Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances 
(EINECS), European Drug Codes (XEVMPD) and Japanese 
Drug Codes. The sample implementation of IPS by HL7 FHIR 
stores the Substance code in terms of its RxNorm [34] code 
and respective name (Fig. 4). 
Figure 4.  Sample representation of Substance code in the IPS standard.  
Currently, the IPS standard allows using “well- known” names 
for ingredients instead of IDMP or other terminology codes, 
for example, “paracetamol”.  
The Strength of the Active ingredient is a Required 
element described by a value described by a pattern termed as 
Ratio. When the IPS standard explains this pattern, it makes a 
reference to the RTO type in the EN ISO 21090 standard 
having numerator and denominator of type QTY (quantity), 
where the denominator shall be nonnegative (Fig. 5). 
Figure 5.  Sample representation the Strength of the Active ingredient.  
The Administration instruction dataset comprises the 
following data items: 
• 
Instruction 
• 
Period of medication use 
• 
Route of administration 
• 
Dose instruction 
Instruction is an Optional element of type Text providing 
textual information about the procedure to applying the 
Medication.  By default, it is used to summarize the content in 
the remaining three data elements of Administration 
instruction.  
Period of medication use is an Optional element of type 
described by the pattern Period in the IPS standard. The 
period is a general concept that could be implemented in terms 
of start and end dates or in terms of “floating” time for 
duration (“5 days”, or “1 month”).  
The Route of administration is an Optional element 
described by the pattern Coded element. For some reason a 
description for this element is missing for the Medication 
summary in the IPS standard. However, a clear description for 
it is provided in the EN ISO 11239 standard, namely, “path by 
which the pharmaceutical product is taken or makes contact 
with the body”. Moreover, Table A.9 in the same standard 
provides a list with examples for some of the most frequently 
used Route of administration values. 
Finally, Dose Instruction is a Required component of the 
Administration instruction dataset comprising two data 
elements, Number of Units per intake and Frequency of 
intake. Both data elements are Required and described 
correspondingly by patterns Range or Quantity and General 
Time Specification. The Number of Units per intake is 
represented by a numeric value and a measurement 
representation for the unit (“40 mg”, “2 tablets”). In a similar 
way the Frequency of intake identifies the number of intakes 
per a specified period (hour, day, week, month).

This detailed understanding of the data model is an 
important prerequisite for representing it with archetype 
concepts in the following section of this paper.  
IV. 
IPS DESIGN WITH ARCHETYPE CONCEPTS 
In this section we explore the design of a model of the IPS 
Medication Summary in terms of the Archetype paradigm. 
Additionally, compare the models of the IPS Medication 
Summary obtained by employing respectively, EN ISO 13606 
archetypes and openEHR archetypes in the design process. To 
achieve this objective, we follow a five- stage methodology 
for archetype design [20]. It allows us to transform correctly a 
clinical document like the IPS into an archetype conceptual 
model after the detailed analysis of its data model in the 
previous section. Some of the  most popular software tools for 
creating an archetype model are LinkEHR Studio [35], the 
Template Designer [36] and the Archetype Editor [37].  The 
Template Designer and Archetype Editor are more specialized 
and appropriate to employ with the openEHR AOM, while the 
LinkEHR Studio is more suitable for creating a EN ISO 13606 
AOM.  
These tools have the potential to bind semantic context to 
the archetype conceptual model from terminology servers and 
this way map terms to international standards like LOINC, 
ATC, SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and ICD [38]. It allows the 
IPS conceptual model to deliver meaningful, reliable, 
semantical clinical information at the point of care. At this 
stage, however, the IPS standard does not impose 
requirements to use multilingual international reference 
terminologies and in our research, we have followed strictly 
the text of this standard. For clarity, we preserve the names of 
the concepts, the semantics of the data types employed 
correspondingly with EN ISO 13606 and openEHR as well as 
the constraints on occurrences of the data elements the way 
they are specified in the final draft of the IPS standard. 
The design of a clinical document with archetype concepts 
requires good understanding of the dual- level information 
model in ISO 13606 and openEHR. This information model 
comprises a Reference model and Archetype model (Fig. 6). 
Figure 6.  W3C XML Schema of an IPS Section in EN ISO 13606 AOM.  
Figure 7.  UML class diagram of the openEHR Reference Model.  
Without loss of generality we shortly describe the 
Reference Model of openEHR because in the following 
section we will present a web application making use of this 
model. It is displayed in Fig. 7, where for clarity the diagram 
is simplified by omitting some classes like LOCATABLE and 
PATHABLE, corresponding to RECORD_COMPONENT in 
EN ISO 13606. The classes displayed with dark background 
are concrete classes and the rest are abstract classes. Once a 
patient creates an EHR or IPS document in particular, this 
patient is associated with a unique UID identifier. All 
references to openEHR patient data are made by means of this 
UID. Committed changes of the document are considered as a 
contribution and such contributions are represented by a new 
instance of class COMPOSITION. All contributions are 
identified by a version number related to the UID of the EHR. 
This way a FOLDER instance serves as a container for a 
versioned 
structure 
of 
COMPOSITION 
instances 
(contributions for a given EHR). The COMPOSITION 
instances contain all the information in the clinical document 
which is the IPS in our case. The base definition of class 
COMPOSITION needs to be enriched in each given case of 
EHR with semantic constraints specific to this case. This 
happens by creating an archetype of type COMPOSITION in 
the Archetype Object Model. Further on, archetypes of 
COMPOSITION type are organized in Templates that 
facilitate reusability of archetypes. It is noteworthy that the 
latest edition EN ISO 13606-2:2019 has introduced templates 
as part of its archetype object model as well. A Template 
allows to dynamically update the semantic structure of the 
clinical document by adding slots for splitting the 
COMPOSITION archetype into multiple SECTIONs, which 
can be further on structured into archetypes, representing 
semantic constraints determined by the clinical practice as 
OBSERVATION, EVALUATION, INSTRUCTION and 
ACTION. The data ITEMs are in the leaves in this tree

structure, where concrete data ELEMENTs may exist 
standalone or organized in CLUSTER groups (list or tree). 
The data types assigned to each ELEMENT derive from class 
the abstract class DATA_VALUE. The openEHR datatypes 
derive from EN ISO 13606.  
All of these allow us to make the conclusion that the IPS 
can be designed according to the dual- level information 
model in EN ISO 13606 and openEHR. This model allows not 
only to reproduce the structural constraints in the IPS 
document. It enables semantic interoperability, flexibility and 
reuse of the archetype concepts. Instead of using predefined 
XML schemas (templates) in HL7 CDA and HL7 FHIR the 
dual- level information model allows to develop custom 
archetype concepts that accommodate the specific needs in the 
clinical practice. A great advantage in using the Archetype 
paradigm is the introduction of a common information model 
for validation the template instances in EN ISO 13606 and 
openEHR. 
The IPS standard represents this clinical document as a 
tree hierarchical of sections, where each section is composed 
of datasets that can be designed as clusters (lists or trees) of 
data elements. The IPS Medication Summary data model is a 
typical example of this kind. A Mind map of this data model 
designed with archetype concepts from EN ISO 13606 allows 
to visualize the structure of the conceptual model as a single 
archetype (Fig. 8). This model maps exactly the hierarchical 
structural constraints of the IPS Medication summary as 
described in the IPS standard to semantically correct 
structures within the archetype model.  
At the highest level we observe the CONTENT_STATUS 
(Content status) and the  LIST_OF_MEDICATION 
(Medications), where each element MEDICATION of this list 
is 
a 
tree 
structure 
of 
 
REASON 
(Reason), 
MEDICINAL_PRODUCT 
(Medicinal 
product) 
and 
ADMINISTRATION_INSTRUCTION 
(Administration 
instruction). For comparison purposes, the names of the 
respective data elements in the IPS are placed in brackets. All 
the occurrences, cardinalities and data types of the elements 
in the leaves of this hierarchical structure are assigned in 
accordance with the semantic interpretation of the patterns in 
the 
IPS 
standard. 
These 
settings are denoted 
on  
Fig. 9, where the archetype models correspondingly, in  
EN ISO 13606 (left side) and openEHR (right side), are 
displayed. 
In technical terms, the creation of an archetype model with 
openEHR first requires to design with the Archetype Editor an 
archetype a type COMPOSITION archetype (representing the 
whole IPS) with slots for SECTION archetypes for each of the 
sections of the IPS, create the  SECTION archetypes 
themselves (representing each of the sections of the IPS) as 
well as specialized ENTRY archetypes (representing the 
CONTENT_ITEM in each one of the IPS sections) like 
OBSERVATION, EVALUATION, INSTRUCTION or 
ACTION. For example, the contents of the Medication 
Summary section have been created as an INSTRUCTION 
specialization of the ENTRY archetype because medication 
orders or multi- drug courses in the clinical practice 
instructions are considered as instructions. Next, a template 
can be created with the Template Designer, where all the 
above archetypes get assembled into a single archetype model 
of the IPS. Once the constraints of the Reference model are 
satisfied this template to be exported as Operational template 
to a openEHR platform for managing instances of the thus 
created archetype model. The procedure is similar in the case 
of creating a EN ISO 13606 archetype model with LinkEHR 
Studio.  
The conceptual design of the IPS section of the archetype 
models can be explored in W3C XML Schema format as well. 
This approach to investigate the IPS conceptual model is a 
novelty in the existing literature because a W3C XML Schema 
Definition Language (XSD) model of the IPS is not presented 
in the proposed prEN 17269 standard. At the same time, its 
practical implementation implies the use of web services, 
where the XSD model specification is important. This model 
is suitable for implementations in NXD, where XQuery can 
serve as a good replacement for the absence of an Archetype 
Query Language in the AOM of EN ISO 13606. For 
comparison, the XSD model of openEHR concepts includes a 
lot of metadata payload. Real- life IPS applications process 
large numbers of openEHR XSD model instances.  
Finally, we note that in the existing literature there is 
evidence that openEHR archetypes can be transformed to  
EN ISO 13606 archetypes making use of the common ISO 
21090 data set [39] The mapping from EN ISO 13606 to 
openEHR is not explored so far. As a side result, we have 
established that it is not possible to convert EN ISO 13606 
archetypes directly into openEHR archetypes.  
The reason is that the concrete class ENTRY from the 
Reference model of EN ISO 13606 is mapped to the abstract 
class ENTRY in the Reference model of openEHR. Therefore, 
we can export a EN ISO 13606 archetype into a valid 
openEHR Operational template. However, it is not possible to 
create instances of that template. In openEHR there are 
concrete 
specializations 
of 
class 
ENTRY 
like 
OBSERVATION, EVALUATION, INSTRUCTION and 
ACTION. Hence, it is very difficult to map a concrete 
ENTRY class in EN ISO 13606 to some of these 
specializations of the openEHR class ENTRY. 
Once the openEHR archetype model is built the 
conceptual model can be exported to valid openEHR 
Operational template. Thus, in contrast to the existing 
implementation guides of the IPS, which merely publish XML 
schemas adapted to the IPS standard, we demonstrate the 
obtained archetype model in action. In the following section 
we show results of execution and testing the obtained 
openEHR conceptual model in a client- server application 
making use of an openEHR engine for processing instances of 
the Operational template for the Medication Summary section. 
Without loss of generality the whole IPS can be designed with 
archetype concepts in the above described way.

V. 
SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION 
The software implementation of the IPS conceptual 
models in a client server application has been developed with 
the objective to evaluate the applicability of the Archetype 
paradigm in implementing the proposed IPS standard. For this 
purpose, the openEHR Operational template of the 
Medication Summary section has been installed and run on 
both a local CaboLabs openEHR platform [36] and a cloud- 
based Code4Health platform [40]. Here we present results 
from a local installation of an openEHR server. 
Initially, the Operational template for the Medication 
Summary section is uploaded on the openEHR server and an 
EHR UID is created for a given patient. On Fig. 10 there are 
two patients registered with their UIDs. The different versions 
of updates of the IPS for the second patient in the list are 
displayed as his Contributions on the same figure.  
These Contributions are created and managed by a client 
web application. This web application employs the RESTful 
API published by the openEHR server to manage instances of 
the Operational template that actually are XML documents 
validated with respect to the information model of openEHR.

Figure 10.  Registered EHR UIDs and versioned Contributions. 
The client application at this stage operates in two modes, 
“writer” (update, add or delete content) and “reader” (read 
only content). Snapshots of the client application are shown in 
Fig. 12 and Fig.13.  
The graphical user interface of the client is custom 
designed in PHP. The combo box on the right upper side 
allows to load an existing contribution or create blank form by 
the patient, whose EHR UID is displayed below the title of the 
form. The combo box on the left upper side allows to select an 
existing Medication in the Medication summary section and 
display details for it in the fields of the form. Currently, for 
the registered patient we demonstrate in Fig. 12 and Fig.13 the 
contents of two Medication. One of them is the same drug, 
SIMVASTATIN, used in the sample implementation guide 
for the IPS produced by HL7 FHIR. With this we want to 
demonstrate that the conceptual model implemented with 
archetype concepts can handle the same use cases of the IPS 
as those included in the existing in the literature. For example, 
the input on Fig. 13 for Product code (PRODUCT_CODE on 
Fig. 9, right side) and System the (PRODUCT_CODE on Fig. 
9, right side) match completely those input in the sample HL7 
FHIR template. Besides, the data elements holding these input 
values are part of the archetype model and respectively, they 
are effectively exchanged and managed in the communication 
between the client and the openEHR server. Note that the 
input for PRODUCT_CODE is required in the IPS standard. 
However, this way we show that the obtained archetype model 
can be extended to serve bindings with terminology 
specifications and notations. For clarity, we have extended the 
model by adding input identifying the measures for units and 
frequency when recording Dose instructions. Moreover, we 
have used data published in EN ISO 11239 to populate with 
standard coded terms the combo boxes for Pharmaceutical 
dose form and Route of administration. Additionally, the 
Medication summary form provides default values, where 
possible and a calendar wizard for input of dates. The 
objective in the client form design has been to enhance the 
user experience in dealing with IPS. 
The buttons in the bottom of the form allow adding a new 
Medication to the list of Medications in the IPS as well as new 
Active ingredient to a Medication. The web application is fully 
functional and demonstrates that contents of the IPS can be 
exchanged employing an information model designed with 
archetype concepts. Further on IPS exchange can be extended 
to take place between openEHR servers serving as access 
points and this way enable true cross- border exchange of IPS 
data. As far as we know this sample web application is the first 
operational sample implementation of the IPS standard. 
VI. 
DISCUSSION 
In this paper, we have evaluated the applicability of the 
Archetype paradigm in software applications that implement 
the draft version of the IPS standard. Although the Archetype 
paradigm is not in the focus of this standard, we have 
demonstrated that it can be successfully employed in software 
applications.  
The practical experience in producing the here reported 
results allow us to propose a methodology for applying the 
proposed IPS standard in use cases where semantic 
interoperability is a requirement (Fig. 11).  
Figure 11.  Methodology for semantic interoperability of the IPS.  
The first stage in this methodology is to create a correct 
conceptual model of the IPS document. The archetypes in this 
model serve as “plug-and-play” building blocks for semantic 
interoperability that can be imported from a repository known 
a Clinical Knowledge Manager. At this stage we just note to 
the important requirement for binding of the archetype model 
to terminology servers for specifications and notations. 
Therefore, it would be useful by the next version of the IPS 
standard to obtain well organized and structured  public access 
not only to the promised standard set of SNOMED-CT code 
set, but also access to other registers for international codes, 
specifications and terms mentioned in this standard. The 
obtained archetype conceptual model is ready for reuse in 
software applications. Clients select an archetype conceptual

model and manage instances of that model in terms of 
semantic interoperability. Unlike the Messaging Paradigm the 
implementation of the Archetype paradigm with the proposed 
IPS standard makes possible all data, information and 
knowledge in each system to be available in a uniform and 
standard way.  
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper investigates the design and software 
implementation of the International Patient Summary 
according to the final draft versions of EN 17269 and 
FprCEN/TS 17288.  These versions make use exclusively of 
HL7 FHIR and HL7 CDA technologies with the purpose to 
develop a single, common specification of the minimal and 
non- exhaustive set of clinical data that can be used by all 
clinicians for cross- border, unscheduled care of a patient. 
In this paper we have presented a detailed analysis of the 
dataset of the IPS standard with a focus on the IPS Medication 
summary section. The design objectives of this standard are to 
make it implementation- independent. It attempts to 
harmonize requirements among the existing standards and 
specifications. However, our analysis of the genesis of IPS 
standard and existing sample implementation guides shows 
that it is biased by the Message paradigm information model 
and data set. Therefore, in this paper, we explore how the 
objectives of this standard can be achieved by applying the 
Archetype paradigm approach. Especially because the 
Archetype paradigm is implemented by the EN ISO 13606 
standard which is the leading standard for health information 
exchange approved in the European Union. In the literature it 
is recognized that reusability and semantic interoperability of 
clinical data like the IPS sections are delivered essentially in 
terms of Archetype concepts. Since the IPS sections in  
EN 17269 have quite a similar structure then the here obtained 
results can be extended and design the whole IPS in terms of  
EN ISO 13606 and openEHR archetype concepts. Both 
archetype models support binding to semantic context 
provided by terminology servers like SNOMED-CT.  
We have established that the EN ISO 13606 AOM cannot 
be used to create instances compatible with the openEHR 
AOM. It is an important conclusion because the compatibility 
of transformation from EN ISO 13606 to openEHR has not 
been confirmed in the existing literature. The numerical 
experiments demonstrate that both archetype models can be 
exported in W3C Schema definitions, where the XSD of 
openEHR AOM contains considerably larger payload of 
metadata. Therefore, it is preferable to manage instances of 
openEHR archetype models by means of operational 
templates on native openEHR platforms or relational 
databases with API support for publishing web services. 
It is noteworthy that the current versions of the IPS 
standard and its technical specification do not consider an 
XSD model of the IPS. At the same time, practical 
implementations of this standard rely on web services where 
the specification of the XSD models is important. We have 
demonstrated this approach in a client server application with 
real medicinal data and terminology codes, where the same 
operational template of the IPS section can run both on a local 
and on a cloud-based openEHR engine. Implementation 
details are reported in related research work [41] [42] 
Accordingly, instances of EN ISO 13606 archetypes can be 
managed in NXD as it is demonstrated in the use cases of  
FprCEN/TS 17288 with HL7 concepts.  
In our future work, we first plan to explore the feasibility 
of executing an EN ISO 13606 archetype model of the IPS on 
a NXD. At the same time, we will try to improve the user 
interface experience for managing the IPS in client 
applications. In addition, we plan to create a complete 
Archetype model of all the sections in the IPS standard. 
Finally, we will continue work directed on exchanging bulk 
data between servers that provide support for EN ISO 13606 
or openEHR. 
In summary, the obtained results are presented in a 
uniform methodology for implementing the IPS in terms of 
the Archetype paradigm. These results are novel because the 
Archetype paradigm is not considered in the final draft version 
of the IPS standard and implementation guides in the existing 
literature. They serve to extend the practical experience in 
cross-border sharing of clinical data represented in terms of 
semantic interoperability of archetype concepts.
