Abstract— Many people run to maintain or improve their 
health. If we can monitor our own form during daily running, 
it is useful in designing our own health promotion for effective 
exercise. The ground reaction force is a way of quantitatively 
evaluating a running form. Therefore, to obtain ground 
reaction force as health information with light burden to 
runners, this study will develop a wearable estimation method 
of ground reaction force. So far, we have established a method 
during walking using 15 inertial measurement units. Therefore, 
this report applies it and estimates ground reaction forces in 
two directions while running. Furthermore, we propose to 
reduce the number of sensors to 5 using correlation between 
accelerations so that the runner can more easily perform the 
measurements. The estimated values by each proposed method 
are compared with the measured values. The results showed 
that the high accuracy of the vertical ground reaction force 
was maintained after the reduction, but in the anterior-
posterior direction, the high accuracy was not achieved.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
One of the sports to promote health is jogging and 
running. Due to its simplicity, about 10% of the population 
in Japan practices it [1]. In addition, many wearable devices 
(such as smart watches) that record running motion are 
commercially available. Many of these provide data such as 
distance, average speed, altitude differences, calories, and so 
on. If the running activity is performed using correct form, a 
beneficial effect for health can be expected; however, if an 
incorrect form is used, it may cause damage to the knees and 
foot soles. However, a simple smart watch cannot easily 
monitor a person's running form.  
The Ground Reaction Force (GRF) is a way of 
quantitatively evaluating a form [2]. The magnitude and 
phase of GRF can indicate the quality of the form. 
Conventionally, GRF is measured by using an installation 
type or sole mounting type force plate, which is expensive, 
causes an uncomfortable form, and cannot measure a long 
distance. Therefore, this study develops a wearable system 
that can easily monitor GRF during daily running. Obtaining 
GRF, which can assess running form, as a one of health 
information could be useful in designing one's own health 
promotion for effective exercise.  
So far, we have proposed a method to estimate GRF 
during walking without using Force Plate (FP) [3]. In this 
estimation system, the whole body is divided into 15 parts. 
The inertial force of each part is derived from the dynamic 
acceleration measured by Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) 
attached to each part. In the vertical direction, the sum of the 
inertial force of each part and the gravity balances GRF, so 
that GRF during walking can be estimated. Similarly, in the 
anterior-posterior direction, the sum of the inertial forces of 
the respective parts balances GRF.  
There are three major differences between running and 
walking. First, running is a faster movement, so the 
acceleration is large and the impact force is large. Second, 
when running, there is no two-leg support period. Third, 
there is a period when neither foot is on the ground (referred 
to as the "aerial period" in this report). Thus, in this report, 
we experimentally examine whether the estimation method 
for walking with IMUs described above can be applied to 
running. At this time, the GRF is corrected for the aerial 
phase. Furthermore, we propose to reduce the number of 
sensors mounting positions from 15 to 5 using the correlation 
so that the runner can more easily perform the measurements. 
In addition, the accuracy in estimation is examined. In this 
estimation, the vertical and the anterior-posterior directions 
are targeted. Section II describes an estimating method for 
GRFs and running experiments. Section III proposes a 
method to reduce the number of sensors and confirms the 
accuracy from experimental results. Finally, Section IV 
presents the conclusions.  
II. 
ESTIMATION OF GRFS DURING RUNNING 
In this study, the whole body is divided into the 15 parts 
shown in Table 1, referring to the work by Ae et al. [4]. An 
inertial force of each part is derived from a mass of each part 
mi and each dynamic acceleration ai, and when these are 
added, the total inertial force of the whole body is obtained. 
The sum of the total inertial force and the gravity balances 
the vertical GRF. If the whole body mass is M, then the 
vertical GRF Fz can be expressed by (1).

Furthermore, the anterior-posterior GRF is derived by 
removing the gravitational term and replacing the vertical 
acceleration with the anterior-posterior acceleration, in (2).  
To examine the accuracy of this proposed method, 
running experiments are performed. Three healthy Japanese 
male volunteers (Age: 21.3±0.7, Height: 1.69±0.03[m], 
Weight: 68.3±0.2[kg]) participated. This experiment is 
approved by the Kochi University of Technology Ethics 
Review Committee.  
In the experiments, 15 IMUs (MTw2, Xsens), a Motion 
Capture (MC, MAC3D, Motion Analysis) for obtaining the 
true value of acceleration, and three FPs (one TF-6090 and 
two TF-4060, Tec Gihan) for obtaining the true value of 
GRF are used. Each IMU is attached to the center of mass 
[4] of the 15 body parts shown in Table 1, and a marker for 
MC is attached on IMU (Figure 1). Three free-running 
measurements per subject. The sampling frequency is 
100[Hz], and the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter for 
smoothing is 9[Hz].  The comparison target is the 5th to 7th 
step on the FPs.  
By substituting accelerations measured by IMUs and MC 
 
 
MC marker on IMU
 
Figure 1.  Positions where IMUs and MC markers are attached 
into (2), the GRFs in the vertical and anterior-posterior 
directions are derived.  Furthermore, the GRFs during the 
aerial period are corrected. The reason for the correction is 
that the inertia forces calculated from the body part 
acceleration are not zero because each body part is moving 
even during the aerial period. In other words, the GRFs 
derived from the accelerations during the aerial period are 
not zero. Therefore, the aerial period is estimated based on 
the vertical dynamic acceleration of the upper trunk, and 
only the GRFs during the aerial period is corrected to zero.  
The experimental results for one trial of one subject are 
shown. Other trials have obtained similar results. Figure 2 
shows the GRFs estimated from IMUs (blue) or MC (orange) 
and measured by FPs (gray).  
In the vertical GRFs shown in Figure 2(a), the estimated 
waveforms obtained by MC and IMUs matched very well 
with the FPs as the true value. The Mean Absolute Error 
(MAE) with the true value was 127.4 [N] for IMU and 
96.0[N] for MC. The correlation coefficient was 0.943 for 
IMU and 0.953 for MC. However, the spike wave 
immediately after grounding that appears at FP could not be 
detected at IMU and MC. On the other hand, the anterior-
posterior GRF in Figure 2(b) showed a difference in peak 
magnitude compared to FPs value for both MC and IMUs. In 
addition, phase differences also occurred in the estimated 
values. In the anterior-posterior direction, the MAE with the 
true value was 42.1[N] for IMU and 34.6[N] for MC. The 
correlation coefficient was 0.842 for IMU and 0.848 for MC. 
So, it was found that the accuracy in the anterior-posterior 
direction was lower than in the vertical direction. Moreover, 
although we were concerned about a loss of accuracy in the 
acceleration measurement with the IMU, in this case, the two 
estimated GRF methods by IMU or MC had almost 
waveforms, and errors introduced by the IMUs were not a 
problem.  
III. 
REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF MEASURED PARTS 
Section II estimated GRFs using the accelerations of all 
15 parts of the body. This section proposes to reduce the 
number of parts to be measured, that is, the number of IMUs, 
to simplify the measurement.  
In the proposed reduction method, when the acceleration 
values of multiple parts show similar tendency, a 
representative part is selected, and the acceleration of the 
representative part replaces the acceleration of the remaining 
parts. In other words, only accelerations of the representative 
parts are used to estimate GRFs, thereby reducing the 
number of measurement points.  
A specific method is described. First, the acceleration 
values measured in the previous experiment are classified 
into the following three groups with similar tendency.  
(A) Head, Upper trunk, Lower trunk 
(B) Upper arm, Forearm, Hand 
(C) Thigh, Shank, Foot 
In fact, the total number of groups is 10, since each group is 
classified for each direction and for each side. Next, an 
equivalent acceleration is derived for each group. The 
equivalent acceleration is obtained by dividing the sum of 
the inertial forces of the considered parts by the sum of the 
22

considered parts masses. For example, the equivalent 
acceleration of group A in the vertical direction a’eqAz is 
obtained by

Subsequently, using the measured values of the previous 
experiment, the equivalent acceleration is compared with the 
acceleration of each part in the group based on the 
correlation coefficient. As an example, Table 2 shows the 
results of group A in the vertical direction. From Table 2, the 
upper trunk with the highest correlation is selected as the 
representative part. In this way, representative parts are 
determined for each of the remaining 9 groups. As results, in 
this study, the five representative parts in the vertical 
direction were the upper trunk, right and left forearms, and 
right and left thighs. On the other hand, the five 
representative parts in the anterior-posterior direction were 
the upper trunk, right and left forearms, and right and left 
shanks.   
Hence, for example, the vertical GRF Fr_z using only the 
representative part accelerations can be estimated by

The results of the same trial as in Section II, with this 
proposed reduction method and correction in the aerial 
period, are shown. Figure 3 shows GRFs obtained from the 
five accelerations measured by IMUs or MC, and from FPs.  
In the vertical GRF shown in Figure 3(a), no spike wave 
could be detected as before the reduction (Figure 2(a)). In 
addition, the waveforms near the peak values of the right 
foot (5th and 7th steps) were collapsed and the phase also 
differed. The MAE with the output value of FP as the true 
value was 142.7[N] for IMU and 147.6[N] for MC. The 
correlation coefficient was 0.928 for IMU and 0.925 for MC. 
However, generally similar tendency could be read for both 
IMU and MC, and there was no difference in the peak value 
from the true value. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the 
estimated GRFs by IMU and by MC agree well, as they did 
before the reduction. Therefore, the accuracy of vertical 
acceleration measurements using the IMU was good. On the 
other hand, for the anterior-posterior GRF in Figure 3(b), 
although the general shapes were somewhat similar, both the 
waveform, peak value, and phase differed from the true 
value. The MAE with the true value was 55.6[N] for IMU 
and 55.6[N] for MC. The correlation coefficient was 0.693 
for IMU and 0.765 for MC.  
Moreover, the effect of reducing the number of sensors 
from 15 to 5 is discussed. For the vertical direction, from 
Figures 2(a) and 3(a), there is some error in the waveform 
after the peak value, but the reduction in accuracy is small. 
For the anterior-posterior direction, from Figures 2(b) and 
3(b), the timing of the increase/decrease is the same, but 
errors occur, especially in positive magnitude.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study, an estimation method used for the walking 
motion was applied to the running motion to estimate GRFs 
using wearable IMUs. As results, it was confirmed that the 
vertical GRF value estimated from the accelerations 
measured by the IMUs matched the measured FP value with 
good accuracy. However, due to the limitation of the 
sampling frequency of the IMU used, the spike wave 
immediately after grounding could not be obtained in this 
report. Since the IMU with a sampling frequency of 100[Hz] 
was used in this experiment, this problem could be solved by 
using a sensor that can measure at a sampling frequency of 
200[Hz] or higher. On the other hand, the estimated anterior-
posterior GRF value has low accuracy. Since the anterior-
posterior acceleration values are small, the rotational 
misalignment of IMU during running has a significant effect 
on the estimation accuracy. The results using MC were 
estimated closer to FP than using IMU. Therefore, we 
believe that IMU mounting method needs to be improved. 
Moreover, we proposed a method of reducing the number of 
sensors using equivalent acceleration and correlation 
coefficients. In the vertical direction, the estimated GRF after 
the reduction was slightly less accurate than before the 
reduction but was almost the same as the measured value. In 
other words, the proposed reduction method maintained high 
accuracy. On the other hand, in the anterior-posterior GRF, 
the accuracy was further reduced compared to that before the 
reduction. In addition, the phase shift became larger. This 
result also suggests that one factor in the low accuracy is the 
misalignment of IMU. Furthermore, another factor was that 
representative body parts were selected based only on the 
correlation coefficient of acceleration, and we would like to 
consider adding the characteristic points of the waveform in 
the future. One factor was that representative body parts 
were selected based only on the correlation coefficient of 
acceleration, and we would like to consider adding the 
characteristic points of the waveform in the future. From the 
above, we have established a wearable estimation method for 
vertical GRF during running that reduces the burden on 
runners.  
In the future, to improve the estimation accuracy of the 
two-directional GRF, we will consider the selection of 
appropriate sensor system and mounting methods and the 
introduction 
of 
frequency 
analysis 
to 
capture 
the 
characteristics of the waveforms, as described above. In 
parallel with these, we will explore the applicability of the 
proposed method to motions with higher running speeds. 
Furthermore, we will attempt long-distance running with 
IMUs, although this report we only measured two steps for 
verification purposes. In this case, we consider using a 
Kalman filter to compensate for the drift error, which is 
generally a problem for long-time measurements in IMU.
