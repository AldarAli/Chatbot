Abstract—The number of people suffering from Alzheimer’s 
disease is increasing. In a world which is more and more 
dependent on computing and Internet, this group of users is 
be-coming technologically isolated, due to the ill-suited design 
of user interfaces. Thus, in this paper, we propose a set of 
accessibility guidelines for designing user interfaces for adults 
diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. These guidelines are 
identified after a comprehensive review of the literature. We 
identify 147 design guidelines that are grouped under 11 
categories and 9 criterions. The aim of this work is to ensure 
that software applications and websites become accessible and 
easy to use to this demographic. The result of this work is a set 
of design guidelines, helpful for developers, designers, content 
producers, researchers and usability specialists. The proposed 
set of accessibility guidelines were applied for designing the 
user interfaces of a software application that target 
Alzheimer’s patients (CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis).  
Then, we evaluated the accessibility of the developed user 
interfaces. 24 Alzheimer’s disease patients entered the study. 
The results confirmed that the developed user interfaces are 
accessible.

 INTRODUCTION 
The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is 
increasing rapidly [1]. The AD association reports that, in 
2016, the worldwide prevalence of this disease is estimated 
at nearly 44 million cases. With aging of the population [1]-
[4], this number will increase to more than 86.7 million cases 
by the year 2050 [1]. The annual incidence worldwide is 
estimated at 1.25 million cases, which is the equivalent of 
one new case every 25 seconds.  
Individuals with AD present particular changes that differ 
from other user groups; parts of them are related to AD and 
the other parts are related to the expected effects of age. 
These changes impair individuals living with AD to use 
standard user interfaces. The difficulty in using user 
interfaces prevents individuals with AD from using software 
application and websites that can very well enhance their 
quality of life [5]. 
The design of user interfaces dedicated to AD patients 
should take into account their special needs to be accessible 
and easy to use [5]. 
A considerable amount of published works focused on 
designing user interfaces for older adults or people suffering 
from dementia. However, to the best of our knowledge, there 
is no work that defines a set of design guidelines for 
designing accessible user interfaces for AD patients. 
The motivation for this paper arises from the growing 
number of AD patients and the number of technological 
advances that can enhance the lives of the AD patients [3], 
but are nearly unusable by them due to poor design. 
In this paper, we propose a number of accessibility 
guidelines for designing user interfaces dedicated to people 
suffering from AD. The aim is to remove accessibility 
barriers. This work can be used as a starting point for 
designers, developers, content producers, researchers and 
usability specialists to set up application and websites 
projects for these particular users. Dementia is a 
degenerative brain condition which affects people at any age 
[5][6]. Its most common form is AD which, by itself, 
accounts for 50 to 80 percent of all dementia cases [4][6]. 
AD is a type of dementia that occurs most at the age of 65 
years or older [6]. Thus, the set of accessibility guidelines, 
presented in this work, are mostly identified from relevant 
works on design of user interfaces for both elders and people 
with dementia available in the literature.  
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
Section II describes the methodology used to identify, extract 
and systematize the set of design guidelines presented in this 
paper. Section III reviews the characteristics of AD patients 
(AD-related changes and the age-related changes).  In 
Section IV, a selection of the most relevant works on design 
guidelines of user interfaces for elders, people suffering from 
dementia, people with dyslexia and people with aphasia, 
available in the literature, are presented and summarized. 
Section V presents the proposed set of accessibility 
guidelines. In Section VI, we validate the proposed design 
guidelines on a software application that target AD patients 
(CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis). At last, in Section 
VII, we conclude the present work and we propose some 
perspectives. 
II. 
METHODOLOGY 
In this section, we detail the methodology used to 
identify the set of accessibility guidelines presented in this 
work. We used a User-Centered Design (UCD) approach. 
The methodology is described in the following four phases: 
Phase 1 -“Characteristics of AD patients”: In a User-
Centered Design approach, we firstly study the problems of 
the target user group.

Phase 2 – “Studies selection”: From the literature, we 
select a set of the most relevant works that focus on 
designing of user interfaces for older adults, persons with 
dementia, people with dyslexia and people with aphasia.  
Phase 3 – “Extraction”:  In this phase, we perform a 
triage to extract the design guidelines from the selected 
works identified in Phase 2. Then, we regroup the initial set 
of accessibility guidelines according to problems identified 
in Phase 1. Then, we do another arrangement process to 
generate unique guidelines and avoid redundancy, since 
many guidelines, from different authors, present similar 
statements. The final step in Phase 3 is to add, for each 
category, the missing design guidelines. 
Phase 4 – “Consolidation”: In this phase, we do another 
grouping process. We group the design guidelines, contained 
in each category, based on a similarity criterion. 
III. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS 
This section discusses the usual changes which 
accompany AD patient. Most people with AD are old. Thus, 
they have the expected limitations associated with the age 
[2]. So, compared to healthy young people, AD patients 
suffer from AD-related changes and age-related changes. 
A. Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Changes 
We group the disabilities related to AD into the following 
five groups. 
 “Memory impairments” - The most common symptoms 
of AD is the memory impairments [1][4]-[6], especially the 
short-term memory that means forgetting the recently 
learned information. The semantic information is normally 
preserved in long-term memory [2], e.g., languages. 
“Cognitive impairments” - The cognitive ability decline 
due to AD [1][4][5]. Cognition is the ability to think, to 
generate ideas, to focus on and to remember. AD causes a 
decrease in cognitive abilities, such as the ability to solve 
matters, level of intelligence, reasoning, judgment, capability 
to learn and speed of information processing. 
“Attention and concentration changes” - People with 
AD experience changes in attention and concentration. They 
are more easily distractible by details and noise [23]. 
“Personality changes” - Persons with AD experience 
changes in mood and personality [4][6]. The national 
Alzheimer’s association reports that over 40% of AD 
patients suffer from depression. AD patients may refuse to 
learn and they are anxious about new technology [3]. 
“Declining language abilities” - AD patients suffer from 
a decline in language and communication abilities [4][6]. In 
fact, AD patients in early stage can substitute the words that 
have the same meaning.  Patients showing moderate sign 
of AD have an increased difficulty in naming things.  
B. Age-Related Changes 
We group the disabilities related to aging into the 
following six groups. 
“Visual impairments” – The elderly suffer from a decline 
in their vision [2]-[4][6]-[11]. Aging is related to an 
impairment of near-focus including a computer screen 
[2][7][8], a loss in visual acuity [4][5][8][10], decline in dark 
adaptation 
[3][8][10], 
decrease 
in 
color 
sensitivity 
[2][3][7][8] and decrease in peripheral vision [2][7]-[10]. 
The Alzheimer’s association estimates that up to 60% of 
person with AD suffer from a decline in at least one visual 
capacity.  
 “Hearing impairments” – Age is accompanied by 
decreases in the auditory acuity [2]-[4][6]-[10]. At the age of 
65 years and above, over 30% of women and 50% of men 
suffer from hearing impairments [8]. The elderly may 
experience another complaint that they can hear others 
talking, but they can’t make out the words [2]. They may 
have difficulty to follow the synthetic speech [3]. They find 
it hard to follow long sentences [9]. 
 “Mobility impairments” - Adults experience a decline in 
their motor functions [3][4][6]-[11]. Old people with manual 
dexterity impairments find it hard to operate with the 
keyboard and the pointing device [3][7]-[9]. They may have 
difficulty to position the cursor if the target is too small 
[8][9], maintain continuous movements [3] and control fine 
movements [9]. Because of the reduced mobility, more 
errors may occur during fine movements [8][9]. 
“Decent/no computers skills” – The older generations are 
not proficient in using computer and related technologies 
[3][23]. 
“Decent/no literacy skills” – Nowadays, the illiteracy rate 
of adults aged more than 65 years are important [23]. In 
addition, many adults have basic literacy skills. They may 
not fully understand text-based information. Older adults 
may have difficulties with typing since they forget how to 
write correctly the words [23].  
“Declining speech abilities” – The speech ability 
decrease with age due to the reduced mobility of tongue and 
lips [9]. The elderly have difficulty to pronounce complex 
words. Thus, inputs via the speech modality can be limited 
by voice tremors. The elderly need more time to produce 
words sentence [9]. 
Based on these changes, we are convinced by the fact 
that AD patients face several difficulties if we adopt standard 
user interfaces in software applications or websites. 
IV. 
STUDIES SELECTION 
From the literature, we select the most relevant seventeen 
works, published between 2005 and 2015, divided into nine 
works on design guidelines for older adults, four works on 
design guidelines for people suffering from dementia, two 
works on web accessibility and people with dyslexia and two 
works on design guidelines for adults with aphasia. 
A. Review of Design Guidelines of User Interfaces for 
Elderly People 
Works on design guidelines for older adults are divided 
into works for designing web pages [7][11][12], mobile user 
interfaces [13], multi-touch user interfaces [10], multimodal 
user interfaces [9], user interfaces for games [3] and user 
interfaces for both websites and software application [2][8]. 
Arch and Abou-Zhara [7] summarize the main age-
related changes, addressing specifically, vision decline, 
hearing loss, motor impairment and cognitive effects. After,

they suggest teen accessibility guideline for designing 
websites and web applications. 
Darvishy and Good [11] present 9 areas of guidance for 
designing elderly friendly web pages, e.g., structure, 
language, navigation and search. For each of these areas, the 
authors define a list of checkpoints which can be used to test 
the accessibility of web pages. 
Zaphiris et al. [12] identify of a set of 38 age-centered 
web design guidelines which are grouped under 11 
categories such as target design, links and navigation. 
Al-Razgan et al. [13] discuss a set of design guidelines 
for touch based mobile phones that target old people. These 
guidelines are grouped in three categories: look and feel, 
interaction and functionality.  
Loureiro and Rodrigues [10] identify a number of 113 
accessibility guidelines that focus on the design of multi-
touch interfaces for elders. The authors regroup the identified 
guidelines under 10 categories such as user cognitive design, 
text design and audio.  
Jian et al. [9] review the changes related to aging, 
precisely, changes in vision, speech ability, hearing, motor 
abilities, attention, memory and intellectual ability. Then, 
they present a set of design principles for designing 
multimodal interfaces for the elderly. 
IJsselsteijn et al. [3] review the expected changes related 
to the aging process specifically, changes in sensory-
perceptual processes, motor abilities, response speed and 
cognitive processes. For each age-related change, they 
propose a number of accessibility guidelines for designing 
user interfaces of games that target elderly users.  
Farage et al. [2] summarize the main age-related changes. 
The changes fall into several 5 categories: vision, hearing, 
touch and temperature perception, memory and cognition 
and balance and mobility. For each one age-related change 
are suggested a number of concrete design guidelines to 
attenuate these limitations.  
Williams et al. [8] review the barriers the elderly face 
when using computer. Then, they present solutions for these 
problems. The difficulties are categorized into: cognition, 
auditory, haptic, visual, and motor-based troubles.  
B. Review of Design Guidelines of User Interfaces for 
People Suffering from Dementia 
Friedman and Bryan [14] are the first to formally present 
a set of web guidelines for designing user interfaces targeting 
people with cognitive disabilities, including AD patients.  
The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) proposes a set of 
guidelines of web guidelines for people with cognitive or 
neuronal disabilities and the accessibility barriers to this 
target user group [15].  
COGA presents the results of a study conducted to 
identify matters and solutions concerning web accessibility 
for person suffering from cognitive disabilities [16].  
Moutinho [4] presents a set of accessibility guidelines for 
designing mobile phone for demented old people. 
C. Review of Design Guidelines of User Interfaces for 
People with Dyslexia 
De Santana et al. [17] offer a set of 41 web accessibility 
for people with dyslexia, including people with cognitive 
disabilities and older adults. 
Rello et al. [18] present a number of design guidelines 
that aim to present texts displayed in web pages in more 
accessible way targeting dyslexic users. The guidelines are 
based in quantitative and qualitative results collected from a 
set of an experimental study carried out with people 
suffering from dyslexia. These guidelines are categorized 
into the following categories: font and background, colors, 
font size, character, line and paragraph spacing and column 
width. 
D. Review of Design Guidelines of User Interfaces for 
People with Aphasia 
Kane and Galbraith [19] list a set of 7 accessibility 
guidelines for designing a voting technology for adults 
suffering from aphasia and other communication disabilities. 
Daemen et al. [20] present the design and evaluation of a 
storytelling software application for people with aphasia. The 
design guidelines are categorized into 3 categories: 
simplicity, structure and layout and use of accessible and 
portable technology. 
V. 
ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES 
A set of 147 distinct design guidelines resulted from 
Phase 3. They were grouped under 11 distinct category 
headings, covering the main age-related changes and AD-
related changes. They were categorised into AD-related 
guidelines and age-related guidelines, as illustrated in Figure 
1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Guidelines categories. 
In Phase 4, we did a second triage. For each category, we 
grouped the guidelines based on a similarity criterion. This 
process resulted in 9 criterions carefully labeled to represent 
common elements in the user interfaces. The criterions are: 
“Visual 
elements”, 
“Textual 
and 
pictorial 
content”, 
“Navigation”, “Customization”, “Feedback and support”, 
“Audio”, 
“Inputs”, 
“Multi-touch 
interactions” 
and 
“Hardware”.  
The full set of accessibility guidelines ordered by 
category and criterion is presented in Table I.

VI. 
VALIDATION ON THE CAPTAIN MEMO MEMORY 
PROSTHESIS 
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our work in 
providing a better interaction for people with AD, the 
proposed guidelines were applied for designing the user 
interfaces of the CAPTAIN MEMO memory aid [21].  
CAPTAIN MEMO is developed in the context of the 
VIVA (« Vivre à Paris avec Alzheimer en 2030 grâce aux 
nouvelles technologies ») project [22] to help AD patients to 
palliate mnesic issues. In [23], we presented the design, 
development and evaluation of the user interfaces of this 
memory prosthesis. They are user-friendly, multimodal, 
configurable and enjoyable. Figure 2 shows a screenshot of 
CAPTAIN MEMO, which shows the user interface 
associated to the authentication step. This interface illustrates 
a number of guidelines presented before, including, but not 
limited to, the use of images to facilitate understanding text-

connection step), the use of a black font on an orange 
background to maximize the contrast between the foreground 
and background colors, the use of droll image (old parrot).

The evaluation of the interfaces’ accessibility and ease to 
use was carried out with 24 AD patients who are living in an 
assisted living environment in Sfax- Tunisia (Street Manzel 
Chaker km. 8). The participants had an average age of 64 
years – the youngest is 55 years old and the oldest is 78. 
Most patients had AD in early/moderate stage. Their profiles 
were summarized in terms of age, stage of AD, difficulties in 
vision/hearing, computer skills and literacy skills. 
This study was performed from July 2015 for about two 
months. Tasks were performed on tablet PC. A stylus pen is 
used to input commands to the touch-screen. The 
questionnaire covers five dimensions which include: 
“Overall 
Reaction”, 
“Visibility”, 
“Speech-to-text”, 
“Terminology” and “Auditory Background”. A five point 
scales are used: strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neutral 
(3), agree (4) and strongly agree (5). Table II summarizes the 
results and the mean score for each dimension.

Only 20 participants fully complete all tasks. The others 
just start the first test. They said that they are too old and 
have no motivation in learning a new technology. Those 
participants were the oldest with AD in moderate /late stage. 
They had no computer skills. We call them “patient-
restricted users”. 
As shown in Table II, the overall mean score of the 5 
dimensions is between 3.8 and 4.74. Overall, the results 
indicate that the users almost agreed that the developed 
interfaces are accessible and easy to use. 
55% of all participants were strongly satisfied with the 
system. They said that they will use the CAPTAIN MEMO 
memory prosthesis frequently. Those participants suffer from 
AD in early stage, familiar with computers and have good 
literacy skills. 
25% of all participants said that it is easier for them to 
type with a virtual keyboard since their voice volume is not 
enough to be captured by the device’s microphone. Thus, in 
the next iteration, we will use acoustic models specialized for 
elderly persons for the speech recognizer. Illiterate 
participants were very satisfied with the dictation modality. 
30% of all participants totally ignored the speaking front 
end since they did not understand words. Thereafter, in the 
next version, we will use slower voice speed. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we proposed a set of accessibility 
guidelines for designing user interfaces dedicated to older 
adults suffering from AD, refined and extracted from the 
most relevant works presented in the literature. This set of 
design guidelines is structured in a very detailed way, 
covering the main age-related changes and AD-related 
changes that might affect the usability of the interactivity in 
the user interfaces. Based on these design guidelines, we 
made the design of CAPTAIN MEMO that is developing to 
be used by AD patients. Afterward, a user satisfaction 
evaluation of the developed interfaces was carried out with 
individuals with AD. The results confirmed that they are 
user-friendly and easy to use. 
We hope that the proposed set of guidelines will serve as 
an information base for application developers, designers, 
usability specialists and researchers to guiding and 
evaluating the design of user interfaces for AD patients. 
Future work will be devoted to take into account the 
main characteristics of each different stages of AD. Then, 
we aim to set up a set of principles to adapt the user 
interfaces for each stages of this disease.
