Abstract—Chemical toxicity threat our daily health, especially 
for embryos. Reveling toxicity-dependant regulation in human 
embryo is one of the effective approaches to prevent some 
chemical effects. In previous study, we developed a network 
inference approach, based on Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM). In this study, we improved the SEM approach and 
applied this enhanced approach to expression profiles in 
human embryonic stem cells exposed to various chemicals. The 
inferred gene regulatory models among neurodevelopment 
related genes clarify the differences between chemicals, and the 
network shapes reflected the features of chemical toxicities. 
The effects of Acrylamide toxicity finally aggregated to a 
neuronal cell-related gene, even though Diethylnitrosamine 
disturbed 
normal 
cell 
differentiation-related 
genes. 
Furthermore, gene regulatory network with Thalidomide was 
complicated, but embryonic development-related genes were 
estimated as the finally effected genes by Thalidomide toxicity.

 INTRODUCTION  
We are exposed to many chemicals in our daily life, and 
chemical toxicity is known to exert harmful effects on 
human health. Actually, some diseases are caused by 
exposure to environmental pollution [1][2], including 
chemicals such as methylmercury [3][4], and so on. 
Furthermore, some chemical toxins are threatening, since 
they can cause abnormal cell differentiation in embryos 
[5][6][7]. Clarifying the details of the toxic stress response in 
embryonic cells is crucial for the prevention of harmful 
chemical effects [8][9].  
To gain a better understanding of the role of the toxic 
stress response, a gene regulatory network is useful. With the 
gene expression information, the regulatory networks among 
the genes can be inferred. Various algorithms, including 
Boolean and Bayesian networks, have been developed to 
infer complex functional gene networks [10][11]. In our 
former investigation, we developed an approach based on 
graphical Gaussian modeling (GGM). The GGM approach is 
combined with hierarchical clustering for calculations with 
massive amounts of gene expression data, and we can infer 
the huge network among all of the genes by this approach 
[12][13]. However, GGM infers only the undirected graph, 
whereas the Boolean and Bayesian models infer the directed 
graph, which shows causality.  
Recently, we developed a new statistical approach, based 
on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in combination with 
factor analysis and a four-step procedure [14]. This approach 
allowed us to reconstruct a model of transcriptional 
regulation that involves protein-DNA interactions, from only 
the gene expression data. Furthermore, SEM approach 
allows us to strictly evaluate the inferred model by using 
fitting scores. The SEM approach is available for the 
detection of causality among selected genes, as the linear 
relationships between genes are assumed to minimize the 
difference between the fitted model covariance matrix and 
the calculated sample covariance matrix [15][16][17]. 
Here, we applied the SEM approach to the limited 
expression data of neurodevelopment related genes in human 
embryonic stem cells exposed to various chemicals. The 
chemicals were considered to be toxic and to adversely affect 
the neurodevelopment related genes. Thus, inferring the gene 
regulatory network among neurodevelopment related genes 
will help to elucidate the toxic stress response in the human 
embryo. Since the regulatory interactions among the genes 
were unclear, a new approach for assuming an initial model 
should be developed for the application of SEM. In this 
study, we used an improved SEM approach that includes a 
new method for constructing a preliminary initial model, in 
the absence of known regulatory interactions. The resulting 
gene expression data clarified the chemical-specific 
interactions among the neurodevelopment related genes. 
II. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS  
A. Expression data  
We were provided the expression data which were 
measured in previous investigation [6], and the details of 
data are follows. The nine genes considered to be affected by 
chemicals were measured in the human embryonic stem 
cells: GATA2, Lmx1A, MAP2, Nanog, Nestin, Nodal, 
Oct3/4, Pax6 and Tuj1 [6][18]. As an internal control, the 
expression of beta-actin was also measured. The expression 
data were obtained from human embryonic stem cells 
exposed to 15 chemicals [6][18]. The toxicity of each 
chemical was classified into one of three types: Neurotoxic, 
Carcinogenic and others. The human embryonic cells were 
exposed to each chemical for several time periods: 24 hours,

48 hours, 72 hours and 96 hours. Each chemical was also 
tested at 5 concentrations: very low, low, middle, high and 
very high. The expression of the selected genes was 
measured twice under each condition by RT-PCR, and thus 
300 expression patterns per gene were measured [18]. 
The measured expression level of each gene was 
normalized as follows:

Here, N is the number of repeated experiments, 
i

measured expression level of gene g under one set of 
conditions, and

 is the beta-actin expression level 
measured under the same conditions. The expression level of 
each gene was divided by that of beta-actin, for intracellular 
normalization. To minimize the experimental error, the 
logarithms of the normalized expression data were obtained 
and averaged. 
B. Extraction of causalities from expression data 
For the iteration of model fitting in SEM, an initial model 
should be assumed from known information. To construct 
the initial model among the 9 neurodevelopment genes from 
the time series expressions, we applied cross correlation to 
the expression profiles measured for each chemical and each 
concentration. 
Cross correlation is utilized as a measure of similarity 
between two waves in signal processing by a time-lag 
application, and it is also applicable to pattern recognition 
[19]. The cross correlation values range between -1 and +1. 
In a time series analysis, the cross correlation between two 
time series describes the normalized cross covariance 
function. Let

where d is the time-lag between variables X and Y. In this 
case, the expression profiles were measured at 4 time points, 
and thus three cross correlations of each gene pair were 
calculated with 
1 ,0 ,1
d = −

C. Construction of the initial model 
In this study, we focused on the chemical-specific 
regulatory network, and thus the differences between times 
and concentrations could be merged for the construction of 
the initial model. Figure 1 shows the new method developed 
for constructing an initial model of each chemical, with the 
merging of several conditions. The time difference was 
summarized by the cross correlations among genes. The time 
lag, which was defined for the calculation of the cross 
correlation, was used for the extraction of causality between 
all gene pairs. According to the time lags, three cross 
correlations were calculated between each gene pair, and we 
compared them with the absolute values of the cross 
correlations. The value d, with the highest cross correlation, 
was selected as the causal information between the gene 
pairs, and a matrix composed of the selected ds was 
constructed as the time lag matrix of each chemical at one 
concentration. Thus, five time lag matrices were constructed 
for each chemical (Fig. 1a). 
To obtain the chemical-specific interactions among genes, 
we extracted the binomial relationships between gene pairs 
from the five constructed time lag matrices for each chemical 
(Fig. 1b). From the binomial relationships, we constructed a 
frequency matrix for each chemical, composed of the 
frequencies of all gene pairs (Fig. 1c). In this step, the 
difference in the concentration is merged as the frequency in 
the matrix. We extracted the gene pairs with frequency 
matrix values greater than or equal to two, as the chemical-
specific regulation (Fig. 1d). From the extracted relationships 
between the genes, we reconstructed an initial model for 
each chemical (Fig. 1e). These initial models included the 
time series information as the directions of edges, and the 
different concentrations of each chemical were summarized 
as the existence of edges in the model.

calculation of the cross correlation coefficients. Thus, three cross 
correlation coefficient values were obtained between all gene pairs. The 
time-lag value with the highest absolute value among the cross 
correlation coefficients was selected. Time-lag matrices were constructed 
for each concentration, so five time-lag matrices were obtained for each 
chemical. (b) Binomial relationships. These relationships were extracted 
from the five time-lag matrices. If the same relationships exist in several 
concentration matrices, then the extracted binomial relationships are 
duplicated in this step. (c) Frequency matrix of causal relationships 
between all gene pairs. From the binomial relationship, we can count the 
frequency of relationships between gene pairs. (d) Selection of possible 
causal relationships from the frequency matrix. The possible relationships 
between genes are considered to persist at several chemical 
concentrations. Thus, we selected the relationships with two or more 
values in the frequency matrix. (e) Construction of an initial model with 
selected causal relationships. By this approach, an initial model can 
include cyclic structures.

D. Structural Equation Modeling without Latent Variables 
(SEM without LV) 
In general, SEM is a comprehensive statistical model that 
includes two types of variables: observed and latent. These 
variables constitute the structural models that consider the 
relationships 
between 
the 
latent 
variables 
and 
the 
measurement models that consider the relationships between 
the observed variables and the latent variables. These 
relationships can be presented both algebraically, as a system 
of equations, and graphically, as path diagrams. 
In this study, the selected genes (GATA2, Lmx1A, 
MAP2, Nanog, Nestin, Nodal, Oct3/4, Pax6 and Tuj1), 
which are related to neurogenesis, were defined as the 
observed variables. Meanwhile, none were defined as latent 
variables. All observed variables were categorized into one 
of two types of variables, exogenous and endogenous, 
according to their interactions with other variables. 
Exogenous variables are those that are not regulated by the 
other variables, and endogenous variables are regulated by 
the others. In the initial model, the starting genes are defined 
as exogenous variables, while all other genes are defined as 
endogenous 
variables. 
Regulatory 
relationships 
exist 
between the observed variables in the network models. The 
model is defined as follows: 
 
= Λ +ε
y
y
                                       (3) 
 
Here, y is a vector of p observed variables (measured gene 
expression patterns), and Λ  is a 
p× p
matrix representing 
the regulatory relationships between the observed variables. 
Errors that affect the observed endogenous variables are 
denoted by ε . The SEM software package SPSS AMOS 
17.0 (IBM, USA) was used to fit the model to the data. 
E. Parameter Estimation 
Parameter estimation was performed by comparing the 
actual covariance matrix, calculated from the measured data, 
and the estimated covariance matrices of the constructed 
model. Maximum likelihood is commonly used as a fitting 
function to estimate SEM parameters:

Here, 
Σ(θ)
is the estimated covariance matrix, S is the 
sample covariance matrix, Σ  is the determinant of matrix 
Σ , 
tr(Σ)
is the trace of matrix Σ , and p is the number of 
observed variables. The principal objective of SEM is to 
minimize 
( , ( ))
FML S Σ θ
, which is the objective function 
and is used to obtain the maximum likelihood. Generally, 
( , ( ))
FML S Σ θ
 is a nonlinear function. Therefore, iterative 
optimization is required to minimize 
( , ( ))
FML S Σ θ
 and to 
find the solutions [20].  
 
F. Iteration for Optimal Model  
The regulatory network analysis by SEM consists of two 
parts: parameter fitting and structure fitting. After the 
parameters of the constructed model are estimated by 
maximum likelihood, the network structures are evaluated 
according to the goodness of fit between the constructed 
model and the measured data. Through acceptance or 
rejection of the models, the optimal model that describes 
measured data can be selected.  
In the network model, the covariance matrix between 
variables is calculated by the estimated parameters. The 
similarity between a constructed model and the actual 
relationships is predicted by comparing the matrix calculated 
from the network model to the matrix calculated from the 
actual data. To detect quantitative similarity between a 
constructed model and an actual relationship, fitting scores 
were developed. In this study, the quality of the fit was 
predicted by four different fitting scores: GFI, AGFI, CFI 
and RMSEA. Values of GFI, AGFI and CFI above 0.90 are 
required for a good model fit. RMSEA is one of the most 
popular parsimony indexes displayed in the table, and 
RMSEA values below 0.05 represent a good model fit [21]. 
Furthermore, RMSEA values of 0.10 or more are considered 
to indicate that the constructed model is far from the actual 
data. 
To optimize the model, an iteration algorithm was 
developed, as follows:  
Step1: Deletion of a non-significant edge from the model. 
Use 0.05 as the significance level for the determination of 
the chemical-specific interactions among genes. The output 
of SEM programs includes the probability of each edge, and 
thus we deleted the edge with the highest probability.  
Step2: Reconstruction of the network model. The 
structure of the network model without the non-significant 
edge is different from the former network model. Thus, all 
parameters should be re-calculated from the reconstructed 
model, and the similarity of the network structure is also re-
calculated.  
Step3: Iteration of Steps 1 and 2 until all edges become 
significant. Since the probabilities of all of the edges in the 
reconstructed models have also changed, the deletion of the 
non-significant edges is executed step-by-step. 
Step4: Addition of a possible causal edge to the 
reconstructed model. According to the Modification Index 
(MI), we add a new causal edge between the observed 
variables. The MI value indicates the possibility of new 
causality between the variables, and thus we add a new edge 
according to the highest MI score. 
Step5: Iteration from Steps 1 to 3. By the addition of a 
new edge to a constructed model, the structure of network 
model is changed again. In other words, all parameters, 
including the probabilities of all edges, have also changed 
again. Thus, we execute the iteration from Step 1 to Step 3 
again. 
Step6: Determination of significant relationships among 
error terms. After all of the edges are significant and all of 
the MI scores are lower than 10.0 in the constructed model, 
significant relationships between error terms are estimated

by the MI scores. The relationships among the error terms 
have no direction, and thus they are a correlation between 
error terms. These relationships were used for the 
calculations, but were not incorporated into the network. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. The chemical concentrations have no effect 
In this study, gene expression was measured in the 
presence of various chemicals, with several exposure times 
and at different concentrations. To reveal the most effective 
factor for gene expression, ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test 
were applied to the measured data. In statistics, ANOVA is 
utilized to detect differences between groups in terms of 
some variables. Since the chance of committing a type I error 
will be increased by performing multiple two-sample t-tests, 
a statistical test is needed to determine whether or not the 
means of more than two groups should be applied. The use 
of Tukey's HSD test clarified which means are significantly 
different from one another. Interestingly, the groups that 
were classified by the concentration of chemicals showed no 
significant difference in their gene expressions. Thus, the 
concentration of chemicals had no effect on the expression of 
the tested genes in the ES cells. 
The numbers of significantly expressed genes between 
each chemical pair are shown in Table 1. From this table, the 
differences in the gene expression were not significant 
among the same type of toxic chemicals. Furthermore, the 
toxicity difference between neurotoxic and carcinogenic did 
not cause an expression difference for almost all of the genes. 
However, the exposure to 'other' chemicals, such as 
Thalidomide, bisphenol A and Permethrin, caused significant 
expression changes in many genes. To reveal the differences 
in gene expression due to the type of chemical toxicity, we 
selected one chemical, which was the most different from 
those of the other toxicity types, as the representative 
chemical for each toxicity type. 
TABLE I.  NUMBER OF GENES WITH SINIFICANTLY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION  
 
 
 
 
Expression profiles were compared between all chemical pairs for each gene by Turkey's HSD test, 
and the genes that were estimated as exhibiting significantly different expression dependent on 
chemicals were counted. 
The toxicities of the 15 chemicals were divided into 3 
categories, Neural, Carcinogenic and others. Thus, three 
chemicals, Acrylamide, Diethylnitrosamine and Thalidomide, 
were selected as the representative toxic chemicals for neural, 
carcinogenic and others, respectively. 
B. Genes are hierarchically controlled by chemical 
toxicity 
We utilized the new method to construct the initial gene 
regulatory network models under the conditions with the 
three chemicals. Even though the new method can detect the 
cyclic interactions among genes, such as feed-back 
regulation, the structures of the constructed initial models 
indicated the hierarchical regulations among the genes. 
Figure 2 shows the constructed initial network models. The 
initial models of Acrylamide, Diethylnitrosamine and 
Thalidomide were composed of 9 genes with 19 
relationships, 8 genes with 14 relationships, and 8 genes with 
10 relationships, respectively. 
There are some obvious features in the hierarchical 
diagram of each initial model. The numbers of exogenous 
and endogenous genes are different from each other. The 
initial Acrylamide model was composed of 4 genes as 
exogenous genes, but only Oct3/4 was the last endogenous 
gene. Thus, the expression profiles of Acrylamide indicated 
the quick responses of many genes after the chemical 
exposure, and only one gene was affected later. In contrast, 
Thalidomide exposure induced the expression of only one 
gene. These differences between the initial chemical models 
summarized the distinctive gene expression profiles for each 
chemical. 
All of the initial models included some duplicated gene 
interactions, such as a direct interaction between two genes 
and an indirect interaction between them. To simplify these 
duplicated interactions, we only retained the longest path 
between two genes, since the regulation displayed by a direct 
path could be replaced by indirect paths in the model. In the 
initial model, the edges do not represent the direct regulation, 
but the preceding information. Thus, the difference between 
direct interaction and indirect interaction in the initial model 
is not very important. By retaining the longest paths, all of 
the preceding information was included, as the simplest 
diagram.

C. Inferred Network by SEM  
The final inferred networks for each chemical and the 
estimated regression weights of the edges are depicted in 
Figure 3. The inferred networks of chemicals revealed 
distinct structures. In the inferred network of Acrylamide, 
many genes were arranged as exogenous objects, and only 
one gene was arranged as the final result of all regulation in 
the network. On the other hand, two serial regulations 
interacted with each other in the Diethylnitrosamine network 
model. One serial regulation was from Lmx1A to Pax6, and 
the other was from Tuj1 to Nestin. The signal input genes in 
the Diethylnitrosamine network were also different from 
those in the Acrylamide network. Even though Tuj1 was 
arranged as an output object in the Acrylamide network, 
Tuj1 was arranged as input in the Diethylnitrosamine 
network. The inferred network of Thalidomide was also 
different from both the Acrylamide and Diethylnitrosamine 
networks. In the Thalidomide network, only two genes were 
arranged as input objects, but four genes were arranged as 
output objects. This means that only a few genes will be 
directly affected by Thalidomide, but finally many genes 
were affected throughout the gene regulatory network. 
According to our inferred network, the differences 
between the gene regulation by chemicals were clarified, and 
the network shapes reflected the features of chemical 
toxicities. In the inferred network, the effects of Acrylamide 
toxicity finally aggregated to Tuj1, which is known to 
contribute to microtubule stability in neuronal cells [22]. 
Acrylamide is neurotoxic, and thus it is reasonable that the 
effect of Acrylamide finally aggregated to a neuronal cell-
related gene. 
 
 As compared with the Acrylamide network, the cell 
differentiation genes were arranged at downstream steps in 
the Diethylnitrosamine network. From the carcinogenic 
features of Diethylnitrosamine [23][24][25], normal cell 
differentiation in the embryonic stem cell may be disturbed. 
The most complicated structure was the Thalidomide 
network. In the Thalidomide network, several type of genes 
are finally affected by its chemical toxicity. Particularly, two 
cell differentiation-related genes, Nodal and Nanog, are 
important for normal early embryonic development. Nodal is 
related to the development of the left-right axial structure 
[26][27], and its signaling pathway is known to be important 
very early in development for cell fate determination and 
many other developmental processes [27]. Nanog is known 
as a key factor for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic 
stem cells [28][29]. Thus, the unusual expressions of these 
genes, which occurred due to Thalidomide toxicity, may 
have caused its harmful side effects. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
We applied an improved SEM approach to reconstruct a 
gene regulatory model from gene expression data in human 
embryonic stem cells, and we have shown that SEM is a 
powerful approach to estimate the gene regulation caused by 
chemical toxicity. The inferred networks clarified the 
differences between the gene regulation by chemicals, and 
the features of chemical toxicities were well reflected in the 
network structures. Thus, the network construction by SEM 
is one of the useful approaches for inferring the regulatory 
relationships among genes. Furthermore, the inferred

network among genes can be utilized for the estimation of a 
chemical’s effect, from experimentally obtained expression 
profiles. The ability to identify expression profiles and the 
corresponding biological functions is expected to provide 
further possibilities for SEM in the inference of regulatory 
mechanisms by chemical toxicity.
