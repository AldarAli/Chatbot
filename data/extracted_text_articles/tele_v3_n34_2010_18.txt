Abstract—The default pulse shaping ﬁlter in the conventional
multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) based orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is a rectangular
function, which unfortunately is highly sensitive to frequency
synchronization errors and the Doppler spread. Shaped OFDM
is able to considerably alleviate the effect of inter-carrier in-
terference (ICI) as well as reduce the out-of-band frequency
leak. In this paper, we study various pulse shaping functions and
investigate their efﬁcacy for reducing the ICI in the space-time
block coded MIMO-OFDM system. We compare a new shaping
pulse termed harris-Moerder pulse with several other popular
Nyquist pulses such as the raised-cosine pulse and better than
raised-cosine pulse. Our simulation results conﬁrm that pulse
shaping using a suitable shaping function other than the default
rectangular one can alleviate ICI and thus achieve better bit
error rate (BER) performance. Furthermore, it is demonstrated
that the harris-Moerder shaping pulse is the most successful one
in suppressing ICI.

I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) [1],
[2] has become an attractive modulation technology with wide
employment in a variety of current telecommunications stan-
dards such as asymmetric digital subscribe line (ADSL) for
high-speed wired Internet access, digital audio broadcasting
(DAB), and digital terrestrial TV broadcasting (DVB). More
recently, OFDM has made remarkable inroads into current and
future wireless standards, e.g., WLAN (IEEE 802.11a/g/n),
WiMAX (IEEE 802.16), 3GPP long term evolution (LTE), and
IMT-Advanced.
OFDM is essentially a block modulation technique, which
converts a wideband frequency selective fading channel into
a number of parallel narrowband orthogonal sub-carriers that
experience only ﬂat fading. The primary advantages of OFDM
lies in its ability to cope with severe frequency-selective fading
due to multi-path without complex equalization ﬁlters. OFDM
is able to attain high frequency efﬁciency as opposed to
conventional frequency-division multiplexing techniques by
overlapping the orthogonal sub-carriers. However, this advan-
tage comes at the expense of the sensitivity to frequency offset
leading to inter-channel interference and hence performance
degradation.
Meanwhile,
multiple-antenna
technology,
also
dubbed
multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO), is emerging as
an enabling technique to achieve high data rate and spectral
efﬁciency by simultaneously transmitting parallel data streams
over multiple antennas [3], [4]. The essential idea behind
MIMO technology is space-time signal processing in which
both the time and spatial dimensions are exploited through
the use of multiple spatially distributed antennas. As such, a
MIMO system effectively transforms multi-path propagation,
traditionally treated as a nemesis for wireless communications,
into user beneﬁts.
The inaugural concept of MIMO was pioneered in Bell
Labs in middle 1990s. Telatar studied MIMO system capacity
under Gaussian channels in 1995 [5], while Foschini invented
the layered space-time architecture in 1996 [6]. To realise
the enormous capacity of MIMO systems, Wolniansky estab-
lished the world’s ﬁrst MIMO testbed based upon the vertical
Bell Laboratories layered space-time (V-BLAST) algorithm in
1997 [8], which achieved unprecedented spectral efﬁciency of
20-40 bit/s/Hz in indoor rich scattering propagation environ-
ments. V-BLAST breaks input data into parallel sub-streams
that are transmitted through multiple antennas [6], [7], [9]. The
astonishingly high spectral efﬁciency stem from parallel sig-
nal transmission resulting in remarkable spatial multiplexing
gains. Another important category of MIMO techniques that
strive to maximize diversity gains in lieu of rate increase is
termed space-time coding, including space-time block codes
(STBCs) [10], [11] and space-time trellis codes (STTCs) [12].
The third type of MIMO technology exploits channel state
knowledge at the transmitter side through decomposing the
channel coefﬁcient matrix using singular value decomposition
(SVD). The decomposed unitary matrices via SVD can be
used to conﬁgure pre- and post-ﬁlters at the transmitter and
receiver to achieve near optimum MIMO capacity [4].
MIMO and OFDM technologies can be used in conjunction
to provide broadband wireless services for future fourth-
generation (4G) wireless communications systems [13]. For
a wideband MIMO channel whose fading is frequency selec-
tive, the complexity of optimum maximum likelihood (ML)
MIMO detection grows exponentially with the product of the
bandwidth and the delay spread of the channel. To this end,

MIMO-OFDM is preferred over MIMO-SC (single-carrier) in
that OFDM modulation is employed to overlay on MIMO so as
to convert a frequency-selective MIMO channel into multiple
ﬂat fading subchannels. MIMO-OFDM can be implemented as
space-time coded OFDM (ST-OFDM), space-frequency coded
OFDM (SF-OFDM), or space-time-frequency coded OFDM
(STF-OFDM) [14]. In this paper, we restrict our system
model to ST-OFDM as the focus of the paper is on reducing
inter-carrier interference (ICI) using pulse shaping in MIMO-
OFDM.
In a MIMO-OFDM system, inter-symbol interference (ISI)
caused by multi-path propagation (time dispersion) can be
eliminated by adding a frequency guard interval dubbed the
cyclic preﬁx (CP) between adjacent OFDM symbols. However,
the CP offer no resilience against frequency dispersion, where
carrier frequency offset is introduced due to the Doppler
spread. This causes a loss of orthogonality between the sub-
carriers, and thus results in ICI. The frequency-localization of
the pulse shaping ﬁlter in the MIMO-OFDM system plays a
critical role in alleviating the sensitivity to frequency offset
and thus reducing ICI caused by the loss of orthogonality.
Another important beneﬁt of pulse shaping is to reduce out-
of-band frequency leak and hence increase spectral efﬁciency.
For conventional MIMO-OFDM systems, the pulse shaping
ﬁlter is a rectangular function, which exhibits a poor frequency
decay property, and is thus highly sensitive to frequency
synchronization errors and Doppler spread. This observation
has motivated recent studies on the design of better pulse
shaping functions for OFDM.
Shaped OFDM can reduce the effect of single tone interfer-
ence such as produced by an in-band jammer. If an interfering
signal has an integer number of cycles per OFDM frame
interval, it will interfere only with one sub-carrier. However,
if the interfering signal has a non-integer number of cycles,
it will contribute a component to every OFDM sub-carrier.
Therefore, a jammer within the OFDM band could project
into all OFDM sub-carriers due to the side lobes of the
sinc(x) frequency response. However, using pulse shaping
the interference could be isolated to a few OFDM channels
by suppressing the side lobes with an appropriate window to
ﬁlter the basis signal set [15].
Pulse shaping in MIMO-OFDM aims to replace the basic
rectangular pulse which performs poorly in dispersive chan-
nels. Unfortunately, while the majority of work on MIMO-
OFDM has been focused on the system design, and channel es-
timation and synchronization, limited research to date has been
dedicated to this important niche area of research for MIMO-
OFDM. Several approaches to pulse shaping for OFDM
systems have been tried including Hermite waveforms [16]
and Weyl-Heisenberg (or Gabor) frames [17]. In [18], the
authors examined the use of pulse shaping to reduce the
sensitivity of OFDM to carrier frequency offset. Several pulse
shaping ﬁlters such as the rectangular pulse, raised-cosine
pulse and the so-called “better than” raised-cosine pulse [19]
were compared in [20]. The authors advocated that the “better
than” raised-cosine pulse gave the best performance in the
reduction of ICI. The effects on ICI reduction of several
widely used Nyquist pulses including the Franks pulse, the
raised-cosine pulse, and the “better than” raised-cosine pulse
were compared in [24]. The Franks pulse [25] was reported
to give the best performance. In [21], a new pulse shape
was proposed and compared against Nyquist-I pulses [22].
Improved performance results for the proposed pulse shape
were reported. Most recently, another new pulse termed the
sinc with modiﬁed phase was proposed to reduce ICI in OFDM
systems in [23].
In this paper, we investigate the effect of impulse shaping
on ICI reduction for the space-time block coded MIMO-
OFDM communications system. Although the above studies
have reported results on the performance of various shaping
pulses on the resistance to carrier frequency offset in OFDM
systems, to the best of our knowledge, we are unable to
ﬁnd any published work on pulse shaping for MIMO-OFDM
systems in the literature to date. More importantly, we will
investigate the performance of a new shaping pulse dubbed
the harris-Moerder pulse [26] on ICI reduction in coded
MIMO-OFDM systems. We will present simulation results
using various OFDM pulse shapes in different time-varying
wireless fading channels, showing, among other things, how
the channel model used has a signiﬁcant effect on the ﬁnal bit
error rate (BER). Our comparative studies demonstrate that
the harris-Moerder pulse outperforms other popular Nyquist
pulses.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes the software deﬁned modules of the
transceiver. Section III describes the various channel mod-
els used. Section IV describes the pulse shapes transmitted.
Section V presents the bit error rate results obtained in the
simulation, while in Section VI conclusions are presented for
further research.
II. MIMO-OFDM TRANSCEIVER MODEL
A. System Model
In this paper, we consider the space-time block coded
MIMO-OFDM communications systems. The transceiver ar-
chitecture of the system is illustrated in Fig. 1. As can be
observed from the ﬁgure, the MIMO-OFDM transceiver is
comprised of the quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) mod-
ulator, the space-time block coding component over OFDM
with a cyclic preﬁx, the interleaver and block coding trans-
mitting through various terrestrial Rayleigh fading channels.
The system is able to achieve diversity gains in the space,
time and frequency domains as well as coding gains from the
interleaving and block coding. SBTC is implemented using
the well-known Alamouti scheme [10] with two transmit and
two receive antennas.
For the MIMO-OFDM transceiver model depicted in Fig. 1,
denote by NT , NR, and N the number of transmit and receive
antennas, and the number of sub-carriers, respectively. For the
Alamouti scheme, we have NT = NR = 2.

B. ICI Analysis
For the system model shown in Fig. 1, the complex envelope
of the N-subcarrier OFDM block with pulse shaping sent
through the ith transmit antenna can be expressed as
xi(t) = ej2πfct
N−1
X
k=0
di,kp(t)e2πfkt
(1)
where j is the imaginary unit, fc is the carrier frequency,
fk is the sub-carrier frequency of the kth sub-carrier, p(t) is
the time-limited pulse shaping function, and di,k is the data
symbol sent through the kth sub-carrier of the ith transmit
antenna, where i = 1, 2, · · · , NT , and k = 0, 1, · · · , N. The
data symbol di,k is assumed uncorrelated with zero mean and
normalized average symbol energy
E[di,kd∗
i,m] =
1,
k = m
0,
k ̸= m
(2)
where ∗ denotes the complex conjugate operator.
To ensure that the sub-carriers are mutually orthogonal, the
following relationship must hold
Z +∞
−∞
p(t)ej2πfkte−j2πfmtdt =
1,
k = m
0,
k ̸= m.
(3)
Equation (3) implies that the Fourier transform of the pulse
shaping function p(t) must have spectral nulls to guarantee
orthogonality at the frequencies of fk = ±kW/N, where W
is the total available bandwidth, and k = 1, 2, · · · , N.
It is well known that wireless fading channel distortion
and the crystal oscillator frequency mismatch between the
transmitter and receiver will introduce the carrier frequency
offset △f and the phase error θ. Consequently, this introduces
a multiplicative factor at the OFDM receiver. As a result, the
received signal is expressed as [20]
r(t) = e(j2π△ft+θ)
N−1
X
k=0
dkp(t)e2πfkt.

Note that the transmit antenna index i is dropped in the above
equation for ease of exposition.

III. PULSE SHAPES
The data pulse input into the inverse fast Fourier transform
(IFFT) modulator, and transmitted as a complete pulse on one
sub-carrier, has a very large bandwidth due to the steep edges
of the square pulse [2]. The data pulse can be shaped to reduce
the side lobes, which then also reduces the amount of energy
transmitted out of band and the resultant channel effects. This
is termed shaped OFDM.
Shaped OFDM can reduce the effect of single tone interfer-
ence such as produced by an in-band jammer. If an interfering
signal has an integer number of cycles per OFDM frame
interval it will interfere only with one subcarrier, however if
the interfering signal has a non-integer number of cycles it will
contribute a component to every OFDM sub-carrier. Therefore
a jammer within the OFDM band could project into all OFDM
sub-carriers due to the side lobes of the sinc(x) frequency
response, however using pulse shaping the interference could
be isolated to a few OFDM channels by suppressing the side
lobes with an appropriate window to ﬁlter the basis signal set.
One measure of success of a speciﬁc pulse shape is how
much it reduces the spectral side lobes of the transmitted
signal. The other main cause of degradation in OFDM is
the ICI between sub-carriers, which can also be reduced with
pulse shaping. The shaping also introduces controlled ISI at
times other than the samples taken during the receiver decision
times.
Another major advantage of shaping the OFDM signal is
to reduce sensitivity to carrier frequency offset errors due to
a time varying channel and Doppler effects, thereby destroy-
ing the orthogonality between channels. The most common
rectangular pulse prec(t), expressed as follows, does not offer
robustness even to modest frequency offset.
prec(t) =
( 1

0,
otherwise.
(8)
Some simulation work has showed that in an OFDM system
even a simple Gaussian shaped pulse, with a spread width of
10% of the symbol time, will reduce the sensitivity of the
system to a frequency offset by a factor of almost 6 dB [28].
An additional advantage of shaping is that an interfering
tone in the frequency band of the OFDM sub-carriers may
interfere with all the sub-carriers however the interference
may be isolated to a few sub-carriers by replacing the square
envelope with a shaped envelope. The envelope can be a
standard window or the impulse response of a low pass ﬁlter
applied to the basis signal set.
Pulse shaping can be then be done with polyphase ﬁlters. A
window shaped envelope has high adjacent ICI and low ISI,
while a ﬁlter shaped envelope has high ISI and low adjacent
ICI, allowing a trade-off between the two by shaping the
ﬁlter accordingly. Equalization can be added after the IFFT
or polyphase ﬁlter to suppress the interference and decouple
the adjacent channels and time frames
In this section, we compare ﬁve different shaping pulses.
We start with the classic raised-cosine pulse, which although
does reduce side lobes but is not the optimum pulse shape. A
greater side lobe suppression can be obtained with a “better
than raised-cosine pulse” as described in [20]. The third and
fourth pulse shapes tested are the duo-binary pulse and the
triangular pulse. The last shaping pulse introduced is the
recently proposed harris-Moerder window [15], which is a
modiﬁed square root Nyquist pulse using a harris taper. It will
be demonstrated with simulation results present in Section V
that the harris-Moerder pulse is the best performing shaping
pulse in the sense of reducing ICI and achieving the best BER
performance for the shaped MIMO-OFDM system.
A. Raised-Cosine Pulse
A commonly used pulse shape is the raised-cosine pulse,
i.e., the frequency domain reciprocal of the time domain
Nyquist pulse, which signiﬁcantly suppresses spectral re-
growth (side lobes) and ICI. When side lobes are suppressed
the width of the pulse is increased.
The time domain expression of the raised-cosine pulse
shaping function denoted as prc(t) is given at the bottom of
the next page, where α is the roll-off factor, and 0 ≤ α ≤ 1.
As α approaches to zero, the pulse shape becomes closer to a
rectangular.
Let Prc(f) represent the Fourier transform of the raised-
cosine pulse. The time and frequency representations prc(t)
and Prc(f) of the raised-cosine pulse are shown in Fig. 2.

B. Better Than Raised Cosine Pulse
Recently, a new shape of pulse has been discovered that
can increase the BER performance of the OFDM system [19],
including reducing even further the ICI [20]. This pulse shape
has been termed the better than raised cosine (BTRC) pulse.
The mathematical expression for the time domain represen-
tation of the BTRC pulse is given at the bottom of the next
page.
Fig. 3 shows the time domain representation of the pulse
for three different values of α. At an α of 0.5, the BTRC

pulse samples are divided into three parts equally between the
leading edge, the ﬂat top and the trailing edge. At an α of 0m
the BTRC pulse becomes a square wave. It can be observed
that the BTRC pulse requires a large number of samples to
achieve leading and trailing edges with detailed shape, and
most of these samples are in the ﬂat top. It is noted that both
the raised-cosine and BTRC pulses collapse the rectangular
pulse. The normalized frequency response of the BTRC pulse
at α = 1 is shown in Fig. 4.

Experimental and theoretical results indicate that pbtrc(t)
outperforms the rectangular and raised-cosine pulses in the
reduction of the average ICI power. Calculations show that for
a minimum average signal power to ICI ratio (SIR) of 25 dB,
when using the raised-cosine pulse, the normalized frequency
offset must be less than 0.1052. In contrast, the tolerable
normalized frequency offset may be as large as 0.1844 when
one uses the BTRC pulse.

C. Duo-Binary
The duo-binary pulse is designed to minimize ISI in a band-
limited channel (all real channels are band limited). This shape
where controlled ISI is introduced is classiﬁed as a partial
response signal. Its spectrum decays to zero smoothly [29].
The duo-binary pulse shape is given as follows
x(t) = sinc(2Wt) + sinc(2Wt − 1)
(11)
where W is the bandwidth and the sinc function is deﬁned
as sin(x)/x. A symbol rate of 2W, being the Nyquist rate,
is achieved thereby giving greater bandwidth efﬁciency com-
pared to the raised cosine pulse.
The properties of this pulse can be further enhanced by
precoding the signal using modulo two subtraction on the
original data sequence to prevent error propagation during
detection.
D. Triangular Pulse
Using an up-sampling rate of four samples on the BTRC
pulse has the effect of reducing it to a triangular shape with

E. harris-Moerder Pulse
An improvement on the standard root raised-cosine (RRC)
ﬁlter is the recently proposed harris-Moerder pulse [26]. This
is an improved Nyquist pulse that reduces ISI by eliminating
distortion associated with truncation of the standard RRC ﬁlter
impulse response. The pulse is generated using the Parkes-
McClelllan (or Remez) algorithm [26].
A comparison of the harris-Moerder pulse, using 20 symbols
in the ﬁlter and specifying equi-ripple side lobes, with the
standard root raised-cosine ﬁlter, is shown in Fig. 5.

As will be shown in Section V, the harris-Moerder pulse will
remarkably reduce ICI and thus improve the BER performance
of the MIMO-OFDM system in comparison with other shaping
pulses.
F. Equalization
ISI is caused by both channel distortion, which varies with
time, and the overlapping raised cosine signal pulses after the
receiver ﬁlter, which is a ﬁxed amount set by the transmitter
and receiver ﬁlters. The signal can be therefore be described
by three components as follows
yk = ak +
∞
X
n=0
n̸=k
anxk−n + nk
(12)
where ak represents the desired information symbol at the
kth sampling instant, and nk is the noise at the kth sampling
instant. The middle term on the right hand side of (12) is the
ISI term.
The ﬁxed ISI renders the signal virtually unintelligible and
needs to be removed. The simplest method to remove this ﬁxed
ISI is with a standard zero-forcing equalizer (ZFE). However,
a ZFE equalizer has the serious disadvantage of amplifying
noise. A minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer that
tolerates a speciﬁed amount of ISI is used in the simulations
as will be presented in Section V.
IV. TERRESTRIAL FADING CHANNEL MODELS
As aforementioned, the wireless fading channel in conjunc-
tion with pulse shaping has a considerable inﬂuence on the
performance of the MIMO-OFDM communications system.
In this section, we look into various terrestrial air channel
models.
Terrestrial radio reception normally suffers degradation by
fading due to multi-path reception of reﬂected signals that
result in statistical cancelation or addition of the received
signal. For simplicity, a radio channel is often modeled as a ﬂat
fading channel with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.)
complex Gaussian coefﬁcients. However, real channels are not
so simple and the un-modeled parameters can have signiﬁcant
positive or negative effects depending upon the characteristics
of the signal transmitted.
In a wireless fading channel with additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN), signals that do not include a direct path
component follow a Rayleigh distribution, which means the
square of the path gains are exponentially distributed. A
Rayleigh distribution is therefore a more realistic air channel
model than a basic Gaussian model.
The Rayleigh distribution is a speciﬁc case of the two
parameter Weibull distribution [30]
f(T) = β/η (T/η)β−1 e−(T/η)β
(13)
where the shape or slope parameter β equals two, and the
scale parameter η is variable. As the ratio of the LOS signal
power over the multi-path signal power increases (called the K
factor), the Rician distribution tends to an AWGN distribution.
As the ratio decreases, the Rician tends towards the Rayleigh
distribution.
When the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is narrow
enough to be within the coherence bandwidth, where all
spectral components of the transmitted signal are subject to
the same fading attenuation, then this ideal case is described
as a ﬂat fading channel. A channel is slow fading if the
symbol period is much smaller than the coherence time, and
quasi-static if the coherence time is in the order of a “block
interval”.1
It is obviously easier to compensate for fading in a ﬂat
channel than the one where fading is non-linear. Diversity
techniques over fading channels non correlated in time, fre-
quency and space are used to reduce the effects of fading and
therefore improve the spectral efﬁciency of the air channel.
The following wireless fading channel models are used in
our simulations.
A. Jakes Model
Practical models for mobile communications assume there
are many multi-path components and all have the same
Doppler spectrum with each multi-path component being itself
1It is noted, however, that different authors use considerably different
deﬁnitions of a “block”, some mean no fading over one whole transmitted
frame while others mean over either one or even two sampled symbol periods.
The simulation results in this work assume constant fading over one symbol

the sum of multiple rays. The ﬁrst model to take into account
both Doppler effects and amplitude fading effects was devised
by Jakes in 1974 [31].
The Doppler effect of a moving receiver is described by the
classical Jakes spectrum, which gives a “bathtub” shape of sig-
nal power against velocity, with singularities at the minimum
and maximum Doppler frequencies. The basic Jakes channel
fading model incorporating this Doppler shift simulates time
correlated Rayleigh fading waveforms.
The model assumes that N equal strength waves arrive at
a moving receiver with uniformly distributed angles, coming
from 360◦ around the receiver antenna, as illustrated in Fig. 6.
The fading waveforms can therefore be modeled with N + 1
complex oscillators. This method, however, still creates un-
wanted correlation between waveform pairs.

B. Dent’s Model
The unwanted correlation of Jake’s model is removed in
a modiﬁcation by Dent et al. The unwanted correlation can
be corrected by using orthogonal functions generated by
Walsh-Hadamard codewords to weigh the oscillator values
before summing so that each wave has equal power [32]. The
weighting is achieved by adjusting the Jake’s model so that
the incoming waves have slightly different arrival angles αn.
The modiﬁed Jakes model is given by

is phase, θ is initial phase that can be randomized to provide
different waveform realisations, and ωn = ωM cos(αn) is the
Doppler shift.
Dent’s model successfully generates uncorrelated fading
waveforms thereby simulating a Rayleigh multi-path air chan-
nel. The “bathtub” shaped power spectrum distribution (PSD)
of Rayleigh fading based on Dent’s model is estimated by the
periodogram as shown in Fig. 7. For an input data stream x(n)
that is a zero-mean, stationary random process and its discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) denoted by X(w), the periodogram
is deﬁned as I(w) = |X(w)|2/N, where N is the data length.

C. Auto-regressive Model
Most fading models assume Rayleigh fading in an isotropic
channel. However, this assumption is not always valid. In an
attempt to add directional fading to the model, an autore-
gressive approach has been successfully developed in [33].
Furthermore, it has been proved that the classical Jakes model
introduces fading signals that are not wide sense stationary,
and the auto-regressive model remedies this shortcoming.
The periodogram of the autoregressive model, shown in
Fig. 8, is still a “bath tub” shape, albeit with a narrower cut-off
than Dent’s model.

D. Stanford University Interim Models
For
the
purposes
of
the
IEEE
802.16
standard
on
LAN/MAN air interfaces, the IEEE have adopted and modiﬁed
a series of models called the Stanford University Interim
(SUI) models [34]. These channel models for ﬁxed wireless
applications cover six scenarios of terrain and environment for
the 1-4 GHz band.
The SUI models are different from the previous models
since they assume time-variant (frequency-selective) channels.
As a result, they need to be modeled with a tapped delay line
in lieu of a more simple transfer function. Each tap represents
the path of a different delayed frequency. Although there are
theoretically an inﬁnite number of frequencies, it has been
found that modeling with three taps is accurate enough.
The SUI model differs from the simpler Rayleigh fading
distribution in that it does not exhibit the typical Rayleigh PSD
of the previous two models. The difference is most noticeable
in the PSD estimate where the power spectral density at the
high end of the spectrum does not increase asymptotically but
instead tapers to zero forming a “half bathtub” shape, as shown
in the periodogram Fig. 9.

E. Tropospheric Model
The tropospheric (non-ionospheric) communications in the
VHF (30 to 300 MHz) and UHF (300 MHz to 3 GHz)
bands can cover several hundred kilometers. In these bands
oxygen and water vapor absorb RF energy with the loss being
dependent on frequency and atmospheric conditions such as
humidity. The previous models would not be suitable for this
environment. The frequency selective absorption characteris-
tics can be modeled by a transfer function of the following
form
H(f) = Hej0.02096f[106+N(f)]l
(15)
where N(f) is the complex refractivity of the atmosphere in
parts per million. The resulting channel model can be simu-
lated using ﬁnite impulse response ﬁltering techniques [35].
An example of a tropospheric model for microwave com-
munication between ﬁxed antenna towers is Rummler’s model.
This is a line of sight model with a very small number of
multi-path components resulting in very slow fading [35].
The channel model becomes especially important in the case
of designing MIMO algorithms since these are especially sen-
sitive to the channel matrix properties. Some authors [36] cau-
tion that since results for realistic channels are still unknown
the predicted gains of MIMO systems may be premature.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we present experimental simulation results
to demonstrate the performance improvements of shaping the
coded MIMO-OFDM system using the various time-limited
pulse shaping functions discussed in Section III. We will
ﬁrst show the the frequency responses of shaped OFDM sub-
carriers using these shaping pulses, followed by the presenta-
tion of the BER curves to demonstrate the error performance
of the MIMO-OFDM system over wireless fading channels.
A. System Conﬁguration Parameters
The OFDM signals are generated with a 64-point IFFT,
thereby givingv 64 sub-carriers conforming to the IEEE
802.11 standard. The baseband frequencies therefore range
from 512 KHz to 32.8 MHz. Assuming a typical bandwidth
of 16.56 MHz (as in 802.11a), the channel separation is
16.56/64 = 258.74 KHz and the OFDM frame duration is
3.86 µs. To counter ISI, the cyclic preﬁx added is set at 25%
of the OFDM block, thereby adding another 0.96 µs to the
transmitted frame. The data bit frame length is 131072 bits,
while the IQ symbol frame length is 524288.
Error detection and correction is performed by using a linear
block coder of codeword length of 4 and parity length of
2. Optimum results for the MMSE equalizer are obtained
experimentally by varying ﬁrstly the roll-off factor, a value
of 0.495 is found optimum, and secondly varying the symbol
noise power, a value of 6 is optimum. The optimum parameters
are found by empirical try and error methods.
B. Frequency Spectrum of Shaped OFDM Signal
The frequency response of the OFDM sub-carrier signals at
the transmitter after the IDFT modulation and shaping using
a standard root raised-cosine ﬁlter is shown in Fig. 10. The
ﬁltered signal shows a sidelobe suppression of about 30 dB.
At the receiver the signal was passed through a second root
raised cosine pulse prior to input to the DFT demodulator.
The resulting frequency response of a subcarrier is shown in
Fig. 11.
The frequency response of the OFDM demodulated output,
without shaping and with shaping using the raised-cosine pulse
ﬁlter at the receiver after demodulation is shown in Figs. 12
and 13. With the shaped OFDM the 64 sub-carriers can clearly
be seen approximately 20 dB above the noise, while in the
unshaped signal, the subcarriers cannot be seen amongst the
noise.

purposes. It can be observed how the MMSE equalization, us-
ing only ﬁve coefﬁcients, suppresses the out of band sidelobes
by about 40 dB.

seen to be very effective even though the MMSE equalizer uses
less than half the number of coefﬁcients as there are samples
in the harrise-Moerder shaping pulse.

C. BER Performance Results
First of all, we plot several basic performance curves in
Fig. 18 for the baseline MIMO-OFDM system using the
Alamouti STBC scheme without pulse shaping.
Fig. 18.
Comparisons of the BER performance curves for STC, STC OFDM
and STC OFDM under Rayleigh fading.
1) Raised
Cosine
and
harris-Moerder
Pulse
Shaped
OFDM: Shaping the OFDM pulse signiﬁcantly improves the
BER. As shown in Fig. 19, a Matlab designed raised cosine
pulse, divided between the transmitter and receiver as root
raised cosine ﬁlters, achieves about a 3 dB improvement over
non shaped MIMO-OFDM. it can be seen that shaping with
the harris-Moerder pulse at the transmitter increases the BER
by more than 2 dB over raised cosine shaped MIMO-OFDM.
The Rayleigh fading in these cases uses the auto-regressive
model.
2) DuoBinary Pulse Shaped OFDM: The standard DuoBi-
nary pulse, 61 samples long and equalised with the maximum
number of coefﬁcients (61) could not successfully be over-
lapped in the time domain when up-sampled by a factor of
four. Fig. 20 shows the best results obtained, leveling out at
an error rate of about 12% at an SNR around 6 dB.
Increasing the upsampling rate by double, to eight samples,
gives better results, as shown in Fig. 21. However, curiously
the BER curve for an AWGN channel follows the shape of a
Rayleigh fading channel.
3) BTRC Pulse Shaped OFDM: The least successful pulse
shape is the BTRC pulse. Equalisation is unsatisfactory, a
greater upsampling rate is required than for other pulses
meaning that it would be less practical to implement than other
pulse shapes since sampling hardware would have to work at
much higher speeds. Although this pulse shape was previously
used successfully in OFDM to reduce the effects of unwanted
frequency offset [37], the authors used an OFDM pulse length
of the same length as the the BTRC pulse shaping ﬁlter.
Additionally, since there was no time domain overlap there
was no need to implement equalisation in their simulation.

For an over-sampling of 8 and an α of 0.1 the BER curve
still is not as good as unshaped STC OFDM in an AWGN
channel. For the extreme case of an over sampling rate greater
than the pulse width (therefore no time domain overlap) the
BTRC gives the best results for an AWGN channel, as shown
in Fig. 22. It should be noted that using the BTRC pulse in
this manner is not a comparison under like conditions with the
other modulation techniques.
4) Triangular Pulse Shaped OFDM: Modifying the BTRC
pulse by truncating the long ﬂat top of the pulse, and up-
sampling at a rate four, inadvertently produced a triangular
wave with values [0 0.5 1 0.5]. The BER of the triangular pulse

as shown in Fig. 23.
Not all possible variations of pulse shapes and equalisation
parameters under different fading environments have been
tested here. There may be versions that are optimised under
some circumstances and not under others.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we investigate the efﬁcacy of impulse shaping
in reducing the ICI for the space-time block coded MIMO-
OFDM communications system. Little existing work is known
about the inﬂuence of pulse shaping for space-time coded

MIMO-OFDM systems. This work studies various shaping
pulses and reports on their effect on alleviating the ICI for
the MIMO-OFDM system. More importantly, we investigate
the shaping performance of the new harris-Moerder pulse.
Simulation results are presented to demonstrate that shaping
the OFDM pulse signiﬁcantly improves on the system BER
performance. Our results clearly indicate that the new harris-
Moerder pulse outperforms other popular Nyquist pulses in the
sense of improve the BER of the OFDM system. Moreover,
the underlying channel model used has a signiﬁcant effect on
the BER.
The system could most likely be improved by adding further
features, albeit at a cost of increasing the computational
complexity. The optimum number of equalisation coefﬁcients
for each shape still needs to be determined. Adaptive pulse
shaping by varying the parameters of the pulse shapes could
also be explored for optimum performance in a time variant
channel.
