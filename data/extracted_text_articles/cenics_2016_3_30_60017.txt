Abstract—The work presents Floating Gate MOS (FGMOS) 
based low-voltage, low-power (LV/LP) variant of recently 
proposed Voltage Differencing Buffered Amplifier (VDBA). 
The proposed topology operates at low supply of ±1.35V with 
total power consumption of 0.745mW. The linearity of the 
Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) stage of the 
proposed active element is observed to increase compared to 
the conventional VDBA and the same has been proved for 
several supply voltages. The application of the proposed circuit 
is verified through robust resistorless voltage mode universal 
biquad filters which are observed to implement standard filter 
functions. The simulations are performed through SPICE in 
0.18µm technology to validate the workability of the proposed 
circuit. The work is intended to find applications in low-
voltage, low-power battery-operated medical devices and other 
analog signal processing circuits.

INTRODUCTION 
Analog signal processing (ASP) with the use of active 
elements employing Voltage Mode (VM) techniques is seen 
in existing research. VM techniques offer several 
advantages [1]. Among several VM active elements, VDBA 
has attractive properties of current mode technology such as 
reduced power consumption, larger bandwidth, wider 
linearity and higher slew rate compared to OP-AMP [2]. 
Furthermore, lower output impedance of VDBA compared 
to OTA eliminates loading effect which is suitable for VM 
circuit synthesis. These evidences demand ASP circuits with 
VDBA as a building block. Several modifications of VDBA 
have been suggested by Sotner et al. [3]. 
The demand for LV/LP electronics is inevitable in 
modern portable consumer electronics and battery-operated 
wearable and implantable biomedical devices. FGMOS 
techniques have dominated in this field of research with 
advantages of flexibility, controllability and tunability. 
Moreover, narrower bandwidth and relatively lower 
transconductance compared to the conventional MOS 
transistor are attractive features for biomedical devices since 
biological signals have extremely low amplitude and 
frequency. Applications of FGMOS in voltage buffer, 
analog inverter, winner-take-all (WTA), neural networks, 
electronic 
programming, 
squarers, 
current 
mirrors, 
multipliers, 
digital-to-analog 
and 
analog-to-digital 
converters have been reported [4]. Several research 
publications have dealt with CMOS implementations of 
VDBA [2][3][5]. Few VM active elements have been 
designed using the FG technique, such as Op Amp [6], OTA 
[7]-[10] and class AB output stage for CMOS Op-Amps 
[11]. As per authors’ knowledge, suitable literature related 
to FGMOS based VDBA was not found. 
This paper introduces a favorable structure of a new 
FGMOS VDBA suitable for VM ASP described in Section 
II. Implementation of second order active filters has been 
possible with the utilization of the active block. Two VM 
filters containing the proposed VDBA have been simulated 
and are given in Section III. The workability of the proposed 
circuits is confirmed by PSPICE simulations. These are 
discussed in Section IV. A comparison of the previously 
reported and the proposed VDBA is done. The use of 
proposed VDBA is confirmed with its applications to first 
and second form biquads and their capability in generating 
all filter functions. Section V concludes the results obtained.

PROPOSED FGMOS REALIZATION OF VDBA 
Conception of the classical VDBA has been formulated 
in [2][5][12]. Using standard notation, port currents and 
voltages of CMOS VDBA can be described by (1):

voltage ratio (α = 1-εv) and εv is voltage tracking error. The 
circuit symbol and schematic implementation of the 
proposed VDBA are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. 
It has two fundamental blocks: OTA (M1-M9) and voltage 
buffer (M10-M16), both are realized by FGMOS variants of 
MOS differential pairs. FGMOS differential pair has been 
employed in OTA to ensure low voltage operation because 
of low FGMOS threshold voltage. In the differential pair

formed by two floating gate (FG) transistors M1 and M2, 
one control input of each transistor is used for signal 
processing purpose, other control input is used for biasing, 
and hence an adjustable threshold voltage is achieved. The 
differential input voltage Vin = VFG1 – VFG2, produces an 
output current that is voltage controlled current source 
(VCCS) [2]. VFG1 is the FG voltage at M1 given by 𝑉𝐹𝐺1 =

𝐶𝑇 𝑉𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠, where CT is total capacitance, CT = 
C1+C2+CGS+CGD. C1 and C2 are the FG capacitances. The 
current mirror load for the OTA is formed by M5 and M6. A 
voltage buffer is used in the output stage of the proposed 
circuit. It consists of a differential amplifier (M10 - M13) 
and a feedback transistor M14. The first control input of 
FGMOS M10 is VZ terminal voltage. The input range of the 
OTA increases by the use of FGMOS transistors. The 
assumption is that identical MOSFETs and identical 
FGMOS transistors are used and all operate in saturation.

The maximum input range of conventional VDBA is [2] 
 
𝑉𝑃 ≤ 𝑉𝐷𝐷 + 𝑉𝑜𝑣4 + 𝑉𝑇4 + 𝑉𝑇2  
(12)   
On comparing (11) and (12), maximum input range is seen 
higher for proposed VDBA compared to the conventional. 
This has been proved through simulations in Section IV. 
Circuits proposed in the work are based on the simulation 
model of a 2 – input FGMOS transistor. It is assumed that 
the bulk transconductance of FGMOS is negligibly small. 
III. 
FILTER APPLICATIONS 
This section discusses filter applications of proposed 
VDBA. The filters consist of two cascaded FGMOS VDBA 
with two capacitors as passive components. Robust biquad 
filter configurations employing CMOS based VDBA have 
been proposed by Kacar et al. [2]. The proposed biquads 
(Figures 3 and 4) exhibiting filter functions are obtained on 
similar lines with the objective of low voltage operation. 
The nodal analysis of the proposed filters yield transfer 
functions given by (13) and (14). The relations for natural 
frequency and quality factor of FGMOS based Biquad 1 and 
Biquad 2 circuits are given by (15) and (16) respectively. 
For both biquads to realize standard filter functions, 
different values of V1, V2 and V3 can be employed as given 
by Kacar et al. [2].

SIMULATION RESULTS 
All simulations are done with TSMC CMOS 0.18 µm 
technology, supply voltage ±1.35V, CF1 = CF2 = 200 fF. 
Model suggested by Rodriguez-Villegas [13] has been used 
to overcome DC convergence error because of FG. Aspect 
ratio values of transistors are given in Table I. Comparison 
of previous topologies with the proposed is done in Table II. 
An increase in the input range of OTA section of the 
proposed VDBA is seen. Reduced power consumption and 
transconductance is also observed. Increased bandwidth of 
the OTA stage is also seen. The gain of buffer stage of the 
proposed VDBA is ~1 and more reliable compared to 
previous topologies. DC transfer characteristic of the output 
stage of the proposed VDBA at bias voltages VB1 = 1V and 
VB2 = 0.45V is shown in Figure 5, where the linearity 
extends from -1V to +1.5V. The IZ versus VP and VN is 
shown in Figure 6. The linearity extends in the range ±0.4V 
while a non-linear behavior is observed elsewhere. The 
operation of OTA stage of the proposed VDBA, depicting IZ 
against VP for different supply voltages is seen in Figure 7. 
Though the swing for which the OTA justifies its operation 
decreases by reducing the power supply; approximately 
±350 µA at supply voltage of ±1.45V, ±300 µA at supply 
voltage of ±1.35V, ±250 µA at supply voltage of ±1.25V 
and ±200 µA at supply voltage of ±1.15V, the current swing 
provided for conventional VDBA reported in [2], is around 
±140 µA, and that too for a supply voltage of ±1.5V which 
is high enough compared to the one simulated for the 
proposed VDBA. The linearity observed is in the range 
±0.4V for the proposed VDBA performed at different 
supply voltages, while the linearity extends only upto a 
threshold of ±0.2V for the conventional VDBA [6]. This 
increase in the range of operation of the proposed VDBA 
can be accounted for the fact that the equivalent capacitance 
ratio, Ci/CT (FG capacitance Ci) scales down the effective 
input signal at FG, resulting in a wider range. The frequency 
response depicting the transconductance of OTA stage and 
complete proposed VDBA are shown in Figures 8 and 9. 
One out of the two inputs of FGMOS transistors in the OTA 
stage is grounded. The transconductance of OTA stage of 
the proposed VDBA at bias voltage of 0.41V is 483µA/V. 
The bandwidth of input stage of the OTA is found to be 385 
MHz at Vb = -0.41V. Biquad 1 implemented using FGMOS 
VDBA depicting standard filter functions are shown in 
Figure 10.

Passive component values chosen are C1 = C2 = 100pF and 
transconductances gmF1 = gmF2 = 483µA/V. VM biquad in 
Figure 4 were designed for f0 = 0.815 MHz and Q-factor of 
1. Various responses of the proposed universal filter (Figure 
4) are shown in Figure 11. For simulations, equal passive 
capacitance values C1 = C2 = 100pF and R1 = 5kΩ are 
chosen for natural frequency of 0.815 MHz and Q-factor of 
1.024. It is seen from the frequency responses of Figures 10 
and 11 that the proposed filters are capable of performing 
standard filter functions. The simulation results emphasize 
high linearity and high performance of the proposed VDBA 
in terms of reduced power consumption.

CONCLUSION 
A new FGMOS realization of VDBA that operates on 
low voltage with reduced power consumption was 
presented. Realization of resistorless voltage mode biquad 
filters is possible with the proposed FGMOS based VDBA 
and are seen to implement standard filter functions. The 
benefits of the new proposed VDBA on the filter 
performance include low-power implementation and simpler 
circuitry. The proposed circuit and universal filters are 
intended to find applications in LV/LP ASP and consumer 
electronics.
