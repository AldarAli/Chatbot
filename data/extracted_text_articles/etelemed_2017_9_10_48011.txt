Abstract—The use of simulation in health professional 
education has increased rapidly in Japan during the past 
decade. However, to date, only a limited number of studies 
reporting this situation has been published. We, herein, 
endeavored to ascertain how simulation has been adopted in 
nursing education, reviewing Japanese articles in this field. 
Searching a database, Nippon Igaku Chuo Zasshi, identified 86 
peer-reviewed research studies published in Japanese between 
1986 and 2016. Since 1999, around 5 articles per year have 
consistently 
been 
published. 
Simulation 
was 
applied 
predominantly in basic and medical-surgical nursing areas, to 
learn physical assessment, fundamental skills, injection, and 
perioperative care. Forty-one percent of the simulation-based 
learning was conducted using 3-D-models to provide infection 
and cardiopulmonary resuscitation education. Intermediate 
and high fidelity patient simulators were applied to teach 
physical assessment, fundamental skills, and perioperative care, 
only in rare cases. In Japan, much higher importance should 
be 
placed 
on 
simulation-based 
undergraduate 
nursing 
education, and the socioeconomic environment for introducing 
more sophisticated simulators must be improved. 
Key words- nursing education; nursing; simulation; 
simulators; health care professionals. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The primary aim of simulation is to improve patient 
safety and to help the student nurse achieve competence, 
linking their theoretical knowledge with clinical practice [1]. 
The use of simulation in health professional education has 
increased rapidly over the past 2 decades [2]. The current 
range of simulation in this field consists of written 
simulations, 
three-dimensional 
models, 
screen-based 
simulators, standardized patients (SP), intermediate fidelity 
patient simulators, and interactive patient simulators (Table 
1)[3]. 
In the current health education system, the demand for 
clinical placements is increased, while there is a global social 
need for higher quality healthcare services with shorter 
hospital stays [4]. In addition, in Japan, clinical practicum 
hours have been decreasing remarkably in the recent nursing 
education curriculum, as students spend more time in 
theoretical classroom learning. Thus, nursing students have 
less chance to be involved in patient care and reduced 
opportunities to deal with practice situations [4]. This may 
lead to decreased clinical competencies in nursing school 
graduates [5]. Hence, there has been a need to reproduce the 
experience by some other means. Indeed, the Japanese 
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare encouraged trainees 
to complement skills that could not be experienced during a 
practicum using simulation-based learning. 
Reflecting a global trend of accelerating use of 
simulation in nursing education, the simulation-based 
education in our country seems to be spreading recently. 
However, a limited number of studies going through this 
situation has been published in Japanese, and there have been 
none in English. In this study, we endeavored to ascertain 
how simulation has been adopted in nursing education in 
Japan, reviewing Japanese articles in this field. 
II. 
METHODS  
A. Literature Search Strategies 
The research question that informed the search was ‘How 
has simulation been used in nursing education in Japan?’ 
Boolean operators of AND & OR were used in the search. A 
Japanese electronic database, Nippon Igaku Chuo Zasshi 
(Japana Centra Revuo Medicina), was searched for peer-
reviewed research studies in the Japanese language published 
between the years of 1986 and December 2016, focusing on 
simulation and/or simulator use in nursing education. The 
search terms used to discover the literature were: Simulation; 
Simulators; Nursing; Education; Skills. 
B. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Studies were selected if they described an impact of 
simulation-based 
learning 
in 
nursing 
undergraduate 
education. Excluded studies were literature reviews, those 
reviewing learning theory, qualitative reviews of student or 
faculty experience, and those targeting simulation education 
for qualified staff. 
C. Literature review and analysis  
The searches identified a total of 86 articles on simulation-
based undergraduate nursing education during the period. 
Articles were grouped based on the major and sub-
specialties of nursing science, types of simulation, and 
subjects who were the targets of simulation training. The

Simulation-based Undergraduate Nursing Education in 
Japan 
The first report on simulation-based learning for nursing 
students appeared in 1987. Since 1999, the articles on 
simulation-based education for undergraduate nursing 
students have been consistently published, around 5 articles 
per year on average (Fig. 1). 
B. Spcialities in Simulation-based Nurse Education 
Simulation was applied predominantly to basic and 
medical-surgical nursing areas; the proportion of the basic 
nursing was 57%, and that of medical-surgical nursing 22%

Figure 4. Training Subjects in Simulation-based Nursing Education 
 
In the subspeciality “basic nursing”, which comprised the 
main part of the simulation-based education (Fig. 3), the 
major training subjects consisted of injection, fundamental 
skills, physical assessment, and communication (21, 19, 12, 
and 9%, respectively). 
D. Types of Simulation in Undergraduate Nursing 
Education 
Forty-one percent of the simulation-based learning was 
conducted using 3-D-models (Fig. 5), to teach infection 
management and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (Fig. 
6). SP were used in communication and fundamental skills 
education (Fig. 6). Intermediate and high fidelity patient 
simulators were applied to learn physical assessment, 
fundamental skills, and perioperative care education, only in 
rare cases (Fig. 6). Articles targeting education with these 
sophisticated simulators first emerged in 2003, and have 
been consistently produced since 2010 (Fig. 7). 
IV.

To our knowledge, this is a first literature review in 
English reporting the simulation-based learning for 
undergraduate nurses in Japan.

Figure 6. Distribution of Types of Simulation in Training Subjects 
Since 2003, the number of articles in this field has 
started increasing, possibly highlighted and promoted by 
four governmental bulletins. The Japanese Ministry of 
Education released a report on the university/college 
education for practical nursing skills in 2002, and one on the 
attainment target for this education in 2004. In 2003, the 
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare also 
issued a report on the desired skill education for 
undergraduate nursing students, and one on education in 
practical nursing skills for novice nurses. These noted that 
nursing students have fewer chances to be involved in 
patient care, and to deal with practice situations, because of 
a socioeconomic need for shorter hospital stays, and 
consideration of the human rights of patients, and medical 
safety measures. The bulletin in 2003 suggested applying 
role-playing to practical training within the campus, which 
may have pioneered simulation-based nursing education in 
Japan. Indeed, SD was one of the major issues in the articles 
published (Fig. 5), and these studies came out consistently 
(Fig. 7). 
This literature review revealed that 3-D models, 
including basic mannequins, low fidelity simulation models, 
or task trainers were prevalently used in pre-licensure 
nursing education in Japan, when teaching physical 
assessment, general fundamental skills, injection, or CPR. 
This observation, although literature based, is in line with an 
actual survey by Kuroda et al [7], showing that 61.2 % and 
69.3 % of nursing schools possessed task trainers and low 
fidelity simulators, respectively.

Figure 7. Annual Changes in Types of Simulation 
A report reconsidering the teaching contents and methods 
in the undergraduate nursing education released by the 
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in 2012 
advised that skills, which could not be experienced during 
the practicum training, should be complemented by 
simulation, and even referred to introducing more 
sophisticated simulators, which may have brought about 
emergence of the articles addressing intermediate and high 
fidelity simulators (Fig. 7). Multiple studies confirmed that 
high fidelity simulation benefited nursing students in terms 
of knowledge acquisition and critical thinking, and created a 
learning environment that contributed to greater knowledge, 
skills, safety, and student confidence [7]. These devices, 
however, have not been sufficiently distributed in our 
country, to date; the ownership ratio of intermediate fidelity 
simulators for physical assessment, that for critical care, and 
high fidelity ones for the nursing schools were reportedly 
45.2-71.0, 86.5, and 24.2%, respectively [6]. 
The limitation of this study is that the data are based on a 
literature review, rather than on an actual condition survey. 
Furthermore, investigations to elucidate the history and the 
current status of this subject should be required, and 
published in English. 
We conclude that, in Japan, much more importance 
should be attached to simulation-based undergraduate 
nursing education as a teaching methodology, as well as a 
research field. The optimal socioeconomic environment to 
introduce sophisticated patient simulators must be prepared 
by the government.
