Abstract—In this paper, we conduct a usability experiment to 
evaluate two popular e-book systems (Zinio and MagV) using a 
touchscreen device (iPad). In the experiment, we ask 24 
experienced Internet users to perform 10 tasks conducted by 
five interface design experts. We then collect the quantitative 
and qualitative data, including the operation time, error 
frequency, and subjective satisfaction, to explore the usability 
problems of the touch interface design for e-book readers. The 
experimental results show that the interface design of Zinio is 
more user-friendly and efficient as perceived by the 
participants. In addition, although the touch interface is 
effective for the participants, the operational performance 
could be compromised by the poor interface design of the e-
book system. The research outcomes provide useful references 
for interface designers in designing user-friendly interfaces of 
e-books.

 INTRODUCTION 
As 
both 
‘ambient 
intelligence’ 
and 
‘ubiquitous 
computing’ grow and mature, mobile devices or handy 
devices have become some of the most desired and popular 
commercial products, including smart phones, e-book 
readers, ultrabooks (laptops), and tablets [1]. According to 
various marketing reports [2][3], the number of mobile 
device users is with 10%-30% annual growth. This is a 
fantastic outcome for manufacturers and product designers. 
Additionally, a trend has been noted that the development of 
e-books is gradually changing the reading habits of mobile 
users and the manner in which they retrieve information [4]. 
For example, in the United States, around one in four of all 
book-buyers purchase at least one e-book each month. 
Moreover, 31% of new books purchased are e-books, and 
15% of the dollars spent on these books are for e-books [5]. 
However, can e-books meet users’ demands for reading? Is 
reading an e-book the same as reading a physical book [6]? 
Can the readers adapt themselves to the differences in the 
touch interface of e-books? 
To address these issues, we conduct a usability 
experiment [7] on e-books in this study.  For our experiment, 
we choose the iPad with a touchscreen as the input device. In 
order to collect additional data for further analysis, we 
choose two popular e-book systems (apps): Zinio and MagV, 
due to their popularity and cross-platform attributes [1], 
which will be described in the subsequent sections. 
In subsequent sections, we first present the usability 
experiment 
for 
touch 
interfaces, 
including 
the 
10 
experimental tasks. We then collect the quantitative and 
qualitative data based on the usability experiment, including 
the operation time, error frequency, and subjective 
satisfaction. Finally, the participants’ recommendations and 
conclusions are given about the e-book systems. 
II. 
USABILITY EXPERIMENT FOR TOUCH INTERFACES 
The tablet is suitable and portable to read the text without 
zooming in and navigating around to have it perfectly 
positioned for reading [8]. In addition, the top tablet market 
share is iPad (26.9% in 2014 according to the International 
Data Corporation (IDC) report) [3]. As such, we choose the 
iPad as the experimental device, with two e-book systems. 
The Zinio system captures over 60% market share in digital 
magazine circulation, and it is a polished platform for digital 
magazine reading, which has apps for iOS, Android, 
Windows, and a desktop reader for Mac and PC. However, 
MagV is one of the biggest online Chinese bookstores in 
Asia, particularly in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. The 
Zinio and MagV e-book systems have different interface 
designs and different ways of navigating and reading e-
books (as shown in Figure 1). Therefore, we can examine the 
usability of the interface design of these e-book systems and 
their different learning performances in reading e-books. 
There are 29 participants, including five design experts 
and 24 experienced Internet users, involved in the 
experimental study. The 5 experts, with at least 10 years of 
interface design experience and the relevant analytical 
experiences of human-computer interface, form a focus 
group [7][9] to conduct 10 experimental tasks (as shown in 
Table I). The other 24 participants (with the average age of 
22.8) are asked to test two e-book systems (Zinio and MagV) 
by using a touchscreen to perform 10 experimental tasks, 
whose results are used as a basis to conduct quantitative and 
qualitative analyses. 
We record the entire experimental sessions on video 
while the participants are engaging in the experimental tasks. 
After 
the 
usability 
assessment, 
a 
semistructured 
questionnaire is used to collect information pertaining to the

Step 1: Conduct 10 experimental tasks by the five interface 
design experts. 
Step 2: Perform the 10 experimental tasks by the 24 
participants who test the two e-book systems by using 
the touchscreen. These participants are randomly 
assigned to test the Zinio or MagV e-book system. 
After the test, they take a short break (about 10 to 15 
minutes), and then test the other system (MagV or 
Zinio), depending on which is taken first, until the 
experimental tasks are completed. 
Step 3: Record the entire experimental sessions on video, 
including the operation time and errors occurred 
during the 10 experimental tasks. 
Step 4: Distribute the semistructured questionnaire to collect 
quantitative (i.e., the subjective satisfaction of the 
participants) 
and 
qualitative 
data 
(i.e., 
the 
participants’ 
suggestions 
regarding 
the 
e-book 
systems). 
Step 5: Analyze the numerical data, including the operation 
time, error frequency, and subjective satisfaction. 
III. 
ANALYSIS AND RESULT 
In this section, we present the result of the quantitative 
and qualitative analysis, including the operation time, error 
frequency, and subjective satisfaction. 
A. Operation Time 
Table II shows the average operation time and error 
frequency of the 24 participants when they perform the 10 
experimental tasks. In Table II, T1 toT10 in the first column 
represent Task 1 to Task 10, respectively. Table II shows that 
the operation time of the Zinio e-book system (229.02 
seconds) is faster than the MagV system (261.21 seconds). 
The result suggests that the Zinio e-book system is easier to 
operate compared with MagV.

For a further discussion, there is a significant difference 
when the participants perform T7 on the Zinio system (43.98 
seconds) and the MagV system (104.94 seconds). The 
description of T7 is ‘Please find the first page of the HH 
article, which contains the GG title’, and their corresponding 
operating functions are ‘Content Page’, ‘Drag and Scroll’, 
and/or ‘Up/Down Page’ (please refer to Table I). It indicates 
that when the participants perform T7 by using ‘Content 
Page’, ‘Drag and Scroll’, and/or ‘Up/Down Page’ functions, 
the operation performance on the Zinio system is 
significantly different as compared to the MagV system. In 
53

other words, the operation performance of an e-book system 
could depend largely on its user interface design. 
B. Error Frequency 
An error is defined as any action that does not reach the 
desired goal [7]. In this study, we count the number of such 
actions made by the participants while performing some 
specific tasks. The error frequency is the average of errors 
made by the participants in a specific task. From Table II, the 
error frequency of the Zinio e-book system (1.87 times) is 
less than the MagV system (2.17 times) for completing all 
the tasks. The result indicates that the Zinio e-book system 
results in fewer errors, thus having a faster operation time. 
To further compare the two systems, we perform the 
correlation analysis to examine the relationship of operation 
time and error frequency. The result shows that there is a 
high positive correlation on the Zinio e-book system 
(Pearson’s r=0.736, p=0.015), while the MagV e-book 
system has a very strong positive correlation (Pearson’s 
r=0.951, p=0.001). The result reveals that the participants 
may make few errors while using a system, but the critical 
issue is how fast the users can recover from the errors [10]. 
C. Subjective Satisfaction 
After the 24 participants complete the 10 experimental 
tasks, we distribute the semistructured questionnaire to 
collect quantitative and qualitative data. The participants are 
asked to assess two questions about the interface design (of 
the e-book system): ‘S1: how do you feel regarding the 
visual and aesthetical style of the interface design?’ and ‘S2: 
how do you feel regarding the operation (operating 
efficiency) of the interface design?’ A 5-point scale is 
adopted in the semistructured questionnaire, ranging from 1 
(the lowest satisfaction) to 5 (the highest satisfaction). Figure 
2 shows the result of the participants’ subjective satisfaction 
(S1 and S2). 
 
Figure 2.  Result of the subjective satisfaction. 
The result of S1 (i.e., aesthetics) shows that there is a 
slight difference between the Zinio system (3.92) and the 
MagV system (3.79), while S2 (i.e., operation) has a 
significant difference between them (the Zinio system being 
3.88 and the MagV system being 3.29). We further perform 
the t-test to examine whether a statistical significant 
difference exists or not between these two e-book systems on 
S1 and S2, respectively. The result shows that the t value of 
S1 is 0.54 (p= 0.59> 0.05) and the t value of S2 is 2.30 (p= 
0.03< 0.05). The result indicates that the Zinio interface 
design is more user-friendly and efficient (S2) as perceived 
by the participants, although the visual and aesthetical style 
(S1) of Zinio is identical to that of MagV. This is also 
reflected by the operation time and the error frequency. 
Furthermore, the semistructured questionnaire is also 
used to collect the qualitative data. The participants are asked 
to write down their opinions and suggestions regarding the 
two different e-book systems, as given in Table III. 
TABLE III.  
PARTICIPANTS’ RECOMMENDATIONS 
Zinio E-book System 
MagV E-book System 
• It is easy to read e-books with 
iPad, but lack of the feeling 
about real turning pages. 
• The page number should be 
consistent with the ‘Scroll’ page. 
• It is difficult to find the ‘Content 
Page’, and should be improved 
with hints/tips. 
• How to turn to the next page is 
inconsistent and confusing (e.g. 
some to the right-hand side, and 
others to the left). 
• The book should be marked if 
users have read it, and the label 
of books should be more visible 
and larger. 
• The ‘Scroll’ function is unclear, 
and easy to make an error to turn 
to the next page. 
• The page number should be 
consistent with the ‘Scroll’ page. 
• Users cannot jump onto a 
specific page, but scroll page-by- 
page. 
• The duration of scroll page is 
slower than the reality. 
• For the convenience, books 
should 
be 
categorized 
into 
proper sections. 
• The whole operation is not very 
smooth, and not easy to find the 
specific content. 
• How to turn to the next page is 
inconsistent and confusing (e.g. 
some to the right-hand side, and 
others to the left). 
• Resolution of display is too 
low/fuzzy, particularly when the 
page is scaled up. 
 
According to Table III, there are some common problems 
with respect to the two different e-book systems, such as ‘the 
page number should be consistent with the ‘Scroll’ page’. In 
addition, although the iPad with the touchscreen is intuitive 
for the participants reading e-books, most of the participants 
feel confused and make errors on ‘how to turn to the next 
page’ (because some e-books are to the right-hand side, and 
others are to the left). For further analysis, most of the 
participants prefer combining two or three options (e.g., 
‘Up/Down Page’ with ‘Drag and Scroll’) to read an e-book. 
In addition, the participants also like to navigate the article 
(i.e., page by page) in a similar manner to when reading a 
real book. This result could be provided as a guideline for the 
designers to design an effective user interface that can best 
meet user requirements and satisfaction. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented a usability experimental 
study on two e-book systems (i.e., Zinio and MagV) to 
54

address whether the touchscreen device is user-friendly with 
high subjective satisfaction for e-book readers. The 
experimental study has been conducted to examine if the 
different e-book systems have significant difference in terms 
of the operation time, error frequency, and subjective 
satisfaction. The result has demonstrated that the Zinio e-
book system is easier to operate with few errors compared 
with the MagV system. Moreover, even though the 
touchscreen device is intuitive for the participants reading e-
books, the participants still feel confused and make errors 
due to the poor interface design. Although two e-book 
systems are chosen as an illustration, the user-centered 
approach presented in this study is applicable to other kinds 
of e-book systems (e.g., FlipViewer) for addressing the 
usability issue.
