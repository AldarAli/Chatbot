Abstract—Opportunistic resource sharing, and contacts’ interaction 
in opportunistic networks, faces several resource challenges that 
need to be faced via intelligent combinatorial practices. This work 
proposes a scheme which takes into account the non-synchronized 
motion of the devices in an urban area where an intelligent 
opportunistic socially oriented caching scheme is presented. The 
concept of social centrality is being introduced and modeled, which 
takes into consideration interactions among users. Through the 
proposed model the users’ interactions can be exploited through 
time according to the contact frequency, in order to enable in an 
efficient way opportunistic resource sharing among mobile peers. 
The collaborative opportunistic communication with the proposed 
combined social-oriented model and the gossip-based replication 
scheme is thoroughly evaluated through experimental simulation, 
which takes measures for the end-to-end reliability of the resource 
sharing scheme. The proposed scheme enables efficient resource 
sharing via the social model and the evaluated interactions, 
minimizing at the same time, the delay variations between packets 
and maximizing the efficiency of resource exchange between mobile 
peers.

 INTRODUCTION 
Today, wireless networks are used in many real-time 
applications that offer specialized services ‘on-the-move’, where 
these services require reliable communication and continuous 
end-to-end connectivity. When dealing with resource sharing 
applications, low latency and high responsiveness should be 
supported by the device in a decentralized way, whereas the ease 
of interaction, and the “always-on” connectivity should be 
engaged with users’ demands and their requested data [1]. 
Current devices’ limitations host many problems in the end-to-
end communication, and therefore, are unable to handle resource 
sharing in a reliable manner. The challenging problems expressed 
by these devices are considered very disastrous and impair 
significantly the high responsiveness when devices face 
temporary and unannounced loss of network connectivity while 
they move, whereas they are usually engaged in rather short 
connection sessions since they need to discover other hosts in an 
ad-hoc manner where, then, the requested resources may not be 
available. Therefore, a mechanism that faces the intermittent 
connectivity problem and enables the devices to react to frequent 
changes in the environment, such as change of location or the 
context conditions, the variability of network connectivity, will 
affect significantly the end-to-end reliability and will face the 
unavailability and the scarceness of wireless resources. This work 
proposes a model for combining the resource sharing 
characteristics with the opportunistic content sharing procedure in 
order to offer higher reliability and availability of the requested 
resources. The interaction model that is introduced, and the social 
centrality principle [1] allow the users to share resources among 
devices when a shared contact rate threshold is satisfied, and 
devices follow a stationary non-synchronized motion while the 
connectivity is maintained. Social centrality is evaluated 
according to the usefulness of the location of a node in public 
areas. Usefulness is formed within a context of the connections 
allowed and the bandwidth served for a certain location. 
Opportunistic object/resource sharing [2] takes place in order to 
enable efficient dissemination of files chunks [3] whereas, the 
designed 
model 
guarantees 
the 
end-to-end 
connectivity 
maintenance, in a mobility-enabled cluster-based communication.  
In this work, the proposed socially-oriented model for storing-
and-forwarding for a certain time-cycle requested objects, utilizes 
the network resources (capacity and temporal connectivity) and 
enables high resource exchange. The high resource availability is 
as a result of the utilization of the social centrality principle as 
simulation results show. This work primarily addresses the 
problem of resource sharing in opportunistic systems and uses a 
constrained social caching mechanism. Through the proposed 
model the ability to accommodate in an adaptive way the 
requested data increases, whereas it enables a specified maximum 
number of concurrent users to share resources in a cluster 
according to social-interaction parameters of the users who are 
interacting. The model strengthens or weakens the resource 
exchange scheme according to the social contacts and the 
replication scheme exploited by the user’s interaction parameters. 
In addition, different types of traffic can be supported where the 
adaptability and the robustness is shown by the proposed scheme. 
The structure of this work is as follows: Section II describes 
the related work done and Section III follows presenting the 
proposed social-enabled mechanism for opportunistic resource 
sharing. Section IV presents the performance evaluation of the 
proposed scheme through simulation followed by Section V with 
the conclusions and foundations as well as potential future 
directions.

community, different models were extracted in order to link

communicational problems and connectivity maintenance during 
a communication among peers. Mobility in autonomic 
communication is considered an essential parameter, where, 
along with the user’s demands, they pose the vision of what self-
behaving flexibility should encompass in next-generation self-
tuning 
behavior 
of 
the 
devices[4]. 
The 
opportunistic 
communication aggravates the capacity of the nodes [2][5], 
where the requested information is being forwarded. Obviously, 
the need of modeling the social contacts behavior becomes timely 
nowadays since smartphones are now capable to process 
efficiently any requested information, whereas at the same time 
they can gather information from any hosted application (i.e., 
location aware or social contacts) in order to better utilize the 
network resources.  
From the object sharing perspective, research has extensively 
proposed efficient architectures [6] [7] [8], which rely on local 
information and local devices’ views, without considering the 
global networking context or views, which may be very useful for 
optimizing load balancing, enable adaptive routing, energy 
management, and even some self-behaving properties like self-
organization. Mavromoustakis and Karatza in [9] propose the 
HyMIS scheme, which extends the advantages offered by the 
Hybrid Mobile Infostation System architecture, where the 
Primary Infostation (PI) is not static but can move according to 
the pathway(s) of the roadmaps. However, the HyMIS does not 
consider the social parameters-like the history contract rate and 
the temporal parameters of the users.  
This work’s contribution is to link the file sharing scheme 
with the underlying social parameters in order to optimize the 
efficiency of the resource sharing process. Event dissemination 
protocols use gossip to carry out multicasts. These gossips may 
be even more efficient in broadcasting information, if social 
parameters can be hosted and evaluated in a way that they affect 
the end-to-end resource sharing. Different caching approaches 
were used in the past, for enabling the requested data content to 
be available and discoverable [10] [11] at any time such that 
content can be discovered in a peer-to-peer manner without 
having network partitioning problems. Additionally if requested 
data was at some time window back available then through the 
proposed scheme we can keep an adaptive track of the resources 
and their availability. Mavromoustakis and Karatza in [12] 
consider the impact of impatience on optimal content 
dissemination scheme and a general model to capture this impact 
and show that under very general assumptions, the impatience 
function. However the contact relation and the history of the 
mobile peers is not yet explored due to the complexity and the 
dynamic nature that these environments impose. However 
selective and criteria-based dissemination procedures that take 
into consideration the social mobility and the social interactions 
in order to gather an allocation index for each ranked request by 
each peer, based on mobile nodes’ content requirements is still a 
relatively unexplored area.  
This work proposes an efficient way to optimize the end-to-
end resource sharing reliability by enhancing the replications of 
the high ranked requested objects by users using a social-oriented 
methodology. The social-oriented model introduces the social 
centrality, and is utilized for selectively storing -for a certain 
time-cycle- the requested objects, whereas it considers the motion 
and movement characteristic of the devices for enabling 
optimized reliability, reduced traffic and generated overhead. The 
proposed scheme combines the strengths of both selective 
replication in opportunistic communication systems utilizing the 
outsourcing concept and attempts to fill the trade-offs between 
user’s mobility, reliable file sharing and on-demand requested file 
availability limitation in the end-to-end path. Examination for the 
effectiveness of the proposed scheme is performed through 
simulation taking into consideration the offered reliability by the 
collaborative-social caching replication scheme within the 
mobility context. Thorough evaluations have been performed for 
the throughput optimization and the variation in the grade of 
robustness during the file sharing process among mobile peers, as 
well as for the throughput response.

PROBABILISTIC RANDOM WALK MOTION FOR EFFICIENT 
END-TO-END RESOURCE SHARING USING OPPORTUNISTIC 
SOCIALLY ORIENTED CACHING 
Assuming that a source needs to send requested packets or 
stream of packets (file) to a destination where the destination 
moves from one location to another. This implies that, in a non-
static multi-hop environment, there is a need to model the motion 
and the requested resources in the end-to-end path such that the 
resources can be efficiently shared among users, whereas any 
redundant transmissions and retransmissions are avoided. This 
work proposes a clustered-based mobility configuration scenario, 
which is set in Figure 1. Clusters enable the connectivity between 
nodes and the local (within a cluster) control of a specified area. 
On the contrary with [12][13] in this work a different mobility 
scenario is modeled and hosted in the scheme, which enables a 
parameterized feedback provision through the modeled scheme. 
Unlike the predetermined Landscape in [12], in this work, the 
mobility scenario used is Fractional Random Walk. The random 
walk mobility model was derived from the Brownian motion, 
which is a stochastic process that models random continuous 
motion [14]. In this model, a mobile node moves from its current 
location with a randomly selected speed in a randomly selected 
direction as real time mobile users act. However the real time 
mobility that the users express, can be defined by spotting out 
some environmental stimulating elements (adverts, cinema, 
shopping mall et.c) where users’ decisions may be affected. In 
the proposed scenario the new speed and direction are both 
chosen from predefined ranges, [vmin, vmax] and [0, 2π), 
respectively [15]. The new speed and direction are maintained for 
an arbitrary length of time randomly chosen from(0, tmax]. At the 
end of the chosen time, the node makes a memoryless decision of 
a new random speed and direction. Figure 1(a) shows the 
scenario where the associations and the potential coverage area of 
a node is depicted. The movements are shown as a Fractional 
Random Walk (FRW) on a Weighted Graph.  
Taking into consideration the movement of each device and 
by using the graph theoretical model, a device can perform 
random movements according to the topological graph G = (V,E) 
where it comprises of a pair of sets V (or V(G)) and E (or E(G)) 
called vertices (or nodes) and edges (or arcs), respectively, where 
the edges join different pairs of vertices. This work considers a 
connected graph with n nodes labeled {1, 2, . . . , n} in a cluster 
nL with weight wij ≥ 0 on the edge (i, j). If edge (i, j) does not 
exist, we set wij = 0.We assume that the graph is undirected so

that wij = wji. A particle walks from node to node in the graph in 
the following random walk/movement manner. Given that the 
device/particle is currently at node i, the next node j is chosen 
from among the neighbors of i with probability:

is the interaction coefficient measured as in eq. 2. This 
work uses the representation of the interactions by utilizing 
notations of weighted graphs (equation 1). An example of social 
network is represented in Figure 1(a) where each node represents 
one person. The weights associated with each edge linking two 
persons (two devices) of the network are used to model the 
strength of the interactions between individuals [16]. The 
assumption made lays within the context that these weights are 
expressed as a measure of the strength of the social relations of 
the linking parts. Then the degree of social interaction between 
two people/devices can be expressed as a value in the range [0, 
1]. These social interaction coefficients have a simplistic mean 
that, when 0 is expressed, it indicates that there is no interaction; 
whereas when 1 is expressed, it indicates that there is a strong 
social interaction. This aspect will affect the outsourcing degree 
of the requests in order to be available by other users in any 
cluster as 3.A’s section show. Therefore, the connectivity of 
interactions in the network of Figure 1 can be represented by the 
5×5 symmetric matrix (matrix is based on the population in the 
network and the hosted clusters), where the names of nodes 
correspond to both rows and columns and are ordered based on 
the interaction and connectivity. Matrix Iij is referred to, as the 
Interaction Matrix. The generic element i,j represents the 
interaction between two individuals i and j where the diagonal 
elements represent the relationships that an individual has with 
himself and are set, conventionally, to 1. In (2), the Iij represents 
all the links associated to a weight before applying the threshold 
values, which will indicate the stronger association between two 
individuals.

A. Using social centrality for replicated object policy 
One of the key tasks in wireless network analysis is 
determining the relative importance of individuals based on their 
positions, connectivity structure and motion through time. One 
concept in measuring and combining these aspects of the 
behavior of wireless networks is referred to as the centrality of 
individual devices with respect to the placement and behavior of 
each individual device in the cluster. Thus by using centrality 
approximation, a subset of the individuals in the network is 
sampled, and an induced subgraph consisting only of these 
individuals, and the links among them is produced, as a 
representative sample at time t. The centrality computation, then, 
is performed on this induced subgraph instead of the entire 
network, with the centrality scores of the sample being used as 
approximations. This work uses the social centrality as a measure 
                                                           
1 Constant values for a= 0.08, b=0.005 are design parameters and were found to 
consist a suitable set (see [16] for more calculations on these estimations), based 
on the network’s dimension at a certain time.

of the generic centrality of the system and the relative 
associations. Thus in the system with moving devices, a node that 
is directly connected with many nodes and has high 
ijI  can be 
considered as a high degree node. In other words, the lower 
degree nodes need the high degree nodes to serve as a bridge in 
order to connect with other lower degree nodes. According to the 
high degree nodes, the degree or centrality

D denotes the direct connectivity. A maximum number of

Centrality indicates the relative importance of a node in a 
network [17] and the relative contribution of this node to the 
communication process (in terms of duration and distance 
covered with the frequency, and parameterized in the context of 
avoiding communication partitioning problems). The social 
centrality is a relative measure of the betweenness centrality of 
two or more nodes. Social centrality is a type of centrality, that 
measures the number of times a node is chosen to host the ‘best 
effort’ parameters (in terms of storage, capacity and betweeness 
location) for time t in L, for, which requested data can be 
outsourced to this node. Therefore, a node with high social 
betweenness centrality

 indicates the capability 
and transmitability of the node i to diffuse a certain requested 
object according to the ranked criteria of each requested object in 
L for a time t.  
1) Ranking requested resources according to users’ 
demands 
In order to define which requested objects should be outsourced 
for being available for future requests, a ranking model has been 
applied as follows: To find the rank of an object a1 a2 . . . am, 
one should find the number of objects preceding it. It can be 
found by the following function: 
function rank(a1, a2, . . . , am |L)// ranking the a1, a2, .. in L 
cluster 
rank← 1 ; 
for i ← 1 to m do 
while  (k has any neighbor with ai ) do 
rank ← rank + N(a1, a2, . . . , ai−1) 
where the function above indicates which resources are highly 
demanded and are ranked according to these demands for the 
first k-hop nodes in the path.  
2) Cluster merging and transfers’ minimization 
This work has utilized a cluster merging notation, where, if a 
resource is available from a nearby user in another Cluster 
accessible in a specified number of hops, a virtual merging 
mechanism has been enabled similar with the cluster merging in 
[18]. This means that by the utilization of the MinMax Cut 
algorithm proposed in [18], the cluster is partitioned in a way to 
make a distinction between pair-wise similarities with regards to 
the requested objects.  
B. Optimistic intracluster outsourcing scheme using social 
interactions  
In order to enable the proposed combination of the weights of 
the motion, with the interaction matrix and its elements of the 
matrix denoted as the interaction indicators we have modeled a 
mechanism for diffusing the requested high ranked resources to 
be outsourced. The diffusion policy used is using a resource 
sharing model, which reflects the impact of the mobility and the 
impact of the interaction indicators onto the proposed diffusion 
mechanism. Equation 4 shows the quantitative resource sharing 
approach by using the 
ij
M  as a function of the contact rate and 
the number of users that are interacting (or not) in the cluster. The 
model is similar with the [12] in the sense that, the 
epidemiological model that is used in [12] is being replaced by 
the social interactions and the elements of the interaction 
indicators. We assume that a common lookup service is followed 
by all devices in the network cooperating via a shared platform. 
This model is providing feedback via the interactions performed 
ij
M and the number of users that are not interacting within time 
frame t. Suppose there are u hosts in the system, then a host is 
sharing a resource with β(u−1) other hosts per unit time. I  (k−1) 
are the number of users that are not interacting with (i,j) taking 
into account the threshold values, and/or are newly entered users 
in the cluster and have no relation/interaction with i,j. Therefore,

storage units and memories. The delete or Purging Enforcement

IV. 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS THROUGH SIMULATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
In the implementation-simulation of the proposed scenario, 
C/Objective programming language libraries were used as in [2]. 
The movement patterns generator was implemented to produce 
primarily traces for the ns-2 simulator [19]. All mobile nodes 
collaborate via a shared application that uses a distributed look-
up service. Radio coverage is small compared to the area covered 
by all nodes, so that most nodes cannot contact each other 
directly. Additionally, we assume IEEE 802.11x as the 
underlying radio technology supporting the Cluster-based 
Routing Protocol (CRP). Queries regarding the resources that are 
available by peers for sharing, are generated dynamically and are 
selectively cached onto nodes according to Section III.A (eq. 
3.4), where requested resources are ranked according to users’ 
demands. The community is following the FRW on a Weighted 
Graph and consists of 250 users diffused in a landscape. The 
interaction of a particular user affects the contact rate and the 
interaction matrix entries of the next moment as real time users

Figures 3(a) and (b) show the Successful packet Delivery Ratio 
(SDR) with the End-to-end resource sharing capacity (MB) and 
Cumulative distribution of the number of users that are experiencing 
inter-contact. Figure 3(b) shows that if users will outsource the 
requested resources using the interaction model, then the associated 
SDR increases significantly and the number of completed files are 
also increasing. Figure 4 shows the number of Clusters/download

the social centrality of the node increases, which means that the node 
has greater likelihood of its spatial and temporal location then the 
SDR increases and the inter-cluster contact time is reduced. Figures

CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH 
This work considers the probabilistic social interactions in 
order to assign available resources to communicating nodes 
according to a combined mobility model and the users’ social 
relations. The collaborative resource sharing is achieved through 
the opportunistic socially-oriented caching model. Based on 
users’ mobility and the associated probabilistic variation based on 
time and location, the social-based selective replication enables 
the cache-and-forward outsourcing model to fill the trade-offs 
between user’s mobility, and reliable file sharing. The scheme 
outperforms from other existing schemes due to the social model 
which 
enables 
on-demand 
requested 
file 
availability. 
Examination for the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is 
performed through simulation taking into consideration the 
offered reliability by the collaborative-social caching replication 
scheme within the mobility context. Experimental results show 
that by introducing interaction parameters to mobile users while 
sharing 
resources 
on-the-move, 
the 
reliability 
increases 
significantly. Next steps and on-going work within the current 
research context will be the expansion of this model into a file 
sharing platform where on-the-move the users can share 
resources in real-time.
