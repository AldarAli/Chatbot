Abstract—This paper presents the main research results on
a major task for knowledge discovery: The integration of
knowledge resources and advanced association processing. The
research includes the integration of references to many types
of objects and elements, e.g., adding conceptual knowledge via
references to a universal classiﬁcation. Creating sustainable multi-
disciplinary knowledge resources and enabling advanced features
for processing of associations is one of the major goals of long-
term knowledge development and discovery, especially allowing
the use of advanced association processing and computation
facilities. Research has shown that discovery in geosciences and
archaeology widely beneﬁts from a multi-disciplinary approach.
The paper also presents respective association processing results
exploiting the integration of such geoscientiﬁc and archaeological
knowledge resources components. The practical application
scenario is based on content from a natural sciences and
archaeology research and studies campaign at the ancient city of
Kameiros, Greece. The created resources are providing content,
structures, and features for exploiting computation facilities,
especially a multitude of reference types. The focus is to
integrate multi-disciplinary knowledge resources and association
processing, which allows to extend and exploit long-term content
discovery on a data-centric base and gain new insights.

INTRODUCTION
This extended research presents the main results on a major
task for knowledge discovery: The integration of knowledge
resources and advanced association processing. The research
is based on the results from multi-disciplinary projects for the
creation of objects and concordances, which are intended to be
used for long-term knowledge creation knowledge processing,
and advanced computing. The basic fundaments of the results
were presented at the DigitalWorld / GEOProcessing 2016 con-
ferences in Venice, Italy [1]. Previous research was conducted
for creating knowledge resources and developing application
components for supporting and providing advanced integrated
systems for geoscientiﬁc, multi-disciplinary, and multi-lingual
application scenarios. Existing data collections, unstructured
and structured, combine a number of insufﬁcient features
and drawbacks, missing long-term aspects, support for multi-
disciplinary conceptual knowledge, for classiﬁcation, and for
advanced and fuzzy methods like associations.
The purpose of the integration of the developed resources
and components is to provide advanced knowledge object
features, especially association processing features and compu-
tation in context with long-term multi-disciplinary and multi-
lingual knowledge documentation and discovery. The new
resources and application developments presented here are
based on selected frameworks and resources, which have
been created over the last two decades. The knowledge re-
sources and Collaboration house framework [2] allowed for
the implementation of multi-disciplinary, long-term knowl-
edge resources and application components, for dynamical
use as well as for complex and high end computation. The
resulting components are used for universal and consistent
documentation of knowledge and scientiﬁc research, and for
consequent long-term purposes. These components are created
using a universal classiﬁcation [3], a ﬂexible and portable
all-purpose programming environment [4], and appropriate
international standards [5]. In this case, for advanced as-
sociation processing, new workﬂows had to be created and
dynamically integrated into the framework components. Such
implementation is possible if on the one hand the components’
workﬂows allow a ﬂexible integration of workﬂows, e.g., via
scripting and compiled sources and on the other hand that
structured knowledge resources can be extended for allowing
a multitude of references types. The combination allows to
create associations by making use of the available structures,
processing, and computation facilities. For these purposes, the
object and media knowledge resources and the framework
components were basically extended to support a data-centric
approach.
This data-centric approach includes the integration of ref-
erences to many types of multi-disciplinary knowledge re-
sources’ objects and elements, e.g., adding conceptual knowl-
edge via references to a universal classiﬁcation. Therefore, the
implementations and case study focus on spanning disciplines.
In this case the major starting points are geosciences and
archaeology and their referenced disciplines’ context.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II presents the
state of integration and frameworks with knowledge resources.
Sections III and IV introduce the integration of workﬂows and
reference types. Sections V and VI discuss the creation and
processing of associations and how computational facilities can
be exploited. Section VII presents and discusses an integration
case study and implementation in context of geosciences
and archaeology. Sections VIII and IX give an evaluation,
present the main results and summarise the lessons learned,
conclusions and future work.

STATE OF INTEGRATION AND FRAMEWORKS
The resources and implementations are based on the in-
tegration of three major components: An architecture frame-
work, long-term, multi-disciplinary knowledge resources, and
a mostly widely used universal classiﬁcation framework. The
architecture implemented for an economical long-term strategy
is data-centric and based on development blocks. Figure 1
shows the three main columns: Application resources, knowl-
edge resources, and originary resources. The central block
in the “Collaboration house” framework architecture [6], is
represented by the knowledge resources, scientiﬁc resources,
object collections, containers, databases, and documentation
(e.g., LX [7], collections, containers). These resources provide
multi-disciplinary content, context, and references, including
structured and unstructured data, factual and conceptual knowl-
edge.

within the long-term architecture. Three major layers labelled (1), (2), (3).
The resources also refer to originary resources and sources
(e.g., textual data, media data, photos, scientiﬁc data, lit-
erature). The knowledge resources are used as a universal
component for compute and storage workﬂows. This feature
can also be applied for supporting dynamical and ontology-
based multi-agent, e.g., for production management as with
the implementation supported by the European Framework
Programme 7 (FP7) [8]. Application resources and compo-
nents (Active Source, Active Map, local applications) are
implementations for analysing, utilising, and processing data
and making the information and knowledge accessible. The
related information, all data, and algorithm objects presented
are copyright the author of this paper, LX Foundation Sci-
entiﬁc Resources [7], all rights reserved. The structure and
the classiﬁcation references based on the LX resources and
UDC [9], especially mentioning the well structured editions
[3] and the multi-lingual features [10], are essential means
for the processing workﬂows and evaluation of the knowledge
objects and containers. Both provide strong multi-disciplinary
and multi-lingual support. The three blocks are supported by
services’ interfaces. The interfaces interact with the physical
resources: In the local workspace, in the compute and storage
resources where the knowledge resources are situated, and in
the storage resources for the originary resources. The layers
or ‘levels’ are labelled (1), (2), and (3) within the architecture.
(1) is associated with the disciplines creating and using knowl-
edge resources, application resources, and originary resources,
‘realia’. (2) is associated with the tasks and contributions of
services providers. (3) is associated with the computer and
storage resources provided by resources providers. All of these
components do allow for advanced scientiﬁc computing and
data processing, as well as the access of compute and storage
resources via services interfaces. The resources’ needs depend
on the application scenarios to be implemented for user groups.
The framework allows to create any collaboration required
for the development and operation of knowledge resources,
required services, and High End Computing resources like
compute and storage.
III.
INTEGRATION OF WORKFLOWS
The integration of association processing workﬂows with the
workﬂows for creating arbitrary result matrices is most ﬂexible
and efﬁcient and was based on the organisation and object
features (Figure 2) in the knowledge resources. Object details
and deﬁnitions have been discussed with computational views
[11]. Workﬂow steps are labelled with lowercase letters. Layers
are labelled with numbers, primary layers are underlined.
The illustration shows that object information is gathered
from the objects and references in collections and containers.
Conﬁgurable algorithms like ﬁlters and mapping are then used
to compute a result matrix. The result matrix is considered
“intermediate” because any of such workﬂows can be used in
combination with other workﬂows, workﬂow chains or further
processing.

IV.
IMPLEMENTATION OF REFERENCE TYPES
Objects can carry any type of references. Objects can be
grouped, e.g., in collections or containers. When larger groups
are created then also these groups can carry their references.
These references may occur in any combination but in practice
these references will be a subset or a complementary set to the
objects’ references. Objects can be created by manual, auto-
mated, and hybrid means. Therefore, any type of references of
that kind may exist.
Tables I and II show excerpts of the references, which were
added to be used within the knowledge resources for two types
of object groups, namely collections and containers.

The reference types are organised in three major groups:
Object collections (O), object containers (C), and external or
externally created references (E).
This case study primarily addresses geoscientiﬁc and archae-
ological resources. The resources were extended for using a
multitude of references types of creating associations (Tables II
and I). Therefore, the resources especially contain georefer-
ences, UDC classiﬁcations for any object, including complex
conceptual knowledge, geoclassiﬁcation, concordances like
Universal Classiﬁed Classiﬁcation (UCC) [12], and Content
Factors [13] in order to describe [14] the content. Many refer-
ence types are part of the objects. Nevertheless, in practice, the
organisation of references is more uniform within containers.
The reference types shown provide a lot of information
regarding content and context, which could otherwise not be
deducted from the object data itself. In addition, all reference
types may exist in multiple views, multiple languages, and
multiple context – any of which can be added in instances
created by manual, automatic, and hybrid means.
V.
CREATION OF ASSOCIATIONS AND PROCESSING MEANS
As far as the algorithms implemented in components carry
essential information for processing and computation, e.g., for
creating new results and output, they should be documented
with the knowledge resources themselves. As associations can
be created by arbitrary workﬂows, it is most important to
know, which components can carry which facilities and how
to exploit, e.g., in a multi-disciplinary context like geosciences
and archaeology. Important aspects for the quality of results
of the association processing are geocoordinates, associations,
conceptual knowledge, and supporting methodologies.
Geocoordinates’ data is for example used to spatially select
and associate objects. Geocoordinates can be part of
•
knowledge objects,
•
containers and container objects,
•
references (e.g., knowledge resources’ references or
Google Maps references).
Conceptual knowledge data, e.g., used for the classiﬁcation of
objects of any kind, can be part of
•
knowledge objects,
•
containers and container objects,
•
unstructured data, mostly used with automated processes
with lower quality results.
Associations can especially result from rich content, from
constellations of content and
•
context in object collections,
•
context in object containers,
•
in-text references (comparisons, see, . . .),
•
internally,
•
link-references (links to external resources),
•
external resources,
•
between all components.
Supporting methodologies and technologies, which can be
exploited for the creation and processing of associations are
•
string comparisons,
•
transliterations,
•
phonetics,
•
statistics,
•
metadata,
•
Content Factor,
•
object elements rhythm,
•
dynamical data, . . .
Associations were used for developing knowledge resources,
optimising result matrices, e.g., within knowledge discovery
workﬂows, creating concordances, creating references, improv-
ing knowledge objects and resources, gaining new knowl-
edge. The combination allows various degrees of precision
and fuzzyness as required for spanning multi-disciplinary and
multi-lingual data. An optimisation can improve the quality
of data, especially the quality of associations introduced for
automated classiﬁcation of unstructured data.

EXPLOITATION OF COMPUTATION FACILITIES
Within the layers, there are three kinds of facilities, which
are targets to be exploited by computation.
(1)
First block: Knowledge resources.
Storage services and resources.
◦
Purpose: Data.
◦
Task/Method: Creation, development, maintenance
processes.
◦
Implementation: Editing components, versioning
tools, and high end text editors are used to-
gether with automation tools and scripting. The
knowledge resources themselves are based on fully
portable structures and markup.
(2)
Second block: Services and interfaces.
Layer: Dedicated infrastructure.
◦
Purpose: Workﬂows.
◦
Task/Method: Scripting, workﬂow description.
◦
Implementation: Perl, Tcl, and C are used for an
implementation.
(3)
Third block: Processing.
Layer: Compute services and resources.
◦
Purpose: Individual and parallelised processes and
tasks as well as dynamical and interactive pro-
cesses.
◦
Task/Method: Batch system, conﬁguration, dedi-
cated resources.
◦
Implementation: Here, Portable Batch System
(PBS), Torque, and Moab are used, formerly also
IBM LoadLeveler and Condor. As far as required
for a certain scenario also dynamical or interactive
jobs can be executed.
The exploitation of computation facilities is mostly based
on these three featured component groups and the described
implementation. This realises the purposes of extracting data
and information, utilising workﬂow scripts, and submitting
dynamical and batch jobs.
VII.
INTEGRATION AND ASSOCIATION CASE STUDY
The implementation has been done according to the de-
scribed architecture and enabling the required association
processing workﬂows based on the available components.
Therefore, the major implementation tasks concentrated on
the content related facilities, especially the geoscientiﬁc and
archaeological knowledge resources, and the application com-
ponents, which delivered an appropriate starting point for
a case study. The respective features were created in the
knowledge resources’ objects, which were under continuous
development over the last decades in the LX knowledge
resources. The application components have been extended and
conﬁgured to work with the required application scenario. This
includes the dynamical components from the Geo Exploration
and Information (GEXI) project, e.g., the actmap components,
based on Perl and Tcl scripting, C and Fortran.
The implementation for the case study was integrated with
the the base for this case study, the long-term knowledge
resources (LX Foundation Scientiﬁc Resources), which were
developed and used over several decades, including geoscien-
tiﬁc and archaeological objects and containers. A case study
example based on the created resources is presented with the
following workﬂow.
A. Volcano and Rhodos association discovery workﬂow
The workﬂow starts with the target to ﬁnd possible associ-
ations and links between “Vesuvius” and “Rhodos”.
1)
Entry nodes: Vesuvius – Rhodos (Rhodos/Rhodes etc.).
2)
Criteria and deﬁnition set.
3)
Filter association processing criteria.
4)
Filter association processing.
5)
Selection and generation of compute instructions.
6)
Sorting.
7)

8)
Selection.
9)
First level association - both nodes.
10)
Second level association.
11)
Common object 1 and 2 (level 1).
12)
Common object 11 and 22 (level 2).
Steps 2) to 5) of the workﬂow analyse and implement the
criteria and deﬁnitions for the request and prepare the appro-
priate compute instructions. Steps 6) to 8) handle the sorting,
formatting, and the selection of the intermediate result matrix.
Steps 9) and 10) generate a ﬁrst level association and after that
a second level association. The concluding steps 11) and 12)
generate the common objects for levels 1 and 2.
B. Resources and content
As an example, an object excerpt for one of the entry
nodes is shown in Figure 4, which shows a referenced

The association processing “Vesuvius – Rhodos” revealed the
reference to Vesuvius / (via Kameiros-associated citations)
Pozzuoli / pozzolan. The excerpt also delivers a number of
associated references on ancient concrete technology [15],
cementitious materials [16], history of concrete [17], and
evolution of concrete [18].
Looking for secondary documentation on eruptions being
associated with Pozzuoli, e.g., the 1631 eruption of Vesuvius,
delivers bibliographic sources like [19], which provides a lot
of unique context information from an original source. This
means there are several associations linking Vesuvius with
Rhodos and one link is a technology, based on material from
geoscientiﬁc context, documented in an archaeological site.
Figure 9 shows an excerpt of a referenced Thera object

The matrix element delivers additional information and ref-
erences, e.g., to volcanic features containers via the volcano
number (VNUM) and the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI).
In this means, the knowledge resources provide data and
references for the association routines. Result matrices are
computed from the association result matrix elements (example
excerpts Figures 8 and 9), which have been deducted from the
knowledge resources using the association routines.

Figure 10. Intermediate result matrix output, groups (excerpt).
The example contains excerpts of three different element
groups. The according object entries are “Vesuvius”, “poz-
zolan”, and “Kameiros”.
The potential number of referenced objects in an interme-
diate result matrix depends on the references sources and the
discovery algorithms. The number used for further steps de-
pends on selection and ﬁlter criteria applied for the respective
context. The potential elements and the number of elements
in a group can vary depending on the resources and objects
referred.
The groups result from association processing of knowledge
resources’ objects. The groups contain intermediate matrix
element references referring to the objects integrated into the
knowledge resources. Examples for this case are shown in
Table III.

The matrix elements allow various precise (e.g., see, see

When we extend the discovery and integrate chronological
and associated objects and locations from the resources then
the result matrix also includes years with volcanic, geological,
geophysical, and technological context. Possible sources are
collections and containers.

The example contains excerpts of additional entries resulting
for the three according object entries “Vesuvius”, “pozzolan”,
and “Kameiros” from the above example case. Two aspects
are most interesting for the discovery:
1)
The new content and context, e.g., the context of
Pantheon, Caesarea Maritima, and the Hagia Sophia in
the context of Kameiros, Rhodos.
2)
The possibility of referencing classiﬁcations to groups
of content and context, e.g., date, location, and material.
These groups contain additional matrix elements referring to
the objects integrated into the knowledge resources. An excerpt
of additional matrix entry references from objects is shown in
Table IV.

FROM ASSOCIATION PROCESSING (EXCERPT).
Matrix Element

In this case, all the additional references result from texts
integrated in object texts (MATRIXtextintext). The associated
additional information from the object references contains
chronological information, location information, and material
information.
The overall result is a very rich matrix. With its elements,
an advanced matrix links different content and context from
many hundreds to many thousands of objects and sources. The
listing depicts the content of the result matrix in a readable
formatting and excerpts some elements.
The matrix also contains references to the source data
within the knowledge resources (for examples on media and
citation references see Figure 8) and also refers to many other
structured and unstructured data, e.g.,
•
terms,
•
names,
•
locations,
•
georeferences,
•
bibliographic data,
•
citations,
•
classiﬁcation, and
•
media data.
As has been shown, media data can be integrated and docu-
mented with the knowledge resources, e.g., either as objects
or sub-objects. This documentation also allows dependencies
between object.
D. The integrated Kameiros’ media references results
Media objects contain own references, e.g., classiﬁcation,
citations, documentation, and keywords and can therefore
contribute in many ways to new insight – besides their intrinsic
media content. The following photo data (Figure 12) from the
media references for “Kameiros” was delivered by the result
matrix.
The photos have been taken in 2013 by the Knowledge in
Motion (KiM) natural sciences and archaeology sections in the
ancient city of Kameiros on Rhodos, Greece, during the Geo
Exploration and Information (GEXI) Eastern Mediterranean
research and studies campaign. Today, the location on the
western coast of the island of Rhodes is named Kam´ıros.

Figure 12. Integrated media photo objects associated with the knowledge
object “Kameiros”, referring to pozzolane and Vesuvius (LX resources).
The data shows the respective photo objects integrated with
the knowledge resources and usable with the association pro-
cessing, which were resulting for the presented case study. The
sort order of the photo object chain reﬂects the arrangements
of the locations: On top level to bottom level of the excavated
site (photo objects from left to right, from top to bottom).
In detail, the results show in this sort order
1)
the top level water tank,
2)
the top level water pipeline following downhill,
3)
an excavated part of the water pipeline,
4)
a lower level water tank,
5)
a single element of the water pipeline system,
6)
and a bottom level water tank.
Object chains can be created by their objects’ attributes, e.g.,
in this case by classiﬁcation, spatial position, and altitude.
The water tanks are coated with the ‘pozzolan’ cement
material, part of which are still in place, e.g., in the bottom
level water tank.
Each of the objects in the object chain contains classi-
ﬁcation references to the pozzolan material, therefore the
objects provide the missing link: These references from ancient
Kameiros are also associated with Vesuvius volcano and refer
to the later Roman adoption of comparable cement ‘pozzolan’
technology. These Rhodian realia are widely associated with

natural phenomena, therefore this is reﬂected for the objects
by many references [20] to respective phenomena and other
places, e.g., on Rhodes, like Epta Piges, Rodini Park, the
Nymphaion of Rhodes, cisterns, as well as geological water
level marks.
Continuation of the case study [21] has conceived the
documentation available and planning the additional research
and development and the data to be collected and added to the
knowledge resources.

EVALUATION
The integration of multi-disciplinary knowledge resources
and association processing can provide large beneﬁts for
creating result matrices and content. The integration and imple-
mentation is consequently data-centric. The implementation is
as well as far data-centric as possible: “The term data-centric
refers to a focus, in which data is most relevant in context
with a purpose. Data structuring, data shaping, and long-term
aspects are important concerns. Data-centricity concentrates
on data-based content and is beneﬁcial for information and
knowledge and for emphasizing their value. The value of
knowledge depends on the ‘currency’ used for individual
scenarios.
The value of an integration depends on the scenario and
priorities. There is no general knowledge-based means avail-
able for deﬁning the value of integration and implementation
other than by the value of knowledge gained. Technical imple-
mentations need to consider distributed data, non-distributed
data, and data locality and enable advanced data handling and
analysis. Implementations should support separating data from
technical implementations as far as possible.” [22].
According to the deﬁnition this means, that data and
technical implementations can be separated and the created
knowledge resources and technical components comply to the
above criteria.
The structure and the aggregation of references increase
the ﬂexibility of possible workﬂows. Increasing the quality of
data in the described type of long-term knowledge resources
– by including references – can increase the quality of result
matrices from discovery processes.
The examined case showed that a technology and material,
which have not been explicitely documented in context of a
knowledge resources object, can be associated with the context
of different objects. Here, the Greek origin of the “pozzolan”
technology was associated, which was named after the later
use in Roman times.
Association processing can support discovery processes even
when references are not explicitely available in text and doc-
umentation, and would therefore be unexpected or unknown.
Association processing can use multi-level discovery in order
to gain additional information, which is not visible from an
otherwise isolated documentation.
The developed structures and methods can be widely bene-
ﬁcial for knowledge development and discovery as well as for
creating implementations for advanced discovery components.
The methodology allows to extend and exploit long-term multi-
disciplinary content documentation and discovery and gain
new insights from otherwise not associated data.
IX.
CONCLUSION
This paper presented the research on the integration of
knowledge resources and advanced association processing and
presented features and beneﬁts for the processing of associa-
tions. Major results from the resources side as well as from
the research on geosciences and archaeology were shown.
First, the research shows that knowledge resources and
association processing can be integrated most efﬁciently and
ﬂexibly. The major reason is, that structured knowledge re-
sources can be successfully extended for allowing a multitude
of integrated references types, e.g., geoclassiﬁcation and me-
dia. The structured resources can also carry references and
associations to differently structured or unstructured resources.
Besides structured resources, also scenarios based on unstruc-
tured resources can beneﬁt from an integration.
Second, the implementation shows that integration is least
invasive to the knowledge resources and to the workﬂows. For
both, knowledge resources and implementations, an arbitrary
individual development can be preserved. The required parts
of the workﬂows can stay modular.
The elements from associations contained in the result
matrix are not procurable when using only plain methods
like simple string search or plain discovery. Furthermore,
the integration of methods, e.g., association, classiﬁcation,
and phonetic algorithms, allows any degree of precision and
fuzziness.
A layered concept can be deployed with the implementation
of computation and storage facilities. From the structural and
knowledge point of view, the extended features are least
invasive to the described type of knowledge resources and
procedures.
From the geoscientiﬁc and archaeological side the factual
results are most notable because the methodology integrates
multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual knowledge beyond con-
ventional means and shows a large number of associations,
which cross multiple disciplines and languages.
The association processing has shown to beneﬁt from ad-
ditional elements referring to objects added to intermediate
result matrices. Different data and media can be included, e.g.,
by documentation and classiﬁcation, which vastly extends the
spectrum of possible applications and can foster new insight.
The ﬂexibility of the knowledge processing beneﬁts from the
advanced organisation of the data, which enables various scal-
able computational means for implementing directed graphs to
fuzzy links, for which High End Computing resources can be
deployed.
Future work will be focussed on further developing the
multi-disciplinary knowledge resources and creating advanced
methods for describing the content and context of objects.
It will be interesting to see applications of an integration of
knowledge resources and association processing as resulting
from this research. Feedback on the used ‘currency’ and
the value of knowledge and data from different scenarios
will be welcome. The new method should carry facilities for
supporting long-term knowledge development and analysis as
well as for enabling automation and High End Computing.
