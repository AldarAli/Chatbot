Abstract—This paper outlines some of the challenges that 
currently face healthcare systems in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
(KSA). Increasing and continuing demand for healthcare 
services is aggravated by a critical shortage of health human 
resources (HHR) and healthcare facilities (HCFs) especially in 
rural areas. In 2013, 17.8% of the population lived in rural and 
remote areas with a huge disparity in HCFs distribution, and 
76% of physicians and 44.7% of nurses are non-Saudis. 
Current studies have shown the potential of telemedicine to 
alleviate these challenges. The use of telemedicine has been 
adopted and the telemedicine roadmap has been developed by 
the Ministry of Health (MOH) in KSA in collaboration with 
Canada Health Infoway (Infoway). This roadmap has 
identified many barriers and challenges likely to face the 
implementation of telemedicine in KSA. This paper describes a 
holistic framework to address these challenges and to assess 
telemedicine applications in order to assist decision makers of 
HCFs in KSA. The proposed framework is developed in 
collaboration with the National eHealth Strategy and Change 
Management Office in the Ministry of Health (MOH) and 
Prince Mohammad Medical City (PMMC) in KSA.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Saudi Arabia's government is committed to provide free 
healthcare services to all Saudi citizens [1]. The Ministry of 
Health (MOH) is responsible for managing the country’s 
healthcare system through the healthcare facilities (HCF) 
who are the core provider and represent 60% of the total 
healthcare services in the KSA. While some HCFs, who are 
under governmental sectors, provide services to their 
employees and their families, other HCFs, who provide 
private healthcare, are mostly located in urban areas [2].  
The healthcare system in KSA is complex as the MOH is 
responsible for the supervision of HCFs in all sectors [2]. In 
2013, MOH operated 2,279 Primary Healthcare Centres 
(PHCs) and approximately 3,000 hospitals with 37,921 beds 
[3]. It delivers healthcare services at three levels: (1) the 
primary healthcare centres (PHCs), (2) public hospitals 
(Outpatient Clinic), and (3) central or specialised hospitals 
(Medical City) [2][4]. The PHCs are the primary level and 
the cornerstone of the Saudi healthcare system allowing the 
MOH to provide healthcare services to the population in 
KSA that includes vaccinations, common procedures, and 
mother-and-child 
services 
[2]. 
The 
public 
hospitals 
(Outpatient Clinic) are the secondary level where  cases that 
require more advanced care both preventive and curative 
are referred to be detected by specialists or consultants, while 
cases that need 
more complex levels of care are 
transferred to central or specialised 
hospitals 
(medical 
city) (the tertiary and third level of healthcare) [4]. In 
some exceptional cases, where the cases are very complex or 
rare, patients are referred to either King Faisal Specialist 
Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC) or outside KSA 
for treatment ( the quaternary and fourth level)  [1]. 
 This paper is organised as follows. Section II presents 
the healthcare challenges in KSA. Section III discusses the 
use of telemedicine in KSA. In section IV, a proposed 
holistic framework for telemedicine in KSA is outlined. 
Section V concludes the paper and outlines future work. 
II. 
HEALTHCARE CHALLENGES IN KSA 
Like many countries, the Saudi healthcare system faces 
many challenges. The first set of challenges is caused by its 
geography. KSA is one of the developing countries where 
some of the people are living in rural and remote areas with a 
huge disparity in HCFs distribution. KSA is vast country, 
with an area of 2.2 million km², 150 cities, and more than 
2,000 Villages [2]. In 2013, the total population was roughly 
30 million, the population growth rate was over 3%, and 
nearly 18% of residents live in rural and remote areas [5][6]. 
The impact of geography on healthcare system has been 
proven [7].  
The second set of challenges is caused by its lack of 
medical expertise and shortage of medical and qualified 
HHR [8]. Saudi’s healthcare services are provided largely by 
expatriates and the high adoption of expatriates in HHR in 
KSA can be deduced from the statistics that are issued by 
MOH.  The latest statistics indicate that 76% of physicians 
and 44.7% of nurses who are working in KSA are non-
Saudis [2]. Furthermore, in KSA, the numbers of physician 
consultants are mostly less than the number of hospitals and 
in the worst case, the consultant physicians are permanently 
unavailable in all hospitals in some provinces. Besides, 55% 
of the total private hospitals and 83% of the total private 
clinics of the private HCFs sectors are concentrated in two 
provinces of KSA, Riyadh and Makkah, representing 49% of 
KSA population [2]. 
The third set of challenges is related to the increase in the 
population and the elderly, in particular, leading to the 
growing demand for healthcare services [9][10]. The

expectancy, in medium variant, of the population growth of 
KSA is expected to reach approximately 40.4 million in 
2050 and that is 35.1%  increase compared to 2012; the 
number of people over 65 years old is predicted to represent 
18.4% of the population in Saudi Arabia by 2050 [11]. In 
addition, cultural and traditional factors, such as dealing with 
the opposite sex and the driving ban for women, increase the 
burden of HHR shortage challenges and could be a huge 
obstacle [12].  
The fourth set of challenges is related to equity of access 
to resources as most of the resources are concentrated in the 
main cities, with varying disparities [12]. A concentration of 
physicians in capital cities is a common feature in many 
countries [7]. Consequently, the density of physicians is 
commonly greater in urban regions which reflect the 
concentration of specialised services [7]. In 2012, 50% of the 
world’s population lived in rural and remote areas served by 
only 25% of the world’s physicians and less than 33% of the 
world’s nurses [13]. In KSA, in 2013 alone, around 90,000 
patients were referred from varies hospitals to other hospitals 
inside KSA for treatment [14]. Correspondingly, MOH has 
an ‘Outreach’ programme that enables specialists to conduct 
visits to rural/remote hospitals [3]. 
To address these challenges, MOH in KSA has begun 
investigating telemedicine as a potential solution and 
learning from other countries and consulting organisations 
such as the World Health Organization (WHO).  
III. 
TELEMEDICINE IN SAUDI ARABIA 
The quality and accessibility of healthcare have been 
successfully improved by telemedicine applications [15][16]. 
Telemedicine would serve to replace some of the in-person 
visits through video conferencing and provide healthcare 
services to patients regardless of their geographic location. In 
other words, while the traditional medical care relies on face-
to-face communication between a patient and a physician, in 
telemedicine concept a patient is treated by a physician who 
is a distance away by utilising ICTs [17]. Therefore, 
telemedicine is particularly beneficial for groups that 
traditionally suffer from lack of access to healthcare since 
patients can be consulted and treated miles away by 
specialists [15][18]. 
In the 1990s the innovation of new technologies, the 
rapid growth of computer and information technology as 
well as the rapid declines in the cost of ICTs has created new 
possibilities and opportunities for healthcare services and 
delivery [19][20]. They have enabled HCFs to visualise and 
consider the implementation of new methods and more 
effective and efficient ways of providing healthcare [21]. 
The developments in telemedicine applications as well as 
new projects for implementation including the Saudi 
Telemedicine Network (STN) and a proposed holistic 
framework for KSA will be presented in this section. 
A. Development of Telemedicine in KSA 
Many telemedicine projects are being implemented by 
individual HCFs in KSA. In 1994, the first telemedicine 
application had been successfully applied in King Faisal 
Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC) [22]. In 
1998, KFSHRC established its telemedicine network to 
connect several hospitals in different provinces in KSA to 
assess patients’ medical status prior to transferring them to 
KFSHRC thus minimising the needs for moving patients. In 
2013, more than 27 hospital sites were connected and each 
site was considered as ‘a health partner’ as well as ‘a triage 
point’ by taking advantage of available equipment and HHR 
management via the KFSHRC telemedicine network [17]. 
B. Saudi Telemedicine Network (STN) 
In 2010, the MOH planned to implement telemedicine, as 
one of its key National e-Health Strategy projects, to cover 
all HCFs and to provide services to all patients in KSA [23]. 
For the first step of the implementation to be successful, 
MOH cooperated with Infoway Canada, a pioneer in the 
telemedicine field, to provide guidance to MOH in the 
development of a telemedicine roadmap for KSA. The 
Infoway report indicated that telemedicine would have a 
significant positive impact on healthcare in KSA and would 
alleviate many of the issues currently facing the KSA 
healthcare challenges [17]. It has confirmed that KSA has a 
degree of readiness for telemedicine as successful projects 
already exist and the necessary technical infrastructure 
expertise for telemedicine is either existing or under 
development [17]. 
However, the report has also identified many barriers and 
challenges likely to face the implementation of telemedicine 
in KSA given the healthcare complex structure system as the 
HCFs are divided into three sectors and supervised by 
different regional zones and directorates [17]. In addition, the 
majority of them are autonomous and each HCF has different 
business strategies and funding incentives [17]. Other 
barriers, identified by WHO are equally relevant to KSA, 
namely issues of cost, legal, culture, infrastructure, police, 
priorities, standards, knowledge, and expertise [24]. El-
Mahalli et al. [25] carried out a case study to investigate the 
successes and challenges in the implementation of 
telemedicine in the eastern province of KSA. Their study 
concluded that, although the MOH in KSA has allocated a 
huge budget for eHealth, the telemedicine modalities used 
were very limited [25]. The top barriers as perceived by 
HCFs in KSA were lack of infrastructure and knowledge 
about the services and benefits of telemedicine, difficulty in 
the application of telemedicine, and HHR’s resistance [25].  
To address these barriers and ensure a successful 
implementation for STN, the report proposed to divide these 
barriers into two levels: a national level and an 
organisational (HCFs) level [17].  
To resolve the national level challenges, the report 
advocated the establishment of a fully funded STN agency as 
an enabler and a provider of telemedicine services in KSA to 
oversee governance, infrastructure and common services 
used by participating organisations (HCFs) [17]. Other duties 
to be included are the setting of national telemedicine 
policies and STN connection standards for all end-point 
equipment, software, and processes to ensure security, 
interoperability and compatibility for all features and 
capabilities across the network [17].

C. The Proposed Holistic Framework for Telemedicine for 
KSA 
The aim of this research is to develop a framework to 
support the adoption and development of telemedicine based 
on the findings of the Infoway report. This framework is 
designed to assist decision makers (stakeholders) of HCFs in 
KSA to evaluate the viability and effectiveness of 
telemedicine applications. This research is collaborating with 
two organisations: PMMC as one of the HCFs in KSA [26] 
and the National eHealth Strategy and Change Management 
Office in MOH in KSA who is the sponsor and owner of 
STN project [27]. 
We have also collaborated with PMMC as this is one of 
five newest medical cities in KSA, and provides healthcare 
services to residents in remote areas and different [28].  
Based on the findings of the Infoway report it became 
apparent that any proposed framework must take a holistic 
approach to address the many barriers and challenges at 
national and organisational levels. The proposed holistic 
framework is also designed to provide guidance to HCF’s 
decision makers to identify critical barriers and challenges of 
their HCF based on STN standards and produce tangible and 
measurable criteria to support the adoption of telemedicine 
applications. 
To develop this framework, three initiatives have been 
undertaken. The first initiative focused on identifying the 
fundamental pillars (barriers) and their concepts (sub-factors) 
specific 
to 
ensure 
a 
successful 
implementation 
of 
telemedicine applications. The concepts (sub-factors) of each 
fundamental pillar are specific to each HCF’s requirements 
and challenges; they are used to generate critical success 
factors (CSF) for that fundamental pillar. The CSF is defined 
as an element of characteristics, conditions or variables that 
is necessary for an organisation or project to achieve its 
mission; it has a direct impact on viability, efficiency and 
effectiveness of a project, program or an organisation [29].   
To identify the fundamental pillars (barriers) and their 
concepts (sub-factors) a survey has been carried out and 
individual-depth interviews (IDI) have been undertaken with 
experts and stakeholders in eight different HCFs in KSA, 
located in both rural and remote areas [26][27].  These 
interviews and survey have led to the identification of five 
fundamental pillars for the proposed framework, namely 
Human, Organisational, Technological, Environmental, and 
Business-Financial pillars, as shown in Figure 1. 
Since the majority of HCFs in KSA are autonomous and 
have different business strategies and funding incentives, the 
concepts of each pillar in the proposed framework is to be 
adapted to address the challenges and needs of HCFs at 
national and organisation levels. Although the literature 
review offers a wide range of CSFs for telemedicine 
implementation in different countries or organisations, CSFs 
are unique to the environment and the organisation context 
and may not be easily shared by all countries or 
organisations [30]. Many of the old barriers and challenges 
that limited telemedicine applications in the past may no 
longer exist or their influences may have partly diminished; 
furthermore, some barriers may now be an opportunity [31]. 
The second initiative was to identify appropriate theories 
to support the fundamental pillars (barriers) and understand 
their interactions. Mitchell and Jolley [32] claimed that 
theories tend to be more internally consistent with existing 
facts than common sense, so theories do not ignore facts. 
Furthermore, theories link individual facts, give them 
meaning, and try to explain and measure them.  
Technological, Organisational, and Business-Financial 
are three of the five pillars of the proposed framework. These 
three pillars are complementary so require a carefully 
balanced understanding of the pillars and concepts associated 
with each HCF. The framework is based on the Information 
Figure 1: Identifying the Fundamental Pillars and their Concepts for the Proposed Framework

Systems Strategy Triangle (ISST)  of Pearlson and Saunders 
[33] which argue that business strategy (Business-Financial 
pillar) 
drives 
both 
the 
organisational 
strategy 
(Organisational pillar) and the information system (IS) 
strategy (Technological pillar) and therefore organisations 
must carefully balance these three strategies [34][33]. In 
other words, any change in the IS strategy must be 
accompanied by changes in the organisational strategy and 
must accommodate the whole business strategy so the 
balance needed for successful operation is perpetuated and 
success can only be achieved by balancing these three 
components of the strategy triangle [33]. In our framework, 
the Business-Financial pillar is a fundamental barrier for 
each HCF which has specific funding incentives and seeks 
distinct return on investment and impact on costs. 
The Environmental pillar, which is not included in the 
ISST framework, is another important pillar in our 
framework since the adoption of technology in HCFs has to 
conform to the various demographic needs of their residents 
and 
their 
geographic 
locations. 
The 
Technology-
organisation-environment (TOE) is a theoretical framework, 
developed by Thornatzky and Fleischer in 1990, to identify 
the features of technology (Technological pillar), the 
readiness of the organisation (Organisational pillar), and the 
environmental conditions (Environmental pillar) as key 
drivers of technology adoption [35].  
The Human pillar, which refers to the HHR in the HCFs 
and their citizens/patients, is the fifth fundamental pillar  
which focuses on human’s specific problems related to 
acceptance and use of technology as well as individual 
attitudes and behaviours of groups [36]. Tough telemedicine 
is not aimed at replacing face-to-face healthcare with 
technology; it affects the nature of healthcare and needs 
additional provision to address the new challenges by HHR 
to ensure that they are able to use their skills, judgement and 
knowledge within this new context [37]. Brewster et al. [37] 
clarified that HHR is the key to the successful delivery and 
implementation of telehealth or any health information 
technology (HIT) in HCFs. HHR acceptance is critical to 
service innovation in healthcare, and is currently an ignored 
area of research [37]. The decision of whether or not to adopt 
a telemedicine solution, by an organisation, involve many 
stakeholders or adopter groups which the majority of them 
are HHR [38]. HHR are commonly considered the end users 
of telemedicine and can comprehensively influence the 
outcome of telemedicine adoption [38]. For these reasons, 
the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 
(UTAUT2) are relevant theories to support the human pillar 
in our framework. UTAUT2 theory is an extension of the 
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 
(UTAUT) which was developed through the review, 
mapping and integration of eight dominant theories and 
models in order to provide a unified theoretical basis to 
facilitate research on information system and information 
technology adoption and diffusion [39]. UTAUT was 
developed by Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, and Davis [40] in 
the field of information systems, and it has been employed 
by many studies in the field of telemedicine such as [41], 
[42], and [43]. Figure 2 shows the theories have contributed 
to formulate our framework. 
Finally, the third initiative is to identify a suitable 
technique to classify each fundamental pillar and its concepts 
for each HCF telemedicine application to produce tangible 
and measurable results to support the adoption activities and 
to assist HCFs’ decision-makers. This initiative is to be 
developed after the first two initiatives are tested and

evaluated. We expect that some of the concepts of each 
fundamental pillar may be extended or enhanced to cover all 
HCF barriers that may affect the fundamental pillars of our 
framework which in turn may affect HCF decisions in 
adopting telemedicine solution. 
IV. 
 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
To summarise, there are a number of challenges currently 
facing the healthcare system in KSA; these could be 
alleviated or reduced by adopting telemedicine solutions. 
This paper has outlined these challenges and proposed a 
holistic framework to assist decision makers in HCFs to 
assess the adoption of telemedicine applications. This 
framework is based on the findings of the Infoway report, the 
extensive 
survey 
and 
interviews 
carried 
out 
with 
stakeholders in eight different HCFs in KSA.   
Our future work is to evaluate our proposed framework. 
We propose to use questionnaires and focus groups to collect 
and substantiate the necessary data amongst Saudi healthcare 
stakeholders to address any new emerging challenges. This 
will assist us in determining practical and measurable results 
to support the adoption activities at national and 
organisational levels. In the longer term, the intention is to 
extend the framework to be suitable not only for 
telemedicine applications but also for all technological 
innovations in healthcare in KSA.
