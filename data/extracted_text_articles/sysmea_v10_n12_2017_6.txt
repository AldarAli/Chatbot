Abstract—Traditionally sensitive silicate membranes for pH 
electrodes are fabricated by glassblowers. Recently, because of 
a more effective fabrication in certain cases, also so-called 
blowing 
machines 
are 
in 
use. 
In 
this 
way 
neither 
miniaturization nor a planar arrangement of the sensors can 
be realized. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) could provide ideal 
conditions to reduce the above-mentioned drawbacks. In this 
contribution, the first results of using this technology for the 
fabrication of planar glass based electrochemical pH sensors 
are demonstrated, whereby the characterization of the 
amorphous silicate glass before and after the PLD process is in 
the focus of this article.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Sensitive 
membranes 
are 
essential 
functional 
components of potentiometric chemo sensors. In this 
respect, according to Figure 1, a distinction is made between 
solid-based and liquid membranes. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Classification of membrane materials for electrochemical sensors 
 
Amorphous glass materials, which can be realized in 
different ways [1, 2], play a significant role for the 
fabrication of solid membranes. The reason is that especially 
the pH determination, which is one of the analyses 
performed most frequently worldwide, is carried out with 
electrochemical electrodes based on such membranes 
according to standards [3]. The membrane materials used 
here are silicate glasses with high ionic conductivity, which 
are mainly achieved by using alkaline as well as alkaline 
earth metal oxides, changing the silicate glass network [4] 
like it is shown in Figure 2.

changing components

component,   +   cation 
 
Silica based electrode glasses, as a rule, are generated by 
melting their basic materials in covered platinum crucibles 
for several hours at temperatures > 1300 °C. For the further 
processing by the glassblower it is useful to outpour the 
liquid glass material, e.g., in a graphite flume. In this way, 
rods of the special glass are obtained. From these, 
glassblowers for the most parts produce basket or dome-
shaped conventional pH electrodes in quantities of several 
million pieces per year. They contain a buffer solution and 
an electrochemical reference system (as a rule an electrode 
of 2nd kind) in its interiors. Modifying the glass composition 
makes it possible to realize similarly constructed silicate 
glass based electrodes with sensitivities for a number of 
other cations, mainly of metals of the first group of the 
periodic table [5]. 
Beside 
the 
above 
mentioned 
sensors, 
whose 
functionality is based on ionic conductivity, there are also 
probes with electron conducting amorphous glass membrane 
materials. These include redox glass [6] and chalcogenide 
glass electrodes [7]. For both types of electrodes the 
selection of an optimal internal reference system is 
relatively simple. As a result of the predominant electron 
conductivity of the sensitive membrane materials a direct 
contact of the special glasses with a (noble) metal is 
appropriate.

Therefore, liquid system components are not applicable 
for chemo sensors based on such materials. From 
constructional point of view, on the one hand, it is possible 
to fabricate compact electrodes by sticking a wire directly 
on the surface of the functional amorphous body, e.g., using 
a conductive varnish (see Figure 3); on the other hand, it is 
also possible to form a thin metal coating directly on the 
electron conducting glass by electro-plating (see Figure 4).

Also, for silicate glass based cation selective electrodes 
it is an interesting task to replace the common liquid system 
components by solids due to the purpose of their 
application. The functionality causing ionic conductivity of 
siliceous pH- but also pLi-, pNa or pK-glasses [10] requires 
an interlayer with mixed electrical properties on the reverse 
side of the sensitive membrane. A transition from an ionic 
conducting material to an electronic conductor (e.g., metal) 
may lead to a so-called blocked interface and consequently 
to an unfavorable measurement behavior [11]. 
In the past, several suggestions were made to realize 
such interlayers. In the context of the investigations 
presented here, the possibility to form thin layers of zinc 
oxide or titanium oxide between sensitive glass and a noble 
metal should be mentioned [12]. Previous work on all solid 
state glass electrodes was concerned with sensors fabricated 
with precision manufacturing techniques and screen printing 
(see Figure 5). Here, a clear stabilization of the half-cell 
potentials over the time could be obtained compared to a 
direct metal contacting [13, 14, 15]. 
PLD as a preparation method for sensors used in 
electrolyte containing liquids has still not become 
widespread. Today the PLD technology is particularly used 
for the deposition of diamond-like carbon layers (DSL) in 
order to improve the surface properties of highly stressed 
tools and components [16]. For the application in 
optoelectronics and chemical sensors, chalcogenide films 
were prepared by pulse laser deposition [17, 18, 19]. In the 
following it is reported on investigations using PLD as 
fabrication technology to realize planar all solid state pH 
glass electrodes according to a layer design described above. 
Beside the realization of an adherent metallic basic 
electrode on a substrate, special attention will be focused on 
the stoichiometric deposition of the functional sensor 
material from a prefabricated glass target by laser ablation. 
There should be no material loss during the PLD process as 
described in literature, e.g., for the synthesis of bio glass 
thin films [20].

In Section II, the fabrication of the glass targets, the 
PLD process for the glass layer deposition and the 
characterization of these layers are described. Results of 
scanning electron microscope investigations, micro-X-ray 
fluorescence analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 
electrochemical measurements are presented in Section III.

EXPERIMENTAL 
 
A. Fabrication of the glass targets 
 
 
The targets of the sensitive pH glasses for the PLD 
process are obtained by pouring the molten glass in a 
preheated graphite mold according to Figure 6a. This 
manufacturing method delivers homogeneous and also 
amorphous target materials with defined geometries. 
According to Figure 6b, the glass cylinders were fabricated 
and singularized in discs with a thickness of 5 mm by means 
of a precision saw (Accutom-50, Fa. Struers GmbH, 
Willich, Germany). To improve the mechanical stability the

glass rods were embedded in an epoxy resin and fixed on 
the target holder for the PLD process (Figure 6c).

B. PLD process 
 
The preparation of the thin sensory functional layers was 
carried out by sputtering methods and PLD. For this 
purpose, a combined coating system CREAMET 500 PLD 
S2 (Creavac Vacuum Coating Technology GmbH, Dresden, 
Germany) was used, which provides both deposition 
processes (see Figures 7 and 8). Furthermore, a 
simultaneous substrate and mask handling is possible 
without an interruption of the vacuum during the coating 
process.

Figure 7.  Combined coating system with 
PLD (1) and sputter (2) chamber 
 
With integrated substrate handler and mask change 
system, two sputter targets, six PLD targets and altogether 
five changeable masks can be used and combined for the 
process.  
As substrates pre-cleaned glass plates consisting of soda-
lime glass with a size of 50 mm x 15 mm and a thickness of 
1 mm were used. They were pretreated with the initial 
plasma process at a chamber pressure of 3.0x10-2 mbar 
under an argon atmosphere. As chamber pressure for the 
following sputtering processes of the adhesive layer (Ti) and 
the electrical conducting noble metal electrode (Au or Pt) a 
value of 7.0 x 10-3 mbar was used.

After finishing the sputtering processes the coated 
substrates were removed and the masks were changed in a 
so-called „Load-Lock-Box“. Prepared in this way, the 
substrates were transferred into the PLD coating chamber 
using a carrier and the PLD process was started.

The deposition of the thin pH glass films was conducted 
by a KrF excimer laser source (ComPexPro 110, Coherent 
LaserSystems GmbH & Co. KG., Göttingen, Germany) 
using a wave length of 248 nm, a fluence of 5.6 J/cm2 at 
pulse lengths of 20 ns and a pulse frequency of 10 Hz. The 
determination of the laser power before and after the coating 
process in connection with a periodical cleaning of the entry 
window ensured long-term stable and reproducible basic 
conditions. The PLD process was carried out at a chamber 
pressure of 3.1x10-7 mbar in a N2 atmosphere. The substrate 
was kept at room temperature. As ablation time of the 
sensitive layers a period from 10 to 30 minutes was selected. 
The substrates were positioned perpendicular to the plasma 
(On-Axis-PLD) (Figure 9).

C. Characterization 
 
Physical Characterization 
 
The energy dispersive micro-X-ray fluorescence analysis 
(µ-RFA) system M4 Tornado (Bruker Nano GmbH, Berlin, 
Germany) was used for the position-sensitive chemical 
elemental analysis. It allows the analysis of large and 
inhomogeneous samples as well as smallest particles fast 
and at low vacuum under environmental conditions.  
In order to obtain information on the morphology, the 
surfaces of the prepared pH glass thin films were examined 
using the scanning electron microscope Helios 660 (FEI, 
Eindhoven, Netherlands).  
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) data were 
acquired with the system SAGE HR 100 Compact High 
Resolution (company SPECS Surface Nano Analyses 
GmbH, Berlin, Germany) using non-monochromatised 
MgKα radiation (hѵ=1253.6 eV) with 12.5 kV and 250 W 
beam settings at a pressure of 2x10-8 hPa in the analysis 
chamber. With XPS it is possible to determine the chemical 
composition of the uppermost atomic layer of a material 
surface, because low beam energy (12.5 kV) is applied. 
Other radiographically methods (e.g., like µ-RFA) require 
beam energies up to 50 kV; elements from the volume will 
also be detected. 
In addition to the described usage of µ-RFA and XPS, 
which allow statements about bulk properties of the target 
materials and adsorptive contaminations as well as surface 
effects, it is also possible to use energy dispersive X-ray 
analysis (EDX) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) as further 
radiographically research methods. Their application by 
means of the systems QUANTAX 400 D on FEI Helios 660 
with two XFlash® 6 detectors (Bruker Nano GmbH, Berlin, 
Germany) (EDX) and D8 Discover High-Resolution 
Diffractometer (Bruker AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) 
(XRD) show that amorphous sensor glass membranes can 
be realized using PLD as thin film production method. 
 
Electrochemical Characterization 
 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an 
approved method for the characterization of resistance 
changes of systems with ion-sensitive glass membranes 
even for high-impedance and easily polarizable systems, 
which are present in pH glass electrodes.  
In [21], EIS investigations on glass-metal transitions 
were carried out. Vonau et al. [22] used this method in 
combination with concentration analysis studies to describe 
the change in the pH properties of traditionally produced pH 
glass electrodes as a function of the duration of the 
application and the temperature and to elucidate their 
causes. Impedance spectroscopic methods were used to 
demonstrate the successful deposition of a glass layer by 
means of PLD technology on a sensor structure.  
On the basis of the determined impedance values 
(frequency-dependent alternating-current resistors), the 
electrical conductivities of the PLD thin films could be 
estimated.  
The impedance spectra were recorded using a 
measurement system Gamry Interface 1000 (Gamry 
Instruments Inc., Warminster, USA) in different buffer 
solutions according to the suggestions of the National 
Bureau of Standards (NBS) and of Thiel, Schulz and Coch 
(TSC). Potentiometric measurements were carried out using 
the PC Laboratory Multi-Parameter System LM 2000 
(Sensortechnik Meinsberg GmbH, Waldheim, Germany) to 
evaluate the electrochemical behavior depending on the pH 
value.

RESULTS 
 
A. Micro-X-ray fluorescence analysis (µ-RFA) 
 
The results of µ-RFA demonstrate that the pH glass 
targets used for PLD possess a good homogeneity (see

Element mappings exhibit a uniform distribution of the 
elements over the entire analyzed surface; no pronounced 
defects or areas with an accumulation of an element were 
detected. This ensures - compared to conventional glass 
electrodes made by a glassblower - identical conditions of 
the sensor membrane concerning the interface between 
measuring solution and electrode surface. 
Subject of the investigations was the layering structure 
of the new pH thin film sensor according to Figure 11, 
consisting of a substrate (laboratory glass or alumina) with a 
sputtered gold basic electrode and a sensitive pH glass layer 
deposited by PLD. Finally, an isolation epoxy layer was 
applied. 
 
 
                        Figure 11: pH thin film electrode 
 
Consequently, the possible presence of gold on the 
sensor surface will be an indicator for a defect in the PLD 
based pH glass thin film.

Overview spectra and spectra of the single elements in 
regions of their highest sensitivity were recorded.  
In an exemplary manner, Figure 14 demonstrates a 
comparative presentation of the overview spectrum from a 
glass target and of a glass thin film deposited from this 
source by PLD. These spectra showed no differences in the 
chemical composition. In addition, a determination of the 
gold content on the surface of the pH thin film sensors was 
carried out (see Figure 15). There are no peaks at the typical 
positions for binding energies of gold to be found in the 
spectra that would indicate a presence of gold on the 
surface. This suggests that there are no holes in the thin pH 
sensitive glass and that this layer is tight.

D. XRD 
 
 
The recording of diffractograms by means of two-
dimensional X-Ray diffraction (XRD)2 is an appropriate 
tool for the characterization of glass based thin films. Using 
a High-Resolution Diffractometer with a general area 
detection diffraction system (GADDS), the detection limit 
of crystalline amounts can be reduced into a sub-percentage 
range. The X-Ray diffraction patterns of the PLD films in 
Figure 16 show significant first sharp diffraction peak, even 
in sub-µm thicknesses.

EIS measurements 
 
 
For EIS 
measurements in 
NBS-buffer 
pH=6.86 
(Figure 17) a three electrode arrangement was used, 
consisting of a working electrode (a traditional glass 
electrode, a PLD glass membrane electrode with the same 
glass composition or a gold basic electrode), a KCl-
saturated silver chloride reference electrode and a platinum 
sheet as counter electrode.  
 
The resulting Bode-Plots in the diagrams look quite 
different. As expected, the impedance of the traditional 
glass electrode (Figure 17a) is significantly higher than that 
of the gold electrode (Figure 17b) due to the high glass 
resistance. 
 
The impedance of the PLD glass membrane is lower 
than that of the conventional glass electrode – because of 
the lower thickness – but even higher than that of the gold 
electrode. This gives an indication, that the PLD glass 
membrane was deposited tightly and without holes. 
Nevertheless, the phase characteristic in Figure 15c is not 
fully understood yet. 
 
pH measurement 
 
Previous studies, as already mentioned above, were 
mainly carried out to adapt PLD technology for coating 
planar metallized glass substrates with ion conducting 
selective glass films. Only a few electrodes were tested for 
pH-measurements until now.  
 
Figure 18 shows the pH dependence of one of the first 
PLD electrodes in TSC buffer solutions, measured at 25 °C 
versus an Ag/AgCl//KClsat.-electrode as a reference 
electrode.

Actually, the PLD glass electrodes do not demonstrate 
the electrochemical sensitivity of the conventional glass 
electrodes filled with electrolytic solutions. Here, it could 
already be shown that PLD based pH glass layers in direct 
metal contact deliver sensor sensitivities of approximately -
32 mV/pH to 40 mV/pH at 25 °C. 
Currently, it is not ensured that a stoichiometric 
deposition of the functional pH glass takes place in the PLD 
process. Results of element determination in the deposited 
thin films by inductively coupled plasma optical emission 
spectrometry (ICP-OES) and flame photometry suggest that 
there are losses especially in the case of the alkaline content. 
If this will be confirmed by further investigations, an 
adjustment of the glass compositions is absolutely 
necessary, because changes in the glass composition cause a 
reduction of pH sensitivity. 
Drift behavior and long-term stability have to be 
optimized for the reasons outlined above by forthcoming 
integration of interlayers. In case of a positive outcome of 
the development with respect to resolution, repeatability and 
accuracy, a realization of  miniaturized planar all solid state 
glass electrodes with properties comparable to at the 
moment widely used sensor types can be expected. 
Electrodes with layers prepared by PLD technology should 
deliver measurement signals with a higher repeatability. 
This is due to the fact that this manufacturing process 
provides a better reproducibility of the thicknesses of the 
deposits. 
For the fabrication of corresponding pH glass electrodes 
with constant stable electrode potentials and electrode 
functions following the Nernst equation the realization of an 
additional semi- or mixed conducting interlayer (for 
example zinc oxide [13]) by the same technology is 
necessary [24]. This will be the subject of future projects.  
 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK 
 
In the present contribution, PLD technology is 
introduced as a new method for the deposition of sensitive 
glass membranes with high variability in the choice of the 
glass 
composition. 
Analyzing 
results 
and 
first 
electrochemical applications of the glass thin film electrodes 
are described.  
Homogeneity and leak-tightness of thin glass films 
fabricated in such way could be demonstrated by µ-RFA 
and XPS analyses. Due to the low thickness of the glass 
membrane planar PLD based pH sensors possess clearly 
smaller electrode resistances compared to those obtained by 
glass blowing and screen printing. This fact, as well as the 
possibility to deposit the sensitive membranes on different 
sensor substrate materials (glass, ceramics) offer a variety of 
applications, e.g., in the area of cell research. Here and in a 
lot of biomedical and biotechnological applications, the 
transparency of glass is an important progress. 
It should be also mentioned that the previously 
established thin film method for the fabrication of chemo 
sensors (CHEMFETs) is mainly based on CMOS 
technology. This requires high investment and running costs 
and can be introduced economically only if products with 
62

identical composition and design are needed in large 
quantities. The described sensor fabrication by means of 
PLD allows, amongst others, to abstain completely from 
using 
photolithographic 
processes 
and 
additional 
encapsulation steps with simultaneous cost-efficiency also 
for small and medium quantities. The sensors described in 
this contribution work according to the potentiometric 
principle contrary to CHEMFETs. Thus, future appliers can 
still use their measurement devices for conventional sensors. 
Furthermore, in the future it should be possible to 
fabricate glass based multi sensors by means of the 
described method. This could be the case for planar probes 
to determine other monovalent cations than H+. For this 
purpose, it will be necessary to place several targets in the 
vacuum chamber and to vary the deposition conditions. 
Under such circumstances, it will be also possible to realize 
potentiometric 
multi 
sensors 
with 
several 
selective 
membranes consisting not only of glasses. Realizable seems 
a combination of electrode glasses with defined metal oxide 
layers with analytical electrode function in solutions, such 
as vanadium oxide [25, 26].
