Abstract—The vast amount of data provided by the Internet
of Things and sensors, have given rise to edge computing and
analytics. In edge computing and analytics, data processing and
analysis on sensor input is performed in edge devices prior to
sending the results to the cloud. This reduces required pro-
cessing in the cloud while minimizing communication network
utilization and allows cloud resources to be used for other
tasks such as decision making. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive, unbiased overview of state-of-the-art research
on edge computing and analytics. Of the 47 identiﬁed papers,
several have targeted task scheduling and power optimisation,
while data management and engineering, image and facial
recognition as well as anomaly detection were not well studied.
Simulation remains the most used approach for validation, and
research results based on implementations of edge systems in
real life environments are still sparse.
Keywords-edge; analytics; systematic mapping study.
I. INTRODUCTION
An increasing part of new features and added value
for machines and technical solutions comes from digital-
ization and advanced automation. The Internet of Things,
collections of Big Data and cloud-based analytics provide
potential tools to improve machine reliability, performance
and energy efﬁciency. However, required network band-
width, data storage and data processing power (as well
as the resulting energy consumption) are signiﬁcant for
machines equipped with large sensor systems. Due to these
issues, the implementation of analytics systems for condition
monitoring, diagnostics and predictive maintenance would
be largely unfeasible if not for edge computing and analytics
to perform data collection, storage, computation and analysis
closer to original locations. Edge analytics can take place on
a sensor or other device connected directly to a machine,
instead of transmitting the data to the cloud or central
data storage, for example. This approach shortens analytics
response times and reduces the bandwidth needed for data
transmission.
According to analysis by [1], the business drivers sup-
porting edge application use are low latency, cost efﬁciency,
improved operational efﬁciency and lower bandwidth. How-
ever, implementation of edge-based analytics supporting
machine diagnostics remains rare. At the same time, a
market review [2] has forecast that revenue from condition
monitoring applications, which might utilize edge analytics,
will almost triple between 2019 and 2023. As such, edge
computing and analytics hold signiﬁcant interest and poten-
tial for both companies and research institutes.
This paper presents an overview of state-of-the-art tech-
nologies and solutions used for edge computing and ana-
lytics. These paradigms are already applied in many areas,
such as mobile devices [3], home automation [4], smart
cities [5], personal health care [6], automotive and industrial
vehicles [7]. The goal of this study was to reveal existing
frameworks, infrastructures, methods and algorithms for
edge analytics, including their performances and the level
of standardization for edge analytic systems. The study was
performed using systematic mapping study (SMS) protocol
presented in Section II that covered hundreds of scientiﬁc
publications from several digital libraries.
This study was performed in the context of a Finnish na-
tional research project on edge technologies, which has been
carried out in co-operation with several industrial companies.
The motivation of companies to apply edge computing to
their machines relates to condition monitoring and machines
diagnostics. The main application areas for the companies
are energy production, mobile work machines and related
monitoring and AI solutions. Therefore, scientiﬁc papers
focusing on mobile edge computing were not included and
the focus was on industrially applicable solutions.
The contributions of this paper are to provide such an
overview and results from applying SMS methodology to
this research area. Given that none of the 912 papers found
after the initial search provided a similar overview of edge
computing and analytics, we deem the results provided in
this paper to be relevant.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes
the protocol for the systematic mapping study used to ﬁnd
and evaluate papers in this study. The protocol is described
in detail for the purpose of replicability. In Section 3, we
present the results of this study, where we also try to answer
the research questions presented in Section 2. Potential
threats to the validity of this study are discussed in Section
4, and in Section 5, we present our conclusions.

II. THE SYSTEMATIC MAPPING STUDY
This section describes the protocol used for the SMS. The
protocol is largely based on the one used in [8], but it has
been modiﬁed according to the topic of this study.
A. Research Questions
The research questions (RQ) are as follows:
RQ1: Which ﬁelds apply edge computing?
RQ2: What methods or algorithms are used in edge comput-
ing?
RQ3: What edge framework proposals exist?
RQ4: How do proposed edge framework solutions perform?
RQ5: What is the standardization level for edge computing?
RQ6: How are the edge framework proposals evaluated?
B. Search Strategy for Primary Studies
This section presents our search strategy, which based on
the systematic literature review guidelines from [9] and [10].
1) Search Terms: Table I lists the search terms used when
searching for original papers for this study. The search terms
are derived from the research questions.

2) Search Strings: The search terms listed in Table I
were combined into two search strings for use in the digital
libraries. These are shown in Table II.

2.
(Defect OR Malfunction OR Anomal*) AND (Performance*
OR Complexit* OR Energy)
3) Databases: The search strings shown above were
applied to the following digital libraries:
• IEEE Xplore
• ACM Digital library
• ScienceDirect
We decided to start with four libraries, but skipped the
SpringerLink database because it did not have the option of
extracting papers in a bibtex ﬁle format.
The ﬁrst search string was used for all three databases
while the second string was used to search abstracts in
the IEEE Xplore database only. This was done to reduce
the number of papers found, because the ﬁrst search string
resulted in more than 11,000 papers from the abstract search.
Since the digital libraries have different possibilities for
deﬁning search strings, the strings were customized to every
digital library. Duplicates were removed from the collected
results.
C. Study Inclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria for primary studies were as follows:
• Written in English AND
• Published in a peer-reviewed journal, conference or
workshop covering the subjects of computer science,
computer engineering, embedded systems, signal pro-
cessing, or software engineering AND
• Describing any one of the following:
– Methods or approaches for edge computing or
analytics
– Infrastructural or architectural approaches to edge
computing and analytics
– Performance evaluations of existing edge comput-
ing and analytics approaches
If several papers presented the same approach, only the
most recent was included, unless the contributions of those
papers differed.
D. Title and Abstract Level Screening
In this phase, the inclusion criteria were applied to publi-
cation titles and abstracts. To minimize researcher bias, two
researchers independently analysed the search results. After-
wards, the analyses were compared and any disagreements
were resolved through discussion. The screening results
were used as a starting point for the full text screening.
E. Full Text Level Screening
In this phase, the remaining papers were analysed based
on their full text. To minimize bias, three researchers applied
the inclusion criteria on the full text. Here, one researcher
screened all of the papers, while the remaining two re-
searchers screened half of the papers each, due to time
limitations. The results were compared and disagreements
were resolved through discussion. The researchers also doc-
umented a reason for each excluded study [11].
F. Study Quality Assessment Checklist and Procedure
The selected papers were assessed based on their quality
in terms of contribution to edge analytics. Three researchers
assessed the quality of the selected papers with one re-
searcher assessing all of the papers independently, while the

two other researchers assessed half of the papers each. After
the assessing, the results were compared and disagreements
were resolved through discussion between researchers. Any
papers not meeting minimum quality requirements, as de-
tailed below, were excluded from the set of primary studies.
The output from this phase was the ﬁnal set of papers.
Table III presents the checklist for study quality assess-
ment. For each question in the checklist, a three-level,
numeric scale was used [11]. The levels were: yes (2 points),
partial (1 point), and no (0 point). Based on the checklist and
the numeric scale, each study could score a maximum of 34
and a minimum of 0 points. If a study scored 8 points or less,
it was excluded due to a lack of quality with respect to this
study. The reviewing researcher documented the obtained
score of each included/excluded study.

G. Data Extraction Strategy
We used the form shown in Table IV to extract data from
the primary studies. Three researchers extracted the infor-
mation from the papers with each researcher extracting data
from one third of the papers. After the data extraction, the
results were double-checked by the reviewing researchers.
The extracted data was then used for analysis, applying RQs
from Section II-A to obtain answers.
H. Synthesis of the Extracted Data
The extracted data from the papers was analysed to to
obtain a high-level view of the different aspects related to
edge analytics. The papers were categorised and collective
results were extracted. The results from this phase are
presented and discussed in Section III.

III. RESULTS
In this section, we present the main ﬁndings of the
research. We used search terms such as ”edge” and ”algo-
rithm*” that are used in several research contexts. Conse-
quently, some ﬁndings were not related to edge computing.
For example, some papers were related to the analysis of
image edges or parsing methods for graph edges, which are
not related to the topic of this paper.
As seen in Table V, the initial paper search produced an
excessive number of papers. After the initial screening, it
turned out that no papers found and published before 2016
were on the topic industrial edge analytics. Therefore, the
results of this study include papers published from 2016
onwards. We also discarded papers related to mobile edge
computing, as our research relates to the industrial environ-
ment. That being said, papers related to fog computing were
not discarded, because the technologies used are closely
related to edge computing. These are the main reasons to the
large number of papers discarded after the title and abstract
screening.

screening, only 118 papers were included in the following
phase. After the full text screening, 58 papers were included
in the quality assessment.Only a few papers were discarded
based on the quality assessment, leaving 47 primary studies
for the ﬁnal analysis. Overall, a signiﬁcant number of papers
were discarded, as their content (e.g., graphs, decision trees)
did not relate to the industry domain of edge analytics. Most
of the primary studies (38) were published in conference
proceedings and the remainder (9) were published in jour-
nals.
As shown in Figure 1, the subject of edge computing
is trending toward greater interest over time. We note that
while there were few papers used from 2019, the initial paper
search took place on April 10, 2019. As such, this study most
likely does not include all related articles published in 2019.

A. Application Domains of Edge Computing (RQ1)
The idea behind RQ1 was to identify domains in which
edge computing has been studied, and these domains are
illustrated in Figure 2. According to our ﬁndings, smart
cities and homes were application domain of many primary
studies. However, the majority of these studies did not have a
speciﬁc application domain, providing general contributions
that could be applied to several domains.
B. Edge Computing Method or Algorithm (RQ2)
Table VII shows the purpose of algorithms used in the
primary studies. Approximately one third of the primary
studies relied on algorithms used for task scheduling and
operation partitioning, which is expected, since those char-
acteristics are important when implementing edge systems.
The second-most addressed use for algorithms was address-
ing power optimisation, which is also understandable as
task scheduling and operation partitioning are closely related
to power consumption. A substantial number of papers
contained algorithms related to image and video processing
as well as data transmission, reduction, and mining. Only

a few papers used algorithms related to anomaly detection,
audio measurements or time efﬁciency. In general, Table VII
shows that the area of edge computing and analytics is quite
new, and more research effort is needed especially in the less
addressed categories.
C. Edge Computing Framework (RQ3)
Figure 3 shows the number of papers that contributed with
architectures or infrastructures. However, proposals varied
widely and could not be classiﬁed further and the distinction
between the two terms may be considered vague. This
research question was consequently quite difﬁcult to answer.
Nonetheless, in our classiﬁcation, we considered architecture
to be device-internal mostly and infrastructure to be an edge-
device network.

D. Proposals Performance
(RQ4)
The purpose of RQ4 was to evaluate the performances of
the edge systems presented in the primary studies. As can
be seen in Table VIII, 29 primary studies provided energy
efﬁcient solutions, mostly by reducing energy requirements
for performing tasks. Solutions working in real-time i.e.,
providing results with minimal but approximately constant
delay) were provided by 15 of the primary studies. Five pri-
mary studies provided solutions that improved computational
efﬁciency by reducing the time required to complete certain
tasks and reducing overall memory usage. Only two primary
studies addressed data transmission in edge systems. The re-
maining nine primary studies measured various phenomena
that was not easily categorised.
E. Edge Analytics Standardization Level (RQ5)
In this research, we analysed what level of standardization
has been used in edge computing. According to our ﬁndings,
no primary study mentioned relying on any edge computing-
related standard. A few primary studies used standards that
are not strictly edge-related (e.g., Controller Area Network,
IEEE P1363 and NGSI), but standardization is ongoing
for multi-access edge computing within European standards
telecommunications institute [3].
F. Proposal Evaluation Methods (RQ6)
Evaluating proposed approaches is an important part of
the this study, allowing the effectiveness if each contribution
to be acknowledged and compared to other approaches.
We analysed the evaluation methods that were used in the
primary studies by using analytical, simulation and empirical

studies (Figure 4). In the majority of the primary studies,
the evaluation was conducted by performing simulations.
However, empirical studies were also used in many studies.
We point out that in some papers, a combination of these
evaluation methods were used. Among the primary studies
that were evaluated by empirical studies, case studies were
the dominant method chosen. Even though the case studies
relied on real implementations for their evaluations, they
were mostly applied in lab environments, meaning that
the evaluations were controlled by the researchers. Such
environments tend to prevent events that occur in real
environments.
IV. THREATS TO VALIDITY
A threat to validity of this study is that papers related to
mobile edge computing were not included, since this study
focused on edge computing and analytics in non-mobile
environments. Consequently, some relevant papers may have
been missed.
This study also only included papers published from 2016
onward, largely due to the appearance of the term ”edge”
towards the end of 2015. As such, there may be papers
published related to this paper’s topic that were published
earlier and subsequently missed. There may, however, exist
papers published earlier that are related to the topic of this
paper, and if that is the case, those papers have been missed.
Another threat to validity is that the screening phases
were performed partially by different persons. While one
researcher followed the entire protocol from beginning to
end, the remaining researchers had varying inﬂuence on the
screening phases. These researchers may have had different

views regarding paper relevancy, causing relevant papers to
be excluded.
In all phases where three researchers were involved, ex-
cept for the data extraction phase, one researcher completed
the entire phase independently, while the other two divided
the workload evenly between them. Since the workload was
divided, some papers may have been excluded because of
differing criteria for relevance.
In the data extraction phase, each of the researchers
extracted data from one third of the papers. Although each
set of extracted data was double-checked by other researches
in the group, there is a risk that some data may have been
missed.
Finally, we point out that after each phase in the protocol,
consensus discussions were held and any disagreements
were resolved. Therefore, we feel any threats posed to
protocol execution were minimal.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a systematic mapping study on edge
computing and analytics. For the purpose of replicability,
the protocol used in the study was also presented. Since the
term ”edge” is rather new, the papers we identiﬁed were all
published in 2016 or later.
In our ﬁndings, several papers targeting task scheduling
and power optimisation while few addressed other targets
(such as image and face recognition, anomaly detection,
data management and data engineering) to indicate a clear
information gap for those ﬁelds. Many papers relied on sim-
ulating their proposals and few offered real implementations
of edge technologies. Many situations, however, are difﬁcult
to simulate, because of events that are either unknown, rare
or hard to predict.
Almost half of the papers did not specify their application
domain, indicating that clear implementation strategies for
some proposals did not exist. Among the application do-
mains speciﬁed, smart cities and homes were the dominating
application hldomains, followed by professional vehicles,
the health domain, and various other domains.
