Abstract—Proxy signature schemes allow the original signer of
a message to delegate his signing capability to a proxy signer
to generate a valid proxy signature on behalf of the original
signer. One such scheme is proposed by Zhang and Kim which
is based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Identity based
Signature. However, Zhang’s scheme requires secure channel
for transmission of private key, has no provision of private key
revocation and signature veriﬁcation by any user. In this paper,
we propose an improved ID based proxy signature scheme
based on bilinear pairing. The scheme employs Knapsack
algorithm for key distribution which eliminates the need for
secure channel for sending the private keys from Private key
generator (PKG) to respective users. The scheme also supports
private key revocation by concatenating time parameter with
public key of proxy signers. The signature can be veriﬁed only
by a designated veriﬁer. It is shown that the proposed proxy
signature scheme satisﬁes all security requirements. Finally,
the proposed proxy signature scheme is compared with that of
Zhang and Kim’s scheme and is shown to have merits over the
latter one. Therefore, the proposed scheme can be a potential
candidate for implementation of future proxy signature schemes.

INTRODUCTION
Digital Signatures are used in a wide variety of modern
cryptographic systems that support data integrity and authen-
tication. In public key cryptography, prior to any communica-
tion, each user should obtain a certiﬁcate from the Certiﬁcate
Authority validating their public-private key pair.
Proxy
signatures schemes are one of the variety of digital signatures.
Proxy signature schemes are required when the original signer
is not available for some duration due to some reasons. Proxy
signature scheme can be of two types depending on the signing
authority. In full delegation scheme, signing rights are given
permanently to the proxy signer. In partial delegation, signing
right is delegated for a ﬁxed period of time. The period of
delegation and the type of messages that can be signed is
usually speciﬁed by message warrant issued by the original
signer at the time of delegation of signing authority.
In public key cryptography, the users must obtain their
public-private key pair from the Certiﬁcate Authority prior to
message communication [1]. In case of ID based cryptography,
a trusted third party called as Private Key Generator (PKG)
generates public-private key pair for the signers and transmits
it to them via secure channel [2] [3]. In the recent proposals
of proxy signatures, the public key of the signers is based on
their popular public IDs (such as email id, telephone number
etc).
Mambo [4] has described a proxy signature scheme based
on Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP). Recently, an improved
proxy signature scheme based on RSA algorithm was proposed
by Akanksha et. al [5] in Secureware 2015. The ﬁrst ID
based proxy signature scheme was proposed by Zhang and
Kim, which requires a secure channel for transmission of
private keys to the respective signers. Zhang and Kim [6] have
described an identity based proxy signature scheme based on
Elliptic Curve Cryptography. SK Haﬁzul [7] has described a
designated veriﬁer proxy signature scheme. This scheme [6]
requires a secure channel for transmission of private key from
PKG to user. It has no provision for private key revocation
and the signature can be veriﬁed by any unknown veriﬁer.
The proposed proxy signature scheme attempts to overcome
the drawbacks of this particular scheme.
In this paper, we have proposed an ID based proxy sig-
nature scheme that eliminates the requirement of a secure
channel for transmission of secret key from PKG to signer.
It also allows for changing the private key from time to time
or when it is compromised to avoid its misuse for a long time.
The proposed signature scheme has a designated veriﬁer for
veriﬁcation of the signature created by the signer.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
2 decribes the Zhang and Kim’s scheme. In Section 3, an
improved ID based proxy signature scheme is proposed with
its security analysis presented in Section 4. Finally, the paper
is concluded in Section 5.

secure channel.
Note that IDA and IDB i.e. IDs of original and

Since H2 is public function, anyone can calculate QA
and QB
3)
Proxy Key Generation
To delegate his signing capability to a proxy signer,
the original signer A makes signed warrant mw that
consists of public IDs of A and B, type of messages
that can be signed by proxy signer (B) and validity
period of proxy signer’s signatures.
To delegate the signing capacity to the proxy signer,
the original signer (Alice) makes the signed warrant
mw consisting of public IDs of original and proxy
signer, type of messages that can be signed and valid
time period for proxy signature. The proxy key SBm
is generated by Bob as follows:
a.
A randomly selects k ∈R Z∗
p and computes
rA = e (P, P)k
cA = H1 (mw ∥ rA)
UA = cASA + kP
b.
A then sends (mw, cA, UA) to B on secure
channel.
Note that SA and P lie on elliptic curve on
Zp and cA and kA are scalar quantities.
and rA is not sent explicitly from A to B
c.
On receiving the above information from A,
proxy signer B computes the following:
rA = e (UA, P) e (QAPpub)−cA
and accepts the signature to be valid if and
only if
cA = H1 (mw ∥ rA)
This validates that B has received informa-
tion from A only(authentication).
d.
If the signature on message warrant is valid,
B computes his private proxy key as follows:
SBm = cASB+UA where SBm is a modiﬁed
proxy key created by proxy signer using the
original proxy key sent by PKG to user.
4)
Proxy Signature Generation
The message m is signed by proxy signer B using his
proxy key SBm as follows:
a.
Proxy signer B selects a random number
kBϵZp∗
b.
B computes rB = e (P, P)kB
c.
B computes the proxy signature on message
m using his proxy signature key SB as fol-
lows:
cB = H1 (m ∥ rB)
UB = cBSBm + kBP
d.
B broadcasts (m, cB, UB).
where m is the message, rB is an intermedi-
ate value and (cB,UB) is the signature of B

on message m.
The signature generated by this scheme is
proxy protected as it can be created by the
proxy signer only.
5)
Veriﬁcation Phase
Any veriﬁer can verify signature on message m to be
valid as follows:
a)
Veriﬁer computes
rB = e (UB, P)

e (QA + QB, Ppub)H1(mw∥rA) rA
−cA
b)
Veriﬁer accepts signature to be valid on mes-
sage m if and only if
cB = H1 (m ∥ rB)
A. Security Analysis of Zhang and Kim’s scheme
The security analysis of Zhang and Kim’s scheme is as
follows:
1)
Secure channel is needed for transmission of secret
key from PKG to original signer A and proxy signer
B.
2)
If the private keys of original signer A and proxy
signer B has been compromised, even then since
people use their popular public IDs as public key,
the system is no longer secure.
3)
Validity of generated signature can be veriﬁed by any-
one which may not be desirable in some situations.
III.
PROPOSED SCHEME
In previous section, the Zang and Kim’s ID based proxy
signature which did not fulﬁll all the security requirements.
An ID based proxy signature scheme has been proposed
that overcomes some of the shortcomings pointed out in the
previous section. The given scheme consists of seven phases
namely, 1. Setup phase, 2. Public Key Generation phase, 3.
Private Key Generation phase, 4. Secret Key Sharing Phase 5.
Proxy Key Generation Phase, 6. Proxy signature generation,
and 7. Proxy signature veriﬁcation.
Let PKG be the private key generator. It generates public-
private key pairs for the original and proxy signer and veriﬁer.
Let Zp be a ﬁeld of order p. Let P be an element of Zp having
order p. Let Gp be an additive cyclic subgroup of Zp generated
by P and GM be a multiplicative group obtained by bilinear
pairing of Gp and e : Gp × Gp → GM be a bilinear map that
maps an element in Gp to an element in GM.
The various steps involved in the proposed proxy signature
scheme are as follows:
1)
Setup phase
In this phase, the PKG generates its own public
private key pair(Ppub, s) as follows:
a.
PKG selects an elliptic curve E over Zp and
broadcasts it.
PKG randomly selects s ∈ Zp where s is the
private key of PKG.
b.
Let P be a point on elliptic curve. PKG
generates its public key Ppub as follows:
Ppub = sP
(1)
where s is the private key of PKG
PKG then broadcasts Ppub and P.
2)
Public Key Generation
In this phase, PKG generates public keys of original
signer A, proxy signer B and veriﬁer C as follows:
a.
PKG calculates intermediate public key Qi
′
using public ID of signer(such as email ID,
telephone number etc) and a publicly known
hash function H1.
Qi
′ = H1 (IDi)
b.
The intermediate public key Qi
′ is concate-
nated with time parameter ti which indicates
the validity period of proxy signature key.
Qi = Q′
i ∥ ti
Qi is the public key for entity where i ∈
(A, B, C)
Note that public key is changed by PKG from
time to time so that even if the private key
is compromised, it cannot be misused for a
longer time.
3)
Private key generation phase
PKG computes each user i’s private key as follows:
Si = sQi
where
s is the secret key of PKG
Qi is the public key of user i and
Si is the secret key of user i
4)
Secret Sharing Phase
a.
To obtain its private key, each user i selects
a random point ri on elliptic curve where
i ∈ (A, B, C)
Let ri = (rix, riy) where rix and riy are the
x and y coordinates of ri respectively.
b.
User then computes ni = |rix + riy|
c.
User i then selects another random number
ki ∈ Zp.
d.
Each user i then encrypts the point ri using
PKG’s public key according to the following
equations [8]:
C1,i = kiP
C2,i = ri + kiPpub
Where PP ub is the public key of PKG.
Note that P, ri, C1,i, C2,i and Ppub are points
on an elliptic curve over Zp and ki is a scalar
quantity
e.
User i then sends C1.i and C2,i to PKG on
public channel.
f.
The PKG then decrypts C1,i and C2,i and
obtain ri as follows
ri = C2,i − sC1,i = C2,i − skiP = ri +
kiPpub − kiPpub = ri
g.
PKG then computes ni = |rix + riy|
h.
PKG calculates a series Ni using number ni
as
Ni = (1, ni, n2
i , .......nj
i, nl−1
i
)
where i ∈ (A, B, C) and j ∈ (0, 1, 2....., l −
1)
where l is the bitwise length of the private
key.
i.
PKG converts Si into binary form as Si =
(bl−1, bl−2, ..., b1, b0)
Where
b1−1
is
the
Most
Signiﬁcant

Bit(MSB) and b0 is the Least Signiﬁcant
Bit(LSB)
j.
PKG computes Ri for each user i using
KNAPSACK algorithm [9]
Ri = P nj
ibj, 0 ≤ j ≤ l − 1
k.
Then PKG sends Ri to the signer on public
channel.
l.
Signer i recovers Si = (bl−1, ......., b0) as
follows:
Let RI be an intermediate value derived from
Ri
I
k = 1.

R′
i = Ri

RI = R′
i − nl−k
i
.
IV
If RI < 0
bl−k = 0
IV
If RI ≥ 0
bl−k = 1, R′
i = RI
V
k = k + 1
VI
If k ≤ l, go to step III
If k > l, then end the process
In this way user i recovers his secret key Si.
5)
Proxy Key Generation
Original signer creates a message warrant mw spec-
ifying public identities of original and proxy signer,
validity period of signing of the proxy signature and
type of messages that can be signed.
a.
The original signer computes
S1 = H2 (mw ∥ SA)
(2)
Where H2 is publicly known hash function.
and sends (mw, S1) to B on public channel.
b.
B computes
S1
′ = H2 (S1 ∥ SB)
(3)
and sends

The intermediate public key Qi
′ is concatenated with
time parameter ti which indicates the validity period
of proxy signature key.
Qi = Q′
i ∥ ti
Qi is the public key for entity where i ∈ (A, B, C)
where Qi is the public ID of user i where i ∈
(A, B, C)
Where A is the original signer, B is the proxy signer
and C is the veriﬁer.
Let QA = (20, 3), QB = (4, 19) and QC = (15, 27).
c
Private Key Generation Phase
Private key of A i.e. SA is calculated as follows:
SA = sQA=SA = 3(20, 3)=(14,23)
Similarly, SB = (17, 19) and SC = (19, 13)
d
Secret Key Sharing Phase
Let user A selects rA = (3, 1).
Therefore nA = |3 + 1|=4
The generated series NA = 1, 4, 16,........
A selects a random number kA=2
A encrypts rA as follows:
C1,A = kAP = 2(1, 5) = (4, 19)
C2,A = rA + kAPpub = (3,1) + 2(20,3) = (0, 7)
(4, 19) and (0, 17) is sent by A to PKG instead of
(3, 1) on public channel.
PKG recovers rA as follows:
rA = C2,A − sC1,A = (0, 17) - 3(4,19)= (3,1)
PKG calculates nA = |3 + 1| = 4
PKG generates NA = 1, 4, 16,........
PKG converts SA = (14, 23), the private key of A
into binary form (01110, 10111).
14 is encrypted as follows:
(14)10 = (01110)2 = (0x256) + (1x64) + (1x16) +
(1x4) + (0x1) = 84.
Similarly 23 is encrypted as 277.
PKG sends (84, 277) instead of (14, 23) to A on
public channel.
84 is decrypted as follows:
Let RI be an intermediate variable.
RI = 84 - 44 = -172 which is negative, hence b4 = 0.
RI = 84 - 43 = 20 which is positive, hence b3 = 1.
RI = 20 - 16 = 4 which is positive, hence b2 = 1.
RI = 4 - 41 = 0 which is 0, hence b1 = 1.
RI = 0 - 1 = -1 which is negative, hence b0 = 0.
Hence, 84 is decrypted into (01110)2 = (14)10.
Similarly, 277 is decrypted into (10111)2 = (23)10.
In this way, A recovers its private key SA = (14, 23).
Similarly, B and C receive their private key SB = (17,
19) and SC = (19, 13).
e
Proxy Key Generation
Original signer selects a message warrant mw = 6.
The original signer computes
S1 = H2 (mw ∥ SA) = H2 (3 ∥ (14, 23))
Where H2 is publicly known hash function that gives
a point S1 on elliptic curve E.
Let S1 = (10, 4)
and sends (6, (10, 4)) to B on public channel.
B computes
S1
′ = S1
′ = H2 (S1 ∥ SB) = H2 ((10, 4) ∥ (17, 19))
Let S1
′ = (1, 24)
and sends (6, (1, 24)) to PKG on public channel.
PKG accepts (6, (1, 24)) if the following equation
holds true:
H2 (H2 (6 ∥ (14, 23)) ∥ (17, 19)) = (1, 24).
PKG computes public-private key pair (Sw, Qw) of
proxy signer B as follows:
Qw = H1 (6)
Where H1 is a publicly known hash function that
maps mw to a point Qw on elliptic curve E
Let Qw be (8, 10).
The private key Sw is calculated as follows:
Sw = sQw = 3(8, 10) = (16, 2).
PKG sends (16, 2) to B on public channel using
Knapsack algorithm.
PKG also broadcasts the public key Qw.
B accepts (16, 2) only if the following equation holds
true:
e ((16, 2), (1, 5)) = e (H1 (6) , (20, 3)), where e is a
bilinear pairing that maps a pair of elements in addi-
tive cyclic group Gp to an element in multiplicative
group GM.
The above condition holds true if Sw is valid.
This step ensures data integrity of Sw and Qw.
f
Proxy Signature Generation
Let the message to be signed by proxy signer be m
= 8.
(B) generates proxy signature on message m = 8 in
following manner:
B computes
T = e (Sw, QC) = e ((16, 2), (15, 27))
where QC is the public key of veriﬁer. e is a bilinear
pairing that maps a pair of elements in additive cyclic
group Gp to an element in multiplicative group GM.
Let us assume that bilinear pairing e maps (16, 2)
and (15, 27) to an element (20, 26).
e ((16, 2), (15, 27)) = (20, 26)
B then computes Sg = H2 (8 ∥ 6 ∥ (20, 26))
Assuming that the hash function gives (13, 6) as
output, we obtain the following equation:
Sg = H2 (8 ∥ 6 ∥ (20, 26)) = (13, 6)
B sends (6, 8, (13, 6)) to the veriﬁer for veriﬁcation.
g
Proxy Signature Veriﬁcation
To accept the signature is accepted by the veriﬁer by
calculating the following:
PKG calculates an intermediate value ¯T as follows:
¯T = e (H1 (6, ) , (19, 13))
Let us assume that H1(6) = (2, 6).
We also assume the following:
¯T = e (H1 (6, ) , (19, 13)) = (2, 6)
Where (19, 13) is the private key of veriﬁer.
PKG calculates an intermediate variable s′ as follows:
s′ = H2 (6 ∥ 8 ∥ (2, 6))
The signature is accepted by PKG if the following
equation holds true:
s′ = Sg
The above equation holds true if the authorized proxy
signer B signs the message m = 8 and designated
veriﬁer C veriﬁes the signature.
B. Security Analysis of the Proposed Scheme
In this section we discuss about the security aspects of the
proposed scheme such as trusted PKG, proxy key revocation,
designated veriﬁer, proxy protected, unforgability, non repudi-
ation and secure channel. They are as follows:
239

SECURWARE 2016 : The Tenth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

1)
Trusted PKG
The security of ID based signatures is based on the
fact that PKGs should be trusted. If the PKG is not
trusted then the scheme is not secure. However, given
a trusted PKG, the scheme is secure.
2)
Private key revocation
Even if private key of user is compromised, it cannot
be misused for a long time as public key is valid
only for particular time for which the time parameter
ti remains unchanged.
3)
Designated veriﬁer
Only designated veriﬁer C can verify the proxy
signature which is desirable in some situations.This
is done by using the public key of veriﬁer QC in
creating the signature Sg which can be veriﬁed only
if the veriﬁer has the corresponding private key SC.
This happens because the designated veriﬁers public
key is also involved in signing the message m and
it can be veriﬁed by the designated veriﬁer using his
own public key.
4)
Proxy protected
Only the proxy signer should be able to create a
valid proxy signature, not the original signer. In this
scheme, the secret key of the proxy signer Sw is
calculated by PKG using his own secret key s which
cannot be calculated by the original signer due to
Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem(ECDLP).
Hence the proposed scheme is proxy protected.
5)
Unforgability
Only the proxy signer should be able to create a valid
proxy signature. In the proposed scheme, as the proxy
signer creates the signature Sg using his own private
key Sw, no one else can sign on behalf of proxy
signer, neither the original signer himself nor a third
party.
6)
Non-repudiation
The proxy signer should not be able to deny his
signature later on. In this scheme the proxy signer
creates signature Sg by using his private key Sw and
is veriﬁed by veriﬁer using proxy signer’s public key
Qw using his public key. Hence, the proxy signer
cannot deny his signature.
7)
Secure channel
In Zang and Kim’s scheme, a secure channel is
required for transmission of secret key from PKG
to signers. In our proposed scheme, the PKG uses
KNAPSACK algorithm to encrypt the secret keys and
signers use reverse knapsack to extract back the keys.
Therefore communication can take place on insecure
channel.

Kim’s scheme and proposed scheme.
IV.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a new ID based proxy
signature scheme. The scheme has eliminated the use of secure
channel for transmission of private key from PKG to original
signer, proxy signer and veriﬁer using KNAPSACK algorithm.
This scheme also exhibits Private key revocation feature such
that if a private key is exposed, it cannot be used for a
long time. This scheme allows the proxy signature to be
veriﬁed by a designated veriﬁer only. As it satisﬁes all security
requirements, it can be used in future proxy applications. This
scheme is designed for a single proxy signer only, which can
be extended to multiple proxy signers. However, the proposed
needs a trusted PKG. This condition can be removed as part
of future work.
