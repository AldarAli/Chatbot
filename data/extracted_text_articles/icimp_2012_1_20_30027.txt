Abstract— Protection in the Internet and World Wide Web is 
based on the Socket Secure Layer (SSL) protocol and 
certification authorities, who verify the identities of servers 
with SSL certificates. Trust in the Web is based on users’ 
perception of sites’ trustworthiness and privacy as well as 
knowledge of servers’ monitored behavior. Community-based 
reputation systems enable users to share their views on 
servers’ trustworthiness. In this paper, we provide a large-
scale empirical analysis on the correlation of SSL certification 
and community-based reputation evaluations. By using 
publicly available global certificate and reputation databases, 
we study how availability of SSL support and properties of 
certificates 
correlates 
to 
users’ 
perception 
of 
trust, 
dependability, and privacy. The paper proposes a metric for 
revealing the benefits that service providers gain from SSL 
certification in general, from authority selection, and from 
extended validation. The proposed reputation metric could 
provide  a  mean  to  quantify  the  users’  valuation  of  security  
measures. Hence, it can be utilized when selecting and 
designing new web security mechanisms.

 INTRODUCTION  
Authentication and confidentiality of communication in 
the  World  Wide  Web  (WWW)  is  based  on  HTTPS  
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) [1] and SSL (Secure 
Socket Layer) [2] protocols as well as X509 public key 
certificates [3, 4]. The authentication model is scalable and 
capable of preventing most masquerading attacks when used 
properly. The model has, however, been criticized due to 
large amount of equally trusted certification authorities 
(CAs) and loose certification processes, which make 
acquiring of phishing certificates possible for attackers. 
Extended validation [5] certificates and additional visual 
trust indicators in browsers have been proposed as a more 
secure certification alternative. However, there have not been 
large scale studies on the benefits that the service providers 
gain from SSL certification in general and from extended 
validation. 
Trust in WWW is based on users’ perception on the 
trustworthiness of web sites as well as on reputation of 
services and service providers. To ease users to decide 
whether to trust a site or not, reputation services, e.g., Web 
of Trust (WOT) [6], have emerged. These services enable 
browsers to show visual warning or block access when the 
user tries to access a web site with poor reputation. The 
reputation is a measure determined by monitoring the 
behavior and content of servers. It can be based on 
automated analysis or on ratings shared by users.  
Servers’ support for SSL correlates with servers’ security 
related reputation. SSL makes phishing and other 
masquerading attacks as well as confidentiality breaches 
harder. Therefore, it should increase reputation of servers 
when considering trustworthiness and privacy. The 
correlation and the causal relation between reputation and 
SSL are not straightforward or direct. In addition to SSL, 
other factors affect to the users perception of trust. A service 
provider that invests to security may also invest other factors 
increasing the reputation. Nevertheless, the correlation can 
be used as a one metric when evaluating the usefulness of 
SSL certification.  
This paper contributes by providing a large-scale 
empirical analysis on the correlation of SSL certification and 
crowd-based reputation evaluations. Existing work studying 
effectiveness of SSL certification and warnings in browsers 
has concentrated on experiments with restricted amount of 
participants. In this study, we analyze real world data in 
much larger scale. In our study, the data comes from real 
deployments and thus cannot be distorted due to laboratory 
arrangements. The study has two implications. Firstly, we 
measure the benefits that reputations of web services gain 
from SSL certification and extended validation as well as 
from the selection of more reputable certification authorities. 
Secondly, we introduce a metric that can be used when 
analyzing impacts and visibility of web security solutions. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents 
related work and motivates our research. In Section III, we 
describe what data was collected for the analysis. Section IV 
presents results of statistical analysis on the correlation of 
SSL certificates and reputation ratings. A discussion on the 
results and their potential exploitation is provided in Section 
V. Section VI concludes and summarizes the paper.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
A. SSL Certification 
Authentication of web servers is based on X.509 
certificates, which have been granted to servers by a trusted 
CA. In typical browsers (including Mozilla Firefox, Internet 
Explorer, Google Chrome etc.) the amount of accepted root 
certificates is large. The acceptance criteria depend on the 
trustworthiness of CA but also on business and politics. If 
one of these CAs has been compromised and certifies bogus 
7

servers, the end-users web transactions are in jeopardy. 
Browser’s security identifiers will not warn on bogus servers 
certified by trusted CA even if it would have been a different 
CA that actually had signed the victim service. Attacks 
demonstrating the weaknesses of CAs have already been 
reported, including the recent DigiNotar and Comodo 
incidents [7, 8]. 
Large scale studies on how the certificates are used has 
been performed by Eckersley et al. [9], who scanned public 
Internet for certificates and reported several vulnerabilities. 
Vratonjic et al. [10] analyzed certificates with the million 
most popular web sites and reported that most HTTPS 
servers do not use certificates properly. Typical problems are 
domain mismatch, certificate expiration and untrusted (self-
signed) certificates.  
Dhamija et al. [11] studied users ability to distinguish 
real web sites from spoofed sites using SSL warnings. They 
found that 23% of participants did not check browser’s 
passive security indicators at all when evaluating the 
trustworthiness of the site. Sunshine et al. [12] performed a 
survey and a laboratory test to examine users’ reactions to 
different active SSL warnings. They noted that users’ 
behaviour depends on the actual message as well as on the 
service type. Tests revealed that more than the half of the 
hundred participants ignored the warnings of the main 
stream browsers and proceeded to the web sites anyhow. A 
bit more moderate results were gained by Egelman et al. [13] 
who found that 21% of sixty study participants ignored 
active warnings and fell to phishing attacks. When the 
security indicators and warnings are ignored, the credibility 
of a web site depends on various other factors. These factors 
were  studied  by  Fogg  et  al.  [14].  Their  study,  made  with  
1400 participants, reveals that real-world feel, ease of use 
and expertise are the most important categories affecting to 
credibility. 
SSL certificates are assigned to service providers through 
diverse certification processes. Typically, it is enough that 
the requester has an access to email, which has been 
registered for the domain name holder. This makes 
acquirement of phishing certificates possible for attackers. 
Some certification authorities may have more trustworthy 
processes in use but the large amount of equally trusted 
authorities means that end-users do not have practical means 
to separate real and trustworthy certifications from bogus 
certification received from a compromised or careless 
authority.  
 
Extended Validation Certificates [5] and additional 
visual trust indicators in browsers have been proposed as a 
more secure certification alternative. EV certificates are 
given for servers, which have gone through stricter 
authentication processes. Browsers identify servers with EV 
certificates as more trusted by displaying additional trust 
indicators, notably green address bar. See Figure 1 and 
Figure 2 for examples of address bar in Mozilla Firefox 8 
and Internet Explorer 8 looks when browser connects to 
services with either  unsecure HTTP, (ignored) invalid 
certificate on HTTPS server, valid regular certificate on 
HTTPS server, or EV certificate on HTTPS server. EV trust 
indicators have been supported for a couple of years in the 
main stream browsers including Microsoft Internet Explorer 
(since version 7, released October 2006), Mozilla Firefox 
(version 3, June 2008), Opera (version 9.5, June 2008), 
Google Chrome (September 2008) and Safari (version 3.2, 
November 2008). 
 
 
Figure 1. Security indicators in address bar of Mozilla Firefox 8 (from top 
to bottom: unsecured HTTP, ignored certificate error, regular certificate, 
extended validation certificate) 
 
Figure 2. Security indicators in address bar of Internet Explorer 8 
The question whether the extended validation increase 
the security and trustworthiness has been considered by few 
researchers. Sobey et al. [15] studied whether users notice 
the additional trust indicators by tracking eye movements of 
28 untrained test participants who were making online 
shopping decisions. They concluded that the validation 
indicators in Mozilla Firefox 3’s address bar went unnoticed 
for all participants and proposed, as an alternative, more 
visible and obtrusive trust indicators. Similar results were 
gained by Jackson et al. [16] studied whether extended 
validation would help users to detect phishing attacks more 
easily with a test group of 27 participants and whether 
security trained users, who had read a help file, are capable 
to use these indicators. They noted that the trained users did 
not outperform the untrained users as extended validation did 
not help users to detect control attacks.  
 
Some researchers have addressed the problems of weak 
certification by proposing means to determine certificates’ 
trustworthiness and to limit certificate issuers’ authorities. 
Marlinspike  presented [17] a solution called Converge for 
turning off all untrusted CAs in a browser. The idea includes 
a trust management scheme, where other users’ views and 
consensus on particular CAs can be queried from notaries. 
Another solution called CertLock, presented by Soghoian 
and Stamm [18], tries to detect suspicious CA changes in 
certificates. They focus particularly on CA’s country of 
origin and in the prevention of governmental attacks. 
CertLock uses browsers history information on certificates 
and warns end-users if CA’s country of origin has been 
changed. In Perspectives [19], presented by Wendlandt et al., 
a trusted party collects issuer identity information frequently 
from TLS servers. The browser plugin may then query 
8

whether the issuer has been changed and warn end-user 
accordingly. A related certificate transparency proposal was 
made by Laurie and Langley [20]. They proposed that end-
users would accept only those certificates, which are 
available from trusted and public source. The approach 
would prevent long-life attacks, as service providers could to 
monitor this public source and suppress fake certificates, 
claiming their domain names.  
B. Web Reputation 
SSL certification provides mechanisms for checking that 
web servers belong to the legitimate entities. However, it 
does not address whether the server acts inappropriate and 
expected manner and thus whether the site can be trusted. 
Untrustworthy web sites can be avoided by using blacklists, 
containing sites with bad reputation, and whitelists, 
containing 
sites with good 
reputation. 
Black- 
and 
whitelisting can be based either on automated techniques, 
where server’s content is checked against malware 
fingerprints, or manual techniques, where users evaluate 
sites’ trustworthiness. Human based evaluation is extensive 
only  when  a  large  number  of  people,  a  community  or  a  
crowd, are participating.  
One of the crowd based reputation information providers 
is WOT. WOT is a company, which collects information 
from the open community of volunteers. These volunteers 
evaluate the web sites they visit by using browser add-ons, 
which are available for Firefox, IE, Chrome, Safari, and 
Opera. The WOT company was founded July 2006.  In 
November 2011 they reported that their database contains 
ratings from over 33 million servers.  
The strength of WOT is in the detail of information. 
Evaluation is based on collecting users’ subjective ratings, 
which vary from very poor (numeric values 0-19), poor (20-
39), unsatisfactory (40-59) and good (60-79) to excellent 
(80-100). Ratings are given to four different categories: 
1. Trustworthiness – whether the site is safe to use and 
free of malware and phishing attacks 
2. Vendor dependability – whether the commercial 
actor (e.g., a web shop) behind the server can be 
trusted and provides good shopping experience 
3. Privacy – whether the server is trusted to protect 
users information appropriately and does not collect 
private information for vague purposes 
4. Child safety – whether the server contains material 
such as adult content, violence or hateful language, 
not suitable for the children 
 
In addition to the ratings, WOT provides confidence 
information for each rating. Confidence is presented by using 
six different categories and numeric value from 0 to 100.  A 
rating is more credible when large amount of contributors 
have given similar ratings and when these contributors itself 
have 
high 
individual 
confidence 
rating. 
Individual 
confidence ratings grow among time when users contribute. 
WOT does not reveal how the confidence ratings and 
reputation ratings are exactly calculated to make misuse 
harder. 
Reputation systems are vulnerable for manipulating 
attacks as discussed by Moore et al. [21] who analyzed a 
phishing focused service called PhishTank [22]. They noted 
that the service is dominated by most active users and there 
is a risk of manipulation by small number of people. The 
accuracy, completeness and vulnerabilities of the WOT 
metrics have been analyzed by Chia et al. [23]. They found 
that WOT was more comprehensive than the compared 
automated services (Google’s Safe Browsing, McAfee’s 
SiteAdvisor and Norton’s Safe Web) in detecting malicious 
domains. They also argued that WOT may be resistant 
against manipulation attacks due to advanced statistical 
analysis on the contributors’ behavior but that it is still 
vulnerable for determined malicious gamers. However, as 
manipulation is likely to affect only restricted amount of 
servers, it is not likely to distort our large scale statistical 
studies.  
Accuracy of crowd-based reputation systems and black 
lists has been enhanced by combining results from various 
heterogeneous 
sources. 
For 
instance, 
WOT 
utilizes 
blacklisting information from PhishTank. Use of quantitative 
web traffic information was proposed by Sharifi et al. [24], 
who automated information collection from various web 
services, including traffic ranking and search engine hits, and 
analyzed how well this information supports scam detection. 
III. 
COMBINING SSL CERTIFICATE, WEB REPUTATION 
AND WEB RANK DATA 
We collected, combined, and analyzed data from three 
different repositories as illustrated in Figure 3. First we 
received SSL certificate database collected in SSL 
observatory project of Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). 
Secondly, information on web server’s popularity was 
received in form of a list of top million servers produced by 
Alexa. Then, for the all valid certificates and for all top 
servers, we requested Web reputation ratings from WOT.  
 
 
Figure 3. Composition of analysis data 
SSL certificates available in the public Internet have been 
collected in EFF’s SSL observatory project [9, 25]. The 
database contains almost 4 million certificates, including 
both ‘regular’ certificates as well as extended validation 
certificates. We used certificates, which were collected 
December  2010  and  classified  as  valid  by  EFF.  For  the  
analysis we resolved and selected those HTTPS servers, 
which had complete domain name (certificates with wild 
cards in domain names were ignored), were active and fully 
9

working in November 2011. Services were classified as 
active if the request (to the root directory of the SSL (443) 
port) resulted a reply larger than 1kB. This limit filtered most 
servers were HTTPS port is used only for redirection to 
HTTP port or for some other limited purpose.  
List of top million servers, collected by Alexa [26], was 
used to get domain names of servers, which are really used 
and frequently visited. This enables comparison between 
HTTP only servers and servers with HTTPS support. For 
each server in the list, we collected HTTPS status 
information indicating whether the HTTPS port was open 
and whether the connection succeeded without warnings.   
WOT reputation metrics were collected for all HTTPS 
sites as well as for HTTP only sites among top million 
servers in order to enable comparisons. The confidence limit 
does not affect substantially to counted averages but it filters 
out some suspicious ratings. In our analysis, described later, 
we used only those ratings with reasonable confidence value 
(12 or higher). Data was collected and analyzed with Linux 
shell and Perl scripts. SSL status queries and certificate 
verifications were done on a client based on OpenSSL. 
Certificates of contacted servers were verified against root 
certificate  list  used  by  Mozilla.  MySQL  was  used  as  
database software. For EFF dataset we found 201,099 active 
and reputed HTTPS servers and for Alexa dataset we found 
reputation  information for 132,533 HTTP only servers, for 
68,961 HTTPS servers, and for 34,985 broken HTTPS 
servers (showing security warnings when connected). 
IV. 
CORRELATION BETWEEN WEB REPUTATION AND 
HTTPS SUPPORT 
A. Does the HTTPS Support Increase Reputation? 
The effect of HTTPS support to reputation rankings was 
studied by calculating average and distribution of reputation 
values from the Alexa dataset, which contained information 
from top million servers. The results for trustworthiness and 
privacy reputation are given in Table 1 and Table 2, 
respectively. For both metrics the rating for errorless HTTPS 
support gives around six additional points. Similarly, the 
amount of poor and very poor rates drops from around 9% to 
4% when HTTPS was supported. Additionally we studied 
how the security warnings, such as domain mismatch or self-
signed certificate, affects the ratings. We noted that HTTPS 
increases trustworthiness only when used correctly. 
However, even misused SSL based cryptography increases 
privacy ratings with one point.

The servers in HTTPS category may have also the HTTP 
port open. Hence, we cannot say whether the user 
evaluations were done in the HTTPS secured connection or 
not. From the larger EFF dataset, we found servers that had 
only HTTPS port active. For 431 servers the average trust 
value was 86,6 (when the average value for all HTTPS 
servers in ‘EFF dataset’ was 85,8). The privacy ratings for 
371 servers were 87,9 (and 87,1 for all). This small sample 
indicates that reputation of servers supporting only HTTPS 
would be even larger. 
We studied also how trustworthiness and privacy 
reputations correlate with the popularity of server. Sliding 
averages presented in Figure 4 illustrate that the better 
ranking Alexa increases trustworthiness and privacy value. 
The difference of reputation between secured and unsecured 
is visible despite the popularity, though the difference is 
smaller with more popular servers. 
 
 
Figure 4. Dependency between reputations and popularity 
B. Differences between CAs 
There are clear differences between the reputation of 
servers certified by different CAs. The following table 
presents results of CAs, which all had more than thousand 
valid certificates used by active and trustworthiness ranking 
with reliability at least 12 points servers within ‘EFF 
dataset’. The results show a difference of over 10 points 
between the averages of the best and the worse CAs. The 
difference is even significant when looking at the ratio of 
poor and very poor sites: increase from close zero to 7,4%. 
Different CA brands provided by one company have not 
been combined in the table. For example, Comodo is also the 
provider of The Usertrust Network and Terena certificates, 
Symantec is the owner of Verisign and Thawte.

The Value of Extended Validation Certificates 
Extended validation provides only small or no increase of 
reputation at all. Table 4 compares trustworthiness and 
privacy values of EV certificates to non-EV certificates 
within the EFF dataset. Trustworthiness average is 0,7% 
higher and privacy value is 0,5% smaller.

DISCUSSION 
A. The Value of SSL and the Limitations of the Metric 
Our intuition was that the support for HTTPS affects to 
reputation in two manners: Visibility of security indicators 
may increase it and security warning indicators and dialogs 
as well as published security problems will decrease the 
reputation. However, service providers who are willing to 
invest more on HTTPS are typically also willing to invest on 
other factors increasing reputation. The reputation is not a 
result of HTTPS support. Instead, they are both results of 
security efforts. However, even though the correlation does 
not imply causality, it indicates possible causes. Future 
research is needed to understand, in more detail, what is the 
value of SSL certification and what is the value of other 
factors contributing to reputation. 
The results show that there is a clear correlation between 
HTTPS support and Web reputation. The reputation average 
of valid SSL certificates was significantly higher than the 
average of servers with broken certificates. Hence, it seems 
to pay off to have a working HTTPS support.  
The difference of reputation average between the best 
CA and the worst CAs was significant. Certification 
authorities are not typically selected from the security 
perspective, instead price, compatibility with browsers and 
easiness are likely to be more important factors. Hence, the 
correlation may not be used to indicate of weak certification 
procedures but it can be used to characterize attackers' 
probable selections. 
The difference between regular and extended validation 
certificates was insignificant. Since EV certificates are more 
expensive it would be likely that these service providers 
would had invested also in other factors contributing sites 
trustworthiness. 
For 
that 
reason 
we 
expected 
the 
trustworthiness ratings for EV certificates to be higher. 
Detected correlation seems to indicate that the additional 
trust indicators in browsers (Figure 1 and Figure 2) are 
undetected by the users. This result confirms the previous 
small scale end-users studies that trust indicators are ignored. 
Hence, according to these results we could ask why to pay an 
extra for extended validation. 
We did not analyze differences between applications and 
business sectors. It may be likely that HTTPS and extended 
validation are typically used in more critical services, such as 
banks, and that WOT contributors valuate these services 
differently or more carefully. In the future, it should be 
studied how the application field affects to the reputation.  
Reputation systems may utilize information on the SSL 
certification. Currently, WOT collects information on newly 
discovered phishing attacks from PhishTank and adjust 
reputations accordingly. Similarly, knowledge that a server 
has a valid certificate may increase trustworthiness and 
privacy reputation values of the domain name.  
B. How to Utilize the Reputation Metrics? 
Reputation metrics provide us a mean to quantify users’ 
perception of security. These metrics provide researchers a 
better understanding on the effectiveness and impact of 
security mechanisms. Hence, the metrics can be valuable 
when developing new useful security solutions. Also, the 
information on the correlation can be used by decision 
makers, when analyzing which security mechanisms are 
needed and provide enough benefits to justify the 
investments.  
Metrics may be used also to enhance applications for 
existing web security solutions. Specially, they are usable in 
notary based CA selection approaches. For instance, in 
Convergence  [17],  the  browser  trusts  only  those  SSL  
certificates which have been certified by CAs, which are 
accepted by particular notaries. However, it may be difficult

for notaries to know which CAs to trust. Reputation gives 
notaries a tool, formal metric, which can be used when 
evaluating CAs’ trustworthiness. This would act as an 
incentive for CAs to verify services more thoroughly, as root 
certificates with bad trustworthiness averages could be 
considered as untrusted in some browsers.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we studied the correlation between web 
reputation metrics (particularly WOT trustworthiness and 
privacy values) and SSL certification. Web reputation 
metrics provide researchers a statistical mean to quantify 
users’ perception of trust and privacy and, hence, impact and 
effectiveness of security solutions. The results of our-large 
scale HTTPS/SSL correlation analysis reinforce the doubts 
on the inefficiency of the extended validation in SSL 
certification. They also reveal the differences between 
servers certified by different authorities.   
In the future, more studies and analysis is needed to fully 
understand the causal relation between security mechanisms 
and end-user’s perception of security. We need to study 
differences between particular web service categories and 
within selected services in order to understand all the 
contributing factors.
