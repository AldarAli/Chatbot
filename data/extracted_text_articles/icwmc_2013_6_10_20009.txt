Abstract—The measurement and evaluation of video quality is 
a great challenge for real-time communication. Among those 
algorithms that evaluate the quality of video, many of them 
usually make use of reference the original video to compare 
pixel by pixel with the transmitted video. This fact makes the 
application of these algorithms complicated in real-time 
environments. Moreover, these algorithms based on structural 
similarity do not take into account human visual system 
information. This paper presents an algorithm that aims to 
assess the quality of a video sequence using the blurring effect 
based on human visual system information.

 INTRODUCTION 
Streaming multimedia content is very sensitive to 
network conditions, especially in real-time transmissions. 
The noises introduced into an image in many instances are 
not perceived by the Human Visual System (HVS). Thus, 
packet loss and delays may not influence decisively the 
level of video quality perceived by the viewer. Human 
perception tends to tolerate more visual distortions since the 
images have an acceptable level of comprehension. 
Therefore, the concept of Quality of Experience (QoE) is 
essential for the development of models for measuring video 
quality [8], [9]. 
There are two different ways to calculate the quality of 
video transmitted over a network. The subjective tests are 
based directly on visual perception of the viewer, while the 
objective tests attempt to estimate the quality of a video 
without the direct intervention of the viewer, simulating the 
Human Visual System. 
The subjective test is known as Mean Opinion Score 
(MOS) and has higher cost of implementation because it 
requires adequate space, specific technological resources, 
planning time and viewers in good eye health. However, the 
subjective test is presented as more reliable technique to 
human perception of quality. The recommendation BT. 500-
11 ITU-R has specific procedures to perform the subjective 
tests [6]. 
Another way is through objective tests. The greatest 
interest of a metric objective is to be able to replace 
subjective tests, which are more expensive. Recent surveys 
show that the objective metrics that consider widely the 
Human Visual System have better results. 
Most objective metrics are Full Reference (FR) or 
Reduced Reference (RR), only some are Null Reference 
(NR) [10], [11].  
FR metrics determine the quality by comparing the 
images pixel by pixel of video transmitted over the 
corresponding images of the original video. RR metric 
selects some information from both video, and compares to 
obtain the quality threshold. NR metrics measure quality 
based on the video itself without receiving any information 
of the original video. 
One of the best known metrics for objective evaluation 
is the Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR). PSNR is the ratio 
between the input and output of a lossy compression 
process, which assesses how much compression added 
noises in the original image. Therefore, to perform the 
calculation, one needs to compare the original video and the 
video transmitted, featuring then a FR metric [1]. 
The metric PSNR has been widely used and has proven 
useful in many papers. However, it is not entirely reliable, 
especially because it takes into account the Human Visual 
System [10], [12].  
In real-time environments it is clearly not feasible to 
have the original video as a parameter for measuring 
quality, thus justified the importance of NR metrics. 
This paper aims to propose a NR metric for estimating 
video quality by using the artifact blurring in transmissions 
in real time [3]. 
Section 2 presents the description of the metric 
estimation of video quality using the blurring artifact and 
the conception of the algorithm. Section 3 illustrates the 
environment 
and 
details 
the 
methodology 
of 
the 
experiments. Section 4 describes the analysis of the results 
obtained in the experiments, highlighting the impact of QoS 
metrics have on the blur metric, and demonstrate the 
performance of this metric over the visual quality of the 
frames. Prediction models are defined in Section 5; the NR 
blur metric is taking as input the values of the variables of 
QoS. Section 6 presents the conclusion of our work and 
final remarks. 
II. 
DESCRIPTION OF BLUR METRIC  
Blur effect is caused by a loss of the high frequency 
content and can occur when we have video sequences, 
which characterizes well the video streams in a network 
environment.

In this sense, the estimate of the degree of blurring 
suffered by a sequence of frames can greatly influence the 
video quality and be able to demonstrate the current state of 
a network through the relationship with the QoS metrics. 
Therefore, the reverse is true if there is a coherent 
correlation between the metric and QoS metrics jitter, delay 
and loss. 
To find this correlation we must first understand how the 
blur effect is perceived by people. When comparing a sharp 
image with this same image blurred, human perception 
detects a significant difference in terms of loss of detail 
between the first and second image. However, if we 
compare an image already blurred and the same image 
further blurred the difference between the two can be small. 
This situation is depicted in Fig. 1. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. From left to right: original frame, frame transmitted with limited 
100Kbps, frame transmitted with limited 50Kbps 
An important detail is that, when observing an image 
containing a small part blurred over a homogeneous area, 
human perception identifies that the image is blurred, even 
if only a small part is blurred. For this reason, the analysis 
of the variation of neighboring pixels, the blurring metric 
considers only the pixels that have changed after the process 
that causes the uncomfortable image in [3]. In this sense, the 
main idea is to determine the degree of blurring suffered by 
frame, compared to a previous frame. 
Considering the phenomena explained, it is then possible 
to quantify the discomfort caused by the blur effect in a 
video frame. The first step consists of calculating the metric 
in determining the variations in intensity between 
neighboring pixels of an initial frame. Then, calculate the 
variations between neighboring pixels of the next frame and 
compare the variations of intensity of the initial frame and 
the next frame, allowing to evaluate the nuisance blur effect 
between the two frames. 
Thus, a greater variation between the initial frame and 
the next frame means that the initial frame was clear. 
However, if there is less variation between the original 
frame and the next frame means that the initial frame was 
already blurred. This description is summarized in Fig. 2.

Blur Estimation

Importantly, the 
metric uses frames that were 
transmitted from the server to the client, not requiring the 
use of the original video to analyze video quality, unlike the 
PSNR metric that needs the original frames of reference. 
Therefore, this estimation of blurring is characterized as a 
method of gauging the video quality without reference. 
This feature eliminates the inconsistency problem that 
can occur using the PSNR, which may be caused by losses 
in the transmission frames, which in many cases causes a 
loss of reference for calculating the quality of certain frames 
[3]. 
It is, then, necessary to analyze the variation of 
neighboring pixels. If this variation between the two frames 
is high, the initial frame has a higher degree of sharpness. 
Therefore, in order to represent the degree of blurring, the 
result is normalized within the defined range between 0 and 
1, which are respectively the best and worst quality in terms 
of perceived blurring. Based on the concepts and equations 
described in [3] was possible to adapt the metric in the form 
of algorithm running within an environment of streaming 
video on demand, returning the value of blurring each 
frame, allowing the achievement of threshold quality of the 
video as a whole. 
We used a function written in GNU Octave [13], 
developed for mathematical computation. Initially, we used 
an implementation of the blurring of perception developed 
in MATLAB described in [3] and adapted their execution in 
Octave, in order to insert a loop for process all frames in 
video sequence. 
The original function returns the value of blurring only 
comparing the original image with a blurred image. As in 
our model we want to perform video transmission, it was 
necessary to adapt the metric to function within a repeating 
structure that calls the function for each frame received by 
the client. 
After transmission of the video in the network, we need 
to transform the mp4 video received by the user into png 
images and then execute the program that calculates the 
blurring. 
With these frames stored in a folder, we can change the 
algorithm of perceived blurring to obtain the quality of each 
frame. Thus we call the function that calculates the blurring 
comparing the current frame to the next frame, for later 
analysis.

METHODOLOGY 
The structure of the test environment was built with the 
goal of providing adequate conditions for implementation of 
multimedia streams, in order to facility the assessment of 
that the network quality of services causes in the video 
quality reception. 
The physical layout and functionality of computers 
followed the recommendation G. 1082 ITU-T described in 
[7], which defines well most environments used in research 
of this nature. We used four netbooks prepared as described 
101

in Fig. 3; each netbook played certain roles within the 
proposed scheme. 
 
 
Figure 3. Environment execution of experiments 
In the environment we have a media server that delivers 
content on demand to customers via VLC server. The core 
network consists of two routers that communicate with each 
other through a WLAN 802.11g. The video streams stored 
in the Content Provider and Service Provider are sent via the 
Network and viewed by End-User. In the user's host is 
deployed a testbed for optimization and automation of 
media requests and data collection regarding network 
transmission and video. 
The hosts running the Linux operating system Ubuntu 
11.04. The other programs used in the experiments are all 
based on free software. The videos were encoded in 
H264/MPEG4 using 300Kbps bitrate and GOP size 12 
obtained in [2]. The characteristics of videos used are 
described in Table I. 
TABLE I. DESCRIPTION OF VIDEO SEQUENCES USED IN 
TRANSMISSIONS 
 
The experiments were composed of 4 test groups 
categorized by the band width limitation imposed on the 
network for multimedia streams, as shown in Table II. 
TABLE II. GROUP OF EXPERIMENTS DEFINED FROM THE 
BANDWIDTH LIMITATION IMPOSED ON THE NETWORK 
Group of experiment 
Multimedia traffic limited to: 
Group 01 
50 Kbps 
Group 02 
100 Kbps 
Group 03 
300 Kbps 
Group 04 
500 Kbps 
 
To determine the sample size needed for population 
results presented 95% confidence, a sample was defined 
model of 10 broadcasts each video stream, in order to assess 
statistical data from the results. We use a bandwidth 
limitation 
for 
multimedia 
transmission 
of 
50Kbps, 
characterized as the worst in our proposal. 
Thus, we found the mean and average standard deviation 
of each population parameter used. Analyzing the results, 
the delay showed the values of standard deviation higher, so 
the estimate of the ideal size of population was based on this 
metric. 
Thus, in each group, we executed the 3 video streams 
described, 135 transmissions for each stream, totaling 270 
transmissions/group and 1080 overall transmissions. For 
each group of experiments, we observed variable values of 
delay, jitter, and packet loss during transmission of each 
video stream in order to identify and analyze the impacts of 
these parameters on video quality NR blur metric. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
Based on these procedures, we analyzed the data 
obtained in the transmission, where it was possible to find 
the boundary values for each parameter raised to a video 
that can be delivered with quality customer service. The 
information collected in each test group used to calculate 
statistically the influence that each has on QoS metrics to 
measure objectively without reference BLUR. This 
determination makes it possible to predict video quality 
based on network conditions, by analyzing correlations 
between QoS and variable QoV BLUR. 
Based on what was described in the previous section, it 
was determined that the samples used in each assay were 
135 repeats for each video sequence mounted on the 
environment. To the test groups, the average values of 
delay, jitter, packet loss, and BLUR were computed for 
transmission. After the 135 transmissions, the average 
values for the variables were calculated, establishing a 
confidence interval for these values, with a significance 
level of 95%, achieving a margin of error depending on the 
average standard deviation of each variable examined and 
the sample size population under consideration. 
The blur metric values are shown through Figures 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. The details of the results of QoS 
metrics and blur metric are described in Tables III, IV, V, 
VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X. 
A. Group 1 (50 Kbps) 
In Figures 4 and 5, we can observe the values of the 
metric blur in the 135 transmissions performed for both 
video sequences, subject to the limitation 50Kbps. In this 
scenario, we can say that the network is in a situation poorly 
suited for performing multimedia streams, which reflects 
negatively on the values of delay, jitter, and loss shown in 
Tables III and IV. The average delay measured exceeded 
2000ms for both sequences.

The values of packet loss showed variation due to the 
characteristics of the video. The first sequence has a larger 
number of frames, which often change during transmission. 
So, the average loss was larger than the other sequence. 
This fact is observed by the four frames extracted, 
reflected in the averages of the metric without reference 
BLUR. By analyzing the blur metric, we conclude that the 
quality of streaming videos is unsatisfactory for any viewer. 
However, the sequence elephants_dream showed a worse 
state, as described by the blur metric value, which reached a 
maximum value of 0.8601 and an average of 0.8387, values 
nearly 10% higher than the other sequence. 
B. Group 2 (100 Kbps) 
In Figures 6 and 7, we can observe the values of the 
metric blur in the 135 transmissions performed for both 
video sequences, subject to the limitation 100Kbps. In this 
scenario, there were improvements in the conditions of the 
network, but not enough to assert that the state was suitable 
for performing multimedia streams. The average delay 
measured exceeded 1000ms for both sequences.

Again, the values of packet loss were higher in the 
sequence elephants_dream. The improved values of QoS 
metrics is not sufficient to promote a significant increase in 
the quality of the videos, which was adequately 
demonstrated by the metric blur. 
C. Group 3 (300 Kbps) 
In Figures 8 and 9, we can observe the values of the 
metric blur in the 135 transmissions performed for both 
video sequences, subject to the limitation 300Kbps. In this 
scenario, the packet loss in the network reduces to a value 
close to zero, since the video was encoded with bitrate 
300Kbits and therefore found better conditions for 
transmission. 
Thus, with the loss, the other variables network also 
decrease. We can see more clearly in the frames extracted 
from sequences, demonstrated in a value of blur metric, 
which showed lower averages compared to the first two 
groups. The highway sequence adapted better network 
conditions by having fewer frames and little variation 
between the images, showing an average of 0.6787 blur 
metric.

D. Group 4 (500 Kbps) 
In Figures 10 and 11, we can observe the values of the 
metric blur in the 135 transmissions performed for both 
video sequences, subject to the limitation 500Kbps. This 
scenario presents conditions much more suitable for video 
traffic on the network, significantly reducing the variable 
values of QoS. With the average delay and jitter less than 
15ms, packet loss reduces to a level very close to zero, 
reflecting as expected the blur metric and sharpness of the 
images taken. 
The highway sequence in this scenario presents values 
blur allowing qualify frames of videos as well sharp to the 
viewer. However, the elephants_dream sequence has higher 
average blur, demonstrating that the specific features of 
each video can cause variations in QoV metrics, even under 
identical conditions of traffic.

In order to check the impacts of network conditions on 
each variable used, Tables XI and XII show the assurance 
intervals for each parameter of the sample population. 
As can be observed, the variables delay, jitter, and loss 
exhibits values that vary depending of terms of limitation 
and traffic in network. The intervals of confidence show 
with clarity the differences between the Averages of each 
parameter for each video transmitted. 
We also conclude that the metrics without reference 
BLUR translates well the quality of a video transmitted in a 
network based on state of middle of transmission, visa that 
the same if showed sensitive to variations at the limitations 
and in incidence of traffic competitor ally to character 
specific of each sequence of video. 
V. 
PREDICTION MODELS OF BLUR METRIC 
Considering a linear relationship between the variables 
of QoS (delay, jitter, and packet loss) and the Blur metric, 
we consider a linear model of blur prediction expressed by 
equation (1). 
Y=b0+ b1.xj+ b2.xa+b3.xp 
(1) 
where, Y = Blur Estimated; 
b0 = Coeficient of adjustment linear; 
b1 = Coeficient of jitter; 
xj = Value average of jitter; 
b2 = Coeficient of delay; 
xa = Value average of delay; 
b3 = Coeficient of loss; 
xp = Value average of loss; 
 
With the goal of checking the degree of influence that 
each variable of QoS exercises about the blur metric, 
mathematical models were developed using multiple linear 
regression. As output, we obtain the estimate of blur in 
function of variables delay, jitter, and loss, using as input 
the values collected in the groups of experiments described 
in the previous session. Within this context, we consider 
that the variables of QoS act together and identify the state 
of the network, thus the thresholds of blur are dependent on 
these metrics. This is expressed through a linear system of 
equations into (2).

The coefficients b0, b1, b2, and b3 represent the impact 
that each variable of QoS exercises on result of blur metric 
and were obtained through the Gauss-Seidel iterative 
method [14] for solutions of linear equations, using k = 8 
iterations for each group of experiments. 
After the 8 iterations, 8 values for the coefficients were 
found; they were used in each of 4 groups, to estimate the 
values of blur. This form the 8 values of blur estimated for 
each

have 
more 
coefficient

determination. 
Thus, the coefficients that presented more coefficient of 
determination were the ones chosen to complete the model 
of prediction of blur.  
Using these models, it was possible to also determine 
equations of prediction generic independent of band 
limitation and network traffic for each video. For either, we 
obtained the averages of jitter, delay, loss, and blur for each 
group of experiments, and we apply over the results, the 
equations of prediction. Table XIII demonstrates the generic 
prediction equations for each video.

Therefore, according to the values of the QoS metrics, it 
is possible, by means of these general equations, to 
determine the degree of blurring the video sequence 
suffered during transmission. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The analysis of network quality is done using QoS 
metrics that describes, in practice, the current state of a 
computer network. These metrics (delay, jitter, and loss) are 
known well enough and used for purposes of determination 
of network overload. However, the values of QoS network 
variables don't shows a clear relationship with the quality of 
sequences multimedia transmitted over a computer network. 
The ideal method is the subjective test, that sets the 
quality of agreement with the opinion of spectators. 
However, to implement this model of analysis, it requires a 
high cost in terms of technological and human resources. 
The PSNR objective metrics to determine the video quality 
still have particularities that generate some inconsistency; 
therefore, they are not fully reliable metrics. 
In this context, we present a new prediction model for 
video quality, based on a no reference metrics, using blur 
estimate. We adapt and implement the metrics in a network 
environment, transmitting video sequences, in order to do 
several experiments that allowed to get information about 
the performance of metrics and analyze accordingly the data 
obtained. 
We can conclude, based on results described in this 
work, that the metrics no reference of blur determination, it 
is demonstrated be an efficient method of video quality 
prediction, presenting correlation indexes very good in 
relationship to QoS variables. Beside this, we notice that the 
metrics has a very low computational cost, allowing its use 
in 
network 
selection 
solutions 
without 
incremental 
computational cost to mobile devices.
