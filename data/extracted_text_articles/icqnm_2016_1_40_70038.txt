Abstract - The main objective of this paper is to determine the
process
of
formation
of
black
glasses
from
ladder-like
silsesquioxane precursors. Well-defined polysilsesquioxanes
with ladder-like structure obtained via the sol-gel process
allowed to control the amount of introduced carbon which
allows us to control the properties of received glasses. Raman
and middle infrared (MIR) spectroscopy research allowed to
determine the structure of obtained materials and thus, to
describe the process of formation of black glasses.
Keywords- silsesquioxanes; black glasess; SiOC.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Black glasses (SiOC glasses) are materials of amorphous
silica structure, in which two O2- ions are substituted by one
C4- anion (Figure 1). That type of substitution leads to a
local increase in the density of bonds and therefore to a
significant strengthening of the network. The ideal structure
of black glasses contains only Si-O and Si-C bonds.

oxycarbide (right) [1].
Unfortunately, the silica glass structure can accept only a
limited amount of carbon ions. Therefore, black glasses
usually also contain so called free carbon (phase separation)
- that is responsible for their black color.
The presence of free carbon and its structure has a
tremendous impact on the thermal stability and mechanical
properties of the glasses. Analysis of the literature shows
that functional parameters of black glasses may vary within
very wide limits, depending on the amount of free carbon
and isomorphous substitution in the glass structure [2]-[9].

EXPERIMENTAL
As it was mentioned, the main reason for the use of
ladder-like polysilsesquioxanes as precursors of black glass
was the need to ensure the stoichiometry of the glass. This
allows
to
control
the
amount
of
Si-C
bonds.
The
CH3Si(OCH3)3 (T units) and ((CH2Si(OC2H5)2) (D units)
were used as a silsesquioxane precursors. A mixture of
T/D=2/1 was hydrolyzed using water and HCl catalyst to
obtain ladder-like structures (P0). To obtain glassy SiCxOy,
dried samples were subsequently heat-treated in a tube
furnace at 200, 400, 600 and 800 oC temperature ranges.
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The temperatures for further studies were selected based
on thermogravimetric analysis (Figure 2). The first weight
loss was observed around 200oC (P1), the second at about
400oC (P2), the third at 600oC (P3) and the end at about
800oC (P4).
Figure. 2. Thermogravimetric (TG) curve of P0 sample
Spectroscopic studies (MIR and Raman) of samples (P0-
P4) show that the transition from xerogel into black glasses
(Figures 3 and 4). On MIR spectrum of P1, an increase in
intensity of bands responsible for C-H vibrations (857,
1270, 1409, 2910, 2969 cm-1) and the appearance of
additional bands in the range of approx. 3055 cm-1
(vibration CH sp2) and OH at 3693, 3756 cm-1 is observed.
This is most probably due to formation of D-oligomers [1].
As temperature increases (P2 - P4) a decrease in the
intensity of the bands associated with the CH groups can be
observed [10].

On Raman spectra (Figure 4), the so called G (at about 1615
cm-1) and D bands (P1-P4) characteristic for sp2 hybridized
carbon pairs and breathing of hexagonal carbon rings
respectively are visible. As temperature rises, an increase in
the intensity of the G band is observed. This is especially
visible for P3 (600 oC) and P4 (800 oC) samples.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, it has been shown that using ladder-like
silsesquioxanes, black glasses with different amount of free
carbon can be obtained. Spectroscopic studies showed that,
with the increase of temperature, free carbon phase starts to
form. Raman studies have shown that the process of
forming the carbon phase begins at about 600 °C.
