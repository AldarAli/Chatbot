Abstract—We report here a novel optical sensor technology 
which uses micro-lens as the sensor to perform real time 
monitoring of the Refractive Index (RI) of a solution, and the 
applications of the method in detecting the local concentration 
variation with time and temperature in inhomogeneous 
solutions.

 INTRODUCTION 
The 
concentration 
variations 
of 
solutions 
with 
temperature are important topics in biomedical research 
[1][2]. Since optical methods have the advantage of 
performing fast and accurate measurements without 
perturbation, they have been a powerful tool in measuring 
the refractive index of solutions [3][4]. Based on our 
previous RI detection method using microspheres [5], the 
present paper developed a new type of RI measurement 
technology which uses micro-lens for imaging and has 
higher precision to measure the local concentration variation 
in inhomogeneous solutions.

EXPERIMENT 
A. Principle 
As microsphere is RI sensor in inhomogeneous media [5], 
when a micro-lens is immersed in a liquid medium and 
illuminated by a parallel light propagating along its optical 
axis, a dark ring appears in the image of the micro-lens if 
there is a difference between the refractive index of the 
micro-lens n2 and the refractive index of the surrounding 
medium n1, as shown in Figure 1. Therefore, by using a 
micro-lens with known refractive index n2 and measuring the 
ratio X (r/R) from the image of the micro-lens, one can easily 
determine the refractive index n1 of its surrounding medium 
with the following equation (length of the micro-lens is 2.5 
folds of radius):

micro-lens immersed in solution. 
B. Setup of the measurement 
The measuring setup is shown in Figure 1. The parallel 
light from a LED light source is incident to the microsphere 
which was immersed in the target micro-region of an 
inhomogeneous solution, and the image of the micro-lens 
was taken by a CCD camera via a 40 objective. The r and R 
values of the micro-lens’ image were measured using a 
homemade image processing software with a calibrated scale.

respectively. 
Figure 2 shows a setup of using micro-lenses to monitor 
the variations of local solution concentrations in micro-
regions within a cell-culturing pool. The micro-lenses P1 and 
P2 were 50 m in diameterandthey were separated by a 
distance of 200 m. A constant-flow pump perfused normal 
saline into the pool. Figure 3 illustrates the variations of the 
refractive indices and the mole fraction (M) of the normal 
saline with time at the two micro-regions monitored by P1 
and P2, respectively; it gives detailed information about the 
dynamic process of the diffusion. We can see that though the 
two micro-regions were just separated by a small distance of 
200 m, their normal saline concentrations were slightly 
different and had different rates of incensement. Since the 
micro-lens sensor was demonstrated to be able to detect 
refractive index change to as small as 10-5 or even to 10-6, it 
has high resolution power to distinguish small changes in 
concentration. Its small size also enables it to identify the 
slight differences of concentration in the micro-regions 
separated by distance as small as ~100 m.  
By placing a silica microsphere beside the micro-lenses 
P1 and P2 as the sensor of the local temperature, we could 
determine the real-time local temperature variation. By this 
means, we obtained the refractive index variations of NaCl 
as a function of both concentration and temperature, as 
shown in Figure 4. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In summary, we have developed a micro-lens imaging 
method for measuring the liquid RI. It can measure trace 
liquid RI accurately, and monitor the instantaneous 
concentration variation in different micro regions. Since the 
refractive index of a solution is a function of the solute 
concentration and temperature [6], by using our method, 
micro-lens can be considered as sensitive and accurate 
sensors for monitoring concentration and temperature 
variations in different regions within an inhomogeneous 
solution.
