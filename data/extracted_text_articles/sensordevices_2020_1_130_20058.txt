Abstract—A dual-band low cost antenna for Industrial, 
scientific and medical (ISM) applications with circular 
polarization at 5.8 GHz is presented. The proposed antenna is 
excited through a single feed line connected to the patch. Two 
omni-directional radiation patterns are obtained for the two 
ISM bands. The proposed antenna is patterned on an RF30 
rectangular dielectric (28 mm x 40 mm) with 1.52 mm 
thickness. The antenna exhibits a super-wide frequency 
bandwidth from 5.4 GHz to 6.4 GHz centered at 5.8 GHz, and 
0.5 GHz bandwidth for the first resonance frequency, centered 
at 2.4 GHz. An improvement in return loss has been obtained 
by 
introducing 
a 
Coplanar 
Waveguide 
(CPW) 
feed 
implemented in Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) 
technology. A prototype antenna is fabricated using standard 
PCB fabrication. Measured results show a good agreement 
between simulation and measured results.

 INTRODUCTION  
ISM-band antennas are a crucial component in sensor 
nodes, used for high quality data transmission in wireless 
sensor networks. A dual-band antenna made on a simple 
planar layer has the flexibility and simplicity required to be 
integrated into chemical sensors, operating at infrared 
wavelengths [1]. In previous years, researchers have been 
interested in developing the called Substrate-Integrated 
Waveguide (SIW) [2], a simple technology compatible with 
planar circuits with ease of integration with other 
components, thus with characteristics that can improve the 
performance or packaging of RF circuits. The SIW 
technology is compatible with rectangular waveguides and 
microstrip or CPW technology. SIW planar technology 
involves simple PCB fabrication techniques and has been 
used for ISM band applications [3]-[5]. Many passive 
circuits have been developed using SIW technology [6]-
[10]. Highlighting antenna development, several multiband 
antennas have been presented in previous years for specific 
applications. In [11], an antenna for MIMO application 
works at a single frequency with two different modes of 
operation. A multiband multimode antenna can be found in 
[12]; the antenna design has a circular patch on the top of 
the structure, where a SIW cavity is used for the outer 
antenna, and includes a perpendicularly placed connector. 
The antenna has a degraded gain for the TM02 first mode 
and a high gain for other modes.  A dual-band antenna 
working in the ISM band with low profile for body centric 
communications is presented in [13]; the antenna has low 
gain for the first band with an omnidirectional radiation 
pattern and an unidirectional radiation pattern for the second 
resonance frequency. The antenna uses two connectors 
perpendicular to the top patch. 
In this paper, a planar dual-band antenna fabricated on a 
single layer of dielectric material is described in section II. 
The antenna includes a microstrip line and ground plane as 
shown in Figure 1. The proposed ISM antenna is used for 
wireless sensor data transmission. The two antenna 
frequency bands of operation can be independently tuned as 
discussed in section III, by adjusting the microstrip line 
dimension parameters, and the width of the ground plane. 
The measurement and simulation results are presented in 
section IV. Finally, section V provides a conclusion for this 
work.  
II. 
PROPOSED ISM ANTENNA STRUCTURE 
The proposed antenna with and without CPW-SIW 
technology is composed of micro-strip lines patches, as 
shown in Figure 1. The designs can be connected using a 
simple SMA connector attached to the substrate side. The 
microstrip line is designed to resonate at the frequencies of 
2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz, as shown in Figure 2. RF30 material 
is used as the substrate, with a dielectric constant value of 
3.35, loss tangent of 0.001, and substrate thickness of 
h=1.52 mm. The design of the microstrip patches is based 
on conventional theory. The width and length of the patch 
were calculated using the following standard expression 
[14].

The proposed antenna is made on a sheet of low 
permittivity substrate with dimensions 28mm x 40mm x 
1.52mm. Table I summarizes the design parameter value 
used to produce the antenna. In this paper, a single layer 
structure, with simple side interface with the connector is 
used. The proposed antenna involves microstrip lines, 
coplanar waveguide (CPW) and SIW technology. The 
bottom ground plane dimension must also be carefully taken 
into account to provide the desired band of operation.

The bandwidth enhancement technique and the VSWR 
results are demonstrated in the following section. The 
impedance matching at 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands can be 
adjusted with the proposed structure, which was found to be 
effective in obtaining a high impedance bandwidth in the 
antenna's upper operating band. 
III. 
RESUSLTS AND DISCUISSON 
In this part, an initial proposed antenna has been simulated 
and compared with the CPW-SIW technology antenna.  
A. Initial design  
The proposed antenna is simulated using CST 
commercial software; CST software is based on the integral 
method (FDTD). Figure 2 shows a comparison between 
simulated results using the proposed antenna with and 
without using CPW-SIW. The dimensions of the microstrip 
radiating conductors and the ground plane in the bottom part 
of the antenna are shown in Figure 1.  
Through numerical analysis, the reflection coefficient 
in the ISM bands in minimized, while the reflection 
coefficient is maximized elsewhere. According to the result 
in Figure 2, an improvement is obtained when the CPW-
SIW structure is introduced. The VSWR is below 3 dB for 
the two ISM bands, centered at 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz. 
Figure 2 and Figure 3 show an improvement in results 
between the two antennas, according to the S-parameters 
and VSWR, obtained. From the simulation results of 
Figures 2 and 3, an impedance bandwidth with |S11| < −10 
dB is obtained, with ranges from 2.2 to 2.9 GHz (30%) and 
5.2 to 6.8 GHz (80%), where 19% VSWR is achieved. Fig.4 
shows the improvement obtained when inducing the CPW-
SIW structure  in terms of radiation pattern at 2.4 GHz and 
5.8 GHz. The maximum gain of the proposed antenna is 
approximately 3.4dB.  The simulated spinning linear 
radiation patterns in two orthogonal planes (xoy and yoz) 
for the two resonance frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz 
are plotted in Figure 4, respectively.  
The radiation pattern shows an improvement when the 
CPW-SIW technology is used, with an omnidirectional 
radiation pattern at 2.4 GHz and an unidirectional one at 5.8 
GHz.

B. Band tuning technique analysis. 
Although the precedent design resonates at 2.4 GHz 
and 5.8 GHz exactly, the resonant frequencies are not 
independently tunable. A dual-band and dual-mode antenna 
is attractive and very useful when a single band frequency 
can be tuned to the desired frequency of specific 
applications, while keeping the other band fixed.

Figure 6.  Reflexion coefficient versus W2. 
In this paper, to independently tune the resonant milti-
band frequencies of the antenna, design parameters  are 
varied as follows. Lf  and W2 are the most important 
parameters for frequency tuning. Figure 5 shows the 
different reflection coefficients vs Lf parameters. This result 
illustrates that the two bands can be tuned at the same time, 
so it is not reasonable to adjust the two bands at once. On 
the other hand, we can tune the high resonance frequency 
(5.8GHz), where W2 can be adjusted to modify the second 
resonance frequency. Figure 6 showns the reflection 
coefficient versus frequency for different W2 parameters. 
Figure 5 and Figure 6 contain the reflection coefficients 
versus Lf and W2 parameters, respectively. Increasing the 
parameters produces decreased resonance frequencies. 
While, increasing W2 provides modifying the sencond

EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
The proposed ISM antenna is simulated using CST 
studio software, based on FDTD method (integral method). 
The antenna was mesured in the frequency range from 2 to 6 
GHz. SIW technology is used with vias having a diameter of 
1.2 mm. The diameter of the vias hole at the microstrip line 
defining the antenna is 1.4 mm. The antenna prototype is 
fabricated and measured in an anechoic chamber after 
optimization performed through simulations. A photograph 
of the antenna top side is shown in Figure 8.

view 
The simulated and measured reflection coefficient 
results are shown in Figure 9. The measured and simulated 
results show a good agreement, except for slight frequency 
shift at 5.8 GHz, which may be caused to the probe-feed 
position after fabrication, fabrication tolerances and 
soldering. The measured relative bandwidth for the first 
mode is 500 MHz. At 5.8 GHz, the bandwidth is 1000 MHz 
bandwidth. The bandwidths of operation are 8% and 20% at 
2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz, respectively. The simulated antenna 
gains are about 2.71 dB and 3.43 dB at 2.4 GHz and 5.8 
GHz, respectively. Antenna radiation patterns are shown in 
Figure 10, corresponding to the frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 
5.8 GHz. The antenna radiation patterns results show 
agreement between measurement and simulation, obtained 
for the two antenna bands of operation. For antenna 
measurements, an extended ground plane was used using 
copper tape.

second resonant mode. Figure 7 showns the axial ratio for 
the frequency range from 5.4 to 6.1 GHz.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a circular polarization, dual-band antenna 
for ISM band is reported. An improvement is achieved when 
using a coplanar waveguide at the input feed including an 
SIW structure. The CPW-SIW structure improves the 
antenna response S-parameters and gain. To be able to use 
this design for sensor networks, the proposed dual-band 
design can be independently tuned in frequency and 
bandwidth of operation. The planar antenna structure and its 
performance makes it a suitable candidate for integration 
with ISM applications and sensor nodes.
