Abstract—The European Monetary Union (EMU) is a result of 
an economic integration of European Union member states 
into a unified economic system. The literature is divided on 
whether the EMU members benefit from this monetary 
unification. Considering costs and benefits, a fiscal authority 
may ask whether it is a good decision to join the EMU.  We 
introduce and develop a decision support system to answer the 
proposed question using a historical dataset of twelve 
Macroeconomic Outcomes (MOs) obtained for 31 European 
countries and for 18 years (1999-2016).  The system meets the 
three-prong goal of: (1) identifying highly relevant MOs for a 
given year, yi, using the data from years y1 to yi; (2) deriving 
decision of “join/not-join” the EMU along with its certainty 
factor using the relevant MOs for yi; and (3) examining the 
accuracy of the derived decision using the data from yi+1 to y18. 
The performance analysis of the system reveals that (a) the 
number of relevant MOs has declined nonlinearly over time, 
(b) the relevant MOs and decisions are significantly changed 
before and after the European debt crisis, and (c) the derived 
decisions by the system has 79% accuracy.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The European Monetary Union (EMU) is an agreement 
among the European countries to join together for creating 
one functioning monetary system with one currency. The 
idea of the EMU was given by the European Council in the 
Dutch city of Maastricht in December of 1991. Later the 
formation of this union was declared in the Treaty on 
European Union or as it is better known the Maastricht 
Treaty (1992).  In January of 1999, eleven countries adopted 
the single currency—euro.  For joining the European 
Monetary Union, a country must adhere to the following 
entry conditions: price stability, sound and sustainable 
public finances, durability of interest rate convergence, and 
exchange rate stability.  
 
The advantages of joining the EMU have been 
enumerated by many sources including the European central 
bank that is in charge of stabilizing inflation by 
implementing a common monetary policy across the 
Eurozone [1].  Rogers [2] has shown that joining the EMU 
leads to more stable prices. Alesina and Barro [3] and also 
Frankel and Rose [4] have indicated that the trade costs 
among European countries have reduced and the credibility 
of monetary policy has enhanced.  Kim et al. [5] and also 
Bernoth et al. [6] have claimed separately that the members 
have experienced a lower default risk premium. (Risk 
premium is defined as the spread between member's yield 
and the yield on the German Bund).  Rose and Engle [7] 
have empirically shown that due to the trade volume, the 
volatility of exchange rate has declined in the Eurozone. 
 
However, the disadvantages of joining the EMU have 
also been enumerated by many resources.  Feldstein [8] 
expresses that the loss of monetary independence of the 
members is counted as one of the major disadvantages. 
Codongo et al. [9] have argued that credit risk has been 
greater in the euro area.  After the European Sovereign Debt 
Crisis started in 2009, the disadvantages were more 
pronounced: Government debt increased due to massive tax 
cuts and increase in the government spending [10][11].  
Banking crises became evident among some members that 
led to deep and prolonged asset market collapses associating 
with declines in total output measured by Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) [12][13]. 
 
Considering the advantages and disadvantages of 
joining the EMU, a fiscal authority may ask: is it a good 
decision to join the EMU.  We try to answer the proposed 
question using historical Macroeconomic Outcomes (MOs) 
obtained for 31 European countries and for 18 years [1999-
2016].  The binary attribute of membership divides the 31 
countries into two groups of member and non-member of 
the EMU.  For a given year, yi, the curtailed historical data 
will include all the records from year 1999 up to year yi (yi 
year data is not included.)   
 
The goal of this research effort has three prongs: (1) 
Identifying the highly relevant MOs to the membership 
attribute for a given year, yi, using the curtailed historical 
data for the year, (2) Deriving a decision of “join/not-join” 
the EMU along with a certainty factor, at the year yi using 
the relevant attributes, and (3) Examining the accuracy of 
the derived decision by assessing the behavior of the MOs

of those countries that joined the EMU at year yi for the 
years of yi to y2016. 
 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The 
Previous Works is the subject of Section 2.  The 
Methodology is presented in Section 3.  The Empirical 
Results are covered in Section 4. The Conclusions and 
Future Research are covered in Section 5. 
II. 
PREVIOUS WORKS 
 
The literature presents a body of work for determining 
whether membership in the EMU is beneficial using MOs.   
Frankel and Rose have used trade volume and GDP (two 
MOs) to find the effects of monetary unification [4].  They 
applied a two-stage approach to the problem.  In the first 
stage, trade between any two countries was estimated using 
a gravity model.  In the second stage, the Ordinary Least 
Squares method was used to find how joining the EMU 
affects trade and GDP. Gomez-puig tested the existence of 
causal relationships between the bond yield and government 
debt and joining the EMU [14]. The Granger’s causality test 
was used which is based on the concept of the causal 
ordering.  The causal relationship was estimated using the 
first difference and lagged variables regression.  Rose and 
Engle used a linear regression model to determine whether 
the MOs of openness, exchange rates, and price integration 
statistically changed within the EMU members compared to 
the non-EMU members [7]. Codongo et al. [9] and Bhatt et 
al. [15] separately and by different methodologies have 
determined the effects of joining the EMU on yield and 
yield spread as two MOs. 
 
In all reported studies, the number of MOs used is 
limited and extremely small.  However, we use a large set of 
MOs (twelve of them) and that is the major point of 
departure from the similar works reported in literature.   As 
the second point of departure, we consider our dataset as a 
snapshot of the twelve MOs at a point in time and then we 
say knowing what we know from the snapshot, is it 
advisable to join the EMU. In addition we verify the 
accuracy of the advice.     
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
 
Let D be a dataset with N independent attributes of A1, . 
. ., An and one dependent attribute of E. As a preprocessing 
step, we keep only one copy of the attributes that are 
correlated.  The Pearson method is used to compute the 
correlation coefficients among every two attributes, Ai, Aj 
using formula (1) 
𝜌𝐴𝑖,𝐴𝑗 =
𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝐴𝑖,𝐴𝑗)
𝜎𝐴𝑖,𝜎𝐴𝑗
  
 
(1) 
Where, 𝜌𝐴𝑖,𝐴𝑗 denotes the Pearson coefficient. 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝐴𝑖, 𝐴𝑗) is 
the covariance and 𝜎𝐴𝑖, 𝜎𝐴𝑗 are the standard deviations. The 
correlation test calculates the 𝑆-statistics defined by 
𝑆 = (𝑛3 − 𝑛)
1−𝜌𝐴𝑖,𝐴𝑗
6
  
 
(2) 
Where, 𝑛 is the sample size. The 𝑆-statistics is compared to 
its critical value to reject the null hypothesis of no 
correlation between the two attributes. 
 
The details of the methodology for meeting the three 
prongs of the goal are covered in the following three 
subsections 
A. 
Identifying the Most Relevant Attributes 
 
The first sub-goal is to identify the relevant attributes 
among the independent attributes of (A1 . . . An) that are 
indicative of E (the dependent variable in dataset D).  We 
assume the possible values for E are d1, . . ., dg.  To meet 
this sub-goal, we use the Naïve Bayesian classification 
approach which is encapsulated as follows. 
 
Let r be a new record with (A1 . . . An) attributes for 
which a predicted value of E is sought using D as a training 
set.  The predicted value of E for r is determined by the 
highest probability amongst P(E=dj | r), for j = 1 to g.  The 
P(E=dj | r) is defined by formulas (3): 
𝑃(𝐸 = 𝑑𝑗 | 𝑟) =
𝑝(𝐸=𝑑𝑗) ∏
𝑝(𝐴𝑖=𝑣 |𝐸=𝑑𝑗)
𝑛
𝑖=1
𝑝(𝑟)
  
 
(3) 
Since the denominator is the same for all probabilities of 
𝑃(𝐸 = 𝑑𝑗 | 𝑟), we need to calculate only the numerator. 
 
Two algorithms Core (Fig. 1) and Relevant (Fig. 2) are 
used for determining the relevance degree of each 
independent attribute in reference to the dependent attribute.  
The Core algorithm accepts a dataset  with k attributes of 
A1, . . ., Ak as independent variables and the binary attribute 
of Z as dependent variable.   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  The Algorithm Core 
 
Core algorithm: (a) treats every record of the dataset , 
individually,  as a test set of one record while treating the 
remaining records as a training set (Steps 1 and 2), (b) 
Algorithm Core (, se, sp ) 
Given: Dataset  with independent attributes of  
(A1, . . ., Ak) and a binary dependent 
attribute of Z. S1 and S2 that are the set of 
all the record numbers in  with Z = 1 and 
Z =0, respectively.  
Objective: Predict the Z value for every record in 
 and return sensitivity (se) and specificity 
(sp) for the overall prediction.  
Method: 
  Step1- Repeat for each record, rj, in  and in 
presence of the rest of the records 
     Step2- Treat rj as the test set and -rj as the 
training set; 
 
Step3- Apply the Naïve Bayesian classification 
to predict a Z value for rj;  
  End; 
Step4-  W1 and W2 that are the set of all the 
record numbers in  with predicted 
values of Z = 1 and Z =0, respectively.  
Step5-  se = |S1W1|/|S1|; 
 
sp = |S2W2|/|S2| ; 
 
Return (se, sp);

applies the Naïve Bayesian classifiers to predict the Z value 
for the record in the test set (Step3), (c) upon completion of 
predicting a Z value for every record in , Core algorithm 
returns sensitivity and specificity of the classification as two 
parameters of se = T1/(T1+F0) and sp = T0/(T0+F1), where T1 
and T0 are the number of records that truly predicted 1 and 
0, respectively. F1 and F0 are the number of records that 
falsely predicted 1 and 0, respectively (Step5). 
 
To explain the algorithm Relevant, the dataset D which 
is similar to dataset  and has n attributes of A1 . . . An is 
given.  Let us make n subsets out of dataset D, (D1, . . ., Dn), 
such that Di is composed of the attribute Ai and a copy of 
the attribute Z (Steps 1 and 2.)  Let us also apply Core 
algorithm on each subset, Di, separately and calculate sei 
and spi, (Step 3.) The prediction of Z values by Ai is as good 
as i = Min (sei, spi), (Step4).  Therefore, we consider i as 
the relevancy measure of Ai to Z (named the relevance 
degree of Ai in reference to Z.)  The Relevant algorithm 
delivers a list of attributes and their corresponding relevance 
degrees such that each relevance degree in the list is greater 
than a given threshold (Step 5.)  The list is the response to 
the first sub-goal.

B. 
 Deriving a Decision 
 
Considering the dataset D given above and the outcome 
of the algorithm Relevant, deriving a decision is completed 
in three stages. In the first stage, a subset of D is chosen, Dr, 
that includes only the relevant attributes obtained from RD 
along with a copy of Z 
 
In the second stage, the matrix RD is sorted in 
descending order of the relevance degree values and the 
attribute in the top row of matrix RD is selected as the seed, 
As.  The attribute As is used as a root of a search tree with q-
1 branches at the first level, where q is the number of the 
relevant attributes in Dr, as shown in Fig. 3. 
 
To minimize the cost of building the search tree, we 
apply a filtering process at each level of the tree such that 
only the best leaf survives.  Through the filtering process, 
“tie” cases may happen in selecting a node for expansion.   
Such cases are resolved by randomly choosing one node 
among the tied nodes.   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  A search tree: The winner node at each level is designated by an 
oval shape and there is not any winner node at the last level 
 
To explain it further, the i-th leaf of the first level is a 
projection of Dr over the Z, root of its subtree, and the 
attribute Ai (Ai cannot be the same as the root of its subtree.)  
Only one leaf from the first level is chosen as the winner 
and expanded (the condition for being a winner node are 
introduced shortly.)  In the second level there are q-2 
branches from the winner node of the first level.  The j-th 
leaf of the second level is a projection of Dr over the Z, 
attributes in the path from the root to the winner node, and 
the attribute Aj (Aj is not the root of any subtree.)  This 
process continues until the subtree cannot be expanded 
either because all the attributes in Dr are exhausted or there 
is not any winner node in the current level. Reader needs to 
be reminded that each node of the search tree has its own 
dataset which is a subset of the dataset Dr.  Selecting a node 
as the winner of a given level is done by taking the 
following steps: 
a. The Core algorithm is applied on each one of the 
node’s datasets separately to obtain sensitivity and 
specificity, and relevance degree for the dataset. 
b. The winner node is the one with the highest relevance 
degree among the nodes’ datasets and it is greater than 
a set threshold.  
Algorithm Relevant  
Given: Dataset D with independent attributes of  
(A1 . . . An) and a binary dependent attribute 
of Z. A Relevance Degree matrix, RD, of 
the size n X 2. A threshold value of Tv. 
Objective: 
Determining 
the 
most 
relevant 
independent attributes to Z. 
Method: 
  Step1- Repeat for every attribute, Ai, in D. 
  Step2- Di is the projection of D over attributes 
of (Ai, Z);  
  Step3- Invoke Core(Di, sei, spi); 
     Step4- i = Min (sei, spi).  
  Step5-  If (i >Tv)  
 
   Then Insert the pair of (Ai, i) into RD.

The search tree delivers the most relevant attributes to the 
attribute Z which is considered feature extraction from D.  
 
In the third stage, the last winner node of the search tree 
with sensitivity of sel and specificity of spl is examined one 
more time.  If (sel > spl ) it means the node’s dataset more 
reflects those countries that are members of the EMU.  
Therefore, the suggested decision by the system is “join”. 
Using the same argument, if (sel < spl ) then the suggested 
decision is “Not-Join”.  In the case that (sel = spl), the 
weighted average (WA) for all the records in the winner 
node’s dataset with Z =0 and Z =1 are calculated separately.   
 
If (WA1 > WA0) Then decision is “join” 
 
If (WA1 < WA0) Then decision is “not-join” 
 
If (WA1 = WA0) Then no decision can be made. 
 
A certainty factor, CF, (0  CF  1) is associated with 
any driven decision, which simply expresses the level of 
confidence that the decision support system has in the 
suggested decision.  A higher value for CF means higher 
confidence in the decision. The CF is simply the average of 
sensitivity and specificity for last winner node.  
C. 
Examining the Derived Decision 
 
We examine the accuracy of the derived decision for a 
given year, yi, by (a) identifying those countries that joined 
the EMU at year yi, (b) assessing the behavior of their MOs 
for years of yi to y18, in reference to the average of their 
MOs behavior prior to joining the EMU, and (c) 
determining whether the assessment results support the 
derived decision.  The assessing process is done by 
performing a trend analysis which is encapsulated as 
follows:  
 
Let C = {Ca, . . ., Cp} be a set of countries that joined 
the EMU at year yi and {A1, . . ., An} be the set of attributes 
(MOs) that are the same for every country, Cj, in C. Let also 
Gi-1 be the set of the average values for each one of the n 
attributes of Cj from year 1 to year yi-1,  Gi-1 = {(𝑔1
𝑖−1, .  .  .,
𝑔𝑛
𝑖−1), that is used as the baseline during the trend analysis.  
In addition, let the values for the n attributes of Cj for the kth 
year after yi be (𝑣1
𝑖+𝑘 , .  .  ., 𝑣𝑛
𝑖+𝑘.)  The trend of attribute 
Am for the year i+k is denoted by Trend(𝐴𝑚
𝑖+𝑘) and it is 
computed by formula (4).   
𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑(𝐴𝑚
𝑖+𝑘) =
𝑣𝑚
𝑖+𝑘− 𝑔𝑚
𝑖−1
𝑔𝑚
𝑖−1
∗ 100 
 
(4) 
The overall trend of Am for the period of q years for Cj is: 
𝑜𝑡(𝐴𝑚
𝑞 )𝐶𝑗 =
∑ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑(𝐴𝑚
𝑖+𝑞)
𝑞
𝑖
𝑞
   
 
(5)  
For the same period, the overall trend of Am for the 
countries in C, OTC, is: 
  𝑜𝑡𝑐(𝐴𝑚
𝑞 ) =
∑ 𝑜𝑡(𝐴𝑚
𝑞 )𝐶𝑎
𝑝
𝑎
|𝐶|
  
 
(6) 
The interpretation of the 𝑜𝑡𝑐(𝐴𝑚
𝑞 ) value depends on the 
nature of the attribute.  For example, a negative overall 
trend value for the attribute “inflation” is considered an 
improvement whereas a negative trend value for GDP is 
considered deterioration.  The same can be argued for a 
positive value.  Table 1 is used to remove the duplicity of 
the interpretation.  As a result, a positive/negative trend 
value is considered an improvement/deterioration trend, for 
any attribute, respectively. 
 
The formula (6) delivers the overall trend for attribute 
Am (m=1 to n) for a period of q years considering all 
countries in C.  The overall trend for the countries in C 
given all the attributes and for the same period of q is 
calculated using formula (7). 
 
𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑(𝐶) =
∑
𝑂𝐶𝑇(𝐴𝑚
𝑞 )∗𝑚
𝑛𝑚=1
𝑛
 
 
(7) 
 
Where, 𝑂𝐶𝑇(𝐴𝑚
𝑞 ) is the 𝑜𝑐𝑡(𝐴𝑚
𝑞 ) after its duplicity 
removed, m is the average of the relevance degrees of the 
attribute Am for the period of q years and for all the 
countries in C.

The architecture of the Mining Driven Decision 
Support System is summarized as a collection of three major 
modules: Feature Extractor, Decision Driver, and Trend 
Analyzer, Fig. 4.  The dataset D goes to a pre-processing 
step to be cleaned and a subset of D is selected, Y, for years 
in the range of [1- y) which includes those countries that 
were adopted into the Eurozone in year y.  The feature 
extractor module accepts Y as input.  The module extracts a 
subset, K, of the attributes in D such that the K attributes are 
highly relevant to the dependent variable Z for the years of 
[1- y).  The extraction is done by applying the algorithm 
Core, algorithm Relevant, and creation of search tree.  The 
outcome of the module helps to make two different 
projections of D over the K attributes, Y’ and Y”, for the 
years [1-y) and [y+1, 18], respectively.   
 
The decision Driver Module accepts the Y’ as the input 
dataset and, in reference to Z, calculates the sensitivity (se) 
and specificity (sp) for Y’ using a naïve Bayesian approach. 
A decision of “join” or “not-join” is suggested by the 
module using the values for se and sp.  
 
The trend analyzer module accepts the dataset Y” and 
delivers an overall trend of the behavior of MOs for the 
countries (adopted into the EMU in year y) during the years 
of [y, 18]. The support of the overall trend for the suggested 
decision is used to confirm the validity of the suggested 
decision.  
IV. 
EMPIRICAL RESULTS 
 
Currently, the European Union consists of 31 members 
of which 19 countries have adopted the euro, Table 2.  The 
Master Dataset used has the measurements of twelve MOs 
for every country in Table 2 and for the duration of 1999-
2016.  The short and expanded names of the MOs in the 
Master Dataset are given in Table 3.

Figure 4. The architecture of the Mining Driven Decision Support System 
 
Table 2 has eight unique adoption dates for the current 
members of the EMU (1999, 2001, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 
2014, and 2015.)  We divided the Master Dataset into eight 
triplets of new datasets as follows (Y99, Y’99, Y”99), (Y00, 
Y’00, Y”00), (Y06, Y’06, Y”06), (Y07, Y’07, Y” 07), (Y08, Y’08, 
Y” 08), (Y10, Y’10, Y” 10), (Y13, Y’13, Y” 13), and (Y14, Y’14, 
Y” 14.)  The dataset Yi (i  99) held only those records of the 
Master Dataset for which the adopted year is i+1. The 
reason for choosing data up to one year prior to each one of 
the eight-unique adoption dates stems from the fact that we 
assume the decision of “join” or “not-join” is based on the 
historical data prior to the date of adoption.  For the year 
1999, however, there is no prior data and as a remedy we 
use the data for year 1999 itself as the historical data.

In addition, two attributes of Treat and Year were added 
to the Master Dataset to reflect the membership of the 
country in the EMU and the year for which data was 
collected, respectively.  The Treat was a binary attribute 
where the values of zero and one for a country meant 
“member” and “non-member” of the EMU, respectively. 
The Year values were 1 to 18, where value = 1 means year 
1999 and value = 18 means year 2016.  The total number of 
records was 31 * 18 = 558. The MOs were considered as 
independent variables and the Treat attribute was considered 
as the dependent attribute.

The dataset Y’i held only those records of Yi that were 
non-members but became members in the year i+1, and Y”i 
held only those records of the Master Dataset for which the 
year values  i and country names were the same as the ones 
in Y’i.   
 
For a triplet of (Yi, Y’i, Y”i), the dataset Yi was used to 
determine the relevant attributes and derive the decision of 
“join/not-join” along with its certainty factor.  The dataset 
Y’i was used to provide a baseline for the trend analysis and 
Y”i was used to study the trends in reference to the baseline.

The following process was repeated for each triplet of 
(Yi, Y’i, Y”i). (This means the process repeated only for 
those years that one or more countries joined the EMU.): 
Step1: Correlated attributes in Yi were identified and from 
each group of correlated attributes only one attribute 
remained in Yi (generating a cleaned Yi.)  The 
maximum calculated correlation among any two 
MOs was 0.3.  Therefore, none of the MOs was 
dismissed.   
Step2: The cleaned Yi was used to identify the most relevant 
independent attributes of Yi with regard to 
dependent attribute, Treat (using the Relevant 
algorithm) and the rest of the independent attributes 
were dismissed (generating a scrubbed Yi.) 
Step3:  The independent attributes in Y’i and Y”i that were 
not found in the scrubbed Yi were removed. A 
baseline was established using Y’i by averaging the 
values for each attribute separately.  
Step4: A decision of “join/not-join” was derived from 
scrubbed Yi using the relevant attributes and the 
search tree outcome.  The certainty factor for each 
decision was also calculated. 
Step5: The derived decision for Yi was considered as the 
derived decision for the countries C = {Ca, . . ., Cp} 
joining the EMU at the year Yi+1. The Y’i was used 
as a baseline to verify the accuracy of the derived 
decision using overall trend for C in Y”i. 
 
In reference to the first sub-goal of the research, the list 
and rank of the relevant MOs produced by Step 2 of the 
process are shown in Table 4.  (Rank of an MO is its 
importance to the derived decision and Rank equal to 1 is 
the highest rank.) The derived decisions along with the 
certainty factor produced by Step 4 of the process were also 
shown in Table 4.

The trend analysis delivered by Step 5 of the process is 
shown in Table 5 in which the improvement/deterioration of 
the overall trend of the MOs were expressed by the 
notations of (+)/(), respectively.  The overall trend of (+) 
and the derived decision of “join” are in agreement and so 
the overall trend of () and derived decision of “not-join”.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
 
The same procedure may be applied to only one of the 
countries for a given date of adoption as long as Y’i and Y”i 
include the past and ongoing economic performance of that 
one country.  It is also true that the same procedure may be 
applied for any given year, but it is not necessary. To 
explain it further, the purpose is to compare the past and 
ongoing economic performance of a given country (captured 
in two datasets of Y’i and Y”i.) If the year i be any year 
then, the comparison of the two datasets Y’i and Y”i does 
not have any meaning.  Therefore, framing the past and 
ongoing economic performance into the years of (1999-i) 
and (i+1- 2016) is relevant as well as adequate.  As another 
point of clarification, the time(year)-lag effects are not the 
same over all MOs.  We use the first lag for all MOs except 
bndyld, and volatility attributes (bndvol, gdpvol, pivol, and 
spreadvol.) The reason for using the first lag is that 
economic theories suggest that today’s decisions by central 
banks are made with a one-period lag. This is not true for 
volatility variables and bndyld.  Readers need to be 
reminded that our study is a longitudinal framework, which 
includes time (year) and unit (country).   
 
The findings for our decision support system were 
presented in Tables 4 and 5.  Table 4 indicates the relevant 
MOs for the years prior to the adoption dates and the 
derived decisions. The relevance of MOs has changed over 
time. A greater set of MOs determines whether the country 
must join the EMU for the years closer to the introduction 
of the euro, 1999. As time goes on, the relevant MOs set 
shrinks nonlinearly. For the years before the European 
sovereign debt crisis the MOs of, spreadvol, spread, lrmg, 
and lrer play significant roles in the decision making 
process; however, after the crisis other outcomes such as 
lopen, ldebt, bndvol, and pivol become pertinent.  
 
The MO of lrer is the only one that was identified as the 
relevant attribute in all Yi datasets. One possible reason is 
that the EMU members link their currency to the euro which 
protects them from currency fluctuations. This linkage 
makes the lrer a significant factor for all the samples. The 
MOs, bndyeld and lspread identified as relevant only for 
countries that joined the EMU prior to 2009. The reason 
stems from the fact that bond yield convergence is one of 
the goals of monetary unification and members had

benefited from joining the EMU through the bond yield 
channel [16]. However, the bond yields have reduced to 
nearly zero after the crisis due to expansionary monetary 
policy. Thus, the bond market attributes have become 
irrelevant in the post crisis era. In contrast, lopen was 
observed as a relevant MO for only countries that joined the 
EMU subsequent to 2009.  The attempt of the EMU 
members to overcome the turmoil of the banking crisis by 
increasing trade within the monetary union was completely 
aligned with the observation of lopen as a relevant MO.  
 
The derived decision is “join” for the year 1999 when 
11 countries adopted the euro corroborating evidence that it 
is beneficial to join at the beginning of the European 
monetary union. However, the findings reveal that the 
decisions made by European countries to “join” the EMU in 
adoption dates of 2001, 2007, and 2008 (years prior to 
crisis), are not beneficial.  In contrast, the findings provide 
evidence that joining would be beneficial after the crisis. 
 
Table 5 shows the derived decisions and overall trends 
for each adoption date. Considering the last two columns of 
Table 5, four possible combinations of (Join, +), (Join, ), 
(Not-Join, +), and (Not-Join, ) may exist.  Only the 
combinations of (Join, +) and (Not-Join, ) are evidence of 
the support for the derived decision by the actual trends in 
the behavior of the MOs.  Based on Table 5, for five out of 
the eight groups of countries that joined the EMU on the 
unique adopted dates, the derived decision and trend 
analysis agreed.  The five groups included 15 countries.  To 
summarize, the accuracy of our decision support system was 
15/19 = 0.79% with the false positive of 3/19 = 16% and 
false negative of 1/19 = 5%. 
 
The certainty factor for the derived decision declines 
with time.  One explanation for such decline is that the size 
of the Y”i datasets reduce with time. The reduced sample 
size is a potential threat to the validity.  
 
It is worth mentioning that the proposed methodology 
can be applied to other policy making questions such as 
whether adopting a specific monetary policy strategy (e.g., 
Inflation Targeting) is effective.  
 
The discussed mining driven decision support system is 
designed to suggest a decision of “join” or “not-join” the 
EMU to a fiscal authority.  As a future research, we plan to 
investigate another popular/political question.  The question 
is under what circumstances is it beneficial for a given 
country to leave the EMU? This issue has become 
significantly important for both policy makers and 
researchers after the recent talk of Brexit. Also, the 
development of a Bayesian belief system to support the 
casual relationships among MOs, if any, is in progress.
