Abstract—This paper presents a self-organizing architecture
made of several maps, implementing a recurrent neural net-
work to cope with partial observations of the phase of some
dynamical system. The purpose of self-organization is to set
up a distributed representation of the actual phase, although
the observations received from the system are ambiguous (i.e.
the same observation may correspond to distinct phases). The
setting up of such a representation is illustrated by experiments,
and then the paper concludes on extensions toward adaptive
state representations for partially observable Markovian deci-
sion processes.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the design of artiﬁcial agents evolving in some envi-
ronment, one has to deal with information streams. Sensors
provide input streams to the information processing system
of the agent, and actuators actually produce a stream of
actions performed in order to exploit the environment. Such
an action stream is actually the output of the agent to the
environment. The coupling of the agent and the environment
through such information and energy streams is obvious for
any biologist who analyzes the behavior of some animal.
Nevertheless, in the ﬁeld of Computer Science and Machine
Learning, computation is often considered off-line, for tech-
nical reasons. The typical case is the use of data sets to train
the models, before actually using the trained models on-line.
This paper is a contribution to the part of Computer Sci-
ence that is rather involved in the design of situated systems,
thus actually focusing on the process of streams of informa-
tion. In that sense, it is related to reinforcement learning
approaches, that deal with sequential decision making of
an agent continuously interacting with its environment, as
well as temporal systems like recurrent neural networks that
handle sequences of input. Indeed, the model proposed here
allows to extract the phase of some dynamical system from a
sequence of observations computed from that phase. Let us
illustrate the need for such a feature from a straightforward
toy example.
Let us consider an animal perceiving the temperature T
of the ﬂoor. Let us suppose that any temperature T > T0 is
dangerous to it. In our example, the temperature oscillates
periodically between high and low values (for night and
day). The whole solar system conﬁguration is the phase of
the environment, noted xt here. It evolves in a deterministic
way, according to Newton’s law. The phase evolution is thus
driven by a transition function φ such as ∀t, xt+dt = φ(xt).
The temperature perceived by the animal is an observation
of the solar system, that can be expressed as T t = O (xt)
where O is the observation function, see ﬁgure 1. The sun
position in the sky P t = O′(xt) would have been another
observation of the solar system phase. Let us now consider
a time t for which the temperature T t = T0 −ϵ is just below
the threshold. Should the animal try to hide away from the
sun? The answer depends on the phase xt, from which the
animal could know if the temperature is currently decreasing
or increasing. The decision would have been easier from
the perception of sun position P t, since O′ is a bijective
function, and thus the values of P t allow to take the decision
directly from the current perception. If only T t is perceived
by the animal, an efﬁcient behavior requires that the animal
is able to represent internally a value ˆxt from which it can
take the right decision, since values of temperature may
be ambiguous (similar temperatures are observed twice a
day). T is thus said to be a partial observation of x. The
current value ˆxt is inferred and updated from the successive
observations T t. It is not required that ˆx be the exact
representation of the phase x, i.e. the animal do not need to
know where the planets are, but ˆx has to be set up such that
a bijective observation function implicitly exists from x to ˆx.
Partially observed environments are of interest in rein-
forcement learning domain. While the general trend is to
ﬁnd ˆxt before computing the corresponding value function
of each state, other works like [1] implement evaluation
with a recurrent network, but without explicitly extracting
some ˆxt.
The neural architecture presented in this paper relies
on self-organizing neural networks in order to build such
an internal representation from ambiguous sequences of
observations. Many works in the literature try directly or
indirectly to ﬁnd ˆxt. Concerning the use of self-organizing
maps, many enhancements on Kohonen basic map [2] like
in [3], [4], [5] consider the temporal dimension of input
sequences but they deal with the recognition of manually

extracted sequences, rather than on-line stream of inputs.
Reservoir computing methods [6] are closer to that pur-
pose, since they handle inputs from a stream one by one.
Readout units then search the huge reservoir states in order
to locate few signiﬁcant states. The signiﬁcant states repre-
sents the phases of the system that provide the inputs.
For the best of our knowledge, the present work is the ﬁrst
attempt to ﬁnd a mapping of a dynamical system phase space
using on-line self-organizing recurrent neural networks.
II. THE MODEL
As mentioned above, our goal is to design a system
that generates an internal representation of the dynamical
system phases from the stream of observations emerging
from it. Our model is an effort in this direction, inspiring
from biological information. It is based on the
bijama
model [7], proposed and developed in our team. It enables
building computational cortical-like 2D-neural assemblies
called maps, made of computational units representing corti-
cal columns. Units allow to process in parallel external entry
and internal signals carried out by connections. A schematic
of the model is shown in Fig.s 2 and 3. The architecture
comprises three maps, namely the input map, the delay map,
and the associative map. The input map receives the external
input stream. Its activity is expected to represent at time t
the coding ˆxt of the actual dynamical system phase xt.
The two other maps, the delay map and the associative
map are auxiliary maps that play the role of intermediate
structures for extracting ˆxt from the input stream ot. Their
purpose is to re-inject the delayed activity of the input map
into its dynamics. This recurrent pathway actually reveals the
temporal dimension of the input stream. Map activities are
computed by a neural ﬁeld. Each unit has lateral recurrent
connections to other units within the map, implementing
an on-center/off-surround connectivity [8], [9]. The ﬁeld
performs lateral competition between units and computes
the activity of each one, so that the global map activity has
the shape of a bump (see dark meshes in Fig. 4). The bump
positions are actually the response of the map to its input.
Lateral competition, from which activity bumps emerge, is
used in the model in order to guide the process of self-
organization of inputs over the map surface. This is indeed
difﬁcult with neural ﬁelds as explained in [9] from which
the neural ﬁeld process used in this paper is taken. The
whole architecture evolution is controlled by successive time
steps. A time step is a discrete time instance at which the
activities of all units in all maps are evaluated once, using
an asynchronous evaluation scheme [9]. Another kind of
connectivity in the model is the inter-map connectivity. A
unit at the bi-dimensional position p in some local map can
be connected to a whole strip-shaped region Sp in some
remote map. Then unit p handles connections from the units
at positions q ∈ Sp in the remote map, as shown in Fig. 2.
Each connection in a strip between p and a remote unit q
handles a weight whose current value is ¯st
pq, so that the strip
Sp owned by p handles a vector of weights ¯St
p =

referred to as the thalamic module. It handles the external
input ot, and matches it against a stored prototype ωt
p and
computes the similarity θt
p.

The second module is referred to as the cortical module. It
handles the strip Ap emerging from the associative map, and
computes the matching ct
p,A between the strip weight vector
¯At
p and the activity vector At
p. The matching is computed
as follows, where B is a numerical constant:

The third module is referred to as cortico-thalamaic

p and ct
p,A into one scalar νt
p as follows:

p =

Where β is a constant. The value of νt
p forms the ﬁnal input
ready to use by the neural ﬁeld, i.e. the upper module, to
compute the unit activity ut
p.
The unit activity is used to modulate the learning. Tha-
lamic learning implies moving θt
p towards ot proportionally
to ut
p, as shown in (4).

Where αω is a ﬁxed thalamic learning rate for all units.
On the other hand, cortical learning implies moving the

towards the cortical input ut

Where αS is a ﬁxed cortical learning rate for all model
connections. The previous rule means that learning occurs
only in connections to active units in local maps.
The next map in the model is the associative map. Its
receives the actual activity of the input map as well as
its delayed activity exhibited by the delayed map, then it
performs lateral competition via the neural ﬁeld, and re-
injects the result into the input map through the previously
mentioned A strips. The ﬁrst module of a unit q of this map
handles the strip Iq emerging from input map and computes
the matching ct
q,I. The second module handles the strip Dq
emerging from delay map and computes the matching ct
q,D.
Both matching values are computed similarly to what was
shown in input map units, according to 2. The third module
is referred to as cortico-cortical merging. It merges ct
q,I and
ct
q,D in one scalar µt
q as follows:

The purpose of noise is to boost the associative map activity
in units receiving null cortical activity before being injected
into the input map. The value of µt
q is actually the input to
the associative map neural ﬁeld module which computes the
unit activity ut
q.
The last map in the model is the delay map. It receives a
unit-to-unit copy of the input map activity and delays it for
some period of T time steps, using a T-length FIFO queue.
Units in this maps have two modules. The ﬁrst is the copy
module that copies ut
p from the input map. The second is
the FIFO module. Thus ut
p = ut−T
q
where q is a position
in the input map and p the same position in the delay map.
There is no need for a neural ﬁeld in this map.
As can be seen, the proposed architecture requires no
prior conditions on the input stream, nor on the underlying
dynamical system, it is thus a model free architecture. The
model does not require to adjust any parameter during
execution. Learning rates are thus constant. Moreover, there
is no need for resetting output bump activities u when a new
observation oτ+1 is presented.
III. EXPERIMENTS
In this section, the model is tested to validate its capability
to ﬁnd an internal state representation of some unknown
dynamical system providing observations. A toy example
of dynamical system is used here to test the capacity of
spatio-temporal organization of the model. Let x ∈ C
represent the system phase, and let the transition function
be φ (x) = x.eiϕ. Let us consider that the system transition
occurs at instant τ, thus we can write xτ+1 = φ (xτ) with
x0 = 0.5. Let the partial observation fed to the model be
O (xτ) = 0.5 + ℜ(xτ) + noiseo. Its values are kept in [0, 1].
The sampled stream values are perturbed by noise to test
the robustness to noisy observations.
The dynamical system phase can be thought of as the
position of a point moving in a steady speed on a circle,
and the observation is its noisy abscissa. This sinusoidal
observation is obviously ambiguous.

the poly-line. One cluster is formed by repeated visits of the
same system state. This indicates the stable representations
of states in the map space. Each thalamic region corresponds
to a range of close observations values. Within each region
there exists the representation of 2 or more states. For
example, the black region corresponds to observation values
close to 1, nevertheless, it contains 3 distinct successive state
representations marked A,B,C. When a range of observations
is located in the middle of the input values range, points
(like D,E) express non-successive states corresponding to the
same observation range, but in different temporal context.
Such duplications of states, related to the same value of
O, are progressively performed while the whole architecture
gets organized. It removes observation ambiguity. Thus, the

ensemble of state representations ˆx (i.e. bump positions)
expresses a bijective mapping between the map surface
and the dynamical system phase space. This was possible
because the model allowed the previous state of the input
map to be considered in computing its new state, integrating
this way, its state history. The added noise to the input stream
did not affect the model capability to extract the mapping.
The experience was launched with numerical values for
the dynamical system as follows: ϕ = 2π/15 and noiseo is

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, a recurrent neural architecture is proposed
for setting up a representation of the phases of a dynamical
system from the stream of partial observations of that
dynamical system. The phase extraction relies on three
self-organizing modules, whose self-organizing processes
are coupled via strip-like connections, according to the
bijama model. Experiments show that this fully unsuper-
vised architecture is able to self-organize so that the token
of hidden phases of the dynamical system are explicitly
built in the input map. Indeed, for each bump position in
that map, a phase of the dynamical system can be assigned.
Moreover, the topology preservation that is expected from
self-organizing maps actually stands here, since the input
map is still a continuous mapping of the space where the
observation lives (here the interval [0, 1]).
In the one hand, seminal works by Elman and Jordan [10],
[11] have already addressed the learning of a dynamical
system from the stream of observation, but this was obtained
from a supervised approach. In the other hand, as mentioned,
reservoir computing approaches relies on high dimensional
representation spaces to build an a priori set of states, from
which the ones corresponding to the actual phases of the
system can be extracted by readout units. In both cases, the
setting up of a phase representation is not explicit. Here,
the whole architecture adapts for extracting explicit phase
representation by self-organization.
Future work will investigate the potential of the model
self-organization features in both space and time when
applied to systems exhibiting non-stationary dynamics. The
goal is to see if the model would be able to recruit new
regions in the input map or release useless regions when
the dynamic change. Future work consists also in using the
representation built in the input map as a state space for
taking decisions within Markovian decision processes. In a
more integrated model, such cortical representations could
indeed feed actor and critic neural modules, inspired from
basal ganglia modeling [12], [13], with a Markovian state
space representation that is updated from the current partial
information provided by the robot sensors.
