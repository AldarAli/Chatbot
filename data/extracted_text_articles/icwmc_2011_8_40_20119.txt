Abstract—In this paper, an area-efficient symbol detector is 
proposed 
for 
multiple-input 
multiple-output 
(MIMO) 
communication systems with two transmit and two receive 
antennas. The proposed symbol detector can support both the 
spatial multiplexing mode and spatial diversity mode in a 
single hardware, and shows the optimal maximum likelihood 
(ML) performance. By applying the multi-stage pipeline 
structure and using the complex multiplier based on polar-
coordinate, the complexity of the proposed architecture is 
dramatically decreased. The proposed symbol detector was 
designed in hardware description language (HDL) and 
synthesized to gate-level circuits using 0.13um CMOS standard 
cell library. With the proposed architecture, the total logic gate 
count for the detector is 393K, which is reduced by 57% 
compared with the conventional architecture.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
As the demand for a high-rate and reliable wireless data 
transmission increases, MIMO techniques have attracted 
considerable attention in recent wireless communication 
systems such as IEEE 802.11n wireless local area network 
(WLAN), IEEE 802.16e mobile worldwide interoperability 
for microwave access (WiMAX), and 3GPP long-term 
evolution (LTE) [1]. 
The MIMO techniques can basically be classified into 
spatial diversity (SD) scheme [2] and spatial multiplexing 
(SM) scheme [1]. In SM scheme, since independent data 
streams are transmitted from the individual transmit 
antennas, the overall data rate is significantly increased as 
the number of transmit antenna increases. Meanwhile, since 
SD systems transmit multiple streams bearing the same 
information, the link reliability is considerably improved 
from the spatial diversity gain even though there is no 
increase in data rate.  
In SD scheme, the optimal ML symbol detection can be 
easily accomplished by simple linear combination at 
receiver [2]. However, since the ML detection for SM 
scheme requires exhaustive search for all transmitted 
symbols from all transmit antennas, its complexity is 
proportional to 
CNT
 (C is the constellation size and NT is the 
number of transmit antennas) and exponentially increases as 
C and NT increase. Therefore, its real-time implementation 
is infeasible when a large number of antennas are used 
together with high constellation size, e.g., 64QAM. 
In order to solve this complexity problem, there have 
been vigorous researches in recent decades [3]-[12]. Among 
them, modified ML (MML) detection algorithm, which can 
reduce the complexity by the ratio of 1/C, was proposed in 
[10], and was applied to several implementations as in [11]-
[12]. Since the recent communication systems mostly 
support two transmit and two receive antennas to be 
incorporated into mobile device, MML detection can be 
considered to be suitable for the symbol detector of those 
systems because its complexity is proportional to only C. 
Although MML detection provides a lower complexity 
than the classical ML detection, its complexity is still too 
high to be implemented in real time especially when 
supporting 64QAM because 64 complex calculations for 
Euclidean distance should be performed in parallel. Also, 
since SD scheme such as space-time block coding (STBC) 
[2] and space-frequency block coding (SFBC) [13] should 
be supported together with SM scheme in most systems, the 
design of the efficient hardware architecture is really 
important for the MIMO symbol detector. 
In this paper, we propose an area-efficient MIMO 
symbol detector supporting both SD and SM modes and 
present its design and implementation results. By fully 
sharing the common function blocks and applying the multi-
stage pipelining, the proposed detector is implemented with 
very low-complexity.  
This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, MIMO 
system model is presented, and ML and MML symbol 
detection algorithms are introduced in Section III. The 
hardware architecture for the proposed symbol detector is 
described in Section IV, and the implementation results are 
presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the 
paper.

SYMBOL DETECTION ALGORITHMS 
A. ML Symbol Detection Algorithm 
The ML detection method, which achieves the best 
performance by searching for the transmitted signal vector 
that leads to the minimum Euclidian distance from the 
received signal vector, can be represented as 
arg min
.
ML =

×
X
X
y

                       (2) 
Since its complexity exponentially increases as the number 
of transmit antennas and the constellation size increase, its 
real-time implementation is infeasible. For example, in case 
of NT=2 and 64QAM, 642=4096 searches is required for 
each received signal vector. 
B. Prior Research in Symbol Detection Algorithm 
As an alternative of MLD, the concept of sphere 
detection (SD) was introduced in [4] and has further 
discussed in various publications [5]–[6]. In order to avoid 
the exponential complexity of the MLD, the search for the 
closest lattice point is restricted to include only vector 
constellation points that fall within a certain search sphere. 
This approach allows for finding the ML solution with only 
polynomial complexity for sufficiently high signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) [4]. However, SD has a disadvantage that the 
computational complexity varies with different signals and 
channels. Hence, the detection throughput is non-fixed, 
which is not desirable for the real-time hardware 
implementation. To resolve this problem, the MLD with QR 
decomposition 
and 
M-algorithm 
(QRM-MLD) 
was 
proposed in [7]. At each search layer in QRM-MLD, only 
the best M candidates are kept for the next level search and 
therefore, it has the fixed complexity and throughput which 
is suitable for pipeline hardware implementation. However, 
its complexity is still exponentially increasing with the 
number of transmit antennas, which may bring very large 
computational complexity when high spectral efficiencies 
are required to support higher communication rates [9]. 
C. MML Symbol Detection Algorithm 
The MML technique that reduces dramatically the 
computational complexity of ML technique without 
degradation performance was introduced in [10]. Table I 
describes the symbol detection algorithm based on MML 
detection, where C is the set consisting of the constellation 
points and Q(-) represents a slicing (quantization) function. 
As depicted in Table I, with the MML symbol detection, the 
required computational number of MML metric for symbol 
detection is
1
NT
C
- , while that of ML metric is 
CN T
. The 
MML algorithm reduces the computational complexity of 
the ML algorithm significantly, however, especially when 
supporting 64QAM, its complexity is still too high to be 
implemented in real-time. Therefore, efficient architecture 
design for the real-time implementation is required.

DESIGN OF HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE FOR THE 
PROPOSED MIMO SYMBOL DETECTOR 
The efficient hardware structure of the MIMO symbol 
detector to support all MIMO transmission modes is 
presented in this section. In order to achieve the more

reliable performance and higher-rate data transmission, the 
latest wireless communication systems specify to support 
SD mode such as single-input multiple-output (SIMO), 
multiple input single-output (MISO), STBC and SFBC as 
well as SM mode. If the symbol detector for each mode is 
designed independently, it is not efficient because the 
hardware complexity is a very burdensome to be 
implemented in real time. By sharing commonly used 
function block for all MIMO modes, the complexity of the 
proposed architecture is dramatically decreased. 
Fig. 2 shows the proposed hardware structure of 2x2 
MIMO symbol detector and Table II summarizes the 
procedure of proposed symbol detection to support all of 
transmission modes. The proposed structure of MIMO 
symbol detector is composed of input preprocessor module 
(IPM), parameter calculation module (PCM), decision 
variable calculation module (DVCM), X2C calculation 
module (X2CCM), Euclidean distance calculation module 
(EDCM), 1D LLR calculation module (1DLCM), 2D LLR 
calculation module (2DLCM) and 8-bit quantization module 
(QM). 
A. Input Preprocessor Module (IPM) 
Fig. 3 shows the hardware block diagram of IPM, which 
set the input data of PCM for MIMO mode by reordering 
the estimated channel vectors and received signal vector. 
Especially, the column-switching of the channel matrix, H, 
is performed for multi-stage pipelining in case of SM mode. 
Since the vertical coding [13] for SM mode is generally 
specified in most recent wireless communication standards 
such as IEEE 802.16e mobile WiMAX and 3GPP LTE, 
LLR values from each transmit antenna need not to be 
generated simultaneously. Therefore, LLR values are 
generated sequentially by column-switching in IPM and the 
hardware blocks are fully shared to reduce the complexity in 
the proposed architecture.

B. Parameter Calculation Module (PCM) 
As shown in Fig. 4, PCM calculates the parameters, p1, 
p2 and p3, which are the commonly required operations for 
both SD and SM modes. In case of SD mode, p1 and p2 are 
used for calculating the decision variables in DVCM and p3 
is utilized as the channel state information (CSI). In case of 
SM mode, all the parameters are mapped to the input data of 
X2CCM. 
C. X2C Calculation Module (X2CCM) 
As shown in Fig. 5, X2CCM consists of the polar-
coordinate based multiplier (PBM) and slicer module 
(SCM). SCM makes the output, x2(cm),

In the proposed architecture, the complex multiplication is 
replaced by the PBM which can be simply implemented 
with sign-inverter, shifters and adders as in Fig. 5(b) 
because cm in constellation is constant and symmetric. 
Especially, PBM is designed with 4-stage pipeline 
architecture to reduce the computational complexity by 
sharing the hardware resources. Although the throughput 
performance may be degraded, it is practically negligible 
because the throughput bottleneck of the baseband modem 
is mostly in the forward error correction (FEC) module such 
as turbo decoder. For example, when the proposed detector 
is applied to the mobile WiMAX baseband processor 
including turbo decoder with 6 iterations, it is verified from 
the timing analysis that 4-stage pipelining of PBM does not 
make any degradation of throughput performance.

After calculating ED, log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values are 
computed from 1DLCM or 2DLCM, and the final quantized 
LLR value is generated by 8-bit QM for FEC module such 
as turbo decoder. The quantization is performed through the 
analysis for the distribution of the calculated LLR value

IMPLEMNTATION RESULTS 
The MIMO symbol detector supporting all MIMO 
modes with the proposed architecture was designed in HDL 
and synthesized to gate-level circuits using 0.13um CMOS 
standard cell library. Table IV depicts the logic synthesis 
results for 80MHz operating clock frequency of the 
proposed MIMO symbol detector, which shows that EDCM 
is the most complex block in the proposed detector.  
Table V shows the comparison results of our design and 
the existing detectors. Even though the proposed detector 
can support all MIMO modes such as SD and SM, its 
complexity is rather reduced by 57% compared with that of 
[10]. Compared with the results in [16], the proposed 
detector has the similar complexity. However, it can support 
all MIMO modes and the optimal ML performance.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we proposed an area-efficient hardware 
architecture for the MIMO symbol detector which can 
support all MIMO modes such as SD and SM. With the 
multi-stage pipelining, simplified multiplication based on 
polar-coordinate, and the approximation of norm operation, 
the complexity of the proposed detector is reduced by 57% 
compared with that of the conventional architecture. Since 
the recent wireless systems specify to support both SD and 
SM modes and need to be implemented with low-
complexity and low-power consumption, the proposed 
MIMO symbol detector can be considered to be suitable for 
those systems.
