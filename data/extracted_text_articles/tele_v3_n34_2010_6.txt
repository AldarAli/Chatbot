Abstract — Lack of frequency spectrum is becoming one 
of the major problems in the telecommunication field 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
several 
new 
radio 
communication technologies. Cognitive Radio (CR) 
technology promises to be one possible solution to this 
problem, by allowing access of unlicensed users in 
licensed bands, based on an opportunistic approach and 
without interfering with the licensed (primary) user. In 
order to identify which frequency bands are more 
suitable for such purposes, it is necessary to evaluate the 
degree in which licensed bands are actually used. 
Although some measurement campaigns have already 
been carried out, most of them were done in the USA 
and only a few in other locations worldwide. This paper 
presents results of a measurement campaign conducted 
in Bucharest, Romania, covering the frequency range 
from 25 MHz up to 3.4 GHz. An overview of the various 
spectrum sensing methods available for evaluating the 
spectral occupancy is presented. The measurement 
results are confronted with the frequency allocation 
table 
published 
by 
the 
national 
authority 
for 
communications and an analysis of the obtained data is 
being made.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Radio frequency spectrum is a resource of fundamental 
importance in wireless communication systems. During 
recent years a multitude of wireless applications and services 
were developed, and as a result, the need for new frequency 
bands increased. As most of the available spectrum has 
already been allocated, the lack of spectrum resources has 
become a serious problem.  
In order to address this problem, one possible approach is 
to create user equipment devices that are able to dynamically 
detect free spectrum resources and use them in order to 
improve overall spectrum usage. A first step in this direction 
was the introduction of Software Defined Radio (SDR), 
devices where components that have been usually 
implemented 
in 
hardware 
(e.g. 
filters, 
amplifiers, 
modulators/demodulators, etc.) are instead implemented by 
means of software. Such an approach allows the equipment 
to be easily reconfigured in order to receive and transmit 
different radio protocols by selecting which part of the 
software is to be used. 
J. Mitola III introduced in 1999 the cognitive radio (CR) 
term, which can be defined as a wireless communication 
system that allows spectrum sharing over a wide frequency 
range and that is able to handle multiple radio access 
technologies [2]. 
An application of CR that would greatly contribute to an 
increased spectral efficiency is to allow unlicensed users 
access to licensed bands. In order to avoid any harmful 
interference to the primary (licensed) system, CR equipment 
should include the following functionality: 
• 
Frequency-agility and re-configuration of radios; 
• 
Spectrum sensing, in order to be aware of the 
surrounding radio environment; 
• 
Capability of discerning between secondary and 
primary systems and avoidance of interference to the 
primary system; 
• 
Spectrum management, in order to achieve effective 
co-existence and radio resource sharing with primary 
systems. 
The spectrum sensing functionality is a key element of 
any CR equipment, allowing it to detect accurately the 
spectrum holes. 
Although there are several ways in which cognitive 
radio spectrum sensing can be performed, a first 
classification can be made according to how the information 
is shared between CR devices in the following two 
categories: 
• 
Non-cooperative spectrum sensing: This form of 
spectrum sensing occurs when a CR acts on its 
own. The CR device configures itself according to 
the signals it can detect. 
• 
Cooperative 
spectrum 
sensing: 
Within 
a 
cooperative CR spectrum sensing system, sensing 
is performed by a number of different radios within 
the CR network. Typically, a central station will 
receive information from a variety of radios in the 
network, process it and adjust the overall CR 
network accordingly.

The current work represents an extension of a paper 
presented at the AICT 2010 conference [1]. The paper 
presents the results of a measurement campaign regarding 
spectrum occupancy conducted in Bucharest, Romania. 
These results represent just a preliminary work as the 
collected data is just instantaneous. Further measurements 
including long time measurements and data collected from 
other rural locations have been done and the results have 
been published in [3]. 
The paper is organized as follows. At first, results 
obtained during several other measurement campaigns are 
commented. Section II contains a description of the 
equipment used for performing the measurements. An 
overview of the various conventional spectrum sensing 
methods is given in Section III. The methodology and results 
of the measurements are presented in Section IV. During 
Section V, the measurement results are being analyzed from 
the cognitive radio perspective. Finally, in Section VI, the 
conclusion is being drawn and aspects concerning the future 
work are presented. 
A. Related Work 
Several measurement campaigns concerning spectrum 
occupancy were conducted worldwide [4]-[11], most of them 
were carried out the in the USA [4]-[5] and only a few in 
other locations worldwide, including Singapore [6], 
Germany [7]-[9], New Zeeland [10] and Spain [11], in urban 
or suburban scenarios. Results of a measurement campaign 
conducted in Chicago, USA showed a mean occupancy as 
low as 17.4% in the frequency band 30 to 3000 MHz [4]. 
Studies were also targeted at narrower frequency bands, like 
the public safety ones, and the benefits of cooperative 
sensing 
were 
highlighted 
[5]. 
During 
spectrum 
measurements taken over 12 weekday periods for a wider 
frequency band up to 5850 MHz in Singapore a mean 
occupancy value of only 4.54% was obtained [6]. The 
difference between indoor and outdoor locations was 
discussed in [7] based on measurements performed in 
Aachen, Germany. 
Spectrum power measurements during a large public 
event (the 2006 Football World Cup in Germany) are 
presented in [8] and [9]. The campaign was conducted in 2 
different cities, Dortmund and Kaiserslautern, and the 
measurements were taken in the proximity of football 
stadiums during match days. The obtained results clearly 
indicated a strong interdependency between spectrum 
occupancy values and different stages of the football match. 
Data collected throughout the measurement campaign was 
analyzed in order to find suitable methods for evaluating the 
vacancy of spectrum bands due to time-dependent statistics, 
including average channel allocation, average run length and 
amount of runs. 
The measurement campaign conducted in urban 
Barcelona goes as high as 7075 MHz, using 2 different 
discone antennas, a low-noise amplifier and a high 
performance spectrum analyzer [10]. Three different metrics 
were used for evaluating the spectrum occupancy: power 
spectral density, instantaneous evolution of the temporal 
spectrum occupancy and duty cycle as a function of 
frequency. For the entire frequency band between 75MHz 
and 7075MHz the measured spectrum occupancy was quite 
low 17.78%, but if for the frequency area below 1 GHz the 
spectrum usage was moderate, for the are above 2 GHz the 
spectrum remained mostly underutilized. 
However, as frequency spectrum regulations differ 
considerably between regions and even countries, it is 
important to obtain results from as many different scenarios 
as possible, in order to analyze the possible situations that a 
CR user equipment might encounter. 
II. 
SPECTRUM SENSING METHODS 
Several spectrum sensing methods can be used in order to 
decide if a certain frequency band is available for 
opportunistic access [12]-[15]. For each of the described 
methods, a short description of the principle used is given, 
and the strengths and weaknesses of the method are 
underlined. 
A. Energy Detection 
The energy detection method provides an optimal 
detection in cases where the primary user signal is unknown 
[13]. The received radio frequency energy or the received 
signal strength indicator is measured and compared to a 
precomputed threshold to determine whether the spectrum is 
occupied or not. 
The energy can be measured in several ways. When 
using an analogue implementation, a pre-filter with fixed 
bandwidth is required. However, this solution is not suitable 
for simultaneous sensing of narrowband and wideband 
signals, situation that is very often expected considering 
modern communication systems. More flexibility can be 
obtained when using a digital implementation, because of 
FFT-based spectral estimates. In this case, various bandwidth 
types are supported, which will allow simultaneous sensing 
of multiple signals. 
The advantages of the energy-detection methods are 
universal 
applicability, 
relative 
low 
computational 
complexity and reduced amount of prior signal knowledge 
required.  
The most serious drawbacks of the energy detection 
method are that it is highly susceptible to changes in the 
background noise spectral density and to the presence of in-
band interference. Another major disadvantage, specific to 
cognitive radio scenarios, is that the energy detection method 
cannot distinguish the primary systems from the secondary 
ones sharing the same channel. This becomes a critical 
challenge when multiple primary systems are present in the 
same area where cognitive radio equipment operates. 
B. Matched Filtering 
A filter matched to a received signal has an impulse 
response equal to a conjugated and time-reversed version of 
the received signal [15]. This matched filter represents an 
optimal detection method as it provides a maximum signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) output in the presence of additive white 
Gaussian noise (AWGN). The output of the matched filter is 
compared to a threshold in order to decide if the signal

corresponding to a primary system is present or not. The

where λ  represents the threshold, 
[ ]

x n
represents a time-reversed 
version of the assumed signal. 
In order to apply this matched filtering method, a priori 
knowledge is required about the signal that is to be detected, 
at both physical and medium access control layers. 
Fortunately, for most of the actual communication systems 
there is enough information available (e.g., pilot subcarrier 
synchronization sequence in OFDM systems, midamble 
sequence in GSM systems) in order to allow signal detection 
using this method. 
Between the advantages offered by the matched filtering 
method can be mentioned optimality for AWGN channels, 
relative low computational complexity needed and the 
possibility to be applied to most licensed systems.  
The most important disadvantages of this method are 
sensitivity 
to 
imperfect 
synchronization 
and 
poor 
performance in non-AWGN channels. A further drawback of 
the matched filtering method is that a CR equipment that 
operates in an area where multiple possible primary systems 
could be present will need a dedicated receiver for every 
kind of primary system. This will generate an increase of the 
complexity and will make the implementation of such 
equipment a significant challenge, even in case of 
programmable realization. 
A variant of matched-filtering detection is tone detection. 
In this particular case, the presence of a tone of finite 
strength is detected, and this presence implies the presence of 
a particular signal associated with that tone’s frequency. 
Matched filtering or Fourier analysis of a narrow frequency 
band around the expected tone frequency can be used in 
order to detect the presence of this tone.  
C. Cyclostationary Feature Detection 
Spectral correlation is a statistical property that is 
characteristic for cyclostationary signals [15]. One or several 
probabilistic 
parameters 
(e.g., 
mean, 
autocorrelation, 
probability density function, nth-order moment, or nth-order 
cumulant) of cyclostationary signals are periodic functions in 
time domain. An example of how the cyclostationary 
detection can be performed is the following. First, the cyclic 
autocorrelation function 
x ( )
Rα τ
of the observed signal 
( )
x t is computed as

Finally, the detection is concluded by looking for the 
unique cyclic frequency corresponding to a maximum value 
in the SCF plane. 
The most important advantage of the cyclostationary 
detection method consists in its insensitivity to noise and co-
channel insensitivity. The reason for that is that noise has no 
spectral correlation, and the SCF can reflect only the spectral 
correlation properties of a single signal if the cyclic 
frequency is unique to that signal. A further advantage of the 
cyclostationary detection method is applicable to nearly all 
the modern communication signals. This method can work 
also with lower SNR than the energy detection method, as it 
exploits the information embedded in the received signal. 
The main disadvantage of the cyclostationary detection 
method is that the cyclic frequency has to be be known by 
the secondary user. It also requires a more complex 
implementation and a longer observation time than in case of 
the energy detection method. This may cause the 
cyclostationary detector to be inefficient in case of spectrum 
holes of short time duration. 
D. Wavelet Detection 
The wavelet detection method is particularly suitable in 
case of wideband signals, as it presents advantages in terms 
of implementation and flexibility compared to the 
conventional approach of using multiple narrowband 
bandpass filters [15]. 
The entire frequency band of a wideband signal is 
modeled as a series of consecutive frequency sub-bands, in 
order to identify spectrum holes. The power spectral 
characteristic is smooth within each sub-band, but changes 
abruptly on the border of two neighboring sub-bands. By 
using a wavelet transform of the power spectral density of

the observed signal [ ]
x n , the singularities of the power 
spectral density
( )
S f
can be located and the available 
frequency bands can be identified.   
The main weakness of the wavelet detection method is 
related to the high sampling rates needed when building a 
wavelet detector for large bandwidth signals. 
E. Delay-and-Multiply Detection 
Another sensing technique is the delay-and-multiply 
signal detector, which multiplies the collected data block 
with a delayed and conjugated version of itself in order to 
generate an additive sine-wave component the presence of 
which can be detected by using Fourier methods [14]. The 
presence of the tone implies the presence of the signal, and 
the exact frequency of the tone provides a parameter estimate 
for the signal, usually equal to the symbol rate (chip rate for 
direct sequence spread spectrum signals). 
The delay-and-multiply detector is a simple exploitation 
of cyclostationarity in that it employs a quadratic 
transformation to generate a spectral line. This is only 
possible for CS signals. 
The strengths of the delay-and-multiply detector are that 
it can provide superior sensitivity relative to the energy 
detectors, is robust to uncertainties in the noise power and 
interference parameters, and is computationally less 
expensive than more thorough methods that exploit the 
cyclostationarity property. Its main weaknesses are that it is 
not applicable to a large number of signals and that optimum 
performance requires knowledge of the optimum delay, 
which in turn requires knowledge of the transmitter filtering 
applied to the signal to be detected. That is, the optimum 
delay for rectangular-pulse signals is half the symbol 
interval, but for signals that have been filtered with a square-
root raised-cosine filter, the optimum delay is zero.   
F. Swiss Army Knife Solutions 
In order to improve the overall sensing performance it 
would be possible to implement a spectrum-sensing device 
that contains a highly specialized detector for each type of 
signal that has to be detected: a matched filter for DVB-T, a 
delay-and-multiply detector for DSSS, an energy detector for 
GSM, etc. This kind of sensing strategy is called a Swiss 
Army knife (SAK) solution because of the disparate nature, 
computational requirements, and achievable performance of 
the various signal-specific sensors [14]. A possible approach 
would be to make a choice between the various available 
detectors depending of the frequency band that is scanned, 
which could provide information about what type of licensed 
signals are expected in the respective frequency area. 
III. 
MEASUREMENT EQUIPMENT 
The measurement campaign has been carried out from 
the top of the main building of our Department, which 
proves to be an excellent location for such a purpose. The 
terrace has direct line of sight with several FM transmitters, 
Analog and DVB-T TV transmitters, GSM and UMTS base 
stations and several other stations (GPS location: latitude 
44°26'01" N, longitude 26°03'27" E, MSL altitude 150m, 
relative altitude 30m). The headquarters of the governmental 
agency for special telecommunications is also located just a 
few hundreds of meters away from the measurement 
location. A bird’s eye view of the surrounding area is 
presented in Figure 1.

For the frequency bands below 1 GHz a wideband 
discone antenna (Sirio SD1300N, specified from 25 to 1300 
MHz) was used, mounted on the building terrace. The 
antenna has an omnidirectional pattern in the horizontal 
plane and was connected using a low-loss RF cable to a high 
performance signal analyzer (Anritsu MS2690A - 50 Hz to 6 
GHz, average noise level -155 dBm/Hz at 2 GHz), located in 
a laboratory on the last floor of the building. Although the 
length of the cable was approximately 20m, the cable 
attenuation was less than 5 dB.  For the frequency bands 
above 1 GHz a directional antenna (Aaronia Hyperlog 4060, 
400 MHz to 6 GHz) was used. In this case, a short cable of 
1.5 m (SUCOFLEX 104PEA) was used and the insertion 
loss was lower than -1dB. During the measurements, the 
spectrum analyzer was configured as described in Table I.

The performed measurements covered the frequency 
range from 25 MHz to 3400 MHz, the whole band being 
further divided into 14 sub-bands according to the type of 
service and the bandwidth of the allocated signal.

IV. 
MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
As it was already described in Section II, the energy 
detection method is the only method that does not require 
any a priori knowledge about the evaluated signals, and this 
is the method that was used in order to evaluate the 
occupancy in the several frequency bands presented in Table 
I.  
In order to estimate correctly the noise floor, a sliding 
window of 1000 samples was used for each of the frequency 
bands. A mean value of the samples contained in the sliding 
window was calculated and the lowest mean value, 
corresponding to an unoccupied frequency area, was chosen 
as the noise floor of the corresponding frequency band. To 
mitigate the effects of high-power noise samples in false 
activity detection, a second sliding window with a calculated 
width of 100 KHz was used in order to mean out such 
samples and to minimize the false alarm probability. To 
illustrate the effect of this second window, an example is 
presented in Figure 4 for the frequency band from 470 to 766 
MHz.  
 
 
(a) 
 
(b) 
Figure 4.  Spectral occupancy for the 470-766 MHz frequency band (a) 
before and (b) after applying the 100 kHz sliding window. 
 
In Figure 4 (a) the original captured signal can be seen, 
and in Figure 4 (b) can be noticed the signal obtained after 
processing. In case of this frequency band, the width of 100 
kHz chosen for the window results in a number 3 
consecutive samples to be taken into account when 
processing the signal. 
A parameter of great importance when using the energy 
detection method for taking decision about the availability of 
a certain frequency band is the value chosen for the energy 
threshold.  
If the value used for the threshold is too high weak 
signals will be treated as noise and this would result in an 
underestimation of the actual occupancy. In Figure 5 (a), an 
example is presented for the frequency band from 470 to 766 
MHz. The mean noise value is represented with the red line, 
and the value chosen for the threshold is represented with a 
green line. It can be noticed that when choosing a value of 
11dB for the threshold, several low-power signals are below 
the threshold level. 
On the other hand, choosing a too low value for the 
threshold will increase the false alarm probability caused by 
high-power noise samples and this would cause an 
overestimation of the actual occupancy. In Figure 5 (b), for 
the same frequency band a value of 3dB is chosen for the 
threshold, and several noise samples raise above the 
threshold level.

different values of the threshold: (a) 11dB (b) 3dB and (c) 5dB. 
 
By analyzing the signals measured during the campaign, 
a value of 5 dB for the threshold was chosen, as it allows 
detection of the weakest measured signal and in the same 
time is high enough to avoid false detections. This situation 
is illustrated in Figure 5 (c). 
The results listed in Table II were obtained by using this 
threshold value of 5dB for all the 14 different frequency sub-
bands.

As it can be noticed, the measured occupancy decreases 
when raising the value of the threshold, because the low-
energy signals visible in Figure 4 are being ignored. 
All the measurements have been carried out during 
daytime in weekdays, when higher values for spectral 
occupancy are expected, comparing to nighttime or 
weekends.  
V. 
MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS 
Although most of the frequency range between 25 MHz 
and 1GHz shows a relative high occupancy, there are bands 
with some potential for cognitive radio applications. The 
lowest occupancy percent was measured in the 230 to 400 
MHz band (Figure 7), however most of this band is for the 
moment licensed for military applications.  
The frequency band 470-766 MHz is currently used 
mostly for analog TV broadcasting. Several analog TV 
broadcasting stations can be noticed in Figure 9 (the level for 
the station located on 506 MHz is higher then average, as the 
broadcast antenna is located on the same building from 
where the measurements were performed). However, 
although for the moment the occupancy is quite high at 
40.02%, this might change in the near future, with the 
introduction of DVB-T. Test broadcasting for DVB-T is 
already 
being 
performed 
in 
the 
Bucharest 
area, 
corresponding signals can be noticed in Figure 9 on 546 
MHz (channel 30) and 738 MHz (channel 54). New 
measurements will have to be conducted in order to evaluate 
spectral occupancy in this frequency range, once the digital 
TV broadcasting technology will completely replace the 
analog one (analog TV broadcasting in Romania is only 
allowed until 1 January 2012, due to European regulations). 
Furthermore, the broadcast area for both DVB-T and analog 
TV stations is limited around big cities, which will result in a 
lower occupancy for this band in rural environment. 
In the frequency band 766 to 880 MHz (Figure 10) only a 
test DVB-T broadcast station (778 MHz, channel 59) was 
detected during the measurements, although other possible 
applications are allowed conforming to the governmental 
agency responsible for frequency allocation in Romania [16]. 
The 880-960 MHz and 1710-1880 MHz (Figures 11 and 
12) are licensed for the GSM 900 and 1800 systems. In the 
frequency 
bands 
corresponding 
to 
the 
downlink 
communication direction (925-960 MHz for GSM 900 and 
1805-1880 MHz for GSM 1800) a high power level was

measured during the whole band, as the locations of base 
station antennas was close to the measurement location and 
the transmit power employed is considerably higher than the 
one used in case of mobile stations. Although in frequency 
bands corresponding to the uplink communication direction 
(880-915 MHz and 1710-1785 MHz) the measured 
occupancy was extremely low, it should be noted the 
measurement location and the low transmit power of mobile 
stations might cause an underestimation of the actual 
occupancy. CR equipment activating in these bands should 
have a detection mechanism capable of recognizing low-
power signals with energy close to the noise floor, in order to 
avoid interference to primary users active in the area. 
The overall spectrum occupancy measured in frequency 
bands located above 1 GHz was extremely low (mean 
occupancies of less than 10%), which make most of this 
frequency bands potential candidates for CR applications. 
Occupancies higher than 10% were obtained for sub-bands 9, 
where the GSM 1800 systems are licensed, and 10, licensed 
for UMTS/IMT 2000 systems. In both cases, it is again to be 
noticed that the measured occupancy is much higher for the 
downlink direction compared to the uplink direction, 
especially for the UMTS systems where spread spectrum 
signals are used. 
The ISM band 2400 to 2500 MHz is a very good 
opportunity for testing CR prototype devices, as the 
measured occupancy is quite low (9.42%) and there are a 
multitude of commercially available hardware devices 
operating in this frequency range. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Results obtained during the measurement campaign 
conducted in an urban environment in Bucharest, Romania 
clearly indicate that there are several frequency bands that 
allow opportunistic access for future CR applications. The 
frequency range analyzed was 25 MHz to 3.4 GHz, and the 
mean occupancy ratio over the whole band was as low as 
12.19%. 
Although the values for spectrum occupancy were higher 
than the ones obtained for the frequency sub-bands above 
1GHz, there were two sub-bands, 2 (230-400 MHz) and 5 
(766-880 MHz), where the measured occupancy was lower, 
close to 10%. 
 In case of the frequency sub-bands above 1 GHz, there 
are several sub-bands where spectrum occupancy values 
lower than 5% were obtained (960 – 1525 MHz, 1525 – 
1710 MHz, 2200 – 2400 MHz, 2500 – 2690 MHz, 2690 – 
3400 MHz). All these bands offer good opportunities for 
testing of CR prototypes and development of CR networks. 
In order to increase the relevance of the obtained data, 
measurements over longer periods of time and in wider 
frequency bands (up to 6 GHz) will be performed. 
Related to the methodology used for choosing the 
threshold in case of the energy detection method, another 
fact that should be taken into account for future analysis is 
the mean sensitivity of the licensed user equipment that 
operates in the corresponding frequency band. 
Although the results obtained up to now were collected 
exclusively in an urban environment, further measurement 
campaigns targeted at suburban and rural environments are 
intended, in order to obtain a complete picture of the 
perspectives for future CR applications.
