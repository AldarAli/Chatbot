Abstract—Integrated network architectures have the potential
to provide ubiquitous and seamless services over wide areas of
mobility, with adequate quality of service and favourable price.
To fully exploit such architectures (heterogeneous networking en-
vironments) multiple handovers often become necessary. Further-
more, in view of the growing demand for real-time applications,
the inclusion of QoS-related parameters in the handover decision
process is essential. This requirement inevitably increases the
overall number of decision parameters, leading to unacceptably
long algorithm execution time for a typical monolithic fuzzy-
based handover decision system (MHDS), which employs a single
fuzzy decision engine. In this paper, an adaptive trafﬁc dependent
fuzzy-based handover decision system (ATDHDS), which employs
multiple fuzzy decision engines, each dedicated to a speciﬁc
trafﬁc type, is presented. The results show that, comparing with
the MHDS, the proposed ATDHDS signiﬁcantly improves the
network selection performance and algorithm execution time.
The ATDHDS is then enhanced by introducing additional fuzzy
engines, which perform a QoS aggregation process, with the aims
to further improve the overall network selection performance and
to further reduce the algorithm execution time. The simulation
results suggest that the enhanced ATDHDS (EATDHDS) success-
fully achieves both objectives.

I. INTRODUCTION
Mobile users in the ‘Information age’ expect ubiquitous and
seamless services over wide areas of mobility, with adequate
quality of service and favourable price. It appears that inte-
grated network architectures have the potential to satisfy the
above requirements. Integrated network architectures (referred
to as heterogeneous networking environments) require inter-
connections of various wireless technologies such as WLAN,
WiMAX and Cellular networks as illustrated in Figure 1. To
ensure continuous connection, required quality of service and
acceptable usage price, over a wide area of mobility, multiple
handovers (switching connection from one wireless network to
another) often become necessary. A handover may take place
in a homogeneous networking environment (horizontal han-
dover) or in a heterogeneous networking environment (vertical
handover). In either case some form of decision mechanism
needs to exist within the mobile device.
A horizontal handover decision is normally a straightfor-
ward process as the decision is based simply on the received
signal strength (RSS). However, due to varied characteristics
of different wireless networks, a simple RSS based decision
cannot achieve the required results in a vertical handover
decision process. Clearly there is a need for a much more
intelligent handover decision system (HDS) for heterogeneous
networking environments. Several deterministic algorithms for
handover decision engines have been proposed in the literature,
however they suffered from two limitations: 1) inability to
deal with imprecise data efﬁciently, 2) inconsistencies in the
decision outcomes, due to the fact that the procedures used
for assignment of parameter weight are subjective.
The fuzzy logic techniques are regarded to have the ability
to deal with the above limitations. Thus, numerous fuzzy logic
based solutions, which enhance intelligence of the vertical han-
dover process, have been proposed in the literature. However,
in most of the existing work the decision process is based
on a single monolithic decision engine, and with no regard

to the trafﬁc type. Furthermore, only a limited number of
decision parameters are generally considered. The restriction
on the number of decision parameters seems to be due to
the fact that as the number of decision parameters increases,
the number of decision rules increases exponentially, which
leads to computational complexity and very long algorithm
execution time (τ). Despite these constraints the QoS-related
parameters (latency, jitter and packet loss) need to be included
in the decision process, if real-time services (VoIP, video
streaming, etc.) are demanded by the users (noting the global
demand for real-time services).
To address the above issues, we proposed an adaptive
trafﬁc dependent fuzzy-based HDS (ATDHDS) in our previous
publication [1]. The performance of the proposed ATDHDS
was compared, in terms of the network selection and τ, with
monolithic fuzzy-based HDS (MHDS), tailored MHDS and
Simple Additive Weighting (SAW). The simulation results
showed that the ATDHDS gave an improvement in terms of
network selection and a reduction in the value of τ. However,
the simulation model did not take into account the fact that the
output scores generated by the fuzzy engines follow a random
process (the input parameter values are randomly selected). In
this paper a statistical averaging procedure is included, which
produces more reliable results. In addition, the WiMAX data
range is extended from (3 - 6 Mbps) to (1 - 6 Mbps) to
represents a more realistic WiMAX capability.
The ATDHDS is further enhanced by introducing two new
fuzzy engines, which perform a QoS aggregation process.
The aims of the Enhanced ATDHDS are to improve the
overall network selection performance and, at the same time,
to further reduce τ. The results suggest that the Enhanced
ATDHDS gives some improvements in the network selection
performance but huge beneﬁt in reducing τ.
Finally, the battery consumption analysis is carried out and
the results suggest that the power consumption of the proposed
fuzzy-based algorithm is unlikely to have a major impact on
the battery life in real-life implementations.
The paper is organized as follows. Related vertical handover
decision algorithms are given in Section II. In Section III, the
design and development of a monolithic fuzzy-based HDS and
the adaptive trafﬁc dependent fuzzy-based HDS are presented.
The simulation results and comparisons of performance are
also given in Section III. The design and development of
the enhanced adaptive trafﬁc dependent HDS is presented
in Section IV. A comparison between the ATDHDS and
Enhanced ATDHDS and the battery life analysis are also given
in Section IV. Section V gives conclusions and future work.
II. RELATED VERTICAL HANDOVER DECISION
ALGORITHMS
Numerous vertical handover decision algorithms have been
developed over the past several years [2]–[4]. They have vary-
ing degree of complexity and intelligence. These algorithms
can be broadly classiﬁed into two categories: deterministic
algorithms and heuristic algorithms. The former algorithms use
mathematical functions to select the best candidate wireless
network for handover, whilst decisions in the latter algorithms
are made on the basis of some pre-deﬁned decision (IF-
THEN) rules, which identify the inter-relationships of the
decision parameters considered. Mathematic-based algorithms
are simple to use but suffer from two limitations: 1) it is
often difﬁcult to acquire very precise data [5], as a result, the
network selection performance is degraded, 2) the methods
used for assigning the parameter weight to individual decision
parameters are subjective [6], as a result, the outcomes are
often inconsistent.
Heuristic algorithms (e.g., rule-based, fuzzy logic, neu-
ral network and Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System
(ANFIS)) follow a different decision making approach and
therefore avoid the drawbacks suffered by the deterministic
algorithms. Fuzzy logic, in general, is regarded to have the
ability to enhance intelligence in decision making processes.
It has been widely used for decision making processes in many
different areas, e.g., business forecasting [7] and stock trading
[8]. More speciﬁc to handover in wireless networks, fuzzy-
based algorithms have been used in a handover triggering
algorithm [9]; pre-processing of imprecise input data for
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) [10] and Simple Additive
Weighting (SAW) algorithms [11]. The use of fuzzy logic in
all the above applications has been only to assist handover
decision engines.
A number of researchers have focused their attention on
developing fuzzy-based vertical handover decision algorithms
[12], [13]. A fuzzy-based vertical handover decision algorithm,
which assumes interconnection between WLAN and WMAN,
is proposed in [14]. The decision parameters considered are:
RSS, data rate, distance. The main aim of this work is to
minimize the number of packet loss and the results presented
are encouraging.
Authors in [15] have proposed a network selection algorithm
based on fuzzy logic assuming three wireless technologies
(Cellular, WiMAX and WLAN). The algorithm takes RSS,
network load and available bandwidth into consideration. The
results suggest that the proposed algorithm can select the most
appropriate wireless network for handover in a given scenario.
In [16], a fuzzy-based algorithm between WWAN and
WLAN is proposed. RSS, bandwidth, usage price are included
in the decision process. The results show that the proposed
algorithm makes accurate handover decisions, reduces the
number of unnecessary handovers, balances network resources
and improves network performance.
In all the above solutions, no QoS-related decision parame-
ters (i.e., latency, jitter and packet loss) have been considered
in the decision process. In view of the growing demand
for real-time mobile applications, which require guaranteed
QoS (deﬁned by commonly used recommendations [17]), it
has become necessary to include the QoS parameters in the
decision process. More recently, efforts have been directed to
evaluate the performance of a HDS in the presence of multiple
QoS parameters.
In [18], bit error rate (BER) and RSS have been considered
in their fuzzy-related decision algorithm. The results show

improvement in terms of the number of handover reduction.
In [19], a fuzzy-based vertical handover algorithm taking data
rate, delay and BER (along with other parameters such as cost
and security) into consideration is proposed. The algorithm im-
proves the process of wireless network selection, thus avoiding
unnecessary handovers. Authors in [20] have proposed a QoS
aware fuzzy-based vertical handover mechanism that considers
data rate, latency, jitter and BER. The proposed work is found
to be effective for selecting a wireless network that meets
the requirements of different applications. The results show
a reduction in average end-to-end delay and yield a moderate
average bandwidth.
The above work clearly suggests that including QoS-related
parameters improves the overall decision performance. This
inevitably increases the overall number of decision parameters,
which generally leads to an unacceptably long algorithm exe-
cution time (τ). The time delay as a result of long τ imposes
a serious restriction on the number of decision parameters that
can be used in fuzzy-based decision algorithms. Thus, a new
approach is needed that allows a relatively large number of
decision parameters to be included and, at the same time,
minimizes τ.
III. ADAPTIVE TRAFFIC DEPENDENT FUZZY-BASED HDS
DESIGN
We introduced the idea of trafﬁc dependency and proposed
an adaptive trafﬁc dependent fuzzy-based handover decision
system design (ATD design) in our previous published work
[1]. The network selection performance of the ATD design
was compared with a conventional monolithic fuzzy-based
handover decision system (MHDS design) and a tailored
MHDS designs. The ATD design was shown to have given
signiﬁcant improvement for the network selection process as
well as a hugh reduction in τ.
In our previous work [1], the simulation model did not
take into account the fact that the output scores generated
by the fuzzy engines follow a random process (the input
parameter values are randomly selected). In this paper a
statistical averaging procedure has been used to produce more
reliable results.
In the new procedure, for each of the three trafﬁc types (i.e.,
CBR, VBR and ABR), 1000 runs of simulations (one trial,
T) were carried out by each HDS design. The performance
criterion chosen was the percentage success (PS), deﬁned as
the number of times (expressed as a percentage) the HDS
selected the wireless network that had the highest score
among the three wireless networks and fully satisﬁed the
QoS requirements. The QoS requirements for CBR and VBR
trafﬁcs were taken from [17]. In the case of ABR trafﬁc, the
packet loss of 7% or less was used. Ten trials were carried
out for each trafﬁc and the average of 10 trials was taken as
the ﬁnal outcome, as shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4.
In addition, the WiMAX data range was extended from (3 -
6 Mbps) to (1 - 6 Mbps) in the new simulation model, which
represents a more realistic WiMAX capability. The simulation
model assumed the following network and trafﬁc scenarios:
(i) Three wireless network technologies, namely, WLAN,
WiMAX and Cellular (supporting High Speed Packet
Access (HSPA), which supports data rate up to 7.2
Mbps).
(ii) One WLAN, one WiMAX and one Cellular to represent
a heterogeneous networking environment.
(iii) Three applications (VoIP, video streaming and ﬁle trans-
fer to represent CBR, VBR and ABR trafﬁcs, respec-
tively) - VoIP application with voice CODEC (G.711)
and a data rate of 64 kbps, video streaming application
in H.264 coding format with a bit rate of 0.8–1 Mbps
along with an encoded (ACC) audio signal at 96 kbps
and ﬁle transfer application with a bit rate of 1 Mbps.
The range of values for decision parameters in Tables I, II
and III were taken either from real-life tests or commonly used
standards [21]–[25].
The simulation results show that the ATD design gives
an improvement of 17.2% compared with the MHDS (MD1)
design in the case of VoIP trafﬁc (CBR trafﬁc), depicted in
Figure 2. However, the performance of tailored MHDS (MD2)
design is identical to that of ATD design. This is to be expected
as the two designs use identical FMFs and decision rules [1].
For the video streaming trafﬁc (VBR trafﬁc), depicted in
Figure 3, the performance of ATD design is 15.71% and
25.49% better than the MD1 and MD2 designs, respectively.
In the case of ﬁle transfer trafﬁc (ABR trafﬁc), the perfor-
mance of ATD design is 4.09% and 13.04% better than the
MD1 and MD2 designs, respectively (in Figure 4).
The network selection performance of Simple Additive
Weighting (SAW) algorithm is also compared with the ATD
design and the results are shown in Figures 5, 6 and 7.
The results show that the ATD design is 19.08%, 18.9% and
10.45% better than the SAW design for VoIP (in Figure 5),
video streaming (in Figure 6) and ﬁle transfer trafﬁcs (in

ATD design, the value of τ is 1.87 second, 0.56 second and
0.18 second for VoIP, video streaming and ﬁle transfer trafﬁcs,
respectively.
The results clearly show that the proposed ATD design
signiﬁcantly reduces τ for video streaming (VBR) and ﬁle
transfer (ABR) trafﬁcs when compared with MD1 and MD2
designs. The reduction in τ is 70.05% and 90.37% for video
streaming and ﬁle transfer trafﬁc, respectively. However, in
the case of VoIP, there is no improvement in the value of τ. It
is to be expected as the three HDS designs (MD1, MD2 and
ATD) employ the same number of decision rules.
Note that the τ of SAW design is lower than that of
ATD design since SAW algorithm uses a simple mathematical
function to calculate the score used for a decision making.
Although, the value of τ in the case of SAW design is
relatively low, the overall network selection performance of
the ATD design is superior to SAW design. Therefore, it is
more beneﬁcial to use fuzzy-based algorithms for a handover
decision.
IV. ENHANCED ATD DESIGN (EATD DESIGN)
The ATD design has been extended to include two addi-
tional fuzzy engines. The aims of the EATD design are: a)
to improve overall network selection performance and b) to
further reduce τ. The network selection performance of ATD
and EATD designs and the corresponding τ are compared.
The general architecture of enhanced adaptive trafﬁc de-
pendent fuzzy-based HDS (EATDHDS) is shown in Figure
9. The two new fuzzy engines, namely AQ-CBR and AQ-
VBR, convert individual values of QoS parameters into an
aggregated single value (AQ), i.e., AQCBR and AQVBR for
CBR and VBR trafﬁcs, respectively. In the case of ABR trafﬁc
only one QoS parameter (packet loss) is relevant, thus no QoS
aggregation is neccessary.
A. AQ-CBR and AQ-VBR Engines
Each engine contains a speciﬁc set of FMFs and decision
rules to match the corresponding trafﬁc. The Engine Selector
(ES) identiﬁes the type of incoming trafﬁc and the relevant

engine is selected to perform a QoS aggregation process,
which generates the corresponding AQ value (AQCBR or
AQV BR) as shown in Figure 10.
If VoIP (CBR) trafﬁc is identiﬁed, three QoS parameters
(latency (LA), jitter (JI) and packet loss (PL)), associated with
the candidate wireless network, are directed to the AQ-CBR
engine. The corresponding input fuzzy sets are denoted by
f
LA, f
JI, and g
PL. Each fuzzy set has three memberships (Low,
Medium, High). The total number of decision rules required
for this fuzzy engine is 27 (using equation 1 from [26]). Each
decision rule is then assigned a decision output, which is based
on expert knowledge. This process formulates an output fuzzy
set, g
AQCBR.
For video streaming (VBR) trafﬁc, only two QoS parameters
(i.e., latency (LA) and packet loss (PL)) are directed to the
AQ-VBR engine. The corresponding input fuzzy sets for the
VBR trafﬁc are denoted by f
LA, and g
PL. Following the above
principle, the total number of decision rules required for this
fuzzy engine is 9 (using equation 1 from [26]) and the output
fuzzy set is denoted by g
AQV BR.
The crisp inputs (the values for each QoS parameter) are
fuzziﬁed and provided to fuzzy inference system (FIS). The
aggregated fuzziﬁed data, µg
AQCBR and µg
AQV BR, are given
by (equation 4 from [26]):

Finally, defuzziﬁer converts the aggregated fuzziﬁed data

togerther with input decision parameters as shown in Figure

Triangular and trapezoidal functions are used for fuzzy
memberships in the design of input fuzzy sets for the AQ-
CBR and AQ-VBR engines. The associated FMFs are shown
in Figures 11 and 12. A small portion of the decision rules
for the two AQ engines is shown in Tables IV and V.

B. Modiﬁed ATD-CBR, Modiﬁed ATD-VBR and ATD-ABR
Decision Engines
As the QoS parameters are aggregated in the EATD design,
fewer inputs are needed for the decision engines, i.e., data rate,
usage price, battery life and AQCBR for the ATD-CBR decision
engine and data rate, usage price, battery life and AQVBR for
the ATD-VBR decision engine (as shown in Figure 9). As a
result, the existing ATD-CBR and ATD-VBR decision engine
designs needed to be modiﬁed. The ATD-ABR decision engine
is identical to the ATD-ABR decision engine presented in the
ATD design [1]. Note that due to the QoS aggregation process,
the input parameters to the modiﬁed ATD-CBR and modiﬁed
ATD-VBR decision engines have been reduced, which in turn

The defuzziﬁer converts the aggregated fuzziﬁed data into
the score (i.e., Cvalue, Vvalue and Avalue for the modiﬁed
ATD-CBR, modiﬁed ATD-VBR and ATD-ABR decision en-
gines, respectively) using the same principle as above (equa-
tion 3 and 4). The score (depending on the decision engine
used) is then used by the NRS to rank the wireless networks.
The wireless network with the highest score is selected for a
handover.
The associated FMFs for the modiﬁed ATD-CBR, modiﬁed
ATD-VBR and ATD-ABR decision engines are shown in
Figures 13, 14 and 15, respectively. A small portion of the
decision rules for the modiﬁed ATD-CBR and modiﬁed ATD-
VBR decision engines is shown in Table VI. Table VII shows a
small portion of the decision rules for the ATD-ABR decision
engine.
C. Simulation Results, Comparisons and Discussion
Based on the simulation procedure given in Section III, the
performance of EATD design was evaluated. The results are
compared with the ATD design in Figures 16 and 17 for VoIP
and video streaming trafﬁcs, respectively.
The results in Figure 16 show that the network selection
performance of the EATD design is 4.28% better than the
ATD design for VoIP trafﬁc. In the case of video streaming
trafﬁc (Figure 17), the improvement is 3.36%.
The algorithm execution time (τ) of the ATD and EATD
designs is also compared (shown in Figure 18) for the two
trafﬁc types (VoIP and video streaming). The results show
that τ of the EATD design is reduced to 0.25 second for VoIP
trafﬁc. This gives a reduction of 86.6% when compared with
the ATD design. In the case of video streaming trafﬁc, τ is
reduced to 0.21 second. A reduction of 62.5% is achieved.
The network selection performance is improved due to the
fact that fewer decision rules facilitate relatively more accurate
assignment of the corresponding decision outputs, which are
based on expert knowledge. The reduction in τ is due to QoS

D. Battery Consumption Analysis
Our comparison of fuzzy-based algorithms with SAW al-
gorithm reveals that the superiority of fuzzy-based algorithm
comes at a price, i.e., the algorithm execution time of even
the best (EATD) decision engine is higher than that required
by the SAW. This raises the issue of power consumption and

as shown in Figure 19 (this does not include the power
consumption of other components) before the battery needs
recharging.
If we now consider a processor that is actually used in
mobile devices (e.g., ARM Cortex A series of approximately
1.3 watts rating), the estimated power consumption reduces
to 0.00009 watt-hour. Assuming the same battery as above,
a smart phone can execute the algorithm for over 61,111
times (in Figure 19) before the need for recharging. Signif-
icant improvement in terms of battery consumption has been
observed here. Further improvements will come from the fact
that an actual mobile device is likely to use dedicated and
embedded software, or dedicated hardware (e.g., FPGA [27],
[28]) instead of MATLAB platform to run fuzzy algorithm.
This will further reduce τ and hence the power consumption.
E. Discussion
We have addressed the two main issues concerned with
the vertical handover decision mechanisms that are widely
proposed in the literature. In these mechanisms, a) a single
monolithic fuzzy decision engine is generally proposed, and
b) the decisions for network selection are made with no regard
to trafﬁc type. The former concern restricts the number of
decision parameters that can be included in the decision pro-
cess. This restriction arises due to the fact that as the number
of decision parameters increases, the number of decision rules
increases exponentially, resulting in computational complexity
and an unacceptably long algorithm execution time (τ). How-
ever, for real-time applications it becomes very important to
include the QoS-related parameters in the decision process,
which inevitably increases the overall number of decision
parameters. The latter concern impairs the quality of network
selection. This limitation on the network selection performance
arises due to the fact that a single monolithic decision engine
cannot possibly perform equally well for all the different types
of trafﬁcs.
In order to deal with the above issues we have suggested
an adaptive trafﬁc dependent handover decision system (AT-
DHDS). In our approach multiple decision engines, each
dedicated to a speciﬁc trafﬁc type, have been proposed. This
is achieved by tailoring FMFs to match the QoS requirements
of each individual trafﬁc type. As only those QoS parameters
that are relevant to a given trafﬁc type are included in the
corresponding decision engines, the number of decision rules
required for video streaming and ﬁle transfer trafﬁcs has
been reduced, compared with a typical monolithic fuzzy-based
handover decision system (MHDS). In the case of VoIP, the
two HDS designs have the same number of decision rules. The
simulation results show that the ATD design gives a signiﬁcant
improvement in terms of network selection performance and
a reduction in τ.
The ATD design has been further enhanced by introducing
additional fuzzy engines, which perform a QoS aggregation
process for the CBR and VBR trafﬁcs. The additional fuzzy
engines allow the total number of decision rules required
for the enhanced ATD design (EATD design) to be further
reduced, which leads to further reduction in τ. Furthermore,
fewer decision rules facilitate relatively more accurate assign-
ment of the decision outputs of fuzzy decision engines. As a
result, the network selection performance has been enhanced
and the value of τ has been further reduced (for the CBR and
VBR trafﬁcs).
Finally, the battery life analysis has been carried out and it
has been shown that the power consumption of the proposed
fuzzy-based algorithm is unlikely to have a major impact on
the battery life in real-life implementations.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In our previous work, we introduced the idea of trafﬁc
dependency and proposed an adaptive trafﬁc dependent fuzzy-
based handover decision system (ATDHDS). In this paper, a
new simulation model, which includes a statistical averaging
procedure, has been used in order to produce more reliable
simulation results.
For evaluation and comparison purposes, three handover
decision system designs, namely MHDS design 1 (MD1),
MHDS design 2 (MD2) and ATD design, have been developed.
Assuming a heterogeneous networking environment and three
trafﬁc types (CBR, VBR and ABR), simulation results have
been produced to compare the network selection performance
and the algorithm execution time of the three HDS designs.
In addition, the performance of SAW design has also been
compared with the ATD design.
In terms of the network selection performance, the simula-
tion results show that the ATD design gives an improvement of
17.2%, 15.71% and 4.09% for VoIP, video streaming and ﬁle
transfer trafﬁcs, respectively when compared with MD1, and
19.08%, 18.9% and 10.45% for VoIP, video streaming and
ﬁle transfer trafﬁcs, respectively when compared with SAW
design.
In the case of VoIP the network selection performance of
ATD and MD2 is identical as the two designs use identical

128
International Journal on Advances in Networks and Services, vol 7 no 1 & 2, year 2014, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/

FMFs and decision rules. However, the ATD design is 25.49%
and 13.04% better than the MD2 design for video streaming
and ﬁle transfer trafﬁcs, respectively. This result clearly sug-
gests that comparing with MD1, the performance of MD2 has
degraded for video streaming and ﬁle transfer trafﬁcs. The
reason for this degradation is that the FMFs and decision rules
used for the video steaming and ﬁle transfer trafﬁcs are in fact
tailored to match the VoIP trafﬁc. In other words, the MD2
design is biased towards VoIP trafﬁc, hence rendering this
design less attractive for the other two trafﬁcs. We conclude
that for optimum performance the FMFs and the decision rules
must be matched to each individual trafﬁc type.
In terms of τ, the results show that the ATD design gives an
improvement of over 70% and 90% for video streaming and
ﬁle transfer trafﬁcs, respectively when compared with MD1
and MD2 designs. In the case of VoIP, τ has the same value
for all the three designs, since the three designs use the same
number of decision rules for VoIP trafﬁc.
The ATD design has been further enhanced to include a QoS
aggregation process. The EATD design has been presented
and the performance compared. The simulation results show
that the network selection performance of EATD design is
4.28% and 3.36% better than that of the ATD design for VoIP
and video streaming trafﬁcs, respectively. At the same time
a reduction of 86.6% and 62.5% in the value of τ has been
achieved by the EATD design for VoIP and video streaming
trafﬁcs, respectively.
Future work will focus on further enhancement of intelli-
gence of the decision mechanisms, especially when mobility
related parameters are considered (e.g., velocity, coverage area,
distance, direction of movement, etc.). It is envisaged that
the algorithm execution time will be even a greater challenge
when mobility related parameters are included in the decision
process. Thus, development of new algorithms that require
signiﬁcantly reduced execution time will be part of our future
work.
