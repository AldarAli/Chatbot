Abstract— Phononic crystal sensors that have been developed 
in the last years proof being a promising sensor platform for 
different applications as liquid sensors. It has been already 
shown that the transmission spectrum of phononic structures 
depends on properties of liquids confined within a crystal. In 
comparison to known established sensor approaches, where 
sensors respond to near surface effects such as mass load, the 
distinguishing feature of proposed solutions is confining the 
liquid in resonant cavities of the phononic structure allowing 
determination of volumetric (bulk) properties of the liquid. 
Current contribution presents technological and experimental 
results of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) based phononic 
crystal liquid sensor research. The presented sensor concept 
integrates an array of periodical microfluidic channels into the 
SAW platform. Theoretical predictions underline strong 
demands 
regarding 
tolerances 
of 
phononic 
structure 
dimensions. As a result, the technological process of the sensor 
manufacturing had to be redesigned in a certain manner. 
Achieved results, technological challenges and solutions are 
described in current work. 
Keywords- phononic crystal sensor; liquid sensor; SAW 
sensor.

 INTRODUCTION 
Developed in recent years phononic crystal liquid sensors 
[1–4] vividly demonstrate advantages of this sensor 
approach. It is necessary to move the sensor to higher 
probing frequencies in order to achieve a higher sensitivity. 
The realization of the sensor in the frequency range of 
100 MHz till several gigahertz requires application of 
different platforms for excitation and detection of acoustic 
waves. This frequency range is well developed with respect 
to surface acoustic waves (SAW) devices. The experimental 
verification of phononic crystal structures (PnC) in 
piezoelectric materials introduces well-known fabrication 
challenges. We are specifically interested in the development 
of SAW PnC liquid sensors. In comparison to well-
established SAW sensor approaches, where the sensor effect 
is gained from surface effects (such as a surface mass load 
caused by absorption of analyte molecules in a recognition 
layer), the most promising feature of this high frequency 
sensor class is its capability to measure a sound velocity and 
a bulk viscosity of liquids with a precision superior to 
established instruments. It applies an acoustic signal 
amplification of a resonant liquid-filled cavity. The 
objectives of current research are the design of a SAW based 
phononic crystal sensor with at least one element being a 
liquid, and its fabrication with a high accuracy. 
Originally, two different schemes were applied for 
building of the sensor, structures, i.e., holes and channels that 
are etched into the piezoelectric material and similar 
structures etched into an overlayer or a set of overlayers 
deposited onto the piezoelectric crystal.  
Within the first approach, the etching of deep structures 
with steep sidewalls is required. This concept was initially 
developed towards SAW based phononic crystal sensor 
realization and was previously described in details [5].

phononic crystal in quartz.

Top edges and sidewalls allow for an idealization as a 
hole. The known limitation lies in complexity of structuring 
strong piezoelectric materials such as of lithium niobate 
(LiNbO3) or lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) substrate in a quality 
that is required to achieve an efficient structure. [5] 
However, this approach requires a piezoelectric material  
that contrasts some sensor requirements. We report on the 
development of alternative sensor approaches. As a result, 
the 
sensor 
concept 
applies 
polymer 
based 
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology with a 
specific attention to an exceptional tolerances control was 
developed. It utilizes the structure that has been fabricated in 
overlayers instead of etched into the substrate. This approach 
allows selecting a structure material independent on the 
substrate. The schematic representation of the sensor 
utilizing this concept is demonstrated in Figure 2.

overlayer structures 
The manufacture of designed structure can be completed 
within different approaches. The manufacturing processes 
can be split into a solid state based and a polymer based one. 
A technology based on a solid state approach introduces 
several advantages, such as a high long term mechanical 
stability, application of well-established processes etc. 
However, for the proposed sensor design this approach 
appeared to be complicated for a fabrication. On the other 
hand, the polymer based technological approach opens an 
opportunity for a rapid prototyping at a relatively low cost 
and allows to simplify the technological process in general. 
Among all possible technological processes that can be 
based 
on 
Polyimid, 
polydimethylsiloxane 
(PDMS), 
Poly(methyl 
methacrylate) 
(PMMA) 
or 
epoxy-based 
negative photoresist SU-8, the chosen approach must satisfy 
initial design demands. At the same time, the respective 
technology should be adjusted in a way to obtain an expected 
sensor structure performance. 
The SU-8 negative photoresist is currently widely applied 
as a construction material for microfluidic devices, sensors 
and other applications. Due to number of advantages, such as 
chemical stability to most of fluids, controllable mechanical 
properties through the crosslinking process management, this 
photoresist can be applied for building of microfluidic 
structures for a variety of different applications [6]. 
Therefore, we have realized SU-8 based microfluidic 
structures integrated into a SAW device. A set of 
microfluidic channels acts as a liquid analyte container. They 
are periodically arranged as PnC. Several initial designs and 
influence of a phononic structure geometry on the sensor 
performance were previously discussed [7]. Despite the 
possibility of a further structure improvement, in current 
contribution we concentrate on the manufacture of designed 
structures. 
In order to achieve a mechanical performance required 
for designed structures, technological parameters of SU-8 
processing have to be reconsidered. Previously, an influence 
of technological parameters of SU-8 processing on 
mechanical properties of SU-8 layers have been studied [8–
11]. It also was demonstrated that considering a certain 
application, SU-8 layer can be differently manufactured in 
order to fulfill defined requirements. Due to staged SU-8 
processing, different improvements can be made by 
changing some of the conditions of certain technological 
steps. As it was shown in [10], the number of such 
technological parameters that directly influence on final SU-
8 layer performance can exceed thirty. Thereby, it becomes 
evident that with the consideration of certain application of 
SU-8 structures, processing parameters have to be adjusted 
in order to obtain required performance. 
The study of influencing of tensile properties of coated 
SU-8 layers has demonstrated that an increase of SU-8 
curing 
temperature 
significantly 
changes 
mechanical 
properties of SU-8 layers [8]. It was shown that high 
temperature curing of SU-8 during a post exposure bake 
(PEB, 95 °C) and hard bake (HB, 200 °C) make layers much 
more fragile. Previously published results [9] have shown 
that changes in SU-8 processing can considerably influence 
following SU-8 crosslinking. It was demonstrated how a soft 
bake conditions, an exposure dose and a post exposure bake 
parameters influence on a resolution and crack formations of 
SU-8 layers because of inner SU-8 film stress accumulated 
during processing. In [10] was shown that at low soft bake 
temperature an exposed SU-8 polymerizes at faster rate with 
reduced stress. Completely crack free structures with aspect 
ratios of 10 and 8 for trench and ridge structures have been 
achieved with the soft bake temperature of 65 °C. 
In order to complete closed microfluidic channels, the 
SU-8 adhesive bonding process should be performed. On the 
one hand, it is required to achieve well-defined structures. 
On the other hand, the fabrication process should be kept 
within several standard technological steps without necessity 
to implement complicated approaches. For this reason, the 
SU-8 bonding recipe has to be adjusted. In order to achieve a 
sufficient performance of bonding process, the polymer 
crosslinking reactions of bonding wafers should be taken 
under control. It was already shown that in order to achieve a 
sufficient bonding strength, it is necessary to apply the wafer 
with incompletely cross-linked SU-8 in order to perform a 
final mutual crosslinking step during the bonding process. At 
the same time, SU-8 should be sufficiently crosslinked to 
complete developing process.

sensors assessment are presented. In section II, the

technological description of sensor manufacturing process is 
provided in details. In section III, the information regarding 
the sensor experimental setup is described. Achieved 
experimental results and a future work are underlined in 
subsequent sections “Discussion” and “Conclusions”.

TECHNOLOGY 
For the fabrication of the sensor structure, following 
materials were utilized. Titanium and aluminum targets were 
used in physical vapor deposition (PVD) sputtering process 
and supplied by a local manufacturer. Structuring of metal 
layers was completed applying TI35ES positive photoresist 
in conjunction with TI Prime adhesive promoter that were 
supplied by MicroChemicals GmbH. AZ and AZ400K 
photoresist developers as well as acetone, isopropanol, 
aluminum etcher, 1-propanol and other supplies were 
ordered from Carl Roth GmbH and Sigma-Aldrich Chemie 
GmbH. Applied for structuring of microfluidic channels SU-
8-50 photoresist and mr600Dev developer were supplied by 
Micro Resist Technology GmbH.  
The deposition of metal layers was completed with LS 
500 ES physical vapor deposition equipment. For photoresist 
spin coating, SUSS Labspin manufacturing line was utilized 
with SUSS_MA6_BA6 mask aligner. Processes of SU-8 
adhesive bonding were conducted in SUSS SB6E substrate 
bonder. Manufactured SAW based phononic crystal sensors 
were analyzed with Zeiss EVO 50 scanning electron 
microscope and FTR MicroProf 300 profilometer. 
The technological process of a SAW based phononic 
crystal liquid sensor manufacturing begins with fabrication 
and analysis of SAW structures. According to the sensor 
design, the lithium niobate (LiNbO3) 128° Y-X cut wafers 
with X direction of the wave propagation were chosen as a 
substrate material. In order to excite and detect surface 
acoustic waves, the interdigitated transducers (IDTs) have 
been manufactured on the surface of the substrate. 
The manufacture of phononic structure was completed 
atop of fabricated IDTs. The phononic structure represents a 
system of periodically placed microfluidic channels closed 
from the top and the bottom with another polymer structure. 
In current work, the microfluidic structure and covering 
(interfacial) layers were fabricated utilizing SU-8 polymer. 
The structure manufacturing process involves subsequent 
layer after layer processing. In order to complete the 
structure, the wafer should be processed with two structured 
SU-8 layers. Initially interfacial SU-8 layer has to be defined 
atop of the IDTs area and then the microfluidic channels 
should be structured atop. 
An application of polymer based bonding technology 
was utilized for manufacturing of a covering layer. The 
covering layer was fabricated on a silicon wafer basis and 
then transferred to the structure. The omnicoat releasing 
layer was utilized to remove the handling wafer. SU-8 50 
covering layer was then spin coated and soft baked at the 
temperature 65°C during 3 minutes. Thereafter, the 
temperature was ramped up to 85°C at which the wafer was 
baked another 10 minutes. At the completion of the soft 
bake, the wafer was cooled down back to the room 
temperature during 40 minutes. Then, fabricated SU-8 layer 
was exposed with an exposure dose of 160 mJ/cm2 in 
SUSS_MA6_BA6 mask aligner. The post exposure bake of 
the covering layer was made at the temperature of 65°C 
during 2 minutes with following ramping up to 85°C where 
it was baked another 10 minutes and then cooled down to the 
room temperature during 40 minutes. After a completion of 
the covering layer, another thin layer of SU-8 5 that serve as 
an adhesive during bonding process was spin coated. As 
soon as the layer is pilled off, it was removed and rinsed in 
deionized water (DI-water). Afterwards, dried covering layer 
was applied for bonding process. 
The bonding process starts with evacuating of the 
camera. During the preheating step at the temperature of 
45°C during 3 minutes, the rest of the surface contaminations 
and SU-8 solvents supposed to be removed. After that, the 
structure was top loaded with a pressure of 1000 mBar and 
heated up to 50°C. At this temperature, the structure was 
bonded during 10 minutes and then slowly cooled down back 
to the room temperature. Thereafter, bonded with covering 
layer wafer was exposed with an exposure dose of 
160 mJ/cm2. Afterwards, it was post exposure baked at the 
temperature of 65°C during 2 minutes and 85°C for 10 
minutes with following cooling down back to the room 
temperature during 40 minutes. 
Completed example of SU-8 microfluidic channel is 
demonstrated in Figure 3.

EXPERIMENTAL 
Experimental investigations of the manufactured sensor 
were completed with the help of probe station SUSS EP6 
with high frequency probes, Figure 4. A complete 4” 
LiNbO3 128° Y-X cut wafer with IDTs and integrated 
microfluidic structures was placed on a probing table. High 
frequency probes (2 signal probes and 2 ground probes) were 
connected with a help of 50 Ohm up to 500 MHz coaxial 
cables with network analyzer in S-parameters measuring 
mode. The structure was connected as a standard 2-port 
SAW device. Analyzed liquid was manually placed in 
microfluidic structure with a micropipette. Transmission (S21 
parameter) amplitude and phase response were measured 
with Agilent4395A together with an S-parameter test set 
Agilent 87511A (100 kHz–500 MHz). Several subsequent

measurements were performed to reduce a measurement 
error. The repeatable sensor response was recorded for each 
measuring liquid mixture.

Measurements were completed with binary mixtures of a 
deionized water and a 1-propanol in molar concentrations 
(X) range 0.23 – 0.507 that corresponds to the range of the 
most linear speed of sound dependence. The respective speed 
of sound and density data for water – 1-propanol mixtures 
are shown in Table 1.

RESULTS 
As it can be seen, the amplitude and phase measurement 
results provide a distinct sensor response on different liquids 
that filled into the microfluidic channels Figure 5-6.

The amplitude minima as well as the corresponding 
phase shift demonstrate a tendency to move in a direction of 
lower frequencies when the microfluidic channel is filled 
with a liquid with lower speed of sound. The dependence of 
phononic crystal sensor response on speed of sound of the 
liquid constituting the PnC or filling the defect (such as 
cavity) were previously demonstrated [2, 4, 13, 14]. It has 
been shown that frequency of corresponding transmission 
peak (or dip) depends mostly on changes in speed of sound 
of the liquid analyte rather than on changes in density or 
viscosity. However, in the reported case, it should be noted 
that transmission curves have two clear transmission minima 
that behave differently, Figure 5. The (local) transmission 
minimum frequencies depend on the molar ratio of 1-
propanol in water in a similar manner; however, the band 
width of the second one is much broader than the first one. 
Both, band width and amplitude change considerably with 
molar ratio. As characteristic for a dissipation mechanism, 
bandwidth decreases with an increasing depth of the dip in 
the spectrum. We assume that the second minimum 
corresponds to a complex vibration of the polymer structure 
with different contributions from the microfluidic liquid 
resonator and overlayers and radiation or mode conversion 
losses.  
The phase shift results match to the transmission 
amplitude response, Figure 6. It can be seen that the first 
phase shift corresponding to the first minimum is much 
sharper than the second one. Although we note a slight 
difference in slope we find a shift to a lower frequency when 
microfluidic channels are filled with liquids with decreasing 
speed of sound for the first transmission minima consistent 
with the amplitude findings. The phase corresponding to the 
broad band minima crosses at a frequency of about 
24.31 MHz. However, this finding is also just a consequence 
of a change in wave attenuation. 
The physical understanding is subject of ongoing 
research, specifically the analysis of the involvement of 
complex vibration mechanisms and their interaction with 
waves.

CONCLUSIONS 
The alternative approach for phononic crystal based 
sensors has been demonstrated. The SAW sensor platform 
serves as a reliable sensor platform for frequencies of several 
tens megahertz with good perspectives in a range to several 
hundreds of megahertz and perhaps up to a few gigahertz, 
very much depending on accuracy issues in fabrication of the 
downscaled feature sizes. In comparison to traditional SAW 
sensors, the phononic crystal SAW sensor can be applied to 
liquids and is sensitive to volumetric material properties such 
as speed of sound of an analyte. Our alternative overlay 
technology approach can be considered as a replacement of 
the technologically challenging approach that is based on 
realization of PnC structures directly in piezoelectric 
substrates. The experimental results demonstrate the 
feasibility of described approach. It provides a distinct and 
predictable sensor response on speed of sound of binary 
mixture of water and 1-propanol.
