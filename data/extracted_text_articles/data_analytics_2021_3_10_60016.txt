Abstract—The COVID-19 pandemic has spread around the 
world and had significantly affected every aspect of our day-to-
day lives. Non-clinical socioeconomic factors may be important 
explanatory variables of COVID-19 cases and deaths.  This 
work explores the correlations between various socioeconomic 
factors and the number of cases and deaths resulting from 
COVID-19. The study was conducted with county-level data 
from the U.S. Census Bureau and John Hopkins University, 
and examined the impact of ten different socioeconomic factors 
regarding population size, poverty, median household income, 
employment and education levels on COVID-19 prevalence 
across all counties in the United States. Correlation coefficients 
were computed between each of the socioeconomic factors and 
the total number of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths 
using various correlation analysis methods such as the 
Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman formulas. The results of the 
analyses echo the findings of similar research regarding 
COVID-19 and are visualized and discussed. 
Keywords- COVID-19; socioeconomic factors; correlation

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Coronavirus 
disease-19 
(COVID-19) 
is 
a 
novel 
coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in 
early December of 2019 [1]. Since its discovery, COVID-19 
has affected world economies and lives across the globe. 
Due to the unknown and rapidly developing nature of the 
pandemic, governments, scientists and researchers have been 
working nonstop to develop a vaccine and understand more 
about this novel virus.  
So far, old age and pre-existence of chronic conditions 
have been linked to more severe COVID-19 symptoms [2]. 
Other 
potential 
factors 
such 
as 
race/ethnicity 
and 
socioeconomic factors may also play an important role in the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The socioeconomic gradient in health 
is ubiquitous and has been described across pathologies, in 
life expectancy and mortality [3]. Low income might affect 
living conditions in many ways, such as residence in more 
deprived neighborhoods and housing conditions. A lower 
education level can be indirectly associated with several 
factors that may increase the risk of developing severe forms 
of COVID-19. However, the influence of socioeconomic 
factors on COVID-19 transmission, severity and outcomes is 
not yet known and is subject to scrutiny and investigation.  
This study aims to identify any correlation between 
various socioeconomic factors and the number of cases and 
deaths resulting from COVID-19 across all counties in the 
United States. For this research, many socioeconomic data 
sets were considered and included various topics such as 
poverty, race, income, method of transportation, and more. 
The data for some factors, such as method of transportation 
to work and field of occupation, were not available on a 
granular level and were excluded from the analyses. Out of 
these many factors, ten were chosen to be considered for the 
correlation analysis. These socioeconomic factors were 
selected to correlate with COVID-19 cases and deaths due to 
their high data availability and novelty, Federal Information 
Processing Standards (FIPS) code-level data granularity, and 
prevalence in existing pandemic research. These factors are 
(1) total population size, (2) median household income, (3) 
population and percentage of population in poverty, (4) total 
employed population size, (5) total unemployed population 
size, (6) unemployment rate, (7) population and percentage 
of population without a high school diploma, (8) population 
and percentage of population with only a high school 
diploma, (9) population and percentage of population with 
some college education or an associate’s degree, (10) 
population and percentage of population with a bachelor’s 
degree or higher. This work explores each socioeconomic 
factor separately and analyzes the relationship with COVID-
19 cases and deaths. The ten socioeconomic factors were 
grouped together based on the socioeconomic topic they fall 
under, which resulted in four groups: population size, income 
and poverty, employment, and education. Socioeconomic 
status might be one determinant that can tell us which 
regions are more vulnerable and high risk to the coronavirus 
disease. If we can find correlations between socioeconomic 
factors and COVID-19 outcomes, the findings will be useful 
in determining what regions may benefit most from a 
strategic allocation of health care resources. 
This research used official county-level data sets 
gathered from the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) [4], and John Hopkins University [5]. 
The COVID-19 data sets provided by John Hopkins 
University contain time-series data for cumulative COVID-
19 related cases and deaths, separated by county. 
Socioeconomic data sets provided by the U.S. Census 
Bureau and processed by the USDA contain data regarding 
education, population, poverty, and unemployment for each 
county of the United States in 2019.  
The biggest challenge encountered when conducting this 
research was determining the best way to quantify the 
relationship between socioeconomic factors and COVID-19 
33

cases and deaths. There are many different data mining tasks 
that could lead to interesting results, such as rule-based 
classification, time-series analysis, or clustering [6]. Another 
challenge of this research was determining how to correlate 
socioeconomic factors with COVID-19 cases and deaths. 
Quantitative values for socioeconomic factors are gathered 
infrequently and represent a value for a certain point in time 
(e.g., percentage of population in poverty in 2019). COVID-
19 cases and deaths, on the other hand, take the form of a 
time-series with high variations in case and death frequency. 
These variations can be attributed to the time of the year, 
trends in social distancing, and changes in government 
ordinances. The last difficulty was that data on individual-
level socioeconomic position are not being collected. The 
World Health Organization standard COVID-19 case report 
form only asks for each patient’s age, sex/gender, place 
where the case was diagnosed, and usual place of residence. 
This impedes the sophisticated analysis of impact of 
socioeconomic factors. 
This study uses Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman 
correlation 
coefficients 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
the 
relationships between socioeconomic factors and COVID-19 
cases and deaths. By analyzing each socioeconomic factor 
separately, we investigated which factors most strongly 
correlate to COVID-19 cases and deaths. This research 
differentiates itself by using various correlation methods and 
is novel in the sense that the data being analyzed is more 
accurate due to its granularity. Similar research in this field 
has been done by using state-level data, but the data in this 
research is at the county level. Our analysis results offer 
some interesting findings. Visualization is also used to 
determine which geographical regions of the country are 
most vulnerable in the event of a pathogenic outbreak.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Recently, there has been an abundance of research with 
respect to COVID-19 and data analysis. Applications for 
COVID-19 include COVID-19 detection and diagnosis, 
tracking and identification of the outbreak, infodemiology, 
biomedicine, and pharmacotherapy [7]. This section 
describes some related work in the field of statistically 
driven COVID-19 analysis. 
Kurian et al. [8] evaluated the correlation between 
COVID-19 cases and Google Trends data on a state-by-state 
basis using the Pearson correlation method. Their findings 
suggest that certain keywords searched online were linked to 
high COVID-19 activity in the time leading up to spikes in 
cases, such as face mask, Lysol, and COVID stimulus check.  
Shi et al. [9], using data on occupational position from 
484 COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province of China, 
reported that severe cases were more likely to be agricultural 
workers and less likely to be self-employed than mild cases. 
Oh et al. [10] analyzed various socioeconomic factors of the 
South Korean population using a multivariable logistic 
regression model to determine if a lower socioeconomic 
standing increases the risk of contracting COVID-19. 
Huang et al. [11] used k-means clustering (k = 3) to show 
how 
socioeconomically 
disadvantaged 
groups 
were 
disproportionately affected by stay-at-home orders. The 
results of their research showed that those who were more 
likely to stay at home were typically white, wealthy, well 
educated, and resided in regions with low unemployment and 
high median household income. Research conducted by 
Hawkins et al. [12] echoed these findings, where regions 
with low socioeconomic status are shown to have higher 
rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths.  
Burton et al. [13] found that African Americans have 
been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. African 
American patients in the study were also found to be 
associated with older age, reside in a low-income area, and 
have a higher obesity rate. In turn, these socioeconomic 
factors contributed to their risk of contracting COVID-19. 
Gangemi et al. [14] also analyzed different socioeconomic 
factors to determine if significant correlations could be 
identified. They discovered that Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) per capita and number of flights per capita were 
significantly correlated to the number of COVID-19 cases on 
a country-level basis. 
Hatef et al. [15] developed an Area Deprivation Index 
(ADI) to measure a ZIP code’s composite socioeconomic 
characteristics, using factors such as population size, age, 
gender, and race distribution. Populations in ZIP codes with 
higher ADI scores were found to be more at risk for COVID-
19 related cases and deaths than those in ZIP codes with low 
ADI scores. Roser [16] found that the Human Development 
Index (HDI), a composite score that measures life 
expectancy, access to education, and standard of living, is 
significantly correlated to the number of COVID-19 cases in 
a country. The Distressed Communities Index (DCI) [17], a 
comprehensive estimate of a location’s socioeconomic 
status, was used for analyzing COVID-19 case and fatality 
data in a Mann-Whitney U test. 
 
III. 
DATA AND DATA PREPROCESSING 
This section describes the data and data preprocessing in 
detail. 
A. Data 
Two main data sets were gathered from several sources 
for use in the correlation analyses. The first main data set 
contains county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths data and 
was provided by the COVID-19 Data Repository by the 
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John 
Hopkins University [5]. The COVID-19 Data Repository is a 
publicly available data source that contains county-level 
time-series data for cumulative COVID-19 related cases and 
deaths that is updated daily. The data presents 3,340 counties 
and county-equivalents. The time series data begins on 
January 22, 2020 and is updated daily. For this research, we 
used the data entries up until March 27, 2021. This date was 
34

DATA ANALYTICS 2021 : The Tenth International Conference on Data Analytics

selected to provide the most up-to-date correlation analyses. 
However, other dates such as thirty or ninety days after an 
outbreak has been identified may also be useful in 
determining how cases and deaths will continue to occur. 
The second main data was provided by the U.S. Census 
Bureau and processed by the Economic Research Service of 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture [4]. There are 3,193 
counties represented within this data set. We used the data of 
2019. The data set contains county-level data for various 
socioeconomic factors, including poverty levels, median 
household income, population size, employment levels, and 
education levels. For this research, the socioeconomic factors 
analyzed are:  
(1) total population size,  
(2) median household income,  
(3) population and percentage of population in poverty,  
(4) total employed population size,  
(5) total unemployed population size,  
(6) unemployment rate,  
(7) population and percentage of population without a high 
school diploma,  
(8) population and percentage of population with only a 
high school diploma,  
(9) population and percentage of population with some 
college education or an associate’s degree, 
(10) population and percentage of population with a 
bachelor’s degree or higher.  
B. Data Preprocessing 
The data sets were first pre-processed for easier 
formatting. In order to eliminate confusion that may stem 
from how certain county names could be stored (e.g., “St. 
Mary’s County” versus “Saint Marys County”), the data 
sources were merged based on FIPS codes [18], such that 
each FIPS code had a one-to-one relationship with each 
socioeconomic factor. FIPS codes were developed by the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology and are used 
to identify unique geographic regions such as states, 
counties, and county-equivalents (e.g., parishes, boroughs, 
and independent cities). Once the data sets were pre-
processed and merged based on FIPS, the data sets were 
formatted and prepared for conducting data analysis. 
 
IV. 
ANALYSIS METHODS 
The primary goal of this study is to determine to what 
degree relationships exist between various socioeconomic 
factors and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. 
Correlation coefficients were used in this research to 
determine the degree to which these relationships exist. 
Correlation is a value that describes the degree to which 
two variables are related [19]. A correlation coefficient falls 
within the range of -1 and 1. Correlation values closer to 1 
describe a positive correlation, which means that as one 
variable increases, the other variable also increases. 
Correlation values closer to -1 describe a negative 
correlation, which means that as one variable increases, the 
other variable decreases. Correlation values close to 0 have 
little to no correlation, with a very weak or nonexistent 
pattern to the two variables [20]. The three correlation 
analysis methods used in this research were the Pearson, 
Kendall, and Spearman methods.  
The Pearson correlation method is a parametric measure 
that produces a correlation coefficient r, which measures the 
direction and degree of relationships between pairs of 
variables. The Pearson correlation formula is shown below, 
where r is the correlation coefficient,  are the values of the 
first variable,  is the mean of the first variable, 
 are the 
values of the second variable, and 
 is the mean of the 
second variable [21]:  
 
 
 
The Kendall rank correlation method is a non-parametric 
measure that assesses the correspondence between the 
rankings of pairs of variables. The Kendall correlation 
formula is shown below, where r is the correlation 
coefficient, c is the number of concordant pairs, d is the 
number of discordant pairs, and n is the total number of 
points. For a pair of points (xi, yi) and (xj, yj), the pair is said 
to be concordant if xi > xj and yi > yj, or if xi < xj and yi < yj.. If 
neither condition is true, that pair is said to be discordant 
[22]: 
 
 
The Spearman rank correlation formula is another non-
parametric measure that determines the correlation between 
the ranks of pairs of variables. The Spearman correlation 
formula is shown below, where r is the correlation 
coefficient, di is the difference between the two ranks of each 
point, and n is the number of points [23]: 
 
 
 
Fahrudin et al. [24] suggest that the Kendall and 
Spearman correlation analysis methods are more appropriate 
for this type of research because they are non-parametric 
methods. These types of methods do not make any 
assumptions about the model of the data and can operate on 
incomplete data, making them better suited for uncertain and 
rapidly evolving events like pandemics.   
 
V. 
RESULTS 
Correlation coefficients were computed between each of 
the socioeconomic factors and the total number of 
cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths. Because correlation 
formulas determine the degree of association between two 
variables, the coefficients were calculated using one 
socioeconomic factor at a time. For each analysis, the 
Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman correlation methods were 
used. When discussing the results of the correlation analyses, 
we used the average of three correlation coefficients. Table 1

A. Relationship with Population Size 
First, 
we 
examined 
the 
correlation 
with 
the 
socioeconomic factor of (1) total population size. Total 
population size with regards to COVID-19 cases has 
correlation coefficients of 0.970086 (Pearson), 0.842793 
(Kendall), and 0.953558 (Spearman) with an average of 
0.922146. With regards to COVID-19 deaths, the correlation 
coefficients are 0.930995 (Pearson), 0.727279 (Kendall), and 
0.888893 (Spearman) with an average of 0.849055. The 
relationship between population size and COVID-19 cases 
and deaths has a very strong positive correlation. 
B. Relationship with Income and Poverty 
  Second, we examined the correlation with the 
socioeconomic factor of (2) median household income with 
COVID-19 cases and deaths. Median household income with 
regards to COVID-19 cases has correlation coefficients of 
0.220982 (Pearson), 0.220541 (Kendall), and 0.324824 
(Spearman) with an average of 0.255449.  With regards to 
COVID-19 deaths, the correlation coefficients are 0.188385 
(Pearson), 0.144611 (Kendall), and 0.214694 (Spearman) 
with an average of 0.182564. Both show weak positive 
correlations. Figure 1 shows the relationship between 
COVID-19 
cases 
and 
median 
house 
income. 
The 
socioeconomic factor is mapped in gray, with higher values 
being more gray and lower values being less gray. The 
number of COVID-19 cases by county are mapped in green, 
with counties having many cases being greener than counties 
with fewer cases. As shown in Figure 1, median household 
income is not a great indicator of the probability of 
contracting COVID-19. There are some regions with higher 
average household income that are greener, but not by a 
significant margin.  
Third, 
we 
examined 
the 
correlation 
with 
the 
socioeconomic factor of (3) population and percentage of 
population in poverty. The population size in poverty with 
regards to COVID-19 cases has correlation coefficients of 
0.956651 (Pearson), 0.776574 (Kendall), and 0.925292 
(Spearman), with an average of 0.886172. With regards to 
COVID-19 deaths, the correlation coefficients are 0.93817 
(Pearson), 0.731511 (Kendall), and 0.893441 (Spearman), 
with an average of 0.854374. Both show very strong positive 
correlations. In contrast, the percentage of a population in 
poverty with regards to COVID-19 cases has average 
correlation coefficients of -0.104471 and -0.044366, 
respectively, which show weak negative correlations.

C. Relationship with Employed and Unemployed 
Fourth, we then examined the correlation with the 
socioeconomic factor of (4) total employed population size. 
Employed population size with regards to COVID-19 cases 
has correlation coefficients of 0.964435 (Pearson), 0.824678 
(Kendall), and 0.945477 (Spearman) with an average of 
0.911530. With regards to COVID-19 deaths, the correlation 
coefficients are 0.921836 (Pearson), 0.704132 (Kendall), and 
0.872068 (Spearman) with an average of 0.832679. Both 
show very strong positive correlations.  
Fifth, 
we 
examined 
the 
correlation 
with 
the 
socioeconomic factor of (5) total unemployed population 
size. Unemployed population size with regards to COVID-19 
cases has correlation coefficients of 0.967212 (Pearson), 
0.795141 (Kendall), and 0.933167 (Spearman) with an 
average of 0.898507. With regards to COVID-19 deaths, the 
correlation coefficients are 0.942800 (Pearson), 0.707763 
(Kendall), and 0.875330 (Spearman) with an average of 
0.841964. Both also show a very strong positive correlation. 
Sixth, 
we 
examined 
the 
correlation 
with 
the 
socioeconomic factor of (6) unemployment rate. A region’s 
unemployment rate with regards to COVID-19 cases has 
correlation coefficients of -0.043564 (Pearson), -0.013928 
(Kendall), and -0.012187 (Spearman) with an average of  
-0.023227. With regards to COVID-19 deaths, the 
correlation coefficients are -0.018840 (Pearson), -0.025321 
(Kendall), and 0.042350 (Spearman) with an average of 
0.016277. They show a weak negative and weak positive 
correlation, respectively. 
D. Relationship with Education 
Seventh, we examined the correlation with the 
socioeconomic factor of (7) population and percentage of 
population with less than a high school diploma. The 
population size without a high school diploma with regards 
to COVID-19 cases has correlation coefficients of 0.965225 
(Pearson), 0.764172 (Kendall), and 0.918743 (Spearman), 
with an average of 0.882713. With regards to COVID-19 
36

DATA ANALYTICS 2021 : The Tenth International Conference on Data Analytics

deaths, the correlation coefficients are 0.945272 (Pearson), 
0.734748 (Kendall), and 0.897835 (Spearman), with an 
average of 0.859285. Both show a very strong positive 
correlation. In contrast, the percentage of a population 
without a high school diploma with regards to COVID-19 
cases and deaths has average correlation coefficients of  
-0.041244 and 0.017281, which show a weak negative and 
weak positive correlation, respectively. 
Eighth, 
we 
examined 
the 
correlation 
with 
the 
socioeconomic factor of (8) population and percentage of 
population with only a high school diploma. The population 
size with only a high school diploma with regards to 
COVID-19 cases has correlation coefficients of 0.959932 
(Pearson), 0.812512 (Kendall), and 0.943194 (Spearman), 
with an average of 0.905213. With regards to COVID-19 
deaths, the correlation coefficients are 0.938317 (Pearson), 
0.735719 (Kendall), and 0.89646 (Spearman), with an 
average of 0.856832. Both show a very strong positive 
correlation. In contrast, the percentage of a population with 
only a high school diploma with regards to COVID-19 cases 
and deaths has average correlation coefficients of -0.262308 
and -0.208336, which show a weak negative and weak 
positive correlation, respectively. 
Ninth, 
we 
examined 
the 
correlation 
with 
the 
socioeconomic factor of (9) population and percentage of 
population with some college education or an associate’s 
degree. The population size with some college education or 
an associate’s degree with regards to COVID-19 cases has 
correlation coefficients of 0.961137 (Pearson), 0.809469 
(Kendall), and 0.938058 (Spearman), with an average of 
0.902888. With regards to COVID-19 deaths, the correlation 
coefficients are 0.909433 (Pearson), 0.704526 (Kendall), and 
0.871939 (Spearman), with an average of 0.828633. Both 
show a very strong positive correlation. In contrast, the 
percentage of a population with some college education or an 
associate’s degree with regards to COVID-19 cases and 
deaths has average correlation coefficients of -0.113840 and 
-0.141439, respectively, which show weak negative 
correlations. 
 
 
Figure 2. Relationship of percentage of population with a bachelor’s degree 
or higher and COVID-19 Cases 
Lastly, 
we 
examined 
the 
correlation 
with 
the 
socioeconomic factor of (10) population and percentage of 
population with a bachelor’s degree or higher. The 
population size with a bachelor’s degree or higher with 
regards to COVID-19 cases has correlation coefficients of 
0.910476 (Pearson), 0.767488 (Kendall), and 0.912052 
(Spearman), with an average of 0.863339. With regards to 
COVID-19 deaths, the correlation coefficients are 0.882014 
(Pearson), 0.658304 (Kendall), and 0.831540 (Spearman), 
with an average of 0.790619. They show a very strong 
positive and strong positive correlation, respectively. In 
contrast, the percentage of a population with a bachelor’s 
degree or higher with regards to COVID-19 cases and deaths 
has average correlation coefficients of 0.290129 and 
0.225420, 
respectively, 
which 
show 
weak 
positive 
correlations. As shown in Figure 2, there is no significant 
relationship between the percentage of a population with a 
bachelor’s degree or higher and COVID-19 cases and deaths.  
 
VI. 
DISCUSSION 
By analyzing each socioeconomic factor separately, we 
could determine which factors most strongly correlate to 
COVID-19 cases and deaths. The strongest correlations 
among the socioeconomic factors used in the data analysis 
are total population size, population with only a high school 
diploma, and total employed population size. The weakest 
correlations among the socioeconomic factors used in the 
data analysis are unemployment rate, percentage of 
population with less than a high school diploma, and 
percentage of population in poverty. No strong negative 
correlations were found from the analyses. 
While the results of the correlation analyses are mostly 
expected, they did offer some surprising findings. The 
correlation coefficients are very similar between total 
employed population size and total unemployed population 
size. This could suggest that those that who are employed 
have roughly the same likelihood of contracting COVID-19 
as those who are unemployed. The industry in which those 
employed work also plays a significant role. For example, 
someone who uses public transportation and travels to the 
workplace has a much higher chance of contracting 
COVID-19 than someone who works from home due to a 
constant proximity to people outside of their residence. This 
idea is further supported by the fact that there is no 
correlation between a region’s unemployment rate and the 
number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. 
From the results of the analyses, it is evident that 
population density is a very strong indicator for the severity 
of impact caused by COVID-19 in each region. This can be 
explained by the fact that a region with a higher population 
density is more prone to airborne transmission of COVID-
19. Regions of the country with a higher population density 
will have more people contributing to economic activity 
(e.g., people working, shopping, eating out, running chores). 
The results of the analyses show that the level of 
education a person has obtained has little correlation with 
COVID-19 cases and deaths. This suggests that a person 
without a high school education has roughly the same

likelihood of contracting COVID-19 as someone with a 
bachelor’s degree or higher. Although jobs that require a 
bachelor’s degree or other form of higher education are 
more likely to offer work-from-home solutions, these 
solutions have little bearing on the likelihood of contracting 
COVID-19. 
Lastly, 
the 
results 
show 
that 
population-based 
socioeconomic factor values provide much stronger 
correlation coefficients than percentage of population 
values. This can be attributed to the fact that cumulative 
COVID-19 cases and deaths are represented by total counts, 
while percentages are orders of magnitudes smaller and 
represent a fraction of the population, rather than the 
individualistic counts. Further research in this field would 
benefit most from matching data types. In other words, total 
COVID-19 cases and deaths should be analyzed with the 
total number of people with a certain socioeconomic factor. 
Conversely, 
socioeconomic 
factors 
represented 
as 
percentages of a population should be analyzed with 
percentages of a population affected by COVID-19. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
The effects of COVID-19 have been far-reaching and 
ubiquitous; no public health event has taken such a toll on 
the global community for over a century. This work 
investigated correlations between various socioeconomic 
factors and the number of cases and deaths resulting from 
COVID-19 in the United States. Furthermore, this research 
showed how statistical computing and visualization can help 
determine which geographical regions of the country are 
most vulnerable in the event of a pathogenic outbreak. The 
information gained from this study will be useful in 
determining the proper distribution of medical resources 
when the next pandemic inevitably strikes.  
It is imperative that data analysis is further conducted on 
COVID-19. For future works, this research can be continued 
by performing rule-based association analysis, which can 
determine which subsets of variables are most strongly 
associated with COVID-19 related cases and deaths.
