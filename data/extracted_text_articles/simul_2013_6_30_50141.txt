Abstract— In this paper, the results of a preliminary 
feasibility study for the development of a sustainable supply 
chain, for the efficient production of heat and power in 
Sardinia, will be presented. The study area involved the state 
forest of Monte Olia, for which the biomass availability 
estimation for energy purposes has been carried out. The 
biomass estimate has been performed by comparing the results 
of three methods, using geomatics to environmental and 
forestry data. In particular, they provide a spatial prediction of 
the annual biomass supply and simulate the temporal 
availability for energy use.

 INTRODUCTION  
The oil reserves will be able to compensate the estimated 
global demand for about 50 years [1], at the current 
consumption rates. Expecting a further world population 
growth and thus the per capita energy consumption, oil 
stocks will decrease in an even shorter time.  
The chance to cope with the future demand for oil and, 
more generally, energy, will be based on the ability to best 
manage the stocks of this fuel, to promote the use of 
renewable energy sources and low-impact technologies for 
efficient energy production. 
With regard to the national energy situation, in 2011, 
Italy was the tenth country for natural gas and oil imports, 
and the fourth for natural gas imports [2]. 
The current energy situation can be summarised on the 
basis of the provisional data derived from the National 
Energy Balance,  referred to the year 2012 [3]: compared to 
an import of 86.278 Mt of oil, 5.397 have been produced 
and 29.173 have been exported, with a gross energy 
consumption of 63.590 Mt of oil. So, it represents the most 
important national energy source, followed by gas (also 
mostly imported). Therefore, it appears that energy 
consumption is high and there is a strong dependency on 
non-renewable energy resources imports. 
The international efforts to reduce the fossil fuels 
consumption and to reduce the non-renewable sources 
dependence led to the enactment of the Kyoto Protocol, 
ratified by Italy in 2002, with the subsequent adoption of a 
National Action Plan for the greenhouse gases (GHG) 
emissions reduction. In the last GHG Inventory Report [4] 
for the EU-27, even though between 1990 and 2010 there 
has been a decrease in GHG emissions equal to 15.4% 
(excluding Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry), 
between 2009 and 2010 there has been an increase of 2.4%. 
Specifically, we note that in 2010 CO2 emissions from 
fossil fuel combustion increased in the EU-27 by 2.8%. 
Italy's contribution to the total European emissions (Tg CO2 
eq.) rose from 519 to 501 between 1990 and 2010, 
representing the fourth nation in the EU-15 and EU-27 for 
the most amount of emissions. In order to reduce GHG 
emissions and mitigate the climate change, since 1988 the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) gives a 
clear view of the state of art related to the problem and its 
potential environmental and socio-economic impacts. 
Among the possible ways to reduce GHG emissions 
concerning heat and power production and supply, the IPCC 
identified, among others, the improvement in energy 
conversion, 
transmission 
and 
distribution, 
including 
cogeneration and efficiency enhancement in energy user 
demand in various fields [5].  
Notably, the cogeneration is a technology that allows 
meeting the aforementioned conditions for hazardous 
emissions reduction and for the improvement of energy 
efficiency, compared to separate production of heat and 
power. 
Between the renewable energy sources that could be 
used in such systems, forest biomasses have a considerable 
importance because, if cropped according to sustainability 
criteria and with and optimization of cutting, concentration 
and transport phases (in order to minimize fuel consumption 
and related emissions), they allow effectively integrating the 
local energy production. In fact, by 2020, in Europe, 
147

biomass will cover 19% of the renewable produced power 
and 78% of heating/cooling from renewable sources [6].  
Currently, the ever growing energy demand does not 
match self-containment in energy production at a 
delocalised level; in this sense, the forest biomass may 
represent a valuable contribution to the achievement of the 
targets set by the Kyoto Protocol for 2020, according to 
forest resources sustainability. Sustainable development 
strictly connects all the ecological and ecosystemic 
components with the usability of forests in terms of leisure 
and use of woody and non-woody products; this is strongly 
interconnected with the socio-economic and cultural 
heritage of a territory. Is along these lines  that, in 1993, the 
Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in 
Europe came to a definition of sustainable forest 
management: “Sustainable forestry is the management and 
use of forests and forested areas in a way and at a pace 
which allows the preservation of their biological diversity, 
productivity, regeneration ability, vitality, as well as their 
capability of fulfilling relevant ecological, economic, and 
social functions at local, national, and global levels now and 
in the future, in a way which does not damage other eco-
systems” [7]. From that viewpoint, where overexploitation 
of forests, repeated burning, extreme events and infestations 
impoverished 
the 
local 
forests, 
biomass 
removal 
sustainability leads to a limited and cautious use of the 
woody resources. The forests productivity is based on 
complex processes, which must be taken into account in the 
models for estimating the biomass for energy purposes. 
For the exploitation of forest biomass for energy use it is 
necessary to assess not only the current availability of 
biomasses, but also its stability over time; in fact, the fuel 
supply fluctuations can also cause relevant problems on the 
payback time of a wood-energy chain. This type of supply 
chains have been developed thanks to the increasing 
awareness by the scientific world, institutions and industry 
of the fossil fuels consumption and the environmental 
emissions associated with their combustion.      
In Italy, the commonly used biomass for heat and power 
production consists mainly of solid biomass derived from 
forestry and agriculture, agro-industrial residues, biogas and 
bioliquids [8]. 
To comply with the sustainability and efficiency criteria, 
a wood-energy chain has to satisfy certain characteristics: 
the biomass must be present in sufficient quantities in order 
to feed a cogeneration plant, the maximum distance from 
the sampling sites to the system must be less than 70 km 
(criterion of short chain) and the plant must be able to meet 
the characteristics imposed by the type of user and of 
biomasses.  
The preliminary feasibility study for the Monte Olia state 
forest (North-eastern Sardinia) aimed to define the 
possibility of setting an efficient and sustainable wood-
energy supply chain, based on the previously discussed 
criteria, using the Geographical Information Systems for the 
spatial estimation of biomass for energy purposes and the 
prediction of its annual availability. 
Firstly, the characteristics of the study area will be 
presented; then, the three estimation methods applied to the 
territory will be explained; finally, the results will be 
discussed. 
II. 
CASE STUDY 
A. General Description of the Forest Resources and 
Territory 
The study area concerns the public forest of Monte Olia, 
located in the North-eastern part of Sardinia (Italy) and it is 
part of the Forest Complex of Alta Gallura-Buddusò (10887 
ha); the forest is managed by Ente Foreste della Sardegna, 
regional organism, whose mission is to protect, develop and 
promote Sardinian forests and wildlife. Between the major 
functions of Ente Foreste della Sardegna, there is also the 
involvement in research and studies aimed at the 
development of eco-friendly production activities that are 
complementary and related to forest management.  
The Monte Olia state forest occupies almost 2300 
hectares and is characterised, from a geological perspective, 
by Palaeozoic granite; in fact the area is in the central part 
of the Corsica-Sardinia batholith, one of the largest 
European intrusive complexes [9].  
The soils of Gallura are generally poorly evolved and 
shallow. In fact, for example, plowing and repeated use of 
fires for new pastures creation in Quercus suber forests 
caused a significant reduction of the organic matter in soils. 
Particularly, in cork production areas the ectorganic 
horizons are well developed, while in the woody areas 
primarily used for grazing, the ectorganic horizons are very 
poorly developed [10].  
The vegetation of the state forest has been significantly 
influenced by repeated fires; the original holm oak 
mesophilic forest remains in few areas in the valleys, 
characterised by covers lower than 20-25%, with a dense 
undergrowth of arbutus, heather, lavender and cistus. 
The most consistent group of artificial formations dates 
back to about 80 years ago, and consists of a high forest of 
Pinus pinea, with dense undergrowth of Quercus Ilex and 
Quercus Suber. For the most recent reforestations (1990 and 
1991), Quercus ilex, Quercus suber, Quercus pubescens had 
been planted as well as Pinus pinea, Pinus halepensis, Pinus 
pinaster, Pinus nigra ssp. Laricio. In the eastern part of the 
state forest pure reforestations of Quercus Suber had been 
done [11]. 
B. Estimation of the Sustainable Allowable Biomass 
For the estimation of forest biomass for energy purposes, 
reference has been made to three methods: 
 
Forestry and Environment Regional Plan of 
Sardinia Region (PFAR) [12], 
 
Barbati A., Corona P., Mattioli W. and Quatrini A.  
[13],

 
Nocentini S., Puletti N. and Travaglini D. [14],  
and the results have been compared, in order to define the 
most appropriate method with respect to the case study.  
Specifically, the PFAR method has been used for a 
rough estimate of Sardinian availability of forest biomasses; 
the Barbati A., Corona P., Mattioli W. and Quatrini A. 
method has been recently proposed in Italy for the Alta 
Valle dell’Aniene (Lazio), which adapts at a local level the 
criteria adopted from [15] for reducing the environmental 
pressures and it considers the current increments of forests. 
The method developed by Nocentini S., Puletti N. and 
Travaglini D. has been developed for high forests of 
Mediterranean conifers in Tuscany and it takes into account 
the minimum forest stock. 
In order to apply the three selected methods, the 
following georeferenced Gauss-Boaga (west zone)/Roma 40 
shapefiles have been used:  
a. Land use map of the Monte Olia state forest: 
woodland classes are identified by areas > 2000 m2 with a 
width >20 m and a coverage > 20%. The minimum mapped 
unit is 2000 m2. 
b. Forest roads. 
c. Spot elevations and contour lines. 
Within the preparation of the detailed forestry plans of 
the state forest, the maps of land use and forest roads have 
been made in 2012 by assignment to Italian forestry 
companies. These data have been provided by Ente Foreste 
della Sardegna, while the two layers containing the 
elevation data (elevation points, contour lines) are available 
for free online [16]. 
Only the polygons of forest have been considered, for 
each woody class the areas have been derived (hectares). 
The distribution of the land use classes is shown in 
Table I.

The woodlands occupy less than a half (47%) of the 
Monte Olia state forest and consist almost entirely of 
conifers (82%), while the remaining part is covered by 
evergreen broadleaf woods (only the 0.3% of the total area 
is covered by deciduous broadleaves). 
PFAR method - The estimation of the available biomass is 
different for broadleaves in the state forests and conifers in 
the state forests. 
 Broadleaves in the state forests 
The average increment of 2.14 m3 ha-1 yr-1 has been 
applied to the woody polygons; the surfaces have 
been multiplied with the usage coefficient of 20%.  
In order to compare the findings of the three methods 
and to obtain the potential allowable cut of biomass (tons of 
dry matter per year), it has been necessary to multiply the 
result by the Wood Basic Density (WBD) and Biomass 
Expansion Factor (BEF) coefficients [17], whose values are 
reported in Table II. The BEF factor expands the growing 
stock volume to the volume of aboveground woody biomass 
(aboveground biomass/growing stock); the WBD coefficient 
allow converting the fresh volume of timber wood to dry 
weight (dry matter, 20% of humidity). 
The final values for broadleaves are 79.6 t d. m. yr-1. 
 Conifers in the state forests 
A range minimum-maximum for the biomass stock 
per hectare has been assigned: 170÷200 m3 ha-1. 
For each limit of this range the steps are indicated 
below:  
- 
The surfaces have been multiplied by the usage 
coefficient 0.45 and then by the lower or upper 
limit of biomass per hectare (170 and 200 m3 
ha-1 respectively). 
- 
All the biomass will be cut during the next 20 
years: the values obtained at the last point have 
been divided by 20 years.  
At the end of those steps, we applied the WBD and 
BEF coefficients and we obtained 2089.7 t d. m. yr-
1 for the lower limit and 2458.5 t d. m. yr-1 for the 
upper limit. 
The total available quantity of biomass for energy uses is 
between 2169.3 t d. m. yr-1 (lower limit condition) and 
2538.1 t d. m. yr-1 (upper limit condition). 
Barbati A., Corona P., Mattioli W. and Quatrini A. method - 
For the wooded classes indicated in the land use map, the 
corresponding current increments derived from the National 
Inventory of Forests and Carbon Sinks (INFC) [18] have 
been applied to the relative polygons as well as the WBD 
and BEF coefficients (Table II).

The biomass obtained by the product of current 
increments, BEF, WBD and surfaces for each of the forest 
classes is equal to 2096.39 t d. m. yr-1. 
Afterwards the removal reduction coefficients have been 
applied, according to the accessibility of forestry vehicles, 
in order to estimate the net potential allowable biomass cut. 
The forest accessibility is a limiting factor for cutting 
and skidding tracks and essentially depends on slope and 
distance from roads; the reduction factors proposed by the 
model (Table III) have been used, by changing the 
coefficient value from 0 to 0.25 for the slope class 21% -
30% and distance from roads 500 - 2500 m, since slopes 
between 20 and 35% and distances from the roads <2500 m 
are on average accessible [19]; for distances from roads 
>2.5 km, cutting and skidding costs are prohibitive and the 
coefficient is 0 for all slopes. 
We subsequently proceeded to the generation of DEM 
(from the elevation values a.s.l. of the two layers of quoted 
points and contour lines), whose spatial resolution is 20 m × 
20 m. The slopes map has been extracted from those raster 
files.

With regard to slopes, the Monte Olia forest has slopes 
greater than 30% for the most part (46.7%); about one third 
of the territory is in the slope class 0% - 20% (30.7%) and 
the rest falls within the class 20% - 30% (22.6%). 
The distance from roads map (Figure 1) has been created 
by applying the Cost Distance algorithm (implemented in 
the ArcGIS software, which has been used for the biomass 
estimation), considering the forest roads as input. 
 
Figure 1.  Map of the distances from roads, Monte Olia 
The algorithm allows obtaining a map of the cumulative 
distances from forest roads with respect to a cost surface, 
the slopes map. We have decided to not apply the Euclidean 
Distance algorithm, since the territory has highly 
accentuated slope variations, which should be taken into 
account in terms of feasibility of cutting and skidding. 
The raster files of slopes and distance from roads have 
been combined, in order to assign the coefficients of Table 
II to the woody cells.  
The map of potential allowable biomass cut before the 
accessibility criterion has been multiplied by the reduction 
coefficients map, using the Map Algebra; the algorithm 
multiplies cell by cell the value of biomass with the 
reduction coefficient. The final output is a map of the net 
allowable biomass cut, considering the limitations due to 
accessibility (t d. m. yr-1).  
For the Monte Olia state forest 719.5 t d. m. yr-1 have 
been obtained. 
The final biomass estimation map shows a limited 
availability of forest biomasses, with meager and 
fragmentarily distributed quantities, with respect to the 
result obtained by the application of the PFAR method.  
Nocentini S., Puletti N. and Travaglini D. method - This 
model takes into account the theory of the systemic 
silviculture [20][21][22] and the notion of the Safe 
Minimum Standard [23].  
The method is based on the concept according to which 
it is possible to cut the biomass if the real stock Pr is greater 
than the minimum stock Pm of 20% (Pr/Pm=1.2), with a 
removal rate depending on this ratio. 
First of the application of the method, the areas with 
slopes >35% and distant more than 2.5 km from forest roads 
have been omitted. 
Subsequently, the real stocks have been assigned to the 
remaining woodland polygons: reference has been made to 
[18]. Such data must be referred to an initial time t0 for the 
estimate: it has been set at the year 2007, which coincides 
with the end of the phase 3+ of the last INFC [18]. 
Starting from t0, the iterations of the method have been 
performed: 
-at the time t0 the Pr is equal to the stock of INFC; 
-at the time t1, Pr1=Pr0+the growing rate (m3 ha-1 yr-1). 
-In the most general condition, we verify Prx-1/Pm >1.2: 
if true, the removal rates indicated in Table IV can be 
applied; if it is false, we continue by doing the comparison 
at the time tx. If at the time tx-1 a certain amount of biomass 
has been removed, at the time tx it has to be subtracted to the 
comparison. 
For the case study, the only forest class which has a 
value of Pr0 similar to Pm (equal to 100 for eliophilous 
species [14]) is that of the conifers, so the iterations have 
been done solely for this class (Figure 2), starting in 2007 
and carrying out the calculations for 16 years.

Table V shows that, for the first eight years, it is not 
possible to cut biomass in the Monte Olia state forest, due to 
the fact that the real biomass stock is less than the minimum 
stock. 
Between 2015 and 2022 the biomass cutting will be 
possible and the average availability of biomass for that 
period is around 300 t d. m. yr-1; the maximum value is 452 
t d. m. yr-1 of total allowable timber. 
From the application of this method, it appears a very 
limited biomass availability for energy purposes; this allows 
us to assert that these quantities may be used to feed a small 
cogeneration plant. 
By 
comparing 
the 
results 
obtained 
by 
the 
implementation of the three above discussed methods for 
the Monte Olia state forest, we noticed that: 
- The first method (PFAR) [12] provided a very huge 
quantity of biomass. This model is not good for a real 
estimation of the biomass availability; in fact it doesn’t 
consider any constraints about biomass removal. 
- The Barbati A., Corona P., Mattioli W. and Quatrini A. 
method and the Nocentini S., Puletti N. and Travaglini D. 
method lead to lower values; in order to decide which has to 
be taken into account, in order to design a wood-energy 
supply chain for a cogeneration system installation close to 
the study area, it is important to analyse them from the point 
of view of the forest stands and regional forest management.  
Specifically for the state forest of Monte Olia, the 
guidelines of the silvicultural interventions are based on the 
systemic silviculture and the minimum forest stock 
[14][22]: so, the available biomass for energy purposes is 
strictly related to those principles. The Barbati A., Corona 
P., Mattioli W. and Quatrini A. method considers the 
current increments instead of the forest stocks: it may occur 
that, by applying this model, the real forest stock is lower 
than the minimum stock, but if we cannot take it into 
account, the estimation of the available biomass does not 
correspond to the real condition.  
Furthermore, the two methods differ for the considered 
forest classes: in the Barbati A., Corona P., Mattioli W. and 
Quatrini A. model we use all the woody classes (conifers as 
well as broadleaves); in the Nocentini S., Puletti N. and 
Travaglini D. method, we must take into consideration only 
the classes which comply with the condition Pr/Pm >1.2. 
From the comparison between the three methods, it is 
clear that the method proposed by Nocentini S., Puletti N. 
and Travaglini D. is the most appropriate, because of the 
151

abovementioned reasons and also because it provides the 
lowest and most precautionary value. 
III. 
CONCLUSION 
The preliminary feasibility study of a sustainable supply 
chain for the efficient energy production in a cogeneration 
plant, using the Monte Olia forest biomasses, has allowed us 
to determine if the biomass quantities are sufficient for their 
use in cogeneration plants and which is the most appropriate 
estimation model for the case study. 
The quantification of the forest biomass for energy 
purposes in the study area has shown a very limited biomass 
availability, which enables to install only a small size 
cogeneration plant close to the area. 
By the application of the three chosen models and the 
comparison between their results, it has been possible to 
verify the significant differences and to select the most 
suitable methodology for the estimation of forest biomass 
for energy uses. The Nocentini S., Puletti N. and Travaglini 
D. method could be used not only for Monte Olia, but also 
for other public forests which have similar conditions. 
The above mentioned method has been effectively used 
to obtain a simulated situation of the annual biomass 
removal for the next nine years. 
The research will continue by developing the supply 
chain: laboratory analyses will be conducted on the most 
relevant forest species, in order to know the fuel 
characteristics; an energy audit is being carried on a service 
building within the study area and an economic evaluation 
of the supply chain will be performed.
