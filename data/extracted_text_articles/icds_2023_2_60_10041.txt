Abstract—The European Union Web Accessibility Directive 
requires public sector bodies in EU Member States to ensure that 
their websites are accessible to users and, in particular, for people 
with disabilities, by September 2020. This paper examines the web 
accessibility of local authority websites in the Republic of Ireland. 
It provides an evaluation of web and accessibility statement 
availability, web accessibility, search engine visibility, and social 
media visibility, using manual and automated methods. Despite 
the minimum requirements set out in the Web Accessibility 
Directive, the overwhelming majority of local government 
websites examined continue to present significant accessibility 
issues and vary in the form and detail of their accessibility 
statements.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
In 2021, almost 58% of people in the European Union (EU) 
aged 16–74 years made use of the internet to interact with 
public authorities [1]. The ISO define accessibility as ”...the 
extent to which products, systems, services, environments and 
facilities can be used by people from a population with the 
widest range of user needs, characteristics and capabilities to 
achieve identified goals in identified contexts of use, where 
such contexts include direct use or use supported by assistive 
technologies.” [2]. In scholarly literature, website accessibility 
is an oft-referenced term but has many meanings. As Krol 
Zdonek [3] note it may refer to (i) the ability to browse web 
content comfortably, regardless of physical limitations, (ii) 
search engine visibility, (iii) social media visibility, and (iv) 
web availability. A key theme in web accessibility literature is 
the removal of barriers to access and use online information and 
services for people with disabilities and the elderly [4][5][6]. 
While commentators note that the concept of ’disability’ is 
ambiguous, indeterminate, multifarious, political, culturally 
contingent, multi-dimensional and highly complex [3][5][7], 
the focus of web accessibility evaluation literature, standards, 
and legislation has been on visual and auditory disabilities and 
to a lesser extent cognitive, and motor disabilities. 
 
  
The legal standing of web accessibility has been debated 
since the first decade of the worldwide web [4]. In particular, 
there has been a significant and growing movement to legislate 
for government websites and those of public sector bodies to 
meet minimum web accessibility standards resulting in Section 
508 of the US Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, Section 
20(6) of the UK Equality Act 2010, and most recently the EU 
Directive on the accessibility of the websites and mobile 
applications of public sector bodies. These laws typically 
require public sector websites to meet a set of testable criteria 
based on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design and 
guidelines recommended by the world wide web consortium 
(W3C). 
  
Over the last two decades, the introduction and ubiquity of 
the smartphone has significantly changed how the public access 
online information and services including public sector 
websites. This is reflected in the Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of 
the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 
on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of 
public sector bodies (the Web Accessibility Directive) enacted 
on 26 October 2016, which became law in Member States on 
23 September 2018. The Web Accessibility Directive requires 
public sector bodies to ensure that their websites and mobile 
applications are more accessible in particular for people with 
disabilities. The Web Accessibility Directive specifically 
requires public sector websites to meet the so-called POUR 
principles of accessibility i.e. perceivability, operability, 
understandability, and robustness, and is testable against 
criteria such as those laid out in the European standard EN 301 
549 V1.1.2, which is largely based on the W3C Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. The Web Accessibility 
Directive allowed for a phased implementation of measures 
with all public sector websites to be compliant by 23 September 
2020. As a result, there has been a renewed interest by scholars 
in the web accessibility of both national and local government 
websites in the EU (see for example [3][8]). 
 
Article 28A of the Irish Constitution recognises the role of 
local government in providing a forum for the democratic

representation of communities and in exercising and 
performing powers conferred by law. The primary legislative 
code outlining the structures, powers, functions, and duties of 
local government in Republic of Ireland is laid out in the Local 
Government Act 2001 and the Local Government Reform Act 
2014. There are currently 31 local authorities in the Republic 
of Ireland - 26 county councils, three city councils (Cork, 
Dublin and Galway), and two city and county councils 
(Limerick and Waterford). The operations of local authorities 
are also impacted by other legislation. This paper assesses the 
website accessibility of the 31 local authorities in the Republic 
of Ireland. The Web Accessibility Directive was transposed in 
to Irish law through the European Union (Accessibility of 
Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies) 
Regulations 2020, which came into force on 23 September 
2020. The remainder of this paper will be organised as follows; 
in Section 2 the data and methods will be presented, Section 3 
will discuss the results over four headings (namely website 
availability, accessibility statements and assistive technologies, 
website accessibility, search engine visibility, and social media 
visibility), and finally Section 4 will outline our conclusions. 
 
II. DATA AND METHODS 
 
The study involves all 31 websites of local authorities in the 
Republic of Ireland. This study examined four aspects of web 
accessibility, namely: web availability, web accessibility, 
search engine visibility, and social media visibility. We only 
focus on websites. Data was collected in December 2022 and 
January 2023, both manually and using automated tools. 
Firstly, whether the website uses secure http (HTTPS), data on 
the availability of a web accessibility policy, the availability of 
assistive tools on each local government website, and social 
media presence was manually collected. In addition, search 
engine accessibility was examined by manually checking 
whether (a) a robots.txt file blocked search engine crawling, 
 
the local authority was displayed in a knowledge panel and 
whether it was claimed or unclaimed, and (c) as per King & 
Youngblood [10] whether the county website ranked on the 
first page of search engine results on Google, Bing, Twitter and 
Facebook. Secondly, we utilised PowerMapper’s OnDemand 
Suite, a commercial software tool that scans web code against 
1,300 standards-based checkpoints including WCAG 2.1, 
WCAG 2.0, Section 508 (2017), accessible file formats, 
desktop and browser mobile compatibility, broken links and 
errors, web standards (including W3C HTML and CSS 
standards), and Google and Bing SEO best practice guidelines. 
Thirdly, Google Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool 
for improving the quality of web pages, was used to assess both 
desktop and mobile quality of experience. Finally, the Google 
Mobile Friendly Test tool was used to test mobile usability. 
PowerMapper’s OnDemand Suite and Google Lighthouse are 
used widely by private and public sector organisations for 
accessibility and quality of experience evaluation, and 
increasingly in scholarly research (see, for example, 
[3][10][17]). 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
  
The following section evaluates these websites over four 
points of discussion, namely; website availability and its 
adherence to regulations on accessibility statements and 
assistive technologies, the accessibility of the websites in a 
number of categories; the search engine visibility, and the 
social media visibility. 
 
A. Website Availability, Accessibility Statements and Assistive 
Technologies 
 
With respect to web availability, local authorities in Ireland 
all have a dedicated website. Over 77% of Irish citizens use a 
smartphone for private purposes [19] and over 99% of Irish 
Internet users use a smartphone to access the Internet [20]. As 
such, mobile usability is an important factor in web availability 
and accessibility for local authorities. The Google Mobile 
Friendly Testing tool was used to test usability on smartphones. 
One local authority blocked Google crawls. Of the other 30 
websites, 28 were deemed usable on a smartphone (mobile 
friendly). HTTPS provides and additional layer of protection to 
data transferred between users and websites by providing 
cryptographic security protection for data, authenticating 
websites using digital certificates, and enabling browser-based 
security mechanisms [21]. These mechanisms provide 
protection to web traffic from network attackers and build trust 
in websites and the web in general. Without HTTPS, any data 
passed is insecure. Furthermore, if HTTPS is not used search 
engines will display a warning which may adversely impact 
trust in the local authority. Only one website in the sample did 
not use HTTPS. While this suggests high penetration, it is still 
surprising that there was not full coverage. 
Regulation 7 of the European Union (Accessibility of 
Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies) 
Regulations 2020 requires an accessibility statement in a 
required form to be published on local authority websites. 
While our results found that the requirement to publish an 
accessibility statement on local authority websites has been 
generally complied with, the form and detail varies 
significantly particularly with respect to the accessibility links 
on local authority homepages. Implementation ranges from 
detailed accessibility statements to links to empty web pages or 
external third-party websites. The Web Accessibility Directive 
and associated regulations do not require local authorities to 
integrate or implement assistive tools; it is as a ‘minimum 
harmonisation’ directive. This means that it only sets out the 
absolute minimum requirements that must be met by public 
sector bodies for their websites and mobile applications. 
Notwithstanding this, for public sector bodies it is reasonable 
to consider the provision and integration of assistive 
technologies as best practice. Only eight local authority

websites in the sample featured integrated assistive 
technologies. Table I summarises our findings by website. 
 
Article 7 of the Web Accessibility Directive requires local 
authorities to produce an accessibility statement in an 
accessible format and to be published on the website concerned. 
26 county councils had web accessibility statements of some 
form on their website and 23 featured web accessibility 
statements of some form on the homepage of their website. 
The Web Accessibility Directive also requires accessibility 
statements to be prepared using the model accessibility 
statement referred to in Commission Implementing Decision 
EU 2018/1523. While our results found that the requirement to 
publish an accessibility statement on a local authority website 
has been generally complied with, the form and detail varies 
significantly. For example, one merely provided links to the 
Access Officer, another linked to the W3C Web Accessibility 
Initiative (WAI), and one linked to a page containing no 
content. 
The Web Accessibility Directive and associated regulations 
do not require local authorities to integrate or implement 
assistive tools. As discussed above, it is a ‘minimum 
harmonisation’ directive. Notwithstanding this, for public 
sector bodies it is reasonable to consider the provision and 
integration of assistive technologies as best practice. Only eight 
local authority websites in the sample featured integrated

assistive technologies; a further three referenced recommended

- Recite Me (6), Reachdeck (3), and Browse Aloud (2). Table 
II summarises our findings by website. 
 
B. Website Accessibility 
 
PowerMapper’s OnDemand Suite was used to evaluate five 
categories of standards-based checkpoints: 
  
• Errors - quality issues including broken links, server 
configuration problems, script errors and issues with 
Internet RFCs; 
• Accessibility issues - compliance with WCAG 2.1 and 
Section 508 (2017); 
• Compatibility issues - browser-specific content, 
functionality, layout or performance problems; 
• Standards issues - validation that pages meet W3C 
HTML/XHTML and CSS standards and identification of 
issues related to W3C deprecated features; and, 
 
• Usability issues - general usability issues based on Us-
ability.gov 
guidelines, 
W3C 
Best 
Practices, 
and 
readability. 
In addition, to identifying the number of pages with issues, 
PowerMapper provides a benchmark against websites in their 
test database. Sites are designated worse or better. Overall, 29 
local authority websites could be scanned; two blocked remote 
scanning. Our results also suggest that the local authorities in 
the sample had significant volumes of pages on their websites 
46

ICDS 2023 : The Seventeenth International Conference on Digital Society

featuring quality issues and errors, as well as browser 
incompatibility and non-compliance with accessibility, 
technical web standards and usability guidelines. All 29 
websites performed worse than the PowerMapper benchmark. 
Overall, the sample websites performed better than the 
benchmark in only one category, Errors, where 21 websites 
performed better than the benchmark. Only one website in the 
sample performed better than the Powermapper benchmark for 
each of accessibility and usability. Table III summarises our 
findings by website. 
 
Google Lighthouse was used to measure the quality of 
experience of each website across three measures - 
performance, accessibility, and best practice - for both mobile 
and desktop users. Performance measures how well a given 
page is optimised for users to be able to see and interact with 
page content. Accessibility assesses the extent to which all 
users can access content and navigate a given website 
effectively. Best practices assess the underlying code health of 
a given website against best practice. Google Lighthouse score 
ranges are: 0 to 49 (red): Poor; 50 to 89 (orange): Needs 
Improvement; and 90 to 100 (green): Good. Table IV presents 
the results from Google Lighthouse analysis. Our results 
suggest while local authority websites in the sample are usable 
on smartphones, performance, accessibility, and alignment 
with best practices for mobile use varies significantly with most 
websites requiring significant improvements. Desktop results 
were significantly better than those for mobile suggesting that 
the websites were primarily designed for desktop users. 
Notwithstanding this, there is clear room for improvement. 
Table V summarises our results. 
 
C. Search Engine Visibility 
 
Search engine visibility are not required under legislation 
although they play an important role in information 
accessibility and discoverability. As per King & Youngblood 
[9] we manually assessed whether each local authority website 
ranked on the first page of search engine results on Google and 
Bing. In all cases, the local government website featured in the 
first search engine results page. Knowledge panels give 
websites more exposure as they occupy more space in a search 
engine results page, is more understandable and provides better 
usability by giving faster access to important information and 
links. In each case, a knowledge panel was displayed for each 
local authority however in 11 cases, the knowledge panel had 
not been claimed thereby limiting the range and timeliness of 
data that could be displayed. If a website uses a robots.txt file 
to limit crawling, its URL can still appear in search results but 
the search result will not have a description, non-HTML files 
will be excluded, and rich results will not display. As such, it 
can impact website accessibility and usability. Only three 
websites blocked search engine crawling. Table VI summarises 
our findings by website. 
 
OnDemand Suite was also used to evaluate whether a given 
website met Google, Bing and Yahoo! search guidelines, 
robots.txt guidelines, and search best practices. Again, two 
websites blocked scans of their website. Of the remaining 29, 
only two websites performed better than the PowerMapper 
benchmark in the search category. Furthermore, Google Light-
house was used to assess how well a given website is optimised 
for search engines. Again, score ranges are: 0 to 49 (red): Poor; 
50 to 89 (orange): Needs Improvement; and 90 to 100 (green): 
Good. Generally speaking, Google Lighthouse results for SEO 
were relatively high for both mobile and desktop with an 
average score of 84 for both. Table VII summarises our 
findings by website. 
 
D. Social media visibility 
 
In Europe, on average 58% of the individuals participated in 
online social networking sites in 2022 [23]. While statistics are 
not available for Ireland for 2022, historically Irish social media 
use has been higher than the EU average [24]. 30 of the 
websites provided links to at least one social networking sites 
on their home page and 28 provided links to two or more social 
networking sites. Twitter (30) and Facebook (208) were the 
most prevalent. Table VIII summarises our findings by website. 
In addition, we completed the same manual assessment on 
social media search engine results on Facebook and Twitter. 
All local authorities featured on the first (extended) search 
engine results page for Twitter and 29 local authorities featured 
on the first search engine results page on Facebook. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Policymakers and legislators have made significant efforts to 
ensure that minimum standards are met for website 
accessibility. Our findings suggest that in Ireland, despite these 
efforts, there are some key issues to be addressed in nearly all 
local authority websites. Many of these issues are neither 
difficult to implement nor costly. As demonstrated from this 
paper, the identification of issues at a page level can be 
achieved using free and commercial off-the-shelf tools. Further 
research is required to identify the specific barriers to achieving 
and maintaining web accessibility. 
 
Regulation 8 of the European Union (Accessibility of 
Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies) 
Regulations 2020 names the National Disability Authority as 
the monitoring body. Although testing different samples with 
some overlap, our findings are consistent with their 2021 
Monitoring Report (see [21]). This suggests that greater 
commitment to accessibility is required by public sector bodies 
but also that the monitoring body requires more effective 
enforcement procedures (including penalties). Local authorities
