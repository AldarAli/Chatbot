Abstract— Many researchers from different scientiﬁc ﬁelds are
developing new strategies to foster individuals toward a physically
more active lifestyle. In most cases, these strategies exploit
new generation mobile devices together with social networks to
augment their persuasive power. In our research work we focus
on the study of the effects of these technologies on people’s sport
habits. To better study this phenomenon, we are developing a
software platform that aims at encouraging people to pursue
a more active lifestyle. This work presents an experimentation
conducted on Everywhere Run!, a mobile application part of the
platform, that aims at helping people to stay active behaving like
a virtual personal trainer. Very preliminary tests on the impact of
the application on users’ motivations, show that it is perceived as
a valuable motivational tool. These tests have been the starting
point for this work that presents an interesting result that is
closely related to recent radical changes we made to the graphical
design and usability of the software. During a six months period,
we observed a considerable increment of the total number of daily
trainings. To statistically prove the effectiveness of the redesign,
we decided to compare the two versions of the application. The
results conﬁrm the effectiveness of the new design and bring
us to another important intuition that we will better investigate
over a longer period of time in our forthcoming researches: user
experience may positively inﬂuence users’ motivations and their
perception of the offered features especially in the long term.

INTRODUCTION
Several studies demonstrate the importance of a regu-
lar physical activity for people well-being (see for exam-
ple, [2][3][4][5]). Low levels of physical activity are a major
risk factor for lower life expectancy, cardiovascular diseases
and many other chronic diseases. Former studies put in evi-
dence the beneﬁts of a healthy lifestyle, nevertheless, it does
not seem to be enough to encourage people to conduct a
healthier lifestyle. This alarming trend is clearly shown by
several researches as, for example, by the report of the World
Health Organization (WHO) for the years 2008-2010 [6]. The
report, along with other similar studies (see, for example, [7]),
lists some advices for a better lifestyle. For example:
•
Engage in regular physical activity
•
Limit the intake of free sugars
•
Limit energy intake from total fats and shift fat con-
sumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats
and towards the elimination of trans-fatty acids
•
Increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes,
whole grains and nuts
Scientists from different backgrounds and several industrial
entities are proposing new persuasive techniques to encourage
people in everyday physical activity. These methodologies tend
to leverage a fun oriented approach together with new mobile
devices to motivate individuals towards healthy habits.
Buttussi et al. [12] propose a classiﬁcation for this kind of
persuasive tools:
•
Computer-supported physical games
•
Virtual trainers
•
Mobile applications and devices
Our researches are focused on the last category since it
seems to be the most promising one in terms of the high num-
ber of related researches, proposed solutions and encouraging
results obtained so far.
Mobile device usage is growing fast and it is somehow af-
fecting people’s everyday life. They are relatively inexpensive,
versatile, highly portable and are potentially usable at anytime,
anywhere.
As an example, Mulas et al. [13] propose a mobile applica-
tion, called Everywhere Race!, that allows users from all over
the world to interact and to compete in virtual real time races
in different speed-based sports. Everywhere Run! (EWRun), as
well as Everywhere Race!, fosters social interactions. However,
its interaction model is different from other similar appli-
cations. It focuses on relationships between users and real
personal trainers in addition to that, more common, between
similar users. In this way, it favours beginner runners to get a
tailored workout plan and to start running avoiding common
ﬁrst-time mistakes. A user can request his custom-tailored
running plan to a real trainer and he can receive it seamlessly
inside the application. At this point, the user as just to start
running letting himself be guided by the virtual trainer to run
the selected distance at the right pace.
Many researches [9] [10] put in evidence the beneﬁts
and the inﬂuence of social interactions in sport. The constant
support of a real trainer, in addition to make workouts safer,
can be much more motivating in the long term too.
Our application is designed to help people to get rid

of some common deterrents to physical activity like, for
example, time constraints rather than gym membership fees.
The application allows users to get in touch with a real trainer
to get a tailored workout plan they can follow at anytime,
anywhere. This results both in more time ﬂexibility and in
lower costs for users given that it is not mandatory for them
to meet with a real coach. Other solutions, however, try to
attract users focusing mainly on their past performance rather
than the social and ludic aspects of sport. For many people,
this can be a limiting factor especially when the aim is both to
attract non-habitual runners and to motivate them in the long
term.
With respect to other proposals our approach promotes
interactions between users and real trainers through a com-
munity of runners. Very preliminary results conﬁrm that users
appreciate EWRun functionalities [24] meaning that our work
is on the good track. Nevertheless, the data collected from
recent application usage statistics suggest that many innovative
features are not enough if the whole design has not been real-
ized with a special attention to user experience. Our assertion
follows from a recent radical redesign of the application. We
moved from a relatively simple and not very user centered
design to a better one following usability best practices and the
Android design recommendations [8]. These changes resulted
in a remarkable application’s user growth even if there were no
notable functional improvements. This is why we decided to
mathematically prove the goodness of the new design with
respect to the old one. We performed an A/B test on 40
users through two standard System Usability Scale (SUS)
questionnaires [11] (one questionnaire for each design under
evaluation [37]).
The encouraging results obtained so far suggest us that
the offered functionalities without the proper design are not
enough to attract people especially for a long time period. To
the best of our knowledge we are the ﬁrst, in the ﬁeld of mobile
persuasive technologies, to show similar results for a real world
application used by hundreds of users everyday. This interest-
ing result bring us to another intuition that we will investigate
in the near future over a longer time period: user experience
can be crucial to alter individuals’ motivation and can deeply
inﬂuence their perception of the offered functionalities.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
surveys the state of the art in the ﬁeld of mobile persuasive
computing. Section III brieﬂy describes the application and
shows how its design has been changed whereas, Section IV
reports the results of the experimentation. Section V concludes
the paper.

RELATED WORK
In this section, we report some studies and some techno-
logical systems designed to help people during daily physical
activity.
In [18], IJsselsteijn et al. investigate on intrinsic motivation
enhancement. For their studies, they realized a virtual coach
system to help users while cycling on a stationary bike. They
report a good users reaction to the stimuli provided by the
coach and derived some important results about the way the
users perceived the informations provided by the virtual coach
during the trainings.
Mulas et. al. [13] propose an innovative mobile application
called Everywhere Race!. The application is designed to moti-
vate people in a wide range of speed-based sport activities. It
is the ﬁrst system that allows users from all over the world to
compete against each other in different speed-based sports. The
software, in a completely different way than others, allows real
time races among participants and makes available a signiﬁcant
set of social functionalities by means of the social network
Facebook.
In [19], is presented a game called Your Shape Fitness
Evolved designed to help users during indoor workouts. The
game, among other features, allows users to design a custom
workout, to keep track of training statistics and to challenge
other users by means of a virtual community.
Toscos et al. [20] propose an application, called Chick
Clique, to help teenage girls to adopt a healthier lifestyle.
The software stores informations about the caloric content of
popular foods and the amount of steps necessary to burn them.
Chick Clique aims at fostering social interactions by means of
SMS in order to boost a positive competition among users.
Hoysniemi et al. [17] illustrate the results regarding the
experimentation of a famous dance video game called Dance
Dance Revolution. The results stress the positive inﬂuence
of gaming with respect to motivational, physical and social
factors.
Chittaro et al. [15] propose a location-based exergame
based on the classic Snake mobile game in which the snake
is guided by users’ movements. The work aims at encourag-
ing users to walk more frequently and at demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed solution through the adoption of
standard questionnaires. Obtained results put in evidence how
users’ behavior can be inﬂuenced by the fun resulting from
the game.
Oliveira et al. [22] present a mobile phone application
called TripleBeat. The application uses both an accelerometer
and an ECG to push runners to achieve predeﬁned goals ex-
pressed in terms of heart rates. Their experimentation revealed
the importance of a well-designed graphical user interface in
order to enforce users’ motivations.
Consolvo et al. [21] present a mobile application called
Houston. The application makes use of a pedometer to count,
to record and to share the results achieved by the user. The
authors derived some interesting key design guidelines to be
used in this class of mobile applications:
•
Users expect to have thorough measures and long term
statistical reports of their activities
•
Support for social features to improve users’ motiva-
tion through a friendly competition
•
Take into account the comfort of proposed solutions
Consolvo et al. [16] present UbiFit Garden, a mobile sys-
tem that uses on-body sensing, activity inference and mobile
display to encourage people to stay active.
Preliminary results, derived from a three-week ﬁeld trial,
show that users were positively surprised by the novelties
the application introduced and their responses help authors to
derive some guidelines to be observed to improve their system.
Nike+ [23] is one of the most popular applications to
help people during sport activities. Some of its main strengths
are: the advanced vocal cues and music system management,
the deep use of social networks and the support of a web
community where users can create their workouts plans and

interact with other sportsmen.
Along with Nike+, there exist several other commercial
examples of such a kind of applications. Just to name a few:
Adidas miCoach, Endomondo, MapMyFitness, RunKeeper,
Runtastic and many others. All these systems provide more
or less the same core functionalities:
•
Route and workout data tracking
•
Statistical reports
•
Results sharing through ad hoc communities or social
networks
As previously stated, our work is focused on the relation-
ship between user experience and mobile persuasive technolo-
gies. In the next sections we are going to describe how EWRun
has been redesigned, the procedure we used to evaluate both
the new and old design and the obtained results so far. From
our researches on this topic, we have not found similar case
studies. This is probably because academic proposals are
typically prototypes and do not have a considerable amount of
users to conduct comprehensive tests. Commercial products, on
the contrary, usually have a huge amount of users and reﬁned
designs but, to the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly
available studies and results on this subject.
III.
EVERYWHERE RUN! REDESIGN
EverywhereRun! [24] is a mobile application designed to
support people during their running routines. By means of the
application users can design their own regimes or get tailored
ones directly from a real personal trainer seamlessly inside
the application. EWRun redesign has been inspired by the
guidelines proposed in [21] and for this reason, we introduced
a new home screen (see Figure 1) that reports all the statistics
of user’s past trainings such as: the total distance covered, the
total number of workouts, the average speeds and so on.
Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the workout creation screen
respectively for the old and the new design. Through this
screen users can plan relatively complex regimes like the one,
called “Monday”, showed by the two ﬁgures: each training
is composed of several “sessions”, called “traits”, deﬁned in
terms of distance and pace (or speed) to keep. The “trait 1”
in Figure 3 means the user wants to run 2km at a pace of 5
minutes per kilometer (note: runners generally express speed

Old design workout creation menu.
Fig. 3.
New design workout creation menu.
as the time to run one kilometer or mile). The ﬁrst trait is
followed by “trait 2” where the runner expects to run 10km at
a higher pace than before.
Hence, EWRun permits to deﬁne quite complex regimes
in order to satisfy even the most demanding runners. Both
designs offer the same features in terms of training design
complexity, although the new one is completely different in
terms of usability (note that the following consideration holds
for all of the screens of the new design): global application’s
settings have been made available in this screen whereas many
other options, local to the screen, have been moved from the
bottom of the screen to the topmost bar as suggested by the
new Android design guidelines. This allows us to give more
homogeneity to the navigation between screens and to keep
many locally available functionalities grouped in the top bar
rather than scattered all over the screen.
As previously stated, the virtual personal trainer is the
core feature of EWRun. By means of this functionality the
application is able both to guide and to motivate the runner
during the whole workout in order for him to reach predeﬁned
goals (i.e., the goals set by means of the workout creation
screen, see Figure 2 or Figure 3). In Figure 4 and Figure 5, it
is possible to observe, again for the old and the new design,
two ongoing workouts and how the virtual personal trainer
feature works.
Figure 4 shows the virtual trainer represented by the
orange icon in the left center of the screen. He acts like

pacemaker (note: a pacemaker has the task to keep the pace for
other runners) so that the runner, virtually represented by the
green icon in the center of the screen, has just to follow him
focusing only on the run. In both designs, the topmost part of
the screen contains an horizontal bar to give user an overview
of the whole workout (note that the workout length is known a
priori since it has been deﬁned in the workout creation screen)
with the actual position of the runner with respect to the virtual
trainer.
Just below the bar there is a dashboard that reports current
speeds, distances and times regarding both the current trait and
the whole training session. The two buttons in the bottommost
of the screen (only for the old releases) allow to zoom in/out
the part of the whole workout depicted in the central part of
the screen. This was supposed to make it easier for the user to
estimate the current distance to the trainer (see below). In the
old design the two big arrows in the right side of the screen
suggested to the user if he has respectively to slow down or
to speed up. In between the arrows the current distance of the
runner to the trainer is clearly indicated. Furthermore, the two
arrows will be alternatively ﬁlled proportionally to the need of
slowing down or speeding up. Hence, the user knows at any
moment his current performance level with just a quick glance
at the screen. All that can be observed in Figure 4. The ﬁgure
depicts a runner just 3 meters behind the virtual coach, thus
none of the arrows is ﬁlled to signal that the user is keeping
the proper pace.
Fig. 6.
Number of trainings with old (Nov 2012. to Jan 2013) and new
design (Feb. to Apr. 2013).
Now, we are going to further explore the differences
between the two designs: in addition to the aforementioned
bar at the topmost of the screen (see Figure 5), used both
to improve the navigability and to more evenly group both
global and local options, we focused our efforts to redesign
the portion of the screen that depicts the user and the virtual
coach during a training session (i.e., the “personal trainer” area
in the lower half of Figure 5). Some advices from EWRun beta
testers pushed us to simplify the various components originally
present. At ﬁrst, in addition to a general graphic improvement,
we switched the “personal trainer” area from a vertical to an
horizontal orientation to be consistent with the whole workout
perspective at the topmost of the screen. Secondly, the zoom
in/out buttons have been removed since they seem to be useless
when used during a training and ﬁnally, we removed one of the
two arrows. Indeed, now there is only one arrow that changes
its orientation accordingly to the current position of the user
with respect to the virtual personal trainer. The distance gap
between the user and the trainer has been moved near the icon
representing the user, in its left. In this way, we try to keep
training data as compact as possible by decreasing the total
number of graphic elements for a better user experience.
IV.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The new design of Everywhere Run!, as previously in-
troduced in Section III, caused a statistically signiﬁcant user
base growth. For this reason, we decided to compare the two
designs by means of a standard testing methodology known
as A/B testing (see for example, [33]). The description of the
experimentation will start by showing the application’s usage
statistics that inspired us to conduct this study and, afterwards,
we will describe in more detail the A/B testing methodology
and the mathematical tools we used for the experimentation.
Figure 6 reports the number of weekly workouts (by all
users) performed with both application designs. The statistics
have been collected over a three months period, from Novem-
ber 2012 to January 2013 for the old design and from February
to April 2013 for the new design. In the graphic is clearly
shown the number of trainings growing from about 1500 of
the 1st of November 2012 to about 2300 (+53%) at the end
of January 2013.
In general, there is a positive growth rate but much lower
70

when compared to usage statistics for the new design. With
the introduction of the new design in February 2013 (again
there were no new features offered) the number of trainings
passed from about 2300 to about 4000 (+74%).
Now, we are going to explain the A/B test we conducted.
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a widely adopted
technique typically used to compare two design variants (A
and B) of the same system. Amazon was probably the ﬁrst
industrial entity to adopt this procedure to evaluate the user
experience of its marketplace. Differences between version A
and version B can range from completely different layout struc-
tures to, for example, the font type, the different disposition
of a button and so on. The goal of the evaluation is to identify
some changes that can increase a certain metric of interest.
To conduct the test, we adopted the System Usability Scale
(SUS) questionnaire [11]. SUS is a well known tool (it counts
more than 600 citations [35]) used both by industries and by
academics. SUS is technology independent and it has been
used to test web sites, hardware, consumer software and much
more. The questionnaire is composed of 10 questions with 5
response options. Each question is rated using a Likert scale
ranging from 0 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”).
We conducted our experiment with a sample of 40 partici-
pants that regularly used both application versions. The sample
was composed of 34 males and 6 females with an average age
of 35.8 years (standard deviation was 10.4 years). All the users
regularly practiced sport at an amateur level and they all have
had at least a previous experience with applications to support
physical activity.
Table I reports the SUS scores for all the testers and the mean
of difference scores. The experimentation has followed the
method proposed by Sauro et al. [33] to prove what the usage
statistics suggest (see Figure 6).
Often, in many research ﬁelds (HCI is no exception), the
population mean and standard deviation are not known so it is
not possible to use the Empirical Rule and z-scores [34][33].
Under those circumstances, it is used a paired t-test [30] to
compare how a limited number of testers perform in two
different test conditions. In particular, we use a paired t-test to
determine if the difference between SUS score means for the
two designs is signiﬁcant or not. To determine the test statistic
t the following formula is used:
t = D
Sd
√n
(1)
where: D is the mean of the difference scores, Sd is the standard
deviation of the difference scores and n is the sample size. In
our case (see Table I) D is equal to 26.8, Sd is equal to 15.621
and the sample size (n) is 40. Plugging in all the values in
Formula 1 we obtain a value for t equal to 18.85. Is this value
statistically signiﬁcant? To answer to this question we have
to look up the p-value [36] using the Student’s distribution
table with n-1 (39) degrees of freedom. The table give us
2.415 × 10−13. This very small value tell us that the SUS
scores for the two designs is different with a probability very
close to 100%. This result conﬁrms us that the difference is
statistically signiﬁcant but, is it signiﬁcant enough for users
so that they will notice it? The conﬁdence interval around the
difference will answer to this question. The formula 2 is used

actual difference of scores is between 21.8 and 31.8. These
results conﬁrm our initial intuition and demonstrate that the
new design usability is better both statistically and in terms of
users’ perception.
In conclusion, we can afﬁrm that our case study demon-
strates how a good user experience can be crucial for users
engagement.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
A remarkable number of studies and mobile solutions have
been proposed to push people to a more active and healthy
lifestyle. Our work illustrates the results of an experimentation
we conducted on 40 real users of Everywhere Run!. EWRun
has been designed to guide runners step by step during their
workouts giving them the possibility to plan quite complex
regimes on their own, or to receive a custom-tailored ones

from a real trainer by means of the application.
As proven by previous studies [24], users appreciate the
features of the application, although, a recent radical redesign
we made to the application’s and the related users’ reactions,
led us to consider not only the implementation of innovative
functionalities but also to keep into great account the user
experience design.
During a six months period, we observed a remarkable user
growth even if the application offers roughly the same features
offered in the past. As a consequence, we decided to compare
the two designs. The test has been conducted on 40 real users
by means of a standard and well known methodology, which
uses a SUS questionnaire.
Obtained results partially conﬁrmed our intuition: innova-
tive features may not be enough effective to motivate users’
without a special attention to user experience design. We are
probably the ﬁrst, in the ﬁeld of mobile persuasive technolo-
gies, to report similar results for a real world application used
by hundreds of users everyday. These results will be the very
ﬁrst step of our future research activity to better investigate
and possibly to verify over a longer time period another fact
that seems to be related to this work and deeply linked to the
supplied user experience: how user experience design can alter
long term users’ motivations.
