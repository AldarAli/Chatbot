Abstract—The evolution of online social networks (OSN)
is a hot topic in computer science. Surprisingly a lot of
research on this topic was also done by physicists – following
the long history of studying networks in physics. To give
an interdisciplinary discussion impulse, this paper intends to
delineate the major physical theories of the evolution of (O)SN.
Furthermore the paper presents a future research gap, which
consists in the lack of adoption of the physical theory of
preferential attachment on OSN by computer scientists.
Keywords-online social networks; evolution; physical theories;
interdisciplinary perspective.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the last years, there has been a lot of research activities
on OSN in different disciplines (e.g., computer science [1],
[2], economics [3], sociology [4], and psychology [5], [6]).
Understanding the structure of OSN, as well as the processes
that shape them, is regarded as important [7]. “It would be
useful to have efficient algorithms to infer the actual degree
of shared interest between two users, or the reliability of a
user (as perceived by other users). With respect to security, it
is important to under- stand the robustness of such networks
to deliberate attempts of manipulation [7, p. 31].”
One of the main research aims concerns the evolution
of OSN. Despite of the rich spectrum of the mentioned
disciplines there are huge differences in saturation on OSN
evolution research. Therefore, three databases were queried
on 19th August and 20th August 2011: ACM Digital Library,
IEEE Xplore Digital Library and ISI Web of Knowledge.
Search terms were ‘evolution social networks’, ‘social net-
work theory internet’, ‘social networks evolution internet’
and ‘evolution social network internet’. The selection cri-
terion was ‘most cited’ on IEEE Xplore Digital Library,
‘times cited’ on ISI Web of Knowlegde and ‘citation count’
on ACM Digital Library. Searched were in abstract, title
and content of articles. To complete these results, the
databases ScienceDirect and SpringerLink were also queried
on 3rd September 2011 for ‘relevant’ articles. Between all
the findings were selected the 15 most relevant articles.
The relevance was evaluated with regard to the abstracts.
An article, that had been comparatively less quoted, was
preferred under certain circumstances to a more often cited
article, because of its ability to answer the research question.

the subject of the research where the abstract, the title and
the content of articles. The research also showed the great
interest of physicists. Between the first 25 results came eight

(one), and Telecommunications Policy (one). As a result of
these inquiries, the research question was redefined in: How
physical theories explain the evolution of OSN? This paper
focuses on the OSN, seen through the glasses of physics.
Why physicists are interested in OSN at all? “The study
of networks has had a long history in mathematics and
the sciences... [22, p. 1]”– but the recent time brought a
renewal: the advent of modern database technology, which
can process even huge amounts of data [15, p. 107]. “Being
far larger than the datasets of traditional social network
analysis, these networks are more amenable to the kinds of
statistical techniques with which physicists and mathemati-
cians are familiar [22, p. 6]”. At the end of the 1990s the
investigation of massive amounts of data with mathematical
and physical techniques marked the beginning of a “new
science of networks [22, p. 4]” (leading theorists: Albert-
L´aszl´o Barab´asi, Mark Buchanan, Duncan J. Watts and Mark
Newman [23, p. 57]). According to Barab´asi, Newman and
Watts the new science distinguishes itself from the previous
work in three ways: first by focusing on the properties
of real-world networks, second by looking networks as
evolving structures and thirdly by considering networks as
dynamical systems [22, p. 4].
A. Method and structure of the article
The literature-based work systematically investigated the
most substantial relevant databases (ACM Digital Library,
IEEE Xplore Digital Library, ISI Web of Knowledge,
ScienceDirect, SpringerLink) with regard to the physical
theories of the evolution of networks. The 15 most rele-
vant articles present research findings referring on physical
theories of the evolution of networks – but these articles
do not explain these theories in detail. Therefore a mere
presentation of the research results would be incompre-
hensible for a reader who is not a network theorist. That
is why we structure the research findings on the basis of
the article “Scale-Free Networks” by the physicists Albert-
L´aszl´o Barab´asi and Eric Bonabeau [24] who provide an
introduction to current physical theories of the evolution of
networks. This article is used as a framework for the general
explanation of certain topics, which are then refined by the
findings in the 15 most relevant articles.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces
the relevant terms. Section
III discusses physical theories
of the evolution of networks and their application on OSN.
Section IV lectures criticism on the the physical theories
about OSN. Section V explores how the physical theories
of the evolution of OSN are adopted by computer scientists.
Section VI shows limitations of this paper, presents a future
research gap and open issues.
II. CLARIFICATION OF TERMS
Evolution is considered as “the development or growth,
according to its inherent tendencies, of anything that may
be compared to a living organism (e.g., of a political
constitution, science, language, etc.); sometimes, contrasted
with revolution. Also, the rise or origination of anything by
natural development, as distinguished from its production
by a specific act; ‘growing’ as opposed to ‘being made’
[25, p. 477].” A network is “a set of items, which we will
call vertices or sometimes nodes, with connections between
them, called edges... [21, p. 168].” A social network is a
“set of people or groups of people with some pattern of
contacts or interactions between them... [21, p. 172].” The
term OSN is used in the sense of a social-networking site,
defined by boyd and Ellison: “We define social network
sites as web-based services that allow individuals to (1)
construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded
system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they
share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of
connections and those made by others within the system.
The nature and nomenclature of these connections may vary
from site to site [1, p. 211].” Physical terms are explained in
Section III, directly when physical theories are presented.
The term OSN is always used in plural. The terms vertex
and node are congruent.
III. PHYSICAL THEORIES ON OSN
Among the 15 most relevant articles are [7], [11], [13],
[15], [18] and [19] of particular interest: they are empirical
studies that apply current physical theories of the evolution
of networks on OSN – in the sense of definition of OSN
given in Section II. Covered OSN are the Swedish commu-
nity Pussokram.com [19], the Polish community Grono.net
[15], the Community of the Polish Massive Multiplayer
Online Role Playing Game Allseron.com [15], LastFM [15],
the books admirer community Shelfari [15], Flickr [7], [13]
and [18], YouTube [7], LiveJournal [7], Orkut [7], Yahoo
360o [18], Delicious [13], Yahoo Answers [13], LinkedIn
[13] and the Chinese business community Wealink [11].
Other research subjects were databases of journals [12],
email communications within universities [10] and [16] and
communications via XFire, an instant messaging service for
gamers [15].
A. Power-law distribution of vertex size
Barab´asi et al. experimented in 1998 with software to map
how Internet sites are connected [24, p. 62]. The sites were
sorted according to their size (the number of their links).
Barab´asi and Bonabeau [24] expected to find a Poisson
distribution of sizes: that sizes cluster around a mean value
and sites with much more or fewer links are likely to be
an exception. But the measurements refute the expectation:
More than 80 percent of sites had less than four links, but in
a minority of less than 0.01 percent had each site more than
a thousand links. According to these results the World Wide
Web is held together by very few, very large connection-
rich vertices. The sorting of the sites with regard to their
138

ICIW 2012 : The Seventh International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services

size revealed a “power law”: the probability that any site
has exactly k links is roughly proportional to 1/kn. The
associated distribution curve does not have the pronounced
peak at the typical size, but “is instead described by a
continuously decreasing function [24, p. 63].”
Among the 15 most relevant articles were found that
distribution of node size – the number of their incoming
and outgoing connections – on Allseron.com, Grono.net,
LastFM and Shelfari follows the power-law scaling form [15,
p. 107]. Also Flickr, LiveJournal, Orkut and YouTube “show
properties consistent with power-law networks [7, p. 36].”
The distribution of vertices according to their size of Flickr
and Yahoo 360o [18, p. 613] and Wealink [11, p. 1107]
revealed a power law. By focusing on the microscopic vertex
behavior of Flickr, Delicious, LinkedIn and Yahoo Answers
it was also analytically shown that the edge initiation process
can be captured by exponential vertex lifetimes and a “gap
model” based on a power law [13, p. 470]. The degree
distribution of vertices on Pussokram.com does not “fits
a power-law form across the whole range observed [19,
p. 165].” The degree is the number of edges connected
to a vertex. However, the authors refer to a study of the
French OSN nioki.com that has reported a power-law of the
cumulative degree distribution. They conclude that “a closer
inspection of our graphs... reveals a striking similarity in the
functional form of the distribution. We therefore conclude
that the dynamics shaping the degree distribution is to a large
extent the same for the two communities [19, p. 165].”
B. Scale-freedom
The term scale-free means: there is no vertex size, which
could be considered as “normal” and thus could apply as a
measure [24, p. 62]. “Over the past few years, investigators
from a variety of fields have discovered that many networks
– from the World Wide Web to a cell’s metabolic system
to actors in Hollywood – are dominated by a relatively
small number of nodes that are connected to many other
sites. Networks containing such important nodes, or hubs,
tend to be what we call “scale-free,” in the sense that some
hubs have a seemingly unlimited number of links and no
node is typical of the others [24, p. 62].” Among the 15
most relevant articles it was found that the OSN Flickr,
LiveJournal, Orkut and YouTube show scale-free properties
[7, p. 32]. The authors of [7] calculated a value called ‘scale-
free metrics’ that stands between 0 and 1 and measures the
extent to which the graph of an OSN has a hub-like core. “A
high scale-free metric means that high-degree nodes tend to
connect to other high-degree nodes, while a low scale-free
metric means that high-degree nodes tend to connect to low-
degree nodes [7, p. 38].” The values are 0.49 for Flickr, 0.34
for LiveJournal, 0.36 for Orkut and 0.19 for YouTube. “All
of the networks with the exception of YouTube, indicating
that high-degree nodes tend to connect to other high-degree
nodes, and low-degree nodes tend to connect to low-degree
nodes [7, p. 38].”
C. Preferential attachment
Barab´asi and Bonabeau [24] attribute scale-freedom to
two causes. First the older a vertex is, the more opportunities
it had to build links. Therefore, vertices tend to be greater the
longer they have been in the network. The second cause was
called “preferential attachment”. New vertices are connected
preferentially with the major vertices and therefore major
vertices are getting greater and greater over time. “... as new
nodes appear, they tend to connect to the more connected
sites, and these popular locations thus acquire more links
over time than their less connected neighbors. And this “rich
get richer” process will generally favor the early nodes,
which are more likely to eventually become hubs [24, p.
65].”
Among the 15 most relevant articles the authors of [13]
aim “to quantify the amount of preferential attachment that
occurs in networks [13, p. 470].” For Flickr, Delicious,
LinkedIn and Yahoo Answers they found that preferential
attachment “is a reasonable model for edge destination
selection [13, p. 465].” Using the statistical method of
maximum-likelihood estimation, they show distortions in
two assumptions of the preferential-attachment-theory: edge
attachment by degree of vertices and edge attachment by the
age of a vertex.
D. Small World
According to Watts and Strogatz [26] the connection
topology of networks is neither completely regular nor
completely random. “But many biological, technological and
social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes
[26, p. 440].” They are regular networks with increasing
amounts of disorders. “We found that these systems can
be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small
characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them
‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world
phenomenon... [26, p. 440].” Watts and Strogatz refer to
experiments of the social psychologist Stanley Milgram [27]
in the 1960s, in which letters passed from person to person
were able to reach an individual target in six steps. This was
attributed to a few people who have had a lot of connections
to other people (“hubs” in modern words) and have been
addressed for transmission.
According to Barab´asi and Bonabeau [24] scale-free
networks have also small-world properties. Even a large
network with purely randomly placed connections has usu-
ally this property [24, p. 68]. If a person has one hundred
acquaintances and any of them has again one hundred
acquaintances, then 10.000 people are only two handshakes
away from this person. And a million people are about three
handshakes away [24, p. 68].
Studies have shown that the World Wide Web, scientific
collaboration on research papers and general social networks
139

ICIW 2012 : The Seventh International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services

have small-world properties [7, p. 32]. Among the 15 most
relevant articles small-world properties were found for the
OSN Allseron.com [15], Grono.net [15], LastFm [15], Shel-
fari [15], XFire [15], Flickr [7], YouTube [7], LiveJournal
[7] and Orkut [7].
E. Clustering
According to Barab´asi and Bonabeau [24] the calculation
in Section III/D has a hook: It is assumed that the acquain-
tances do not know each other. “In reality, there is much
overlap [24, p. 68].” In fact, already in the second stage fewer
than 10.000 people come together. This is because the soci-
ety “is fragmented into clusters of individuals having similar
characteristics (such as income or interests)... [24, p. 68].”
Clustering is found in various networks. “At first glance,
isolated clusters of highly interconnected nodes appear to
run counter to the topology of scale-free networks, in which
a number of hubs radiate throughout the system, linking
everything. Recently, however, we have shown that the two
properties are compatible: a network can be both highly clus-
tered and scale-free when small, tightly interlinked clusters
of nodes are connected into larger, less cohesive groups...
[24, p. 68].”
Among the 15 most relevant articles the ‘clustering co-
efficient’ is introduced as a measure for the cluster. “The
clustering coefficient of a node with N neighbors is defined
as the number of directed links that exist between the
node’s N neighbors, divided by the number of possible
directed links that could exist between the node’s neighbors
(N(N −1)) [7, p. 39].” Observed clustering coefficients are
0.313 for Flickr, 0.330 for LiveJournal, 0.171 for Orkut and
0.136 for YouTube [7, p. 39]. “The clustering coefficients of
social networks are between three and five orders of mag-
nitude larger than their corresponding random graphs. This
unusually high clustering coefficient suggests the presence
of strong local clustering, and has a natural explanation in
social networks: people tend to be introduced to other people
via mutual friends, increasing the probability that two friends
of a single user are also friends [7, p. 39].”
IV. CRITICISM ON PHYSICAL THEORIES ON OSN
Criticism comes from the sociology. The sociologist Scott
states: “Because of an apparent decline in the number of
soluble theoretical problems that are left to resolve in their
own discipline, a growing number of theoretical physicists
have begun to explore the implications of some of their
mathematical ideas for the explanation of social and eco-
nomic phenomena [23, p. 55].” According to Scott, some
physicians present their arguments as new - but they are
not new at all. “The much-trumpeted innovations that lie
at the heart of their ’revolution’ - the power law and hubs
- are well-known and well-established findings of social
network analysts [23, p. 62].” According to the sociologist
“it is certainly the case that the terminology of scale-
free distribution or power law was not used, but standard
frequency distribution tables were used precisely in order to
display this pattern [23, p. 60].”
Despite the criticism Scott attests the “new social physics”
some good ideas and calls for an interdisciplinary exchange.
“Much research in social network analysis has been static
and cross-sectional ... This perspective has converged with
uses of complexity theory and agent-based computational
methods to begin to produce more powerful and productive
examinations of longitudinal change [23, p. 64].”
V. ADOPTION OF PHYSICAL THEORIES ON OSN IN
COMPUTER SCIENCE
This section investigates how physical theories on OSN
are picked up by computer scientists. To measure this ACM
Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library and ISI Web

collections regarding computer science and queried on 10th
January 2012. Selection criterion was ‘most cited’ on IEEE
Xplore Digital Library, ‘times cited’ on ISI Web of Knowl-
egde and ‘citation count’ on ACM Digital Library. Searched
was in abstract, title and content of articles. Among the
results of every searched phrase three articles were randomly
chosen and proved that the terms used in the articles were

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied OSN, seen through the glasses
of the physical approach of a “new science of networks”.
Some physical theories of the evolution of OSN are widely
discussed among computer scientists: small world effect,
clustering, power-law distribution of vertex size and scale-
freedom. On the contrary, only very few publications of
computer scientists deal with preferential attachment on
OSN. Hence this topic was identified as a future research
gap.
A. Future research gap: Preferential attachment on OSN
Physical theories on OSN are already picked up by
computer science – but to varying degrees. Most discussed
is the small world effect on OSN (15.679 results). Even
the phenomenon of clustering on OSN (10.064 results) and
the power-law distribution of vertex size in connection with
OSN (964 results) attracts a lot of publications in computer
science. Fewer articles deal with the scale-freedom of OSN
(682 results). Surprisingly few articles have been published
to the topic preferential attachment on OSN: 361 results.
These are only 2.30 percent of the number of articles
published to the small world effect on OSN – the number of
published articles is out of proportion to the importance of
the topic. According to Barab´asi and Bonabeau the process
of preferential attachment occurs anywhere [24, p. 64].
“Likewise, the most relevant articles in the scientific litera-
ture stimulate even more researchers to read and cite them, a
phenomenon that noted sociologist Robert K. Merton called
the Matthew effect, after a passage in a Christian gospel:
”For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall
have abundance [24, p. 65].” In other areas – like the Internet
and the U.S. biotech industry – preferential attachment has
already been explored [24, p. 65]. Open questions, occurring
through the identified research gap, are listed in Section V/C.
B. Limitations
A shortcoming of this paper is that the social networks,
described in the 15 most relevant articles, are not homoge-
neous. Only a few are OSN in the sense of definition in
Section II, for instance grono.net [15] or Wealink [11]. This
applies to the database queries: During the calculation of the
total number of results was not differentiated between OSN
in the strict sense of definition in Section II and in a broader
sense.
Another shortcoming lies in the lack of empirical studies
among the 15 most relevant articles on the evolution of
MySpace and Facebook, currently the largest OSN. To prove
this, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library and
ISI Web of Knowledge were queried on 26th January 2012.
Search terms were ‘Facebook’, ‘MySpace’, ‘social network’
and ‘evolution’. Selection criterion was ‘most cited’ on IEEE
Xplore Digital Library, ‘times cited’ on ISI Web of Knowl-
egde and ‘citation count’ on ACM Digital Library. Searched
was in abstract, title and content of articles. In the case of
Facebook the query revealed 1261 results, in the case of
MySpace 596 results. In both cases, the abstracts of the first
50 results of ACM Digital Library were checked, and even
the abstracts of all results of IEEE Xplore Digital Library
and ISI Web of Knowlegde. Articles that deal explicitly with
the evolution of Facebook and MySpace were not found.
There were, however, founded articles that already belong
to the fundus of the 15 most relevant articles, for instance
[7], [18] and [28].
According to Ellison et al. much of the existing academic
research on Facebook has focused on identity presentation
and privacy concerns [4]. Ryan und Xenos accentuate:
“Despite the potential implications of Facebook use, there is
a distinct lack of empirically derived theory in this area [6,
p. 1658].” This could be, because Facebook is a relatively
recent phenomenon, and as such, there has been limited
opportunity for exploratory research [6].
C. Open Issues
The exploration of preferential attachment on OSN opens
up a series of research questions for computer scientists.
How is this process structured on OSN? How do the running
of this process on OSN differ from the running in the offline
world? How does the preferential attachment influence the
dynamics of the evolution of OSN? What does preferential
attachment for designing and conducting of OSN mean?
How could a theory of preferential attachment be used
to improve current OSN and to design new applications
for OSN? How does preferential attachment influence the
stability of OSN? Is it possible, to transfer the findings on
preferential attachment, which have been obtained through
the OSN, in the offline world?
Not only the “new science”-model, which was presented
in this paper, uses preferential attachment, also other mech-
anisms do [28, p. 843]. “The transitive linking model...,
which is based on continuously completing triangles with
only an edge missing, is one such example [28, p. 843].”
Another point of view is a fitness-based approach. “In
any fitness-based approach, each node has its own fitness
value and they are linked by the function of their fitness
values [28, p. 843].” Hence further research could be done
by computer scientists to compare and to integrate these
different approaches and, if possible, to apply the integrated
approach on OSN.
It could also stimulate research to include the perspectives
of other sciences. OSN had attracted scientists of different
backgrounds – at this point mostly physicists and computer
scientists [11, p. 1110]. “However the main body in the
virtual world is still persons in real world, thus as pointed
out by Tim Berners-Lee – the “father of the World Wide
Web”, understanding the web community may also require
insights from sociology and psychology every bit as much
as from physics and computer science... [11, p. 1110].”
