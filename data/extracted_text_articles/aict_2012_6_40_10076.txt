Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the potentiality of a
wireless optical communication system in an indoor environment
for both line of sight (LOS) and diffuse conﬁgurations by
taking into account transmitter mobility. Statistical model of the
mobile optical channel is deﬁned for each conﬁguration. Our
contribution is to determine the outage probability and then the
outage capacity considering an On-Off Keying modulation and
different data rates. From the results one can obtain the outage
probability value which maximizes the outage capacity for the
considered indoor mobility scenario. We ﬁnally show the LOS
performance gain provided by Forward Error Correction (FEC),
considering Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes of different
lengths.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, wireless optical communications are popular
technologies which offer many advantages such as low com-
plexity implementation and high secured transmissions. In-
frared (IR) transmissions constitute an interesting alternative
solution to radio-frequency (RF) one for many indoor and
home applications [1]. Actually, IR systems intrinsically offer
several beneﬁts over RF systems due to the absence of multi-
path fading and robustness to electromagnetic interferences
(EMI). Moreover, optical systems permit having an unreg-
ulated and quasi-unlimited bandwidth [1,2]. However, IR
systems suffer from a high path loss, a reduced coverage area
and lower link budget compared to RF systems.
Two kinds of IR systems are generally considered: LOS
(Line Of Sight) links and diffuse links [2]. The LOS propa-
gation is the most commonly used scheme. It permits guar-
anteeing high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). For IR short
range indoor communications, the main drawback is the se-
vere impact on the path loss due to misalignments between
transmitter and receiver [1]. On the other side, in diffuse
conﬁguration, the light is emitted toward a reﬂective surface
and the detector collects the reﬂected power from this surface.
Diffuse conﬁguration permits obtaining higher coverage area
than in the LOS one but this is done at the cost of a reduction
of the optical received power (lower SNR).
However, for both systems, mobility of transmitter or re-
ceiver signiﬁcantly decreases the performances due to the
variations of the distance between transmitter and receiver.
In this case, outage probability evaluation permits quantifying
attainable data rates and quality of service for the optical com-
municating system. Besides, the mobile system potentiality
can be well described by analyzing the channel capacity.
The paper is organized as follows: after presenting the
state of the art in Section II, the optical transmission system
is described in Section III. We then evaluate the outage
probability in Section IV in LOS and diffuse conﬁgurations
using a statistical approach. In Section V, we estimate the
outage capacity for both conﬁgurations considering the non-
stationary channel. In order to illustrate the performance of a
FEC, Section VI deals with different LDPC codes in a LOS
conﬁguration.
II. STATE OF THE ART
Capacity of optical channel has been already studied in
the case of free space optical transmissions over atmospheric
channel subject to scintillation in [5] and [6], respectively,
with and without channel side information. Capacities of other
outdoor optical channel have been explored, in [7], authors
analyse the effect of pointing errors and in [8] and [9],
authors determine the capacity considering multiple receivers.
However, to the best of our knowledge, capacity of indoor
mobile optical channel has not been yet investigated.
Our contribution is to determine the performance of LOS
and diffuse conﬁgurations considering a statistical model of
the mobile indoor optical channel to evaluate the outage
probability. From the outage probability analysis, we evaluate
the capacity of this channel for both LOS and diffuse conﬁg-
urations. Besides, we illustrate the gain provided by Forward
Error Correction (FEC) on the LOS optical transmission by
considering different LDPC codes.
III. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
We consider an indoor environment and a communication
link between a mobile transmitter in the environment and a
base station placed on the ceiling.
The transmitter is at (x1, y1, z1) in a room supposed to be
free of any obstacles and represented by a box of dimensions
(3m,4m,2.5m). The receiver is supposed to be placed on the
middle of the ceiling at (x2 = 1.5m, y2 = 2m, z2 = 2.5m)
and is pointed toward the ﬂoor to achieve minimum path losses
(see Fig. 1).
Data are sent by using an IR communication system based
on Intensity Modulation and Direct Detection (IM/DD). The
transmitted signal is thus an optical power which is always

positive and the channel can be modeled by a linear system [1].
The received signal Y (t) can be written as:
Y (t) = RX(t) ⊗ h(t) + N(t)
(1)
where X(t) is the instantaneous optical power, R is the photo-
diode responsivity, and h(t) represents the impulse response
of the optical channel. N(t) represents the Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) [3].
In the following, we study two IR propagation types: LOS
and diffuse ones. For LOS case, the directivity of both optical
emitter and receiver does not allow multipath propagation. For
diffuse case, delay spread D is typically equal to 10 ns [1] and
is supposed to be negligible compared to low rate transmission
(D << 1/Rb). For higher rates, intersymbol interference can
be compensated by an equalization module. Thus the impulse
response is only characterized by its static gain H such as:
h(t) = Hδ(t). On Off Keying (OOK) modulation is used to
transmit symbols over the AWGN channel. At the reception,
the electrical SNR is proportional to the square of the received
optical power due to photo-diode detection [1]:
SNR = 2R2P 2
t H2
N0Rb
(2)
where Pt is the average transmitted power, N0, the noise
power-spectral density and Rb the transmission data rate.
In this study, we have chosen R = 0.55 A/W. N0 is
determined considering that shot noise is the dominant noise
source [2]: N0 = 2Ibq with mean current Ib = 200 µA and
q = 1.6 × 10−19 C thus N0 = 6.4 × 10−23 W/Hz.
A difference between LOS and diffuse conﬁgurations ap-
pears in H expression. In a LOS conﬁguration, the static gain
H directly depends on the distance d between the transmitter
and the receiver and can be evaluated by [1]:
H =
A
πd2
(3)
where A is the photo-detector physical surface. Note that this
corresponds to the case where LOS transmitter is perfectly
aligned with the receiver.
For the diffuse conﬁguration, the channel gain is obtained
using ceiling bounce model [4]. The received power is com-
puted by summing all the contributions of tiny elements of
the reﬂective surface (the ﬂoor). The static gain can be thus
expressed by:
H = ρAz2

(z2
1+(x−x1)2+(y−y1)2)2(z2
2+(x−x2)2+(y−y2)2)2
(4)
where ρ is the ﬂoor reﬂectivity.
For both LOS and diffuse conﬁgurations, we consider a
typical physical area A = 1 cm2 and ρ = 0.8. In order to
respect eye safety regulations, Pt have been set to 20 mW
for the LOS conﬁguration and to 300 mW for the diffuse
one which are the typical allowed transmitted power [10]. The
diffuse Field Of View (FOV) of the receiver is set to 70◦.
In order to represent the transmitter mobility, as a ﬁrst
approach, we model its location within the room by Gaussian

and N(2, 0.36) and N(1.2, 0.09) distributions. The means of
the position distributions along x and y axis are chosen equal
to the middle of the room, which means that the transmitter
presence is more probable in this area (for example for a
transmitter placed on a person who moves inside the room).
The mean of the distribution in z is chosen equal to 1.2 m
and corresponds for example to a transmitter placed at the
belt level of a person. The variances of the distributions were
deﬁned so that to include 98% of distribution data inside the
room.
We can note that by considering mobility, H varies due to
the distance variations between the transmitter and the receiver.
This is analyzed in the following Sections.

In the context studied, H variations are slow in the bit time
even for the lowest considered data rate. Optical channel can

Outage Probability versus SNR in diffuse conﬁguration for OOK
modulation
be thus considered as a slow fading channel [1]. Consequently,
average BER does not represent a good metric to describe
transmission performance. Instead, the outage probability is
used to estimate the performance. The outage probability is
deﬁned as the probability that the capacity C of the channel
does not support the rate R0 of the transmission [11]. Since
the capacity is a monotonic function of SNR, the outage
probability can be expressed as a function of a SNR threshold
(SNR0) and corresponds to the probability that the SNR value
at a given time drops below SNR0:
Pout = Pr[C(SNR) < R0] = Pr[SNR < SNR0]
(5)
Assuming the mobility scenario we have deﬁned, it is
possible to determine the value of the outage capacity for a
given SNR0 using Monte Carlo (MC) method. This method
is proceeded according to the transmitter position distribution
(which has been considered Gaussian and inside the room).
For each point, the SNR is computed from (2) and from H
expressions (3) or (4) depending on the conﬁguration (LOS
or diffuse). The outage probability is equal to the fraction of
points whose SNR is below SNR0 among the total number
of points.
Figs. 2 and 3 present outage probability Pout versus SNR0,
estimated with MC method for LOS and diffuse conﬁgura-
tions. The results have been plotted for different rates Rb.
As expected, we can see that, for both conﬁgurations,
outage probability increases when the threshold value SNR0
increases. Moreover this performance degradation also de-
pends on the data rate of the transmission and becomes all the
more signiﬁcant as Rb increases. Even if the same behavior
can be observed in LOS and diffuse conﬁgurations, the outage
probability in the LOS conﬁguration is more sensible to SNR0.
For example, in the LOS conﬁguration, if the system
requires a SNR0 of 15.6dB (to ensure a BER below 10−9
when the system is not in outage), and if the targeted outage
probability is 10−3, results reported in Fig. 2 show that the data

rate has to be chosen below 3 Mbps. In diffuse conﬁguration, if
we consider the same outage probability of 10−3, we observe
in Fig. 3 that the rate has to be lower than 600Kbps.
In order to illustrate the performance in both conﬁgurations,
we now determine the probability density function of the SNR
inside the room by deriving Pout with respect to SNR. SNR
distributions are presented in Fig. 4 for both conﬁgurations
and for the same data rate of 1Mbps.
We can note that the SNR distribution in LOS conﬁguration
admits a minimum value SNRmin = 17dB corresponding to
a case where the transmitter is placed on the ﬂoor, in a corner
(d = dmax.) Maximum SNR value (SNRmax = 35dB) is
obtained when the transmitter is placed beneath the receiver
at a maximum height of 1.5m (due to mobility constraints). In
diffuse conﬁguration, the SNR distribution admits a greater
spreading than in the LOS case. Moreover, the diffuse case
presents a lower average SNR value (SNR = 27.44dB)
compared to LOS one (SNR = 29.5dB).
These SNR distributions represent the non-stationnarity due
to the particular mobility scenario we study for the indoor op-
tical wireless channel in both LOS and diffuse conﬁgurations.
V. OUTAGE CAPACITY
In this paper, we consider a binary input (due to the OOK
modulation) and continuous output AWGN channel (due to
the noise present over the optical channel).
For stationary channel, the capacity of binary input continu-
ous output AWGN channel does not admit a close form. Thus,
this capacity has to be evaluated by using [14]:

where p(y|x) are the conditional probabilities of the received
signal and follow Gaussian distributions N(RHX, RbN0).
p(x) corresponds to the probability of the symbol x. Since the
channel is symmetric (6) is maximized when p(x = 0) and

Capacity of LOS wireless indoor channel for OOK modulation
p(x = 1) are equal to 0.5. The capacity is bounded between
0 and 1 due to the binary input.
For non-stationary (ﬂat fading) channel, the capacity de-
pends on the information available at the receiver [11]. In
this paper, we assume that the receiver has full and perfect
knowledge of the Channel State Information (CSI). This can
be obtained by inserting pilot symbols during the transmission.
At the receiver, these pilot symbols are used to evaluate
instantaneous SNR (or equivalently, instantaneous H).
The outage capacity, which well describes the performance
of quasi-static channel, is deﬁned as the average information
rate that can be received with a given outage probability which
increases the information rate. The transmitter ﬁxes a rate a
priori and sends data over the channel of capacity C(SNR)
(see eq. (6)). With a given outage probability, the average
information rate correctly received is [11]:
Cout = (1 − Pout(SNR0)) C(SNR0)
(7)
Note that Cout is proportional to (1−Pout) which corresponds
to the absence of transmitted information (i.e. a null capacity)
during outage events.
Figs. 5 and 6 present outage capacity versus outage proba-
bility for LOS and diffuse conﬁgurations. In both cases, outage
capacity is computed with (6) and (7) for different data rates
corresponding to different SNR reported in parenthesis on
the ﬁgures. The outage probability has been estimated using
previously described MC method.
Outage capacity for both conﬁgurations is bounded between
0 and 1 due to the input constraint.
When Pout tends to 1, the receiver is always in outage and
the maximum information rate that can be transmitted between
transmitter and receiver tends to 0 (Cout = 0). On the other
side, when Pout tends to zero, Cout attempts a minimal value
equal to C(SNRmin) where SNRmin is the lower SNR that
can be received in the room.
Between these two values of Pout, there is a given value of
the outage probability maximizing the channel capacity. This

Capacity of diffuse wireless indoor channel for OOK modulation
value depends on the data rate i.e. SNR, and increases when
data rate or SNR decrease.
For LOS conﬁguration, the maximal capacity is obtained
for Pout belonging in [10−3, 10−1] for data rates between 5
and 50Mbps. Data rates of 5Mbps and 50Mbps corresponds
to SNR in LOS conﬁguration of 22.5 and 12.5dB. The outage
capacity is reduced when SNR decreases. For example, the
maximal capacity varies from 1 to 0.75 bit/channel use for
respectively 5Mbps and 50Mbps. Capacity equal to 1 means
that there is no need to use FEC to achieve the maximal infor-
mation rate. An outage capacity below 1 (e.g. Cout = 0.75)
means that using error correction codes (of rate 0.75 in this
example), a reliable transmission over the channel can be
achieved.
In diffuse conﬁguration same remarks can be done. The
outage probability which maximizes the capacity is obtained in
the interval [10−3, 10−1] for gross data rate between 500Kbps
and 20Mbps (i.e. SNR of 30.44dB and 14.43dB). The corre-
sponding outage capacity is included in the interval [1, 0.85].
To compare the two conﬁgurations, we consider a gross data
rate of 20Mbps. We can note in Figs. 5 and 6 that the maximal
capacity is obtained for Pout of 10−2 in LOS conﬁguration and
is equal to 0.9 bit/channel use whereas it is of 0.8 in diffuse one
for Pout around 10−1. Consequently, diffuse channel presents
lower capacities with higher outage probabilities than the LOS
channel.
In the following, we illustrate FEC performance for a given
LOS conﬁguration.
VI. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF LDPC CODES
Different LDPC codes will be applied to the LOS channel
in order to estimate the gain provided by FEC. A LDPC(N,K)
is a linear block code and can be deﬁned by its rate r = K/N,
where K is the length of information bits and N is the
codeword length [12]. The net data rate is thus reduced and
can be expressed by Ra = (K/N) × Rb, where Rb is the
gross data rate of the transmission. We consider here regular
LDPC codes wih a decoding process based on message passing

Performance of LDPC coded transmissions in LOS conﬁguration for
OOK modulation and Rb = 50 Mbps
algorithm [12]. In order to improve the performance, the
decoder uses soft-demodulation followed by the sum-product
algorithm [13].
In order to estimate the performance of coded transmission
for the two conﬁgurations, we introduce a threshold bit error
rate BER0. Outage probability can be thus expressed as a
function of BER0:
Pout = Pr[SNR < SNR0] = Pr[BER > BER0]
(8)
where BER = f(SNR) is a monotonically decreasing func-
tion depending on the error correcting codes and the mod-
ulation scheme used. Since close form of this function is
only known for uncoded transmission, the estimation of f(.)
function for coded transmission over stationary optical channel
with OOK modulation and using regular LDPC codes has been
done by simulation. We consider a gross data rate of 50Mbps
and an outage probability of 10−3. We can see in Fig. 5, that
the LOS channel provides a capacity of 0.5 bit/channel use for
this example. We have thus considered LDPC codes of rate
1/2 and of lengths 500, 1000 and 2000.
Fig. 7 presents the performance of coded and uncoded
transmissions on the graph Pout versus BER0 for LOS con-
ﬁguration.
As expected, we can see that LDPC of rate 1/2 can achieve
lower Pout than in the uncoded case. Actually, the coded
performances approach the capacity bound of 10−3. Moreover,
we can note that the outage probability decreases when the
length of the code increases. For example, for a BER of 10−6,
the outage probability varies from 3 × 10−2 to 1 × 10−2 for
respectively N = 500 and N = 1000, whereas the outage
probability in the uncoded case is around 0.5.
Thus, LDPC codes provide an efﬁcient way to improve the
performance of the optical link and permit reducing the outage
probability for a given transmission.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have evaluated the performance of LOS
and diffuse wireless optical transmissions in indoor environ-
ment by considering the mobility of the optical transmitter. For
OOK modulation, we have estimated the outage probability
of each link conﬁguration using simulations. From the results,
one can determine the attainable data rate for a given quality
of service. We have then studied the system potentiality by
evaluating the outage capacity. In each conﬁguration case,
the outage probability that maximizes the capacity for a
given data rate has been obtained. We have observed that the
diffuse channel presents lower capacities with higher outage
probabilities than the LOS one.
The performance gain for LOS case with regular LDPC
codes of different lengths has been ﬁnally presented. The
results have shown that this constitutes an interesting solution
to enhance the performance (in terms of outage probability)
of a mobile indoor IR transmission.
