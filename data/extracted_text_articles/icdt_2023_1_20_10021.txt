Abstract—The
Stereophonic
Acoustic
Echo
Cancellation
(SAEC) setup implies the estimation of four loudspeaker-to-
microphone unknown impulse responses, which generate un-
wanted acoustic replicas (i.e., echoes). In this context, some state-
of-the-art approaches that combine the Widely Linear (WL)
model with various versions of the Recursive Least-Squares
(RLS) algorithm have been recently proposed. This paper focuses
on the most recent one – the version that uses a Data-Reuse (DR)
approach over the WL-RLS based on Dichotomous Coordinate
Descent (DCD) iterations, i.e., the namely WL-DR-RLS-DCD.
The target of the paper is to present how this algorithm behaves
in various conditions, for input signals that present a very high
correlation, such as speech or Auto-Regressive (AR) sequences.
Simulations results proved that the DR approach is suitable in
the SAEC context.

I. INTRODUCTION
Stereophonic communication creates the sensation of audio
directionality by employing for each terminal two loudspeak-
ers and two microphones, respectively [1]–[3]. When perform-
ing the Stereophonic Acoustic Echo Cancellation (SAEC),
a total number of four echo paths must be estimated in
order to mitigate the echo effect produced by any of the
four associated loudspeaker-to-microphone pairs. The standard
approach for such scenarios is the implementation of four
individual adaptive systems, usually based on the Least-Mean-
Squares (LMS) family of algorithms [4]–[6]. However, despite
their low arithmetic costs, the LMS methods provide limited
performance when working with highly correlated input sig-
nals (such as speech sequences) due to gradient noise [4].
In [7]–[9], the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm [4]
was combined with the dichotomous coordinate descent
(DCD) iterations [10], and employed in SAEC scenarios in
order to improve performance, especially in terms of conver-
gence rate and computational complexity. The widely linear
(WL) model described in [1][8], was used as a framework
in order to improve the handling of the system, by grouping
the four adaptive filters working with real valued variables
into a single adaptive system working with fewer complex
valued variables (CRVs). The resulting WL-RLS-DCD method
has acceptable arithmetic workloads and performance levels
comparable with other consecrated RLS versions, such as the
one based on Woodburry’s identity [4].
This paper analyzes the performance of an improved version
of the WL-RLS-DCD algorithm designed for superior tracking
capabilities, which requires minimal extra arithmetic costs. A
Data-Reuse (DR) approach for the WL-RLS-DCD adaptive
method will be described, which re-uses the same input data
multiples times for each of the adaptive filter’s iterations. An
analysis will be performed in several scenarios in order to
demonstrate the capabilities of the new WL-DR-RLS-DCD
method, and several other aspects will be discussed.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
the mathematical model of the WL framework for RLS
adaptive systems. Section III presents the WL-DR-RLS-DCD
algorithm, which is suitable for improving its corresponding
tracking speeds. Section IV discusses simulation results for
the proposed algorithm in the SAEC setup, and the paper is
concluded by a few conclusions in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
In the SAEC configuration, for each discrete-time index
n, we store the last L samples corresponding to xLc(n) and
xRc(n) (i.e., the left and right channels) in the L × 1 vectors
denoted by xLc(n), respectively xRc(n) [1][8]. Furthermore,
the echo contributions associated with the stereo channels can
be obtained using the input vectors and the four possible
L×1 echo path impulse responses denoted by gt,LcLc, gt,LcRc,
gt,RcLc, and gt,RcRc [8][9]:
yLc(n) = gT
t,LcLcxLc(n) + gT
t,RcLcxRc(n),
(1)
yRc(n) = gT
t,LcRcxLc(n) + gT
t,RcRcxRc(n),
(2)
where T represents the transpose operator. As a consequence,
the microphone (or reference) signals can be written as
dLc(n) = yLc(n) + wLc(n),
(3)
dRc(n) = yRc(n) + wRc(n),
(4)
with wLc(n) and wRc(n) being environmental noise signals.
When we apply the WL model, we can use j = √−1 to
combine the inputs and the outputs of the SAEC unknown
echo paths into the complex input signal
x(n) = xLc(n) + jxRc(n),
(5)

ICDT 2023 : The Eighteenth International Conference on Digital Telecommunications

respectively the complex output
y(n) = yLc(n) + jyRc(n).
(6)
When applying this approach for the vectors xLc(n) and
xRc(n), then interleaving the resulting complex valued L × 1
vector with its complex conjugate version, a 2L × 1 input
vector ex(n) is obtained [1][8][9]. Similarly, the unknown echo
paths can be linearly combined and interleaved in order to
generate a single 2L × 1 complex valued unknown system
denoted as egt [1][8][9].
Furthermore, the complex valued output can be written as
y(n) = egH
t ex(n),
(7)
where H denotes the Hermitian operator.
We can write the complex valued noise signal
w(n) = wLc(n) + jwRc(n),
(8)
and also the expression for the complex reference as
d(n) = y(n) + w(n).
(9)
Thus, we express the complex error as
e(n) = d(n) − ey(n),
(10)
where ey(n) is the estimate of the complex valued system’s
output determined with the adaptive filter’s set of coefficients
eg(n), which is employed to approximate egt.
The WL framework improves the handling of SAEC ap-
plications using adaptive algorithms. It re-casts four unknown
system identification problems into a single one. The two-
input/two-output system with real random variables is ex-
pressed as a single-input/single-output system with CRVs.
III. THE WL-DR-RLS-DCD ALGORITHM
The process of generating the estimate eg(n) can be ap-
proached in SAEC scenarios using RLS filters due to their
increased performance when working with highly correlated
signals, such as speech. In [8][10], the complex valued leading
DCD was employed in combination with the RLS algorithm in
order to decrease the corresponding arithmetic complexity and
mitigate their prohibitive nature when approaching hardware
implementations. The DCD requires only additions and bit-
shifts to solve an auxiliary system of equations, by exploiting
the properties of the input signal [8][10].
The RLS-DCD method applied to the WL setup (i.e., the
WL-RLS-DCD) is presented in Table I, where we denoted
by ϵ a small positive constant employed to initialize the
correlation matrix in a non-singular form, and by R(:,1)(n)
the first column of the matrix R(n). Steps 1 and 2 update
the complex input vector ex(n), respectively the 2L × 2L
correlation matrix estimate R(n), using the time-shift property
of the input signal and the forgetting factor λ (0 < λ ≤ 1),
which determines the memory of the algorithm [1][9]. After
computing the filter output and the corresponding error in steps
3 and 4, the residual component p0(n) is updated in step 5
using the residual vector r(n − 1) [8][10]. Consequently, the
DCD iterations are employed in step 6 in order to solve an
auxiliary system of equations and generate the 2L×1 complex
valued solution vector ∆eg(n), and an updated version of r(n).
In the final step of the WL-RLS-DCD (i.e., step 7), the solution
vector is used to update the filter coefficients eg(n). The overall
complexity of the algorithm is proportional to the value 2L
multiplied by a small factor, which makes it attractive for
hardware implementations.

eg(n) = eg(n − 1) + ∆eg(n)
The tracking speed of the WL-RLS-DCD can be improved
using the DR approach [9][11][12], which employs the same
input data multiple times per each time index n. The DCD
method is run for a number of Nit iterations (i.e., for ϕ =
0 . . . Nit−1), and for each of the solution vectors ∆egϕ(n), the
output signal estimate changes to eyϕ(n) [9] (i.e., it is updated
accordingly):
eyϕ(n) =

ϕ = 0,

(11)
It can be noticed that only the first branch of (11) is used
when the new algorithm has the parameter Nit = 1. In this
case, it is equivalent to the WL-RLS-DCD and only the filter
coefficients from the previous time index (i.e., n − 1) are
required for any computations at time index n. However, if
Nit > 1, then for any DR iteration corresponding to ϕ > 1,
the values corresponding to the filter taps have to be updated
using the solution vector ∆egϕ−1(n) from the previous DR
step (also, from the same time index). In a similar manner,
the value of the error signal is adjusted to reflect the change
in the filter coefficients [9], and to also take advantage of the
results available at previous iterations:
eϕ(n) =
(
d(n) − egH(n − 1)ex(n)
∆= e0(n),
ϕ = 0
eϕ−1(n) + ∆egH
ϕ−1(n)ex(n),
ϕ > 0.
(12)
Furthermore, in order to run the DCD for each DR step, the
residual contributions must be updated and can be expressed
as [9]
p0,ϕ(n) =
(
λrNit−1(n − 1) + e∗
0(n)ex(n),
ϕ = 0
rϕ−1(n) + e∗

The first branch of (13) represents the classical transition
from the previous time index, while the second branch per-
forms the transition from the previous DR iteration. A common
conclusion is also available for (11), (12), respectively (13)
when considering Nit = 1: all the update expressions are
simplified such that the form of the proposed algorithm reverts
back to the steps corresponding to the WL-RLS-DCD method.

The resulting adaptive algorithm, namely the WL-DR-RLS-
DCD, is presented in Table II. It is expected to generate
improved tracking capabilities with the cost of some accuracy
when the adaptive system reaches the steady-state. Moreover,
the overall arithmetic effort remains proportional to the value
2L multiplied by a small number, which includes the contri-
bution of Nit. Simulations will demonstrate that a value of
Nit much smaller than 10 is sufficient in order to generate
satisfactory performance.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
Simulations were performed for the SAEC context working
with the WL framework. Two types of input signal sources
were employed: a Gaussian noise filtered through an auto-
regressive (AR) system with a single pole, and a high quality
speech sequence [13]. Both types are highly correlated, which
challenges the convergence of the algorithms. These inputs
were filtered through two distinct real acoustic impulse re-
sponses in order to achieve the effect of the left and right
channels and generate the samples xLc(n) and xRc(n). For
each acoustic channel, Gaussian noise was added to the echo
signals having the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) experimentally
set to 30 dB.
The pre-distortion approach presented in
[1][7][14] was
also used in order to avoid the problem of the correlation be-
tween the xLc(n) and xRc(n) sequences. The method performs
the addition of a certain level of nonlinearity to these two sig-
nals in order to obtain a unique solution and it is controlled by
a parameter denoted by αr (with 0 < αr < 1). Consequently,
starting with the so-called half-wave rectifier method, we can
generate 2 new signals using the expressions [1][14]:
x′
Lc(n) = xLc(n) + αr
xLc(n) + |xLc(n)|
2
,
(14)
x′
Rc(n) = xRc(n) + αr
xRc(n) − |xRc(n)|
2
.
(15)
From a practical point of view, the stereo effect is not impacted
if 0 < αr ≤ 0.5.
In all analyzed cases, the RLS-DCD specific parameters
were chosen as λ = 1 − 1/(KL), H = 1, Nu = 4, and
Mb = 16. The initial convergence is not shown, as it is not
considered relevant [15]. The normalized misalignment has
been chosen as a performance measure:
Mis(n) = 20 log10
∥egt − eg(n)∥2
∥egt∥2
[dB],
(16)
with ∥·∥2 denoting the ℓ2 norm [1].
In Figure 1, the input signal is a Gaussian noise filtered
through an AR(1) system with the pole 0.9. For this scenario,
the signs corresponding to the filter coefficients associated
with the four acoustic impulse responses were suddenly
changed after the adaptive system has reached steady-state.
It can be noticed that, for the same values of αr, the tracking

speed is improved with the increase of Nit. When the input
signals are not pre-distorted, the performance values are the
lowest, even when using Nit = 5 DR iterations. For the value
αr = 0, despite having good initial convergence, the WL-
DR-RLS-DCD with Nit = 5, does not perform well when
reaching steady-state. Moreover, when trying to compensate
the extra DR iterations using αr
=
0.8 (exceeding the
recommended limit of 0.5), the tracking capabilities of the
WL-RLS-DCD (i.e., the WL-DR-RLS-DCD with Nit = 1)
algorithm are weaker than the ones obtained via the DR
variants with αr = 0.4. Finally, taking into account that an
additional workload is introduced by employing multiple DR

iterations, respectively that a performance cap is reached in
terms of tracking capabilities for higher values of Nit, a value
of Nit = 3 DR iterations can be considered sufficient for
attaining the desired effect.

speech sequence, and the length of the four unknown impulse responses is
L = 256 and λ = 1 − 1/(96L). The unknown system changes at t = 150 s
due to the interchanging of the microphones positions.
In Figure 2, the input signal is a high quality speech
sequence [13]. The four echo paths are suddenly changed at
steady-state to:
(
gt,LcLc = gt,LcRc,
gt,RcLc = gt,RcRc,
and
(
gt,LcRc = gt,LcLc,
gt,RcRc = gt,RcLc.
(17)
The adjustment is equivalent to interchanging the microphones
positions from the WL model for the SAEC context. The
displayed results show the performance of the WL-DR-RLS-
DCD for different values of Nit and αr = 0.4. As a reference,
results were also shown for αr = 0. As the value of the DR
parameter increases, so do the tracking capabilities of the WL-
DR-RLS-DCD, until a certain performance cap is revealed. It
can also be noticed that the absence of the pre-processing of
the input signal leads to a noticeable performance gap between
the cases with αr = 0 and αr = 0.4.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The algorithm analyzed in this paper is an enhanced version
of the combination between the exponentially weighted RLS
algorithm and the DCD method [8][10]. The WL-DR-RLS-
DCD is designed to approach the SAEC scenarios by exploit-
ing the properties of the input signal and solve an auxiliary
system of equations using only additions and bit-shifts. The
overall complexity is proportional to the adaptive filter’s length
multiplied by a small number.
Simulation results were presented using Gaussian noise
filtered through an AR(1) system, respectively a speech se-
quence, as inputs. The results have shown that, with respect
to the WL-RLS-DCD, the WL-DR-RLS-DCD has a corre-
sponding compromise between superior tracking capabilities
on one side, respectively estimation accuracy at steady-state
and a slight increase in arithmetic complexity on the other side.
The performance trade-off is controlled from the DR portion of
the algorithm through the number of iterations parameter Nit.
Considering the performance demonstrated by the WL-
DR-RLS-DCD in simulations, the algorithm is attractive for
hardware implementations in system identification scenarios,
such as the SAEC configurations. A generalization to the
multichannel case will be also considered.
