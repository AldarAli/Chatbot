Abstract—This paper presents a link designed for a multi-hop
underwater optical wireless communication system using
green/blue Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). The proposed
system can increase the communication distance using multi-
hop communication compared to single hop communication.
The suggested system uses very simple and inexpensive
hardware to build a cost effective solution. The established link
can support a bandwidth up to 100 KHz for a communication
range up to 1 meter without using any external optics and
without degrading the required signal to noise ratio.

INTRODUCTION
More than two thirds of world’s surface is covered by
water and this area is still mostly undiscovered by human
beings. One efficient and reliable communication system is
the first step towards the invention of this huge underwater
world. Until now, most underwater communication is based
on either wired or acoustic technology. Wired technology
has its limitation in terms of installation, maintenance and
mobility. For short and medium range applications, wireless
is the suitable solution especially underwater, where the
medium is very rough and harsh. So far, acoustic methods
are the dominant underwater communication system used for
long range low bandwidth links, because sound propagates
very well underwater compared to other waves. However,
the limitation of acoustic communication is the lack of
bandwidth to support high speed communications, for
example, sound can propagate up to a few kilometers with a
speed
of
1500m/s,
which
is
not
enough
for
many
applications. Time-varying multipath propagation and low
speed of sound underwater produces a very poor and high
latency communication channel, which cannot support real
time data transfer such as audio/video. Moreover, the cost of
acoustic components is very high and the dimensions of
components are very large. All those limitations of acoustic
communication have stimulated researchers to find a cheap
alternative for underwater communication system capable of
allowing high bandwidth for real time applications.
In this paper, a multi-hop static underwater optical
wireless communication network using visible light has
been proposed. Multi-hop communication is a well-known
technique in free space communication for spatial reuse
which
was
also
proposed
by
many
researchers
for
underwater
optical
wireless
communications.
In
this
process, intermediate nodes relay the information and
control signals to the gateway node which ultimately stores
and sends data to the base station.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
reviews the background and related work. In Section III,
some of the issues related to underwater optical wireless
communication are described. The system design procedure
is described in Section IV, followed by performance
analysis in Section V. Finally, conclusion and future work
are illustrated in Section VI.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Several
research
groups
are
actively
investigating
different
aspects
of
underwater
optical
wireless
communication
systems,
starting
from
channel
characterization to system design. The water medium itself is
a complex medium and light propagation varies in different
types of water at different depths [1], so it is not an easy
option to find a generic channel model for all types of water.
Since underwater optical wireless is a relatively new research
area,
most
of
the
work
until
now
has
focused
on
unidirectional
single
hop
communication,
implemented
either by software or hardware, and also some groups are
investigating sensor applications. Vasilescu et al at MIT
have built an underwater sensor network using visible light
but have used an optical wireless link only to upload the data
from a sensor node to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
[2]. An unidirectional optical wireless link capable of
sending data at 320Kbit/s up to a distance of 2.2m for an
underwater sensor network was presented in [2]. To achieve
this communication distance, a high powered LED array was
used, and this link was only used to upload the sensor data
from sensor node to an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
(AUV). The same group advanced their research to achieve a
data rate of 1.2Mbit/s for a communication range of 30m.
Recently, they reported a bi-directional communication
system to achieve a communication range of 50m [3]. They
used very high power LEDs and expensive optics to obtain
these results.
Chancery designed and tested an FM optical wireless
communication system for underwater which was capable of
sending data at 10Mbps rate [4]. Later, his work was
advanced by Cox, Simpson and Everett to investigate the
various fundamental issues like modulation techniques, error
correction,
high
speed
communication
channels,
etc.

Anguita et al. are working on diffuse underwater optical
wireless sensor network using a planner transceiver [8], but
they
are
concentrating
on
integration
of
free
space
technology with underwater. They have achieved a 100 Kbps
data rate in a communication distance of 1.8m.
Norman and the group at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Research
Center
have
reported
a
high
bandwidth
communication link of 5Mbps over a distance of 200m in
clean water using a diffuse optical communication link [9].
They used both green and blue light to make the system
bidirectional, and an acoustic modem to wake up the sea
floor installation [10].
Amongst
others,
Felix
reported
an
underwater
communication system using the IrDA physical layer with
3Watt, high-power LEDs [11]. Frank proposed a laser-based
communication link which achieved a data rate of 1Gbit/s
over a distance of 2m in a laboratory water pipe, and
predicted that up to 48m could be achieved in clear water
[12]. A cost effective underwater optical modem has been
proposed by Feng to achieve a communication distance up
to 10 meters [13]. Sermask modeled the underwater optical
wireless channel using vector radiative transfer theory to
investigate the multiple scattering and polarization of light
[14]. He calculated the bit error rate of On-Off-Keying
modulation, and 4-level amplitude modulation with different
FOV. Arnon proposed three types of communication links
and analyzed the performance of each type [15]. From his
analysis it is seen that the communication performance
decreased rapidly when water absorption increased, but a
high data rate was still possible.

ISSUES RELATED TO UNDERWATER OPTICAL WIRELESS
SENSOR NETWORK
In this section, some of the fundamental issues related to
underwater
optical
wireless
and
adopted
network
architecture are discussed.
A.
Which spectrum range to select?
An underwater optical wireless channel suffers from
both
scattering
and
absorption,
resulting
in
severe
attenuation. Behavior of light in water depends on the water
components. Sea water is primarily composed of
2
H O, but it
also has different salts, such as
2
2
4
,
,
,
NaCl MgCl Na So KCl
etc., which absorb light at specific wavelengths. Equation
(1)
describes
the
relation
between
attenuation
and
communication distance,

where the transmitter and receiver are placed at d1 and d2,
and k is the attenuation coefficient defined as:
(2)
Here, α is the absorption coefficient which depends on the 
light wavelength, and β is the scattering coefficient which 
mainly depends on wavelength as well as the turbidity of
water.
From the basics of light propagation in water, it is found
that the best wavelengths which propagate in water are in
the green-blue region of the visible spectrum (wavelength
400-550nm), and so two wavelengths within this range have
been selected for the communication system to be described.
B.
Modulation techniques
Modulation techniques play a vital role in all sorts of
communication systems including optical wireless. Three
major
characteristics
of
modulation
techniques
are
transmission efficiency, power efficiency and bandwidth
efficiency. A modulation technique with high bandwidth
efficiency ensures that the overall system bit rate is high; on
the other hand side, power efficiency is needed for longer
life time of the system when run from local finite sources.
Two most common modulation schemes used in optical
wireless are On-Off-Keying (OOK), and Pulse Position
Modulation (PPM).
On Off Keying (OOK) is the simplest form of modulation
in terms of implementation. Here, the optical power is
directly modulated
by varying the source current in
sympathy with the data, whereas on the receiver side the
detector
produces
a
photocurrent
proportional
to
the
received photons. OOK can be either in the form of Non
Return to Zero (NRZ), or Return to Zero (RZ). In this paper,
NRZ-OOK signaling is used because of lower power
requirements.
As mentioned, in PPM the position of the pulse is
changed during a temporal cycle to represent a different bit.
In
this
method
the
average
power
requirements
are
decreased compared to OOK, in compensation for an
increase in bandwidth requirements. PPM can be either in
two, or multi-level, depending on the requirement, where it
is represented by L-PPM.
The
proposed
design
has
considered
NRZ-OOK
modulation
techniques
because
of
the
simplicity
of
implementation and lower power requirement.
C.
Proposed Network architecture
Two possible network architectures for underwater
communication are presented in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Underwater optical wireless network architecture
In the first scenario, a star network topology is
presented, where sensor nodes send information via an
optical link to a gateway station which can be located on the
surface or under the water. The underwater gateway station
stores information from all nodes in the cluster and sends it

to
the
surface
station
periodically.
Another
scenerio
presented on the right hand side of the above figure is based
on a tree topology, where each node relays the information
to the next node, and the surface station receives all node
information via its nearest sensor nodes. Both these
architectures have some advantages and limitations, for
example, in the first case protocol development will be
easier since the total communicaton system is based on one
hop
communication,
and
it
will
have
lower
power
consumption because, after passing the data to gateway
nodes, each node can go to the sleep state. This type of
architecture has limitations in terms of distance covered. On
the other hand, a tree-based multi-hop architecture has the
advantage of covering a large geographical area. Multi-hop
comunication needs a complex routing protocol, since each
node needs to know its neighbour to forward information,
especially in the mobile environment. Since the focus of this
work is to build a static and directional sensor network, this
problem can be easily solved by using hop-by-hop routing.
D.
Physical layer development
The possible physical layer architectures of the network
are shown in Figure 2. As seen, it can be implemented in
different ways. First of all, a simplex communication is
possible where each sensor node just forwards sensor
information through the optical wireless link to the gateway
station. In this case, the gateway node gives a command to
the sensor node by using another medium, for example, in
an acoustic link. So, this is not fully optical communication,
but rather a hybrid communications approach. Having both
optical and acoustic hardware increases the overall system
complexity, especially when the cost of suitable higher
bandwidth acoustic modems is high.
Another approach is presented in figure 2 (b), where
both up- and downlinks are designed using the same colored
LED. In this approach, a half-duplex communication can be
achieved, which means a lower throughput for the system.
The implementation which is being described here
utilizes a full-duplex communication model using two
different colored LEDs. Compared to the half-duplex
system, it has greater bandwidth efficiency at almost the
same complexity. Only a pairing of a green and a blue
transceiver has to be done correctly to make the system
work properly.

wireless sensor network a) Simplex, b) Half-duplex, and c) Full duplex
IV.
SYSTEM DESIGN
Free space optical wireless communications is dominated
by infrared technology which cannot be used underwater.
As discussed in the previous section, the best wavelengths
suitable for underwater communication are in the green/blue
part
of the
spectrum,
so
whole
system
is
designed
accordingly.
A.
Components selection
An LED and a photodiode are the two main components
which need to be selected carefully for best performance.
After careful consideration, an Avago HLMP LED was
selected which is available both in green and in blue. The
power dissipation of this device is about 116 mW and the
viewing angle is 15 degrees.
A SILONEX SLD-70BG2 photodiode was chosen for the
receivers which has peak sensitivity in the green spectral
region. Compared to other silicon photodiodes available in
the visible spectrum range, it has less capacitance (180pF)
and higher active region (9.8 sq.mm).
B.
Transmitter circuit
To transmit a digital signal, a relatively simple digital
optical wireless transmitter circuit was used with the
selected LED as shown in Figure 3 to provide OOK signals.
Figure 3. Digital optical wireless transmitter
C.
Receiver circuit
The receiver can be the more complicated part of an
optical wireless system design. There are a few common
receiver design architectures which are mostly preferred by
researchers. Amongst them, the bootstrap front end and
transimpedance front end are frequently used. The target of
all
configurations
is
to
increase
the
bandwidth
and
sensitivity by minimizing the photodiode’s capacitance
effects. For the high bandwidth applications, the bootstrap
configuration is preferred, whereas for better gain, the
transimpedance configuration has advantages over the
bootstrap approach. After investigating both the receiver
techniques, a simple form of transimpedance front end
circuit using a single transistor, as shown in Figure 4, was
used for the proposed system.

Figure 4. Modified transimpedance receiver front end
The bandwidth of the transimpedance system can be
determined by the following equation,
Where, R = load resistance, CD = Device capacitance, Cbc =
transistor base emitter capacitance and A = open loop
amplifier gain.
As seen, the device capacitance is reduced in significance
considerably due to the high gain, A, of the amplifier, but
the base-collector capacitance effects cannot be similarly
minimized.
V.
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
Performance analysis of the designed receiver has been
done in terms of gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics.
To estimate the performance, all the experiments were
carried first in air and then through water to compare the
performance analysis.
A.
Gain of the transceiver in air
As seen in Figure 5, the received signal decreases
continuously
when
communication
distance
increases,
understandably, because of the weakening optical power
incident on the photodiode. Conversely, the greatest signal
is achieved when the transmitter and receiver are around 1
cm apart. Overall, when the distance between transmitter
and receiver is about 80 cm, the channel loss is about 48 dB.
In this project, the target communication range is about 60
cm, where corresponding loss is around 45 dB.
Figure 5. Link gain in different communication range
B.
Bit-rate of the transceiver
The achievable bit rate of the designed transceiver has
been estimated from Figure 6. With the digital transmitter,
finding the achievable bandwidth of the system was
undertaken using the maximum bit rate the system can
convey.

C.
Noise performacne in air
Finding signal to noise ratio experimentally in an optical
wireless system is challenging due to the effects of ambient
light in respect of shot noise in the detector, thermal noise in
the input resistances (especially the load resistor), and the
masking effect of the ambient itself. Here, the average peak-
peak value of the signal and noise was measured, and signal
to noise ratio was calculated from the following equation:

is defined as the peak to peak

is defined as

system has been estimated in three different scenarios: first
of all, the signal to noise ratio was measured in the ideal
situation where neither ambient light nor daylight was
present. The same measurement was done in the presence of
ambient light and in the night environment without any light
sources, to find the noise characteristics.
Figure 7. Signal output at the receiver with and without ambient light
Figure 7 shows the output waveform at the receiver
with and without ambient light during the day time. As seen,
the ambient light has a strong effect on the communication
system. The average ambient noise Pk-Pk to value was
measured at about 16 mV. A signal to noise ratio of 14 dB

was calculated without the ambient light, and 10 dB with
the ambient light.
D.
Comparison of air test with water testing
The picture of the water test setup is shown below,
Figure 8. Water test setup
Here, transmitter and receiver are placed on either side of
the tank and pointed to each other to measure the gain of the
receiver. The tank was made of glass and dimension of the
tank is 60cm x 30cm x 45cm. The tank was filled with 20
liters of distilled water and placed inside the experimental
laboratory.
To validate the air testing gain of the link has been
measured for air and through water for same distance. The
output waveform at the receiver can be found in the
following figure.
Figure 9. Comparison between output voltage at receiver (Left side through
air and Right side through water tank)
As seen, the received output signal voltage was about
40mV for air and about 60mV for water testing for the same
distance of 65cm and same frequency of 60 KHz. Because
of the glass water tank some light might reflected back from
the glass while propagating to the receiver which made for a
better gain during water testing. In reality, the gain in water
must be lower than the air as water is denser medium than
air.
E.
Discussion in context of available underwater system
Underwater systems developed by different research
groups have different objectives, and chosen components
accordingly. For example, Vasilescu et al. designed his
transmitter with high power LEDs to obtain maximum
distance [2]. The radiant power of used LED was 700mW
which is much higher compare to LED used for the
proposed solution (120mW). It is clear that more optical
power will ensure larger distance according to Beer’s law.
However, the objective of this solution is to design a cost
effective
system
to
prove
the
concept
of
multi-hop
underwater communication, so comparison in terms of
distance and bandwidth with other system may not justify
the achieved results. The same analogy is true for other
systems as well. Anguita et al. implemented a planar type
transmitter with 12 LEDs to achieve the communication
distance of 1.8m [8]. The proposed solution in this paper
also works in the 1m range without using any external
lenses, and can go beyond few meters if external lenses are
used. The same way, other underwater systems can be
discussed and compared with the proposed system.
VI.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
An underwater optical wireless communication link has
been presented for multi-hop underwater optical wireless
communication. Performance analysis of the multi-hop
communication system will be undertaken next. As the
communication system will be in the form of an amplify-
and-forward
system,
so
the
expected
multi-hop
communication performance will be relatively similar to a
single hop system, in terms of gain. Moreover, a directional
Medium Access Control (MAC) layer protocol is being
developed to support the built network for real applications.
