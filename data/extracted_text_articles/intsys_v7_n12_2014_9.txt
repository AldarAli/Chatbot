Abstract—Administrators of Wikipedia are its most dedicated
users, which are granted special privileges and burdened with
great responsibility for the Wikipedia. The administrators are
usually nominated by the community and then elected by voting
or by reaching a consensus. This paper examines period 2005 –
2011. In most recent years of examined period, decline in
a number of newly appointed administrators can be observed.
There are two main hypotheses of seen phenomena: with growth
of Wikipedia it is harder to become an administrator or existing
administrator community is shutting out new candidates due
to acquaintance relation. This research is an attempt to ﬁnd
out whether the community is not becoming less open to new
users and new potential administrators, because of their lack of
chances to gain reputation. The key here is the understanding
of social aspects driving the process of Request for Adminship
(RfA) votings. Based on our previous work focused on social
networks induced from collective activity of wikipedians, this
paper extends it by the annual analysis of obtained statistics
and examination of clustering coefﬁcient as an approximation of
social capital. We present the dynamics of relationships between
voters and candidates across several years of Polish Wikipedia
development. Obtained data allowed us to answer the question,
whether administrator community of Polish Wikipedia shuts out
new candidates because of the acquaintance relation.

INTRODUCTION
Spychała et al. [1] presented results of their research on
The Third International Conference on Advanced Collabora-
tive Networks, Systems and Applications (COLLA 2013 [2])
in Nice, France. Presented research concerned possibility of
closing up the Administrator Community of Polish Wikipedia
by shutting out new candidates. It was a reﬁnement of work
done by Turek et al. [3]. This paper is an extended version
of paper written by Spychała et al. [1] and presented on
COLLA 2013. Similarly to paper written by Spychała et al. [1],
this paper covers the range of years 2005-2011 and its goal is
to answer the question if the reason for decrease in successful
RfA votings in Polish Wikipedia is choosing Administrators
based on acquaintance. As the administrator community of
Polish Wikipedia is rather small, especially compared to the
English one, it could be valid claim. But, we argue that it is not
the case. Probably, it is caused by growing expectations about
new candidates. As the Polish Wikipedia grows, the number
of articles also grows. Articles are getting longer and more
complex. Users gain more experience and have richer edits
history. This paper contains some data and conclusions, which
Spychała et al. [1] were unable to present due to limitations
placed on length of the conference publication.
Administrators (or sysops) are very dedicated and trust-
worthy participants of the Wikipedia projects in all language
versions. Thanks to community decision, they have received
special privileges and use administrative tools to exercise
preventive and policing functions. Administrators have the
right to edit all the Wikipedia articles as well as many other
privileges—understood rather as duties. These powers are not
meant to give them editorial control over the project, but
rather provide mentoring and technical assistance in other
wikipedians’ work. Administrators also serve by providing
assistance, especially to newcomers, in editing of Wikipedia.
All newly registered users get their guides—the administrators
to whom they can always turn for help and be sure they will
receive it as soon as possible.
Kittur et al. [4] claimed, that due to increasing amount
of management work at Wikipedia, such as content quality
control, coordination, maintenance, that are caused by the
increasing popularity and amount of content in Wikipedia,
the importance of administrators is increasing. This creates a
potential risk that administrators may become overwhelmed
by the amount of work and their response times become
longer. Especially, Ortega et al. [5] showed that after peak
of popularity of the Free Encyclopaedia, its user base growth
slowed down. But in the same time, the amount of content is
still increasing. If the Wikipedia is to keep its pace of growth,
then some measures to increase its users base have to be taken.
However, the Polish community of Administrators is grow-
ing slower than expected; hence, the question whether and
why this community shuts out candidates for new members.
Currently, there are 149 administrators on Polish Wikipedia—
for comparison, 1,147 administrators work currently on the
English version. Of course, the English version is much more
developed, but sheer number of people with administrative
privileges is impressive. On the other hand, Ortega et al. [5]
notes that the Polish Wikipedia has the highest rate of auto-

mated bots used to help administrators in their duties. This fact
can explain why the number of administrators is not enough
to prophesize doom of Polish Wikipedia.
Administrators are elected in a special procedure, the rules
of which are clearly deﬁned. This procedure is called Request
for Adminship (RfA). As it was already mentioned, the privi-
leges for administrators are granted by Wikipedia community,
in a vote in which the right to vote is given to those Wikipedia
users, who are well-known and respected members of the
community and know and respect the established rules on the
website. Wikipedians who are candidates for the administrator
position must “have a minimum of 1,000 not deleted edits,
ﬁrst of which has to be made at least 3 months prior to the
date of ﬁling the candidacy”. Nominations for administrator
candidates are adopted by a special form on the web page
that also contains the regulations and the list of candidates.
New administrators are elected during a voting that lasts a
week (168 hours). Wikipedians, in order to be allowed to vote,
must have been registered for at least one month and have a
minimum of 500 not deleted edits.
Interestingly, in case of English version of Wikipedia, no
formal conditions are required in order to declare a candidacy
for an administrator. The only conditions are possession of
an account and trust among other users. Despite this, the page
with the declaration forms contains the information that in case
of self-nominating, it is recommended to have at least 2,000
edits for a minimum period of 3 months. Another important
difference is that in the case of English version of Wikipedia,
new administrators are elected not by voting, but by discussion.
Moreover, “the consensus in RFA is not achieved by exceeding
a threshold, but by the strength of the justiﬁcation of the
candidacy”.
There is one aspect of this paper which distinguishes
it from work presented by Spychała et al. [1], namely our
analysis of lifespans of administrators. It allowed us to make
sure that research, which is main topic of this paper, is well
founded. What is more, analysis of lifespans of administrators
allowed us to show analogy between our work and part of Or-
tega’s work [5]. Moreover, one can clearly see correspondence
between behavioural patterns exhibited by administrators and
those exhibited by the core of most active users. Analysing
sub-communities of user community of Wikipedia is challeng-
ing and interesting research direction, which we plan to take
in our future research.
The rest of this work is divided as follows: in Section II, the
related work is presented. Section III contains data motivating
our research and base statistics, which show that growth of
Polish-language Wikipedia Administrators group has slowed
down. Data presented there is extended by data for year 2011,
in comparison to data gathered by Jankowski-Lorek et al. [6].
In Section IV, Multidimensional Behavioural Social Network
is used to analyse historical voting data. This analysis is the
main contribution of this paper. Section IV also contains an-
swer to question stated above. Section V presents conclusions
and suggestions for future work.
II.
RELATED WORK
The problem of evaluation and recommendation of users
requesting for adminship in Wikipedia has been addressed in
several papers. In one of them, Burke et al. [7] try to indicate
the features and qualities determinative for the user selection to
the position of administrator. On the basis of publicly available
tips for candidates [8], a set of attributes, that a future admin-
istrator should have has been developed. Behavioural data and
comments, not page text, were used to evaluate candidates.
Authors counted each candidate’s edits in various namespaces
(article, article talk, Wikipedia, Wikipedia talk, wiki projects,
etc.) to calculate total contribution as well as contribution
diversity. They also measured user interaction, mainly activity
on talk pages, but also participation on arbitration or mediation
committee pages and a few others. There are also several
other statistics, but the ones mentioned seemed to be the most
relevant to the candidate’s success. Especially successful were
candidates with strong edit diversity, mere edits in Wikipedia
articles did not add much more chance of success. In user
interactions, article talk page edits were the best predictor
of success, with other authors talk page edits being rather
poor. Burke et al. also conﬁrmed Kittur’s [9] results that the
percentage of indirect work (coordination, discussion, etc.)
grows over time, the share of articles in all Wikipedia edits
is decreasing.
It is noteworthy that in Burke et al. [7] only the qualities
of each user were evaluated. Leskovec et al. [10] have shown
that the outcome of the voting depends on the candidate and
his or her place in the community. They found out that the
probability of one person’s vote to be positive is correlated
with the basic relative ﬁgures such as: who—voter or candidate
has more edits, who has more barnstars (awards given by
other Wikipedia users), the extent of collaboration of the two,
etc. Authors strongly noted that the vote value (positive or
negative) is not just a function of candidate, but both voter
and candidate.
Kittur et al. [11], analysed the impact of the similarity of
users on their mutual assessment. The examined data were
collected from three websites: Wikipedia, Stack Overﬂow,
and Epinions. The important feature of those websites is the
possibility of mutual evaluation between their users. In case
of Wikipedia it is the RfA voting. Two users were considered
similar, when they have performed similar actions, which in
case of Wikipedia were edits of articles. The authors concluded
that, in case of Wikipedia, the possibility of casting a vote for a
candidate increases with the increase of the similarity between
the candidate and the voter. The voters, who are similar to
the candidate, are less driven by the objective qualities (status
in the community), such as experience in development of
Wikipedia. Candidate’s status determines casting a vote for
that candidate when the voter and candidate are only slightly
similar.
An interesting observation is that during the voting, there
are much more voters similar to the candidate in a group
with higher status than in a group with relatively lower status.
This may suggest that during RfA the voters do not constitute
a representative sample of community. This allows for the
outcome of the election to be predicted when proﬁles and
similarity of a few ﬁrst voters and the candidate are known. To
effectively predict the result of the voting one does not even
need to know the votes given by the ﬁrst voters.
The quality of Wikipedia articles depends on the level of
cooperation of the editors. Rad et al. [12] decided to examine

105

the history of article edits, and on that basis determine the
mutual attitude of the editors and how controversial is the
given article. Casting a vote during new administrator election
was adopted as an indicator of relation between two users.
If the voter has a positive attitude toward the candidate, the
vote will be positive. In case of a negative attitude, the vote
will be negative. The authors decided that the co-edit of the
article is a pair of changes of the same section of the article,
which were set apart in time by less than a ﬁxed number of
revisions. A social network with nodes labelled with users’
proﬁles and directed edges labelled with users’ co-edits, was
also considered. This graph was used to induce a decision
system and train a classiﬁer, which was highly effective in
predicting votes. What is important, is that this approach is
complementary to the ones described earlier. It is based on the
analysis of Wikipedia articles and their edit history and not on
the aggregated statistics of the community. What is interesting,
it turned out that it is relatively easy to predict positive votes.
It seems that they are inﬂuenced by the most recent history of
cooperation. On the other hand, the high quality of prediction
of the negative votes required appropriately bigger and richer
history of cooperation. The authors risked the statement that
the users can remember disagreements for a long time and
during a voting they can be guided by hidden qualities, like
for example, the votes already cast in a given voting.

STATISTICS FOR REQUEST FOR ADMINSHIP
PROCEDURE
During the period 2005 – 2011, the growth of Polish
Wikipedia’s content was steady. It can be seen on Figure 1,
which presents an average number of new articles per day
during examined period. Data for Figure 1 were obtained from
freely available web-page presenting some statistics for the
Polish Wikipedia [13]. On Figure 1, one can clearly see, that in
the year 2006, there was a peak in pace of content growth, but
in the following years the growth speed declined and steadied.

The average number of edits per article in each year
In the same period, articles’ content was getting more
complicated. Because of that, there was increasing amount
of management work, such as content quality control and
maintenance. The increased articles’ complexity can be ap-
proximated by an average number of edits per article. Values
for averages for each year in examined period are presented
on Figure 2. Data for Figure 2 were also obtained from
above-mentioned web-page presenting some statistics for the
Polish Wikipedia
[13]. The above-mentioned ﬁgure shows,
that the average number of edits per article was rapidly
increasing during examined period. It indicates that amount
of management work also increased, and leads to need for
growth of the Administrators Community.
As of December 31, 2011 the Polish-language Wikipedia
had 171 administrators. Since 2005, there were 307 votings
on RfA. 177 of those ended with granting the administrator
privileges to a candidate, in 110 of those, the candidates were
rejected and in about 40 votings, the candidates resigned before
the end of the voting and about 30 votings were cancelled
(due to statutory requirements or lack of acceptance of the
nomination by the candidate). About 38 administrators were
chosen before the introduction of RfA procedures in March
2005. The data on RfAs do not sum up for several reasons.
Among them are: veriﬁcation votings and losing privileges by
administrator either by giving them up or being revoked by
the Arbitration Committee.
In the current version, the procedure states that a candidate
for an administrator must have an account for at least three
months and at least one thousand not deleted edits. In order
to participate in the voting, user must have an account for at
least 2 weeks and at least 500 article edits. Voting begins at
the moment, when the candidates conﬁrm, that they are willing
to take the administrator position, as users can apply for the
position themselves or be nominated by other users. In order to
receive administrator privileges, the candidate need to receive
at least 20 votes “for” and it must constitute of at least 80% of
the sum of the votes “for” and “against”. If the candidate does
not receive the required number of positive votes or do not
meet the formal requirements, he or she can apply again after
at least 60 days since the end of last voting. A similar rule
applies to the administrators who resigned from their position
but would like to receive the privileges again.

Number of votings in each year
Figure 3 is presenting the number of votings in each year;
the peak can be observed in the year 2006, when that number
reaches 95, while a year before it reached only 34. One year
after the peak, the number of votings dropped to 60. With the
exception of the years 2006-2007, the number of votings never
exceeded 38. In the years 2010-2011 that number declined

The percentage of accepted RfA in each year
The percentage of the accepted nominations in each year
(see Figure 4) can be divided into three periods. The ﬁrst one
consists of the years 2005-2008, when the percentage of the
accepted candidates ranged from 57 to 70. The second period
are the years 2009-2010, with the percentage below 50 (47%
and 42% respectively). Between the years 2008 and 2010 the
percentage of the positive RfAs fell by almost a half (from
70% to 42%). The third period, which accounts for the year
2011, is characterized by the relatively high number of positive
RfAs. However, it should be noted that the number of the
votings performed at that time was signiﬁcantly lower than in
the previous years.

of elected administrators dropped to 38. In the following years,
number of elected administrators steadily went down to 11 in
the year 2010 and 13 in the year 2011. With the exception
of the year 2006 and the year 2007, the number of elected
administrators never exceeded 30. In the most recent years,
that number declined below 20.

The growth of the Administrator community in each year
The number of administrators who were relieved from duty
is presented on Figure 6. There is steady upward trend in
number of former administrators. The value in the year 2011
is equal to 22, which is probably a little too big. The errors are
possible because our parsers for the Wikipedia’s pages [14],
[15] were not accurate enough. But the key fact is illustrated on
Figure 7, which presents growth of number of Administrators
of the Polish Wikipedia. The graph is an approximation of the
real growth, because some face were not considered in data
used to build it. One issue was with administrators who gave
up their duties and were later re-elected. Since an administrator
can leave the project and then come back again, in our analysis
we used only the date of his ﬁrst election to this function
and the date of his last departure from the project. If some
administrator has departed from the project and then was later
re-elected, then his case lowered our approximation of growth
of the Administrator Community of Polish Wikipedia by one.
Fortunately, set of re-elected administrators has low cardinality.
Because of that, our approximation although not accurate, can
show overall trend. And it can be clearly seen, that after
the peek of popularity of Polish Wikipedia in the year 2006,
the above-mentioned trend in the growth of the Administrator
Community of Polish Wikipedia is downward.
The next study, related to the experience of candidates prior
to granting them administrator privileges, has been conducted
on 97 users, who recently received them. In case of those
elected before, the gathering of data was impossible because
of gaps in the logs of Polish Wikipedia.

The average number of edits made by user at the moment of receiving
administrative privileges
One of the factors causing the most discussion during the
voting is the number of edits performed by the candidate.
RfA rules contain the following sentence: “Users who want
to candidate for adminship (...) must have at least 1000 not
deleted edits”. Often, however, this number is considered by
the voters to be too small. Basing on the analysis of the number
of edits, it can be seen (Figure 8) that the minimum falls on

107

the ﬁrst half of 2006 with an average of 1,957 edits. This value
then grows up to 2011 when it slightly exceeds 20,000 edits.
This indicates that year by year, candidates needed to have
greater experience in order to be accepted as administrators.
The difference between the level of experience required by the
regulations and the level widely accepted has been increasing
as well. A similar phenomenon can be observed in the German
Wikipedia, where—according to the voters—in the second half
of 2010, candidates were accepted only if they had over 10,000
edits.

The average number of days since creation of the account at the
moment of receiving administrative privileges
Another factor that stirs up emotions at the time of voting
is the seniority (understood as time since the ﬁrst not deleted
edit) on Wikipedia. The terms of voting set the following
requirements: “Users who want to candidate for adminship
(...) must have at least 1000 not deleted edits, the ﬁrst of
which took place at least 3 months before the date of candidacy
proposition”. The seniority (in days) of candidates, before the
date of registration and acquiring the administrator rights, had
been analysed (see Figure 9). This, however, is not exactly the
same value as the required by the regulations. The measured
seniority in the ﬁrst half of the year 2006 was 173 days. This
value has been gradually increasing: from 463 days in the
second half of 2007, to 788 days in the ﬁrst half of 2009, with
a slight decline in the second half of 2009 (739 days). In the
second half of 2010 the value reached 1310 days. This result,
however, may be unreliable due to the fact that during that
period only two votings took place. In the second half of 2011
the measured value reached 1374 days. The overall analysis of
the chart shows that in the year 2006 candidates had less than
a year of seniority, however, since mid-2008 the seniority is
at least two years. The last two candidates who had less than
one year of experience were selected in February 2009 and
November 2008.
All three ﬁgures (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5) show
the downward trend in the total number of newly appointed
administrators between 2006 and 2011. This decrease gives
reason for serious concern as the amount of required ad-
ministrative work on Wikipedia is constantly growing. This
phenomenon may have several possible explanations. The ﬁrst
explanation is the declining number of candidates who accept
their nominations for administrators (that would explain the
decreasing number of RfA votings), but the conﬁrmation of
this hypothesis is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless,
related works have shown that in recent years Wikipedia has
experienced a downtrend in the amount of user contributions,
which reﬂects the general decline in motivation as shown by
Suh et al. [16].
The second explanation states that the number of positive
nominations decreases due to the changing criteria for selecting
and accepting candidates. Those criteria can vary in many
ways; however, our research shows that they are connected
to the candidate’s experience. This experience can be initially
estimated on the basis of the edits performed, but the more ac-
curate measurement (presented by Burke et al. [7]) represents
the number of article edits in a speciﬁc category.
The more damaging prospect is the fact that the adminis-
trator community is chosen on the basis acquaintance between
current administrators and candidates. The next section dis-
cusses, if that is the case.
IV.
ACQUAINTANCE IN THE ADMINISTRATORS SOCIETY
Acquaintance is a social phenomenon, which can lead to
shutting out new members of some society. To approximate
it, we used implicit social connections contained in history of
talk pages in Wikipedia. We claim, that connections obtained
in above-mentioned way, are indeed good approximation of
acquaintance relation. Jankowski-Lorek et al. [6] proven men-
tioned claim to be true.
A. Data description
Data and multidimensional behavioural social network used
for this paper were gathered, aggregated and made available by
the team led by dr. Adam Wierzbicki. Methodology, data and
networks are described in greater detail by Jankowski-Lorek
et al. [6]. Examined period encompasses the years 2005-2011.
Basically, the network consists of four dimensions:
•
Co-edits,
•
Reverts,
•
Discussion,
•
Topics.
Weights in co-edits dimension are based on number of
words written by one author next to the text written by some
other one in the text of articles. The authorship information
for a particular fragment of text was obtained by analysing its
ﬁrst occurrence in the whole edit history of examined page.
Edge strength in reverts dimension is based on the number
of edits made by one author and reverted by other. It was
obtained by searching identical revisions before the examined
one. If it was found, each pair of examined revision and
revisions after the other identical one was used to calculate
number of reverts.
Similar to co-edits, edge strengths in discussion network
were stated as number of words written by one author next to
text created by other one. But in this dimension, the talk pages
were considered.
The last dimension, topics, was a little different to other
ones. It was a bipartite graph connecting authors with cate-
gories in which they have edited at least one article. The edge
weight was exactly the number of article edits made by given
author in the particular category.
One
of
the
most
important
observations
made
by
Jankowski-Lorek et al. [6], is that discussion network can be

interpreted as social relation of acquaintance. Jankowski-Lorek
et al. [6] conducted another research, a survey among Polish
Wikipedia users. However, interpretations of other dimensions
have not been conﬁrmed.
The data contained two more graphs: positive votes net-
work and negative ones. If, during RfA procedure, user has
cast positive vote for candidate, then an edge in the positive
votes network has been created. Its weight was equal to number
of positive votes cast by the user for the candidate. Weights of
more than one were possible only if the user was a candidate
more than once. Network of negative votes has been created
in an analogous manner, but taking the negative votes instead.
Turek et al. [3] and Jankowski-Lorek et al. [6], intersected
each dimension with positive and negative votes networks, in
order to examine correlation between social network dimen-
sions and RfA votings. Both graphs were analysed separately
and features distinguishing them have been found.
Research presented in this paper studies only on the
discussion dimension. The reason for such decision is that
discussion network can be interpreted as a real relation—
acquaintance. For each year, graph of discussion network has
been intersected with positive and negative votes networks.
Maniu et al. [17] suggest using one, signed network, especially,
when there is a strong correlation between both networks as
shown by Leskovec et al. [18]. Two separate graphs were used
for two reasons:
•
To maintain consistency with analysis presented by
Turek et al. [3] and Jankowski-Lorek et al. [6],
•
To separately check positive and negative impact on
RfA procedure of acquaintance relation.
Ortega et al. [5], deﬁned the core of the Wikipedia user
community as a group of most active editors in analysed
month. Most of the Wikipedia content is created by the group
of core users. The core existed in all examined language
versions of the Wikipedia, in particular in Polish and English
versions, but the behavioural patterns of users were different
in both language versions. The ﬁrst indication of that fact
are the differences in the structures of core user groups of
both Wikipedias. To name just one, in the English version
new Administrator is elected by reaching consensus among
the users fulﬁlling a set of requirements, while in the Polish
version – by ”formal” voting within similar group. Ortega
notes, that structure of the core user group of Polish Wikipedia
is different than structures of similar groups of other top ten
Wikipedias.
The other difference between social behaviour in case of
users of the Polish Wikipedia and the English one is what we
could call the survival patterns of the core users. Although
in all top ten Wikipedias users entered to the core relatively
quick – after less than a half year, the stability of a core
group’s composition was quite different. In case of the English
Wikipedia, users forming the core often left it after a month.
In case of the Polish version of the free encyclopaedia, users
stayed in the core for three months. But in both cases there
exists part of the core formed by users who stay there for
years.
There is also a difference between commitment level of
authors after leaving the core group. Users of the English

version of the Wikipedia often leave the project, after leaving
the core group. In case of the Polish version, this is not the
case. Polish users show strong commitment to the project.
After leaving the core, for long period they often revise articles
and sometimes come back to the core.
One can argue, that the rotation of Administrators is high
enough to prevent from forming closed groups based on
acquaintance. But to decide if such claim is well founded,
it is necessary to describe the commitment part of behavioural
patterns in case of the Administrators of the Wikipedia. The
intuition is that, the Administrators are a group of some of the
most active users of the Wikipedia and will show behavioural
patterns similar to members of the core users group. But the
question is whether it will be more similar to the English core
group or to the Polish.
In order to answer above-mentioned question, we analysed
list of Administrators of the English Wikipedia [19] and list
of Administrators of the Polish Wikipedia [14], [15] and gath-
ered statistics for lifespans of Administrators for mentioned
Wikipedias. In our research, lifespan of administrator is the
length of period, in which user has been granted administrator
privileges. If user resigned and was later appointed for being
administrator one more time, then his lifespan is period from
ﬁrst election to the last resignation.
For each Wikipedia, we selected three sets of Adminis-
trators: all active Administrators, all former Administrators
and a combined set of all Administrators (active and former
ones). Within each set we calculated lifespans of its members.
For obtained lifespans we calculated: minimum, maximum,
average and median. Lifespans and statistics relate to events
up to the end of the year 2011. Lifespans of Administrators,
who were active after the year 2011, were calculated to the
1st of January 2012. As the unit of lifespan we have chosen
one month. In case if there were some remaining days, lifespan
was rounded to the nearest month. It is worth noting, that
in all cases average lifespan and median are almost equal to
each other. Because of that, we will analyse average lifespans
keeping in mind, that our conclusions are also backed up by
medians.
Statistics of lifespans of Administrators of the English
Wikipedia are presented in Table I. It is worth noting, that
there is large difference between lifespans of active and former
Administrators. Active Administrators are active for at least
2 years. They remain active for about six years on average.
The maximum length of practice in the case of an active
Administrator is ten years. On the other hand, most former
Administrators are active for about a year on average. Former
Administrator with the longest service was on duty for more
than three years. Because of such short average lifespan of
former Administrators, one could not infer about possibility
of forming strong groups based on acquaintance. The other
fact, which is noteworthy, is that the group of Administrators

of the English Wikipedia yields similar behavioural patterns
to the its core.
In Table II statistics for time of seniority in months after
being freed from administrators duty for English Wikipedia
are presented. Data for Table II was obtained from [20]. There
are some cases when administrator lost his privileges and
left the project. But on average, after quitting administrators
group, users tend to support the free encyclopaedia. And it is
substantial support as a median of time spent in project after
quitting administrator role is about four years. It is noteworthy
difference from the core users described by Ortega et al. [5]
and should receive more attention in future studies.
Table III presents statistics for lifespans Administrators
of Polish Wikipedia. The ﬁrst thing to note is, that in case
of the Polish Wikipedia maximum and average lifespans are
quite similar for active and former Administrators. The longest
service of active Administrator is more than six years. And
it is also length of the longest service of former one. Both,
active and former Administrators will be on duty for three
to four years on average. Is is a period which length is
comparable to length of the whole examined period (years
2005–2006). This, in contrast to the English Wikipedia, leads
to concern if there is possibility that some kind of ”elite” in the
Administrator community of the Polish Wikipedia is forming.
Another fact is that, the Administrator community of the Polish
Wikipedia shows similar behavioural patterns to the core of
Polish Wikipedia and is quite different from the Administrators
community of the English Wikipedia. Unfortunately, due to
the time constraints, we were unable to ensemble table with
statistics for time of seniority in months after being freed from
administrators duty for Polish Wikipedia. It is our priority
to gather data and compare it to corresponding data for the
English version.
B. Base statistics
In order to compare graphs resulting from intersecting the
discussion dimension graph and votes nets for each year, base
statistics were obtained for edges’ weights. The used measures
were: minimum, maximum, arithmetic mean, median, ﬁrst and
third quartile.
For each graph, i.e., discussion network, discussion inter-
sected with positive and discussion intersected with negative
votes in each year, empirical distribution functions were cal-
culated. Distribution graphs for examined years are presented
in Figure 10 and Figure 11. Values of x-axis are logarithms

of edge strengths. Since 2007, the distribution of data is
analogous to that described in the article. Both arithmetic mean
and median are signiﬁcantly higher for positive votes. As a
result, it can be concluded that the Wikipedia user community
is developing steadily.
The stability of the development of the Wikipedia adminis-
trator community is also reﬂected by the empirical cumulative
distribution charts. The shapes of the curves are similar, so it
can be concluded that the probability distributions describing
different parts of the Wikipedia user community originate in
the same distribution family. This means that the behaviour
of the voters is not subject to sudden changes, but at most it
undergoes a calm evolution.
C. Clustering coefﬁcients
Clustering coefﬁcient is a measure of degree to which
nodes in a graph tend to be clustered together. The global
version, which is used in this article, was designed to give an

overall indication of the clustering in the network. Basically,
for undirected graphs, it is a ratio between number of closed
triplets (three nodes connected by two links) to number of all
triplets (three nodes connected by either two or three links).
For directed, weighted graphs a generalization was pro-
posed, it is described in detail Opsahl et al. [21]. Opsahl et
al. proposed four measures to calculate triplet value:
•
Minimum of edges’ weights (mi),
•
Maximum of edges’ weights (ma),
•
Arithmetic mean of edges’ weights (am), and
•
Geometric mean of edges’ weights (gm).
The intuition is as follows: the minimum version is used
to ﬁnd the weakest group in graph, the maximum to ﬁnd the
strongest. Both means give an indication of the strength of
ordinary clusters. Opsahl et al. [21], [22] also created tnet
library [23] for R software [24].
For each year from 2005 to 2011, the clustering coefﬁcients
were obtained for intersections of acquaintance networks with
graphs of positive and negative votes. Those coefﬁcients are
presented in Figure 12. There are four values (calculated for
each of the measures mentioned before) for both graphs.
A few facts can be observed. The ﬁrst is that there are
no very weak or strong groups in Polish Wikipedia society.
There is no “elite”, which governs RfA procedure or has taken
over the administrator society and has power to rule Polish
Wikipedia.
The second fact is that clustering coefﬁcients are relatively
low and their growth rate is low and negligible. We argue,
that decrease in successful administrator elections is not a
result of a building up acquaintance relation. Voters do not
cast positive votes for their acquaintances or cast negative
votes for strangers. The anomaly in year 2005, that clustering
coefﬁcients have abnormal values, is most likely caused by the
fact, that data for year 2005 were not complete.
V.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presented the analysis of the development
dynamics of the community of administrators of Polish
Wikipedia. We have used multidimensional behavioural social
networks as a tool to model relationships between wikipedians.
The aforementioned analysis included examination of the
community in each year from 2005 to 2011 as well as the
analysis of the social network corresponding to the ﬁnal state
of the community. The analysis was based on the data from
public Wikipedia data dumps.
The fundamental question which we sought the answer to
was: “Is the administrator community of the Polish Wikipedia
closing up?” It turns out that the answer is not straightforward
and it depends on what aspects of the problem one put the
greater emphasis, or how to deﬁne the “closing up” society.
The conducted analysis of the social network allows us
to draw conclusions about the impact of the social system
on the nominations of the new administrators. The results of
this analysis clearly show that this phenomenon does not exist
in the Polish Wikipedia. This is one of the arguments for
the statement that the community of the administrators is not
shutting out candidates. The administrator community is open
to new members in the same way as it was in the beginning
of the Polish-language Wikipedia.

However, the pace of growth of the administrator commu-
nity is lower than it could be expected in case of a young and
dynamically growing society. In the early years of development
the number of votings was much higher than in the recent years
and the number of new administrator appointments strongly
declined. That could indicate, however, that the community is
closing up after all.
Slower pace of growth and acceptance of new members can
be caused by various factors. One such factor may be higher
entrance requirements for candidates. Both administrators and
regular editors of Wikipedia continue to develop and gain
experience in new areas. At the same time, the history of
their activity is freely available. For that reason, new users
may have trouble with showing equally high achievements
and contribution to Wikipedia development. This can be inter-
preted as closing up of the community by making prohibitive
requirements for the new candidates, or as a kind of profes-
sionalization aiming to increase the substantive level of the
Polish Wikipedia.
It is also possible, that potential candidates do not request
for administrator’s privileges or withdraw their own candida-
ture from voting because they assess their achievements and
contribution to Wikipedia development as not high enough to
succeed as an administrator. That would lead to decreasing
number of new candidates and appointed new administrators.
In our opinion, such case is extremely hard to distinguish from
other ones. The best thing to do for the Wikimedia foundation
is to do social campaign among users of Wikipedia promoting
administrator’s duties and boosting conﬁdence in users. This
could lead to weakening self censure among candidates.
Our conclusion is that it cannot be claimed with certainty
that the Polish Wikipedia community is shuttig off new can-
didates for administrators. We believe that the increase in the
requirements of the current administrator community and users
entitled to speak during RfA process toward administrator can-
didates stems from the community’s desire to raise the quality
and ensure maximum involvement of all the administrators in
the development of Wikipedia.
Our research leads to another interesting conclusion. In
Section IV, we have shown the statistics concerning lifespans
of the Administrators of the Polish Wikipedia and the English
one. Conclusions about the Administrator communities, which
can be drawn from above-mentioned statistics, are coherent
with ones presented by Ortega et al. [5] about core users of
Wikipedias. Namely, users of the Polish Wikipedia will support
the free encyclopaedia longer than their English counterparts. It
is promising research direction to check if sub-communities of
Wikipedias’ communities are in some sense fractal. To check,
if all sub-groups of users share similar behavioural patterns
determined by language version of the project.
The results presented in this study describe the community
of Polish Wikipedia administrators only partially. Further re-
search should focus on the detection of new relations between
the users and social networks associated with them. It is
important to ﬁnd methods that will allow the development
of community to be automatically analysed on the basis of
widely available data. The multidimensional behavioural social
networks seem to be an ideal tool for this purpose. Richer
description of the community could help predict the direction
of its development, which may result in the early identiﬁcation
of threats. This will give the opportunity to counteract those
threats and ensure the correct development of Wikipedia.
User community of Polish Wikipedia—in contrast to other
language versions—is relatively little known and researched,
although, it is an ideal subject for researchers dealing with
social informatics. It can be an interesting subject for two types
of research: new research, previously not conducted on such
a social group, and repeated research, taken from a different
version of Wikipedia and performed on the Polish version
in order to compare the results and draw conclusions on the
development of the latter in comparison to other versions.
Tools used to create multidimensional behavioural social
networks for Polish Wikipedia were unable to create such
graph for larger instances, e.g., English one. In order to
conduct comparative research, scalability problems should
be addressed. There is also possibility, that more scalable
algorithms can be made on-line. This can allow development
of on-line recommendation algorithm for RfA votings.
