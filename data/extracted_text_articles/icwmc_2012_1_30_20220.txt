Abstract—In this paper, the blind frequency offset estimation
schemes robust to the non-Gaussian noise for orthogonal fre-
quency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems are addressed.
Based on the cyclic preﬁx structure and a maximum-likelihood
(ML) estimation, the estimation schemes in non-Gaussian noise
are proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed blind
estimation schemes offer a robustness and a substantial per-
formance improvement over the conventional blind estimation
scheme in non-gaussian noise environments.

I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has
been adopted as a physical layer implementation in a wide
variety of wireless systems such as long term evolution
(LTE), wireless local area network (WLAN), and worldwide
interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) due to its
immunity to multipath fading and high spectral efﬁciency
[1]-[3]. However, OFDM is very sensitive to the frequency
offset (FO) caused by Doppler shift or oscillator instabilities
[1], [4]. In this paper, we focus on FO estimation based on
the blind approach, which does not require an additional
training symbol [4].
Assuming that the ambient noise is a Gaussian process, in
[5], an optimal FO estimation scheme was proposed using
the cyclic preﬁx (CP) of OFDM symbols without requiring
the training symbol. However, it has been observed that the
ambient noise often exhibits non-Gaussian nature in wireless
channels, mostly due to the impulsive nature originated from
various sources such as car ignitions, narrowband interfer-
ences, moving obstacles, and reﬂections from sea waves [6],
[7]. The conventional estimation scheme developed assum-
ing the Gaussian noise could suffer from severe performance
degradation under the non-Gaussian noise environments.
In this paper, we propose robust blind FO estimation
schemes in non-Gaussian noise environments. Using the
CP structure of OFDM, we ﬁrst derive a blind maximum-
likelihood (ML) FO estimation scheme in non-gaussian
noise modeled as a complex isotropic Cauchy noise, and
then, propose a simpler blind estimation scheme reducing
the size of the candidate set. From simulation results, the
proposed schemes are conﬁrmed to offer a substantial per-
formance improvement over conventional blind estimation
scheme in non-Gaussian noise environments.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II introduces the signal and noise model. In Section III,
the novel blind FO estimation schemes are proposed, and
then, in Section IV the simulation results are demonstrated.
Section V concludes this paper.
II. SIGNAL MODEL
The kth received OFDM sample r(k) can be expressed
as
r(k) = x(k)ej2πkε/N + n(k)
(1)
for k = −G, · · · , −1, 0, 1, · · · , N − 1, where x(k) is the
kth sample of the transmitted OFDM symbol generated by
the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) of size N, G is
the size of the CP, ε is the FO normalized to the subcarrier
spacing 1/N, and n(k) is the kth sample of additive noise.
In this paper, we adopt the complex isotropic symmetric α
stable (CISαS) model for the noise samples {n(k)}N−1
k=0 and
assume that they are independent and identically distributed;
this model has been widely employed due to its strong
agreement with experimental data [8], [9]. For example, the
interference due to the multiple access is often modeled
as the SαS noise [10], [11] as well as the ambient noise
in the shallow water channel of underwater communication
systems [12]. The probability density function (pdf) of n(k)
is then given by [8]
fn(ρ) =
1
4π2
∫ ∞
−∞
∫ ∞
−∞
e−γ(u2+v2)
α
2 −jℜ{ρ(u−jv)}dudv,
(2)
where ℜ{·} denotes the real part, the dispersion γ > 0
is related to the spread of the pdf, and the characteristic
exponent α ∈ (0, 2] is related to the heaviness of the tails of
the pdf: A smaller value of α indicates a higher degree of
impulsiveness, whereas a value closer to 2 indicates a more
Gaussian behavior.

A closed-form expression of (2) does not exist except for
the special cases of α = 1 (complex isotropic Cauchy) and
α = 2 (complex isotropic Gaussian). For complex isotropic
Cauchy and Gaussian cases, (2) can be re-written in the
closed form as
fn(ρ) =



γ
2π
(
|ρ|2 + γ2)− 3
2 ,
when α = 1

4πγ exp
(
− |ρ|2
4γ
)
,
when α = 2.
(3)
In this paper, we concentrate on the case of α = 1, since it
is known that the receiver which performs well in Cauchy
noise also works well in other cases of SαS noise [11]. We
shall see in Section IV that the estimation schemes obtained
for α = 1 are not only more robust to the variation of α,
but they also provide a better performance for most values
of α, than the conventional estimation scheme.
III. PROPOSED SCHEMES
A. Maximum-likelihood Blind Estimation Scheme
In estimating the FO, we consider a property of the
CP structure of OFDM, i.e., x(k) = x(k + N) for k =
−G, −G + 1 · · · , −1 as in [5]. Then, from (1), we have
r(k + N) − r(k)ej2πε = n(k + N) − n(k)ej2πε
(4)
for k = −G, −G + 1 · · · , −1. Observing that n(k + N) −
n(k)ej2πε obeys the complex isotropic Cauchy distribution
with dispersion 2γ (since the distribution of −n(k)ej2πε is
the same as that of n(k)), we obtain the pdf
fr(r|ε) =
−1
∏
k=−G
γ
π
(
|r(k + N) − r(k)ej2πε|2 + 4γ2
) 3
2
(5)
of r = {r(k +N)−r(k)ej2πε}−1
k=−G conditioned on ε. The
ML estimation is then to choose ˆε such that
ˆε = arg max
˜ε [log fr(r|˜ε)]
= arg min
˜ε
Λ(˜ε),
(6)
where
˜ε
denotes
the
candidate
value
of
ε
and
the
log-likelihood
function
Λ(˜ε)
=
∑−1
k=−G log
{r(k + N) − r(k)ej2π˜ε2 + 4γ2}
is
a
periodic function of ˜ε with period 1: The minima of Λ(˜ε)
occur at a distance of 1 from each other, causing an
ambiguity in estimation. Assuming that ε is distributed
equally over positive and negative sides around zero, the
valid estimation range of the ML estimation scheme can be
set to −0.5 < ε ≤ 0.5, as in [5]. The estimation scheme
(6) will be called the Cauchy ML blind estimation (CMBE)
scheme.
B. Low-complexity Blind Estimation Scheme
The CMBE scheme is based on the exhaustive search
over the whole estimation range (|ε| < 0.5), which requires
high computational complexity. Thus, we propose a low-
complexity FO estimation scheme with the reduced set of
the candidate values.
In order to obtain the reduced set of the candidate values,
we exploit the fact that ε =
1
2π∠{x∗(k)x(k + N)} =
1
2π∠{r∗(k)r(k + N)} for k = −G, −G + 1 · · · , −1 in the
absence of noise. Based on this property, we obtain the set
of the candidate values
¯ε(k) = 1
2π ∠{r∗(k)r(k+N)}, for k = −G, −G+1 · · · , −1.
(7)
Exploiting the set of the candidate values in (7), the FO
estimate ˆεL can be obtained as follows
ˆεL = arg min
¯ε(k) Λ
(
¯ε(k)
)
, for k = −G, −G + 1 · · · , −1. (8)
In the following, (8) is denoted as the low-complexity
CMBE (L-CMBE) scheme. Using only N/2 candidate val-
ues, the L-CMBE scheme can offer an almost same per-
formance as the CMBE scheme with the exhaustive search,
which is veriﬁed by simulation results in Section IV.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, the proposed CMBE and L-CMBE
schemes are compared with the Gaussian ML blind estima-
tion (GMBE) scheme in [5] in terms of the mean squared
error (MSE). We assume the following parameters: The IFFT
size N = 64, FO ε = 0.25, the search spacing of 0.001
for the CMBE scheme, and a multipath Rayleigh fading
channel with length L = 8 and an exponential power delay
proﬁle of E[|h(l)|2] = exp(−l/L)/{∑L−1
l=0 exp(−l/L)} for
l = 0, 1, · · · , 7, where h(l) is the lth channel coefﬁcient
of a multipath channel and E[·] denotes the statistical ex-
pectation. Since CISαS noise with α < 2 has an inﬁnite
variance, the standard signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) becomes
meaningless for such a noise. Thus, we employ the geomet-
ric SNR (GSNR) deﬁned as E[|x(k)|2]/(4C−1+2/αγ2/α),
where C = exp{limm→∞(∑m
i=1
1
i − ln m)} ≃ 1.78 is the
exponential of the Euler constant [13]. The GSNR indicates
the relative strength between the information-bearing signal
and the CISαS noise with α < 2. Clearly, the GSNR
becomes the standard SNR when α = 2. Since γ can be
easily and exactly estimated using only the sample mean and
variance of the received samples [14], it may be regarded as
a known value: Thus, γ is set to 1 without loss of generality.
Figs. 1-3 show the MSE performances of the CMBE, L-
CMBE, and GMBE schemes as a function of α when the
GSNR is 5, 10, and 15 dB, respectively. From the ﬁgures,
we can clearly observe that the proposed schemes not only
outperform the conventional scheme for most values of α,
except for those close to 2, but also provide a robustness

to the variation of the value of α. Another important obser-
vation is that the estimation performance of the L-CMBE
scheme is almost same as that of the CMBE scheme. From
this observation, it is conﬁrmed that the candidate values for
the L-CMBE scheme is reasonable.
Fig. 4 shows the MSE performances of the proposed and
conventional schemes as a function of GSNR when α = 1.
From the ﬁgure, we can clearly observe that the proposed
schemes outperform the conventional scheme regardless of
value of GSNR. Moreover, the MSE performance of L-
CMBE is very similar to that of the CMBE, the optimal
FO estimation scheme when α = 1, but also provide a
robustness to the variation of the value of α.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed blind FO estimation
schemes in non-Gaussian noise environments. Based on
the CP structure of OFDM, we ﬁrst have derived a ML
FO estimation scheme in non-gaussian noise modeled as a
complex isotropic Cauchy noise, and then, derived a simpler
blind estimation scheme with a lower complexity. From
simulation results, it has been conﬁrmed that the proposed
schemes offer a robustness and a substantial performance
improvement over the conventional estimation scheme in
non-gaussian noise environments.
