Abstract—This article describes lessons from a large scale 
eHealth system implementation in Finland from the viewpoint 
of evidence-based management. All European Union member 
states have a documented policy on eHealth. A quick literature 
review showed that documented evidence-based management 
strategies for large-scale eHealth system implementation are 
rare. The Finnish framework for providing formative and 
summative 
evidence 
for 
the 
national 
eHealth 
system 
implementation was generated guided by some other large 
scale IS assessment frameworks, especially the Canadian 
approach. First results of the framework’s implementation for 
collecting baseline data are presented together with a plan to 
use the data for decision making in the national eHealth system 
development. The main outputs of the paper are 1) the 
categories of evidence collected in Finland to support decisions 
in the national eHealth system implementation and follow-up, 
2) demonstration of use of these categories in providing results 
from the baseline situation.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Evidence-based management (EBMgt) is an emerging 
management strategy, where the current, best evidence is 
sought for management decision-making. In evidence-based 
medicine (EBM) the idea is defined as: "The conscientious, 
explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making 
decisions about the care of individual patients" [1]. This 
definition has been modified for management by leaving the 
object of decision open. The idea of EBMgt is relevant 
particularly to large and complex systems like the national 
health systems [2]. 
We argue that a National Health Information System 
(NHIS) is also a complex system in itself. The Finnish 
NHIS with its elements and network of actors has been 
described elsewhere [3-4]. Legacy systems and regional 
systems with interfaces to the national archive and 
prescription database form an important element in the 
NHIS. The core system consists of a comprehensive 
electronic patient records including narrative text as well as 
summary and administrative data. This is augmented with 
integrated picture archiving and communicating systems 
(PACS) and electronic laboratory systems.  Even though 
registry keepers are legally separate entities, patient data is 
shared on a secure manner with electronic referral and 
discharge letters and regional databases. Already today, 
much of this data is available regionally, and shared 
between primary and secondary care electronically 
following the care chain of the patient [5, 10-13]. Added 
with a national archive, ePresciption and eViewing system 
to be implemented by 2015, the NHIS fits well with 
characteristics 
of 
complex 
systems 
with 
many 
interconnected human and non-human components, which 
may interact unpredictably. It has a structure, defined by 
parts and their composition, behavior, which involves 
inputs, processing and outputs of material, energy and 
information (or data). It also has interconnectivity: the 
various parts of a system have functional as well as 
structural relationships between each other. Change in one 
of the components can have an impact on some or most of 
the other elements.   
The 
evolving 
Health 
Care 
Information 
and 
Communication Technology Systems (eHealth Systems) 
need to project the features of evolving health care delivery 
systems. For example in Finland new legislation on health 
care service contents and organizational structures is being 
issued during the NHIS development. Decisions regarding 
the development of one complex system (NHIS) and its 
integrating in order to function as part of another evolving 
complex system (the National Health System) would 
undoubtedly benefit from current evidence.  
Section II describes the state of the art of EBMgt in the 
context of NHIS implementation, shortcomings of it and 
how this study aims to contribute to EBMgt in NHIS 
implementation. Section III describes the materials and 
methods used in this study. Section IV elaborates the 
previously published assessment framework by defining 
data dimensions, categories and measures used in baseline 
data collection, as well as first results of the baseline

situation from the viewpoint of one of the key actor groups: 
the doctors. Section V discusses use of the results, their 
shortcomings and future work needed.  
II. 
 STATE OF THE ART IN NHIS EBMGT 
In European countries there has been considerable 
progress in both eHealth policy and deployment in the past 
years. By the end of 2006, 25 of the 27 European Union 
(EU) Member States and the four other European countries 
represented in the i2010 Subgroup on eHealth had a 
documented policy on eHealth [6].  In relation to the 
vigorous development of eHealth programs in different 
countries, national follow up and evaluation policies of 
these programs have emerged slowly [7].  
The idea of basing decisions on evidence is embedded   
e.g., in the framework of health technology assessment 
(HTA). National HTA programs review and advice on 
adoption of new health care interventions. Telemedicine 
interventions have been assessed in this context, but 
complex national scale information systems are basically 
beyond the scope of (traditional) HTA focusing on single 
technologies.  
In Finland, a national framework was constructed in 
2009 for providing national level information to support 
implementation of the NHIS and monitor its success [3-4], 
with review of HTA information categories [8]. A quick 
literature review was conducted as part of the work in early 
2009, where UK, Canada and Australia were found to have 
documented national evaluation frameworks, which were 
included in the review. Most EU Member States are now 
becoming aware that there is an urgent need for 
(continuous) evaluation activities, both to better control 
policy progress and learn from challenges and experiences 
[9], but documented comprehensive frameworks defining 
the needed information for EBMgt in different stages of 
NHIS implementation are still few.   
The study questions are: 1) What kind of information is 
needed for EBMgt and monitoring success of NHIS? 2) 
What results can be obtained by collecting this information 
by a nation-wide questionnaire? 3) How can the results be 
used for concrete EBMgt of NHIS implementation?  
III. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The materials and methods for creating an overall 
evaluation framework have been published elsewhere [3-4]. 
One set of data within it - diffusion and use of eHealth 
systems - has been collected in Finland three times [5, 10-
13]. The study does not cover other aspects of system 
success defined in the overall framework. A complementary 
dataset was compiled in collaboration with the Finnish 
Medical Association, National Institute for Health and 
Welfare (THL), Aalto University (Usability experts) and 
University of Oulu/ FinnTelemedicum (impact assessment 
experts) using conceptual models described in Section IV. 
The first data collection was targeted at baseline prior to 
NHIS implementation focusing on the viewpoint of doctors. 
An electronic survey method with 5-point Likert scale 
questions was used. For the results, points 1-2 were 
combined to form category 'disagree', and 4-5 to category 
'agree'. The Web-survey, conducted in early 2010, was 
targeted to all 14 411 doctors of working age in the Finnish 
Medical Association register, actively engaged in clinical 
work. Responses were received from 3 929 doctors. 
Respondents' age, gender and working sector distribution 
were compared to those of the target group. Women 
responded slightly more actively than men, younger slightly 
less than older. Distributions of working sector were 
identical. The respondents were thus regarded as forming a 
representative sample of the target group [14]. 
The respondents were asked to reply to questions from 
the viewpoint of the system they mainly use and the context 
where they mostly work. In the initial analysis, data 
categories defining the organization type (public inpatient 
vs. outpatient) and the legacy systems used were regarded as 
the first background variables against which the system 
success was viewed. The first results including cross 
tabulations depicting co-variation between the system 
success variables and varying legacy systems used in 
different contexts have been published in the Finnish 
Medical Journal [14, 15].  
The 're-conceptualization' of the questions was needed to 
detect possibilities for creating sum variables as well as 
identifying categories, which require the collection of 
stronger evidence. It also helps in defining such indicators, 
which can be used to monitor (NH)IS success in a context 
and to detect interactions between the social and technical 
system elements. Two researchers first individually grouped 
the questions with the framework elements. An agreement 
was gained in a joint meeting, after which comments from 
others from the team were searched.      
IV. 
RESULTS 
Two main results are described in this section: 
Subsection A depicts the dimensions, categories and 
measures of evidence of NHIS success. Subsection B 
depicts the deployment of them in a national level 
questionnaire and consequent results. 
A. Combining three models for definition of assessment 
dimensions, categories and measures 
Complex systems are composed of many interconnected 
elements. The concept of network was thus used as a 
general concept depicting the entity of NHIS. Nodes of the 
network have been conceptualized with help of a model of 
an activity system used in activity-theoretical analyses of 
information systems, especially in the field of Computer 
Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Karasti et al. have 
investigated collaborative work in a telemedicine setting and 
noticed that molding two different organizations together 
with health ICT tools requires rethinking of the attributes 
that support actual patient work [16, 17]. Actor network 
theory and activity theory have been used as theoretical

basis for a conceptual framework in assessment of the 
contexts of IS use and co-construction of social and 
technical systems [e.g., 18]. The framework sees the 
evolving NHIS elements as tools for the evolving social 
system (the National Health System). Inherent in the model 
of an activity system is its open nature and evolvement.  
Model of an activity system as a node in the network 
depicts the elements of the context of NHIS use, and their 
interaction. With the help of the model, the contextual 
variables depicting the health care system - as well as those 
interrelated systems that provide e.g., norms for the health 
care activity - can be grouped into the following dimensions 
and categories: 
 (network of) health care service users, providers and 
regulators (affected activity systems, nodes of network) 
 Activity system (node of the network) consisting of:  
 
inputs: actors (user characteristics), tools and 
resources, rules, environment, objects->objectives,  
 
processes: combining the inputs, division of work  
 
 outcomes => impacts 
Dimensions of the IS system success model [19, 20] fit 
within the model of activity system, helping to focus on the 
quality of the Information Systems as tools for an activity 
system (care providing organization). The elements of the 
model are: 
 
System quality 
 
Information quality 
 
Service quality 
 
Use 
 
User satisfaction 
 
Net benefits: quality, access, productivity 
Dimension 'use' is an attribute of the activity system 
element 'processes'. Dimension of 'net benefits' is an 
attribute of 'outcomes' of the activity system that can be 
impacted by the NHIS. For defining these, the impact 
mechanisms of each element of the NHIS need to be known. 
These dimensions and data categories were used to 
provide questions regarding the (baseline) NHIS success in 
context, against which post-implementation situation can be 
compared. They also help specifying the needs for 
development as problems detected in certain categories of 
the data. The elements in the two models thus provide data 
for both monitoring the NHIS success (summative 
evaluation) as well as for learning for the development.  
The model for human-centered design of interactive 
systems [21] depicts phases of developing new tools for the 
activity system. The model has consequent elements 
interacting in iterative cycles that can be used as 
checkpoints for collecting evidence for management of the 
development (learning and system development): 
 
The plan and management of the HCD process  
 
Understanding & specification of the context of use  
 
Specification of the stakeholder and organizational 
requirements  
 
Producing design solutions to meet requirements 
 
Evaluation of designs against requirements (iterating 
with previous phase where appropriate)  
 
Introducing the system that meets user requirements  
'Understanding the context of use' and 'specification of 
the stakeholder and organizational requirements' refer to 
information produced in the Activity and IS success models.  
The original IS system success model has been criticized 
for not taking into account contextual and business process-
aspects [22]. Suggestions to add contextual elements have 
included addition of meso-level categories of 'people', 
'organization' 
and 
'implementation' 
and 
macro-level 
categories 
of 
'standards', 
'legislation, 
policy 
and 
governance', 'funding' and 'societal, political and economic 
trends' [23]. The Finnish framework contains macro-level 
elements as interrelations between the activity systems in 
the network (e.g., norm- or funds-providers and health care 
providers) and meso-level categories within each activity 
system. The added value of the theory-based conceptual 
model used in the Finnish framework is depicting the inter-
relations of the contextual elements on macro-, meso- and 
micro-level and IS system elements. It sets the IS system as 
part of this socio-technical system as a whole. The detailed 
categories and measures for context and success variables 
are presented in Table II in annex 1.    
B. NHIS success (Baseline): doctors' views    
There were 919 replies from public outpatient units/ 
health centers. 63 % of respondents were women, 37 % 
men. Average age was 48 years (from 24 to 64 yrs). Almost 
half of the respondents (48 %) were from units using system 
'A' as the legacy system. Over third used system 'B' (39 %), 
5 % used system 'C', and 5% used system 'D' (5 %). The rest 
used several other systems. Three out of four respondents 
had over 3 years experience in using the respective legacy 
system, and only 3% were novice users (less than 6 mths 
experience). [14] 
Big differences in the baseline situation were detected 
between the two contexts (public sector outpatient units and 
hospitals) [14-15]. Results of the private sector have not yet 
been processed. Table I presents results within public 
outpatient units. There are differences between IS success 
variables as well as legacy systems used. Some of the IS 
system quality variables got poor scores from users of all 
systems, e.g., response time and IS compatibility, some 
better (e.g., error rate). Availability of radiology results and 
content of laboratory results (information quality variables) 
scored relatively well across legacy systems, availability of 
patient information from other organizations, including 
medication information and summary view got poor scores. 
IS system support for collaboration between workers within 
organizations scored better than collaboration between 
organizations (outcome variables). Major differences 
between the legacy systems were identified in ease of use, 
decision support systems, content of nursing record, 
medication list, prevention of medication errors and help in 
achieving health outcomes.

V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The study offers for the first time a nationwide snapshot 
of success of the IS tools for patient care. The results show 
that the view of the doctors is relatively critical. The IS 
systems are regarded too slow, partly unreliable, not offering 
the type of information (e.g., summaries) needed, and they 
may even create patient safety problems. Similar results have 
been received from other studies [8, 24-27]. User 
experiences need to be better incorporated into IS 
development [8]. Results like the urgent need for summary 
data, comprehensive medication list and easier access to 
patient information across organizations can directly be used 
when making strategic decisions about trade-offs in NHIS 
implementation. The differences between legacy systems 
provide important benchmarking data for the vendors.  
Establishment of an operational steering unit for NHIS 
development and implementation within THL in the 
beginning of 2011 paves way for integration of the 
evaluation framework as part of the EBMgt strategy of the 
NHIS implementation. The unit will use results of the study 
as one means in setting priorities for action.  
There are several limitations in the study in respect of 
evidence required from the baseline situation for NHIS 
development, which need further work or consideration. ICT 
support needed by physicians' out-patient consultations is 
used as an example for the model use. Other set ups are 
needed for identifying critical elements in different processes 
such as chronic care or surgical theaters or emergency care 
settings. 
Legacy systems form only one element in a complex 
NHIS, and doctors are only one user group impacted by the 
implementation of the NHIS. Reply rate (27%) was low even 
though sample was representative. The proportion of neutral 
('3') responses was not reported.  
Questionnaire-based 
studies 
offer 
a 
relatively 
comprehensive but shallow view to the phenomenon studied. 
Even though doctors were involved in formulating the 
questions, the method is prone to different interpretations of 
questions, and complementary methods are required for 
more detailed information on issues that are identified in a 
survey. Analysis of the data needs to be continued by 
comparisons between contexts as well as co-variation of 
different contextual variables with the success factors. 
 Further research is also needed regarding formulation of 
the measures in order to capture the potential impacts in 
varying clinical processes in a language that is meaningful to 
the doctors and at the same time true to the framework. The 
24 questions used in the Canadian framework [22] were not 
regarded 
sufficient 
to 
reflect 
the 
different 
impact 
mechanisms of different elements in the NHIS for doctor 
consultations, where the clinical work processes were taken 
as the starting point for the questionnaire (to speak the 
doctors' language).  
Re-conceptualization of the questions revealed several 
variables, which could be used to create sum variables. There 
are also variables, for which there is data available in 
national level statistics (especially for actor- and patient- as 
well as outcome-variables). Further research is required to 
achieve the long term aim of condensing the data and 
combining it to such indicators, which can be used to 
monitor (NH)IS success in varying contexts and processes 
and to detect interactions between the elements of social and 
technical systems.  
Variation of the elements and conceptual frameworks in 
international studies makes it difficult to sum up previous 
experiences [28]. According to literature reviews [e.g., 29] 
many theoretical models exist for measuring IS success, and  
most of the studies only employ a subset of proposed 
dimensions, the relevance of which is still debated [30]. The 
indicator work that has started in Finland would greatly 
benefit from at least some level of international agreement 
on the 'minimum data set' for (NH)IS success and contextual 
variables in order to collect data that can be used also for 
international comparisons, as suggested in Medinfo 2010 
panel on 'Monitoring the effects of health information 
systems' by the Danish, Canadian and Norwegian colleagues.
