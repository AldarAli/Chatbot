center because of physical (there’s not adequate space for
BS setting) or social (BS setting is not permitted) reason,
and in this case, the regular cell shape does not ﬁt in with
the reality.
In authors’ previous work [11], we carried out BSC
assessment in the codition of irregular cell geometry derived
from Voronoi diagram which changes the cell shape and size
based on BS location, but there, only the single stream trans-
mission has been considered. This paper extends assessment
to multistream transmission fully utilizing the fact that BSs
and UTs are all equipped with multiantenna, and to the case
where the shape and size of cells are ﬂexibly determined
based on not only BS location but also inter-BS-UT channel
condition.
III. SYSTEM MODEL AND DESIGN ALGORITHMS
In this section, the model of cellular system and its design
algorithms are shortly described.
A. System Model
In the cellular system considered here (imagine cell
geometry like Fig. 1), one BS exists in each cell, and it
communicates one active user chosen from UTs (both sides
are equipped with multiantenna). If different frequency band
is used in all the cells, no interference occurs among cells,
but frequency efﬁciency becomes quite low. Hence members
of a group consisting of some cells use common frequency,
and it brings the problem of inter-cell interference. The in-
terference cancellation is possible utilizing the multiantenna
processing, but if BS are connected through backhaul link,
they can share information (e.g., channel and data), which
enables BSC to derive a higher total performance. This effect
is larger in the cell edge where the target signal is attenuated
and interferences become relatively strong. The rest of this
subsection provides a model suitable for the analysis of BSC
under practical conditions.
In this study, BS location is nonuniformly allocated, and
their location is expressed by the displacement from the
conventional hexagonal center. The conventional cells are
shown by green dashed line in Fig. 1: they are numbered
anti-clockwise from the inside to the outside (Cell

of BSC in this paper is cooperative transmission utilizing
share of Channel State Information (CSI)

improvement, BSC with data sharing achieves about three
times larger capacity than that of Case 3 without BSC, and in
addition, its curve has a steeper gradient which means better
outage characteristics. The amount of the improvement in
Cell 0 surrounded by 6 cells is larger than in border
cell (Cell 6), since the origins of interferences change to
the sources of the desired signal.
The relation between input SNR and sum capacity is
depicted in Fig. 6. While Case 3 without BSC cannot
improve the performance because of the residual interfer-
ence (degrees of freedom in UT are not enough), methods
with BSC (Case 4 and Case 5) steadily increase the capacity
as SNR becomes higher.
From those results, we can see that BSC is still effective
in multistream transmission.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper has investigated the effect of BSC under
multistream transmission assuming that BSs and UTs are all

equipped with multiantenna, and the shape and size of cells
are ﬂexibly determined based on BS location and inter BS-
UT channel condition. First, the nature of interferences from
outer cells has been assessed. Then, the performance gain of
BSC has been evaluated using ﬁve types of algorithms with
and without BSC through computer simulations. The results
show that BSC achieves about three times larger capacity
compared to cooperation less scheme.
The future work is the investigation of BSC effect under
the imperfect CSI. The extension of this work to relay aided
BSC is also an attractive and important subject of study.
