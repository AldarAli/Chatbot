Abstract—Clinical pathways have been promoted to maximize 
care coordination. Over the last decade, they have developed 
into patient-centric pathways, including the patient's needs 
and expectations of future health care. Integrated patient-
centric pathways facilitate and encourage the coordination 
between multiple levels of care. Electronic Health Records 
(EHRs) contain information that could support integrated, 
patient-centric pathways. This paper aims to identify the 
challenges of modelling patient-centric pathways spanning 
primary and specialist care and provide guidelines for meeting 
those challenges. The study results show the lack of a standard 
definition of an integrated, patient-centric pathway and the 
various methods used to describe them. Finally, the study 
provides recommendations for a new approach for modelling 
EHR-supported, patient-centric pathways across the care 
continuum. 
Keywords-patient-centric care; pathway modelling; integrated 
care; electronic health records. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
A rise in life expectancy has increased the need for more 
complex health care as the number of patients with multiple 
chronic conditions increases [1]. More resources are needed 
to provide the same level of care, challenging the health care 
services available for other vulnerable groups, such as young 
adults struggling with mental illness. Simultaneously, 
innovative drug treatments, therapies, and technology allow 
patients to receive care in their own homes. Health literacy 
amongst the general population, developed through media, 
has increased patient expectations [2] and changed the 
relationship between the patient and the healthcare provider 
and the understanding of patient-centred care [3]. Clinical 
pathways have been promoted as a response to meet the 
patient's needs and expectations of future health care and 
maximize care coordination [4]. Extensive research on 
implementing clinical pathways has also improved quality of 
life and reduced morbidity [5].  
The health care sector has been through several reforms 
to implement pathways for different illnesses. Various terms 
for clinical pathways have been used, such as "clinical 
guidelines", "patient pathways", "care pathways", or 
"integrated care pathways" [6][7]. A common understanding 
defines a clinical pathway as standardized steps to rapidly 
diagnose the patient's illness and initiate treatment [8]. 
Clinical pathways can have different aims, such as 
integrating multidisciplinary teams (horizontal integration) 
or integrating services across primary, secondary and tertiary 
care (vertical integration) [9]. Care pathways are often seen 
as a "care coordination" tool to optimize the sequence of 
healthcare interventions performed by multidisciplinary 
teams across disease groups and health settings [7]. Though 
the terms are used interchangeably, care integration is aimed 
"to facilitate and encourage the coordination between levels 
of care" [10]. The term integrated care pathways, understood 
as vertically integrated, will be used in this paper. 
The use of pathways as a "clinician-directed, patient-
focused response" to coordinate care [11] is challenged by 
the changing understanding of what patient-focused care, 
also referred to as "patient-centred", "personalized", or 
"patient-centric" care, is. Conventionally, the patient focus 
has been interpreted within a biomedical framework, where 
the patient's illness is defined by a set of signs and symptoms 
[12]. In the late 1960ies, the patient focus included 
"providing information to the patient" [13]. Over time, the 
understanding of patient-centric care developed to include 
taking into account the whole person, exploring the patients' 
experience and ideas about the problem as a resource to 
guide the interaction, sharing power and agreeing on 
managing their illness [14]. Recent research, such as by 
Rand, Dunn, Slade, Upadhyaya, and Sheehan [15], argues 
that patient experience should be viewed as evidence in 
healthcare decision-making. Together, the understanding of 
"patient-centric" and the "integrated care pathways" defines 
the concept of patient-centric, integrated care pathways for 
the context of this paper.

Whereas the patient needs and demands can be said to 
"force the integration of services", the supply side, including 
technology and information systems, may facilitate it [10]. 
Access to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is considered 
an essential component [1] of supporting patient-centric, 
integrated care pathways [16]. Guided by a multilevel, socio-
technical lens, healthcare delivery can be represented on a 
system level (macro), a meso level, concerned with regional 
and local health services and community factors, and a micro 
level, 
representing 
every-day 
practices 
and 
patient 
perspectives [17]. At a macro level, sharing information can 
allow for better planning of services [18] and, at a meso 
level, contribute to integrating professional teams and 
healthcare organizations. At a micro level, increased access 
to EHRs could support the empowerment of patients and 
improve the quality of care [10].  
In general, many approaches, modelling methods and 
tools have been used to describe pathways in healthcare; 
several adapted from other industries [19]. Traditional 
process-modelling methods, such as Business Process 
Modelling Notation (BPMN) [20] and Event-driven Process 
Chain (EPC) [21], have been used to describe work 
processes at a macro or meso level. Lean Design principles 
have been used to model meso-level pathways in quality 
improvement projects [22]. Key Service Design concepts 
have been used for transformative healthcare service 
research, viewing knowledge of patients, their families and 
healthcare professionals as essential to understanding the 
healthcare service needs. The Service Design approach has 
also evolved to address technology-enabled services 
[23][24]. "Customer Journey Mapping" (CJM), referred to as 
"Patient Journey Mapping" (PJM), when applied in 
healthcare, 
represents 
a 
micro-level, 
patient-centric 
perspective of the health care service based on the patient 
narrative [25]. Customer Journey Mapping Language 
(CJML) is a more recently developed framework for 
customer journey analysis [26]. Data-driven pathway 
modelling, such as Process Mining, has been used to support 
building pathways by using existing data from EHRs to 
display the actual patient pathway [27]. Unified Modelling 
Language (UML) has provided a more system-centric 
modelling method, connecting stakeholders, tasks and 
system intended functionality [28]. 
While different methods are available for modelling each 
of the health service levels, to the best of our knowledge, 
there is no single modelling tool currently available that 
collectively addresses the macro, meso and micro levels. 
This paper provides a general overview of the research and 
methodological guidance on modelling integrated, patient-
centric pathways across multiple levels of care by (1) 
identifying the challenges of modelling patient-centric 
pathways spanning primary and specialist care and (2) 
providing 
recommendations 
for 
dealing 
with 
these 
challenges.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the literature search, and Section III describes 
different approaches to describe integrated patient-centric 
pathways. A discussion on how to combine methods to meet 
the challenges of modelling cross-sectional pathways is 
outlined in Section IV before concluding the paper in Section 
V. 
II. 
METHODS 
A literature search was conducted using the PubMed and 
Scopus databases, restricted to the years 2006-2022. The 
databases were chosen to cover both the medical and 
technological sides of pathway modelling. The inclusion 
criteria for the search were studies describing how patient-
centric pathways were modelled, published in English. This 
initial, broad search resulted in keywords used for a search in 
title, abstract and keywords narrowed down by using the 
terms "patient", "pathway" and "journey" combined with 
variations of the terms "centric" and "centred" to capture 
articles with a patient-centric approach when describing the 
pathways. To ensure the relevance of the articles to the 
problem described regarding care integration the terms 
"integrated", 
"coordinated", 
"collaborative", 
and 
"multidisciplinary" were added. Finally, variations of the 
terms "modelling", "developing", "mapping", constructing", 
"framework", or "method" were added to find literature that 
described pathway-modelling methods. 
The PubMed search string was: ((patient-centered 
care[MeSH Major Topic]) OR ("patient-centric care")) AND 
((Delivery of Health Care, Integrated) OR coordinated* OR 
collaborative OR multidisciplinary) AND (pathway* OR 
journey*) AND (model* OR framework or method*) AND 
(developing OR mapping or constructing). The Scopus 
search string TITLE-ABS-KEY(("patient-centered care" OR 
"patient-centric care") AND (integrated OR coordinated OR 
collaborative OR multidisciplinary) AND (pathway* OR 
journey*) AND (model* OR framework OR method*) AND 
(developing OR mapping OR constructing)) returned 31 
articles, none which met the inclusion criteria. The terms 
related to integrated care were limiting the number of results 
and therefore removed. Based a search for relevant keywords 
to capture articles in Scopus regarding modelling methods   
two new terms were added: "pathway mapping" and 
"journey mapping". The final Scopus search string was: 
"pathway mapping" OR "journey mapping" AND patient 
AND pathway OR journey AND model* OR framework OR 
method* AND developing OR mapping OR constructing. 
III. 
RESULTS 
The search returned a total of 127 journal articles. The 
lack of a common definition of an integrated, patient-centric 
pathway and standards for modelling them risks biasing the 
literature search results. The variation in terminology is 
characteristic of an emerging intersectional topic such as 
designing patient-centric care pathways spanning multiple 
healthcare levels, possibly supported by digital tools or/and 
EHR data. Conceptually, similar research can be reported in 
very different disciplines.  
The articles were screened based on their abstracts. The 
inclusion criteria were: (1) methods for modelling were 
discussed (2) patients were engaged in developing the 
pathway models and (3) the pathways included multiple 
healthcare levels. The article had to include at least two of 
the criteria to be included. Clinical guidelines describing a

workflow for a specific diagnosis in a hospital setting, 
though common in pathway research, were excluded as the 
research described in this paper focuses on integrated, 
patient-centric pathways across the care continuum.  
The first criteria resulted in 88 articles being excluded. 
After full-text reviewing 39 articles, 28 were excluded, as 
they did not satisfy at least two of the inclusion criteria. In 
addition, two were excluded as they were by the same 
authors, describing the same methods, only used for different 
diseases. The remaining nine were included in this study 
[29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37]. 
Models on all of the macro, meso and micro levels 
presented earlier were represented in the research. Four 
studies discussed issues in regards to modelling pathways 
across multiple healthcare levels [32][34][36][37]. All the 
included studies described patients as being engaged in 
developing the pathways. Three studies used a participatory 
research design [30][35][37], actively involving patients 
throughout the development process, representing the shift to 
a more holistic patient-centric care. In these studies, data to 
build the pathways were obtained through observations, 
interviews, focus groups, surveys and workgroups, engaging 
patients and their care providers, and the clinicians’ 
participation secured the meso-perspective in the pathway. 
Only one study used data from the EHR in a data-driven 
approach that contributed to understanding the information 
flow throughout the pathways [33]. The approach included 
using several IT artefacts, such as a smartphone app and 
home-based medical equipment, to provide data to an EHR 
for clinicians.  
The patient-centric pathways, or patient journeys, were 
modelled using a variety of approaches, from general 
illustrations [29][34], spreadsheets [35] or diagrams [37], to 
some variation of a flowchart [29][32][34] or patient journey 
map [35]. One article described the use of software-
development methodologies to design pathways [30]. Data 
gathered through review of medical charts was used to 
generate pathways in one article [36]. Two articles discussed 
methodological issues without presenting a model [31][33]. 
Process mining was discussed to complement pathway 
mapping, derivating patient pathways from electronic health 
records [33]. None of the articles included in the study 
presented the use of digital modelling tools develop the 
pathways.  
Five studies mentioned digital technology and EHR data 
as critical components for successfully implementing patient-
centric pathways [29][30][33][34][35]. Furthermore, the 
studies discussed how digital technology could be integrated 
into the patient pathway to support the exchange of health 
data in real-time, opening a proactive approach to care. One 
study developed system supported pathways through a 
secured web-based platform, including functions covering 
the end-to-end care process [30].  
Three studies reported that existing patient pathway 
mapping tools required modifications to reflect patient 
journeys across multiple healthcare settings [30][35][37].  
When developing the pathways, different objectives and 
perspectives on patient care also caused tension and 
obstacles between different levels of care, challenging the 
collaborative process of designing patient pathways [32]. 
Others described how a patient-centric approach to pathway 
modelling challenged knowledge silos, helped bridge 
disciplinary boundaries and provided a possibility to develop 
a common language around the multi-organizational 
pathway [35][37]. It was also argued that an EHR-supported, 
data-driven, or at least data-supported, patient-centric 
pathway could improve the continuity of care in a disaster 
situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as it would have 
permitted more precise management of the emergency 
response undertaken in primary and specialist care [34]. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION  
The first objective of this paper was to assess the 
challenges of modelling patient-centric pathways across 
multiple healthcare levels. Though the issue has been 
described theoretically in several studies, this paper's 
literature search neither provided methods to develop such 
pathways nor guidelines to do so. Consequently, self-
designing a method is considered a suitable approach for the 
second objective of this paper; providing recommendations 
in the form of guidelines for how to deal with these 
challenges. The characteristics of patient-centric, integrated, 
EHR-supported care pathways, as described earlier, become 
requirements for the recommended modelling approach.  
On the macro and meso levels, process modelling, when 
using a common language and easily understandable 
notation, has been documented to offer a greater 
understanding of different stakeholder perspectives across 
disciplines and organizational levels in healthcare [19]. 
Though no relevant research was found on using process 
modelling methods to model integrated, data-supported 
patient-centric pathways as defined in this paper, process 
modelling 
is 
considered 
beneficial 
to 
enhance 
communication and gather consensus for work processes at a 
macro and meso level and across multiple healthcare 
organizations. 
At the micro level, the Service Design approach, the 
Lean method and PJM all base the pathway models on 
patient narratives. Co-designing pathways with patients is a 
central element in these methods to empower patients. 
Including patients in the analysis and design of care 
pathways could also help identify gaps in the integrated care 
provision. However, PJM does not necessarily capture the 
clinical side of the patient pathway. Combining the patient 
perspective with principal activities in the clinical workflows 
as they are seen in the eyes of the healthcare professionals 
into one pathway model can aid in creating a shared 
understanding of the patient-centric pathway as a whole. 
Figure 1 presents a simple model using a combination of 
BPMN and CJML to develop a conceptual model to illustrate 
the complexity of modelling integrated, patient-centric care 
pathways. The model presents the start of care; a patient's 
initial meeting with their general practitioner (GP), the 
referral to specialized care, the health care levels involved, 
the healthcare professionals' activities, and the IT systems 
that supports these activities.  
Digital modelling tools, such as MEGA, Qualiware X, 
BiZZdesign or Essential Project, are available for modelling

pathways. Such tools allow sharing and reusing of models 
and 
can 
balance 
the 
trade-off 
between 
overview, 
comprehensiveness and detail. Recent expansions of BPMN, 
such as BPM+ Health, could add the possibility of 
deconstructing conceptual pathway models into more 
precise, possibly executable models, “connecting” the Patient

[16]. This would represent the leap from a conceptual 
patient-centric pathway model to a digital one. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The results from the literature search of this study present 
the variety of methods used to describe patient pathways and 
how the lack of a standardized methodological approach 
challenges the call for healthcare services transformation into 
more integrated, patient-centric care. We have suggested 
guidelines to meet those challenges, emphasizing the need to 
integrate the different stakeholder views and EHR data into 
one pathway model to provide an overview of essential 
elements in the pathway from a macro, meso and micro level 
perspective.  
Combining BPMN, CJML, and BPM+ methods can help 
overcome the limitations of a specific method and provide a 
different healthcare research approach that meets the request 
from 
earlier 
research 
to 
design 
healthcare 
service 
experiences 
that 
qualify 
patient-centeredness, 
care 
integration and the use of EHR data to support the pathways. 
Further work is needed to develop method formalism, 
improve the visual presentation of the models' different 
perspectives, and exploit the potential of digital tools and 
reusable patient pathway templates. Finally, there is a need 
to explore how data from EHRs, regardless of where the 
EHR is located, can support integrated, patient-centric 
pathways.
