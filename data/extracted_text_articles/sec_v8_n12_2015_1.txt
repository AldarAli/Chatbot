Abstract — Phone fraud attacks cause a massive loss 
in the telecommunication sector every year. The 
internet raises new potentials for these attacks. 
Attackers can use the internet to get illegal access to 
telecommunication devices such as Voice over 
Internet Protocol (VoIP) phones and use them for 
fraudulent calls to expensive destinations in overseas 
countries. The generated financial damage affects the 
attacked customers and also the telecommunications 
companies 
that 
provide 
the 
telecommunication 
services. Especially, attacks on small and medium-
sized enterprises can threaten their existence. This 
demands protection for the customers and companies 
by a fraud detection system with intelligent detection 
techniques for detection and prevention of these fraud 
cases. In this work, we present two statistical online 
user profiling approaches, as well as a call destination 
profiling approach and a behavior pattern recognition 
approach for toll fraud detection. All four approaches 
show good and promising results. Especially, the 
results of the call destination profiling, for detection of 
distributed attacks on a single destination, and the 
behavior pattern recognition, for detection of change 
in a user’s behavior patterns, are promising for future 
work.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extended version of [1]. The 
previous work got improved and combined with 
other works, which were derived from previous 
work [2] [3] of the authors for better results. We 
enrich this paper with new information about the 
previous work, subsequent improvements and 
derivations of it. Therefore, an initial user profiling 
approach, a new user profiling approach, a call 
destination profiling approach and a behavior 
pattern recognition approach are presented that try 
to solve the problems described in the following 
paragraphs. 
Today’s voice communication by Voice over IP 
(VoIP) mostly uses the internet for data transport. 
There are the drawbacks that the internet can 
basically be accessed by anyone, and that it links 
anyone to anyone. For example, it is possible for 
third parties with criminal intent to access private 
branch exchange (PBX) systems connected to the 
internet. 
Fraudsters may have multiple options to abuse 
these systems. Systems that are insufficiently 
secured may be tapped. Access data that has been 
saved in these systems could be used to abuse, 
compromise or even gain full access to the whole 
PBX. If the PBX system has been taken over, a 
fraudster will be able to conduct telephone calls to 
premium rate service numbers or comparable call 
destinations, generating profit. The resulting cost, on 
the other hand, will often be charged to the victim or 
its telecommunication service provider, because of a 
general rule in telecommunication service providing 
called “Calling Party Pays”. 
The Communications Fraud Control Association 
(CFCA) reports losses of about 46 billion USD 
caused by telecommunication fraud in 2013, an 
increase by 15% compared to 2011 [4]. Not only 
financial damage is a problem caused by fraud 
attacks. Small providers may also suffer from 
reputation losses, causing customers to change the 
provider because of decreased trust and fear of 
repeated fraud attempts in the future. 
To detect and counter these attacks, respectively 
fraud attempts, fraud detection systems are used. 
Often, these systems apply methods based on the 
generation of statistical profiles for each user. User 
profiles are generated that describe their behavior. 
These profiles will then be used as input for 
machine learning techniques, allowing for the 
detection of fraud [5] [6] [7] [8]. 
The German company “Deutsche Telekom” 
reported a huge success in the prevention of fraud 
cases with potential damages of about 200 million 
Euro, using an automated fraud detection system 
[9]. The research project “Trusted Telephony” at the 
University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt, from 
which the work at hand originates, pursues the goal 
to increase security in VoIP telephony, cooperating 
with a German telecom service provider. A key 
objective of the project is the development of a 
fraud detection system.  
Recently, fraud cases were caused by security 
exploits in FRITZ!Box hardware (from the company 
AVM GmbH), which is often used in Germany [10] 
[11]. A FRITZ!Box is an integrated, multifunctional 
routing device, offering internet connectivity, VoIP 
capabilities and other services in local area 
networks. Such a unit is very popular in Germany. 
Because of the large amount of units in use, there is 
an increased risk in case of security vulnerabilities, 
especially for private users.  
On the other hand, an exploitation of the recently 
disclosed security vulnerability of such a unit is only 
one possibility to start such attacks. The security 
vulnerability has been patched by the manufacturer 
in the meantime, but in the future, comparable 
vulnerabilities in similar hardware could turn up.

Therefore, it is important to be able to detect these 
cases and devise measures to counter them.

detection system using them. 
A. Call detail records 
The data being analyzed in this work comprises 
fraud attacks that have been enabled by the occurred 
and already patched security vulnerability of the 
FRITZ!Box units [10].  
A CDR is a text file containing all parameters of 
single telephone calls. Each CDR is written by a 
primary 
VoIP 
routing 
system 
called 
TELES.iSWITCH [12] as calls are set up (see 
Figure 1). CDRs contain information on caller, 
callee, call duration, starting time, as well as 
technical network parameters. 
B. Structure of the paper 
The structure of this paper is as follows: The 
related work is presented in Section II, followed by 
an explanation of behavior profiling in Section III, 
as it is important for the described approaches. 
Section IV gives an in-depth analysis of attacks on 
FRITZ!Box units. The following sections except 
future work and conclusion provide a description of 
various 
approaches, 
each 
followed 
by 
an 
experimental setup including results and a short 
conclusion. Section V is about the previous basic 
user profiling approach, which is being extended by 
the work at hand. In Section VI, a new basic 
behavior profiling concept is presented. In order to 
adapt to the FRITZ!Box incident and to detect these 
fraud cases, another approach by the authors called 
destination profiling is described in Section VII. The 
concept of communication behavior patterns, which 
also deals with the FRITZ!Box incident, is outlined 
in Section VIII. An overall conclusion is presented 
in Section IX, followed by future work in Section X.  
II. RELATED WORK 
This paper is an extended version of [1] and also 
includes intermediate works [2] [3] that improved 
the quality of presented techniques greatly.  
The first intermediate work presented a behavior 
profiling different from user profiling to cope with 
distributed single target toll fraud attacks. The 
second intermediate work introduces behavior 
pattern recognition to detect changes in patterns of 
the users. Patterns can be defined and extended 
dynamically. 
All of the previous and intermediate work is 
improved in this paper. 
In [1], a method for toll fraud detection using 
statistical user profiling has been described, which 
can especially be applied when no significant 
amount of training data is available. Additionally, 
the method can be run in a mostly autonomous way, 
requiring only a minimum amount of external 
administration. The method applies two user 
profiles, one for a past period of time and one for a 
present period of time, each containing statistical 
features. The profiles are used to identify suspicious 
deviations of the user’s behavior, by which toll 
fraud attempts are detected. In this work, the attacks 
on FRITZ!Box hardware and the possibility to 
detect these using the presented method had already 
been mentioned. 
In the work at hand, the method from the 
preliminary work is adapted more closely to this 
attack pattern. The new method again uses two 
profiles of statistical features for each user, but 
differing in contents and their actual use for the 
detection of attacks. 
Furthermore, other related work also describes 
different methods of user profiling for the detection 
and 
prevention 
of 
toll 
fraud 
in 
VoIP 
telecommunication [5] [6] [8] [13] [14] [15]. In 
contrast to this work, the previous work [2] does not 
apply simple user profiles, but a new kind of profile 
specified as Call Destination Profile. These profiles 
are used to characterize the behavior of a destination 
telephone number instead of a user’s behavior. It is 
intended to detect special kinds of attacks this way.  
These attacks cannot be detected with user 
profiling techniques alone and hence would go 
undetected if the method from [1] was applied.  
As a means to visualize user accounts, self-
organizing maps (SOM) are used in [16]. This 
visualization is used to differentiate between normal 
and fraudulent ones. The features call destination, 
call start time and call duration are extracted from 
the CDR data and used for analysis. According to 
the authors, the method has a true positive rate 
(TPR) of 90% and a false positive rate (FPR) of 
10%.  
A framework for self-organizing maps has been 
developed by Hollmén, Tresp and Simula [17] to 
cluster probabilistic models. User profiles using data 
of mobile communication networks have been used 
for test runs of the system. The output is presented 
visually, so that the fraudulent calls can be 
distinguished from normal ones.  
The authors of [18] focus on the detection of 
superimposed fraud using two signature methods, 
each summarizing a user’s behavior. The first 
presented approach is based on a deviation of the 
user’s current behavior and his signature, while the 
second is based on a dynamic clustering analysis. In 
the second approach, a sudden change or “shift” of a 
user’s signature from one cluster to another is the 
criterion for a classification as fraud. The similarity 
between a signature and a cluster centroid, which in 
itself is defined as a signature, is crucial for such a 
shift. The detection rates of both methods have been 
estimated: The first one promises a TPR of 75% and 
the second one a TPR of 91%. Also, a combination 
of both approaches is examined. 
The framework SUNsHINE, which is able to 
detect and prevent VoIP fraud by combining real-
time capable components with an offline statistical 
analysis, is presented in [19]. Multiple data sources,

network traffic data and CDRs, can be used. 
Different algorithms and techniques are used, e.g., 
rule sets, profiling, neural networks and clustering. 
No estimations concerning the detection rate are 
given. 
The intermediate work [3] has been inspired by 
the concept of clustering algorithms, as the aspect of 
finding similarities has been adopted, leading to a 
different point of view in contrast to [2]. 
III. 
BEHAVIOR PROFILING 
The term “behavior profiling” describes a 
technique for differential analysis where the 
behavior of a given object is represented by a 
statistical profile. In literature, a distinction is made 
between absolute and differential analysis. 
An absolute analysis examines a whole set of 
data, trying to identify fraud cases, but does not 
consider different types of user behavior. A call that 
may be treated as a fraud case for one user could be 
no fraud case for another user. For example, one 
user only makes long calls to his family at weekends 
and the other user only makes long calls to his 
family at workdays. If an absolute analysis considers 
long calls at workdays as fraud cases, the latter user 
will be considered as fraudulent, just because his 
normal behavior does not comply with the definition 
of normal behavior given by the other user. This 
problem can be avoided by looking at each user and 
his behavior differently, thus called differential 
analysis. 
Differential analysis is preferred to absolute 
analysis in most of the related work, e.g., [20] [7] 
[21] [22]. The main argument is the ability of 
differential analysis to include the absolute 
analysis. In other words, a fraud case detected by an 
absolute analysis can also be found by a differential 
analysis, but a fraud case detected by a differential 
analysis cannot always be found by an absolute 
analysis [20]. 
In the profile, data from the object is 
accumulated, which is then used to generate 
statistics that describe the object’s behavior, which 
are called features. Often, behavior profiles are 
applied in the form of user profiles [5] [6] [8] [13] 
[14] [15]. In most cases, a differential analysis is 
preferred over an absolute analysis. This is because 
the absolute analysis is a subset of the differential 
analysis [9].  
For example, three variants of user profiling 
methods are presented in [7]. In this work, the 
parameters duration per call, number of calls per 
customer and costs per call are arranged in different 
ways into the groups national calls, international 
calls and mobile calls. These are used to generate 
statistics for the profiles. 
User profiles are utilized to describe the 
behavior of users in the present and in the past, 
enabling a comparison of behavioral patterns. By 
this comparison, it is possible to detect suspicious 
fluctuations. These are analyzed in the next step in 
order to generate a decision on fraudulent or non-
fraudulent behavior.  
IV. 
ANALYSIS OF ATTACKS ON FRITZ!BOXES 
The recent attacks at (and by) FRITZ!Boxes can 
be divided in two categories. The first category 
comprises the hostile take-over of a FRITZ!Box by 
exploiting a security vulnerability in its firmware. 
The second category comprises possible results of 
such a take-over, especially secondary attacks that 
are enabled by then remotely controllable units. 
Both categories are described in more detail in the 
following subsections. It is important to note that the 
initially possible attacks on these units cannot be 
conducted anymore, since the firmware has been 
updated by the manufacturer in the meantime [11]. 
The focus of the work at hand is at the possibility of 
fraud attacks on telecommunication systems by 
utilizing taken over secondary hardware, which is 
not unlikely to happen again in the future, and 
detecting it.  
A. Primary hostile take-over of a FRITZ!Box 
The basic idea to perform a hostile take-over of a 
FRITZ!Box was as follows: An attacker would set 
up a web site, which is to be visited by potential 
victims. The attacker would then be able to exploit 
the known security vulnerability of the FRITZ!Box 
in order to extract the master password. Using this 
password, the attacker would be able to access the 
command shell. Once this is done, the attacker could 
then deploy system commands, e.g., to make the 
unit call premium rate service numbers at the cost of 
the unit’s owner [11]. 
B. Secondary attacks after the take-over 
Attack attempts on other systems that had been 
conducted using taken over FRITZ!Boxes seem to 
be very similar in their basic approach. For an in-
depth analysis, anonymized data on such attack 
attempts has been provided by a telecom company. 
The data being used is in accordance to the Federal 
German 
Data 
Protection 
Act 
(Bundesdatenschutzgesetz) [23]. All results from 
this analysis are based on this data and may not 
represent attack patterns that appeared at other 
telecommunication providers. 
From a single user’s view 
From the perspective of a single user, an attack 
attempt may look as follows: An attacker tries to set 
up a call to a premium rate service number or a 
comparably expensive call destination, possibly also 
in another country. This is done multiple times 
during a short time span. As soon as the attacker has 
successfully set up a call to a given number, he will 
try to call this number again, as often as possible, 
and also in a short period of time. If the call attempts 
fail (e.g., because the number is not available), the 
attacker will try another number. 
The difficulty to detect such attack attempts lies 
in the low frequency and the low duration of these 
calls seen from a single user’s point of view. 
Attackers will avoid a detection using these two 
parameters by applying an approach described in the 
next section.

Exploiting multiple users 
By exploiting the security vulnerability at 
multiple victims' FRITZ!Box units, attackers are 
able to hide their attack attempts neatly. The attack 
attempts are distributed across multiple taken over 
units. So, it becomes possible to mask obvious 
evidence of attack attempts, such as frequency and 
duration of calls. This will be illustrated by the 
following examples: 
1. Attacker A conducts a hostile take-over of 
victim C and causes C’s unit to start 30 calls 
to destination number B. The duration of 
each call is 20 seconds. 
2. Attacker A conducts a hostile take-over of 
victim C and causes C’s unit to start 5 calls 
to destination number B. The duration of 
each call is 5 minutes. 
3. Attacker A conducts hostile take-overs of 30 
victims and causes each victim’s unit to 
conduct one call to destination number B. 
The duration of each call is 20 seconds. 
In the first example, the attack at victim C can be 
detected by the frequency of the calls.  In the second 
example, the attack can be detected by the 
extraordinarily long duration of the calls. In the third 
example, the features used before cannot be used 
again. Figure 2 shows a depiction of example three 
with just two victims of an attacker calling a 
premium service number.

Figure 2.  Depiction of example three with two victims of an 
attacker calling a premium service. 
Existing methods often apply user profiling to 
detect suspicious behavior and potential attack or 
fraud cases. This way, distributed attacks, as 
described in the third example, cannot be detected. 
Therefore, it is necessary to apply a different 
method for detection. 
C. Characteristic traits for detection 
From the results of the preceding section, the 
following characteristic traits for detection can be 
deduced: 
• Duration of call for a certain user: The call 
duration is significantly higher in comparison 
with the known behavior of that user. 
• Number of calls for a certain user: The 
number of calls in a given time span is 
significantly higher in comparison with the 
known behavior of that user. 
• Number of calls for a certain destination 
number: The number of calls that have been 
conducted to a given (premium rate service) 
destination number in a given time span is 
suspicious. 
The first two of these characteristic traits can be 
detected by applying user profiling if the perspective 
of a single user is applied. To be able to detect 
attack attempts using the number of calls, a new 
method has to be devised. This will be described in 
Section VI. 
V. 
PREVIOUS BASIC USER PROFILING APPROACH 
The description and improved results of our 
previous user profiling approach will be provided in 
this section for completeness. The improvements to 
this concept are described in the sections of the new 
concepts following this section. 
A. Constructing user profiles 
For each user, two user profiles exist that 
represent the present and past behavior in specified 
time spans. The profile describing the past is called 
Past Behavior Profile (PBP), and the one describing 
the present is called Current Behavior Profile (CBP). 
Each profile uses features, calculated from CDR 
data, to describe the user behavior in its time span. 
Features 
Features describe different aspects of a user’s 
behavior. In the profiles, the feature vector shown in 
Table I was used: 
TABLE I.  
FEATURE VECTOR USED FOR USER PROFILES [7] 
Max 
Calls 
Max 
Duration 
Max 
Costs 
Mean 
Calls 
Mean 
Duration 
Std 
Calls 
Std 
Duration 
 
These are the maximum values (Max) for calls per 
hour (Calls), the duration of a call and the cost of a 
call, the mean value (Mean) and standard deviation 
(Std) for the same CDR information, except the cost. 
For those features, the start time, duration and 
cost information of a CDR are needed. The cost of a 
call is depending on the user agreement and is not 
given in a CDR. Therefore, an approximation of 
costs for a CDR was made, based on country code, 
number type (mobile or fixed-line) and duration. 
These features were used because they delivered 
the best results in [7]. Many works use standard 
deviation and mean values of the number of calls 
and the duration of a call to describe the user’s 
behavior. Some works also differentiate them into 
national, international or mobile [21] [7] [22]. 
Profile time span 
Each profile 𝑃𝑃 has a length 𝑙𝑙𝑃𝑃. The PBP 
additionally has an offset 𝑑𝑑 ≠ 0, describing the 
difference in time between the present and the PBP 
time span (see Figure 3). For a CDR to be included 
in a profile, it needs to meet the following rules (1) 
and (2) for the corresponding profile: 
 
𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 < 𝑇𝑇𝑛𝑛 − 𝑑𝑑 
(1) 
 
𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ≥ 𝑇𝑇𝑛𝑛 − (𝑙𝑙𝑃𝑃 + 𝑑𝑑)  
(2)

International Journal on Advances in Security, vol 8 no 1 & 2, year 2015, http://www.iariajournals.org/security/
2015, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
𝑇𝑇𝑛𝑛 is the present (𝑛𝑛) time, and 𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the time of the 
CDR. If a CDR meets these two rules, it is included 
in the features of the corresponding profile. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Profile time spans and offset (CBP = Current 
Behavior Profile; PBP = Past Behavior Profile). 
The length (time span) of the profiles and the 
offset are very important parameters for the 
detection. The longer a profile is, the more CDRs 
are represented inside a profile and the statistics 
have more accuracy and less fluctuations. At the 
same time, the effects of single fraudulent CDRs 
become statistically more irrelevant and thus harder 
to detect. The offset is important for finding 
fraudulent CDRs that can only be found in groups. It 
decides how long it takes for a yet undetected 
fraudulent CDR to be included in the PBP and 
therefore makes it more unlikely to be found. The 
length of the offset also affects fluctuations when 
comparing both profiles. A higher offset causes 
higher fluctuations, a lower offset causes lower 
fluctuations likewise. 
An optimal tradeoff between the length of the 
profiles and the offset between profiles needs to be 
found for best results. 
Filling profiles 
At first, the profiles need to get filled up for the 
method to be able to calculate meaningful features. 
Once the profile contains CDRs for its entire time 
span, the features can be calculated and used for 
further analysis. This means that the method has a 
determined training time for accumulating CDRs 
that is autonomously done without administration by 
personnel. In the following, a profile that has been 
filled up once is called ready. 
B. Measuring change in user behavior 
Once the profiles of a user are ready, the change 
of behavior measured by the profiles can be 
calculated. This is done by calculating the relative 
ratio 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 between each feature 𝐹𝐹 of both profiles 
(PBP and CBP) by (3): 
 
∀𝐹𝐹 ∶ 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 = 
⎩⎪⎨
⎪⎧ቆ1 − ቀ
𝐹𝐹𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃ቁቇ , 𝐹𝐹𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ≤ 𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
ቆ1 − ቀ
𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
𝐹𝐹𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃ቁቇ , 𝑒𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
 
(3) 
This results in a ratio 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 for each feature 𝐹𝐹, 
describing the change in behavior for that feature. 
Each 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 has a range of -1 to 1, with -1 as a 
maximum decrease and 1 as a maximum increase in 
behavior measured by that feature. 
A ratio 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 for a feature F gives a relative value 
to the past behavior. It is relative because the 
severity of a change in user behavior is always 
relative to the past behavior of the user. 
Empty profile 
In case of a user not having made calls for a time 
span greater than the span of all user-specific 
profiles, one of the profiles of a user can run empty. 
Once a profile is empty, the calculation of the 
features is not possible, because they attain a value 
of zero. Comparing a non-empty profile with an 
empty profile will result in infinite ratios for the 
features, allowing for detection of fraud where there 
is none (e.g., when the PBP is empty and the CBP is 
not empty). Instead of letting the profile run empty, 
the last CDR in a profile that is about to become 
empty is not removed. This prevents the features 
from getting zero values and keeps user-specific 
information for fraud detection. Setting the features 
to a standard value would disregard user-specific 
behavior and is therefore not done. 
Features accepting zero 
Features like standard deviation can attain a 
value of zero, even if the profile is not empty. For 
example, the standard deviation of the duration 
attains a value of zero, if all calls in the profile have 
the same duration. Like in an empty profile, zero 
values are a problem for calculating the ratios. 
Therefore, a value 𝜀𝜀 (depending on the range of the 
specific feature) is added to the affected feature in 
both profiles. 
C. Detecting fraud 
For this approach, fraud cases are to be 
distinguished by extreme changes in user behavior 
described by each feature. Thus, for each ratio 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 of 
a feature F, a limit 𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹 is introduced. Each ratio 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 is 
checked if its limit 𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹 is exceeded, and the number 
(n) of exceeded limits is checked against an 
additional limit 𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸 (𝐸𝐸 for exceedings). If the limit 
𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸 is exceeded, the CDR is labeled as fraudulent and 
as non-fraudulent otherwise. The procedure can be 
described as follows: 
 
1. Set 𝑛𝑛 ∶= 0 
2. ∀𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 ∈ 𝑅𝑅: (𝑅𝑅𝐹𝐹 > 𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹) → (𝑛𝑛 = 𝑛𝑛 + 1) 
3. 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟 = ൜ 𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑, 𝑛𝑛 > LE
 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑙, 𝑒𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
 
 
Once a CDR in the CBP is labeled as fraudulent, 
it is to be excluded from inclusion into the PBP. 
This prevents the PBP from including fraud cases 
and obscures potential follow-ups of fraudulent 
CDRs. This is the first approach chosen for a first 
experiment. Other approaches for detection using 
the ratios are discussed in future work. 
D. Unexpected fluctuations 
Many fluctuations in data and ratios, like 
weekends and holidays, can be predicted and 
adjusted for. But there are also fluctuations caused 
by random events inside the telecom service 
provider’s network, e.g., network, hardware or other 
failures.

Those fluctuations are hard to predict using user 
profiles. The idea is to use the relation between 
absolute and differential analysis. If it is a 
fluctuation caused by the specific user, the 
fluctuation is not seen in an absolute analysis. If the 
fluctuation is global, it will affect all users and will 
be seen for specific users, too. Therefore, the 
accumulated behavior of all users has to be 
measured to detect this kind of fluctuation.  
Because the functionality to measure user 
behavior has already been defined, it can be reused 
to measure the accumulated user behavior. A global 
version of a CBP and a PBP is needed for all users. 
Ratios are calculated the same way as in user 
profiles. In this case, the ratios are not used for fraud 
detection, because the source of the fraud cannot be 
detected by creating profiles for all users. The ratios 
are used to be included in the user-specific ratios for 
finding the global fluctuations and removing them 
from user fluctuations.  
The inverse ratios of the global profiles are taken 
to the power of g and are multiplied with the 
corresponding ratio of a specific user profile as in 
(4): 
 
𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑛𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 = (𝟏𝟏 − 𝑔𝑔𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛𝑔𝑔𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛)𝑔𝑔 ⋅ 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 
(4) 
An appropriate value for 𝑔𝑔 is determined in 
Section V.F. Both ratios have the same scaling and 
global ratio that describes the change for the user 
ratio that is still normal. Therefore, the inverse is 
multiplied by the user ratio. Because the global ratio 
is much more stable with more samples, it is taken 
to the power of 𝑔𝑔.𝑔𝑔 is dependent on the scaling of 
𝑔𝑔𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛𝑔𝑔𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 and not on 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛. 
E. Low usage users 
An analysis of the data revealed that on average, 
each user only makes 6-7 outgoing calls per day. 
About 47% of the users only conduct 2 calls per day 
on average. That means a lot of users — and 
therefore user profiles — include low amounts of 
calls. Hence, only few samples are available for 
calculating the statistics, making the statistics 
inaccurate. A way to handle those fluctuations is to 
scale the calculated ratios for the user by the number 
of samples inside the profiles. For the creation of a 
scaling function 𝑆𝑆(𝑥𝑥), the dependencies of the 
number of calls in the profiles and the ratios needed 
to be analyzed.  
Before and after scaling a ratio, it needs to be 
converted to linear space with (5). 
 
𝑆𝑆(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) = 1 −

𝑥𝑥 is the number of calls in the PBP, and 𝑦𝑦 is the 
ratio to be scaled. The part ቀ

ratio into linear space, and 1 −

to the previous space. A full overview of all 
components and their relationships is shown in

F. Results of the previous approach 
This section describes the test of a prototype 
implementation of our previous approach in an 
experiment. The implementation has been done in 
Java for an existing fraud detection framework of 
the research project. The data used for the 
experiment 
has 
been 
generated 
by 
a 
live 
environment, recorded by a VoIP switching device. 
The data consists of 76,326 cost impending calls and 
spans over a time of one month. It has been 
anonymized in accordance to the German Federal 
Law on Data Protection. 
For the experiment, the whole data set was used, 
as the system trains on live data with the assumption 
that fraud cases are rare enough so that the profiles 
can initially be trained by themselves without 
greater risks of being manipulated by fraud cases. 
Assuming the contrary is true and the first data set is 
containing fraudulent CDRs, the impact would only 
be that no fraud cases are detected until the 
fraudulent CDRs are no longer used for the PBP. 
For the experiment, profiles of a week’s length 
and with an offset (d) of one day for the PBP are 
used. In a first run, all occurring ratios are recorded 
to calculate limits for the ratios, to analyze the 
parameters for the scaling function and to integrate 
the global ratios into user profiles. In a second run, 
the limits were applied and the fraud detection 
component was enabled. 
First results 
For the first results, without incorporating the 
global profiles and the scaling function, the false 
positive rates (FPR) for different limits were 
measured. The false positive rate is a very important 
measure that indirectly determines the expenses due 
to inefficiency, because administrators need to look 
at false positives. 
Table II shows empirically tested limits for 
ratios and the number of exceedings. The FPR has 
been measured from 50,893 samples, where the 
profiles were ready. The limits and the resulting 
FPRs will be used for comparison with results of the

The

show 
additional 
information about other time spans for the profiles 
in comparison to already shown results.  
As seen in Table III and in Table IV, the results 
show that a profile’s length of one week with an 
offset of one day is more promising with much 
lower FPR than the other profile variants.

Global profiles 
For the global profiles, the same length and 
offset was used, because the ratios can be compared 
better if the parameters are similar. The number of 
calls was used as the only feature for the global 
profiles. For the parameter 𝑔𝑔 for scaling the global 
ratio, see (4), a test value of 1 was used. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Ratios for number of calls for the whole data in 
global profiles. 
Figure 5 shows the ratios measured for the given 
data, chronologically sorted. It shows negative ratios 
during the Christmas holidays in Germany, 
successfully measuring its effects on the ratios and it 
can be used to remove those effects from single user 
behavior. Also, this figure shows when the profiles 
became ready. 
The incorporation into profiles of a week’s 
length showed no significant improvements in the 
FPRs. 
 
 
Figure 6.  Example incorporation of global ratio into a day-
length user profile for feature MeanCalls. 
 On the other hand, a small scale test of profiles 
with a day’s length showed very good results in 
removing weekend fluctuations from the profiles. 
Figure 6 depicts an example for day-length profiles. 
The figure shows two curves, MeanCalls Normal 
showing the ratios of the feature MeanCalls without 
correction by global profiles and MeanCalls Global 
with correction by global profiles.   
Scaling for low usage 
To find an appropriate scaling function, the 
dependency of the number of calls to the maximum 
occurring ratios was analyzed. Figure 7 shows an 
example for four features. It depicts how a low 
number of samples/calls in a profile can affect the 
ratios. Therefore, a scaling function was created that 
scaled the ratios from 0 to 70 calls. 
 
 
Figure 7.  Example for the dependency of max values of the 
features MeanCalls, StdCalls, MeanDur and StdDur to the 
number of calls. 
 
Figure 8.  Depiction of the scaling function. 
For the scaling function, a simple parable of the 
form 𝑦𝑦 = (𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑥)2 + 𝑔𝑔 was chosen after testing 
different curves, because it corresponds well to the 
curve in Figure 7. Using the coefficients 𝑓𝑓 =
1
67.1  
and 𝑔𝑔 = 0.2, the scaling begins at 0.2 with 0 calls

and ends at 1 with about 70 calls with a slight 
increase, as shown in Figure 8. Because about 47% 
of users only conduct about two calls per day, the 
scaling function greatly improved the FPRs, as 
shown in Table V.

Determination of limits 
The best way to determine the limits is to 
optimize the ratio of true positive rate to false 
positive rate. However, this requires labeled data to 
be possible. Because of the lack of labeled data, the 
limits were determined by measuring the 99.5% 
quantile of all occurring ratios for each feature. The 
ratios are presented in Table VI. Using these limits, 
the measured FPR is 1.87%.

Final detection rates 
Out of the 50,893 analyzed cost impending calls, 
1.87% are measured as false positives. Through 
empirical inspection of the false positives, two users 
were found with an exceptionally strange behavior 
pattern. The duration of calls and the number of 
calls per second was the same in about 200 calls, 
which is very suspicious. After consultation with the 
providing telecom company, those calls were 
considered fraud cases. This shows that the 
presented approach can detect false positives and 
reduce the FPR to 1.22%, but does not provide a 
true positive rate for a decent comparison with 
related work. Still, 90.23% of the fraudulent calls 
found in these two users were marked as fraud by 
the proposed approach. Compared to the approach 
proposed in [24], which also proposes a statistical, 
unsupervised method, the approach of this paper has 
a lower FPR (1.22% to 4.0%). Compared to other 
supervised techniques, like [13] (with 50% TPR and 
0.3% FPR) or [22] (two approaches with 70% and 
80% TPR and 0% FPR for both), the proposed 
approach has a good TPR and FPR and needs no 
effort for preparing supervised training data. 
VI. 
NEW BASIC BEHAVIOR PROFILING CONCEPT 
In this section, a basic concept for behavior 
profiling is described, consisting of profiles, 
calculation of features for two different contexts and 
detection of anomalies in the profiles. The idea for 
this concept was derived from the previous concept 
described in Section V. The need for a new concept 
arose from the problems with low activity users and 
fluctuations described for the previous approach and 
its complexity, but also from the potentials for using 
this approach in a different context. In the following, 
a description of the new basic behavior profiling 
concept is given. 
A. Profiles 
A profile is a collection of historic data in the 
context of an object. Examples for objects are users 
or destinations. The historic data, for this work, 
consists of call information. A profile 𝑃𝑃 holds the 
information that occurred in a time span with the 
length 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 with an relative offset 𝑃𝑃𝑂𝑂 to the present 
time 𝑝𝑝. 
To determine if data with a given timestamp 𝑟𝑟 is 
inside the time span of a given profile 𝑃𝑃, the 
following rules are applied: 
 
𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑛𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑒 = ൜𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒, 𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓 (𝑝𝑝 − 𝑃𝑃𝑂𝑂 − 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿) < 𝑟𝑟 < (𝑝𝑝 − 𝑃𝑃𝑂𝑂)
𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒, 𝑒𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
 
(6) 
If data is inside a profile’s time span, it is used to 
calculate features that describe the behavior of an 
object in that time span. Profiles that describe the 
behavior of the present will be called Current 
Behavior Profile (CBP) and profiles describing past 
behavior will be called Past Behavior Profile (PBP). 
B. User profiling 
As mentioned in the introduction, we introduce 
two contexts based on previous work. The first 
context, as it is common for the related work, is the 
user’s 
context. The 
second 
context 
is 
the 
destinations context. 
For the user context, the outgoing call behavior 
of the user is analyzed to find deviations from the 
normal or present user behavior to the past behavior. 
These deviations or anomalies are used to detect 
fraud.  
The new approach has not as much problems to 
be considered as the old approach. The idea of 
global user profiling from the old approach for 
global fluctuations in user behavior, e.g., due to 
seasonal reasons, got adapted to the new approach 
and is described in the following subsections. 
 
Features and profiles 
The most used features for describing past user 
behavior used in related work are statistics over the 
amount of calls and the duration of each call a user 
makes, e.g., in [5] [7] [20]. Therefore, the standard 
deviation and the arithmetical average of the call 
amount and the duration of calls are used in this 
work.  
In contrast to the previous approach, the maxima 
are not used in this concept, because an analysis 

9
International Journal on Advances in Security, vol 8 no 1 & 2, year 2015, http://www.iariajournals.org/security/
2015, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
showed weak influence in detection by these 
features. 
The statistics for the duration will be calculated 
on per call basis and the statistics for the call amount 
on a per hour basis. 
Table VII shows the used feature vector for 
describing the past behavior. Mean stands for 
arithmetical average, Std for standard deviation, 
DpC for Duration per Call, and CpH for Calls per 
Hour. 
TABLE VII.  
FEATURE VECTOR USED FOR DESCRIBING PAST 
USER BEHAVIOR 
MeanCpH 
StdCpH 
MeanDpC 
StdDpC 
 
From the CDRs, both the timestamp of the call 
connect and the duration are needed for calculating 
the features. 
For the present user behavior, only the call 
amount and the average duration for the latest hour 
are used as features, resulting in the following 
feature vector described in Table VIII. 
TABLE VIII.  FEATURE VECTOR USED FOR DESCRIBING 
PRESENT USER BEHAVIOR 
MeanCpH 
MeanDpC 
 
The CBP has a length 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 of one hour and no 
offset. Therefore, MeanCpH stands for the number 
of calls in the profile. The PBP has an offset 𝑃𝑃𝑂𝑂 of 
one hour, due to the length of the CBP, and will 
have a length of one week as discussed in Section 
V.A and shown with good results in Section V.F. 
 
Detection 
The detection of fraud is done by comparing the 
PBP with the CBP features. For this, we calculate a 
limit for the mean duration and number of calls of 
the CBP. The limit is calculated as described in (7): 
 
𝐿𝐿𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑟𝑟 =  𝑀𝑀𝑒𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛 + 𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑 ∗ 𝑟𝑟 + 𝑓𝑓    
(7) 
𝑓𝑓 is an additional absolute part that removes the 
need to handle users with low amount of calls and 
empty profiles. It needs to be small enough for not 
affecting users with a high call count and still 
protect users with a low call count from unnecessary 
fraud alerts. The techniques for these cases 
described and used in the previous work are 
therefore no longer needed. The Mean and Std part 
scales with the amount of calls the user does and is 
therefore a scaling for users with a higher amount of 
calls. The additional scaling 𝑟𝑟 is for adjustment of 
the relative part. 
 
Adaption of global user profiling 
In the previous approach, we used a global user 
profiling for analysis of fluctuations in the data like: 
• Holidays 
• Seasonal fluctuations 
• Weekly fluctuations (weekends) 
• Daily fluctuations (work/after work) 
• Unexpected fluctuation (network problems) 
We used global user profiling with the 
assumption that the whole user base as a single 
entity provides stable enough statistics that show the 
global fluctuations but not the single user’s 
fluctuations. This also requires that a single user 
does not make more calls than all other users 
together.  
In this concept, because of the profiles’ length of 
one week, we only want to look at holidays, 
seasonal fluctuations and unexpected fluctuations, 
e.g., caused by network failures. The other 
fluctuations get evened out by the statistics over one 
week. 
In contrast to the previous approach, we will also 
use the user profiling provided in this concept for 
global user profiling. This will make it easier for 
changes in the global user profiling to be factored in 
the individual user’s profiling. 
For the PBP and CBP, the same lengths and 
features are used as for user profiling.  
We measure ratios 𝑅𝑅 for each feature 𝐹𝐹 between 
the CBPs and PBPs. The ratio is calculated by 
dividing a feature of the CBP with the respective 
sum of the mean and standard deviation feature. 
The ratios must then be applied to the detection 
of a single user’s profiling. The relative part of the 
limit formula (8) is adjusted by the respective ratio: 
 
𝐿𝐿𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑟𝑟 = (𝑀𝑀𝑒𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛 + 𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑 ∗ 𝑟𝑟) ∗ 𝑅𝑅 + 𝑓𝑓    
(8) 
C. First Results 
A first analysis in “normal” data showed for 
single users that the limit is appropriately high 
enough. This was enabled by the incorporation of 
the global ratio. Figure 9 shows the difference 
between normal ratio of a single user and his ratio 
adjusted with the global ratio for the MeanCpH 
limit. The figure shows the information of increased 
activity during working hours that is normally lost in 
the user’s profile due to the smoothing of the 
statistics over one week. This confirms that we can 
successfully reinsert an approximation of this 
information via the global ratio. 
 
 
Figure 9.  Depiction of the difference in limits with 
incorporation of global ratio for the MeanCpH limit. 
This shows that the new approach is much 
simpler than the old one, but still handles the 
problems of the previous approach and promises 
good results for detection rates (false positive rate 
and true positive rate). 
An extensive analysis over prepared and labeled 
data for acquiring detection rates of this new user 
profiling approach is still required.

VII. DESTINATION PROFILING 
After the FRITZ!Box attacks happened, as 
described in Section IV, the previous approach was 
applied to a data set containing the attacks. The 
previous approach could not detect the FRITZ!Box 
attacks because the context of the profiling was that 
of a single user and not of a destination. Attacks on 
a single destination distributed over many users 
could therefore not be seen by user profiling, 
because of the relatively small effects on the single 
user’s profile. This led to the idea of using a 
different context for profiling and detection of 
distributed attacks on single destinations, as we call 
it Destination Profiling. 
In another previous work [2], Destination 
Profiling was then implemented and good results 
were generated for detecting this kind of attacks. 
The results are shown in Section VII.B after the 
description of the approach for detection is given in 
the following paragraphs.  
Because of the good results in the previous work 
with profiling the number of distinct users calling a 
single destination in a defined time span [2], the 
approach is improved by adding distinct callers as a 
feature for the Destination Profiling. After the 
results of the previous work are shown, the new 
results with the improvement are shown and 
compared to the previous results. 
A. Features, profiles and detection 
For Destination Profiling, the same methods as 
for the User Profiling are not only reused, but 
adjusted. The duration of a call is not representative 
for a destination, because different callers have 
different behaviors. Only the number of calls, that is 
not per call basis, and the number of distinct callers 
can give important information about fraudulent 
usage of the destination.  
Only the number of distinct callers can be used, 
because the number of non-distinct users will lead to 
the same result as with user profiling. If only one 
caller is doing a high amount of calls, this can also 
be detected with user profiling, as there is only one 
user context doing the calls.

Figure 10.  Destination Profiling: Depiction of the current

For the PBP, the mean and std for calls per hour 
and callers per hour are used. For the CBP, the 
number of calls and the number of distinct callers 
are used. The profile parameters and the detection 
are the same as for User Profiling. Figure 10 depicts 
the profiles. 
B. Previous prototype 
In this section, results from a prototype 
implementation 
of 
the 
previous 
Destination 
Profiling approach are described and analyzed 
empirically.  
Used Data Set 
To evaluate the prototype implementation, real 
life traffic data (CDRs) provided by a local telecom 
company has been used. The data comprises calls 
from a time span of two weeks containing about 3.5 
million calls. Only the portion of the data with 
outgoing calls was used, because incoming calls are 
not relevant to the analysis. The outgoing calls 
amount to about 470,000. Table IX shows the 
distribution of the calls for the regions national, 
mobile and international and are split into 
connected and unconnected calls.

In the first week, no attack attempts (fraud) 
were contained. This part of the data was applied to 
initialize the behavior profiles, building the 
features. In the second week, normal call traffic is 
contained, as well as about 20,140 fraudulent calls 
following the typical FRITZ!Box attack pattern. 
The second week has been used to test the detection 
abilities. 
Experimental Setup 
First of all, the relevant thresholds had to be 
determined, because this is a necessity for high-
quality detection results. To accomplish this, a 
single run of the method, without the fraud 
detection, is conducted with the first week of the 
data and every feature value at the time of each call 
is recorded. The thresholds are estimated by 
analyzing the resulting values of the CBP for fraud 
and non-fraud cases and for each region (national, 
mobile, international). The 99%-quantiles of the 
number of calls from the CBP, for connected and 
unconnected calls, as well as national, international 
and mobile calls each, have been recorded and used 
as the absolute threshold 𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅for each region. The 
parameter 𝐺𝐺𝑅𝑅, representing the relative threshold, 
has been set to 𝐺𝐺𝑅𝑅 = 1, for testing purposes. 
Finally, a test run with the activated fraud 
detection and the previously measured thresholds is 
done and the detection quality is evaluated by 

11

2015, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
comparing the detected cases to the known cases of 
fraudulent behavior.  
The approach can be described with the 
following steps: 
1. The detection method is deactivated at first 
2. The profiles are initialized using the data set 
of the first week 
3. Thresholds are calculated from CBP values as 
described before 
4. The detection method is now activated 
5. The data set of the second week is now used 
as input 
6. The results from the detection method are 
compared to the known cases of fraudulent 
behavior 
Detection results 
Thresholds 
have 
been 
determined 
for 
successfully connected, as well as unconnected call 
attempts, each for national, international and mobile 
calls. Also, the profile values have been calculated 
and recorded. 
The arithmetic mean and the standard deviation 
both represent valid values to generate relative 
thresholds. An adjustment with the parameter 𝐺𝐺𝑅𝑅 is 
only necessary in individual cases.  
Under these testing conditions, the detection 
method achieved a false positive rate of 0.7% or 
3,355 false positives (see Table X). Of the known 
attacks in the data, the detection method was able to 
identify all attacks, resulting in 100% detection rate 
or true positive rate. However, there is the 
possibility that not all attacks are detected because 
some may still be unknown to the provider of the 
data. An estimation of a true positive rate of about 
95% would be more appropriate.

Compared to the results achieved in comparable 
related work (see Table XI), which utilizes 
unsupervised user profiling, with a FPR of 4% and a 
TPR of 75% [6] and our previous user profiling 
approach with a FPR of 1.22% and a TPR of 
approximately 
90% 
(see 
Section 
V), 
these 
measurements are as good or even better.

On the other hand, no direct comparison is 
possible, because the detection method itself is 
partially different, applying a modified approach of 
user profiling.  
Improved prototype 
The addition of the number of distinct users as a 
feature to the profiling allowed the reduction of the 
limit for number of calls while maintaining the true 
positive rate. This also affected the false positive 
rate and reduced it by 0.2%, resulting to a FPR of 
0.5%. 
VIII. CONCEPT OF COMMUNICATION BEHAVIOR 
PATTERNS 
The concept of communication behavior patterns 
in one of the intermediate works [3] was developed 
based on the analysis of the FRITZ!Box incident 
and experiences with user profiling from the 
previous work. It differs in the point of view from 
the concept of Destination Profiling [2], utilizes 
pieces of information from user profiles and adapts 
the principle of clustering algorithms (unsupervised 
learning) [25], which is used to find similarities 
between objects. 
Behavior patterns are created in order to reflect a 
behavior of a user in a specific context. To 
associate with a behavior pattern, each shall have its 
own criteria, where similar patterns possess similar 
criteria. In order to describe the behavior 
concerning a distinct aspect of a user or a group of 
users, the calls of a user profile are matched against 
predefined behavior patterns. A user is able to have 
matches to several behavior patterns.  
To search for behavior patterns using user 
profiles as objects and to obtain an indication for 
thresholds, clustering algorithms implemented in 
WEKA [26] were used. Used algorithms were k-
means, EM and an implementation of a SOM (self-
organizing map) as a clustering algorithm.  
 
 
Figure 11.  Overview of the relations between the components.  
Figure 11 shows an overview of the relations 
between the components of the concept of behavior 
patterns. For every user, a user profile gets 
constructed. Each user profile consists of prepared 
data retrieved from CDRs, as well as a feature 
vector, which are defining criteria for behavior 
patterns. Clustering algorithms providing pieces of 
information for behavior patterns are used offline, 
as the gathered information has to be evaluated, as 
well as they potentially slow down the whole 
classification process. At last, using a user’s 
behavior patterns and the belonging matching

information, a call can be classified as fraudulent or 
non-fraudulent.  
A. Data preparation for user profiling 
The concept of behavior patterns utilizes 
information retrieved from user profiles. The 
attributes 𝐴𝐴1 to 𝐴𝐴4 are extracted from a CDR for a 
user profile:  
𝐴𝐴1 User ID 
𝐴𝐴2  Timestamp of the call 
𝐴𝐴3  Duration of the call 
𝐴𝐴4  Destination number 
The first attribute is used for a unique 
identification of a user. 𝐴𝐴2 is used to obtain 
information whether the call occurred on a weekend 
and if the call has been made during work hours 
(7:00 am to 18:59 pm) or after hours (19:00 pm to 
6:59 am) with a time span of 12 hours each.  
𝐴𝐴3 is used to know whether the call was a call 
attempt or call connect. The information obtained 
from 𝐴𝐴4 is further categorized into its call region 
national, mobile and international.  
B. Behavior patterns 
A behavior pattern reflects a behavior in a 
specific context of a user. An example is the 
behavior pattern “International Calls” to which a 
user gets assigned if he conducts calls to 
international destinations often. It is possible for a 
user to match one or more behavior patterns. 
Features 
Every behavior pattern has its own defining set 
of features F called feature vector, with comparable 
behavior patterns having similar defining features. 
These features are highly dependable on the criteria 
of a behavior pattern. Therefore, providing an 
overall definition for a feature vector is not possible. 
The features are derived from the data contained in a 
user profile and are grouped in two types, numeric 
and Boolean (true/false).  
Examples for two behavior patterns, their criteria 
and therefore feature vectors are: 
• “International Calls After Hours”: The criteria 
for this pattern are: The call has to be 
connected, the call region is international and 
the call is made after hours. 
• “Weekend Calls”: The only criterion is for the 
calls to be made on a weekend.    
The numerical value is the accumulation of the 
respective calls during a time span 𝑟𝑟𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 (in this case, 
one hour), which applies for both behavior patterns. 
Criteria for a behavior pattern match 
For a match to a behavior pattern, every feature 
of a feature vector, depending on its type, has to 
meet its criteria: 
• Numeric: A statistical or numeric feature has 
to pass a threshold. 
• Boolean: A Boolean feature has to have the 
value true.  
For every defined behavior pattern, the criteria 
are tested. This way, it is possible for a CDR of a 
user to lead to a match to more than one behavior 
patterns.  
Metric for a match 
All calls matching a distinct behavior pattern are 
stored in respective lists. Over time, the length of 
such a list (grade of a match) can diminish or grow, 
being further denoted as a growth of a match to a 
behavior pattern.  
The growth G of a match to a behavior pattern 
over a time span is measured as:  
 
𝐺𝐺 = 
𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿
𝑥𝑥̅ (𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃)   
(9) 
𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿 denotes a list of all connected calls during the 
current (latest) hour and 𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃 a list of all connected 
calls in the past. For both 𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿 and 𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃, calls from the 
list of matches are used. 𝑥𝑥̅ denotes the arithmetic 
mean over the respective list. 
Change of a match 
The growth G of a match to a behavior pattern 
described above is further used as a criterion to 
mark a current call as fraudulent, as it is defined in 
the following case differentiation: 
 
𝐹𝐹𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑 = ൜ 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒, 𝐺𝐺 > 𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 
𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒, 𝑛𝑛𝑟𝑟ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒  
(10) 
𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 denotes a threshold for the growth of a 
match to a behavior pattern. If 𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 is passed, the 
current call, which had been causal for passing the 
threshold, is the first call to be considered 
fraudulent. All subsequent calls, which are still 
triggering true, are considered fraudulent as well. To 
regulate how much a growth of a match influences 
the assignment of a call as fraudulent, each behavior 
pattern has been given a weight, leading to an 
enhancement of the case differentiation shown in 
(10) to (11): 
 
𝐹𝐹𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑 = ൜𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒, 𝐺𝐺 ⋅ 𝑛𝑛 > 𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒, 𝑛𝑛𝑟𝑟ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒  
(11) 
C. Prototype 
Used data 
In case of the prototypical implementation of the 
concept of behavior patterns, real life traffic data 
over a time span of seven weeks provided by a local 
telecom company has been used. The first week has 
been used for the initialization phase, where user 
profiles, as well as behavior patterns of a user, are 
constructed, as this week did not contain known 
fraudulent activity. Out of the seven weeks, there is 
at least one week included with definite fraud 
attacks having the pattern described in Section IV. 
The rest of the data shows partial signs of the 
FRITZ!Box fraud attack pattern as well. The data 
set comprises 10,401,547 CDRs. As only outgoing 
calls, as well as successfully connected calls (call 
connects) are of importance, 2,749,860 CDRs were 
left.  
Experimental setup 
Two simple behavior patterns have been 
defined: 
• IntCallsPattern: All connected calls having an 
international destination match the behavior 
pattern. 
• IntCallsAfterHoursPattern: All connected calls 
having an international destination and having 

13

been conducted in the after hours match this 
behavior pattern. 
The thresholds for the statistical features for 
both behavior patterns, as well as indications about 
the thresholds concerning the change of a match to 
a behavior pattern have been derived using 
clustering algorithms from WEKA. The applied 
clustering algorithms were k-means, EM and an 
implementation of a SOM as a clustering algorithm. 
For the prototypical implementation, the behavior 
patterns possess parameters, which can be defined 
via a XML configuration. Table XII shows the 
definition of both behavior patterns, including the 
parameters. The parameter type of pattern defines 
whether the behavior pattern checks for the number 
of calls (calls) or for the sum of duration (duration). 
The possible values for each parameter after “type 
of pattern” are: 
• call type (all / call attempts / call connects), 
• destination (all/national/international/mobile), 
• timeslot (all / workhour / after hour) and 
• weekday (all / workday / weekend) 
If no further distinction is made, a parameter 
gets initialized with all.

Results 
An approximation concerning the TPR was 
possible due to the analysis performed on the data 
retrieved during the FRITZ!Box incident. It is 
highly possible that not all fraudulent data has been 
known during the evaluation of the prototype. The 
following steps have been applied on the data set:  
1. Apply the thresholds and weight values 
retrieved from clustering algorithms and 
given from experience, respectively. 
2. Run the prototype with the defined two 
behavior patterns. 
3. Analyze the results utilizing the knowledge 
derived from the analysis of the data, as 
well as from the local telecom company. 
In total, 17,110 fraud cases were reported and 
analyzed. During the analysis, one customer was 
noticeable in his behavior to conduct calls to 
foreign destinations very often, even not during the 
timeframe of the FRITZ!Box incident. Due to these 
findings, as well as other aspects found in our 
analysis, the aforementioned customer can be 
considered being a call center. As such customers 
are likely to be added to a whitelist, all calls 
belonging to such a customer can be ignored, which 
leads to a total of 13,503 reported fraud cases. A 
TPR of 98.4% and a FPR of below 0.01 % have 
been measured. At this point, it has to be said that 
surely not all fraud instances of the FRITZ!Box 
incident could be found. This can be said even 
though not enough labeled data existed, as valuable 
time – and therefore, CDRs – passes in order for a 
user to match a behavior pattern and be associated 
with the described behavior. Additionally, a 
threshold concerning the growth of a match has to 
be passed, resulting in an equivalent to a “settling-
in phase”. Thus, it is possible that not all fraudulent 
instances were detected.  
IX. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper presents an already simple statistical 
way of detecting fraud in telephony by analyzing 
user behavior and finding anomalies. It has flaws 
concerning the complexity, because of problems 
with special cases of users and fluctuations. These 
problems and the need for a technique for detecting 
the FRITZ!Box attacks led to three new techniques. 
With the new user profiling concept, the 
complexity of the previous approach is reduced and 
the problems of it are handled, by combining the 
global profiling with a different statistical approach. 
The effect of the global profiling is shown for a 
single user. Still, more features are needed to 
describe user behavior as it is shown in related 
work. 
The FRITZ!Box attacks led to an adaption of  
the new user profiling approach to a new context for 
enabling the detection of these attacks, called 
Destination Profiling. Destination Profiling allows 
to detect attacks on a single destination from 
multiple sources. The developed approach shows 
promising detection rates and was improved with 
small changes in this paper. 
The concept of behavior patterns utilizes the 
grouping aspect of clustering algorithms, leading to 
behavior pattern recognition using information 
retrieved from user profiles. Pieces of information 
from a user profile are matched against predefined 
behavior patterns, which depict the behavior of a 
user in a specific context. A match to a behavior 
pattern can grow and if a significant growth in a 
short time frame has been observed, a call is 
considered fraudulent.   
Overall, the three new approaches that were 
derived from our previous work show promising 
results for a combined detection in an online 
analysis tool. 
X. 
FUTURE WORK 
The most important future work is an extensive 
analysis of all new approaches presented in this 
work. The analysis needs to be done on a large 
enough prepared and labeled data set. A very 
important task of this analysis is to find correlations 
between the approaches to create an optimized 
combined detection result.

In particular, the new user profiling approach 
needs more features for the description of user 
behavior. Features used in related work need to be 
further analyzed and adapted to this approach. The 
incorporation of the global profiling needs to be 
fine-tuned as well. 
As there is little related work for destination 
profiling, a more detailed analysis of possible new 
features for the presented approach needs to be 
done. 
The behavior pattern recognition only covers a 
little amount of possible user groups. The authors 
see a huge potential in finding new user groups and 
analyzing them for finding new approaches for fraud 
detection. Including information given by call 
attempts and call termination cause codes can 
further improve the detection result. They can 
provide insight whether a fraudulent attack is 
currently prepared or conducted. Additionally, 
“normal” behavior patterns - e.g., “National Calls” - 
have to be considered as well, as they can provide 
further indications on a sudden change in a user’s 
behavior.
