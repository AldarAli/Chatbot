Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used as a
synonym for nearly every connected device. This makes it really
difﬁcult to ﬁnd the right kind of scientiﬁc publication for the
intended category of IoT. Conferences and other events for
IoT are confusing about the target group (consumer, enterprise,
industrial, etc.) and standardisation organisations suffer from
the same problem. To demonstrate these problems, this paper
shows the results of an analyses over IoT publications in different
research libraries. The number of results for IoT, consumer,
enterprise and industrial search queries were evaluated and a
manual study about 100 publications was done. According to
the research library or search engine, different results about
the distribution of consumer-, enterprise- and industrial- IoT
are visible. The comparison with the results of the manual
evaluation shows that some search queries do not show all desired
publications or that considerably more, unwanted results are
returned. Most researchers do not use the keywords right and
the exact category of IoT can only be accessed via the abstract.
This shows major problems with the use of the term IoT and its
minor limitations.
Keywords–Internet of Things; IoT; publications; consumer;
industrial; enterprise; categorization.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The Internet of Things is deﬁned in ISO/IEC 20924:2018
page 9 as “[...] infrastructure of interconnected entities, people,
systems and information resources together with services,
which processes and reacts to information from the physical
world and virtual world.” [1] This deﬁnition is very broad
and includes all possible devices that are connected to other
devices via a network (not necessarily the Internet), like smart-
phones, personal computers, connected vehicles, airplanes,
smart grid components, smart home devices, connected envi-
ronment sensors, eHealth hardware, wearables and many more.
The ISO/IEC deﬁnition is not the only one using this range of
devices, also researchers are using IoT to describe all kind of
products and prototypes. This leads to difﬁcult situations where
conferences or other events focus on IoT and the attendees do
not know if the presentations are in their ﬁeld of interest.
Searching for IoT scientiﬁc publications can be difﬁcult as
well. With only IoT, a too wide range of topics are returned.
Restrictions, such as “consumer” or “enterprise” can help,
but a lot of researchers do not use it. For example, the
publication “Smart Charger Based on IoT Concept” [2] is
about a consumer product, but the title and the keywords
(Smart Charger, Arduino, Phone Charger, Battery Charger)
are only containing “IoT” and “Smart Charger”. A search for
“IoT” and “consumer” will not include the publication.
In this study, we want to show the different problems of
IoT as a general term. We start with some related work in
Section II and the ﬁrst part of research (Section III) consists of
the different numbers of IoT publications in selected research
libraries. The second part (Section IV) shows the results of
a manual review of 100 publications according to their IoT
category. In Section V, the results were then compared and
evaluated to show the problems with the term IoT in research.
At the end, a short conclusion and our future work are given
in Section VII.
II.
RELATED WORK
There is no recent study about current research on IoT pub-
lications, which includes the different categories “consumer”,
“industrial” and “enterprise”. Some publications, like a study
from Mishra et.al. [3] are covering the years from 2000 to
2015 or another study about the IoT trends reaches from 1992
to 2015 [4].
Some newer bibliometric studies from 2019 and 2020 are
restricted to Blockchain [5] or Industrial 4.0 [6]. They are both
showing the increasing amount of IoT publications, but no
current overview of the whole situation of the last two years.
This study was inspired by the approach of the publications
mentioned above, although the focus is different. The used
academic search libraries differ in many point. For example,
the target group and the type of search are different. IEEE
Xplore targets technical publications, while Google Scholar
and Semantic Scholar are universal. A 2018 paper examined
the sizes of different libraries and identiﬁed Google Scholar as
the largest [7]. Semantic Scholar, on the other hand, uses an
algorithm that is based on artiﬁcial intelligence and is therefore
supposed to provide very precise results [8]. In the course of
this paper, the differences with respect to IoT will become
clear again.

IOT PUBLICATIONS IN RESEARCH LIBRARIES
The aim of this study is to ﬁnd out whether it is possible
to ﬁnd publications on speciﬁc areas of IoT without getting
too many results and limit the great diversity of IoT, but also

without overlooking relevant publications. For this goal, we
started with “IoT” as a search query in our manual study
(Section IV) and after analysing the publications, we came up
with three categories “industrial”, “consumer”, “enterprise”, as
most of the devices can be classiﬁed into these (see Table III).
To ﬁnd research about used encryption methods in con-
sumer IoT devices, for example, the ﬁrst search approach
would be “consumer IoT encryption”. However, some re-
searcher are not restrict their publications about encryption
and just use the term IoT. The previous query will not ﬁnd
this work. If we just use “IoT encryption”, there are too many
results (compared to the restricted). Research about encryption
in vehicles, industrial environment, etc. are included as well.
To prove this statement we started with different research
libraries and different queries and collected the numbers of
results.
Overall, six libraries / search engines were used:
•
Springer Link
•
IEEE Xplore
•
ScienceDirect
•
ACM digital library
•
Google Scholar
•
Semantic Scholar
These libraries / search engines are the most common ones
and widely used in computer science. Because of their different
search algorithms (as seen in the results), data from all of
them are shown. For example, IEEE Xplore ﬁnds a lot of
results for “IoT” alone, but not much with “IoT” and other
words combined. The words are all combined the same way
over all search engines with the “AND” operator to ﬁnd only
publications with both words in it (e.g., “IoT AND consumer”).
The search was done with some word combinations to
investigate the different areas of IoT. However, only a few
words yielded many results. A precise search for a speciﬁc
area is thus very well possible (e.g., automotive), as can be
seen in Table I. However, the abbreviation IIoT for industrial
IoT is not very common. All the results in this paper are only
with new publications from the years 2019 and 2020, to show
a current overview of the research in the ﬁeld of IoT.
To get a better separation, for example of the whole 44,800
IoT results of Google Scholar, we used the three search terms
in addition to “IoT”: “industrial”, “consumer” and “enterprise”.
The results are shown in Table II. In our example from Google
Scholar, we get about 45.5 % for “industrial”, 38.2 % for
“consumer” and 31.7 % for “enterprise”. The sum is over 100
% because some of the publications can include more than one
of them. This shows (in the case of Google Scholar) a good
idea of how to ﬁnd the right IoT category for a research (see
Table II).
IV.
IOT PUBLICATIONS STUDY
Because of the big differences in the search results and
therefore in the search type, we made a manual study with
100 publications about their category of IoT. We want to know
exactly, which publication belongs to industrial, consumer,
enterprise or is not related to IoT at all. For this study, we
needed 100 full publications most random as possible. Because
we do not know the algorithms behind the different search
engines, we decided to use Semantic Scholar with the option
“has PDF”. This adds a bit randomness and makes it easier to
get the full text. All the search parameters are:
•
Keyword: iot
•
Language: english
•
Publication date: 2019 and 2020
•
Option: ”has PDF”
•
Sort by Relevance
This search leads to 11,800 results. We downloaded the ﬁrst
100 publications [2], [9]–[107] and determined the categories.
For a better evaluation of the results, it was also noted whether
the category of the IoT devices in the publication can already
be identiﬁed in the title, the abstract or only in the text.
Additionally, it was evaluated whether the category can already
be extracted from the keywords.
Table III shows the result of the manual review. First, the
total number of publications. Not speciﬁed publications are

referring to IoT in general. For example, the publication about
“Security on IoT Devices with Secure Elements” [30] can be
applied to consumer, enterprise and industrial IoT devices. The
category ”consumer” consists of devices, which are meant
to be used by consumers, not professional people. “Enter-
prise” describes the category for devices used by companies
or installed / assembled by a professional service. The last
category “industrial” are IoT devices for production. Overall,
the different areas for each category were assigned as follows:
Consumer
•
Smart Home devices
•
Wearables
•
Connected home automation and alarm systems
Enterprise
•
Smart city devices
•
Environment sensors (for big buildings or ﬁelds)
•
Medical devices
•
Vehicles (transportation)
•
Sensors for bigger buildings
•
Alarm systems (for business)
Industrial
•
Machine sensors
•
Machine control systems
•
Industrial sensors
•
Industrial devices with network connection
The lists above are not exhaustive. Medical and transporta-
tion devices can be used by consumer, but they have to be
installed by a professional. Therefore, they are assigned to
enterprise.
The remaining columns in Table III are showing the
difﬁculty of assigning the publications to the categories. If the
category can be be determined by the title, the publication is
added to column t. If it is only in part possible, it is added to
column (t). For example, the title “IoT based home automation
using Raspberry Pi” [23] is clearly for consumer, because
home automation is one of the consumer parts. In this case the
publications is added to column t. Another title “IoT-Enabled
Door Lock System” [28] is not clear, because a door lock
system can be for the smart home market or just for business
buildings. In this case the publication is added to column (t)
as the product is in the title, but the main category can only be
recognized in the abstract. Therefore, the publication is added
to column a as well. The procedure is the same for the columns
a and (a). If it is not possible to recognize the category from
the title or abstract at all, the publication is added to the text
column. If the category is already determined by the title, it
will not be counted to the abstract or text, but it can be added
to the keywords.
There are only 9 publications in the keywords column,
because only clear keywords like “industrial” count. If the

they do not count.
There are 30 publications for IoT in general, 22 for
consumer devices, 33 for enterprise, 14 for industrial and
one publication, which is not related to IoT, but has some
serial number with iot in the title. Most of the time, the
publications for enterprise can be categorized with the title
alone, 10 directly and 15 not clearly with related words.
Overall, the most publications can be categorized without
reading the whole text (but not without reading the abstract), in
only 15 cases, further reading is needed. The keywords usage
is not good, as only 9 are clearly categorizeable.

RESULTS
All results are from the previous research in early April
2020 as described in Sections III and IV. Figure 1 shows
the percentage of the different categories according to the
search results for only the term ”IoT” in the different research
libraries, compared with the manual study.
In the manual study, about 65 percent of all publications
can be categorized. Semantic Scholar and Springer Link are
near to this number with 58 and 77 percent. But with different
weightings of the categories. This may be due to the limited
number of samples in the manual study of 100.
IEEE Xplore shows a signiﬁcantly lower number of results
if the search term is expanded with the categories. This is due
to the search method of IEEE Xplore, since only the metadata
(title, abstract and keywords) are searched by default. This
procedure has advantages and disadvantages, as will be shown
in Section VI.
The other three libraries, ScienceDirect, ACM digital li-
brary and Google Scholar are over 82 percent (Google with

Figure 2. Result of the manual publications study
115 percent even over 100). This is the case, because some
publications containing more than one of the three search
words. This is useful, because general publications about IoT
are still included in the restricted search queries, but for
example, Google Scholar ﬁnds a lot of publications with “iot
AND consumer” which are not consumer related. The high
number of search results is because of the comprehensive
search method. Even text inside the publication is found. For
example, the two search results are in the ﬁrst 100 results
from google (search term: “iot AND consumer”): “A review of
Internet of Things (IoT) embedded sustainable supply chain for
industry 4.0 requirements” [108] and “Beyond IoT Business”
[109].
A big difference in all libraries are the weights between
the categories. For example, the technical library IEEE Xplore
has more industrial publications as a percentage than all the
others. This should be considered by a search for only one
category.
The results of the manual study from Section IV are shown
in Figure 2. This ﬁgure shows the difﬁculty by categorizing
IoT research. Only 17 publications can clearly be assigned with
the title and 15 of them only via the text. The keywords are
often not used and only useful in 9 cases. The different search
approach from IEEE Xplore can only ﬁnd results from column
t and a, but most of the time, there is not a clear “consumer” or
“industrial” in the title or the abstract and the library can not
include the publication. Some assignments can only be done
if, for example, it is possible to relate smart home to consumer.
Only with the results from Figure 1, it seems that IoT can
be clearly delimited to the three categories (Google Scholar
with over 100 percent together in all 3 categories). However,
the manual study shows that there is research in IoT that is
suitable for all areas (“not speciﬁc” in ﬁgure 2). But it is
not easy to ﬁnd the research that is relevant for your own
ﬁeld. Depending on the research library, different numbers
of results are found and the weighting of the categories also
varies greatly. The search for publications in the ﬁeld of IoT
is therefore associated with many problems, which will be
described in more detail in Section VI.
VI.
PROBLEMS
Since IoT is a comprehensive term, some problems arise
when searching for scientiﬁc publications. Some of them are
described in more detail in this section on the basis of the
previous study.
We use the same example from Section III: searching for
an encryption method for consumer IoT devices, like a smart
home sensor. If we use “IoT AND consumer AND encryption”,
we get a lower number of search results, but missing general
IoT solutions for encryption, which do not include “consumer”
in their text. If we change the search term to “IoT AND
encryption AND NOT enterprise AND NOT industrial” we
might miss some general research, too, but not as much as
before. But also publications about production line encryption
will be included, because they often miss the term “industrial
IoT” or IIoT. Therefore, all unwanted terms must be excluded.
It takes less effort, to search for more speciﬁc term like
“smart home” instead of IoT to get fewer results. However, by
doing that, one misses a lot of publications or has to search
for a lot of speciﬁc words. A Keyword search would be the
best solution, but only a small subset would be returned. A
restriction to categories is almost impossible, regardless of the
fact that the keywords exists exactly for this purpose.
One of the biggest problems, with the large amount of
search results is the difﬁculty to determine, if the publication
is relevant. The results of the manual publications study
shows, most of the time the abstract is necessary to get the
information. This should be easier if the title or the keywords
are better.
Another problem are the different ways in which the search
engines work. Depending on the library, a restriction of IoT
is useful or not (fewer results from IEEE Xplore with the
category).
As a last issue, it is not clear how many publications in
total from one category have been published in 2019 and 2020
because every search engine differs in the number of results
and some are showing publications in more than one category.
Therefore, this research question cannot be answered by this
study.
VII.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
IoT is a too broad term. Nearly every device can be
counted as an Internet of Things devices. Therefore, a scientiﬁc
search about IoT returns thousand of results. No categorization
or other distinction is used by many researchers. In this
study we only presented results about the big three categories
“consumer”, “enterprise” and “industrial”. The more detailed
results are not necessary for the biggest problems with IoT
and not shown in this paper.
Some weak points about this study are the limitation of 100
papers from only one research library and no further research
about the quality of the publications. Nevertheless, the study
shows the need of clear categories and a strict use of them.
The best way is to include them into the keywords and avoid
using words from other categories in the whole publication,
as the most search engines including the whole text. In some
publications, the term IoT is not necessary at all (e.g., smart
home or smart vehicles).

CLOUD COMPUTING 2020 : The Eleventh International Conference on Cloud Computing, GRIDs, and Virtualization

As future work, we are trying to ﬁnd suitable categories and
additional characteristics to build a categorization for every IoT
device. Because not only researchers are struggling with the
term IoT, standardisation organisations have the same problem,
too. They have to decide, which product should be included
in a new standard and which restrictions can be applied to
all the included ones. They use very broad deﬁnitions like in
ETSI EN 303 645, consumer devices are deﬁned to be used
typical in the home or as wearables, but they can be included in
enterprise IoT environments as well: “Consumer IoT devices
are commonly also used in business contexts. These devices
remain classiﬁed as consumer IoT devices.” [110]
