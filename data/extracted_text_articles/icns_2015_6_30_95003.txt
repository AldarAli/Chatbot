Abstract— In this paper, we present a synthesis of two
solutions
for
mobility
prediction
using
data
mining
techniques such as classification and clustering. Our solution
can be implemented in a third generation network by
exploiting user information (age, function, residence place,
work place, etc.), the existent infrastructure (roads, etc.) and
the history of displacements. Simulations carried out using a
realistic model of movements showed that our strategy can
accurately predict up to of 80% of mobiles’ displacements
and this by not knowing their history of mobility.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, mobile networks have become an integral
part of our daily life. Third generation networks open the
way with new demands for services in multi-media and
real time applications. These applications require more
communication resources and higher Quality of Service
(QoS)
than
traditional
applications.
However,
these
networks are confronted with various problems including
resources wasting and signal attenuation that reduce the
QoS. User mobility also generates QoS degradation and
the network must deal with it.
Two functions are essential in mobile networks:
location
management
and
resource
reservation.
The
location management locates the cell where a mobile user
is in order to make a call to him. The resources
reservation
is
intended
to
ensure
continuity
of
communication when a mobile moves from one cell to
another by reserving bandwidth in the cells he goes
through.
The mobility of users causes performance degradation
in relation to the two previous functions. For the
localization, the network sends location messages (page
messages) to all cells in order to locate the mobile. These
messages consume a part of the bandwidth. For the
reservation of resources, the network is often required to
reserve resources in cells that the mobile will not cross.
Now, if the network would have information about the
displacements of every mobile, and if it integrates
intelligent strategies to take advantage of this information,
it can anticipate their future movements with high
accuracy. This way, the network can better manage its
resources.
In this work, we present two solutions for mobility
prediction based on data mining techniques: classification
and clustering. The rest of the paper is organized as
follows. In Section II, we present a state of the art of
different techniques of prediction. In Section III, we
present the importance of the use of data mining in
mobility
prediction.
In
Section
IV,
we
propose
a
prediction solution and, in the last section, we present the
evaluation of the solution and the simulation results.
II.
STATE OF THE ART
Several techniques allowing prediction have already
been discussed.
One of the most used techniques rests on the
localization by Global Positioning system (GPS). The
mobile sends its position obtained by GPS to its base
station. The latter determines if the mobile is at the edge
of its cell. At each reception of the position from the
mobile, the system calculates the distance separating the
mobile from the neighboring cells, and the shortest (near)
distance is selected [1].
L. Hsu et al. [2] suggest a solution based on the
definition of a reservation threshold. The idea is to
compare the signal received by the mobile coming from
the neighboring cells. If this signal is lower than the
threshold, it is concluded that the mobile moves towards
this cell. In [3], a map of signal power is maintained by
the system. It represents the various signals recorded in
various points of the cell. The authors use this map to
know the position of the mobile, and to extrapolate his
future position.
In [4], [5], mobility rules are generated based on a
history of the movements that each mobile built and
maintained during its displacement. These rules are used
in the prediction process. In fact, it was observed that
users tend to have a routine behavior. Knowing that, and
knowing the usual behavior of the users, it becomes
possible to predict the next cell which a user will visit.
Soh et al. [6] propose a technique based on the use of a
multi-layer neural network in order to exploit the history
of the mobile movements. The recent movements of the
mobile are initially collected in order to know in which
Location Area (LA) it is. A mobility model of the users is
initially processed, and then it will be injected into the
neural network. The mobility model represents the mobile
movements history recorded in an interval of time. The
movement is defined in terms of the direction taken and
the distance covered.
The role of the neural network is to capture the
unknown relation between the last values and future
values of the mobility model; that is necessary for the
prediction.
The authors in [7] propose an algorithm composed of
three phases. The first phase consists in extracting the
movements of the mobile to discover the regularities of
the inter-cellular movements; it is the mobility model of
the mobile. Motility rules are extracted from the preceding
model in the 2nd phase. Finally, in the 3rd phase, the
prediction of mobility is accomplished by using these
rules.
Capka et al. [8] propose a new mobility prediction
algorithm. The user’s behavior is represented by the
repetition of some models of elementary movements. To

estimate the future position of a mobile, the authors
propose an aggressive mobility management Predictive
Mobility Management (PMM). A whole of prevision
algorithms MMP (Mobile Motion Prediction) is used to
predict the next position of the mobiles based on their
movements’ history.
The authors in [9] propose a diagram of prediction
combining between two levels of prediction: global and
local.
The
global
mobility
model
Global
Mobility
Management (GMM) is given in terms of cells crossed by
a mobile during its connection time. The local model
Local Mobility Management (LMM) is given by using
sample of 3-tuples taking into account three parameters:
speed, direction and position. LMM is used to model the
intra-cellular movements of a mobile, whereas the GMM
is used for the inter-cellular movements by associating its
current trajectory with the one of the existing mobility
rules. However, the authors do not present any method
allowing the discovery of these mobility rules.
A method called Dynamic Clustering based Prediction
(DCP) is presented in [10]. It is used to discover the
mobility model of the users from a collection containing
their trajectories. These rules are then used for the
prediction. The trajectories of the users are grouped
according to their similarities.
Daoui et al. [11][12] present a technique of prediction
based on the modeling of mobile displacements by an ants
system. This model allows the prediction based on old
displacements of the mobile and those of the other users
who go in the same direction.
Chamek et al. [13] use a technique of prediction based
on classification of users according to their personal
profile (age, sex, place of work, etc). A new user is
compared to all other users in cell and put in a class, then
the history of displacements of the users in this class is
used for predicting the next cell of the new user.
A technique based on clustering is presented by
Belkadi et al. in [14]. This technique can be implemented
on next generation mobile networks by exploiting the data
available on the users (age, function, address, workplace,
etc), existing infrastructures (roads, location of base
station,
etc.)
and
the
users’
displacements
history.
Locations areas are formed according to these different
pieces of information.
III.
DATA MINING AND MOBILITY
PREDICTION
The mobile's displacements are often generated by
socio-economic
needs
and
are
governed
by
the
topography of the roads and infrastructures covered by the
various cells of the network such as: schools, factories,
supermarkets, highways, etc. The displacements related to
the socio-economic needs are usual, and consequently,
represent a regular aspect [15].
Information concerning a user characteristics, in other
words, the profile, are also of great importance. In fact,
knowing certain characteristics of a user helps us to know
his future displacements with a great probability. For
example, a person of an age ranging between 18 and 25
years, who is student, will probably be located in the
campus one day of week. People having high incomes
will most probably make their purchases in luxury shops,
contrary to others who will prefer supermarkets. The
profiles of mobility of these people are thus different.
Many definitions of data mining can be found, so this
domain is the subject of research. Engineers, statisticians,
economists, etc., can have different ideas on what this
term means. We retain a definition which seems to make
the compromise between various designs. We can define
data mining as the process allowing the extraction of
predictive latent information from wide database [16].
Classification aims to predict the class of a new user
based on the class of users who are in data base. In our
case, it is to predict the future cell of a user based on his
last displacements and those of other users who have the
same profile. The basis of this idea is that displacements
of users are often regular and individuals of the same
profile perform similar movements.
Clustering allows to group cells in clusters, thus
forming a location area, to facilitate the search of the
mobile in the network.
IV.
PRESENTATION OF THE SOLUTIONS
Assume we have an architecture of third generation
network composed of a set of cells. Every cell is
generated by a base station. The base stations are
connected to the core network wired backbone (Figure 1).
We assume that the core network has personal and
professional information about users such as age, marital
status, occupation etc. This information may be collected
when subscribing to network services. We also assume
that each base station has a history of movements of
mobile users.
Figure 1. Architecture of a third generation mobile network
This history contains the mobile user id, the cell from
which he came (Source cell), the cell to which he is
moved (Destination cell) and the date of travel (Table I).
This information can be retrieved in the connections log
ﬁles at each base station and stored in a database on the 
station itself.

A.
Principle of the prediction technique based on
classification
Classification is used to predict the future cell of a
mobile user x. We select N mobile users who are already
located in the same cell. We compare the user x to every
individual y of N users using distance D [12]:

(
where:
•
xi and yi are values of attributes of individuals X,
Y (like age, function, etc.)
•
m is the number of known attributes of individual
So, we select K individuals nearest to X. Then, we
take the displacement history of these K individuals. The
destination cell which is the most frequented is considered
the future cell prediction.
The algorithm proposed is summarized as follows:
Let I= {Y1, Y2 ,…. Yn} be the set of the N individuals
being in cell C.
Entry : Let X be a new individual for whom we want to
predict the future cell.
Parameter K corresponds to the number of nearest
neighbors to take into account.
Parameter L corresponds to the number of history lines to
take for each nearest neighbor.
Exit: the future cell to predict.

2. Record this distance in the vector tab

3. Sort the calculated distances (the vector)
4. Select K smaller distances,

Determine the most frequent destination cell and
return it as the future cell to predict
B.
Principle of the prediction technique based on
clustering
Clustering can be used to form location areas. It is a
set of cells in which a mobile can as a function of its
history and profile. We define the distance between two
cells according to an individual X [13]:

Then, we apply the k-mean algorithm [14] to select K
homogeneous clusters. Such cluster contains a set of cells
having as a common factor the frequency of visit of a
mobile. The cluster having the higher number of visits is
considered the appropriate location area for the mobile.
C.
Localisation
The location procedure (paging) that we propose
uses
an
intelligent
paging
resting on the location
areas that are built by the clustering algorithm, such
that:
- The first zone of localization is composed of two
cells:
* The cell in which the mobile was at the
time of its last call
*
The
predicted
cell,
by
our
algorithm of
prediction, starting from the cell in which the
mobile was at the time of its last call.
- The second zone is composed of the adjacent
cells to the last cell in which the mobile was at the
time of its last call by excluding the cells of the first
zone of localization.
- The third zone of localization is composed of the
other cells of the network.
Localization Procedure:
- Search the mobile in the first location zone
- if the mobile is not in the first zone then
- Search it in the second location zone
- if the mobile is not there then search it in the third
location zone, etc.
V.
ADJUSTMENT AND EVALUATION
Most data mining algorithms require a training phase
to adjust their parameters. In case of the classification, it
provides the best value of two parameter K (number of
nearest neighbor to take into account) and L (number of
line of history to take by close neighbor).
For clustering, we found the best value of parameter M
which represents the optimal number of location zone to
create for the network.
In the study of the mobility management and in the
absence of a real trace of mobiles displacement, we can
resort to a model. The choice of a realistic mobility model
is essential.
This
model
reproduces,
in
a
realistic
way,
displacements of a set of users within the network. The
majority
of
works
presented
in
the
literature
use
probabilistic models (Markov model, poisson process,
etc.) which generate either highly random displacements
or highly deterministic displacements which do not reﬂect 
the real behavior of the mobile users.
In our approach, we have chosen the activity model
presented in [18]. This model is based on the work carried
out by planning organizations and uses statistics drawn
from ﬁve years of surveys on user displacements. It 
simulates a set of user displacements during a number of
days. The generated displacements are based on each
user’s activity (work, study, etc.), the locations of these
activities (house, work places, schools) as well as the
ways which lead to these locations.
The simulator rests on the statistics of displacement
led in the area of Waterloo [17] and recorded in the form
of matrix called activity matrix indicating the probability
of arrival of an activity and duration matrix indicating the
probability that an activity takes a given period of time.
These statistics, as well as information concerning the

users, such as the proﬁle (full time employee, student, 
part-time employee, etc) and the infrastructures (roads,
trade, stadium, etc) are recorded in the simulator database.
Figure 2. Cellular structure of the simulator
The area of Waterloo is divided into 45 cells, as
indicated in Figure 2. According to the activity of the
user, the simulator generates an activity event for a user
based on the activity matrix and assigns it to a cell. It
generates then the displacements relative to this activity
before generating the following activity. The process
continues until the end of the simulation.
D. Adjustment and evaluation of the classification
algorithm
The adjustment of the classification algorithm consists
of determining optimal values for the two parameters K
and L. K is the optimal number of neighbors to consider,
and L is the number of history lines to take for each near
individual. The evaluation is done based on rate prediction
which is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to
the total number of attempts to predict.
Figure 3 shows the ratio prediction as a function of the
parameter K, with the L value fixed to 4 (take 4 lines of
history for each neighbor). The prediction ratio rises to
stabilize at K = 30 with ratio prediction of 60%.
Figure 4 gives the ratio prediction as a function of the
parameter L when K is fixed to 30 (the value that we get
above). The prediction ratio rises with the rise of the value
of L. A better ratio is obtained for L= 45 with a ratio of
70%. So, we can only keep the last 45 displacements of
neighbors’ users.

neighbor)

lines to take for each near individual)
E.
Adjustment and evaluation of the clustering
algorithm
The adjustment of clustering consists in determining
the value of M corresponding to the optimal number of
location zones that we need to create for the network. The
evaluation is based on the number of paging messages and
the update ones. For 100 days of simulation, we have
varied M and calculated the total number of messages
(paging and update). The results are shown in Figure 5.
The optimal number of location zone is 20 with 2 to 3
cells per zone.

Next,
we
compared
our
algorithm
with
several
algorithms,
both
static
and
dynamic.
In
the
static
strategies, cells are grouped on static location areas (0, 1,
2 and 3).
The strategy static 0 contains a cell in each
location area. In static 1, 13 locations areas are created,
each one having 3 or 4 cells. The static 3 divides the
network in 5 areas of 8 to 10 cells. In the dynamic
strategy, the algorithm defined in [17] is used. The result
of this comparison is illustrated in Figure 6 and Figure 7:
the number of update messages and page messages are
calculated during 50 days of simulation with 3, 9 and 12
calls per day.
Figure 6. Number of Update messages for 6 strategies in function of
days
Figure 7. Number of page messages for 6 strategies in function of days
The results show that our solution produces the
minimum number of page messages comparing with the
other strategies.
VI.
CONCLUSION
Human displacements are often caused by socio-
professional
needs.
They
are
linked
to
existing
infrastructure (roads, transport, workplace location, etc.).
It is therefore possible to predict the future position by
looking for links between these movements and other
available information such as user profiles and the
location of the infrastructure.
Due to the complexity of the characteristics of human
mobility and the absence of reliable mobility rules for
prediction movements, data mining can be a solution to
the problem of prediction. Both techniques presented in
this paper show that it is possible to predict 70% of the
movements of mobile users.
