Abstract—In this paper, we present a system for personality
recognition that exploits linguistic cues and does not require
supervision for evaluation. We run the system on a dataset
sampled from a popular Social Network: FriendFeed. We
adopted the ﬁve classes from the standard model known in
psychology as the “Big Five”: extraversion, emotional stability,
agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience.
Making use of the linguistic features associated with those
classes the system generates one personality model for each
user. The system then evaluates the models by comparing all
the posts of one single user (users that have only one post
are discarded). As evaluation measures the system provides
accuracy (measure of the reliability of the personality model)
and validity (measure of the variability of writing style of
a user). The analysis of a sample of 748 Italian users of
FriendFeed showed that that the most frequent personality
type is represented by the model of an extravert, insecure,
agreeable, organized and unimaginative person.

I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK
Personality is a crucial aspect of social interaction. Under
the computational perspective it can be very useful for
marketing and for interesting tasks such as stylometry and
sentiment analysis. Recent studies showed that there is a
connection between the personality of individual users and
their behavior online (see Amichai-Hamburger and Vinitzky
[1]). Social Network Sites (SNSs henceforth, see Boyd and
Ellison [2] for deﬁnitions and history) are huge, virtually
inﬁnite, corpora where authors (users) and sentences (posts)
are found together. Many scholars used data from social
networks for personality classiﬁcation. In 2006 a pioneering
work by Oberlander et al. classiﬁed four traits of blog
authors’ personality using n-grams as features. Some very
recent works such as Quercia et al. [10] and Golbeck et al.
[4] predicted personality of users from social network data.
In particular Golbeck et al. predicted personality from some
users’ proﬁles on Facebook using machine learning tech-
niques. Golbeck’s work is supervised because it required that
subjects completed a personality test for evaluation. Here we
introduce a novel technique for personality recognition that
does not require subjects.
In the following section, we will present a system that
builds on the ﬂy one personality model for each user in
a corpus in an unsupervised way and performs automatic
evaluation of the models comparing all of his/her posts.
Then, in Section 3, we will present the results of the analysis
of personality on FriendFeed. In Section 4, we will conclude
introducing possible directions for future works.
II. UNSUPERVISED PERSONALITY RECOGNITION
The large amount of data available from Social Network
Sites allows us to predict users’ personality from text in
a computational way, but there are at least four nontrivial
problems:
1) The deﬁnition of personality, which is a very fuzzy
and subjective notion;
2) The annotation of personality in the data from SNSs,
that would require personality judgements by the au-
thor themselves or by other native speakers.
3) The construction of one model for each user in the
dataset.
4) The evaluation of personality models.
In the next paragraphs we are going to discuss the solu-
tions for those problems we adopted for the unsupervised
personality recognition system.
A. Deﬁnition of Personality
Psychologists describe personality along ﬁve dimensions
known as the “Big Five” (see Goldberg [5]), a model
introduced by Norman in 1963 [8], obtained from factor
analysis of personality description questionnaires that has
become a standard over the years. The ﬁve dimentions are
the following:
• Extraversion (E) (sociable vs shy)
• Emotional stability (S) (calm vs insecure)
• Agreeableness (A) (friendly vs uncooperative)
• Conscientiousness (C) (organized vs careless)
• Openness (O) (insightful vs unimaginative)
Those dimentions can be represented computationally as
continuous numerical variables with 2 poles: one positive

(1) and one negative (0). Once we have the numerical values
for each attribute (one attribute is one dimention in the “Big
Five”), we can easily calculate whether a user has one trait
of personality (y) or not (n) or we have no information about
that trait (o). From this representation, we can formalize a
personality model for each user simply taking the majority
class for each attribute/dimension from all posts the user
made. In the end personality models are formalized as string
of ﬁve charachters: one for each attribute, which one can take
three possible vaues: positive (y), negative (n) or balanced
(o). For example a the string ynooy is the model of an
extravert, nervous and open-minded user.
B. Dataset
The dataset is a sample of 748 Italian FriendFeed users
(1065 posts). It is a subset of the dataset sampled by Celli
et al. [3]. The dataset has been collected from FriendFeed
public URL, where new posts are publicly available. The
dataset was already processed with a language identiﬁer,
whose performance is correct at 88%. This made easier the
extraction of the Italian subset.
Our unsupervised system does not require direct annota-
tion of the dataset, but just a set of correlations between
linguistic factors and personality traits to build models.
Either Mairesse et al., Golbek et al. and Quercia et al. report
sets of correlations between some cues and the dimentions
of personality in the “Big Five”. In our system we used a
set taken from Mairesse et al. because it is the largest one
and it is more focused on linguistics.
C. Building the Personality Model
Mairesse et al. provides a long list of correlation coefﬁ-
cients between linguistic factors and the personality traits.
These coefﬁcients are obtained from an essay corpus where
authors and external observers provided personality judge-
ments following the “Big Five” model. In order to develop
an unsupervised personality recognition system we need to
turn those coefﬁcients into features that can be automatically
extracted from text. Among those linguistic factors that
correlates with certain aspects of personality there are some
regarding topic (for example if a person writes about job,
leisure, music, other people), some regarding word usage
(for example the frequency of words used, the use of
negative particles, ﬁrst person pronouns, ﬁllers, swares) and
some regarding psychological aspects (for example age of
acquisition of the word used, length of the words used,
expression of positive and negative feelings). Factors are
supposed to be valid for the western culture. We picked up
and adapted 22 features from Mairesse et al. They are:
1) all punctuation (ap): the count of . , ; : in the
post,
2) commas (cm): the count of , in the post,
3) reference to other users (du): the count of the pattern
@ in the post,
4) exclamation marks (em): the count of ! in the post,
5) external links (el): the count of external links in the
post,
6) ﬁrst person singular pronouns (im): the number of
ﬁrst person singular pronouns in the post,
7) negative particles (np): the count of negative particles
in the post,
8) negative emotions (ne): the count of emoticons ex-
pressing negative feelings in the post,
9) numbers (nb): the count of numbers in the post,
10) parenthesis (pa): the count of parenthetical phrases in
the post,
11) positive emotions (pe): the count of emoticons ex-
pressing positive feelings in the post,
12) prepositions (pp): the count of prepositions in the
post,
13) pronouns (pr): the count of pronouns in the post,
14) question marks (qm): the count of ? in the post,
15) long words (sl): the count of words longer than 6
letters in the post,
16) self reference (sr): the count of ﬁrst person (singular
and plural) pronouns in the post,
17) swears (sw): total count of vulgar expressions in the
post,
18) type/token ratio (tt): deﬁned in the formula below,
19) word count (wc): words in the post,
20) ﬁrst person plural pronouns (we): count of ﬁrst
person plural pronouns in the post,
21) second person singular pronouns (yu): count of
second person singular pronouns in the post,
22) mean word frequency (mf): simple mean of the
frequency of words in the post, deﬁned in the formula
below.
tt = w − T
T
mf = Σwf
T
where w is the count of words already used in the sentence,
T is the total word count in the sentence and wf is the
frequency count of the word in the dataset. Table I (from
Mairesse et al.) shows how the linguistic features used
correlate with personality traits. First the system extracts a
random sample of the dataset for statistical purposes. The
size of the sample can be decided a-priori, in this case we
sampled 500 posts. From this sample the system extracts
mean and standard deviation for each feature. The mean
word frequency (feature mf) in this case is calculated using
an external corpus of Italian (CORISsmall, see [11]) but in
principle it can be calculated also from the dataset itself as
relative frequency. Results are summarized in Table II. In the
second step the system processes the entire dataset building
a personality model for each post applying the following
rules: if a sentence shows a feature correlating positively
with one personality trait and the frequency of that feature
is higher than mean plus standard deviation for that feature,

PERSONALITY TRAITS IN THE DATASET.
then the system increases the score of that personality trait. If
a sentence shows a feature whose frequency is higher than
mean plus standard deviation and it correlates negatively
with one personality trait, the system decrease the score of
that personality trait. Then numerical values are turned into
nominal ones (“y”,“n” and “o”) simply checking if a value
is positive, negative or it is zero. In the end the majority
class of each personality trait is calculated for each user and
the resulting string is taken as the user’s personality model.
D. Evaluation of Personality Models
The evaluation method is based on the assumption that
one user has one and only one personality and that this
personality emerges at different degrees from user’s posts.
Hence the system evaluates the personality model comparing
many posts of the same user. The drawback of this method
is that we can only evaluate models for users that have more
than one post in the dataset, and we have to discard all the
other users.
The unsupervised system takes all the models built from
the posts of a user and compares each value of the string.
This evaluation method provides two measures, accuracy (a)
and validity (v), deﬁned in the formulas below:
a =
tp + tn
tp + tn + fp + fn
v = 1 − a
P
where P is the number of posts of one user; tp is the sum
of each personality attribute matching within the same user
(for example “y” and“y”, “n” and “n”, “o” and “o”); tn is
the sum of opposite attributes within the same user (“y” and
“n”, “n” and “y”); fp is the sum of possible attributes turned
to the balance value within the same user (“y” to “o” and
“n” and “o”) and fn is the sum of the zero attributes turned to
positive or negative (“o” to “y” and “o” and “n”). Accuracy
gives a measure of the reliability of the personality model
and validity gives information about how much the model
is valid for all the user’s posts, in other words how much
the user writes expressing the same personality traits. A low
validity score means that the user shows variability in his/her
writing style.
III. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
We ﬁltered out group posts (because many users with
different personalities can post in a group) and kept only
single users from the dataset. Most users (592) have just
one post and the models obtained from those users were
not considered reliable (accuracy is set to 0). Excluding
the users with only one post the average accuracy is 0.631
and the average validity is 0.729. Accuracy is in line
with the classiﬁcation accuracies reported by Mairesse et
al. 2007 for observer ratings evaluation. This fact is very
encouraging because it is a clue that we developed a system
that implements Mairesse’s model completely automatically.
The results of the frequency of personality models in the
sample is reported in Table III. Below rank 7 models become
more and more sparse, with a long tail of models appearing
only once. Thay do not appear in Table III.
The most frequent personality type in the Italian subset
of FriendFeed is represented by the model of an extravert,
insecure, agreeable, organized and unimaginative person.
It is interesting to note that the features “insecure” and

“unimaginative” is present in the ﬁrst four positions of the
ranking and that no shy people is found in the ﬁrst six posi-
tions. Pearson’s correlation test reveal that there is a strong
(+0.79) and highly signiﬁcant correlation (p-value = .0003)
between the accuracy and personality model types, meaning
that there are certain personality types that express strongly
and reliably their personality in written language, and others
that do not. Althought there is no correlation (p-value =
.413) between personality and posting activity, once ﬁltered
out the long tail of users with sparse personality models,
emerges that there is one personality type that produces more
posts than others, that is the extravert, insecure, friendly, not
particularly precise and unimaginative person (ynyon).
A manual look to the data reveals that there are some
users (the ones with higher validity) that are focused on a
topic, and sometimes this topic is clear from their username:
for example “styleandthecity”, or such users as “ultimora”
or “cronaca24”, which appear to be journalists and have a
very recognizable and normalized style, but not the same
personality model.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, we described and developed an unsupervised
system for personality recognition that does not require sub-
jects for evaluation. It exploits existing correlations between
language cues and personality traits providing accuracy
and validity as evaluation measures. We showed that it is
possible to extract personality information from SNSs in an
unsupervised way with acceptable accuracy with a process
that is completely automatic. The results reported here show
that the distribution of personality models in SNSs has a high
peak of people sharing the same personality traits and a long
tail of people with a unique personality model. Results also
show that validity is a good measure of the recognizability
of the style of a user.
In the future, we would like to improve the system
exploiting different correlation sets. We would also like to
sample and automatically annotate large corpora of Social
Network data in order to facilitate the research in this ﬁeld.
