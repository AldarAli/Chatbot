Abstract— PLC technology based on an OFDM communication 
scheme is considered for data transmission between a control 
unit and actuators located in an aircraft wing. In order to 
optimize 
some 
OFDM 
parameters, 
transfer 
function 
measurements have been performed on an avionic test bench. 
Based on experimental values of the coherence bandwidth and 
of the channel delay spread, it appears that the subcarrier 
spacing can be larger than the spacing specified in HomePlug 
AV, which usually applies for in-house environment. Similarly, 
the duration of the cyclic prefix can be reduced. This will allow 
meeting the real-time and determinism constraints of avionic 
systems.

 INTRODUCTION  
In future aircrafts, hydraulic flight control systems will be 
replaced by electric systems. The main interests are: a better 
reliability and flexibility, a decrease in maintenance costs, 
but the major problem is the increasing of wires length. In 
order to decrease this length, it has been proposed to use 
power line communications (PLC) technology for flight 
control systems. This technology has proven its reliability in 
in-home network with HomePlug AV (200 Mbit/s in the 
[1;30] MHz bandwidth [1]). In addition, there are numerous 
studies concerning PLC in different kinds of vehicles like 
cars [2], boats [3], and trains [4]. For aircrafts, [5] and [6] 
projects investigate the possibility of using PLC technology 
for the cabin light system.  
In the near future, the AC power distribution will be 
replaced by a high voltage direct current (HVDC) 
distribution network. The authors in [7] studied the 
feasibility of using PLC technology between the power 
inverter and the actuator for flight control. In this paper, we 
focus on the PLC link on the HVDC network between a 
control unit and the power inverter feeding various active 
loads. Flight control systems do not require a high bit rate 
link, few Mbit/s being enough, but the communication must 
be highly reliable, deterministic, real time and must comply 
with the aeronautic standard DO-160 [8]. As shown in Fig. 
1, we will consider the link between the control unit and the 
power inverter located near the actuators (spoilers) used for 
flight control. In this illustration, the PLC master (control 
unit side) transmits data to PLC slaves (power inverters 
side), corresponding to a point-to multipoint architecture. It 
is also possible to use point-to-point architecture, where one 
PLC node transmits data to another PLC node. 
 
Figure 1. PLC system on aircraft wing 
 
In order to transmit data over the HVDC network, we use 
either a capacitive coupler or an inductive coupler, the 
transmission being based on the usual Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission 
scheme. In addition, one of the major challenges of the 
command of the flight control systems is the real time 
constraints. Indeed, they operate at frequency about 1kHz 
(fast loop). According to the common practice, command 
systems must work six times quickly as much as the 
equipments that they command, which represent 6 kHz in 
our case. In addition, we must pay attention that there are 
several calculators in the loop, which require time 
processing. That's why we consider that our system do not 
exceed from 10 % to 20 % of the total time processing, 
which represent in our case from 17 µs to 34 µs. Thus, an 
analysis of the propagation channel made on a test bench 
representative of an actual configuration will allow the 
optimization of few OFDM parameters to show that is 
possible to have an OFDM duration in compliance with 
these real-time constraints. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
describe the channel and the test bench, while results on the

II. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE TEST BENCH AND OF THE 
MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE  
In this test bench, the channel is formed by a harness and 
at least 2 couplers. 
A. Configuration 
In this measurement campaign, two architectures were 
studied: 
- The point-to-point architecture, with 2 couplers (Fig. 2 
and Fig. 3) 
- The point-to-multipoint architecture with 1 master and 
2 slaves (Fig. 4) 
The tests have been performed on a test bench whose 
active loads (540 V, 5 A) are representative of actual 
avionic loads and with a ± 270 DC power supply. 
For this experimentation, the harness of 32 meters long, 
includes one twisted pair, one twisted quadrifilar cable, and 
one wire. The capacitive coupler transmits data between 
+270 V and -270 V DC, and is made by a transformer and 
two capacitors and use one twisted pair: signal is transmitted 
on one twisted pair between +270 V and -270 V.  
 
Figure 2. Point-to-point architecture with capacitive coupler 
 
We have also considered another possibility, which is to 
use a twisted pair for the +270 V, rather than a single wire 
for the -270 V. In this case, the twisted pair is short circuited 
at both ends and an inductive coupler can be used as 
illustrated in Fig. 3: signal is transmitted on one twisted pair 
on +270 V. It must be emphasized that, for the same DC 
power, the diameter of each wire of the twisted pair can be 
reduced for avoiding an increase of the weight.   
 
 
 
In Fig. 4 we shows the last possibility: the point-to-
multipoint architecture with inductive coupler. In this case 
we use three couplers on the +270 V. thus, harness is 
compose of one quadrifilar and one wire for the minus 
polarity. In the following, line 1 refers to the channel 
between coupler 1 and coupler 2 and line 2 to the channel 
between coupler 1 and coupler 3. 
 
 
 
B. Measurements 
Measurements have been carried out with a network 
analyser in the [1;100] MHz bandwidth with a 5 kHz 
resolution bandwidth. For each configuration, the transfer 
functions were measured between the input/output V1, V2 
and V3.  
III. 
INSERTION GAIN AND CHANNEL IMPULSE RESPONSE 
Plots of Fig. 5 give the variation of the insertion gain (IG) 
versus frequency for the different architectures, while the 
cumulative distribution of IG is represented in Fig. 6. For 
the point-to-point configuration with an inductive coupler, 
IG first decreases linearly (in dB) with the frequency (up to 
40 MHz), and varies from -5 to -25 dB. Then, IG remains 
nearly constant between 40 and 80 MHz and, beyond 80 
MHz, decreases very rapidly. The other plots of Fig. 5 show 
that this behavior is nearly independent from the 
configuration except that we can note that the point-to-point 
link with a capacitive coupling presents several important 
fading in the low frequency band while at high frequency, 
(between 70 and 100 MHz), IG takes higher values than for 
the other configurations.

The channel impulse response has been deduced from the 
measurements of the complex transfer function by applying 
an inverse Fourier transform of 6000 points for [1;30] MHz 
and 20000 points for [1;100] MHz bandwidth. The results 
are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, by considering a frequency 
band either between 1 and 30 MHz or between 1 and 100 
MHz.

Coherence bandwidths and delay spreads are deduced

IV. 
COHERENCE BANDWIDTH AND DELAY SPREAD 
The coherence bandwidth (CB) is deduced from the 
absolute value of the autocorrelation of the complex transfer 
function [9]. In the following, CB is calculated for a 
correlation coefficient of 0.9. Delay spread is calculated 
from the channel impulse responses according to [9]. Delay 
spread and coherence bandwidth are given in Table I, by 
considering either a 30 MHz or a 100 MHz transmission 
bandwidth.  
It appears that the geometrical architecture and the type of 
coupler do not have a strong impact, the coherence 
bandwidth being of the order 700 – 1000 kHz, while the 
delay spread varies from 78 to 104 ns. These results are 
quite comparable to those obtained for other embedded 
systems as shown in Table II.

OPTIMIZATION OF FEW OFDM PARAMETERS 
A. OFDM Subcarrier Spacing 
In order to meet the real time constraints, it is necessary to 
minimize the processing time of the data. Since fast Fourrier 
transform (FFT) is a time consuming process, one can try to 
decrease the number of carriers and choose, as in common 
practice, a carrier spacing equal to about 10% of the 
coherence bandwidth. Taking the values in Table I into 
67

account, this leads to a 70 kHz subcarrier spacing, thus 
about three times the value given in HomePlug AV 
specifications (24.414 kHz). Furthermore, the baseband 
complex OFDM symbol will supply an I/Q RF modulator. 
This allows us to keep the FFT size equal to the number of 
carriers. In our case, the number of subcarriers is equal to 
428 or 1428 for a transmission bandwidth of 30 MHz or 100 
MHz, respectively. 
B. Interference Characterization 
Using the channel impulse response values, it is also 
possible to compute the Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) and 
the Inter Carrier Interference (ICI) in order to choose the 
optimal length
Lcp
 of the cyclic prefix. A too long 
Lcp
will 
reduce spectral efficiency and data rate. The power spectral 
density of (ISI) and (ICI) can be computed as follows [12]:

plotted versus the subcarrier number and for various lengths 
of the cyclic prefix (CP).

As expected, the interference decreases rapidly with the 
length of the cyclic prefix but, beyond a given value, it does 
not vary appreciably.  
From these curves, which have also been plotted for the 
other previously described network architectures, one can 
conclude that the CP length 
Lcp
 can be reduce at 15 
samples (500 ns) for a 30 MHz band, and of 30 samples 
(300 ns) for a 100 MHz band.

As a comparison, if the cyclic duration was chosen equal 
to 2 to 4 times the delay spread, as suggested in [13], we 
would obtain a CP duration between 200 and 400 ns. 
VI. 
SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSION 
For the aircraft environment studied in this paper, we 
have shown that it is possible to reduce the duration of an 
OFDM symbol compared to Homeplug Av standard, by 
increasing subcarrier spacing and decreasing the cyclic 
prefix duration. In the HomePlug AV standard the 
subcarrier spacing is 24.414 kHz, the minimum cyclic prefix 
duration is 5.56 µs, and the OFDM duration is 46.52 µs. In 
our application, we propose to increase the subcarrier 
spacing to 70 kHz and decrease the CP duration to 500 ns. 
Consequently, the symbol duration will be 14.78 µs instead 
of 46.52 µs (HPAV spec.). These results will help us to 
define the physical layer for a PLC avionics system in 
accordance with real-time constraints of a fast loop. This 
study can be applied to other critical avionic systems 
running on a HVDC network like landing gear. A fortiori, it 
is possible to use this study for a slow loop on HVDC 
network like, thrust reversal.
