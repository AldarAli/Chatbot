necessary for emergency management and disaster reduction. 
A new method for emergency map symbols extraction from 
symbol collection based semantic analysis is presented in this 
paper. A novel map symbol semantic matrix is introduced to 
measure the degree of the semantic representation between the 
symbol meaning and the emergency event conception. The 
necessary content factors of emergency released in map are 
conduced by analyzing the emergency content construction 
and statistic result of the emergency content published by 
national disaster reduction center. The fuzzy comprehensive 
evaluation is proposed to extract the map symbol class. The 
sub function

 INTRODUCTION  
Natural disasters or emergency hazards occur frequently 
in the world [1], such as earthquake, typhoon, mud-rock 
flow, land-slip of the mountains, falling and the downthrow 
of the earth, etc. These are significant and realistic threats to 
people’s wealth and life. Most of the natural disasters and 
emergency hazards are intimately related with spatial. To 
marked those hazard information including characters, 
impact range and the response processing by symbol on a 
map, it is of important practical and immediate significance 
to the disaster prevention and reduction. [2]. At present, 
researchers have done little work on this area [3]. The 
dissemination of emergency information processing system 
is mostly manual intervention, in a low automation level [2], 
so it is necessary to do some work in this area.  The sematic 
of cartographic symbols includes spatical character and 
reference characters[4].  
In this paper, a cartographic symbol extraction model 
on emergency hazard map n based semantic analysis is 
presented. A novel map symbol semantic matrix is 
introduced to measure the degree of the semantic 
representation between the symbol meaning and the 
emergency 
event 
conception. 
Further 
the 
fuzzy 
comprehensive evaluation and sub function are proposed to 
extract emergency map symbol from symbol library, by 
evaluating the relationship between the symbol semantic 
representation and the emergency event construction. 
II. 
SEMANTICS RELATED TO EMERGENCY 
SYMBOL 
Map symbols, composed of some graphics with different 
shape, size and color, are atlas language and could express 
geo-information effectively. Some researchers have done 
some work on map symbols linguistics, while most of them 
focused on the organization mode of graphic elements and 
symbol design. In this session, research on semantic 
representation of map symbol will be carried out by 
analyzing 
relationship 
between 
the 
entire 
semantic 
representation of the map symbol and the emergency content 
construction. 
The map symbol for emergency release is thematic 
symbol. Spatial and representation are the basic attributes of 
those symbols. 
The spatial character is the position on the map. 
According to the distribution mode of the object, the pattern 
of the map symbol spatial distribution includes dot, line,  and 
poly. The dot distribution refers to the emergency whose 
spatial distribution mode is a point, for example, “January 2, 
2008, 20 pm, a great fire occurred in U-City, D-Square”, the 
D-Square is just a point in small scale map. The line 
distribution refers to the emergency whose spatial 
distribution mode is the line, for example, “January 6, 2008, 
Ice-run appeared in the Yellow River in Ningxia section, the 
whole length is about 234 Km”. The poly distribution refers 
to the emergency whose spatial distribution mode is poly, for 
example, “from January 12,2008, a great snow storm fell in 
Anqing, Chizhou, Tongling district”. The Anqing, Chizhou, 
and Tongling districts, which suffered from a great snow 
storm, are an area on a large scale map. 
Symbol representation is to assess the relationship 
between the symbol and the emergency event, which is the 
ideographic 
expression. 
In 
this 
paper, 
the 
symbol 
representation measure is studied, not the symbol design. 
The symbol representation includes two aspects: symbol 
credibility and symbol (press) degree. 
Definition: Symbol credibility: The real event is material, 
while the symbol is abstract, so there is gap between them. 
Symbol credibility (
ij
ϕ ) is used to measure this relationship.

ij
ϕ is the credibility for symbol  i representing the case j. 
ij
ϕ is continuous not binary, 0

≤ ，i∈ symbol, j∈ case, 
ij
ϕ is dimensionless. The greater 
ij
ϕ  is, the more little the 
gap is, that is the symbol is more similar to the event. 
ij
ϕ is often set by expert’s subjective judgment, it is a 
definition value. 
Definition: Symbol (press) degree: Generally speaking, 
a different emergency is often represented with different 
degree’s symbols, according to the emergency press. The 
class of emergency symbol could be set by different shape 
and graphics construction and the press degree of emergency 
map symbol could be set by different color. For instance, the 
level of different meteorological disaster symbols is 
distinguished by four color-blue, yellow, orange,  and red 
(according to the regulation of meteorological disaster 
symbols for prediction, published by China Meteorological 
Administration in 2004) [6] .

III. 
EMERGENCY SEMANTIC CONSTRUCTION 
MODEL 
Emergency is an out-of-order incident, which people have 
little knowledge and information about [7]. A range of issues 
arising from the emergency are of ill-structured or 
unstructured problems [12]. If the emergency could not be 
responded effectively, it will lead to crisis. Emergency is 
often regarded as pre-crisis. Compared with general incidents, 
emergency incidents have the following three characteristics: 
emergent, severe ,and urgent. 
Some linguists have done useful exploration and research 
on the analysis of the emergency content, such as Zeng 
Qingqing[5], who defined two information chains from the 
perspective of researchers—the main information chain and 
the secondary information chain. Yang Erhong analyzed the 
emergency content by setting the key words. The key 
elements in emergency content construction will be deduced 
by analyzing the relationship between the emergency 
meaning and the semantic representation of map symbols. 
Event in context refers to language description for the 
special matter which people are concerned about, it belongs 
to the union meaning description [4]. Event is made up of 
event words and event parameters. In other words, the 
behavior generally described by verbs also includes event 
word, location, participants and so on. 
Event word is to flag the property of the event, which is 
the key difference compared with other events. For example, 
“January 16, 2008 16:50 pm, one person was missing in a 
land-slip of the mountains, in Guxiang village, Xinshui town, 
Daning country”. In this context, the event word is “land-slip 
of the mountains”, which is the key word to distinguish the 
emergency. Generally speaking, a content collection may be 
confirmed by the type of the emergency when the event 
word appears. 
Definition: Event word collect A:  
                   
1
{ , 2
,,,
n}
A
a a
a
=
                                            (1) 
where 
an
a a
,1 2,...,
 are the elements of A, 
ia is the event 
word. For example, the coalmine accident is defined as: 
Coalmine Accidents ={gas accident, collapse, colliery 
flooding, ...}. 
The emergency hazard type should be certain from the 
context. If the type is not indexed in event word library, it 
could be pushed in the event word library, thus the event 
word library is open for extend. 
Sometimes, the event word is not in context, for example, 
the context—“the houses have been razed to the ground, 
most of people was homeless”, we knew the state of the 
house and the victims, but we could not detect the disaster 
type from the content, it may be earthquake, volcano or flood. 
This is called the event word missing, and the symbol could 
not be extracted from the emergency content when event 
word missing.  
A. Event parameters 
An integrated emergency should have a completed event 
word centric expression model that is given by:

                                   (2) 
where p1, p2,,, pn are the event parameters to describe the 
emergency.

The components of the emergency event are always the 
mapping results from the part parameters in the whole event 
parameters. For example, the event parameters of the 
emergency- land-slip of the mountains includes : 
“
1p -Location”,  
“
2
p -Impact range”, 
 “
3
p -The time of occurrence”,  
“
4
p -The duration”,  
“
5
p -The dead and hurt people”,  
“
6
p -The economic losing”, etc.  
For example, the context-“January 16, 2008 16:50 pm, 
one people was missing in a land-slip of the mountains, in 
Guxiang village, Xinshui town, Daning country”, the event 
parameters in above include location, the time of occurrence 
and the number of missing. 
B. Event attributes 
Event attributes are used to describe the state of the event. 
The event modality, press degree, frequency and the state are 
focused on. The event modality is the possibility of 
emergency occurrence. The event modality mode is 
determined when the emergency has occurred, while for the 
predicted emergency, it should be marked by title or other 
form of annotation. For example, the context from the China 
Central Meteorological Station, “in the next 2-3 days, the 8th 
typhoon will generate in the northern of the South China Sea, 
the wind in typhoon center will be expected to reach 10-12 
class.”  is a predictive emergency. The event press degree is 
used to measure the hazardous extent of the emergency. It is 
in the content of the emergency sometimes, for example, 
“January 8, 2008, a serious traffic accident occurred in the 
Hexu expressway in Anhui province section”. (The press 
degree in this emergency is serious). While sometimes it is 
not direct in the emergency content, for example,” January 7, 
2008, two were hurt in the traffic accident in 312 State Road 
in Yongshou country section”. Sometimes the event press 
degree could be detected from the content if there is enough 
information in. The event frequency is the number of the 
emergency occurred. For example, “January, 20, 2008, two 
blasts occurred in a chemical factory, fortunately nobody 
was hurt”, The event frequency of this blast is two times. 
The event state is used to describe the current state of the 
emergency incident, for example, “January, 10, 2008, a 
coalmine flooding accident occurred in K-Country, D-city. 
Now the rescue work is still on.” 
The statistic result of the emergency context for release 
with map symbols is as follows: (From national disaster 
reduction center, public)

In Table 2, the event word, event space, event occurrence 
time are all emerging in the emergency context, combination 
of the research result of the map symbol, a conclusion is 
drawn that the emergency content for release in map should 
at least include the event word, space and occurrence time. 
The event word and the event space have to be marked on 
the map. The event occurrence time is sometimes marked out 
of the map, usually as title, annotation. The event extent is 
necessary for the level emergent. 
IV. 
SOFTWARE MODEL DESIGN FOR SYMBOL 
EXTRACTION 
The basic principle of the map symbols extraction 
algorithm is scattering the event according to the attributes 
of the elements. Then they can be converted to quantitative 
data according to the discrete elements and can be mapped 
to the symbol library through the mapping model . This 
paper will further extend this mapping as an evaluation. 
The result of scattering event is the formation of an 
event object , the event object including (attribute 1 attribute 
2, ... attribute n).Each symbol in the symbol library is 
associated with a semantic routing model .Semantic routing 
model is a table, which saves semantic categories and 
similarity of each symbol. The attribute of the event object 
can be into the evaluation index, the sign which gets a high 
score in this indicator is the symbol to be extracted. Then 
setting attributes (color, size, etc.) of the extracted symbol 
according to other semantic events in the object (degree of 
harm).The model is shown in Figure 2: 
The Procedure Design Language (PDL) for map symbol 
extraction is as follows: 
(1) Analyzing the emergency content, getting the elements

if (Event word

| Event space

| event occurrence

), A  could not be released, then finish. 
(2) Map symbol extraction algorithm:  
if( ∃ Event extent) 
f1
= f
 (event word, event extent, 
symbol collection) 
Else 
f1
= f
 (event word, default event extent, symbol 
collection) 
(3) if(

f ≠ null
)，Symbol space position：
(
d
= f
Event 
space ) ,  then

f is marked at d . 
(4) Mark the event occurrence time in map as label or title

or other illustration. 
The algorithm and technical of position on map is quite 
mature, the event occurrence time is often marked as title or 
annotation. The map symbol extraction in step (2) is studied 
in this paper. 
Define symbol as a bivariate function, that is, 
 
( ,
)
S
= f B V
                                              (3) 
where B is the symbol’
s class and V is its extent.

that shows the relationship between attribute k and the class i. 
kjl =1, when k consistent with j in class i, otherwise kjl =0. 
For example, class i is {flood, snow storm, earthquake, 
volcano, 
explosion, 
ice-run,,,}, 
then

A. Symbol’s class extraction 
The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, which is a method 
to classify the examples according by some indicators, is 
introduced to extract the map symbol class. 
Suppose the count of event word is n, its attribute matrix 
is
( )
L i ， (i=1,2,…n), then the extracted analysis matrix

2,...,
r T

η

η  = ( ( ) ( ))T
L i A i
, where i=1,2,,,r. r is the 
count of symbol in symbol collection. 
The processing steps are as follows: 
1. Confirm the fuzzy relationship matrix Ri (including 
the membership function and the result), i=1,…,n. 
2. Confirm the weighed distribution vector A, A= 
(a1,a2,,,,an). 
3. Get the evaluation result Bi by blue processing, Bi = 
A° Ri, Bi= (bi1,bi2,,,,bin). 
where the samples belong to the class k*, when bik
* = 
max
k
|bik|. 
B. Confirm the risk of symbol 
The event degree is to explain the hazardous extent of the 
emergency, including the directly or indirectly information, 
indirect information, such as “7 people injured in a traffic 
accident, in Badong country, January 3, 2008”, the directly 
information is that, “January 8, 2008, a serious traffic 
accident occurred in the Hexu expressway in Anhui province 
section”.  
(1) If the event press degree is not in the emergency 
context, define the event extent is the lowest. 
(2) If the press degree l is in the context, the v is 
extracted directly. The higher the event extent level is, the 
more hazardous the emergency is. 
(3) If the extent level is not direct in the context, while 
the number information about extent is in. Supposing that the 
information number k about extent is an indicators collection, 
that is, 
1
{ , 2
,,, }
n
K
k k
k
=
 n is the count of the elements in k. 
Then, the sub-event extent to 
ik  could be confirmed 
according by the industry standard.  
For example, the rainfall extent defined by China 
Meteorological Administrator is that: 1th grade is from 
4.17mm/h to 8.33mm/h, 2 th is from 8.33mm/h to 
16.67mm/h, 3 th is from 16.67mm/h to 33.33mm/h, 4 th is 
from 33.33mm/h to larger. The function is like that:

 EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSESE 
Since the event word and press degree are necessary for 
emergency release. Suppose there are event words t1, t2, t3, 
t4 and press degree indicators k1, k2, k3, k4 in the 
emergency context. The simulation processing 
f1
= f
 (event 
word, event extent, symbol collection) is as follows: 
A. Symbol’s class extraction 
Six map symbols in collection as examples will be 
evaluated. After analysis from the symbol mapping table, the 
relationship result between the symbol semantic and the 
event word is as follows:

After confirming B and V, according to (3), the target 
symbol could be calculated. Generally speaking, the function

f B V  is a mapping function to the symbol, B is the row, V 
is the col.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, the context and semantic construction 
about the emergency for release was studied. The map 
symbol semantic matrix is introduced to measure the 
relationship between the symbol semantic representation 
and the emergency event. According to the research, the 
necessary conditions for the emergency release in map are 
deduced. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is proposed 
to extract the symbol’s class and the classified function for 
the factor of the event extent is used to confirm the event 
press degree. In this experiment, the symbol semantic 
matrix values are set by subjective definition, the value will 
be set by the standard or the expert database after the 
enough resource has been collected in future. By analyzing 
the example, the effectiveness and practice of the present 
experimental method are proved. The extension of the 
normalization of performance value and 
efficiency 
compared with other method would be our future direction.
