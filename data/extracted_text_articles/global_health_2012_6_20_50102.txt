Abstract— This report proposes a new support system that allows
elderly people to live with a sense of security without the help of
other people. In this system, it is possible to watch closely the
condition of elderly people from a distant public institution by
using sensors. Furthermore, this system presents the relevant
information in order to maintain the physical condition of the
elderly. By performing an experiment using this system, this paper
proves that the proposed system would be useful for the support of
elderly people.

INTRODUCTION
The number of elderly people is rapidly increasing in both
developing and developed countries. It is necessary to establish
methods for taking care of many elderly people through a social
system. There are many reports about characteristics of human
motions in daily life [1-3]. However, there are only a few reports
on measurement of elderly people’s behavior in daily life
situations [4-9]. To establish more adaptable care systems for
elderly people, it is important to attempt measuring and
analyzing human behaviors and motions in daily life.
In our laboratory, we study the development of support
systems for the elderly people. This paper proposes a new
support system that analyzes human behaviors and motions and
detects a change in the physical condition of an elderly human in
the house. It is thought that it is important to research elderly
people’s behavior in daily life and investigate it thoroughly for
developing and establishing a support system.
II.
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND QUESTIONNAIRES
The new support system is a Living Situation Monitoring
System. The concept diagram of this system is illustrated in
Figure 1. The system is fundamentally composed of sensor units,
a controller unit and a supervisor unit. Several sensor units and a
controller unit with two antennas were placed in the house of
solitary elderly people.
Also, this support system has a communication tool. This tool
was used when the Health Management Center sent the
information of a local community event to elderly people. Figure
2 shows the operation screen of the Health Management Center
when they send the information. Figure 3 shows the operation
screen on the side of elderly people.

The sensor units consisted of four types of sensors: a
pyroelectric infrared sensor, a magnetic door sensor, an electric
current sensor and a light sensor. For example, a pyroelectric
infrared sensor was able to perceive any human motion by
detecting the IR emission from a human body. Also, using an
electric current sensor, it was possible to record some actions in
human life such as turning on/off the switch of a television, an
electric heater, and so on. Using these sensor units, human
behavior could be detected. These data were transmitted to the
controller unit using a wireless telecommunication method. In
the controller unit, these data were analyzed in order to check
the physical condition of an elderly human in the house. Several
sensors detected human motions in real time, and the detection
results were stored in a controller unit. Furthermore, all data in
the controller unit were sent to the supervisor unit. In the
supervisor unit, the data were classified into each subject’s
database and were accumulated. A characteristic pattern for each
person, including time series variation of detected values, was
extracted from each person’s data using only the pyroelectric
infrared sensor.
As the new system was developed, preliminary experiments
were performed to examine detection accuracy. The subjects
were eight elderly people who lived in solitude away from their
family.
In addition, questionnaires were developed to understand the
elderly people’s life style and validated. In the first questionnaire,
there were about 70 questions about their daily life everyday for a
month: wake-up time, bedtime, eating time, times of going out,
and so on. In the second questionnaire, subjects were told to list
every night what they actually had done on that particular day.

RESULTS AND VERIFICATION EXPERIMENTSD
3.1 System architecture and questionnaries
Figure 4 shows the detection results by pyroelectric infrared
sensor with the characteristic pattern which was transmitted back
to the controller unit. It was possible that, by comparing the
measured data using the sensor units, the physical condition of
the elderly people could be estimated continuously. As a result,
it was possible that the sensors detected human motions like
moving from one room to another, and actions like turning
on/off the switch of a television.
Figure 5 shows the diurnal detection results by pyroelectric
infrared sensor. This result shows exercise tendency of elderly
people on several weeks.

From the results of questionnaires, there was evidence that
the characteristic pattern was influenced by a change of the
elderly people’s individual life environment. It was necessary
that the system could extract and keep in memory in the
supervisor unit several characteristic patterns as the environment
around the research subjects changed. Also, it was thought that
the characteristic pattern was influenced by the change of an
elderly individual’s weekly life style. Most of the elderly had
habits that given behaviors should be carried out on a certain day
of the week. For example, elderly people periodically went to
the bath of a public institution on particular day of the week.
In the experiments, several sensor units and a controller unit
with two antennas were set up in the houses of solitary elderly
people. The subjects were eight elderly people and the number
of sensor units was about 15 in each subject’s house. Figure 8
shows an illustration of the location of sensor units in an elderly
person’s house. The number of sensors increases or decreases
depending on the number of rooms and the layout of the house.
The experiment was carried out in two areas. The center of
Takaoka City and Oyama Town were chosen, in order to
examine whether the environment around the house was
significant or not. In each area, there were four subjects and one
supervisor unit. A supervisor unit was located at a public
institution within 1 km of the subjects’ houses in each area.
In addition to detected results, analysis was carried out with
the measured data using sensor units and the results of the
questionnaire. Then, using one result of the analysis, we
constructed a mathematical model using the neural networks
(NN). We investigated other result but one for constructing NN,
and realized that the system conjectures one elderly individual’s
behavior
of
a
day.
The
analyses
using
NN
software
(NEUROSIM: Fujitsu Co., Ltd) were used to conjecture whether
subjects were out or at home and were awake or in bed. In
analysis of subjects’ going out, we used Hierarchical Neural
Network including input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.
Thirty-five input signals were composed of detection results
from five pyroelectric infrared sensors at given times and around
30 minutes by 10 minutes. Output signal was the probability that
subjects went out. In analysis of going to bed, we constructed
hierarchical NN including input, output and two hidden layers.
Sixty-six input signals were composed of detection results from
five pyroelectric infrared sensors at given times, around
60 minutes by 10 minutes and clock time. Output signal was the
probability that subjects were at rest.

3.2 Results of verified experiments
Figure 9 is the example neural network model to analyze for
the probability of human behavior based on detections. The
neural network was constructed by three layer model. The first
layer contained 24 inputs. The second layer contained 24 nods.
The third layer contained 2 nods. The neural network model was
learned by data for two month for each subject.
Figure 10 shows a result for the probability that a subject
has gotten up in one day. Upper Figure 10(a) shows the
probability form only questionnaire. Lower Figure 10(b) shows
the probability form a neural network model similar to Figure 9.
In the questionnaire of the same day, the subject got up at
7:10AM and went to bed at 10:00PM. The probabilities were
about 0.003 at 7:00AM, 1.000 at 7:10AM, 9.999 at 10:00PM,
and 0.009 at 10:10PM. But the probability at 10:20PM was
0.289. Figure 11 shows one that a subject has gone out in one
day.
Figure 12 shows a summation of detection when a subject’s
condition was good in one day using the new support system. In
this result, the subject starts daily exercise at about 7:00 AM
every day. Especially, the behavior pattern was detected after
7:00 AM using the new support system. For another subject,
behavior pattern was detected each subject using the system.
These behavior pattern varied, but the behavior pattern was
unified by each subject like in Figure 11. Also, it seems that the
various related not environments but subjects. On the other hand,
Figure 13 shows a summation of detection when the same
subject’s condition above result was bad, because this results
were recorded just before this subject was hospitalized. In this

result, it is not sure when the subject starts daily exercise and
shows that the count of detection is lower level than the result of
Figure 12; but another behavior pattern was detected using the
new support system. For other subjects, behavior patterns were
detected each subject using the system. In Figure 13, the
behavior pattern is not the same to the behavior pattern in Figure
12 about the same subject. So, we ensure that a difference
between a behavior pattern for good health condition and a
behavior pattern for a bad health condition was detected using
this system. So, it is considered that it is possible to make a
judgment about elderly people’s health condition.
IV.
DISCUSSION
Using the new support system, it was possible to detect
elderly motions in life. The most important thing in this system
was to detect elderly ones with non-wearable sensors. In
addition, play-out and uplink of detected data were performed by
wireless connection between both sensor units and controller
unit, and between controller unit and supervisor unit. After
experiments, we constructed the neural network, and conjectured
elderly motion and individuals’ particular patterns. Results from
neural network analysis were correlated to detected motions and
questionnaire responses.
Recently, many companies have become interested in
remote sensing for elderly people’s healthcare and conducted
remote sensing with wearable sensors [10,11]. But, in this case,
there was physical limitation, and the elderly went about their
daily life with inconvenience and uncomfortable feeling. It was
an important advantage in this system that remote sensing was
performed by non-wearable sensors. In addition, we challenged
experiments with novelty, and measured many data at the same
time. Hence, this system was put to practical use, and we
obtained a patent for this system.
However, it has been pointed out that this result in sensing
humans was still not adequate. It is necessary to measure motions
more precisely, because what were detected in this experiment
were just motions. In terms of detecting going out, waking up,
and going to bed, it was thought to achieve a certain level of
result. However, it is requisite to measure subjects’ behaviors and
movements to observe heir daily life in the real sense of the term.
At the same time, human motion was not always considered as
measuring changes in their physical condition. In addition, this
system was developed with the aim of long-term health
management, which is detecting before deterioration of health.
This system appears very useful for daily checking based on this
standpoint. Additionally, it is thought to detect troubles in about
ten minutes by comparing usual patterns which was stored in the
controller
unit.
Furthermore,
a
system
corresponding
to
emergencies, for example falling, is still being developed. It is
absolutely imperative to upgrade this system for detecting the
physical condition.
In
our
laboratory,
we
are
continuing
research
and
development on the system to detect biological signals, for
example, heart rate, sphygmus, and body temperature by remote
sensing. By translating this system into practical applications,
there is a possibility that it would appear that early symptoms in
disorders can be detected by remote sensing. Thus, system
managers and the elderly themselves can prescribe measures.
Currently, we are working practical trial into operation, and lead
to the final step in this trial.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
For the purpose of practically applying our new system for
elderly people, questionnaires and two experiments were carried
out. From the results of the questionnaires, we realized that the
characteristic pattern was influenced by a change of the elderly’
individual life environment. Therefore, it was necessary that
several characteristic patterns be extracted and kept in the
memory of the supervisor unit in case the environmental
changed. In addition, from the experimental results, it was
ascertained that this support system could measure and analyze
elderly people’s behaviors. According to these results, it was
possible to watch closely the condition of the elderly people
from a distant public institution. These results indicated that the
system was useful for an elderly support.
Now, some functions of this system are used in at least
20,000 houses of the elderly people in Japan, and is playing
significant part in their life. Meanwhile, research on detecting
elderly’s physical condition by this system continues in our
laboratory [11].
