observed that the GMI effect and the magnetic softness of
microwires can be tailored by controlling the Magnetoelastic
anisotropy of as-prepared microwires. On the other hand, the
GMI ratio can be optimized selecting appropriate measuring
conditions, i.e., the measuring frequency.

INTRODUCTION
Studies of the Giant MagnetoImpedance (GMI) effect
have attracted considerable attention since its rediscovery
in 1994 in amorphous wires [1][2]. It is worth noting that
the first report on the change of impedance in permalloy
wires was published in 1936 [3]. However, GMI studies
become one of the most attractive topics of applied
magnetism owing to the development of amorphous
magnetically soft wires [4]-[8].
The main technological interest in the GMI effect is
related to one of the largest sensitivities to a magnetic field
(up to 10 %/A/m) among non-cryogenic effects [4]-[8].
Such features of the GMI effect make it quite attractive for
development
of
high
performance
sensors
allowing
detection of low magnetic fields and mechanical stresses
[9]-[14].
The most common quantity for the characterization of
the GMI effect is the GMI ratio, Z/Z, defined as:
Z/Z = [Z (H) - Z (Hmax)] / Z (Hmax)
(1)
where H is the applied axial Direct Current (DC)-field with
a maximum value, Hmax, up to a few kA/m.
The value of the GMI ratio and its magnetic field
dependence are determined by the type of magnetic
anisotropy: for achievement of high GMI ratio, the high
circumferential
magnetic
permeability
is
essentially
important [7][8]. Magnetic wires with circumferential easy
axis exhibit double-peak magnetic field dependence of the
real component of wire impedance (and, consequently, of
the GMI ratio). Magnetic wires with longitudinal easy axis
present monotonic decay of the GMI ratio with increasing
axial magnetic field with GMI ratio maximum at zero
magnetic field [7][8]. The highest GMI ratio up to 650% is
reported for amorphous microwires [15]-[17]. However,
theoretically predicted maximum GMI ratio is about
3000% (i.e., a few times larger than the GMI ratio values
reported experimentally) [18]. Additionally, the theoretical
minimum of the skin depth is about 0.3 μm [18][19].   
The main features of the GMI effect have been
successfully
explained
in
terms
of
classical
electrodynamics considering the influence of a magnetic
field on the penetration depth of an electrical current
flowing through the magnetically soft conductor [1][2].
High circumferential permeability typically observed in
Co-rich
amorphous
wires
with
nearly-zero
magnetostriction coefficient is essential for the observation
of a high GMI ratio [1][2][4]-[6]. However, similarly to the
magnetic permeability, the GMI effect has a tensor
character [4]-[6][20]-[22]. The off-diagonal component of
MagnetoImpedance (MI) can present anti-symmetrical
magnetic field dependence with a linear region quite
suitable for magnetic sensors applications [20]-[22].
One of the tendencies in modern GMI sensors is the size
reduction. It must be underlined that the diameter reduction
must be associated with the increasing of the optimal GMI
frequency
range:
a
tradeoff
between
dimension
and
frequency is required in order to obtain a maximum GMI
effect
[4]-[6][23].
Additionally,
the
GMI
effect
at
microwave frequencies has been described considering the
analogy between the GMI and the ferromagnetic resonance
[4]. Consequently, development of thin soft magnetic
materials required for miniaturization of the sensors and
devices requires an extension of the frequency range for the
impedance toward the higher frequencies (GHz range).
Depending on the frequency f of the driving AC
current Iac flowing through the sample, different GMI
regimes can be considered [4]-[6]:
1. Low frequency (1-10 kHz) range when the skin
depth is larger than the sample radius (weak skin effect).
The impedance changes in this frequency band are related

to a circular magnetization process exclusively and might
not be considered as the GMI effect.
2. At the frequency range from 10-100 kHz to 1-10
MHz (where the GMI effect has been first reported and
described), the GMI originates basically with the variation
of the skin penetration depth of magnetic conductor due to
strong changes of the magnetic permeability caused by a
DC magnetic field [1][2][4]-[6]. In this frequency band,
both domain walls movement and magnetization rotation
are considered as to be responsible for the variation of the
circular permeability and, hence, to the skin effect.
3. For the MHz band frequencies (from 1-10 MHz to
100-1000 MHz, depending on the geometry of the sample),
the GMI effect is also originated by the skin effect of the
soft magnetic conductor, i.e., must be attributed to the GMI.
However, at these frequencies, the domain walls are
strongly damped. Therefore, the magnetization rotation
must be considered as responsible for the magnetic
permeability change induced by an external magnetic field
[1][2][4]-[8].
4. At GHz frequencies, the magnetization rotation is
strongly influenced by the gyromagnetic effect. Increasing
the frequency, the GMI peaks are shifted to higher
magnetic fields values because the sample is magnetically
saturated. At this frequency range, strong changes of the
sample's
impedance
have
been
attributed
to
the
FerroMagnetic Resonance (FMR) [4]-[6][23].
Recently developed magnetic sensors using the GMI
effect allow achieving nT and pT magnetic field sensitivity
with low noise [10]-[14][24].
Presently, major attention is focused on high frequency
(GHz range) GMI applications owing to the development
of thin magnetically soft materials and the recent tendency
in miniaturization of magnetic field sensors [4]-[6][10]-
[14][24].
The aim of this report is to provide recent results on the
optimization of soft magnetic properties and of the GMI
effect in magnetic microwires.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II,
we
present
the
description
of
the
experimental
techniques, while in Section III, we describe the results on
the effect of post-processing on the GMI ratio of studied
microwires. We conclude the paper in Section IV.
II.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
As already mentioned in the introduction, the GMI effect
usually
observed
in
soft
magnetic
materials
phenomenologically
consists
of
the
change
of
the
Alternating Current (AC) impedance, Z = R + iX (where R
is the real part, or resistance, and X is the imaginary part, or
reactance), when submitted to an external magnetic field,
H0.
The electrical impedance, Z, of a magnetic conductor is
given by [1][2]:

with k = (1 + j)/ where J0 and J1 are the Bessel functions,
r is the wire’s radius and  the penetration depth given by:
 = ( f)-1/2
(3)
where  is the electrical conductivity, f the frequency of the
current along the sample, and  the circular magnetic
permeability assumed to be scalar. The DC applied
magnetic field introduces significant changes in the circular
permeability, . Therefore, the penetration depth also
changes through and finally results in a change of Z [1][2].
The GMI ratio, Z/Z, has been evaluated considering
(1).
In ferromagnetic materials with high circumferential
anisotropy (the case of magnetic wires), the magnetic
permeability possesses tensor nature and the classic form of
impedance definition is not valid. The relation between the
electric field, e , (which determines the voltage) and the
magnetic field, h, (which determines the current) is defined
through the surface impedance tensor, ˆ , [20]-[22][25]:

The circular magnetic fields h are produced by the
currents iw running through the wire. At the wire surface hz
= i/2πr, where r is the wire radius. The longitudinal
magnetic fields hz are produced by the currents ic running
through the exciting coil, hz = N1ic, where N1 is the exciting
coil number of turns. Various excitation and measurement
methods are required to reveal the impedance matrix
elements. The longitudinal and circumferential electrical
field on the wire surface can be measured as voltage drop
along the wire, vw, and voltage induced in the pickup coil,
vc, wound on it [20]-[22][25].

sectional magnetization process (hmz and hzm) [20]-
[22][25].
The use of a specially designed micro-strip sample
holder (see Figure 1c) placed inside a sufficiently long
solenoid
allows
measuring
of
the
magnetic
field
dependence of sample impedance, Z, using a vector
network analyzer from the reflection coefficient S11 using
the expression:
Z=Z0(1+S11)/(1−S11)
(8)
where Z0=50 Ohm is the characteristic impedance of the
coaxial
line
[26].
The
described
technique
allows
measuring of the GMI effect in extended frequency, f,
range up to GHz frequencies.
Hysteresis
loops
have
been
measured
using
the
fluxmetric method previously described elsewhere [27]. We
represent the normalized magnetization, M/M0 versus the
magnetic field, H, where M is the magnetic moment at a
given magnetic field and M0 is the magnetic moment of the
sample at the maximum magnetic field amplitude, Hm.
We studied Fe- and Co- rich microwires with metallic
nucleus diameters, d, ranging from 10 up to 25 m
prepared using the Taylor-Ulitovsky method described
elsewhere [5][8]. The Taylor-Ulitovsky method allows
preparation
of
thinnest
metallic
wires
(with
typical
diameters of the order of 1 to 30 μm) covered by an 
insulating glass coating [5][8].
The great advantage of these microwires is that the
obtained
diameter
could
be
significantly
reduced
in
comparison with the case of amorphous wires produced by
the other rapidly quenching methods.
However, in the case of glass-coated microwires, the
magnetoelastic
anisotropy
contribution
is
even
more
relevant since the preparation process involves not only the
rapid quenching itself, but also simultaneous solidification
of the metallic nucleus surrounded by the glass-coating
with
rather
different
thermal
expansion
coefficients
[5][8][28]-[30]. The strength of internal stresses, σi, is
basically affected by three main factors:
i) quenching
stresses associated to the melt quenching of the metallic
alloy; ii) stresses related to the different thermal expansion
coefficients of metallic ingot and glass simultaneously
solidifying and iii) stresses associated to the drawing of
solidifying wire [28]-[30].
In
amorphous
materials,
the
magnetocrystalline
anisotropy
is
absent.
Therefore,
the
magnetoelastic
anisotropy is the main factor affecting the magnetic
properties [5][6].
The magnetoelastic anisotropy, Kme, is given as:
Kme=3/2λSσi
(9)
where λS is the magnetostriction coefficient and σi is the
internal stresses value [8].
The magnetostriction coefficient, λs, value in amorphous
alloys can be tailored by the chemical composition [31]-
[34]. Generally, Fe-rich compositions present positive λs -
values (typically λs ≈ 20 - 40 x 10−6), while for the Co-rich
alloys, λs –values are negative, typically λs ≈ -5 to - 3 x 
10−6. Vanishing λs –values can be achieved in the CoxFe1-x
(0≤x ≤1) or CoxMn1-x (0≤x ≤1) systems at x about 0,03 – 
0,08 [31]-[34].
However,
the
internal
stresses,
σi,
arise
during
simultaneous
rapid
quenching
of
metallic
nucleus
surrounding by the glass coating due to the different
thermal expansion coefficients. Consequently, the strength
of internal stresses can be controlled by glass-coating
thickness: the strength of internal stresses increases with
the increasing of the glass-coating thickness [28]-[30][35].
III.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As mentioned above, the magnitude and the magnetic
field dependence of the GMI effect (including off-diagonal
components)
is
intrinsically
linked
to
the
magnetic
anisotropy [4]-[8]. Magnetoelastic anisotropy is the main
source of magnetic anisotropy of amorphous microwires

Accordingly,
both
hysteresis
loops,
Z/Z(H)
dependence and maximum value of GMI ratio, Z/Zm, are
affected by λs sign and value and by the magnitude of
internal stresses, σi. The magnetostriction coefficient
drastically affects the character of the hysteresis loops of
magnetic microwires: i) Co-rich microwires (see Figure 2a
for Co77.5Si15B7.5) with negative magnetostriction constant
(λs≈-5x10-6) have almost unhysteretic loops with extremely
low coercivity, Hc. However, the magnetic permeability of
Co77.5Si15B7.5 microwire is not high enough since they also
present high enough magnetic anisotropy field, Hk. ii) Co-
Fe-based
microwires
with
vanishing
magnetostriction
constant (Co67.1Fe3.8Ni1.4Si14.5B11.5Mo1.7, λs≈-10-7) generally
present lower Hk –values and, hence, higher magnetic
permeability.
iii)
Finally,
Fe-rich
microwires
(Fe75B9Si12C4)
with
positive
magnetostriction
constant
(λs≈40x10-6) present rectangular hysteresis loops and,
consequently, low magnetic permeability.
As
can
be
appreciated
from
Figure
3b,
Co67.1Fe3.8Ni1.4Si14.5B11.5Mo1.7
microwire
presents
the
highest maximum GMI ratio, Z/Zm (about 240% at 500
MHz).
Quite
low
Z/Zm
–values
are
observed
for
Fe75B9Si12C4 microwire (Z/Zm ≈15%, see Figure. 3c). 
Moderate Z/Zm –values (Z/Zm ≈120%) are observed for 
Co77.5Si15B7.5 microwire (see Figure 3a).
The other difference in Z/ZH) dependencies for
microwires with different magnetostriction coefficients is
the character of Z/Z(H) dependencies: for microwire with
λs>0 a single maximum Z/Z(H) dependence with Z/Z
maximum at H=0 is observed (Figure 3c). However, for
λs<0 double- maximum Z/Z(H) dependencies with Z/Z
maximum at H=Hm are observed (Figures 3b,c).
It
is
commonly
assumed
that
the
Hm
-value
corresponding to the peaks (maximum ΔZ/Z - value) is
linked to the average value of the anisotropy field, HK, at
high frequency values, and to the effective anisotropy
distribution in the sample. In this regard, observed Z/Z(H)
dependencies correlate with hysteresis loops: the highest
Hm –value is observed for Co77.5Si15B7.5 microwire with the
highest Hk –value (see Figure 2a). A single maximum
Z/Z(H)
dependence
with
Z/Z
maximum
at
H=0
corresponds to Fe75B9Si12C4 microwire with axial magnetic
anisotropy (Figure 2c).
Such different magnetic anisotropy of microwires with
positive and negative magnetostriction is related to the
internal stresses distribution, intrinsically related to the
fabrication of microwires [4]-[8]. The radial distribution of
internal
stresses,
is
calculated
considering
quenching
stresses related to rapid quenching of the metallic alloy
from the melt, as well as, complex tensor stresses related
with the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of
metal and glass, the axial stresses are the largest ones up to
~ 0.85 R (where R is the metallic nucleus radius) [8]. Thus,
the main volume of the microwire nucleus is under the
tensile stresses near the axis of the metallic nucleus.
However, closer to the surface the compressive stresses are
dominant. Additionally, the strength of internal stresses is
determined by the thickness of non-magnetic glass-coating:

the
strength
of
internal
stresses
increases
with
the
increasing of the glass-coating thickness.
Therefore, as reported earlier [5][8], hysteresis loops
and the GMI effect are affected by the ratio ρ=d/D, where
d is the diameter of metallic nucleus and D-total microwire
diameter. Some of the examples are shown in Figure 4,
where the hysteresis loops and Z/Z(H) dependencies of
as-prepared Co67Fe3.85Ni1.45B11.5Si14.5Mo1.7 microwires with
different ρ–ratios are shown.
Consequently,
the
control
of internal
stresses
by
tailoring of the ρ–ratio is the effective method for the GMI
ratio tuning.
As mentioned above, the other important parameter for
the GMI ratio optimization in magnetic microwires is the
frequency. Indeed, the frequency must be high enough in
order to have the skin depth lower than the sample radius
(strong skin effect).

(d=25.6 m, D= 26.6 m) microwires are shown in Figure
5a. This composition at given geometry (d=25.6 m, D=
26.6 m, ρ=0.96) present high maximum GMI ratio, 
Z/Zm: at the optimal frequency of about 300 MHz, Z/Zm
≈550% can be achieved (see Figure 5b). However, thinner 
(d=10.8 μm) microwire of the same chemical composition 
at this frequency exhibit Z/Zm ≈400% (see Figure 5b).

for
Co67.7Fe4.3Ni1.6Si11.2B12.4C1.5Mo1.3
microwires
with
d=10.8μm and d=25.6 m we can appreciate that for
Co67.7Fe4.3Ni1.6Si11.2B12.4C1.5Mo1.3
microwires
with
d=10.8μm the optimal frequency is about 700 MHz, at 
which Z/Zm ≈550% can be achieved. 
The aforementioned examples provide the routes for
optimization of the GMI effect in Co-rich microwires.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we measured the GMI magnetic field,
frequency dependencies and hysteresis loops in magnetic
microwires produced by the Taylor-Ulitovsky technique.
We observed that the GMI effect and magnetic softness
of the microwires are intrinsically related and can be
tailored either by controlling the magnetoelastic anisotropy
of as-prepared microwires or by controlling their internal
stresses and
structure by heat treatment. Studies of
magnetic properties and the GMI effect of amorphous Co-
Fe rich microwires reveal that, by selecting an appropriate
chemical composition and geometry, they present GMI
effect at GHz frequencies. High GMI effect has been
achieved and discussed. The selection of appropriate
measuring conditions can be beneficial for optimization of
the GMI effect of magnetic microwires.
