Abstract—Inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) is con-
sidered to be a promising technique for Long Term Evolution
(LTE) to increase spectral efﬁciency. One efﬁcient approach for
ICIC is Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR). In this paper, we consider a
call admission control in SFR-based systems and derive the call
blocking and forced termination probabilities using a Markov
chain analysis. In addition, SFR with spectrum handoff, called
S-SFR, is proposed. Numerical results show that the analytic
derivations are valid, and the proposed scheme outperforms the
SFR scheme without spectrum handoff for the forced termination
probability.
Keywords- call admission control; inter-cell interference;
soft frequency reuse; Markov chain; spectrum handoff.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Third Generation Partnership Project-Long Term Evo-
lution (3GPP-LTE) system has focused on several interfer-
ence management schemes for improving system performance.
These schemes include an optimized frequency allocation
policy based on semi-static radio resource management ap-
proaches, optimal power assignment and control schemes, and
smart antenna techniques to null interference from other cells
[2]. In particular, a Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) scheme
has been proposed for 3GPP-LTE systems as an inter-cell
interference coordination (ICIC) technique [3].
There are two major variants of FFR, which are static FFR
and adaptive FFR. Static FFR includes pre-planned Frequency
Reuse factor 1 (FR1) scheme, or FR3 scheme, or a combina-
tion of these schemes, such as Fractional Reuse Partitioning
(FRP). Further improvements can be achieved by dynamically
adapting FFR with techniques such as Soft Frequency Reuse
(SFR).
In FRP and SFR, a cell is divided into two regions,
namely the cell-center zone and the cell-edge zone. The cell-
center users arriving in the cell-center zone utilizes the entire
frequency band, whereas the cell-edge users arriving in the
cell-edge zone operate in a sub-band using an FR 3 scheme,
as shown in ﬁgure 1. Thus, the effective overall frequency
reuse factor is still close to ensuring a high spectral efﬁciency
[4]. SFR differs from FRP as follows. Because the cell-center
users share bandwidth with neighboring cells, they typically
transmit at lower power levels than the cell-edge users in SFR,

as shown in ﬁgure 1. It is possible that when no resources for
the cell-edge users are available, the eNodeB (base station)
forcibly terminates (preemption) one of the cell-center users
that occupies resources of a sub-band with an FR 3 if any
such user exists[1].
In [1], a Markov chain model with 3-dimensional state
variables was proposed to describe the call admission control
(CAC) in SFR-based LTE systems. Throughout this model, the
authors evaluated the system performance in terms of the call
blocking probability and the forced termination probability.
When comparing SFR with static FFR using FR 3, the call
blocking probability of SFR is lower than that of static FFR.
However, SFR suffers from a non-zero forced termination
probability. From the user’s point of view, the forced termi-
nation of an ongoing call is signiﬁcantly less desirable than
blocking of a new call attempt [5].
In this paper, we propose a SFR with the spectrum handoff
technique, called S-SFR. For the spectrum handoff technique,
when cell-center users using cell-center resources are released,

a cell-center ongoing call occupying the cell-edge resource
can be reconnected using the cell-center resource. Thus, by
reducing the number of the cell-center users utilizing cell-edge
resources, we can reduce the amount of forced termination of
the cell-center users. Speciﬁcally, we describe the CAC for
S-SFR and provide a 2- dimensional Markov chain analysis,
where the state variables are the number of cell-center users
and cell-edge users. This scheme is similar to channel reser-
vation used in circuit-switched networks [8].
Additionally, we compare the performances of S-SFR, SFR,
and FRP schemes, where each scheme is summarized as shown
in Table 1.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present
the system model. In section 3, we introduce an analytic model
for the evaluation of performance of SFR based LTE systems.
Section 4 presents numerical results, and concluding remarks
are given in section 5.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
A. Model Description
An SFR-based LTE system is considered. There is one
eNodeB in the center of the cell. In this paper, user equipments
(UEs) located in the cell-center zone or the cell-edge zones
are called cell-center UEs or cell-edge UEs, respectively. A
number of UEs can initiate multiple calls trying to occupy
radio resources, where the basic unit of radio resources is
referred to as Physical Resource Block (PRB).
We assume that there are C PRBs that consists of Cc cell-
center PRBs and Ce cell-edge PRBs, where Cc = C − Ce.
For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the eNodeB can
only assign one PRB to the UE at the time it initiates a call
and, via an appropriate power allocation, the data rate of each
call with one PRB is ﬁxed regardless of its location within the
cell.
As mentioned in [1], the data rate of the UE can be
maintained using two approaches. First, more than one PRB
can be allocated to the UE. Second, appropriate powers are
allocated to the PRBs. Thus, the co-channel interference from
adjacent cells can be minimized. Hence, the data rate of the
UE can be guaranteed. In our model, it is assumed that, via
an appropriate power allocation scheme, the data rate of each
UE with one PRB is ﬁxed regardless of its location within the
cell.
B. New Call Arrival Processes and Call Duration Time
Traditionally, since CAC schemes have been based on call-
level QoS measures, such as call blocking and dropping
probabilities for voice or data, we assume that the eNodeB
serves voice trafﬁc call [6,7]. We also assume that the new
call arrival process within a cell is a Poisson process with a
mean request rate of λ calls/sec, and the UEs are uniformly
distributed over the cell. Let ω be the ratio of the area of the
cell-edge zone to the total area of the cell. The new call arrival
rates of the cell-center UE and cell-edge UE are assumed to
be λc = (1−ω)λ and λe = ωλ, respectively. The call duration
time is assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean µ−1
sec.

III. SOFT FREQUENCY REUSE WITH SPECTRUM
HANDOFF
A. Call Admission Control
When a new call from the cell-center UE (cell-center call)
is initiated, it will attempt to occupy a cell-center PRB. If one
or more cell-center PRBs are available, it will be admitted. If
no cell-center PRB is available, then it will further attempt to
occupy a cell-edge PRB. It will be blocked once no cell-edge
PRB is available. When a cell-center call occupying a cell-
center PRB is released, a cell-center ongoing call occupying
a cell-edge PRB is reconnected using a released PRB. This is
called spectrum handoff.
When a new call from the cell-edge UE (cell-edge call) is
initiated, it will attempt to occupy a cell-edge PRB. At this
time, if all cell-edge PRBs are in use by cell-edge ongoing
calls, the call will be blocked. If at least one cell-edge PRB is
available, it will be admitted. If no cell-edge PRB is available,
but one or more cell-edge PRBs are occupied by cell-center
ongoing calls, one of the cell-center calls is randomly chosen
and forced to release the cell-edge PRB it is occupying. The
released PRB is then assigned to the newly arriving cell-
edge call. The probability that the cell-center call is forcibly
terminated is referred to as the forced termination probability.
B. Trafﬁc Analysis
Assuming the characteristics of trafﬁc, the process of PRB
occupation can be modeled as a continuous time Markov
chain. For CAC of S-SFR, the state transition diagram is
described by an integer pair (i, j), as shown in ﬁgure 2, where
i and j denote the number of cell-center calls and cell-edge
calls, respectively. As the cell-edge UEs have priority to utilize
the cell-edge PRBs, the cell-center UEs utilizing the cell-edge
PRBs can be preempted by the cell-edge UEs. Depending on
the existence of the cell-center UE occupying the cell-edge
PRB, a forced termination in state (i, j) can move the state
to (i − 1, j + 1), where i is greater than Cc. This is because
there are only cell-center UEs occupying cell-edge PRB by
spectrum handoff.
Let P(i, j) be the state probability. From ﬁgure 2, the
following set of balance equations can be obtained:
(i) Four extreme points:
(λc + λe)P(0, 0) = µP(1, 0) + µP(0, 1)
(λc + Ceλe)P(0, Ce) = λcP(0, Ce − 1) + µP(1, Ce)
(Cc + Ce)µP(Cc, Ce) = λcP(Cc − 1, Ce)
+ λeP(Cc, Ce − 1) + λeP(Cc + 1, Ce − 1)
(λe + Cµ)P(C, 0) = λeP(C − 1, 0)
(ii) i = 0, 0 < j < Ce:
(λc + λe + jµ)P(0, j) = λeP(0, j − 1)
+ (j + 1)µP(0, j + 1) + µP(1, j)
(iii) 0 < i < C, j = 0:
(λc + λe + iµ)P(i, 0) = λcP(i − 1, 0)
+ λeP(i, 1) + (i + 1)µP(i + 1, 0)
(iv) 0 < i < Cc, j = Ce:
(λc + iµ + Ceµ)P(i, Ce) = λcP(i − 1, Ce)
+ λeP(i, Ce − 1) + (i + 1)µP(i + 1, Ce)
(v) 0 < i < C, 0 < j < Ce:
(λc + λe + iµ + jµ)P(i, j) = λcP(i − 1, j) + λeP(i, j − 1)
+ (i + 1)µP(i + 1, j) + (j + 1)µP(i, j + 1)
(vi) Cc < i < C, 0 < j < Ce, i + j = C:
(λc + iµ + jµ)P(i, j) = λcP(i − 1, j)
+ λeP(i, j − 1) + λeP(i + 1, j − 1)
(1)
P(i, j) can be found by solving the balance equations
together with the following normalization condition:
X
i
X
j
P(i, j) = 1.
(2)
C. Performance Measures
As performance measures, we consider the aggregate call
blocking and forced termination probabilities.
From P(i, j), the call blocking probabilities of the cell-
center UE and the cell-edge UE are, respectively,
PBc =
C
X
i=Cc
P(i, C − i),
PBe =
Cc
X
i=0
P(i, Ce).
(3)
From (3), we can calculate the aggregate call blocking
probability as follows
PB = (1 − ω) · PBc + ω · PBe.
(4)
For the forced termination probability, Pf, it is the total UE
forced termination rate divided by the total UE connection
rate. That is,
Pf =
λe
C
X
i=Cc+1
P(i, C − i)
λ(1 − PB)
.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we present the simulation results and com-
pare them with our analysis. For all results, it is assumed that
C = 48 and Ce = C/3. In ﬁgures 3 and 4, the curves are
numerically obtained from the equations given in the preceding
analysis, whereas the symbols indicated the corresponding
simulation results.
Figures 3(a)-(c) show the call blocking probabilities of the
center-, edge-, and aggregate-UE with respect to different
values of ω. These numerical examples show that the results
of our analysis closely approximate those of the simulations.
In ﬁgures 3(a)-(c), as the value of ω decreases, the call
blocking probabilities of the edge- and the aggregate-UE tend
to decrease, whereas the blocking probability of the center-UE
increases. This is because as ω decreases, the number of UEs
arriving in the edge area decreases, and thus the number of

that as the value of ω increases, the difference of the call
blocking probabilities between the center- and the edge-UE
increases rapidly. We note that the center- and edge-calls are
not evenly blocked. The reason is that the cell-edge PRBs are
more heavily utilized than the cell-center PRBs.
Figure 4 shows the forced termination probability for S-
SFR. It is observed that the results of the mathematical analysis
agree reasonably well with those of the simulations. Figure 4
also shows that Pf increases as ω decreases. This is because
as ω decreases, the number of cell-center UEs increases, thus
leading to the decrement of terminated cell-center calls. When
ω is very small, Pf decreases, because the number of cell-edge

Additionally, we compare the performance of S-SFR, SFR,
and FRP schemes.
Figures 5(a)-(c) show the effect of ω on the aggregate
call blocking probabilities for S-SFR, SFR, and FRP. As ω
decreases, the aggregate call blocking probabilities of S-SFR,
SFR, and FRP tend to decrease. We observed that the call
blocking probabilities of both S-SFR and SFR are less than
that of FRP. This is because the call blocking probability of
the cell-edge UE in SFR-based schemes is decreased by using
the forced termination of the cell-center UE using a cell-edge
PRB.

probabilities for S-SFR and FRP schemes. From this ﬁgure, we
note that the performance of the cell-edge call is improved for
S-SFR by using the channel assignment as forced termination
technique.
Figure 7 shows the effect of the spectrum handoff tech-
nique on the forced termination probabilities for S-SFR and
SFR. Because FRP does not consider the forced termination
technique, Pf is 0. From this ﬁgure, we note that the forced
termination probability of S-SFR is less than that of SFR.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we considered a call admission control in
SFR-based systems and derived the call blocking and forced
termination probabilities using a Markov chain analysis. In
addition, SFR with spectrum handoff, called S-SFR, have
proposed. The analytical results show good agreement with
the simulations. Numerical comparisons among S-SFR, SFR,
and FRP schemes have shown that there are differences in the
call blocking and forced termination probabilities. By using
the forced termination technique, we have shown that S-SFR
and SFR have decreased the call blocking probability. For cell-
edge calls, these schemes provide an improved call blocking
probability. We have also shown that by using spectrum
handoff, the forced termination probability of S-SFR is less
than that of SFR.
One of the possible research topics is to consider a SFR-
based cellular system in the interference scenario. In reality,
the system throughput may be calculated by the signal to
interference ratio, depending on the level of interference power
received from neighboring cell. Therefore, it is worthwhile to
study the cases where one UE or BS may have interference
signals from neighboring BSs or other UEs.
