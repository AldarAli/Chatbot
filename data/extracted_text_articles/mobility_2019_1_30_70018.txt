Abstract—In this paper the spectrum sharing has been 
analyzed as a viable alternative to increase the mobile systems 
capacity, in order to satisfy the growing demand for these 
services. In this paper, the television white spaces and the C 
band are analyzed as potential spectrum candidate to 
implement sharing spectrum schemes in México. Using their 
geographical localization, some cities along the Mexican 
territory are evaluated to determine viability and impact. The 
evaluation 
was 
done 
considering 
some 
International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommendations, applying 
technical parameters to calculate coverage area protection and 
potential data rates.  
Keywords- Sharing spectrum; C band; TVWS. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION. 
Around the world, more and more spectrum is demanded 
to satisfy the exponential wireless services growing; the 
actual wireless networks need to be updated to satisfy the 
QoS demanded by the new services.   
As alternative to contribute to fulfill that demand, the 
implementation of dynamic spectrum sharing technics are a 
possible alternative. The spectrum sharing could be defined 
as the scenario where two or more radio systems are using 
the same frequency band to receive and/or transmit [2]; one 
of the users is defined as primary user, and the other(s) are 
named as secondary user(s). The spectrum sharing could be 
implemented using the so called technology Cognitive Radio 
(CR). The CR allows that a secondary user can utilize a 
spectrum space (named as White Space), while the spectrum 
is unused by the primary user. However, the CR 
implementation is not an easy assignment; there is needed 
that the electronic receiver/transmitter has the capacity to 
sense and known the environment where the device is 
operating; sensing the spectrum, the device could detect 
some spectrum portion unused (WS). Once these WS was 
detected, an algorithm to enable the receiving/transmitting 
capacity could start, defining the technical parameter to 
proceed with the link operation. Once the sharing spectrum is 
operating, one of the most important requirements is that the 
secondary users will not interfere to the primary user 
operation.  
From a regulatory point of view, actually there is not a 
regulation or rules proposal for a CR system operation. The 
development, implementation and effectiveness of the CR 
systems in a middle or long term, will depend of the markets 
evolution, trials results, as well as from the generation and 
demand for new applications and new chain values. 
Basically, CR exploit that some frequency bands are 
unused 
in 
some 
time 
intervals 
during 
the 
transmission/reception process. However, the CR in not the 
only way to implement the spectrum sharing strategy. The 
operation of some actual wireless systems where the 
frequencies bands are unused in some geographical region, 
open new ways to develop and operate a spectrum sharing 
strategy.   
Traditionally, the spectrum offered for wireless services 
and applications has two options: 
 
 
Licensed Frequency bands. 
 
Free frequency bands.  
 
The technological improvements allows mixed models, 
allowing 
share 
spectrum 
with 
several 
operational 
requirements. Some of these models are the Licensed 
Sharing Access (LSA) and the Opportunistic Spectrum 
Access (OSA).  
Trials for sharing spectrum in 2.3 GHz band had been 
implemented in Finland [14], using a LSA between wireless 
cameras (PMSE, Programming-making and special events), 
and mobile operators networks (MNO). The 2.3 GHz 
frequency band could be used by MNO when wireless 
cameras (incumbents) do not require it, which is often the 
case in many geographical locations in Finland. To enable 
the control links coordination a geolocation databases can be 
used. A similar trial in Rome, Italy was implemented; the 
Italian Ministry of Economic Development and the Joint 
Research Centre of the European Commission have stated a 
pilot project on the sharing of the radio spectrum in the 2.3-
2.4 GHz band, using the LSA alternative too. 
The geo-localized databases used, is one of the most 
cited alternative in several trials and proofs around the 
world; in a sharing spectrum system using a geo-localized 
database, the potential secondary user can verify the WS 
spectrum available around their geo-graphical position, by 
accessing to geo-localized database, where all the technical 
information regarding to the licensed frequencies are saved. 
There 
are 
several 
specialists 
and 
international 
organizations showing a skeptical position regarding to the 
benefits that spectrum sharing could offer. For one side, they   
see as a good point that an operator could access to more 
spectrum to increase their capacity to offer services; at the 
same time, they see as a risk that an operator could

monopolize the market, accessing to more and more 
spectrum.  
The licensed operation, regulatory aspects, and very clear 
and pragmatics rules are recommended as a base to evolution 
a sharing spectrum alternatives, operating always as a 
complementary strategy to access for more spectrum. 
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), has 
stablished some guidelines for spectrum sharing using 
technologies applying CR [4][5]. According with the ITU, a 
CR system could defined as a radio system that use some 
technology to get knowledge about their environment and 
operational conditions, over the operation rules stablished 
and the protocols used, so that the predefined objectives be 
achieved; at the same time, the system are capable to learn 
from the obtained results. In general, a CR system can: 
a) 
Get information from the surrounding environment. 
b) 
Make 
decisions 
and 
adjust 
their 
operation 
conditions. 
c) 
Learn from the obtained results. 
According with GSMA, the sharing spectrum is defined 
as the collective use of an electromagnetic spectrum portion 
by two or more users. From a regulatory point of view, the 
sharing mechanism could be licensed or not [1]. 
The paper is organized as next: In Section II a State of 
Art is exposed, and some studies and results around the 
world are cited. In III the TVWS for Mexico are analyzed as 
a potential resource for spectrum sharing alternative, using 
the TVWS spectrum available in the country; data rates and 
population coverage are estimated. In section IV the ITU 
recommendation are applied to calculate the exclusion area 
for the C Band earth stations located in Mexico; then, using 
the data obtained, an estimation about the amount of 
potential cities that could use the C band for sharing 
spectrum applications are obtained.  
 
II. 
STATE OF ART. 
 
Actually, around the world there are several studies and 
trials analyzing and evaluating the TVWS as an alternative to 
provide mobile and fixed wireless services, additional to the 
WiFi and cellular networks. The TV White Spaces (TVWS) 
spectrum offers a lot of advantages in enhancing the mobile 
systems capacity; in [16] TVWS capability is explored for 
rural areas to provide internet access, addressing the problem 
by mean of distance distribution to provide a good quality of 
service.  In [15], a field trial results for a WiFi based 
spectrum sharing technology in TVWS is detailed; the trial 
use a Dynamic Spectrum Management (DMS) platform and 
was dome in Melville, NY, in the USA. In [17], a network 
architecture integrated by an hybrid TVWS and WiFi 
backhaul is described. The application of cognitive radio 
system concepts for the off-loading operation of Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) networks by the opportunistic use of the 
TVWS are described in [18]. 
Regarding satellite C bands sharing spectrum, in [12], a 
sharing spectrum between IMT (International Mobile 
Telecommunication) 2000 (Wimax) and satellite networks 
systems operating in the C band is detailed; the study 
conclude that this sharing scheme could be viable in regions 
where there is low density of earth station deployments 
(typically rural zones).  In [17] spectrum sharing between 
heterogeneous systems, such cellular systems, radars and 
satellite is studied, showing that an exclusion zones are 
required to protect the satellite services. The conventional 
and extended C-band fixed satellite service (FSS) are 
considered. 
The present paper evaluate the spectrum sharing 
alternative to increase the spectrum available for wireless 
services in Mexico; the ITU recommendation were applied 
for the available TVWS spectrum. Also, the exclusion areas 
for the C band earth stations in México are calculated; using 
these data, the sharing spectrum impact for some cities along 
the country are evaluated, considering the potential 
inhabitants that could be coverage. 
III. 
TVWS IN MEXICO  
For Mexico, the TVWS as a resource for additional 
spectrum in sharing schemes could be a viable alternative; 
the TVWS could be a very important source for extra 
spectrum in several terrestrial wireless systems. The total 
TVWS spectrum available was estimated for all the Mexican 
states; the values are showed in Figure 1. As many other 
countries, in Mexico some rural regions have low internet 
services access. This fact represent one of the most important 
challenge to solve for the government; regarding the Internet 
access, in Table I, the Internet access for some states are 
listed; as we can see, there are states with less than 30% 
internet access for the rural population.  
Using the data provided, the TVWS spectrum for the 
states listed in Table I are added. A spectrum scheme that 
allows to use these spectrum, could be a mean to contribute 
to find a solution for the internet access in rural zones.

TVWS spectrum. Mexican states. 
 
Focusing in the rural access, in Table I are showed the 
internet access percentage for urban and rural population in 
some states, showing the spectrum available by TVWS too. 
A sharing spectrum approach using the TVWS available 
could be an option to improve the internet access (rates and 
penetration) for the people of these states.  
 
For a rural scenario, e.g., Chiapas state, a geographical 
spectrum sharing strategy is analyzed. The total TVWS 
channels for this state is almost seven channels; using the

ITU-802.22 wireless standard, with a 6 MHz channel 
bandwidth, an antenna high of 10m, Effective Isotropic 
Radiated Power (EIRP) of 40 mW, the coverage distance and 
the data rate was calculated; the obtained values are showed 
in Table II.

Nevertheless, most of the trials reported have been 
implemented in rural zones, the TVWS could be a very 
useful option to support the urban Cellular and WiFi 
networks during peak hours operation (typically a network 
saturation issue). One alternative is to use the spectrum 
offered by TVWS to implement an offloading scheme.  
 
The offloading alternative allows relieving a congested 
mobile data network with additional capacity from TVWS 
spectrum available might be a useful tool to contribute for 
the networks saturation problem).

In Table III are listed 9 urban cities located along the 
Mexican territory, indicating the average TVWS spectrum 
available for each state. There are indicated the available 
data rate for each city with 4G technology, the TVWS 
available (MHz), (in parenthesis there are indicated the 
continuous spectrum available), the antenna technology 
available, and in the last column, the potential data rate is 
estimated using the data collected in [19] using the TVWS 
available.

Analyzing an hypothetical offloading scheme impact 
applying the TVWS available for each city, in the same 
Table are showed the additional data rate achieved using the 
TVWS spectrum available; the data rate obtained was 
calculated using the continuous spectrum available (value 
between parenthesis), by simulation applying the parameters 
for the 802.22 standard. As we can see, the offloading 
alternative using the available TVWS spectrum could be a 
potential option to increase the cellular networks capacity. 
IV. 
C BAND IN MEXICO  
The C band (3.4-4.2 GHz) and the extended C band (3.4-
3.7GHz), are mainly used for fixed satellite services (FSS). 
The sharing spectrum alternative in these bands for use in 
mobile terrestrial services is an open dilemma; there are 
some critics regarding to the implementation, and others that 
support the idea.  
 
Among the supporters are the mobile services operators, 
showing and detailing analysis and operational conditions to 
justify it; at the other side, the satellite operators basically 
argue that the potential interference generated from a mobile 
terrestrial 
applications 
will 
cause 
a 
serious 
signal 
degradation, that could cause severe damage over the 
satellite link. In general, the satellite receiver must be 
designed with a higher sensibility, in order to detect the 
small power signals delivered from the satellites; this high 
sensitivity represent a big challenge for a spectrum sharing 
spectrum scheme.  
 
The ITU-R P.452-12 stablishes the operational conditions 
for a satellite base station in order to allow the spectrum 
sharing alternative with terrestrial services; these conditions 
are defined for the 100 MHz to 205 GHz band. In [12], are

exposed an analysis applying the propagation models 
described in ITU-R P.452-12. 
 
For the long term cases, the propagation is calculated over 
a smooth earth surface, utilizing the propagation model 
described in section 4.3 of the ITU-R P.452-12; this model 
includes the effects of building loses and clutter and the 
topography of the surrounding obstacles. 
 
For the short-term propagation, the ducting mode of 
propagation model described in section 4.5 of the same 
recommendation had been utilized. Applying the before 
mentioned propagation models, the minimum separation 
distance between and FSS station and a Base Station were 
estimated. The obtained values are showed in Table IV. 
With the delimited protection areas, and considering the 
geographical coordinates for all the satellite earth station 
operating in Mexico in the C and Extended C band, an 
estimation was done for the potential cities where these 
bands could be available to implement a sharing spectrum 
scheme. 
 
Using the geographical satellite earth station localization 
for 210 stations in Mexico, a sample for cities with more 
than 5000 inhabitants were evaluates to determine if these 
cities are localized inside or not, of the coverage protection 
area defined for any satellite earth station. The analysis was 
focused on the states with more rural population (and less 
earth station density).  
 
In Figure 2 there is showed a graphic representation for 
the Chiapas state evaluation. The earth stations were 
localized over the map, and a coverage area was determined 
for each station; this area was calculated using the minimum 
distance required to avoid harmful interference (Table III).

Coverage area for satellite earth stations for Chiapas. 
 
According to separation distance around the satellite 
earth station showed in Table III, coverage areas were 
obtained for 55, 70 y 144 km radium values. The cities 
evaluated were classified as showed in Table IV: towns with 
more than 5000 habitants, cities between 50,000 and 5,000, 
cities between 20,000 and 5,000 and cities between 10,000 
and 5,000. 
The results for Chiapas state analysis are detailed in Table V 
and in the Figure 3. In these are showed that for a minimum 
separation distance (55 km), around the 38% of cities with 
5000-10000 habitants might use the C band in a spectrum 
sharing configuration. In general, the results observed for the 
Chiapas sates reveals that as the city population decrease, the 
city have a bigger possibility to implement a sharing 
spectrum scheme using the C band. For the 140 km 
protection distance, the amount for candidate cities are less 
significant

Similar analysis was done for a sample integrated by 10 
states; 5 of these states are similar to Chiapas (with great 
rural population), and the other 5 states with higher urban 
population. 
The results obtained are showed in Figure 4. The obtained 
cities percentages have a similar tendency that the showed 
for Chiapas, but having less values.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
A potential use for spectrum sharing using the C band 
and the TVWS channels was described. For the TVWS case, 
there are a lot of spectrum to be used for potential sharing 
spectrum schemes, allowing increase the terrestrial systems 
capacity. 
Applying some technical considerations from ITU 
Recommendation, data rates were estimated for some states, 
along the Mexican territory. This alternative should be a 
very useful resource to solve the internet service access for 
the rural zones. By the other hand, the potential C band use 
for spectrum sharing schemes was less attractive than the 
TVWS option. The high satellite receiver sensitivity 
condition, require protection areas to avoid harmful 
interference. Perhaps the secondary use for fixed terrestrial 
services could be more feasible, but the potential cities out 
of the calculated protection areas are a few.   Future work 
could include the sharing spectrum evaluation in others 
bands, and analyzing dynamic spectrum strategies.
