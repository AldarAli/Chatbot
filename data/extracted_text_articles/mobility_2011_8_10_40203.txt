Abstract—Location-based services are possibly the most
popular services with respect to mobility, since they allow for
the automated ﬁltering of information relevant to the user.
This paper presents a detailed evaluation of SMARTPOS,
an indoor positioning system based on deterministic 802.11
ﬁngerprinting and a digital compass. SMARTPOS is accurate
enough to supply location estimates for indoor location-based
services and can be deployed standalone on a mobile phone.
The system considers the user’s orientation to avoid errors
caused by the blocking effect of the human body. For location
estimation it takes only that part of the ﬁngerprint database
into account that corresponds to the user’s current orientation.
SMARTPOS achieves a mean position error of 1.16 meters and
a maximum position error of 2.74 meters in a 250 square meter
environment.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, a trend towards mobility can be recog-
nized. Smartphones, small devices with comparatively high
processing power and mobile internet, make it possible to
work while traveling, to stay connected to social networks,
and to retrieve nearly any information anywhere at any
time. One of the most popular mobile services are location-
based services (LBS). These are value-added services, which
utilize the location of the mobile to present the user with
information about its surroundings. Navigation and informa-
tion services, friend-ﬁnder, pet-tracker, and location-based
games are only a small part of the number of services and
applications ﬁlling the app-stores of the world.
The key enabler for LBS is the Global Positioning System
(GPS) [1]. It enables accurate positioning in outdoor envi-
ronments, the usage is free of charge, the system is globally
available, and most of today’s smartphones are equipped
with a GPS-receiver. Unfortunately, GPS is not able to track
people in indoor environments with acceptable accuracy.
Signals might get lost due to attenuation effects of roofs
and walls or lead to position ﬁxes of very low accuracy due
to multipath propagation.
Even worse, indoor location-based services require much
higher precision guarantees than outdoor services. Errors
should not exceed a few meters to allow for a differentiation
between several ﬂoors or rooms. Otherwise, the service
could provide information for places, which are quite far
away from the actual position of the target. Despite these
challenges many users would appreciate indoor location-
based services, especially in large and complex buildings
such as museums, shopping malls, airports, hospitals, or
university buildings.
Existing indoor positioning techniques can be grouped
by their level of precision and the expenses for additional
infrastructure. Dedicated indoor positioning systems such as
ultra wide band or ultrasonic systems consist of several com-
ponents with the sole purpose of determining the positions
of possibly multiple targets in indoor environments. The
precision is often high, but an expensive infrastructure is
needed and hence the space where positioning is possible
is usually limited to a small area, where higher accuracy
compensates the high cost. Another class of systems is
built on existing infrastructure such as WLAN, Bluetooth
or inertial sensors for positioning. The precision of such
systems is limited, but the system can be deployed with few
additional expenses.
In this paper, we present SMARTPOS, an indoor po-
sitioning system for smartphones based on deterministic
WLAN ﬁngerprinting and a digital compass. The system is
self-positioning, meaning that the whole positioning process
(including all measurements) is carried out on the phone.
It achieves a high accuracy within few meters and there-
fore is able to provide indoor location-based services with
high quality location estimates at no additional expenses.
SMARTPOS makes use of the user’s orientation to avoid
errors caused by the blocking effect of the human body. Only
those ﬁngerprints are considered for location estimation that
were measured while viewing in a similar direction like the
user.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In the
next section, a short overview of existing indoor positioning
systems is given. In Section III, SMARTPOS is presented
in detail while in Section IV, the impact of several parame-
ters is analyzed and discussed. Weighted and non-weighted
kNN (k-nearest neighbors) in signal space, the inﬂuence of
missing values on the algorithm and the performance gain
of including the orientation on SMARTPOS and a Naive
Bayesian Estimator are evaluated. Section V concludes the
paper and gives hints on future work.

II. RELATED WORK
In the past 15 years, a variety of technologies for indoor
positioning have been proposed. A good overview of exist-
ing indoor positioning systems using radio frequency (RF)
technologies such as radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID),
ultra wide band (UWB), ultra high frequency (UHF), WLAN
and Bluetooth is given in [2]. However, they do not describe
up-to-date systems, which have been developed since 2007.
We therefore focus in this section on the recent development
and work closely related to our research.
Many state-of-the art systems rely on ﬁngerprinting al-
gorithms [3], [4], [5], [6]. These algorithms work in two
phases: The ﬁrst phase, the ofﬂine phase, is used to collect
signal strength measurements (the ﬁngerprints) from access
points throughout the building at predeﬁned reference po-
sitions. In the second phase, the online phase, the signal
strength information is continually measured and compared
to a database of all ﬁngerprints from the ofﬂine phase.
Different algorithms calculate the position as the nearest
ﬁngerprint in signal space, the average of the k-nearest
neighbors with or without the distance in signal space as
additional weight or utilize probabilistic methods. Localiza-
tion techniques based on ﬁngerprinting can be divided into
two classes: deterministic and probabilistic techniques.
Deterministic systems compute the location estimate as
a function of the received signal stregth (RSS) values mea-
sured using a physical model incorporating the values stored
in the ﬁngerprint database. One of the ﬁrst systems working
with WLAN ﬁngerprints to retrieve a position estimate is the
RADAR system [3]. RADAR is a deterministic system that
utilizes kNN for position estimation and offers an optional
signal propagation model for the automated creation of the
ﬁngerprint database. The authors noticed already the impact
of the user’s orientation and proposed obtaining empirical
data for multiple orientations. Kaemarungsi et al. analyze
the effects of the user’s presence and orientation on RSS
values in [7]. The results show that the attenuation effects
of the human body can lower the RSS by more then 9dBm.
Probabilistic techniques [4] on the other hand compute
a distribution based on the measurements from the ofﬂine
phase and use probabilistic techniques to estimate the user’s
position. COMPASS [5] is one of the ﬁrst probabilistic
indoor positioning systems that adresses the problem of
attenuation effects caused by the human body by adding
a compass to the system. In the ofﬂine phase, ﬁngerprints
for several selected orientations (typically each 45◦ or 90◦)
are collected at reference positions. In the online phase,
the user’s orientation is calculated by a digital compass
and only the ﬁngerprints with a similar orientation are used
for the positioning algorithm. COMPASS presents the most
similar approach to our system. However, we additionally
analyze the impact of orientation information for determin-
istic techniques as well as for a bayesian approach. We
also compare our results with a system not ﬁltering the
orientation information and thus beneﬁting from a much
larger database. Chan et al. also present a system running
on a mobile phone considering the orientation of the user
in [8], but apply a technique called Newton Trust Region
for further position reﬁnement. Martin et al. present one of
the ﬁrst WLAN positioning systems, which integrates both
ofﬂine and online phase on a mobile phone [9].
Most up-to-date systems combine WLAN ﬁngerprinting
with additional technologies such as inertial sensors to offer
more accurate position estimates and continuous tracking
functionality [10]. The authors utilize a particle ﬁlter for
fusing WLAN ﬁngerprint location estimates with an ac-
celerometer.
III. SMARTPOS: A SYSTEM FOR SELF-CONTAINED
MOBILE POSITIONING
In this section, we describe SMARTPOS, a system for
an accurate and self-contained indoor positioning based on
deterministic 802.11 ﬁngerprinting and a digital compass.
The system runs stand-alone on a mobile phone and consists
of a management module for the creation and maintenance
of the ﬁngerprint database and a module for location de-
termination. The latter offers the possibility of modifying
several parameters concerning the deterministic location
estimation or allows a change of the positioning method to
a room-based bayesian approach.
A. Database Creation on a Mobile Phone
During the ofﬂine phase, active scans for WLAN signals
from surrounding access points (APs) are executed with a
mobile phone at several reference positions. The measured
signal strength values are enhanced with the viewing direc-
tion and the pixel coordinates of the reference position on a
bitmap of the ﬂoor. The viewing direction is obtained by the
digital compass of the smartphone, the position is assigned
by tapping on a zoomable and scrollable map displayed
on the screen of the mobile. Finally these values (in the
following referred to as ﬁngerprints) are stored in a database.
At each reference position, four ﬁngerprints are created,
one in the direction of each axis of the speciﬁc building.
The alignment along the axes of the building instead of the
geographic directions is carried out to improve the accuracy
of the application in tracking scenarios since most users
move along the main axes of a building, e.g., when walking
down a corridor. For each ﬁngerprint, ﬁve scans are executed
and the average of the received signal strengths is stored in
the database to reduce the impact of short-time ﬂuctuations.
Furthermore, the orientation of the phone, which is derived
from the mobile phone’s compass, is averaged throughout
the sampling time and also stored in the database. This
is done to remedy the disturbances of the magnetic ﬁeld
inside of buildings, especially near electronic sources or
large amounts of metal.

B. Deterministic Location Estimation
During the online phase, SMARTPOS utilizes a de-
terministic positioning algorithm based on weighted kNN
to estimate the approximate position of the user. WLAN
signal strength measurements are carried out in a continuous
fashion and for each measurement m the current orientation
o of the phone is measured by its digital compass.
The orientation is considered to represent the approximate
viewing direction of the user and hence implicitly yields
the information about the attenuation of his body. The
online RSS values should therefore not be compared to all
ﬁngerprints in the database due to possible inﬂuence of the
human body, but only to those ﬁngerprints that correspond
to a similar viewing direction to o during the ofﬂine phase.
Since the viewing direction is retrieved from the noisy
readings of the compass, the orientation is averaged over
the duration of each scan. This mechanism could also be
replaced by advanced ﬁltering algorithms to reduce the
impact of outliers. SMARTPOS considers only a subset S
of all ﬁngerprints in the database containing those with a
maximal deviation of 50◦ from o and is therefore able to
reduce the number of ﬁngerprints matched in the online
phase to an extent of 25% of the database size.
On the remaining subset S of ﬁltered ﬁngerprints, the
nearest neighbours in signal space with respect to m are
computed. SMARTPOS uses a sophisticated distance metric
for the comparison of two RSS measurements (i.e., the
online measurement m and a ﬁngerprint f ∈ S): Each
measurement contains the information about all RSS values
with the mac adress of the AP, which sent the signal.
Since at a given position only signals of a subset of all
access points in the building can be received, the question
arises how to treat missing signal strength imformation in
one of two compared measurements. One possibility would
be to assign a ﬁxed value MIN to the RSS of all access
points missing in one measurement. This mechanism favors
combinations of measurements, where signals by an AP are
of very small strength in one measurement and missing in
the other instead of combinations, where a high RSS value
in one measurement is missing a counterpiece in the other.
The value of MIN should be below the minimal RSS value
measureable by the device. The other possibility is to ignore
all signal strength information missing at least in one of the
compared measurements. Based on the results of a detailed
evaluation (see Section IV) SMARTPOS utilizes the second
approach, which is expected to be more robust in the case
a new AP is turned on or an existing AP is turned off.
Based on the Euclidean distance di = dist(m, fi) in
signal space the subset N ⊂ S of the k nearest neighbours
is computed. In addition SMARTPOS assigns a weight wi
to each ﬁngerprint fi ∈ N, i ∈ {1, . . . , k} according to the
following formula:
wi =

di
k
X
j=1
1
dj


−1
(1)
It is easy to see that the wi are normalized since
kP
i=1
wi = 1.
For the computation of the user’s position l, SMARTPOS
calculates the weighted average of li, i ∈ {1, . . . , k}, li being
the reference position of the ﬁngerprint fi:
l =
k
X
i=1
liwi

C. A Naive Bayesian Location Estimator
A Naive Bayesian Estimator is a simple and still very
powerful classiﬁcation scheme. The main ingredient is Bayes
theorem, which is used to infer the probability P(I|M) of an
event I conditional on a measurement M. Using Bayes rule,
we can turn over I and M and calculate from the probability
of measuring M in the case that we are inside a given room
I.
P(I|M) = P(M|I)P(I)
P(M)
(3)
The probabilities on the right hand side are estimated
from a labelled set of instances simply by counting or
calculating the mean and variance of each one-dimensional
parameter and assuming a normal distribution. This trick
assumes that the parameters are statistically independent. As
this is usually not true, the performance of a classiﬁer on a
given problem has to be carefully estimated. It is common
to use a method called cross-validation for measuring the
quality of a classiﬁer. This is done by splitting the training
data and using a majority for training and holding back a
minority to calculate a success rate on this test set. The
details of how to do this and the basic caveats can be found
in many textbooks on data mining.
IV. EVALUATION
For the evaluation of our system, we created two sets of
ﬁngerprints in a part of our university building. All RSS
information was gathered with a HTC Desire. The ﬁrst set
is arranged in an approximate grid of 79 reference positions
with ﬁngerprints measured in the direction of all four main
axes of the building, which results in 316 ﬁngerprints in total
(the grey dots in Figure 1). The second set is a much smaller
set of 64 ﬁngerprints at 16 pseudo-randomly distributed
reference positions (again measured in the direction of all
four axes) within the coverage of the database and is used
as substitution for online measurements (the black dots in
Figure 1). This ensures that our results originate from an
identical setting for all the different location estimators.
The estimators are evaluated in respect to four criteria

according to [2]: the accuracy as the mean position error,
the precision as the maximal and the standard deviation, and
the complexity as the number of compared ﬁngerprints. The
question of scalability, cost and robustness is not considered,
since the scalability and the cost are the same in all systems
and the robustness is hard to measure. In the following the
results from a detailed evaluation of SMARTPOS in the
described setting are presented and discussed. SMARTPOS
is evaluated as follows: First the deterministic kNN approach
is analyzed and the settings of several parameters compared
to each other. The questions of assigning a weight to
the nearest neighbors and whether missing signal strenght
imformation should be considered or ignored are discussed
and the impact of the user’s orientation on accuracy and
precision presented. In a consecutive step an optimal value
for k is determined for SMARTPOS. Finally, the usage of
orientation information in a Naive Bayesian Estimator is
analyzed.
A. Weighted or Non-Weighted kNN
When using a kNN approach together with WLAN ﬁn-
gerprinting one has to decide whether just to compute the
center of the nearest neighbors or to add a weight to each
of the k-nearest neighbors according to the distance in
signal space and then calculate the center of mass. With
SMARTPOS, we evaluated both approaches for variable k.
Figure 2 shows the results. The weighted approach behaves
similarly, but performs better for each k > 1. The same
applies for the deviation while the maximum error shows
no signiﬁcant difference except for two outliers (k = 3 and
k = 8), for which the weighted approach also performs
better. SMARTPOS therefore utilizes a weighted kNN as
described in Section III-B.
B. Treatment of Missing RSS
In Section III-B, two approaches for the treatment of
missing signal strength information when comparing two
RSS measurements are described. One considers the in-
formation by assigning a minimal value of −100dBm for
the missing RSS information, the other ignores all RSS
values from APs measured only in one of the two compared
measurements. Both approaches were tested for a variable k
and the results are presented in Figure 3. The accuracy of a
system ignoring missing values is higher than the accuracy
of a system considering the information for each k > 3 and
also offers a minimum mean error for k = 9. The deviation
only becomes smaller for each k > 7 with the minimum for
k = 11, while the maximum error oscillates and therefore
adds little information. Hence, SMARTPOS ignores missing
RSS values.
C. Impact of Orientation Information
The most profound innovation of SMARTPOS is the
usage of orientation information in a deterministic location
estimation system on a smartphone. With the ﬁltering of
the ﬁngerprints in the ofﬂine database with respect to the
orientation information of the user, the compexity of the
online matching can be quartered (when using the state of
the art four directions for each reference position) and the
accuracy and precision increased by a considerable amount.
Figure 4 shows the results of the tests. The mean error is
much smaller when using the orientation information and
also reaches its minimum of 1.16m for k = 4, while the ap-
proach without orientation information reaches its minimum
of 1.31m for k = 9. The minimal deviation of 0.57m for

k = 6 is also much smaller than the minimal deviation of
0.74m for k = 11 without considering the orientation. The
same is true for the maximum error, which is minimal for
k = 5 with a value of 2.65m when considering the user’s
orientation, whereas without the orientation information the
minimum is 3.29m for k = 8. The much smaller number
of k when using the orientation approach can be explained
by the fact that the number of ﬁngerprints for comparision
is quartered and each online measurement has at most 4
neighbors in the grid, while without the ﬁltering of the user’s
orientation the number of neighbors can increase to a total
of 16 neighbors, because 4 ﬁngerprints are stored for each
reference position. In conclusion SMARTPOS utilizes the
orientation information of the user to improve accuracy and
precision of the location determination, while reducing the
complexity at the same time.
D. Determination of k
Based on our experiments with SMARTPOS, we recom-
mend utilizing an orientation-based weighted kNN approach
with k = 4. For the comparison of measurements one should
ignore all signal strength information of each AP missing at
least in one of the measurements. With these parameters, the
system offers the lowest mean error of 1.16m of all possible
combinations with an acceptable deviation of 0.66m and a
small maximum error of 2.74m.
E. Orientation and the Naive Bayesian Esitmator
The inﬂuence of ﬁltering ﬁngerprints according to their
orientation on deterministic kNN positioning has been de-
scribed. To get a deeper understanding of what inﬂuence
the reduction of the search space according to the viewing
direction has on indoor positioning, we chose to evaluate
on the most simple (and often most effective) way of
inducing a position from given measurements: Assuming
that the variance in measurements is normally distributed,
we estimate the mean and variance of a set of measurements
taken in the same room and reuse this information for
identiﬁcation.
In order to do so, we assigned a label with each ﬁngerprint
specifying the room that it lies in. The long corridor has been
cut into three rooms to reduce the variance of measurements
in this long area as depicted in ﬁgure 5. Using this labeled
data, we constructed a Bayesian Estimator, which calculates
for each pair of access point and label the mean, standard
deviation, weight sum and precision and reuses them for
classiﬁcation. We tested the classiﬁcation performance with
10-fold stratiﬁed cross-validation training on 90% and eval-
uation on the remaining 10% of the data.
We used this technique on ﬁve different datasets: A dataset
for each quadrant and a dataset where a random subset of
25% of all measurements in all directions were taken. In this

way we achieve comparable training set sizes.
The results from this experiment are negative: A Bayesian
classiﬁcation of room-labels performs better on the total set
of measurements than on the direction-dependent subsets.
The results are given in Table I. Hence, for a system based
on Bayesian estimation theory, we propose not to use the
direction as a ﬁlter.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented SMARTPOS, a positioning
system on a smartphone based on deterministic WLAN
ﬁngerprinting and a digital compass. SMARTPOS utilizes
a weighted kNN approach with k = 4 and with a distance
metric in signal strength space, which ignores RSS values
from access points visible only at one ﬁngerprint. We
analyzed the impact of several parameters and conclude that
a weighted approach results in more accurate and precise
results than a non-weighted approach. Ignoring missing RSS
values provides better results than assigning a minimal value,
at least for higher values of k. In our setting this was the
case for k > 3 in the oriented approach and for k > 7 in
the approach without the user’s orientation. With adding the
user’s orientation, SMARTPOS is able to reduce the mean
positioning error to 1.16m and the variance to 0.66m. The
maximal error in this case is 2.74m, which is 55cm smaller
and therefore much better than the minimal maximum error
of 3.29m in all experiments without the orientation infor-
mation. We conclude that the user’s orientation should be
considered in deterministic 802.11 ﬁngerprinting. However,
we also discovered that the orientation information should
not be used as a ﬁlter in a Naive Bayesian Estimator, since
the percentage of correctly recognized rooms was smaller
than that of the same algorithm trained with a similar large
set of data containing ﬁngerprints of all viewing directions.
In the near future, we want to expand the mechanism
for ﬁltering the database for faster access by including an
accelerometer to the system. We hope that after an initial
position ﬁx we are able to further reduce the candidate
set and can therefore support even large databases (e.g.,
at airports) standalone on the phone. Furthermore, we are
currently working on mechanisms for a self calibrating
system to replace the cumbersome process of keeping the
ﬁngerprint database up-to-date.
