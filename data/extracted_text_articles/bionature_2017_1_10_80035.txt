Abstract—In the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, a list of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 
has been approved connecting the issues of multidimensional 
poverty, inequality and exclusion, and sustainability. Seven of 
these goals are referred to environmental sustainability, thus 
significantly increasing the weight assigned to this field in the 
previous 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDG). 
The 
monitoring of sustainable development goals represents a 
challenge, especially for less developed countries, where a data 
revolution is needed to address the existing gap. In spite of this 
fact, this paper provides significant evidence about the existing 
differences in the benefits of development between countries, 
suggesting the need of further efforts aimed at “leaving no one 
behind” as stated in the first SDG report.

 INTRODUCTION  
The challenge of ensuring environmental sustainability, 
already included in the list of Millenium Development Goals 
(MDG), is now more evident since the new Sustainable 
Development Goals connect the issues of multidimensional 
poverty, inequality and sustainability. More specifically, 
while MDG considered four different environmental targets, 
this number has significantly increased in the SDG, which 
contain seven environmental goals (numbers 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 
14, 15, as summarized in Table I), monitored though 77 
indicators. 
Furthermore, the Paris Agreement (United Nations [1]), 
entered into force on 4 November 2016, sets out a global 
action plan to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting 
global warming, thus strengthening efforts to achieve SDG, 
particularly goal number 13.  
Within this context, this paper aims at monitoring the 
environmental MDG paying particular attention to the most 
vulnerable people and countries. In section 2 a performance 
index is computed for both environmental and poverty goals, 
while in section 3 we analyze the existing relationships, 
testing for convergence and country effects. Finally, section 
4 provides some concluding remarks.

MONITORING ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS 
Despite the lack of information for the less developed 
regions and some limitations in data coverage and quality, the 
SDG database and report [2] provide information for a wide 
variety of countries. More specifically, a panel has been 
considered including 135 countries and six different five-year 
periods referred to 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. 
Regarding the monitoring framework, a report by the 
Sustainable Development Solutions Network [3] emphasizes 
the need of simplicity, high frequency and disaggregation and 
the UN Statistical Commission [4] agreed a list of SDG 
indicators, subject to refinements and improvements as 
methods and data availability improve. In this context, our 
analysis includes the proportion of population with access to 
electricity, the proportion of population with primary reliance 
on clean fuels and technology, the renewable energy share in 
the total final energy consumption, the emissions of Carbon 
Dioxide (CO2), the proportion of urban population living in 
slums and the material footprint per capita. Furthermore, 
since the elimination of poverty is a meaningful goal for 
development, the poverty rate has also been analyzed. 
In order to monitor the evolution of these goals measuring 
the level of achievement of the proposed targets, two 
different indicators have been computed: the cumulative rate 
of growth and the performance index, given by the following 
expressions:

 respectively denote the current and 
initial values of the considered variables, and the specific 
target in the case that it exists. 
A classification of countries can be established according 
to the obtained results in both environmental and poverty 
indicators, as collected in Table II. In general terms, countries 
behave satisfactorily, especially with regard to poverty, as it 
has been stressed in some recent reports [2], [5], [6]. 
However, 
some 
difficulties 
are 
found 
regarding 
environmental goals as the electricity access, the evolution of 
carbon dioxide emissions and the percentage of population 
living in slums.  
Since the behaviour of the considered indicators varies 
widely across countries and the achievement of the 
sustainable development goals is particularly important for 
poor regions and countries, in the next sections we estimate 
econometric models with the aim of providing empirical 
evidence referred to the following questions: 
-Does economic growth impact environmental SDG? 
-Does convergence exist? 
-Are there significant country and/or time effects?

 Note: The classification of countries with regard to Environmental Performance 
and Poverty Reduction has been established according to the level accomplishment 
(%) of the corresponding targets: “High” if the level overcomes 75%, “Medium” 
for levels between 50% and 75% and “Low” otherwise.

III. 
CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS AND PANEL EFFECTS 
In order to answer the previously proposed questions, we 
consider a panel database referred to 135 countries and 6 five-
year periods from 1990 to 2015. 
The convergence analysis has been performed for each 
environmental indicator, testing if the corresponding 
cumulative rate of growth is inversely related with the initial 
values. As summarized in Table III, although the goodness of 
fit (measured through the coefficient of determination) is 
quite poor, all the estimated coefficients show the expected 
negative sign.   
Furthermore, the regression also includes the Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) rate of growth, included in the 
MDG database, which appears to significantly affect the 
access to electricity (possitively) and the population living in 
slums (negatively).

A more detailed analysis through panel estimation allows 
the identification of specific country and year effects. In this 
case, the dependent variable is the level of each 
environmental indicator and Table IV collects the main 
estimation results under the random effects hypothesis, which 
seems to be the most suitable option according to the 
Hausman test.  
The empirical evidence confirms the impact of economic 
growth in the access of electricity and the population living 
in slums, thus confirming the previous results. Moreover, in 
this case, significant impact is also found over the emissions 
of carbon dioxide. 
Given that this indicator has been identified as one of the 
main factors affecting the climate change, a more detailed 
analysis has been performed on carbon dioxide emission, 
whose econometric modeling and forecasting can be found in 
several works as Koirala et al [7], López et al [8], Pérez & 
López [9], among others. In general terms, these works 
confirm the need of new models of development and better 
environmental policies to avoid the costs of inaction both in 
economic and human terms.

According to the SDG panel database, CO2 emissions 
increase with economic growth and decrease as the share of 
renewable energy raises, thus confirming the findings of 
previous works [8] and emphasizing the need to promote 
broader energy access and increased use of renewable energy, 
as stated in SDG goal 7. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals, 
this paper provides empirical evidence about the evolution of 
environmental indicators. 
More specifically, the analysis of a country database 
including SDG indicators confirms the existence of 
convergence, also detecting significant differences between 
countries. 
These empirical findings suggest the need of fostering 
economic growth and the use of renewable energy in order to 
ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern 
energy for all.
