Abstract— Big data is a vast field of research and one that has not 
been completely explored. Studies involving big data, especially 
for solving problems in urban environments, still require more 
evidence. This work has the objective of identifying, evaluating, 
and interpreting published research that examine usages of the 
great amount of data generated by cities and its systems, in order 
to use Big Data technologies to improve city conditions. To 
achieve that, a systematic review of current literature was 
conducted. This review resulted in the finding of 1291 works of 
which 40 were identified as primary studies. The studies were 
then classified according to research focus and aspect of the city 
they focused on. The review investigates what it is known about 
the benefits and limitations in the use of big data in urban 
environments. The results show statistical data about big data, 
gaps 
in 
current 
research 
and 
models 
of 
successful 
implementation. 
 Keywords— Big Data; Smart City, Systematic Review, Ubiquity 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Two global tendencies have been significantly influencing the 
information technology field in recent years: the growth in city 
population, marked by the migration of people from rural 
zones to urban ones; and the exponential rise of data generated 
by citizens stemming from the use of pervasive computing [1]. 
In this context, many challenges, opportunities for learning 
and for better management of cities arise through the use of 
new and extensive data sources, extracting data from them. 
     According to the United Nation Population Fund (UNFPA), 
2008 was marked as the year in which more than half of the 
planets inhabitants, 3.3 billions, are now living in urban 
environments. With this unprecedented growth, many 
problems such as lacking transportation infrastructure, quality 
health assurance, citizens safety, unemployment rising, are 
driven cities in order to develop new and different means to 
try to avoid and mitigate those kind of issues, in order to 
provide citizens with a better living.  
However, in tandem with the increase of the population 
also increases the amount of data that is generated by the same 
population. This can be leveraged to help improving city 
services and to better control and manage resources through 
the use of new technologies. Such as Big Data, data mining 
and/or data analysis.  
The increase for data that is generated at a daily basis is 
explicit. According to Eron Kelly, “In the next five years we 
will generate more data as a human species than we have in 
the last 5.000 years” [2].  
Develop and use new means to connect, integrate and to 
analyze such overwhelming amount of data is an important 
step to city continuity and competitiveness. It is vital to them 
to develop this kind of approach in order to help citizens 
providing them with a cohesive and intelligent view of the city.  
The ubiquity of data sources and the resulting richness of 
information creates new research areas in computer and social 
sciences. Its application in diverse segments of industry is 
focus of many study efforts. However, the knowledge of the 
opportunities and challenges that arise through the use of big 
data technology applied to urbanization are still not 
sufficiently 
structured 
[1]. 
Albeit 
that 
many 
urban 
environments already use big quantities of data to improve 
infrastructure, planning and management, the term, as well as 
the underlying concept of big data are still lacking of more 
efforts. Among many different definitions, according to [4], 
big data refers not only to size of data but also to its speed and 
variety, and to obtain valuable information from this group of 
data, moreover, through the correct data analysis and 
leveraging on the size of the analyzed data it is possible to 
statistically increase the precision of the resulted information. 
In other words, a big data solution uses a group of data that is 
constantly increasing in order to provide its maintainers with 
more and more correct information that could be used to 
increase several aspects of a area. 
The study contained herein is an effort to map out the 
current knowledge of the aforementioned issues. The 
conditions under which big data could be used strategically 
need to be understood, its limitations, anticipated and clarified. 
This work is organized as such: In Section 2, basic 
concepts related to Big Data and the used methodology will be 
presented along with the objectives of the study. In Section 3, 
the methods, processes and the protocol that were used in the 
systematic review will be described. In Sections 4 and 5 the 
results related to the conducted research will be detailed 
presented. Finally, in Section 6 some conclusions and future 
works will be depicted. 
II. BIG DATA 
Big data is a term that is widely used in both academia and 
business. Despite the widespread adoption of the term, its 
meaning is still relatively unclear.  
According to Cukier et al. [5], big data refers to the 
analysis of big quantities of data to find useful relationships 
and/or patterns. Other aspects can be seen in the definition of 
Michael Friedenberg – president and CEO of IDG Enterprise. 
According to him, the term refers to sets of data that are so big

-in terms of volume, speed and variety - that they become 
impossible to manage by conventional databases [6]. 
The amount of digital data that is currently being created 
on a daily basis by social network apps, embedded systems etc. 
is huge. Terabytes of information are produced from various 
types of sources 
The application of big data technologies in urban 
environments can lead to truly intelligent cities that can be 
managed in real time with a high degree of precision [9]. 
III. APPLIED PROTOCOL 
Based upon the guidelines for the development of 
systematic reviews in software engineering described by 
Kitchenham [10] and the analysis of the review model by 
Dybå et al. [11], a new methodology for revision was created. 
Our review methodology is composed of six steps: (1) 
development of the protocol, (2) identification of inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, (3) search for relevant studies, (4) 
critical assessment, (5) extraction of data, and (6) synthesis. 
The steps applied to the study contained herein are presented 
below: 
The objective of this review is to identify primary studies 
that focus on the use of big data techniques that aim at solving 
urban problems. The following question helps identifying 
primary studies: 
 
● 
How is it possible to improve urban environment 
using big data and what are the challenges that 
accompanies the use of such technology for the 
creation of smart cities? 
 
From this central question, others secondary questions 
were developed of to help in the comprehension of the 
problem: 
 
● 
What aspects of urban environments can be 
optimized through the use of big data? 
● 
Which solution models can the applied to cities? 
● 
How can citizens and government officials benefit 
from the use of big data technologies? 
● 
What are the main challenges in using big data in 
urban environments? 
 
A. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
For this review, we considered studies that aim at 
analyzing the use of big quantities of data to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of any indispensable city service. 
The studies could refer to specific sectors (e.g., traffic control 
or security) or have a broader scope taking into account many 
types of services. Since this field of research is recent, this 
review limited the examined studies to the ones published 
starting from year 2004. 
Were also excluded:  
• 
Studies not published in the English language;  
• 
Studies that were unavailable online; 
• 
Studies not based on research and that express only 
the official opinions of governments and field experts; 
• 
Call for works, prefaces, conference annals, handouts, 
summaries, panels, interviews and news reports. 
 
B. Search Strategies 
The databases considered in the study is in the list below:  
• 
ACM Digital Library; 
• 
IEEE Xplore; 
• 
ScienceDirect – Elsevier;  
• 
SpringerLink. 
 
Combinations of terms were created to guarantee that 
relevant information would not be excluded when querying 
different search engines and databases. As a result, four search 
strings were created: 
 
1. 
“big data” AND (city OR cities); 
2. 
“big data” AND citizen*;  
3. 
“big data” AND urban*; 
4. 
“big data” AND govern*; 
 
In the process of extracting information from the 
databases, the search strings were used separately on each 
database. The searches were performed between December 
2013 and January 2014. The results of each search were 
grouped together according to database and were, later, 
examined closer in order to identify duplicity. Table 1 shows 
the amount of studies found on each database.

C. Studies Selection Process 
This Section describes the selection process from the 
beginning: from initial search using the Search Strategies 
described below to identification of primary studies.  
At the first step, the studies that were obtained from the 
databases were gathered and added to Mendeley’s citation 
management tool. This resulted in the finding of 1291 non-
duplicated citations. 
Secondly, the titles of all works selected in the previous 
step were analyzed to determine its relevance in this 
systematic review. At this stage, many works that did not 
mentioned using big data being to improve city conditions 
were eliminated. 
Due to the use of terms related to city data, many works of 
geography, biology, medicine and sociology were found. In 
those cases, all works whose titles did not conform to the 
scope of the review were eliminated. In other cases, when the 
works titles were vague or unclear, they were put aside to be 
analyzed in the next step. At the end of this stage, 981 
citations were excluded, thus remaining 310 items for further 
analysis.  
In the third step, all abstracts of the works found in the 
23

previous phase were assessed. Once more, many studies 
whose primary focus was not the analysis of large data 
directed to solving urban problems have been eliminated. We 
could conclude that the abstracts varied a lot in quality. Some 
items did not even had abstracts or had abstracts that did not 
clearly presented what the rest of the article was about. At this 
step, the articles that have not made it clear their conformity 
with the inclusion or exclusion criteria were included to be 
filtered out at a next step. Because of this phase, 251 studies 
were excluded, thus remaining 59 to be analyzed more closely. 
Table 2 presents the amount of studies filtered in each step 
of selection process.

D. Quality Assessment 
In the quality assessment stage, works passed through a 
thorough critical analysis. In this stage, the complete studies 
were analyzed, instead of only the titles or abstracts. After this, 
the last studies that were considered uninteresting for the 
review were eliminated resulting in the final set of works. 
After the quality assessment, relevance grades were attributed 
to the remaining works. The relevance grades are going to be 
useful in the next stage. 
Eight questions, based on [10] and [11], were used to help 
in the quality assessment. Those questions helped determining 
the relevance, rigor, and credibility of the work being analyzed. 
Of the eight, the first two are more useful to establish whether 
the work is relevant for the review, reason why they were the 
only ones used as exclusion criteria. The remaining questions 
are more useful for determining quality of the work, reason 
why they were used to grade the work according to quality. 
The questions were: 
 
1. 
Does the study examine big data analysis as a way to 
aggregate value to citizens or rulers? 
2. 
Is the study based on research - not merely on 
specialist’s opinions? 
3. 
Are the objectives of the study clearly stated? 
4. 
Is the context of the study adequately described? 
5. 
Were the methods for data gathering correctly used 
and described? 
6. 
Was the research Project adequate to reach the 
research objectives? 
7. 
Were the research results adequately validated? 
8. 
Does the study contribute to research or citizens daily 
needs in any way? 
 
Of the remaining 59 studies that were analyzed in the 
quality assessment stage, 40 passed to the stage of Data 
Extraction and Synthesis and were thus considered the 
primary studies. The quality assessment process will be 
presented in detail in the results Section along with the 
assessment of the 40 remaining studies. 
 
IV. RESULTS 
40 primary studies were identified [7], [12]–[50]. Each 
one deals with on a wide array of research topics and utilize a 
wide set of exploration models for each different scenario.  
According to Ferraz et al.  [51], it is possible to understand 
an intelligent city environment by interpreting six types of 
services: healthcare, transportation, education, security, 
government, and resources. Among the primary studies, we 
could find occurrences in four of the aforementioned groups. 
They were: healthcare, transportation, government and 
resources. The studies that did not fit into any of those groups 
were classified as being “general”. The ones considered 
“general” are so for not relating to only one aspect of the city. 
They usually analyze the growth of data sources by focusing 
on the development of the city without taking into 
consideration the specific area they act upon. 
 
A. Quantitative Analysis 
The research process that was developed resulted in 40 
primary studies. They were written by 124 authors linked to 
institutions based on 19 different countries, distributed on four 
continents, and were published between 2010 and 2013. In 
total, the authors identified 158 different keywords in their 
works.  
In regards to the country of origin, most of the publications 
came from the United Stated (eight publications), followed by 
Germany, Greece, Italy, Australia and Spain (all with three 
works). China, Switzerland, Ireland and Korea was the third 
group (all with two publications). Each of the other remaining 
countries had only one publication. The large amounts of 
countries that have publications on the subject of big data 
show how widespread the topic is globally. 
The most common keywords used in the remaining works 
with their respective frequency were: big data (10), smart city 
(8), data mining (4), social media (4), cloud computing (3), e-
government (3), open data (3), open government (3), data 
fusion (2), innovation (2), personalized healthcare (2), twitter 
(2), ubiquitous computing (2). The first three keywords - big 
data, smart city and data mining - reflect precisely the theme 
of the research contained herein. 
 
B. Quality Analysis 
As was described in the previous Section, each of the 
primary studies was assessed according to eight quality 
criteria that relate to rigor and credibility as well as to 
relevance. If considered as a whole, these eight criteria 
provide a trustworthiness measure to the conclusions that a 
particular study can bring to the review. The classification for 
each of the criteria used a scale of positives and negatives.  
Table 3 presents the results of the evaluation. Each row 
represents a primary work and the columns 'Q1' to 'Q8'

represent the 8 criteria defined by the questions used on 
quality assessment: Focus, Research, Objectives, Context, 
Data Gathering, Project, Validation, and Value, respectively. 
For each criteria, '1' represent the positive answer and '0' the 
negative one.

All studies that were analyzed in this step had positive 
answers for questions 1 and 2 because, as previously stated in 
the research methodology part, these questions represent 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consequentially, all studies 
with negatives answers to at least one of these criteria were 
already removed during selection stage. 
All studies that were analyzed provided information on the 
context of the work and contributed in some way to research 
and the field development. A small part, 13 of 40 works, did 
not provide an objective description of the problem. A number 
of 15 works did not show properly its procedures for data 
collection and 11 works did not present its procedures for data 
analysis. 19 theoretical works did not provide validations for 
the proposed models or research results. Another fraction, 10 
of 40 studies, obtained the maximum score in quality analysis. 
The highest number of negative answers was found for study 4. 
V. DISCUSSION 
After the analysis and data extraction steps performed on 
the primary works, it was possible to identify some aspects 
relating big data solutions for urban environments. In the first 
place, it was possible to conclude that big data applied to 
urban environments is a very recent field of research. All 
primary works were published after 2010. Second, a great 
quantity of theoretical solution and conceptual models are 
available. This shows that the research field is very active but 
also that concrete efforts to implement what was theorized are 
rare. 
The review also showed that there is a lack of 
standardization in government solutions. This happens 
because unification of data policy is a hard task due to each 
government possessing specific priorities. In this context, 
solutions based on collaborative data, despite showing a great 
potential, need sustainable business models to ensure that all 
involved parties can profit. 
 
A. Urban sectors that can be optimized through the use of big 
data. 
After the analysis of primary studies, solutions could be 
categorized into four main urban sectors: government, 
healthcare, transportation and resources.  
In the government sector, problems faced by both 
government officials and citizens were identified. Issues faced 
by government officials have to do with efficiency and 
effectiveness of organizational sectors [18][20]. Those issues 
are accentuated by urban population growth. Issues faced by 
citizens relate to lack of transparency of public sectors 
[16][38]. Citizens could benefit from accessing to government 
data because it would give them insight into how public 
money is spent. 
In the healthcare sector the problem relates to high costs 
paid by government and general population. This happens as a 
result of fraud crimes [39] and inadequacies in medical tools. 
If doctors had better tools, diagnoses would be more precise 
and faster [22][29]. This would, in turn, reduce the amount of 
times the patients needed to return for consultations, 
benefiting the healthcare sector as a whole. 
The main problem identified in transportation sector is the 
intense traffic that exists in cities [26][32][43]. This calls for 
alternatives in transportation to be developed and for constant 
monitoring of the traffic conditions.  
In resources, we could verify that the difficulty lies in 
management. For efficient distribution, it is necessary that 
distribution networks be constantly being monitored in search 
for flaws and to aid planning of infrastructure [14][15][44]. 
B. Solution Models. 
The solutions found in the revisions can be classified under 
the following categories: conceptual models, sensors and 
services, social networks and visualization techniques, and 
pattern recognition.

The conceptual models consist in revisions of the topic 
along with the development of theoretical models of 
recommendations based on research and learned lessons. This 
was the category that had the highest amount of solutions 
during revision where we can highlight the healthcare and 
government groups. Altogether, 19 of the analyzed studies are 
framed in this group: [7], [12]–[14], [16], [18]–[22], [27]–[29], 
[31], [33], [38], [40], [44] and [48]. 
The solutions based on sensors and services aggregate data 
from various sensors (be they heterogeneous or not) and 
provision them to be used in the development of services that 
can aid government officials or citizens. We identified 5 
works at this group: [23], [24], [26], [36] and [49]. This type 
of solution, due to them not specifying what type of sensors 
can be utilized, can be applied in various areas of the city. Due 
that they were classified as being “general”. 
Solutions in social networks analyze data already available 
to infer tendencies, events, or reception of public policies. 4 
studies were categorized at this class: [25], [34], [41] and [47]. 
Since this type of data can be analyzed with many different 
objectives, this type of solution can be found mostly in the 
“general” category.  
The solutions in pattern recognition entailed mostly the 
development of many data analysis, machine learning and 
visualization techniques. The 12 works remaining were 
grouped at this category: [15], [17], [30], [32], [35], [37], [39], 
[42], [43], [45], [46] and [50]. They intend to extract relevant 
information from raw data and to present them in a way that 
can be used as a decision support tool. Many of those 
solutions were applied to problems of finding better routes to 
help in city traffic and were consequentially classified under 
the “transportation” category. 
 
C. Value created by Big Data solutions 
The application of big data technologies brings several 
benefits to urban sectors. In the “resources” category, the 
development of measurement structures used in tandem with 
data extraction technologies helped enormously in the 
management of water and energy. These technologies provide 
a number of advantages, including lower measurement costs, 
resource waste reduction for customers, theft detection, 
increased reliability of supply methods and the possibility of 
custom pricing strategies. 
The benefits for the healthcare category vary from 
diagnoses that are more efficient to reduction in costs of 
medical systems. Most of the technologies that were revised 
are used to provide a more detailed analysis of patients’ health 
by taking into account personal and medical history, and 
similarities to other patients to reduce the amount of medical 
consultations. Other benefits that medical systems provide 
stem from the analysis of data to reduce frauds, and other 
kinds of waste. 
In transportation, the analysis of traffic patterns allows a 
more effective investment and provides the citizen with 
information on routes. 
In government, most research highlights benefits of big 
data technologies for both citizens and managers. To citizens, 
the open government initiatives help providing more 
transparency in government spending, as well as allowing 
innovative solutions to be developed due to the availability of 
city data. To managers the benefits lie mostly in 
improvements of analytical works to aid in decision-making 
and predictions on impacts on society. 
D. Towards Big Data challenges.  
The main challenge in working with big data refers to how 
to deal with the overwhelming amount, speed and variety of 
that data. The size, speed and variety attributes turn traditional 
data analysis models obsolete or insufficient. Besides the 
problem of size, speed and variety, our study found another set 
of challenges: 
• 
Standardization: The lack of standards in gathering 
and provisioning of data and lack of standards in 
solution models makes reuse difficult. As a result, 
solutions become very specific which can hinder the 
development on the field. 
• 
Information Security: Most solutions use personal or 
sensitive data of people or businesses. The assurance 
of privacy, integrity and availability of that data is of 
the outmost importance when the objective is raising 
quality of life.  
• 
Reversal and recuperation: Given the large amount of 
data and the vulnerabilities inherent to big data 
solutions, it is important to assure the recuperation of 
data in the case when data is lost due to some 
unexpected event. More intelligent solutions than 
Backup and Restore need to be created due to the 
large amount of data. 
• 
Acceptance of Change: Some sectors are more 
resistant to the adoptions of new technologies – or of 
change in general. This happens often in government 
where people are accustomed to bureaucracy and to 
certain traditional ways of doing things.  
• 
Quality: Data used by big data solutions often lack 
quality due to inexistent or insufficient validation. 
This is a challenge due to data validation being 
difficult when the size of it is very large. Errors can 
happened during gathering, analyzing or provisioning 
of data. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
The objective of this review was to identify studies and 
solutions that propose solving urban problems with application 
of big data. In the search phase, 1291 works were found of 
which 40 were classified as primary studies after selection and 
quality criteria were applied. 
The studies were first classified in according to focus of 
their solutions. A big number of theoretical works and 
conceptual models were found. This showed that concretely 
implemented and validated solutions are currently scarce. 
Many solutions based on sensors and services were also found. 
Those solutions, however, lacked standardization. Other works 
presented data analysis models in social networks and pattern 
recognition techniques.

In regards to aspects of the city that are more frequently 
targeted in studies, we found the following: government, 
healthcare, transportation, and resources. Distinct solutions 
were identified for each and potential benefits were presented. 
The main challenges in concretely applying the solutions that 
were found are privacy, standardization, data quality, 
willingness to change, and security. 
A limitation of the current study is the potential bias that 
exists when only one researcher is responsible for deciding 
selection criteria and analyzing quality of the works. Even 
though measures were taken to keep the analysis impartial, 
such as defining search questions and protocol beforehand, 
more strict validation, especially in regards to selection criteria, 
would benefit future research efforts. Another limitation is the 
lack of an in depth analysis of the solutions proposed by each 
study. The main focus of this work was to find patterns in the 
use of big data solutions applied to urban environments to 
provide a general view of the current state of art.  
As a future work, more effort could go into the analysis of 
the solutions to enable the development of standardization 
models.
