Abstract— This paper proposes a dynamic and customizable 
layered serious game design framework for improving the 
physical and mental health of the aged after presenting the 
results obtained from a study with mainstream and 
alternative/complimentary health professionals concerning the 
usage of interactive games as a tool to improve both physical 
and mental well-being of the elderly. This study reports on the 
commonality of  design and health factors regarding the 
usability of video games for the aged to ensure the elderly 
benefit 
from 
traditional 
and 
alternative 
healthcare 
professionals’ perspectives.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
According to recent studies, the majority of the 
developed countries are dealing with a dramatic increase of 
the aged population which could result in a crisis, if the 
problem is not addressed effectively and in a timely fashion 
[1].  As a result of this predicted crisis, there has been a huge 
increase in the development of systems to improve the well-
being and quality of life of seniors looking for the prevention 
of diseases and injuries related to ageing. The usage of some 
interactive technologies such as video games, has shown a 
positive impact in health outcomes for the elderly [2].  
Research has been applied to find feasible methods to 
encourage and engage seniors with the use of these games 
[3], [4]. The strategy of using game technology and game 
design principles for a primary purpose other than pure 
entertainment is referred as “serious games”. The definition 
of serious games according to [5] is “a mental contest, 
played with a computer in accordance with specific rules that 
uses entertainment to further government or corporate 
training, education, health, public policy, and strategic 
communication objectives.”. From the aforementioned 
description it could be inferred that the more aligned these 
game design rules and usability factors are to the ultimate 
objective of a serious game the more effective this serious 
game results in achieving its primary goal. The primary goal 
of utilising game technology in this preliminary study is that 
of improving the mental and physical health of the elderly. 
This paper reports and comments on a study regarding 
the suitability of four Nintendo Wii balance games under the 
observation of six experts in health and wellbeing techniques 
[6][7]. This study presents a further analysis and discussion 
over the results gathered from the observations of health 
professionals from traditional and alternative healthcare 
professionals’ perspectives. Finally this paper proposes a 
dynamic and customizable layered serious same design 
framework with the purpose of aligning and targeting game 
design rules and usability factors for the enhancement of the 
physical and mental health of the user. 
This study was performed via a series of recorded and 
transcribed semi-structured interviews where health design 
factors and the suitability of the games for the elderly users 
were assessed [6][7]. The authors present the emerging 
factors from the observations of the games and results of the 
interviews and a discussion concerning the findings followed 
by the proposed framework and the conclusion.

METHODOLOGY  
In order to identify the barriers, drivers and usability 
factors of the use of the assessed interactive technologies, the 
authors 
utilized 
the 
following 
two 
(2) 
combined 
methodologies: 
1) 
the modified Analytic Framework used by Jamieson 
et al [8] in their landmark study on Consumer Health 
Information Technologies used by the elderly, chronically ill 
and underserved (see Figure 1). The modifications limited 
the technologies to Interactive Game Technologies, in this 
case, four (4) Wii games that concentrate on balance.  
2)  
a heuristic based evaluation technique for the 
identification 
and 
categorization 
of 
the 
interactive 
technology usability factors. This video games heuristic 
evaluation technique was selected due to its flexibility and 
adaptable nature [9]. 
Figure 1 below sets out the Analytical Framework which 
served as a basis for our semi-structured interviews and 
demonstrations.

Figure 1.  Jimison’s Analytic Framework  [8]. 
The Analytic Framework followed by an heuristic 
evaluation technique were applied to evaluate of the usability 
of the video games by interviewing health professionals who 
had experience with elderly patients [6][7]. The researchers 
did not run experiments with older users at this preliminary 
stage due to the risks inherent in this practice. 
During July and August 2010, the authors evaluated four 
Wii balance games (see Table 2) with the cooperation of six 
health professionals, three of them representing alternative 
health techniques, and the other three representing  
traditional medicine (see Table 1).

Overall, the sessions were conducted by following three 
stages: (1) One semi structured interview with each health 
professional  concerning the procedures which each one 
performed with the patients over 65yrs, as well as their 
experience, if any,  involving interactive technologies within 
their practices (see Table 2).  
 
 
 
(2) A demonstration of the four Wii balance games, 
namely Skate Board Arena, Tightrope Walk, Balance 
Bubble, and Table Tilt; all of them part of the Wii Fit Plus 
suite (see Table 1). These demonstrations were performed by 
one of our researchers. In one interview, the interviewee 
offered 
to 
perform 
the 
activity. 
During 
all 
the 
demonstrations, the interviewee was providing oral feedback 
by remarking on the strengths and weaknesses of the video 
games. They offered suggestions to make the games more 
enjoyable and suitable for their elderly patients.(3) This 
material was transcribed and analyzed using Leximancer, a 
specialist analytics technology for unstructured, qualitative, 
textual data [10].

III. 
CATEGORISATION OF USABILITY FACTORS  
 
In order to identify and categorize usability factors a 
modified version of the Heuristic Evaluation was utilized.  
This methodology was slightly modified in order to adapt to 
Jamieson’s framework. 
The term Heuristic Evaluation is an inspection technique 
where a set of usability principles is established and used by 
evaluators to explore an interface. These principles are called 
heuristics. 
The heuristic evaluation [8] was applied by following the 
following five (5) stages: (1) the identification of usability 
problems as well as their categorization; in order to be able 
to identify not only the ‘problems’ or barriers, but also the 
drivers mentioned in Jamieson et al [8]. The scope of the 
term ‘problems’ was expanded to a more generic neutral 
term that we refer to as  ‘factors’ in this paper; these factors 
can be of a positive or negative nature; (2) the observation of 
players while interacting with the videogames under the 
observation of evaluators; recording facial expressions, 
verbal reactions, etc; looking for new factors which could be 
missed from the first stage; (3) the re-categorization of 
usability factors; (4) the description of the ways to resolve 
problems encountered previously by the creation of 
heuristics; (5) the testing of heuristics applying the 
methodology of user logging combining the thinking aloud 
protocol.  
 
The list below describes the final categorization of the 
appeared usability factors [7]:  
I. 
Provide training phases: The game should have 
training phases before the real game starts, allowing the users 
to become familiar with the technology. Additionally, these 
training stages must be easy to skip when they are not 
required anymore. 
II. 
Create feasible goals: The goals must be reachable 
by adapting the difficulty of hazards to take into account the 
physical abilities of the aged cohort. 
III. Establish appropriate relations between movements 
and display: The game must respond according to the user 
movements. 
IV. Provide rules, information and instructions in an 
adequate way: The information regarding rules, suggestions 
and instruction should be given before and during the game, 
so the user does not have to read instructions and operate at 
the same time. Also, this information should be provided by 
audio. 
V. 
Consider the mental condition of the player: The 
player should not feel frustrated and upset because of hard 
goals. The objective of a game is to entertain the player, so 
practices such as the ones involving excessive memorizing 
or unnecessary cognitive complexity to understand the game 
must be avoided.  
VI. Consider the physical condition of the player: 
Avoid unnecessary requirements for workouts involving 
coordination and flexibility outcomes. If possible, preclude 
the need for complex movements so the elderly users, if at all 
possible, do not require frames to maintain balance. 
VII. Engage the user: The thematic of the video game 
must be in accordance with the audience’s interest to avoid 
lack of commitment. 
Tables 3 illustrates the frequency and total number of 
usability factors found with each heuristic as identified by 
the alternative and mainstream practitioners. Table 4 shows 
the frequency and total number of positive and negatives for 
the heuristics.

RESULTS 
After running the evaluation and categorizing the 
problems, the total number of unique usability factors was 
60. The distribution of the total number of occurrences per 
medical approach was 45 % (27 occurrences out of 60) for  
the “Alternative/Complementary” group  against 55 %  of 
the “Traditional/Mainstream”  (33 occurrences out of 60) 
respectively. 
Figure 2 provides a graphical representation of the 
frequency trends of the two (2) medical approaches per 
usability category. Factors such as Physical Health had the 
major number of occurrences for the two medical approaches 
whereas Engagement seemed to present a large discrepancy 
between the two. 
Figure 3 presents the total granular frequency of usability 
factors (positive or negative) found for each usability factors’ 
category.  The major numbers of negative occurrences were 
related to the Physical Health category followed by the 
Provision of Rules, Information and Instructions.   
Table 5 presents a subset of the pre-processed results 
with detailed occurrences related to Physical and Mental 
Health usability factors.

V. 
 DISCUSSION 
As explained earlier in this paper, the use of videogames 
among the aged population requires a deep inspection to 
guarantee optimum results on health practices. Thanks to the 
use of methods like the heuristic evaluation to assess the 
usability of interactive video games as well as the co-
operation of health specialists, we found that there are some 
characteristics, which could bring out unexpected results 
regarding the mental and physical health of the elderly. 
Problems such as the lack of relation between what it is 
supposed you do and what you see on the screen, could 
cause confusion for the player giving as a result a feeling of 
anxiety and frustration affecting, at the same time, the 
balance reflex and mental satisfaction. Also, it is important 
to mention that due to the changes which the human body 
suffers in advanced ages, the users could lose the accuracy of 
senses such as sight and hearing, making it complicated for 
the elderly to read or listen to instructions while the game is 
running. 
VI. 
FRAMEWORK 
The majority of the barriers in this preliminary study 
were related to the physical and mental conditions of the 
elderly (e.g. muscle strength, balance, memorization or 
cognitive capacity to perform concurrent activities). Another 
major factor was the lack of alignment in between the game 
rules or goals which in many cases lead to undesirable 
physical and/or mental user behaviors and the primary goal 
of improving the health of the user.  These game rules should 
be not only aligned to the user health condition profile, but 
also customizable and automatically adjustable to the user’s  
progress. Granularity for specific user health conditions 
should be specifically targeted, measurable and adjustable to 
multivariate skill progress during the evolution of the game. 
The proposed Dynamic and Customizable Layered 
Serious Game Design Framework in Figure 4 is proposed   
as an aid to serious game design for health purposes.  This 
framework attempts to align to Jamison’s major positive user 
effect instigators which should provide a complete feedback 
loop that includes: 
 (a) monitoring of current patient status, (b) interpretation 
of this data in light of established, often individualized, 
treatment goals, (c) adjustment of the management plan as 
needed, (d) communication back to the patient with tailored 
recommendations or advice, and (e) repetition of this cycle at 
appropriate intervals. Systems that provided only one or a 
subset of these functions were less consistently effective [8]. 
 The proposed framework aims to alleviate design 
customizable problems improving the Physical and Mental 
Health of the Aged.

VII. CONCLUSION 
Previous research has shown that the usage of video 
games for health purposes provides some positive 
outcomes for the elderly. This is evidenced by the 
successful result of research which treated diseases related 
with getting older by using video games and interactive 
technologies. Despite this, these practices could result in 
drawbacks for the elderly when their mental and physical 
conditions before playing video games are not considered. 
Furthermore, testing the usability and suitability of 
videogames is crucial to obtain the improvements 
expected. Consequently, in order to identify the barriers, 
drivers and usability factors of the use of the assessed 
interactive technologies, the authors utilized the modified 
Analytic Framework used by Jamieson et al [8] in their 
landmark study on Consumer Health Information 
Technologies used by the elderly, chronically ill and 
underserved (see Figure 1), as well as a heuristic based 
evaluation 
technique 
for 
the 
identification 
and 
categorization of the interactive technology usability 
factors. This video games heuristic evaluation technique 
was selected due to its flexibility and adaptable nature [9]. 
The use of an extended heuristic evaluation and the 
interviews with six healthcare experts have shown 
effective results in assessing the usability of videogames;  
this flexibility has allowed the researchers to discover  and 
categorize hidden usability factors regarding the suitability 
of Nintendo Wii games for aged users.  
The analysis of the results obtained during this study 
led the researchers to the proposed dynamic and 
customizable layered serious game design framework for 
improving the physical and mental health of the aged. 
Although this topic is currently being researched world 
wide, the complexity in the alignment of the game design 
components with the granularity and dynamics of the 
targeted, 
measurable 
and 
customized 
user 
health 
conditions locates this multidisciplinary area of research at 
the beginning of a long road ahead of discoveries in 
disciplines of game design, health and behavioral sciences 
among others.
