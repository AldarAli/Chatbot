Abstract- In this paper, the accuracy of the satellite on 
board orbit calculation is compared with a ground based 
system calculation.  The objective is to determine whether 
the on board satellite orbit propagator software is sufficient 
enough for Optical Intersatellite Link communication 
between a Low Earth Orbit and Geosynchronous Earth 
Orbit satellites and figuring out the possible reasons of any 
inaccuracy if any. The study is done by using TURKSAT 
3A Geostationary satellites’ data. Even the software on 
board the TURKSAT 3A does not intend to provide fine 
orbital position for intersatellite communication, this study 
is done in order to conclude the convergences and open 
points on the onboard orbit propagator. First, a quick 
summary is given for TURKSAT 3A satellite and its’ 
station keeping philosophy. In the following sections, 
comparisons are done between on board and on ground 
orbit calculations with different time intervals of the year 
2010. The possible root causes of the differences between 
these two calculations are discussed at the end. 
 
Keywords – Turksat; Optical Intersatellite Link; On

I.   INTRODUCTION 
After the invention of lasers, lots of studies have 
been done for laser communications because of its 
theoretical advantages of higher data rates, lower power, 
smaller size, and lower mass. The studies for free-space 
laser communications have been in development in the 
United States since 1960s and in Japan and Europe since 
1970s [1]. The advantage of small wavelength and low 
beam divergence make lasers attractive for optical 
communication [2], especially for intersatellite link 
communication between an observation satellite and a 
Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite. It usually 
takes long time to send the image taken by a Low Earth 
Orbit (LEO) observation satellite to Earth. Therefore, one 
of the advantages of the intersatellite link is that it 
dramatically reduces the access time of a requested 
image of a land without a need of a polar station [3], [4], 
[5]. 
On the other hand, having a narrow laser beam 
came with the problem of tracking and finding the target 
spacecraft (SC). Since the access time between LEO and 
GEO satellite is limited due to different orbits, it is a time 
critical operation to find and lock the target SC as soon 
as both satellites see each other to begin the 
communication. That’s why, finding the target SC on 
time give more chance to exchange more data between 
LEO and GEO satellites. And the GEO satellite can send 
the required information to ground station almost real 
time.  
Successful laser communications between LEO and 
GEO satellites have been achieved after lots of studies. 
Two of the main steps of optical intersatellite links 
(OISL) are; the successful communication between 
French SPOT-4 (LEO) and ARTEMIS (GEO) on 
November 2001 and bidirectional laser communication 
ARTEMIS - Japanese OICETS (LEO) on December 
2005. These tests showed that the GEO satellites can be 
very useful for relay purpose for OISL. 
In order to compensate the movement of the 
satellites, known Ephemerides data and the signals from 
the electro optics tracking systems are used [6]. The 
concept of optical intersatellite links in communication 
satellite networks is discussed in [7] and [8]. The related 
studies are focused on: satellites optical communication 
network  [9], analyzing the impact of random pointing 
and tracking errors in coherent and incoherent optical 
intersatellite communication [10], proposals for adapting 
the control system to reduce the vibration effect on the 
satellite[11]. Taking into account the classification of 
Pointing Errors in intersatellite link [12] ephemeris errors 
are one of the point-ahead errors which have to be 
minimized. 
 In this paper, a series of studies were done on a 
flying satellite (TURKSAT 3A) in order to calculate 
whether on board ephemeris propagation is sufficient 
enough for OISL. Firstly, a quick summary is given for 
TURKSAT 3A satellite and its’ station keeping 
philosophy. Then, comparisons are done between on 
board and on ground orbit calculations with different 
time intervals of the year 2010 in the following sections. 
At the end, the possible root causes of the differences 
between these two calculations are discussed.

II.    TURKSAT 3A AND ITS’ STATION KEEPING 
PRINCIPLE 
TURKSAT 3A, which was built on a Thales Alenia 
Spaces’ SB4000 satellite platform, launched into space 
on 12 June 2008. It was placed into orbit at 42 degree 
East longitude where it is collocated with TURKSAT 2A 
and it has been working properly at that position since 
then. 
Like most of the GEO satellite operators, Türksat 
AS. choose to make North and East maneuvers in 14 
days cycle basis.  Fig. 1 shows the Orbit Determinations 
(OD), North Maneuver (NS), On Orbit Propagator (OOP) 
initial orbital parameters update and East Maneuver 
(EW) plan in one cycle [13]. 
 
 
Figure 1. Station Keeping Principle of TURKSAT 3A 
 
The ODs are performed by using an antenna which 
has tracking capability. During the year 2010, three 
different antennas, all of which are located in Ankara, 
Turkey, were used for this purpose. The orbit 
determination process uses the distance between the 
station to satellite and the ground station antenna’s 
azimuth and elevation angles during the measurements. 
During one cycle, three orbit determination campaigns 
are performed: 
1st, before the North maneuver to be used for both 
calculation of North maneuver and initial Keplerian 
parameters of OOP on satellite board.  
2nd, after the North maneuver in order to calculate 
the efficiency of the applied maneuver and its cross 
coupling 
effect 
in 
tangential 
direction. 
This 
determination also used for East Maneuver calculation.  
3rd, after the East maneuver to determine the 
efficiency of the maneuver and the last orbit after the 
maneuver sequence. 
As it can be seen in the Figure 1, there are two 
maneuvers between two OOP update operations and 
three orbit determinations. That’s why, the On Ground 
Orbit Calculation (OGOC) considered as more reliable 
depending on the antenna tracking performance. This 
calculation take into account all perturbation effects, SC 
mass, effective cross-section area opposed to sun and 
tracking antennas angles and distance when calculating 
the new orbit. Similarly, the OOP also take into account 
the perturbations, thruster activities on satellite and all 
other parameters special to Spacecraft.  
Since the cumulative errors and on board 
unexpected activities may disturb the orbit, there should 
be a gap between OGOC and OOP. This gap may remain 
or change as long as new initial OOP parameters loaded. 
This means that Ephemeris data, which can be used for 
rough pointing to target SC [14], may be different than 
expected.  
III.   CALCULATION OOP AND OGOC DIFFERENCES 
A. Philosophy of the Calculations 
The analysis is done by dumping the on board 
orbital telemetries at specific time interval and 
propagating the freshest orbit on ground for the same 
time. Since the on board orbit propagator does not give 
semimajor axis value, it has been calculated by using 
longitude drift parameter [16]. After that, the Keplerian 
parameters were transferred to position and velocity [15]. 
The Euclidean distance has been calculated from rms of 
the position errors. 
The 
following 
figures 
are 
representing 
the 
differences between Keplerain parameters, position and 
velocity differences and Euclidean differences between 
these two calculations. 
B. Comparison of OOP and OGOC for the year 2010 
First, one year analysis was performed for the year 
2010; everyday, two points were taken into account for 
calculation. The on board OOP telemetries were dumped 
each day at around 5:00:00 GMT and 17:00:00 GMT and 
transferred to position and velocity. On ground side the 
up-to-the-minute orbit was calculated by OGOC. Table 1 
shows the rms values of the difference between OOP and 
OGOC, where µ is the mean and the σ is the standard 
deviation of the corresponding data. In table, 'a' is the 
semimajor-axis, 'i' is inclination, 'e' is the eccentricity of 
the orbit, 'RAAN' is the Right Ascension of Ascending 
Node, 'AoP' is the Argument of Perigee and MeanAnom 
represents Mean Anomaly of the orbit. x, y, z and Vx, Vy 
and Vz are position and velocity of the satellite with 
respect to Earth Center J2000 reference frame.

As shown in figures above and detailed in Table 1, 
for the year 2010 the mean Euclidean error between 
satellite calculation and on ground calculation is 5.116 
km and the standard deviation is 3.307 km. Only 0.266% 
of the values are bigger than 20 km, 0.532% of the values 
are between 15 km to 20 km. 9.587% of the values are 
between 10 km to 15 km and finally 89.61% of the 
values are less than 10km. 
 
C. Two-Week Analysis (between 18.10.2010 – 
02.11.2010) 
Further analysis was done between two OOP 
initialization operations, starting the calculation from 
18.10.2010 to 02.11.2010 by comparing the orbital 
parameters every three hours. The following figures 
show the variations of position and velocity. It is 
observed from the orbital parameters, whenever the new 
OOP parameters are loaded on the board the differences 
are getting closer to zero. The following figures give the 
variations of position and velocity errors.

D. 4-Day Analysis (between 24.10.2010 20:00GMT – 
29.10.2010 12:00GMT)  
 
In order to analyze the OOP drift, the comparison 
study was done where there was not any thruster activity 
(North man, East man or auto wheel unloading) and new 
OD. 
Starting from 24.10.2010 20:00 GMT to 29.10.2010 
12:00 GMT, similar analysis was done with 1 hour 
interval. As can be seen from figures below the most 
drifting parameters during that time interval are ∆x and 
∆Vy.

IV.   STUDY ON ANTENNA ANGLES USED FOR ORBIT 
DETERMINATION 
As indicated in previous sections, most of the time 
the differences in Keplerian Elements are observed 
between the angle data; RAAN, Argument of Perigee and 
Mean Anomaly. The differences in semimajor axis, 
eccentricity and inclination do not have as much affect as 
other three parameters. 
Further analysis was done in order to find the root 
cause of the differences in OOP and OGOC. Ranging 
measurements were analyzed for the year 2010. For that 
purpose, 75 ranging operations in 25 cycles were taken 
into account.  
The software, which is used for orbit computation, 
calculates the standard deviation of the angle components 
and distance in normal distribution after calculating the 
biases. That’s why the standard deviations may give 
some idea whether the qualities of the measurements are 
good or not.  
After the studies on ranging measurements, it has 
been seen that, whenever the standard deviations of 
azimuth and elevation are respectively high, it affects all 
the Keplerian parameters in calculation. The distance 
measurement seems not as major disturbance as the 
angular ones. 
V.   CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented the comparison of 
orbital calculation using on board satellite computer and 
on ground orbit propagator. It can be seen that the 
accuracy of the orbital parameters are crucial and key 
factors in maintaining a pointing between a GEO and a 
LEO satellite due to limited time interval. One has to pay 
attention to load the most accurate initial values to 
satellites’ On Orbit Propagator. The antennas which are 
used for the orbit determination must have a very 
accurate angular sensitivity in both azimuth and 
elevation. Most of the time less than 8 mdeg standard 
deviation has to be reached for angular resolutions.  This 
issue is as much important as the tracking data that were 
used as initial parameters calculation for GEO satellite 
orbit propagator software. The maximization of the 
quality of the tracking antennas eventually gives better 
proximity to real position of the satellite in orbit and 
requires less tracking field of view for LEO satellite 
beacon and laser beam.
