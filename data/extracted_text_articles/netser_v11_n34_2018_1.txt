Abstract—Transmission of time-critical messages in accident
situations is of paramount importance for safety applications in
VANET. These messages always require very low latency, which
is an important metric for these applications. In particular, they
impose real-time requirements. The MAC layer is an important
place to satisfy multitude of performance metrics and can be
greatly exploited to achieve low latency. In this paper, we exploit
the existing VeMAC protocol and modify its TDMA frame
structure to improve its performance for time-critical emergency
trafﬁc. We introduce additional emergency slots for transmission
of emergency messages so that vehicles with time-critical emer-
gency messages do not have to wait for their turn for transmission
of such messages. The modiﬁed version of the VeMAC protocol
results in improved performance for transmission of emergency
trafﬁc. The proposed protocol is evaluated through simulations.
The results show great improvements and achieve lower latency
in different scenarios.

I. INTRODUCTION
The transmission of time-critical emergency trafﬁc in
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) network is imperative to safeguard
safety of drivers and passengers, in this regard an emer-
gency optimized Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol
has been proposed in [1]. A Vehicular Ad-hoc Network
(VANET) [2], [3] is a network of moving vehicles, where
the vehicles, equipped with sufﬁcient sensing, computation,
and communication capabilities dynamically form an ad-hoc
network without any mandatory infrastructure. The sensing,
computation, and communication capabilities are housed into
a unit referred to as On Board Unit (OBU). VANETs are a
special class of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) [4], but
having unique characteristics such as high mobility of nodes,
dynamic network topology, varying communication environ-
ment, varying number of nodes, varying node distribution.
VANETs are designed for the purpose to exchange trafﬁc
or accidental information between Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)

and Vehicle-to-Road Side Unit (V2RSU) or Vehicle-to-
Infrastructure (V2I) networks as shown in Figure 1.
The V2V allows the direct communication among vehicles
through their OBUs, whereas the V2RSU involves vehicles
to communicate with the RSU or vice versa. Generally, the
RSUs are simply stationary network nodes that are mounted
on trafﬁc lights, street lights, road signs, etc. [5]. The cellular
base stations, which are already prevalent can serve as RSUs
and can be utilized to support V2RSU communication. An
other option may be to use LTE base stations to support
V2RSU communication [6].
VANETs
have
received
tremendous
attention
due
to
plethora of applications they support such as intelligent
transportation system (ITS), trafﬁc information dissemination,
infotainment, and the Internet connectivity on the go [7] [8].
Among these, the potential application of VANET is ITS,
where the core objective is to control accidents, reduce trafﬁc
congestion, and improve driving safety in urban areas. Owing
to importance of VANETs and the multitude of applications
supported by the technology, several efforts were taken to
standardize it. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
allocated 75 MHz spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for Dedi-
cated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) [11] solely for
the purpose of V2V and V2RSU communication. DSRC is

widely recognized as the IEEE 802.11p [12] Wireless Access
in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) and is considered the de-
facto standard for VANETs, it is based on IEEE 802.11 MAC
and IEEE 802.11a Physical (PHY) layer [13].
The prime goal of VANETs is to disseminate safety and
emergency messages, the timely transmission of such mes-
sages is critical to smooth operation of safety applications. The
prominent examples of safety and emergency applications are
primarily related to road accidents that cause loss of life of the
drivers and passengers in vehicles. Other emergency related
applications are intersection collisions warning, lane change
assistance, overtaking vehicle warning, emergency vehicle
warning, pre-crash warning, wrong way driving warning, sig-
nal violation warning, hazardous location warning, etc. [14].
In case of an emergency situation such as an accident as
depicted in Figure 1, it is imperative to timely communicate
such information to nearby vehicles so as to ensure safety
of other nearby vehicles. But if such safety message and
warning encounter longer delays, it becomes less effective to
prevent such accidental situation for nearby vehicles. There
is a life-time associated with the safety messages, which
requires them to be transmitted timely otherwise they become
ineffective. Table I depicts typical latency requirements for
various emergency services in VANETs applications.
As
latency
is
an
important
performance
metric
for
safety/emergency applications and can be controlled through
the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer so this requires for
efﬁcient medium sharing. Thus, an efﬁcient MAC protocol
should ensure high reliability, low end-to-end latency, and
high throughput. Therefore, we analyze and exploit the MAC
layer in reducing latency for safety/emergency messages in
the context of V2V communication.
In
this
paper,
we
propose
the
emergency
enhanced
VeMAC (EEVeMAC) protocol, which is a variant of the
VeMAC [15] protocol. VeMAC is a multichannel Time Divi-
sion Multiple Access (TDMA) MAC protocol, which is based
on ADHOC MAC [16]. The EEVeMAC protocol modiﬁes
the slotframe structure of VeMAC and uses emergency slots
to transmit time-critical emergency messages in case of road
accidents or collisions among vehicles in VANETs. In this
way, it targets to meet the real-time requirements of the
safety applications. The EEVeMAC achieves low latency for
emergency messages under different scenarios and is evaluated
by simulation. With reference to our earlier work [1], the main
contribution of this work are as follows:
• We extend the EEVeMAC superframe structure to four
emergency slots for the transmission of time-critical
messages.
• We extensively evaluate the EEVeMAC by simulations
with two emergency slots as well as with four emergency
slots.
• We demonstrate the protocol in the dense urban scenario,
and show how the addition of more emergency slots
impact the protocol behavior and latency.
• We analyze the effect of adding more slots on collision
rate and compare it with collision rate of two emergency
slots.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sec-
tion II, we give a background overview VeMAC, its working
principle, and frame structure. It talks about possible collisions
that can occur and explains slot divisions into disjunct sets.
We highlight the drawbacks of VeMAC for low latency as-
pects. Subsequently, Section III gives overview of the desired
changes in VeMAC to achieve low latency for transmission
of time-critical messages. In Section IV, we describe the
evaluation details of our proposed MAC protocol through
simulation. We discuss different real life scenarios for which
the protocol is evaluated. We also present details of the
simulation environment and the associated components that
were used to conduct simulations. Section V discusses the
results of simulation and shows latency improvements through
box plots. The results are presented for various scenarios
considered. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in Section VI.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we present background details of the
VeMAC protocol. We thoroughly explain the VeMAC, its
frame structure, and working mechanism.
VeMAC frame structure: VeMAC (no abbreviation) [15] is
a multi-channel TDMA protocol for VANETs, which utilizes
two radios. One of the radios is always tuned to the control
channel c0, while the other radio can be tuned to one of
the service channels. Each node should acquire exactly one
slot on the control channel. The node holds onto this slot
until it does not need it anymore or until a merging collision
occurs. These collisions occur if two nodes, with the same slot,
enter the same two-hop-neighborhood due to their mobility.
To reduce the number of collisions, the slots are divided into
disjunct sets L, R, and F as shown in Figure 2. The frame
structure is split in two disjunct sets based on the general
direction of movement of the vehicles. If a node travels in
general eastern direction, so 0 − 180◦ degrees of a compass

as shown in Figure 3, it would be in the R-subset (colored
in dark grey in Figure 2), the rest in the L-subset (colored in
light gray in Figure 2). F is an optional set for RSUs, which
has no direction of movement. That way, vehicles driving in
opposing directions are not competing for the same slot and
it reduces the relative speed of nodes competing for the same
slots and thereby increases the network topology persistence
within these sets.
The directions are provided by the GPS unit that each
vehicle is mandatory to be equipped with. With the GPS unit,
it is possible to synchronize the frames through the pulse per
second (PPS) signal provided by each GPS receiver. A frame
should start at the beginning of each GPS second.
The VeMAC protocol proposes a time division in a period-
ical frame structure of ﬁxed duration. One frame consists of
100 slots, where the length of one slot is of 1 ms duration,
hence a frame length of 100 ms. Each node should transmit
periodically one message per frame in its allocated slot. The
message consists of a header ﬁeld, two ﬁelds to organize
the allocation of slots on the service channels as well as
one ﬁeld for exchange of information for high-priority short
applications.
Each node should have a unique random ID to identify the
node. The header of the message of node x includes, amongst
others, the set N(x), which is the set of IDs of the one-hop
neighbors of node x on channel c0, from which node x has
received packets on channel c0 [15] in the previous 100 slots.
With the sets N(y) of each one-hop neighbor y, the node
is able to determine which slots are used by its two-hop
neighborhood. These slots, that the node must not use in
the next 100 time slots, are denoted by T0(x). With this
information, the node builds the set of available slots A(x) =
T0(x) respectively with regard to the directional division, e.g.,
A(x) = T0(x) ∩ R for vehicles driving in eastern direction.
These sets are the respective complementary set to T0(x), a
node can use any slot that is not explicitly marked as used by
its two-hop neighborhood. With the provided information, the
node is able to solve the hidden-terminal problem.
Node x also determines whether or not all of its one-hop
neighbors received its last broadcast by looking for its ID
in the right slot in all N(y). It thereby constitutes a reliable

directions.
broadcast mechanism. Due to the regular transmitting, there
exists an upper bound for transmission of messages of 100 ms.
However, 100 ms is a long time in high mobility scenarios.
Limitation of VeMAC for emergency messages: In 100 ms, a
car traveling on the highway with the recommended speed of
130 km/h already covers a distance of 3.6 meter and many
cars drive considerably faster on the highway in Germany.
While the 100 ms limit should be sufﬁcient in normal use,
it might be too long for emergency situations where fast
responses are crucial.
III. EMERGENCY ENHANCED VEMAC (EEVEMAC)
PROTOCOL
To reduce the latency in emergency situations, in this pa-
per, we propose Emergency Enhanced VeMAC (EEVeMAC),
which is the variant of the VeMAC protocol, by introducing
emergency slots (colored in orange) at the beginning of the L
set in slot 0 and R set in slot 50 as shown in Figure 4. They
are evenly distributed across the frame structure to reduce
average distance to any other slot. The slots are based on the
principle of Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) for the
transmission of time-critical emergency data.
In case of an emergency, a vehicle wants to send time-
critical data to notify other vehicles of its situation. In this way,
instead of waiting for its next allocated slot, the vehicle can
use these additional emergency slots to quickly transmit the
messages and avoid catastrophic situations. With additional
slots, vehicles have three possible slots instead of one to
transmit their data during emergency situations, effectively
bringing down the upper bound latency to 50 ms. While the
upper bound latency is 50 ms, the median average is further
reduced since a slot is able to choose from three possible slots
for emergency transmission instead of one.

Frame n+1
Figure 4. Frame structure of VeMAC with emergency slots. The emergency
slots are set at the beginning of the L set respectively the R set.
While the original VeMAC protocol does not deﬁne the
exact nature of N(x) for node x, we implemented them in
both VeMAC and EEVeMAC as pair of ID and slot number
to preserve the reliable broadcast mechanism. Through this
modiﬁcation, an ID can be twice in a set. A receiving node
then thereby acknowledges the reception of an emergency
message by including the ID of the sending node in the
emergency slot number in which it received the emergency
message. This implementation decision will extend the length
of the regular message by a maximum of 100 bytes (88 bits
total, 7 bits for representation of numbers up to 128, rounded
up to 8, multiplied by 100 slots).
IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The EEVeMAC protocol is evaluated through simulation
in OMNeT++ [17] simulation environment together with
Veins [18] and SUMO [19]. Veins is an open source sim-
ulation framework for vehicular network simulation. It bi-
directionally couples two softwares: OMNeT++ is utilized
for network simulation and the open source trafﬁc suite
SUMO of the German Aerospace Center provides the trafﬁc
simulation data. SUMO has several car-following-models and
lane-changing-models to reproduce realistic trafﬁc behavior.
Veins integrates MiXiM [20] for modeling physical layer
effects and provides realistic interference models. For our
simulation we use the two-ray-interference model provided by
Veins [21]. The simulation parameters are listed in Table II
whereas the scenario parameters are given in Table III.
Scenarios:
Two scenarios "straight" and "interchange" with reduced
road trafﬁc and normal road trafﬁc were tested to examine
the inﬂuence of node numbers on collisions.
Straight and interchange scenarios:
In the straight scenario, only trafﬁc from northern and
southern directions was present; in the interchange scenario
vehicles started from each direction. The highway interchange
Münster south, Germany was created in SUMO as shown in
Figure 5 and provided with trafﬁc statistic of the state ofﬁce
for road construction NRW [22] to achieve a realistic trafﬁc

scenario. To get two different but still realistic scenarios from
the trafﬁc statistic, the crossing trafﬁc from eastern/western
directions was left out in the straight scenario. Hence, only
trafﬁc from northern and southern directions was present in the
straight scenario. In the interchange scenario vehicles started
from each direction. In each scenario, 20% of cars were
presumed to change from one highway to the other highway
with 10% in each direction of the highway. The road trafﬁc
was implemented with the trafﬁc ﬂow functionality of SUMO,
which regularly introduces vehicles based on the number of
vehicles per hour. The scenario consists of a car that drives
on the highway in northern direction and wants to change the
highway in western direction on the interchange. It breaks
down on the clover interchange lane and sends an emergency
message. The car drove in north-west direction and hence it
has a regular slot in the ﬁrst half of the frame structure. In
each scenario, the emergency was set to three different slots.
To slot 1, directly after an emergency slot, to slot 25, in the
middle between two emergency slots, and to slot 49, right
before an emergency slot. Each conﬁguration was run with
50 repetitions to achieve a good conﬁdence interval.
In addition to the aforementioned scenarios, we conducted
a scenario "dense trafﬁc" with additional cars to simulate
extremely dense trafﬁc as it would be expected in urban trafﬁc.
We conducted it with the same parameters as the "Interchange"
scenario, but increased the numbers of vehicles to 13 600
vehicles per hour.
V. RESULTS
In this section, we present the results of two different
evaluations of the protocol. First, we discuss the results
obtained from using two emergency slots and then we show
the results with four emergency slots.
A. Results with two emergency slots
For the evaluation of EEVeMAC protocol, we measured
two values. The latency from the moment the emergency
occurred to the moment the one-hop neighbors receiving the
emergency message. The second evaluation value consists
of the occurrence of collisions, which were calculated
to the arithmetic average per node. The results showed an
overall improvement of the latency as further explained below.
1) Latency in straight scenario:
In the straight scenario, there were 21 nodes in transmit-
ting range of the emergency vehicle at the moment of the
emergency situation. The emergency message took a median
time of 69.99 ms to reach the one-hop neighbors of the
emergency vehicle in the original VeMAC. With EEVeMAC,
with the addition of emergency slots, this value was reduced
to 16.57 ms as shown in Figure 6. If the emergency occurred

in the ﬁrst slot after an emergency slot, the median latency
was closest to the original protocol with 34.58 ms (VeMAC)
vs. 25.01 ms (EEVeMAC) as depicted in Figure 7 (a), since
there is a good chance that the regular slot of the emergency
vehicle is between the slot in which the emergency occurs and
the next emergency slot.
If there is a regular slot in between the emergency and an
emergency slot, there is no difference between both protocols
as they would both transmit the emergency message in the
regular slot. The improvement occurs in the cases where the
emergency slot is used. The biggest improvement could be
measured with the emergency in slot 49, directly in front
of an emergency slot with 73.79 ms (VeMAC) vs. 0.61 ms
(EEVeMAC) as shown in Figure 7 (c). Without the emergency
slots, the emergency vehicle has to wait at least 50 ms if it
does not have slot 49 as its regular slot. It can not transmit
in the slot numbers 50-99 since the emergency vehicle is
driving in north western direction and hence prefers a slot
in the L-set in slot numbers 0-49 of the frame. With the
emergency right between two emergency slots, the median
latency was improved by 57.61 ms from 81.73 ms in the
original VeMAC to 24.12 ms in EEVeMAC with emergency
slots as depicted in Figure 7 (b).
2) Latency in interchange scenario: The results of the
interchange scenario with trafﬁc ﬂow from each direction
showed similar improvements as shown in Figure 8. In
this scenario, 35 nodes were present in transmitting range
during the emergency situation. The median latency was

improved by factor 3 from 48.73 ms (VeMAC) to 14.66 ms
(EEVeMAC). The biggest improvement could be once again
measured if the emergency occurred in the slot right before an
emergency slot 75.61 ms in the original VeMAC vs. 0.61 ms
in the EEVeMAC as depicted in Figure 7 (f), the smallest
improvement with the emergency right behind an emergency
slot 27.45 ms vs. 24.7 ms (Figure 7 (d)). When the emergency
occurred in the middle between two emergency slots, the
median latency still shows an improvement of 14.6 ms with
38.67 ms measured in the VeMAC and 24.07 ms in the
EEVeMAC as shown in Figure 7 (e).
3) Latency in dense trafﬁc scenario:
In the interchange scenario with additional trafﬁc, 63 nodes
were present in range of the emergency vehicle. The results
showed overall similar results as in the normal interchange
scenario. The median latency was measured slightly higher
with 16.05 ms (EEVeMAC) vs. 75.65 ms (VeMAC) as shown
in Figure 9.
In the straight scenario with dense trafﬁc conﬁguration
the latencies are closer together with 21.99 ms (EEVeMAC)
vs. 52.69 ms as shown in Figure 10. The respective results
of both scenarios in dense conﬁgurations for the different
emergency slot placements can be seen in Figure 11. In this
scenario, there were 159 nodes in range of the emergency
vehicle. In contrast between these two conﬁgurations one
can see that the latencies remain quite stable in EEVeMAC
with 27.05 ms in the straight dense scenario vs. 24.05 ms
in the interchange dense scenario for accident slot number
1, 24.08 ms vs. 22.07 ms for slot number 25, and 0.69 ms
vs 0.70 ms for slot number 49. In VeMAC, the data is
more heterogeneous since they do not have always the same
(emergency-) slots to transmit the data. The exact numbers
are 59.65 ms vs. 33.05 ms for accident in slot number 1,
51.15 ms vs 82.77 ms for accident in slot number 25, and
46.29 ms vs 85.05 ms for accident slot number 49.
4) Collisions:
The reservation of two slots for transmission of emergency
messages results in a higher expectation of collisions. Instead

nodes only have a maximum of 98 slots to choose from.
Therefore, we also measured the number of collisions. As
a measurement, we took the average number of collisions

inal VeMAC to 0.047 average collisions per node in the
EEVeMAC. The results of the second scenario show that the
effect is negligible compared to the effect the number of nodes
have. The VeMAC had 0.294 collisions per node whereas
the EEVeMAC had 0.290 collisions per node on average.
EEVeMAC having lower collisions per node shows that the
randomization has a bigger impact on the collisions than the
protocol changes in this trafﬁc density. The average number
of collisions increases further with additional trafﬁc in the
dense trafﬁc scenario. In the simulation runs with VeMAC,
0.528 collisions occurred whereas EEVeMAC measured 0.663
collisions.
B. Results with four emergency slots
To evaluate the impact of the number of emergency slots
on latency, we increased the number of emergency slots
to four. These additional slots were added in the middle
between the existing emergency slots on slot number 25 and
75. Each simulation conﬁguration was run with the same
simulation parameters as before, i.e., emergency occurrence
in slot 1, slot 25, and slot 49. The result diagrams are shown
in Figure 12.
1) Latency in straight scenario:
In the straight scenario with the emergency in slot 1, the
median latencies of the conﬁgurations with emergency slots
were quite close together at 23.14 ms (2 Slots) and 22.81 ms
for EEVeMAC (4 Slots). The simulation for VeMAC with-
out emergency slots had a much longer median latency at

58.15 ms as shown in Figure 12 (a). There were several
outliers in the variant with only 2 emergency slots as the next
possible transmission slot is further away when cars miss the
ﬁrst emergency slots due to collisions or other reasons.
A similar result can be seen in the next scenario Fig-
ure 12 (b), with the emergency happening in slot 25, with the
median latency of 22.30 ms (2 Slots) and 21.22 ms (4 Slots)
for EEVeMAC and 60.09 ms for VeMAC respectively.
The conﬁguration in Figure 12 (c) showed no big differ-
ence between both EEVeMAC variants with median latencies
around 1 ms (1.00 ms vs. 0.99 ms) as the emergency is right
before an emergency slot in both conﬁgurations. The VeMAC
took longer with a median latency of 58.54 ms.
Additionally, we also run some simulations with the dense
straight trafﬁc scenario to examine how the trafﬁc density
affects the latency in this case. The results were pretty
similar with 21.99 ms combined median latency with two
Emergency Slots vs. 20.14 ms combined median latency
with four Emergency Slots. The combined results are shown
Figure 13.
2) Latency in interchange scenario:
The simulation conﬁguration in Figure 12 (d) with four
emergency slots showed a reduction of the latency for the
EEVeMAC. The median latency of four slots EEVeMAC was
measured to be 23.13 ms and as much as expected lower than
25 ms maximum needed to the next emergency slot. This also
shows in the absence of latency measurements higher than
25 ms. With only two emergency slots, this median rises to
26.75 ms, but in case of VeMAC without emergency slots, it
is the highest at 38.80 ms.
In
both
of
the

conﬁgurations
in Figure 12 (e) and Figure 12 (f), the results of the two slots
EEVeMAC and the four slots EEVeMAC were the same as
they had the same conﬁgurations of emergency slots from
their respective position onwards, whereas the VeMAC has
higher latency as expected.
3) Collisions:
In the straight scenario, the mean number of collisions was
measured lower in the four slots scenario than in the two slots
scenario. Since the results are very close together with 0.0098
collisions per node in the two slots scenario in comparison to

0.0092 collisions per node in the four slots scenario.
It is assumed that it is an outcome from the randomness
and does not have the cause in the changed slot conﬁguration.
Although the conﬁguration with no emergency slots showed
fewer mean collisions per node with 0.0068. The trafﬁc
ﬂow had a much bigger impact on the collision rate in the
interchange scenario.
The mean number of collisions increased by two magnitude
up to 0.681 collisions per node in the two slot scenario and
0.685 collisions with four slots scenario. Without emergency
slots, it had still a similar magnitude with 0.615 average
collisions per node.
VI. CONCLUSION
The introduction of emergency slots in VeMAC shows great
improvements for the transmission of high-priority emergency
messages. Instead of median latencies of up to 80+ ms we
achieved in our simulation experiments a maximum of median
latencies smaller than 25 ms. The latencies were reduced by
factor of 3-4. The median and average latencies were improved
in each study conﬁguration. The reduction of available slots
for regular transmission through the reservation of emergency

slots had negligible effects on the rate of collisions. In
situations where several vehicles try to send out an emergency
message at the same time, competition emerges and latency
increases as the vehicles fail to acquire the emergency slot.
The vehicles can still use their normal slots to transmit the
emergency message, which means that the average latency
converges to the maximum latency of VeMAC, e.g., 100 ms.
Further, with the introduction of four emergency slots, me-
dian latencies were almost consistent with the two emergency
slots conﬁgurations. Overall, EEVeMAC with emergency slots
shows great improvements for transmission of time-critical
trafﬁc compared to VeMAC.
