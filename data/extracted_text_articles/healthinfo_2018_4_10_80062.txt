Abstract—Effective and convenient self-management of health
requires collaborative utilization of health data from different
services provided by healthcare providers, consumer-facing prod-
ucts and even open data on the Web. Although health data
interoperability standards include Fast Healthcare Interoperabil-
ity Resources (FHIR) have been developed and promoted, it is
impossible for all the different categories of services to adopt in
the near future. The objective of this study aims to apply Semantic
Web technologies to integrate the health data from heteroge-
neously built services. We present an Web Ontology Language
(OWL)-based ontology that models together health data from
FHIR standard implemented services, normal Web services and
Linked Data. It works on the resource integration layer of the
presented layered integration architecture. An example use case
that demonstrates how this method integrates the health data
into a linked semantic health resource graph with the proposed
ontology is presented.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic diseases have become one of the main threats to
people’s health [1]. The caring of chronic diseases requires
long-term and periodical management by both the patients
and healthcare staff. The high cost and inconvenience of the
chronic diseases caring make it better for the patients to
perform self-management [2].
The development of information and communication tech-
nologies makes it much more feasible for health self-
management. Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have
been adopted by many healthcare providers. Portable medical
devices are used by patients for self-monitoring physiological
parameters [2][3]. Moreover, many people today use wearable
devices and health applications to record and manage their
health [4][5].
The aforementioned systems, devices and applications
record a huge amount of health data about patients. The collab-
orative utilization of the various health data has the potential to
support chronic disease patients in having more effective and
convenient self-management [6][7]. Unfortunately, all these
health data became data silos, which can only be utilized in
their own places with very limited outside collaboration. One
reason behind this situation is that the systems holding these
health data are heterogeneously built.
Web services technologies have promoted the interoperabil-
ity of various software applications running on distributed and
diversiﬁed systems. However, the lack of common standards
adoption still makes it problematic for integrating health data
with heterogeneous data models.
Various works have been done on health informatics
standards, among which the Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resources (FHIR) created by the Health Level Seven Inter-
national (HL7) organization is regarded as the next gener-
ation of health information interoperability framework that
combines the previous standards’ features [8][9]. It leverages
common Web standards, which includes applying REpresen-
tational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and JSON
serialization format, besides the previous supported XML, as
interfaces for health information exchange [10].
The FHIR working group is also working on the FHIR
Linked Data module. It utilizes Semantic Web technologies
include Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web
Ontology Language (OWL) to enhance its semantic expression
capability and to facilitate inference and data linkage across
datasets [8][10].
The work in this paper follows the path of FHIR to
apply Semantic Web technologies and the REST resource
model to integrate health data from different services as
linked resources. We aim to link health services that adopted
HL7 FHIR, implemented RESTful Web APIs or published as
Linked Data, i.e., services with different levels of interoperabil-
ity. The proposed approach is built on top of a semantic data
aggregation method in [11]. The heterogeneous health data
are modeled as conceptual information resources by using the
Linked Health Resources (LHR) ontology. It makes the entire
method a framework that aggregates health data from different
sources and integrates them as health resources with semantics
for upper level utilization.
The reminder of this paper is organized as follow. Section
II introduces the previous works on integrating health data.
Section III presents the method, which includes the health
resource modeling, LHR ontology and the integration architec-
ture. An example use case will be presented in Section IV to
demonstrate the health data integration process by the proposed
method. Finally, the paper will end with the conclusion section.

RELATED WORK
Many works have been done on integrating health data to
support healthcare monitoring and decision making for either
healthcare professionals or patients. In order to enable health-
care providers to remotely monitor and interpret health trends
of diabetes patients, a method to integrate blood glucose data
recorded from a patient-facing device to an EHR system was

presented in [2]. The integration was achieved by transmitting
the glucose data to the device vendor’s iOS mobile phone
application. It shares the data with the Apple HealthKit, which
then sends the data to the EHR system. This solution is locked
to the iOS platform since it depends on the Apple HealthKit.
V. Gay and P. Leijdekkers demonstrated a mobile ap-
plication approach to aggregate health and ﬁtness data to
enable interoperability [5]. It was achieved by an Android
application they developed with third-party partners to connect
with wearable devices, EHR systems and other applications.
A patient-centric mobile healthcare system that integrates data
from body sensors was presented in [12]. The integration was
implemented by leveraging a RESTful Web service on the
application layer of the system to enable data sharing among
applications.
There are also works done with Semantic Web technologies
to enable health data integration with semantics. SENHANCE
is a framework proposed by I. Pagkalos and L. Petrou to
integrate patient self-reported health data on social network
with hardware sensor observation data supported by Semantic
Web technologies [3]. It models the former type of data
as human sensor observations together with hardware sensor
observations described by the ontology they proposed. B.
Tilahun et al. presented a Linked Data-based system to retrieve
and visualize heterogeneous health data in a ﬂexible and
reusable way [13]. The system utilized a set of Semantic Web
technologies include RDF, Fuseki and SPARQL (SPARQL
Protocol and RDF Query Language) for data representation,
storage and query.
To integrate functionalities of different devices for support-
ing home-based care, an integration platform architecture was
presented by Y. Trinugroho, F. Reichert and R. Fensli [14].
A smart home ontology that covered the modeling of person,
device and context was proposed to enhance the reasoning
process. To give semantics for the exchanged data between
devices and systems in the home context, another smart home
ontology was proposed in [15]. In addition, for the purpose
of increasing the usability, the integration of smart home data
with other data sources was also explored by applying Linked
Data principles.
Despite there have been many works on using Semantic
Web technologies to integrate health data, the integration
between the ordinary health services and the services im-
plemented with the next generation standard FHIR remains
unexplored.

METHODS
The LHR framework intends to integrate 3 categories of
health data sources: FHIR-enabled services, health services
implemented Web APIs (satisfy certain REST constraints)
and health related Linked Data. The 3 categories cover most
available health related services and data, either for the current
stage or the near future development trends.
A. The Nature of Health Resource
Today most of the health services that provide data access
are providing Web APIs, which usually serve data in JSON or
XML serialization format via HTTP methods. Most of these
Web APIs claim to be RESTful services. Though in many
cases they only follow a few of the REST constraints, which
makes them actually not RESTful services. However, most of
the services follow one of the fundamental elements of REST
to organize the accessible data as resources, which is the unit
of information in REST architectural style [16]. It makes them
capable of being modeled together under the LHR framework.
In order to improve the implementability and to be more
developer-friendly, the HL7 FHIR standard leverages the com-
mon Web technologies and concepts. FHIR therefore follows
the REST architectural style as well, and is built upon a set of
resources. Resource in the case of FHIR means “a collection of
information models that deﬁnes the data elements, constraints
and relationships for the objects relevant to healthcare” [8].
The objects that are modeled as resources include Patient,
Observation, OperationOutcome and so on. Each resource
is deﬁned in a certain structure with references to other
resources, and represented in XML, JSON and an additional
RDF serializable format Turtle.
Linked Data is a practice of publishing structured and
interlinked data with semantic meanings on the Web to make it
a Web of data [17]. It was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee as an
application of Semantic Web technologies. The Linked Data
rules align well with some of the REST constraints. There have
been many works on linking REST Web services and Linked
Data [18][19]. Different levels of practices exist on publishing
Linked Data according to the 5 star rating system developed by
Berners-Lee [17]. A proper practice of publishing Linked Data
should identify interlinked things (data items or real world
entities represented on the Web) with HTTP Uniform Resource
Identiﬁers (URIs) and serve corresponding information in RDF
serializable formats or SPARQL query service.
Accordingly, we can regard anything identiﬁed by an HTTP
URI as a resource, i.e., a node in an RDF graph. And the
resource identiﬁed by the root path of an HTTP URI can be
regarded as a service, i.e., a root node of an RDF graph.

B. Modeling of Health Resource
Based on the nature of health Web services and Linked
Data services, each service contains a set of resources, no the
service is implemented with FHIR or not. Let Si be a health
service, where Si = ∑ Rj denotes that service Si serves a set
of resources Rj.
We assume that a person Pk has several health services,
which have been integrated together into his or her health

Figure 2. Linked Health Resource Ontology (with vital objects), the integrated health services and resources are modeled as sub-classes of the lhr:Resource
class, which is the fundamental class in this ontology. Certain equivalent classes and properties are mapped to FHIR vocabulary for the integration of FHIR
resources
resource graph G(Pk). A health resource graph means a
set of health information being modeled as resources with
relationships, which maps to the RDF graph data model. Then
G(Pk) = ∑ Si = ∑ ∑ Rij denotes that a person’s health
status can be described by sets of health resources from a
collection of services. The sets of health resources can be
represented in an integrated health resource graph. Figure 1
shows a simple overview of the process that resources from
different services being integrated into a health resource graph.
Furthermore, a resource itself contains several objects:
•
A resource may have interlinked (subordinate or re-
lated) resources Rlink.
•
A resource may have data items Dr that describe
certain status about a person, for example proﬁle data,
observation data, etc.
•
A resource can be annotated by a set of n semantic
tags Tr, where n ∈ [0,∞].
A resource can therefore be represented as a tuple Rj =
(Dr, Rlink, Tr).
C. Linked Health Resource Ontology
When we look into the very nature of the relationships
among person, service and resource, we can see that a service
as a unit also has resources that are interlinked, which is
the same as a resource. It makes a service to be a resource.
The same applies to a person, it then makes a person to be
a resource as well. Therefore, we model the three types of
objects all as sub-classes of class lhr:Resource under the LHR
ontology, where the basic relationships among them being
lhr:hasResource and lhr:isResourceOf. Figure 2 shows the
main classes and properties in the LHR ontology. It is built
via the W3C recommendation standards, the RDF Schema
(RDFS) data modeling vocabulary [20] and the OWL ontology
language [21].
As we have stated, the class lhr:Resource is the super-
class of all the involved resources. The class lhr:Service is a
sub-class of lhr:Resource, and represents a set of resources in
a relatively separated territory to indicate a source of health
data. The class lhr:Person represents a person who owns all the
health resources. The class lhr:HealthResource represents the
person instance’s all health resources that are interlinked from
normal health Web services and FHIR implemented services.
Usually Linked Data are not about only a single person, so
resources from Linked Data is classiﬁed as the more generic
class lhr:LDResource.
To link the FHIR health-related resources, which are
categorised as clinical resources in FHIR, we map those
clinical resources into the LHR ontology. For instance, the
fhir:Observation is mapped to lhr:FHIRObservation, which is
a sub-class of lhr:HealthResource. Health resources from other
normal Web services or Linked Data sets can also map from a
class that have been deﬁned in other ontologies or vocabularies
to a sub-class of lhr:HealthResource. Alternatively, the origin
resource can instantiate directly from lhr:HealthResource if
there is no embedded class.
Object properties around the class lhr:Resource and its sub-
classes are the transitive property lhr:hasResource and its sub-
properties include lhr:hasHealthResource, lhr:hasLDResource
and lhr:hasInterLinkedResource. Among which, the prop-
erty
lhr:hasHealthResource
has
lhr:Resource
as
its
do-
main and lhr:HealthResource as its range, the property
lhr:hasLDResource has lhr:Resource as its domain and
lhr:LDResource as its range.
The class lhr:DataItem is used to represent the data model
of a lhr:Resource if it has no predeﬁned model, and class
lhr:ObservationData is used to represent the health data model
of a lhr:HealthResource. Resources from FHIR service have
predeﬁned data models in RDF, therefore, the object of which
are mapped to an instance of lhr:ObservationData. The rela-
tion is represented by a sub-property of the object property
lhr:hasObservationData.
With the sub-class relations and transitive sub-property
relations deﬁned in the LHR ontology, we can easily in-
fer an instance of lhr:Person has a set of instances of
lhr:HealthResource being linked together without complex
inference rules.

D. Layered Architecture towards Integration
For integrating different health data into one ontological
model with LHR, we need to ﬁrstly aggregate the health data
together from different services. Figure 3 illustrates the layered
architecture for integrating health data from different cate-
gories of services, as aforementioned that the LHR framework
intends to integrate, into a LHR ontological model.

Figure 3. Layered architecture of health data integration with Linked Health
Resource. The ontology modeling process works on the resouce integration
layer, which receives the aggregated resource graph from the data
aggregation layer
From bottom to top, the ﬁrst layer is the data API layer.
This layer simply requests data from services via APIs, e.g.,
Web APIs or Linked Data APIs. The retrieved data are then
aggregated together into a semantic resource graph on the data
aggregation layer.
In order to be effectively aggregated into the semantic
resource graph, it is necessary for the normal Web services
to have some simple semantic annotations with commonly
used vocabularies. Besides the Semantic RESource Tagging
(SemREST) in [22], JSON-LD context embedding to ordinary
JSON representation [23] or other Semantic Web service
annotation methods such as the ones presented in [24]–[26]
could also be used to semantically annotate the resource.
As FHIR implemented services follow the FHIR standards,
therefore, the data resources from these services come with
standard structure and semantics. Some of the services even
implemented FHIR/RDF representations. Data retrieved from
Linked Data services are already RDF serializable if they were
implemented properly. So the two categories of services can
be aggregated into a semantic resource graph without much
effort.
The semantic resource graph aggregated with the retrieved
health data is then sent to the information resource integration
layer. The LHR ontology is used to extract health resources
from the resource graph for integration. One thing that needs to
be noted is that the concept resource in the semantic resource
graph from the data aggregation layer is slightly different from
the lhr:Resource in LHR ontology. The former resource maps
to a resource in a REST Web service, it contains functional
meta information of its Web API. Only its representation unit
will be integrated into the integration layer as an instance of
lhr:HealthResource.
On top of the information resource integration layer there
could be semantic APIs that utilize the health resource in-
stances of lhr:Resource and the contained lhr:DataItem. Pro-
viding APIs on modelized resources in this manner has the
potential to provide a uniﬁed interface to utilize the health data
from different sources in the wrapped model for applications
like health data visualization, analytics and so on. Alterna-
tively, applications could also utilize health data in the form
of semantic resource graph above the data aggregation layer.
Thanks to all the resources are represented in RDF on both
the aggregation layer and integration layer, it is therefore able
to serve SPARQL queries directly.
IV.
A USE CASE OF INTEGRATION
To demonstrate the LHR health data integration process,
an example use case will be presented in this section. It is
depicted as an idealized scenario where it leaves aside some
details like the authentication and invocation of services. The
demonstration prototype was implemented as two parts: the
aggregation layer was implemented in Python with RDFlib
package, and the integration layer was implemented in Java
with Jena framework. The example use case that will be
presented focuses on the integration layer since it is the
main content of this paper. Therefore, the working process
of aggregation is omitted here.
In a scenario that a patient named Alice has taken some
medical examination at a healthcare center, which provides
health data access via an HL7 FHIR implemented service. At
the same time, she also has been using a Fitbit health band to
track her daily activity and life style data for some time. In
order to have a periodical comprehensive view of her health,
she wants to integrate her blood glucose examination data from
the healthcare center and her data of daily steps performed
together.
For demonstration purpose, the data sample of blood glu-
cose uses the FHIR ofﬁcial observation example [27]. Listing
1 shows the simpliﬁed resource of Alice’s blood glucose
observation data in RDF/Turtle format. This resource is passed
through the data aggregation layer to the integration layer
directly since the FHIR observation resource is an instance of
the class fhir:Observation that maps to lhr:FHIRObservation.
Next, we are going to integrate the daily steps performed
data. Fitbit provides Web APIs to access the data recorded
by their wearable devices. For integrating the data from Fitbit
Web service into the LHR model, we choose to apply the Sem-
REST method [11][22] to annotate its service description and
aggregate the resource representation on the data aggregation
layer. The generated semantic resource graph of Fitbit daily
steps performed is partly shown in Listing 2 in RDF/Turtle
format. It is then passed to the integration layer.

As
mentioned
before,

blood

is

of
lhr:FHIRObservation,

is
an
equivalent
class
to

For
the

of
accessing
data
value
of

resources
with
LHR,
the
property
fhir:Observation.valueQuantity
is
mapped
to
the
corresponding
object
property
lhr:hasFHIRObservation.valueQuantity,
which
is
a
sub-class
of
lhr:hasObservationData.
And
the
fhir:Observation.effectiveDateTime
is
mapped
to
the
corresponding
data
property
lhr:hasObservationDateTime.
Other
objects
could
be
accessed
directly
through
the
fhir:Observation
instance,
including
the
fhir:Observation.code,
fhir:Observation.interpretation
and
fhir:Observation.referenceRange. Furthermore, for a more
convenient utilization for upper level APIs, the object of
fhir:Observation.code could be mapped to lhr:DataItem’s
value type to indicate the semantic meaning of the data value.
For the Fitbit daily steps performed resource, the sem-
rest:Representation instance ﬁtbit:representation1 in the re-
source graph from the aggregation layer is instantiated as
a lhr:HealthResource. Since the steps data has been anno-
tated as the property semrest:dataItem’s objects, so it can be
mapped to the objects of lhr:hasObservation, a sub-property of
lhr:hasDataItem, to this LHR health resource. The data value,
date time and tag could also be mapped to the objects in the
ontology for the upper level APIs.
The RDF of the integrated health resources is depicted
graphically in Figure 4 with relatively important objects.
Each square block represents an instance with its class and
super-class. Instances are linked by object properties and data
properties.
As one of the methods that can utilize the integrated
health resources, a simple SPARQL query in Listing 3 is
executed to query for Alice’s integrate health resources. The
query result is presented in Figure 5. We can see that both
the FHIR observation resource and the Fitbit resource are
retrieved, since both the two types of resources were modeled
as lhr:HealthResource directly or through sub-class relation.
As the value, date time and value type have been mapped into
the LHR ontology, so we can query them with the properties
of lhr:DataItem. The value type of each data item is actually
an URI. It not only works as the value type’s dereferencable
URI for indicating the semantic meaning, but also integrates
the resource under LHR with other Linked Data, where the

In order to demonstrate the health data integration in a
simple view, the example use case was performed far from
a realistic way of managing health. However, it is capable to
work in real cases since the data integration process is the
same.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a method to integrate HL7
FHIR interoperability standard implemented health services
and normal Web based health services with a few semantic
annotations. The proposed OWL based LHR ontology modeled
different categories of health resources together in a clear
simple way for upper level uniﬁed utilization. Thanks to the
application of Semantic Web technologies and the well aligned
conceptual model with Linked Data, this method can also
integrate health resources from the Linked Open Data on the
Web without much effort.
With the capability to integrate different categories of
health services, which usually contain health data from health-
care providers, consumer-facing products and health research,
the presented method has the potential to support self-
management of health especially for people with chronic
diseases. To achieve a satisﬁed interoperable integration, it
is ideal that the involved health services could implement
interoperability standards such as HL7 FHIR. However, ob-
stacles include services with legacy system problems make it
impossible for all the services to realize in the near future.
Diversity may exist among the different health services. The
approaches like the one we proposed can act as a bridge to
connect the heterogeneously implemented services. Integrating
health data as an ontological model with semantic meaning is
beneﬁcial for upper level utilization in a more uniﬁed way.
Limitations, however, exist in this work. It still requires
extra semantic annotation by the service providers for integrat-
ing the normal Web health services. Otherwise, it is unable
to identify which part of the resource should be integrated.
The more semantic annotations embedded in a resource’s
representation, the more machine-understandable integration it
will be, which can promote more useful applications. Manual
ontology mapping is also needed for the resources from the
data aggregation layer to be integrated on the integration layer.
For future works, we plan to evaluate this method with

more real world services for improvement and validation.
In addition, the upper level semantic utilization APIs and
applications will be explored for the collaborative utilization
of health data.
