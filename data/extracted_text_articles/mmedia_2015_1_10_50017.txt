Abstract— The sharing of digital images has become a 
common practice in our daily life, with the risk that these 
images can be accessed and easily modified by malicious people 
with the intention of causing moral or economic damage; or 
even to incriminate innocent people in legal issues.  This paper 
proposes an algorithm to authenticate digital images by means 
of blind tampering detection against one of the principal 
manipulations that an image is put through, i.e. the Copy-Move 
which intends to erase or replicate a part of the image. The 
development and evaluation results of this proposal are 
presented in this paper.

 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, a huge amount of digital images, with or 
without commercial value, are easily shared among the 
general public via Internet or stored using any of the several 
available digital formats. Such images, which include 
private pictures or confidential images, have in general high 
quality and can be easily manipulated using computational 
tools such as: Photoshop®, Corel Paint Shop®, etc.  Such 
kind of malicious attacks can be divided in copy-move and 
cut-and paste attacks.  The copy-move is one of the most 
studied forgery techniques which consist in copying a 
portion of an arbitrary size and shape of a given image and 
pasting it in another location of the same image.  Clearly, 
this technique is useful when the forger wants either to hide 
or duplicate something that is already present in the original 
image [1][2].  On the other hand, in the cut-and-paste attack 
or splicing, the attacker firstly chooses a region of a given 
image and pastes it into a second one, usually to alter its 
content and meaning.  Splicing is probably more common 
than the copy-move attack, because it is far more flexible 
and allows the creation of images with a very different 
content with respect to the original image [2]. 
The image authentication has been a topic of active 
research during the last several years, because the tampered 
images may cause moral or economic damages to the 
persons related to the maliciously modified images, giving 
as a result the publication of several image authentication 
techniques, which can be broadly classified into two types: 
active and passive image authentication methods.  The main 
difference among them is that in the active methods some 
useful information is extracted from the image to be 
authenticated and embedded in it or stored separately.  This 
information is then used during the authentication process.  
On the other hand, in the passive methods, also called 
forensic methods, the authentication must be carried out 
without previous information about the processing that the 
image to be authenticated had passed through [1][2]. 
The active methods can be classified into two categories: 
the watermarking-based and the image hashing-based 
schemes, both of them with advantages as well as some 
drawbacks.  The watermarking-based techniques embed an 
imperceptible signal into the image to be authenticated to 
create a watermarked image.  The embedded signal can be a 
random signal or a signal derived from the image to be 
authenticated. During the authentication process, the 
watermark is extracted from the watermarked image to be 
used for authentication purpose [3] or even to restore the 
tampered image.  Several high performance methods for 
embedding information into digital images have appeared in 
the literature [3][4][5].  These methods perform fairly well 
and in several cases have the ability to restore the tampered 
regions [3]. However, if the parameters are not properly 
chosen some distortion may be introduced in the image to be 
protected [3].  On the other hand, the image hashing-based 
techniques, or multimedia fingerprinting, take out a set of 
robust features from the image to be authenticated to create 
a compact code, called perceptual hashing code, which is 
stored or transmitted separately.  During the authentication 
process, employing the same method, an authentication code 
is extracted from the suspicious image, which is then 
compared with the stored code and if the difference between 
both codes is smaller than a given threshold the suspicious 
image is considered as authentic; otherwise it is determined 
as a tampered image.  It is necessary to point out that the 
perceptual hashing technique is different from the 
cryptographic hashing since in the last one, any change in 
the image to be authenticated, even if it is perceptually 
similar to the original one, produces a quite different hash 
value [6]; while the perceptual hashing technique has the 
capacity of discriminating between malicious attacks and 
distortions resulting for standard image processing tools.  
Because these methods have proved to be very efficient, 
several image hashing algorithms [6][7][8] have been 
suggested.  These methods do not distort the image, 
although the authentication code must be stored or 
transmitted separately.

In many practical situations the investigators have only 
the image under analysis, such that passive image 
authentication schemes are required, which carry out the 
authentication process analyzing the processing artifacts to 
infer the potential alterations introduced during the image 
generation process [1].  This paper analyzes image 
authentication schemes to deal with images tampered using 
the copy-move scheme.  This tampering method creates a 
forged image by copying a certain portion of an image and 
moving it to another part of the same image.  [1].   The main 
characteristic of this kind of tampered images is that, 
because the duplicated region is picked from the image 
itself, the noise components, texture and color patterns are 
compatible with the rest of the image.  This fact makes it not 
easy to detect this kind of forgeries.   
The authentication of this kind of tampered images has 
many important practical applications giving as a result the 
proposal of several authentication algorithms during the last 
several years.  Among them, there is the feature matched 
technique proposed by Pan and Lyu [10], which employs 
local statistics features together with a verification step 
which tries to find duplicated regions using normalized 
correlations maps and thresholding.  The main weakness of 
this method is its lack of accuracy [10].  Jaberi et al. [11] 
proposed a copy-move detection method in which firstly the 
Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) [12][13] is used to 
extract the key points, then the affine transform of a region 
around each key point is estimated and finally, to reduce the 
false detection, the Dense Mirror Invariant Feature 
Transform (MIFT) is estimated [11].  This scheme performs 
fairly well although it does not work well if the duplicated 
region corresponds to a flat surface where not key points are 
located.  Kumar et al. [14] propose an image authentication 
scheme in which the image under analysis is divided in 
overlapping sub blocks which are then transformed to the 
frequency domain using the Discrete Cosine Transform 
(DCT), keeping only the lowest frequency components.  
These components are then ordered in a lexicographic way 
to carry out the evaluation of each sub block.  This scheme 
performs well when the duplicated regions do not presents 
scaling or rotational distortions.  A similar approach was 
also proposed by Fridrich [15] which presents the same 
advantages and disadvantages.  Popescu [16] proposes to 
replace the DCT by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
to reduce the dimensionality of features vector.  However 
this method lacks of robustness against even small rotations 
of the copy moved regions.  Several other methods have 
been proposed, some of them based on intensity method, 
which assume that the image may be under any JPEG, 
rotation or scaling operations [17].    To solve some of the 
problems still present in the image authentication algorithms 
describe above, this paper proposes an algorithm that allows 
the authentication of digital images that have gone under 
copy-move tampering attacks.  Evaluation results show that 
the proposed scheme performs fairly well when it is required 
to authenticate tampered images, even when the duplicated 
region has been rotated and scaled.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section II 
provides a detailed description of proposed algorithm.  In 
Section III the evaluation results using the CASIA database 
[21] are given.  Finally Section IV provides the conclusions 
of the paper. 
 
 
Figure 1 Proposed image authentication system 
II. 
PROPOSED IMAGE AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM 
The proposed image authentication system is shown in 
Fig. 1.  Here the image under analysis is converted to a gray 
scale image and divided in 16 blocks.  Next, the magnitude 
of the bi-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2D-FFT) 
[18], the Discrete Radon Transform (DRT) [7][9] and 2D-
DCT [18] of each block are estimated.  The main idea 
behind the proposed schema is to take advantage of the 
translation invariance property of the 2D-FFT, the rotation 
and scaling properties of the DRT and the compression 
capability of the DCT.  Next, the cross correlation between 
the 16 blocks in each domain is calculated and the block 
index with the higher correlation values greater than a given 
threshold, are kept to form a matrix of 3×16 elements.  Here, 
the threshold is given by the highest correlation value 
between the 16 blocks.  At the end of this process a matrix 
2

of 3×16 elements is obtained containing the possibly 
tampered blocks. The second part of the authentication 
process can be more easily explained with the example 
shown in Fig. 2.  Here, we look for a block which can be 
found as tampered by at least two of the three frequency 
transformations applied and that also correspond to the 
block that is being compared to.  
 
 
Figure 2.  Block identified as tampered by each transform. 
 
 
Figure 3. (a) Original image, (b) tampered image, (c) matched points in 
blocks 7 and 9. 
 
For example, block 2 is highly related with block 6, 
according to Radon and 2D-DCT transforms.  In a similar 
form block 6 appears to be related with block 2.  Thus, 
blocks 2 and 6 are the first blocks to be compare using a 
SURF detector [19].  After this evaluation, if at least one 
matched point is found the block is considered as tampered; 
otherwise the block is labeled as untampered. The system 
continues analyzing the next block that is found to be related 
with other block according to at least two transformations.  
For example, block 4 is related with block 15.  Again, 
blocks 4 and 15 are compared among them using the SURF 
(Speeded Up Robust features) [19] and Maximally Stable 
Extremal Regions, (MSER) [20]; and labeled as tamper or 
untampered depending if there are matched points or not 
inside them.  This process continues until all blocks of the 
image related among them according to at least two 
transforms are labeled as tampered or untampered.  Next, if 
after all blocks are analyzed the decision is that all of them 
are untampered, the blocks related with other block 
according to only one transform are analyzed.  For example 
block 4 is related with the block 13 according with the 2D-
FFT and block 9 and with block 7.  After applying the 
SURF [19] and MSER [20], it was found that in block 9 and 
block 7 at least one matched point is found, as shown on 
Fig. 3 and then the system decides that the image was 
tampered.  This process can be repeated in each one of the 
16 regions for a more accurate evaluation to detect region 
duplications inside each sub-block.  This fact reduces the 
computational complexity avoiding the use of overlapping 
blocks.  Next subsections describe each stage of proposed 
system. 
A. 2D- Discrete Fourier Transform 
The bi-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D-
DFT) has found a large amount of applications in several 
fields, because it and its inverse allow analyzing the 
frequency spectral characteristics of images [18].  The 2D- 
DFT pair is given by

Some general statements can be made about the 
relationship between the frequency components of the 
Fourier transform and spatial features of an image. For 
instance, because the frequency is directly related to the 
spatial changes rate, it is not difficult intuitively to associate 
frequencies in the 2D-DFT with intensity variations patterns 
in an image, because the low frequencies correspond to the 
slowly varying intensity components of an image and the 
higher frequency components correspond to the faster 
intensity changes in the image [18].  Other important feature 
is the fact that the magnitude of the 2D-DFT is translation 
invariant, i.e.

B. Radon Transform 
The Radon Transform [7] is used in this proposal 
because it is robust against rotation, scaling and translation.  
The Radon transform for a set of parameters (, ) is the line 
integral through the image f(x,y), where the line 
corresponding to the value of (,) is given by (4)

where () is the Dirac delta function which is equal to one 
when =0 and zero for all other arguments [7][9].  The 
definition of the Radon transform forces the summation of 
f(m,n) along the line mcosnsin and consequently the 
value g(,) for any (,) is the sum of the value of f(m,n) 
along this line [7].  The Radon transform has the following 
useful properties for the affine transformations of an image 
[7][9].

The 2D Discrete Cosine Transform is widely used in 
image compression applications, because it is able to 
represent a given image with a reduced number of 
coefficients, besides that the DCT of a real a valued signal is 
also real valued.  The general equation of a 2D-DCTof an

D. SURF Detector 
 
The SURF [19] employs integral images and efficient 
scale space construction to generate key points and 
descriptors very efficiently.  SURF uses two stages namely 
key point detection and key point description.  The detector 
is based on the Hessian matrix with the Laplacian-based 
detector. It relies on integral images to reduce the 
computation time and therefore call it the “Fast-Hessian” 
detector. The descriptor, on the other hand, describes a 
distribution of Haar-wavelet responses within the interest 
point neighborhood.  In the first stage, integral images allow 
the fast computation of approximate Laplacian of Gaussian 
images using a box filter. The computational cost of 
applying the box filter is independent of the size of the filter 
because of the integral image representation. The 
determinants of the Hessian matrix are then used to detect 
the key points, because of its good performance in 
computation time and accuracy. It relies on the determinant 
of the Hessian for both location and the scale. Given a point 
p=(x,y) in an image I(x,y), the Hessian matrix section H(x,) 
in p at scale  is defined as follows

where Lxx(p,), Lxy(p,), Lyx(p,), Lyy(p,) are the 
convolution of the Gaussian second order derivative with 
respect to x and y, respectively, with the image I(x,y) in the 
point p [19].  The SURF builds its scale space by keeping 
the same image size while varying only the filter size. In the 
final stage, to each detected key point is firstly assigned a 
reproducible orientation. For orientation, the Haar wavelet 
responses in x and y directions are calculated for a set of 
pixels within a radius of 6 where  refers to the detected 
key point scale. The SURF descriptor is then computed by 
constructing a square window centered on the key point and 
oriented along the orientation obtained before. This window 
is divided into 4 x 4 regular sub-regions and Haar wavelets 
of size 2 are calculated within each sub-region.  Each sub-
region contributes 4 values thus resulting in 64D descriptor 
vectors which are then normalized to unit length. The 
resulting SURF descriptor is invariant to rotation, scale and 
contrast; besides that it is also partially invariant to some 
other transformations [19]. 
E. MSER Detector 
 
The Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER), 
proposed by Matas et al. [20], estimates a set of 
distinguished regions that are detected in a gray scale image 
and defined by an extremal property of the intensity function 
4

in the region and on its outer boundary. The MSER has 
properties that allow it to achieve a superior performance as 
stable local detector compared with other local point 
detectors.  Two of the main properties of the set of MSER 
are that it is closed under continuous geometric 
transformations and invariant to affine intensity changes.  
Furthermore the MSER regions are detected at different 
scales. Some other important properties of the MSER 
detector are: 
a) Invariance to affine transformation of image intensities.  
b) Covariance 
to 
adjacency 
preserving 
(continuous) 
transformation T: D on the image matched point domain. 
c) Stability of the detected regions which means that only 
the regions whose support is nearly the same over a 
range of thresholds is selected.  
d) Multi-scale detection without any smoothing involved, 
thus both fine and large structure is detected.   
The set of all extremal regions that can be enumerated in 
worst-case is of O(n), where n is the number of pixels in the 
image.

EVALUATION RESULTS 
 
To evaluate the proposed images authentication system, 
the CASIA Image Tampering Detection Evaluation 
Database [21] was used, which consists of 102 Images. To 
obtain a correct operation, the parameters of proposed 
system are set as follows: The threshold value used to 
determine if two blocks in each transformation domain are 
similar using the cross correlation among them is the mean 
value of the highest correlation among the 16 blocks.  For 
the Radon Transform the projection of the image intensity 
along the 180 angles equally spaced in the interval  
0  
 are analyzed. For the SURF detector the number 
of octaves is set equal to 3, which will give a filter size of 
27x27.  Finally for the MSER detector the step size between 
intensity threshold levels is set equal to 0.8.  
 
Table I shows the detection performance of proposed 
system when it is required to evaluate both tampered and 
original images, where a false positive is an error in which 
the test result indicates that an image is tampered when it is 
an original one, while a false negative is an error produced 
when the test result indicates that the image is original, 
although it is in fact tampered.  
 
 
 
Figure 5. Performance of proposed   scheme (a) Original image, (b) 
tampered image and c) matched points. 
 
Figures 4 and 5 show the evaluation results in which the 
proposed scheme correctly detects a tampered image.  In 
both cases the original and tampered images are shown in 
(a) and (d), while in (c) the matched points obtained by the 
SURF and MSER are shown which confirm that the image 
under analysis was tampered is shown in (c).  In some cases, 
depending on the alteration introduced on the original 
image, for example if the pasted object suffer some affine 
transformation, the SURF features are not robust enough to 
detect these changes, so in this case to use the MSER 
features may allow to detect that the image under analysis 
was tampered, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7.   Finally Table II 
shows the evaluation results obtained using the Mean 
Opinion Scoring (MOS) criterion in which several images 
were presented to 100 peoples who were asked to determine 
if the images were tampered or untampered.  
 
The total time of calculation evaluating the three 
transformation techniques and the SURF and MSER 
detector is of 3.53 minutes.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
This paper proposes a copy-move tamper detection 
algorithm in which firstly the image under analysis is 
divided in 16 blocks and the 2D-DCT, 2D-FFT and DRT of 
each block is estimated.  Then, the similitude between such 
blocks, in each domain, is estimated using the maximum of 
the cross correlation value together with the SURF detector 
and MSER features to determine if the image was tampered. 
From the evaluation results presented in this paper we can 
observe that the proposed scheme is able to identify the 
copy-move regions of the image under analysis. We must 
add that this method is not trying to identify any particular 
type of copy-move forgery mechanism, like rotation, or 
scaling, or JPEG compression. Instead it is intended to be a 
more general method able to operate in almost any situation 
and that, combined with other methods can lead to an 
accurate detection of a specific type forgery attack.
