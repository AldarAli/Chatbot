 INTRODUCTION  
Not only the huge success of mobile technology and 
growing popularity of IP-based multimedia services are 
motivating the development of Next Generation Networks 
(NGN), but also saving costs, open for more address space 
and lowering threshold for more actors. NGN is described 
as the convergence of public switched telephone network, 
the wireless networks and the data networks. 
The combination of cellular networks and wireless 
networks meets the need for wide range and high data rate. 
In effect, this provides better service to users. To approach 
such a combination this paper proposes a next generation 
scheme for seamless interworking between WLAN [1], 
WiMax [2] and UMTS/LTE [3] networks hereby called 
WLAN-WiMax-UMTS/LTE Interworking Architecture. 
This paper is a continuation to [4] which proceeds with 
proposing a framework to provide service mobility 
following the NGN architecture and uses the IEEE 802.21 
MIH services to exchange information by introducing a 
control plane with MIH information severs to guarantee 
connectivity while using best network selection (see 
Figure 1). This paper proposes how to integrate wireless 
access networks in the access plane of the proposed 
framework. 
The paper is structured as follows. Section II 
summarizes the types of integration and pros and cons of 
those types of integration. Section III proposes the next 
generation 
WLAN-WiMax-UMTS/LTE 
Interworking 
Architecture. Section IV describes Heartbeat Messages 
and Section V discusses how QoS parameters are 
measured in the proposed scheme. Section VI gives 
analytical evaluation of the heartbeat mechanism. In the 
last section, the paper is concluded.

TYPES OF ACCESS NETWORKS INTEGRATION 
Two approaches for integration of wireless (e.g., 
WLAN) and cellular (e.g., UMTS) networks have been 
defined by ETSI – loose coupling and tight coupling. In 
loose coupling (Figure 2), wireless and cellular networks 
are not directly connected. They do not share a common 
protocol stack. Hence, this results in fairly long handover 
latency and potential packet loss.

One advantage is that it allows independent 
deployment and traffic engineering of WLAN and UMTS. 
Roaming agreements with partners can allow widespread 
service enabling subscribers to use a single service 
provider for all network access. Another advantage is that 
it allows a WISP (wireless internet service provider) to

provide its own public WLAN hotspot, interoperate 
through roaming agreements with public WLAN and 
UMTS service providers or manage a privately installed 
enterprise 
WLAN. 
Loose 
coupling 
is 
commonly 
implemented by use of Mobile IP. 
 
 
 
Figure 3: Tight Coupling WLAN-UMTS Interworking 
 
In tight coupling, a wireless network is connected to 
cellular network just like any other radio access network 
(see Figure 3). Wireless network emulates the functions 
similar to GPRS functions [7]. Advantages of tight 
coupling include seamless handover across WLAN and 
UMTS, reuse of AAA, reuse of infrastructures, increased 
security, common provisioning and customer care and 
access to core UMTS services like SMS, MMS and 
location based services. One disadvantage is that tight 
coupling needs to be tailored for WLANs owned by 
cellular operators and does not easily support third party 
WLANs. The same operator must manage both WLAN 
and UMTS parts since the core network interfaces are 
exposed. Another disadvantage is that tight coupling does 
not straight forwardly support legacy WLAN terminals 
that do not implement the UMTS protocols. Cost and 
capacity of the SGSN associated with the connection of 
WLAN may also be a disadvantage. While throughput 
capacity of traditional SGSNs is sufficient to support 
thousands of low-bit-rate GPRS terminals, it may not be 
sufficient to support hundreds of high-bit-rate WLAN 
terminals.  Thus SGSN could become a bottleneck for high 
data rate applications. 
The integration architectures, as explained in [5], differ 
for each of the interworking options, as shown in Figure 4.  
 
 
Figure 4: Interworking points with the relevant architecture 
names (based on [5]) 
 
WLAN can be integrated with UMTS at PS core. 
Depending on which point it is attached to – it is loose, 
tight, very tight or open architecture. 
Note that in this section, WLAN and UMTS are used 
as examples of wireless and mobile systems. The 
description can be made more general including systems 
such as WiMax, LTE and others. 
III. 
NEXT GENERATION PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE  
The design of an architecture that efficiently integrates 
WLAN, WiMax and UMTS/LTE is a rewarding task. In 
the following a scheme for integration of cellular and 
wireless networks is described. The case of WLAN, 
WiMax and UMTS is chosen for illustration as shown in 
Figure 5. 
 
 
 
Figure 5: Proposed Integration of Access Networks 
 
A. 
Architecture 
We assume that neighboring WLAN Access Point 
(AP) and UMTS Base Station (BS)/ Radio Network 
Controller (RNC) and WiMax BS are connected via a 
backbone network. The APs and nodes are capable of 
verifying the identity of neighbor APs and nodes. The User 
Equipment (UE) has multi radio interfaces and protocol 
stacks for WLAN, WiMax and UMTS. Note that different 
classes of UEs can be present, some able to make use of 
multiple radios while others are not. 
The 
significant 
characteristic 
of 
the 
proposed 
architecture is that the UE needs not have all the interfaces 
on all the time. The list of all available networks can be 
retrieved from any one of the interfaces – WLAN, WiMax 
or UMTS using the IEEE 802.21 MIH Information Service 
Request. 
AP, BS and RNC are connected, i.e., they can identify 
each other and can share information with each other, 
either directly or via a mediator. They share information 
with each other by way of periodic heartbeat messages 
using IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) 
Information Service Messages. A UE initiating a session 
can get relevant network and QoS information depending 
on type of service.  The network selection can then be 
either made by UE or by network node (including AP/ BS/ 
RNC) to provide seamless handover and service 
continuity.

B. 
WLAN-UMTS interworking 
One motivation for WLAN-UMTS interworking is to 
extend UMTS services and functionality to WLAN access 
environment [11]. Additional capacity and higher data rates 
for end users on WLAN and operation of WLAN on 
unlicensed frequency band makes it all the more suitable for 
WLAN-UMTS interworking. Figure 6 summarizes the 
UMTS-WLAN interworking characteristics [12].  
 
 
Figure 6: WLAN–UMTS Interworking (adapted from [12]) 
 
We propose a scheme where AP and RNC (Radio 
Network Controller) forward packets to each other 
intelligently. WLAN and UMTS are indirectly connected 
through an IP-based network which means a loosely 
coupling architecture. Mobile IP can be used to roam 
between WLAN and UMTS networks. An enhancement of 
the 
existing 
architecture 
is 
the 
introduction 
of 
communication mechanism between APs and RNCs/network 
nodes using IEEE 802.21 MIH with heartbeat messages as 
explained in Section IV. One option is to allow APs and 
network nodes to obtain information via multi-radio 
interfaces. Another option is to allow UEs reporting on the 
conditions observed. In the former case, AP and network 
nodes periodically broadcast heartbeat messages to all 
neighboring nodes including other radio interfaces using 
IEEE 802.21 MIH messages.   
On receiving the heartbeat messages, AP and network 
nodes update the network map information. This way, all 
relevant nodes know the existence of other access networks 
including the relevant network attributes. This information is 
later used for making optimum network selection before 
handover. 
 
C. 
WLAN-WiMax interworking 
WLAN offers high data rates within a 100 m range 
whereas WiMax offers lower data rates in an 8 km range [6]. 
Instead of selecting one network to provide access to 
network services, interworking both networks can use each 
network’s advantages. Service providers can provide 
bundled services to users in either access network thereby 
using both licensed and license-exempt frequency bands. In 
this way, service providers can sell attractive devices 
supporting WiMax and WLAN capabilities taking advantage 
of device cost savings [8]. 
In the proposed architecture, WLAN and WiMax are 
integrated at the IP layer following the NGN concept [7]. In 
the proposed integration, a WiMax BS or WLAN AP 
periodically broadcasts heartbeat messages giving neighbor 
network information to relevant nodes. Any AP or BS in the 
vicinity will receive these messages. It is assumed that AP 
and BS will stay on and listen on those interfaces. In effect, 
AP and BS neighbors can assist when selecting the best 
available network. This may reduce target network detection 
time. The heartbeat messages follow the format of IEEE 
802.21 MIH messages. The heartbeat message format is 
given in Chapter IV. 
The difference between this proposal and those given in 
[8][10] is that the target network detection time is reduced. 
The IEEE 802.21 MIH Information Service heartbeat 
messages minimize the target network detection time. Since 
a current network admission controller (e.g., residing in 
AP/BS) is aware of the target network (post handoff), the 
handover latency is reduced. 
D. 
WiMax - UMTS interworking 
WiMax – UMTS may be partially overlapping as 
opposed to fully overlapping commonly seen for UMTS – 
WLAN (see Figure 7), [14]. In the latter case, the UE may 
maintain the Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context of UMTS 
while simultaneously being connected to WLAN. Hence, 
when the UE leaves the WLAN spot, it can reconnect 
immediately to UMTS without reactivating PDP context. 
However, since WiMax coverage may be partially 
overlapping UMTS, the handover needs to be fast enough to 
maintain service continuity. 
 
Figure 7: WLAN-UMTS Vs WiMax-UMTS 
 
To achieve this, Mobile IP can be used as common 
interconnection protocol. The WiMax BS and UMTS node 
must then interwork. The WiMax Access Network (ASN) 
provides the WiMax access services for the UE. WiMax 
Home Agent (HA) manages the mobility inside WiMax 
network. The WiMax HA is not included in UMTS core 
network to keep its independence (loose/open coupling). The 
Foreign Agents (FAs) located in ASN Gateway are 
considered as the local FAs in the interworking architecture.

the mobility and FA functions in UMTS network. The major 
advantage of this proposal over the proposal in [14] is the 
seamless handover and low packet loss. It is achieved 
through IEEE 802.21 MIH based heartbeat messages. This 
method guarantees both the independence of between 
networks, and low handover latency. 
IV. 
HEARTBEAT MESSAGES 
IEEE 802.21 MIH messages make the heart beat message 
uniform across different access networks. The timing of 
these messages will also be independent. The message 
format is as shown in Figure 9. This is in TLV format as 
required by IEEE 802.21 Variable Payload. Network 
attributes are periodically distributed to every relevant node. 
Each of the nodes listens on for heartbeat messages from 
other nodes. They form a network map based on the 
information received through heartbeat messages. On 
receiving the heartbeat message, they update their network 
map information periodically. UE can either retrieve the 
network list from any of them or can issue an MIH 
Information Service Request for Network Map Information 
on all its radio interfaces. As shown in Figure 8, the node 
multicasts its network information using IEEE 802.21 MIH 
messages on relevant interfaces. Being a periodic message, 
the AP will send the heartbeat message every n time units. 
So a timer is used to count for this purpose. Meanwhile, AP 
also listens on relevant interfaces for heartbeats from other 
nodes. On receiving an IEEE 802.21 MIH packet on any 
interface, AP checks what type of packet it is. If it is a 
heartbeat message, AP will update the network map 
information and marks the entry alive. If it is a network 
request message from a UE, AP sends the network map 
information to the UE. If the timer expires it goes through 
the network list and checks whether the network is still 
active. If the network is not active, that entry is deleted from 
the network map. This way all the entries in the network map

are checked. Responses are shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10 
which is in TLV format as required by IEEE 802.21 Variable 
Payload. This communication mechanism enables faster 
handovers by referring to the available network map 
information. 
 
V. 
QOS NETWORK PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS 
ITU recommendation for the service classes and QoS 
parameters mapping for various access technologies are 
given in [4]. QoS parameters are collected by every network. 
These include parameters like delay, throughput, packet error 
ratio, average packet transfer delay and jitter. For example, 
transfer delay is measured by measuring the time required by 
a packet to travel from ingress to egress of a node (e.g., 
AP/BS). The IN timestamp and OUT timestamps are stored 
and their difference gives the packet delay.Average packet 
delay is calculated as accumulated packet delay divided by 
number of packets transmitted successfully. 
Similarly, packet error ratio is given by the number of 
failed transmissions over total transmissions. Throughput is 
the maximum sustained traffic rate for WiMax, Maximum 
Bit rate and Peak rate for UMTS/LTE and Peak Data Rate 
for WLAN. This is kept track of by relevant network nodes.  
Using the standard formulas for M/M/k/m queue model, [4], 
delay and throughput parameters can be calculated by the 
individual 
network 
nodes. 
Similarly, 
call 
blocking 
probability can be calculated using analytical model 
proposed in [15] in terms of number of virtual channels (N), 
user arrival rate (λ), arrival rate of type1 call (λ1), arrival rate 
of type2 call (λ2) arrival rate of type3 call (λ3) and service 
time of the user (μ)]. 
Handoff Call dropping probability may be calculated as 
given in [16] [17].

Note: if we set g = 0, the above expressions reduces to 
the classical Erlang-B loss formula [17]. Where Pd - Call 
dropping probability, g – number of channels reserved for 
handoff calls, n – Number of idle channels and A – Call 
arrival rate / (call completion rate + handoff departure rate). 
The QoS network performance measurement parameters 
(Delay, Throughput, Call Blocking probability and Handoff 
Dropping probability) are piggybacked to heartbeat 
messages as shown in Figure 11. 
 
 
 
Figure 11: QoS Params 
 
The QoS Network Performance Measurement parameters 
can then be used to rank the access networks and finally 
select the best available network. A network ranking 
algorithm will require the QoS parameters to make optimum 
decision suiting the network requirements of UE. For 
example, if UE is connected to WiMax and is moving 
another network may become available, such as UMTS and 
WLAN. Say, if call dropping probability of UMTS is higher 
than for WLAN, and the ranking algorithm should place 
higher desirability to WLAN and rank it better than UMTS. 
These parameters are the key factors that decide the 
desirability of a network when making a network selection 
decision. 
 
VI. 
ANALYTICAL EVALUATION 
In this section, we analyze the costs involved to find 
whether the proposed system is better than existing loose 
coupled architecture. Consider a UE is connected to one of 
the access networks – WLAN, WiMax or UMTS. Say there 
are x networks available to UE. The UE sends x requests to 
find available networks to perform a handover and receives x 
responses about available networks (if all are still available). 
So, for detecting the target networks in conventional 
loose coupling architecture, the UE will have to exchange at 
least 2x packets to find characteristics about x access 
networks. This is best case scenario. The ACK packets and 
retransmissions due to error are not even considered here. 
Handoff Latency (LH) can be expressed in terms of 
detection delay (LD), handoff request delay (LHR) and 
handoff response (LHS) delay. 
 
LH = LD + LHR + LHS 
 
The proposed architecture aims at minimizing the 
detection delay thereby reducing the handoff latency. [18] 
Shows, by simulation, that detection delay is a significant 
component of Handoff latency.  The data rates differ, 
however, for WLAN, WiMax and UMTS. Together with the 
different network solutions implies that responses will arrive 
at the UE at different times and reflect different time 
intervals. Some examples of data rates are given in Table I.

In the proposed architecture, UE sends MIH Network 
Request Message and receives the network Map information 
through the IEEE 802.21 MIH Network Map Message. So, 
in all 2 packets are exchanged to get the list of available 
networks.  Let Dwlan –Time to transfer a packet on WLAN, 
Dwimax – Time to transfer a packet on WiMax and Dumts– 
Time to transfer a packet on UMTS. In Loose coupling 
architectures given in [8][10], [14]; Time to detect x 
networks when UE is connected to (serial request - response) 
WLAN= 2 * x * Dwlan. Time to detect x networks when UE 
is connected to WiMax = 2 * x * Dwimax. Time to detect x 
networks when UE is connected to UMTS= 2 * x * Dumts.

For the architecture described in this paper, time to detect 
x networks when UE is connected to WLAN = 2 * Dwlan, 
time to detect x networks when UE is connected to WiMax = 
2 * Dwimax and time to detect x networks when UE is 
connected to UMTS= 2 * Dumts. So, to detect available 
networks on each of the access networks, the cost involved 
in terms of time units is summarized in Table II.

As shown in Table II, the detection delay LD is only a 
multiple of the packet transfer delay in each of the access 
networks. However, for other architectures, LD is a multiple 
of both the number of access networks (serial detection) as 
well as the packet transfer delay. With increase in the 
number of networks available, the detection delay will also 
increase. The numbers of messages are also increasing 
correspondingly. For serial detection, the delay will be equal 
to the one proposed in this paper only when x = 1. That is, 
only when one network is available. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have proposed a next generation 
WLAN-WiMax-UMTS interworking architecture. This is 
based on NGN architecture (which follows 3GPP standards) 
and proposes a novel heartbeat mechanism using IEEE 
802.21 MIH Information Service. The architecture promises 
a low target network detection time during the switching of 
the communication. The mobility between two access 
networks is achieved by the Mobile IP at the network layer.  
The QoS Network Performance Measurement Parameters 
are piggybacked to heartbeat messages and shared with other 
access networks. We have shown how proposed architecture 
can minimize detection delay, and ultimately reduce the 
handover latency. Our future work will focus on handover 
algorithms and ranking algorithm for access networks based 
on the proposed architecture and their performance 
evaluation through simulation.
