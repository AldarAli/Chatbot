Abstract— Textile industry includes a large number of 
practices and complex technical issues that operate in a 
competitive global industry. Recently, researchers have shown 
an increased interest in textile design software solution for all 
designing and coloring needs. However, for massive production 
textile designers are facing several problems related to Color 
Matching, Design Export, and Customize pantone coloring. 
Thus, textile designers need to take into account not only the 
design but also manufacture and technological development 
and the application of the final product. In order to enhance 
textile designers’ with an optimization tools, this paper 
presents the design, implementation, and evaluation details of 
WeaveStudio Toolkit for textile pattern coloring and 
visualization. A combination of quantitative and qualitative 
approaches was used in the data analysis. Therefore, this study 
makes a major contribution to research on textile pattern 
coloring and visualization by demonstrating a valuable toolkit 
on the textile design suiTable for design professionals in the 
textile and fashion industries, as well as in academia.

I. 
TEXTILE DESIGN 
Textile designing is a creative field that is important for a 
wide range of scientific and industrial processes. Textile 
designing is a major area of interest within the field of 
fashion design, carpet manufacturing and any other cloth-
related field [1]. This industry includes a variety of purposes, 
e.g., clothing, carpets, drapes, towels, and rugs are all a 
products of textile design [2]. It is now well established from 
a variety of studies, that, textile industry is now one of the 
most influential sectors, in the global economy, garment 
industrialization has become the world’s third biggest 
industrial industry [3][4]. 
Textile designers should have the ability to inspire 
collections, trends, and styles of fashion [5]. In this regard, 
different textile design software’s have been developed in 
order to making the garment industrialization more 
productive. Most of these textile applications share some 
combinations of functions such as, setup any number of style 
templates. The design output can be linked to specific style 
components, such as fabrics or size specs as well as 
designers specified number of solutions to be saved [6]. 
Despite its long experiments success, the textile software 
has a number of problems in use. Customize pantone 
coloring is one of the most frequently stated problems with 
the current versions of textile applications, that limits the 
amount of designs and hinders designers creativity growth. 
Moreover, there is increasing concern that some textiles 
applications are being disadvantaged with color matching. 
Therefore, these major issues have been shown to be related 
to adverse effects the massive design export [7]. In addition, 
that lack of textile software usability has been highlighted in 
several studies [8]. 
There is an urgent need to address these issues in order to 
make the garment industrialization more productive. This 
paper 
addresses 
these 
issues 
and 
presents 
design, 
implementation, and evaluation details of WeaveStudio 
toolkit for textile pattern coloring and visualization. The 
specific objective of WeaveStudio is to shift away from 
traditional textiles software where designers are limited to 
customize pantone coloring towards a more dynamic and 
productive one. In fact, WeaveStudio is built on a vision to 
rethink of textile production and make it more accessible and 
enabled designers to create their own unique brand line. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2 begins by laying out the theoretical dimensions of 
the research, and looks at how field of textiles computer-
aided design software is still relatively new and extending 
due to technology miniaturization. The third Section is 
concerned with the methodology used for this study 
including the WeaveStudio design and requirements. Section 
4 analyses the results of interviews and focus group 
discussions undertaken during the implementations of 
WeaveStudio toolkit. Finally, we summarize our findings 
and outline perspectives for future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
The textile design process often begins with different art 
mediums to match concepts for the finished product design. 
Nowadays, most professional textile designers are using 
some kinds of design software created expressly for this 
purpose [9]. The field of textiles computer-aided design 
software is still relatively new and extending due to 
technology miniaturization [10]. We selected the following 
ten textile design application for our analysis due to their 
particular focus on the textile pattern design and color 
matching.

 Completely supported         () Partly        - Not supported 
 
It can be seen from the data in Table 1 that, these 
textile applications are support the basic features of 
textile design, namely CAD Tools , Color Matching , 
Presentation Tools, Textile Pattern Design. However, 
only Pointcarre, Vetigraph, DesignSew Diva, and 
Evolution Textile Design by DigiFab Systems are 
providing more advanced features, such as user friendly 
and 
usable 
interface. 
This 
analysis 
has 
been 
demonstrated that the lack of Customize pantone 
coloring is a major cahalenge of texttile applications 
that,  makes their usage unpractical and out of context.

WEAVESTUDIO DESIGN 
Driven by the wish to enhance textile software with a 
complete package solution for all designing and coloring 
needs, we follow spiral model as a combination of both, 
iterative model, which mixed some key aspect of the 
waterfall model and rapid prototyping models, in an attempt 
to combine wide range advantages of top-down and bottom-
up concepts. [23].  We analyzed the existing textile software 
to identifying which functionalities they have in common,

which functionalities were most frequently used, and what 
are the additional functionalities that are still required as 
presented in the related work Section 2. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Spiral model [23] 
A. Survey Results 
Based on the literature review and the analysis of the 
existing systems, we collected design requirements regarding 
the main textile grading and electronic prototyping to the 
product design, ensuring better finish, fit and accuracy. Then, 
we designed a survey to collect feedback from different 
textile stakeholders concerning the importance of the 
collected requirements. The demographic profile of this 
survey was distinguished into academic professors and 
textile industrial designers as follows: 
 
Academic Professors: 23 professors who had 
experiences in the field of textile completed this 
survey. 37% from Europe, 42% from the US and 
21% from Asia. 
 
Textile Industrial Designers: 42 textile industrial 
designers who had worked in the field of textile 
completed this survey. 55% from Europe, 34% from 
the US and 11% from Asia. 
A summary of the survey analysis results are presented in 
Table 2. It strengthens the collected requirement to support 
WeaveStudio Design in order to enhance designers with an 
object-oriented toolkit that enable them to spend as little time 
as possible for entering data. From styles and trims to design 
sizing, sewing operations and style prototype, moreover, 
designers can create templates or groups of objects that can 
be instantly retrieved and editable if appropriate.

discuss the main components of the WeaveStudio user 
interface in some detail. 
IV. 
WEAVESTUDIO COMPONENTS 
There are several different types of layouts for repeated 
patterns. WeaveStudio provides a flexible workflow of 
product specifications modeled after the actual design. 
A. WeaveStudio Workflow 
 WeaveStudio uses a common color palette to relate 
every aspect of style specification including graphics and 
textual information as shown in Figure 2. Some of the most 
common repeats are straight and half drop. Often, the same 
design is produced in many different colored versions, which 
are called live models as illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 3.  WeaveStudio live models. 
B. Customize pantone coloring 
Customize pantone coloring is the other method to make 
your textile unique. In WeaveStudio Customize pantone 
coloring as an expression of textile design power provide 
designers with a usable tool of color in constructing identity, 
the creation of color via contemporary technical advances, 
alongside the classification and codification of color as 
presented in Figure 4.  
Therefore, customize pantone coloring a powerful design 
studio at fingertips that allows textile designers to: 
 
Modifying designs with advanced color management 
 
Using a variety of color modes. 
 
Including knits and weaves, as you create a choice of 
textiles and colorways. 
 
Printing digital textile design.  
 
Creating multiple colorways and palettes.  
 
Designing, creating and manipulating the textile 
prototypes.  
 
Repeats, drops, engraving sizes 
 
Work with different file formats. 
 
Allows the view of one repeat, many repeats, and 
real image size. 
 
Efficiently and quickly design custom fabrics and 
results appear immediately. 
 
Export multiple designs at once.  
 
Its user friendly workflow enables to make the 
textile design faster and error free. 
From the icons in Figure 4, designers can create new 
textile designs in a matter of hours rather than days or weeks.

A. Usability Evaluation (ISONORM 9241/110-S) 
The 
ISONORM 
9241/110-S 
questionnaire 
was 
designed based upon the International Standard ISO 9241, 
Part 110 [21]. Recently, researchers have shown an 
increased interest in using this questioner for testing the 
user-friendly and usability [22]. Thus, we used this 
questionnaire as a general usability evaluation for the 
WeaveStudio toolkit.  ISONORM questionnaire consists 
of 21 questions distributed into seven main Sections. 
Participants were asked to respond to each question 
scaling from (7) a positive exclamation and its mirroring 
negative counterpart (1) and it’s used. The questionnaire 
comes with an evaluation framework that computes 
several aspects of usability to a single score between 21 
and 147. A total of 34 questionnaires were completed. 
Table 3 illustrates the summary of the ISONORM 
9241/110-S usability evaluation. 
The majority of respondents were in the 23-42 age 
range. Male respondents formed the majority (90%). 
Participants have a high level of educational attainment: 
66% of participants are studying bachelor's degree in 
Textile Technology and Design and 34% are worked in 
textile production.

The collect feedback from ISONORM 9241/110-S 
questioner reflect higher level of satisfaction; the total 
score was 103, which translates to “Everything is all right. 
Currently, there is no reason to make changes to the 
software in regards to usability”[ 21]. In particular, the 
handling of the WeaveStudio interface was considered by 
most of the designers to be easy and the majority reported 
that they did not have difficulties when going through the 
required textile design tasks (i.e. design coloring). The 
general design of the interface was perceived to be 
pleasant and interactive (i.e. every thing in one screen). 
Most designers also agreed that the used terminology and 
icons (e.g., Customize pantone coloring; create color way) 
were clear and self-describing. In general, the ISONORM 
9241/110-S evaluation results reflect a user satisfaction 
with the usability of the WeaveStudio toolkit. 
B. Effectivness Evaluation 
In this Section, we will focus on the perceived quality 
and usefulness on the best practices of WeaveStudio. We 
will analyze the results per question basis for all textile 
design tasks. A summary of the average scores per 
question are given in Figures 5-10. Likert items are used to 
measure respondents' attitudes to a particular question. 
The first question investigates if the proposed objective 
of WeaveStudio to make any suggestions for the client 
designs ideas. As shown in Figure 5, 64% of responders 
are strongly agree with that WeaveStudio helps them 
accurately interpreting and representing clients' designs 
ideas.   
 
 
Figure 5.  Representing clients' designs ideas 
Further, we have observed that, applying color 
management on textile printing substrates. As can be seen 
from Figure 6, the overall response to the evaluation item 
is over 70% strongly agree with that WeaveStudio helps 
designers in understanding of color matching and color 
management issues for digital textile printing. This 
indicates that WeaveStudio toolkit is a powerful method 
for color management software in the field of digital 
printing onto a textile substrate.

Moreover, participants in this survey are noted that, 
aggregate all the design elements in one screen (See Figure 
4) is the best feature in WeaveStudio. Furthermore, 
following, we elaborate the ability of the WeaveStudio to 
produce novel and attractive in designing the structure and 
properties of nonwoven fabrics for different purposes. 
 
It can be seen from the data in Figure 7, the majority 
are agreed that WeaveStudio enable them to create 
beautiful repeating patterns using different color patterns 
and make it possible to create a novel textile design for 
different perspectives.

Figure 10.  Supporting CAD / CAM systems 
Computer-aided design (CAD) has brought a new 
revolution in the textile industry. In our context 
WeaveStudio helps textile designers to visualize and see 
their imaginative design in final layout without producing 
any cloths sample. The themes identified in these 
responses are summarized in Figure 10. 
Finally, we asked designers whether WeaveStudio 
helps them to export and share design production-ready 
assets with textile developers. In Figure 11 there is a clear 
trend of agreeing that, WeaveStudio supports textile 
design artboards and helps them to export them 
individually to files.

CONCLUSION 
Textile designing is a creative field that is important 
for a wide range of scientific and industrial processes. This 
study was undertaken to design, implement and evaluate 
the WeaveStudio toolkit as a textile designing solution for 
pattern coloring and visualization. WeaveStudio includes a 
dynamic interface of linked design data, supported by an 
integrated object-oriented technology. A combination of 
quantitative and qualitative approaches was used in the 
data analysis. The preliminary evaluation results revealed 
a user acceptance of WeaveStudio toolkit as a helpful, 
easy to use, and useful textile design tool that has the
