Abstract—Mineral/melt partition coefﬁcients describe the re-
distribution of trace elements during melting processes. They
are highly inﬂuenced by changing pressure, temperature, and
composition. We ﬁnd that for sodium, partition coefﬁcients rise
in the order of two magnitudes from 0-15 GPa along the
peridotite solidus temperature. Still, because of lacking high-
pressure experimental data and the limited pressure range of
most partitioning models, mantle and crust evolution models
normally rely on constant partition coefﬁcients. This is especially
unfavorable for models which want to explore the thermal
evolution of a terrestrial planet by tracing the heat producing ele-
ments. Based on a thermodynamic model, we parametrise sodium
partitioning equations which are applicable from 0-12 GPa and
1410-2350 K. With the help of the sodium partitioning model,
we calculate clinopyroxene/melt partition coefﬁcients for the
heat producing element potassium. Knowing both, the sodium
and potassium partitioning behaviour, will help us to improve
elemental redistribution calculations and therefore also thermal
evolution models.

I. INTRODUCTION
Inside the Earth and other terrestrial planets, partial melts
usually control the redistribution of trace elements from the
mantle to the crust. If melt is buoyant due to a lower density
than the surrounding rock, it moves upwards and transports the
previously incorporated incompatible trace elements towards
the surface. This leads to enriched reservoirs near the sur-
face and depleted upper mantle areas. Using thermodynamic
models, the incorporation of an incompatible element can
be predicted as has been outlined in [1] based on sodium
as a reference for other trace elements. Expanding the re-
distribution concept to a larger number of elements (as is
shown here exemplarily for the 1+ charge element potassium)
leads to the creation of trace element patterns, which are
unique geochemical markers of the events that led to the exact
appearance and compositions of a rock of interest [2][3][4].
During melting, partition coefﬁcients describe if an element
prefers to be incorporated into a mineral or, if it is incompat-
ible, into melt. Partitioning data for peridotite including the
minerals olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene show that
in mantle rocks, clinopyroxene is the mineral taking in most
incompatible trace elements [5][6]. This makes clinopyroxene
the mineral with the largest inﬂuence on trace element redis-
tribution.
Since partition coefﬁcients of sodium between clinopyrox-
ene and silicate melt are highly affected by changing pressure
and temperature, partition coefﬁcient models should consider
these parameters. Because of analytical limitations, there are
only few measured partition coefﬁcients available for high-
pressure conditions. Additionally, partition coefﬁcient models
are often only applicable for rather low pressures. This is the
reason why so far, partial melt simulations in some mantle
evolution models either neglected partition coefﬁcients and
chose pre-deﬁned elemental abundances in mantle melts [7],
or settled for constant experimentally derived and estimated
partition coefﬁcients [8][9][10][11].
In 1937, Goldschmidt postulated that both the matching size
and charge of the mineral’s lattice site and element of interest
determine an element’s ability to partition into a mineral [12].
This leads to the assumption that not only it is possible to de-
termine the P-T sensitive partition coefﬁcients experimentally,
but also by means of numerical modelling. Based on a model
of Brice (1975) [13], Blundy et al. (1995) [14] developed a
quantitative model and determined a parametrised ﬁt function
for clinopyroxene/melt partition coefﬁcients for sodium in the
range of 0-4 GPa and 1000-1800◦C. In Schmidt and Noack
(2021) [1], this temperature and pressure range was already
extended to higher pressure conditions, leading to a general
parametrisation over a broad temperature range and pressures
from 4-12 GPa. Here, we derive new parametrisations from
surface to upper mantle conditions focusing on speciﬁc melt
partitioning scenarios related to both formation and freezing
of melt.
As is shown in Figure 1, partition coefﬁcients of trace
elements have a parabolic relationship in an Onuma diagram.
The parabolas’ curves change in broadness and shift along the
x-axis depending on the bulk modulus E and the ideal lattice
site radius r0, respectively. Because of this relationship, it is

possible to calculate other trace elements’ partition coefﬁcients
based on the reference coefﬁcient DNa.
The aim of this study is to implement a thermodynamic
model for Dcpx/melt
Na
for a large range of pressures suitable
for mantle melt simulations. Furthermore, we parametrise a
scaling law from the mentioned model that is applicable
for upper mantle pressures. This will open the possibility
to include partition coefﬁcients depending on pressure and
temperature into mantle evolution models and to acquire more
realistic model results [15].
After proving that both the thermodynamic models and
the scaling laws are applicable, we derive clinopyroxene/melt
partition coefﬁcients for potassium from them. As one of the
most abundant radiogenic elements, potassium is one of the
largest contributors of heat inside the Earth [16][17]. Being
able to calculate pressure and temperature dependent partition
coefﬁcients of potassium in clinopyroxene/melt provides us
therefore an opportunity to make thermal evolution and mantle
melting models more realistic.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II,
we describe the methods used for our parametrisation, the
thermodynamic model, and potassium partitioning in the ap-
propriate subsections. Section III is dedicated to the results
for the thermodynamic model, the parametrisations, and the
application to potassium partitioning respectively. Section IV
discusses the results and compares them to experimental data.
Section V concludes the paper, summarizes the ﬁndings, and
points out what can be done in future works.
II. METHODS
A. Thermodynamic Model
To obtain the most realistic trace element partitioning re-
sults for mantle melting processes, it is useful to determine
a strain-compensated partition coefﬁcient D0 [18]. Strain-
compensation means that the redistributed element has the
same charge and size as the regular element on the lattice site
of the crystal [13]. Therefore, it is assumed that the radius
of the element of interest ri equals the lattice site radius r0.
This way the partition coefﬁcient Di can be calculated with
the following equation:
Di = D0 exp
−4πEM2NA( r0
2 (ri − r0)2 + 1
3(ri − r0)3)
RT

,
(1)
where EM2 is the bulk modulus of the M2 lattice site, NA the
Avogadro’s number, R the gas constant and T the temperature.
Here, the lattice site of interest is the crystallographic M2 site
of clinopyroxene. Sodium is used as the strain-compensated
partition coefﬁcient D0 because it is the 1+ charge element
that has a radius ri which is closest to the M2 lattice site
radius r0. Therefore, we assume D0 = DNa.
To calculate the strain-compensated partition coefﬁcient
D0, we took a thermodynamic approach described by Blundy
et al. (1995) [14]. For this, we used the melting curve of jadeite
and linked it to the activity of jadeite’s components in the
melt. To calculate the partition coefﬁcients of sodium between
Figure 1. Partition coefﬁcients of 1+ to 4+ charged cations in the clinopy-
roxene M2 lattice site. Modelled after Wood et al. (1997) [21]. Here, DNa
equals D0.
clinopyroxene and silicate melt, jadeite was the clinopyroxene
of choice because of both, its high concentration in sodium
and its ability to mix nearly ideally with diopside [19] and
enstatite.
Generally, partition coefﬁcients are given as the weight
fraction ratio
Di = Xcrystal
i
Xmelt

,
(2)
with Xi being the weight percentage of the given component.
However, since we obtain partition coefﬁcients with the help
of thermodynamic properties, we calculate molar partition
coefﬁcients. Based on experiments on plagioclase/ﬂuid parti-
tioning [20], it is broadly assumed that also for other minerals
molar partition coefﬁcients nearly equal weight percentage
coefﬁcients [21]. Thus, we can make use of Flood’s equation
for exchange equilibria in molten salts [22]:
RT lnKf =
X
Ni∆G0,
(3)
where Kf is the molar equilibrium constant, Ni the concen-
tration of the component and ∆G0 the Gibbs’ free energy of
change. Because we use a thermodynamic approach for our
calculations, Ni can be neglected and is set to one. The molar
partitioning of jadeite Djd can be expressed by using Kf in
the expression
Djd =

(4)
where ncpx
jd and nmelt are the mole of the solid clinopyroxene
and molten components, respectively. Here, we assume an
ideal case where the activity equals the mole fraction of the
elements of interest. Thus, we assume ncpx
jd
= Xcpx

Na . Taking (4) and rearranging (3) leads to the
following equation:

(5)
Besides (5), one more equation is needed to determine
DNa thermodynamically. Equation (6) relates the entropy of
the melting reaction to its heat capacity and melting point
Tf of jadeite at the pressure Pf=0.0001 GPa. By including
the enthalpy, we determine the Gibb’s free energy change of
reaction with the following equation:

where ∆H(f(Pf ,Tf ) is the entropy, ∆Sf(Pf ,Tf ) the enthalpy
and ∆Cp the difference between the local P,T values and
Pf,Tf. ∆Vf(T ) is the molar volume of fusion at pressure Pf
extrapolated to the temperature of interest [14]. We calculate
DNa by inserting (6) into (5).
To be able to solve (6), we use the Maier-Kelly power
function [23] to calculate the heat capacity Cp (as stated in
Table I). With the given parameters we can solve the ﬁrst two
integrals in (6) analytically, by evaluating the heat capacity of
the solid at temperature T and the melt heat capacity at Tf.
To solve the third part of the integral in (6) we use a Riemann
integral, where we approximate the intervals on subintervals
deﬁned over a pressure vector of n=1000 steps from P=0.0001
to 15 GPa and assume that the volumes of melt and solid are
constant in each subinterval.

For pressures from 0-15 GPa, the solidus temperatures range
from 1409-2297 K, while the liquidus temperatures go from
2035-2372 K. The pressure step size for each temperature
proﬁle is 0.1 GPa, which corresponds to 151 DNa-P-T data
points for each melt temperature proﬁle. With the least square
function, these data points were ﬁtted to a function with
parameters a, b, c, d, e, and f (14) in Python 3. Because the
function has the same form as the ﬁt function of Blundy
et al. (1995) [14], their ﬁt parameters are compared in Table II.

By including the melt fraction P-T proﬁles, we make
sure that the resulting model function will satisfy a broader
range of P-T conditions and is not only valid for modelling
partial melting in the mantle (where temperatures are close
to the solidus), but also for crystallisation of melt (where
temperatures are close to the liquidus). In contrast to our
model, partition coefﬁcients for crystallising liquid were often
determined by taking only the liquidus temperatures into
account [28][29][30].
Depending on the application (e.g magma ocean crystalli-
sation or partial melt models), it may be advantageous to con-
sider a narrower temperature/melt degree range, parametrised
with a higher accuracy. For these parametrisations, we again
used equations which calculate the respective temperatures
from pressures in the range of 0-15 GPa. The stepsize of the
pressure is again 0.1 GPa. For the parametrisation, we varied
the temperature by ±50 K along the melting curve to optimise
the accuracy if there are smaller temperature diversions from
the solidus (12) and liquidus (13) equations.
For both the thermodynamic model and the ﬁt function
development, replication data is accessible in the TRR170-DB
[31].
C. Application to Other Trace Elements
To

able
to
model
clinopyroxene/melt
partition
coefﬁcients for anhydrous melts on the basis of DNa,
we
mainly
based
our
calculations
on
previous
studies
[21][32]. In these calculations, the melt composition is added
to determine the bulk modulus E and lattice site radius r0.
The calculations are applicable to the M2 lattice site of
clinopyroxene and ions with a 1+ charge. In the literature
model [21], the method iterates the temperature over a
ﬁxed pressure until the clinopyroxene saturation in the melt
is reached. For our model, however, we did not take the
clinopyroxene saturation into account in favor of illustrating
the partition coefﬁcient without temperature adjustments for
a ﬁxed pressure.
As a ﬁrst step in the model, the melt composition is given
in weight% oxides (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Cr2O3, FeO,
MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O). As in [21], we consider
iron only in the form of FeO. After adding temperature (in
K) and pressure (in GPa) to the code, we converted the melt
composition to moles and calculated the mol amounts of each
cation to a total of 6 oxygen atoms in the melt. The resulting
mol amounts are then used to determine the amount of the
mineral components [21]:
Na = NaAlSi2O6 (JD)
K = KAlSi2O6 (KT)
Ti = CaTiAl2O6 (CT)
(Al − 2Ti − Na − K) = CaAl2SiO6 (CATS)
Ca − CaAl2SiO6 − CT = Ca(Mg, Fe, Mn)Si2O6 (DI)

3[Mg + Fe + Mn − Ca(Mg, Fe, Mn)Si2O6] =
(Mg, Fe, Mn)3Si1.5O6 (OL)
1
3[Si−2K −2Na−2Ca(Mg, Fe, Mn)Si2O6 −CaAl2SiO6
−1.5(Mg, Fe, Mn)3Si1.5O6] = Si3O6 (QZ).
Next, we calculated the model fraction of the jadeite
component NaAlSi2O6 (Xcpx
jd ) in the crystal with the
following equation [14][21]:
Xcpx
jd (T[K], P[GPa]) =
JD · exp


− 10.27 + 0.358P − 0.0184P 2.
(15)
To calculate the Ti content of the clinopyroxene M1 site
Xcpx
T i , we use the approximate relationship between CT in
the liquid and Xcpx
jd :
Xcpx
T i = CT · (0.374 + 1.5Xcpx
jd ).

We calculate the Cr content in the crystal M1 site Xcpx

similarly:
Xcpx
Cr = 5Cr.
(17)
The activity of the CaAl2SoO6 component in clinopyroxne
γcpx
CaT s is calculated from the product Ca for 6 oxygens in the
liquid and Al per 6 oxygens:

76469 − 62.078T + 12430P − 870P 2


.
To be sure that pyroxene is not unrealistically aluminous, we
apply an upper limit for the activity γcpx
CaT s of 0.4. The activity
of the diopside component CaMgSi2O6 (DI) of the liquid
γcpx
Di is calculated with the help of a parametrised parabolic
pressure dependence of volume:

now able to calculate the lattice site radius r0 [14]:

the literature [21][32]. For the model developed in this study,
we used the programming language MATLAB.
III. RESULTS
A. Thermodynamic Model Along Melting Temperature Proﬁles
In a pressure range between 0 and 15 GPa and a temperature
range between 1400 and 2400 K, the thermodynamic model
produces increasing partition coefﬁcients from low P/high T
(0 GPa/2400 K) to high P/low T (10-12 GPa/1400 K) condi-
tions (Figure 2). The increase is in the order of four magni-
tudes and coincides with experimental observations [33][34].
At higher pressure above 12 GPa and low temperatures, the
model starts to invert the trend and the partition coefﬁcients de-
crease with increasing pressure. However, for our ﬁt function
development we have used the P-T space between the solidus
and liquidus, which is not affected by this inversion. Along the
melting temperature proﬁles, increasing pressure always leads
to increasing partition coefﬁcients, while increasing tempera-
tures cause the partition coefﬁcients to decrease (Figure 2).
In Table II, we compare the thermodynamic model results
with experimental literature data. It is notable that most of the
experimental data ﬁt well to the model results. On average, the
coefﬁcients calculated by the thermodynamic model deviate
from the experimental data by 26%. The best ﬁtting value
deviates only 2.9% from the experiments at 0.0001 GPa and
1526 K, while the worst ﬁt deviates by 46.9% at 0.0001 GPa
and 1524 K. The implications of this variance will be discussed
in section IV.

With the new resulting scaling law (24), it is now possible
to calculate partition coefﬁcients for sodium at varied temper-
ature and pressure conditions.
Figure 3 illustrates how the rising DNa values correlate
with rising pressure along the solidus temperature. In contrast
to the scaling law of Blundy et al. (1995) [14], our resulting
scaling law produces steadily rising values up to 13.2 GPa
at the respective peridotite solidus temperatures. After this
point, the calculated values are starting to decrease. In contrast
to our study, the model values of Blundy et al. (1995) [14]
start to decline after approximately 5 GPa along the solidus
temperature. However, Blundy et al. (1995) [14] themselves
state that their scaling law is not to be used over a pressure
of 4 GPa.
In Figure 4, the decrease of partition coefﬁcients from the
solidus towards the liquidus becomes visible. This indicates

noted that at low pressures and high melt fractions, our ﬁt
seems to divert more from the thermodynamic model than
the previous ﬁt [14]. Consequences of this diversion on the

applicability of our scaling law (24) are explored in section IV.
C. Application to Potassium
Potassium is a prominent radiogenic heat source in the
Earth’s mantle [16][17] and therefore an important trace
element in mantle evolution models. Because potassium is,
just like sodium, a 1+ charged element, DNa can be used as
an almost strain-free ”reference” coefﬁcient.
In Figure 5, we plotted the resulting potassium partition
coefﬁcients DK over solidus P-T conditions with (1) the
DNa scaling law which can be found in the literature [14],
(2) DNa values modeled from the thermodynamic model, and
(3) our DNa scaling law ﬁtted to higher pressures (24). The
diagram shows that the DK calculated with our scaling law
(24) only diverts slightly from the DK values which were
calculated with the help of the thermodynamic model DNa
values: Below 4 GPa, the variation between the three models
is negligible. The largest difference occurs at 12 GPa with a
difference of 16.8%.
The scaling law from [14] also shows a good ﬁt to the
thermodynamic model in the range of its applicability (up to
4 GPa), but it diverts slightly more from the thermodynamic
model than our own scaling law, which was ﬁtted along these
thermodynamic model values.
D. Solidus and Liquidus Scaling Laws
To avoid the wide spread between thermodynamic model
and scaling law at low pressures (Figure 4), we created
two more scaling laws for solidus and liquidus conditions,
respectively. As described in section II-B, we added and
substracted 50 K along (12) and (13) to ensure no large
discrepancies with the thermodynamic model for small
temperature
perturbations.
The
results
are
presented
in
Figure 6 and the two new scaling laws along solidus and
liquidus are, respectively:

(26)
As is shown in Figure 6, both scaling laws ﬁt well to the
thermodynamic model along their respective P-T conditions.
However, the scaling laws seem to slightly overestimate the
partition coefﬁcients for DNa at low pressures below ap-
proximately 4.5 GPa, while they underestimate the partition
coefﬁcients for higher pressures. This results in a small tilting
of the scaling laws in respect to the thermodynamic model. As
a consequence, the largest difference between solidus scaling
law (25) and thermodynamic model is 33.5% at 15 GPa. For
the liquidus scaling law (26), the largest difference is as well
at 15 GPa with 29.8%.

In addition to the described DK calculations in sec-
tion III-C, we calculated DK as well with the help of the
solidus and liquidus scaling laws (Figure 7). As for DNa, a
variation can be observed between calculated DNa from the
thermodynamic model and from the scaling law for higher
pressures. For the DK calculations, we have used a literature
alkali basaltic melt composition [37].
As a comparison, we plotted experimental literature values
for the corresponding pressures against the calculated partition
coefﬁcients. The apparent wide spread of the data is discussed
below in section IV-C.
The melt compositions of the experimental data as used in
our calculations [36][37][38][39] can be found in Table III.

IV. DISCUSSION
A. Sodium Partitioning from low to higher Pressure
Partition coefﬁcients are highly controlled by pressure,
temperature, and composition. Since it is not possible for
models to include all compositional interactions between
a mineral and melt, comparing them to experimental data
is sometimes difﬁcult. This is especially true for higher
pressures, where partition coefﬁcient data is, to this date,
often lacking. However, the existing experimental data for
lower pressures already indicate if we can expect realistic
results from our calculations. As is shown in Table II, our
thermodynamic model results ﬁt well to the experimental
results [14][35]. Best matches were achieved for experimental

data at 0.0001 GPa/1526 K, 2 GPa/1843 K and 3 GPa/1938 K
[14], where the model data deviates from the experimental
values by only 2.9% and for the latter two by 5.4%,
respectively. Interestingly, with 46.9%, the second largest
diversion from the experimental data is at 0.0001 GPa/1524 K,
which is at the same pressure and only 2 K below a very
well ﬁtting value (Table II). However, the experimentally
derived partition coefﬁcients vary more than what could
be solely explained by changing P-T conditions. Deviating
experimental and thermodynamic model results can happen
because of several effects. For example, analytical error
margins have to be considered. Furthermore, the composition
of melt as well as solid clinopyroxene can be much more
diverse in experiments than it is for thermodynamic model
calculations, which does not take these changes into account.
It should be noted that the ﬁt parameters in (14) differ from
the parametrisation in Blundy et al. (1995) [14], which is due
to the larger parameter space applied in our model. For a
comparison of the two scaling laws for various melt fractions,
we refer to Figure 3 and Figure 4. A direct comparison of the
resulting parameters for our scaling law (24) and the previous
study [14] is given in Table II.
Figure 3 illustrates that the partition coefﬁcients calculated
with our scaling law (24) over solidus temperatures is close
to the experimental sodium partitioning data. This data is
indicated by a shaded grey area and, for DNa in the Ab80Di20
system, by darker grey dots [34]. A direct comparison with
appropriate temperatures in the range of the experimental data
[34] shows that here, the thermodynamic model is within an
error of on average 32%.
As is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, our and the previous
ﬁt [14] do not completely agree with each other. Blundy et al.
(1995) [14] parametrised their thermodynamically calculated
results over a peridotite solidus of McKenzie and Bickle
(1988) [40], while we took the peridotite solidus equation
of de Smet (1999) [25]. This could have produced a small
shift in the DNa-P-T ﬁeld and, therefore, in the resulting
ﬁt function. Also, a different parametrisation method could
have been used by the previous study [14], which might have
produced slightly different ﬁts. Finally, the previous study
[14] concentrated more on low pressure partitioning, whereas
we have tried to parametrise the function up to the 410 km
discontinuity. The inclusion of higher pressures could also
be the reason why at pressures below 4 GPa (especially at
higher melt fractions) our scaling law (24) ﬁts less well to
the thermodynamic model values than the older model [14].
Between 4 and 12 GPa, our scaling law (24) ﬁts well to
the thermodynamic data over all melt fraction values from
solidus to liquidus. However, at high melt fractions below
4 GPa, larger diversions from the original ﬁt function [14]
appear (Figure 4). The reason for this lies in the nature of the
least square parametrisation used in Python 3, which allows
the scaling law to divert from the thermodynamic model at
low pressures for the expense of being applicable to higher
pressures and to a wide range of melt fractions. If we would
only parametrise the model over the solidus, the shift would
disappear at the expense of the model being applicable to
any other P-T conditions. Thus, the included P-T conditions
for the varying melt fractions ensure that the model is useful
over a wide range of pressures and temperatures, but limits
the applicability of the scaling law for higher melt fractions
to a range between 4 and 12 GPa.
In the upper mantle, buoyant melt can occur up to the
depth where it becomes gravitationally stable and a density
inversion of melt and solid surrounding material takes place
(the so-called density crossover). In other words, melts
formed at higher pressures may not be able to rise to the
surface [41][42]. However, this is only true for upper mantle
melts and melts rising upwards in lower regions of the Earth
can not be ruled out [43]. Inside Earth, the density crossover
exists at approximately 11-12 GPa at 2000◦C [44], and in
Mars between 7 GPa [44] and 7.5 GPa [45]. To include
pressure and temperature dependent partition coefﬁcients into
a mantle evolution model, it would often sufﬁce to be able
to calculate them up to the density crossover. Overlapping
with the density crossover, in the Earth’s 410 km mantle
discontinuity (i.e., pressures of approximately 12-15 GPa),
phase changes occur [46] and pyroxene slowly starts to
dissolve into a pyrope-rich garnet to form majorite [47]. This
and the density crossover indicate that a parametrise up to
approximately 12-15 GPa is sufﬁcient.
As the experimental data [33][34] suggests, the partition
coefﬁcients
of
sodium
in
clinopyroxene
increase
with
temperature and pressure before they remain constant. At
solidus P-T conditions, our ﬁt function curve slowly starts to
ﬂatten and starts to fall at approximately 13 GPa (Figure 3).
This coincides with the thermodynamic model, where (along
the solidus) the partition coefﬁcients start to decrease at
12.5 GPa. Combining these ﬁndings with the occurence of
a density crossover and transition zone at approximately
12 GPa, we suggest to not use our scaling law (24) above
this pressure.
As is discussed above, the scaling law (24) works well for
melting P-T conditions between the peridotite solidus and
liquidus between 4 and 12 GPa. Thus, it can be considered
as a useful expansion of the previous scaling law for DNa
[14]. Because of the broad P-T range, the model should
not only be useful for mantle melting, but also for models
which crystallise melt, as is the case in a magma ocean.
However, as recent studies have suggested, the solidus and
liquidus temperature may change heavily depending on if
material is melting or crystallising [48]. If this is the case,
our model could lie outside of the P-T range between solidus
and liquidus for crystallising liquids and would have to be
extrapolated. Therefore, one has to be careful with the usage
of the ﬁts.
B. Solidus and Liquidus Scaling Law
To avoid the usage of two scaling laws to cover the pressure
range of 0-12 GPa, we developed separate scaling laws which
are only useful along the solidus and liquidus P-T conditions.

134

It is shown in Figure 6 that, in contrast to the scaling law
for various melt fractions (24), especially the liquidus scaling
law (26) ﬁts much better to the thermodynamic model than
the more general approach (24) and works just as well as the
scaling law of the previous study for low pressures [14]. As
a consequence, along the liquidus it is possible to use the
respective scaling law (26) over the pressure range 0-12 GPa.
Along the solidus, the general scaling law over various melt
fractions (24) ﬁts well to the thermodynamic model (Figure 3).
In fact, it seems to ﬁt slightly better to the thermodynamic
model than the solidus scaling law (25). As a conclusion, it
might not have a big impact if either the solidus scaling law
or the more general scaling law are used from 0-12 GPa along
solidus temperatures.
C. Potassium Partitioning
To calculate clinopyroxene/melt partition coefﬁcients for
potassium, we have used DNa as a nearly strain-free ”ref-
erence” coefﬁcient as described in section II. In Figure 5,
the general DNa scaling law (24) leads to a very good ﬁt
of DK when comparing the thermodynamic DNa approach
with the scaling law. In contrast to that, Figure 7 shows DK
values calculated with the solidus and liquidus scaling laws
and compares them to experimental data. The experimental
data exhibits a very wide spread for close pressure ranges.
This spread can occur because (1) the experimental values
were measured for different temperatures, (2) the composition
of the melt differs, (3) components in the experimental start-
ing composition were neglected in our calculations but lead
to additional chemical reactions and inﬂuence the partition
coefﬁcients.
D. Application to other Terrestrial Planets
Just as the thermodynamic model, phase transitions and
density crossover behaviour all depend on pressure. Thus,
even for planets with a radius or mass different from Earth,
the ﬁt should be applicable if the mantle composition is
comparable to Earth. Additionally, the mineralogy of the
terrestrial planet has to be taken into account. If there is no
or if there are only very minor portions of clinopyroxene in
the planets upper mantle, our partition coefﬁcient calculations
for clinopyroxene cannot be used.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
With the new high-pressure scaling laws (24)-(26), it is
now possible to include partition coefﬁcient models depending
on pressure and temperature into mantle convection models
for the entire pressure range over which upper mantle melts
are buoyant. The newly developed ﬁt functions can be used
to calculate clinopyroxene/melt redistribution behaviour of
sodium starting from 0 or 4 GPa up to the mantle transition
zone of the Earth. This is in contrast to the scaling law by
Blundy et al. (1995) [14], which can be applied only from
0 to 4 GPa. We apply our new scaling laws as basis for
calculating the partition coefﬁcients for 1+ charge element DK
with (23). Possible approaches to model clinopyroxene/melt
partition coefﬁcients for the charges 2+ to 4+ are described
in Wood and Blundy (2014) [32] and are based on adjusted
calculations for the mineral’s lattice site radius r0 and the bulk
modulus E.
Compared to the existing experimental data, our scaling law
(24) allows for a good approximation of clinopyroxene parti-
tion coefﬁcients of trace elements between solid and melt. This
enables us to do self-consistent calculations of local partition
coefﬁcients for variable pressures and temperatures. Because
we parametrise our scaling law (24) over a wide range of P-T
conditions and melt fractions between the peridotite solidus
and liquidus, our model can be applied for any Dcpx/melt
Na
calculation between 1850-2360 K and 4-12 GPa. However,
if only the solidus or liquidus conditions are needed, the
respective scaling laws (25) and (26) might be more useful,
as they can be used over the whole range of 0-12 GPa.
The new, higher-pressure-tolerant scaling laws enable us to
model the redistribution of trace elements in terrestrial planets
in much more detail. Our partition coefﬁcient calculations for
clinopyroxene should be applicable as long as clinopyroxene
is present in the planet’s upper mantle in sufﬁcient abundance.
Future works could not only include the application of
our scaling laws in numerical simulations, but also further
investigations on partitioning behaviour in mantle material
as well. For instance, adding an orthopyroxene/melt trace
element partitioning model to a mantle evolution model would
provide an even more detailed tool to study on the trace
element redistribution from mantle to crust if used alongside
the clinopyroxene/melt partitioning model. Furthermore, it is
known that water lowers partition coefﬁcients signiﬁcantly
[49]. Consequently, our models would greatly beneﬁt from
additional adaptations for water-saturated melts.
For the thermodynamic model, ﬁt function development,
and the partitioning of the 1+ charge elements in clinopy-
roxene/melt, the source code is available in the TRR170-DB
[31].
