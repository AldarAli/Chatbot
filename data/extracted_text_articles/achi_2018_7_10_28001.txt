Abstract – This work-in-progress paper proposes a new 
numerical approach for the simulation of technological process 
of obtaining surfaces with given properties. This problem is 
relevant for many industrial applications. In medicine, 
nanotechnology enables us to create plasters, to implement 
bioprinting or to construct microsensors that will be used to 
detect cancer cells in the body. The paper describes a 
numerical method that helps to analyze different possibilities 
of producing functional surfaces coated with noble metal 
nanoparticles. Such surfaces may have many uses. Firstly, it is 
known that silver, aurum and other noble metals have a strong 
antibacterial effect. Secondly, the electrical conductivity of a 
noble metal is greater in comparison with the other metals. A 
set of numerical experiments have been done and their results 
are reported in this work. 
Keywords – multiscale mathematical models; numerical 
methods; nanotechnology problems; noble metal nanoparticles; 
nanoprinting in medical applications. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In the late 2000s and early 2010s, in most developed 
countries, the potential for further growth of productivity in 
the world economic and technological sectors was limited 
[1]. Recovery of high rates of productivity in the economy 
and its profit can not be achieved only through 
macroeconomic measures. At present, the answer to the 
challenge of preserving competitiveness and achieving high 
rates of productivity should be given by the scientific, 
technological 
and 
innovation 
policies 
pursued 
by 
industrialized countries. The purpose of these policies is to 
stimulate development and implementation of advanced 
technologies, whose performance significantly exceeds the 
characteristics of traditional technologies. 
The traditional and new mathematics, mathematical 
methods, numerical methods based on multiscale models, 
differential equations and classical physics underlie the 
development of the novel technologies. 
Nowadays, clearly identified directions that can be 
considered technologically mainstream include: information 
technology, biotechnology, nanotechnology, ecological 
technology, and cognitive technology. They represent a new 
technological 
interface 
between 
humans 
and 
their 
environment [2]. The progress of these directions defines 
technological development and its rate corresponding to the 
modern world challenges. 
Nanotechnology plays an important role in industrial 
and natural processes in a variety of fields including 
engineering, production of consumer goods, public health 
and biology. The creation of micro- or nanostructures on the 
substrate surface not only changes its topography, but can 
substantially modify the properties of the substance. By 
creating structures similar to natural objects, we can control 
their properties without changing their chemical nature. 
Multicolored butterfly wings are painted in all colors of 
the rainbow without any paints, geckos know how to run on 
steep walls without using glue, the leaves of some plants 
can purify themselves and repel droplets of water without 
chemical treatment. All this is possible thanks to the 
hierarchically structured topography of biological objects 
and can be reproduced with the help of nanotechnology [3]-
[7]. 
The typical size of noble metal particles is equal to 5-
50 nm. These nanoparticles are the strongest biocidal agents 
and are used in biosensors and numerous assays. 
Nanostructure materials with noble metal nanoparticles can 
be used as biological markers for quantitative detection. For 
example, silver nanoparticles are incorporated in apparel, 
footwear, paints, wound dressings, appliances, cosmetics, 
and plastics for their antibacterial properties [8]. The unique 
properties of silver nanoparticles make them attractive for 
numerous areas. 
It is known that materials can be modified with noble 
metal nanoparticles, using plasma treatment or cold gas 
spraying. In contrast to other technologies, this enables the 
creation of materials with different bactericidal properties 
and also high hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity. For example, 
the ability to absorb body moisture is an important hygienic 
indicator. 
In this paper, we study the nanoprinting processes at low 
and room temperatures (100-350 K). Cold rarefied gas 
accelerated to supersonic speed is used for transportation of 
noble metal nanoparticles to a hot substrate. 
In our previous works, we analyzed jet flows, streams in 
microchannels and other gas dynamic problems using a new 
multiscale approach [9]-[12]. This approach combines the 
traditional hydrodynamic models (we use quasigasdynamic 
equations [13],[14]) with Newton's dynamics equations for 
individual particles. In this paper, we use direct molecular 
dynamic simulation [15]-[18]. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section II states the 
current problem and gives some literature references to 
preview works. In Section III, we describe what methods are 
used in the research, and we consider the main

macroparameters of the system. Section IV presents the 
preliminary results of the current research. Section V 
presents conclusions that can be drawn from the testing 
results and addresses future work as well. The future study 
will exceed the scope of this research. Also, the next steps 
and future plans of this study are described in this section. 
In the paper an approach for the cold gas spraying 
process of the nanoparticles on substrate is discussed. 
II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
In the present work, the process of acceleration of a 
metallic nanocluster by a supersonic gas flow is considered. 
The purpose of this particular procedure is to allow the metal 
clusters to reach a predetermined constant velocity, which 
will allow these clusters to adhere to a hot substrate in case 
of contact with it. The procedure is illustrated in Figure 1, 
which shows a fragment of the spraying system. 
To describe the acceleration of the nanocluster, we used 
the equations of two-component molecular dynamics [18]:

U  is the total potential energy and it depends on choosing 
the interaction potential of molecules. The potential energy 
of the system is represented as a function that depends on the 
coordinates of considered particles and describes the 
interaction between the particles of the system. Selecting a 
specific type of interaction potential is based on a 
comparison of the mechanical properties of the computer 
model of potential and real material. To solve equations (1) 
and (2), it is necessary to consider all options of interaction 
l  with 'l  for

. As an example, the 
potential functions for modeling the interactions between the 
gas molecules and the metal atoms of the nanocluster can be 
considered, which were used in [19]. 
For closure of (1) and (2), the periodic boundary 
conditions were used.

IV. RESULTS AND DISSCUSSION 
As a model problem, the problem of acceleration of a 
nickel cluster by nitrogen molecules was considered. The 
dimensions of the cubic-shaped cluster were 243 crystals or 
8.4753 nm3, and the number of atoms was 55296 (see 
Figure 2). The initial position of the cluster center was at the 
point (
266.97, 34.14, 34.14)
; sizes were measured in 
nanometers. The acceleration was carried out by injecting a 
small portion of gas into the system. In this case, a gas 
microsystem containing 82904 molecules was used. The 
microsystem 
was 
under 
normal 
conditions 
(
273.15
T
K
=
,
101325
p
Pa
=
). Approximately a half of 
these molecules were pre-accelerated to speeds of 14 Mach 
(see Figure 3). 
The performed calculation was related to the analysis of 
the evolution of a shock wave and its interaction with the 
nanocluster and resting gas molecules. Figure 3 shows the 
longitudinal velocity distributions of the gas near the region 
occupied by the nanoclusters; values are averaged over the 
coordinate y. They illustrate some details of the acceleration 
process. At the beginning of this process, the front of the 
shock wave is scattered near the cluster. But the cluster itself 
does not move much. Then, it begins to accelerate slowly 
and evenly up to a certain limiting speed (see Figures 4 and 
5). The magnitude of this velocity is related to the amount of 
gas incident on the cluster and its total momentum. If the 
value of the total momentum of the gas is small, it will take a 
very long time to accelerate the system to a certain average 
speed. From the law of conservation of momentum, we can 
estimate the value of the total average velocity:

The numerical algorithm was implemented as a parallel 
program using the MPI [21] and OpenMP [22] standards.

performance of 60 TFlops.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we considered only the first stage of the 
process of spraying and deposition of nanoparticles on a 
substrate associated with the acceleration of a single 
nanocluster. The numerical approach based on the direct 
molecular modelling was used for this purpose. The 
continuation of this work will be connected both with the 
interaction of the cluster accelerated to a certain velocity 
with the substrate, and the general spraying processes, in 
which a lot of clusters participate. In the future, we will 
consider the nanoparticles of other metals. In this general 
problem, it is proposed to use the multiscale technology 
developed in previous works of the authors.
