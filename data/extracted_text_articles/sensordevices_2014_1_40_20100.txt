Abstract—An ultrathin film sensor, consisting of two serially 
connected Pt/Ti films with different sensitivity to obtain the 
output voltage, was developed. The hydrogen sensor, based on 
the electrical resistance change of Pt thin films upon exposure 
to hydrogen gas, is operable at room temperature. However, 
two different Pt/Ti films showed different temperature 
coefficient of resistance, so the output voltage changed by 
temperature change. In order to solve this problem, we 
developed a self-temperature compensation technique by  
optimized combination of Pt thickness and Ti thickness. As a 
result, the hydrogen sensor showed good stability against 
temperature change.

 INTRODUCTION 
Hydrogen energy is attracting attention as a clean energy 
in fuel cells, and the number of applications is growing. 
However, hydrogen has a wide range of explosive 
concentrations (4-75% in air) and hydrogen atoms are very 
small. Therefore, there is a risk of leakage and a method of 
detecting hydrogen leakage is required. Generally, sensors 
for detecting hydrogen leakages in multipoint should have 
high sensitivity, be low cost and have low power 
consumption. Many types of hydrogen sensors, such as 
semiconductor sensors [1][2], Field-Effect Transistors (FET) 
sensors [3]-[7], and metallic resistance change type sensors 
[8]-[10] have been studied. Semiconductor sensors operated 
above 300 °C are conventionally used, while FET and the 
metallic resistance change type sensors can detect hydrogen 
gas by using the work function change and electrical 
resistance change in catalytic metals at room temperature, 
respectively. Moreover, the metallic resistance change type 
sensors that use Palladium (Pd) are simple, so this sensor is 
suitable for mass production. However, a serious durability 
problem is caused by large expansion of Pd after exposure to 
high concentration hydrogen gas [11]. In order to address 
this problem, we previously reported a metallic resistance 
change type hydrogen sensor using Platinum (Pt) thin films 
instead of Pd [12]. This sensor can detect hydrogen gas by 
reducing the resistance upon exposure to hydrogen gas at 
room temperature. However, the resistance also changed by 
changes in the ambient temperature. Therefore, precise 
detection 
of 
hydrogen 
gas 
requires 
temperature 
compensation. In this study, we developed and evaluated a 
hydrogen sensor with self-temperature compensation.    
Section II describes experimental procedure. Section III 
describes the result and discussion. Section IV addresses the 
conclusion. 
 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
Pt/Titanium (Ti) films (Pt thickness: 30 nm, 20 nm, 10 
nm, 5 nm/Ti thickness 3 nm), were deposited on a glass 
substrate (0.55-mm thick) by DC sputtering to investigate the 
resistance change upon exposure to hydrogen gas. Generally, 
a Ti layer is used for improvement of poor adhesion. We 
previously confirmed that Ti shows no response to hydrogen 
gas [6]. However, the resistance change ratio, when exposed 
to hydrogen gas, reduced by addition of a Ti layer, because 
the resistance of Ti is added in parallel to that of the Pt [12]. 
Therefore, a thinner Ti film that has higher resistance is 
suitable, and a Ti (3-nm thick) layer was selected. Each Pt/Ti 
film on glass substrate was cut to dimensions of 3 × 10 mm2, 
respectively (Figure 1). These films were placed in a 
chamber that was designed to measure the response 
characteristics at a constant gas exchange rate. The resistance 
was measured by a four-terminal sensing method using pairs 
of separated current-carrying and voltage-sensing wires. In 
order to assess the basic characteristics, the sensitivities of 
each sample were evaluated with respect to air and hydrogen 
gas of 1% concentration (1%-H2) at room temperature. The 
gas was changed from air to 1%-H2 and back to air, and the  
sensitivity was calculated by the following equation.  
     ΔR / R = ( RH2 – R ) / R ×100 (%)    (1) 
where R and RH2 are the resistance of Pt/Ti film in air and 
hydrogen gas.  
However, Pt/Ti film also changed by temperature change, 
so hydrogen detection was severely affected. Generally, 
hydrogen sensor with a robustness to temperature in the 
range of -30 to 80 °C is required for detecting hydrogen gas 
[13], and it is necessary to detect hydrogen gas precisely in 
the temperature range. Therefore, we developed the 
hydrogen sensor with self-temperature compensation, which 
has two different Pt/Ti films were serially connected (Figure 
2). This sensor, utilizing resistance change of Pt/Ti film, can 
detect hydrogen gas as output voltage change. In this sensor, 
hydrogen response and temperature dependence were 
measured. As samples, Pt (5 nm thick) on Ti (3 nm thick) 
and Pt (30 nm thick) on Ti (3 nm thick) were prepared, and

the output voltage of Pt (5 nm thick) on Ti (3 nm thick) was 
measured in air and 1%-H2. The temperature dependence in 
air was also evaluated in the temperature range from 50 °C 
to 80 °C in steps of 10 °C. Moreover, to eliminate 
temperature effect more precisely, combination of Pt 
thickness and Ti thickness was optimized. First, resistance 
temperature coefficient of samples, which are Pt films 
(thickness: 30 nm, 20 nm, 10 nm and 5 nm) on Ti films 
(thickness: 0 nm, 3 nm and 20 nm), was measured in the 
range from 50°C to 100°C in the steps of 10 °C. Then, based 
on the results of temperature dependence, a hydrogen sensor 
with two Pt/Ti films, which was optimized to have the same 
temperature coefficient of resistance, was fabricated. The 
hydrogen response and temperature dependence of the 
optimized hydrogen sensor was also evaluated under the 
same conditions as previously mentioned. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The measured resistances of Pt/Ti films when exposed to 
hydrogen gas are shown in Figure 3. The results show the 
resistances of Pt/Ti films decreased for all measured samples 
when gas was switched from air to 1%-H2. This decrease 
was caused by the catalytic action of Pt. When hydrogen 
molecule is adsorbed on the Pt surface, the hydrogen 
molecule is decomposed into hydrogen ions and electrons by 
the catalytic action of Pt as expressed in (2). Basically, the 
decomposed electrons diffuse into the platinum as the 
carriers, and platinum electrical resistance decreases.

sensitivities to hydrogen gas when exposed to 1% concentration and the 
resistance in air. 
 
Moreover, when hydrogen concentration is decreased, the 
resistance recovers, because the absorbed hydrogen desorbs 
and the carrier concentration decreases. Figure 4 shows the 
sensitivities and the resistances to 1%-H2 as a function of Pt 
thickness. With decreasing the thickness of Pt film, 
sensitivity increased. This is because the surface-to-volume 
ratio of platinum increases with reducing the thickness. In 
brief, the number of carriers, generated by the catalytic 
reaction, increases in relation to the thinness of the Pt film, 
because the catalytic reaction occurs primarily on the surface 
without depending on film thickness. Also, the sensitivity as 
a function of Pt thickness is inversely proportional, similar to 
the resistance. The sensitivity depends on resistance and 
carrier caused by catalytic reaction. In this measurement, 
generated carrier is constant regardless of Pt thickness, so it 
is considered that the relationship of the sensitivity and Pt 
thickness is similar to the resistance. From these results, the 
sensitivity was increased with decreasing Pt thickness. 
However, the resistance did not completely recover when the 
gas was switched from 1%-H2 to air. This indicates that all 
absorbed hydrogen ions and electrons were not desorbed, 
and a long time is needed for complete desorption. To solve 
this problem, we reported hydrogen desorption using 
instantaneous large pulsed heating in a previous study [12].

|ΔR/R| in Pt (5 nm)/Ti (3 nm) film was about 3.4% after 
exposure to hydrogen gas. However, |ΔR/R| of 3% occurred 
by temperature change in the range from 50°C to 80°C, so 
the temperature effect cannot be ignored. To compensate for 
this temperature effect, a sensor consisting of two different 
serially connected Pt/Ti films, which are Pt (5-nm thick) on 
Ti (3-nm thick) and Pt (30-nm thick) on Ti (3-nm thick), was 
fabricated. The time response curve of the hydrogen sensor 
when exposed to air and 1%-H2 is shown in Fig. 5. This 
sensor utilizes the difference in sensitivities of the two Pt/Ti 
films, and the rate of voltage change (|ΔV/V|) when exposed 
to 1%-H2 was about 0.28%. Next, the temperature 
dependence in the range of temperature from 50°C to 80°C 
in increments of 10 °C was evaluated (Fig. 6) and |ΔV/V| 
was about 0.24%. This result shows the temperature effect is 
reduced compared with the single Pt/Ti film. However, 
|ΔV/V| with respect to 1%-H2 also reduced, so it did not 
improve the temperature effect compared with the hydrogen 
reaction. 
To compensate for the temperature effect more precisely, 
the resistance temperature coefficient of Pt/Ti films, having a 
combination of different Pt thickness and Ti thickness, was 
measured in the temperature range from 50°C to 100°C and 
the temperature coefficient  was derived from (3) as 
follows.

where RT1, and RT2 are the resistance of Pt/Ti film at 
temperature of T1 and T2 respectively, and ΔT is the 
temperature difference. As shown in Table I, it was found 
that the temperature coefficient of Pt (10 nm thick)/Ti (20 
nm thick) film is almost the same as that of Pt (5 nm 
thick)/Ti (3 nm thick) film. Therefore, Pt (5 nm thick)/Ti (3 
nm thick) film and Pt (10 nm thick)/Ti (20 nm thick) film 
were suitable for obtaining a sensor that is highly stable to 
temperature 
change.

hydrogen sensor can detect hydrogen without the influence 
of the temperature. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
A hydrogen sensor of two serially connected Pt/Ti films 
having different hydrogen sensitivity was developed to 
measure 
the 
output 
voltage 
with 
self-temperature 
compensation. The developed sensor can detect hydrogen by 
utilizing the electrical resistance change of Pt thin films, and 
is operable at room temperature. It was found that the 
sensitivity of Pt/Ti film to hydrogen mainly depends on the 
film thickness, because the catalytic reaction occurs 
primarily on the surface. The temperature coefficient of 
resistance in Pt/Ti films was evaluated to reduce the 
temperature effect in the sensor. As a result, the temperature 
coefficient of Pt (5 nm thick)/Ti (3 nm thick) was found to be 
almost the same as that of Pt (10 nm thick)/Ti (20 nm thick). 
By using the combination of the optimized thickness, the 
new type of hydrogen gas sensor was able to measure the 
output voltage with stable operation against changes in 
temperature.
