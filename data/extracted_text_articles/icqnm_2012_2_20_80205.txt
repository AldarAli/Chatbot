Abstract—The nanostructures have currently received the 
great attractions for highly efficient and simultaneous analysis 
of a number of analytes. Outstanding optical property of noble 
metal nanostructures is a powerful phenomenon applied in 
chemical sensing. In this article, we introduce coupling of gold-
capped silicone nanostructure prepared in fluidic channel with 
micro column high performance liquid chromatography. 
Micro column separation of the analytes was followed with an 
on-line deposition of effluent directly into a micro fluidic 
channel containing the deposited nanostructure. Effluent from 
micro column formed at gold-capped nanostructure a deposi-
tion trace, later analysed by surface-enhanced Raman spectro -
scopy. The optical absorbance properties of nanostructure, the 
analytes in channel behavior as well optimization of chro- 
matographic separation were investigated in this experiment. 
The surface enhancement factor 9.71 was obtained for 
rhodamine 6G in 30 µ
 µ
 µ
 µm wide fluidic channel. Optimum mobile 
phase composition was methanol/ water, 80/20, v/v. Detection 
of the analytes in 25 µµµµm fluidic channel was affected with 
capillary forces during deposition process.

 INTRODUCTION  
Micro fluidic systems are ideally suited for high-through 
-put chemical analysis since they offer high intensive analy- 
tical signal, consume minimum quantities of reagents, exhi- 
bit superior sensitivity and functionality compared to tradi- 
tional micro-array techniques and can be integrated within 
complex work flows [1]. Detection of picomolar quantities 
of untagged oligonucleotides and polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)-amplified desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples 
with interferometric and localized surface plasmon 
resonance properties on gold nanostructure was demon- 
strated [2, 3]. An integrated analytical device composed of a 
microfluidic element and sensitive Raman spectrometer has 
been used with nanocolloid-based micro fluidic or metal 
nanostructure-embedded systems [4]. New methodology for 
enzyme assay using a sensitive and selective nanoparticle 
(AuNP)-enhanced 
time-of-flight 
secondary 
ion 
mass 
spectrometry (TOF SIMS) technique on self-assembled 
monolayers (SAMs) was reported [5]. Implementation of 
different functional nanostructures into fluidics was also 
documented [6-9]. The patterned micropads made of copper 
nanowires on silicon substrate showed the potential for 
application as chip to substrate interconnects [10]. Because 
metal deposited nanostructures usually do not provide any 
separation function this is in many cases substituted by 
chromatography or electrophoretic separation [11-12]. 
However, there are a lot of results documenting the analytes 
separation directly at a nanostructured surface [13-15]. The 
integration of fluidics and optics, as in flow-through nano- 
hole arrays, has enabled increased transport of the analytes 
to sensing surfaces [16]. Uni-directional liquid spreading on 
asymmetric nanostructured surface [17] have enhanced sur- 
face wettability and enabled control of the liquid film 
thickness and final wetted shape. Liquid phase propagates in 
a single preferred direction and pins in all others. This is 
a key piece of chain coupled functional nanostructures in 
chip. As an example of multifunctional nanostructured sur- 
face can act silver nanorods array surface for on-a-chip 
separation and detection of chemical mixture by combining 
ultra – thin layer chromatography (UTLC) and surface- 
enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Limit of detection 
are between 10-5 – 10-6 M [18]. Another integration of the 
onedimensional nanostructures with the microsystems 
features with carbon nanotubes and nanowires [19]. 
In this article, we present the original results with 
functional gold – capped nanostructure that poses as a SERS 
nanodetector for the analytes former separated by micro 
column high performance liquid chromatogryphy (µHPLC). 
The separated analytes were deposited directly onto linearly 
moving micro fluidic channel with gold-capped nano- 
structure deposited inside. The separation conditions, a liqu- 
id phase behavior after micro fluidic channel dropping as

well SERS sensitivity were studied for future imple-
mentation in analytical microsystems or chips (with 
integrated multifunctional nanostructures; separation, unidi- 
rectional phase propagation, detection, etc.).

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Chemicals 
All the chemicals used (acetonitrile, dioxane, me- 
thanol, rhodamine 6G (R6G) and rhodamine B (RB)) were 
purchased from Alfa Aesar GmbH (Germany). All of them 
were of an analytical grade of purity. The µHPLC mobile 
phases were mixed in the proportions: methanol: water / 
80:20 (v/v); acetonitrile: water / 80:20 (v/v); dioxane: water/ 
80:20 (v/v) and also filtered through 0.2µm filters to prevent 
obturation of a microcolumn. The structural formulas of 
both rhodamines are given at Figures 1 and 2.

Figure 2. Structural formula of RB, M.w. = 479.21 g/mol. 
B. Materials and methods  
The black silicon nanostructure was prepared by 
advanced silicon etching (ASE) (STS MESC Multiplex), 
etching the plain silicon wafer with tiohexafluoride /oxygen 
plasma. The parameters of the etching gases and the 
conditions of plasma: SF6 flow – 99 standard cubic 
centimeter per minute (sccm), O2 flow – 90 sccm, coil 
power – 2800 W, platen power – 16 W, pressure process – 
5.06Pa, pressure base – 12.53Pa, time – 4 minutes. After the 
etching process, the substrate was covered with the layer of 
noble metal (Au) by e-beam deposition process. Single side 
polished silicon wafers with diameter 100 mm and thickness 
525 µm ± 25 µm [14].The different channels with integrated 
gold - capped nanostructures are given at Figure 3. 
  
               
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3. The microfluidic channels (different width) with implemented  
silicone  gold - capped nanostructure inside. 
In this experiment were used the micro channels 25 µm 
deep and 25 or 30 µm wide. Micro column high- performan- 
ce liquid chromatography (µHPLC) was performed by 
Shimadzu high performance liquid micro pump LC-5A 
(Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto Japan). LC-5A is a 
delivering system of mobile phase for µHPLC using a small 
plunger reciprocating pump. In this instrument, employment 
of the constant displacement with quick return (CDQR) 
enables pulsation-free and stable flow even with a single 
plunger. CDQR means delivery solvent at a constant rate 
and with high speed suction. This instrument has a wide 
range of flow rate setting from 1 µl/min. to 9.900 µl/min. 
Specific is a high delivery pressure of 500 kg/cm2 maxi- 
mum. For a liquid chromatography system, a micro volume 
high pressure injector model 7520 (Rheodyne) with 0.5µL 
sample loop has been used. Separation of both the 
rhodamines was done at a micro column Prote–Col C18 
(SGE Analytical, Australia), 150 mm long, 300 µm column 
internal diameter and pore size of 12 nm. Home made 
column holder and deposition device cell let move channel 
with constant rate and let effluent from micro column to be 
deposited into a fluidic channel. Complete instrumental set 
up is given at Figure 4.

Capillary µHPLC column was tested in the following 
conditions: mobile phase: acetonitrile/ water 60:40, v/v; 
mobile phase flow rate: 4 µL/ min; sample injection 
volume: 0.02 µL. A concentration of both the analytes in the 
mixture was 1 mmol/L. The Raman spectra were obtained 
using an i-Raman® instrument (B&W Tek). Excitation was 
provided by a 532.1 nm Nd:YAG laser. The laser power at 
the sample was approximately 9 mW. The acquisition time 
for each accumulation was 5 s.  
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. µHPLC mobile phase optimization 
The optimization of µHPLC mobile phase composition has 
been based on the preliminary results obtained from thin 
layer chromatography (TLC) as documented in table 1. The 
retardation factor Rf, was calculated for a each spot accord- 
ing to the following formula: 
                                                                                                                                
                              Rf = a/b                                                 (1)  
 
where a, b are the distance moved by the sample component 
(a) and the solvent mixture (b). The best separation 
efficiency has been obtained by applying mobile phase 
methanol (MeOH) - water (80/20, v/v). The worse 
separation efficiency was obtained with dioxane- water 
mobile phase. The analytes were spread when acetonitrile- 
water mobile phase applied. Separation was controlled 
visually by a deposition of µHPLC effluent directly to white 
adsorption substrate sheet (Figure 5). The first eluted was 
RB, that is pink- violet coloured, and as a second one R6G 
characteristic with orange-red coloured spot (Figure 5).

separated R6G and RB with MeOH-water mobile phase (80:20, v/v). Red 
arrow signals a micro column effluent deposition direction. 
In the next experiment, the same mixture of rhodamines has 
been separated with the optimized mobile phase. The 
analytes eluted were continuously deposited into linearly 
moving microfluidic channel, containing functional gold-
capped nanostructure that can enhance analytical signal in 
SERS. A micrograph of a cut microfluidic channel with a 
deposited nanostructure surface is given in Figure 6. 
Optimum effluent deposition rate as well a mobile phase 
flow rate were established at 2.7 mm/min. and 6 µL /min., 
simultaneously.

B. SERS detection of the R6G and RB at a gold- capped 
nanostructure 
Raman spectra of R6G and RB stock solutions at a gold 
– capped nanostructured surface are given at the Figures 7 
and 8, respectively. There are the small differences in 
Raman shift positions. Significant is a lower intensity of  the 
RB Raman bands to compare with R6G one. The Raman 
shift intensities were used for calculation of Raman signal 
enhancement for both the rhodamines at nanostructure in 
fluidic microchannel. The enhancement factor, fe, was 
calculated according to the following formula:

C. SERS detection of the R6G and RB at a gold- capped 
nanostructure after a separation at micro column and 
deposition of an effluent into the  fluidic microchannels  
 
Fluidic channels with the implemented gold-capped 
nanostructure were 25 or 30 µm wide and Raman signal 
shift  was monitored for more intensive shift bands: 610,  
1362, 1649 and 1506 cm-1 for R6G. Simultaneously, for RB 
the following Raman shift bands were concerned for data 
evaluation: 772, 1190, 1277 and 1564 cm-1. From Figure 9, 
resulted position of R6G in the 30µm wide channel 
confirmed by SERS spectrum. Signal enhancement factor fe 
for R6G was determined at value 9.71 (1362 cm-1) and 7.29 
(1564 cm-1). It is less than reported in the experiments at 
surface nanosatructure [20].

rhodamine 6G at fluidic channel with gold-capped nanostructure. Mobile 
phase : MeOH:water , 80:20,  v/v;  30µm channel width. 
In a Figure 10, it is demonstrated detection of RB after 
chromatographic mixture separation and deposition of an 
effluent into a fluidic microchannel. The values of a signal 
enhancement fe , were lower, ranging from 2.45 (1277 cm-1) 
to 2.30 (1564 cm-1). This is corresponding to difference in 
the Raman shift intensities (Figure 7, 8). In 20 µm wide 
channel was measured a lower Raman signal enhancement. 
It was in the range from  0.67 (1362 cm-1) to 0.59 (1564 cm-
1)  for R6G while only 0.19 (1277 cm-1) and 0.18 (1564 cm-
1) in case of RB, which means no enhancement at all. An 
effluent deposition in this channel was probably strongly 
effected with a dispersion of the analytes separated from 
column directly at nanostructure. A mass of separated 
analyte was deposited in the length deposition trace. From 
the next results, it was confirmed that both the rhodamine 
analytes can be detected at nanostructure directly into a 
fluidic channel. Moreover, functional nanostructure affected 
signal enhancement for both the analytes. A position of RB 
was spread and no so sharp as given at Figure 9 for R6G.

There were also observed the special driven processes 
coupled with capillary force in microchannel and an analyte 
mass transfer that will be studied later on.  The limits of 
detection, however, are fundamentally limited by local 
analyte concentration. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A gold - capped silicon etched nanostructure has been 
deposited directly into microfluidic channel. With special 
µHPLC system and deposition device the separated 
rhodamines 6G and B have been deposited directly into 
integrated 
nanostructure 
in 
fluidic 
channel 
after 
chromatographic separation. From Raman spectroscopy 
band shift results it was found that rhodamine 6G can be 
good detected at gold–capped nanostructure in a micro- 
channel due to analytical signal enhancement, forced by 
nanostructure. Thinner, 20 µm wide microfluidic channel 
did not enable the equivalent signal enhancement. 
Generally, a Raman signal enhancement value was lower as 
in the measurements obtained out of microfluidic channel at 
the same defined nanostructure. Integration of functional 
nanostructure into a microfluidic channel enabled separated 
analytes deposition, spectroscopic detection, position scan, 
comparison of signal enhancement as well study of 
behaviou in this environment. The integrated nanostructures 
generate new functions that were directly included in an 
analytical miniaturized systems to form an analytical base 
for a chip or sensor integration.
