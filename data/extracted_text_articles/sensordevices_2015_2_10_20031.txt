Abstract— In the paper, new possibilities for the preparation 
of partially selective redox electrodes based on passivated met-
als of the subgroups IV to VI of the periodic system are pre-
sented. The gas phase oxidation at controlled oxygen partial 
pressures (CPO) and the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) as an 
HV method are utilised as alternative methods beside the well 
established electrochemical passivation which leads usually to 
the highest possible oxidation state of the passivated metal. 
These newly available methods enable in principle the tailoring 
of oxidation states in the sensitive layer and therefore the op-
timisation of the electrochemical sensitivity and selectivity of 
sensors equipped with it.

 INTRODUCTION 
Measurements of the oxidation/reduction potential 
(ORP) are suited for online determination of oxidising 
agents like halogens or hydrogen peroxide in process and 
waste waters, if the electrode materials provide a partial 
selectivity [1]. It is already known that systems made of 
passivated metals of the subgroups IV to VI of the periodic 
system are suited for this purpose [2]. The favourable senso-
ry behaviour is related to the semiconducting and corrosion 
properties of the oxide layers with electronic and ionic de-
fects. 
The preparation of these layers was carried out so far by 
anodic oxidation [M(ethod) 1)] in half concentrated acids 
(sulfuric and nitric acid) [3], leading usually to the highest 
possible valence state of the metal in use at the outer elec-
trode surface. The inner oxide layer near the metal bulk can 
contain also lower valence states. 
In Table I, appropriate metals for the construction of po-
tentiometric sensors with partial selectivity are presented. 
Figure 1 shows a possible design for the described electrode 
according to the state of the art. 
Generally, electrodes made of these materials exhibit a 
cross sensitivity to the pH value which should be known and 
considered. As an example for such a behaviour results of 
the determination of nitrite by means of a tungsten based 
indicator electrode at pH values between -1.4 … 9 are given 
in Figure 2. There are two ranges with negligible influence 
of the pH value (range 1: pH= -1.4 … 1; range 2: 
pH= 4 … 9) on the nitrite concentration related electrode 
potential. Therefore, a simultaneous pH determination is 
always advantageous, whereupon the existing problems of 
pH measurement with glass based or other pH electrodes in 
strong acidic media should be considered.

To tailor the most important parameters sensitivity and 
selectivity of the described partial selective electrochemical 
sensors it might be advantageous to prepare oxide layers in 
contact with the electrolyte which possess several lower 
oxidation states with sufficient chemical stability. 
In section II, the preparation of the redox electrode by 
PLD and CPO is described. SEM pictures of the generated 
vanadium oxide layers and the results of the potentiometric 
determination of H2O2  are presented in section III.

NEW METHODS 
For the determination of H2O2 with partially selective 
redox electrodes of the above mentioned type vanadium 
based electrodes are used [4]. Figure 3 shows an electro-
chemical polarisation curve in sulfuric acid obtained with a 
vanadium electrode (purity > 99.8 %) within the range of UP 
= 0 ... 6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, Cl-
(sat.) at the scan rate 100 mV/s. 
The observed colour changes of the vanadium surface seem 
to be related with the formation of VO (green), VO2 (blue-
black) and V2O5 (orange) as the final state.

A further possibility for the preparation of vanadium ox-
ide layers with tailored valence state is the gas phase oxida-
tion at controlled temperature and oxygen partial pressure 
[CPO (M2)] according to Figure 4 [5].

dation of vanadium 
The oxygen partial pressure of a mixture of N2/air/H2 is 
adjusted precisely within the range p(O2) = 10-30 ... 0.2 bar 
by a combination of a solid electrolyte pump cell and a solid 
electrolyte measuring cell [6]. After gas passage of the va-
nadium sample positioned in a separately heated transparent 
flow through cell, the oxygen partial pressure can be con-
trolled again to measure the oxygen uptake by the vanadium 
surface [7]. Polished vanadium discs were placed inside the 
transparent cell and treated at different partial pressures and 
temperatures up to the point, where an oxide layer was visi-
ble by the unaided eye. 
Vanadium oxide films with defined oxidation states 
were realised also by using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) 
either in oxygen background gas or with oxygen ion beam 
bombardment of growing films (M3) [8] (see Figure 5).

of metastable phases of vanadium oxide.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, DISCUSSION, OUTLOOK 
Figure 6 shows microscopic/ SEM shootings of the sur-
faces of the vanadium oxide based membranes generated on 
metallic structures demonstrating that the methods result in 
functional films that cover the whole surface but differ sig-
nificantly in their microscopic appearance.

Apart from the method-specific created different chemi-
cal compositions of the oxides this fact mainly is caused by 
varying layer thicknesses. Furthermore, the layer presented 
in Figure 6iii contains a number of droplets, a known disad-
vantage of the PLD method. 
Figure 7 shows that with all mentioned methods sensory 
active systems of the type V/VxOy with partial sensitivity to 
H2O2 are realisable. The electrode functions vary widely. 
While with M1 there are method-conditioned restrictions in 
relation to the stoichiometry of the functional oxide, 
M2+M3 deliver clearly more options concerning the sensor 
optimisation.

Experiences gained from previous work on indicator 
electrodes for the determination of H2O2 based on anodic 
oxidation of vanadium have demonstrated that a use of the 
pure transition group metal is unfavourable since the func-
tional layers corrode quickly during the measurement.  
 
It has proved an advantage to alloy vanadium with tita-
nium before passivation [9]. By adjusting an optimal alloy-
ratio of both metals, it is possible to retain the functionality 
of the electrode over a very long period. In this context, 
results of corrosion measurements given in Figure 8 clearly 
indicate that the corrosion stability of the electrode mem-
brane can be increased significantly by adding titanium to 
the alloy.

For the choice of an appropriate alloy composition, it is 
necessary to investigate the upper alloying level of Ti at 
which the partial selectivity for hydrogen peroxide is main-
tained at the required level. 
 
Further studies within the scope of the work in process 
presented here include the following activities: 
 
- 
creation and evaluation of oxidised alloy coatings based 
on M2+M3 
- 
examination of the thesis supported in [10] that in the 
use of vanadium-titanium alloys as membrane material 
there is no need for an oxidation of the metals and reali-
sation of such alloys by means of M2+M3 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Beside anodic passivation, also CPO and PLD deliver 
suitable vanadium oxide based membranes for the potenti-
ometric determination of H2O2. The last two mentioned 
methods allow in principle a largely variable realisation of 
oxidation states for the vanadium differing from the value 
+5. This has an impact on the performance of resulting elec-
trochemical indicator electrodes. In future work, these ef-
fects shall be examined more closely and the new manufac-
turing methods for the specific application are to be im-
proved, too.
