Abstract— This study aims at evaluating the economic effect of 
a e-ambulance project, or emergency telemedicine in the rural 
areas in Kouchi Prefecture in Japan. The focus is on 
ambulances equipped with ICT devices which transmit images 
of acute patients to remote hospitals. Kouchi Prefecture started 
the e-ambulance project in Aki and Muroto Cities in 2012. 
From two cities, it takes approximately one hour to reach 
emergency hospitals located in Kouchi City, the prefectural 
capital. One of the merits of e-ambulance with the image 
transmitting system is that doctors in accepting hospitals can 
monitor real time situation of a patient and prepare for 
necessary treatment prior to the time patient arrives. They 
thus save time and effort. In measuring benefit, this study 
employs different methodology; the e-ambulance project 
enhances wellness of residents since they perceive more secure. 
Thus the contingent valuation method (CVM) is applied and 
willingness to pay (WTP) is used as an index of benefit and 
estimated based on surveys to residents, which amounts to 
1,747 yen per resident per year. Total cost calculated is 
381,792,228 yen over three years, and accordingly, B/C ratio 
amounts 0.459.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
e-Health has been implementing in many countries, and 
in order for the system to be diffused further, there are still 
lots of obstacles such as the legal framework, economic 
foundations of implementations, and other regulations. All 
medical systems were established in the age of face-to-face 
medicine fair prior to e-Health. To overcome these obstacles, 
it is required to demonstrate its effectiveness, that is, e-
Health contributes to efficiency of medical services and 
enhances wellness of people [1]. Therefore, its cost-
effectiveness must be proved by comparing its benefits and 
costs. The latter consists of equipment such as servers and 
peripheral devices, salaries and wages of doctors and nurses, 
and maintenance fees such as communication charges and 
other miscellaneous operating costs. On the other hand, to 
obtain its concrete benefits in monetary terms is analytically 
difficult, since the benefits mainly come from users’ 
subjective satisfaction which is difficult to measure [2][3]. 
Without a firm basis of its cost-effectiveness, the future 
sustainability of the e-Health cannot be guaranteed.  
The authors have been analyzing the benefits or merits of 
e-Heal in terms of the amounts of medical expenditures or 
treatment days saved by e-Health employing different 
methods, which are mainly statistical analyses [4]-[9]. These 
analyses became possible since the precise data of medical 
expenditures or treatment days were obtained. Based on the 
construction of the database, the effect of e-Health on these 
out comes were estimated for the various objectives or 
methods. The effect in the long-term effect such as 10 years 
is the example of the former [7], whereas the estimations 
without biases such as [5][8] are those of the latter. On the 
other hand, this study takes a different method other than 
statistical and focuses on the comparison of costs and 
benefits of e-Heath. In this sense, this paper examines e-
Health in terms of cost effectiveness.  
    In order to measure the benefits of public services such as 
e-ambulance which are not traded on the market, the 
following methods are utilized in this field: (a) travel cost 
method: (b) replacement costs method; (c) hedonic approach; 
and (d) contingent valuation method (CVM). In what 
follows, this study employs CVM, which has been recently 
widely adopted in the fields of health economics and 
environmental economics [10][11][12]. CVM measures the 
benefits to users in terms of willingness to pay (WTP), which 
is the monetary amount that users want to pay for receiving 
the service. By asking WTP of each user, we can then 
construct the surrogate demand function for the e-Health 
service. It should be noted that this paper utilizes the results 
of economic evaluation of e-Health for the assessment of a 
project which aims to introduce the system. If the system is 
not introduced yet, it is impossible theoretically to evaluate a 
project by asking residents about WTP. CVM, however, can 
be applied even in this case, since it asks imaginary 
questions to people relating to benefits [13]. Although CVM 
and WTP have a strong theoretical basis, CVM tends to have 
a bias because it asks for concrete valuation and choice under 
fictitious circumstances. Care should be taken to clarify what 
kind of bias it possesses and to remove them.      
    This paper aims to analyze the Cost/Benefit analysis of the 
e-ambulance project in two cities in the rural and 
depopulated areas in Japan: Aki City and Muroto City, 
Kochi Prefecture. Ambulances are equipped with ICT 
devices which transmit images of patient to remote hospitals. 
In the depopulated areas, the number of clinics and medical 
specialist is small and a patient with acute disease or 
wounded by accident must be transported to hospitals with 
full facilities. Traditional ambulances are equipped with the 
mobile communication system only for voice or facsimile, 
and accordingly information transmitted from the ambulance 
to hospitals is limited. Kouchi Prefecture started the e-

ambulance project in Aki and Muroto Cities in 2012. From 
these two cities, it takes about approximately one hour to 
reach emergency hospitals located in Kouchi City, the 
prefectural capital. One of the merits of e-ambulance with 
the image transmitting system is that doctors in the accepting 
hospital can monitor real time situation of a patient and 
prepare for necessary treatment when patient arrives. They 
thus save time and effort.  
The analysis in this study provides not only the firm 
theoretical basis of evaluating e-Health project but also 
practical guideline for regions which plan to implement e-
Health. In particular, surveys to residents were conducted not 
only above two cities but also Ino Town, Kochi Prefecture, 
which plans to implement e-ambulance. In this context, we 
can compare how WTP is different between two types 
regions which are implementing or not, we can compare ex-
post and ex-ante WTP. This study therefore leads to useful 
information to local governments which plan to implement 
e-Health. 
The structure of the paper is as follows: In the next 
section, the surveys to residents and their results are briefly 
summarized and explained. Section III estimates WTP based 
on the data. The content of various costs and the comparison 
with benefits are analyzed in Section IV. The brief 
conclusion and further analysis are presented the final 
section.  
II. 
SURVEYS CONDUCTED 
A. Aki and Kuroto Cities 
In this section, let us briefly describe Aki and Muroto 
cities. These neighboring cities are located in east Kochi 
Prefecture. They are mountainous and face the Pacific 
Ocean. Their primary industries are agriculture and fishery. 
Their population is declining, while the percentage of the 
elderly is increasing. Aki City with the area of 317.37km² 
has 18,657 residents and 8,055 households, and the elderly 
ratio is 29.14%, while Muroto with the area of 248.25 km² 
has population 17,490 and 7,598 households, and its elderly 
ratio is 32.94%. There are 42 in Aki City and 23 clinics in 
Muroto City, but no tertiary emergency medical facility in 
two cities and therefore patients who emergency services 
need have to be transferred to Kochi City. This is the 
background of the e-ambulance project. 
 
B. Surveys to residents 
The surveys were conducted to residents in Ino Town on 
November 5, Aki City on November 18 and Muroto City on 
November 19, 2013. We interviewed 62 in Ino Town, 55 Aki 
City, and 47 Muroto City, totaling 164, and asked questions 
pertaining to the following: (a) WTP; (b) effectiveness; (c) 
frequency of usage; and (d) user properties such as age, 
gender, income, education, and health condition. These are 
supposed to affect WTP of residents. 
     Let us examine characteristics of residents who replied to 
our questionnaires. 76 are males, while 85 are females 
(TABLE I). The average age is 42.7 (TABLE II) and 
regarding education, high school, junior college, and 
university and higher are equally distributed (TABLE III). 
153 are still working, while 8 not working (TABLE IV). The 
average family size is 2.9 (TABLE V), and people living 
alone and living with wife or husband share more than half. 
The number of children and grandchildren living in the same 
city is shown in TABLE VI. Regarding health condition, 
more than two-thirds replied either good, fair or all right 
(TABLE VII). Accordingly, the average frequency of 
visiting medical institutions per month is 1.6, and more than 
90% reported no necessity for outside medical help, and 
these are due to their average ages (TABLE VIII). Even 
though two cities located depopulated areas, they are enough 
neighboring clinics, and the most of them live close to clinics 
(TABLE IX).

ESTIMATION OF WTP 
A. CVM 
In order to measure the benefits of services which are not 
traded on the market, the following methods are utilized: (a) 
travel cost method: (b) replacement costs method; (c) 
hedonic approach; and (d) CVM. In what follows, we use 
CVM, which has been recently widely adopted in the fields 
of 
health 
economics 
and 
environmental 
economics 
[10][11][12]. CVM measures the benefits to residents or 
users of e-Health in terms of WTP, which is the monetary 
amount which users are willing to pay for receiving the 
service. By asking the WTP of each user, we can then 
construct the surrogate demand function for the e-ambulance 
system. Although CVM and WTP have a strong theoretical 
basis, CVM tends to have a bias because it asks for concrete 
valuation and choice under fictitious circumstances. Care 
should be taken to clarify what kind of bias it possesses and 
to remove them. 
B. Questionnaire 
We conducted the surveys to residents in Ino Twon on 5, 
Aki City on 18 and Muroto City on 19, November 5, 2013, 
and asked questions pertaining to the following: (a) WTP; 
(b) whether they know the e-ambulance project, (c) desire to 
continue the project; and (d) user properties such as age, 
gender, income, education, and health condition. The 
questionnaire related to WTP is based on the three-stage 
double bound method: We begin by asking whether they 
would be willing to pay monthly charges of 1,500 yen 
(US$15). This initial value in CVM method is important, 
since WTP tends to depend on the initial value. If their 
answer is “yes,” we then ask whether they would be willing 
to pay 2,500 yen (US$25). If they reply “yes” again to 2,500 
yen, their WTP is 2,500 yen. If “no”, then we lower the 
amount to 2,000 yen (US$20). If they reply “yes” to 2,000 
yen, then that is their WTP. If again their answer is “no,” we 
lower the amount further to 1,500 yen. In the first question of 
1,500, if the reply is “no” to 1,500 yen, then we lower the 
amount to 500 yen. If the reply to 500 yen is “yes,” then we 
ask whether 1,000 yen is acceptable. If the reply to 1,000 yen 
is “yes,” then his/her WTP is 1,000 yen. If not, it becomes 
500 yen. On the other hand, the reply to 500 yen is “no,” 
then we ask how about 250 yen. If the reply is “yes,” then 
WTP becomes 250 yen. If it is “no,” then we ask how much 
he/she wants to pay. They reply their acceptable amounts. 
These series of questions are standard in the evaluation of 
issues in public services, environments, and so on.  
     The distribution of WTP from the survey shown in 
TABLE X is as follows: more than 3,000 yen (5), 2,500-
2,999 yen (5), 2,000-2,499 yen (5), 1,500-1,999 yen (10), 
1,000-1,499 yen (18), 500-999 yen (30), 250-499 yen (36), 
and 1-249 yen (11). It should be noted that there are 33 
residents responded that their WTPs is zero. After checking 
their reasons, those are considered as “non-response,” and 
their replies are omitted from the analysis.

C. Estimation of demand function and WTP 
Based on the above WTP of each respondent, the demand 
function of the e-ambulance service is estimated; more 
precisely, the probability of acceptance to amounts 
questioned is estimated and the number of residents who will 
agree to pay. The functional form of demand to be estimated 
is assumed to be logistic, namely, 
 
Probability of acceptance = 1- 1/(1 + exp (-α-βlogWTP))  (1) 
 
The probability of acceptance is the ratio of the residents 
who reply that they are willing to use the device at the 
amount of charges provided in the questions. The estimated 
coefficients α and β are summarized in TABLE XI. The 
average WTP is calculated as the area under this demand 
function, which results in being 1,747 yen (approximately 
US$175) per resident per year. The mean value For WTP, 
which is the amount that the probability of acceptance is 
50%, is estimated at 1,379.45 yen. This paper uses the 
average value as WTP in the analysis in what follows.

IV. 
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS 
A. Total benefits 
In the Cost/Benefit Analysis, total benefits and costs are 
compared over the period of several years. In this paper, two 
kinds of the time span are used: one is three years, which is 
the same as the project period, while that of five year is also 
considered, which is usual period of public projects like e-
ambulance. WTP obtained above is for per resident per year, 
and it is multiplied by total number of residents, since all 
residents have a chance to use ambulance. The population of 
each city is 18,657 in Aki City and 17,490 in Muroto City as 
of January 1, 2014, and thus total population is 36,147. Since 
all residents have possibility of using ambulance, even if 
they are babies or 100 years old, the numbers of residents 
who receive benefit are total of two cities, we multiply WTP 
1,747 yen by population of 36,147, which ends up with 
63,148,089 (US$631,000). That is, one-year benefits of e-
ambulance services total approximately 63,148,809 yen 
(US$631,000). In order to obtain three and five years’ worth 
of benefits, the present values of three or five years’ benefits 
are calculated with a 4% discount rate, and we assume that 
population of two cities remains at the level for six years. 
This results in three (five) years’ benefits totaling 
175,243,694 yen (281,127,278 yen)  
B. Total costs 
The total cost of the system consists of two major 
categories; initial fixed and annual operating costs. The 
former is the items which have to pay at the first year of the 
project and covers that (i) ICT hardware equipment of the 
systems of transmitting and receiving images and related 
equipment, (ii) ambulance, (iii) costs related to software 
development and the purchase of software, (iv) installment, 
and (v) initial training cost. The latter, on the other hand, the 
latter is required annually and contains the followings: (vi) 
salary of ambulance crew; (vii) maintenance fees which 
consist of those related to hardware and software; (viii) 
gasoline mainly for ambulance; and (ix) communications 
charges for the wireless and wired devices.  These cost items 
are summarized in TABLE XII for the annual basis.  
 
 
TABLE XII. COSTS OF THE E-AMBULANCE PROJECT 
 
 
 
    In order to obtain total costs of three (five) year period, 
operational annual costs must be discounted at a 4% discount 
rate. As a result, the costs of salary in three (five) years are 
140,342,126 yen (225,137,915 yen), respectively, while 
those of miscellaneous expense including maintenance,

gasoline and communications are 9,990,328 yen (16,026,560 
yen). Thus, total operating costs for three (five) years are 
150,332,453 yen (241,164,475 yen), respectively. 
C. B/C ratio 
     From the above calculation, benefits total 175,243,694 
yen (US$1,752,436) over the period of three years and 
281,127,278 yen (US$2,811,272) over the period of five 
years, whereas costs total 381,792,228 yen (US$3,817,922) 
over the period of three years and 472,624,250 yen 
(US$4,726,242) over the period of five years. On the other 
hand, total costs amount to 381,792,228 yen (US$3,817,922) 
for three years and 472,624,250 (US$4,726,242) yen for five 
years. Therefore, the B/C ratio over the period of three years 
is 0.459 (see TABLE XIII), while 0.595 over the period of 
five years, that is, benefits are about half of costs for three 
year project, and about 60% for five year project (see 
TABLE XIV). It can be concluded that benefits are far 
smaller than costs. 
     Here the viewpoint is changed, that from the view of local 
governments which implementing the project, that is, Aki 
and Muroto Cities, they only bear the costs of operating 
costs, since initial costs are borne by subsidies from the 
central government, and they can bear only cost of operating 
costs. The B/C ratio calculated in this way is 1.166 over the 
both of periods indicating that for two local governments, 
benefits exceed its costs. Thus from the view of city, this 
project is favorable, and worthy to implement.

D. Comparison with other e-Health projects 
There is no economic evaluation of e-ambulance, but the 
results can be compared with other e-Health projects which 
are implementation of telecare. Telecare transmits health-
related data of its users such as blood pressure, ECG, and 
blood oxygen to a remote medical institution via a 
telecommunications network. The system is equipped with a 
simple device which, when used continuously, records the 
condition of the elderly or a patient’s illness in graphs, which 
are then used for diagnosis and consultation. Reports sent by 
the medical institution are also helpful for users to enhance 
their daily health consciousness and make an effort to 
maintain good health. Such positive effects have been 
identified through field surveys.  
    Tsuji et al. [14] applied the Cost/Benefit Analysis to the 
telehealth systems in the following four regions in Japan: 
Kamaishi City, Iwate Prefecture; Nishiaizu Town and 
Katsurao Village, Fukushima Prefecture; and Sangawa 
Town, Kagawa Prefecture. Benefits are expressed in terms of 
WTP  based on CVM, whereas the costs are calculated as the 
sum of equipment, salaries of doctors and nurses, and other 
operations. Then, the benefits and costs are compared in 
terms of the B/C ratio, and the results obtained are shown in 
TABLE XV. Since the users receive and perceive benefit 
from telecare by using every day, while benefits of e-
ambulance are less noticed by residents, WTP of e-
ambulance tends to be larger than e-ambulance.

   Thus the B/C ratios obtained for e-ambulance are similar to 
those of telecare, which were operated by local governments 
and received subsides for initial equipment from the central 
government. As a project, they are less than 1, that is, 
benefits are smaller than costs, while for local governments it 
is worthy to implement since benefits to the users are larger 
than costs which were borne by local governments. From the 
view of local governments which implementing the project, 
that is, Aki and Muroto Cities, they only bear the costs of 
operating costs, since initial costs are borne by subsidies 
from the central government, and they can bear only cost of 
operating costs. The B/C ratio calculated in this way is 1.166

over the both of periods indicating that for two local 
governments, benefits exceed its costs. Thus from the view 
of city, this project is favorable, and worthy to implement.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, WTP in Aki and Kuroto Cities and Ino 
Town is estimated by CVM and WTP obtained is 1,747 yen. 
According to our rigorous analysis, we found that this value 
is not different from the ex-post WTPs estimated in our 
previous research. The effects of the e-ambulance in Aki and 
Muroto Cities are also similar to realized ones in the other 
regions. These results indicate that WTP can be an indicator 
of potential effectiveness of regional health policy 
implemented by local governments.      
    So far, we have conducted surveys of four local 
governments as shown in TABLE XV. Except for Kamaishi 
City, their B/C ratios are approximately 0.5, that is, benefits 
cover only half of the costs. In addition, regarding the 
frequency of usage of the device, Kamaishi City also has a 
much higher ratio than the other local governments. This is 
due to charges, not free like other region, their efforts to 
promote usage such as a users’ association which organizes 
events to enhance consciousness towards health, and the 
participation by medical doctors in this system, which 
increases the users’ reliance on the system. It is clear from 
our previous studies that telecare is useful for consultation 
and maintaining the good health of the elderly and patients 
suffering from chronic diseases who are in stable condition, 
but it is not for curing disease. It therefore has a 
psychological effect such as providing a sense of relief to its 
users by the knowledge of being monitored by a medical 
institution 24 hours a day. This makes it difficult to estimate 
its benefits in concrete terms.       
     On the other hand, benefits of e-ambulance are hardly 
perceived by residents, except transported by ambulance. But 
the residents feel wellness because of e-ambulance, since in 
case of acute diseases they would be treated better than the 
situation without it. These benefits are less perceived and it 
is difficult to measure. CVM seems to be the only suitable 
method to measure benefits.
