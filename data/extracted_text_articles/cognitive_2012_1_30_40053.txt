Abstract—High functioning autistic people can exhibit ex-
ceptional skills with numbers, eidetic imagery and recall of
concrete detail, as brought to popular attention in the ﬁlm
Rain Man. However, it now transpires that these skills are to
some extent latent within all of us. We do not have access
under normal circumstances to this concrete detail, yet brain
stimulation experiments show that it exists in all of us. This
paper proposes that one of the reasons for this lies in the brain’s
need to conserve energy. Computer simulations using a spiking
neural network support this hypothesis. A spiking neural network
was set up with a number of feature detectors feeding an output
unit, which in turn generates inhibition of the input neurons.
This reduces the spike activity of the input, and thus overall
energy usage.
Keywords—energy saving; computer simulation; spiking neural
network; Bayesian prior; detail suppression
I. INTRODUCTION
The evidence from high functioning autistic individuals
shows the overwhelming advantage of concept formation in
the human brain. Such individuals tend to have weak concept
formation but can have very powerful perception and memory
for detail. The evolutionary signiﬁcance is abundantly clear.
What is less clear is why the raw detail to which these people
have access is not available to everybody else. The surprising
thing, revealed by direct brain stimulation, is that this detail
is not destroyed on the way to conscious awareness, but is
somehow blocked from access. This paper provides a novel
solution to this conundrum.
Early indicators that some of this low-level detail might
be accessible came from studies on victims of stroke and
brain injury, where, for example, a person might discover the
ability to draw realistically. Snyder and Mitchell [1] predicted
that such access might be obtained using brain stimulation
techniques in which the conceptual part of the brain was
blocked, because concepts inhibit lower level detail [2].
It transpired that this was indeed the case. The direct brain
stimulation techniques, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
(TMS) and the more recent technique, Transcranial Direct-
Current Stimulation (TDCS) can be used to “switch off” part
of the brain. By targeting the anterior temporal lobe in the left
hemisphere—a brain area highly involved in concept formation
and storage—it is possible to block access to concepts and thus
release access to lower-level detail. In the ﬁrst such study,
now nearly a decade old, drawing and proof-reading [3] were
found to be enhanced by TMS. So, for example, it is hard for
many people to see the word “the” when it is repeated on a
following line. The ability to spot the error is enhanced when
the meaning of the sentence is blocked by brain stimulation.
Likewise, numerosity [4] (rapidly estimating the number of
objects in the ﬁeld of view, inspired by an incident in the ﬁlm
Rain Man) also goes up with TMS to the left anterior temporal
lobe. Over the subsequent decade, a diverse range of higher-
level cognitive phenomena have been shown to be enhanced
through dis-inhibition with brain stimulation. False memory,
where like objects may get mixed up in memory tests (e.g.,
chair instead of stool), can be reduced in this way [5]. Even
the ability to solve visual puzzles can be enhanced [6].
There are numerous arguments for why this might be
the case, such as the possibility of computational overload,
discussed further in Section IV. In this era of information
overload, such an explanation is at ﬁrst sight appealing, but is
hard to quantify with our existing knowledge of the brain.
Closely linked to computational overload is the energy cost
of neural computation. The human brain uses about 20% of
the body’s energy [7] and various evolutionary changes, such
as the appearance of meat in the diet, may have allowed the
brain’s energy consumption to grow. Navarette et al. [8] show
that in over 100 species of mammal, adipose deposits correlate
negatively with encephalisation. This suggests that fat storage
and increased brain size are alternative evolutionary strategies
for avoiding starvation.
Laughlin and Sejnowski [9] show that the brain’s overar-
ching network structure is consistent with preserving energy.
The energy required for the transmission of nerve impulses, or
spikes, and synaptic transmission are very tightly optimized,
approaching the thermodynamic limits within cellular con-
straints [10]. Neuronal spikes account for a signiﬁcant fraction

of neuronal energy usage [11].
The idea that the number of spikes might be kept to a
minimum to save energy began with the idea of sparse coding
in sensory systems [12][13]. More recently, cells have been
observed which ﬁre strongly when the subject is exposed to
stimuli corresponding to a particular person, say Bill Clinton,
and to very little else [14][15]. They respond to the concept,
and can be activated by pictures, voice or unique events. Obvi-
ously, for most people such a cell would ﬁre very infrequently.
The alternative distributed representation might have many
cells coding for all US presidents. All of these cells would
be active for any president, thus making their average activity
much higher.
However, sparse coding is not the only way to reduce energy
consumption by neurons using action potentials (APs). Chang-
ing the kinetics of the ion channels involved in generating
the spike can reduce the energy requirements of the APs.
Sengupta et al. [16] show that considerable differences in
the relative cost of spike transmission versus the energy of
synaptic transmission may be found, depending upon the exact
ion channel kinetics, for example between giant squid neurons
and those in mouse cortex.
The strong need to conserve energy suggests a possible
explanation for why raw sensory input is not accessible to
us, excluding external means like TMS. It is turned off to
save energy. Snyder et al. [2] and Bossomaier and Snyder [17]
propose a concept model for how inhibition mechanisms might
generate the observed effects of TMS. The effect is to turn off
the inhibitory mechanisms, dis-inhibiting their targets.
Inhibition is of course widespread in the brain, and the pre-
frontal cortex—the area with most development over other
primates—abounds in inhibitory effects. But, evidence is now
emerging that even sensory perception in early areas such as
primary visual area V1 depends upon top-down modulation,
of which a large part is inhibitory [18][19].
Feedback mechanisms are a common way of modulating
input from lower processing areas of the cortex to higher
processing areas. Visual processing streams provide a good
example, where higher-order visual areas display an in-
hibitory top-down activity to lower visual processing areas like
V1 [18][19]. However these models only consider connectivity
patterns in the cortex related to visual processing. Jelinek and
Elston [20] have shown that on a cellular level, processing
complexity increases from V1 to prefrontal cortex, with layer-
III pyramidal cell dendritic branching patterns becoming more
complex and larger, thus requiring more energy. Higher visual
processing areas deal more with conceptual phenomena by
integrating simple bits of information from lower processing
areas.
Such top-down effects reduce activity at lower levels. Zhang
et al. [21] show that in inferotemporal cortex, activity corre-
sponding to a particular object is vastly different depending
upon whether attention is focussed on that object.
In this paper, we show that spiking neural networks, even
when using the most basic approximation to the established
Hodgkin-Huxley spike-dynamic equations [22], can exhibit
signiﬁcant energy savings within such inhibition models. We
note that the energy cost of neural computation is split between
the generation of spikes and synaptic activity, the relative
proportion varying across species [16]. This article focusses
on the spike activity component.
We consider two cases. The ﬁrst implements a concept
model outlined by the previous paragraphs. The second uses
a Bayesian or attention approach to reduce energy costs even
further. The essential feature of both models is the inhibition
of inputs as soon as a concept has been activated.
II. SIMULATION MODELS
The simplest approximation to the Hodgkin-Huxley equa-
tions is the Leaky Integrate and Fire model. Izhikevich [23]
points out that this neuron is capable of only a few of
the 20 or so behaviors of which the full Hodgkin-Huxley
model is capable. However, it is used here because if a very
simple model can generate the behavior we observe, then so
can any of the more complex models. This assures that the
model is reasonably robust to parameter variations. Since more
powerful neural models, such as the Izhikevich [23] model,
can imitate the behaviour of simpler models (such as integrate
and ﬁre) then these more powerful models will have the same
behaviour.
Equation 1 shows the model for one neuron, where R is
resistance, I the input current, u the membrane voltage and τ
the time constant:
du
dt = −u
τ + IR
τ
(1)
Synaptic activation is represented by an alpha function with
another time constant τs:
ε(t) = 1
τs
e1−t/τs
(2)
The two simulation models use the same type of neuron,
although the time constants are not the same.
A. Model 1: Basic Concept and Inhibition
In Model 1 we use a local inhibitory circuit, shown in
Figure 1. Since an eye ﬁxation takes around 200msec [24], we
assume this represents the minimum time for which a concept
would remain active. The inhibitory circuit requires around
20msec. It does not matter if input spikes come in as a single
volley or as some Poisson process; if the maximum spike rate
is around 100 spikes per second, the concept cell can see about
2 spikes in 20msec, and should it see a spike from every cell,
then it takes 40msec to turn the input cells off. This would
represent an spike-saving factor of around ﬁve.
B. Model 2: Prior Knowledge and Intention
There is abundant evidence of the use of Bayesian informa-
tion processing throughout sensory and cognitive processing.
For the purposes of this paper, the implication is that only
a small subset of feature detectors need to ﬁre to recognize
something, given the assumption that something is going to
appear.

Figure 1. The basic model. Sensory signals are the features in blue, of which there may be many more than 5. Green connections are
excitatory (from features to concept and concept to interneuron). Red connections from the interneuron to the features are inhibitory.
For instance, sometimes just a single cue, like hair colour,
might be enough to distinguish between two people. So if
we know that the person coming up the driveway is one of
two similar-looking people, then hair colour might be enough
to identify them. In this case, it is not necessary to wait
for all feature cells to ﬁre. Just a few cells may sufﬁce, in
which case inhibition can start sooner. This is the essence of
Model 2, illustrated in Figure 2. The prior neuron represents
the assumption of what will appear: as soon as it has its
minimal set of features, it activates the output neuron, in turn
suppressing the input activity early.
Now, assume that we have attentional control or a mindset
that one is going to see objects K5 or K7, represented by the
cell labelled prior in Figure 2. The facilitating cell is activated
from higher up, but is agnostic as to whether K5 or K7 appears.
It ﬁres slowly with a long recovery time and brings a small
subset of features closer to threshold. This only costs a small
number of spikes and synaptic events, since on average only
one cell will ﬁre, facilitating a particular hypothesis. Now,
only this small number of features needs to be activated for
the concept to trigger. But, since these features lead over the
remainder, only they will be allowed to ﬁre.
All simulations were carried out in Matlab using the Biolog-
ical Neural Network Toolbox [25]. The toolbox uses Matlab’s
integration routines for solving differential equations.
III. RESULTS
Figure 3 shows the spiking patterns for Model 1. The
features are suppressed for the duration of activation of the
concept, representing at least a substantial decrease in energy
usage. Whereas the activity of the concept and inhibitory
neurons are maintained throughout the 200msec simulation,
activity of the feature neurons rapidly dies away. Without
the inhibition, their ﬁring would also be maintained. Figure 4
shows the average number of spikes in each neuron over 100
runs.
The prior or attention neuron of Model 2 pre-activates some
of the features, as shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the
average number of spikes over 100 runs of this simulation.
In this paper, only one concept neuron is ultimately ac-
tivated, but a single prior could pre-activate any number of
feature neurons, in turn subserving more than one concept.

IV. DISCUSSION
The conjecture that it is possible to reduce the spikes gen-
erated by a feature might seem surprising. There is, however,
substantial work demonstrating that a single spike per neuron
may be enough for pattern recognition. Thorpe et al. [26]
discovered that people can make very rapid decisions on

whether pictures contain animals – so rapid that they are likely
to be able to use only a single spike along the path from retina
to associative cortex. Subsequent computational models have
demonstrated the feasibility of the single-spike model.
The information overload argument for detail suppression
suffers from a lack of understanding of what the brain can
actually do on a large scale. We know something about
the capacity of simple neural networks, such as the number
of patterns storable in a Hopﬁeld network or the Vapnik-
Chervonenkis Dimension of feedfoward networks. But on the
scale of the cortex, we have only the most rudimentary of
measures.
Darwin [27] famously remarked: to suppose that the eye
[...] could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I
freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. A century later,
Nillson and Pelger [28] showed that evolving an eye was
actually relatively easy. By the same token, without a very
good model of the computational limits of the brain, the
information-overload argument is hard to substantiate.
On the other hand, people are good at blocking out stimuli.
The noise of a busy road, the drone of the engines in an aircraft
cabin, the buzz of other speakers in a cocktail party – all
demonstrate our remarkable capacity to shut out interference
when we so desire. But this blocking is reversible and we can
turn our attention to the distractions themselves. Koechlin [29]
has shown that the pre-frontal cortex can select one context
and block others when choosing an action.
The blocking of sensory detail seems to be hardwired and
is not switchable. To turn off this inhibition would require
additional circuits to turn off conceptual information. In gen-
eral, such circuits do not seem to have evolved, and external
techniques such as TMS are required for their inhibition. This
would make sense: strategies to save energy would be likely
to have evolved much earlier than the expansion of the cortex
and its sophisticated ﬁlters and control mechanisms.
