Abstract— In this work, a three-hop wireless relay channels 
under the influence of Rician fading will be observed.  Three-
hop wireless relay system model is made as the product of 
three independent, but not necessarily identically distributed, 
Rician random variables. Some important wireless relay 
system performance of the first and second order, as 
cumulative distribution function, outage probability, level 
crossing rate and average fade duration will be determined 
and graphically presented. The impact of fading parameters 
will be highlighted based on presented graphs. Then, 
simulation software environment for modelling and planning 
the wireless three-hop relay systems performance under the 
influence of Rician fading will be described. The goal of this 
method is to minimize the transmission costs and provide the 
best possible Quality of Service for defined wireless 
transmission scenario.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Performance of three-hop wireless relay channels under 
the influence of fading have not yet been analyzed enough in 
available literature [1] - [5]. Different authors mainly analyze 
multi-hop relay systems with the application on dual-hop 
channels [6] - [8].  
The multi-hop communication in relay systems is 
introduced for improving the quality of transmission in 
cellular and ad hoc networks because of transmit power 
limitations. The benefits of multi-hop relays are visible in 
rural areas with small population and low level of traffic 
density. 
Multi-hop routing is the way of communication in radio 
networks where network coverage area is larger than radio 
range of single nodes [9]. So, to get to a destination, node 
can utilize other nodes as relays. This is also very justified 
for energy efficiency reasons. After the transceiver is the 
major source of power consumption in a node, and 
transmission to long distance needs high power, in many 
cases multi-hop routing is more energy efficient than single-
hop transmission [10], [11]. Hence, relay technologies have 
the potential to offer extended cell coverage, better energy 
efficiency and improved capacity over the next generation 
wireless networks. 
In wireless environments, properties of communications 
systems are disturbed notably due to the signal envelope 
fluctuations based of the presence of multipath fading [12] 
[13]. Because of that, it is of substantial importance to 
characterize these random fluctuations in terms of the fading 
characteristics and derive the first and second order system 
performance [14], [15].  
Although the existence of a direct path between the 
transmitter and the receiver, called line of sight (LOS), is not 
a prerequisite for wireless communication, in many modern 
applications, with the reduction of the coverage area there is 
a LOS between the transmitter and receiver. The Rician 
distribution is used to mathematically describe these 
propagation conditions with LOS. This is the reason we use 
this fading model in our paper. 
Namely, we consider here a three-hop relay channel, as a 
special case of multi-hop relay channel, under the presence 
of Rician fading. This case is important for the environment 
where an optical LOS is present. By our opinion, there are 
not enough reported papers in available literature on this 
topic. 
This paper consists of seven sections. In introduction, the 
main terms are defined. The literature review is presented in 
the second section. In the third section, the system model is 
shown. The first order characteristics of the product of three 
Rician random variables (RVs) are defined in the fourth 
section, but the second order characteristics of this product 
are presented the fifth one. The graphs for all performance 
are plotted and parameters analysis is done. In the sixth 
section, software environment for smart city mobile network

planning is introduced. The last section consists of 
concluding remarks. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
The closed-form expressions for the outage probability 
(Pout), the channel capacity (CC), and also the average 
symbol error probability (ASEP) were calculated in [6] for 
amplify-and-forward (AF) multi-hop relay network in the 
presence of Rayleigh fading. The analytical expressions are 
obtained for some scenarios of dual-hop relay systems. 
The output signal from multi-hop relay system is product 
of random variables at hops outputs. In [16], multi-hop 
system in the presence of Nakagami fading is analyzed 
through N*Nakagami distribution as suitable for modeling of 
realistic wireless fading channels. Statistical analysis of 
cascaded Rician fading channels is given in [17]. Different 
performance is derived for both fading channels in terms of 
the Meijer G-function. 
Our group of authors analyzed different products of RVs 
and obtained some system performance for dual and three-
hop relay systems in closed forms in [3], [4], [18], [19]. 
Wireless dual-hop relay system in κ-µ short term fading 
environment is presented in [18]. An analytical approach for 
evaluating performance of dual-hop cooperative link over 
shadowed Ricean fading channels is shown in [19]. All 
performance of product of three Rayleigh RVs are presented 
in [3]. The product of three Nakagami-m RVs is observed in 
[4] and some statistical characteristics are derived.  
Three-hop system is also observed in [2]. The second 
order characteristics for such three-hop relay system were 
derived. The knowing of second-order statistics (level 
crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD)) of 
multipath fading channels help in better understanding the 
effects of fading and then easier mitigation. As example, the 
AFD determines the average length of error bursts in fading 
channels [20]. So, in fading channels with relatively large 
AFD, long data blocks will be significantly affected by the 
channel fades than short blocks [21]. 
A knowledge of this fact is necessary for better choose of 
the frame length for coded packetized systems, designing 
interleaved or non-interleaved concatenated coding methods 
[22], optimizing the interleaver size, choosing the buffer 
depth for adaptive modulation schemes [23] [24], throughput 
(efficiency) estimation of communication protocols, and so 
on. Empirically-verified formulas for the LCR and AFD of 
common multipath fading models are necessary for all 
observed applications. 
III. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
The observed three-hop communication system is 
illustrated in Fig. 1 [7]. It consists of a source node, marked 
by (S), sending the information signal to the destination, 
marked by (D), using two consecutive relays, signed by R1 
and R2.   
All nodes are equipped with a single antenna operating in 
half-duplex mode. The contiguous relays help delivering the 
information to the destination. This is valid when the 
network nodes are under heavy shadowing, or when the 
distance between terminals is large, and also when the nodes 
suffer limited power resources [7]. 
IV. THE FIRST ORDER PERFORMANCE OF PRODUCT OF THREE 
RICIAN RANDOM VARIABLES  
For description of three-hop wireless relay system it is 
necessary to derive the first-order characteristics of the 
product of three Rician RVs. In this context, PDF, CDF and 
Pout will be analyzed. 
A. PDF of Product of Three Rician RVs 
Rician fading is a stochastic model for radio propagation 
where the signal arrives at the receiver by several different 
paths when one of the paths, typically a line of sight signal or 
some strong reflection signals, is much stronger than the 
others.

In Rician fading, the amplitude gain is characterized by 
Rician distribution. It was named after Stephen O. Rice 
[25]. Rician RVs xi have Rician distribution [25]:

In contrast to Rician, Rayleigh fading is a model for 
stochastic fading when there is no LOS signal. Since that it 
is considered as a special case of Rician fading. Rayleigh 
fading is obtained for Rician factor putting Rician factor 
κ=0. Because of that, derived expressions for CDF of 
product of three Rician RVs can be used for obtaining a 
CDF of product of three Rayleigh RVs, also for CDF of 
product of two Rayleigh RVs and Rician RV, and CDF of 
product of two Rician RVs and Rayleigh RV. The 
obtained results can be used in performance analysis of 
wireless three-hop relay radio system in the presence of 
multipath fading. This means that derived CDFs are used 
for the next cases: 1) when Rician fading is present in all 
three sections (
i  0
, i = 1, 2, 3), then 2) when Rayleigh 
fading is present in all three sections (κ1 = κ2 = κ3 = 0), the 
next 3) when Rayleigh fading is present in two sections 
and Rician in one (κ1 = κ2 = 0, 
3
  0
), and 4) when 
Rayleigh fading is present in one and Rician fading in two 
sections (κ1 = 0, 
2
0


,
3
  0
). A case with κ →∞ 
presents the scenario without fading.

C. Outage probability of Product of Three Rician RVs 
The outage probability is an important performance 
measure of quality of fading channels. Pout is defined as 
the probability that information rate is less than previously 
defined threshold information rate th. Actually, Pout is 
the probability that an outage occurs within a specified 
time period [14]: 
 
0
th
out
x
P
p
t dt

 
, 
 
 
 (5) 
where px(x) is the PDF of the signal and th is the system 
protection ratio depending on the type of used modulation 
and the receivers’ characteristics [27]. 
Using (4), Pout is expressed as [14]: 


out
x
th
P
 F

.  
 
 
(6)  
Some graphs of the Pout are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 
for different values of parameters.  
 
 
Figure 2.  Outage probability of product of three Rician RVs versus 
signal envelope x for different values of Rician factor 1 and signal 
power Ω=1. 
 
Figure 3.  Outage probability of product of three Rician RVs depending 
on signal envelope for different values of signal power Ωi and Rician 
factor =1. 
The choice of parameters illustrates the broad range of 
shapes that the curves of the resulting distribution can 
have. It is evident that performance is improved with an 
increase in Rician factors i. Also, higher values of fading 
powers Ωi tend to reduce the Pout and improve system 
performance, as it is expected. 
V. THE SECOND ORDER PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT 
OF THREE RICIAN RANDOM VARIABLES  
Level crossing rate and average fade duration of the 
signal envelope are very important second-order statistics 
of wireless channel. They enable useful information about 
the dynamic temporal behavior of multipath wireless 
fading channels. 
A. LCR of Product of Three Rician RVs 
Level crossing rate is one of the most important 
second-order 
performance 
measures 
of 
wireless 
communication system. LCR has application in modelling 
and designing of communication systems, but also in the 
design of error correcting codes, optimization of 
interleave size and throughput analysis. 
LCR is defined as the expected rate at which a fading 
signal envelope crosses the given level in the downward 
direction, expressed in crossings per second [15]. The 
LCR of RV shows how often the envelope crosses a 
predetermined threshold x [28]. Let us first determine 


pxx
xx
(the joint probability density function (JPDF) 
between x and x ), then apply the Rice’s formula [25, Eq. 
(2.106)] to finally calculate the LCR [13]:

Some graphs for normalized LCR of product of three 
Rician RVs versus this product x are plotted in Figs. 4 and 
5 [1] for different values of Rician factor i and average 
power i. 
It is visible that LCR increases when Rician signal 
power increases. The impact of signal envelope power on 
the LCR is higher for bigger values of Rician factor i. 
Also, LCR increases with increasing of Ωi for all values of 
signal envelope.

various values of Rician factor i and signal power Ω=1. 
 
 
Figure 5.  LCR normalized by fm versus signal envelope x for various 
values of signal powers Ωi. 
The impact of signal envelope on the LCR is larger for 
higher values of the signal envelope, when Ωi changes. It 
is known from theory that system has better performance 
for lower values of the LCR. 
B. AFD of Product of Three Rician RVs  
Average fade duration measures how long a signal’s 
envelope or power stays below a given threshold, i.e., 
how long the user is in continuous outage. This is 
important for coding design. 
AFD is derived from the LCR [4]. According to that, 
AFD is [30, eq. (9)]:

The normalized AFD (Txfm) of product of three Rician 
RVs is shown in Figs. 6 and 7 [1] depending on signal 
envelope x. One can observe from these figures that AFD 
has smaller values for higher parameter i and lower signal 
envelope x. Also, it is possible to see from Fig. 7 that AFD 
increases for whole range of envelopes and lower Ωi. The 
impact of Ωi is bigger at higher envelopes’ values. 
VI. SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT FOR SMART CITY MOBILE 
NETWORK PLANNING 
Moreover, we make use of the previously derived 
expressions within software simulation environment that 
aims optimal mobile network planning in order to support 
state-of-the-art services within smart cities. The tools are 
accessible using web browser and build upon the software 
engine presented in [8], [32], [33]. In Fig. 8, the workflow 
of this software environment is depicted. 
The first step in this workflow represents creation of 
user-drawn smart city mobile network model relying on 
3D graphical environment implemented using Three.js. 
When it comes to modelling, the following factors are 
taken into account: network provider’s infrastructure 
(represented as base stations); terrain configuration 
(represented as different forms of obstacles, such as 
buildings and trees); end-users of provided network 
service 
(represented 
as 
autonomous 
cars, 
drones, 
surveillance cameras); smart city locations of interest, 
referred to as places. 
Once user completes a network model, fading effect-
related values are calculated: Pout, LCR and AFD relying 
on NVIDIA CUDA [34] which makes use of Graphics 
Processing Unit (GPU). This approach is beneficial, as the 
time required for these calculations is reduced due to 
impact of loop-level parallelization. Considering the fact 
that loop-based calculations represent the constituent part 
of fading expressions [35], significant acceleration was 
noticed in comparison with equivalent program written in 
Mathematica and executed entirely on CPU – 59 times for 
Pout, 61 times for LCR and 69 times for AFD. The 
structure generalized structure of CUDA C kernel is 
illustrated in Fig. 9, where FadingMeasure is changed 
with one of the fading-related measures – either Pout, LCR 
or AFD.  
On the other side, we also make use of GPU hardware 
for prediction of service demand regarding the number of 
service consumers at given place within smart city. This 
prediction problem is treated as regression. 
The input (independent) variables are the following: 
place id, day of the week, daily average temperature and 
daily number of COVID-19 cases, as each of them is 
assumed to be affecting how crowded certain place would 
be. The output is number of mobile network users. For this 
purpose, we use deep neural network with three hidden 
layers, 30 nodes per layer and ReLU activation function, 
while there is one linear node in the output layer.  
Furthermore, Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error 
cost function was used, with learning rate 0.01. The mean 
relative error of this model was around 6%. In Fig. 10, an 
excerpt of Python code relying on PyTorch [36] 
framework for deep learning, defining the proposed neural 
network is given. The approach to service demand 
prediction builds upon our previous work done in [37]. 
In the last step, once we have both the fading effect 
measures and service demand predictions calculated, the 
procedure of linear optimization can be executed in order 
to find the best possible selection of base stations, suitable 
for the selected smart city places. In this context, linear 
optimization model is written using AMPL 9 [38] and 
optimization problem solved relying on CPLEX [39] that 
implements simplex method.

In this case, the optimization model’s objective 
function has goal to minimize the overall mobile network 
maintenance costs dmc[bs, p] for placing base station bs at 
place p. On the other side, it aims to maximize the network 
performance by keeping Pout and AFD as low as possible:

In this equation, x[p, bs] is decision variable that will 
take value 1 in case when base station bs is about to be

Finally, when it comes to evaluation of the proposed 
approach making use the synergy of GPGPU calculations, 
deep learning and linear optimization, the cost reduction 
percentage and execution times for different sizes of 
network models (number of base stations and places) are 
presented in Table I. According to these results, it can be 
seen that it takes more processing time for larger models, 
while the cost reduction depends on the specific model 
instance. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we analyzed the influence of Rician 
fading to the three-hop wireless relay system. The output 
signal from such system was obtained as the product of 
three Rician RVs. For this scenario, we presented 
previously determined formulas for the next performance: 
PDF, CDF, Pout, LCR and AFD.  Based on the presented 
results it is possible to anticipate the behavior of the real 
wireless relay system in the presence of Rician fading. The 
parameters influence is analyzed based on plotted 
graphics. 
Finally, in the last part of this paper, the previously 
derived expressions for performance of wireless system in 
the presence of fading were incorporated into GPU-
enabled network planning environment. Considering the 
achieved results, it can also be concluded that the proposed 
approach leveraging synergy of GPGPU calculations, deep 
learning and linear optimization, enables more efficient 
network planning. This approach provides the highest 
possible Quality of Service (QoS), keeping at the same 
time the costs as lowest as possible. The procedure 
depends also on the specific fading conditions in smart 
city.
