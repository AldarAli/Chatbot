Abstract— Due to rapid changes in climatic conditions 
worldwide, environmental monitoring has become one of the 
greatest concerns in the last few years. With the advancement 
in wireless sensing technology, it is now possible to monitor 
and 
track 
fine-grained 
changes 
in 
harsh 
outdoor 
environments. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) provide very 
high quality and accurate analysis for monitoring of both 
spatial and temporal data, thus providing the opportunity to 
monitor harsh outdoor environments. However, to deploy and 
maintain a WSN in such harsh environments is a great 
challenge for researchers and scientists. Several routing 
protocols exist for data dissemination and power management 
but they suffer from various disadvantages. In our case study, 
there are very limited water resources in the Middle East, 
hence soil moisture measurements must be taken into account 
to manage irrigation and аgriculturаl projects. In order to 
meet these challenges, a WSN that supports a robust, reactive, 
event-based routing protocol is developed using Ad hoc On-
Demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) as a starting 
point. A prototype WSN network of 5 nodes is built and a 
detailed simulation of 30 nodes is also developed to test the 
scalability of the new system.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are part of a growing 
technology that has been designed to support а wide range of 
applications in wireless environments [1][2]. Although 
sensor networks have been used in various different 
applications, environmental monitoring is а domain in which 
they have had а huge impact. Recent climate change-related 
catastrophes have illustrated the importance of a detailed 
understanding of the environment and its evolution for the 
wellbeing of human beings. The capacity of researchers to 
improve this knowledge is mainly limited by current data 
collection techniques, which are based on very expensive 
stations [3]. WSN’s are particularly useful in remote or 
dangerous environments whose behaviors have rarely been 
studied due to their inaccessibility. Therefore, environmental 
monitoring is an important area for applying wireless sensor 
networks [4]. 
In our study we are using WSN testbed for such harsh 
environments in Middle East region where the sun is present 
for at least 12 h per day which makes the climate very dry 
and hot. One of the biggest problems in the Middle East is 
the limitation of water resources. We need to measure the 
soil moisture regularly and very accurately to allow targeted 
irrigation techniques to be implemented. We are deploying 
WSN to detect when and where it is raining so that necessary 
irrigation control measures can be applied. 
Many research efforts have tried to deploy WSNs for 
such environments. But there are many issues with their 
solutions [3]. Hence in attempting to deploy a WSN 
successfully in these types of harsh environments and to 
ensure proper operation of sensor networks we need to 
resolve following issues. 
In order to deal with the harsh environment, it is 
necessary to build a system which has two main proprieties, 
i.e., event-driven and robustness. The sensor network should 
be reactive so that it can detect different events correctly, for 
example, the presence and the absence of rainfall and hence 
the changes in degree of moisture in the soil. After the event 
is detected, the affected nodes need to sample the 
environment at a much faster rate for example if the system 
is set to sample after every few minutes when it is not raining 
then it should sample at few seconds when it is raining. 
Hence the available bandwidth should be more at nodes 
affected by rain. Hence the required information is sent 
across as fast as possible and also accurately to the 
monitoring center or base station. 
Currently there is no such robust and event-based 
wireless routing protocol to react to such type of outdoor 
environments. Resource limitations of the sensor nodes and 
unreliability of low-power wireless links [5], in combination 
with various performance demands of different applications, 
impose 
many 
challenges 
in 
designing 
efficient 
communication protocols for wireless sensor networks [6]. 
In this paper, we discuss the shortcomings of popular 
routing protocols for our application and we exploit the 
advantages of the popular routing protocol “Ad hoc On-
Demand Multipath Distance Vector” (AOMDV) and modify 
it to achieve the objectives. To achieve the robustness of 
wireless sensor network (WSN) this project will enhance the 
protocol to be an energy aware routing protocol to expand 
the life time of the nodes. We also discuss in detail the 
design of a WSN testbed network that can provide all 
necessary physical parameters to be used in soil moisture and 
rainfall monitoring algorithms. We implement an algorithm 
for monitoring and controlling soil moisture events and

evaluate the network based on power used, throughput, etc. 
We deploy an outdoor WSN testbed for testing our 
algorithm. The rest of the paper is outlined as follows: 
Section 2 provides a literature review, Section 3 explores a 
solution approach. Section 4 looks at sensor network design 
and in Section 5 we provide testbed results and performance. 
Finally, we conclude in Section 6. 
II.
LITERATURE REVIEW
There are numerous routing protocols proposed by 
researchers in this area, to improve performance demands of 
different applications through the network layer of wireless 
sensor networks protocol stack [7, 8]. Most of the existing 
routing protocols in wireless sensor networks are designed 
based on the single-path routing strategy without considering 
the effects of various traffic load intensities [9, 10]. In this 
approach, each source node selects а single path, which can 
satisfy 
performance 
requirements 
of 
the 
intended 
applications for transmitting its traffic towards the sink node. 
Although route discovery through single-path routing 
approach can be performed with minimum computational 
complexity and resource utilization, the limited capacity of а 
single path significantly reduces the achievable network 
throughput [11, 12]. Therefore, due to the resource 
constraints of sensor nodes and the unreliability of wireless 
links, single-path routing approaches cannot be considered 
effective to meet the performance demands of various 
applications. In order to cope with the limitations of single-
path routing techniques, another type of routing strategy, 
known as multipath routing, has become а promising 
technique in wireless sensor and ad hoc networks. Dense 
deployment of the sensor nodes enables а multipath routing 
approach to construct several paths from individual sensor 
nodes towards the destination [13]. 
Discovered paths can be utilized concurrently to provide 
adequate network resources in intensive traffic conditions. 
In the past decade, the multipath routing approach has 
been widely utilized for different network management 
purposes such as improving data transmission reliability, 
providing fault-tolerance routing, congestion control and 
Quality of Service (QoS) support in traditional wired and 
wireless networks. 
However, the unique features of wireless sensor networks 
(e.g., constrained power supply, limited computational 
capability, and low-memory capacity) and the characteristics 
of short-range radio communications (e.g., fading and 
interference [14, 15]) introduce new challenges that should 
be addressed in the design of multipath routing protocols. 
In [7], routing challenges and design issues in wireless 
sensor networks were discussed. In [16] the researchers 
provided а brief overview on the existing fault-tolerant 
routing protocols in wireless sensor networks and 
categorized these protocols into retransmission-based and 
replication-based protocols. The researchers in [17] and [18], 
classified the existing multipath routing protocols in ad hoc 
networks based on the primary criterion used in their design. 
Many routing protocols have been proposed for Wireless 
Sensor and Ad Hoc Networks. Since we are interested in 
dynamic and event driven protocol, we studied the likes of 
AODV, which is a reactive protocol that discovers routes 
only on the basis of demand using a route discovery 
mechanism.  
It uses traditional routing tables with one entry per 
destination. The main advantage of AODV [9,10] compared 
to other routing protocols is that less memory space is 
required as information of only active routes are maintained, 
in turn increasing the performance. While on the other side, 
the disadvantage is; this protocol is not expandable and in 
large networks, it does not perform well and is not capable to 
support asymmetric links. 
Ad-hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector Routing 
(AOMDV) [19] protocol is an extension to the AODV 
protocol for computing multiple loop-free and link disjoint 
paths [20] which aims to remove the disadvantages and the 
limitation of AODV. The main idea in AOMDV is to 
compute multiple paths during route discovery. It is designed 
primarily for highly dynamic ad hoc networks where link 
failures and route breaks occur frequently. When single path 
on-demand routing protocol such as AODV is used in such 
networks, a new route discovery is needed in response to 
every route break. This inefficiency can be avoided by 
having multiple redundant paths available. Now, a new route 
discovery is needed only when all paths to the destination 
break. AOMDV can also be used to find node-disjoint or 
link-disjoint routes. But, AOMDV has more message 
overheads during route discovery due to increased flooding 
because it is a multipath routing protocol, the destination 
replies to the multiple RREQs which results in longer 
overheads. 
In [21], researchers improved the performance of 
standard AOMDV in conditions like mobility or multi 
communication. They proposed link reliability in route 
choice. They modified the Route request process to enable 
reliable paths using Bit Error Rate (BER). They tested the 
effectiveness of new protocol by considering these 
improvements under realistic conditions and the result was 
compared to standard AOMDV and AODV protocols to 
show improved performance. Researchers in [22] modified 
AOMDV protocol by proposing a new fuzzy logic based 
scheme. The proposed protocol was shown to select better 
paths and increase network survivability. An AOMDV based 
method (E-AOMDV) was proposed by [23], to conserve 
energy, find shortest path and for load balancing. In [24], the 
authors proposed a modified AOMDV protocol called 
Network Coding-based AOMDV (NC-AOMDV) routing 
algorithm for MANET. The proposed method tried to 
increase data transmission reliability and ensure load 
balancing. An algorithm find maximal nodal remaining 
energy was proposed in [25], called Delay Remaining 
Energy for AOMDV (DRE-AOMDV) routing protocol. It 
claimed to get a solution for finding maximal nodal 
remaining energy for all routes in selecting a path for end-to-
end requirement.  
An extension to AOMDV routing protocol was proposed 
in reference [26]. It was channel adaptive routing protocol to 
accommodate channel fading. The proposed algorithm was 
42

called Channel-Aware AOMDV (CA-AOMDV). It used 
channel average nonfading duration as routing metric. Using 
this it selected stable links for path discovery by applying a 
pre-emptive handoff strategy. A Modified AOMDV (M-
AOMDV) Routing Protocol for Maritime Inter-ship 
Communication [27] was proposed that provides routing 
recovery mechanism when a link breaks in an active route to 
reduce lost packets, this will reduce packet loss ratio and 
delay time. 
Another modified version of AOMDV was proposed in 
[28], called ant-AOMDV or ant colony optimization 
modification for AOMDV in MANET, in this research the 
writers uses the modified AOMDV for multipath routing 
using ant colony for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  
Another researcher [29] published a paper about 
AOMDV-PAMAC, they started their paper explaining that 
power consumption of nodes in ad-hoc networks is a critical 
issue, because they operate on batteries, they suggested a 
new link layer algorithm knows as Power Aware medium 
Access Control (PAMAC) protocol is proposed which 
enables the network layer to select a route with minimum 
total power requirement among the possible routes between a 
source and a destination. 
AOMDV modifications overcomes many limitations of 
AOMDV but it still has some limitations when used for a 
real time and robust routing scenario like we have. Thus, we 
modified AOMDV to suit our purpose and make it more 
robust, reactive, event driven, and energy aware. 
III.
SOLUTION APPROACH
Figure 1 shows the wireless sensor network being 
deployed over a large geographical area. Each node is able to 
measure the amount of soil moisture through the soil 
moisture sensor in the ground as well as detect the presence 
of rain through the rainfall sensor. The latter is necessary as 
the amount of soil moisture may not be enough to detect the 
presence of rain. In addition, the system must quickly react 
in order to discover over which part of the sensor network is 
experiencing the event: in this case rain. When rain is 
detected as falling in a given part of the system, the data is 
sent from the relevant nodes to a central administrative 
server or base station through the PC-USB Gateway. We 
have to change the routing so that information on the change 
in the soil content in the affected area could be sent to the 
server as quickly as possible. Hence, this data is routed at a 
higher priority that other information being sent. Our 
modified AOMDV protocol works as follows in two 
schemes. Under the first scheme, the sensor data under 
normal events (no rainfall) are sampled after every 3h for 10s 
and sent to the server. During these 3h, the sensors are in 
sleep mode to save energy and after the data is sampled they 
again go to sleep mode for another 3h. If we have rainfall 
event we implement second scheme, in which the data 
sample is taken after every 1s for the sensor node 
experiencing the rainfall event, hence the affected nodes 
send data after every 1s, since the soil moisture may change 
very rapidly. In second scheme, we also increase the priority 
of this affected node to transfer data to the base station 
through the gateway. All the other sensor nodes where there 
is no rainfall still keep sampling after every 3h. In our 
previous work [30], we proposed a modified version of the 
AOMDV 
protocol. To accommodate these 
changes 
dynamically we made changes in the existing AOMDV 
protocol and proposed a dynamic and robust event driven 
routing protocol as described below. 
Figure 1. Sensor Network forming mesh. 
A.
 Proposed Changes to AOMDV 
The plan is therefore to enhance AOMDV to support а 
dynamic event-driven system as detailed in this paper. The 
first issue is that the routes may change due to the change in 
status of the individual nodes, it is necessary to allow 
HELLO messages, which are used to detect link changes, to 
not just monitor links but to fully indicate the status of the 
node at the other side of the link. So in this case, HELLO 
messages would also indicate whether or not it is raining on 
the other end, the network load as well as the power left in 
the system. A key piece of data is whether or not а node is 
able to route data on behalf of other nodes. As explained 
before, if а node is at the center of а downpour, its data is 
probably more important than the data of its neighboring 
nodes so it should not route data on behalf of other nodes. In 
such а situation, the node should also not respond to routing 
request (RREQ) messages, which are used to discover routes 
to individual destinations. In addition, though HELLO 
messages will be sent periodically, it is necessary to have 
another message type which can be sent immediately in 
response to sudden environmental, link, or node changes. 
These messages are called STATUS messages and are sent 
to neighboring nodes. For example, when а node first detects 
rain, it will send а STATUS message which is picked up by 
other nodes. By storing this information from various nodes, 
it would be possible to detect where the rain is falling in the 
sensor network. 
STATUS messages will cause routes to the central server 
to be re-evaluated. Let us consider the case depicted in 
Figure 2. If node A that is not affected by rain, was using а 
route to the central server via node B and node A, now 
receives а STATUS message from node B saying that, it has 
detected rain; then node A, which is not rain-affected, should 
no longer send data through node B if possible, since, for 
irrigation purposes, the data being generated by node B is 
more important. Node A should look for another route back 
43

to the server using other non-affected nodes. This would 
suggest that routes may have priorities based on the 
importance of the data being routed relative to the data being 
generated. In this case, node A will downgrade its route 
through node B, resulting in other routes through non-
affected nodes being favored. This is illustrated in Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Routing decisions made based on external events. 
If both nodes, A and B, detect rain both nodes will send 
each other their absolute measurements as well as relative 
changes in the soil moisture content. Nodes with less relative 
soil moisture content changes which indicate less rain will 
downgrade routes through regions with high relative soil 
moisture content changes. So data will be routed away from 
the most rain-affected areas towards the least rain-affected 
areas. 
C++ language compiler has been used to modify the 
source code of AOMDV; this modification consists of 
several enhancements for the current AOMDV protocol. In 
the following, Algorithm 1, we describes the modification: 
Algorithms 1 
if (event == NO_RAIN) 
 begin 
//use standard AOMDV 
 end 
else 
if (event == RAIN) 
begin 
    sendBrodcastRainPacket(node_id); 
    Disable_hello(); 
    limit_response(); 
    setPacketPriority(1); 
end 
else if (event == END_RAIN) 
begin 
    Enable_Hello(); 
    replyto_response(); 
    setPacketPriority(0); 
end 
In the above Algorithm 1, when we detect rain we 
broadcast “node_id”, disable “hello” messages and set 
packet priority to 1 for the rain affected node. 
When a node is affected by rain it will receive a rain 
event, this event triggers a rain STATUS broadcast message. 
Every node that is adjacent to this node will receive this 
packet. The affected nodes will still send HELLO messages 
but stop responding to RREQ messages, this will prevent the 
neighboring nodes from seeing it and sending their data 
through the affected node. Finally, we implemented a simple 
priority for the packets that are originated from the affected 
node; all packets that are sent from this node will have a 
greater value for its QoS value in the IP header. 
If the event ends, the node will return to its normal 
activity, it will send HELLO packets normally and continue 
to respond on the RREQ packets and finally sets the QoS 
value to its normal value. 
Algorithms 2 
if (packet.type == RAIN_PACKET) 
begin 
    for each(r in routing_table) 
    begin 
        if (r.nextHop == packet.source) 
            remove(packet.source); 
    end 
end 
In the above Algorithm 2, when an adjacent node 
receives a rain packet it will immediately remove all the next 
hops that this node is involved in. This will prevent any node 
from sending any data through this node. 
IV.
SENSOR NETWORK DESIGN
Sensor network design is clearly described in this section as 
bellow: 
A.
Monitoring Goals 
Our proposed wireless sensor network will be used to 
monitor spatial variations in soil moisture as well as detect 
the presence of rainfall over time. Our experimental WSN 
testbed is set up in Jordan monitored surface soil moisture 
and presence of rainfall. Our long-term objective is to 
monitor soil moisture regularly so as to implement targeted 
irrigation techniques. The data we gather from our system 
will also be used for managing the irrigation resources 
throughout Jordan by providing improved guidelines for the 
Jordan irrigation management model. 
The reactivity of the system should be also very high to 
detect the occurrence of the event as soon as possible, as in 
this case, rainfall. When such an event is detected the data or 
sensor readings should be sent to the base station reliably and 
quickly and for this reason we need to select the right routes. 
This data should be sent to the base station at a higher 
priority than all other data being sent [30]. 
Wireless systems are likely to face errors as the 
environment in which these sensors are deployed are harsh 
environments, which might have severely dry conditions and 
can affect their performance. Hence we need a very reliable 
system which ensures that information is correctly and 
accurately routed to the base station. The sensor network 
must also ensure heavy data flow in case of rainfall so that 
no routes or links are overwhelmed with data. We need to 
44

ICWMC 2017 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications

manage the information flow and to also reduce redundancy 
from data to reduce traffic. 
Finally, since there are always energy crises in the case 
of wireless sensor networks, we need to carefully plan each 
activity to maximize battery life also take advantage of the 
high duration of sunlight available in the Middle East 
Region. Hence we make use of the solar-powered WSN 
nodes by which the problem is somewhat lessened. We still 
need power management as a lot of data will be sent when a 
wireless node is experiencing rainfall and it needs to send a 
lot of information and a lot of power will be required at this 
time. Hence, the sensor network needs to strike a perfect 
balance and trade-off between the power left and the 
information required to be sent. 
We are using ZigBee medium range communication 
module standard, which is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 [31], 
which has a lot of advantages such as: consumes less power, 
also saves power as it has sleep mode, has a large capacity 
network, is more reliable and has low cost of related 
components [32,23]. The authors in [33] have proposed to 
reduce energy consumption by using a routing algorithm, 
which is a combination of Ad hoc On-Demand Distance 
Vector Routing Junior and the Cluster-Tree technique. 
However, there is no practical implementation for all these 
research initiatives. In our system, power is directly saved by 
using priority based routing algorithm hence reducing the 
data at times of raining event when many data is produced. 
However, even after raining data should be sampled more 
frequently in order to keep track of the soil moisture. 
B.
WSN Architecture 
At each sensor nodes, we have a soil moisture sensor and 
rainfall sensor attached to it. Our sensor network is based on 
Libelium Waspmotes sensor nodes and ATmega1281rds 
Microcontroller [34]. 
It is 
connected 
to 
following 
components: 
•
Wireless Interface (Waspmote XBee based on IEEE 
802.15.4 standard) 
•
Soil moisture sensor (Watermark 200SS) 
•
Rainfall sensor (Libelium Weather Station WS 
3000) 
•
USB-PC Interface (Waspmote Gateway) 
•
Solar Panel (Waspmote rigid solar panel 7 V-500 
mA) 
•
6600 mA Li-Ion rechargeable batteries 
The current network deployment has four sampling 
nodes, but more generally, the architecture supports many 
nodes [34]. 
Zigbee RF nodes are used as communication models to 
transmit the sampled data to the gateway; these can have the 
best average lifetime of 8 years using dual batteries 3 V, at 
3000 mAh. Some studies like [31], show that ZigBee model 
based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard with correct topology can 
last up to 10 years. Hence, we are using ZigBee 
communication model for our research. 
C.
WSN Working Principle 
The objective of our research is to provide a dynamic and 
robust event driven protocol for soil moisture monitoring so 
that the results can be used in the future to manage irrigation 
resources throughout Jordan. We use a mesh topology for 
network connectivity because of its advantages in our 
application scenario. Mesh topologies are able to route data 
and messages to the final gateway node through several 
different nodes. Even if the connection to any RF node is lost 
because of any environmental tragedy or loss of power, etc. 
still all the important data can reach to the gateway node and 
the base station due to the mesh topology. 
D.
Hardware Design 
1)
Sensor Nodes: We are using Waspmote WSN as 
shown in Figure 3, which is an open source wireless sensor 
platform the speciality of which is implementing sensor 
nodes having low power consumption capability [31]. 
Hence, our sensor nodes can work autonomously, working 
on battery power and having a maximum lifetime of 7–8 
years [35] based on the cycle of operation, communication 
protocol and the communication module used. 
Figure 3. Waspmote Sensor Node. 
This RF module has a long range of 7000 m but lower 
power consumption than Wi-Fi (802.11). It operates at a 
very low data rate of 250 kbps at 2.4 GHz [36,37]. These 
modules have mechanism to extend battery life by using 
sleep modes. 
2)
Soil Moisture Sensor: The Soil Moisture Sensor 
Watermark 200SS [38] developed by Irrometer, as shown in 
figure 5, is one of the most important component in our 
research. It has very satisfactory features like stable 
calibration, a measurement range from 0 to 239 cb (kPa), it 
has 
no 
soil 
dissolvability, 
can 
withstand 
freezing 
temperatures, and is low cost and low maintenance [38].

3)
Rainfall Sensor: The rainfall sensor is a part of the 
Weather Station WS-3000, shown in Figure 5, which 
comprises of an anemometer, a wind vane, and a pluviometer 
[39]. The Weather Station is placed above ground on a pole 
and connected to the WSN sensor node. Our study is only 
concerned about pluviometer readings which provides a 
digital signal whose frequency is directly proportional to the 
intensity of rainfall.

Rainfall Sensor.

TESTBED AND SIMULATION RESULTS
The primary goal for this section is to clarify testbed 
setup and result for simulation and testbed. 
A.
WSN Testbed Setup 
We setup our testbed in a garden in Jordan. The current 
network deployment has five nodes, which are 5 m apart 
from each other, but more generally, the architecture 
supports many nodes [15].  
The setup of this scenario consists of 5 wireless nodes 
from node 0 (N0) to node 3 (N3), as shown in Figure 6 and 
one gateway node (GW) which is connected to the server. 
We will have two constant bit rates (cbr) streams, one from 
node 0 and the other from node 2. The destination for both 
streams will be gateway node (GW). We will call them cbr0 
and cbr2 respectively. According to AOMDV protocol, cbr2 
traffic will go from node 2 to node 0 then node GW, and 
cbr0 traffic will go to node GW directly. Node 2 traffic, cbr2 
will go through two paths, the primary one through node 0 
and the secondary through node 1. After three hours during 
sending packets, node 0 is affected by RAIN (which is the 
event). 
Figure 5. Five Node wireless sensor network (WSN) Test Bed Setup. 
Tables I and Table II show the result of routing table 
before and after rain is detected at node 0, the routing table 
for node 2 and 3 has been changed which take another route 
through node 1 instead of the primary one through node 0 to 
send data to GW (destination) because node 0 is affected by 
RAIN. Hence, node 0 has very important data (soil moisture) 
and it has to send it first and should take the highest priority 
to send data.

Simulation Setup 
To show that our proposed protocol is also expandable 
we used simulation tools for 5 nodes scenario and for a very 
large scenario consisting of 30 nodes. The source code of the 
simulation is written in TCL language and runs the 
simulation example on ns-2.35 Linux Ubuntu version 12. 
For 5 node setup, we use standard AOMDV in first 
period from 0 to 900 in second one from 900 to 2000 we use 
the modified version of AOMDV. 
An AWK script was built to calculate the average of 
Throughput and End to End Delay on node 0 and node 1 
before and after node 1 is affected by raining. The highest 
priority data stream will grant to cbr1 coming from node 1 
because it affected by rain and it has important data that 
should be send to the destination node 2. Rerouting cbr0 
coming from node 0 traffic through node 4, which has data 
with low priority. In this way we reduce forwarding load on 
node 1 that means the throughput and end to end delay will 
be better on cbr1 after node 1 affected by rain.  
For the complex scenario consisting of 30 nodes, we 
calculate that 5 out of 30 nodes were affected by rain and 
measure the performance and the energy consumption. 
There are 30 wireless nodes from node 0 to node 29 
distributed with fixed location across the testbed as shown in 
Figure 7. We will have two constant bit rates (cbr) streams 
one from node 0 and one from node 1 the destination for 
both streams will be node 29 (GW) we will call them cbr0 
and cbr1 respectively. According to AOMDV, protocol cbr0 
traffic will go through the path node 0 -> node 1 -> node 2 -> 
node 13 -> node 4 -> node 15 -> node 6 -> node 17 -> node 
18 then node 29, and cbr1 traffic will go through the same 
path. 
Figure 6. 30-Nodes Simulation Setup. 
The five nodes which are affected by rain are 1, 12, 16, 
21, 25. This means that node 0 or 1 will use secondary paths 
when any node in the primary path is affected by RAIN. 
Simulation time is 2500 ms, we set up the constant bit 
rate (cbr) with variable rate values depending on rain level. 
For example, when it is raining lightly, the (cbr) rate will be 
0.05 Mbps, when rain becomes heavier, the (cbr) rate 
changed to 0.1 Mbps and, finally, when flood occurs, the 
(cbr) rate changes to 0.5 Mbps. Packet size for all (cbr) is 
1000 byte.

Performance Measurements for 30 Node Simulation 
Setup 
Before rainfall, we used the standard AOMDV protocol 
and after the rainfall, we used our modified AOMDV 
protocol to compare its performance with the standard 
AOMDV. In this simulation scenario we divided the 
simulation period depending on raining level, for instance 
with no rain the period from 0 to 900 s, light rain period from 
900 to 2000 s and heavy rain from 2000 to 2500 s. 
Node 1 is affected by two levels of rain light rain and 
heavy rain, so we compared the Throughput and End to End 
Delay in two levels. 
The results listed in Table IV clearly show improvement 
in Throughput and End to End Delay on cbr1 coming from 
node 1 which validates our assumptions and it shows that the 
event-driven approach does improve overall network 
efficiency.

Figure 7 shows the throughput of Node 1, separately 
being affected by rain. The reason behind this increase in 
throughput is that at heavy and very heavy rain, we use the 
modified AOMDV protocol.

D.
Energy Consumption 
We measure the energy consumption in three modes for 
each sensor node, idle mode, receiving mode and 
transmitting mode. The energy consumed in idle mode is 
called idle energy (Idle Energy). The energy consumed by a 
node in transmission of data is called transmission energy 
(Trans Energy) and the energy consumed by a node to 
receive data is called receiving energy (Rec Energy). 
When a node is affected by rain it will receive a rain 
event, this event triggers a special broadcast rain packet 
called STATUS message. Every node that is adjacent to this 
node will receive this packet. The affected nodes will still 
send HELLO messages but stop responding to RREQ 
messages, this will prevent the neighboring nodes from 
seeing it and sending their data through the affected node. 
Hence, the nodes affected by rainfall will not receive any 
packets from other nodes and hence they will require very 
less receiving energy, on the other hand, they will just have 
their own data to transmit, hence the transmission energy 
also decreases. 
1)
Energy Consumption for 5 Node WSN Testbed 
The Waspmotes consumes 15mA of energy per hour in 
switched on state and just consumes 55µA of energy per 
hour in sleep state [40]. We have designed our protocol to be 
energy-efficient. In our protocol sensor, data under normal 
events are sampled for 10s after every 3h and sent to the 
server. When we measured energy consumption for our 
protocol it was found that, it only consumes 0.004 mA of 
energy per hour. If we have a rainfall event, we implement 
second scheme under which we sample the data for 10s after 
every 10s, only for the sensor node experiencing the rainfall 
event, since the soil moisture may change very rapidly. In 
second scheme, when there is a rainfall our protocol 
consumes only 0.042 mA of energy per hour for the effected 
node, which is also very less than the default energy 
consumption of 15 mA per hour for the Waspmote [40]. 
Hence, our protocol is also energy efficient. 
As shown in Tables V and VI the energy measurements 
in mA taken after rainfall when we use modified AOMDV, 
are less than those taken before rainfall when we use 
standard AOMDV, for both received energy (Rec Energy) as 
well as transmission energy (Trans Energy) because the 
nodes affected by rainfall will not receive any data from 
other nodes and hence they will require very less receiving 
energy, on the other hand they will just have their own data 
to transmit, hence the transmission energy also decreases. 
We also show these results in Figures 8 and 9.

Energy Consumption for 30 Node Simulation Setup 
This section of our paper is concerned about the energy, 
consumptions for all nodes before the nodes are affected by 
rain, when the nodes will use the standard version of 
AOMDV and after the nodes are affected by rain when they 
will use the modified version of AOMDV, the calculation of 
total energy has been done during the simulation periods for 
each cases before and after the nodes affected by rain. 
The total energy consumed has been calculated for all 
nodes before and after the nodes were affected by rain for the 
three simulations. In addition, we calculated the rate of 
decrease in consumed energy before and after the nodes are 
affected by rain.

Tables VII and VIII clearly show that of consumption energy 
for affected nodes before is greater than energy consumption 
after rainfall starts. As we can see from the ‘Total’ columns 
in both tables, the total energy consumed decreases for all 
the nodes and the decrease in energy is much greater for the 
nodes affected by rainfall. The idle energy, transmission 
energy as well received energy decreases for all the nodes. 
The largest decrease in total energy is due to the decrease in 
transmission energy.

We calculate total energy consumed by all the nodes that 
are affected by rainfall. 
The total energy for node (k) = 
The total energy for all affected nodes = 
We calculated the total consumed energy for all affected 
nodes before rains as =    T-energy-before = 337727894.70 
And total consumed energy for all affected nodes after 
rains =       T-energy-after = 224066589.63 
Therefore the consumed energy decreasing rate = (T-
energy-before/ T-energy-after) % 
Rate of decrease in Consumed energy (affected nodes) = 
51% 
We can clearly observe that the energy consumptions for all 
nodes affected by rain has decreased sharply as shown in 
Figure 11, also the energy consumptions on all nodes has 
decreased. 
The above figure is showing energy consumption by 5 nodes 
before and after they are affected by rain. Again our 
modified AOMDV clearly outperforms the standard 
AOMDV in terms of energy consumption.

CONCLUSIONS
 This paper outlined design, deployment and evaluation of 
our reactive, robust and enhanced version of AOMDV 
protocol. Our event driven enhancements mean that our 
protocol not only increases the performance but also makes it 
energy efficient as the energy consumption is considerably 
reduced for the nodes experiencing the rainfall and also in 
general because we use the sleep mode when it is not raining. 
We also successfully showed in simulation results that our 
enhanced AOMDV protocol is scalable. We compared its 
performance with prior AOMDV protocol. For our proposed 
protocol the results clearly show that it reduces average 
delay while at the same time increases the throughput of the 
nodes being affected by rain. The enhanced throughput and 
low delay clearly indicates that the proposed changes to 
AOMDV to support events such as rain would be a 
significant and meaningful addition to AOMDV, which can 
be used in several WSN applications.
