Abstract—In order to achieve underwater acoustic high data-
rate and real time communications, it is essential to implement 
a system that operates both at high and wideband frequencies 
using digital modulations. Therefore, to reduce the time and 
cost of developing acoustic communications an emulator of a 
physical layer model was implemented, allowing to test in real 
time the performance of digital modulations. The model was 
composed of an emitter transducer, a hydrophone and the 
subaquatic 
medium 
and 
was 
integrated 
in 
a 
Field 
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) in order to emulate the 
physical layer in the acoustic modem testing. The emitter 
transducer and the hydrophone models were designed to meet 
real prototype characteristics. The system prototype was 
implemented in order to compare the experimental trials 
results with those obtained in emulator, emulating the 
transmission of acoustic signals, using different types of digital 
modulations.  The system was tested using Binary Phase-Shift 
Keying (BPSK), Binary Frequency Shift keying (BFSK) and 
Binary Amplitude Shift Keying (BASK) modulations with a 1 
MHz carrier frequency resulting in a data rate of 125 kbps. It 
was verified that the implemented model represents a suitable 
approximation to the real subaquatic communication channel, 
allowing the evaluation of digital acoustic communications.

 INTRODUCTION 
Underwater wireless communications are a decisive 
technology for underwater sensor networks, divers and 
submarine communications, robotics and Autonomous 
Underwater Vehicle (AUVs) navigation and control. 
Therefore, it is imperative to find reliable solutions, able 
to fulfill all these needs. There are three main forms to 
communicate through water: acoustic, radio frequency and 
optical [1]. Radio frequency is limited by the high level of 
absorption in water [2]. Optical systems suffer from the same 
limitation as well as the disadvantages associated to the high 
levels of ambient light close to the water surface and 
scattering due to suspended particles [3]. As a result, 
acoustic communication systems are the preferential form of 
wireless underwater communications, since they show low 
sound attenuation in water [4]. Acoustic communications 
have been used for long distance communications, up to 20 
km, and in deep waters with stable thermal conditions. But, 
despite underwater wireless communications having shown 
strong advances in recent years, there are still many 
limitations concerning data rates and robustness for real-time 
applications [5]. 
There are several solutions to increase the modulation 
efficiency or data rate. The most used solutions are: 
increasing the carrier frequency [6] or increasing the symbol 
rate per carrier period [7]. 
High frequencies also raise strong problems related to 
attenuation. Being directly related to the frequency, the 
acoustic absorption at 1 MHz can reach 280 dB/km [13]. 
Consequently, the maximum communication range decreases 
dramatically to a few hundred meters or less with the 
increasing of frequency [8]. On the other hand, real time 
acoustic communications are not supported at long distances, 
since acoustic waves propagate at around 1500 m/s, resulting 
in high propagation delays and disabling, therefore, any real 
time connection [8]. Therefore, high data rate transmissions 
are only reliable for short and medium distances. 
There are works showing that it is possible to use 
frequencies up to 1 MHz to achieve high data rate acoustic 
communications. For example, in [9] the authors presented 
an acoustic FPGA based on a modem operating at 
frequencies between 100 kHz and 1 MHz, for distances 
ranging between 50 m and 100 m. Using a BPSK modulation 
with a 800 kHz carrier frequency, the system archived a 80 
kbps data rate.  
In the previous work the authors presented an underwater 
low power acoustic modem to operate over tens of meters, 
achieving a maximum data rate of 1 Mbps using carriers up 
to 1 MHz [10] [11]. 
However, the development of acoustic technology for 
underwater applications consumes high amounts of time and 
resources. Therefore, the proposed emulator allows a rapid 
development and test of acoustic modems. Allowing in the 
test digital modulations performance before implementing in 
a field, helping in the selection the most reliable solutions 
reducing the development time and cost. To do so, it was 
necessary to implement a communication system composed 
by 
an 
emitter 
transducer, 
a 
hydrophone 
and 
the 
corresponding conditioning electronics to experimentally 
validate the emulator results. The underwater channel model 
was implemented and tested in shallow waters, including 
MHz 
frequency 
range, 
directional 
spreading 
type, 
attenuation, ambient noise, Doppler Effect, propagation 
delay and multipath. To complete the system it was 
necessary 
to 
implement 
a 
model 
for 
piezoelectric

transducers. The selected emitter was a homemade Piston 
type transducer for a directional beam. The hydrophone was 
a commercial transducer Cetacean ResearchTM C304XR 
with linear response (±3dB) for a frequency range between 
0.012 and 1000 kHz [12]. 
In Section 2, a small physical proprieties background of 
the underwater acoustic channel and ultrasonic transducer is 
introduced. In Section 3, the experimental setup is presented 
and, in Section 4, the physical layer emulator implementation 
is described. Section 5, present the results of the emulator 
model evaluation and the comparisons with real trials. 
Finally, in Section 6, conclusions and future work are 
presented. 
II. 
PHYSICAL LAYER BACKGROUD 
The underwater acoustic communication physical layer is 
composed by the emitter ultrasonic transducer, hydrophone 
and the subaquatic medium. To allow a better understanding 
of the underwater acoustics, this section will present the 
physics background of the ultrasonic transducer and 
subaquatic medium. 
A. Underwater Acoustic Channel 
Despite the advantages of acoustic communication in 
underwater environments, when compared to optical and 
radio, the propagation of sound also has significant 
challenges that influence the development of underwater 
acoustic communication systems. This is mainly due to the 
slow speed of acoustic propagation in water (about 1500 
m/s). When studying sound propagation in the underwater 
acoustic channel, some relevant phenomena must be taken 
into account: attenuation, ambient noise, Doppler Effect, 
propagation delay and multipath [8]. 
B. Ultrasonic transducers 
The ultrasonic transducers are commonly made using 
piezoelectric materials, because they present good response 
to high frequencies. The ultrasonic transducers convert the 
electric energy into sound and vice versa [13]. Therefore, to 
implement an ultrasonic transducer model it is necessary to 
comprehend piezoelectric material response and behavior. 
There are several factors that influence the transducer 
performance, namely the structural damping, acoustic 
impedance mismatch and electrical damping [14]. Structural 
damping is due to the energy dissipation and reaction time in 
the geometrical deformations of the transducer when the 
electrical field is applied. The acoustic impedance mismatch, 
between the transducer and the medium, causes acoustic 
waves to be reflected back to transducer. The resonance 
transducers are designed to overcome this fact, since the 
internal acoustic waves are synchronized with the electrical 
drive signal, causing an addition of the two signals and 
therefore increasing the output. Electrical damping is due to 
transducer capacitor effects which result in a time lag 
between the application of the electrical signal and the 
transducer response. However, this effect can be corrected by 
implement an impedance matching circuit, therefore this 
matter will not be addressed in this document. 
Piezoelectric ultrasound transducers, at high frequencies, 
usually operate in the 33 mode, that is, the deformation along 
the polarization axis and the excitation electric field point 
into the same direction. Consequently, in this work, it will 
only be addressed the piston type transducer operating in 
thickness mode. The free displacement of the material in 
direction 3, without restraining force and assuming uniform 
strain over the surface [14], is given by: 
  nvd33
 
 
 
 (1) 
where ξ is the free displacement, v is the applied voltage, 
d33 is the coupling coefficient in the thickness direction and n 
is the number of layers.  
The displacement is also dependent on the stress and 
strain of the viscoelasticity of the piezoelectric material, 
resulting in a structural damping. When an electric field is 
applied to the polymer charged particles, they move inside 
the actuator to align the charges. In this process, some of the 
energy is dissipated and the reaction time is also affected. 
The final displacement for a piezoelectric stack transducer, 
operating in the 33 mode, can be written as a function of the 
nondimensional frequency [14]:

Another important aspect is related to the transducer 
acoustic impedance. The sound wave created inside the 
transducer reflects, in part, at the boundary established by 
different densities and bulk modulus B of the transducers and 
the medium according to the Snell’s law [15]. This reflection 
creates deformations on the acoustic signal transmitted to the 
medium [13], which can be calculated by:

III. 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
In order to achieve high data-rate communications, it was 
essential to implement a system prototype that operates at 
high frequencies (up to 1 MHz). The acoustic system was 
designed to be reconfigurable and reprogrammable, over 
dimensioning all parts of the system allowing future 
upgrades. 
A. Acoustic Modem 
In order to design an acoustic modem capable of 
performing several types of digital modulations, a highly 
adaptable system was developed.  
The acoustic modem was implemented in a Xilinx 
Spartan-3A, which is responsible for modulation and 
demodulation, control of the receiver instrumentation and 
output amplifiers. The system runs with an external clock of 
50 MHz. The receiver is composed in this order by 100kHz 
High Pass Filter, which removes all the low frequency 
noises, a variable gain control amplifier, from -22 to 20 dB, a 
Antialiasing filter and an ADC AD9244. To driver signals at 
the output of the FPGA modulator a DAC DAC904 and a 
Class B Push-Pull symmetric voltage amplifier were 
implemented with a of 12 dB gain. The ultrasonic emitter 
was a homemade PZT-5H 2 mm piston type transducer with 
2 cm diameter [16]. Despite the transducer’s directionality, a 
residual pressure wave projected in the transducer rear can 
achieve 15% of the main front pressure wave amplitude. The 
ultrasonic receptor used to register the pressure waves was 
the Cetacean ResearchTM C304XR hydrophone, with a 
transducer sensibility of -201 dB, re 1 V/µPa and a linear 
Frequency Range (±3dB) of 0.012–1000 kHz. The filter 
block consists of a 2nd order band-pass filter from 0.001 to 2 
MHz with a gain in the pass band of 6dB. The digital 
oscilloscope used to record the measurements was a 
PicoScope 4227 100 MHz. 
IV. 
PHYSICAL LAYER EMULATION SYSTEM 
The physical layer emulator allows testing the acoustic 
modem 
performance 
for 
different 
types 
of 
digital 
modulations without physical implementation. This process 
reduces the cost and time spent. The emulator consists in a 
computer model for all physical layers blocks to be 
integrated in the FPGA program. Therefore the FPGA, in 
addition to modulate and demodulate functions, still 
emulates the acoustic modem electronics and the subaquatic 
medium, as presented in Figure 1. 
The modulator and demodulator were implemented 
according to the selected type of modulation: BPSK, BFSK 
and BASK. Since, the emulator model was implemented in a 
discrete algorithm (Z-Transform), it was not necessary to 
implement the analog to digital and digital to analog 
converters (ADC and DAC) blocks.

Figure 1. Physical layer emulation blocks. 
The algorithm is divided in three parts: the electronics 
model, the transducer and channel model. The electronics 
model is a fixed model where is not necessary to define any 
variables, since electronics circuits model (instrumentation 
and power amplifier) were implemented using digital filters 
according to the correspondent transfer function available in 
each component datasheet. The transducer and the channel 
model are user defined models where is necessary to define 
the system variables such as: transducer characteristics 
(mechanical 
and 
electrical 
characteristic), 
medium 
characteristics (temperature, salinity, acidity, shipping factor 
and wind speed) and the scenario setup (dimensions, 
hydrophone position, emitter position, reference distance, 
hydrophone and emitter velocity relative to the medium). 
V. 
RESULTS 
This section shows the results obtained in the 
experimental tests in order to compare them with those 
obtained by the emulator.  
The experimental analysis tested the attenuation, 
multipath and transducer response to digital modulations. 
The Doppler Effect and noise was discarded. This decision 
was justified by the great difficulty in assembling an 
experimental setup with moving parts in the medium and at 1 
MHz the underwater environment is relatively silent. 
A. Attenuation 
The swimming pool was 12 m long, 4 m wide and 3 m 
deep. Four test distances were defined: 1, 4, 8 and 12 m, 
where measurements were performed at 50 cm deep and in 
the middle of the pool (2 m either side). At each distance, 
several frequencies were tested: 100 kHz, 200 kHz, 300 kHz, 
400 kHz, 500 kHz, 600 kHz, 700 kHz, 800 kHz, 900 kHz, 1 
MHz, 1.2 MHz and 1.4 MHz. 
The simulation was configured with the conditions 
observed in the experimental tests, with fresh water at a 
temperature of 13 ºC and 7.2 pH.

The projector and the hydrophone sound wave level 
responses are irrelevant since the considered results are 
relative. A reference measurement was taken at 10 cm 
intervals over several distances for all the tested frequencies 
and attenuation, and calculated according to the following 
equation: 




(7) 
where p is the value of the pressure wave at the receiver 
and the pref is the value of the pressure wave at the reference 
distance. The experimental values are presented as an 
average of 10 measurements, with a maximum error of 
3.5%.´ 
Figure 2 shows that attenuation increases with the 
increasing distance. The 1 MHz point shows a low 
attenuation peak in all the curves that gets smoother with the 
increasing distance. This fact is related to the emitter optimal 
frequency (resonance point). Moreover, attenuation does not 
increase with the increasing frequency as the beam 
divergence angle decreases with frequency.

Figure 3. Emulatior attenuation results as a function of frequency. 
The difference between the experimental and the 
simulated results assumes an average of 3.2 dB reaching a 6 
dB peak. This difference occurs because the used model was 
developed for a range of kilometers rather than meters and 
the low attenuation peak at 1 MHz in all the graphics is due 
to the transducer optimal operational frequency. 
B. Multipath 
The multipath performance was also evaluated in the 
pool were a burst signal of 20 cycles at 1 MHz, over a 
distance of 12 m was transmitted. The ultrasonic emitter and 
hydrophone positions were (0.03; 1.95; 0.5) and (11.61; 
1.95; 0.5) meters. At this frequency, both the emitter and the 
hydrophone operate in a directional pattern.

configuration.

Figure 4 also shows three sets of signals. At 1 MHz the 
transducer was operating in a directional pattern with a 
divergence angle of 4.3º and, therefore, only the back and 
front echoes appear in the results. 
The first set is from the direct path, the second is from 
the back echo and the third is from the front echo. The back 
eco has lower amplitude than the front echo, despite 
traveling a shorter distance. This is due as the back echo 
results from a residual energy loss in the rear part of the 
transducer.

The emulator achieves a good approximation to the real-
world case, with similar phase and amplitude distortion, 
despite the simulation only including the 1st order echoes. 
C. Transducers response to digital modulation 
 
In order to evaluate the performance of ultrasound 
transducers, 
using 
digital 
modulations, 
fundamental 
modulations such as BPSK, BFSK and BASK were 
considered [17]. The carrier frequency was set to 1 MHz 
with a 125 kbps baud rate. 
Figures 6, 7 and 8 show the transducer’s behavior to the 
BPSK, BFSK and BASK modulations, respectively. Each 
figure shows the modulation signal, the FPGA emulation 
and the real test signal. 
Figure 6c shows the BPSK modulation, where the 180º 
phase shift corresponds to the logic level transition. The PZT 
transducer shows a high damping effect duo to the energy 
stored inside the transducer. In the moment of phase shit the 
two signals try to cancel one another.  
In the BFSK drive signal of Figure 7 the high logic level 
‘1’ and the low logic level ‘0’ were modulated with carriers 
of 1 MHz and 500 kHz, respectively. In the FSK 
modulation, the carrier frequencies are usually adopted with 
close values, but, in order to simplify the evaluation, the 
option of using two very distinct frequencies was taken. The 
500 kHz frequency is highly attenuated due to two factors, 
the first is that the transducer acoustic output is proportional 
to the frequency, resulting in half amplitude and, the second 
is that the transducer was projected to operate at maximum 
optimization point at 1 MHz.   
In the BASK, the low logic level was set to half of the 
high logic level amplitude, as presented in figure 8a. Similar 
to the BFSK test, the transducer shows also a high damping 
effect resulting in slow amplitude variations. 
Comparing Figures 6b, 7b and 8b with the Figures 6c, 7c 
and 8c it is possible to observe the similarity between 
emulations and real tests, confirming the suitability of the 
developed model. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
A physical layer FPGA based emulator for underwater 
acoustic communications was developed. The model was 
designed specifically to emulate the acoustic channel and 
ultrasonic transducers, allowing performance evaluation for 
of 
the 
ultrasound 
communications 
using 
digital 
modulations.  
The acoustic underwater communication channel model 
was taking into account several phenomena: attenuation, 
multipath, environment noise and propagation delay. Real 
tests were also implemented to validate the attenuation, 
multipath and propagation delay.  
The transducer models, using digital modulations, were 
simulated and validated with real tests. The results show 
that the transducer models present a similar response to real 
tests.  
Overall, the results show that the model represents a 
useful approximation to the real subaquatic communication 
channel, being therefore an important tool to simulate the 
propagation of acoustic signals. 
In future works, we will implement and test a 
communication using Frequency Division Multiplexing 
(FDM) modulations in order to achieve data rates in the 
order of 1.5 to 2 Mbps.
