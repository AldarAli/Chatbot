Abstract—In text messaging via smartphone, many users feel 
pressure to rapidly exchange messages. This study investigates 
reply speeds in smartphone messaging, focusing on messaging 
with read receipt functionality. This function allows the sender 
to see when a recipient has read a sent message. Using a 
questionnaire completed by 213 female college students in 
Japan, we investigate the time before negative emotions are felt 
while waiting for a reply. Results showed negative emotions 
arise in significantly less time when waiting for a reply to a 
read message than an unread one. 
Keywords—reply speed; read receipt function; emotion; text 
messaging. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
People looking at their phones while walking are now a 
common sight on the street and in train stations [1]. 
Although they do so for a variety of reasons, it seems that 
many are texting while walking in order to quickly reply to 
received messages [2]. In text messaging with mobile phones 
and smartphones, many users feel pressure to rapidly reply 
[3]. However, there are few studies examining response 
speed in text-based communication. To clarify demands for 
rapid responses in text messaging, this study investigates 
reply speeds in messaging via smartphones and assesses the 
time before negative emotions arise while waiting for a reply. 
In text-based communication such as conventional email, 
there is no interaction while a message sender waits for a 
reply. However, messaging apps such as Facebook 
Messenger and LINE have read receipt functions, which 
notify senders when recipients have read a sent message, 
allowing senders to know that recipients have read the 
message before any reply arrives [4]. In such exchanges, 
many senders are concerned not only about the time spent 
waiting for a reply, but also about the time until the read 
receipt appears [4]. For example, the sender may suspect that 
the recipient is ignoring the message if the read receipt is not 
displayed after an extended time (“ignored unread”), or if no 
reply is received long after the read receipt has been 
displayed (“ignored read”). Conversely, recipients may 
worry about being misunderstood for leaving messages in an 
“ignored unread” state when they cannot read messages 
immediately, or in an “ignored read” state when unable to 
immediately reply to read messages. We hypothesize that 
read receipt functions are strongly associated with interaction 
speed. Therefore, this study focuses on relations between this 
display function (which does not exist in conventional 
mobile phone messaging or email) and requirements for 
response speed. 
The study used a questionnaire survey to investigate the 
time before negative emotions occur while waiting for a 
reply in text messaging on smartphones. This covered 
messaging with  read receipt functionality, such as Facebook 
Messenger and LINE, and wait times were categorized as 
read status or unread status. The questionnaire focused on 
four representative negative emotions often mentioned in 
interpersonal communication research: sadness, anxiety, 
anger, and guilt. We recognized that a variety of additional 
factors are likely involved, such as message content and 
context, but as it is difficult to conduct a survey that covers 
all possible factors, we focused on two kinds of message 
recipients: friendships [5] and family relationships [6]. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, 
we present method of this study. In Section 3, we present 
results of this study. Finally, we conclude in Section 4.

METHOD 
Survey participants were 213 Japanese female students 
(mean age = 18.67; SD = 0.94; age range, 18–22 years) at 
universities in the Tokyo area. The participants in this survey 
were limited to young women, because young women are 
more inclined to maintain human relationships through text 
messaging, and prefer and use messaging more than do men 
(e.g., [7]). All participants possessed their own smartphone 
and regularly used text messaging applications with read 
receipt functionality. Participation in this survey was 
voluntary. This survey was conducted in July of 2017. 
Participants 
were 
asked 
to 
answer 
a 
paper-based 
questionnaire.  
The questionnaire asked “At noon, you send a text 
message to two recipients (family and relatives and friends), 
from whom you expect a response. Once sent, the message is 
immediately displayed as read. While waiting for a response, 
how long will it take for each of the four negative emotions 
to arise in you? How long would it take for each of the four 
negative emotions to arise if the message remained unread?” 
Each questionnaire item was answered using ten times of 
day: 1 = Until 13:00, 2 = Until 15:00, 3 = Until 17:00, 4 =

Until 19:00, 5 = Until 21:00, 6 = Until 23:00, 7 = Until 01:00, 
8 = Until the next morning, 9 = Until noon the next day, 10 = 
Later than noon the next day. Each of the four negative 
emotions and each of the two recipient types were measured. 
Because answers are provided on an ordinal scale, the 
resulting data are subject to nonparametric analyses.

RESULTS 
To compare time before each emotion occurs while 
waiting for a reply from recipients in read and unread 
statuses, we conducted the Wilcoxon signed-rank test using 
time-zone option responses for each of the two recipients and 
for each of the four negative emotions. Results indicated 
significant differences between read and unread status for 
each recipient and for each negative emotion. Table 1 shows 
the times before each of the four emotions occur while 
waiting for a reply from each of two recipients in read and 
unread status. We regarded the period from option 1 to 7 as 
“the same day as the message was sent” by considering 
option 7 (until 01:00) to mean the same thing as “by 
bedtime.” The main results were the following three points: 
1) For both recipient types, negative emotions arise in 
significantly less time when waiting for a reply to a read 
status message than one with an unread status. (Though only 
a marginal difference in occurrence of guilt when waiting for 
a reply from family and relatives). 2) When messages are in 
read status, anxiety occurs when no reply arrives from family 
and relatives on the same day. 3) When a message is in 
unread status, anxiety occurs when no reply arrives from 
family and relatives on the same day. 
To find differences between sadness, anxiety, anger, and 
guilt with respect to the time before these four negative 
emotions occur while waiting for a reply from each of the 
recipients in each of the statuses, we conducted multiple 
comparisons among these emotions for each condition of the 
two recipients × the two statuses. The main results were the 
following four points: 1) Anxiety arises in significantly less 
time than does sadness (p < 0.001), anger (p < 0.001), or 
guilt (p < 0.001) when waiting for a reply from family and 
relatives for both read and unread statuses. 2) Anger arises 
in significantly less time than does guilt (p < 0.001) when 
waiting for a reply from only family and relatives for both 
read and unread status. 3) There is no significant difference 
between sadness and anger in the time before these emotions 
occur while waiting for a reply from only family and 
relatives for both read and unread statuses. 4) There is no 
significant difference between anxiety and sadness in the 
time before these two emotions occur while waiting for a 
reply from only friends for read status. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The study clarified that sadness, anxiety, anger, and guilt 
arise in significantly less time when waiting for a reply to  a 
read status than an unread status from all recipients. That is, 
senders experience negative emotions when they do not 
receive replies from recipients who were able to read the 
sender’s message. Among the four emotions, anxiety and 
sadness tend to occur early, while anger and guilt tend to 
take longer. We observed that when waiting for a reply from 
family and relatives, anxiety occurred in a shorter time in 
both read and unread status. Relationships with family are 
more intimate than friends, so senders may be more prone to 
worry about accidents or illness when messages remain 
unread for a long period, resulting in faster experience of 
anxiety. There is also likely a strong emotional dependence 
of young people on their families. Late replies may therefore 
more easily lead to anger and subsequently to anxiety. We 
also found that when waiting for a reply from friends, 
sadness occurred more quickly in the read status. While 
family relationships are strong, friendships may be relatively 
fragile [8], and the ending or erosion of such relationships 
results in sadness. Senders may interpret a lack of reply as 
indication of a decline in recipients’ interest in them, 
resulting in a faster experience of sadness. 
In future work we will gather scenes in which users 
intentionally manipulate reply speeds and analyze them in 
detail. In addition, this study solely surveyed young Japanese 
women. To generalize the results obtained in this study, we 
should examine the influence of differences in gender, 
culture, and generation.
