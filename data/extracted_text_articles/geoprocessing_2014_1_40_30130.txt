Abstract - The city densification and, consequently, the 
potential polluting activities have increased significantly in the 
last decades, compromising the air quality. Thus, it is 
necessary to know this scenery to model the pollution behavior 
and its respective pattern in each region of the Federal District. 
So, the main goal of this study was to analyze the Aerosol 
product available by National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) at the Moderate Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor (TERRA).  With these 
preexisting data, it was possible to analyze the aerosol (AOD) 
distribution from 2010 and the optical depth. These data were 
integrated to the processed values of Total Particles in 
Suspension (PTS) of the eight air quality monitoring stations 
variably distributed in the Federal District, with two of them 
(714 
south 
and 
HUB) 
kept 
and 
managed 
by 
the 
Interdisciplinary Center of Transport Studies (Centro 
Interdisciplinar de Estudos em Transportes - Ceftru/UnB), 
correlating the month of October 2010. The study showed that 
the region of Brasília downtown and the surroundings of the 
Fercal region, overall, were the ones that kept most of the 
Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and the highest values of the 
Angström Exponent (AE), which can be attributed to the types 
of activities performed in these regions.  
Keywords: Aerosol. Optical Depth. Air pollution. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The atmospheric pollution has become one of the most 
frequent topics on big discussions, showing that the resulting 
environmental impact is the biggest cause of the damages 
reflected on human health, ecosystems and materials. 
The large urban centers progressively densify the 
population, supporting the intensification of anthropic 
activities. The emergence of industrial activities, the growth 
of vehicle fleets, fire, green areas devastation and 
deforestation, increasingly, damage the air quality.   
The Federal District has, nowadays, a fleet of 1.321.552 
motor vehicles [1]. The industries, represented by asphalt, 
cement, furniture, beverage, roasting and tire retread 
factories, also contribute with the emissions, but in smaller 
scale.  
The Air Quality in the Federal District monitored by the 
Brasília Environmental Institute [3], which monitors 6 
stations (Taguatinga, Rodoviária, Fercal I and II, CIPLAN 
and Queima Lençol), and the Interdisciplinary Center of 
Transport Studies (Centro Interdisciplinar de Estudos em 
Transportes - Ceftru/UnB) is in charge of 2 stations (714 
south and HUB). The stations are fixed and only 3 
parameters are quantified - out of 7 established by law [2]: 
Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Total Particles in Suspension (PTS) 
and Smoke. 
The monitored locations are considered critical sites, due 
to the intense motor vehicle traffic or to the existence of 
large cement factories. Both sources contribute to the high 
emission of elevated concentration of gaseous and particulate 
pollutants, which can be measured quantitatively at 
monitoring stations [3]. 
On previous studies about aerosol [4], it was shown that 
satellite data have been used to give information about air 
quality. The AOD can be analyzed by utilizing data from the 
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 
sensor, which is an effective way to monitor and study the 
aerosol distribution and its effects along time, considering 
that the passing period is 1-2 days.  
Therefore, this study’s purpose is to analyze the data to 
set up a multitemporal prospect of the aerosol behavior in the 
Federal District, from preexisting data of the Moderate 
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor 
name TERRA. 
II. 
OBJECTIVES 
The general objective of this study is to analyze the 
aerosol distribution in the Federal District between 2004 and 
2013 using remote sensing techniques and geoprocessing. 
Therefore, the specific objectives are: 
• To correlate the data obtained from the Air Monitoring 
Stations of the Federal District with the Aerosol product 
from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 
MODIS sensor (TERRA) in the specific date collected from 
the stations; 
• Multitemporal analysis (2004 to 2013) of the AE, which 
is the spectral dependency measure of the AOD.

III. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The aerosol measurement in the Federal District does not 
exist (Figure 1). It is often limited to in situ analysis of Total 
Particles in Suspension (PTS) at the 8 air quality monitoring 
stations, and the information from the data are restricted to 
certain places. 
 
Figure 1. Location of the study area and the stations monitoring air 
quality. 
 
The operating algorithm of the NASA (National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration) corresponds to the 
collection of aerosols group 5.1 (AQUA/TERRA Forward 
and Reprocessing) and provides for each pass daily files with 
values of the aerosol optical depth with spatial resolution of 
10 km x 10 km over the ocean and the land [5]. 
Because of this limitation, to acquire the aerosol scenario 
in large scale encompassing the entire Federal District 
region, data from the MODIS’s AERONET (Aerosol 
Robotic Network) [6] program is a federation of ground-
based remote sensing aerosol networks established by NASA 
and 
PHOTONS 
(PHOtométrie 
pour 
le 
Traitement 
Opérationnel de Normalisation Satellitaire), ollaboration 
provides globally distributed observations of spectral aerosol 
optical depth (AOD), inversion products, and precipitable 
water in diverse aerosol regimes. Aerosol optical depth data 
are computed for three data quality levels: Level 1.0 
(unscreened), Level 1.5 (cloud-screened), and Level 2.0 
(cloud-screened 
and 
quality-assured). 
Inversions, 
precipitable water, and other AOD-dependent products are 
derived from these levels and may implement additional 
quality checks.  Were selected (2003 to 2011), as it contains 
36 bands, and the bands 1-2, 3-7 and 8-36 have special 
resolution of 250m, 500m and 1 km, respectively. 
The data about aerosols were obtained from MODIS 
level 2, in type .hdf at NASA portal, at level 1 and 
atmospheric products data section, and are already processed 
and corrected. The date of the datum, the location, the period 
it was collected (day, night or both) and to which library it 
belongs (in this case, the choice was “Collection 5.1”, which 
had all the data for the chosen time interval) are selected.  
For this study, from 2010, daytime data was chosen, 
because the possible vectors with polluting potential have 
regular activity in this period. There were attempts to acquire 
products fortnightly, but it was concluded that there was not 
product available in the region in every pre-established date, 
so the acquisition was made in variable dates close to the 
interval pre-established.  
In order to standardise the comparison of ground-based 
[7] observations with instant satellite-observed data at a 
given moment, the apparent reflectance and surface 
reflectance within an area of 10 km by 10 km centered at the 
Federal District observation station were averaged. Similarly, 
the ground-based data recorded within half an hour of the 
satellite overpass on cloud-free days were also averaged to 
derive AOD at the 550 nm wavelength using the Angström 
formula for validating satellite-based results [11]. 
AOD values from the high-resolution product land the 
standard Collection 5 AOD algorithm were compared to 
observed Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) values at three 
coastal Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). 
These data has the nomenclature with the Julian data, 
specified as follow:

At the processing of level 2 final data, the following 
softwares were used: ENVI (Plugin MODIS Conversion 
Toolkit (MCTK)), which is a module and does the

The first 19 bands are positioned in the region of the 
spectrum eletroradiometric situated between 405 nm and 
2155 nm, so that the bands are 1-7 targeted for terrestrial 
applications; bands 8-16 for ocean observations and bands 
17-19 for atmospheric measurements [12].  
The sampled pixel has a 10 km spatial resolution, 
because data with smaller spatial resolution (ex: 250 m) were 
not available for the region. The histogram was assembled 
on ArcMap and the graphic maps of the above described 
items were made available. 
The Interdisciplinary Center of Transport Studies (Centro 
Interdisciplinar de Estudos em Transportes - Ceftru/UnB) 
provided the spread sheets with the data of the Air Quality 
Monitoring Stations from the 8 stations located in the 
Federal District.  
The shapefiles of the Census Sector 2010 [9] were used 
to verify the influence of the urban areas on the distribution 
of aerosol at the regions of the Federal District, Hydrography 
and Road System, from Real Estate Company of Brasília 
(Terracap) origin (2010) for region localization reference.  
All provided and generated data can be found in UTM 
SIRGAS 2000 (Geocentric Reference System for the 
Americas), zone 23 south. 
 
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
From 2003 to 2009, there was not daily accurate 
information that could be correlated with the data from the 
MODIS aerosol product. However, the Ceftru collected 
significative data for the year 2010, from the 8 stations, from 
which two close dates were selected, when there were data 
about aerosol in the Federal District area (10/04/2010 and 
10/14/2010), during rainy season; there were not data 
production during the dry season (Tables I and II). 
 
TABLE I – TOTAL PARTICLES IN SUSPENSION ON 04/10/2010. 
 
On the data shown for these days, the average standard of 
AOD is below 0,5 μm. Figures 11 and 16 show the level of 
particle size variability that is affected by the sum of the 
types of activities in the Federal District. There are many 
activities that can influence a region, where a pollution with 
different particle sizes will arise. The result of the AE points 
the difference between the values of AE for the dry and rainy 
seasons. Previous studies [6] mention that the tendency is 
that during the rainy season, the value can be up to 1 μm, in 
the case of the analyzed dates, varying from 1,35 μm to 1,92 
μm, which means that the type of aerosol is compound of 
thin particle. Usually, on a rainy day, the aerosol goes down 
to the ground surface, due to the entrainment by the water 
drop. 
On 10/04/2010, the data from the air quality monitoring 
stations show a substantial particle concentration at the 
CIPLAN station (1.250,06 μg/m³), where the AE is 1,92 μm 
(Table I and Figure 6). It is known that the higher its value, 
the bigger the spectral dependency, which means bigger 
optical depth variation with the wavelength; in other words, 
the AE is related to the medium size of the aerosol particles 
on the atmospheric column, since smaller particles has 
bigger spectral dependency that larger ones.  
Some studies [4] in the dry season also showed that soil 
dust from agricultural land un-vegetated being great source 
of aerosols in regions with arid characteristics. AOD is 
closely related to the topography [10], suggesting that a 
significant inverse correlation exists between them. AOD is 
significantly lower in high-altitude areas. Conversely. 
anthropogenic activities produce large amounts of fine 
aerosol particles in densely populated urban areas. However, 
airborne dust originating from traffic and construction 
activities in urban areas, in addition to larger particle sizes of 
soot aerosols produced by industrial and civil coal fuel 
combustion cause coarse-mode aerosols.

The particles originated in this region activities are 
usually from mechanical and chemical processes. The latter 
are, generally, smaller, unlike the ones made during the 
production of dust by the cement factories. So, the AE is also 
often used as an indicative of regions where aerosols of 
different types are predominant, originated from several 
processes.  
The same situation happens at the Taguatinga station, 
where there is a large urban center that produces aerosols 
resulting from chemical processes like engine combustion. 
The AE value is 1,35 μm (Figures 6 and 10), and reduces to 
0,52 μm on 10/14/2010, which presents in the zone of 
aerosol made by thin particles, with less spectral 
dependency.   
This tendency to smaller values can be linked to a station 
where there is a “renovation” of the air column because of 
rain and wind, decreasing the values for regions with an 
expected polluting potential. Both dates show similar 
scenarios, without a very significative variation of the data of 
optical depth and AE. Only the spatial distribution of the 
datum varied.  
 Similar fact happened to the mass concentration 
parameter, which is the aerosol column on the atmosphere. It 
varied up to 1,35 μm on 10/14/2010, and also the spatial 
distribution in the region varied. 
The figures (Figures 4, 6, 8 and 10) below show the AOD 
and AE for the dates of 04/10/2010 and 14/10/2010, which 
could be directly correlated with the existing data in fixed 
stations stations.

Figure 13. AE – Dry Season (only data MODIS) (2010). 
 
Overall, during the dry season, the large particles 
stayed on the atmosphere longer than during the rainy 
season, because during the drought there is no process of 
“rinsing” the air, proving in most parts of the analysis that, 
by the distribution of the value of the AE in the region, the 
pixel average value was ≤ 0,5, which is equivalent to larger 
particle sizes.  
The downtown area of Brasília and the surrounding of 
the Fercal area, in general, were the ones in the scenario that 
maintained most part of the concentration of AOD and the 
highest values of the AE, along the years. It can be 
attributed to the types of activities existing in these regions. 
Taguatinga showed a smaller variation of the AE and bigger 
AOD variations in some dry season situations. 
The lack of more recent data (from year 2011) 
prevented subsequent correlation to aerosol data from 
MODIS with ground stations (the stations are government 
and have no more maintenance). 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The range of the AE analyzed indicates the level of the 
particle variability that can be correlated with the types of 
activities of a specific region.  
The particle sizes in urban areas tend to be larger 
compared to the ones found in natural environments, also 
during drought, when the distribution of the particle sizes 
tends to be more varied. Sand and dust were the main 
sources of AOD in Federal District. 
AOD was affected mainly by human activities and 
showed a slight increasing trend. Anthropogenic activities 
caused the increase of fine mode AOD in most areas. In 
addition, variation in fine mode aerosols dominated the 
yearly fluctuation of AOD, and the main aerosol type shifted 
gradually to the urban industrial type. 
During the rainy season (Figure 12), the particles tend to 
be smaller, with the average AE between 0,5 to 2, while the 
particle size during the dry season (Figure 13) tend to be 
more varied, as mentioned in previous studies [4][5]. 
Overall, the areas with industrial activities are the main 
source of pollution, as well as big urban centers.  
It is noteworthy that more accurate field validations, with 
a larger number of parameters at the existing air monitoring 
stations would make it closer to the reality of the information 
monitored by the MODIS satellite, leading to a safer 
correlation with the final result of an analysis of this kind.  
Lesson learned and indication to future studies with 
radiometers and spectrometers will help understand the 
particles, specifying the pollution type existing in each 
region, thus, enabling to compare which types of sources 
cooperate with the dispersion of aerosol in the Federal 
District. 
In future work we intend to use low-cost sensors in 
mobile devices for increased accuracy in generating data on 
ground level for correlation with data from MODIS.
