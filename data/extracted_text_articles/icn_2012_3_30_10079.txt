I. INTRODUCTION
In applications such as ac voltmeters and ammeters,
signal-polarity detectors, averaging circuits, peak-value de-
tector rectiﬁcation function is of great importance [1]. Be-
cause of the threshold voltage of the diodes, simple passive
rectiﬁers operate inaccurately, if low-voltage signals are
analyzed. Therefore, precision rectiﬁers employing active
elements have to be used.
Probably, the most known precision rectiﬁers are based on
operational ampliﬁers (opamps) [1]. However, because of the
ﬁnite slew-rate and effects caused by diode commutation,
these circuits operate well only at low frequencies [2],
[3]. This problem can be overcome by the use of current
conveyors (CCs), where the diodes are connected to the
high-impedance current outputs of the active elements. In
[4]–[7] the same precision full-wave rectiﬁer is analyzed
(Fig. 2b). It uses two second-generation CCs and four
diodes. To further extend the frequency range the voltage
[4], [7] or current [6], [7] biasing scheme can be used.
Another precision full-wave rectiﬁer is presented in [8] that
is based on the standard opamp rectiﬁer shown in Fig. 2a.
Here, the OPA1 is replaced by the operational conveyor and
later by second-generation CC [3]. A full-wave rectiﬁers
using second-generation and dual-X CCs are presented in [9]
and [10], respectively, where the required diodes are suitably
replaced by NMOS transistors. The use of fully differential
operational transconductance ampliﬁers (BOTA) operating
in weak inversion region for the design of precision full-
wave rectiﬁers is presented in [11], which is based on
the idea discussed in [12], where simple transconductance
ampliﬁers (OTA) are used. Here, the transconductance of
OTA is controlled by the current derived from the input
signal to be rectiﬁed. In another group of precision rectiﬁers,
a transistor connected to the current output of an active
element operates as a switch. For this purpose the current
conveyor [13] or transconductance ampliﬁers [14]–[16] are
used.
In this paper, precision full-wave rectiﬁer employing two
second-generation CCs and two diodes is presented. It is of
minimal conﬁguration and operates in the voltage- or mixed-
mode. Voltage or current biasing scheme can be also used to
extend the frequency operation range. The behavior of the
circuit is compared to the known conveyor based solution
presented in [4]–[7]. Simulation results are given that show
the feasibility of the newly designed circuit to rectify signals
up to 1 MHz and beyond with no or little distortion.
II. CURRENT CONVEYORS
In 1968, the current conveyors were presented for the
ﬁrst time [22], however they did not found any signiﬁcant
usage since the operational ampliﬁers were more attractive at
that time. Current conveyors received considerable attention
after the second (CCII) [23] and later third (CCIII) [24]
generation current conveyors were designed. These elements
are now advantageously used in applications, where the
wide bandwidth or current output response is necessary.
Nowadays, different types of current conveyors are described
that mostly base on the CCII, e.g., CCCII [25], DVCC [26],
or ECCII [27]. The behavior of a four-terminal CCII (Fig. 1)
is described by following equations:
vX = vY,
iY = 0,
iZ+ = iX,
iZ− = −iX.

III. NEW PRECISION FULL-WAVE RECTIFIER
The standard op amp based circuit from Fig. 2a [1] is a
connection of an inverting half-wave rectiﬁer (OPA1) and
summing ampliﬁer (OPA2). For desired full-wave rectiﬁca-
tion following conditions have to be fulﬁlled:
R1 = R2,
R4 = 2R3,

or

which generally means that the half-wave rectiﬁed signal
must be ampliﬁed two times higher than the original input
signal, either more commonly by the summing ampliﬁer
(according to (2a)) or by the half-wave rectiﬁer (according
to (2b)).
A well known circuit topology of the full-wave rectiﬁer
using two second-generation current conveyors and four
diodes is shown in Fig. 2b [4]-[7]. Both CCIIs form a
differential voltage-to-current converter. During the positive
and negative input cycle the output currents make only
the diodes D2, D4 and D1, D3 active, respectively. On the
resistor R2 the output current is converted back to voltage.
The newly proposed structure of the full-wave rectiﬁer is
shown in Fig. 3. Basically, it uses only one current con-
veyor (CCII1) and two diodes. The second current conveyor
operates as a current follower, where the resistors R2 and
R3 connected to the Z-terminals convert the current back to
voltage. Therefore, this full-wave rectiﬁer can operate in the
voltage- or mixed-mode.

Proposed voltage-mode precision full-wave rectiﬁer
The output voltages of the rectiﬁer from Fig. 3 can be
expressed as:
vOUT+(t) = R3
R1
|vIN(t)|,
vOUT−(t) = −R2
R1
|vIN(t)|, (3)
Since the input voltage vIN(t) is directly connected to the
Y-terminal of the CCII1, the input impedance of the rectiﬁer
is inﬁnitely high in theory. Operated in mixed-mode, the
current response is directly sensed at the Z-terminal having
in theory inﬁnitely high output impedance.
IV. DC AND RMS ERROR ANALYSES
To evaluate and compare the accuracy of the voltage-mode
full-wave rectiﬁers from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the DC value
transfer pDC and RMS error pRMS have been analyzed [28]:
pDC =

where the yR(t) and yID(t) represent the actual and ideally
rectiﬁed signal and T is the period of the input signal. The
ideal behavior of the rectiﬁer is characterized by the values
pRMS = 0 and pDC = 1.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
The behavior of the proposed voltage-mode full-wave
rectiﬁer has been compared with the circuit solutions from
Fig. 2. As active elements the universal current conveyor
UCC-N1B have been used. The current and voltage transfer
bandwidths of the UCC are about 35 MHz [29]. Therefore,
in the standard op amp based rectiﬁer the AD8656 has been
used [30]. The diodes are general purpose 1N4148 and all

Transient simulation results of the full-wave rectiﬁers from
Fig. 2a (dotted line), Fig. 2b (dashed line), and Fig. 3 (solid line) for
frequencies 10 kHz and 1 MHz
resistors are 1 kΩ (in Fig. 2a R3 = 500 Ω). In Fig. 4, the
DC transfer characteristics are shown. Due to high voltage
gain of the op amps, the DC error of the circuit from Fig. 2a
is minimized and the DC transfer is almost ideal (in Fig. 4
dotted line). The non-unity voltage and current transfers of
the current conveyors cause higher DC error of the conveyor
based full-wave rectiﬁers (solid and dashed line).
Using (4) the behavior of the proposed rectiﬁer has been
analyzed in frequency domain and compared to the circuit
solution from Fig. 2. The simulation results of the frequency
dependent RMS error and DC value transfer for chosen
values of amplitudes vIN are shown in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b,
where the dotted, dashed, and solid lines stand for the
circuits from Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b, and Fig. 3, respectively. If
the frequency increases and/or amplitude decreases distor-
tions occur and the pDC decreases below one and pRMS
increases. From Fig. 5a, it is evident that the best results are
achieved with the new minimal conﬁguration rectiﬁer. For
an appropriate value of the bias voltage (here VB = 0.65 V),
the conveyor based precision rectiﬁers can operate at higher
frequencies (Fig. 5c, Fig. 5d).
The complete the simulations, for frequencies 10 kHz
and 1 MHz and input amplitude VIN = 300 mV the time-
domain performance of the analyzed rectiﬁers is shown in
Fig. 6 (VB = 0.65 V). Also, one can observe, that at low

frequencies the behavior of the rectiﬁers is nearly the same.
Once the frequency of the processed signal rises deviations
occur.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the performance of conveyor based precision
full-wave rectiﬁer has been analyzed and compared to the
standard opamp based topology. A new minimal conﬁg-
uration conveyor based rectiﬁer has been presented, that
employs current conveyors and two diodes. The rectiﬁer
can work in the voltage- or mixed-mode. Simulation were
performed that prove the feasibility of the proposed conveyor
based full-wave rectiﬁer.
