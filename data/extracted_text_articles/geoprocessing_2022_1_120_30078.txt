INTRODUCTION 
In this paper, we study a fast and efficient visible trajectory 
planning for drone swarms in a 3D urban environment, based 
on local point clouds data. Recently, urban scene modeling 
has become more and more precise, using Terrestrial/ground-
based LiDAR on unmanned vehicles to generate point clouds 
data for modeling roads, signs, lamp posts, buildings, trees 
and cars. Visibility analysis in complex urban scenes is 
commonly treated as an approximated feature due to 
computational complexity.  
Our trajectory planning method is based on a two-step 
visibility analysis in 3D urban environments using predicted 
visibility from point clouds data. The first step in our unique 
concept is to extract basic geometric shapes. We focus on 
three basic geometric shapes from point clouds in urban 
scenes: planes, cylinders and spheres, extracting these 
geometric shapes using efficient RANSAC algorithms with a 
high success rate of detection. The second step include 
decentralized swarm algorithm for motion planning, 
demonstrated on drones in urban environment. Our planner 
includes dynamic and kinematic platform’s limitation, 
generating visible trajectories based on our first step 
mentioned above. We demonstrate our visibility and 
trajectory planning method in simulations, showing trajectory 
planning in 3D urban environments for drone’s swarm with 
decentralized algorithms including performance analysis, 
such as order, safety, connectivity and union.  
Visibility analysis based on this approximated scene 
prediction is done efficiently, based on our analytic solutions 
for visibility boundaries. With this capability, we present a 
local on-line planner generating visible trajectories, exploring 
the most visible and safe node in the next time step, using our 
predicted visibility analysis.  
For the first time, we propose a solution for decentralized 
swarm algorithm which takes visibility into account, avoiding 
obstacles using Velocity Obstacle (VO) search and planning 
method.  
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II 
we introduce visibility analysis from point clouds data. In 
Section III, we introduce fast visibility analysis, and in Section 
VI we present decentralized swarm algorithm.  
II. 
VISIBILITY ANALYSIS FROM POINT CLOUDS DATA 
As mentioned, visibility analysis in complex urban scenes 
is commonly treated as an approximated feature due to its 
computational complexity. Recently, urban scene modeling 
has become more and more exact, using Terrestrial/ground-
based LiDAR generating dense point clouds data for modeling 
roads, signs, lamp posts, buildings, trees and cars. Automatic 
algorithms detecting basic shapes and their extraction have 
been studied extensively, and are still a very active research 
field [2]. 
In this part, we present a unique concept for predicted and 
approximated visibility analysis in the next attainable 
vehicle's state at a one-time step ahead in time, based on local 
point clouds data which is a partial data set. 
We focus on three basic geometric shapes in urban scenes: 
planes, cylinders and spheres, which are very common and 
can be used for the majority of urban entities in modeling 
scenarios. Based on point clouds data generated from the 
current vehicle's position in state k-1, we extract these

geometric shapes using efficient RANSAC algorithms [3] 
with high success rate detection tested in real point cloud data. 
After extraction of these basic geometric shapes from local 
point clouds data, our unified concept, and our main 
contribution, focus on the ability to predict and approximate 
urban scene modeling at the next view point Vk, i.e., at the 
attainable location of the vehicle in the next time step. Scene 
prediction is based on the geometric entities and the KF), 
which is commonly used in dynamic systems for tracking 
target systems [4][5]. We formulate the geometric shapes as 
states vectors in a dynamic system and predict the scene 
structure in the next time step, k. 
Based on the predicted scene in the next time step, visibility 
analysis is carried out from the next view point model [6], 
which is, of course, an approximated one. As the vehicle 
reaches the next viewpoint Vk, point clouds data are measured 
and scene modeling and states vectors are updated, which is 
an essential for the global swarm visible trajectory planning 
based on state-of-the-art decentralized algorithms. 
A. Shapes Extraction 
1) Geometric Shapes: 
The urban scene is a very complex one in the matter of 
modeling applications using LiDAR, and the generated point 
clouds are very dense. Despite these inherent complications, 
feature extraction can be made very efficient by using basic 
geometric shapes. We define three kinds of geometric shapes: 
planes, cylinders and spheres, with a minimal number of 
parameters for efficient time computation. 
Plane: center point (x,y,z) and unit direction vector from 
center point.  
Cylinder: center point (x,y,z), radius and unit direction 
vector of the cylinder axis. Cylinder height dimension will be 
consider later on as part of the simulation. 
Sphere: center point (x,y,z), radius and unit direction vector 
from center point. 
2) RANSAC: 
The RANSAC [7] is a well-known paradigm, extracting 
shapes from point clouds using a minimal set of a shape's 
primitives generated by random drawing in a point clouds set. 
A minimal set is defined as the smallest number of points 
required to uniquely define a given type of geometric 
primitive.  
     For each of the geometric shapes, points are tested to 
approximate the primitive of the shape (also known as "score 
of the shape"). At the end of this iterative process, extracted 
shapes are generated from the current point clouds data. 
     Based on the RANSAC concept, the geometric shapes 
detailed above can be extracted from a given point clouds 
data set. In order to improve the extraction process and reduce 
the number of points validating shape detection, we compute 
the approximated surface normal for each point and test the 
relevant shapes.  
Given a point-clouds 
with associated normals 
, the output of the RANSAC algorithm is a set of 
primitive shapes 
 and a set of remaining points 
. 
B. Predicted Scene – Kalman Filter 
     In this part, we present the global KF approach for our 
discrete dynamic system at the estimated state, k, based on 
the defined geometric shapes formulation defined in the 
previous sub-section. 
     Generally, the Kalman Filter can be described as a filter 
that consists of three major stages: Predict, Measure, and 
Update the state vector. The state vector contains different 
state parameters, and provides an optimal solution for the 
whole dynamic system [5]. We model our system as a linear 
one with discrete dynamic model, as described in (1): 
 
                                   (1) 
 
where
 is the state vector, F is the transition matrix and k is 
the state.  
     The state parameters for all of the geometric shapes are 
defined with shape center 
, and unit direction vector 
, of 
the geometric shape, from the current time step and viewpoint 
to the predicted one. 
     In each of the current states k, geometric shape center 
, is estimated based on the previous update of shape center 
location 
, and the previous updated unit direction vector 
, multiplied by small arbitrary scalar factor c, described 
in (2): 
 
                              (2) 
 
     Direction vector 
can be efficiently estimated by 
extracting the rotation matrix T, between the last two states 
k, k-1. In case of an inertial system fixed on the vehicle, a 
rotation matrix can be simply found from the last two states 
of the vehicle translations in (3): 
 
                                     (3) 
 
     The 3D rotation matrix T tracks the continuous extracted 
plans and surfaces to the next viewpoint 
, making it 
possible to predict a scene model where one or more of the 
geometric shapes are cut from current point clouds data in 
state k-1. The discrete dynamic system can be written as 
formulated in (4):

where the state vector 
 is 
 vector, and the transition 
squared matrix is 
. The dynamic system can be 
extended to additional state variables representing someof the 
geometric shape parameters such as radius, length etc. We 
define the dynamic system as the basic one for generic shapes 
that can be simply modeled with center and direction vector. 
Sphere radius and cylinder Z boundaries are defined in an 
additional data structure of the scene entities. 
 
III. 
FAST AND APPROXIMATED VISIBILITY ANALYSIS 
     In this section, we present an analytic analysis of the 
visibility boundaries of planes, cylinders and spheres for the 
predicted scene presented in the previous sub-section, which 
leads to an approximated visibility. For the plane surface, fast 
and efficient visibility analysis was already presented in [6]. 
In this part, we extend the previous visibility analysis concept 
[6] 
and 
include 
cylinders 
as 
continuous 
curves 
parameterization 
. 
Cylinder parameterization can be described in (5): 
  
      
, 
        (5) 
 
We define the visibility problem in a 3D environment for 
more complex objects as: 
 
     (6) 
 
where 3D model parameterization is 
, and the 
viewpoint is given as 
. Extending the 3D cubic 
parameterization, we also consider the case of the cylinder. 
Integrating (5) to (6) yields: 
 
                        (7) 
 
(8) 
     As can be noted, these equations are not related to Z axis, 
and the visibility boundary points are the same for each x-y 
cylinder profile, as seen in (7), (8). 
. 
     The visibility statement leads to a complex equation, 
which does not appear to be a simple computational task. This 
equation can be efficiently solved by finding where the 
equation changes its sign and crosses the zero value; we used 
analytic solution to speed up computation time and to avoid 
numeric approximations. We generate two values of 
 
generating two silhouette points in a very short time 
computation. Based on an analytic solution to the cylinder 
case, a fast and exact analytic solution can be found for the 
visibility problem from a viewpoint. 
     We define the solution presented in (8) as x-y-z 
coordinates values for the cylinder case as Cylinder 
Boundary Points (CBP). CBP, defined in (9), are the set of 
visible silhouette points for a 3D cylinder, as presented in 
Figure 1:

In the same way, sphere parameterization can be described as 
formulated in (10): 
 
               (10) 
 
We define the visibility problem in a 3D environment for this 
object in (11): 
 
     (11) 
 
where the 3D model parameterization is 
, and the 
viewpoint is given as

Where r is defined from sphere parameter, and 
are changes from visibility point along Z axis, as described in 
(12). The visibility boundary points for a sphere, together 
with the analytic solutions for planes and cylinders, allow us 
to compute fast and efficient visibility in a predicted scene 
from local point cloud data, which are updated in the next 
state. 
This extended visibility analysis concept, integrated with 
a well-known predicted filter and extraction method, can be 
implemented in real time applications with point clouds data. 
 
IV. 
DECENTRALIZED SWARMS TRAJECTORY PLANNING 
In this part, we focus on decentralized swarm algorithm 
with visibility analysis in urban environment as cost function 
for our trajectory. 
For our simulation, we used SwarmLab [10], drone swarm 
simulator that was implemented and adapted two 
representative algorithms belonging to the category of 
decentralized swarming. Decentralized approach can make 
the system easily scalable and robust to the failures of a single 
individual. SwarmLab includes algorithm developed by 
Olfati-Saber [12], who proposes a formal theoretical 
framework for the design and analysis of swarm algorithms 
based on potential fields and graph theory. 
The second algorithm that was implemented is an 
adaptation of the recent Vasarhelyi’s algorithm [13], defined 
by the following rules: repulsion to avoid inter-agent 
collisions, velocity alignment to steer the agents to an average 
direction, and self-propulsion to match a preferred speed 
value. In addition, the algorithm includes friction forces that 
reduce oscillations and ease the implementation on real 
robots. 
In decentralized approaches, one agent’s movement is 
only influenced by local information coming from its 
neighbors. Neighbors’ selection can be operated according to 
different metrics. 
In our work, we adopted these algorithms with visibility 
analysis as part of swarm’s trajectory by leading the swarm 
to the most visible areas in the scene by the swarm, as 
presented in the previous section. 
Unlike the original SwarmLab simulation where obstacle 
avoidance is based on simulating the obstacles as virtual 
agents, we used the Velocity Obstacles [8] local obstacles 
avoidance method.  
This obstacle avoidance method allows us to deal better 
with swarm behavior and can be more precise and gentler, 
avoiding obstacles in dense environments. 
A. The Planner 
     As mentioned above, our planner is based on an iterative 
local planning method, where the swarm is moving to the 
most visible area. By using RANSAC algorithm, point clouds 
data are extracted each time step into three possible objects: 
plane, cylinder and sphere. The scene is formulated as a 
dynamic system using KF analysis for objects' prediction. 
The objects are approximated for the next time step, and each 
safe attainable state that can be explored is set as candidate 
viewpoint. The cost for each agent is set as total visible 
surfaces, based on the analytic visibility boundary, where the 
optimal and safe node is explored for the next time step. 
     At each time step, the planner computes the next 
Attainable Velocities (AV). The safe nodes not colliding with 
objects such as cubes, cylinders and spheres, i.e., nodes 
outside VO, are explored. Where all nodes are inside VO, a 
unified analytic solution for time horizon is presented, 
generating an escape option for these radical cases without 
affecting visibility analysis. The planner computes the cost 
for these safe nodes based on predicted visibility and chooses 
the node with the optimal cost for the next time step. We 
repeat this procedure while generating the most visible 
trajectory. 
 
1) Visibility Analysis as Swarm Cost Function 
Our swarm direction and movement is guided by minimum 
invisible parts from viewpoint V to the approximated 3D 
urban environment model in the next time step, 𝑡 + ∆𝑡, set by 
KF after extracting objects from point clouds data using the 
RANSAC algorithm. The cost function next state is a  
combination of IRV and ISV, with different weights as 
functions of the required task.  
     The cost function presented in (13) is computed for each 
agent from his current state, considering the agent’s future 
location at the next time step (𝑥1(𝑡 + ∆𝑡),𝑥2(𝑡 + ∆𝑡)) as 
viewpoint: 
 
   𝑤(𝑥(𝑡 + ∆𝑡)) = 𝛼 ∙ 𝐼𝑆𝑉(𝑥(𝑡 + ∆𝑡)) + 𝛽 ∙ 𝐼𝑅𝑉(𝑥(𝑡 + ∆𝑡))    (13) 
 
       where ∝, 𝛽  are coefficients affecting the trajectory's 
character, as shown in (14). The cost function 𝑤(𝑥(𝑡 + ∆𝑡) 
produces the total sum of invisible parts from the viewpoint 
to the 3D urban environment. 
       We divide point invisibility value into Invisible Surfaces 
Value (ISV) and Invisible Roofs Value (IRV). This 
classification allows us to plan delicate and accurate 
trajectories upon demand. We define ISV and IRS as the total 
sum of the invisible roofs and surfaces (respectively). 
Invisible Surfaces Value (ISV) of a viewpoint is defined as 
the total sum of the invisible surfaces of all the objects in a 
3D environment, as described in (14): 
 
            (14) 
 
In the same way, we define Invisible Roofs Value (IRV) as 
the total sum of all the invisible roofs' surfaces, as described 
in (15):  
                (15)

Extended analysis of the analytic solution for visibility 
analysis for known 3D urban environments can be found in 
[6]. 
V. 
SIMULATIONS 
We implemented the presented algorithm and tested some 
urban environments on a Intel(R) Core (TM) i5-10210U CPU   
2.11 GHz with Matlab. We computed the visible trajectories 
using our planner, simulating cloud points using Matlab 
functions. 
On the first part, we tested our visibility analysis integrated 
into decentralized drones swarm algorithms as described 
above. The workflow of a swarm simulation is summarized 
in Figure 2, were typical scenario of cylinder objects in our 
environment can be seen in Figure 3. 
In the first case, we tested our algorithm with a relatively 
large number of agents. As can be seen in Figure 4, thirty 
agents in the swarm moving forward in straight line, 
presenting swarm trajectory, distance between the agents 
during mission, speed and accelerations during movement. 
The swarm navigates based on modified Olfati-Saber’s 
algorithm where obstacle avoidance implemented by 
Velocity Obstacles, where agents are simulated by point mass 
model. Swarm cost function is based on visibility analysis 
computed each time step as mentioned in the previous 
section. 
In the second case, we tested our algorithm with ten agents 
in the swarm, so each agent simulated with quadrotor 
dynamic model. As can be seen in Figure 5, ten agents in the 
swarm moving forward in straight line with C. Vasarhelyi’s 
etc. algorithm, but visibility analysis and dynamic constraints 
swift the swarm to the right side. presenting swarm trajectory, 
distance between the agents. Figure 5 also includes speed and 
accelerations during movement, performances analysis and 
total distance to the obstacles during mission. 
 
Figure 2.  SwarmLab simulation workflow. From the top left, in clockwise 
order: (1) in the GUI, the user sets the parameters related to the simulation, 
drone typology, swarm algorithm and environment. (2) the main simulation 
loop computes control commands for the drones, based on the information 
of the map and neighboring drones; (3) both real-time and post-simulation 
(Source [10]). 
     Order metric captures the correlation of the agents 
movements and gives an indication about how ordered the 
flock. Safety metrics, measure the risk of collisions among 
the swarm agents or between agents and obstacles. 
     Union metric counts the number of independent 
subgroups that originates during the simulation. 
     Connectivity metric defined from the algebraic 
connectivity of the sensing graph that underlines the 
considered swarm configuration. Detailed mathematical 
definitions of these performances’ parameters can be found 
in [11].

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
    In this research, we have presented an efficient swarm 
trajectory planning algorithm for visible trajectories in a 3D 
urban environment. 
    We extend our analytic visibility analysis method to 
cylinders and spheres, which allows us to efficiently set the 
visibility boundary of predicted objects in the next time step. 
Based on these fast computation capabilities, the on-line 
planner can approximate the most visible state as part of a 
decentralized swarm algorithm. 
     By using SwarmLab environment, we compare two 
decentralized algorithms from the state of the art for the 
navigation of aerial swarms, Olfati-Saber’s and Vasarhelyi’s. 
Our planner includes dynamic and kinematic platform’s 
limitation, generating visible trajectories based on our first 
step mentioned earlier.  
We demonstrate our visibility and trajectory planning 
method in simulations, showing trajectory planning in 3D 
urban environments for drone’s swarm with decentralized 
algorithms with performance analysis, such as order, safety, 
connectivity and union.  
Further research will focus on advanced geometric shapes, 
which will allow precise urban environment modeling, facing 
real-time implementation with on-line data processing from 
sensors.
