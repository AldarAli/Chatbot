Abstract—In this paper, an analytical framework is developed 
to evaluate the performance of complete partitioning (CP) 
policy with two different handover priority schemes for multi-
class traffic in Low Earth Orbit-Mobile Satellite Systems 
(LEO-MSS). The queuing of handover requests priority 
scheme is examined as the first priority scheme. Where, in the 
second priority scheme a combination of guard channel and 
handover request queuing priority schemes is developed. 
 
Keywords- LEO-MSS; multi-class; handover; queuing.

 INTRODUCTION  
The increase of public interest and mass marketing for 
mobile communications is leading to support third 
generation (3G) multimedia services requirements at anytime 
and anywhere. These make Mobile Satellite Systems (MSS) 
to be a good attractive choice for future global wireless 
communication networks. Compared with Geostationary 
Mobile Satellite Systems (GEO-MSS), LEO-MSS require 
lower transmit power, shorter propagation delay and higher 
traffic capacities. Therefore, LEO satellites are more suited 
for providing real-time interactive and multimedia services 
than other systems [1, 2]. 
The resource management strategies central issue for 
LEO-MSS system is to select the suitable policy for 
managing handover requests. From the user standpoint, the 
interruption of a conversation is more undesirable than 
blocking of a newly arriving call. Previous researches have 
considered various resource management strategies for LEO-
MSS. One approach is to queue handover (QH) requests [3, 
4]. Another approach for managing handovers (Guard 
channel) is to reserve resources before handover occurrence 
[5]. In the previous approaches, only single class of traffic 
was considered. For multi-class traffic, the performance 
analysis of a complete partitioning (CP) with or without 
fixed channel reservation was examined in [7]. 
Motivated by the above, in this paper, we present an 
analytical framework for evaluating the performance of 
LEO-MSS multi-class traffic using complete partitioning 
(CP) policy with two different handover priority schemes. In 
the first priority scheme, the handover requests queuing 
scheme is developed. Second, a combination of guard 
channel and handover request queuing approach is 
examined. The results are compared with the handover 
priority scheme developed in [7]. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, the basic assumptions are described. Section III 
presents a suitable mobility model. An analytical study for 
the CP policy with the two priority schemes is presented in 
Section IV. Section V shows the analytical results for the 
performance analysis. Finally, conclusions are drawn in 
Section VI. 
II. 
BASIC ASSUMPTION 
Similar to [9], this paper is based on the IRIDIUM 
system, which consists of 66 satellites orbiting over six near 
polar circular orbits at about 780 km of altitude. Due to the 
high value of the satellite ground-track speed, ܸ௧௥௞ (about 
26600 km/h in the LEO case), with respect to the user's 
motion, 
the 
relative 
satellite-user 
motion 
will 
be 
approximated by the vector ܸ௧௥௞. Moreover, mobile stations 
(MS’s) cross the cellular network irradiated by a satellite 
according to a parallel straight lines. 
The satellite footprint is divided into smaller cells or 
spotbeams in order to achieve efficient frequency reuse. Due 
to beam-forming, spot-beams are disposed on the earth 
according to a hexagonal regular layout (side R) with circular 
coverage of radius R’. The possible values for the ratio R’/R  
range is from 1 to 1.5 [9]. Clearly, the greater this ratio is, the 
larger the overlap area (between adjacent cells) as shown in 
Figure 1. Let us assume minimum possible extension for the 
overlap area such that R’=R. In the IRIDIUM case, the radius 
R is equal to 212.5 km. The centers of adjacent cells are 
separated by a distance equal to √3ܴ.  
To evaluate the performance of resource management 
strategies of multi-class traffic, the following qualities of 
service (QoS) parameters [7] are used: 
1)
, blocking probability of class-k new call attempts;  
 
2)
, handover failure probability of class-k calls;  
ܲ௕௞
3)
 call dropping probability of class-k calls;  
 ܲ௙௞
 ܲௗ௞,
4) ܲ௨௦௞, unsuccessful call proba lity of class-k traffic.  
bi
Based on ITU-T recommendations for land mobile 
services [10], the values ܲ௕௞  and ܲௗ௞  should not 
exceed 5. 10ିସ,10ିଶ respectively.  
III. 
MOBILTY MODEL 
In the following, let define source cell: the cell where the 
MS call starts and transit cell: any subsequent cell reached by 
the MS with the call in progress. From the call arrival in a 
cell, a random offset  ݖא ሾെܴ, ܴሿ  is associated to this call,

where z is the offset of the related MS according to the 
reference shown in Figure 1.  
For class-k traffic, in order to characterize the user's 
(relative) mobility in multi-class traffic LEO-MSS’s, we 
introduce the dimensionless parameter ߙ௞ as 
ߙ௞ ൌ
√3ܴ
ܸ௧௥௞ܶௗ௞
 
(1) 
wher
ܶௗ௞ is the average duration time of class-k calls. 
e 
The proposed model for LEO mobility is based on the 
foll wing assumptions [9]: 
o  
1) The new call origination is uniformly distributed over the 
mobile service area. 
2) MS’s cross the cellular network with a relative velocity, 
vector  ܸ௧௥௞  “orthogonal” to the side of the cells (as 
shown in Fig. 1). 
3) When a handover occurs, the destination cell will be the 
neighboring cell in the direction of the relative satellite-
user motion. 
4) From the call arrival in a cell, the related MS travels a 
distance (depending on offset z) defined as: 
• Uniformly distributed betw
o and ݀ሺݖሻ, if the 
cell is the source cell of the
 
een zer
 call;
• Deterministically equal to ݀ሺݖሻ, if the cell is a transit 
cell of the call.

our analysis, we have assumed the following [6]: 
 
 C channels are assigned per cell.

Under the complete partitioning (CP) policy, all C 
channels available in a cell are partitioned into independent 
K subsets, with Ck (1 ≤ k ≤ K) channels allocated to class-k 
traffic and ܥଵ ൅ܥଶ ൅ڮ൅ܥ௞൑ܥ. To efficiently assign the 
channels among traffic classes, an optimal channel 
partitioning scheme that can maximize channel utilization 
can be found in [11]. 
 
A. Complete Partitioning (CP) with Handover Queuing 
Priority Scheme 
In this subsection, an analytical approach to queuing of 
handover requests scheme is developed. We denote Ck as the 
number of channels allocated to class-k traffic. In general, 
when there are free channels in the class-k subset, class-k 
new and handover calls are equally likely to get service. 
However, when all the Ck channels are occupied, class-k new 
calls are blocked whereas handover call requests are queued 
in their queue (Q) of Length L for a maximum time ݐ୵ ୫ୟ୶, 
waiting for a free channel. If the queue is full, the class-k 
handover calls are dropped.  
Let Λ(j) denotes the number of free channels in class-k 
channel subset in the cell j. According to this queuing 
schem  the in r-beam handover requests are as follows: 
e,
te
1) If 
(j) ≠ 
, the class-k new and handover calls get 
ser ice im ediately in cell j. 
Λ
׎
v
m
2) If Λ(j) = ׎, the class-k new calls are blocked and the 
class-k handover requests are queued waiting for an 
available channel in cell j. In the meantime, the handover 
call is served by its originating cell. A handover request 
leaves the queue for one of the following reasons: 
 
a) The handover procedure is successful: The handover 
request is served, before the call is ended and its 
maximum queuing time has expired. 
b) The handover procedure has been useless: The call 
ends before the corresponding handover request is 
served and its maximum queuing time has exp ed. 
ir
c) The handover procedure fails and the call is dropped: 
The handover has not been performed within  ݐ୵ ୫ୟ୶ and 
the call is not ended before its maximum queuing time 
has expired. 
According to the queuing scheme described, the queuing 
scheme can be modeled as an M /M /Ck /S queue. Its state is 
defined as the sum of the number of class-k calls in service 
and the number of queued class-k handover requests. The 
state transition diagram is shown in Figure 2. The steady 
state probabi il ty of the state j, Pj can be derived as:

B. Complete Partitioning (CP) with Guard Channel and 
Handover Queuing Combination Priority Scheme 
This subsection presents an analytical model for the 
combination of guard channel and handover request queuing 
scheme. In this model, when there are free channels in the 
class-k subset, class-k new and handover calls are equally 
likely to get service. However, when the number of occupied 
channels is equal to threshold (Ck - Chk ), class-k new calls are 
blocked whereas class-k handover calls are gets service. 
When all the Ck channels are occupied, class-k handover call 
requests are queued in their queue (Q) of Length L for a 
maximum time t୵ ୫ୟ୶, waiting for a free channel according 
to the same scenario discussed in the previous scheme. 
As it is shown in Figure 3, the queuing scheme can be 
modeled as an M /M /Ck /S queue. Its state is defined as the 
sum of the number of class-k calls in service and the number 
of queued class-k handover requests. 
Let us analyze the state probabilities for the state 
transition diagram in Fig. 3, the steady state probability of 
the state j, P  can be obtained as:

Class-k new call arrivals are blocked when (Ck-Chk)

Similar to the previous scheme, the class-k handover 
failure probability can be computed as (15). 
Using (18) and (19), Pdk and Pusk can then be computed,

h no priority (named as CP) and CP with fixed channel 
reservation (guard channel) priority (named as CP-R) 
scheme examined in [7] have been also considered. 
In Figures 4(a) and 4(b), the analytical results for class-k 
new call blocking probability show that the handover 
queuing (CP-Queuing) priority scheme achieves a better 
performance than the handover queuing with guard channel 
combination (CP-R&Queuing) priority scheme for class-one 
and class-two traffic respectively. However, for class-two 
traffic the CP-Queuing scheme is very close in performance 
to non-prioritized CP scheme, it is slightly higher for class-
one traffic. The difference between the two schemes is duo 
to that the handover call requests which wait in a queue will 
occupy the channel as soon as the condition of channel varies 
from busy to free. Therefore, the new calls have smaller 
opportunity of occupying channel than the handover calls.

From the Figures 5(a) and 6(a), we can see that th
n (CP-R&Queuing) priority scheme fo
௙௞
ure 5(a)) and also of call dropping probability (ܲௗ௞, see 
Figure 6(a)) is the best among all other different priority 
schemes, and the performance difference between it and 
other schemes increase as the class-one traffic intensity 
increased. However, for class-two traffic the non-prioritized 
CP scheme and CP-R scheme attain better results than our 
schemes as shown in Figures 5(b), 6(b). 
From the performance of unsuccessful call probability 
(ܲ௨௦௞, i.e. representing the fraction of new class-k calls that 
are not completed because of either being
being dropped due to the failure of subsequent handover 
requests) of class-one and class-two traffic shown in Figures 
7(a), 7(b) respectively, the handover queuing (CP-Queuing) 
priority scheme and non-prioritized CP scheme have a good 
response over other priority schemes. In Figure 7(a), the CP-
Queuing scheme is less than non-prioritized CP scheme in

non-prioritized CP scheme is the best performance. 
For CP-Queuing priority scheme and as we can see in 
Figure 8, the increasing of handover request queuing length 
(Lk) has a approximately the same effect on the perf

e
new call blocking probability (Figure 8(a)) and handover 
failure probability (Figure 8(b)) for both class of traffic. 
In the CP-R&Queuing priority scheme, the new call 
blocking probability increases significantly as the number of 
channel reservation increase as shown in Figure 9(a). 
ormance difference for class-two traffic is significantly 
higher than the class-one traffic; this is due to the small 
number of channel assigned for this class. This increase in 
 ܲ௕௞  results with a decrease in the handover failure 
probability as can be seen in Figure 9(b). However, for class-
two traffic as the reserved channel increase it adopt with a 
little decrease in ܲ௙௞.

Analytical results have shown that: for class-one traf
h traffic intensity, it is recommended to use the 
combination of handover request queuing with guard channel 
priority scheme. For class-two traffic, we have seen that the 
CP policy with no priority scheme attains the best 
performance results.
