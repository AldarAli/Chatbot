Abstract- This work studies the effects of the prefilter bandwidth 
in the sequential symbol synchronizers based on pulse 
comparation at bit rate and at half bit rate. We consider three 
different prefilter bandwidth namely B1=∞∞∞∞, B2=2.tx and 
B3=1.tx, where tx is the bit rate. The synchronizer has two 
variants one operating by both transitions at bit rate and other 
operating by positive transitions at half rate. Each variant has 
two versions namely the manual and the automatic. The 
objective is to study the prefilter bandwidth with four 
synchronizers and to evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit 
Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal Noise 
Ratio). 
Keywords - Prefilter; Synchronizers; Communication systems. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
  This work studies the prefilter bandwidth effects on the 
jitter-SNR behavior of four sequential symbol synchronizers. 
The prefilter, applied before the synchronizer, switches 
their bandwidth between three values namely first B1=∞, 
after B2=2.tx and next B3=1.tx, where tx is the bit rate [1, 2]. 
The synchronizer has four types supported in two variants, 
one operating by both transitions at the rate with versions 
manual (b-m) and automatic (b-a) and other operating by 
positive transitions at half rate with versions manual (p-m/2) 
and automatic (p-a/2) [3, 4, 5, 6]. 
The difference between the four synchronizers is only in the 
phase comparator, since the other blocks are equal [7, 8]. 
The synchronizer VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) is 
the clock whose performance determines, in good part, the 
system quality [9, 10, 11, 12]. 
Fig. 1 shows the prefilter followed of the synchronizer.

PF(s) is the prefilter (low pass). The synchronizer has 
various blocks, namely Kf is the phase detector gain, F(s) is 
the loop filter, Ko is the VCO gain and Ka is the loop gain 
factor that controls the root locus and loop characteristics. 
Next, we present the state of the art. Then, we present the 
prefilter with three bandwidths (B1=∞, B2=2.tx, B3=1.tx).  
Following, we present the variant by both transitions at rate 
with their manual and automatic versions. Next, we present 
the variant by positive transitions at half rate with their 
manual and automatic versions. 
After, we present the design and tests. Then, we present the 
results. Finally, we present the conclusions. 
 
II. STATE OF THE ART, PROBLEM AND SOLUTION 
In priori and actual-art state, various synchronizers have 
been developed. The motivation is to create new 
synchronizers operating at half rate and evaluate their 
performance with the noise. This contribution increases the 
knowledge about the synchronizers [1, 2, 3, 4]. 
The problem is that the synchronizers’ output jitter 
increases when the input SNR decreases. To solve or to 
minimize the problem, we propose a prefilter that attenuates 
the noise, but unfortunately distorts slightly the signal [5, 6]. 
 
III. PREFILTER BANDWIDTH EFFECTS 
The prefilter, applied before the synchronizer, filters the 
noise but disturbs slightly the signal. The prefilter bandwidth 
B switches between three values (B1=∞, B2=2.tx, B3=1.tx). 
Fig. 2 shows the prefilter with their three bandwidths. 
 
 
Fig. 2 Three prefilter bandwidths: a) B1=∞; b) B2=2.tx; c) B3=1.tx 
 
a) First, as shown in Fig.2a, the prefilter has a bandwidth 
equal to infinite (B1= ∞). 
b) Second, as shown in Fig.2b, the prefilter has a bandwidth 
equal to times the bit rate (B2 = 2.tx). 
c) Third, as shown in Fig.2c, the prefilter has a bandwidth 
equal to the bit rate (B3 = 1.tx). 
We will evaluate the three bandwidth effects (B1, B2, B3) 
on the jitter-SNR curves of the four symbol synchronizers. 
 
IV. SYNCHRONIZERS OPERATING AT THE RATE 
The synchronizer with its phase comparator operates, here, 
by both transitions at the data transmission rate. 
This variant has the manual and the automatic versions, the 
difference in only in the phase comparator. The variable 
pulse Pv supported in the first flip flop with exor is equal in 
the two versions, but the fixed pulse Pf is different [1, 2].

A. Both transitions at the rate and manual 
 
The manual version has a phase comparator, where the fixed 
pulse Pf is produced by an exor with a delay ∆t=T/2, that 
needs a previous manual adjustment (Fig. 3) 
 
 Fig. 3 Synchronizer both at the rate and manual (b-m) 
 
The variable pulse Pv minus the fixed pulse Pf (Pv-Pf) 
determines the error phase that controls the VCO. 
 
B. Both transitions at the rate and automatic 
 
The automatic version has a phase comparator where the 
fixed pulse Pf is produced automatically by the second flip 
flop with exor, without previous adjustment (Fig. 4).

V. SYNCHRONIZERS OPERATING AT HALF RATE 
The synchronizer with its phase comparator operates, here, 
by positive transitions at half data transmission rate.  
This variant has the manual and the automatic versions, the 
difference is only in the phase comparator. The variable pulse 
Pv, based in the two first flip flops with multiplexer, is equal 
in the two versions, but the fixed pulse Pf is produced from a 
different way [3, 4]. 
 
A. Positive transitions at half rate and manual 
 
The manual version has a phase comparator, where the 
fixed pulse Pf is produced by an exor with a delay ∆t=T/2, 
that needs a previous manual adjustment  (Fig. 5). 
 
 
 Fig. 5 Synchronizer positive at half rate and manual (p-m/2) 
 
The variable pulse Pv minus the fixed pulse Pf (Pv-Pf) 
determines the error phase that controls the VCO. 
B. Positive transitions at half rate and automatic 
 
The automatic version has a phase comparator, where the 
fixed pulse Pf is produced automatically by the seconds flip 
flops and multiplexer with exor, without previous adjustment 
(Fig. 6).

VI. DESIGN, TESTS AND RESULTS 
We will present the design, the tests and the results of the 
referred  synchronizers [5]. 
 
A. Design 
 
To get guaranteed results, it is necessary to dimension all 
the synchronizers with equal conditions. Then it is necessary 
to design all the loops with identical linearized transfer 
functions. 
The general loop gain is Kl=Kd.Ko=Ka.Kf.Ko where Kf is 
the phase comparator gain, Ko is the VCO gain and Ka is the 
control amplification factor that permits the desired 
characteristics. 
For analysis facilities, we use a normalized transmission 
rate tx=1baud, what implies also normalized values for the 
others dependent parameters. So, the normalized clock 
frequency is fCK=1Hz. 
We choose a normalized external noise bandwidth Bn = 
5Hz and a normalized loop noise bandwidth Bl = 0.02Hz. 
Later, we can disnormalize these values to the appropriated 
transmission rate tx. 
Now, we will apply a signal with noise ratio SNR given by 
the signal amplitude Aef, noise spectral density No and 
external noise bandwidth Bn, so the SNR = A2
ef/(No.Bn). 
But, No can be related with the noise variance σn and inverse 
sampling 
∆τ=1/Samp, 
then 
No=2σn2.∆τ, 
so 
SNR=A2
ef/(2σn2.∆τ.Bn) = 0.52/(2σn2*10-3*5)= 25/σn2. 
After, we observe the output jitter UI as function of the 
input signal with noise SNR. The dimension of the loops is

The loop filter F(s)=1 with cutoff frequency 0.5Hz (Bp=0.5 
Hz is 25 times bigger than Bl=0.02Hz) eliminates only the 
high frequency, but maintain the loop characteristics.

Then, for the analog synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is 
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4 with (Km=1, A=1/2, B=1/2; Ko=2π) 
(Ka.Km.A.B.Ko)/4 = 0.02 -> Ka=0.08*2/π                       (3) 
For the hybrid synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is                                                    
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4 with (Km=1, A=1/2, B=0.45; Ko=2π) 
(Ka.Km.A.B.Ko)/4 = 0.02 -> Ka=0.08*2.2/π                     (4) 
For the combinational synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is 
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4     with     (Kf=1/π; Ko=2π) 
(Ka*1/π*2π)/4 = 0.02 -> Ka=0.04                                 (5) 
For the sequential synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is                                                    
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4     with     (Kf=1/2π; Ko=2π) 
(Ka*1/2π*2π)/4 =0.02 -> Ka=0.08                                (6) 
 
The jitter depends on the RMS signal Aef, on the power 
spectral density No and on the loop noise bandwidth Bl. 
For analog PLL the jitter is 
σφ2=Bl.No/Aef2=Bl.2.σn2.∆τ=0.02*10-3*2σn2/0.52=16*10-5.σn2 
For the others PLLs the jitter formula is more complicated. 
 
- 2nd order loop: 
The second order loop is not shown here, but the results are 
identical to the ones obtained above for the first order loop. 
 
B. Tests 
 
The following figure (Fig. 7) shows the setup that was used 
to test the various  synchronizers. 
 
 
 Fig. 7 Block diagram of the test setup 
 
The receiver recovered clock with jitter is compared with 
the emitter original clock without jitter, the difference is the 
jitter of the received clock. 
 
C. Jitter measurer (Meter) 
 
The jitter measurer (Meter) consists of a RS flip flop, which 
detects the random variable phase of the recovered clock 
(CKR), relatively to the fixed phase of the emitter clock 
(CKE). This relative random phase variation is the recovered 
clock jitter (Fig. 8). 
 
 
 Fig. 8 The jitter measurer (Meter) 
 
The other blocks convert this random phase variation into a 
random amplitude variation, which is the jitter histogram. 
Then, the jitter histogram is sampled and processed by an 
appropriate program, providing the RMS jitter and the peak 
to peak jitter. 
 
D. Results 
 
We will present the results (jitter-noise graphics) for the 
prefilter with the four synchronizers. 
Fig. 9 shows the jitter-SNR curves of the prefilter 
bandwidth B1=∞ with the four synchronizers namely both 
transitions at the rate manual (b-m), both transitions at the 
rate automatic (b-a), positive transitions at half rate manual 
(p-m/2) and positive transitions at half rate automatic (p-a/2). 
 
Fig. 9 Jitter-SNR curves of  B1- 4 synchronizers(b-m,b-a,p-m/2,p-a/2) 
 
  We verify that, generally, the output jitter UIRMS decreases 
more or less exponentially with the input SNR increasing. 
For prefilter B1, for high SNR, the four synchronizer jitter 
curves tend to be similar. However, for low SNR, the manual 
versions (b-m, b-m/2) are slightly better than the similar 
automatic versions (b-a, b-a/2). The both transitions at rate 
manual (b-m) is slightly the best. 
Fig. 10 shows the jitter-SNR curves of the prefilter 
bandwidth B2=2.tx with the four synchronizers namely both 
transitions at the rate manual (b-m), both transitions at the 
rate automatic (b-a), positive transitions at half rate manual 
(p-m/2) and positive transitions at half rate automatic (p-a/2).

For prefilter B2, we verify that, it becomes the jitter-SNR  
curves more similar between themselves. For high SNR, it 
harms slightly the jitter-SNR curves. However, for low SNR, 
it benefits significantly the jitter - SNR curves. 
Fig. 11 shows the jitter-SNR curves of the prefilter 
bandwidth B3=1.tx with the four synchronizers namely both 
transitions at the rate manual (b-m), both transitions at rate 
automatic (b-a), positive transitions at half rate manual (p-
m/2) and positive transitions at half rate automatic (p-a/2).

For prefilter B3, we verify that, it becomes the jitter-SNR  
curves still more similar between themselves. For high SNR, 
it harms more slightly the jitter-SNR curves. However, for 
low SNR, it benefits less significantly the jitter - SNR curves. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We studied three prefilter bandwidths (B1=∞, B2=2.tx, 
B3=1.tx) with four symbol synchronizers, namely both 
transitions at rate manual (b-m), both transitions at rate 
automatic (b-a), positive transitions at half rate manual (b-
m/2) and positive transitions at half rate automatic (b-a/2). 
Then, we measured their jitter-SNR. 
We observed that, in general, the output jitter decreases 
almost exponentially with the input SNR increasing. 
For prefilter B1=∞, we verified that, for high SNR, the four 
synchronizers jitter curves tend to be similar, this is 
comprehensible since all the four synchronizers are digital 
and have similar noise margin. However, for low SNR, the 
manual versions (b-m, b-m/2) are significantly better than the 
similar automatic versions (p-a, p-a/2), this is comprehensible 
since the automatic versions have more error states 
propagation that contributes to the jitter. The version both 
transitions at rate (b-m) is slightly the best because has less 
digital states. 
For prefilter B2=2.tx, we verified that, it becomes the jitter 
curves more similar between themselves. For high SNR, it 
harms slightly the jitter-SNR curves. However, for low SNR, 
it benefits significantly the jitter-SNR curves. 
 
For prefilter B3=1.tx, we verified that, it becomes the jitter 
curves still more similar between themselves. For high SNR, 
it harms more slightly the jitter-SNR curves. However, for 
low SNR, it benefits less significantly the jitter-SNR curves. 
So, the prefilter, for high SNR, degrades slightly the jitter-
SNR curves, but for low SNR, benefits significantly the jitter-
SNR curves and becomes them more similar. 
In the future, we are planning to extend the present study to 
other types of synchronizers.
