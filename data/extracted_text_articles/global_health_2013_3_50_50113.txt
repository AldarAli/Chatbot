Abstract—An Enzymatic biofuel cell is a specific type of fuel 
cell which uses enzymes as catalysts to oxidize its fuel. They 
pose as a great promise in terms of their relatively inexpensive 
components and fuels, as well as a potential power source for 
bionic implants. Here, we present the use of dry-etched 
nanotextured porous silicon scaffolds to increase the contact 
surface area of silicon with surrounding biofuel to enhance the 
process of harvesting of energy, and consequently, the 
efficiency of the cell.  
Keywords-nanotechnology; porous silicon; biofuel cell

 INTRODUCTION 
Recent advances in micro and nanotechnologies allow 
the development of implantable, portable, and miniature 
devices for a broad range of applications, including 
biomedical fields. Powering implantable medical devices 
necessitates the development of lightweight, non-toxic and 
stable sources of energy with long life spans. In fact, the 
number of battery charging cycles in micro-energy 
harvesting methods is a major source of limitation [1]. 
Several micro-energy harvesting sources have been already 
identified in previous research, namely, low and high 
frequency electromagnetic Radio Frequency (RF) signal 
harvesting, conversion of vibration into energy, thermal and 
pressure gradients energy harvesting in addition to the latest 
attempts towards organic energy generation directly within 
the human body using fuel cells [2, 3].  
Harvesting energy using ambient vibration has been the 
focus of various projects [4-6]. Devices made for this 
purpose are mechanically modeled with a base excitation of 
an elastically mounted seismic mass moving past a coil. 
Optimal architecture for maximal power generation under 
different operating conditions has also been shown [7]. 
Various applications of this principle have manifested in 
systems integrated in footwear to harvest energy from 
walking [8], while in other designs piezoelectric and 
electromagnetic generators convert pressure variations into 
electricity [9]. The power generated using these methods 
ranges from tens to hundreds of milliwatts [3, 6, 7]. On the 
other hand, several studies have focused on energy 
harvesting from low frequency vibrations [6, 10]. This 
concept was made viable by creating a generator that 
converts low-frequency environmental vibrations to a higher 
frequency by employing the frequency up conversion 
technique [11, 12]. One major limitation of this technology is 
encountered with patients that are not able to perform any 
physical activities in order to power the generator and, 
hence, produce the necessary charging current. 
Energy harvesting using RF inductive coupling is a very 
promising technology, particularly in the presence of such a 
wide variety of RF signals in our everyday environment. 
Additionally, this technology can also be used to send data 
back to a base station, thus creating a two-way link. The 
system consists of a power generating circuit linked to a 
receiving antenna in order to capture the RF signal and 
convert it to a DC voltage [13]. The main challenge in this 
technology is in the receiver’s capacity to read various 
frequencies, as well as the use of efficient power rectifiers. 
Several interesting studies have reported either the use of 
multiple energy harvesting antennas in one area [14], which 
has shown that an increase of 83% in area results in 300% 
increase in power, or the design of a high efficiency, ultra-
low voltage active rectifiers [15].  
This article covers the use of porous silicon scaffolds for 
biofuel cells. The next section presents and compares 
different types of biofuel cells. Section III introduces porous 
silicon technology. Section IV discusses existing porous 
silicon fabrication techniques. Section V details the 
fabrication process of the porous silicon scaffolds using 
XeF2.        
II. 
BIOFUEL CELLS 
The first enzyme based glucose/O2 fuel cell to generate 
electricity was introduced in 1964 by Yahiro et al., aiming at 
using this concept to power an artificial heart [16]. While the 
field of fuel cell research has flourished in various industrial 
and environmental arenas, biomedical applications started 
making use of the technology only after 2001, with recent 
successes in micro fuel cell technology [17-19]. The two 
most dominant classifications of fuel cells are enzymatic, 
illustrated in Fig. 1, and microbial, based on the catalyst used 
to oxidize or reduce the fuel used in the design [20]. While 
microbial catalysts offer more longevity to the fuel cell, 
microbial fuel cells require a barrier between the cathode and 
the anode and between the fuel cell and its surrounding 
environment [21]. Such a design increases its size and 
decreases the current density since the fuel cell lacks direct 
contact with the fuel. Most importantly, when it comes to the 
use of microbial fuel cell for implantable devices, long term 
infections, thrombosis and other types of complications raise 
serious concerns [22, 23]. Therefore, it is natural that the use 
38

of microbial fuel cells was limited to few studies, one of 
them suggesting its use within the intestinal environment 
inside the transverse colon [24]. On the other hand, 
enzymatic fuel cells have lower stability and shorter lifespan 
because the longevity of enzymes is in the range of 10 days 
[25]. This has driven research in enzymatic fuel cells 
towards short term uses such as glucose sensors, post-op 
temperature measurement or as a power supply for pressure 
sensors indicating blockage of fluid flow in the nervous 
system [22]. However, since enzymes are selective in nature, 
the design of enzymatic fuel cells can be made into 
microscopic sizes without the need for a separating 
membrane to regulate the flow of the fluid and enzymes used 
in its design, thus achieving higher power densities due to 
the direct contact between the probes and the fuel [25]. 
Continuous attempts to increase the lifetime of the enzymes 
exist using immobilization techniques or using magnetic iron 
nanoparticles that shield the enzymes from getting oxidized 
or self-digested [26].

Oxygen. 
Another important factor in the design of the fuel cell is 
the target fuel. Although most implantable fuel cell studies 
have focused so far on the use of blood stream glucose, some 
studies have considered other alternatives such as the use of 
white blood cells based on their ability to generate electron 
current across their cellular membrane [27-29]. 
Most importantly, the complex environment inside the 
human body, such as the amount of glucose and oxygen 
available in addition to the neo-vascular build up that can 
hinder the exposure of the fuel cell to body fluids, represent 
important obstacles that any fuel cell design have to 
overcome in order for it to become a viable one [28]. Based 
on the first in-vivo study conducted by Cinquin et al., an 
enzymatic fuel cell was built by adjusting the types of 
enzymes used in order to account for the specific HP 
concentration and the effect of urea presence on the fuel cell 
[30]. This was implanted inside the peritoneal cavity of a rat, 
and has proven to provide a stable power of more than 7.52 
μW/mL for a period of 3 months [30].  
Here, we are interested in increasing the efficiency of 
energy harvesting in enzymatic fuel cells by increasing the 
contact surface area between the harvesting probes and the 
surrounding fuel. This can be achieved by using a porous 
interface which provides a large surface to volume ratio. 
Doped porous silicon represents a good candidate due to the 
fact that it combines both biocompatibility and electrical 
conductivity [31, 32]. 
III. 
POROUS SILCION TECHNOLOGY 
Implantable biomedical devices built from bulk silicon 
have been available for biosensing and actuating applications 
for several years. However, this form of silicon is not 
biocompatible and so far this has prevented its use in vivo. 
Bulk silicon-based devices need coating or packaging in a 
biocompatible material, if they are to be used in and linked to 
living tissues [31, 32]. The majority of today's medical 
devices are coated with materials such as Polyvinylchloride 
(PVC), polypropylene, polycarbonate, fluorinated plastics 
and stainless steel. These materials are tolerated by the 
human body and are described as bioinert. An effective 
biomaterial, however, must bond to living tissue and is 
known as bioactive.  
Nanostructured porous silicon (PS), whose particular 
texture can be described as a network of pores 
interconnected 
by 
solid 
nanocrystalline 
silicon, 
has 
properties that make it a very promising bioactive 
biomaterial [33, 34], in particular for devices that need to be 
linked to the biological system such as implantable devices 
[35]. Porous silicon  material  is  useful  and  attractive  for  a  
wide  variety  of  applications  to  develop biological sensors 
[35-37] and biomedical devices [38, 39]. This has 
significantly increased the interest in using porous silicon in 
biofuel cells.  
An essential requirement for fabricating porous silicon in 
different applications is to have the ability to vary the size 
and configuration of the pores by choosing the appropriate 
fabrication parameters and conditions. For instance, for 
photonic bandgap filters, the pores are designed to the on the 
order of the wavelength of the light to retain and tune the 
optical reflectivity of the porous silicon [40, 41]. For 
biological sample filters, the pore size has to be large enough 
to allow the desired biomolecules to be filtered and cross 
through the pores freely [42]. 
IV. 
FABRICATION OF POROUS SILCON 
Many previous reports have shown that porous silicon 
can be prepared through a galvanostatic, chemical, or 
photochemical etching procedures in the presence of 
hydrofluoric (HF) acid solutions or through stain etching 
[43-45]. Other methods such as pulsed anodic etching [46] 
and magnetic-field assisted anodization [47] were also 
employed for porous silicon preparation. In these techniques, 
the pore characteristics such as  diameter,  geometric  shape  
and  direction  of  the  pores  not  only  depend  on  the 
composition of the etching solution, but they also depend on 
temperature, current density, crystal orientation, dopant and 
doping density of the silicon substrate [43, 45, 48]. 
Moreover, porous silicon produced on large surface areas 
39

GLOBAL HEALTH 2013 : The Second International Conference on Global Health Challenges

along with high porosity and/or thickness leads to a 
systematic cracking of the layer during the evaporation of the 
etching solvent. The origin of the cracking is the large 
capillary stress associated with evaporation from the pores. 
During the evaporation process, a pressure drop occurs 
across the gas/liquid interface that forms inside the pores 
[49]. 
In this paper, we employ a novel and simple fabrication 
technique which employs Xenon Difluoride (XeF2)-based 
dry isotropic etching to selectively form porous silicon in 
bulk single crystal silicon wafers [50]. XeF2 is plasma-less 
etching technique and is based on the reaction of the fluorine 
ions, which represents the main etchant, with the solid 
silicon to produce – at room temperature – the volatile gas 
SiF4. In a XeF2-based etching process, a standard hard baked 
layer of photoresist can serve as a masking layer. In addition 
to its etching process simplicity, XeF2 has a high etch 
selectivity to silicon. It reacts readily with silicon, but is 
relatively inert to photoresistance, silicon dioxide, silicon 
nitride and aluminum, which allows this technique to be used 
in the presence of CMOS integrated circuits as a post 
processing step. This is not the case when HF-based etching 
is used, as this latter will etch or damage the circuitry 
without a very hard mask followed by complex post-
processing to remove the mask. 
V. 
METHODS 
We utilized XeF2 dry etching to create porous silicon 
surfaces on single crystalline silicon wafers. We used 3 inch 
diameter, 381± 20 μm thick <100> boron-doped (5–10 ohm 
cm) silicon wafers. The wafer was cut into 1.3 X 1.3 cm2 that 
were then loaded in the XeF2 etching chamber. The XeF2 
etching process does not depend on the silicon crystal 
orientation or its dopant content.  
The fabrication process is achieved in a sequence of steps. 
First, undissociated gaseous XeF2 is adsorbed onto the 
exposed areas of bulk silicon. The adsorbed gas is then 
dissociated into xenon and fluorine, after which the fluorine 
ions react with silicon to produce SiF4 gas. Dissociation of 
the gas phase at room temperature leaves behind a porous 
silicon surface. In this process, increasing the etching process 
time increases the overall size of the pores and the thickness 
of the porous silicon film. The chemical reaction for the 
etching of silicon by XeF2 is: Si + 2XeF2  SiF4 + 2Xe. As 
a dry etching technique, there is no post-fabrication drying 
step required, thus reducing the risk of damage to the newly 
formed porous surface.  
XeF2 leaves behind porous silicon surfaces on top of the 
remaining bulk silicon with porous silicon layer thickness on 
the order of several hundreds of nanometers (600 to 700 nm). 
The obtained porosity depends on the etching time. Fig. 2 
shows a representative Scanning Electron Microscope image 
of porous silicon sample prepared using XeF2.  “”
