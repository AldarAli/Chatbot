Abstract—Electricity costs comprise a signiﬁcant portion of op-
erating expenses forData Center Networks (DCNs). As a re-
sult, energy-aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment schemes
(RWA), which try to minimize the overall energy consumption for
data transmission, have received considerable attention in the past
decade. Recently, the idea of minimizing the dollar cost of energy
consumption using Real-Time Pricing (RTP) has been proposed
for Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical networks.
The RTP-based RWA has been shown to result in reduced
electricity costs. In this paper, we present a new formulation
for optimal RWA for scheduled lightpath demands using the
RTP model. Our results indicate that the proposed approach
clearly outperforms the Flat-Rate Price (FRP) model, as well as
traditional shortest path routing schemes.

INTRODUCTION
Data Center Networks (DCNs) are one of the fastest
growing consumers of electricity due to the rapid increase
of digital content, big data, e-commerce and Internet trafﬁc
[1]-[5]. The electricity costs comprise a signiﬁcant portion of
operating expenses for such networks [6]-[10]. To mitigate
this problem, the development of energy efﬁcient schemes
is crucial at all levels of network infrastructure, including
data transmission. Many Routing and Wavelength Assignment
(RWA) schemes that minimize energy consumption at network
nodes and/or ﬁber links have been proposed in the literature
for data transfer over an optical network [11]-[13]. However,
energy prices using the RTP model can vary widely, depending
on geographic location. Therefore, minimizing energy con-
sumption may not necessarily result in the least dollar cost.
Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) in optical networks
is the technology that allows multiplexing a number of optical
carrier signals onto a single optical ﬁber by using different
wavelengths. In this study, we propose an energy-aware RWA
optimal algorithm, which aims to minimize the dollar cost in
WDM optical networks using RTP the model.
In recent years, various research works have been published
in the ﬁeld of energy efﬁcient WDM networks. A number of
different approaches have been proposed including reducing
Electrical-Optical-Electrical (E-O-E) conversions [14], switch-
ing off or slowing down unused network elements [15][16]
putting selected network components in sleep mode [17],
and using intelligent trafﬁc grooming techniques [18][19].
Energy aware unicast routing in WDM networks has received
considerable research attention in the last ten years [20].
In many applications, the physical location of the server
or other network resources remains hidden from the user as
it is not important. In this scenario, it is possible to select
the best destination from the set of possible destinations
to execute a job. This is known as anycast routing [21].
This allows the routing algorithms the ﬂexibility of choosing
a suitable processing (destination) node for a given task,
such that network resources can be utilized as efﬁciently as
possible. Both heuristics and optimal formulations energy-
aware approaches using anycast routing have been considered
in [22]-[24]. The goal is to reduce both the static and the
dynamic (load dependent) portions of power consumption as
much as possible, although static power consumption typically
dominates for most network components [24].
In WDM optical networks, there are mainly three different
demand allocation models:
1)
Static trafﬁc model: Where the set of demands is
ﬁxed and known in advance.
2)
Dynamic trafﬁc model: Where the start time and
the end time of the demands are known in advance.
The set of demands is generated based on certain
distributions.
3)
Scheduled trafﬁc model: Where the set of demands
is predictable and periodic in nature.
In Scheduled Trafﬁc Demands (STDs), the setup time and
the tear down time for the demand is known in advance. The
Scheduled Trafﬁc Model (STM) is further divided into two
different models, known as ﬁxed window trafﬁc model and
sliding scheduled trafﬁc model. A number of recent papers
have shown how anycast routing can be used for minimizing
the overall energy consumption in optical networks [23]-[25].
However, these papers mostly deal with the static [26][27] or
dynamic [12][13] trafﬁc models. In our previous work, we have
considered energy-aware routing and trafﬁc grooming of sub-
wavelength demands, under STM [28]. Although energy aware
routing for WDM networks has received signiﬁcant attention
in recent years, the idea of utilizing the anycast concept for
energy minimization [16][23][25] has been less well studied.
Replication in DCNs makes it possible to have multiple
copies of data on different Data Centers (DCs) [29]. Adding
more replicas improves reliability, lowers latency across the
network, and allows more ﬂexibility in choosing energy ef-
ﬁcient routes; but it also increases the costs for network
equipment and storage [30]. Very recently, researchers have
proposed reducing the operational expenditures by choosing
the route with the least cost for the energy consumed based on
Real-Time Pricing (RTP) [31]. They considered price changes
throughout the day and for different US time zones. The Least
Dollar Path (LDP) approach in [31] considers the real-time
energy costs and replicated data storage to avoid costly peak
charges and reduce the overall energy cost. The ﬂat rate pricing
21

model leads to more electricity costs as compared to the real-
time pricing model [31]. Efﬁcient routing schemes and proper
arrangement of the replicas can lower energy consumption in
the DCNs [31].
In this paper, we present a new Integer Linear Program
(ILP) formulation for RTP-based optimal RWA of scheduled
lightpath demands. Under STM, the setup and teardown times
of the demands are known in advance, so that the RWA
algorithm can optimize resource allocation in both space and
time [32]. The proposed ILP not only selects the appropriate
data center node to serve each request, but also performs
RWA that leads to the least dollar cost. A heuristic algorithm
for solving this problem has been presented in [33]. To the
best of our knowledge, RTP-based energy-aware RWA for
advance reservation under the ﬁxed-window STM has not been
considered before. Our approach differs from the previous
RTP-based RWA as follows:
•
We consider energy consumption not only at network
nodes, but along ﬁber links as well.
•
We process the set of demands as a whole, rather
than adopt a greedy approach where each demand is
processed one at a time.
•
We consider both static and dynamic components of
power consumption of nodes and links.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we outline our network energy model and propose
an optimal formulation for energy-aware routing. In Section
III, we present and analyze our simulation results and discuss
our conclusions with some directions for future work in
Section IV.

ENERGY EFFICIENT ANYCAST ROUTING FOR FIXED
WINDOW SCHEDULED TRAFFIC MODEL
In this section, we introduce the proposed optimal algo-
rithm formulated as an ILP using the anycast principle for ﬁxed
window scheduled lightpath demands allocation. The objective
here is to minimize the overall electricity costs of a DCN by
reducing the actual energy consumption.
A. Network Energy Model
We consider a transparent IP-over-WDM network, which
consists of optical cross connect switches (OXCs) connected
to an IP router [34]. We consider power consumption both at
network nodes and ﬁber links [24]. The total power consump-
tion of the IP router and optical switch can be calculated using
the following equations.
PIP = P s
IP + πIP ∗ tIP
(1)
PSW = P s
OXC + πOXC ∗ tλ
(2)
In (1) and (2), P s
IP and P s
OXC denote the static power
consumption for the IP router and the optical switch, respec-
tively. Similarly, πIP and πOXC denote the dynamic, i.e.
trafﬁc dependent, power consumption for the IP router and
the optical switch, respectively. The terms tIP and tλ indicate
the amount of trafﬁc ﬂowing through the IP router and the
switch, respectively.

B. Solution Approach
We consider a set of ﬁxed window lightpath demands and
propose a minimum cost path using RTP (MCP-RTP) model to
select the route and destination for each demand in such a way
that the overall electricity costs are minimized. The notation

D. Justiﬁcation of the ILP
The objective function tries to minimize the dollar cost
by using the real time electricity prices. The summation is
over all intervals m and for each network component, i.e.,
IP router, optical switch and ﬁber link. The term costi,m is
the real time electricity price at node i during interval m. We
have 24 intervals and for each interval the electricity price is
different. For calculating the cost of a link e : i → j, we have
multiplied the energy consumption of the link e with the RTP
electricity cost at the destination node j of that link.
Constraint (4) is the standard ﬂow conservation constraint,
which ﬁnds a feasible path from source node sq to the
selected data center (destination) node dcq,i for each demand q.
Constraint (5) ensures that if lightpath q traverses link e : i → j
the value of yq,i is set to 1. Constraint (6) ensures that the total
number of demands traversing link e : i → j does not exceed
the number of available channels |K|. Constraint (7) ensures
that exactly one data center is selected as the destination node
for lightpath q.
Constraints (8) - (12) are the IP router usage constraints.
They are used to determine if a particular IP router at node i
is active during interval m. Constraints (8) - (10) are used to
set the value of βq
i,m. Constraint (8) sets βq
i,m to 1 if lightpath
q is active during interval m and DC node i is selected as
a destination for lightpath q. Constraints (9) and (10) ensure
that βq
i,m is set to 0 if either dcq,i or aq,m is 0. Constraint
(11) ensures that if the IP router is active at node i during
interval m it is used by at least one lighthpath q. Constraint
(12) ensures that if there is no lightpath q using the IP router
at node i during interval m then the IP router is not active
during that interval m, i.e., IPi,m = 0.
Constraints (13) - (17) are the optical switch usage con-
straints. They are used to determine if a particular optical
23

switch at node i is active during interval m. Constraints (13)
- (15) are used to set the value of γq
i,m. Constraint (13) sets
γq
i,m to 1 if lightpath q is active during interval m and uses
the OXC at node i. Constraints (14) and (15) ensure that γq
i,m
is set to 0, if either dcc,q + yq,i or aq,mis 0 . Constraint (16)
ensures that the OXC switch is active at node i during interval
m if it is used by at least one lightpath q. Constraint (17)
ensures that if there is no lightpath q using OXC switch at
node i during interval m, then the OXC switch is not active
during that interval m, i.e., OXCi,m= 0.
Constraints (18) - (22) are the link usage constraints. They
are used to determine if a particular link is active during
interval m. Constraints (18) - (20) are used to set the value
of σq
e,m. Constraint (18) sets σq
e,m to 1 if lightpath q uses
link e and is active during interval m. Constraints (19) and
(20) ensure that σq
e,m is set to 0 if either xq,e or aq,mis 0 .
Constraint (21) ensures that link e is active during interval m
if it is used by at least one lightpath q. Constraint (22) ensures
that if there is no lightpath q using link e during interval m,
then the link is not active during that interval m, i.e., Le,m =
0.
E. An Illustrative Example
To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we
consider a simple 6-node network with 8 bi-directional links.
The physical topology used in this example is shown in Figure
1a. The label on each edge represents the length of the link
in Km. Nodes 2 and 3 are identiﬁed as the data center nodes,
which will serve as potential destinations for the connection
(lightpath) demands.

Figure 2. Routing of lightpath demands for the proposed objective.
A set of 3 lightpath demands is shown in Figure 1b, where
sq indicates the source node, stq indicates the starting time
interval for that demand and τq indicates the holding time for
the demand, in terms of the number of time intervals. For
example, according to the lightpath requests table, the lightpath
LP0 originates from node 1, at interval 5 and is active for a
total of 8 intervals. Based on our main objective, which tries to
minimize the dollar costs by reducing the power consumption
in the DCNs, the ILP selects the appropriate destination (i.e.,
data center node) and ﬁnds the “best” route with minimum
dollar cost to the selected destination.
Figure 2 shows the routing scheme of lightpath demands
on the given physical topology based on our objective, which
minimizes the overall dollar cost. To explain how the lightpaths
are routed based on our approach’s minimum dollar cost
objective, we consider the following examples:
•
lightpath LP1 is using the route 3 → 4 where the
selected data center is node 3. The approach could
have chosen an alternative data center at node 2 if the
objective was to minimize the distance, for instance.
•
Similarly, lightpath LP2 is using the route 3 → 4 → 5
with data center node 3 as the destination based on our
objective. If the objective was to minimize the path
distance or the number of hops, for example, then the
ILP could have chosen the route 2 → 5 with data
center node 2 as the destination instead.
III.
SIMULATION RESULTS
For our simulations, we consider three well-known topolo-
gies: the 11-node COST-239, the 14-node NSFNET, and 24-
node USANET [20]. The number of lightpath demands used
in the simulations ranged from 40 to 120. The holding time
of each demand ranged from 4 hours to 15 hours, with an
average duration of 5 hours. The results reported in this
section correspond to average values over 5 different runs. The
simulation was carried out with IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.6.2.
Results are reported for four different approaches listed
below, for different networks and trafﬁc loads.
•
The proposed ILP (MCP-RTP)
•
The minimum hop path (MHP)
•
The shortest distance path (SDP)
•
The mininum cost path with ﬂat rate pricing (MCP-
FRP)
The dollar costs for routing 40 demands over different
topologies and for three different approaches, our proposed
approach, MCP-RTP, MHP, and SDP are shown in Figure 3.
As seen in the ﬁgure, our main approach, which minimizes
the electricity cost, has the lowest dollar cost for all cases,
as expected. The improvement ranges from 36% - 62.9%
compared to MHP approach which aims to minimize the path
number of hops and 31.8% - 63.4% compared to SDP which
minimizes the path distance.
A comparison of dollar costs for routing different demands
over the 14-node topology, using the three approaches of
Figure 3, is shown in Figure 4. A standard growth in the
dollar cost values is observed with an increase in the demand
size. As expected, our proposed approach MCP-RTP, performs
better than the other approaches in reducing the dollar cost.

In Figure 5, a comparison of the overall dollar cost is

with our approach MCF-RTP and the MCF-FRP approach,
which tries to minimize the dollar cost using the ﬂat-rate price
model. Our approach outperforms the MCF-FRP by reducing
the electricity cost by an average of 60%.
We illustate how the overall cost varies with the number
of demands for the 14-node NSFNET topology, for MCP-RTP
and MCP-FRP routing schemes in Figure 6. As expected, the
proposed method (MCP-RTP) clearly outperforms the others,
with an average reduction of 53% in cost. We note that this
reduction in cost comes at the expense of slightly longer paths
for routing demands, in some cases.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed an ILP for the RTP energy-
aware RWA for the ﬁxed window scheduled trafﬁc model.
We have considered the anycast routing scheme to select the
best option for the destination node and the real-time pricing
model for selecting lightpaths’ routes. The objective of this
model is to reduce the overall electricity cost by reducing
the actual power consumption and using nodes and links with
lower costs. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed

In this work, we have primarily focused on energy costs. In
the future, it will be interesting to incorporate other Quality of
Service (QoS) metrics, such as bandwidth and delay into our
model and evaluate the performance in terms of these metrics.
It is also worthwhile to consider trade-offs of selecting the least
cost path, which may have higher energy consumption, and
compare the results with existing works that minimize energy
consumption. Finally, this work can be extended to consider
the sliding STM, so demand start times can be optimally
adjusted, to further reduce energy costs.
