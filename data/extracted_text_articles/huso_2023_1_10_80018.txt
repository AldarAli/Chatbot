Abstract— The growth of social networking sites, coupled with 
the widespread use of mobile technology, has led to the spread 
of various forms of toxicity. Although social media platforms 
provide valuable tools for meaningful interactions, political 
arguments, often fraught with complex mix of emotions, can 
quickly devolve into flame wars or partisan bickering. This 
article shifts attention eastward to examine how the 
media/information environment is being manipulated for 
advancing political agendas in the Indo-Pacific region. We 
analyzed 3,239,249 tweets discussing issues related to China and 
Uyghur. We explained the user relation phenomena by assessing 
their emerging social structures. We extracted influential topics 
using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling 
approach. Toxicity analysis and bot assessment were performed 
to examine the nature of discourse about the China and Uyghur 
issues. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between tweets 
with high toxicity and bot activity, particularly in relation to 
emerging events such as the existence of internment camps and 
news about forced Uyghur laborers in China and the Chinese 
Communist Party network.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
China has been in the global spotlight for its economic 
strategies, 
investments 
acquisitions, 
and 
policy 
reinforcement. However, recently, China’s reputation has 
been globally questioned for its targeted, inhumane, and 
oppressive policies towards the Uyghur population in 
Xinjiang [1]. From a geographical standpoint, Xinjiang is an 
autonomous region that measures one-sixth of China’s 
western border and home to a Chinese Ethnic-Muslim 
minority. From a political perspective, Xinjiang houses an 
extensive potential for mineral exploitation in natural 
resources, such as oil, gas, and agricultural production [2]. 
China’s Uyghur conflict has existed for decades; its 
universal debate however, has recently surfaced with the 
unprecedented evolution of online social networks. Although 
religious beliefs, customs, and practices have been tolerated 
in China to some extent, the degree of tolerance has varied 
considerably from time to time with the change in the 
political climate [3]. The use of coercion is not uncommon in 
Chinese history as far as religious groups are concerned [4]. 
Extant literature has shown that policies towards Xinjiang are 
similar to the policies that were directed towards Tibet [4]. 
To cope with these policies, the Uyghur group attempted to 
separate themselves from the Chinese government and 
develop their own identity [4]. This independent movement 
threatens the viability of the unified communist system 
established by the People’s Republic of China [1]. 
It is pertinent to study the China Uyghur conflict as it 
highlights the connection between a strong authoritarian 
state, a terrorist threat, and a minority group [5]. However, 
the implications of these dynamics are potentially far-
reaching, as they promise to complicate China’s rise in 
central Asia. Many western literatures describe Chinese 
politics as authoritarian; while this view is not inaccurate, it 
is incorrect to assume that Chinese citizens have been content 
to be despotically ruled [6]. As a multi-ethnic state with a vast 
majority of Han Chinese and various minorities, the Chinese 
government considers any nationalist or independence 
movements as an attack towards China’s unified communist 
system and economic growth [7]. 
There are significant scholarly works on leveraging the 
Internet to gain more, and better information. Despite these 
possibilities, extant literature has shown that algorithmic and 
filtering features of social media platforms have driven users 
to an “echo chamber” whereby they are exposed to more of 
what they want and like, as opposed to what they need or 
should see [8][9]. This can shift their narratives on world 
issues as users disregard any narrative about topics that are 
ideologically unpleasant. The pervasiveness of partisan 
animosity on social media also exacerbates this issue [5]. 
Researchers have attempted to assess the definition and 
representation of identities and the leveraging power of 
minorities versus a superior state in the negotiation process 
[5], [10]. The research in [11] concluded that the approaches 
utilized by both parties in the ‘David and Goliath’ duel for a 
contested region mostly affect the minority group due to low 
availability of resources and strategies. 
This article will firstly offer theoretical background about 
this topic, and then engage in turn with how we leveraged 
topic modeling, toxicity analysis and bot assessment to 
understand the China-Uyghur issue. The remainder of the 
article is structured as follows. In section II, a few extant 
literature and analytical frameworks relating to China and 
Uyghur issues are reviewed. Next, the empirical study and 
the findings are discussed in Section III. Lastly, we discuss 
conclusions, limitations, and directions for future work in 
Section IV.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
This section describes the extant literature on this topic 
and the theoretical framework we used for this study. 
 
A. 
China and the Uyghurs 
It is important for the Uyghur diaspora to establish links 
with the international community and create awareness in the 
West, especially amongst non-governmental organizations 
and human rights activists, so that it can exert some pressure 
on the Chinese state to correct the plight of the Uyghurs. 
Researchers have argued that Beijing’s strategies in Xinjiang 
with respect to the Uyghur issues at the domestic, regional, 
and international levels are characterized with multiple 
contradictions [5], [12]. They further reasoned that China’s 
approach to Xinjiang domestically contributed to the 
internationalization of the issue [12]. However, others have 
argued that China faced the prospect of Xinjiang becoming 
its own West Bank if it fails to re-strategize to a softer 
approach to integrate the region [12]. They argue that China 
has explicitly framed episodes in world events such as the 
9/11 crisis to shift the narratives towards Uyghur rebellion as 
“terrorism” and boost their international and regional 
sympathy [12]. 
Researchers have also explored how the increasing 
complexity of the conflicts between Uyghur and China 
indicates the potential for Uyghur violence to escalate [12], 
[13]. This is specifically in light of the reported inception of 
a state-initiated mass ‘reeducation’ campaign for Uyghur and 
other Muslim minorities across the province [13]. They 
argued that, by reportedly sending Xinjiang’s Muslim 
population to ‘vocational education centers,’ China’s 
attempts to ‘prevent extremism’ may lead to a resurgence of 
ethnic unrest in Xinjiang [13]. 
 
B. 
Toxicity analysis on Social Media 
Toxicity analysis has been used to understand the pulse of 
society on hot-button issues [14]. In a study conducted in 
[14], the researchers evaluated five categories of toxicity on 
comments posted on pro-and anti-NATO channels on 
YouTube. They demonstrated that anti-NATO channels 
comments were more toxic when compared to pro-NATO 
channels comments. Researchers have also aimed to 
characterize and predict the behavior of toxic users in online 
discussions [15]. They found topical predictions of toxic 
response with semantic shifts from parent comments in their 
study. Another study analyzes online toxicity with a case 
modeling approach [16]. The authors developed an 
epidemiological model to study and evaluate the spread of 
toxicity on YouTube. They applied the Susceptible, Toxic, 
Recovered, Susceptible (STRS) model to detect similarities 
between toxicity propagation on YouTube and the spread of 
a disease within a population. In another study, the authors 
evaluated the role of toxicity on tweets about societal issues 
such as the wearing of face masks during the COVID-19 
pandemic [17]. Their results showed that tweets with pro-
mask hashtags that supported wearing masks were less toxic 
compared to tweets who spread news about COVID-19 on 
YouTube. 
 
C. 
Network Analysis 
Tighter government regulations on online activities can 
make users seek a more democratic channel/outlet. However, 
Song et al. [18] found an increased success of China’s 
Internet repression where the Chinese Twitter proved to be 
small, lacking an accessible and diverse network due to 
China’s sophisticated Internet content control regime. This 
coincided with the debate on the Chinese government 
approach to public diplomacy. Huang et al. [19] 
demonstrated how the Chinese government utilizes 
communication channels, specifically a small number of 
Twitter accounts, to amplify its public diplomacy network 
and promote China’s international influence. Huang et al. 
[19] further explained that China’s robust Twitter network 
function on “timid polyphony” centered around its closest 
friends with expansion outward to include other alliances. 
Researchers have also shown how public leaders such as 
politicians utilize micro-blogging platforms like Twitter to 
gain rapid attention compared to other traditional ways of 
communication. Khan et al. [20] demonstrated that 
understanding the supporters’ network of opinion leaders 
helps in predicting the type of relationship between 
supporters of the leaders. 
 
D. 
Bot Analysis 
Bot and botnet activities have the ability to shift 
narratives, opinions, and behavior of humans, especially 
within the political landscape where hot-button issues are 
debated. Ferrara et al. [21] explained that there are economic 
and political incentives for injecting social bots into online 
ecosystems. Some bots act with the objective of forming and 
growing an audience to exert influence. Further, research in 
technographic approach argues that the agency of bots should 
be seen not only as computing units but as interlocutors and 
informants [22]. Their study of chatbots development in 
China proved that elevated disruptive technologies such as 
artificial intelligence and big data are critical factors in state 
security and narrative control in China [22]. Another study 
on computational propaganda, domestic automation and 
opinion manipulation utilizing 1.1 million hashtags on 
Twitter associated with China and Chinese politics showed a 
large amount of automation [23]. This automation, however, 
was more aligned with anti-Chinese state perspectives [23]. 
  
III. METHODOLOGY 
This section focuses on our study design, which consists 
of the data collection and approaches applied for this 
research. 
 
E. 
Data Collection and Processing 
To understand the online universal conversation specific 
to China and Uyghur, we collected data tailored towards 
2

HUSO 2023 : The Ninth International Conference on Human and Social Analytics

narratives containing a set of preliminary key phrases such as 
“China” and “Uyghur.” This allowed us to query and truncate 
our data to tweets that focus on key issues relating to both 
China and the Uyghur group. This approach functioned as a 
filter for refining our data and eliminating any term or outliers 
irrelevant to our research. We extracted metadata from users 
and posts on Twitter utilizing our in-house Twitter API 
crawler. All tweets collected were posted between 2020–
2021. Table 1 shows the breakdown of the total tweets 
extracted for China and Uyghurs, respectively.

We applied this date range based on peak periods of tweets 
cross referencing to specific events and news relating to 
China and Uyghur.  
 
F. 
Topic Modeling 
To understand the influential topics in our dataset, we 
applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling on 
the extracted tweets. We first tokenized each tweet into 
sentences, and sentences into words with the removal of 
punctuation and stopwords. Words were lemmatized and 
stemmed to their root form. The model was initially trained 
on a random number of topics and later decreased and ranked 
to the top 4 topics based on the coherence score of the topic 
distribution. Topic modeling revealed topic 1 and topic 2 as 
top topics with distinct overlaps in China narrative. Both 
topics contained trending words relating to communism, 
policing, and the Chinese Communist Party.

Topic 1 has top words such as “home” and “force” with 
highest distributions within Uyghur narrative and relate to the 
reinforcement of forced Labor on Uyghur Muslims. Table 2 
shows top words relating to China and Uyghur along with 
their respective distributions. 
 
G. 
Toxicity Analysis 
Since tweets contain a wealth of information about the 
thoughts and feelings of people, it is imperative to analyze 
the toxicity of tweets discussing China-Uyghurs conflicts. By 
definition, online toxicity can be seen as any online 
harassment that silences important voices in a discourse or 
forces marginalized people offline [24]. Toxic tweets were 
evaluated using natural language processing techniques 
specifically, Google perspective API which utilizes machine 
learning to detect toxic comments and Detoxify, a pre-trained 
model trained to minimize bias while detecting toxic 
sentences [24], [25]. Detoxify was trained on 3 Jigsaw 
challenges: Toxic comment classification, Unintended Bias 
in Toxic comments, and Multilingual toxic comment 
classification aimed to detect harmful content online [25]. 
Both techniques are multilingual and offer a probability score 
between 0 and 1 with a higher score indicating a higher 
toxicity. 
 
 Final toxicity scores were averaged and aggregated 
monthly within the period of January 2020 to December 
2022. The results were then multiplied by topic distribution 
scores to get the toxicity per topic. Figure 1 shows the 
volatility of toxic tweets across the top 4 topics relating to 
China. The most influential topic, Topic 1, had the highest 
toxicity relative to other topics. This pattern is explainable 
through the semantics of trending words in Topic 1, which 
revealed top conversations relating to communist, Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP), and Chinese government. This 
signals that events in this period relating to these top words 
triggered negative interests of Twitter users which correlates 
to the high toxicity of tweets. Distinct events within this 
period that coincided with various spikes include: “The 50 
independent United Nations Human Rights experts 
highlighting their concern on the situation in China relating 
but not limited to forced labor” [26], [27]. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  China Toxicity Trend within the period of 2020 - 2022. 
Similarly, a high and volatile toxicity with noticeable 
spikes across the period was found within the Uyghur 
narrative, demonstrating an ongoing discussion of issues and 
events on these topics throughout the trend’s lifecycle. 
Noticeable events during this period that coincide with these 
topics include “Officials denied the existence of internment 
camps, or alternatively justify them as poverty alleviation and 
stability maintenance efforts” and “uncovered evidence by 
the New York Times that reveal that Uyghur laborers, many 
who are interned forcibly, are involved in making personal 
protective equipment that are shipped all around the world 
[28], [29].”

H. 
Network Analysis and Bot Analysis 
Understanding the connective relationships within both 
narratives helps to discover information flows and any 
concerted tactics about our topics. We leveraged network 
analysis tools such as NetworkX and Gephi to analyze and 
visualize social networks of both narratives [30], [31]. We 
utilized peak points found in our monthly tweets frequency 
reports to study each narrative social structure. Extreme 
overlaps were found in tweets posted within various peak 
points to news events on top topics. We discovered that the 
behavioral trend of tweets frequency in both narratives 
increased and/or decreased at the same rate. Due to 
computational expenses of running network graphs on our 
full data, we applied a random sampling technique to 
approximate the period each narrative tweets trend began 
rising. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Network of users with bot CAP scores above 0.90 within period 
of 2020 - 2021 
The China network focused on tweets posted in the period 
of August 2021 to September 2021 and references various 
events in August 2021 such as “Children of Detained 
Uyghurs parents held in Welfare schools in China’s 
Xinjiang” [32]. Additionally, the Uyghur network looked at 
July 2021 to August 2021, referencing events such as 
“president Xi praises Xinjiang armed police for counter 
terrorism effort in Uyghur territory” [33]. The biggest rise for 
both narratives was seen in July 2021 to November 2021. To 
measure the quality of division of both networks, a modality 
community detection algorithm was applied where higher 
modularity value indicated strong, distinct communities with 
relatively dense connections. The top 3 communities were 
color coded purple, green, and blue according to ranking (see 
Figure 2). A total of 16 dense communities were detected 
within a corpus of 12,292 users in China network from a 
modularity class of 0.673. The Uyghur network was less 
dense than the China network with a total of 17 communities 
and a modularity weight of 0.536 within 5,059 users. The 
majority of users within both networks had less than 500 
connections with a relatively low average degree. However, 
about 10% of these connections had a following count of 
1000 or greater. This was seen through China’s network top 
contributor @PaulS- mall4eva with 3 39,9 followers and 
connections such as @PinkRangerLB who had 100 
followers. The Uyghur network had top contributor 
@RAbdiAnalyst maintaining identifiers such as Chief 
Analyst, geopolitics, and strategy with a following count of 
255,000. 
The nature and range of bot behaviors makes it 
universally difficult to define a bot [34]. To balance false 
positives and negatives, we applied the Complete 
Automation Probability (CAP) of 0.90 or higher to raw bot-
scores to detect bots. CAP is a probability calculation 
developed by Observatory on Social Media project API 
Botometer that utilized Bayes’ theorem to estimate the 
overall prevalence of bots on a score of 0 to 1 [34]. Higher 
scores equate to higher probability of bot-like activity. Figure 
2 highlights 18 bot communities mirroring the China network 
and 3 bot communities with no relations in the Uyghur 
network, while Figure 3 and Figure 4 show bot activities 
trend co-relating to toxicity on topics within the China 
network.  
 
 
Figure 3.  Overall Toxicity vs Bot Toxicity within topic 1 about 
Communism. 
 
Figure 4.  Overall toxicity vs Bot Toxicity within topic 3 about 
communism. 
Overall, toxicity is directly proportional and highly 
comparable to bot activity in communism topics while it is 
relatively low but still comparable to topics on policing. 
These findings imply that bot activities jolted narratives 
toxicity and shifted opinions against communism issues in 
China. Future research can explore the intention of these 
accounts’ generation. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study, we examine the prevalence of toxicity in the 
China-Uyghur dilemma on Twitter. To gain insight into the 
viewpoints of actors in the network, we focus on top topics 
related to the two focal narratives and utilize network analysis

tools such as Network-X and Gephi. Our network analysis is 
based on theoretical frameworks used in previous studies and 
employs modularity to detect communities. This paper 
contributes to the ongoing research on the online dialogue of 
diplomacy, identity, and policies within an authoritative state 
and their impact on the rights of minority groups. It provides 
an interoperable methodology to understand relevant topics, 
identify toxicity, and detect top contributors within the 
network. We found that actors in the network include those 
who push the Uyghur identity conflict beyond China's 
borders, neutral actors such as news agencies, and initiators 
who raise awareness of Uyghur issues. The topics within the 
network range from forced labor, genocide, education, 
communism, politics, and policing, and their differences 
provide an overlapping representation of the China-Uyghur 
network. Our findings suggest the presence of probable anti-
China communities with top contributors and smaller 
connections discussing relevant topics. Further study is 
necessary to understand the evolution of these networks over 
time. The data for this study was collected after these events 
relating to China-Uyghur narratives had unfolded. Future 
research can investigate the use of social network analysis 
techniques to make real-time inferences about emerging 
socio-political issues.
