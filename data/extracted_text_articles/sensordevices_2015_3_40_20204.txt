Abstract—A multi-directional thermal flow sensor was 
developed and preliminary evaluation was made. The 
presented device utilizes simple manufacturing techniques and 
commercially available components. In addition, the sensing 
elements are completely isolated from the flow channel and 
therefore the device is ideally suited for a wide range of 
applications. 
Preliminary 
experimental 
results 
indicate 
adequate flow rate and direction sensitivity.

 INTRODUCTION 
Directional flow sensors are used in a variety of 
applications, including meteorology [1], avionics [2], wind 
turbine design and monitoring [3], building ventilation 
systems design [4], agricultural production optimization [5] 
and the automotive industry [6]. Thermal directional sensors, 
in particular, have been developed and studied more 
extensively since the introduction of relative silicon-based 
devices [7] and various implementations have been 
presented, introducing diverse designs in order to enhance 
sensor performance. Additional sensing elements in varying 
distances from the heater have been shown to widen the flow 
rate detection range, [8] [9], while the addition of sensing 
elements in tighter angles, as expected, provides a more 
accurate flow direction estimation [10] and the incorporation 
of more than one heater improves sensitivity [11] [12]. 
However, most of the existing implementations require 
complicated MEMS manufacturing technology and are 
relatively fragile due to bonding wire connections and 
exposed sensing elements. 
In this work a simple, inexpensive implementation of a 
thermal multi-directional flow sensor based on previously 
published work [13] is presented, resulting in a robust, 
maintenance-free device suitable for harsh environments.

PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION 
The present device incorporates a quadruplet of 
orthogonally placed sensing elements equidistant in respect 
to a centered heater (Figure 1a). This configuration allows 
for determination of the two main flow parameters (flow 
value and direction).

temperature differences measured between sensing element pairs E2-E4 
and E1-E3 respectively. 
b) Actual device layout, shown before encapsulation. The center heater and 
the surrounding sensing element pairs are visible. 
 
 
The heater is operated in constant current mode in order to 
simplify the sensor interface. The flow rate value can be 
extracted from the temperature drop of the heater, while the 
flow angle φ is derived from the differential signals of the 
sensing elements, which are correlated to the flow direction 
according to the following functions [11]:

ΔTy = ΔΤ0 sinφ

φ = arctan (ΔΤy / ΔΤx)  
 
(3) 
 
 
ΔT0 represents the temperature drop induced on the sensing 
element pairs by the applied flow (Figure 1b). The signs of 
ΔΤy and ΔΤx must be taken into account when calculating 
the inverse tangent in order to obtain four-quadrant results.

SENSOR FABRICATION 
The sensor is based on standard Printed Circuit Board 
manufacturing technology and readily available components, 
thus producing a simple, cost-effective approach with highly 
repeatable results. 
A 100μm thick polyimide film is used as substrate. After 
patterning of conductive traces and soldering the sensing 
elements at a distance of 2,5mm from the heating element, 
the device was sealed using epoxy materials and flipped 
vertically (Figure 2), thus the heater/sensing elements are 
completely chemically and mechanically isolated from the 
fluid while allowing thermal interaction via the thin 
polyimide membrane. Despite the sensing element isolation, 
sufficient thermal coupling is attained due to the small 
thickness of the membrane, hence adequate sensitivity and 
detection range are achieved. It should be underlined that 
flow is applied on the external surface of the substrate (Side 
2 in Figure 2e).

RESULTS 
Device characterization was made using a measurement 
setup consisting of a controllable flow rate source providing 
the reference flow, whereas the device was mounted to a 
turntable controlled by a stepper motor. A 30mA current 
was applied to the heater by a Keithley 2612 sourcemeter, 
corresponding to 110mW under zero flow conditions. The 
sensing elements’ response was constantly monitored by a 
multi-channel Keithley 2000 multimeter. Figure 3 illustrates 
the device response as a function of the flow, for rates in the 
region 0-50 Standard Liters Per Minute.

The aforementioned response corresponds to the heater’s 
resistance change under hot-wire principle of operation. As 
mandated by the IEC60751 standard the PT100 sensing 
elements’ 
resistance 
presents 
an 
effectively 
linear 
correlation to temperature for T > 0°C and a small 
temperature variation, therefore ΔΤx and ΔΤy in equations 
(1), (2) and (3) can be substituted by kΔRx and kΔRy 
respectively, where ΔRx represents the difference in 
resistance of the element pair along the x and y axis 
accordingly and k a linear constant factor. The device 
response as a function of flow direction is presented in 
Figure 4, where the parameters ΔRx and ΔRy are plotted in 
relation to the turntable angle in the range -180 to 180 
degrees in 15 degree steps. A constant flow rate of 40 
SLPM was applied during the directional response 
evaluation. Experimental results indicate that the flow angle

can be extracted with sufficient accuracy. Although a phase 
difference and a small vertical offset is observed in 
comparison to ideal response curves, the deviations can be 
attributed to slight asymmetries in the device layout. Partial 
compensation can be made by subtraction of the phase 
offset from the data waveform and amplitude normalization 
around zero as indicated in Figure 5. In this case, improved 
direction estimation can be obtained (Figure  6), resulting in 
a mean error in the order of ±3.5 degrees.

CONCLUSION 
 
In this research, a thermal gas flow sensor for measuring 
two-dimensional flow was developed and a preliminary 
evaluation in constant current mode was performed. In the 
proposed approach the flow is completely isolated from the 
active elements of the device. Obtained measurements show 
promising results considering the low cost and complexity of 
the implementation with a measurable flow rate range 
extending from about 2 up to more than 50 SLPM and a 
mean absolute angle error of ±3,5 degrees, after applying 
simple software phase compensation on the measurements. 
Further sensor development with improvement of the layout 
precision and additional processing of the measurements is 
expected to provide a solid low-cost alternative option, 
especially for harsh environment applications.
