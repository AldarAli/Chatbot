Abstract— Organizations are increasingly being victimized by 
breaches of private data, resulting in heavy losses to both the 
organizations and the owners of the data. For organizations, 
these losses include large expenses to resume normal operation 
and damages to its reputation. For data owners, the losses may 
include financial loss and identity theft. To defend themselves 
from such data breaches, organizations install security controls 
(e.g., encryption) to secure their vulnerabilities. While such 
controls help, they are far from being fool proof. Reducing the 
attack surface is a sound core approach for protecting valuable 
data. This paper applies this reduction to minimize the data loss 
from e-commerce data breaches. The paper first examines the 
behaviour 
of 
Business-to-Consumer 
(B2C) 
e-commerce 
companies in terms of why they collect and store personal data. 
It then applies attack surface reduction by limiting the amount 
of private data that the company stores in its computer system, 
while preserving the company’s ability to accomplish its 
purposes for collecting the private data. The paper illustrates 
the approach by applying it to different types of B2C e-
commerce companies.

 INTRODUCTION 
This work extends Yee [1] by a) relating the approach to 
attack surface reduction, b) improving the explanations 
throughout the paper, as well as updating the examples of 
breaches in Section I, c) showing mathematically how the 
approach reduces the risk of data loss, d) adding application 
examples, and e) increasing the number of references.  
Data breaches of personal data or personal information are 
appearing more and more often in the news, devastating the 
victim organizations. The losses have serious negative 
consequences both to the consumer (e.g., financial loss, 
identity theft) and to the organization (e.g., loss of reputation, 
loss of trust).  Breaches of private data held by companies and 
other types of organizations have been occurring at an 
alarming rate. Each year has been accompanied by its 
assortment of data breaches. Consider the following sampling 
of breaches in 2022 [2], the year of this work: 
• 
August, 2022: Up to 20 Million Plex Users 
Compromised. Plex offers streaming services for 
movies, music, and games, and hosts user-produced 
audio and visual content. Plex informed its customers 
on August 24 that it suffered a data breach impacting 
most of its user accounts. The private data loss 
included usernames, email addresses, and passwords 
of approximately 20 million users.  
• 
July, 2022: 69 Million Accounts Exposed in Neopets 
Breach. Neopets is a virtual pet website where users 
can own virtual pets and buy virtual items for them. 
On July 19, 2022, a hacker posted data on 69 million 
Neopets users for sale on an online forum.  The 
private data loss included name, email address, date 
of birth, zip code, and more, as well as 460 MB of 
compressed source code for the Neopets website.  
• 
June, 2022: Up to 2 Million People Compromised in 
Shields 
Health 
Care 
Group 
Breach. 
The 
Massachusetts-based Shields Health Care Group 
disclosed in June, 2022, that they had detected a 
breach in March, 2022. The loss of private data 
included names, social security numbers, medical 
records, and other sensitive personal information. 
In response to these attacks, organizations attempt to 
identify the vulnerabilities in their computer systems and 
secure these vulnerabilities using security controls. Example 
security controls are firewalls, intrusion detection systems, 
encryption, two-factor authentication, and social engineering 
awareness training for employees. Unfortunately, securing 
vulnerabilities with security controls is far from being 
foolproof. One major weakness is that it is impossible to find 
all the vulnerabilities in a computer system. This means that 
it is highly likely that a determined attacker will find an attack 
path into the organization’s system that has been overlooked 
and cause a data breach, even though the organization 
believes that it has done due diligence and secured all its 
vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, security controls do help to 
prevent breaches, and we are not advocating that they be 
eliminated. Rather, the approach in this work can be 
considered as an addition to the existing arsenal of security 
controls. 
In this work, we propose an approach in which most of 
the private data collected by an organization is stored on the 
user’s device. Thus, a smaller quantity of private data remains 
on the company’s computer system, reducing the system’s 
attack surface and minimizing the loss of private data should 
the company-stored data ever be breached. The approach also 
ensures that the needs of the company to carry out its 
41

purposes for collecting the private data are satisfied. The 
user’s device could be a desktop computer, a laptop, or a 
smart phone. The approach is intended for Business-to-
Consumer (B2C) e-commerce companies, since B2C 
companies appear to collect large quantities of personal data 
and are often victimized by data breaches. Note that in this 
work when we write about data storage on or in the 
“company’s computer system”, we mean that the data is 
stored on company premises or in the cloud.  
This paper is organized as follows. Section II looks at 
private data, attacks, and attack surface. Section III examines 
the behaviour of B2C companies in terms of why they collect 
and store personal information. It also looks at the nature of 
the collected information. Section IV presents the approach, 
including a mathematical description of how it reduces the 
risk of data loss. Section V gives examples of how the 
approach can fit with different types of e-commerce 
companies. Section VI describes related work. Section VII 
gives conclusions and future work.  
II. 
PRIVATE DATA, ATTACKS, AND ATTACK SURFACE 
This section explains private data, attacks, and attack 
surface. 
A. Private Data, Attacks, and Attack Surface 
Private data consists of information about a person that can 
identify or be linked to that person and is owned by that person 
[3]. Thus, private data is also “personal information”, and 
consists of “personal data”. For example, a person’s height, 
weight, or credit card number can all be used to identify the 
person and are considered as personal information. There are 
other types of personal information, such as buying patterns 
and navigation habits (e.g., websites visited) [4]. An 
individual’s privacy refers to his/her ability to control the 
collection (what private data and collected by which party), 
purpose of collection, retention, and disclosure of that data, as 
stated in the individual’s privacy preferences [3]. In many 
countries, private data is protected by legislation in which the 
concept of “purpose” for collecting the personal information 
(how the collected information will be used) is important. 
Companies must disclose the purpose for collecting the 
personal information and cannot use the information for any 
other purpose. Private data needs protection and must not fall 
into the wrong hands.  
 
DEFINITION 1: An attack is any action carried out against 
an organization’s computer system that, if successful, results 
in the system being compromised.  
This work focuses on attacks that compromise the private 
data (PD) held in the online systems of organizations. The 
attacker who launches an attack may be internal (inside 
attacker) or external (outside attacker) to the organization. An 
internal attacker usually has easier access to the targets of 
his/her attack and he/she may hide his/her attacks in the guise 
of normal duty. This work focuses on outside attackers. 
Reference [5] gives a good account of how to mitigate insider 
attacks.  
Salter et al. [6] give an interesting insight into what 
enables a successful attack: “Any successful attack has three 
steps: One, diagnose the system to identify some attack. Two, 
gain the necessary access. And three, execute the attack. To 
protect a system, only one of these three steps needs to be 
blocked.” Thus, an attack surface must contain a target that 
the attacker deems worthy of attack (suit his/her purpose for 
the attack) and that target must be accessible to the attacker. 
For this work, the target that is potentially worthy of attack is 
the PD that is accessible to attackers. In a computer system, 
this PD is either moving (travelling from one location to 
another), at rest (stored), or being used (by some process). 
This leads to the following definition of attack surface: 
DEFINITION 2: The attack surface for private data, also 
called the private data attack surface, contained in an online 
computer system is the set of all locations in the system that 
contain attacker accessible PD in the clear, where the PD is 
moving, at rest, or being processed.  
In Definition 2, “attacker accessible PD” means that the 
attacker is able to exfiltrate the PD using some agent of attack, 
such as malware against stored PD and PD being processed, 
or a man-in-the-middle attack against a link containing 
moving PD. Also, we assume that attackers would attack PD 
that is in the clear rather than PD that is encrypted. In the rest 
of this paper, by “attack surface” we mean the private data 
attack surface, unless otherwise indicated. Figure 1 shows an 
example private data attack surface.   
      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                             
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An alternative definition of attack surface for PD 
contained in a computer system is the set of ways the attacker 
has to exfiltrate the PD. However, given the complexity of 
computer systems and the fact that the tools available to the 
attacker to use in his/her attacks are unknown to us, it is next 
to impossible to determine this set.  On the other hand, 
locations that contain attacker accessible PD are easier to 
identify.  Since an exfiltration must be from a location that 
contains PD, the set of such exfiltrations depends on the set 
of such locations. The larger the set of locations, the larger 
the set of exfiltrations. The smaller the set of locations, the 
smaller the set of exfiltrations. Therefore, Definition 2 in a

sense includes this alternative definition, but in addition, is 
more easily applied. 
As mentioned above, in the first step of a successful 
attack, the attacker diagnoses the system to identify the attack 
[6].  A smaller attack surface will make this step more 
difficult for the attacker. Therefore, a smaller attack surface 
corresponds to higher security, which is why we wish to 
reduce the attack surface. Definition 2 also gives rise to this 
conclusion: a smaller attack surface means a smaller number 
of locations that contain PD, which in turn means fewer 
opportunities for exfiltration of the PD, or in other words, 
higher security.  
Definition 2 is consistent with the intuitive understanding 
of an attack surface (the usual meaning), which is “the set of 
ways in which an adversary can enter the system and 
potentially cause damage” [7]. Each “way” corresponds to a 
location in Definition 2 that in turn corresponds to methods 
for exfiltrating PD from the location.  
III. 
THE COLLECTION AND STORAGE OF PERSONAL 
INFORMATION BY B2C COMPANIES 
In this section we examine why B2C companies collect 
personal information and discuss the nature of this 
information.  
A. Purposes for Collecting Personal Information 
Companies engaged in B2C e-commerce, collect personal 
information for the following purposes: 
• Transaction 
Requirements 
(self-evident): 
Personal 
information is needed and used in carrying out the 
transaction. For example, making an online purchase 
requires your name and address for goods delivery. 
• Communication 
(self-evident): 
Personal 
contact 
information is needed to communicate with customers for 
resolving order issues or to answer product questions. 
• To Secure Other Data: A personal biometric is needed for 
further authentication, e.g., a voice print, prior to allowing 
the customer to access more secure areas of his or her 
account [8]. The biometric may also be required for use in 
multi-factor authentication. 
• Establishing Loyalty: A personal history of past 
transactions may be required to establish a customer’s 
loyalty in order to reward the customer with certain 
benefits such as free shipping or product discounts [9]. 
• Targeted Advertising: A personal history of past 
transactions is needed to understand the type of products a 
particular customer has purchased in the past, and thereby 
create more appealing and effective ads directed at the 
customer [10]. 
• Market Research: The personal histories of past 
transactions for all customers are studied in order to 
understand what products appeal to customers in order to 
make decisions for stock purchases, or to provide a better 
customer experience in terms of app or website design [8]. 
• Sharing or Selling: Personal information collected is 
shared or sold to other organizations for a profit [8]. 
B. E-Commerce Data 
In B2C e-commerce, online companies sell items and 
services to consumers. Example types of such companies 
include sellers of goods and services (e.g., Amazon.com), 
hotels (e.g., Mariott.com), travel agencies (e.g., Expedia.ca), 
financial services (e.g., CIBC.com), and the list goes on. All 
these companies share common data types. Each company 
offers products that customers purchase. Table 1 identifies 
the products for the e-commerce company types mentioned 
above.  
Each customer has a set of personal identifying 
information, such as name, postal address, and phone number 
that identify the customer, and depending on the service 
provided by the company, include personal information such 
as credit card details, date of birth, amount of mortgage on 
house, and so on. We group all such personal identifying 
information under the heading Customer Personal Data 
(CPD). Each customer makes one or more product selections 
and effects payment for the product(s) selected. In addition, 
there is ancillary data, such as type of payment, date ordered, 
date shipped, date delivered (from delivery agent, e.g., 
courier), and so on.  Table 2 shows these data types and 
whether they originate from the company or the customer.

We can see that each online customer order involves the 
data types shown in the left column of Table 2. Depending on 
the company, the instantiation of these data types will be 
different, with the possible exception of Amount paid. For 
example, the “Products” of Amazon.com would be different 
from the “Products” of eBay.com and the CPD for CIBC.com 
may be different from that for TD.com (another Canadian 
bank). Thus, each customer order may be represented by a 
data collection as shown in Figure 2. We wish to emphasize 
43

that there is no implied ordering of the data types in Figure 2, 
i.e., Figure 2 does not state that the data types should be 
stored in any particular order one after the other. These data 
collections would be stored by the company in its own 
databases, which may be on company premises or on a cloud 
server. If the company were to suffer a data breach, this data 
(including CPD) would be exposed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IV. 
APPROACH 
This section details our approach for minimizing the loss 
of PD from data breaches. 
A. Strategy for Storing a Customer’s Personal Data 
The goal of this strategy is to reduce the storage of 
personal data on the company’s computer system by storing 
the bulk of the personal data on customers’ own devices, 
while allowing for all the purposes described in Section III-
A to be carried out. The strategy consists of five parts, as 
follows:  
1. Identification of data (Figure 2) to be stored on the 
customer’s device: CPD.  
2. Design for linking the data on the customer’s device to 
the rest of the data stored on the company’s computer 
system: Use a Unique Customer Identifier (UCI) that the 
company assigns to each customer. The UCI is the hash 
(e.g., SHA-3) of the customer’s User ID and password 
for accessing the company. It will form part of the 
records shown in Figure 3 (shown as relational records 
without loss of generality since we could have shown 
them as other types of data structures, e.g., linked lists).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Design for enabling the company to carry out its 
communication purpose: Use the “Contact information” 
data record in Figure 4 to contact the customer, where 
“Contact information” consists of email address and 
telephone number. Figure 5 shows how the UCI links the 
three types of data records together.  
4. Design to keep the CPD record should the customer a) 
use a new device with the company after using other 
devices, or b) loses a device used with the company. For 
a), the customer can register a new device with the 
company on its website after logging in. The company 
would then transfer the CPD record from a previously 
used device (on which the customer is also logged in) to 
the new device. For b), the customer may have used other 
devices with the company and wishes to replace the lost 
device, in which case the resolution for a) applies. If the 
lost device is the only device used with the company, the 
customer would need to re-enter his/her CPD. See also 
the third paragraph of Section IV-C below. 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Enabling 
security: 
Use 
authenticated 
symmetric 
encryption (e.g., AES-GCM [11]) to encrypt the UCI and 
CPD in Figure 3(a), as well as the Contact information 
in Figure 4 (encrypted data types are shaded). The UCI 
in Figure 4 is not encrypted. The UCI and remaining data 
types in Figure 3 (b) are not encrypted, as it would be 
difficult for the attacker to use them alone to identify the 
customer, should the data be breached.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
B. Customer Walk-Through of the Strategy 
1. The customer accesses the company using its website, 
running either on a desktop computer or on a mobile 
device such as a smart phone or tablet. In the following, 
all data transfers between the user’s device and the 
company’s system is done though a secure channel (e.g., 
TLS). 
2. If it’s the customers first use of the website on this device 
(detected by the absence of the CPD record), he/she will 
be asked if he/she has a different device that was used

with the website. If not, he/she will be prompted to enter 
his/her CPD. The company then generates the UCI, 
forms the record in Figure 3(a), encrypts it, and stores 
this encrypted record on the customer’s device. The 
company then uses the unencrypted CPD entered by the 
customer for processing the current order. In addition, 
the company checks if the customer’s Contact 
information is already in the system (possible if the 
customer’s device was lost or stolen) and if not, creates 
and stores the record in Figure 4, after encrypting the 
Contact information (obtained from the CPD). If the 
customer has used the website before on a different 
device, he/she will be asked to also login using the other 
device, at which point the company stores the CPD 
record from the old device on the new device, decrypts 
the CPD record, and uses it for the current transaction. 
If the customer has used the website before on this device 
(detected by the presence of the encrypted CPD record), 
the company automatically retrieves the encrypted CPD 
record (Figure 3(a)) from the customer’s device and 
decrypts it for use in the current transaction. 
Note that the only time the company retrieves the CPD 
record from a customer device is when the customer logs 
in to do a new transaction. 
3. The customer proceeds with his/her shopping.  Once the 
customer completes the shopping, the company creates 
and stores the customer’s order data record as shown in 
Figure 3(b). Note that this record may have to be updated 
for some ancillary data (e.g., date delivered) once the 
data is available. This update process as out of scope for 
this work.  
Figure 6 shows a message sequence diagram illustrating the 
case where the customer uses a device with the company’s 
system for the first time and has not used any other device 
with the company in the past. Figure 7 presents a message 
sequence diagram for the case where the customer uses a 
device with the company that he/she has used before. Figure 
8 gives a message sequence diagram depicting the case where 
the customer uses a device with the company for the first time 
and has used a different device with the company before.  
C. Security Analysis 
We first consider outside attacks against the company. 
Such attacks would result in breaching the company’s data 
stores leading to the loss of the Contact information and the 
order data (Figure 5). This loss could be in the form of a copy 
taken of the data, deletion of the data from the company’s 
data stores, modification of the data in the company’s data 
stores, or certain combinations of these, namely copy 
followed by deletion, and copy followed by modification. 
However, the attacker fails to read the Contact information 
since it is encrypted. The attacker would be able to read the 
UCI from both the Contact information and the order data 
records but the UCI would appear as meaningless (hash). The 
attacker could also read the order data but would have a hard 
time identifying the customer using only this data. Further, 
deleting  or  modifying the data  will also fail to  damage the  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
company provided that the company is aware of the attack 
and is able to re-populate the data stores using data back-ups. 
We assume that the company has implemented other security 
measures, including making data backups and having ways 
to detect attacks (e.g., intrusion detection system). Any 
modification of the encrypted Contact information would 
also be detected by a failure to decrypt the modified version, 
i.e., the modified encrypted data fails authentication. Note 
that for the rest of this paper, whenever we refer to failing to 
decrypt attacker-modified encrypted data, we mean that the 
modified encrypted data has failed authentication. In any 
case, the probability of being attacked after applying the 
approach  is low, since  the  only  attraction  for  attackers  is

encrypted Contact information, consisting only of email 
address and telephone number.  Attacks on the company side 
could also involve malware, that for example, exfiltrates the 
customer’s CPD while in the clear. However, these attacks 
are not peculiar to the approach and can occur for any website 
that collects information from users. We assume that the 
company already has security measures for such attacks.  
As for insider attacks against the company, we admit that 
our security scheme is vulnerable to such attacks. For 
example, an insider could simply access the CPD in its 
unencrypted form. Insider attacks are always among the 
harder ones to defend against and given their seriousness, we 
expect the company to have implemented other security 
measures (e.g., [5]) specifically against insider attacks. An 
exploration of these measures is outside the scope of this 
paper.  
Attacks on the customer side with the device in the 
customer’s possession or not (device lost or stolen) could also 
result in a copy taken of the customer’s CPD record, deleting 
it, modifying it, or combinations thereof. Since the data is 
encrypted, the attacker would not be able to read the data if a 
copy is taken. Deletion or modification of the encrypted CPD 
record would be detected by the company’s system when it 
fails to find it or fails to decrypt it, in which case the 
company’s system would inform the customer that he/she 
needs to re-enter his/her CPD or have it transferred from 
another device (see Section IV-A, part 4). 
The secure communication channel between the 
company’s system and the customer device may also be 
attacked, but this is again not peculiar to the approach. Such 
attacks would be handled the same way as is done for the 
many other applications of secure communication channels. 
D. Implementation Notes 
The following are suggestions on how the above strategy 
should be implemented. 
• 
On the company side, the implementation should include 
functionality to warn that its data stores have been 
compromised when it is unable to decrypt attacker-
modified encrypted data, or when it finds its data stores 
empty. The implementation should also warn the 
customer that his/her device has been attacked when the 
encrypted CPD record was expected but is missing, or 
when it is unable to decrypt the attacker-modified record.  
• 
If the customer changes or forgets his/her password for 
accessing the service (if forgotten, a conventional 
password reset procedure would be used), the company’s 
computer system will need to generate a new UCI 
corresponding 
to 
the 
new 
user-ID/password 
combination. The company will have to create a new 
CPD record with the new UCI, and upload this new 
record to all customer devices via the website. The 
company will also have to update the UCI in the records 
of Figure 3(b) and Figure 4.  
• 
The company’s system needs to allow the customer to 
update his/her CPD and/or Contact information, and 
update the relevant records with the new information. 
For CPD, the system would need to upload an updated 
CPD record to all customer devices. 
E. Verification of Purposes 
We verify that the approach allows the company to carry 
out its purposes (Section III-A) for collecting private data. 
• Transaction Requirements: The customer’s CPD record is 
obtained from the customer’s device for every transaction 
(either pre-existing or currently entered) and is available 
for carrying out the transaction.  
• Communication: For contacting the customer, the 
customer’s Contact information (Figure 4) can be obtained 
using the UCI link from the order data records since 
contacting is done for an order issue. The customer can 
contact the company by logging into the company’s 
website. The company can determine the customer’s UCI 
from the customer’s User ID and password, and use it to 
access the contact information for the reply. 
• To Secure Other Data: The personal biometric, once 
captured, can be stored as part of the customer’s CPD 
record on the customer’s device. Once the customer logs 
in for a new transaction, the CPD record is retrieved from 
the customer’s device, at which point the personal 
biometric is available for use.  
• Establishing Loyalty: The company has access to a 
customer’s order history in the form of the order data 
records. These records (Figure 3(b)) are identified as 
belonging to a particular customer through the UCI link to 
the Contact information records. The company can thus 
establish the loyalty of a particular customer.

• Targeted Advertising: Understanding the type of products 
a customer has purchased in the past may be done by 
accessing the customer’s order data records, as explained 
above for establishing loyalty. 
• Market Research: The histories of past transactions for all 
customers can be studied by accessing the order data 
records, ignoring the UCI in each order record, since there 
is no need to identify the customers. We assume that 
market research is carried out without the CPD records, 
since the company probably does not have the customer’s 
consent for such use of his/her CPD. If the company does 
require the CPD records, the company can always capture 
and store them, but would have to accept the risks of those 
records being breached and being sued for illegally using 
the CPD for market research. 
• Sharing or Selling: There is nothing stopping the company 
from copying each customer’s CPD record and sharing or 
selling the data. The company would have to accept the 
risks of the CPD records being breached and being sued 
for illegally sharing or selling the customer’s CPD.  
F. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Approach 
The approach has the following strengths: a) it is straight-
forward, which may make it easier to “sell” to upper 
management for approval, b) it is efficient in that attackers 
would have to breach the devices of all the company’s 
customers, in order to breach the same quantity of personal 
data that are traditionally all stored in the company’s system, 
c) it minimizes the risk of data loss (see subsection G below), 
d) it makes the company less attractive to attackers who 
intend to cause a data breach due to its efficiency as stated 
above and the fact that the only private data left on the 
company’s system to be breached is the encrypted customer 
Contact information, and e) it should please customers who 
want more control over their private data, since most of it is 
stored only on their own devices. 
The approach seems to have three weaknesses: a) the 
storage/retrieval of the CPD record may attract attacks on the 
secure transmission channel, b) there is additional overhead 
cost due to encryption / decryption operations, and c) it is 
vulnerable to insider attack.  Weakness a) does not represent 
significant extra risk over conventional transactions since 
personal data is transmitted in conventional transactions as 
well. For weakness b), the extra overhead should not be 
significant. Finally, weakness c) is not exclusive to this 
approach, since it can arise wherever there are insiders. 
Potential remedies include the installation of specific security 
measures to defend against insider attacks [5]. 
G. Showing that the Approach Minimizes the Risk of Data 
Loss 
Our approach of having most of a user’s private data 
stored on his/her computing device rather than on the 
company’s system minimizes data loss according to beliefs 1 
and 2 as follows: 
 
1. Much less private data is lost in the event of a system 
breach, because the storage of most of the private 
data has been relocated to user devices, and 
2. There is a much-reduced risk of theft of the users’ 
private data if that data is stored on user devices 
rather than stored in the company’s system. 
 
Belief 1 is self-evident. To verify belief 2, compare Case 1 
where a portion of each users’ private data is stored on the 
system, with Case 2 where the portions of private data in Case 
1 are instead stored on user devices. Let D and Di represent 
the private data in Cases 1 and 2 respectively, where Di is the 
private data belonging to user i. Let E be the event that D is 
stolen in Case 1. Let Ei be the event that Di is stolen from user 
i in Case 2. Let P(E) = p where P(E) is the probability of E. 
Finally, let P(Ei) = qi . Figure 9 illustrates D and  Di . We 
postulate that for n users,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
              𝑃(𝐸! ∩ 𝐸" ∩ … ∩ 𝐸# ) ≪ 𝑃(𝐸)                      (1) 
 
meaning that the risk of theft of all the private data moved to 
user devices from the system  (Case 2) is much lower than 
the risk of theft of that same data were it to remain on the 
system (Case 1), which is a statement of belief 2 above. Thus, 
to verify belief 2, we need to prove (1). To do this, let C be 
the event that an attacker chooses to attack the system. Let Ci 
be the event that an attacker chooses to attack the computing 
device of user i. Let S be the event that the attacker 
successfully defeats the security controls of the system. Let 
Si be the event that the attacker successfully defeats the 
security controls of user i’s device. We note that  
 
                     𝑃(𝐸) = 𝑃(𝐶)𝑃(𝑆|𝐶) = 𝑝                                   (2) 
                     𝑃(𝐸$) = 𝑃(𝐶$)𝑃(𝑆$|𝐶$) = 𝑞$                              (3)

What can we say about the conditional probabilities here? 
Since D has a lot more private information than Di, an 
attacker would be more likely to choose D over Di as his/her 
target. In other words, a company is a more attractive target 
than a user device.  Thus, P(C)>P(Ci) for all i. Further, the 
attacker would be more motivated to defeat the security 
controls of the company compared to the security controls of 
the user device, again due to the attractiveness of the 
company as a target. Thus, P(S|C)>P(Si|Ci) for all i. 
Equations (2) and (3) then give p > qi for all i. Now since the 
Ei are independent events, we have  
 
              𝑃(𝐸! ∩ 𝐸" ∩ … ∩ 𝐸# ) = ∏ 𝑃(𝐸$
#
!
) 
                                                          = ∏ 𝑞$
#

                            (4) 
                                                          < 𝑝#                                (5) 
                                                          ≪ 𝑝 = 𝑃(𝐸)                       (6) 
 
proving (1) as we set out to do. Note that (5) follows from (4) 
due to p > qi  and (6) follows from (5) due to the fact that p is 
a probability with 0 < p < 1.  
Another way to reason about (1) is simply to notice that 
the product in (4) decreases monotonically with increasing n  
due to the fact that the qi are probabilities between 0 and 1. 
Thus, since P(E) is fixed, (1) will be true for sufficiently large 
n. Since we are dealing with systems that have many users, it 
would not be difficult to achieve sufficiently large n.  
We now have beliefs 1 and 2 both true, meaning that 
storing the private data on user devices instead of on the 
system does indeed minimize the risk of data loss.

can be applied to different types of B2C companies. 
VI. 
RELATED WORK 
Work that is most closely related to this work are as 
follows: Aggarwal et al. [12] propose that an organization 
outsource its data management to two untrusted servers to 
break associations of sensitive information. They show how 
the use of two servers, together with the use of encryption 
where needed, enables efficient data partitioning and 
guarantees that the contents of any one server does not violate 
data privacy. However, it is unclear if attackers can re-
construct the sensitivity associations by breaching both 
servers. Ciriani et al. [13] present what they claim to be a 
solution that improves over Aggarwal et al. [12] by first 
splitting the information to be protected into different 
fragments so that sensitive associations represented by 
confidentiality constraints are broken, and minimizing the 
use of encryption. The resulting fragments may be stored at 
the same server or at different servers. Our work differs from 
Aggarwal et al. [12] and Ciriani et al. [13] as follows: a) the 
above two papers are solutions for securing databases, 
whereas our work is focused on reducing the loss of data in 
the event of a data breach by simply not storing some of the 
data in the company’s computer system, b) we do not use data 
partitioning or fragmentation; rather, our data is distributed 
between the company and its customers from the point of data 
creation, c) we do not need to rely on breaking any sensitivity 
associations, d) our approach has been designed to satisfy the 
business needs of the organization, and e) our approach is 
more straightforward, and is therefore easier to apply. 
Other work in the literature mostly deal with the 
prevention or risks of data breaches, the discovery of a data 
breach, and the aftermath of a data breach. Within these 
categories, the most closely related works have to do with 
preventing or evaluating the risks of data breaches. We 
describe some of these papers below, to give the reader a 
sense of this research. Note that these works all differ from 
this paper in that this paper aims to minimize the data lost if 
a breach were to happen, whereas the works described in the 
following are largely focused on preventing breaches from 
happening. Panou et al. [14] describe a framework for 
monitoring and describing insider behaviour anomalies that 
can potentially impact the risks of a data breach. The 
framework also enhances a company’s understanding of 
cybersecurity and increases awareness of the threats and 
consequences related to breaches, and eventually enable 
faster recovery from a breach. Guha and Kandula [15] 
propose a data breach insurance mechanism together with 
risk assessment methodology to cover the risk from 
accidental data breaches and encourage best practices to 
prevent the breaches. They also present data supporting the 
feasibility of their approach. Zou and Schaub [16] 
interviewed consumers after the Equifax data breach and 
discovered that consumers’ understanding of credit bureaus’ 
data collection practices was incomplete. As such, consumers 
did not take sufficient protective actions to deal with the risks 
to their data. The authors describe the implications of their 
findings for the design of future security tools with the aim 
of empowering consumers to better manage their data and 
protect themselves from future breaches. Nicho and Fakhry 
[17] look at the application of system dynamics to 
cybersecurity, specifically to the Advanced Persistent Threat 
(APT) that can employ technical, as well as organizational 
factors to cause a data breach. They applied system dynamics 
to the APT that led to the Equinox breach and identified key 
independent variables contributing to the breach. Their work 
provides insights into the dynamics of the threat and suggests 
“what if” scenarios to minimize APT risks that could lead to 
a breach. Luh et al. [18] present an ontology for planning a 
defence against APTs that can lead to a data breach. The 
ontology is mapped to abstracted events and anomalies that 
can be detected by monitoring and helps with the 
understanding of how, why, and by whom certain resources 
are targeted. Other references in this category are readily 
available. 
In terms of identifying and reducing the attack surface, 
this work is unique in reducing the attack surface of a 
company’s system by storing private data on user devices. 
This author has published works [19][20][21] that deal with 
reducing the attack surface during software design, by 
identifying vulnerabilities using a model of the software 
system under development. A. Kurmus et al. [22] look at 
reducing the attack surface of commodity OS kernels by 
identifying code that is not used and removing it or 
preventing it from executing. T. Kroes et al. [23] investigate 
reducing the attack surface through dynamic binary lifting, 
removal of unnecessary features, and recompilation. M. 
Sherman [24] investigates attack surfaces for mobile devices. 
This author claims that mobile devices exhibit attack surfaces 
in capabilities, such as communication, computation, and 
sensors, that are generally not considered in current secure 
coding recommendations. C. Theisen et al. [25] propose the 
use of risk-based attack surface approximation (RASA) 
which uses crash dump stack traces to predict what code may 
contain attackable vulnerabilities. Their goal is to help 
software developers prioritize their security efforts by 
providing them with an attack surface approximation. It is 
worthwhile noting that some works propose to increase 
security through attack surface expansion rather than attack 
surface reduction. For cloud services, T. Al-Salah et al. [26] 
propose three attack surface expansion approaches that use 
decoy virtual machines co-existing with the real virtual 
machines in the same physical host. They claim that 
simulation shows that adding the decoy virtual machines can 
significantly reduce the attackers’ success rate. For enterprise 
networks, K. Sun and S. Jajodia [27] propose a new 
mechanism that expands the attack surface, so that attackers 
have difficulty in identifying the real attack surface from the 
much larger expanded attack surface. Note that these two 
works do not contradict reducing the attack surface to 
improve security, since the attack surface is not really 
expanded but only appears to be expanded due to the addition 
of decoys.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We have presented an attack surface reduction approach, 
applicable to B2C e-commerce companies, that minimizes 
the loss of private data in the event of a data breach by storing 
most of a customer’s private data in his/her own device rather 
than in the company’s computer system. This redistribution 
of private data reduces the attack surface of the company’s 
system, minimalizing the amount of data that would be lost 
in a breach. Not all of the private data is moved to the 
customer’s device since we still allow some necessary 
personal data (customer contact information) to be stored on 
the company’s system. We also verified that the approach 
allows the company to carry out its purposes for collecting 
private data, which is an important requirement of any 
company that may wish to implement this approach. Some 
readers may consider the approach overly simple, but if a 
simpler solution gets the job done, it should be preferred over 
a more complex solution. As well, a large contribution of this 
work is showing how the approach can be done securely. We 
look forward to readers’ feedback and correcting any 
inadvertent omissions, if found, in a future paper.  
In terms of future work, we would like to explore the 
application of the approach to other types of businesses and 
organizations, and adapt it where necessary. We would also 
like to have implementations of the approach in order to fine 
tune it, measure implementation effort, and check 
performance.
