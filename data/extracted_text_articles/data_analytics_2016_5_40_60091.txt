Abstract— Seaplane traffic in the European Union has been
growing constantly over the last decade. The International Air
Transport Association (IATA) predicts an even higher annual
growth rate of the seaplane traffic in the near future. The
development of seaplane services results from the capacity
overload of the existing airports and the demand for point-to-
point connections with minor destinations. Due to the length of
its coastline and other natural features, the Republic of Croatia
is one of the EU member states experiencing a rapid increase
in seaplane traffic. The state has been forced to amend a
number of acts and regulations. In 2016 seaplane service
network in Croatia consists of 16 destinations. Seaplane service
was not recognized in Croatia law. Therefore, implementation
such service needed previous revision of Croatia legislation.

INTRODUCTION
The seaplane traffic in the European Union has been
growing by 5% per year [8]. The International Air Transport
Association (IATA) predicts an even higher annual growth
rate of the seaplane traffic
in the near future. The
development of seaplane services results from the capacity
overload of the existing airports and the demand for point-to-
point connections with minor destinations [8]. The European
Union experiences a considerable increase in sites intended
for building seaplane ports, especially on lakes and islands.
24% of EU's smaller aircraft are intended for passenger
transport.
The development of the seaplane traffic started some 80
years ago, but the basic seaplane design has not changed
much over the years. One of the reasons may be the
relatively small share of seaplanes in the overall Commercial
Air Transport. Most of them have been operated by private
persons for non-commercial purpose. The ones engaged in
liner service, they have been mostly used for connecting
minor destinations and transporting a small number of
passengers. However, the advantage of a seaplane service
over a standard air service lies in the simplicity and low cost
of the seaplane port infrastructure. In addition, seaplane ports
do not charge high dues that otherwise affect the airfare
considerably. Manoeuvring features of these crafts, while on
the sea surface, are similar to those in seagoing vessels.

Across the world, there are a number of places with
extensive seaplane traffic. The examples include:
•
Maldives – where seaplane services connect
more than 40 dispersed tourist destinations with
land-based airports. 24 Twin Otter craft perform
over 150 flights daily, including scenic flights.
•
Vancouver – where Vancouver Harbour Air
Company operates 50 seaplanes connecting
Vancouver Harbour with smaller 20-minute
range destinations.
•
Sea Air company has tried to establish a similar
airline service in Greece, using 22 Twin Otter
craft.
•
Harbour Air Malta operates a liner service
between
Valleta
and
Gozo
Island
for
weekenders and businessmen, in addition to
performing scenic flights.

LEGISLATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
The transport of goods and passengers by maritime law
in Republic Croatia, between Croatia's seaports represents
the maritime cabotage that includes the coastal cabotage. The
latter includes:
1.
Seaborne transport of passengers and/or goods
between mainland-based seaports without calling at
the islands;
2.
Supply provided to the offshore facilities: seaborne
transport of passengers and/or goods between any

shelf of the Republic of Croatia;

Insular
cabotage,
i.e.,
seaborne
transport
of
passengers and/or goods between:
•
Mainland-based seaports and ports at one or more
islands;
•
Ports at islands.
The establishment of seaplane traffic has led to the
necessity of adapting the national Maritime Code and other
relevant acts and regulations as this type of commercial
maritime traffic has not been experienced before.
Croatia's legislation has been examining foreign acts,
regulations
and
conventions
referring
to
seaplanes,
including the regulations that are internationally adopted
and incorporated into the International Convention on
Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS 74), International Convention
for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL
73/78), International Load Line Convention (LOADLINE
1966), International Convention on Tonnage Measurement
of Ships (TONNAGE 1969), and Ordinance regulating
specific security, safety and other measures when handling
dangerous substances in port areas. In addition to general
national regulations, the Regulations on navigation and
order in ports specifically comply with the Ordinance on
terms and methods of maintaining order in ports and
conditions for using ports, the Ordinance on determining the
class and limit of hazardous substances that can be handled
in ports, the Ordinance on terms and methods of performing
activities in free zones, and the Plan of ship waste
management in the area under jurisdiction of the Port
Authority. Other ordinances are the Ordinance on handling
hazardous substances, conditions and forms of seaborne
transport, loading and discharging of hazardous substances,
bulk and other cargoes in ports, and on prevention of
spreading oil spills in ports, the Ordinance on terms and
methods of maintaining order in ports and other parts of
internal waters and territorial seas of the Republic of
Croatia, the Ordinance on amendments to the Ordinance on
the safety of maritime navigation in internal waters and
territorial sea of the Republic of Croatia and on the
conditions and methods of performing the surveillance and
regulation of the sea traffics, as well as the relevant
regulations
and
technical
requirements
stipulated
by
Croatian Register of Shipping and by competent authorities
of the flag-states where the above Conventions do not refer
to some of their vessels.
Because, seaplanes are crafts which are considered
being boats during manovring to the water and planes
during flying to air, new regulations must be in short
relation with international air regulation.
These restrictions and regulations can be found in:
National
regulations
are
harmonized
with
European
regulatory framework, given in this particular 'air traffic'
part by Basic and implementing Regulations (Regulation
(EC) No 216/2008, and Commission Regulation (EU) No
965/2012, Act on airports, Maritime Demesne and Seaports
Act, Ordinance on water airports.
Until 2012, the national legislation did not regulate the
sites and conditions of seaplane landing and taking off
operations, and the latter were treated as the emergency
operations.
For establishing the commercial seaplane traffic it is of
great importance to regulate the “seaports” as a dedicated
water
area
(including
all
facilities,
installations
and
equipment), entirely or partially intended for movement,
take-off, water landing (alighting) and accommodation of
seaplanes.
III.
IMPACT OF SEAPLANES AND WATER AERODROMES ON
THE ENVIRONMENT
Water airdromes have only a minor effect on the features
and the overall shape of the existing scenery, due to the fact
that these facilities use parts of seaports that are already
engaged in accommodation of vessels and handling maritime
traffic.
According to the analyses carried out by the project
FUSETRA – Future Seaplane Traffic [9], aircraft should be
more affordable, safer, cleaner and quieter in order to meet
the criteria of the environmental sustainability of the air
traffic. Sustainability may be defined in various ways, but it
is generally agreed that the concept of sustainability implies
responsible exploitation of natural resources worldwide. In
terms of sustainable use of resources, one of the EU goals is
to halve the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 2020 and
to reduce noise pollution and nitrogen oxide emission (NOx)
by 80% in comparison to the values recorded in 2000 [9].
Figure 1.
ECA Water aerodrome in Split [30].
During the flight, i.e., the period between taking off and
landing on the water, the environmental impact of a seaplane
is equal to the impact of any other aircraft. Various studies
on the effects of seaplanes on the environment have been
carried out primarily by seaplane owners [24]. The most
comprehensive study was conducted by American military
engineers (USACE) [25], concluding that seaplanes do not
harmfully affect:
•
Air quality,
110

•
Water quality,
•
Soil quality,
•
Wildlife,
•
Fisheries,
•
Hydrology.
Water aerodromes affect local surface water circulation
to some extent due to the small draft of the pontoon
infrastructure whose designed draft usually amounts to 0.35
m, but they do not affect deep water circulation at all. As this
infrastructure creates shadow and reduces the light below,
some effects on the marine life should be taken into
consideration.
The noise created under water cannot be calculated from
the noise above water because the sources are different. Air
noise primarily results from the seaplane’s engine operation
and movement of the craft through the water when landing
or taking off. It should also be noted that, unlike vessels,
seaplanes do not discharge sewage or oily waters, and that
their hulls are not treated with toxic antifouling paints. There
are no toilettes in seaplanes so that there is no risk of
discharging faecal waste into the sea [12]. Furthermore, the
exhaust emissions produced by seaplanes are released into
the atmosphere high above the sea level, thus minimising the
direct harmful impact on the marine environment [30].

Seaplane engines are not cooled by means of heat
exchangers (water coolers) as is the case in marine engines
so that there is no seawater circulating around the engines.
After the engine shutdown, the excess fuel is collected in
specially designed accumulators that are regularly emptied to
prevent marine pollution.
During the manoeuvring of the seaplane on the sea
surface, there is little or no turbulence of water at the seabed.
Therefore, the sediments on the sea bottom that some forms
of benthic life depend upon are not disturbed [24].
The impact of a seaplane on the mechanical properties of
the sea mass is negligible due to the fact that the craft’s
entire propulsion system is above the water level.
The most common jet fuel used by seaplanes is JET A1.
According to its chemical composition, JET A1 is the
kerosene grade fuel (refined paraffin). This fuel is stable
when properly stored and used, i.e. when not exposed to heat
sources,
flames,
sparks
and
excessive
temperatures.
Incomplete
combustion
may
result
in
CO
(carbon
monoxide), SOx (sulphur oxides) or H2SO4 (sulphuric acid)
[19].
Jet A1 fuel is produced in compliance with international
standards with a flashpoint above 38°C and the lowest pure
point temperature of - 47°C [27].
In the Republic of Croatia, fuel bunkering is defined and
regulated by Ordinance on handling hazardous substances,
conditions and forms of seaborne transport, loading and
discharging of hazardous substances, bulk and other cargoes
in ports, and on prevention of spreading oil spills in ports
(Official Gazette: 51/05, 127/10, 34/13, 88/13), Ordinance
on terms and methods of maintaining order in ports and
other parts of internal waters and territorial seas of the
Republic of Croatia (Official Gazette 90/05), and by
Ordinance on water airports (Official Gazette 36/14).
Standards for emissions from aircraft are internationally
defined and incorporated into the legislation of each member
state of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
[28]. Article 123 of Croatia’s Air Transport Act (Official
Gazette: 69/09, 84/11, 127/13) states that “noise and exhaust
gases produced by a taking-off and landing aircraft must be
below maximum allowed limits for the noise level and
exhaust gases, as defined by ordinances referring to this Act
111

and complying to the relevant EU regulations”. Presently,
Croatia’s legislation does not contain regulations defining
maximum levels of exhaust gases produced by aircraft, but
the Air Protection Act (Official Gazette: 130/11, 47/14) and
related sub-law regulations have been harmonised with the
effective EU’s Directive 2008/50/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on ambient
air quality and cleaner air for Europe [28].

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),
through
the
Committee
on
Aviation
Environmental
Protection (CAEP) responsible for defining regulations and
new standards related to noise and emissions from aircraft,
has made efficient efforts in further reduction and restriction
of emissions produced by aircraft engines which harmfully
affect the environment [28].
As a member of ICAO, Croatia is obliged to comply with
the standards described in the Book II of the Annex 16 to the
ICAO Convention on International Civil Aviation [16].
These standards define the limits that the aircraft engines
have to meet regarding the emissions of nitrogen oxides
(NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds
(VOC) and smoke point. The standards do not define the
limits for particulate matter (PM) that also results from fossil
fuel combustion, but there are a number of states whose
national legislation define the boundary limits for PM as
well.
Fuel consumption of seaplanes per minute of flight is
larger than fuel consumption in seaborne vessels, and the
emission of CO2 is larger correspondingly [9]. However, the
distance covered by seaplanes per minute is much greater.
The distance of 100 nautical miles is covered by a seaplane
operating in Europe in 60 minutes, whereas an average fast
surface vessel would take 180 minutes [16].
The introduction of a new seaplane service increases the
overall seaport traffic and exhaust emissions, and yet this
harmful influence on the environment is not enough strong to
compromise the air quality. Furthermore, seaplanes use JET
A-1 fuel (kerosene) that does not contain some of the volatile
organic compounds (VOC) that are present in marine heavy
fuel oils. Jet fuel also contains less sulphur so that,
correspondingly, smaller SOx emissions are recorded.
One of the major obstacles to the growth of seaplane
services is insufficient familiarization with the environmental
impacts of this form of transport. The ICAO, through the
already mentioned Committee on Aviation Environmental
Protection (CAEP), has been efficient in further reduction
and restriction of noise produced by aircraft engines, which
harmfully affects the environment [28].
Graph 2. Exposure to noise over 65 dB in the European Union [29]
According to the data presented by the European
Commission, only 1% of noise over 65 dB is created by air
traffic, while the share of road traffic amounts to 90% [29].
The major problem is the noise produced by seaplanes
during taking off and landing operations. The noise is
estimated at 75 dB (A), i.e. well over ambient noise. Taking
into consideration that during these relatively short periods a
seaplane creates more noise than a vessel under way, the
take-off/landing zone should be designed in such a way that
flying over inhabited areas at low height is avoided. Evans
[7] measured the noise produced by a 650 ccm Kawasaki
scooter; the noise amounted to 83 dB (A) at low speeds and
112

up to 90 dB (A) at high speeds [7]. Examples of various
noise levels are shown in Table 4.

The noise level produced by seaplanes is higher than the
noise levels for other surface vessels but is not within the
range that is considered harmful [9]. Regulation on the
maximum permissible noise levels in the environment in
which people work and live (Official Gazette 145/04)
defines 5 noise zones, depending on their purpose and time
during the day. These levels are shown in Table 5.
Maximum noise load in Croatia is expected during tourist
season. Presently the seaplane operations are scheduled only
during daytime so that the annoying noise levels are avoided
at night. Increased seaplane noise is produced only during
taking off and landing. As these operations are performed at
the regulatory distance of 300 meters off the coast, it can be
concluded that the noise does not considerably affect the
observed area.
IV.
IMPACT OF SEAPLANES ON SAFETY
In Europe, there are various regulations governing the
seaplane traffic. Many of them are rather strict, particularly
with regard to the safety and environment preservation. In
many countries these regulations have become obsolete and
are neither in line with demands for seaplane services nor in
line with the latest seaplane aviation technologies [4].
•
Major obstacles to the development of seaplane
traffic arise from:
•
Prejudice and public perception regarding the safety
of maritime traffic,
•
Strict regulations, and
•
Inability
to
build
infrastructure
for
seaplane
accommodation.
Seaplane traffic is governed by regulations on seaborne
and
airborne
transport.
According
to
the
COLREGS
[1][2][7] definition, a seaplane is a craft designed for
manoeuvring in air and on water surface. There has been a
significant growth in the development of seaplane services
over the last five years, particularly in the USA, Canada and
Australia
[20].
Pontoons
and
jetties
for
seaplane
accommodation have been increasingly built in China as
well. The great demand for seaplane services has resulted in
a number of projects and studies related to seaplane traffic,
in particular regarding the effects of seaplane traffic on the
maritime traffic in ports.
FUSETRA identified the requirements for seaplanes,
passengers, operators and manufacturers in Europe. With
reference to the FP5 project, concluded that the seaplane
traffic in Europe has a great potential due to the development
of Europe’s transport network and the abundance of rivers,
lakes and islands. He established the standards for 11 major
Polish ports capable of accommodating seaplane [9].
In 1994, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
released the Advisory Circular for seaplane bases and
associated facilities, replaced by the amended Advisory
Circular in 2013 [16]. When discussing the safety of
navigation of seaplanes and vessels in ports, the collision
risks can be analysed by using DEMETEL method [15],
[23]. So far, only partial studies on seaplane traffic and its
effects on maritime traffic have been published. They use the
simulation of traffic flow in ports by applying queueing
theory [4], [6] multiple factor method and the simulation of
dominance by applying Arena software for simulating
heterogeneous traffic of vessels and seaplanes. The principle
of analysing individual system components [7], [8], [9] and
other theories and methods were also used. So far, the only
licensed seaplane operator in the Republic of Croatia is
European Coastal Airlines (ECA). The company has more
than 200 employees. Its fleet consists of eight De Havilland
Twin Otters and one Grumman G 21 Goose. Twin Otter
seaplanes connect over 16 destinations in Croatia and Italy
(Figure 23) and the corporate plans include expanding of
operations to Montenegro and Albania. In 2015, ECA
performed 24,000 flights transferring 221,000 passengers
[30].
Canadian De Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter is a STOL
(Short Take-off and Landing) (Figures 3 and 4) seaplane
manufactured by Viking Air Company. It has been designed
to carry passengers and/or cargo, and is able to perform
landing and take-off operations using floats, wheels or skis.
It has been the best-selling passenger seaplane model ever,
able to accommodate 19 passengers.

Seaplane navigation performance is observed through:
•
Manoeuvrability, and
•
Traffic features.
Manoeuvring performance of seaplanes during taxiing is
similar to the performance of surface vessels, but it differs
considerably during take-off and landing operations.
Cruise speed during take-offs and landings ranges from
40 to 108 knots). Compared to the speed of vessels when
approaching or leaving port (5-10 knots), it is obvious that
the seaplane speed during take-off and landing operations is
about 10 times higher than in boats and ships. Given the
seaplanes’ high speeds in a relatively confined area, it is
important to give way to seaplanes when performing these
operations. Taking off operations take place at the distance
of 350 m from the area allocated for manoeuvring [2][3].

Figure 4. Dimensions of the DHC-6 Twin Otter’s wing span and propellers. [13]
When performing take-off and landing over the areas
intended for such operations in Croatia, seaplanes do not
comply with the regulations on general restrictions of speed,
otherwise imposed on surface vessels. If the seaplanes
perform commercial air service they can take off or land only
in the area allocated for these operations, i.e., at least 300
meters off the coats, except in case of emergency or force
majeure.
Landing and take-off operations are usually allowed only
during daylight, in suitable meteorological conditions that
ensure good visibility. All participants in maritime traffic
within the seaplane landing and take-off areas have to
manoeuvre with caution. All vessels, yachts and boats with
or without mechanical propulsion have to leave the area
dedicated to take-off and landing of seaplanes not later than
30 minutes before these operations take place, and act
according to the instructions given by the seadrome operator
who is authorised to ensure and take adequate security and
safety measures in line with relevant statutory regulations.

properly

with

buoys,
daybeacons and daymarks in compliance with specific
regulations and is marked in navigation charts issued in
official maritime publications.
The wind strength and direction affect the seaplane’s
movement during take-off and landing operations. Windward
take-off (towards the wind) considerably reduces the take-off
distance. A DHC-6 Twin Otter typically requires 374 meters
for taking off (Table 6), 300 meters for landing operation and
40-80 meters for stopping after touching the water. The
seaplane may extend the stopping distance on the water to
reduce
hull
stress
and
improve
passengers’
comfort.
However, in emergency the craft is able to come to a halt 40
meters after touching the water surface. Strong winds and
waves higher than 1.5 m may impede landing and take-off
operations [5]. Turning the seaplane on the water is
performed by means of the rudder and engines. As the DHC-
6 Twin Otter is a double-engine craft, the rudder is fitted to
the seaplane’s tail but the two controllable pitch propellers
ensure excellent manoeuvrability.

DHC-6 Twin Otter has been developed throw navigation
equipment in period
since it has been in operation.
According to graph 3, the number of accident rapidly grow
up, but this trend is followed by increasingly number of
seaplanes in operation and increasing number of traffic in
water aerodromes and airports.
According to Table 7, it might be concluded that most of
accident are happening on airports. This type of airplane is
easy and under influence of wind, especially during landing.
Statistics show that victims were only in cases of dropping of
seaplanes.
From the
Table 8 it can be concluded that the annual
average occur around 2 accidents with fatal consequences for
the entire world fleet of Twin Otter DHC 6-300 / 400 , for
different purposes and design. Given the number of aircraft it
gives the approximate probability of an accident with fatal
consequences about 3x10-3 per year per aircraft. Most of the
accidents is a result of failures, strikes, adverse weather
conditions, and mostly occur during landing and take-off.
Collisions with ships not registered in the records of
accidents [11].

CONCLUSION
Croatia is one of the first EU member states which
launched the commercial seaplane service as a faster
alternative way to reach destinations inland and abroad.
However, this service is not public and it is used mostly
during summer season. Other EU states with similar
experience include Poland, Denmark and Greece. The
limiting factors for the development seaplane traffic in the
Republic of Croatia included insufficient information and
familiarization
with
this
type
of
transport
that
was,
consequently, not recognized by the national legislation.
However, over the last years, Croatian legislation has
introduced a number of regulations and ordinances in order
to create legal framework for seaplane traffic operations, in
particular related to the entrance of seaplanes into ports, their
landing, taxiing and taking off within port areas and the
construction of seaports.
After
years
of
legislation
and
investment
issues,
European Coastal Airlines became the first licensed seaplane
operator in Croatia. In addition to the national and local
governments,
the
venture
was
supported
by
the
AdriSeaplanes project co-funded by the European Union and
the IPA – Adriatic Cross-Border Cooperation Program.
European Coastal Airlines presently maintains regular flights
connecting 16 destinations in Croatia and Italy, and plans to
expand operations over the rest of the Adriatic Sea by
establishing seaports in Montenegro and Albania.
Various studies and research conducted across the world
indicate that the seaplane traffic is safe and not presenting a
serious threat to the air and marine environment. The
development of this type of transport and the increasing
demand indicate that the seaplane traffic is likely to grow
considerably in the coming years, for the benefit of holiday-
makers and the residents of 66 inhabited islands of Croatia.
