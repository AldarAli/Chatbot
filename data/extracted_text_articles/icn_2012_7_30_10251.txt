Abstract—Link state protocol-driven wireless mesh networks
are known for their ﬂexible and highly scalable structure, due
to a high degree of individuality, in terms of routing table gen-
eration in each connected node. QoS-focused research allows
these nodes now to make accurate next-hop decisions based
on QoS-sensitive routing metrics. This development enables
signiﬁcantly improved QoS-performance on the network layer.
To further adapt link cost calculation to QoS-demands posed
by digital media services on higher layers, we propose the
Selective Link Cost Alteration (SLCA) scheme, which includes
resource reservation demands into the process of neighbor link
evaluation, in a distributed fashion. SLCA’s goal is to avoid
that best effort packets competing with a protection-worthy
QoS stream, therefore routing conditions are altered in order
to keep the best available path free for QoS-related packets.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) based on IEEE 802.11
W-LAN links have long passed the border to offer simple
connectivity between wireless nodes and gateways, since
a lot of valuable research has been conducted on this
ﬁeld. Due to these improvements, mostly achieved by well
supported mesh routing protocols, research on WMNs now
merely concentrates on bringing efﬁcient Quality-of-Service
(QoS) approaches to WMNs. To create digital media-ready
WMNs is the next important step in WMN research, to
ﬁnally satisfy also consumer demands on modern wireless
networks. Integrated QoS enables to handle high deﬁnition
content and real time communication, without forcing real-
time trafﬁc to compete with best effort trafﬁc on a shared
medium. Besides classic approaches to encounter QoS prob-
lems, such as bandwidth shaping of disturbing trafﬁc or
packet prioritization in the MAC layer, WMNs offer a third
highly effective feature: rerouting. In the best case, several
routes are available to a destination. This allows to chose a
different route for QoS streams in order to avoid bottlenecks
or saturated links, or even bypass disturbing trafﬁc to the
second-best path, in order to keep the best path “clean”
for QoS-related packets. In practice, classic destinations are
merely gateways to external host networks, such as the
Internet. Intra-mesh client trafﬁc is less common.
The most common approach to improve QoS support in
mesh clouds or backbones is by implementing more so-
phisticated routing metrics. Often cross-layer architectures,
which include channel usage and congestion information are
used. Since the presented approach is based on, respectively
extends the popular Optimized Link State Routing Protocol
(OLSR) [1], one of the ﬁrst QoS-favored routing metrics to
consider would be the Expected Transmission Time (ETT).
It’s a combination of the standard Expected Transmission
Count (ETX) metric [1] and the actual bandwidth of a link.
Bandwidth, a crucial factor for QoS, is determined via a
packet-pair technique [2] within ETT. But making a node
aware of such complex link state parameters sometimes
comes with a conceptual misbehavior of the load distribu-
tion: when more than one next hop is available towards a
destination, the entire load (QoS- and potentially disturbing
best-effort trafﬁc) tranceived by one of the two end-to-end
communication partners, will ﬁrst be routed towards the best
link until it gets saturated and available bandwidth decreases.
With ETT then link cost increases due to the usage of the
link, which results in a load shift to the next best next-hop.
After a while the ﬁrst link recovers, the load shifts again
and the ﬁrst link is used anew. This results in an oscillating
load shift between two next-hops. Such issues make load
distribution unpredictable in a larger network scale.
We propose a novel Selective Link Cost Alteration (SLCA)
scheme with n metric alterations resulting in n routing
table variations, which exploits the initially described rerout-
ing ability by distributing reservation messages along the
network to reserve concrete bandwidth resources between
a source and a destination. Packets not belonging to a
reservation are urged to take the next best path. SLCA
also solves the described ’load oscillation issue right from

the start, since several paths are used simultaneously, if
available.
This paper is structured as followed: Section 2 deals with
other research work related to SLCA. Section 3 summarizes
the system model. Both Section 4 and 5 then deal with the
impact of SLCA. Section 4 depicts SLCA basic algorithm
in a concrete example, whose measurement results are
summarized in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the work;
Section 7 outlines future SLCA improvements.
II. RELATED WORK
Exploiting path diversity with parallel transmissions from
a source to a destination is a widely discussed research
topic. It has led to a fair amount of multi-path routing
protocols in the past few years. One of the more recent ones,
developed by Hu et al. [3], is named Multi-Gateway Multi-
Path Routing Protocol (MGMP) and extends the Hybrid
Wireless Mesh (single path) Protocol (HWMP), which was
included in the IEEE 802.11s draft. Their research reveals
that using multiple paths to a destination clearly improves
QoS parameters such as throughput, delay and packet loss.
Similar to standard OLSR and OLSR with SLCA extension,
Ghahremanloo [4] compares the standard Ad-hoc On De-
mand Vector (AODV) protocol with its multi-path version
Ad-Hoc On Demand Multi-Path Distance Vector (AOMDV).
He comes to the conclusion that AOMDV outperforms
single-path AODV in terms of total throughput and end-to-
end packet delay. Path diversity was a strong motivation for
the SLCA development, but rather in a way that the best path
shall be blocked for a priority QoS stream so that alternative
paths remain for other trafﬁc. This led to the inclusion of
distributed reservations. An initial motivation to investigate
routing metric manipulation and link cost alteration was to
merge the receiver-initiated Resource Reservation Protocol
(RSVP) [5] with the layer 3 routing engine: instead of pure
resource reservation through bandwidth reduction of non-
reserved trafﬁc along a single path, the impact of using
rerouting capabilities for such trafﬁc in every node is inves-
tigated here. Concerning RSVP QoS levels, SLCA applies
rate-sensitive reservations. K¨ohnen et al. extended the RSVP
concept in a broad manner with their QoSiLAN approach
[6]. QoSiLAN aims on providing access technology/layer 2
independent and self-organized QoS resource reservations,
in originally unmanaged heterogeneous single path LAN net-
works. QoSiLAN is server-based and relies on collaborative
bandwidth shaping of all hosts involved in a packet stream.
A host generates an end-to-end reservation message and uni-
casts it to a control server (QoSiLAN manager). This server
proactively monitors the network topology and advises all
involved hosts of this stream/path to lower the bandwidth
of their ongoing processes, in order to keep free the to-be-
reserved resource, on a per link basis. The QoSiLAN system
includes monitoring and classiﬁcation for outgoing trafﬁc,
using a variation of the Statistical Protocol IDentiﬁcation
(SPID) algorithm [7] and optionally deep packet inspection
features. Such a capability describes a mandatory compo-
nent for SLCA-ready OLSR-based wireless mesh networks,
since actual bandwidth demands of services have to be
identiﬁed by the originator node. Still, this feature is not
included; SLCA furthermore offers a QoS framework for
networks, which support QoS-trafﬁc detection and classiﬁ-
cation. SLCA now extends the QoSiLAN scheme, in a way
that bandwidth used for non-reserved trafﬁc does not have
to be lowered by involved nodes, as it is necessary in single-
path Ethernet or infrastructure networks, where mostly only
one path is available. Furthermore SLCA reroutes those
packets, if several paths are available. Also, a distributed
solution is preferred to a central one, since it better suits
the ad-hoc character of a mesh network. Routing topology
consistency across the entire mesh network is a crucial
deployment factor for SLCA. It relies on all mesh nodes
to individually calculate and maintain the same topology, all
with the same link cost values. A condition, which is favored
by increasing the OLSR Topology Control (TC) message
interval, or by using the OLSR ﬁsheye algorithm [1]. Couto
et al. deal with the problem of routing table inconsistency
due to high OLSR signaling packet loss rates, which might
have a severe impact in large-scale mesh networks. For
instance, different views on the real topology might lead
to routing loops. To further increase common routing table
stability, they propose to include control packet loss rates in
the development of new routing metrics. Furthermore, the
level of inconsistency in routing tables may be increased
by adding receive-acknowledgments for topology control
updates to new routing protocols.
III. ROUTING TABLE MANAGEMENT
A. Concept
The proposed system follows a distributed policy-based,
or more precisely said, a reservation-based routing approach,
implemented in the mesh protocol. A reservation message
basically contains the regarding source and destination sock-
ets, the to-be-reserved bandwidth plus ﬂow identiﬁcation and
may be initiated by any single service running on any node
in the mesh cloud and is valid for an entire path. The residual
bandwidth always remains available for other trafﬁc. Every
node individually increases selected link costs on the best
path between the source and the destination (their addresses
are included in a reservation rn), according to the demanded
bandwidth value. n is the reservation index. This virtually
increases the overall cost of the to-be-reserved path. Routing
decisions for packets, which match rn will not be affected
by this alteration and therefore will favor the best route/next
hop. Routing decisions for all other packets will see the
reserved route as virtually burdened. Thus, a rerouting of
potentially disturbing trafﬁc is facilitated, no matter if such
trafﬁc occurs or not; a contribution to the proactive character
of OLSR. Each new reservation n takes up the routing table
154

valid during the previous reservation rn−1 and adds new
routing entries for the affected source and destination nodes,
according to the demanded resources in rn.
If the route with the best conditions (when considered in
a load-free state) between a source and a destination is now
already loaded with other trafﬁc before rn is distributed,
rerouting this non-reserved trafﬁc to alternative routes is
facilitated, instead of forcing the QoS-trafﬁc of rn to take
less loaded paths. If the overall path capacity, partially used
by a running stream of an active rn suddenly decreases due
to changing link conditions, it is probable that best effort
trafﬁc using the same route is shifted to other routes, before
the entire load (including rn trafﬁc) would eventually be
rerouted. Such load shifting aspects fundamentally differ
from those of existing mesh routing concepts.
It is important to notice that SLCA does not describe a
full multi-path system, since packets of a single reservation
will never be scheduled over multiple paths simultaneously.
It is possible and intended though, that best effort trafﬁc to
a common destination might take a different route. Due to
stream differentiation, load balancing and packet reordering
between multiple paths, as common issues in multi-path sys-
tems, are of no importance here, since a single ﬂow always
takes a single path. SLCA combines concrete and strict
resource reservation methods, described in protocols like
RSVP or MPLS, with the dynamical mesh routing character,
represented by individual next-hop decisions made by every
node. The design reﬂects a “soft” reservation method, since
the reservation is not strictly forced and trafﬁc is rerouted
only if applicable. As an example, it wouldn’t make sense
to reroute disturbing trafﬁc over a route with 4 hops, if the
destination is only 1 hop away. On the contrary, SLCA offers
strong advantages if several routes are available, which have
more or less similar routing conditions. SLCA especially
improves the QoS level if the bandwidth of a reserved stream
is not constant during transmission, but the maximum peak
bandwidth shall still be available constantly. Details on the
SLCA algorithm are described in Section IV.
B. Requirements
There are certain general requirements for the used mesh
network. At ﬁrst, rn has to be known to every node.
Therefore, network-wide OLSR topology control messages
are chosen for distribution. Every node, respectively its
services, must be able to determine bandwidth demand for a
stream included in rn. The ability to predict QoS demands
of a service or application, deﬁne all necessary parameters
required for a valid reservation and generate and trigger
a concrete reservation message is therefore considered as
given by an external entity, module or program. Our mod-
iﬁed OLSR daemon has to run on every node, otherwise
topology inconsistency is likely to occur and routing may
become unstable, due to differing link cost calculation bases.
If SLCA is not active on all nodes in the network, the overall
routing behavior might become unpredictable. SLCA also
requires every node to have the same view on the topology,
since nodes must be able to frequently calculate the best path
between the source and the destination of rn. SLCA is only
effective on multi-hop routes, for example evoked through
long inter-node distances or obstacles. If the source and the
destination of rn plus potential disturbers roam all within
the same coverage area on a shared medium, the impact of
reservation is low.
C. OLSR extensions
Here we brieﬂy mention required additions to OLSR’s
core functionalities. OLSR does not naturally generate rout-
ing tables with multiple entries for the same target. This
ability was therefore added to its routing engine. The routing
core is now also able to process the IP source address of a
passing packet. This aspect, combined with the ability to
poll the port number from the packet’s transport header, is
mandatory to ﬁnally determine the source and destination
sockets of a packet. Finally, a new Wireshark dissector
was written to interpret modiﬁed TC signaling messages
(Wireshark OLSR message type 202).
D. Routing Metric
The SLCA scheme is compatible with any routing metric
supported by OLSR, as long as its link cost calculation
scheme includes bandwidth as one link quality parameter.
Examples for such metrics are WCETT [9], MIC [9] or ETT
[2]. For our testbed, we extended ETT (see Eq. 1) in 2 steps:
1) By replacing the bandwidth B in the original ETT
Equation with the residual bandwidth Bresidual (see
Eq. 2). This extension is already more effective than
the regular ETT, as it includes the capacity of a
link and therefore offers a more accurate picture of
the link condition [10]. In our implementation, the
necessary maximum link capacity is obtained by a
simple statistical bandwidth analysis of the link: the
peak bandwidth is measured and stored over a variable
time window. After this period, peak bandwidth is
supposed to be the highest achievable bandwidth Bmax
of the link. Each time a higher peak is reached,
previous Bmax is replaced with the fresh value.
2) By subtracting the reserved bandwidth from the resid-
ual bandwidth (see Eq. 3).
ETToriginal = ETX ∗ S

(Bmax − B) = ETX ∗

where S is the packet size in Bytes, ETX is the Expected
Transmission Count metric and B is the actual bandwidth
value obtained by link probing.

Test setup, no present reservations
Note, that the common advantages of a link cost routing
protocol still apply. If the actual link quality changes,
whether or not a reservation is active or trafﬁc is present,
it will have a proper effect on proactive routing decisions.
While using OLSR here, SLCA may be applied to any other
link state protocol, as long as routing tables are created in
a proactive fashion.
IV. VALIDATION OF CONCEPT
Here, the general steps to put a new, network-wide
distributed reservation to practice, are explained through a
simpliﬁed example. Observing only 6 nodes allows to follow
the changing routing table entries in detail. Note that this
scenario was also used for performance evaluation in Section
V. The distance between nodes is 80m, to favor a multi-hop
scenario. A solid obstacle, placed in the middle, also serves
to shape the desired topology. For the sake of simplicity,
n = 1 here. Figure 1 shows the topology present in the
network layer; The source (S) will distribute a reservation
of 5 Mbit/s for bidirectional trafﬁc with the destination
node (D). In this concrete setup, the maximum available
bandwidth per link is set to 7 Mbit/s. The corresponding
dimensionless link cost values are shown in Figure 2, with
the resulting routing table for S. The following steps are
performed:
1) S is about to start a media stream to D and generates a
reservation message mn, which speciﬁes: socketsource,
socketdestination, demanded bandwidth [bits/s] by the
stream/application/service, ﬂow ID, transport protocol
information (TCP/UDP) and DSCP/DiffServ class pri-
ority (yet unused)

2) m is included in OLSR TC messages and ﬂooded
using the OLSR Multi-Point-Relay (MPR) mechanism
3) S and the intermediate nodes 1-4 individually de-
termine the best route available from S to D. The
best path naturally is Poriginal−n−1 due to the lowest
overall cost of 3, which shall be protected.
4) All nodes change and extend their original routing
tables (n−1) by recalculating i1n - i4n and by adding
additional entries for Dn and Sn, as shown in Figure
3. Note, that intermediate nodes have two entries for S
and D, in case they forward packets (mis)matching the
reservation criteria. S and D also have routing entries
for each other, for packets between them, which do
not belong to any reserved stream between the two-
end-to-end points (e.g., best effort trafﬁc).
5) All nodes adapt the new costs for every single link
of Poriginal−n−1: the bandwidth component within the
routing metric and it’s output is manipulated according
to the reserved bandwidth. Link costs on the reserved
route are virtually increased accordingly. The updated
costs are used by all nodes to recalculate paths to all
destinations. A new topology is created as described
by Figure 4. Despite virtual worsening, all paths are
still load free. Palternative−n shall now be preferred by
disturbing trafﬁc.
6) Packets, which match all reservation’s criteria are
allowed to use unaltered routing entries Dn−1 and
Sn−1, all other packets are routed according to Sn,
1n, 2n, 3n, 4n and Dn. In this way S, D and all
forwarding nodes between them use the best route for
the reserved stream, while all other trafﬁc is urged to
not use the virtually more expensive route between S
and D, if possible. This leads to less congestion on
Poriginal−n−1, which increases QoS level on this path.
7) The media stream is running on reserved route. Even if
the load situation in the network changes dynamically,
selective alteration is always applied to changing link
costs.
8) Reservation is either actively relinquished by S when
the media stream ends, or becomes invalid automati-
cally, due to a validity time counter t added to OLSR
(soft state - S has to refresh its reservation constantly)

At ﬁrst, node S initiates a 5 Mbit/s UDP stream to node
D. After 30s, a TCP stream is initiated by S on the same
path. The intermediate nodes 2 and 4 start a TCP stream
to D after 60, respectively 90 seconds. At ﬁrst, the regular
ETT metric is used; results are shown in Figure 5. Secondly,
SLCA is applied. Therefore, S broadcasts a reservation for
its UDP stream at 5 Mbits/s, according to Section IV. Now,
the next-hops in each node are chosen on a per packet-
basis, depending on the to-be-routed packet (whether it
matches criteria described in r1 or not). The results in Figure
6 reveal that the reserved UDP stream suffers from less
disturbances by best-effort TCP trafﬁc and offers a more
stable performance, in contrast to the unmanaged OLSR
scenario in Fig. 5. Also, the two streams initiated by S (TCP
and UDP) are separated on both available routes, which
exploits the present path diversity.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
The Selective Link Cost Alteration is an experimental
resource reservation scheme for WMNs, which facilitates
rerouting of potentially disturbing trafﬁc on reservation-
protected multi-hop routes. SLCA provides a ﬂexible frame-
work for QoS-related media services in mesh networks. Its
concept is adaptable to other QoS metrics as well, since the
to-be-altered routing parameter, and its actual and required
value, might be replaced by the packet delay, packet error
rate or any other QoS parameter instead. A combination of
several parameters is also feasible, in order to enable more
precise QoS deﬁnitions.
VII. OPEN ISSUES AND OUTLOOK
As a typical problematic condition for both, centralized
and distributed reservation systems, its resources are always
ﬁnite. More than the available resources can’t be assigned or
managed. Now, research investigates into balancing a certain
threshold, in a way that reservations are denied, or not even
triggered, if single link capacities are physically limited.
Similar to RSVP, a reservation cannot be guaranteed. Con-
trary to RSVP, the initiator of a reservation is not informed
about its feasibility by intermediate nodes. It is intended
to solve this issue by adding an unicast signaling message,
to conﬁrm a reservation to its originator. Although, such
conﬁrmations are not included yet, research has shown that
alternating the link costs by considering QoS needs clearly
works in favor of intended reservations.
Future performance evaluations of SLCA will also deal
with a realistic maximum number of reservations per node.
Although the routing table management is scalable and
theoretically does not limit the amount of active rn, too
many additional routing entries for each new reservation
might result in an unmanageable routing table, or fully
occupied computation hardware. n is therefore always ﬁnite,
which concludes in a threshold for nmax. This threshold
deﬁnes the state, from where new rn (apart from pending
ones) will have a contrary effect on QoS performance and is
yet to be determined by further investigations. Using SLCA
in larger mesh clouds without scaling nmax might therefore
cause unpredictable network performance problems.
Also SLCA allows for some general, conceptual ampli-
ﬁcations. A prioritization of active reservations is desired.
In the latest version, the earlier a reservation is registered
by OLSR, the more unspoiled bandwidth resources it has
available for link cost recalculation; all following reserva-
tions then only manage residual resources. This behavior
might be replaced by a fairness scheme, which prioritizes
reservations based on certain characteristics, even if they
have arrived later than reservations for less relevant packet
ﬂows. Reservation usage feedback remains also subject to re-
ﬁnement: if a reservation is successfully applied on a multi-
hop route, it should be used by the following related trafﬁc as
well. Future SLCA versions must register if reserved packets
are actually passing; an action, which requires further cross-
layer elements, like statistical packet analysis, in a node. If
not, expected packets, which haven’t arrived or have arrived
only in unsatisfying quantities, have to be announced and
the reservation might be canceled ahead of schedule.
As our work is closely related to multi-interface, multi-
channel mesh networks [13], it is intended to include channel
diversity as another resource in SLCA, to further improve
capacity utilization in wireless mesh networks.
