Abstract—With the fast progress of wireless networks 
bandwidth and mobile devices, large scale digital video library 
systems are growing rapidly. However, the huge increasing of 
content and the data intensive nature of video make the 
management and browsing of video collections, as well as their 
search and retrieval, increasingly difficult.  
The need of having a media digital library is essential these 
days with intelligent tools for indexing the video with allocating 
the suitable metadata that describe the content of such videos 
and appropriate tools for retrieving the archived video with fast 
techniques. These will be achieved in 3 steps, working on the 
stream coding with multi bit rates and methods of handling, 
representing the video with summarized stream carrying the 
same information of the full stream and deriving a media digital 
library for indexing and retrieval process. The first step, stream 
handling, will address implementing scalable video techniques 
which set the bit rate according to the required application and 
the delivery devices. Scalable video coding offers a solution for 
meeting such heterogeneous requirements. The second step, 
video summarization, plays an important role in this context; it 
makes navigation easier and provides the user with a quick idea 
about the content. Another issue is that the same video content 
can be accessed from a wide variety of terminal devices which 
differ with respect to bandwidth limitation, decoding 
complexity, power constraints and screen size. The third step is 
implementing a media digital library for storing the code and/ 
or the summarized video based on Media Asset management 
system.  
 
The main contribution of this paper is to explore the use of 
scalable video coding and video summarization techniques to 
enhancing a digital video library and the integration between 
these 3 modules. 
Keywords-Video processing; Scalable video coding; Video 
summarization; Digital library. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, 
multimedia 
communications 
have 
signiﬁcantly facilitated and enriched people’s daily life. 
People have witnessed the fast development of various 
wireless multimedia applications, such as video content 
distribution (e.g., YouTube) and live video communications 
(e.g., Skype, Microsoft Network (MSN) messenger, etc.). As 
a result, the volume of video data is rapidly increasing; over 6 
billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube 
and more than 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube 
every minute [1]. Moreover, the increased popularity of 
mobile devices and wireless networks and their ubiquitous use 
for video recording and streaming leads to a dramatic increase 
traffic of videos traffic on such devices. Cisco stated that 
“Mobile Video will generate over 69 Percent of Mobile Data 
Traffic by 2018”. Mobile makes up almost 40% of YouTube's 
global watch time [2]. 
A. Problem identification 
Video delivery, especially, via mobile wireless networks, 
faces diverse challenges, including limited bandwidth, 
dynamic network conditions with low stability, a variety of 
relay equipment, different terminal decoding speeds, various 
display screen resolutions, limited battery capacity, etc. [3]. 
Therefore, the video coding system must encode the video 
sequence in different frame sizes, frame rates, and bit rates to 
meet such heterogeneous demands [4]. Another problem is 
that, the increasing amount of content and the intensive nature 
of video data make very difficult the management and 
browsing of stored video collections, as well as their search 
and retrieval [5]. 
B. Need for the system 
Video is increasingly becoming one of the most pervasive 
technologies in terms of everyday usage, both for 
entertainment and in the enterprise environments. Mobile 
video is responsible for a majority of the growth seen in 
mobile broadband data volume. The demand for better video 
services (streaming, storing, retrieving, browsing, etc.) for 
mobile devices is a key challenge. The proposed system aims 
to solve some of these challenges. 
 
The Middle East region, especially Egypt, has a huge 
amount of audio and visual heritage. There is a real need for 
developing a system to help in archiving digitized content and 
operate these rich video libraries with up to date video 
technologies, such as scalable video and video summarization. 
 
This paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces 
the related work. Section III explains the research approach 
and methodology. Section IV presents the proposed system, 
Media Digital Library of Summarized Video based on 
Scalable Video Coding, MDLSS, design architecture and 
discusses its modules. Finally, in Section V, we conclude the 
paper and hint to future work.

II. 
REALTED WORK 
This section will look at the state of the art of Module 1 
and 2 from the proposed system (Module 3 will be the host 
of the deliverables from Module 1 and 2). 
A. Scalable video coding (SVC) 
A number of fast algorithms of fast mode decision 
schemes have been proposed for SVC [4][6][7][8]. For 
spatial scalability, a fast mode decision algorithm based on 
distribution relationship between the base layer and 
enhancement layers is used [4][9]. 
The scheme in Li et al.[8] represents the mode 
distribution relationship between base layer and enhancement 
layer. It is employed to reduce the candidate mode set at 
enhancement layers. The experimental results show that the 
proposed 
scheme 
provides 
significant 
reduction 
in 
computational complexity without any noticeable coding 
loss.  Kim et al. [7] proposed a fast mode spatial, temporal, 
quality, and combined scalability. This algorithm is based on 
Coded Block Pattern (CBP) of 16×16 mode in current frame 
and CBP of coded best mode in selected reference frame. 
 
B. Video summarization 
Video summarization is the process of extracting the most 
important information and reduces the amount of redundant 
information from the video. The input video must be well 
processed in order to extract only the most useful contents 
[10]. But, to generate a good video summary, a full 
understanding of the video is required, which is still a 
research challenge.  
 
In literature, many video summarization approaches have 
been introduced [11]. Farouk et al. [12] the authors have 
analyzed and compared between various techniques of 
mobile 
video 
summarization 
according 
to 
criteria.  
Some examples of these criteria include: content structure, 
final summary representation, features based, targeted 
devices, summarization speed, summarization purposes, 
adaptability and complexity. These criteria have been 
extracted from the reading and the analysis of literature and 
works in the video summarization field. Here is a summary 
of the observations derived from the current literature: 
 
 
The final representation of video summarization 
techniques is a static summary.  
 
Color feature was widely used in literature to 
summarize the video contents 
 
In recent years (from 2010), there is a new 
research direction to summarize home videos 
originating from the mobile camera as in [13][14].  
 
The goal is to reduce the technique complexity 
and use it to generate an online video summary.  
 
The purpose of mobile video summarization 
approaches is usually for browsing or/and 
streaming to another device.  
III. 
RESEARCH APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY 
The proposed research in this paper will address 3 research 
tracks: 
1. The scalable video coding will target to enhance the 
bit rate transmission for spatial video streams. 
2. The video summarization will target to develop an 
effective summarization approach comparable to the 
state of the art approaches. 
3. The Digital library technology will work on 
developing a smart indexing and retrieving technique 
based on Media Asset Management concepts already 
installed in Electronics Research Institute, ERI. 
4. The Integration phase, which will work on 
implementing the work flow described in Figure 1. 
A. The first motivation of this system 
Today, there is a wide range of different devices available 
for viewing video content, including smartphones, tablets, 
laptops and televisions. Every client’s requirement differs 
with respect to bandwidth limitation, decoding complexity, 
power constraints and screen size. Scalable Video Coding 
(SVC) offers a solution for meeting such heterogeneous 
requirements [15].  
 
A video bit stream is called scalable if a part of the stream 
can be removed in such a way that the resulting bit stream is 
still decodable. The three types of scalability are [16]: 
1. Temporal (frame rate) scalability: the 
motion 
compensation dependencies are structured so that 
complete pictures (i.e., their associated packets) can be 
dropped from the bit stream. Temporal scalability is 
already enabled by H.264/MPEG-4 Advanced Video 
Coding (AVC) [17]. The SVC has only provided 
supplemental enhancement information to improve its 
usage. 
2. Spatial (picture size) scalability: video is coded at 
multiple spatial resolutions. The data and decoded 
samples of lower resolutions can be used to predict data 
or samples of higher resolutions in order to reduce the 
bit rate to code the higher resolutions. 
3. Signal 
to 
Noise 
Ratio 
(SNR)/Quality/Fidelity 
scalability: video is coded at a single spatial resolution, 
but at different qualities. The data and decoded samples 
of lower qualities can be used to predict data or samples 
of higher qualities in order to reduce the bit rate to code 
the higher qualities.  
 
This work is represented as Module 1 of the proposed 
work given in Figure 1. 
B. The second motivation of this system 
The content of video may be huge and crowded with much 
redundant information, so that it often takes a long time to 
browse the content from the beginning to the end. Also, the 
user may not have sufficient time to watch the entire video or 
the video content, as a whole, may not be of interest to the 
user. In such cases, the user may just want to view the 
135

summary of the video instead of watching the whole video 
[18]. 
 
Video summarization is a mechanism for generating 
compact representation of a video sequence, which includes 
only the important parts in the original video [19]. Video 
summarization is useful when a system is operating under 
tight constraints (e.g., limited bandwidth, watching time, or 
memory size). For example, in surveillance applications the 
video may be recorded nearly for 24 hours per day, a summary 
version of the original video may be useful to watch the 
important events 
only 
in 
such case. 
Also, 
video 
summarization is useful when we need to transmit an 
important video segment to another device in real time [20]. 
Video summarization techniques target different domains of 
video data, such as sports, news, movies, documentaries, e-
learning, surveillance, home videos, etc., and discuss various 
assumptions and viewpoints to produce an optimal or good 
video summary [18]. 
This work is represented as module 2 of the proposed work 
given in Figure 1. 
 
There are two fundamental types of video summaries [21]: 
static video summary (also called representative frames, still-
image abstracts or static storyboard) and dynamic video 
skimming (also called video skim, moving image abstract or 
moving storyboard). The static video summary is a collection 
of video frames extracted from the original video. The 
dynamic video summary is a set of short video clips, joined in 
a sequence, and played as a short video clip. Usually, from the 
users viewpoint, a dynamic video summary may provide a 
better choice since it contains both audio and motion 
information that makes the summarization more interesting 
and natural, while static video summary may provide a glance 
of video contents in a more concise way. In addition, once 
video frames are extracted, there are further possibilities of 
organizing them for browsing and retrieving purposes [22]. 
C. The third motivation of this system 
The Digital library for media file under Media Asset 
Management (MAM) system will be the main storage system 
for the processed video by Module 1 and Module 2 and will 
be based on the MAM purchased by ERI through the 
‘EQUIPME’ initiative issued by research academy 2 years 
ago [23]. 
IV. 
THE PROPOSED SYSTEM 
A. The proposed system architecture 
The architecture of MDLSS consists of three modules; 
scalable video coding, video summarization and digital 
library, as shown in Figure 1. MDLSS aims at providing better 
video services (streaming, storing, retrieving and browsing) 
for mobile devices which increase the interactions and 
activities between users and digital libraries. In other words, 
the main goal of MDLSS is to explore the use of SVC and 
video summarization techniques for enhancing digital video 
library. This goal can be further specified in the following. 
 
Design and develop SVC algorithm to meet the 
requirements 
of 
applications 
and 
devices 
heterogeneities. 
 
Design 
and 
develop 
an 
automatic 
video 
summarization 
algorithm, 
which 
engages 
in 
providing concise and informative video summaries 
to help in browsing and managing video ﬁles 
efficiently.  
 
B. The system design methods and procedures 
 
For Module 1: 
The scalable video coding has three types, namely, spatial 
scalability, quality scalability and temporal scalability. This 
paper focuses on spatial scalability. 
 
The output of SVC stage (Module 1 in the proposed 
system) is one bit stream of compressed video in H.264/SVC 
format. This bit stream has two levels of spatial scalability. 
The first one is the base-layer Quarter Common Intermediate 
Format, QCIF, and the second one is the enhancement-layer 
Common Intermediate Format,  CIF. There are seven modes 
for inter prediction (SKIP, 16x16, 16x8, 8x16, 8x8, 8x4, 4x8, 
and 4x4) and there are two intra prediction modes (INTRA 
4x4 and INTRA 16x16) based on the minimum rate cost 
equation. 
 
General adapted methods for SVC: 
1. Determine number of layers for scalable video. 
2. Determine number of bitrates available. 
3. Analyze the video stream.      
 
4. Select the type of scalability according to 3 steps 
before.   
5. Implement the scalable video types according to 
previous steps. 
 
The proposed algorithm for Module 1 achieved saving in 
time of encoding with up to 50%, and saving in time of  
decoding with up to  30% compared to Joint Scalable Video 
Coding, JSVC. This is done by selecting best macroblock 
mode.  
 
For Module 2: 
A general adapted method for video summarization 
module is shown in Figure 2. Each step is described as 
follows:  
1. Frames sampling 
The first step towards automatic video summarization is 
splitting the video stream into a set of meaningful and 
manageable basic elements (e.g., shots, frames) that are used 
as basic elements for summarization. Most of existing 
methods for automatic video summarization have focused on 
splitting the video stream into frames. The video sequence is 
decoded and each frame is extracted and treated separately 
[13].

Figure 1.   MDLSS architecture 
2. Feature extraction 
Digital video contains many features, like color, motion, 
voice, etc. Color feature is considered an important aspect of 
video. That is why it has been used quite often for video 
summarization. Color based summarization techniques are 
very simple and easy to use. However, color-based methods 
accuracy is not reliable, as color based techniques may 
consider noise as part of the summary [12].

3. Elimination of meaningless frames 
The goal of this step is to avoid possible meaningless 
frames in a video summary.  It has been generally observed 
that a video, usually, has some meaningless frames, such as 
totally black frames, totally white frames (a monochromatic 
frame) and faded frames [22]. 
 
4. Frames clustering and extraction 
The goal of this step is to group similar video frames 
together and to select a representative frame per each group, 
to produce the video summary. The effectiveness of grouping 
similar frames depends on the suitable choice of a similarity 
metric used for comparing two frames [24]. 
 
Video summarization is has been a very active research 
field in recent years due to its important role in many video 
services (e.g., browsing, indexing and streaming). The reader 
can find a comprehensive review of video summarization 
techniques in [11][25]. Moreover, Farouk [12] produced an 
analysis and comparative study between various techniques 
proposed in literature for the summarization of video content, 
which can be useful for mobile applications. 
 
For Module 3: 
In this step, we will manage video storage after editing and 
applying Meta data through the Media Asset Management we 
already have in our Digital Signal Processing Lab in 
Electronics Research Institute. 
 
V. 
A CASE STUDY OF VIDEO SUMMARIZATION 
In this case study, we show how can generate a static video 
summary from the SVC originated from Module 1. 
A. Frames sampling 
The input of video summarization (Module 2) is a QCIF 
video in H.264/SVC format. This video is partially decoded to 
select sample frames from it based on a predefined sampling 
rate. In this case study, the sampling rate is set to be two 
frames per second. 
 
B. Feature extraction 
In this case study, a color histogram is applied to describe 
the visual content of video. There are two key issues in 
applying  the color histogram technique which are the 
selection of a suitable color space and the quantization of that 
color space [21]. Since the Human Visual System (HVS) is 
more sensitive to luminance than color [17], we choose the 
YUV 4:2:0 color space and compute histogram only for Y 
(luminance) component and discard the chrominance 
137

DBKDA 2015 : The Seventh International Conference on Advances in Databases, Knowledge, and Data Applications

components U and V. The quantization of the color histogram 
is set to 16 color bins that are normally used for hue 
component aiming at reducing the amount of data 
significantly without losing the important information. 
 
C. Elimination of meaningless frames 
In this step, for each candidates frame the standard 
deviation of pixels is computed, as in [21][26]. If the standard 
deviation is very low (close to zero) then this frame is 
considered as a meaningless frame and is discarded. We apply 
this step before the clustering step (as  preprocessing step) like 
[21], which saves the computation cost. 
 
D.  Frames clustering and extraction 
In this case study, we use the adopted Zero-mean 
Normalized Cross Correlation (ZNCC) [22] as the similarity 
metric between two frames. ZNCC is widely used in template 
matching, motion analysis, stereo vision, and industrial 
inspection. Let 𝐻𝑡1and 𝐻𝑡2 be the color histograms extracted 
from the video frames 𝐹𝑡1 and 𝐹𝑡2 taken at the times 𝑡1and𝑡2, 
respectively. The ZNCC between 𝐻𝑡1and 𝐻𝑡2 is defined by 
(1).  
 
𝑍𝑁𝐶𝐶(𝐻𝑡1, 𝐻𝑡2) = 
∑ ((𝐻𝑡1
𝑖 − 𝐻̅𝑡1) × (𝐻𝑡2
𝑖 − 𝐻̅𝑡2))
𝑖
√∑ (𝐻𝑡1
𝑖 − 𝐻̅𝑡1)
2 × ∑ (𝐻𝑡2
𝑖 − 𝐻̅𝑡2)
2
𝑖
𝑖
.     (1) 
 
Where 𝐻𝑖 be the ith bin of the color histogram H and 𝐻̅ is 
the mean value of all entries of H. The ZNCC function returns 
a real value from -1 to 1. The value of -1 is returned for 
situations in which those histograms are not similar at all, and 
the value of +1 is returned for situations in which they are 
identical [22].  
 
In order to group similar video frames together, we apply 
the cluster algorithm which is described as Algorithm 1. 
 
Where 𝜀 is a threshold for the similarity between frames 
and through the experiment, we have found that the values of 
𝜀 between 0.3 and 0.7 are best choices. Finally, the middle 
frame is selected from each cluster to form the video 
summary. 
 
Algorithm 1: the cluster algorithm 
Input:𝐹𝑡𝑘, 𝑘 = 1,2, … , 𝑛  // the set of candidates frames  
Output: 𝐶𝑗, 𝑗 = 1,2, … , 𝑚 ; 𝑚 < n  // a set of  
Start 
1. Initialize j=1 
2. Loop for each 𝑘: 1 → 𝑁 
3.    If (𝑍𝑁𝐶𝐶(𝐻𝑡𝑘, 𝐻𝑡𝑘+1) >  𝜀) then 
4.         Add 𝐹𝑡𝑘, 𝐹𝑡𝑘+1 to the cluster 𝐶𝑗  //  without 
duplicate 
5.         k=k+1 
6.     Else 
7.         Add 𝐹𝑡𝑘 to the cluster 𝐶𝑗         //  without 
duplicate 
8.         k=k+1,   j=j+1 
9. End loop 
End 
.       
E. Experiments and Results 
The setup environment for testing the proposed modules 
is based on a network has bandwidth 100 Mb/s. We assume 
70% of the bandwidth is dedicated for transferring videos. 
1) Data set and testing device 
This experiment is carried out on 4 videos from the 
standard data set available at the Video Summarization 
(VSUMM)  web site [27]. Table I contains the descriptions of 
these videos. Each video format is MPEG-1 with resolution of 
352×240 pixels, 30 frames per second and in color and with 
sound. Because of the input format to our approach is 
H.264/AVC, each video is firstly transcoded to match the 
input format.

We implemented a prototype to test this case study based 
on Java platform. The JCodec library is used to partially 
decode the input video [28]. All the experiments were 
performed on a PC device equipped with an 8 GB of DDR3-
memory and Intel Core i7 processor.  
2) Evaluation method 
The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) method proposed in 
[21][29] is used in this evaluation. In this method, the quality 
of the automatically generated summary is compared to the 
users (Mostly, five users) generated summary. Then, we 
compute the Accuracy Rate (AR) and Error Rate (ER) metrics 
as in (2) and (3) respectively.

summary. The symbol  𝑁𝐹𝑀 denotes the total number of the 
frames that is exists in the automatic summary and not exists 
in the user summary. Finally, 𝑁𝑈𝑆 denotes the total frames 
number in the user summary. Both accuracy rate and error rate 
are complementary metrics and the highest quality of 
summary was achieved when AR = 1 and ER = 0. 
3) Comparison with other techniques  
In order to evaluate the quality of the proposed approach, 
we compare it with other static video summary approaches 
found in the literature. The compared approaches include 
VSUMM [21], Delaunay Triangulation (DT) [30], STIll and 
MOving (STIMO) video storyboard for the web scenario [31] 
and Open Video Project (OV) [32].  
 
The comparative results are provided in Table II. Also, an 
example is shown in Figure 3. The results demonstrate that the 
proposed approach achieved an average AR of 0.84 and an 
average ER of 0.24 with respect to the users’ generated 
summary. These results indicated that, the proposed approach 
has a balance between a high accuracy rate and a low error 
rate.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The SVC, as well as the video summarization, plays an 
important role in many video services. So, in this paper, we 
presented an efficient media digital library framework design 
of summarized video based on SVC for H.264 (MDLSS) with 
a test case study as a proof of concept. The proposed design 
will utilize the conjunction between SVC and video 
summarization techniques to enhance the digital video library.
