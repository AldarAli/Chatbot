Abstract—In the engineering field, empirical engineering
knowledge (EEK) accumulated from long-term engineering
activities is the knowledge source for engineers to solve the
innovative design and decision-making problems. Cognition
and utilization of the mechanism and rules of EEK evolution
over time are the real and urgent problems in knowledge
management and seem to lack attention from researches. To
deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel method
that abducts the motives of EEK evolution with the events
related to the evolution of EEK field, completely and clearly
finding the factors that influence the EEK evolution. An
experiment in computer-aided design (CAD) is executed to
verify the feasibility of the proposed method, and the result
shows that the proposed method can effectively acquire the
motives of EEK evolution and also be beneficial for engineers
to deeply cognize the EEK evolution.

INTRODUCTION
Driven by the rapidly emerging concepts, techniques,
methodologies, experiences and activities, knowledge is fast
maturing and mutating in this era of knowledge-driven
economy. The effective management of such evolving
knowledge is the key to maintain the competitiveness
preponderance of the organizations and enterprises in
creativity and adaptability [1]. Especially in the engineering
field, empirical engineering knowledge (EEK), which is
concluded and accumulated from engineering activities over
years, is the knowledge source for engineers to solve the
innovative
design
and
decision-making
problems
[2].
Observing the evolutional process and then acquiring the
rules and factors that motivate the process is an urgent
problem that needs an answer in knowledge management. A
proper knowledge management mechanism founded on the
answer to this question will help the intellectual workers and
practitioners obtain a deep cognition of the developments of
the engineering field in a long period of time. They could
also agilely adapt themselves to the changes of demands in
the engineering activities, and more precisely forecast the
future trends in the engineering field.
Therefore, the investigation on the motivation of EEK
evolution is a task with high necessity, yet lacking attention
from researches. To rectify this, based on the representation
of network structure of EEK field, this paper proposes a
novel event-based method for abducting the motives of the
evolution of EEK. The evolutional patterns in the EEK
evolution process are recognized and extracted in the first
step, and then abductive reasoning is used for finding the
factor events that influence the process of EEK evolution
based on the construction of the archive of collected
evolutional events. Because of the complete search for the
possible explanation of evolutional patterns and because it
offers the evolutional events in readable texts, the proposed
method will help the engineers in cognizing the EEK
evolution in depth.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces some related works of the proposed
method. The general framework of the proposed method is
designed in Section 3. Section 4 details the implementation
of the proposed method by illustrating the evolutional
patterns recognition and event-based abductive reasoning.
The example of using the proposed method to acquire the
motive events in the evolution of EEKs originated from
computer-aided design (CAD) missions is presented in
Section 5 and verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.
The last section concludes the paper with some possible
improvements.

RELATED WORKS
The theory of evolution was initially designed for
understanding and explaining the development of complex
biological systems by Charles Darwin in 1842. In knowledge
evolution, the fundamental hypothesis of a generalized
evolution theory is that the mutating internal concepts of
knowledge are chosen or eliminated in order to cope with the
rapidly
changing
external
environments,
such
as
the
demands or costs of engineering projects [10]. Although the
practitioners in the domain could perceive the evolution
process with the experience concluded and accumulated
from engineering activities over a very long time, they have
little understanding of the motives that may influence or
even determine the development of the domain, as well as
the degrees of impact brought by such motives. Taking
accomplishing CAD missions as an example, the evolution
of EEKs in CAD field and its benefits can be felt by the
engineers through the increase of work efficiency in handling
such missions. However, they know little about exactly what
kind of new process or new approach that leads to such
evolution,
if
without
the
complex
experiments,
measurements
and
analysis
conducted
by
professional
research institutions (see Figure 1).
There are few studies that focus on acquiring the motives
of knowledge evolution. Existing related works can be
categorized into three kinds: concluding empirical laws

[7][8], using statistical analysis [4]-[6] and using complex
networks analysis [3][9].
According to the observed relationships between the
phenomena
of
knowledge
evolution
and
related
modifications in the field, some researches empirically
proposed
some
reasonable
explanations
and
hence
summarize some laws of motivation of the evolution. Grebel
[8] used four generic rules as behavioral assumptions and
constructed a percolation model to empirically explain the
motivations of the structural evolution of the network of
research topics in basic science researches. Gross et al. [7]
investigated the motivation of biology ontology evolution
by detecting the changes in the results of statistical
applications and analyzing corresponding modifications in
the categories of ontology caused by new knowledge
accumulation. Using such qualitative explanations and
empirical laws that measure the effect of factors on the
knowledge evolution, practitioners could obtain a global
comprehension of the motivation of the evolution and easily
forecast the future trend of the field, but the specific
properties of the motivation (for example, involved concepts
and occurrence time) may not be clearly elicited. The
intellectual workers are still unaware of the motives of the
special breaking points of the evolution process.
Some scholars also analyzed the statistics collected from
the working process and environment to propose the factors
that influence the knowledge evolution and their degree of
impact. Erdil et al. [6] examined 14 statistics about
employee
interaction,
information
systems
and
organizational structure in the enterprises to measure the
process of technological knowledge evolution. Johnson et
al. [4] and De Noni et al. [5] investigated the factors in
social nature of online communities and open source
software
communities
separately
to
discuss
some
mechanisms that interact with the generation of new
knowledge. Generally, motives tested and obtained from the
statistical methods have rather high significance and strong
persuasiveness, but they are often the external factors that
have weak relations with the knowledge and the engineering
fields, and therefore unable to reveal the internal factors of
the motivation of the knowledge evolution.
With the proposal and implementation of the theories and
tools of complex network analysis (CNA), measurements
obtained from the knowledge networks were used to
investigate
the
motives
of
the
knowledge
evolution.
Modeling the existing knowledge as nodes with potentials in
the network, Schumann et al. [9] concluded the motivation of
evolution of the domain network with the interactions of the
knowledge nodes, including splitting of high concentrated
knowledge nodes and fusion of individual ones. Also
modeling
the
knowledge
sharing
and
diffusion
with
networks, Jiang et al. [3] utilized Exponential Random
Graph Models (ERGMs) to examine the interactions and
evaluate their impacts of network structure on a longitudinal
data set that covered 1991-2010. However, in their works,
knowledge is quantified to a node that contains little
semantic information, leading to the imperfect integrity of
their conclusions.

PROPOSED METHOD
Oriented to acquire the motives of the EEK evolution,
this paper proposed a novel event-based abducting method,
based on the network-based representation of the structure
of EEK field. Figure 2 presents the framework of this two-
step method.
Figure 2.
Framework of the proposed abducting method
Evolutional
pattern
recognition:
Utilizing
the
EEK
networks in continuous time intervals, the sorts and scales
of the subdomains of the field of EEK are firstly acquired
through clustering approaches; then the subdomains in
neighboring time intervals are numerically and semantically
compared to recognize two kinds of evolutional patterns; the
patterns are formalized with the vectors in semantic space
model for the convenience of subsequent calculations.
Event-based abductive reasoning: An archive of events is
constructed with the events that are possibly related to the
EEK evolution, and key information of each event is also
refined; then the relationships of evolutional events and
patterns are determined with cosine similarities of semantic
vectors and occurrence time; using abducting algorithm,
some events that obey the rules are chosen to form the
motives chains, and finally used to explain the motivation of
EEK evolution.

IV.
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSED METHOD
A.
Evolutional pattern recognition
1)
Representing EEK subdomain with EEK clusters
New ideas and concepts are often the consequences of the
original ones [12]. In engineering field, such relationships
are also helpful for generating the links among EEKs and
establishing the EEK networks. Li et al. [13] proposed a
corresponding modeling method. They firstly formalized
EEK with seven kinds of attributes: Engineering Problem,
Problem Context, Problem Solution, Feature Association,
Effectiveness, Contributor and Time, and then determined
the strength of relevance relationships of EEK pairs using
the supervised fuzzy neutral networks, and finally used the
pairs with high relationships to construct the EEK networks.
Although the networks established by Li et al. could fully
consider the properties of EEK and precisely portray the
structure of the EEK field, the networks are static and
unable to reveal the evolution of EEK directly. To improve
this, this paper firstly arrays the EEK with their time
attribute, and categorizes EEKs with several continuous
time intervals. Relevance relationship networks of each time
intervals are separately established and the dynamic change
of these networks are utilized for portraying the phenomena
of EEK evolution.
Different from the approaches based on complex network
analysis (CNA), when analyzing the phenomena of EEK
evolution using the proposed method in this paper, EEK
groups containing a bunch of strongly inter-related EEKs
are focused, rather than some key nodes in the networks.
This paper assumes that these groups could represent a
category of EEKs that are accumulated from the engineering
activities over a long time and verified by a large number of
practitioners, dividing the engineering field into several
subdomains. The variation of the sorts and scales of such
subdomains could quantitatively illustrate the evolution of
EEK. So, how to get the EEK groups in the networks is the
initial
problem
for
investigating
the
motives
of
the
evolution. To solve this problem, the commonly used K-
means clustering method is adopted to cluster the EEK
nodes in the networks.
In order to guarantee that the representative EEK groups
can be found and noise EEK nodes are filtered out, minimal
number of members in the cluster |C|threshold is set to reserve
the EEK clusters with certain scale. A reserved cluster in
time interval Tn is denoted as Cn,i. Only the dynamic
variations of these reserved clusters are analyzed in the
following process of the proposed method.
2)
Linking corresponding EEK subdomains
The sorts and scales of the subdomains in each time
interval can be acquired directly from the clustered EEK
network.
However,
the
corresponding
relations
of
subdomains in neighboring time intervals are unknown, and
the development sequences of correspondingly same or
similar subdomains are unavailable to extract.
This paper handles this unavailability with the calculation
of semantic relations between clusters. Specifically, we
firstly calculate the Term Frequency-Inversed Document
Frequency (TF-IDF) weights of all the concepts contained
in cluster Cn,i of time interval Tn, and extract the key
concepts with the highest weights. For a concept NP, its
weight in Cn,i is calculated as follows:

where w is a word, Count(w) is the count of occurrence of
w in Cn,i, the sum of Count(wk) is the total count of words in
Cn,i. |Cn,i| is the count of containing EEKs, which is divided
by the count of EEKs that contains w. |NP| is the length of
noun phrase of concept NP.
Key concepts and their weights are used to express the
Cn,i with a vector in semantic space model constructed by
the concepts in the corpus, namely {Wn,i(NP1), Wn,i(NP2),…,
Wn,i(NPk)}. k is the number of all noun phrases in the
vocabulary of corpus. For two clusters Cn,i ={Wn,i(NP1),
Wn,i(NP2),…,
Wn,i(NPk)}
and
Cn+1,j={Wn+1,j(NP1),
Wn+1,j(NP2),…, Wn+1,j(NPk)} in neighboring time intervals Tn
and Tn+1, semantic similarity is computed with the cosine
similarity of their semantic vectors:

If the value of cosSim(Cn,i,Cn+1,j) exceeds a pre-set
threshold CosSimthreshold, which means the key concepts
contained in Cn,i and Cn+1,j overlap to a certain degree, then
two clusters are semantically similar, hence representing the
same or similar EEK subdomains in neighboring time
intervals.
3)
Recognizing evolutional patterns
After the linking of corresponding EEK subdomains in all
time intervals, the phenomena of EEK evolution can be
quantitatively represented with the variation of scales. Three
evolutional patterns can also be concluded: expansion,
contraction and staying.
The knowledge expansion pattern is defined as the rapid
raise of EEK numbers contained in EEK clusters, while the
key concepts of the corresponding subdomain are not
changed too much. The backgrounds of expansion patterns
are often the emergence of some new concepts and
approaches, or the sudden concentration on the existing
original ones in the corresponding subdomains, which leads
to the burst in adoption in related engineering missions and
activities
and
abundant
accumulation
of
empirical
knowledge in the subdomains. The knowledge contraction
pattern is a reversed pattern of knowledge expansion
pattern. With the updating of the engineering field, obsolete
experience and methods are gradually eliminated by the
engineers, and the corresponding subdomains will also be
marginalized or even disappeared. Both kinds of patterns
will reflect the distinct changes in the evolution of the EEK
field, while the other patterns not belonging to one of these
two kinds are not considered in this paper.
According to the representations of the clusters extracted
before, this paper formally defined two kinds of patterns as
follows, and recognized them with (4) - (5).

Knowledge Expansion Pattern: if in neighboring time
intervals Tn and Tn+1, two clusters Cn,i and Cn+1,j are
semantically related, and the size of Cn+1,j are larger than
Cn,i, namely:

The degrees of scale variations of subdomains are judged
by Scalethreshold, which is a positive number larger than 1.
The sensitivity of recognizing evolutional patterns from
linked clusters is affected by the setting of this threshold.
The larger of Scalethreshold, the larger degree of changes are
revealed in the evolutional patterns, yet the fewer sorts of
subdomains are considered. For a recognized evolutional
pattern P: Cn,i→Cn+1,j, it can also be represented with the
semantic vectors in semantic space model as P={WP(NP1),
WP(NP2),…, WP(NPk)}, and WP(NPq) in it is computed as:

Besides that, the time of duration of the evolutional

B.
Event-based abductive reasoning
1)
Collecting and formalizing evolutional events
Although the recognized patterns could infer some
information about the evolution process of EEK over a long
period of time, it is difficult for engineers to understand the
meanings since these patterns are expressed with concepts
and weights, lacking readable explanation texts.
Therefore, this paper uses texts of events described with
natural language to infer and explain the patterns and their
motives. Such events are evolutional events, which are the
facts that already happened at a certain time, strongly
related to the knowledge evolution or directly lead to the
evolution. They are derived from the news of tools updating,
the investigations of authorized institutions, the summaries
from experienced long-term practitioners, or other records
of domain-related comments. Table I shows an illustrative
record of an evolutional event, describing the event of
adding parametric design tools in AutoCAD 2010. This
event aroused strong repercussions of the users and finally
result the evolution in EEKs in CAD field.
TABLE I.
AN ILLUSTRATIVE RECORD OF EVOLUTIONAL EVENT
Time: 2009.329
Content: The geometry in AutoCAD has always driven the
dimensions. We draw a line the correct length and then
dimension the line. What if you could drive the geometry
from the dimensions? You change the value of the dimension
and the geometry automatically updates! That is exactly what
we now have in AutoCAD 2010.
For these natural-language-described texts, Song et al. [14]
proposed a processing method by selecting some key
phrases from the texts to represent the events. They used
Stanford Parser to find the noun phrases and chose those
with large IDF weights in order to filter out the common
words and reflect the characteristics of the texts.
This paper also maps the events to vectors in semantic
space model, namely E={WE(NP1), WE(NP2),…, WE(NPk)}.
WE(NPr) is the IDF weights of NPr, which is calculated with
all
the
documents
of
evolutional
events.
Semantic
similarities between events and patterns, and among events,
can also be computed with (3). The occurrence of events can
be acquired directly from the source of texts and denoted
with tE.
2)
Abducting evolutional motives
Abductive reasoning is a kind of logical inference which
goes from an observation to a theory which accounts for the
observation, seeking the possible explanations for the
happened
phenomena[15].
Abductive
reasoning,
accompanied
by
deductive
reasoning
and
inductive
reasoning, is an indispensable part of human cognitive
activities[16]. We use the EEK of new features listed in
Figure 1 as an example to illustrate the process of abductive
reasoning. We observe the significant decrease of the cost of
time
when
accomplishing
the
CAD
missions,
which
response to the evolution of CAD field in shaping and
modeling.
And
according
to
the
work
efficiency
measurement, the EEK of new features will lead to such
decrease. Therefore we construct the probable causal
association that the EEK of new features is the motive of the
evolution of CAD field if there are no other conflicting
rules. Even though the modification of the measurement
reports or the proposal of more persuasive surveys will vary
the belief of this causal association, or even disconfirm the
association, some interesting explanations may still be
found and useful conclusions will be probably refined.
In abducting the motives of the evolution, the set of
evolutional patterns {P}, the set of evolutional events {E},
and the set of rules {R} are the inputs of the reasoning
process. If an event E is the motive of a pattern P according
to {R} and denoted as M(E→P), it should satisfy two
conditions:
 P follows from E according to {R};
 E is consistent with {R}.
Three reasoning rules are put into {R}. These rules
constrain the explaining of unrelated or contradictory events
for the motives of the evolutional patterns:
Rule 1: Evolutional event Ei is a possible cause of event Ej,
if Ei and Ej are semantically related and Ei is happened
earlier than Ej;
Rule 2: Evolutional pattern P is a possible consequence of
event E, if P and E are semantically related and E is
happened earlier than the end of P;

ALLDATA 2016 : The Second International Conference on Big Data, Small Data, Linked Data and Open Data (includes KESA 2016)

Rule 3: A motive chain M(Ei→Ej→P) is constructed, if
event Ei is the possible cause of event Ej and pattern P is the
possible consequence of event Ei and Ej simultaneously.
The process of abducting algorithm is listed as follows:
Input: evolutional pattern set {P}, evolutional event set
{E} and rule set {R};
Output: the set of possible motives {M};
Process:
(1) Create an empty motive set {M};
(2) Choose an earliest begun and undiagnosed evolutional
pattern P from {P};
(3) Choose a latest happened and unchecked evolutional
event E from {E}; find all possible causes of E according to
Rule 1, then construct List<E>;
(4) Choose a latest happened and unchecked Ei in List<E>,
add a motive chain M(Ei→P) into {M} if P and Ei satisfy
Rule 2;
(5) Repeat step 4, until all the events in List<E> are checked;
merge the motive chains with Rule 3;
(6) Repeat step 3-5, until all the events in {E} are checked;
save {M} for P; set all the events in {E} unchecked;
(7) Repeat step 2-6, until all the patterns in {P} are
diagnosed; output {M}.
With the readable appendix texts of the evolutional
events, it will be easier for engineers to understand the
evolution process of EEKs with the clear and specific
motives, hence is helpful for them to obtain a deep cognition
of the knowledge evolution. Meanwhile, the output motive
chains can also be further verified and evaluated by domain
experts, escalating the relationship between evolutional
events
and
evolutional
patterns
from
the
statistical
correlation to more cogent logical correlation.

CASE STUDY
From three professional virtual communities forums
autodesk.com,
www.cadtutor.net
and
www.cadforum.cz,
3276 EEKs of accomplishing computer-aided engineering
design missions using AutoCAD software were elicited and
formalized, ranging from February 2001 to September 2015.
The evolutional patterns were recognized from the networks
constructed by these EEKs. For the evolutional events
related to the evolution of CAD field, ReadMe documents of
each
update
and
all
software
versions
ranging
from
AutoCAD version 14.0 (AutoCAD R14, published in 1997,
February) to version 20.1 (AutoCAD 2016, published in
2015, March) were downloaded from the official website
www.autodesk.com, in which detailed the emergence of new
tools
and
the
modifications
in
original
functions
in
AutoCAD software. Proposed by an authorized institution
HyperPics Consult Company, open accessed documents of
news of the software AutoCAD What’s New were also
collected. We also collected the long-term experienced
user’s summary AutoCAD Tips & Tricks Booklets written by
Lynn Allen, who has used AutoCAD for over 25 years and
served as Autodesk University emcee for over 10 years.
1080 records of evolutional events, as shown in table 1,
were finally extracted.
The whole time span was divided into five time intervals:
2001-2003, 2004-2006, 2007-2009, 2010-2012, and 2013-
2015. The EEKs were clustered in each EEK network, and
Figure 3 shows the clusters in EEK network of time interval
2001-2003. The number of initial clusters k in K-means was
set to 30, and minimal number of cluster member |C|threshold
was set to 4. Similar EEK subdomains in the five networks
were linked with CosSimthreshold=0.5. 28 evolutional patterns
were
recognized
when
Scalethreshold=2,
containing
17
knowledge
expansion
patterns
and
11
knowledge
contraction patterns. Using abducting algorithm, evolutional
patterns were explained with the acquired motive chains. An
evolutional pattern and its abducted motives chains are
shown in Table II.

modify the drawings, which significantly accelerate the
speed in plotting and promotes the transition from design
intent to design response [17]. The tools of parametric
design were firstly added into AutoCAD 2010 in 2009,
triggering a positive response from the majority of CAD
engineers. They frequently applied dynamic blocks with
geometric
constraints
and
dimensional
constraints
to
accomplish
the
engineering
projects
and
accumulated
abundant
related
experiences.
According
to
the
aforementioned report [11], it is the emergence of these
parametric design tools that consequently motivated to the
evolution of EEKs in subdomain of modeling and shaping
in CAD field. The abducted motives chains in Table II are
also consistent with the motivation concluded from this
professional report.
These motive chains were also verified by the domain
experts in order to prove their validities. Some motives
chains in abducted results were deleted according to their
evaluation. Finally motivations of 25 evolutional patterns in
all 28 were firmly explained with these evolutional events,
while the other 3 patterns did not obtain persuasive
motivations.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS
Explaining the evolutional patterns with the evolutional
events, this paper proposed a novel method for investigating
the motivation of EEK evolution. Based on the networks
representing the structure of the field of EEKs, clustering
algorithm is adopted to divide the subdomains of the
networks in each time intervals. EEK evolutional patterns
are recognized with the scales and semantic informations of
the linked
subdomains in
neighboring time intervals.
Evolutional events related to EEK evolution are collected
and used to abduct the motive chains, explaining the
motivation of the evolution in depth. Evolution of EEKs in
CAD is investigated and evaluated with the experts and
practitioners, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of the
proposed event-based abducting method in acquiring the
clear and specific motivation of the EEK evolution.
The advantages of the proposed method are in three
aspects. Firstly, semantic meanings of the EEKs are fully
considered in the method. Therefore, our method can
provide a more integrated motivation of the EEK evolution
than most of traditional works. Secondly, our method uses
the domain-related events to investigate the factors that
impact the evolutional process, making our motivation more
facilitated to those intellectual workers in the domain. At
last, the utilizing of abductive reasoning is consistent with
human cognitive activities. It will mine all possible motives
according to the input event archives, which significantly
promotes the discovery of new interesting explanations.
There are several possible improvements for our methods.
First, according to the flowchart in Figure 3, the maximum
computational complexity of the algorithm is O(1/2|P||E|2).
In order to shorten the operation time when |E| is larger,
more compatible filtering rules should be added into rule set
{R}. Second, although the motive chains are acquired in this
paper, the quantitative degree of their impact on the
semantic meaning and scales of the subdomains is less
considered and will be paid attention in the future research.
