Abstract—The power consumption of wireless access net-
works will become a major issue in the coming years. There-
fore, it is important to have a realistic idea about the power
consumption of each element in those access networks. In
this paper, an energy efﬁciency model for microcell base
stations is proposed. Based on this model, the energy efﬁciency
of microcell base stations is compared for various wireless
technologies, namely mobile WiMAX, HSPA and LTE. The
power consumption of microcell base stations is about 70-77%
lower than for macrocell base stations but a macrocell base
station is more energy-efﬁcient than a microcell base station
for the same bit rates. However, for the considered case and
assuming our parameters are correct, a reduction in power
consumption can be obtained by using microcell base stations
to ﬁll coverage holes.

I. INTRODUCTION
Looking at the complete life cycle (production, use and
end-of-life) tells us that ICT is responsible for 4% of the
worldwide primary energy consumption [1]. Without any
precautions, this percentage will even double within the next
10 to 15 years. 9% of this ICT consumption is caused by
radio access networks [2]. Within these networks, 10% of
the energy is consumed by the user terminals, while 90% is
caused by the base stations. These numbers indicate that the
power consumption of wireless access networks is going to
become an important issue in the next few years. To model
and optimize the power consumption in those networks, the
focus should therefore be on the base stations.
An operator’s wireless access network has a hierarchical
structure of different cell types. Three different cell types can
be found: macrocell, microcell and picocell. A macrocell
has the highest possible coverage range. A microcell has
a smaller coverage range and is often used in densely
populated urban areas. A picocell is much smaller than
a microcell and is mostly used for indoor coverage in
large ofﬁce buildings, shopping centres or train stations.
To determine the power consumption of the whole wireless
access network, the power consumption of the macrocell,
microcell and picocell base stations have to be modelled.
In [3][4], an energy efﬁciency model for the macrocell base
station is proposed. The aim of this study is to model
and compare the energy efﬁciency between microcell and
macrocell base stations for various wireless technologies.
The same approach as in [3][4] is followed: the power
consumption of a microcell base station is ﬁrst modelled
and related to the range to determine the energy efﬁciency.
The wireless technologies considered are: mobile WiMAX
(Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) [5],
HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) [6] and LTE (Long Term
Evolution) [7].
Few work has been done about the energy efﬁciency of
microcell base stations. The most valuable contribution to
this topic can be found in [8] where the power consumption
of different equipment is combined into three parameters.
This makes it difﬁcult to investigate the inﬂuence of the
different components on the base station’s power consump-
tion, as well as the inﬂuence of possible dependencies
between the components. Furthermore, only one wireless
technology is considered, while our work shows that there
are signiﬁcant differences in energy efﬁciency between the
wireless technologies.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II the power consumption of a microcell base station
is modelled and related to the coverage. Section III describes
some results obtained with the model proposed in Section II.
Section IV presents our conclusions.
II. METHOD
In this section, a power consumption model for a micro-
cell base station is proposed.
A. Energy-efﬁciency of a microcell base station
Just like for a macrocell base station, the power consump-
tion PCarea per covered area of a microcell base station is
deﬁned as (in W/m2) [3][4] :
PCarea = Pel/micro
π · R2
(1)
with Pel/micro the power consumption (in Watt) and R the
range (in meter) of the microcell base station. The next
sections discuss how Pel/micro and R are determined. The
lower PCarea, the more energy-efﬁcient the technology is.
1) Power consumption of a microcell base station: A
base station is here deﬁned as the equipment needed to
communicate with the mobile stations and with the backhaul
network. The microcell base station consists of several
power consuming components, which are shown in Fig. 1.

The following components are found: the transceiver (re-
sponsible for sending and receiving of signals to the mobile
stations and includes the signal generation), digital signal
processing (responsible for system processing and coding),
the power ampliﬁer, the AC-DC converter or rectiﬁer, and
the air conditioning (if present). In contrary to a macrocell
base station, a microcell base station supports only one
sector and each component is therefore used once. This
assumption is based on the conﬁdential information retrieved
from an operator.
Figure 1.
Block diagram of microcell base station equipment.
The power consumption of each component is constant
(in Watt), expect for the air conditioning and the power am-
pliﬁer. The air conditioning’s power consumption depends
on the internal and ambient temperature of the base station
cabinet. Assuming an internal and ambient temperature of
25◦ C gives also a constant power consumption for the air
conditioning. However, an air conditioning is not always
necessary for a microcell base station. In this paper, the
worst case for the power consumption, which includes the
air conditioning, is investigated. The power consumption
Pe/amp of the power ampliﬁer depends on the required input
power PT x of the antenna and is determined as follows [9]:
Pel/amp = PT x
η
(2)
with PT x the input power of the antenna (in Watt) and η
the efﬁciency of the power ampliﬁer, which is the ratio of
RF output power to the electrical input power [9]. The RF
output power corresponds with PT x as indicated in Fig. 1.
Once the power consumption of each component is
known, the power consumption Pel/micro of the entire
microcell base station can be determined (in Watt):
Pel/micro
=
Pel/amp + Pel/trans + Pel/proc + Pel/rect
+Pel/airco
(3)
with Pel/amp, Pel/trans, Pel/proc, Pel/rect, Pel/airco and
Pel/link the power consumption of, respectively, the power
ampliﬁer, the transceiver, the digital signal processing, the
rectiﬁer, and the air conditioning. Table I summarises the
typical power consumption of the different components for
the technologies considered. These values are retrieved from
data sheets of various network equipment manufacturers and
are very similar to those of the macrocell base station [3][4],
except for the air conditioning. The air conditioning’s cool-
ing power is signiﬁcant lower for the microcell base station,
resulting in a lower power consumption for the microcell
base station (60 W versus 225 W for the macrocell base
station, based on conﬁdential information from an operator).

2) Calculation of the range of a microcell base station:
To determine the coverage of a microcell base station a
link budget has to be determined. Table II-A2 summarises
the link budget parameters for the coverage calculations
of the microcell base stations. The same parameters as
for the macrocell base stations are usable, however, some
of these parameters will have a different value such as
the input power of the antenna and the antenna gain. The
typical input power of the antenna PT x for a microcell
base station is 2 W or 6 W. In this investigation, we use
PT x equal to 2 W, which corresponds with 33 dBm [8].
As mentioned above, a microcell base station has only
one sector, therefore, an omnidirectional antenna is used.
The antenna gain for this type of antennas and the base
station considered varies from 4 to 6 dB depending on the
technology. The other parameters remain the same because
these parameters are either technology dependent (such as
the frequency, bandwidth, etc.) or mobile station dependent
(such as antenna gain of mobile station, feeder loss of the
mobile station, etc.) or ﬁxed assumptions (such as the yearly
availability, fade margin). Note that the cell interference
margin assumed might be too optimistic because the same
cell interference margin is used for both the macrocell and
the microcell base station just like in [8].
In Table III, the characteristics of the scenario considered
are presented. A suburban area is assumed with a height of

typically at a height of 6 m, which corresponds with the
height of the roof-gutter of a three-storied house (i.e., 2 m
per ﬂoor). The base stations are placed outdoor and for the
mobile stations an indoor residential scenario is considered
with a Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC) for a
laptop.
The Walﬁsch-Ikegami (W-I) model is used as propagation
model for microcells [10]. The Erceg-model, which is used
for macrocell base stations, is not suitable for microcell base
station heights [11].

III. RESULTS
In this section, some results obtained with the model from
Section II are discussed.
A. Energy-efﬁciency of microcell base stations
In this section, the wireless technologies considered are
compared for a bandwidth of 5 MHz. The parameters given
in Tables I, II-A2 and III are used. Fig. 2 shows the power
consumption PCarea per covered area (in W/m2) as a
function of the bit rate (in Mbps).
In general, Fig. 2 shows that each technology becomes
less energy-efﬁcient for higher bit rates as PCarea increases
for increasing bit rates. The higher the bit rate, the higher
the receiver SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) as given in Ta-
ble II-A2. Furthermore, a higher receiver SNR corresponds
with a smaller range for the same power consumption Pel
resulting in a higher value for PCarea (eq. (1)) and thus a
lower energy efﬁciency.

Energy efﬁciency of a microcell base station for different bit
rates in 5 MHz channel.
A microcell base station consumes about 376.6 W for each
technology (Table I). However, the range R differs between
the technologies considered. For a bit rate of 10 Mbps, R
equals to 76.0 m, 37.0 m and 48.0 m for mobile WiMAX,
HSPA and LTE respectively. A higher R for the same Pel
results in a lower PCarea and thus in a higher energy
efﬁciency.
Fig. 2 shows that mobile WiMAX is the most energy-
efﬁcient technology for bit rates higher than 3.8 Mbps (low-
est PCarea of 20.8 mW/m2 at 10 Mbps versus 87.6 mW/m2
and 52.0 mW/m2 for HSPA and LTE respectively). For the
bit rates considered, mobile WiMAX performs better than
HSPA and LTE due to its higher antenna gain for both the
base station and the mobile station (Table II-A2). Moreover,
mobile WiMAX has a higher effective input power of the
antenna P T CH
T x
than HSPA. P T CH
T x
is the power reserved
by the base station for the trafﬁc channels and is lower
for HSPA because it uses a W-CDMA (Wideband Code
Division Multiple Access) based multiple access technique,
while mobile WiMAX uses OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiple Access).
The bit rates between 2.8 Mbps and 3.8 Mbps are only
supported by HSPA and LTE. In this case, LTE is the
most energy-efﬁcient due to its higher P T CH

2.8 mW/m2 versus 19.7 mW/m2 for a bit rate of 2.8 Mbps).
Bit rates below the 2.8 Mbps are only supported by HSPA
(PCarea = 14.5 mW/m2 for 1.3 Mbps).
B. Energy-efﬁciency of
microcell
base
stations
versus
macrocell base stations
In this section, the energy efﬁciency of a microcell base
station is compared to that of a macrocell base station for
the technologies considered and in a 5 MHz channel. For
the macrocell base station, the same settings as in [4] are
used. Fig. 3 presents the power consumption per covered
(PCarea) as a function of the bit rate (in Mbps) for both
the macrocell and the microcell base station.
Fig. 3 shows that, in general, the macrocell base stations
are more energy-efﬁcient than microcell base stations as
PCarea is lower (about 82 to 93%). The power consumption
Pel of the microcell base station is about 70.6% lower
for mobile WiMAX and about 77.5% lower for HSPA
and LTE compared to the corresponding macrocell base
stations (Table IV). However, a macrocell base station has
a signiﬁcant higher range (297.0%, 346.3% and 498.4% for
mobile WiMAX, LTE and HSPA respectively) resulting in
a higher energy efﬁciency.
Furthermore, for the macrocell base station, it was found
that HSPA is the most energy-efﬁcient technology until a
bit rate of 2.8 Mbps (which corresponds with the results for
microcell base stations), LTE is the most energy-efﬁcient
for bit rates between 2.8 Mbps and 11.5 Mbps (versus
2.8 Mbps and 3.8 Mbps for microcell base stations) and
mobile WiMAX is the most energy-efﬁcient for bit rates
higher than 11.5 Mbps (versus 3.8 Mbps for microcell base
stations).

C. Microcell base stations in realistic network deployments
Based on the results mentioned above, one might ask if
it is interesting to use microcell base stations in real net-
work deployments. The answer to that question is positive.
Microcell base stations can be used to increase the capacity
of a macrocell base station in a certain area. Furthermore,
microcells can also be used to solve coverage holes. In this
section, a simple example is given where a beneﬁt can be
obtained by using microcell base stations to solve coverage
holes.
Fig. 4(a) shows the example considered. An operator has
to cover an area of 4 km2 for 100% with mobile WiMAX
base stations. A bit rate of 3.8 Mbps is considered. Seven
macrocell base stations are placed in the area and these sites
have to be re-used. Five of these base stations have an input
power PT x of 35 dBm (blue circles), which corresponds with
a range of 499.0 m and a power consumption of 1279.1 W;
the other two have a PT x of 31 dBm (red circles) resulting in
a range of 399.0 m and a power consumption of 1234.5 W.
The current situation has a power consumption of 8.9 kW:
Pel,curr = 5 · 1279.1 W + 2 · 1234.5 W = 8864.5 W (4)
(a)
(b)
(c)
Figure 4.
Possible solution to cover coverage holes: start situation (a),
only macrocell base stations are used (b), and both macro- and microcell
base stations are used (c).
In Fig. 4(b), the coverage holes are ﬁlled by using only
macrocell base stations. Six macrocell base stations are
introduced. Each macrocell base station added has a PT x of
18 dBm corresponding with a range of 193.0 m and a power
consumption of 1206.5 W. The total power consumption
Pel,1 to cover the area is in this case:
Pel,1
=
5 · 1279.1 W + 2 · 1234.5 W + 6 · 1206.5 W
=
16104 W

The network in Fig. 4(b) consumes thus about 16.1 kW.
In Fig. 4(c), the coverage holes are ﬁlled by placing micro-
cell base stations (green circles). 18 microcell base stations
are needed to cover the area considered. Each of these base
stations have a PT x of 33 dBm, which corresponds with a
range of 115.0 m and a power consumption of 376.6 W.
The total power consumption Pel,2 to cover the area is then
approximately 15.6 kW:
Pel,2
=
5 · 1279.1 W + 2 · 1234.5 W + 18 · 376.6 W
=
15643.0 W
(6)
The solution with both macrocell and microcell base
stations consumes about 461 W less. This is a power
consumption reduction of 3% than the solution where only
macrocell base stations are considered. It is thus interesting
to add microcell base stations in a realistic network deploy-
ment.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, an energy efﬁciency model for microcell
base stations is proposed. Based on this model, the energy
efﬁciency of microcell base stations is compared for various
bit rates and wireless technologies, namely mobile WiMAX,
HSPA and LTE. Furthermore, the energy efﬁciency between
a microcell and macrocell base station is investigated. The
base stations were placed outdoor in a suburban environment
and for the mobile stations an indoor scenario was consid-
ered with a WNIC for a laptop. A bandwidth of 5 MHz
was assumed. For the parameters considered, a microcell
base station has ranges from 40 m to 80 m for a power
consumption of approximately 377 W.
Mobile WiMAX is the most energy-efﬁcient technology
for bit rates higher than 3.8 Mbps, LTE for bit rates
between 2.8 Mbps and 3.8 Mbps and HSPA for bit rates
lower than 2.8 Mbps. HSPA is the only technology which
supports bit rates lower than 2.8 Mbps. Mobile WiMAX
support only bit rates higher than 3.8 Mbps. The power
consumption Pel of the microcell base station is 70.6% lower
for mobile WiMAX and 77.5% lower for HSPA and LTE
but a macrocell base station is more energy-efﬁcient than
a microcell base station due to the higher ranges of the
macrocell base stations.
However, it is interesting to use microcell base stations
in real network deployments. In this paper, a solution was
presented to ﬁll coverage holes by using only macrocell base
stations and by using both macrocell and microcell base sta-
tions. The latter showed a reduction in power consumption
compared to the solution with only macrocell base stations
for the case considered and assuming our parameters are
correct.
In the future, the power consumption model should be
validated with measurements and will be added in the
GRAND (Green Radio Access Network Design) tool, which
is a deployment tool we developed for green wireless access
networks.
