Abstract—Announcements of events are regularly spread using
the Internet, e.g., via online newspapers or social media. Often,
these events involve playing music publicly that is protected
by international copyright laws. Authorities entrusted with the
protection of the artists’ interests have to ﬁnd unregistered music
events in order to fully exercise their duty. As a requirement, they
need to ﬁnd texts in the Internet that are related to such events
like announcements or reports. However, event detection is a
challenging task in the ﬁeld of Text Mining due to the enormous
variety of information that needs to be considered and the large
amount of data that needs to be processed. Because no benchmark
data is available for the domain of music event detection, in
this paper a gold standard dataset is presented and made
publicly available for further development and improvement.
Subsequently, a process chain for the detection of music events
incorporating external knowledge is proposed. Finally, the perfor-
mance of three classiﬁcation models is compared using various
feature sets and two different datasets. The best performances
reach an F1-measure of 0.94 and 0.946 for the classiﬁcation of
music and music event relevance, respectively.

I.
INTRODUCTION
At public events, often, legally protected media, such as
music, movies and books are made available to the public.
Authorities or private institutions are entrusted with the inter-
ests of the artists. This includes transferring them the money
collected from registered events. One of the largest private
institutions in Germany is the Gesellschaft f¨ur musikalis-
che Auff¨uhrungs- und mechanische Vervielf¨altigungsrechte
(GEMA, English: Society for musical performing and me-
chanical reproduction rights) representing the rights of about
2 Million artists all over the world and with a total revenue of
1 Billion Euros a year [1]. However, if event organizers do not
register an event, they will cause a loss for the holder of the
rights. So far, ﬁnding unregistered events after they have taken
place is very difﬁcult and is a process mostly done manually.
Nowadays, the information that an event is taking place
is often spread using online newspapers, Facebook, Twitter as
well as websites. Additionally, after an event has taken place
it is often discussed using the same means of communication.
Spreading the information this way is often the ﬁrst choice, as
many people can be reached in a short amount of time. Hence,
analyzing these textual data makes it possible to automatically
ﬁnd the information needed to uphold the artists’ rights. Text
Mining, also referred to as Text Analysis, focuses on the
analysis of texts in order to receive high level information
and latent patterns. For example, it plays an important role in
decision making in Business Intelligence, where it can simplify
the decision making process by extraction the most valuable
information from texts [2]. Event detection is a speciﬁc Text
Mining problem in which texts are analyzed in order to mine
a set of texts that have a semantic link or share conceptual
patterns. More generally, it can be seen as a classiﬁcation
problem [3]. Consequently, event detection can be used to ﬁnd
indications of past or future events [4] [5].
This paper addresses music event detection. The goal is to
ﬁnd an appropriate way to detect public music events, which
are not ofﬁcially registered and, therefore, violate copyrights.
The amount of data that needs to be taken into account is huge
and the data can only be effectively analyzed using machine
learning techniques and methods applied in automatized text
classiﬁcation [6].
This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, some
related work is brieﬂy reviewed. Sections III and IV describe
difﬁculties in the current domain and the proposed concept.
Next to a baseline based on a Na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁer, a Support
Vector Machine (SVM), and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
preliminary results will be discussed in Section V. Finally,
Section VI gives a short conclusion and discusses future work.

RELATED WORK
Basically, event detection is a special mining problem.
The aim is to discover new or track previously identiﬁed
events. In the past years, several different approaches have
been developed for closed and open domains. For the former
manually designed keyword lists can be used to detect speciﬁc
events in texts [7]. Those keyword lists work effectively, yet
need expert knowledge to deﬁne the event-speciﬁc keywords.
Furthermore, keyword lists are limiting the search framework,
which is why they will not work for open domains and can
only be used as an additional resource for more complex event
types, as is the case with the detection of music events. Another
example for the detection of events within a speciﬁc ﬁeld
is presented by [8] and [9], both working on the detection
of economic events that might inﬂuence the market, such as
mergers. For open domains, [5] proposed a method using
machine learning techniques, like clustering and Named Entity
22

Recognition (NER) combined with an ontology (DBpedia) in
order to classify Tweets into eight predeﬁned event categories.
Similar to event extraction, the recognition of events might
also be categorized as data-driven or knowledge-driven event
recognition. In [8] and [9] Data-driven approaches were used,
both taking mentions of real-world occurrences into account
in order to classify their texts into different types of economic
events. However, the data-driven approaches fail to consider
semantics. In contrast, knowledge-based approaches focus on
mining patterns from data to deliver potential rules represent-
ing expert knowledge. Depending on the domain or the context,
linguistic, lexicographic as well as human knowledge or a
combination of these is applied [10].
Much work has been done concerning event detection using
different approaches within different ﬁelds. Certainly, some
of the proposed methods, such as those presented in [7] and
[5], can be applied for the detection of music events and our
concept is based on the work by [5]. However, in the domain of
music event detection, some difﬁculties appear. For example,
events might be announced only using the name of an artist.
Some of these difﬁculties will be discussed in later sections.
Additionally, most studies on music event detection so far
worked with audio and not text data. One example for a study
on music events working with Twitter data is given in [11]. In
their study, they identify musical events mentioned in Twitter
in order to create a list including sets of artists and venues.
The information can be added to an already existing list , for
example, a city event calender [11].

DATA PREPARATION
Since the nature of the data is very heterogeneous –
different sources like Facebook and newspapers are considered
– its analysis has inherent challenges. Below, some of them are
discussed in more detail.
A. Data Sources
At the beginning of the study, experts, during their work on
manually detecting unregistered music events, independently
and arbitrarily preselected more than 1000 music event relevant
and irrelevant texts from Facebook and online newspapers.
This dataset was then annotated as presented below and used
as a basis for our gold standard.
B. Challenges
Noisy Data: In general, texts from social media are inher-
ently characterized by noise. For example, texts often include
web addresses, telephone numbers, dates and other characters
like hashtags. Furthermore, the texts posted, for example, on
Facebook or Twitter are not well written in terms of their
grammar and orthography. The application of standard NLP
tools to correct such mistakes may lead to incorrectly written
names of musicians. As these names are crucial for this study,
important events may not be detected.
Text Length: Due to technical restrictions and their in-
tended usage, texts in social media are often very short.
Information is compressed as much as possible, for example,
by using emoticons or abbreviations or by completely leaving
out words. Therefore, the application of standard text analysis
methods is often difﬁcult, especially, if the method relies on
syntactically correct structures. Considering the following text
from Facebook, the application of standard Named Entity
Recognition methods fails, because some syntactic features are
missing:
“Foo Fighters Eintritt 19. in Hamburg”
Latent Information: Taking the example from above, the
crucial information that needs to be found is – even if the
text is already classiﬁed as an event – that Foo Fighters is a
band name and, therefore, the text announces a music event.
Typically, such information is extracted by applying methods
from the ﬁeld of NER as discussed in [12]. Traditionally, NER
is a subtask in the ﬁeld of information extraction that focuses
on locating structured information in a text and assigning it to
predeﬁned categories such as names of persons, organizations
and locations. However, distinguishing normal persons from
singers or normal organizations from bands is challenging
and presents one of the biggest problems in the selection of
appropriate features as no prior information is available that
indicates whether what the NER model identiﬁed is really
music-related. This can be changed by adding additional infor-
mation in the gazetter. This means, before the classiﬁcation it is
already known that, f. e., Johann Sebastian Bach is a musician.
However, a much more challenging task is the identiﬁcation
of entities in a text such as musicians that are unknown, for
example, a new band or DJ. Unfortunately, texts including
these entities appear more often than texts announcing events
with known entities.
Dynamic Entities: Information is always dynamic and
changes in meaning depending on the time of production.
The latent new NER-entities (e.g. musicians, bands or groups)
change over the time. An example would be the singer and
songwriter Ed Sheeran. Before he became a known musician,
he would need to have been labeled as a normal person.
However, now he needs to be labeled as a musician. This
means, which named entities are relevant changes depending
on the point of time a text was written. This triggers the
requirement to simultaneously update the knowledge base of
our system.
C. Gold Standard
Because there are no suitable training data available, it
was necessary to create a gold standard as a basis for the
training and evaluation of various classiﬁcation models. As was
mentioned above, texts were collected arbitrarily, including 21
texts from online newspapers and 1,097 texts from Facebook.
These were manually annotated as music related or music
unrelated as well as event related or event unrelated. Both
decisions were made independently of each other. Due to text-
inherent vagueness, the data was independently labeled by 35
people. In order to ensure the quality of the labeled data, each
person was only allowed to work for 2 hours a day.
The ﬁnal decision regarding what category a text belongs
to was made by using a majority criterion. This criterion
requires a minimum number of people to agree on a decision
in order to provide a conﬁdent classiﬁcation. If the minimum
number of agreements was not achieved for a given text,
the text was considered ambiguous and removed from the
corpus. The minimum number of agreements was derived from
a binomial test under the null hypothesis that each decision
individually made by every study participant is conducted at
random. This hypothesis thus states that p+ = p− = 0.5,
where p+ and p− are the decision probabilities. With respect
23

SEMAPRO 2018 : The Twelfth International Conference on Advances in Semantic Processing

to the null hypothesis, for every number of agreements d a
probability P(d|p+) can be derived from the corresponding
binomial distribution. The minimum number of agreements
dcrit is equal to d, where the null hypothesis can be rejected
according to P(d ≥ dcrit|p+) < α. Here, α corresponds to the
Bonferroni-corrected signiﬁcance level of 0.05/n, with n being
the number of considered texts. In this study, the minimum
number of agreements dcrit was 29 for the text corpus.
As a result, the corpus consists of 19 newspaper texts
and 867 Facebook texts. 335 out of the 867 Facebook texts
and 14 out of the 19 newspaper texts are music relevant.
Table I provides some descriptive statistics. When music event
classiﬁcation is considered, the number of texts that meet the
Bonferroni constraint drops to 505, whereas 251 Facebook
texts and 9 online newspaper texts are music event relevant.
Table II provides the descriptive statistics for the music event
related data. In summary, at the end, two datasets were created:
one for music relevance, including 886 texts and one for music
event relevance with 505 texts.

In order to describe the data in the domain of music events,
we deﬁned an XML-schema, with which our raw data can be
concisely structured in order to serve as a gold standard to
train and test models in this ﬁeld. Even though this work is
focused on music event detection, the schema is constructed to
contain various types of event data, such as music, theater, or
readings. It includes, beside others, the following information:
•
raw text
•
source (e. g., Facebook)
•
event-related ({0, 1} and certainty)
•
event-type-related ({0, 1} and certainty)
•
event location
•
event-date
•
persons
•
different types of roles (e. g., musician, actor)
•
different types of events (e. g., music, theater)
It needs to be emphasized that the relation between any
text and a speciﬁc category is described twice: binary and
with a numeric value. The binary description refers to the
classiﬁcation and thus serves as a ground truth, whereas the
numeric value represents the degree of certainty. With this gold
standard the following areas may be addressed:
•
classiﬁcation of texts regarding different event-types
•
recognition of event-related entities, i. e., roles of
persons, organizations and locations
Named entities are considered because they provide strong
features for the classiﬁcation, as was shown in [13] and [14].
For example, if the name Eric Clapton, an English singer and
songwriter, appears in a text, this is a strong indication that
the current text is music related. Since classic NER mostly
concentrates on distinguishing between persons, locations, and
organizations, a more detailed categorization including some
kind of prior knowledge is needed. The entire dataset was
annotated and curated manually according to the schema
described so far.
IV.
PROPOSED CONCEPT
The task of detecting texts concerning music events is a
typical categorization task. Categorization, as a special case of
classiﬁcation, attempts to categorize a text into a predeﬁned set
of conceptual categories using machine learning techniques.
Formally, let T = t1, ..., tm be a set of texts to be categorized,
and C = c1, ..., cn a set of categories, then the task of catego-
rization can be described as surjective mapping f : T → C,
where f(t) = c ∈ C yields the correct category for t ∈ T. In
the ﬁeld of music event detection, texts need to be assigned
to one out of two main classes: related to a music event
or not. Texts of the former class can be further categorized
into different event types, such as public concerts. This might
be of great importance as some music, e. g., religious music
or classical music concerts, are license free or public music
resources.
Currently, institutions responsible for the enforcement of
exploitation rights have to detect unannounced music events
predominantly manually and with the help of search engines.
This leads to various problems. Firstly, the manual search
is very inefﬁcient on large-scale data. Secondly, the manual
checking process is error-prone and differs depending on the
person who judges the data. Furthermore, the current process
chain can hardly be deployed in an online mode due to its
semi-automated nature.

To overcome these limitations, a semi-supervised process-
chain using a bootstrapping approach, as depicted in Figure
1, is proposed. The advantage of the chosen approach is that
the training can start with very few but highly descriptive
examples in order to create a ﬁrst restrictive classiﬁer which
will be further improved in upcoming iterations until all texts
are classiﬁed or no further improvement is possible. Next, each
step is discussed in more detail.
A. Preprocessing
As mentioned in Section III-B, the texts we worked on
mostly come from the Internet. Such texts often contain typing
24

SEMAPRO 2018 : The Twelfth International Conference on Advances in Semantic Processing

errors and are often written in informal language, including
dialect. This leads to even noisier data than usual in textual
texts. Besides common shallow text preprocessing, including
stopword and punctuation removal as well as stemming or
lemmatizing, there is a strong need for additional language
information. This information can be provided in the form of
a knowledge base curated by experts. For instance, preselected
terms, such as party or live music, can be used to build the
gazetteer. Additional useful information might be venues of
interest, such as clubs or caf´es, where music events often take
place. In short, information directly related to music events
can be used as a basis of knowledge. This knowledge base
can be a simple gazetteer, as is the case in our study, or can
incorporate more complex structures, as in [15].
B. Collecting Seed Texts
The most crucial task in bootstrapping is ﬁnding seed texts
which represent the concept of the classes as well as possible.
The usage of some kind of highly descriptive key words or
phrases collected from experts in this ﬁeld is one possible way
to ﬁnd seed texts in a highly accurate, but, nevertheless, very
restrictive way. It can be combined with the aforementioned
gazetteer.
C. Feature Selection
The next step is the selection of appropriate features to
represent the text data. Feature selection is always a critical
step in text classiﬁcation tasks. On the one hand, well selected
features are necessary to achieve highly accurate results. On
the other hand, they help reduce the feature space and, as a
consequence, minimize the time complexity [16]. Traditional
frequency-based features, such as Term Frequency (TF), Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), etc. [6],
might not be appropriate in music event detection for two
reasons. Firstly, the data often origins from different sources,
thus, a term occurring in the training data might not be in new
unseen data. Secondly, social media data grows rapidly. Even
for a collection with modest size, the TF/TF-IDF matrix will
probably be huge. To reduce the dimension of such matrices,
the low-rank approximation can be used [17]. However, this
approach has a high computational cost.
As was shown in [12]–[14], named entities might be a
useful feature for text classiﬁcation tasks. In a ﬁrst step,
named entities are identiﬁed using any NER method, as
discussed in [12]. However, as was already discussed in
Section III-B, the named entities detected in this way are not
speciﬁc enough. Hence, domain-speciﬁc knowledge resources
like MusicBrainz, an open music encyclopedia, and DBpedia
can serve as a music database for distinguishing recognized
entities further, in order to assign appropriate roles to them,
for example, musician to a person. The richer this knowl-
edge base, the more accurate is the classiﬁcation. Hence, the
database needs to be maintained in terms of a feedback loop
while the model is running. The entire process of music event
related Named Entity Recognition is shown in Figure 2. The
inﬂuence of using NER with a knowledge base is clearly shown
in Section V-B.
D. Training and Classiﬁcation
The ﬁnal step is to train a ﬁrst classiﬁer using the seed
texts and to try to assign categories to the other texts. This

step is repeated until no improvement of the classiﬁer can be
achieved or no remaining texts are left.
E. System Complexity
In the following section, the system complexity shall be
brieﬂy described on the basis of time and space.
Time Complexity: The time complexity of the system,
without considering the training and classiﬁcation process, can
be described as shown in Equation 1,
T(n) = Tpre + Tgazetteer + Tseeds + Tner + Tfeasel
= O(2p) + 2O(1) + 3Θ(lp) + O(L|S|3) + O(l)
(1)
where L is the number of samples and |S| the number of labels
in the NER process as well as l the length of the string and p
the length of the search pattern in the string.
Space Complexity: Similarly, the space complexity can be
measured without considering the training and classiﬁcation
process as shown in Equation 2,
T(n) = Tpre + Tgazetteer + Tseeds + Tner + Tfeasel
= O(2p) + O(g) + Θ(lp) + O(s + l) + 2Θ(lp)
+ O(r) + O(f)
(2)
where g is the size of the gazetteer, r the number of roles,
s the size of the trained NER-model and f the number of
features. After analyzing the time and space complexity, it
can be shown that the system requires intensive resources in
preprocessing and in identifying named entities with respect
to time and space complexity. Thus, the performance of our
system, regarding time and space complexity, depends on the
methods that are used in these two setups.
V.
EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
To create ﬁrst baseline results, the labeled data (see Sec-
tion III-C) were categorized using three different types of
supervised machine learning methods: Na¨ıve Bayes, SVM, and
MLP. The categorization was done once with each dataset.
Firstly, the dataset with 886 texts was used and categorized
as music relevant or not. However, as the ultimate goal is a
system for the detection of music events and not just music,
secondly, the dataset with only 505 texts was categorized as
music event relevant or not.
A. Setup
In this study, only two sources of texts concerning mu-
sic events are considered: Facebook as well as daily and
weekly online newspapers. The raw data were preprocessed
as described in Section IV-A. Furthermore, all numbers, for
example, telephone numbers and dates, were removed and,
therefore, not considered in the categorization. For comparison,
25

SEMAPRO 2018 : The Twelfth International Conference on Advances in Semantic Processing

two different datasets for each dataset were created. The
ﬁrst dataset contains word tokens that were processed with
the Porter stemmer [18], whereas for the second dataset the
algorithm proposed in [19] was used. For the detection of
named entities a Conditional Random Field approach was
applied, as proposed by [20]. As was mentioned in Section
IV-C, MusicBrainz und DBpedia were used to assign roles to
named entities and were combined in order to increase the
number of matches.
In this study, the following four representations of the texts
incorporating different features were compared:
•
bag of words (BoW) (multinomial BoW),
•
TF-IDF of the BoW,
•
multinomial BoW and music event related named
entities (BoW+NE), and
•
TF-IDF of BoW+NE.
In case of named entities only their type (role) was considered
as a feature rather than the entity itself, e. g., song writer
or musician were taken as a feature instead of Eric Clap-
ton. Moreover, it was only possible to train the SVM with
frequency-based features.
B. Results
The baseline results of music relevance decisions of the
gold standard dataset described in Section III-C are given in
Table III and the results for the categorization of music event
relevance are shown in Table IV.

The models were evaluated using a 10-fold cross vali-
dation and by calculating the harmonic mean (F1) of the
micro-averaged precision and sensitivity. The tables show
the results using stemming. The results were compared with
those achieved using lemmatization and it was observed that
stemming lead to slightly better results. As can be seen in
Table III, the best results for the categorization of music
relevance, based on the F1-measure, were achieved using a
frequency-based representation of words and named entities
(roles) and MLP. In comparison, a combination of BoW and
named entities (roles) and an MLP model achieved the best
results for the categorization of music event relevance. These
results are presented in Table IV. Furthermore, it was found
that the best performing model and feature combination (MLP
and BOW+NE) failed if the features (word) were in both, the
relevant and non-relevant texts, as well as when the texts were
very short or not enough strong features were available to the
model. The results in both tables show that the classiﬁcation
results of music relevance are clearly improved when the NER
features are considered.
VI.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, two gold standard datasets for music event
detection were presented and will be made publicly available
here [21]. Furthermore, a process chain for the categorization
of music event related texts was proposed and a ﬁrst baseline
evaluation conducted. The results show that a frequency-based
approach and music speciﬁc named entities together with a
multi-layer perceptron model performs best for the classiﬁca-
tion of music relevant texts in comparison to a BoW and named
entities representation with an SVM for the classiﬁcation of
music event relevance. The results for both datasets are very
similar and show that adding named entities leads to an
improvement in the performance.
The datasets used were relatively small, especially the one
including music event related texts and shall be extended in
the future. Furthermore, future research should also focus on
improving the performance, i. e., by considering the Entity
Power Coefﬁcient, as shown in [13] [14], or active learning,
as described in [22] [23]. Currently, some kind of neural
probabilistic language models [24] are tested. Such models
provide another way to represent a text by learning a dis-
tributed representation of words which enables each training
sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of
semantically neighboring sentences. Additionally, music events
including music that does not fall under any copyright laws
need to be distinguished from those events that might include
copyright infringements. For this purpose, a more ﬁne-grained
categorization to separate different types of events can be
realized by applying hierarchical classiﬁcation methods, such
as discussed in [14] [25].
