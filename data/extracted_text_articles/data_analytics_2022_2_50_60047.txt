Abstract—Typical English literary works tend to include a wide 
variety of different dimensions and features, and these would 
constitute the apparatuses which enable individual authors to 
express their personal sentiments and perspectives in different eras 
and cultural settings. We make use of iambic pentametre to 
quantify and characterize such dimensions by the use of Markov 
chains. Here, we adopt a machine learning approach by processing 
and extracting the characteristics of known passages and ultimately 
represent these as a signature transition matrix. We develop a 
multi-step Markov chain to characterize the time evolution of stress 
levels. In this approach, arbitrary amount of memory on previous 
stress levels may be incorporated into the model. It is expected that 
this method may be further developed and leveraged to enhance 
understanding and appreciation of English literary works, which 
will eliminate the application of subjective human judgments. 
Keywords - English literature; Markov model; Multi-step 
Markov chain; Shakespearean plays; sparse matrix. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
The richness of literary passages possesses multi-faceted 
characteristics, and such characteristics would allow different 
authors to express their unique emotions and outlook in different 
periods of time and cultural environments. In computational 
literary analysis, differing aims include determining authorship, 
sentiments, emotional contents, outlook, motif, rhythm, metre 
and purpose. Due to the complex dimensions, features and 
genres in English literature, there remain two especially 
significant obstacles in computer-aided literary attribution, 
respectively, practical and philosophical, which are related [7].  
As literary works can be viewed from a machine learning 
perspective [8]-[12], we first introduce a one-step Markov chain 
where the future stress level is dependent only on the present 
one. While this is useful, its limitation being that it is largely 
memoryless and ignore earlier stress levels. To overcome this 
restriction, we develop a multi-step Markov chain to 
characterize the evolution of stress levels. Through the 
combined use of one-step and multi-step Markov chain, show 
that certain characteristics of these works remain fairly uniform.. 
The examples include polarity of emotions, average sentence 
length, the arrangement of words, the occurrences of a particular 
word and punctuations.  
We use machine learning approaches to learn the 
characteristics of known passages using big data and ultimately 
encode these as a signature. In these approaches, arbitrary 
amount of memory on previous stress levels may be 
incorporated, with the caveat that the number of possible states 
would grow exponentially. By exploiting such sparsity, we are 
able to generate a numerical signature to characterize a passage. 
We also improve the traditional way of manually using human 
judgments to analyze literature into a faster and more space-
efficient one. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next 
section, with the help of specific examples, gives the motivation 
of studying English literary works by using Markov chains as a 
first approximation. As a second approximation, since the 
simple Markov chain is limited in memory of the past, the multi-
step Markov chain is developed in Section III, which is followed 
by experimentations in Section IV. The paper concludes in 
Section V. 
II. 
A MARKOV CHAIN CHARACTERIZATION 
Poems in one sense may be viewed as apparatus for the 
expression of human sentiments and emotions which are often 
manifested and closely intertwined in the poetic structure, metre, 
and rhyme scheme. To fix ideas, we consider Wordsworth’s 
poem “Daffodils” by first examining its emotional elements, and 
then consider the poetic structure. 
Daffodils are usually the symbol of “physically weak or 
impotent” [14] in English literature, and the lexical “daffodils” 
is a dactyl trisyllable with a stress on the first syllable. In the 
poems and a journal entry “Daffodils” [17]-[19], Ted Hughes, 
William Wordsworth, and Dorothy Wordsworth present the 
traits of daffodils by employing various rhetorical patterns and 
linguistic features. The characters can think and feel. European 
romanticism claims it is a new model of presence and 
emphasizes centrality [15]. The characters’ feelings and 
emotions could be related to Zen’s paradoxical philosophy of 
“fullness and emptiness” because ‘up comes to a flower and a 
world is born’ [16]. This “fullness and emptiness” philosophy is 
like the waxing and the waning of the Moon. It shows how the 
characters see the “happiness and sadness” and “fullness and 
emptiness” in their space time. Through the eyes of the 
characters, it could also bridge the gap between the sentiment 
lexicon analysis and the cross-cultural interpretation of literary 
works.

From a language aspect, among the 24 lines (153 words) in 
William Wordsworth’s poem “Daffodils”, there are nine 
emotional lexicons, which are further tagged as “positive” or 
“negative”. The five positive words include “sprightly, gay, 
jocund, bliss, and pleasure”, which are the similar expression of 
“happiness” but with different degrees of “happiness”. The 
varying degree of “happiness” could be the interpretation of 
Zen’s “fullness” in eastern culture. In contrast, the four negatives 
are “lonely, vacant, pensive, and solitude”, which represent the 
paradoxical pair of “sadness” or Zen’s “emptiness”. The same 
method is applied to the analysis of Ted Hughes’ poem 
“Daffodils” and Dorothy Wordsworth’s journal entry of 
“Daffodils”. Hughes’ poem [18] has three explicit emotions: 
eagerness, happiness, death, and being overwhelmed. In 
Dorothy Wordsworth’s journal entry [19], the positive emotion 
lexicons of the characters are “fancied, laughed, gay, good, 
enjoyed”, whereas the negatives are “cheerless” and “sour”. In 
these English literary pieces, the emotions are the paradoxical 
pair of “happiness and sadness” and its varying degree of 
“fullness and emptiness”.  
In English literary writings, iambic pentameter plays a key 
role. In particular, one of the most important aspects of 
Shakespeare’s language is his use of stress, the way certain 
syllables are emphasized in words more than others. In a line of 
a poem, a foot is a certain number of stressed and unstressed 
syllables, forming distinct units, as a musical measure consists 
of a certain number of beats. Delimitation of the sounds of the 
spoken chain can be based on auditory impressions, but the 
description of these sounds is an entirely different process. 
Description can be carried out on the basis of the articulatory act, 
for it is impossible to analyze the units of sound in their own 
chain [2].  
Stressed syllables vary in strength, while unstressed syllables 
vary in weakness; and a third group can strike us as uncertain as 
falling into a range that seems stronger than unstressed but 
weaker than stressed [2]. Therefore, it is common to notate the 
stressed sound with a “/” marking ictic syllables and a “×” 
marking nonictic syllables. In this notation, a standard line of 
iambic pentameter would look like, “× / × / × / × / × /” where 
each line of verse is made up of five two-syllable iambs for a 
total of ten syllables. This is used for many of Shakespeare’s 
most famous lines. As the metre is mainly about sound, not 
spelling, scansion adds numbers to indicate a variety of stress 
levels to realize beats and offbeats (1=lightest stress, 4=heaviest 
stress).  
In relation to the poetic structure, metre and rhyme scheme,  
William Wordsworth’s poem “Daffodils” [17] also exhibits 
correspondence with “fullness and emptiness”. Here, the 
stressed sounds are in bold and labelled as “/”, whereas the 
unstressed sounds are marked as “u”.  
u          /  u     /      u     /     u     / 
They flash upon that inward eye 
u           /  u      /     u   /  u  / 
Which is the bliss of solitude; 
u          /    u      /         u    /      u     / 
And then my heart with pleasure fills,  
u         /   u       /     u   /   u   / 
And dances with the daffodils.

III. 
MULTI-STEP MARKOV CHAIN CHARACTERIZATION 
WITH MEMORY 
In the above, if we break down the unstressed groupings, then 
a one-step Markov chain will not be adequate as the situation 
retains a certain amount of memory. More precisely, it 
remembers how many unstressed metres occurred in the past 
before it can determine whether the next one should be stressed 
or unstressed: if the past three metres were all unstressed, then 
the next one should be stressed; if the past three metres were not 
all unstressed, then the next one should be unstressed. Thus, 
knowing only the current state will not be able to predict what 
happens next. 
Hence, to remove the limitations on the above simple model, 
we can proceed in two directions: we can increase the number of 
possible states; and to reduce the memoryless property in the 
Markov chain. Let us initially concentrate on the first direction 
as Markov model recognition systems can effectively be realized 
for classification systems at large scales [1] 
Consider Part I of Shakespeare’s play “King Henry the 
Sixth”, where the rebel Jack Cade beheads a lord for printing 
books and setting up a grammar school to teach young men to 
read instead of leaving them to tally their business accounts, we 
have 
1         4     1         4      1     4        1     3     1      4 
×        /     ×         /      ×      /        ×     /      ×     / 
His brandisht Sword did blinde men with his beames.

It is possible to perform a simplification of this enhancement 
from the following observation. While the English syllables we 
speak can be spoken with many degrees or shades of emphasis 
of loudness, sharpness, duration, and other ways of signaling 
importance, it seems likely that in most English speech we 
perceive mainly two major levels of stress, and that we hear a 
continuous series of relatively stressed and relatively unstressed 
syllables [2]. Hence, the following 
1          4      1     4    1   4       1       4      1   4

using binary entries for the transition matrix. 
Assuming these come from the same piece of work, and if

Such a transition matrix may be used to characterize authorship.                                                                                        
As suggested by Cheney Patrick [5], a laureate entitled 
counter-authorship is a form of authorship that exists not in 
isolation but also in reaction, and when we profitably speak of 
Shakespeare, another laureate has been phrased as counter-
lauréate authorship [5]. One example of the counter-lauréate 
authorship in “King Henry the Fourth” as following is pivotal in 
the action of the play because it is first verification that the 
character Hal is in the process of reforming from tavern wastrel 
to national hero.

Another form of counter-lauréate authorship 
emerges in a more obvious place, Theseus’s speech 
in the mid-1590s romantic comedy “A Midsummer 
Night’s Dream”. It is noticeable that Shakespeare’s 
self-reflexive revision, such as the inserting 
discourse about the ‘poet’ as company for “lunatic” 
and the “lover”, turns a speech about the madness of 
love into one about the poet’s role in forming an 
eternizing state of consciousness [5].

In general, the transition matrix U for a given 
piece of literary work may be represented as, 
assuming there are m patterns, each occurring with 
probability pi,  
𝑈 = ∑ 𝑝𝑗𝑇𝑗

where each Tj corresponds to the characteristic matrix of pattern 
j. 
Thus, with vast text collections, Markov matrices can be 
systematically built and it provides a unique characterization of 
each period and author and nature of work.  
In the above, a one-step Markov chain is used, but in more 
general situations, as pointed out above, a multi-step Markov 
chain (with a longer past memory chain) is required. Let us 
consider the following fragment from “King Henry the Fourth”,

We see here that state 1 does not always make a transition to 
state 4; it sometimes goes to state 2 and sometimes go to state 1. 
In fact, it retains memory of the past states in addition to the 
current state. 
Let us amalgamate two consecutive states into one single 
state, thereby injecting more memory into the chain. In doing so, 
we incorporate memory of the immediate past state as well as 
the current state to determine the future transition. Thus, from 
the primitive states of S = {1, 2, 3, 4}, we now have the new set 
of states Ω, 
     Ω = S × S = { (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), 
                             (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), 
                             (3, 1), (3 ,2), (3, 3), (3, 4), 
                             (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4) }, 
with | Ω | = 16. Thus, by including memory of the past state, we 
can construct a 16 × 16 transition matrix.  
For the above situation, let us reduce the number of states and 
omit those that do not occur as follows, 
     Ω = S × S = { (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4),

Doing so will reduce the number of states from 16 to 6, with the

In general, if | S | = n, this will result in a n2 × n2 matrix before 
any reduction. The form and values of the entries in the matrix 
may be regarded as a characteristic signature of the passage in 
question, and we also note that such a matrix tends to be a sparse 
matrix. 
     Admittedly, the determination of transition probabilities, 
especially for extended memory situations, can be quite 
laborious. Other less computationally intensive methods exist, 
however, such as measuring the number of different types of 
lines, such as interrogative lines or exclamatory lines. A 
recommended procedure is to apply these less computationally 
intensive methods first, and then for fine tuning, apply the 
signature method above for greater accuracy.

EXPERIMENTATION 
Here, we examine and analyze Shakespeare’s work “Henry 
VI” and focus on his use of interrogative and exclamatory lines 
because it is rare to always identify the extent of a particular 
writer’s work beyond a significant margin of error [6]. From our 
analysis of the passage, the results are plotted in Figures 1 and 2. 
 
Figure 1. Exclamatory lines in Henry VI, Part I 
It would be uneasy with the claim that Shakespeare wrote 
nothing in Part One [4], because from Figure 1, it is noticeable 
that Acts One, Two, Three and Five share relatively a stable 30% 
of using exclamatory lines, and the frequencies are roughly 
lower than 39, whereas in Act Four the figure largely varies from 
the previous ones, reaching the highest 62% and standing a 
figure of 47 in frequency.  
 
Figure 2. Interrogative lines in Henry VI, Part I 
As for Figure 2, the interrogative lines in Acts Two, Three, 
Four and Five perform consistently at an average of 33% and a 
frequency of approximately 38, while Act One rises to 50% at 
55 in frequency.  
From these results, it is clear that Acts Two, Three and Five 
succeeded in maintaining the stability of the frequency in 
utilizing both the exclamatory and interrogative lines. In short, 
Part One’s inclusion cannot be taken as evidence of 
Shakespeare’s sole authorship [4], and conjunction of historical 
and analytical evidence suggests that it might be collaborative. 
Furthermore, Act One and Four contain indication regarding the 
collaboration of other authors as the analyzed data “betrayed” 
the works that bear Shakespeare’s name. If Part One postdates 
its two companions, then the primitive style of most of it can 
hardly be attributed to Shakespeare, and the “trilogy” is an 
artistic afterthought, not the product of the aspiring vision of a 
young prodigal genius [4].

CONCLUSION 
English literary works tend to include many dimensions and 
features, and these would constitute the apparatuses that enable 
different authors to express and articulate their personal 
sentiments and perspectives in different eras and emotional 
settings. In the analysis of literary works, there are differing 
aims, which include determining such aspects as the authorship, 
the emotional contents, sentiments, outlook, motif and purpose. 
We have made use of iambic pentametre to quantify and 
characterize such dimensions by the use of Markov chains.  
     In place of using human judgments, which is largely a manual 
process and a time-consuming process, we have proposed the 
use of a machine learning approach by learning the 
characteristics of known passages using big data and ultimately 
encode these as a signature. We first introduce a one-step 
Markov chain where the future stress level is dependent only on 
the present one. While this is useful, its limitation being that it is 
largely memoryless and ignores earlier stress levels. To 
overcome this restriction, we develop a multi-step Markov chain 
to characterize the evolution of stress levels. In this approach, 
arbitrary amount of memory on previous stress levels may be 
incorporated, However, a caveat concerning this method is that 
by extending the memory too far into the past may lead to 
overfitting in some situations which makes it sometimes difficult 
to effectively generalize. It is recommended that the memory 
extension should not be more than four steps. 
The present method is able to significantly eliminate error-
prone and relatively subjective human elements, and it is 
expected that this approach may be further developed and 
leveraged to enhance understanding and appreciation of English 
literary works.
