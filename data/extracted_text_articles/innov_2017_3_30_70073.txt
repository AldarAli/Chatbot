Abstract - In a field of decision making for systems that 
contains human beings, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) 
is widely employed. It elicits weights of criteria and 
alternatives that are independent enough of each other. For 
cases in which criteria are not independent enough, an 
extended inner dependence AHP is useful. In this paper, we 
investigate “partial inner dependence” structure, i.e., only 
some elements (proper subset) of the criteria are independent. 
For the partial inner dependence AHP, we propose a new kind 
of fuzzy weight representation that is valid even if a data 
matrix is not consistent or reliable enough. Although lots of 
kinds of fuzzy weight for AHP have been proposed, our new 
representation can be defined by using the results of two kinds 
of the sensitivity analyses and they are useful for partial inner 
dependence structure. We finally show a numerical example of 
the fuzzy weight for partial inner dependence AHP. 
Keywords -  AHP; fuzzy set; sensitivity analysis. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) proposed by T.L. 
Saaty in 1977 [1] is widely used in decision making because 
it reflects humans feelings naturally. The normal AHP 
assumes independence among all criteria, although it is 
difficult to choose enough independent elements. The inner 
dependence AHP [2] is used to solve this kind of problem 
when criteria have dependency. However, inner dependence 
method requires dependency matrix for all elements even if 
some criteria are independent.  In this research, we employ 
“partial inner dependence” structure. Our method divides a 
set of criteria to two subsets, such as a dependent part and 
an independent part, and then we can easily understand a 
relation among elements. 
On the other hand, the comparison data matrix may not 
have enough consistency when AHP is applied, because, for 
instance, a problem may contain too many criteria to make 
decision. It means that answers from decision-makers, i.e., 
components of the matrix, do not have enough reliability. 
They may be too ambiguous or too fuzzy [3][5]. To avoid 
this issue, we usually have to revise again, but it takes a lot 
of time and costs. Then, we consider that weights should 
also have ambiguity or fuzziness. Therefore, it is necessary 
to represent these weights using fuzzy set.  
In our research, we first apply sensitivity analysis to 
normal AHP to analyze how much the components of a 
pairwise comparison matrix influence the weight and/or 
consistency indices of the matrix. Next, we define new 
fuzzy weight representation of criteria for partial inner 
dependence AHP using L-R fuzzy numbers [4][6][7][8]. At 
last, we then propose overall fuzzy weight of alternatives 
when a comparison matrix among elements does not have 
enough consistency. Though a main idea of representing 
fuzzy weight for inner dependence structure was proposed 
by authors several years ago, we extend this representation 
to partial inner dependence. 
In Sections 2 and 3, we introduce the partial inner 
dependence AHP, consistency index and sensitivity analyses 
for AHP. Then, in Section 4, we define fuzzy weight for 
partial inner dependence structure, Section 5 is a numerical 
example, and Section 6 is a summary. 
II.  CONSISTENCY AND INNER DEPENDENCE  
In this section, we introduce the processes of the normal 
AHP, its consistency and inner dependence extension. 
A. 
 Normal AHP 
    Usually, the AHP consists of following 4 processes.  
(Process 1) Representation of structure by a hierarchy. 
The problem under consideration can be represented in a 
hierarchical structure. At the middle levels, there are 
multiple criteria. Alternative elements are put at the lowest 
level of the hierarchy. 
(Process 2) Paired comparison between elements at each 
level. A pairwise comparison matrix A is created from a 
decision maker's answers. Let n be the number of elements 
at a certain level, the upper triangular components of the  
matrix aij (i< j = 1,…,n) are 9, 8, .. , 2, 1, 1/2, …, or 1/9. 
These denote intensities of importance from element i to j. 
The lower triangular components aji are described with 
reciprocal numbers, for diagonal elements, let aii = 1.  
(Process 3) Calculations of weight at each level. The 
weights of the elements, which represent grades of 
importance among each element, are calculated from the 
pairwise 
comparison 
matrix. 
The 
eigenvector 
that 
corresponds to a positive normalized (so as sum of 
components is 1) eigenvalue of the matrix is used in 
calculations throughout in the paper. 
(Process 4) Priority of an alternative by a composition of 
weights. With repetition of composition of weights, the 
overall weights of the alternative, which are the priorities of

the alternatives with respect to the overall objective, are 
finally found. 
B. 
Consistency 
Since components of the comparison matrix are obtained 
by comparisons between two elements, coherent consistency 
is not guaranteed.  In AHP, the consistency of the 
comparison matrix A is measured by the following 
consistency index (C.I.)  
where n is the order of comparison matrix A, and λA is its 
maximum eigenvalue (Frobenius root). 
If the value of C.I. becomes smaller, then the degree of 
consistency becomes higher, and vice versa. It is said that 
the comparison matrix is consistent if 
1.0
C.I.
. 
C. 
Partial Inner Dependence Method  
The normal AHP ordinarily assumes independency 
among criteria, although it is difficult to choose enough 
independent elements in practice. The dependency means 
some kind of interaction among the elements. Inner 
dependence AHP [2] is used to solve this type of problem 
even for the case that criteria have dependency.  
In the inner dependence method, using a dependency 
matrix F={ fij }, we can calculate modified weights w(n) as 
follows, 
where w represents weights from independent criteria, i.e., 
normalized weight of normal AHP and dependency matrix 
F consists of eigenvectors of influence matrices that 
represent dependency among criteria. However, inner 
dependence method requires dependency matrix for all 
elements even if some criteria are independent.  In this 
research, we employ “partial inner dependence” structure, 
and then we can easily understand a relation among 
elements. 
     In a partial inner dependence AHP, we can divide a 
criteria set

Using this modified criterion weight, we can easily 
calculate the priority of alternatives, i.e., overall weight of 
alternatives with respect to overall objective.  
III. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES 
When we use AHP in some applications, it often occurs 
that a comparison matrix is not consistent or that there is not 
great difference among the overall weights of the 
alternatives. In these cases, it is very important to 
investigate how components of the pairwise comparison 
matrix influence its consistency or the weights. In this 
study, we use a method that some of the present authors 
have proposed before. It evaluates a fluctuation of the 
consistency index and the weights when the comparison 
matrix is perturbed. It is useful because it does not change 
the structure of the data. 
Since the pairwise comparison matrix is a positive 
square matrix, Perron-Frobenius theorem holds. From 
Perron-Frobenius theorem, the following theorem about a 
perturbed comparison matrix holds. 
Theorem 1 Let A = (aij), (i, j = 1,…, n) denote a 
comparison matrix and let A(ε) = A+εDA, DA=(aijdij) 
denote a matrix that has been perturbed. Let λA be the 
Frobenius root of A, w be the eigenvector corresponding to
λ A, and v be the eigenvector corresponding to the 
Frobenius root of transposed A'. Then, a Frobenius root λ
(ε) of A(ε) and a corresponding eigenvector w(ε) can be 
expressed as follows

where o(ε) denotes an n-dimension vector in which all 
components are o(ε). 
 
About a fluctuation of the consistency index, the 
following corollaries hold. 
Corollary 1 Using appropriate gij, we can represent the 
consistency index C.I.( ε ) of the perturbed comparison 
matrix A(ε) as follows

 Proofs of these corollaries are shown in [4]. 
IV.  FUZZY WEIGHT REPRESENTATION 
When a comparison matrix has poor consistency (i.e.,  
0.1<C.I.<0.2), components of the comparison matrix are 
considered to be fuzzy because they are results from human 
fuzzy judgment. Therefore, weight should be treated as 
fuzzy numbers [4][6]. 
Definition 1 (fuzzy weight) Let wk

, be a 
crisp weight of criterion k of partial inner dependence 
model, and gij | hij
(k)| denote the coefficients found in 
Corollary 1 and 2. If 0.1<C.I.<0.2, then a fuzzy weight of

  The definition above is an extension of fuzzy weight

can use this definition for dependent and independent

 is weight of the l-th

V.   NUMERICAL  EXAMPLE 
In this section, we show an example of “Leisure in 
holiday with family” having 4 criteria and 4 alternatives. 
Criteria are {popularity, good for rain (rain), fatigue, 
expense} and alternatives are {theme park (park), indoor 
theme park (indoor), cinema, zoo}.  
Table I shows a comparison matrix of criteria and normal 
weight, where its consistency is not so good (C.I. >0.1). 
Then using results of sensitivity analyses of consistency and 
weights, we can calculate fuzzy weights. There is a partial 
inner dependence between only 2 criteria (popularity and 
expense). Dependency matrix between popularity and 
expense is shown in Table II. Therefore, using a dependency 
matrix of criteria (TABLE II) and results of sensitivity 
analyses, modified fuzzy weight are obtained as shown in 
TABLE III. For partial inner dependence structure, centers 
of popularity and expense are changed. 
  TABLE IV shows weights of alternatives with only respect 
to criteria and consistency index. There is consistency in all 
criteria.  Finally, using composition (14), we evaluate 
overall fuzzy weights of alternatives in TABLE V.

From overall weight of alternatives, we can make fuzzy 
decision in partial inner dependence structure. 
VI.   CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
There are many cases in which data of AHP does not 
have enough consistency or reliability and structure of a 
problem does not contain complete independent criteria. For 
these cases, we propose a fuzzy weight representation and 
compositions for incomplete inner dependence structure 
using results of sensitivity analyses and fuzzy set.  Although 
lots of kinds of fuzzy weight for AHP have been proposed, 
our new representation can be defined by using the results 
of two kinds of the sensitivity analyses and they are useful 
for partial inner dependence structure. Our example can not 
only show how to represent weight of criteria and 
alternatives, but also makes it possible to investigate how 
the result of AHP has fuzziness even if data are not 
consistent or reliable enough. 
In the next step, we will compare the partial inner 
dependence AHP and the normal AHP with real data.
