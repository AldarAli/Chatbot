Abstract— In this paper, Big Data Processing was utilized to 
develop and validate a Predictive Analytics Model with the goal 
of determining the risk for an individual manifesting 
osteoporosis in later life. The analyzed dataset consists of the 
genomic information from over 2,500 individuals from all 
around the world. This model development leverages the novel 
genetic pleiotropic information, the two or more apparently 
unrelated phenotypes caused by a single gene. The dataset was 
examined for the mutations associated with osteoporosis and 
cardiovascular 
disease 
from 
the 
population 
genetics 
perspectives. The study also proposes the automatic histogram 
clustering as an effective and intuitive visualization method for 
high dimensional dataset. The data visualization and clustering 
results revealed a significant correlation between a person’s 
regional background and the frequency of occurrence of the 35 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These 35 SNPs are 
associated with osteoporosis and/or cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). Distinct SNP frequency of occurrence profiles were 
observed for specific geographic regions. Machine learning 
algorithms were then applied to predict the occurrence of 7 
osteoporosis-related-SNPs based on the existing CVD-related-
SNPs input as an experiment. The model's validity was 
confirmed through a separate experimental result, utilizing a set 
of data obtained through Affymetrix microarray mRNA 
expression signal values for the specific SNP(s) in individuals 
with and without osteoporosis.  Furthermore, these results 
confirmed the genetic linkage between osteoporosis and 
Cardiovascular related parameters such as High Density 
Lipoprotein (HDL) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP).  A useful 
Predictive Analytics Model for determining these genetic 
predispositions have been produced.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Early prediction and detection of chronic diseases such as 
osteoporosis gives patients an opportunity to make lifestyle 
changes, which can ameliorate the severity of the disorder. It 
will also enable patients and doctors to prevent the medically 
adverse events associated with the chronic disease. Here, 
machine learning based classifiers were developed, trained, 
and tested to predict Osteoporosis at an early stage. 
This study, originally presented in Biocomputational 
Systems and Biotechnologies, 2018. [1], investigates the 
occurrence of 7 selected osteoporosis-related Single-
Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) [2], and their correlation to 
28 CVD related SNPs [3]. In addition, the sample’s 
geographic background, along with the physical proximities 
between each of the SNPs were examined. 
Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel approach to 
automatic data-driven clustering of histogram presented data 
for verification and validation of disease related expression in 
different human populations. As explained in later sections, 
high dimensional datasets can be effectively and intuitively 
visualized by the algorithm generating the histogram 
clustering. This automated process could aid in understanding 
existing correlations among various types of large datasets.

A. Osteoporosis and Space Exploration 
Fractures, as a result of osteoporosis, will have a 
significant negative impact on an individual’s health, quality 
of life, and work performance. Some modern occupations 
inevitably expose workers to a significantly increased risk of 
developing Osteoporosis. An obvious example is space flight. 
Within a few days of Zero Gravity (zero G), astronauts begin 
to lose both muscle and bone mass. There is also a zero G 
suppression effect on the immune system, as well as an 
increase in the aging process of particular cells. These effects 
occurred in all individuals who exposed themselves to a zero 
G environment, which can last for months after returning to 
Earth [4].  It is reasonable to assume that a predisposition to 
Osteoporosis might increase the occurrence of the condition. 
Having a reasonably reliable predictive model to reveal the 
predisposition for osteoporosis can allow us to apply 
preventive approaches or medical intervention to prevent the 
occurrence of the condition. 
The 1000 Genome Project [5] sequenced over 7 TB of 
genetic data. The resulting datasets are collected from over 
2,500 individuals from all over the world [6]. One effective 
way of utilizing such data is to understand the correlations 
between the observed variations in the DNA sequences in 
specific locations on the chromosome. Understanding the 
variations that influence specific diseases and conditions 
allows the prediction of risk for developing specific 
diseases/conditions in an individual’s life time. Genome-Wide 
Association Studies (GWAS)  have shown more than 107 
genes and 129 SNPs to be associated with osteoporosis [7].  
Such large genomic data sets allow for the study of complex 
disease states such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.   
These pathologies involve not only multiple gene mutation 
interactions, but also nutritional and age-related components 
[8] [2]. Unfortunately, many of these gene mutations still 
maintain some level of phenotypic ambiguity [9] [10]. 
Modern Machine Learning analysis can potentially be 
employed to overcome the difficulty imposed by the multi-
dimensional nature of the osteoporosis and CVD risk factors 
in analyzing the sequences.  Such applications allow for early 
forecast of a patient-specific frequency of occurrence for a 
particular genetic disorder in later life. It allows for 
appropriate preventative measures to be followed. 
The available sequenced genomes from the 1000 Genome 
Project enables direct examination of mutation variants with 
known relations to specified medical conditions such as 
osteoporosis. Some Machine Learning algorithms have been 
successfully utilized to decompose and understand the 
complex nature of genomic sequences in recent studies. 
Hidden Markov model utilization succeeded in identifying 
protein coding genes [11].  Support Vector Machine and 
Artificial Neural Network models identified certain genes’ 
functional RNA encoding [12].  Random forest algorithms 
were able to predict the phenotypic effects of non-
synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [13].  
Several classification algorithms were utilized in this 
paper to predict genetic markers of osteoporosis, given genetic 
markers of CVD. The results of the predictor were used to 
analyze predisposition to osteoporosis in relation to 
demographic background. The first machine learning model 
developed in this study confirms a genetic link between 
osteoporosis and CVD, which has been observed in patients.  
These results provide clues to understand genetic linkages in 
the context of population generics. Particularly, when 
analyzing larger population data sets such as the 100,000 
genomes in the UK, a result set obtained here will provide 
essential insights into future analysis. 
 
B. Mutations: SNPs 
This paper analyzes 35 SNPs, that are commonly observed 
as genetic disease related mutations. It is a mutation of one 
base for another, which occurs in more than one percent of the 
general population [14].  7 of these SNPs have direct 
indications in the expression of osteoporosis [9], while the 
other 28 SNPs have implications in both CVD and 
osteoporosis [4].  
 
C. Preceding Related Work 
 
   i. Osteoporosis-related-SNP selection 
The 7 osteoporosis-related-SNPs were chosen based on 
the study led by Hsu et al. [2], published in 2010. The 
phenotypic association of these SNPs to osteoporosis was 
demonstrated by the GWAS study [7]. 
 
   ii. Genetic Pleiotropy 
Using False Discovery Rate (FDR) statistical methods, 
Reppe et al. [3] revealed a potential genetic link between 
Cardio-Vascular Disease (CVD) and Osteoporotic conditions. 
In this paper, the potential mutant gene interactions between 
the osteoporosis-related SNPs and CVD SNPs are analyzed 
with: big data processing and analytics, predictive analytics 
based on machine learning algorithms, data visualization, and 
clustering. 
 
This paper is organized as follows: Section I is the 
introduction. In Section II, the methods and materials 
employed during the analysis and experimental developments 
are introduced. Included topics are the datasets and methods 
used, feature selections and dataset label, and evaluation 
methods. In Section III, the results and observations are 
discussed. Finally, Section IV will discuss conclusions. 
 
II. 
METHODS AND MATERIALS 
This section describes the datasets and methods employed 
in this paper. 
A. Datasets 
     i. The first dataset includes the genotypes of 35 SNPs (See 
Table I and Table II) from the 1000 Genome Project collected 
from 2504 human subjects, both male and female, from 26 
regions worldwide [5]. Given the 28 SNPs related to CVD, 
the objective was to predict occurrence of the other 7 
Osteoporosis-related SNPs (Table I),. In other words, feed 
corresponding features that represents SNPs listed in Table 
II, and predict the occurrence of SNPs listed in Table I. After 
preprocessing the data, a total number of 112 features (See 

213
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 10 no 3 & 4, year 2018, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/
2018, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
section II-B-ii) were extracted for the 28 SNPs (four possible 
pairs per SNPs), along with gender and region. The output 
label is a binary label indicating whether or not the individual 
has two or more of the high-risk Osteoporosis-related SNP(s) 
simultaneously. Note that this dataset does not contain the 
information indicating whether or not an individual 
developed osteoporosis. 
 
The input dataset used in this study included 35 sets of 
comma-separated values (CSV) files, corresponding to each 
of the observed SNPs. Each set consists of 2504 samples, 
which consists of the following information: 
• 
Sample 
ID 
with 
gender 
implication 
(Male/Female/Unknown). 
• 
Genotype (forward strand). 
• 
Population(s): 5 population categories, each divided into 
4 - 7 subcategories.  
 
Note: Gene locations of each SNP were appended to the 
given datasets to observe the proximities of each SNP to 
another 
 
ii   The second dataset is from Reppe et al’s study mentioned 
in Section I-C-ii [16]. The samples of this dataset are 
collected from the 84 post-menopausal females between the 
ages of 50 to 86 years old in Lovisenberg Diakonale Hospital 
located in Sweden. There are two components to this dataset: 
(1)  The result of Affymetrix Microarray analysis of the 
patients, the Affymetrix microarray signal values per sample, 
one “.CELL” file per patient. 
(2).  A set of biopsy results, sample ID (anonymous), age, 
gender, and the biopsy results of bone density scores, both T- 
and Z-scores, consisting of average neck, total hip, and 
average spine of each subject. 
In this paper, all “.CELL” files from (1) were processed and 
interfaced with the library, pd.hg.u133.plus.2 [17], to obtain 
the gene symbol per an array cell. Then, it was interfaced with 
SNP identifier (e.g., #rsxxx..x, with x composing an integer) 
to acquire the existing SNP(s) data per each sample. In 
acquisition of SNP existence, the signal threshold value was 
determined the average score of all samples per column (per 
array cell). Such determination was made based on the 
preceding study, which defined signal thresholds in DNA 
microarray analysis [18]. Precise mapping among gene 
identifier, SNP identifier, and chromosomal location was 
achieved via ICSC Genome Browser [19] . 
The label per sample was acquired based on the data from 
(2). Samples with the T-scores of -2.5 or less in one or more 
of neck, hip, and spine are marked as osteoporotic. The 
threshold was determined, following the World Health 
Organization (WHO) international reference standard for 
osteoporosis diagnosis [20]. T-scores were used instead of Z-
scores, based on the sample’s age and the guidelines provided 
by WHO. 
 
B. Method Design 
i. Problem Definition  
 
This study investigates the occurrence of 7 selected 
osteoporosis-related Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) 
[2] and their correlation to 28 CVD related SNPs [3] (See I-
C-i for osteoporosis-related SNPs and I-C-ii for CVD-related 
SNPs). In addition, the sample’s geographic background, 
along with the physical proximities between each of the SNPs 
were examined. The CVD related SNPs were divided into six 
subcategories: High Density Lipids proteins cholesterol 
(HDL), Low Density Lips proteins cholesterol (LDL), 
Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diatonic Blood Pressure 
(DBP), Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), and Triglycerides (TG). The 
table of osteoporosis-related SNPs (See Appendix A) 
describes the SNP identification number, normal (ancestral) 
base, high-risk (mutated) base, and the homozygous base 
pairs that are associated with a high risk of Bone Mineral 
Density (BMD) loss, and consequently the development of 
osteoporosis. 
 
ii. Features 
     As mentioned in the section II-B-i, 28 CVD-related SNPs, 
gender, and regional background of each sample were fed to 
the predictor to determine the presence of the 7 osteoporosis-
related SNPs. The label for this predictor is a boolean value, 
whether the individual has one or more high-risk 
osteoporosis-related SNP(s). 
 
iii. Predictive Analytics Algorithms: Classifiers 
 
     Various predictor algorithms were applied and compared: 
KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, 
Adaboost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. A 
systematic aggregation of these classifier results is future 
work, for example using ensemble learning algorithm. 
 
iv. Affymetrix Microarray  
     The second dataset introduced in II-A-ii-2) contains both 
the sample’s genetic profile and BMD profile. However, it 
must be noted the dataset does not represent a wide scope of 
populations. 
Running the mentioned predictor on this dataset will not only 
allow for validation of the proposed predictor design, but also 
provide an idea of how likely the mutant genes are to express 
their phenotype. 
     DNA microarray analysis allows for an evaluation of gene 
expressions profiles in a living individual.  Such analysis 
provides data about the actual utilization of a specific gene 
by a specific organism. Thus, a SNP can be shown to be 
actively used by the individual increasing the likelihood of 
the SNP being related to the phenotype, the manifestation of 
a disease state.   
     Affymetrix 
microarray 
consists 
of 
a 
grid 
of 
oligonucleotide probes produced to have a known DNA 
sequence.  The grid Microarray thus holds a specific SNP

mutation at a specific locus on the grid.  Preparations of 
labelled mRNA (cDNA / cRNA) taken from the individual 
patients can then be exposed to the entire grid containing the 
variety of SNP mutations.  Identification of a specific SNP in 
the patient is determined by the measured level of 
hybridization with the corresponding target grid position and 
the labelled cDNA/cRNA. 
     The corresponding SNP IDs were mapped through the 
affy ID and a gene symbol that are assigned to each cell, as 
well as the manual mappings of the target SNPs through a 
capability of the genome browser provided by University of 
California, Santa Cruz [19]. 
 
v. Prediction Accuracy Measure 
     In all cases of this study, the accuracy of the predictor was 
measured using 15 to 35-fold cross-validation [21]. 
 
vi. Phenotype Expression Measurement 
     The first dataset (see II-A-i), acquired from 1000 Genome 
Project lacked information on whether each individual 
developed osteoporosis or not. Therefore, another set of 
samples was sought to evaluate the geno-pheno-transfer rate 
as well as the validity of the predictor developed in this study. 
Two pieces of information had to be present in the data: 
  1)  Each sample’s SNP profiles  
  2)  Presence of the condition, osteoporosis, in each sample
 
 
vii. Visualization  
     For most humans, visualizing the dataset with a dimension 
greater than 3 is difficult, if not impossible. This study 
visualizes the dataset of over 30 essential features by 
generating various histograms and applying a K-mean 
clustering algorithm implementation to cluster the resulting 
plots into groups. As demonstrated in the result section, the 
existing 
correlations 
in 
the 
dataset 
are 
clearly                                    
displayed through this visualization method. Such method of 
visualization can aid the observers in developing an intuitive 
understanding of the dataset, effectively mirroring the 
datasets’ characteristics and patterns in them.  In addition, 
this visualization method will aid in the automated 
identification of patterns in large datasets. 
This section describes the result of the predictors ran 
against the two datasets, the data visualization and observed 
patterns.  
A. Predictor results – Dataset from 1000 Genome Project 
     The predictions were performed by the classifiers in 32 
different scenarios, each ran against an element of the 
powerset. For example, only the SNPs associated with T1D 
was input for the first iteration. TG-related SNPs were input 
for the second iteration, then DBP for the next iteration. Next, 
T1D-related and DBP-related SNPs are fed for another 
iteration, and so forth (see the 1st column of Table III for the 
combination of SNP inputs). As the Feature Length (the 
second column in Table III) increased, specific correlation 
stood out. The results obtained from various combinations of 
SNP inputs clearly showed a strong correlation between the 
7 osteoporosis-related SNPs and the HDL2 SNPs. Similarly, 
another strong correlation was found between the 7 
osteoporosis-related SNPs and SBP2 SNPs. Our best 
classifier achieved the accuracy score of 0.7769.

III. 
RESULTS 
First dataset did not contain label information,  indicating 
an   individual's BMD score. The strength of this dataset was 
the abundance and diversity of SNP data across all available 
samples. Leveraging on the well-formatted and well-
standardized dataset, the predictive analytics model was 
trained to predict the presence of osteoporosis-related SNPs. 
The prediction was a binary label - whether or not 2 or more 
homozygous osteoporosis-related SNPs were present in each

individual. The predictor predicts 'true/1' if an individual 
were to have 2 or more osteoporosis related SNPs 
simultaneously.  
 
TABLE III: PREDICTION SCORES 
 
 
     Table III shows the prediction results. The column headers 
point to the classifier algorithms used, and the row headers, 
name", point to the varied combination of CVD-related SNP 
feature sets. First, classical algorithms, KNN, Naïve Bayyes, 
Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression were applied to the 
given dataset. Most algorithms yielded a better result as the 
number of features increased, while the results of Decision 
Tree 
worsened, 
demonstrating 
overfitting. 
Stacking 
(ensemble learning) algorithm was implemented with the 4 
classic algorithms noted above, logistic regression, and 
Support Vector Machine as its base classifiers. The 
performance was measured with the 15-fold cross-validation. 
Predictor's performance improved with this classifier 
orchestration. The more robust and optimized ensemble 
learning 
methods, 
Adaboost 
and 
Random 
Forest 
implementations with decision stumps as their base 
classifiers were applied, and results were compared. A 
standard ANN implementation did not perform well with this 
dataset due to the small size of the dataset. The highest result 
of 0.7769 accuracy score was captured with Logistic 
Regression when HDL, TG, SBP, and DBP subcategories of 
the CVD-SNPs were used to train and test the model. For 
more information on parameter values applied, please contact 
the authors. 
 
     The prediction results demonstrate the relationships 
between CVD-related SNPs and osteoporosis disease. These 
results show calculable relationships between CVD and 
Osteoporosis.  The Predictor could now be used for early 
stage warning for future disorders.This implies that the CVD 
patients may have a higher chance of developing 
osteoporosis. It also indicates the possibility of predicting 
Osteoporosis at an early stage based on CVD-related factors 
such as Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, and Triglycerides levels.  
 
B. Predictor results – Affy dataset  
     The performances of the predictive model for 3 different 
scenarios are listed in the following. We calculated ROC 
AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic – Area Under 
Curve) to evaluate the performance of the system. Unlike the 
previous experiment, this experiment setting did not 
distinguish high-risk heterozygous pair vs. high-risk 
homozygous pair. Here are the results for 3 different  
Scenarios: 
scenario 1 - Osteoporosis SNPs only – AUC = 0.7285 
scenario 2 - CVD SNPs only – AUC = 0.7569 
scenario 3 - Both CVD and Osteo SNPs - AUC = 0.8571 
 
     The predictor strategy developed here has been confirmed 
with the available disease related database of Reppe et al.  
The predictor was shown to be correct in the majority of the 
patients. These results also confirm the correlation of 
osteoporosis SNPs with CVD SNPs reported in the previous 
section. 
     In most cases, the chance of a mutant genotype expressing 
its aberrant phenotype is much less than 100%. As a well-
studied example, the two mutations related to Breast Cancer, 
BRCA – 1 and BRAC – 2, show such occurance.  The 
chances these two mutations expressing their phenotypes by 
the time a woman is 70 years old are 55% for BRCA-1, and 
45% for BRCA-2, according to a report by the Susan G. 
Komen Foundation [22].  
     The accuracy of the predictor developed with this paper of 
close to 70% demonstrated an effective prediction.  Such a 
score would thus be reasonably effective to caution 
individuals about having a higher risk of BMD loss. With 
such knowledge, individuals can take the necessary 
preventative measures to prevent the development of 
undesirable conditions and disease, starting at an early stage 
of their lives. 
 
C. Statistical Analytics and Data Visualization 
     To effectively visualize the existing correlations among 
this moderately high dimensional dataset, various histograms 
were drawn, using python Matplotlib library [23]. The 
histograms shown in the following figures demonstrate the 
number of occurrences of each SNP that corresponds to the 
indices on the x-axis. For the numerical values of all 
visualized data, please contact the authors. 
     The histograms drawn based on gender, male and 
female, did not display significant variation in their 
osteoporosis-related SNP profiles. However, distinct 
patterns were observed in the histograms drawn based 
on various geographical regions. Figure 1 demonstrates 
two completely different SNP profiles that come from two

regions that are located far apart. Figure 2 demonstrates 
two similar SNP profiles that come from two regions that 
are closely located.

Figure 2: Similar SNP Profiles 
 
     To further investigate the histogram patterns, all 
histograms were manually grouped based on profile 
similarity. The results of the division are five larger 
categories and twelve subcategories. 
     The aim of this section is to group the histograms into 
several categories solely based on the shape of the plots, thus 
SNP profile. To eliminate any bias in the histogram grouping, 
we removed all labels from the plots. The results 
demonstrated that the grouping solely based on plot shapes 
perfectly matched the grouping based on the geographical 
regions. The groups also demonstrated that regional 
backgrounds known to have higher rates of Osteoporosis also 
have more SNPs present (see Fig 3). Thus, two important 
conclusions can be drawn here: 
  1)     The 7 SNP profiles are dependent on an individual's 
regional background. 
  2)     The more of these 7 SNPs the individuals have, the 
more they are predisposed to developing osteoporosis. 
 1. Regional Divide  
     The grouping results demonstrated the divides in people’s 
SNP characteristics. This result is consistent with the idea 
that a person’s genetic construct is dependent on the region, 
in which his/her genes have evolved.  
 2. Number of SNPs in an Individual 
     It has been statistically shown that Europeans tend to 
develop osteoporosis more frequently and they are more 
prone to bone mass density (BMD) loss, thus leading to major 
bone fractures, compared to Africans. It has also been shown 
that compared to Swedish Europeans, East Asians have a 
lesser chance of developing osteoporosis, particularly in 
women [4]. Even though we concluded that there were no 
significant 
differences 
in 
osteoporosis-related 
SNP 
distributions among the two genders, the differences in 
hormonal systems and the pregnancy events make females 
more vulnerable to a development of osteoporosis [24]. The 
results obtained here are consistent with such claims.

     As shown in Figure 3, the 7 osteoporosis-related SNPs are 
found much more frequently in European region, compared 
to Africa or Asia. This observation is consistent with the fact 
that European women tend to have a higher incident of 
osteoporosis and hip fractures.  Individuals of European 
heritage have a much greater possibility of the presence of 
osteoporotic mutations than African individuals [25]. 
     Such a result leads to the following question: Do these 
regional groupings change with the inclusion of another SNP 
related to osteoporosis? What would happen to the histogram 
profile if we added more SNPs that are associated with 
osteoporosis/BMD to the histogram plots?  
According to the GWAS Catalogue, there are over 60 to 107 
identified SNPs that have correlations to osteoporosis/BMD 
loss, in addition to the 7 osteoporosis-related SNPs that are 
strongly associated by GWAS [7]. 
 
F. Plot Grouping (8 SNPs) to Test Correlation 
In this section, another SNP (randomly chosen from the 
osteoporosis-related SNPs) was added, histograms were 
drawn, and grouping was done in the same way as on the 
original 7 SNP regional profiling.  The 8th SNP, rs2569031, 
was the identified high-risk base pair added here. The 
overview of the grouping results is shown in Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4: Randomly Chosen Additional SNP Profile Injection 
 
     The new SNP profile clustering (Figure 4) clearly follows 
the trend derived from the 7 SNPs grouping. The 8th SNP 
was found frequently in the leftmost group (European 
region), whereas it was found less frequently in the rightmost 
group (African region).  
The identical procedures were applied to the CVD-related 
SNPs. The results of the clustering confirmed high 
correlations between region and the SNP profile, particularly 
for SBP and HDL related SNPs (See Figure 5). 
     Figure 6 shows the comparison with the HDL SNP 
profiles of people of Europe and Africa. It clearly reaffirms 
to the points made above.

G. Clustering Automation 
     To verify the manual regional grouping of the histogram 
profiles, an automated clustering process was developed, 
utilizing KMeans clustering algorithm [26].  
     KMeans clustering is accomplished by minimizing the 
sum of the distances between the chosen centroids and each 
data point within the group, to which each centroid belongs 
to (See Equation 1). This algorithm was determined to be 
suitable for this experiment for two reasons: 1) The 
dimensionality of the dataset is not extremely large. 2) The 
number of clusters that the algorithm was approximated 
during the manual grouping.

     Figure 7 shows a sample result of this automated 
clustering.  
 
     Sample groups obtained in automated histogram

osteoporosis- and CVD-related SNP profiles. Left Most 
Column: [Europa, Iberian Population in Spain, Utah 
Residents (CEPH) with Northern and Western European 
Ancestry, British in England and Scotland, Finnish in 
Finland, Toscani in Italia], Middle Column: [Bengali from

from the UK, Gujarati Indian from Houston, Texas, Punjabi 
from Lahore, Pakistan], Right Most Column: [Peruvians 
from Lima, Peru, Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico, Mexican 
Ancestry from Los Angeles USA, Colombians from 
Medellin, Colombia]. The result of clustering confirms the 
regional divide of the histogram profiles.  
 
     To demonstrate the value of this clustering automation, 
the final number of clusters to be formed by the algorithm 
was varied. As shown in Figure 8, when the number of 
clusters is set to 12, the algorithm groups South Asian SNP 
profiles and American SNP profiles into two separate groups, 
perfectly distinguishing the two separate regions. However, 
when the number of clusters is set to 11, the South Asian 
profiles and American profiles are bundled up into a single 
group. Such a result shows the possibility of further the 
effects of osteoporosis on humans are even important to 
NASA. Their studies have found that within a few days at 
low gravity, astronauts show significant bone density loss. 
NASA and other space agencies are actively investigating the 
exact effects of the outer space specific environments on 
human biological systems. Understanding such effects on 
skeletal system, cardiovascular system, nervous system, 
reproductive system, and our genome is crucial when 
attempting to adapt to an unknown environment. Being able 
to use an astronaut’s genetic predisposition to predict how 
that individual’s body might respond to zero or low Gravity 
could only improve the outcome of commercial space flight 
and the expansion of humanity into space. The Chinese state 
that they will have a manned Moon base by the end of 2019. 
What will be the effect of one sixth Earth gravity of those 
individuals? The data has yet to be collected. Such a result 
shows the possibility of further dissection of the regionalism 
seen here by the automated process. Automation of the 
histogram profiles also allowed increased number of SNPs to 
be analyzed all at once.

H. The Number of SNPs per Individual 
     An unexpected finding in this study was that there was 
no individual who had all of the 7 osteoporosis-related 
SNPs simultaneously. The maximum number of SNPs that 
occurred in one individual was 4 out of the 7 SNPs, and 5 
out of the 8 osteoporosis-related SNPs. Although four of 
the 7 osteoporosis-related SNPs are more likely to be 
found in osteoporotic females, and some are more likely 
to be found in males [2], all 7 SNPs were seen in at least 
26 counts among males, 35 counts among females 
Such cases, in which individuals have all 7 mutations 
were perhaps eliminated over the course of evolution.

can provide an effective aid to medical professionals in the 
diagnosis of future disease expression based on a person’s 
genetic profiles, biological signs, and family histories. An 
appropriate set of treatments/ remedies can thus be generated, 
utilizing the predictor.

CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION  
The mutation frequency profiles related to Osteoporosis 
displayed geographical regionalism. These data are 
consistent with the occurrence of the clinical observation for 
the development of osteoporosis. This observation lead to the 
development of a predictive model to measure the

Figure 8: A Sample Auto-Clustering Result 
Within the past few years, over 1200 ancient genome have 
been sequenced [27]. If these osteoporosis SNPs display 
regionalities, it would be of interest to determine how far 
back in human history these SNPs might go. With the 
publication of many ancient human genomes, we now have 
the opportunity to examine the fuller history of mutations 
among humans. We have taken a brief look at the 
Neanderthals genome [28] and found the presence of these 
SNPs. Further analysis would allow us to construct a 
phylogenetic tree of osteoporosis mutations. Closer look into 
our past may help us better educated look into the future. 
 
Summary of the Results: 
i.  Our results demonstrated that there was a high correlation 
between a person’s regional background and the occurrence 
of the selected 35 SNPs associated with osteoporosis and/or 
CVD. This finding conformed to the claims in some of the 
preceding Osteoporosis population/demographic studies: 
highest fracture rates are found in white women of European 
descent. African Americans tend to have higher BMD [25]. 
Swedish elderly women tend to suffer from bone fracture 
more often than Asian elderly women [5].  
 
ii.  In all 2504 individuals examined, the minimum and 
maximum occurrence of the selected 7 Osteoporosis-related 
SNPs in an individual was between 0 and 4 respectively, and 
1 and 16 in all 35 SNPs. No individual with all 7 
Osteoporosis-related SNPs was present among the 2504 
individuals. 
 
iii. Our results demonstrated that there were distinct 
correlations between the 7 Osteoporosis-related SNPs and 
CVD related SNPs (8 SNPs). This finding strongly indicated 
the CVD patients might have a higher chance of developing 
Osteoporosis. Such correlation data can be utilized to predict 
Osteoporosis at an early stage based on CVD-related factors 
such as Cholesterol level, Blood Pressure, and Triglycerides 
level.   
 
iv. Our algorithm demonstrated that the set of CVD-/ 
Osteoporosis -related SNPs from     Reppe et al's dataset can 
be used to predict a person's likelihood of developing 
osteoporosis on their own without factoring in any non-
genetic factors such as food intake, exercise habits, and other 
drug intake and medication.  
 
v. We have shown that Histogram analysis and auto-
clustering of such histograms is a highly effective 
visualization technique, capturing existing correlations 
among a high dimensional dataset. 
 
     The United Kingdom is now half way through its 100,000 
Genome Project.  The goal of obtaining this massive human 
genome dataset was to determine genetic predisposition to 
genetic related diseases such as cancer, CVD and 
osteoporosis.  We hope that the automated systems developed 
here will be of significant assistance in achieving these goals.
