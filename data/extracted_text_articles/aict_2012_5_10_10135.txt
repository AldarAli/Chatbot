Abstract—We study a single-link multirate loss system,
which accommodates both elastic and adaptive trafﬁc of
Poisson arriving calls, with exponentially distributed service
time and ﬂexible bandwidth requirements. If the available
link bandwidth is not enough to accept a new call with its
peak-bandwidth requirement, then the call can retry one or
more times (single/multi-retry loss models) to be connected
in the system with reduced bandwidth. If its last bandwidth
requirement remains higher than the available link bandwidth,
the call can still be accepted in the system, by compressing
the bandwidth of all in-service calls together with its last
bandwidth requirement. The proposed models do not have a
product form solution, and therefore we propose approximate
recursive formulas for the efﬁcient calculation of call blocking
probabilities. The consistency and the accuracy of our models
are veriﬁed by simulation, and found to be very satisfactory.
Keywords-Poisson process; elastic/adaptive trafﬁc; call block-
ing; Markov chains; recurrent formula.
I. INTRODUCTION
The call-level QoS assessment in modern telecom net-
works remains an open issue, due to the existence of elastic
and adaptive trafﬁc. By the term “elastic trafﬁc” we mean
calls that can compress their bandwidth, while simultane-
ously increasing their service time, during their lifetime in
the system, so that the product service time by bandwidth
remains constant. In the case of “adaptive trafﬁc”, calls can
compress their bandwidth but they do not alter their service
time. The call-level modeling of elastic and adaptive trafﬁc
is mostly based on the classical Erlang Multirate Loss Model
(EMLM) ([ [1]- [2]) which has been widely used in wired
(e.g. [3]- [5]), wireless (e.g. [6]- [7]) and optical networks
(e.g. [8]- [10]) to model systems that accommodate calls of
different service-classes.
In the EMLM, Poisson arriving calls of different service-
classes compete for the available link bandwidth under the
complete sharing policy (all calls compete for all bandwidth
resources). Calls are blocked and lost if their required band-
width is higher than the available link bandwidth. Accepted
calls remain in the link for a generally distributed service
time [1]. The fact that the steady-state probabilities of the
EMLM have a Product Form Solution (PFS) leads to an
accurate calculation of Call Blocking Probabilities (CBP)
via the Kaufman-Roberts recursive formula [1], [2]. In [11],
the EMLM is extended to include retrials. Blocked calls can
immediately retry one or more times (Single- and Multi-
Retry loss Model, SRM and MRM, respectively) to be
connected in the system by requiring less bandwidth units
(b.u.). A retry call is blocked and lost if its last bandwidth
requirement is higher than the available link bandwidth.
In this paper, we consider a system supporting elastic
and adaptive trafﬁc with single/multi retrials. If the available
link bandwidth is less than or equal to the last bandwidth
requirement of a retry call, the system compresses it, down to
a minimum proportion (common to all calls) of its required
last bandwidth, together with the bandwidth of all in-service
calls. If the resulting bandwidth is less than the available link
bandwidth, the new call is accepted; otherwise is blocked
and lost. When a call, whose bandwidth is compressed,
departs from the system, then all in-service calls expand
their bandwidth. Due to retrials/compression, the models
(single and multi-retry model) do not have a PFS. However,
we propose approximate recursive formulas for the link
occupancy distribution, and consequently CBP, calculation.
Simulation results validate the proposed models and show
very good accuracy. If only elastic trafﬁc exists in the link,
then the proposed models coincide with the models of [12].
In the case of no retrials for calls of all service-classes, the
proposed models coincide with the model of [13], which
is named, herein, Extended EMLM (E-EMLM). In [14],
elastic/adaptive calls have several bandwidth requirements
and request for bandwidth, upon their arrival, according to
the occupied link bandwidth (i.e. calls do not retry).
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
review the E-EMLM, the SRM and the MRM. In Section III,
we present the proposed models and provide formulas for the
approximate calculation of CBP. In Section IV, we present
analytical and simulation results to evaluate the accuracy and
consistency of our models. We conclude in Section V.
II. REVIEW OF THE E-EMLM AND MULTIRATE LOSS
MODELS WITH RETRIALS
A. Review of the E-EMLM
Consider a link of capacity C b.u. that accommodates K
service-classes and let T>C be the limit that determines the
maximum permitted bandwidth compression among calls;
the higher parameter T, the higher permitted compression.
A service-class k (k = 1, . . . , K) can be elastic or adaptive.

Let Ke and Ka be the set of elastic and adaptive service-
classes (Ke +Ka = K), respectively. Service-class k calls
follow a Poisson process with rate λk, request bk b.u.
(peak-bandwidth requirement) and have an exponentially
distributed service time with mean µ−1
k . Let j be the
occupied link bandwidth, j = 0, 1, . . . , T, when a service-
class k call arrives in the link. If j +bk ≤ C, the call is
accepted in the link with bk, µ−1
k . If j +bk > T the call is
blocked and lost. If T ≥ j +bk > C the call is accepted in
the link by compressing its bandwidth and the bandwidth of
all in-service calls. The compressed bandwidth of the new
service-class k call is given by:
b
′
k = rbk = C
j′ bk
(1)
where r is the compression factor (common to all service-
classes) given by r ≡ r(n)=C/j, j
′ =j +bk=nb+bk, n=
(n1, n2, ..., nk, ..., nK), b=(b1, b2, ..., bk, ..., bK) and nk is the
number of in-service calls of service-class k in steady state.
Similarly, all in-service calls compress their bandwidth
to b
′
i = C
j′ bi for i = 1, ..., K. After the compression of all
calls the link state is j =C. So, the link operates at its full
capacity and all calls share this capacity in proportion to
their peak-bandwidth requirement. The minimum bandwidth
that a service-class k call (new or in-service) tolerates is:
b
′
k,min = rminbk = C
T bk
(2)
where rmin is the minimum proportion of peak-bandwidth.
When a service-class k call, with bandwidth b
′
k, departs
from the system, the remaining in-service calls of each
service-class i (i = 1, ..., K), expand their bandwidth in
proportion to their peak-bandwidth bi. After bandwidth
compression/expansion, all elastic service-class k calls (k=
1, ..., Ke) increase/decrease their service time so that the
product service time by bandwidth remains constant. Adap-
tive service-class calls do not alter their service time.
The bandwidth compression mechanism destroys re-
versibility in the model and therefore no PFS exists. How-
ever, in [13] an approximate recursive formula is proposed
for the calculation of the link occupancy distribution, G(j):
G(j)=

is the offered trafﬁc-load (in erl) of
service-class k calls.
The proof of (3) is based on a reversible Markov chain
which approximates the bandwidth compression/expansion
mechanism of the E-EMLM. The local balance (LB) equa-
tions of this Markov chain are of the form [13]:
λkP(n−
k ) = nkµkφk(n)P(n)
(4)
where P(n) is the probability distribution of state n, P(n−
k )
is the probability distribution of n−
k =(n1, n2, ..., nk−1, nk−
1, nk+1, ..., nK) and φk(n) is a state dependent factor which
describes: i) the bandwidth compression factor and ii) the in-
crease factor of service time of service-class k (k=1, ..., K)
calls in state n. In other words, φk(n) has the same role with
r in (1) but it may be different for each service-class. The
values of φk(n) are determined by:
φk(n)=

Review of multirate loss models with retrials
Consider again a link of capacity C b.u. that accommo-
dates Poisson arriving calls of K service-classes. Calls of
service-class k (k = 1, ..., K) have an arrival rate λk and
request bk b.u. If bk b.u. are available, a call of service-
class k remains in the system for an exponentially distributed
service-time with mean µ−1
k . Otherwise, the call is blocked
and retries to be connected with parameters (bkr, µ−1
kr ) where
bkr < bk and µ−1
kr > µ−1
k . The SRM does not have a PFS
and therefore the determination of G(j), is based on an
approximate recursive formula, [11]:
G(j)=

The proof of (8) is based on two assumptions: 1) the
application of LB, which exists only in PFS models and
2) the application of Migration Approximation (MA) which
assumes that the occupied link bandwidth from retry calls

Bkr =

The MRM does not have a PFS and therefore the calculation
of G(j), is based on an approximate recursive formula [11]:

III. MULTIRATE LOSS MODELS OF ELASTIC &
ADAPTIVE TRAFFIC WITH RETRIALS
A. The elastic-adaptive single-retry loss model
The proposed Elastic-Adaptive Single-Retry loss Model
(EA-SRM) is a non-PFS model that combines the charac-
teristics of the E-EMLM and the SRM. In order to prove
an approximate but recursive formula for the calculation of
G(j), the following example is presented.
Consider a link of capacity C b.u. that accommodates
Poisson arriving calls of two service-classes. The 1st service-
class is adaptive and the 2nd is elastic. Only calls of the 2nd
service-class have retry parameters. The trafﬁc parameters
are: (λ1, µ−1
1 , b1) and (λ2, µ−1
2 , µ−1
2r , b2, b2r) with b2r < b2
and µ−1
2r > µ−1
2 . Bandwidth compression is permitted for
calls of both service-classes up to a limit T. Although the
EA-SRM is a non-PFS model we use the LB of (4), initially
for calls of the 1st service-class:
λ1P(n−
1 ) = n1µ1φ1(n)P(n),
1 ≤ nb ≤ T
(13)
where n = (n1, n2, n2r), n−
1 = (n1−1, n2, n2r) with n1 ≥ 1
and
φ1(n) =





1
, for nb ≤ C, n ∈ Ω
x(n−
1 )
x(n) , for C < nb ≤ T, n ∈ Ω
0
, otherwise
(14)
with nb = j=n1b1 + n2b2 + n2rb2r.
Based on (14) and by multiplying both sides of (13) with
b1 and r(n) we have:
α1b1x(n)r(n)P(n−
1)=n1b1x(n−
1)r(n)P(n), 1≤nb≤T
(15)
where α1 =λ1µ−1
1
and r(n) = min(1, C/j).
The LB equations of the 2nd service-class calls are derived
as follows:
a) If a call arrives in the system and j +b2 ≤ C then it is
accepted with b2 b.u. Thus, the following LB equation holds:
λ2P(n−
2 )=n2µ2φ2(n)P(n),
1 ≤ nb ≤ C
(16)
where φ2(n) = x(n−
2 )
x(n) = 1, when 1 ≤ nb ≤ C and n−
2 =
(n1, n2−1, n2r) with n2 ≥1.
Multiplying both sides of (16) with b2 we have:
α2b2x(n)P(n−
2 )=n2b2x(n−
2 )P(n), 1≤nb≤C
(17)
where α2 =λ2µ−1
2 .
b) If a call arrives in the system and j+b2 >C then the call is
blocked with b2 and immediately retries with b2r <b2. Now
if: 1) j+b2r ≤C the retry call is accepted in the system with
b2r, 2) j+b2r >T the retry call is blocked and lost and 3)
C < j+b2r ≤ T the retry call is accepted in the system by
compressing its bandwidth requirement b2r together with the
bandwidth of all in-service calls. The compressed bandwidth
of the retry call is b
′
2r =rb2r =
C
j+b2r b2r. Thus,
λ2P(n−
2r)=n2rµ2rφ2r(n)P(n), for C−b2+b2r<nb≤T
(18)
where P(n−
2r) is the probability distribution of state n−
2r =
(n1, n2, n2r−1) with n2r ≥1 and
φ2r(n) =





, for nb ≤ C, n ∈ Ω
x(n−
2r)
x(n) , for C <nb≤T, n ∈ Ω
0
, otherwise
(19)
Based on (19) and by multiplying both sides of (18) with
b2r we have:
α2rb2rx(n)P(n−
2r)=n2rb2rx(n−
2r)P(n), for C−b2+b2r<nb≤T
(20)
where α2r =λ2rµ−1
2r .
Eqs. (15), (17) and (20) lead to a system of equations:
α1b1x(n)r(n)P(n−
1 ) + α2b2x(n)P(n−
2 )
= (n1b1x(n−
1 )r(n) + n2b2x(n−
2 ))P(n)

2r))P(n)
(23)
for C < nb ≤ T.
Eqs. (21)-(23) are combined in one equation by assuming
that calls with b2r are negligible when 1≤nb≤C−b2+b2r
(MA) and calls with b2 are negligible when C <nb≤T:
α1b1x(n)r(n)P(n−

2 )+
+α2rb2rγ2r(nb)x(n)P(n−

(n1b1x(n−
1 )r(n)+n2b2x(n−
2 )+n2rb2rx(n−
2r))P(n)
(24)
for 0 ≤ n ≤ T,
where γ2(nb)=1 for 1≤nb≤C, otherwise γ2(nb)=0 and
γ2r(nb)=1 for C−b2+b2r <nb≤T, otherwise γ2r(nb)=0.
At this point, we derive a formula for x(n) by making the
following assumptions:
1) When C < nb ≤T, n ∈ Ω, the bandwidth of all in-
service calls should be compressed by φk(n), k=1, 2,
so that:
n1b
′
1 + n2b
′
2 + n2rb
′
2r = C
(25)
2) We keep the product service time by bandwidth of
service-class k calls (elastic or adaptive) in state n
of the irreversible Markov chain equal to the corre-
sponding product in the same state n of the reversible
Markov chain:
b1r(n)

b2rr(n)
µ2rr(n) =
b
′
2r
µ2rφ2r(n) or b
′
2r = b2rφ2r(n)
(26)
By substituting (26) in (25) we obtain:
n1b1φ1(n)r(n) + n2b2φ2(n) + n2rb2rφ2r(n) = C
(27)
where φ1(n), φ2(n) are given by (14) and φ2r(n) by (19).
Eq. (27), due to (14) and (19), is written as:
x(n)=

0
, otherwise
(28)
Based on (28), we consider again (24). Since x(n) = 1,
when 0≤ nb ≤C, it is proved in [11] that:
α1b1G(j−b1)+α2b2G(j−b2)+α2rb2rγ2r(j)G(j−b2r)=jG(j)
(29)
for 1≤j ≤C and γ2r(j)=1 for C−b2+b2r <j.
To prove (29), the MA is needed, which assumes that 2nd
service-class retry calls do not exist in states j ≤C−b2+b2r.
When C <nb≤T, we have γ2(nb)=0 and based on (28),
we can write (24) as follows:
C
j α1b1P(n−
1 )+α2rb2rγ2r(nb)P(n−
2r)=CP(n)
(30)
since r(n)=C/j, when C <nb ≤T.
To introduce the link occupancy distribution G(j) in (30),
we sum both sides of (30) over Ωj ={n ∈ Ω |nb = j}:
C
j α1b1
X
{n|nb=j}
P(n−
1)+α2rb2rγ2r(j)
X
{n|nb=j}
P(n−
2r)=C
X
{n|nb=j}
P(n)
(31)
Since P
n∈Ωj P(n)=G(j), (31) is written as:
C
j α1b1G(j − b1) + α2rb2rγ2r(j)G(j−b2r) = CG(j) (32)
where γ2r(j)=1 for C−b2+b2r <j ≤T.
The combination of (29) and (32) gives an approximate
recursive formula for the calculation of G(j) (for 1≤j ≤T)
when the 1st service-class is adaptive and the 2nd service-
class is elastic with retrials:
G(j) = 1
j α1b1G(j−b1)+
1
min(j,C)[α2b2γ2(j)G(j−b2)+α2rb2rγ2r(j)G(j−b2r)]
(33)
where γ2(j)=1 for 1≤j ≤C, γ2r(j)=1 for C−b2+b2r<j≤T.
In the case of K service-classes and assuming that all
service-classes may have retry parameters, (33) becomes:

IV. APPLICATION EXAMPLE - EVALUATION
For evaluation, we present an application example and
compare the analytical CBP with those obtained by simula-
tion [15]. Since the reliability ranges of the measurements
(95% conﬁdence interval) are very small, we present only
mean values (from 7 runs).
A link of capacity C = 80 b.u. accommodates three
service-classes whose calls follow a Poisson process. Calls
of the 1st and 2nd service-class are adaptive and do not retry,
while calls of the 3rd service-class are elastic and may retry.
Their bandwidth requirements are b1=1 b.u., b2=2 b.u. and
b3=6 b.u., respectively. The reduced bandwidth of the 3rd
service-class calls, for two retrials (at most), are: b3r1 =5
b.u. and b3r2=4 b.u. The call holding time is exponentially
distributed with mean value µ−1

initial values of the offered trafﬁc-load are: α1 = 20 erl,

α2 =6 erl and α3 =2 erl. For the retrials of the 3rd service-
class note that: α3b3 = α3r1b3r1 =α3r2b3r2. In the x-axis of
all ﬁgures, we let α3 =2 erl, while α1, α2 increase in steps
of 1.0 and 0.5 erl, respectively. The last values are: α1 =26
erl, α2 =9 erl. We consider three values of T: a) T =C =80
b.u., where no bandwidth compression takes place and the
EA-MRM gives the same CBP results with the MRM, b)
T = 82 b.u. where rmin = C/T = 80/82 and c) T = 84 b.u.
where rmin =C/T = 80/84. In Figs. 1, 2 and 3, we present
the analytical and simulation CBP results of the 1st, 2nd
and 3rd service-class (CBP of calls with b3r2), respectively,
for all values of T. All ﬁgures show that our analytical
models are: i) of absolutely satisfactory accuracy (compared
to simulation) and ii) consistent, since the increase of T
results in a CBP decrease, due to bandwidth compression.
V. CONCLUSION
We propose multirate loss models for a link with elastic
and adaptive trafﬁc. When Poisson arriving calls are blocked,
with their initial bandwidth, have the ability to retry to be
connected in the system one (EA-SRM) or more times (EA-
MRM). If a retry call is blocked with its last bandwidth,
it can still be accepted in the system by compressing its
last bandwidth together with the bandwidth of all in-service
calls. We propose approximate but recursive formulas for
the efﬁcient CBP calculation. Simulation results verify the
analytical results and show that our models are accurate and
consistent.
