Abstract—People in business and academic ﬁelds work in
cooperation rather than alone. They may discuss their progress
with others, like co-workers and supervisors, to help them
obtain the best results, and sometimes, they may feel that
such discussions are not conducted well. However, people do
not evaluate the quality of each discussion on every occasion
because it is tough work for them, and they usually do not have
enough time for that. In the process of evaluating discussions,
people might look back on their discussions and make a plan to
have an improved discussion next time. This paper proposes a
generation method for a discussion process model during research
progress. First, discussions are recorded to generate transcripts
in which each line has a speaker name and his/her utterance.
Then, the transcripts are classiﬁed manually into high-quality
and low-quality discussion groups. Next, dialog acts are assigned
to utterances as labels. The labels of dialog acts are originally
designed for discussion analysis for research progress. After the
labeling, transitions of dialog acts with a high appearance rate
are extracted. The transitions are connected if the same dialog
act is in both transitions to make a network of dialog acts. The
network represents a model of the discussion process. A model
for a high-quality discussion group is compared with a model for
a low-quality discussion group. By investigating dialog acts and
transitions found only in one group, suggestions for low-quality
discussions to high-quality discussions would be found. We used
discussions between a supervisor and a student who was studying
for a degree at a university. We generated models for high-quality
and low-quality discussion groups by the proposed method and
revealed suggestions for low-quality discussions to high-quality
discussions. Our contributions are summarized in two points: (1)
we proposed a new method to generate models that represent the
discussion process, and (2) we found suggestions for low-quality
discussions to high-quality discussions using the models obtained.

I. INTRODUCTION
People in business and academic ﬁelds work in cooperation
rather than alone. They must discuss their working progress
with others, like co-workers and supervisors, to help them ob-
tain the best results. Such people can exchange their opinions
and advise each other. These discussions make people not only
understand what others think but also ensure that members of
the team agree with their work.
Discussions are sometimes not conducted well. This hap-
pens because discussions have a time limit, and people often
fail to arrive at a common understanding because of a differ-
ence in their thinking styles. However, people do not evaluate
the quality of each discussion every time because it is tough
work for them; they usually do not have enough time for that.
In the process of evaluating discussions, people might look
back on their discussions and make a plan to have an improved
discussion next time. Discussion summarization utilizing the
text and acoustic information of the discussion might be
a support for the evaluation. However, few of the current
summarization methods could detect problems in discussions
or suggestions for those.
This paper proposes a generation method for a discussion
process model during research progress to ﬁnd suggestions
for low-quality discussions to high-quality discussions. The
proposed method divides discussions into two groups: high-
quality and low-quality discussion groups. The method makes
models for the discussion process in each group using transi-
tions of dialog acts. By comparing the two models, discussants
can ﬁnd suggestions for low-quality discussions to high-quality
discussions. The method uses discussions between a supervisor
and a student preparing for a graduation thesis. Note that we
deﬁne a high-quality discussion to be a discussion in which
both the student and his/her corresponding supervisor under-
stand their research progress. We believe that transitions of
dialog acts represent the quality of discussion. In our previous
paper [1], the basic method was proposed and preliminary
analysis results were discussed. The contribution of this paper

is summarized in two points. First, we improved the basic
method into a new method to generate a model that illustrates
the discussion process. Second, we found suggestions for
low-quality discussions to high-quality discussions using the
models.
II. RELATED WORK
The objectives of conversation and discussion analysis re-
search are classiﬁed into two types. One of them is to acquire
knowledge to develop conversational agents. The other is to
acquire knowledge to improve conversations and discussions.
The smooth interaction between conversational agents and
users requires that users feel that the agents understand them.
Thus, informing methods of information effectively that is un-
derstood by conversational agents from users’ utterances have
been proposed [2]–[4]. Conversational breakdowns between
conversational agents and users would decrease users’ satisfac-
tion, trust, and willingness to continue using the agents [5], [6].
Methods for addressing conversational breakdowns in task-
oriented dialogs have been proposed [7], [8]. These studies
analyzed conversations between agents and users to develop
conversational agents. Though we analyze discussions between
humans, the ﬁndings are utilized to improve discussions rather
than develop conversational agents.
Some approaches utilize verbal and non-verbal information
to analyze conversations between humans. Methods using non-
verbal information utilize gaze information, hand gestures, and
acoustic information [9]. Gaze information is related to turn-
taking in conversations [10]. It can estimate the degree of
engagement in a conversation [11]. The effect of hand gestures
on understanding a conversation is studied [12]. These studies
analyze conversations using non-verbal information to ob-
tain ﬁndings. Conversely, the proposed method here analyzes
discussions using verbal information to obtain suggestions.
Conversations in real life are conducted by using both verbal
and non-verbal media. The present study speciﬁcally targets
language features to ﬁnd limitations to the suggestions.
The proposed method uses transcripts of discussions during
research progress to analyze the discussion process. Zehnalova
et al. and Inches et al. postulated methods for analyzing
discussion topics and context using words in transcripts [13],
[14]. Nishihara et al.’s method utilized dialog acts of utterances
in transcripts for the analysis [15]. Since topics and context
of discussions during research progress would be changed, it
makes little sense to compare topics and context between the
same or different discussants. Therefore, we propose a new
method to compare discussions using dialog acts; the types,
rates and transitions are utilized.
In linguistics and, particularly, in natural language un-
derstanding, a dialog act is an utterance, in the context of
conversational dialog, that serves a function in the dialog.
Conversation analysis often uses the dialog acts to label utter-
ances [16]–[18]. The set of dialog acts is generally composed
for every target conversations because frequent dialog acts
and the granularity depend on the conversations. Quinn et al.
posited their original dialog acts Declarative, Interrogative,
and Imperative to analyze conversations between nursing
support agents and users [19]. Germesin et al. posited two
types of dialog acts Agreement and Non-agreement to analyze
discussions on consensus building [20]. Qadir et al. developed
four types of dialog acts Commissives, Directives, Expressives,
and Representatives [21], and Lampert et al. set two types
of dialog acts Request and Non-request [22]. According to
the previous studies, we also design a new set of dialog acts
for analyzing discussions during research progress. The dialog
acts are obtained from actual utterances in the discussions we
analyze. The new set of dialog acts would be used to generate
a model for the discussion process.
As an approach for conversation analysis, both quantitative
and qualitative analysis methods have been proposed [23],
[24]. He et al. proposed a method for quantitative conversa-
tion analysis on consensus building [24]. The present study
will also be a quantitative analysis because utterances are
transformed into dialog acts, and their rates will be used for
the analysis. A quantitative analysis would be inﬂuential in
supporting discussion improvement because the analysis result
will be quantitative so that the suggestions would be posed as
concrete actions.
III. PROPOSED METHOD
Fig. 1 shows the outline of the proposed method. First, dis-
cussions are recorded and classiﬁed into high-quality and low-
quality discussion groups manually. Transcripts of each dis-
cussion are prepared manually. One line includes a speaker’s
name and an utterance. Each utterance is assigned labels
for dialog acts. A matrix of the transition of dialog acts
for each group is obtained. Each factor of the matrix has a
transition rate between two different dialog acts. Transitions
with a high rate are extracted from the matrix. The extracted
transitions are connected if the same dialog act is included,
and then a model for the discussion process is obtained. Two
models for high-quality and low-quality discussion groups are
obtained. By comparing the two models for high-quality and
low-quality discussion groups, common and different points
are investigated. It is posited that dialog acts and transitions
included in the high-quality discussion group but not present
in the low-quality would be suggestions for improving low-
quality discussions to high-quality discussions. Discussants
refer to the suggestions to have a better discussion next time.
A. Making transcripts of discussions
We posit that a research discussion should be conducted
face-to-face. Research discussions are recorded by a voice
recorder to generate transcripts. The proposed method uses
transcripts of discussions to make a model for the discussion
process. One line of a transcript includes a speaker’s name
and an utterance; an utterance includes ﬁllers. The length
of sound in a word (e.g., “weeeeeeeeell” is represented as
just “well”), the length of silent time, and the information of
laughing (e.g., “ha-ha-ha”) are omitted. An utterance includes
several sentences before turn-taking occurs. TABLE I exhibits
an example of a part of a transcript.

B. Labeling Dialog Acts to Utterances
Each utterance in a transcript is labeled with dialog acts.
Though automatic labeling methods have been proposed [15],
[25], the labeling accuracy is not enough to generate accurate
models. Therefore, each utterance is labeled manually.
Though label sets of dialog acts also have been pro-
posed [19]–[22], [26], most of the sets of labels have their
target discussions and conversations. We design a new set
of labels for our target discussions, that is, discussions for
research progress.
TABLE II shows designed labels for dialog acts. These
labels are designed by referring to transcripts of discussions
that will be used in experiments in Section IV. An utterance
from a supervisor and that from a student will be distinguished

by a subscript to a label (T and S). The proposed method uses
31 × 2 = 62 types of the label for dialog acts in total.
When labeling dialog acts to an utterance, the already
appeared utterances are also considered because one utterance
may not have enough information for labeling. If a student
says “Yes” to a question from a supervisor, it means “Yes,
you are right” labeled as “Answer S.” However, if a student
says “Yes” to a proposal from a supervisor, it means “Yes, I
will do it” labeled as “Agreement S.” The two instances of
“Yes” are different types of utterance. Multiple labels may be
put to an utterance because a single utterance may have several
roles.
C. Making a matrix of transition rates of dialog acts
A matrix of transition rates of dialog acts is obtained for
each group. The transition rate means a rate between labels for
dialog acts. Suppose that ith utterance has a vector of labels

L(i) and jth utterance has a vector of labels L(j) (j = i+1).
L(i) is described by Eq. (1).
L(i) = {ln|0 <= n <= 61},
(1)
where n is an index of label ln which is equal to 0 or 1. If
an nth label is put to an utterance, ln = 1. Otherwise, ln = 0.
The frequency of transition from the label ln in L(i) to the
label lm in L(j) is counted up if both ln and lm are not equal
to zero. Let the frequency be fn,m. Let the number of lines
of the transcript be NL. NL − 1 is the number of turn-taking
in a discussion. The transition rate rn,m from the label ln to
the label lm is calculated by Eq. (2).
rn,m =
fn,m
NL − 1,
(2)
where n and m are indices of labels. By assigning a rate rn,m
to each cell, a matrix of transition rates is obtained. TABLE III
illustrates an example of a part of the matrix.
D. Making a model for the discussion process
A model of the discussion process for each group is obtained
by using the matrix of transition rates. Transitions of dialog
acts with a rate more than the threshold TH are extracted
from the matrix. The extracted transitions are connected if
the same dialog act is included in two different transitions.
The network of connected transitions will be a model for the
discussion process.
E. Comparing models to ﬁnd suggestions
The two models for high-quality and low-quality discussion
groups are compared. The comparison is conducted by inves-
tigating dialog acts and transitions included in the models.
First, common points in dialog acts and transitions between
the two models are found. Then, different points between
the two models are investigated. The different points might
be suggestions for low-quality discussions to high-quality
discussions.
IV. EXPERIMENT
We investigated whether the proposed method could gener-
ate a discussion process model corresponding to the quality
of discussion and whether the proposed method could support
ﬁnding suggestions for low-quality discussions to high-quality
discussions. We would verify the former through the experi-
ments in this section, and the latter in Section V.
A. Experimental hypotheses
We proposed two main hypotheses H1 and H2, each of
which had two smaller hypotheses; in total there were four
small hypotheses.
H1a
If the quality of the discussion is different, the dialog
acts are different.
H1b
If the quality of the discussion is different, the
transitions are different.
H2a
If the stage of the thesis is different, the dialog acts
are different.
H2b
If the stage of the thesis is different, the transitions
are different.
H1a hypothesized that if the quality of the discussion
differs between the models, the dialog acts in each model
are different. H1b was obtained by replacing dialog acts
with transitions. If those hypotheses are proved, it will be
veriﬁed that the proposed method can generate a model for
the discussion process that corresponds with the quality of
discussion.
H2a hypothesized that if the stage of the thesis differs
between the models, dialog acts in each model are different.
H2b was obtained by replacing dialog acts with transitions.
Discussions during research progress should be held by su-
pervisors and students regularly. The students will acquire the
skill of discussion by practicing discussions repeatedly. The
supervisors will also change the mode of explanation to match
each student. If those hypotheses are proved, dialog acts and
transitions only in a model of recent discussions might indicate
changes obtained by the practices repeatedly.
B. Experimental procedures
The experiments were conducted as follows:
1) The experimenter collects discussion records and classi-
ﬁes them into high-quality and low-quality discussion
groups. The experimenter collects discussions in two
stages of the thesis (early and late stages).
2) The models for high-quality and low-quality discussion
groups are obtained using the proposed method.
3) The hypotheses are tested from the four models ob-
tained.

The experiments generated four discussion process models
for:
1) a high-quality discussion group in the early stage of
the thesis,
2) a low-quality discussion group in the early stage of the
thesis,
3) a high-quality discussion group in the late stage of the
thesis, and
4) a low-quality discussion group in the late stage of the
thesis.
Hypothesis H1a was to be veriﬁed by comparing dialog acts
between models 1) and 2), and between 3) and 4). Hypothesis
H1b was to be veriﬁed by comparing transitions of dialog acts
between models 1) and 2), and between 3) and 4). Hypothesis
H2a was to be veriﬁed by comparing dialog acts between
models 1) and 3), and between 2) and 4). Hypothesis H2b was
to be veriﬁed by comparing transitions of dialog acts between
models 1) and 3), and between 2) and 4).
C. Used data
We used 16 transcripts of discussions between a supervisor
and a student in our laboratory. Half of them (eight out of
16) were collected in the early stage of the thesis (around
April in 2019), while the rest was collected in the late stage
(around October in 2019, after six months). Two supervisors
and eight students (four males and four females) were in our
laboratory, and each of the supervisors had four students. The
students were 21-22 years old and studying in the College
of Information Science and Engineering. The transcripts of
discussions were read by the ﬁrst and second authors. The
two authors classiﬁed the transcripts into two groups: a high-
quality and a low-quality discussion groups.
TABLE IV shows the details of the eight transcripts of
discussions held in the early stage of the thesis: the length
of discussion, the number of utterances from a supervisor,
and that from a student are described. The average length
of the discussions was 26min and 58s. The average number
of utterances from a supervisor was 81, whereas that from
a student was 71.5. The transcripts with IDs 1-4 were in
the high-quality discussion group, while those with IDs 5-8
were in the low-quality discussion group. TABLE V shows
the details of the eight transcripts of discussions held in the
late stage of the thesis. The average length of the discussions
was 25min and 17s. The average number of utterances from a
supervisor was 86.3, whereas that from a student was 81.0. The
transcripts with IDs 9-12 were in the high-quality discussion
group, while those with IDs 13-16 were in the opposite group.
Compared with the discussions in the early stage of the
thesis, the length was shortened by approximately 1 min,
the number of utterances from a supervisor increased (ﬁve
utterances), and the number from a student also increased (10
utterances). The increase in the number of utterances, even
in less discussion time, denotes that the discussions in the
late stage were more active. The number of utterances from
a student was more signiﬁcant than that from a supervisor,

which indicated that the students might acquire the skill of

D. Experimental results
First, we report frequently appearing labels for dialog act in
discussions of high-quality and low-quality groups. TABLE VI
and TABLE VII exhibit labels for dialog acts that appeared
more than 10 times in each group (high-quality/low-quality
in the early/late stage). Though there were common points in
appeared dialog acts, the different points were also found.
Next, we report characteristic transitions found in high-
quality and low-quality discussion groups. TABLE VIII and
TABLE IX exhibit transitions frequently appearing in each
group (the appearance rate was more than 1.7% which was
the threshold TH 1). Though there were common points in
appearing transitions of dialog acts, different points were also
found.
Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5 illustrate the models obtained for the
discussion process. Fig. 2 is for a high-quality discussion
group and Fig. 3 is for a low-quality discussion group in the
early stage. Fig. 4 is for a high-quality discussion group and
Fig. 5 is for a low-quality discussion group in the late stage.
1The rate of the used transitions was almost 40% for all transitions found
in the transcripts.

quality discussion groups in the late stage. TABLE VII shows
23 types of dialog acts in total. Thirteen of them were
common, while six of them were found only in one discussion
group. The results indicated that the dialog acts found in
the discussion process depend on the quality of discussion.
Hypothesis H1a was veriﬁed.
We investigated the differences of transitions between high-
quality and low-quality discussion groups in the early stage
to verify H1b. TABLE VIII shows 14 types of transition
in total. Four of them were common, whereas 10 of them
were found in only one group. Then, we investigated the
differences in transitions between high-quality and low-quality
discussion groups in the late stage. TABLE IX shows 16 types
of transitions in total. Five of them were common, whereas 14
of them were found only in one group. The results indicated
that the transitions found in the discussion process depend on
the quality of discussion. Hypothesis H1b was veriﬁed.
We investigated the differences of dialog acts found in high-
quality discussion groups between the early stage and the late
stage to verify H2a. TABLE VI and TABLE VII show 20
types of dialog act in high-quality discussion group. Twelve
of them were common, while eight of them were found only
in one group. Then, we investigated the differences of dialog
acts found in low-quality discussion groups between the early
stage and the late stage. TABLE VI and TABLE VII show
23 types of dialog act in low-quality discussions. Sixteen of
them were common, while seven of them were found in only
one group. The results indicated that the dialog acts found
in the discussion process depend on the stage of the thesis.
Hypothesis H2a was veriﬁed.
We investigated the differences of transitions found in high-
quality discussion groups between the early stage and the late
stage to verify H2b. TABLE VIII and TABLE IX show 17
types of transition in high-quality discussion groups. Five of
them were common, while 12 of them were found in only
one group. Then, we investigated the differences of transitions
found in low-quality discussion groups between the early stage
and the late stage. TABLE VIII and TABLE IX show 15
types of transition in low-quality discussion groups. Six of
them were common, while nine of them were found only in
one group. The results indicated that the transitions found
in the discussion process depend on the stage of the thesis.
Hypothesis H2b was veriﬁed.
Since all the hypotheses were veriﬁed, we found that the
proposed method could generate a model for the discussion
process that corresponded to the quality of discussion and the
stage of the thesis. The next section investigates suggestions
for low-quality discussions to high-quality discussions com-
paring the four models.

V. DISCUSSION
We discuss the models obtained for the discussion process
and investigate suggestions for low-quality discussions to high-
quality discussions.
A. Difference between models in the early stage
First, we discuss the common points between high-quality
and low-quality discussion groups in the early stage, referring
to Figs. 2 and 3. Both models had the same loop of Question T
↔ Answer S that illustrated a repetition of questioning by
supervisors and answering by students. The loop could be
interpreted as a process by which supervisors tried to make
students understand their thesis and progress (we name it the
Question loop). Moreover, both models had the same loop of
Suggestion T ↔ Agreement S that illustrated a repetition of
suggestions by supervisors and agreements by students. The
loop could be interpreted as a process by which supervisors
tried to make their students agree on the objectives of their
thesis (we name it the Suggestion loop).
The different points between the high-quality and low-
quality discussion groups in the early stage were also found.
The model for the high-quality discussion group had a loop
of Opinion T ↔ Agreement S that represented a repetition of
supervisors giving opinions and students agreeing. The loop
could be interpreted as a process by which both supervisors
and students discussed their thesis (we name it the Discussion
loop).
The model for the high-quality discussion group had other
signiﬁcant transitions; Answering S → Understanding T that
represented supervisors’ understandings of students’ answers
and Conﬁrmation T → Agreement S that illustrated students’
agreements on supervisor’s conﬁrmations. The signiﬁcant tran-
sitions indicated that both supervisors and students in high-
quality discussion group could have constructive discussions
based on students’ understandings.
Meanwhile, the model for the low-quality discussion group
had different transitions: Answer S → Suggestion T that
represented supervisors’ suggestions complying with students’
progress, Understanding S → Opinion T that represented
supervisors giving opinions for the students’ understandings,
and Question S → Answer T that represented supervisors’
answering students’ questions. Those transitions indicated that
supervisors compensated for the lack of students’ understand-
ing.
B. Difference between models in the late stage
First, we discuss the common points between the high-
quality and low-quality discussion groups in the late stage,
referring to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. Both models had Discussion
loops that were included only in the model for the high-
quality discussion group in the early stage. The partial change
indicated that both supervisors and students in the late stage
came to discuss their thesis to some extent.
However, the model for the low-quality discussion group
kept in three transitions Answering S → Suggestion T,
Agreement S → Explanation T, and Explanation T → Under-
stading S that were included in the model for the low-quality
discussion group in the early stage. The remaining of the
three transitions indicated that the students in the low-quality
discussion group did not understand their thesis perfectly. The
model was added to with new transitions Answering S →
Conﬁrmation T and Answering S → Opinion T that repre-
sented supervisors giving conﬁrmations and opinions for stu-
dents’ answers. The two transitions indicated that supervisors
could not understand or satisfy with the students’ answers.
Moreover, a transition of Request T → Agreement S also
emerged that implied supervisors had trouble making their

students understand by explanation and moved to order them
speciﬁc tasks to ﬁnish their thesis.
Meanwhile, the model for the high-quality discussion group
had a new loop of Explanation T ↔ Understanding S that
represented students’ understandings of supervisors’ detailed
explanations (we name it the Explanation loop). The model
had another new loop of Conﬁrmation T ↔ Agreement S that
represented a repetition of students’ agreements for supervi-
sors’ conﬁrmations (we name it the Conﬁrmation loop). The
model for the high-quality discussion group comprised the four
loops of transitions. The four loops illustrated that supervisors
and students discussed their speciﬁc topics in depth. Since
more loops were found in the discussion process, we could
estimate that the discussions had various topics with deep
insights.
The model for the high-quality discussion group did not
include a Question loop that was in the model for the high-
quality discussion group in the early stage, because a transition
of Answer S → Question T was disappeared, which meant
that students started to answer supervisors’ questions appro-
priately; therefore, it was not necessary to repeat questions.
One more newly added transition was Report S → Under-
standing T that represented students reporting their progress
and supervisors understanding them. The transitions indicated
that students came to understand and conduct their thesis
appropriately.
C. Suggestions for low-quality discussions to high-quality
discussions
The above ﬁndings were summarized as suggestions for
low-quality discussions to high-quality discussions. The dis-
cussants should drive their discussions to include the following
transitions.
1) Supervisors conduct discussions so that students can
understand their thesis. The suggestion is realized by
removing one-way transitions in Fig. 3 except the tran-
sition of Explanation T → Understanding S.
2) Supervisors lead students to agree on supervisors’ opin-
ions based on the students’ understanding. The sugges-
tion is realized by adding a Discussion loop.
3) Both supervisors and students have discussions to under-
stand each other’s opinions. The suggestion is realized
by conducting discussions that the ﬁve changes occur:
a) Students answer supervisors’ questions appropri-
ately based on their understandings. The suggestion
is realized by removing a Question loop.
b) Supervisors do not explain unilaterally. They
should check students’ understandings and explain
points one by one. The suggestion is realized by
adding an Explanation loop.
c) Supervisors do not conﬁrm unilaterally. They
should check students’ agreements and conﬁrm
them one by one. The suggestion is realized by
adding a Conﬁrmation loop.
d) Students should come to understand supervisors’
opinions. They should not agree on everything
without understanding.
e) Students should report their progress in a way that
can be understood by supervisors, which means
students must conduct their thesis based on their
understandings.
VI. CONCLUSION
This paper proposed a generation method for the discussion
process model during research progress. First, discussions
are recorded, then transcripts of them are made that have a
speaker name and an utterance in each line. The transcripts are
classiﬁed into high-quality and low-quality discussion groups.
After classiﬁcation, labels for dialog acts are assigned to each
utterance. The labels for dialog acts are originally designed for
discussion analysis for research progress. Frequently appearing
transitions of dialog acts are extracted in each group. By
connecting dialog acts that are common in two transitions, a
network of dialog acts is generated. The network illustrates
a model for the discussion process. The models for high-
quality and low-quality discussion groups are compared. The
differences between the two models should be the suggestions
for low-quality discussions to high-quality discussions.
We experimented with the proposed method using eight
discussions in the early stage of the thesis and another eight
discussions in the late stage. We made two main hypotheses:
if the quality of discussion is different, the dialog acts and
the transitions in the models are also different (H1), and if
the stage of the thesis is different, the dialog acts and the
transitions in the models are also different (H2). We classiﬁed
the 16 discussions into four groups considering the quality
(high/low) and the stage (early/late), then generated models
for each group. By comparing the four models, we proved that
all hypotheses were valid. The experimental results veriﬁed
that the proposed method generated models corresponding
to the quality of discussion and the stage of the thesis.
We investigated the four models and found the suggestions
for low-quality discussions to high-quality discussions. The
suggestions were summarized in three points: (1) Supervisors
should conduct discussions so that students understand their
thesis. (2) Supervisors should lead students to agree on their
opinions based on the students’ understanding. (3) Both su-
pervisors and students have discussions to try to understand
each other’s opinions.
Future studies will endeavor to apply the ﬁndings to im-
prove discussions. It is assumed that the way of conducting
discussions depends on the research ﬁeld and experiences.
There might be limitations in the proposed method because
the discussions used were about information science and the
students were engaged in their ﬁrst piece of research. We will
make several improvements to the proposed method to cope
with the differences in the research ﬁeld and experiences.
