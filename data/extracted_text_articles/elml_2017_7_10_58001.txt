Abstract— One of the most important events of the last few 
years was the propagation of Massive Open Online Courses 
(MOOCs). Indeed, MOOCs have managed to help huge 
numbers of online users, especially in higher education sector, 
to attend free courses and get certificates. Open Educational 
Resources (OERs) can be used in different ways in the learning 
practices because the concept of openness and reusability of 
these resources encourages many stakeholders to use these 
resources in online and massive courses. The main challenge 
faced by many experiments in using OERs in MOOCs is how 
to enhance interaction between students and educational 
content. Thus, there is an urgent need to address this challenge 
by building and maintaining links between these kinds of 
courses and the provided OERs by other universities. The 
specific objective of this paper was to propose a model for 
using OERs through the current MOOCs. Data for this study 
were collected by reviewing previous related work and models 
to present this model in three main Phases: Pre-using OERs, 
Using OERs, and sustaining of OERs. Every Phase includes 
attributes and components. This proposed model can be 
implemented when designers and developers of MOOCs intend 
to invest different open educational resources in engaging 
participants and exchange best learning practices.

Educational Resources; OERs; Model. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, there has been renewed interest in the 
development and use of Open Education Resources (OER) 
and their potential in expanding access to higher education 
and improving the quality of course contents, particularly in 
the education domain, where there is a wide range of quality 
materials [1]. From official education materials such as the 
ones available in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC), 
Higher Education domain is becoming critical to recognize 
that relationship between OERs and MOOCs [1]. 
In the light of elevating the meaning of educational 
resources, "OERs can be described as the five Rs of 
openness [2]: 
• Retain—the right to make, own, and control copies of 
the content. 
• Reuse—the right to use the content in a wide range of 
ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, and 
in a video). 
• Revise—the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the 
content (e.g., translate the content into another language) 
• Remix—the right to combine the original or revised 
content with other open content to create something new 
(e.g., incorporate the content into a “mashup”). 
• Redistribute—the right to share copies of the original 
content, revisions, or remixes with others (e.g., give a 
copy of the content to a friend)." 
OERs  "typically refer to electronic resources, and such 
materials are generally released under a Creative Commons 
or similar license that, can originate from colleges and 
universities, libraries, archival organizations, government 
agencies, commercial organizations or other individuals 
who develop educational resources they are willing to 
share" [3]. 
Despite the long history of OERs and its occupation high 
agenda of social and inclusion policies and supported by 
many stakeholders in education, their use has not yet reached 
a critical threshold, basically, the current concern on OER is 
on building more access to digital content [4].  
MOOCs are free of charge courses for a massive number 
of learners on the web; it must be considered that course 
design and the way of presenting course materials, and 
interactivity trough social networks and study groups [5]. 
Learners must be self-organizer to participate in mutual 
interest subjects with other learners; massive courses have 
weekly timetable, no special prerequisites should be 
provided, no formal certification will be awarded [6].  
In the context of OERs and MOOCs, for example, the 
course about Open Educational Resources (COER13) has 
been completely downloaded and re-uploaded to iMooX, 
The course was republished with some new videos and 
interviews for more than 500 users, so reusing and remixing 
allows for the reoffering of courses without additional costs 
[7]. Moreover, extensive research has shown that a cost 
efficient way and introduced OER at the Medical University 
of Graz which can be applied also to other institutions so the 
following steps are performed: (1) Identify the need, (2)

Identification of content which may be suitable also for 
general public, (3) Rights clearance, (4) Set-up of 
distribution channels [8]. 
MOOCs that implement OER practices implement the 
ethical dimension of e-learning much more successfully 
than MOOCs that might just offer free access to a MOOC at 
a given time or use proprietary resources that cannot be 
reused [9]; for example, in xMOOCs the course materials 
are provided during the course time, in some cases cannot 
be reused [9]. 
Ghislandi sees that "the main problem is how to 
implement Openness for achieving best learning results, 
provided that the OER and MOOC evaluation is still a fluid 
topic" [10]. The course materials in the majority of MOOCs 
are not designed to fit the concept of the OER movement, 
and protected under copyright regulations which do not 
allow adaptation or translation; therefore, the content con 
not be reused; since they are nonmodifiable, nonremixable, 
nonshareable [11][12]. 
Atenas recommended that "the fairest way to allow and 
encourage the use of resources from MOOCs is by 
removing copyright barriers, adding creative commons 
licenses to course materials and by using the General Public 
License (GNU) in the case of open codes used for modeling 
the contents or courses" [12]. This way may enforce sharing 
and reusing resources but it needs more awareness with 
related issues like ethical issues and quality assurance. 
This research attempts to make explicit a systematic 
relationship between MOOCs and Open Educational 
Resources through proposing a model for using and 
implementing OERs in MOOCs. The rest of this research is 
organized as follows: Section II. OER vs. MOOC; Section 
III. Quality Approach; Section IV. Provide details of the 
proposed model for using OERs in MOOCs. Section V. 
Presents the findings of the research, focusing on the three 
key themes that connect using OERs in MOOCs; Section VI 
Taken together, these findings and highlighted new research 
tracks. 
II. 
OER VS. MOOC 
This section reviews and compares the main themes 
between OER and MOOCs [10]:  
• 
"OER is a resource, and sometimes a course. 
MOOCs are courses including assessment, credits 
system, students support, curriculum, etc. 
• 
OER is typically delivered on demand while 
MOOCs have a defined beginning and end. 
• 
OER can be used by a single person while MOOCs 
are addressed to a massive cohort, during a given 
period. 
• 
OER is for every school level while MOOCs are 
mainly dedicated to Higher Education and the Life 
Long Learning postgraduate or nonformal". 
The term of "open" in MOOC refers to "open 
admissions" or the removal of any academic barriers to 
participation in a course or program[13]. While the term of 
"open" in OER entails, "it seems, at a minimum, no cost to 
the consumer or user of the resource" [14]. 
Although differences between OER and MOOCs are 
mentioned, it can be noted that approaches consider 
MOOCs as open resources. OER used for teaching, 
assessment, research purpose so it is supposed using and 
implementing these resources to formulate and construct 
massive courses.  
III. 
QUALITY APPROACH 
Developing and using OERs makes improvement in the 
quality of education when the teachers and students use the 
educational resources without barriers like copyright and 
paying barriers [15]. Moreover, OERs and MOOCs provide 
different opportunities for achieving quality in higher 
education through implementing strategic management 
approach [16]. 
The quality of instructional design of a massive course is 
a critical indicator and prerequisite of the potential of the 
course for effective learning.  
There are quality standards and rubrics have focused 
significantly on the quality of OERs and MOOCs. 
Camilleri, Ehlers, Pawlowski figured out that "quality 
assurance requires pedagogical enhancement, pedagogical 
stakeholders, and pedagogical resources" [4]. Furthermore, 
open standards for quality assurance of OER and MOOC 
would assist in measuring quality in more globally accepted 
terms [11]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As shown in Figure 1. "accessibility, flexibility, 
interactivity, personalization, transparency, open and shared 
content, use of media, pedagogical enhancement, reflection, 
and social learning are the key indicators of high quality in 
the use of OERs and MOOCs" [16]. 
IV. 
PROPOSED MODEL FOR USING OERS IN MOOCS 
This section presents the proposed model for using OERs 
in MOOCs. This model has formed through reviewing 
previous works and models in this domain like: 
Figure 1. Quality indicators for OERs and MOOCs.

potential model to guide the development of OER in public 
health and help an academic for producing and publishing 
OER  through a matrix of questions and answers, according 
to various risks and benefits to them and their institution 
[17]. Another framework based on 
semantic 
web 
technologies to improve discovery, accessibility, visibility, 
and to promote reuse of open educational content in the 
massive course [18]. Moreover, Atenas' study proposed 
model for democratisation of the contents hosted in MOOCs 
through three strategies to open up MOOC contents 
includes: "deposit the materials in repositories of OER 
(ROER) as individual objects, to archive them in ROER in 
data packages as learning units or to convert them into Open 
Courseware 
(OCW) 
as 
self-taught 
courses" 
[12]. 
Furthermore, Shu-Hsiang, Jaitip, and Ana developed "a 
strategic planning process (SPP) model based on the 
concept of open educational resources, university social 
responsibility (USR), social entrepreneurship (SE), and 
strategic planning (SP), so the proposed SPP model will 
serve as a guide for mapping out a strategic plan and 
activities for aligning and implementing OER, which can tie 
strategic planning to a university’s effectiveness and success 
in sustainability for the long term" [19]. 
It can be noted that the proposed model in this research 
has included three Phases as the following:  
A. Phase 1: Pre-Using OERs 
B. Phase 2: Using OERs 
C. Phase 3: Sustaining of OERs 
 
As shown in Figure 2. Proposed model contains three 
main phases for using OER in MOOCs.  
A. Phase 1: Pre-Using OERs: 
This Phase includes finding OERs through searching on 
the web by search engines to collect and download these 
resources in different formats. Also, MOOCs provider can 
provide other resources from previous educational softwares 
that produced before, repositories, open coursewares, and 
online courses. After collecting resources they can archive 
its. 
B. Phase 2: Using OERs: 
MOOCs platforms may provide a course in different 
subjects so MOOCs providers have to produce OERs if they 
found that the resources in phase (1) need to modify for 
serving the educational objectives or even producing OERs 
by authoring tools. Web 2.0 has provided effective tools for 
creating OERs so it will encourage authoring and producing 
many resources as well. In all cases, Creative Common 
License can be used to keep intellectual property rights and 
empower the concept of openness and reuse. 
Repository in MOOC platform has great importance in 
this proposed model. It receives all of the resources either 
which are collected in the previous phase or produce in this 
phase. On the other hand, repository connects producing 
process 
with 
using 
process 
and 
encourages 
users' 
contributions by uploading their own resources and 
downloading other ones or even embed them through using 
embed codes. These activities for users could translate to 
points so it can be shown in their profile to reinforce sharing 
OERs.

MOOCs providers and Users can evaluate OERs in 
repository in the light of quality standards. Repository 
supervisors can review new resources, update some of them, 
add comments. Registered users in MOOCs preview courses 
and resources for free. 
C. Phase 3: Sustaining OERs: 
In this phase, MOOCs providers have to come up with in 
the ways of supporting OERs, reusing, and sustaining. This 
may happen by creative commons license that helps users of 
MOOCs to reuse and share OERs which have been used in 
MOOCs. Furthermore, OERs will be available after studying 
courses on the web for reusing in other courses, republishing 
in another contexts through Learning management systems, 
Open course wares, learning objects repository, educational 
Softwares. 
V. 
RELATED ISSUES FOR CONNECTING AND USING OERS 
IN MOOCS 
The following part presents the findings of the research, 
focusing on the related issues that connect using OERs in 
MOOCs as it shows in Figure 3. 
 
 
Learning communities: support developing OERs 
that mainly used in MOOCs. being OERs in a social 
context that leads to developing and update content 
over time [20].  
 
Sustainability: it relates to financial issues and 
paying for getting certificates may be a good 
solution to keep sustaining OERs besides thinking of 
emerging business models.   
 
Quality 
Assurance: 
it 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
consideration for quality of MOOCs and OERs if we 
need to raise learning quality and learning outcomes. 
 
Legal Issues: and raising awareness about types of 
Licenses 
and 
consequences 
of 
using 
illegal 
resources. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Trust and Reputation: if MOOCs providers need to 
gain a high reputation for courses, they have to give 
more concerns with the trust of OERs and search for 
good methods to keep the trust of users. 
 
Interoperability: that means designing OERs to be 
compatible with different MOOCs platforms, 
learning environments and standards. 
 
Instructional Design: It is a basic component of the 
overall quality and pedagogic effectiveness of 
learning practices [21]. Instructional Designer must 
implement models for developing massive courses 
and create educational resources in a systematic way 
upon educational approach.  
 
OER Distribution: after studying massive course and 
a possibility of reusing OERs in another course. 
 
Creative OER: crating educational resources is very 
important but not enough to keep using. Achieving a 
high level of learning objectives requires creative 
resources in their content, activity, assessment of 
these resources. The more producing creative OERs, 
the more using OERs. 
 
Ethical Issues: have a relationship with legal issues 
and the degree of awareness about authors 
copyrights; either OERs used for educational 
purpose or research purpose. 
 
MOOC and OER Models: designing and developing 
models in the field of MOOCs and OERs contributes 
in an effective way to discuss the main attributes 
which have main importance for encouraging 
implementing OERs in MOOCs.   
 
Learning Analytics: will help in recognizing to 
which extent stakeholders used OERs in massive 
courses. It leads to design and renews strategies for 
efficient use.  
 
Technical Issues: in the light of quality standards of 
both of OERs and MOOCs.

 
Participation and Sharing: for maximizing benefits 
from OERs and providing tools in MOOCs platform 
to share, publish, and upload resources by users. 
 
Language: it may cause troubles especially to non- 
English speaker countries, so there is a need to find 
the best ways to use OERs in other languages.

Accessibility: 
and 
providing 
resources 
for

accessibility standards to be compatible to fit their 
needs.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In general, therefore, it seems that MOOCs and OERs 
concepts include common features such as openness and 
serving educational purposes. Although the expansion of 
creating and sharing OERs on the web, there are researches 
study strategies and recommendations in the context of 
implementing OERs and MOOCs for achieving best 
educational 
practices. 
This 
research 
has 
addressed 
connecting between OERs and MOOCs through proposing a 
model for using OERs in MOOCs which included three 
phases: Pre-Using OERs, Using OERs, and Sustaining 
OERs. Every phase contained attributions started from 
finding OERs passing to preparing, and conserving these 
resources through the repository and distributing its. There 
are important factors to encourage users to share educational 
resources like providing repository in MOOCs platform 
with a point system, and allow them to evaluate resources 
with repository's evaluator. Sustaining OERs could be done 
by paying for getting a certificate to support costs of 
producing OERs. Last but not least, research has presented 
the finding focusing on the related issues for connecting 
open educational resources and massive open online 
courses: Learning communities, Sustainability, Quality 
Assurance, 
Legal 
Issues, 
Trust 
and 
Reputation, 
Interoperability, Instructional Design, OER Distribution, 
Creative OER, Ethical Issues, MOOC and OER Models, 
Learning Analytics, Technical Issues, Participation and 
Sharing, Language, Accessibility. Considering the findings 
of this research may direct future research, it would be 
desirable to develop a prototype of the proposed model. 
Further into the future, Studying related factors of using 
OERs when applying the proposed model will encourage 
using OERs in the massive courses. Furthermore, studying 
the criteria of using OERs in MOOCs, and applying 
qualitative research for studying the rates of using OERs in 
MOOCs could be important research directions in the 
future.
