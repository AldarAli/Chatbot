Abstract—The quality of software is an area of software 
engineering, which aims to ensure a satisfactory performance in 
the development of the final product through processes. With the 
need for better structured processes, models were instituted to 
steer organizations in their processes, however the adopted 
models may differ from company to company, in some cases 
companies become partners, or are suppliers of other, or no 
merger of companies, so it is important to understand the 
relationship between the models. This paper presents the 
intersection of MPS.BR (Melhoria de Processo do Software 
Brasileiro- Brazilian Software Process Improvement) and 
Automotive SPICE 
(Software 
Process Improvement 
and 
Capability dEtermination), in addition it relates the processes of 
a company that adheres to the Brazilian quality model, with 
automotive reference model. This paper provides a solution for 
two companies, with different reference models, to work together.  
Keywords- Automotive SPICE; MPS.BR; Software Quality. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
With the software market on the rise, it was necessary that 
fashion models processes were established to provide products 
with higher quality. Today there are various types of process 
models and a company must analyze and choose a model that 
will help it increase the quality of its products through changes 
in their processes. 
 Process models are not just about the certifications. Their 
benefits go far beyond that, the institution of international 
production standards allows higher visibility and gains   
improving productivity of the company, as it reduces the time 
and investment used in the projects. However it is important to 
take note that these results come only upon the maturity of the 
new companies with the established processes. 
Many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the 
automotive sector has factories in several countries in the 
world, and many of them have adopted the Automotive SPICE 
for the development of their products. These industries can hire 
local suppliers to help them, but need to keep the same 
instituted quality standards. 
 In Brazil there is a reference model called MPS.BR. The 
MPS.BR has seven maturity levels [1]. This model is adopted 
mainly by small and medium enterprises, and these are even 
beginning to institutionalize quality processes, and usually are 
lower maturity levels G, F and E. The company's case study 
was implementing the level and therefore this work was 
compared to the level E. 
This work will address two types of process quality models, 
namely the MPS.BR and Automotive SPICE, which is a branch 
of ISO / IEC 15504 (SPICE). The MPS.BR is a Brazilian 
model which has as its main objective, the process 
improvement, being aimed primarily at small and medium-
sized businesses. SPICE is an international model itself and its 
main differential is the focus on improving the design process, 
not the company as a whole. Many automotive companies use 
SPICE and a specific aspect of this model was created for these 
companies, called SPICE Automotive [2]. 
Given this scenario, the objective is to carry out a study of 
the compatibility between models of software processes 
MPS.BR level E and Automotive SPICE acting as a facilitator 
for companies to see the potential in the Brazilian quality 
model, and to also show the potential of the Brazilian company 
to provide services to the automotive industry. 
In Section 2 Theoretical Foundations will introduce all the 
theoretical basis for understanding the work that will be 
presented. Section 3 the intersection of Automotive SPICE 
models with MPS.BR and the company will be addressed. 
Results of analysis are exposed in Section 4. In Section 5 will 
focus on the approached conclusion of all work. 
II. 
THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS 
Software quality is fundamental for both customers and 
suppliers, and process models, such as the MPS.BR and SPICE 
act as guides that assist in improving the software production 
processes, and thus a means of increasing the quality of the 
final product. 
With the increasing need for more elaborate software, 
quality becomes an essential item. Pressman defines software 
quality as conformance to functional requirements and 
performance 
that 
have 
been 
explicitly 
declared, 
the 
development patterns clearly documented, and the implicit 
features that are expected of all software developed by 
professionals [1]. According to Fuggetta, to guarantee the 
quality of a software standardization of procedures should be 
proposed, namely to establish processes that can be defined as 
a 
coherent 
set 
of 
policies, 
organizational 
structures, 
technologies, procedures and artifacts needed to devise, 
develop, deploy and maintain a software product [3].  
Due to the increasing demand for software with higher 
quality, there is a need for more efficient processes. Pressman 
defines processes as being the Foundation of software 
engineering allowing the rational and timely software 
development. He also claims that the software processes are the 
268

basis for the managerial control of software projects and 
establishes the content in which the technical methods are 
applied, the work products (documents, data models, reports, 
forms, etc.) are produced, the milestones are established, the 
quality is ensured and the modifications are properly managed   
[1]. Another definition of process is given by Wilson de Paula 
Filho, that describes a process as something that can be defined 
with more or less detail and that its stages may have a partial 
ordering, thus allowing the parallelism between them [4]. As an 
organization matures, its software processes become more 
defined and consistent across the organization as a whole [5]. 
The quality of software is related only to a quality of the 
product, not making connections the way it was produced, or if 
there is a process that assisted in the manufacture of the same. 
On the other hand, when one looks at the quality of a software 
process, we seek to identify the ability of a software process to 
produce a quality product [6]. 
However, it is important to notice that the mere existence of 
a software process does not guarantee that a quality product 
will be created. For the results to be achieved in a satisfactory 
manner, it is necessary that the processes are well defined and 
understood. The process adopted must be used in all projects of 
the Organization, being appropriate to the particular 
characteristics of each project [7].  
The software process model is an abstract representation of 
the architecture, design or definition of the software processes   
[8]. This work focuses on two models of software processes, 
the MPS.BR and Automotive SPICE. These models provide a 
set of core activities to obtain a software within what was 
proposed, however they do not specify a possible life cycle or 
how to put into practice such activities, so it is up to the 
Organization to model the processes within your reality[7][9]. 
Software process models are usually divided into maturity 
levels, which can be defined as specific or generic practices 
related to a pre-defined set of processes that improve the 
overall performance of an organization [10].  
From these definitions, it is possible to conclude that the 
software processes are fundamental in an organization and the 
implementation of the same provides benefits in various 
sectors, mainly in the quality of the developed software. 
However, the implementation of processes without well-
defined methods is usually a chore, this leads to process 
models, which provide a set of policies, organizational 
structures, procedures, among other elements that assist in this 
task. 
A. MPS.BR 
The Brazilian Software Process Improvement also called   
MPS.BR, is an evaluation model of software development 
companies developed by SOFTEX in 2003 [11], in partnership 
with the Brazilian federal government and the academic 
community. The Brazilian model is independent, but  
compatible with standards ISO 12207 and 15504, CMMI 
(North American model of process improvement) [12].  
The MPS.BR is of great importance for the Brazilian 
scenario, since 94% of Brazilian companies are considered 
small and medium businesses [13]. Therefore, for these 
organizations a certification of an international model becomes 
costly and often impractical. The Brazilian quality model 
provides an effective way to process definition and certification 
costs affordable to the local reality. The MPS.BR is divided 
into seven levels of maturity. The maturity levels are: A, B, C, 
D, E, F, G. Level A is the highest level of the reference model. 
Each level of maturity has processes or activities that must be 
performed. The processes contained until the level E are 
reported in the Table I. With each new level of maturity, 
process or improvement processes that have already been 
established in previous levels are added. One advantage of the 
Brazilian model being divided into several levels is the 
deployment of more gradual fashion model, favoring its 
adoption by small and medium-sized enterprises [14].

B. SPICE 
The SPICE or ISO/IEC 15504 was originally created as a 
supplement to the ISO/IEC 12207, and it aims to guide the 
assessment and self-evaluation of the ability of companies in 
the processes and from this evaluation the improvement of its 
processes is enabled [15]. This model of software quality 
establishes a framework which is used for both the creation of 
evaluation processes and the improvement of software 
processes [16]. 
The ISO/IEC 15504 is structured in two dimensions. The 
first is the dimension of processes in which the processes are 
evaluated. The second is the capacity dimension that 
determines the ability of the company to evaluate in each of 
these processes [15]. 
The company does not need to execute all processes; the 
organization can opt for a subset of processes that match their 
needs. Thus, in an assessment, the processes can have different 
levels [17]. 
The five major categories within the dimension of SPICE 
processes are [15]: 
 
CUS: Customer/vendor relationship 
 
ENG: Engineering processes 
 
SUP: Support processes 
 
MAN: Management processes 
 
ORG: Organization processes 
The SPICE capacity dimension possesses 6 levels [16]: 
 
0- Incomplete 
 
1- Process performed 
 
2- Managed process 
 
3- Process established

C. Automotive SPICE 
Currently it is estimated that about 85% of the functionality 
of an automobile are controlled by software. Auto companies 
need these softwares more reliable thus avoiding future 
problems like Recalls. For this reason, from a consensus among 
the major automakers, the Automotive SPICE was created, 
aiming to assist in the production of automotive software and 
based on the ISO/IEC 15504 (SPICE) [18]. In addition to the 
procedures defined by ISO/IEC 15504, the Automotive SPICE 
defines alterations in the ISO processes and inserts other 
suitable processes and a focus on the needs of the automotive 
industry [19].  
The groups of processes that the Automotive SPICE treats 
and will be addressed in this paper are in Tables II-VIII. Each 
process contains process outcomes and base practices to assist 
in understanding and implementing processes.

D.  The company 
      The company which processes were studied is a small 
company located in the city of Londrina-PR, It works with 
firmware development, test and validation to automotive 
industry. With ten years of activity, this organization possesses 
certification MPS.BR-F and comes pleading the level E of the 
Brazilian model. In addition to these achievements, the 
company also has MoProSoft certification, a Mexican model 
of quality process [20].

LIST OF AUTOMOTIVE SPICE PROCESS WITH MPS.BR-E 
AND WITH PROCESS COMPANY 
In this section the relationship between the processes of 
Automotive SPICE with the MPS.BR level E it will be 
addressed, as well as the comparison with the already 
established processes within the studied company. The 
correlation between the two models of references was 
developed considering each Automotive SPICE process and 
checking the corresponding in MPS.BR. The same analysis 
was performed with the company's processes, but only if the 
company complied fully, partially or did not fulfill the 
requirements presented in the templates.  
This intersection was illustrated below through the 
Automotive SPICE’s PIM.3 process and its compatibility with 
the MPS.BR’s processes, and finally, the compatibility of the 
PIM.3 with the company’s processes.

PIM.3 - Process Improvement 
Process Purpose [18]: “The purpose of the Process 
improvement 
process 
is 
to 
continually 
improve 
the 
organization’s effectiveness and efficiency through the 
processes used and aligned with the business need.” 
Process Outcomes 
As a result of successful implementation of this process: 
1) commitment is established to provide resources to 
sustain improvement actions;  
2) issues arising from the organization's internal/external 
environment are identified as improvement opportunities and 
justified as reasons for change;  
3) analysis of the current status of the existing process is 
performed, focusing on those processes from which 
improvement stimuli arise;  
4) improvement goals are identified and prioritized, and 
consequent changes to the process are defined, planned and 
implemented;  
5) the effects of process implementation are monitored, 
measured and confirmed against the defined improvement 
goals;  
6) knowledge 
gained 
from 
the 
improvement 
is 
communicated within the organization; and  
7) the improvements made are evaluated and consideration 
given for using the solution elsewhere within the organisation. 
 
The compatibility of MPS.BR with each item listed above 
is  presented in the following: 
1) It is not addressed in MPS.BR level E; 
2) The identification of the organization's issues are 
treated in AMP1; 
3) The analysis of the current state is covered in AMP3; 
4) The identification of improvements and prioritization 
are treated in AMP5, already planning the implementation is 
contained in AMP6; 
5) The effect of improvement implemented is specified 
AMP6; 
6) It is treated with relevance in MPS.BR E; 
7) Evaluations and considerations are discussed in AMP9.  
 Compatibility with the Company: 
1) It is not implemented by the company; 
2) The company has a process called Definition and Process 
Improvement, in which executes this request. 
3) The company has a process called Definition and Process 
Improvement, in which executes this request. 
4) The company has a process called Definition and Process 
Improvement, in which executes this request. 
5) The company has a process called Definition and Process 
Improvement, in which executes this request. 
6) The company has a process called Definition and Process 
Improvement, in which executes this request. 
7) It is not implemented by the company; 
 
All processes of the Automotive SPICE were related in 
this same manner in Leite [21], as with MPS.BR  as with the 
company. 
       These processes are summarized in the Tables IX-XV and 
were created comparing the definitions employed by  
standards of the  Automotive SPICE [18] with the MPS.BR E 
defined by SOFTEX guides [11], and with the  processes of 
the organization. The Tables relate the processes of 
Automotive SPICE, the processes of the MPS.BR-E and if 
there are processes in the company, being that this relationship 
can be addressed in three ways: completely, partially or there 
may not be processes in MPS.BR-E used by the company that 
meets what is determined Automotive SPICE

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS 
With the basis of the information presented in the Tables IX 
to XV, one can extract some considerations. In Figure 1, the 
result of the compatibility between the processes of the 
MPS.BR are exposed and adopted by the Organization in 
relation to the Automotive SPICE.  
 
Figure 1. Processes Compability Results 
 
These results show that the Brazilian quality model in the 
level E was not as compatible with the automotive model. 
However, it is noticed that the existing processes within the 
company have a more significant compatibility. 
The above report exposes a remarkable fact, the 
organization, which should theoretically have a similar result 
with the quality of Brazilian model, because it has implemented 
the level E, got more processes completely addressed in 
relation to the Automotive SPICE, it shows that even with the 
certification of a quality model, the company has to fit and 
supply what is needed and what is not exposed in the 
implementation of a quality model guides 
The factor that may have influenced the company to greater 
compatibility with the SPICE is in fact the organization 
provides services to the automotive industry for almost 10 
years constantly, dealing with the high level of requirements of 
certain customers. In addition, the company also has another 
certification of quality model that is the MoProSoft. 
Another analysis that can be extracted from this 
compatibility is that the level E from MPS.BR has 11 
processes, of which 8 were used at the intersection with the 
Automotive SPICE.  Based on this opinion, it can be concluded 
that the majority of Brazilian model processes have been 
addressed, so the level E from MPS.BR discussed in this work 
brings a few contributions when compared to automotive 
model. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper showed that quality is an important element 
when it comes to software and processes tend to bolster its 
development, granting in this way an accuracy and 
standardization by assigning a higher quality to the final 
product. Software process models provide guidance and 
precepts that assist in the preparation and even implementing 
processes. 
With the analysis of the intersection between models and 
company, it can be concluded that among the Automotive 
SPICE and the MPS.BR-E the compatibility was little 
expressive, when looking at the number of processes that were 
addressed in the Brazilian model, it was concluded that the 
level covered in this work is insufficient on automotive model 
processes. Probably there will be greater compatibility when 
compared with the higher maturity levels the MPS.BR. 
The organization compatibility was more significant.

quality model, providing services for the automotive area are 
some of the factors that influence the company's processes, it 
resulted in a more complete processes and therefore in greater 
compatibility.  
Through the analysis a question arises. Should the company 
change its processes to meet the Automotive SPICE? As it was 
exposed, the necessary changes to an organization that adopts 
the MPS.BR-E would be rough, the company must analyze its 
services, if the majority of its projects do not have the focus to 
the automotive sector, the organization may choose to sell this 
differential when needed, not changing its processes. 
The big companies, or international certifications, will not 
always be found in environments where industries are located, 
so how to seek suppliers? It is concluded that suppliers with 
certifications will be better able to provide services than those 
without, as well as to assimilate/attend processes arising from 
the contractor. 
With the compatibility of quality models and the company 
made throughout this work, it obtained a document that could 
assist other organizations that might adopt the MPS.BR, and 
become a facilitator so that a company can see its potential in 
front of a model of international quality and provide services to 
the automotive sector. Another factor that it is necessary to 
emphasize, is that a company with this intersection relationship  
has the possibility to analyze the processes that are not 
addressed by the Brazilian model and adapt to the automotive 
model without necessarily aiming at a certification, and thus a 
differential in the market. Thus, it was concluded that the work 
reached the objectives proposed, since it was held the 
intersections of Automotive SPICE process with the MPS.BR-
E and with the process of an organization.
