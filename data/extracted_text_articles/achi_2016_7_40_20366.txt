Abstract—This work-in-progress article aims to identify and
overcome procedural challenges that impede creation of
universally designed content for the Norwegian Broadcasting
Corporation’s website. Universal design refers to the design of
Web content for use by the widest possible population. This
article presents initial results gathered from current policies,
work practices and employee experiences. Preliminary results
show that editorial employees are unfamiliar with internal and
external guidelines regarding universal design of Web content,
in
addition
to
believing
that
they,
as
editors,
are
not
responsible to ensure universally designed Web content. The
lack of internal guidelines regarding universal design of Web
content, and the employees’ lack of knowledge about these,
may act as a barrier to ensuring universal design in practice.

INTRODUCTION
This article investigates current practices and workflows
regarding universal design of Web content and explores
editorial
employee’s
experiences
at
the
Norwegian
Broadcasting Corporation. Universal design refers to the
design of Web content for use by the widest possible
population. The research will identify organizational issues
through investigating the editorial employees’ workflow,
experience and concerns regarding universal design when
creating Web content. The goal of the research is to
contribute to extend the findings of [9] and [17]. This article
asks, “How do editorial employees utilize current processes
and practices regarding universal design, and how can the
Norwegian
Broadcast
Corporation’s
(NRK)
publication
systems help editorial employees to create universally
designed content?” The result of the research will provide
recommendations
for
ensuring
universal
design
in
organizational processes, policies and workflows.
The areas of protocols, metadata standards, individual
work practices and the development and use of stable and
reliable workflows are not exhaustively researched and
remain somewhat unanswered. Research has not yet fully
examined practices and workflows regarding accessibility
[13]. In addition to this, research has yet to investigate how
the editorial employees experience the content management
system, and how the editorial employees take universal
design into consideration when creating content for the Web.
The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) is a
non-commercial,
government-owned
broadcasting
organization that provides TV, radio and Internet content to
the population of Norway. NRK is the largest media
organization in Norway with approximately 3500 employees,
distributed across fourteen district offices. NRK is authorized
to engage in broadcasting activities under the Broadcasting
Act [11]. The Statutes for the Norwegian Broadcasting
Corporation [19] provides the purpose, activities, limits and
structure of NRK. Chapter two outlines NRK’s social
mission [15]. Most notably, that
•
NRK should support and strengthen democracy [19]
(§12);
•
NRK should provide sufficient information so that
the public can actively participate in democratic
processes [19] (§12a.);
•
NRK should be accessible to the public [19] (§13);
and that
•
NRK’s services should
take into
consideration
people with disabilities [19] (§13c.).
All these statements can be interpreted to underline the
importance of universal design of NRK’s products, in this
case Web content on NRK’s website.
NRK’s website is one of Norway’s most visited websites
[1] and is required to comply with the national regulations
[8] (§4) concerning accessibility and universal design of
websites and website content. The national regulations refer
to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0
[20] as a measurement of compliance. Researchers argue that
these guidelines may not produce accessible Web content
[16].
Section 2 presents previous work on the subject in
addition to acting as a frame for the research. Section 3 states
the current problem and the research’s importance. Section 4
describes what methods will be used in the research, and
why the methods have been chosen. Section 5 presents the
preliminary results from current research. Section 6 presents
a conclusion that can be drawn from the results and discusses
future work that exceeds the scope of this research. Finally,
Section 7 describes the next steps and plans for the future of
this research.

PREVIOUS WORK
Researchers argue that there are other factors besides
technical properties and usability metrics involved making
the Internet accessible, e.g., political, economical and social
aspects [2], and states that people, both users and workers,
and processes during development or creation of a product
should play a larger role in Web accessibility [6]. The
research of [6] suggests the British Standard BS8878 [3] as
accessibility guidelines that focuses on processes and
business.
III.
STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
NRK’s website must adhere to the NRK policy [19], the
Broadcasting
Act
and
national
regulations
regarding
universal design of ICT [8]. Norway has ratified the United
Nations
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
Persons
with
Disabilities [18], which in Article 9 obligates the Norwegian
government
to
ensure
access
to
information
and
communications technology for people with disabilities.
The
employees
at
NRK
create
digital
print
and
multimedia content daily. The editorial employees are
continuously revising news articles and pages on NRK’s
website, which makes content subject to constant change
according to different work practices. In addition to this, the
employees work in a fast-paced and dynamic environment.
The editorial employees are likely to work on multiple tasks
at once, and the cognitive effort of ensuring accessible
content may not always be considered a priority for the
editorial employees [12].
Content on NRK’s website is created through the content
management
system
Polopoly
and
rendering
system
Panorama
as
seen
in
Fig.
1.
Most
of
Polopoly’s
functionality is developed in-house at NRK. Polopoly stores
both textual content and metadata, over which the editorial
employees have control. Polopoly renders Web pages based
on text content and metadata. The editorial employees do not
control the rendering process.
However, these systems do not ensure universally designed
Web content for the end-user: Polopoly does not inform
about or aid the authors with creating accessible and
universally
designed
content.
There
has
been
no
investigation of the rendering tool, Panorama, and research
suggests that it may have an impact on the accessibility of
the content that is rendered [9]. Plug-ins for e.g., spell-check
and multimedia management may play a part in the
rendering process, suggested in research by [7] and [14].
Research shows that NRK’s website does not comply
with international accessibility guidelines WCAG 2.0 [20],
their content management system does not comply with
industry guidelines [21], and that consumers experience
usability barriers with the Web content’s structure, layout
and design [17].
IV.
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
It is important to first understand what current practices,
policies and workflows the editorial employees base their
content creation on, so that the research can inform relevant
theory. After exploring and explaining the current state of
content creation at NRK, the research can further inform or
extend on theory to ultimately assist editorial employees
create universally designed content for nrk.no.
In order to explore and explain the current state with
sufficient depth, qualitative methods will be used for data
collection. Qualitative methods are in addition suitable for
informing theory. This stage of the research will focus on
how the editorial employees interpret their environment and
tasks related to content creation. Data will be collected
through
field
studies/on-site
observations
and
semi-
structured interviews with the editorial employees. This can
be identified as (participatory) action research, which is
suggested to be effective to bridge theory and practice, as
well as to consider and incorporate the editorial employees’
view [4]. Editorial employees will be sampled purposively
because it is only relevant to investigate the employees that
create content for NRK’s website.

Some themes from the interview guide are responsibility
and activities; interpretation of Polopoly as a Content
Management System (CMS); experiences with Polopoly as a
CMS; familiarity with Universal Design (UD); utilization of
UD (when creating content); the employee’s knowledge of
internal
or
external
accessibility
guidelines;
internal
processes at NRK; and plain language.
The field study has been performed with one participant.
One researcher sat at the participant’s desk for the duration
of a whole work day while observing the participant and co-
workers involved while taking notes. The participant was
free to comment or elaborate at any time.
A qualitative interview has been performed with one
participant. The interview was audio recorded, transcribed
and
analyzed
for
themes
from
the
interview
guide.
Information that came to attention, which was not a part of
the interview guide, created its own theme.
V.
PRELIMINARY RESULTS
A.
Technical Introduction of Polopoly
A technical introduction of Polopoly with the Technical
Team Leader for Development was conducted in order to
gain
domain
knowledge
and
to
better
understand
terminology and situations for the field studies and semi-
structured interviews. This introduction revealed that there
are numerous plug-ins connected to Polopoly, including
spell-check and media content management in addition to the
Panorama rendering engine.
B.
Field Study
One field study has been conducted. An editor was
observed for five hours while creating a news article in
Polypoly. Relevant points and observation was collected.
The editor also made some general comments throughout the
session.
The field study identified that the environment was
generally hectic, but communicative and team-friendly as the
employees often walked up to other employees for advice or
consultation on matters. However, on few occasions one
editor’s workflow was being interrupted while waiting for
proofreading from another colleague. This caused delays and
uncertainty on a matter that had to be handled quickly. In
addition to this, NRK’s intranet solution was not being used
as intended – or at all. This has not proven to be relevant at
this time, but intranets may promote internal communication
[5]
and
might
help
tackle
challenges
with
internal
communication.
Regarding
universal
design,
an
editor
expressed
uncertainty of what a good alternative text to an image
should be. The editor was familiar with the term, and entered
a description on all images in the CMS. At the same time, the
editor
expressed
that
“journalists
would
never
enter
additional text content to multimedia content when creating a
news article” [22], in addition to suggesting that descriptions
could be used as alternative text to images, automatically by
Polopoly.
Similar to a discovery in the technical introduction, there
were numerous plug-ins connected to Panorama that editors
frequently used. As mentioned earlier, these systems may
interfere with the universal design [7] of the content.
C.
Preliminary Interview
One semi-structured interview has been conducted. The
participant had no knowledge of internal NRK guidelines of
policies regarding universal design or accessibility other than
the NRK policy [19]. The participant also stated that
“information flow and inter-department workflow was often
time consuming and complicated” [22].
The qualitative interview revealed that the participant, an
editor, was familiar with universal design as a term.
However, it was explained exclusively as a requirement from
the law, i.e., national regulations [8]. In particular, the editor
did not know what WCAG 2.0 guidelines were or what the
national regulations regarding universal design of ICT
required [22]. Interestingly, the participant experienced
universal design of Web content as "somebody else's
problem" [22], referring to programmers as an example of
employees that were in charge of legal compliance with
universal design of content on NRK’s website. Researchers
argue that Web accessibility evaluation methods often
require technical expertise or knowledge, which can result in
unknowingness of when or how to use these evaluations
[10]. This may be the case for the participant, considering the
statement that other employees are responsible for universal
design compliance.
VI.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The preliminary results suggest that there are three main
barriers hindering the creation of universally designed
content on NRK’s website. These are social barriers,
organizational barriers, and
technology barriers. More
specifically, the lack of awareness about UD among the
editorial
employees,
organizational
communication
challenges, and the lack of policies on UD of Web content
may be opportunities for change to ensure a more accessible
website.
Future work may include studying similar organizations
in order to identify if differences in organizational structure
has an affect on how editorial employees publish content
online.
VII.
NEXT STEPS
A minimum of five editorial employees will participate
in the semi-structured interviews, and a minimum of two
field
studies/on-site
observations
will
be
conducted.
Polopoly’s plug-ins will be subject of evaluation regarding
how they affect the universal design of Internet content. Data
collection will be completed by the end of February 2016.
