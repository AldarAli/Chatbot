Abstract—Cyber physical systems operate and supervise 
physical, 
technical 
systems 
using 
information 
and 
communication technology, also called Operation Technology 
(OT). Cyber security solutions focus on the OT part, i.e., on the 
information and communication technology. The focus of cyber 
security is protection, detection, and respondence to cyber 
attacks. Cyber resilience aims at delivering an intended outcome 
despite attacks and adverse cyber events and even failures not 
directly related to attacks. Protecting the link between the 
control systems and the physical world, has been addressed only 
in some very specific cases, e.g., charging of electric vehicles.  
We propose a physical-world firewall that limits the impact on 
the physical world of a successful attack of automation systems, 
thereby enhancing the resilience of cyber-physical system 
against successful attacks against its OT systems.  
Keywords–cyber security; cyber resilience; system integrity; 
cyber physical systems; industrial automation and control system; 
Internet of Things. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The traditional focus of IT security relates to IT-based 
control equipment and data communication (Ethernet, IP). In 
addition to this, in OT systems also the field level has to be 
considered down to the interface between the control system 
and the physical world via sensors and actuators.  
Traditionally, IT security has been focusing on 
information security, protecting confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of data at rest and data in transit. In Cyber-
Physical Systems (CPS), major protection goals are 
availability, 
meaning 
that 
automation 
systems 
stay 
productive, and system integrity, ensuring that it is operating 
as intended. Typical application domains are factory 
automation, process automation, building automation, railway 
signaling systems, and energy management. Cyber security is 
covering phases protect, detect, and react: Protecting against 
threats, detecting when an attack has occurred, and recovering 
from attacks.  
We see resilience of cyber-physical systems as an 
important protection goal, limiting the effect of potential 
successful attacks on a cyber-physical system in the physical 
world. It can be rather seen as a strategy than a specific 
technology. Our objective is to increase the robustness with 
respect to intentional attacks, although resilience in general 
would consider also accidental failures. 
After giving an overview on cyber physical systems and 
on industrial cyber security in Sections II and III, a new 
approach on protecting the interface of a CPS between the 
cyber-world and the physical world is described in Section IV. 
It is a concept to increase the resilience of a CPS when being 
under attack. Aspects to evaluate the new approach are 
discussed in Section V. Section VI concludes the paper.

CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEMS 
A cyber-physical system, e.g., an industrial automation 
and control system, monitors and controls a technical system. 
Examples are process automation, machine control energy 
automation, and cloud robotics. Automation control 
equipment is connected with sensors (S) and actuators (A), 
connected directly with automation components, or via 
remote input/output modules. The technical process is 
controlled by measuring its current state using the sensors, and 
be determining the corresponding actuator signals to influence 
the technical process.

Figure 1 shows an example of an industrial automation and 
control system, comprising different control networks 
connected to a plant network and a cloud backend system. 
Separation of the network is typically used to realize distinct 
control networks with strict real-time requirements for the 
interaction between sensors and actuators of a production cell, 
or to enforce a specific security policy within a production 
cell. Such an industrial automation and control system is an 
example of a cyber-physical system.

Figure 2. Automation Component 
Figure 2 shows the typical structure of automation 
components. The functionality realized by an automation 
component is largely defined by the firmware/software and 
the configuration data stored in its flash memory. In practice, 
it has to be assumed that each software component may 
comprises vulnerabilities, independent of the effort spend to 
ensure high software quality. The impact of a vulnerability in 
automation equipment does not affect only data on the 
automation component, but the effect it has on the physical 
world.  
III. 
INDUSTRIAL CYBER SECURITY 
Protecting industrial automation control systems against 
intentional attacks is increasingly demanded by operators to 
ensure a reliable operation, and also by regulation. This 
section gives an overview on industrial security, and on the 
main relevant industrial security standard IEC 62443 [8] and 
integrity security requirements.   
A. Industrial CPS Security Requirements 
Industrial security is called also Operation Technology 
security (OT security), to distinguish it from general 
Information Technology (IT) security. Industrial systems have 
not only different security requirements compared to general 
IT systems, but come also with specific side conditions that 
prevent that security concepts established in the IT domain 
can be applied directly in an OT environment. For example, 
availability and integrity of an automation system often have 
a higher priority than confidentiality. As an example, high 
availability requirements, different organization processes 
(e.g., 
yearly 
maintenance 
windows), 
and 
required 
certifications may prevent the immediate installations of 
updates.

Figure 3. The CIA Pyramid [6] 
The three basic security requirements are confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability. They are also named “CIA” 
requirements. Figure 3 shows that in common IT systems, the 
priority is “CIA”. However, in automation systems or 
industrial IT, the priorities are commonly just the other way 
round: Availability has typically the highest priority, followed 
by integrity. Confidentiality is often no strong requirement for 
control communication, but may be needed to protect critical 
business know-how. Shown graphically, the CIA pyramid is 
inverted (turned upside down) in many automation systems.  
Specific requirements and side conditions of industrial 
automation 
systems 
like 
high 
availability, 
planned 
configuration (engineering info), long life cycles, unattended 
operation, real-time operation, and communication, as well as 
safety requirements have to be considered when designing a 
security solution. Depending on the considered industry 
(vertical), they may also be part of the critical infrastructure 
domain, for which security requirements are also imposed for 
instance by the European Network and Information Systems 
(NIS) directive [7] or country specific realizations of the 
directive. Further security requirements are provided by 
applying standards defining functional requirements, for 
instance defined in IEC 62443. The defined security 
requirements can be mapped to different automation domains, 
including energy automation, railway automation, building 
automation, process automation.  
Security measures to address these requirements range 
from security processes, personal and physical security, 
device security, network security, and application security. No 
single security technology alone is adequate, but a 
combination of security measures addressing prevention, 
detection, and reaction to incidents is required (“defense in 
depth”).  
B. Overview IEC 62443 Industrial Security Standard 
The international industrial security standard IEC 62443 
[8] is a security requirements framework defined by the 
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It addresses 
the need to design cybersecurity robustness and resilience into 
industrial automation and control systems, covering both 
organizational and technical aspects of security over the life 
cycle. It is applied successfully in different automation 
7

CYBER 2019 : The Fourth International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems

domains, including factory and process automation, railway 
automation, energy automation, and building automation. The 
standard specifies security for industrial automation and 
control systems (IACS) and covers both, organizational and 
technical aspects of security. Specifically addressed is the 
setup of a security organization and the definition of security 
processes as part of an information security management 
system (ISMS) based on already existing standards like ISO 
27002. Furthermore, technical security requirements are 
specified distinguishing different security levels for industrial 
automation and control systems, and also for the used 
components. The standard has been created to address the 
specific requirements of industrial automation and control 
systems. In the set of corresponding documents, security 
requirements are defined, which target the solution operator 
and the integrator but also the product manufacturer.  
Part 3-3 of IEC 62443 [10] defines seven foundational 
requirements group specific requirements of a certain 
category: 
− 
FR 1 Identification and authentication control 
− 
FR 2 Use control 
− 
FR 3 System integrity  
− 
FR 4 Data confidentiality  
− 
FR 5 Restricted data flow 
− 
FR 6 Timely response to events  
− 
FR 7 Resource availability 
For each of the foundational requirements there exist 
several concrete technical security requirements (SR) and 
requirement enhancements (RE) to address a specific security 
level. In the context of communication security, these security 
levels are specifically interesting for the conduits connecting 
different zones.  
Four Security Levels (SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4) are defined 
that correlate with the strength of a potential attacker as shown 
in Figure 4. The targeted security level of a zone of the 
industrial automation and control system is determined based 
on the identified risk.  
 
 
Figure 4. IEC 62443 defined Security Level [6] 
 
To reach a dedicated security level, the System 
Requirements (SR) and potential Requirement Enhancements 
(RE) defined for that security level have to be fulfilled. The 
standard foresees that a security requirement can be addressed 
either directly, or by a compensating countermeasure. The 
concept of compensating countermeasures allows to reach a 
certain security level even if some requirements cannot be 
implemented directly, e.g., as some components do not 
support the required technical features. This approach is in 
particular important for existing industrial automation and 
control systems, so called “brown-field installations”, as 
existing equipment can be continued to be used.  
C. Resilience 
Being resilient means to be able to withstand or recover 
quickly from difficult conditions [1]. It shifts the focus of 
“classical” IT/OT security, that puts the focus on preventing, 
detecting, and reacting on cyber-security attacks, to the aspect 
to continue to deliver an intended outcome despite an adverse 
cyber attack is taking place. More specifically, resilience of a 
system is the property to be resistant to a range of threats and 
withstand the effects of a partial loss of capability, and to 
recover and resume its provision of service with the minimum 
reasonable loss of performance [2]. It has been addressed in 
telecommunications, ensuring that subscribers can continue to 
be served even when one line is out of service. Bodeau and 
Graubart [5] define resilience guidelines for providers of 
critical national telecommunications infrastructure in the UK.  
In a cyber-physical environment, a main objective is to 
ensure that the CPS stays operational and that its integrity is 
ensured. In the context of an industrial automation and control 
system, that means in particular that (only) intended actions in 
the physical world continue to take place even when the 
automation and control system of the CPS should be attacked.   
IV. 
PROTECTING THE CPS PHYSICAL WORLD INTERFACE 
Well-known IT security technologies like encryption and 
access control, protecting data at rest, in transit, and partly 
even data in use. In cyber-physical systems, this is not enough. 
Also, the interface between the OT part (automation systems) 
and the physical world has to be protected, limiting the 
potential danger that an automation system can have on the 
physical world when it is attacked. A successful attack on the 
automation system or control network can have an impact on 
the physical world [3].  
This section describes the concept of a “physical world 
firewall” that limits the access to the physical world from OT 
automation systems. The objective is to increase the resilience 
of cyber-physical systems, by limiting the impact of an 
attacked automation system on the physical world.  
A. Physical-World Firewall 
The main idea is to filter the communication between 
sensors and actuators on one side, and the control equipment 
on the other side. This can be called physical-world firewall. 
It limits in which way a control system, which might be under 
attack, can impact a physical system in the real world. The 
filtering takes place directly at the input/output interface, so 
8

CYBER 2019 : The Fourth International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems

that it is independent from the software-based functionality of 
the automation component.  
Similar as a communication firewall for data traffic that 
analyzes and filters data packets (IP packets and IP-based 
communication), here the actuator and sensor signals are 
filtered. The allowed signal ranges and dynamic parameters 
are monitored and limited.  
If the signal filtering policy is violated, the signal cannot 
be simply dropped like an IP packet. Instead, a replacement 
signal is provided. The replacement signal may be a fixed 
default value, or a clipped maximum/minimum value that is 
within the allowed value range, or it may be an out-of-range 
signal that will be detected by an actuator as failure signal).

Figure 5. Automation Component with Integrated Physical World Firewall 
Figure 5 shows an automation component with an 
integrated Cyber Physical Controlled IO Interface (CPC IO). 
The CPU can authenticate towards its CPC IO after a 
successful self-integrity check. Each input/output channel is 
monitored separately by the “Value Check” component: It 
verifies whether the sensor input value or the actuator output 
value is in the given allowed corridor and thus is compliant 
with the policy Pol. Besides value range, also statistical 
parameters and dynamic parameters can be checked. If the 
policy is met, the value is allowed, otherwise, the configured 
default value (DV) of provided to ensure the system stays 
operational. It is possible to lock the input/output interface in 
the case of a policy violation. The lock may be permanent, or 
it can be reset at a reboot of by manual user interaction.

Figure 6. Automation Component with Integrated Physical World Firewall 
A different variant is shown in Figure 6, where the signals 
of multiple input/output channels are checked in combination. 
This allows to perform cross-checks between sensor and 
actuator signals. Moreover, if this approach is applied in a 
distributed system, it allows to take certain properties of 
potentially 
different 
sensors/actuators 
into 
account. 
Specifically, if the sensors/actuators used are a mixture of 
standard (legacy) and specifically hardened, trusted sensors, a 
potential security assertion can be used in the evaluation of the 
signals giving the trusted sensor a higher weight in the 
evaluation. This is especially advantageous if a larger number 
of legacy sensors/actuators is already deployed and secure 
siblings are installed as add-on in a stepwise manner. More 
information on the basic concept of trusted sensors is 
described in [6]. 
B. Dynamic Resilience Management 
The policy of the physical-world firewall can be adapted 
dynamically, depending on the current operating state of the 
CPS. This allows to restrict the possibility to influence the 
physical world even more strictly, as the current state of the 
production system and the currently performed production 
step, e.g., cooling or filtering a fluid, can be reflected in the 
current configuration of the physical-world firewalls.

Figure 7. Dynamic Resilience Management 
Resilience managers determine the physical-world 
firewall policy dynamically, depending on the current state 
and context of the CPS, see Figure 7. They adapt during 
operation the current policy configuration of the physical-
world firewalls.  
The policy adaptation performed by resilience managers 
can use in particular the following information: 
− 
The current state of the physical world, as obtained by 
trusted sensor nodes [6].  
− 
The current production batch, the current production 
step, operating state (e.g., standby, preparation, active, 
service, alarm). In real-world deployments, the 
information may be obtained from a Manufacturing 
Execution System (MES).  
− 
Cyber attacks detected by an integrity monitoring system 
or an intrusion detection system, supervising the CPS.

C. Authenticating Physical Signals  
In data communication, the sender of a data packet can be 
identified by an identifier, e.g., an internet protocol (IP) 
address or a media access control (MAC) address. The sender 
may be authenticated cryptographically. A data firewall can 
filter data packets depending on address information and 
content. 
In a physical world, the source of a signal can in general 
not be identified by an explicit identifier, included in the data 
communication. However, it is usually possible to identify the 
source implicitly based on the cabling.  
A higher level of confidence can be achieved by 
performing signal authentication. The sender of a signal can 
be identified by a sender-specific fingerprint information, e.g., 
a noise signal. Furthermore, it is possible to actively add a 
signal marker (signal watermarking), e.g., a coded spread-
spectrum signal [14][15][16]. This allows to identify the 
source of a signal by evaluation properties of the signal.  
V. 
EVALUATION 
The security of a cyber system can be evaluated in practice 
in various approaches and stages of the system’s lifecycle: 
− 
Threat and Risk Analysis (TRA or TARA) of a cyber 
physical system (for a system being under design or in 
operation). In a TRA, possible attacks (threats) on the 
system are identified. The possible impact and 
probability are evaluated to determine the risk of the 
identified threats.  
− 
Security checks can be performed during operation or 
during maintenance windows to determine key 
performance indicators (e.g., check for compliance of 
device configurations). 
− 
Security testing (penetration testing) can be performed 
for a system that has been built, but that is currently not 
in operation. The system is attacked by “white hat” 
hackers to identify vulnerabilities that need to be 
addressed.  
− 
Security testing can be performed also on a digital 
representation of a target system, e.g., a simulation in the 
easiest case. This allows to perform pentesting for 
systems that are not existing yet physically (design 
phase), or to perform pentesting of operational systems 
without the risk of disturbing the regular operation of the 
real-world system.  
A holistic protection concept has to address measures for 
protect, detect, and react. No single measure or security 
technology alone can result in an adequate security level. It is 
always a set of measures that, when used in combination, can 
bring down the risk to an acceptable level.  
The security measures presented in this paper, acting on 
the interface between the cyber world and the physical world, 
provide an additional security measure that can be used as part 
of a defense-in-depth security concept. It is complementary to 
well-known security measures that focus on the IT/cyber part. 
The protection is complementary, as it operates directly at the 
interface towards the physical world, not on computer-based 
control functions as conventional IT security technologies. 
Even if all security measures in the pure IT/cyber world fail, 
still the impact on the physical world can be controlled. It can 
serve as “last line of defense”, allowing to connect cyber 
systems from the physical world in a tightly controlled way, 
or even disconnecting some automation systems from the 
physical world when needed.  
As long as the proposed technology has not been proven 
in real-world operational setting, it can be evaluated 
conceptually by analyzing the impact the additional measure 
has on the identified residual risks of a TRA. A TRA identifies 
threats against a system, and determines the risk depending on 
probability and impact. The general effect of the presented 
security measure is that the impact of a threat on the physical 
world is reduced. Whatever attack is ongoing on the 
automation and control system, still the possible impact on the 
real, physical world is limited. So, the measure helps to reduce 
the risk of threats having an impact on the physical world. 
However, TRAs for real-world CPS are not available publicly. 
Nevertheless, an illustrative example may be given by a 
chemical production plant performing a specific process like 
refinery, or a factory producing glue or cement. If the plant is 
attacked, the attack may target to destroy the production 
equipment by immediately stopping the process leading to 
physical hardening and thus to a permanent unavailability of 
the production equipment. In this case, trusted sensors could 
be used to detect a falsified sensor signal, and the physical-
world firewall can be used to limit actions in the physical 
world. Thereby, a physical damage of the production 
equipment can be avoided. If needed, a controlled shutdown 
of the production site can be performed.   
A major advantage of the physical-world firewall is the 
property that it can be added to existing brownfield 
deployments. Legacy equipment, may be 10 or even 20 years 
old, not even been designed with security in mind, and without 
getting patches. In such cases, the physical-world firewall can 
be used as an “add-on” security measure for an existing CPS. 
It can be used as compensating countermeasure to address 
security requirements defined by industrial security standards 
like IEC62443-3.3 [10], where conventional cyber security 
measures cannot be deployed. However, it can be used also as 
additional layer of defense in CPS having state-of-the-art 
security measures integrated, thereby increasing the level of 
protection even further.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
A CPS comprises cyber-technology and the physical 
world. Both parts have to be covered by a security concept and 
solution. Traditional cyber security puts the focus on the 
cyber-part, i.e., automation and control systems. The security 
of the physical part, like machinery, is protected often by 
physical and organizational security measures, only. This 
paper presented the concept for a new approach that enhances 
the achieved level of security by protecting the interface 
between the cyber-part and the physical world, thereby 
enhancing the resilience of a CPS being under attack.
