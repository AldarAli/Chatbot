Abstract—In this paper, we propose a hybrid interweave-
underlay spectrum access technique to share the licensed 28 GHz 
millimeter-wave spectrum of one Mobile Network Operator 
(MNO), termed as primary MNO, with small cells in a building of 
another MNO, termed as secondary MNO, in a country. The 
proposed technique explores the traditional interweave spectrum 
access technique by operating a small cell at the maximum 
transmission power if no user equipment of a primary MNO exists 
and the traditional underlay spectrum access technique by 
operating a small cell at a reduced transmission power if a user 
equipment of a primary MNO exists within the coverage of any in-
building small cell of a secondary MNO. We derive average 
capacity, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency and carry out 
extensive numerical and simulation results and analyses for a 
secondary MNO of a country consisting of four MNOs. It is shown 
that the proposed technique can improve the spectral efficiency by 
about 2.82 times, and the energy efficiency by about 73% of the 
secondary MNO as compared to that of the traditional static 
licensed spectrum allocation technique that allocates each MNO 
an equal amount of the 28 GHz millimeter-wave spectrum. 
Moreover, we show that the proposed technique can satisfy the 
expected spectral efficiency and energy efficiency requirements 
for Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile systems by reusing the 
millimeter-wave spectrum of the secondary MNO to its small cells 
of roughly 31%, 36%, and 72% less number of buildings than that 
required by the traditional interweave, underlay, and static 
licensed spectrum allocation techniques, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, radio spectrum scarcity has become a major 
issue in mobile communications due to a non-dynamic or static 
allocation of spectrum to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) 
to serve an ever-increasing user demand for high data rates and 
capacity. Such static allocations of spectrum cause a great 
portion of the spectrum to be left unused in time, frequency, and 
space, resulting in poor spectrum utilization. According to the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the spectrum 
utilization below 3 GHz changes considerably with an 
occupancy of around 15% to 85% [1]. Recently, Cognitive 
Radio (CR) has been considered as a key enabling technology 
to address this spectrum scarcity issue [2]. In CR, spectrum 
access is a major function [3], which prevents collisions 
between primary User Equipments (UEs) and Secondary UEs 
(SUs) in accessing any spectrum. In this regard, interweave and 
underlay are two major spectrum access categories in CR.  
In interweave access, SUs can opportunistically access only 
the spectrum not used by Primary UEs (PUs). Though 
interweave access needs additional spectrum sensing by SUs to 
find an idle spectrum of PUs, SUs are allowed to transmit at the 
maximum power. In contrast, in underlay access, SUs can 
simultaneously access the spectrum of PUs subject to satisfying 
the interference threshold set by PUs. Though underlay access 
suffers from the reduced transmission power of SUs to limit Co-
Channel Interference (CCI) to PUs, no spectrum sensing is 
needed by SUs. Hence, though both interweave and underlay 
have pros and cons as aforementioned, the combination of these 
two spectrum accesses can maximize the Spectral Efficiency 
(SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) [4]. More specifically, SUs 
can explore the interweave access when the spectrum of PUs is 
idle and the underlay access when the spectrum of PUs is busy. 
This allows SUs to operate at the maximum power during an 
idle period in contrast to operating at reduced power when 
employing only the underlay access all the time. 
A number of research works have addressed the hybrid or 
joint interweave-underlay spectrum access. For example, Khan 
et al. [5] have proposed a hybrid underlay-interweave mode 
enabled Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) scheme. Likewise, in 
[6], Zoe et al. have proposed a hybrid interweave-underlay 
spectrum access scheme using spectrum sensing in the 5 GHz 
license-exempt spectrum. Besides, for the performance 
analysis, Mehmeti et al. [2] have provided expressions that 
allow the performance comparison of the interweave and 
underlay modes under a unified network setup. Also, in [7], 
Jazaie et al. have presented the downlink capacity region of a 
secondary network in a multiuser spectrum sharing system for 
a hybrid underlay-interweave paradigm. However, a consensus 
about the more suitable spectrum access out of the interweave 
and underlay for SUs is not too obvious [2].  
Besides, most data are originated in indoors, particularly in 
dense urban areas where the existence of a large number of 
multistory buildings installed with small cells is an obvious 
scenario [8]. Hence, addressing high capacity and data rates in 
such buildings is crucial. In this regard, due to the favorable 
propagation characteristics of high-frequency millimeter-wave 
(mmWave) signals, such as low interference effects and the 
existence of Line-of-Sight (LOS) components, operating small 
cells at the mmWave spectrum in such buildings can be a 
promising candidate to provide high data rates and capacity. In 
line with this, a hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access 
technique for sharing the licensed mmWave spectrum of one 
MNO with in-building small cells of another to increase its 
available spectrum within multistory buildings can play a vital 
role in serving high capacity and data rates indoors, which, 
however, has not been addressed in the existing literature.

To address the issues outlined above, in this paper, we 
propose a hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access 
technique to share the licensed 28 GHz mmWave spectrum of 
one MNO, referred to as primary MNO (p-MNO), with small 
cells in a building of another MNO, referred to as secondary 
MNO (s-MNO), in a country. The proposed technique explores 
both the traditional interweave and underlay spectrum access 
techniques. The following are performed section-wise to 
address the proposed technique. In Section II, the proposed 
technique along with the system architecture are presented. In 
Section III, we perform relevant mathematical analysis to 
derive average capacity, SE, and EE performance metrics for s-
MNOs by employing the proposed technique. Section IV 
provides default simulation parameters and assumptions, as 
well as extensive numerical and simulation results and analyses 
for an s-MNO of a country consisting of four MNOs to 
demonstrate that the proposed technique can satisfy both the SE 
and EE requirements for Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile 
systems. We conclude the paper in Section V.  
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 
A. System Architecture 
We consider that four MNOs (i.e., MNO 1, MNO 2, MNO 
3, and MNO 4) are operating in a country. Assume that each 
MNO has a similar system architecture consisting of three types 
of Base Stations (BSs), namely Macrocell BSs (MBSs), 
Picocell BSs (PBSs), and Small Cell BSs (SBSs). For 
simplicity, we show the detailed architecture of only one MNO 
(i.e., MNO 1) in Figure 1(a). All SBSs are deployed only within 
3-Dimensional (3D) multistory buildings each serving one UE 
at a time. Both in-building SBSs and PBSs are located within 
the coverage of an MBS. Each macrocell UE of an MBS is 
served either by the MBS itself or by any PBSs within its 
coverage. SBSs within each building are considered to be 
operating at the 28 GHz mmWave spectrum, whereas MBSs 
and PBSs are operating at the 2 GHz spectrum (Figure 1(a)).  
We assume that each MNO is given a license for an equal 
amount of 28 GHz mmWave spectrum, and the spectrum of one 
MNO can be shared with in-building SBSs of another MNO 
following a hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access 
technique presented in the following section. Figures 1(b)-1(d) 
show an example for sharing the spectra of MNO 2, MNO 3, 
and MNO 4 as p-MNOs with an in-building SBS of MNO 1 as 
an s-MNO using the proposed technique by considering that the 
maximum of two UEs (one from MNO 1 and the other from 
any p-MNO) can exist simultaneously within the coverage of 
the SBS.   
B. Proposed Technique    
We propose a hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access 
technique for the dynamic spectrum access of the licensed 28-
GHz mmWave spectrum of one MNO to another in a country, 
stated as follows.  
“The licensed 28-GHz mmWave spectrum of one MNO 
(i.e., p-MNO) can be allowed to share with small cells in a 
building of another MNO (i.e., s-MNO) subject to operating 
each small cell of the s-MNO at the maximum transmission 
43

power if no UE of the p-MNO is present, but at a reduced 
transmission power if a UE of the p-MNO is present. The 
reduced transmission power is varied in accordance with the 
predefined interference threshold set by the p-MNO.”  
As indicated above, the proposed technique takes advantage 
of exploring both the interweave as well as underlay spectrum 
access techniques. Using the interweave access, small cells of 
an s-MNO in a building can access opportunistically the whole 
licensed 28-GHz spectrum of every single p-MNO in a country 
in time, frequency, and space by operating them at the 
maximum transmission power as long as no UE of the 
respective p-MNO is present at the same time. But, if a UE of 
any p-MNO is present, following the underlay access, each 
small cell of the s-MNO immediately reduces its transmission 
power corresponding to the predefined interference threshold 
set by the p-MNO to limit CCI to the UE of the p-MNO. In this 
regard, the small cells of the s-MNO keep sensing to detect the 
presence of UEs for each p-MNO to update the corresponding 
spectrum access mode of operation to either the interweave 
access or the underlay access such that the CCI constraint to 
UEs of the respective p-MNO can be guaranteed. More 
specifically, each small cell of an s-MNO needs to switch only 
between two states of its transmission power, either the 
maximum or the reduced one. For switching, both reactive and 
proactive spectrum sensing approaches can be applied to detect 
the usage of the shared spectrum of any p-MNO. In the reactive 
approach, an s-MNO performs spectrum sensing mechanisms 
to detect the usage on the shared spectrum, whereas in the 
reactive approach, based on the knowledge of the traffic model 
of the UEs of a p-MNO, the arrival of UEs can be predicted [9] 
to reduce the transmission power beforehand.

Assume that each MNO o has an SBS in each apartment, 
and each SBS can serve the maximum of one UE at a time. 
Assume that there are 4 MNOs in a country such that

. So, a maximum of four different UEs each 
from one MNO may exist at once in an apartment. Each UE has 
two states for existence (i.e., a UE of an MNO may either exist 
or not) in an apartment. Let the binary digits 1 and 0 denote, 
respectively, the existence and nonexistence of a UE of an 
MNO o in an apartment such that four UEs can coexist in an

2  possible ways, as shown in 
Table I.  
Assume that the existence of four UEs in an apartment for 
each possible way shown in Table I is equally likely. Hence, 
given the existence (i.e., the binary state 1) of a UE of an MNO 
o (i.e., an s-MNO) over the observation time of 
T  Q
, UEs 
of other MNOs O\o (i.e., p-MNOs)  can coexist with the UE of 
MNO o in a maximum of eight possible ways, as shown in 
Table I, each occurs with a probability of 1 8  and, hence, 
persisting for
Q 8
 during the observation time Q in an 
apartment.  
For example, for a UE

2

each occurs with a probability of 1 8  in an apartment. Assume 
that each MNO is allocated to an equal amount of spectrum of

1u  with other UEs (i.e., 
2

3u , and

apartment correspond to the amount of shared spectrum for

of 3M, 2M, 2M, 2M, M, M, M, and 0, respectively, for the 
interweave access, and of 0, M, M, M, 2M, 2M, 2M, and 3M  for 
the underlay access, as shown in Table I. These correspond to 
the total spectrum for

M, respectively, for the interweave access, and of M, 2M, 2M,

Now, if all SBSs in each building serve simultaneously in t
T, using Table I, the aggregate capacity served by an SBS of 
an MNO o (i.e., an s-MNO) can be found as follows. Let

IV. PERFORMANCE RESULT AND ANALYSIS 
Table II shows the default simulation parameters and 
assumptions used for evaluating the performance of the 
proposed technique for MNO 1, as an s-MNO. For the underlay 
access, we assume that the transmission power of an SBS is 
upper limited by 20% of its maximum power. To allow 
flexibility in switching between the interweave and underlay 
accesses, for each SBS, a separate transceiver is assumed to 
operate at the shared spectrum of M RBs of each p-MNO.  
Figure 2 shows improvement factors in terms of SE and EE 
performances for MNO 1 due to applying the proposed hybrid 
interweave-underlay technique, as well as the traditional 
interweave and underlay techniques. It can be found that the 
proposed hybrid technique improves both the SE and EE 
metrics of MNO 1 considerably as compared to that of the 
traditional interweave and underlay techniques when applied 
separately. This is because, using Table I, the maximum amount 
of the shared spectrum obtained by employing the proposed 
technique is 3 times (interweave and underlay techniques each 
contributing 1.5 times) the spectrum of MNO 1 of M RBs for 
any observation time Q. This causes the proposed technique to 
increase the licensed spectrum of M RBs to 4M RBs for MNO 
1 in time Q. Since the capacity, and hence SE, is directly 
proportional, whereas the EE is inversely proportional, to the 
spectrum, the proposed technique improves SE by about 2.82 
times, whereas EE by about 73%, of MNO 1, as shown in 
Figure 2. 
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show, respectively, the SE and EE 
responses for MNO 1 by reusing the mmWave spectrum of 
MNO 1 to its small cells in each building due to applying the 
proposed technique, as well as the traditional interweave, 
underlay, and SLSA techniques for a number of buildings of 
small cells. It can be found that, with an increase in l, SE 
increases linearly, whereas EE improves negative exponentially 
for all techniques, and the proposed technique outperforms all 
techniques in terms of SE and EE.

Figure 2. SE and EE improvement factors for an s-MNO (i.e., MNO 1) due to applying different techniques for a single building of SBSs. 
 
Moreover, according to [19] [20], it is expected that the 6G 
mobile systems will require 10 times average SE (i.e., 270-370 
bps/Hz), as well as 10 times average EE (i.e., 0.3µJ/bit), of 5G 
mobile systems [21]-[23]. Using Figure 3, the values of l that 
satisfy both SE and EE requirements for 6G mobile systems are 
9, 13, 14, and 32, respectively, for the proposed hybrid, 
interweave, underlay, and SLSA techniques.  
 
Figure 3. (a) SE and (b) EE performances for MNO 1 due to applying 
different techniques for multiple buildings of SBSs. 
According to the evidence above, the proposed hybrid 
interweave-underlay technique can satisfy both SE and EE 
requirements for 6G mobile systems by reusing the whole 
mmWave spectrum of MNO 1 to its small cells of roughly 31%, 
36%, and 72% less number of buildings than that required by 
the traditional interweave, underlay, and SLSA techniques, 
respectively. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid interweave-
underlay spectrum access technique to share the licensed 28 
GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum of one MNO with 
small cells in a building of another MNO in a country. We have 
derived average capacity, Spectral Efficiency (SE), and Energy 
Efficiency (EE) performance metrics for the proposed 
technique and carried out extensive numerical and simulation 
results and analyses for MNO 1 of a country consisting of four 
MNOs. It has been shown that the proposed technique can 
improve the SE by about 2.82 times and the EE by about 73% 
of MNO 1 as compared to that of the traditional Static Licensed 
Spectrum Allocation (SLSA) technique. Further, we have 
shown that the proposed technique can satisfy both SE and EE 
requirements for 6G mobile systems by reusing the mmWave 
spectrum of MNO 1 to its small cells of roughly 31%, 36%, and 
72% less number of buildings than that required by the 
traditional interweave, underlay, and SLSA techniques, 
respectively. 
The proposed technique can be investigated further for a 
complete analysis to address numerous crucial issues, including 
millimeter-wave bands other than 28 GHz, such as 26 GHz, 38 
GHz, and 60 GHz, non-LOS path loss models, directional 
millimeter-wave antennas, spectrum sensing mechanisms and 
control signaling overhead, implementation complexity 
analysis, burst traffic characteristics, random deployments of 
indoor UEs, as well as serving more than one UE 
simultaneously by a single small cell in a building.
