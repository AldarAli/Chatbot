Abstract—This short paper presents results of a survey made 
with disabled people, to understand how they feel when visiting 
public locations with accessibility problems. It focuses 
especially on topics related to find the most suitable place, in 
terms of accessibility, in big cities. This version focus on bars 
and restaurants in Brazil. In addition, it presents existing 
applications that intend to assist disabled people to reach 
selected places. Finally, it elicits the opportunity to present a 
new digital solution, called Party4All, which presents 
opportunities to be more accessible and efficient than 
the depicted application.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that 
human rights should be applied to everyone, but in practice, 
they are often denied to disabled people. Their interest a 
frequently ignored, either for political, economic or social 
motivations [1].  
Around 15 percent of world's population, or estimated 
one billion people, live with disabilities. They are the world's 
largest minority. Eighty percent of people with disabilities 
live in developing countries, according to the UN 
Development Program [2].  
Brazil - which will be used as representative of 
developing countries to investigations and solution proposed 
in this short paper - has about 45.6 million people with 
disabilities. They represent approximately 23.92% of the 
country population [3]. In Figure 1, is possible to see the 
percentage of people for each type of disability. According 
to Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 38.4 
million of these people live in urban areas [4]. These areas 
come to be where most of the public services are located.  
An appropriately designed environment may include 
enabling positive experiences of all users; yet public spaces 
are not always concerned about people with disability 
accessibility, in the universal sense. But manufacturers and 
builders who use the universal design concept, design their 
products and buildings to be as usable as possible by a 
larger population including children, older people, and 
people with disabilities. [5]. This universal approach to the 
designed environment allows the full social participation of 
everyone in the activities of public spaces regardless of age 
or ability. Everyone should have the right to choose and 
move around freely in any environment. No matter who, a 
person must have the chance to do what s/he wants and 
needs, including accessing houses, work, transportation, or 
social venues [6].

This short paper has as main goal to analyze disabled 
people accessibility experience when attending bars and 
restaurants in big cities of developing countries. It also 
investigates how these people feel about places that are not 
prepared to provide adequate services to them. Besides the 
bars and restaurants services, this paper also talks about a 
search over existing application that have the purpose to 
assist disabled people in finding accessible establishments. 
In addition, as result of this investigation, the paper presents 
a new digital solution proposal that aims to be more 
complete and efficient than other solutions found during the 
previous search.  
Section II presents the background material. It also talks 
about accessibility concepts and challenges faced by people 
with limited mobility, when attending a place not adapted to 
receive them. In Section III, there is an analysis of three 
digital solutions that intend to help disabled people to find 
accessible places. The user survey results are also detailed. 
In Section IV, conclusion and next steps are described.

II. 
BACKGROUND 
A few years ago, it was rare to find a space with adapted 
toilets for people with disabilities or reduced mobility in 
bars or restaurants; today this is a trend. The Brazil 
national´s 
and 
regional´s 
laws 
state 
accessibility rules, and the increased importance of 
accessibility in the business marketing. Looking for a new 
audience and a consumer who values social commitment, 
the entrepreneurs begin to see the importance of adapting to 
accessibility rules, presenting opportunities in the field of 
adaptation. There are laws that require adequacy of tourist 
and leisure facilities to the requirements of ABNT 9050, 
making these spaces accessible to all people, including those 
with some type of special needs [7]. 
Although there are several studies on tourism and 
accessibility, there are few, or almost nonexistent, 
researchers focused on accessibility in gastronomical 
enterprises [8]. During an ethnographic digital research on 
specialized websites and social network communities, 
focused on disabled people – one of the first’s steps of 
investigation to produce this paper - it was possible to see 
that this public wants to know more, enjoy and promote 
social inclusion initiatives. Anonymous statements on 
Brazilian Adapted Tourism blog attest that, when they go to 
accessible bars and restaurants, they recommend them. If 
not, they spread around the web their opinion about the bad 
services [9]. 
Focusing on this, an opportunity was perceived to work 
on an application to help them to map bars and restaurants, 
according to their suitability for accessibility, in large cities. 
The app should also help to find these sites easily, helping 
people with disabilities to get to the establishments, and 
entrepreneurs to propagate their services. 
Accessibility is, according to Brazil´s Law No. 5,296 / 
2004, a condition to use, with security and autonomy in 
whole or assisted spaces, furniture and urban equipment, 
buildings, transport services and devices, systems and 
means of communication and information for people with 
disabilities or reduced mobility. An accessible environment 
permits to be utilized and enjoyed by anyone, including 
those with disabilities [10]. 
Although people with disabilities are often seen with the 
stereotype of being unable to lead a normal life, they show 
up to be active and able to interact. They can participate in 
any activities as others, if provided adequate accessibility 
conditions [1]. During our ethnographic research, we found 
out how much people with disabilities were bothered about 
not having their rights respected, as much as any other 
citizen rights. Frustration and anger are feelings that 
appeared in their testimony. They state, “The world persists 
in believing that they would be locked in the house”.  
       However, 
instead 
of 
complying 
with 
these 
preconceptions, they show disposition to fight to make 
everyone understand that they have a life, and they want to 
live it as any other [9].  
III. 
SIMILAR APPLICATIONS  
During investigative web researches and consultations 
with experts on disabilities – one professional and one 
director of a disability association - just a few mobile device 
applications showed to be available to assist people with 
limited mobility to name and locate properties that fall out 
the accessibility rules, particularly in Brazil. Three of them 
stood out and were chosen to an analysis, that took into 
account the following aspects: served platforms; general 
visual aspect; possibility to add new establishments; 
coverage of bars and restaurants in 5 biggest cities in Brazil; 
main features; possibility to share results and comments on 
social networks; feedback for establishment owners. Results 
of this research come next. 
A. Clapp-in 
Clapp-in is an application produced in Brazil with 
objective to allow users to applaud public or private 
establishments, according to their adaptation to accessibility 
[11]. With announced intention to promote social inclusion 
of people with disabilities in tourism and leisure, it allows 
people to map, evaluate and comment on application with 
notes and opinions about the visited establishments. In 
Figure 2, one can see app´s screenshots with a home screen, 
where user is introduced to  application and its objective and 
also a main screen image, with a list of establishments, its 
addresses and evaluation results, represented by claps icons 
(from 
0 
to 
5 
claps).  
 
 
Figure 2. Clapp-in screenshots 
 
Available for Android, it was possible to install it only 
on one of the four devices in which we performed tests –
Samsung Grand Duo (Android 4.1.2), showing that it still 
does not seem adapted to the various versions of platform. 
The other phones were a Samsung SII TV  (Android 4.2) 
and 2 Moto G (Android 5.0.2).

Clap-in has a simple design, but makes it clear to user its 
objective, and is not difficult to use. However, share 
comments on social networks or send feedback to 
establishment owners, are not possible with this application. 
Moreover, the numbers of establishments already registered 
at app are not significant, in comparison with the millions of 
public services offered in one of the 5 biggest cities in 
Brazil, which were taken into account during this analysis. 
That can make the app not very helpful for the user. 
B. Accessible Tourism 
Accessible Tourism is a Brazilian Ministry of Tourism 
program application and has the function of allowing 
collaborative construction of accessible establishment’s data 
bank throughout the country [12]. Available in IOS and 
Android, it allows users to add new establishments in the 
system and information, such as city and type of service, 
covering not only bars and restaurants, but any public site. 
Users can also rate and seek for establishments according to 
type of disability. In Figure 3, one can see some of 
application´s screenshots: home screen with shortcuts to 
find accessible places according to disability type and a 
screen listing establishments prepared to receive people with 
physical disabilities. 
With attractive design, large icons with clear metaphors 
and list items placed so user can select them and perform 
searches with ease, as well as an information hierarchy well 
planned, the application shows efficiency. This app has no 
integration with social networks and it has no possibility to 
locate establishments on a map for easy access. It was also 
noted that only 2 of the 5 biggest Brazilian cities have a 
significant number of feedbacks or information inputs.

C. Wheelmap 
 
Whellmap [13] is an online map to search, find and mark 
wheelchair accessible places around the world. It permits 
anyone to participate in this map, marking public places as 
restaurants, cinemas, bar or supermarkets. Wellmap is 
available for website, iPhone and Android. Easy to install, 
the app on iPhone 6 has an attractive and clear layout. Users 
can easily find establishments, evaluate them, comment and 
share by twitter, Facebook or email. They can also filter 
establishments on the map by categories, which is very 
useful. Although it was possible to see that are many places 
already mapped in Brazil, just a very few of them had their 
wheelchair accessibility marked. Figure 4 presents some app 
screenshots: a map with various establishments, identified 
according to their accessibility level. There is also a screen 
shot with more details of a restaurant, showing options for 
sharing, commenting and tracing the route to go there [13]. 
 
 
Figure 4. Whellmap screenshots 
 
When conducting this research on Whellmap, we wonder 
why Brazilian government data is not part of this 
international effort to map accessible establishments, rather 
than having its own application for this. The answer could be 
in the new Law project 5.344 / 13, which establishes the 
regulatory framework of cloud computing and states that to 
acquire cloud computing services agencies of federal 
administration shall require that data center is located in 
Brazil. The measure intends to ensure that Brazilian law 
prevails, over any other, in case of contractual discussion and 
protects data, since contractor has to be subject to audit [15]. 
IV. 
USER SURVEY 
By comparing the 3 applications, it was possible to find 
important inputs to determine what features presented at 
them could be interesting to add to a new solution proposal, 
and which ones are not relevant to this new app objectives. 
Adding a new establishment and evaluating a local business, 
is a common feature for all of them. They are also easy to 
9

SMART 2015 : The Fourth International Conference on Smart Systems, Devices and Technologies

use and seem to have enough tools to realize their main 
objective – allow users to evaluate a local business, 
according to its accessibility. However, some items, like 
lower coverage in Brazilian cities and giving no possibility 
to contact the local owners directly, or share opinions on 
social networks, are features that need to be considered in a 
new solution. The 3 apps are also very embracing in terms of 
public services types and what makes it difficult for a user to 
find a specific bar or restaurant nearby, for example.  
After the ethnographic digital research and similar 
applications analysis, the next step was to make semi-
structured interviews with disabled people. A total of 10 
interviews were conducted, of which 5 people had physical 
disabilities, and 5 were blind. The intention was to 
understand who they are, what their recreational habits and 
interests are, how satisfied they are with restaurants and bars 
accessibility.  
The research also intended to identify whether there was 
an opportunity to offer a digital service to help people with 
disabilities or limited mobility, on having the same rights 
when attending public institutions. In addition, if there was 
this need, which were their main interests as users of this 
service? We also tried to find out if they knew any 
application to help find and map accessible places in Brazil. 
We also wanted to know if they knew an app with this 
objective and their opinion about it. 
The interviews resulted in rich testimonials and showed 
some of the problems faced by disabled people. In general, 
they stated that there were huge improvements in 
accessibility of bars and restaurants in recent years. They 
believe that Brazilian federal and state laws, which demand 
establishments to meet accessibility requirements to have 
operating license, caused it.  
The 
interviewees 
display 
autonomy 
when 
the 
environment has ideal accessibility conditions. They are 
able to work, study, drive, practice sports, and socialize with 
friends. They rely on these friends to help them, when going 
to places that are not easily accessible for them, but prefer to 
go to the ones that give them freedom without any help. In 
Figure 5, some interviewees can be seen. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Some of the survey respondents 
      
        A few problems were recurrent in their answers. The 
sidewalks are not appropriate and make difficult accessing 
places. 
Sometimes 
stairs 
are 
the 
only 
access 
to 
establishments and others, the entrance to wheelchairs is 
through the service door. Even the bathrooms, which should 
comply with disabled people necessities, occasionally, have 
doors opening inside, what make impossible for wheelchair 
users to close them. 
During the interviews, people said that they find out 
about accessible places through friends, social networks or 
websites. In spite of them being regular users of 
smartphones, they only heard about the digital applications 
found during mentioned research, having no opportunity to 
download it and use it. However, they showed interest in 
having an application that helps to choose a place, according 
to accessibility and share their impressions about it with 
friends. They declared to be available to collaborate with 
user tests, when the time comes. 
Looking for services to facilitate their movements and 
ensure their rights, allowing life quality, is almost a 
consensus among them. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS 
By reading through blogs and communities in social 
networks, in addition to interviews with disabled or with 
limited mobility people, was possible to observe that they 
are increasingly leaving their houses, looking for their 
rights, and using digital media to do so. They want a more 
active life and to be able to attend bars and restaurants that 
are prepared to receive them. 
After the survey and conducted research, there was an 
indication that a collaborative application could be of a great 
help in promoting the social inclusion of people with special 
needs. This application should allow users to help build an 
information database, focused on mapping bars and 
restaurants, according to how accessible a place is. It also 
has to be possible to evaluate and find these places, besides 
enabling search for locations and trace route. They should 
also be able to share thoughts about these establishments on 
social networks, thus promoting greater awareness of 
services offered or problems faced. 
The application proposed in this work - Party4all - 
intends to allow users to use their smartphones, find and 
map places, rate them by level of accessibility, check rates 
and comments created by other users. It is also possible to 
share all information and insights through social networks, 
allowing sharing good or bad initiatives. It also permits to 
communicate with bars and restaurants owners, to let them 
know their evaluation and give them the opportunity to 
communicate directly with their clients and give them 
feedbacks.  
As represented in the application architecture, Figure 5, 
the sharing collaborative network cycle should go through 
the following steps: People, regardless of their disability 
status, should be able to add information to the tool and 
share on social networks. By doing this, it is expected that 
those places will have more clients improving their 
10

experience, changing the overall grade, and therefore 
spreading new information on social networks. 
This should promote greater comfort and mobility in 
bars and restaurants for people with disabilities or with 
locomotion difficulties. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Party4all information architecture 
 
The next step to accomplish this goal is related to 
publish studies and researches on, why people in Brazil 
appear not to have a significant participation in worldwide 
initiatives, like the Whellmap itself, or other international 
services that collaborate with social inclusion through 
technology; 
Study the most suitable option to implement the solution 
itself and the possibility to take advantage of collaborative 
production is also a future step. This would bring new 
challenges to the project.  
The development should start with an Android 
application, since this platform had been used by 91.6% of 
Brazilian smartphones in 2014 [16]. Nevertheless, more 
investigation will be made to decide, for example, what 
technology is going to be used to map places.  
At the same time, the user experience solution will be 
built, through sketching and prototypes that can be tested 
with users. We also need to answer questions such as if the 
information is sufficient, or if more details are needed. 
Inputs as these and others will be primordial to have a 
solution. That will help achieve the goal to promote social 
inclusion in an engaged and efficient way.
