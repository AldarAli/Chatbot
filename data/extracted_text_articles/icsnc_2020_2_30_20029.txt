Abstract—The traditional static and dedicated allocation of a 
portion of the spectrum specified for a country suffers from 
low spectrum availability and utilization for a Mobile Network 
Operator (MNO). To overcome these constraints, in this paper, 
we present an idea of a new technique for the spectrum 
allocation called Countrywide Full Spectrum Allocation 
(CFSA) that considers a dynamic allocation of the countrywide 
full millimeter-wave spectrum to each MNO to operate its in-
building small cells subject to the co-channel interference 
management for a certain renewed-term. We present CFSA 
comprehensively, highlighting its rationale, significance, major 
concern, possible solution, and performance evaluation with 
respect to the traditional static spectrum allocation technique.

INTRODUCTION  
A. Background  
The radio spectrum in mobile communication systems is 
one of the most critical requirements. Over time, though the 
demand of mobile users in terms of data rate and volume 
increases due to the increased use of rich multimedia 
services, the available spectrum to serve user demands 
allocated to a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) has not 
been increased proportionately (Saha [1]). As this trend 
continues to grow, the gap between the required spectrum to 
serve user demands and the spectrum available for an MNO 
continues to increase accordingly. Another major reason for 
the scarcity of spectrum goes to how the spectrum specified 
for a country is allocated to its MNOs. More specifically, 
traditionally, a portion of the countrywide spectrum is 
allocated to each MNO exclusively in an equal amount (in 
most cases) and a static manner for the long term.  
However, the number of users of one MNO differs from 
another and so does their required spectrum. This causes an 
MNO with more users to experience insufficiency of the 
spectrum, whereas the other, with fewer users, to waste part 
of its allocated spectrum. Moreover, irrespective of the 
number of users of each MNO, the user traffic demand of 
one MNO varies much from another in time and space. But, 
due to the static and dedicated use of spectrum by each 
MNO over a large coverage, a significant amount of its 
allocated spectrum may be either unused or underutilized 
(Hasan et al. [2]). Hence, such a static and dedicated 
allocation of a portion of the full spectrum specified for a 
country to each MNO is no longer considered sufficient to 
address its ever-increasing user demands (Saha [3]), as well 
as efficient to utilize the allocated spectrum, particularly in 
urban multistory buildings as most data is generated in such 
indoor environments.  
B. Related Work  
Numerous approaches, namely spectrum aggregation, 
trading, sharing, and reusing have been proposed in the 
existing literature to increase the amount, as well as the 
utilization of the spectrum. For example, Yuan et al. [4] 
have analyzed the key challenges of realizing carrier 
aggregation techniques, whereas Park et al. [5] have 
evaluated the performances of carrier aggregation schemes 
in Long-term Evolution-Advanced systems. Further, Xing et 
al. [6] have considered spectrum trading in the context of 
multiple sellers and multiple buyers, whereas Niyato et al. 
[7] have proposed a scheme for selling the spectra of 
multiple primary users to multiple secondary users.  
For spectrum sharing, Saha [8] has proposed a technique 
to share both licensed and unlicensed spectra with small 
cells, whereas Attiah et al. [9] have studied spectrum sharing 
approaches in millimeter-wave systems. Likewise, Joshi et 
al. [10] have proposed an analytical model to reuse the 
microwave spectrum, whereas Saha [11] has proposed an 
analytical model to reuse the 28 GHz millimeter-wave 
spectrum in a building of Small Cell Base Stations (SBSs). 
However, the above approaches can be avoided if the 
countrywide full-spectrum is made available to each MNO, 
as opposed to just a portion of it in the traditional static 
spectrum allocation technique, to ensure large spectrum 
availability, as well as efficient utilization of the allocated 
spectrum, to serve a large volume of indoor data at high 
rates for the existing and upcoming mobile networks.  
C. Organization  
To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a 
technique for allocating the countrywide full millimeter-
wave spectrum in Section II. In Section III, major concerns 
(e.g., co-channel interference) and possible solutions of the 
proposed technique are discussed. We evaluate the 
performance of the proposed technique in Section IV and 
conclude the paper in Section V.

II. 
PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 
The microwave spectrum, particularly below 3 GHz is 
almost occupied, and the millimeter-wave spectrum has 
been considered as a potential candidate for the Fifth-
Generation (5G) and beyond mobile systems. Hence, to 
overcome these aforementioned constraints associated with 
the traditional static and dedicated spectrum allocation 
technique, in this paper, we present a new idea for the 
millimeter-wave spectrum allocation called countrywide full 
spectrum allocation (CFSA) stated as follows.  
Each MNO of a country is allocated dynamically to the 
full millimeter-wave spectrum specified for the country to 
operate its in-building small cells subject to managing Co-
Channel Interference (CCI) for a certain renewed-term tr. 
The spectrum licensing fee for each MNO is updated in 
accordance with the number of its subscribers for each 
term. Hence, the proposed CFSA technique ensures the 
availability of a large amount of spectrum by allocating the 
countrywide full (instead of a portion) millimeter-wave 
spectrum, as well as an efficient spectrum utilization by 
allowing dynamic and flexible (instead of static and 
dedicated) access to each MNO. Moreover, as opposed to 
being bound to pay for the unused spectrum with few users, 
an MNO can pay only for the amount of spectrum that it 
uses to serve user demands at tr, resulting in reducing the 
cost per unit capacity (i.e., bps).   
Besides, to consider the dynamic number of users of 
MNOs, each SBS of all MNOs in an apartment of a building 
can keep sensing to detect the status of the shared full 
countrywide spectrum usage. Based on the CCI avoidance 
in time-domain, frequency-domain, or power-domain, each 
SBS updates the amount of time, spectrum, or transmission 
power, respectively. In this regard, depending on the 
maximum allowable control signaling overhead generated 
due to the coordination, SBSs either per apartment, per floor, 
or per building basis can form a cluster to coordinate with 
each other to update the CCI status locally in a distributed 
manner. Moreover, to detect the usage of the shared full 
spectrum, both reactive and proactive spectrum sensing 
approaches can be applied. In the reactive approach, an 
MNO performs the spectrum sensing mechanism to detect 
the usage on the shared spectrum, whereas in the reactive 
approach, based on the knowledge of the traffic model of 
User Equipments (UEs) of other MNOs O\o, the arrival of 
UEs can be predicted to update beforehand the usage of the 
shared countrywide full spectrum by an SBS of MNO o, 
where O denotes a set of MNOs in a country such 
that oO . 
III. 
      MAJOR CONCERN AND POSSIBLE SOLUTION  
A major concern of the proposed technique is that CCI 
may be generated when in-building small cells of more than 
one MNO attempt to access the 
same spectrum 
simultaneously. However, such CCI can be managed either 
in time, frequency, and power domains. In time-domain and 
frequency-domain, CCI can be avoided (Fig.1(b)) by 
allocating small cells of different MNOs in a different time 
interval (e.g., a transmission time interval of 1 ms) and 
frequency range (e.g., a resource block of 180 kHz) of the 
spectrum, respectively, using techniques such as time-
domain 
and 
frequency-domain 
Enhanced 
Intercell 
Interference Coordination (eICIC) (Lopez-Perez et al. [12]; 
Saha and Aswakul [13]).  
Recall that each MNO pays the spectrum licensing fee 
based on its number of subscribers for term tr. So, the 
optimal value of time and frequency for an SBS of an MNO 
o to serve its user traffic can be derived as the ratio of the 
number of subscribers 
No
 of an MNO o to the sum of the 
total number of subscribers of MNOs O\o (including those 
of MNO o) given that UEs corresponding to MNOs O\o are 
present within the coverage of SBS of MNO o and each 
MNO has exactly one SBS in each apartment that can serve 
only one UE at a time (Fig.1(b)). For example, in time-
domain eICIC, the optimal value of time in terms of the 
number of Transmission Time Intervals (TTIs) for an MNO 
o  at any Almost Blank Subframe (ABS) Pattern Period

access techniques, the transmission power of an SBS can be 
controlled to manage CCI. More specifically, using the 
interweave spectrum access, an SBS of an MNO o can be 
allowed to serve its user traffic at the maximum power as 
long as no UE of other MNOs O\o exists in the same 
apartment. If otherwise, the SBS of MNO o stops serving its 
users immediately by switching its transmission power off. 
Likewise, using the underlay spectrum access, an SBS of an 
MNO o can transmit simultaneously on the countrywide full 
spectrum by reducing its transmission power to a predefined 
CCI threshold level if a UE of other MNOs O\o exists in the 
same apartment as that of an SBS of MNO o. Hence, based 
on the presence of a UE of other MNOs O\o, using a hybrid 
interweave-underlay spectrum access, CCI can be managed. 
Let

      Note that, by exploiting the spatial domain, the 
countrywide full spectrum can be reused to in-building 
SBSs of an MNO o to increase the achievable capacity and 
spectrum utilization even further. For example, following 
Saha [14], by forming a 3-Dimensional (3D) cluster of SBSs 
in a building of an MNO o subject to satisfying a minimum 
CCI threshold both in the intra-floor, as well as inter-floor, 
levels, the same spectrum can be reused for each 3D cluster, 
as shown in Fig.1(a). Further, due to the high external wall 
penetration loss of a building for millimeter-wave signals, 
the countrywide full spectrum can be reused to SBSs of 
MNO o in adjacent buildings resulting in improving system-
level capacity and spectrum utilization further. The detailed 
modeling of the 3D clustering of SBSs can be found in Saha 
[14].     
IV. 
      PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  
We consider a simple example to evaluate the 
outperformance of CFSA, as follows. Assume that four 
MNOs 
are 
operating 
in 
a 
country 
such 
that 
oO ={1,2,3,4}
with a subscriber base of 40%, 30%, 20%, 
and 10%, respectively, of the total number of subscribers 
countrywide at tr. Let M=200 MHz denote the countrywide 
full millimeter-wave spectrum, which is allocated to each 
MNO based on its aforementioned subscriber base. 
Considering applying the frequency-domain CCI avoidance, 
the spectra allocated to MNOs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are given by 80 
MHz, 60 MHz, 40 MHz, and 20 MHz, respectively. Assume 
that the millimeter-wave link quality of each UE is given by 
3 bps/Hz.  
Note that the number of Resource Blocks (RBs) 
corresponding to 80 MHz for MNO 1 is given by 400 where 
an RB is equal to 180 kHz. Consider that the total 
observation time Tm=8 TTIs where each TTI equals to 1 ms. 
Also, 
Shannon’s 
capacity 
formula 
is 
given 
by 


1
log2
1 SINR
o
W
 


where W denotes bandwidth,  
SINR  defines Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio, and 


log2
1 SINR

denotes link quality.  
Now, using Shannon’s capacity formula, the capacity and 
Spectral Efficiency (SE) of MNO 1 when UEs of all MNOs 
O\o=1 are present with a small cell in each apartment of 
MNO 1 in a building are given by 1.728 Gbps (i.e., 

400RBs 0.18MHz/RB 3bps/Hz 8ms



) and 3 bps/Hz 
(i.e.,




1.728Gbps
400RBs 0.18MHz/RB 8ms


), resp-
ectively. Following the same procedure, the capacity and SE 
of MNO 1 are given by 4.32 Gbps and 7.5 bps/Hz, 
respectively, when no UE of MNOs O\o=1 is present with a 
small cell in each apartment of MNO 1 (Fig.1(b)). However, 
when applying the Traditional Static Spectrum Allocation 
(TSSA) technique, by assuming that each MNO is allocated 
to an equal amount of 50 MHz spectrum, using the same 
procedure as above, the capacity and SE are given by 1.08 
Gbps and 3 bps/Hz, respectively. These show an 
outperformance in capacity and SE of 60% and 0% for the 
maximum CCI, and 300% and 150% for no CCI of CFSA 
over TSSA. Hence, CFSA improves the capacity ranging 
from 60% to 300%, as well as the SE ranging from 0% to 
150%, over TSSA.  
Now, assume that due to a high floor penetration loss, a 
3D cluster comprises 9 SBSs per floor each having 18 
apartments of a 10-story building. If we consider reusing the 
countrywide full spectrum to each 3D cluster of SBSs of 
MNO 1, it can be reused 20 times to SBSs in the building. 
Since the capacity is directly proportional to the spectrum 
reuse factor, and the allocated spectrum to MNO 1 of 80 
MHz does not change, the above capacity and SE improve 
by 20 times, irrespective of the level of CCI.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have presented an idea of allocating a 
countrywide full millimeter-wave spectrum to each MNO to 
increase the spectrum availability and utilization. We have 
broadly detailed the proposed technique and shown its 
outperformance in terms of capacity and spectral efficiency 
over the traditional static spectrum allocation technique. The 
proposed idea needs extensive study for its concrete 
realization. In this regard, a good starting point is to justify 
the possible solutions discussed in this paper to address the 
major concern of the proposed idea. More specifically, it is 
necessary to elaborate and develop techniques to manage 
co-channel interference in time, frequency, and power 
domains when allocating the full millimeter-wave spectrum 
to each MNO in a country, which we consider carrying out 
as part of our future work.
