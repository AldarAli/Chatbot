Abstract—Cooperative communication is a new and emerg-
ing wireless communication that exploits spatial diversity to
improve wireless channel capacity. Cooperative medium access
control (CoopMAC) protocol is a MAC protocol that involves
an intermediate relay between a transmitter and a receiver
in the cooperative network. In this paper, we identify various
attacks against CoopMAC and analyze security vulnerabilities
in CoopMAC. From our analytical results, it can be induced
that there is a need for an efﬁcient authentication procedure
which provides reliability and security for normal CoopMAC
communication. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst comprehen-
sive case study of security vulnerabilities caused by possible
security attacks in CoopMAC. Our results can be used to
design an efﬁcient and secure communication mechanism for
cooperative networks.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cooperative communication is indispensable for making
ubiquitous communication connectivity a reality. Coopera-
tive communication is an innovative wireless communication
mechanism that takes advantages of the open broadcast
nature of the wireless communication channel and the spatial
diversity to improve channel capacity, robustness, reliability,
delay, and coverage. In the cooperative communication net-
work, when the source node transmits data packet to the
destination node, some nodes that are close to source node
and destination node can serve as relay nodes by forwarding
replicas of the source’s data packet. Among the forwarding
methods employed by the relay nodes, amplify-and-forward
(AF), decode-and-forward (DF), and compress-and-forward
(CF) are the most common methods. The destination node
receives multiple data packet from the source node and
the relay nodes and then combines them to improve the
communication quality [1][2].
A MAC protocol called CoopMAC is designed to improve
the performance of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol [3] with
minimal modiﬁcation. It is able to increase the transmission
throughput and reduce the average data delay. It also utilizes
the multiple transmission rate capability of IEEE 802.11b,
1 to 11Mbps, and allows the source node far away from the
access point (AP) to transmit at a higher data rate by using
a relay node [4][5].
Although cooperative communication has recently gained
momentum in the research community, there has been a
great deal of concern about cooperative communication
mechanism and its security issues. There have been several
previous related works regarding communication techniques
and security issues for cooperative network. The work in
[1][2] described wireless cooperative communication and
presented several signaling schemes for cooperative com-
munication. In [4][5], a new MAC protocol for the 802.11
wireless local area network (WLAN), namely CoopMAC,
was proposed and its performance was also analyzed. The
potential security issues that may arise in a CoopMAC were
studied in [6], and various security issues introduced by
cooperating in Synergy MAC were also addressed in [7].
The [8] suggested cross-layer malicious relay tracing method
to detect signal garbling and to counter attack of signal
garbling by compromised relay nodes, while the [9] pre-
sented the distributed trust-assisted cooperative transmission
mechanism handle relays’ misbehavior as well as channel
estimation errors. Also, a performance of cooperative com-
munication in the presence of a semi-malicious relay which
does not adhere to strategies of cooperation at all time
was analyzed in [10], and a statistical detection scheme to
mitigate malicious relay behavior in DF cooperative environ-
ment was developed [11]. The examination of the physical
consequences of a malicious user which exhibits cooperative
behavior in a stochastic process was discussed in [12].
The [13] described a security framework for leveraging the
security in cognitive radio cooperative networks. However,
most of the works on cooperative communication is focused
on efﬁcient and reliable transmission schemes using the
relay and identiﬁcation of general security issues caused
by the malicious relay node. No work has been done on
the analysis of denial of service (DoS) vulnerability caused
by an attacked relay node in cooperative communication
environments.
In this paper, a cast study of DoS attack in CoopMAC is
presented for the ﬁrst time. Security vulnerabilities at each
protocol stage while attacking a cooperative communication,
namely between a source node and a relay node, between
a relay node and a destination node, and between a source
node and a destination node, is analyzed and compared. This
study differs from previous works in that it concentrates
on one signiﬁcant aspect of security vulnerability in the
CoopMAC, namely DoS vulnerability of CoopMAC caused
by the Dos attack of attacker node. This is believed to be the

Control packet exchange in CoopMAC protocol
ﬁrst comprehensive analysis and comparison of the security
vulnerability from possible DoS attack in CoopMAC. The
analytical results can be used to design an efﬁcient and
secure communication mechanism for cooperative commu-
nication security.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
section II, we describe the characteristics of CoopMAC.
Next, in section III, we identify some possible security
attacks against CoopMAC and then analyze the security
vulnerabilities at each protocol stage of CoopMAC. Finally,
in section IV, we review our conclusions and detail plans
for future work.
II. OVERVIEW OF COOPMAC PROTOCOL
CoopMAC is a MAC protocol based on the IEEE 802.11.
It employs request-to-send (RTS) and clear-to-send (CTS)
control packet to establish communication, which are over-
heard by other nodes besides the source node and the
destination node. The CoopMAC is totally compatible with
the legacy 802.11 protocol. It shows a communication
throughput increase and also reduces the transmission delay
experienced each data packet [4][5].
The exchange of control packets for CoopMAC is shown
in Fig. 1. First, source node S senses the communication
channel condition, busy or idle. If the channel is idle, source
node S sends the RTS packet, reserving the channel for
network allocation vector (NAV) duration. If not, source
node S should wait the channel is idle and then send the
RTS packet. When the relay node R receives the RTS packet
and decodes it successfully, it responds with a helper ready-
to-send (HTS) packet to the source S and the destination
node D. After receiving the RTS packet followed by HTS
packet, destination node D sends CTS packet to reserve the
channel for cooperative communication via the relay node
R. Even if destination node D does not receive the HTS
from the relay node R, it sends the CTS packet to the source
node S. But in this case, it reserves the channel for direct
transmission between the source node S and the destination
node D (Fig. 1(b)).
Once source node S receives the HTS packet from the
relay node R and the CTS packet from the destination
node D respectively, the cooperative transmission between
source node S and destination node D via the relay node
R starts (Fig. 1(a)). That is, source node S sends the data
packet to relay node R and relay node R then forwards
the packet received from source node S to destination node
D. On the other hand, if source node S has not received
the HTS packet from relay node R before the CTS packet
is received from destination node D, it transmits the data
packet directly to destination node D (Fig. 1(c)). After
destination node D successfully receives the data packet
from source node S, it sends an acknowledgment (ACK)
packet to source node S. Otherwise, destination node D
sends a negative acknowledgment (NACK), notifying source
node S of the failure of transmission. In addition, if source
node S receives no response from destination node D within
a speciﬁc timeout period, it will also notice the failure
of transmission to destination node D. For more complete
details of CoopMAC protocol, please refers to [3][4].
III. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN COOPMAC
Due to broadcast nature of the wireless channel and
cooperative nature, cooperative communication suffers from
various attacks.
For example, in Fig. 2, if source node S want to transmit
data packet to destination node D using the relay node
R, it ﬁrst sends out the RTS, and the relay node R then
reply with a HTS to source node S and destination node

Attacker A
Figure 2.
Example of DoS attack by neighboring node in CoopMAC
D. After receiving the RTS and the HTS, the destination
node D ﬁnally sends a CTS to source node S. However,
let’s assume attacker node A is much closer to source node
S than destination node D or it is between the source node
S and the destination node D. In this case, attacker node
A disguises itself as destination node D and responds with
a CTS to source node S. There is no countermeasure to
avoid this attack. That is, currently there is no suitable
countermeasure mechanism to prevent a reply attack in
the physical connection and authentication mechanism to
authenticate destination node D. Therefore, an arbitrary
attacker can respond with a CTS to neighboring nodes
and thus it results in disruption of the normal cooperative
transmission between nodes.
The goal of the attacker node is to obstruct the commu-
nication between source node and destination node. These
attacker nodes would exploit the weakness in cooperation
procedures, especially in the control packet exchange, and
disguise themselves as legitimate relays. We will introduce
some cases of attacks according to the control packet of
CoopMAC next.
A. Attack on RTS Control Packet
In the CoopMAC as shown in Fig. 3(a), attacker node
A sends the faked RTS to relay node R and destination
node D, and then waits for the HTS from relay node R as
well as CTS from destination node D. After the attacker
node A receives the HTS and the CTS, it sends a fake data
to the relay node R. Consequently, this attack results in a
transmission disturbance in the RTS and the data packet from
source node S. Accordingly, source node S can not start data
transmission to relay node R.
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 3(b), attacker node A
intentionally sends the faked RTS to only destination node
D. The legal RTS from source node S can be rejected
by destination node D due to an illegal previous RTS
received from attacker node A. Hence, CTS is sent from the
destination node D to attacker node A, which causes source
node S to continuously wait for the CTS from destination
node D. As a result, normal cooperative communication
between source node S and destination node D can not be
guaranteed.
B. Attack on HTS Control Packet
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the faked HTS is sent from attacker
node A to source node S and destination node D. Accord-
ingly, the legal HTS from relay node R is denied by source
node A and destination node D. Then, destination node D
sends CTS to source node A. After receiving the faked HTS
and CTS, source node S starts data transmission to attacker
node A, but relay node R. Due to this false transmission
to the attacker node A, cooperative communication between
source node S and destination node D via relay node R is
not established.
The potential security vulnerability from faked HTS in the
CoopMAC is also shown in Fig. 4(b). In the case of sending
faked HTS to only destination node D, since the destination
node is typically not come to know of this, although the
legal HTS is sent from the relay node R to destination node
D, it is denied by destination node D. Then, the destination
node D sends a CTS to source node S in order to notify
that it successfully receives the control packet. This also
means that attacker node A is an intended legitimate relay
node forwarding data packet. Therefore, if relay node R
receives the data packet from source node S, it doesn’t
forward data packet to the destination node D, but forwards
it the attacker node A. Finally, the attacker node A denies
cooperative communication service to the source node S by
simply dropping the data packet it receives. It also spoofs
an ACK, causing the source node S to wrongly conclude a
successful transmission.
C. Attack on CTS Control Packet
Fig. 5 shows a security vulnerability which caused by the
faked CTS from attacker node A. In this case, the attacker
node A sends a faked CTS to the source node S, informing
the source node S that it is an intended recipient of future
data packet. And, since the authentication is not applied
to CTS packet, the legal CTS from destination D can be
rejected by source node S due to a previous illegal CTS from
attacker node A. Just after receiving the CTS from attacker
node A, source node S transmits data packet to relay node
R. Subsequently, the relay node R receives the data packet
and then forwards received data packet to attacker node A.
The attacker node A may try to deny communication service
to the source by deliberately not forwarding data packet
received from the relay node R. Consequently, cooperative
communication between source node S and destination node
D is not established.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
Security is a principal issue that must be resolved in order
for the potential of cooperative communication networks
to be fully exploited. However, security issues related to
the design of cooperative network have largely not been
considered.
CoopMAC is one such extension to the MAC sublayer.
It was proposed to take advantage of cooperation, while
remaining backward compatible with legacy IEEE 802.11.
This paper presented the ﬁrst case study of DoS attack in the
CoopMAC. It also analyzed security vulnerabilities at each
protocol stage while attacking a control packet exchanged
among nodes. This work is the ﬁrst comprehensive analysis
of security vulnerability caused by DoS attack in CoopMAC.
It can be signiﬁcant in the use of designs of efﬁcient
authentication mechanism for secure CoopMAC. Moreover,
our analytical results can be applied not only to cooperative
network security, but also wireless sensor network (WSN)
security design in general.
In the future, the authors will attempt to design and im-
plement power-efﬁcient authentication mechanism suitable
for cooperative network. The plan is then to examine the
effect that the proposed authentication mechanism has on the
performance and efﬁciency of the cooperative transmission.
