Abstract— Developing countries lack the infrastructure 
for effective health care delivery, especially in remote 
areas. To prevent and manage the rising burden of 
chronic diseases in developing countries, health care 
services must reach even the most remote areas. The 
study presents the electronic health kiosk (EHK) as an 
effective and feasible solution to assess chronic disease 
status in remote areas of developing countries, having 
India as an example. Cross-sectional data was collected 
on a convenient sample of 429 subjects, 18 years and 
over, in urban, slum and tribal settings. Results show 
high prevalence of overweight subjects in urban settings 
(31.5%; n=70), a high prevalence of pre-hypertension 
overall (41.5%; n=178) and hypertension in tribal 
settings (26.1%; n=28), and high glucose prevalence in 
27% (n=116) of subjects overall, and (17.8%; n=19). 
EHKs can be used to assess these health outcomes in 
areas that normally are not covered due to lack of 
infrastructure or health personnel. These health kiosks 
can be a medium to deliver evidence-based, contextual 
and tailored multimedia health education modules 
improving the overall quality of health care among these 
populations. They can also help to raise awareness about 
health issues and create meaningful information for 
public health decision-making.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Chronic disease is a global burden responsible for over 
50% of worldwide mortality [1]. It is estimated that, in 
2020, chronic diseases will be the cause of 50 million deaths 
globally [2]. Their prevalence is increasing especially in 
developing countries, where diabetes alone is predicted to 
afflict about 298 million people in 2030 [3]. It has been 
estimated by the World Bank that controlling cardiovascular 
diseases would lead to improved life expectancy more 
effectively than trying to achieve WHO’s Millennium 
Development Goals related to selected infectious diseases 
and maternal and child health [4]. 
Prevention, 
however, 
is 
still 
scarcely 
supported 
financially and politically through public health programs, 
even though the potential damage on population health and 
economies worldwide is evident. In addition to it, many 
developing countries lack the infrastructure for effective 
health care delivery, especially in remote areas. Lack of 
qualified personnel is also a challenge to provide 
meaningful service, as low wages, insufficient living, and 
working conditions, are obstacles that prevent the trained 
workforce to establish themselves in these areas of extreme 
need [5]. In India, for example, where a shortage of health 
care professionals normally exists, remote areas are even 
more underserved. Urban areas in average have 3 times the 
number of health care providers compared to rural areas [6]. 
Another example, Brazil has its health resources also 
concentrated in urban settings, leaving a young and 
inexperienced workforce to deliver care in more remote 
municipalities [7]. To contain the spread of chronic diseases 
in developing countries, it is paramount to find ways to 
bring quality health care even to the most remote regions. 
The aim of this paper is to present the electronic health 
kiosk (EHK) as an effective and feasible solution to assess 
chronic disease status in remote areas of developing 
countries, having India as an example. The paper will be 
divided in 6 sections. Section I is the introduction. Section II 
will briefly explore the current state of health technologies 
and propose the EHK as a solution for delivering health care 
in remote areas. Section III will describe in detail the EHK 
used in this study. Section IV will present the methods and 
instruments used to conduct this research. Section V will 
identify the most relevant results. Section VI will be the 
conclusion and recommendations for future research.  
II. 
CURRENT STATE OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES 
Communication and information technologies have 
helped to change health care delivery to a model of 
management centered on the patient instead of the provider. 
Health care services are now able to reach beyond the 
traditional clinical settings, arriving to the point of care even 
in more isolated communities where these services are 
extremely needed.

Educating patients through computer technology use has 
been recognized as an effective measure to develop patient 
skills and knowledge, and improving chances of appropriate 
behavior. The necessity of offering better services at lower 
costs makes the use of computer technology essential to 
support health education [8]. Health promotion, and chronic 
disease prevention and surveillance, can be achieved through 
telehealth technology, which acquires, disseminates and 
stores health-related information electronically [9]. This 
technology can be presented and accessed in different 
formats such as web-based applications, mobile phone and 
alert systems, and telephone and video conferencing with 
patients [10,11].  
EHKs relieve the health care providers from the burden 
of providing preventive and continuous health education. 
Instead, they can then concentrate on the quality of their 
care, especially in circumstances that require immediate 
attention. EHKs can deliver interactive health information 
programs that are tailored to the specific needs of the 
community or the individual [12]. The ability to 
continuously tailor the EHK information based on patient’s 
input could be the inexpensive bridge to addressing his need 
for adequate information, customized to his ever-changing 
health status.  
The advantages of accessibility and a user-friendly 
interface can make kiosks a powerful tool for promoting 
health education in communities in both urban and rural 
settings. They are usually built as free-standing units, which 
facilitates their transportation and increases the possibility of 
providing access. They can be placed in health care settings 
or in any kind of public space [12, 13]. The EHK possesses a 
simplified interface and can be used by individuals from 
various backgrounds regardless of class or education level 
[12]. It also varies in many different levels, such as 
interactivity and feedback [12]. Kiosks can be an effective 
way to deliver high quality health care to remote areas in 
developing countries. 
III. 
THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH KIOSK  
The EHK used in this study is a multilingual standalone, 
internet and cell-phone based system. The kiosk has several 
calibrated metric physiological sensors that can capture a 
diversity of medical parameters, including blood pressure, 
blood sugar and weight. These measured parameters are 
communicated automatically to the software embedded in 
the touchscreen EHK. These sensors make EHK a useful and 
efficient approach to collect data electronically and help 
assess the actual state of the individual’s health. The kiosk 
can be utilized on its own without any assistance as it is user-
friendly, with minimal number of buttons and icons, and the 
program is very easy to operate and navigate through. 
For each individual, the EHK system generates a unique 
ID to which all gathered data is assigned. Individuals can 
then create their own username and password, allowing them 
to log into the system and access their health information at 
any time and from anywhere. The self-report information 
gathered can include socio-demographics (such as age, 
gender, and educational status), health behavior variables 
(including body mass index, smoking, drug and alcohol 
consumption), and clinical variables (including current state 
of diabetes, hypertension and cholesterol, history of 
medications, and lifestyle) (Figure 1). 
The quantitative and qualitative data measured and 
collected result in a unique health card that provides a 
snapshot of the individual’s multiple risk factors. Further, 
health information is provided to help address and manage 
these various risk factors, tailored according to the data 
collected in the EHK for the specific ID.   
IV. 
METHODS 
The study was conducted in a community setting in the 
city of Rourkela, state of Orissa, in India. Between the 
months of March and May 2010, a convenient sample of 
individuals was enrolled from three diverse geographical 
locations including urban, rural and tribal areas, to explore 
the utilization of a portable electronic health information 
kiosk for the assessment of chronic disease health risks, and 
compare the differences among them. The targeted 
population included adults older than 18 years, both male 
and female. Participation in the study was voluntary, and 
willing subjects were provided with a one-page summary 
where the study was explained. The study was approved by 
the University of Maryland Baltimore County Institutional 
Review Board. 
Subjects were asked to use the EHK described previously, 
which gathered subjective and objective data to understand 
the distribution of chronic diseases and associated risk in the 
diverse community settings.  
The subjective data gathered included responses to a 
series of multiple choice questions. These questions assessed 
location of residence (urban/slum/tribal); age (years); gender 
(male/female); highest level of education attained (less than 
high 
school/some 
college/graduate 
and 
above/none); 
smoking and alcohol history (presently/in the past/ never); 
height (feet, inches); ever told by a doctor about high blood 
sugar (yes/no/I don’t know) and if yes, are you currently 
being treated for your high blood sugar (yes/no/I don’t 
know); ever told by a doctor about high blood pressure 
(yes/no/I don’t know) and if yes, are you currently being 
treated for your high blood pressure (yes/no/I don’t know).

Objective data was gathered using the multiple calibrated 
physiological sensors which measured weight (kilograms), 
blood sugar and blood pressure. The readings were 
automatically transmitted to the touchscreen EHK. 
Descriptive analysis was performed using univariate 
statistics with results for the continuous variables being 
reported as means and standard deviations while results for 
the categorical variables were reported as frequency statistics 
as appropriate. Analysis of variance was performed to 
determine if there were any significant differences in the 
continuous variables across the different geographic settings 
including urban, slum and rural. Similarly chi-square 
analysis was performed to determine if there were significant 
differences in the proportion of the categorical variables and 
the geographic settings in which individuals were living. All 
analysis was performed using SAS V 9.1 and the results have 
been reported as p-values. 
V. 
RESULTS 
Cross-sectional data was collected on a convenient 
sample of 429 subjects, 18 years and over, in urban, slum 
and tribal settings. Fifty-two percent (n=222) of the subjects 
were from urban settings, followed by 23% (n=100) living in 
slum, and 25% (n=107) living in tribal settings. The average 
age was 41.98, and the majority of the population was male 
(61.3%; n=263). Subjects enrolled from slum settings, 
however, were predominantly females (69%; n=69). 
Although the majority of the subjects reported some college 
to post-graduate level of education (54.6%; n =234), most 
subjects in the slum and tribal settings had no formal 
education (40% and 36.4%, respectively) or at most high 
school level (44% and 37.4%, respectively). In the tribal 
setting, 36.4% (n=39) of subjects were current smokers, and 
29.9% (n=32) consume alcohol. 
Results showed a high prevalence of overweight subjects 
in urban settings (31.5%; n=70) (Table 2). Albeit in smaller 
numbers, overweight subjects were also identified in the 
tribal (12.1%; n=13) and slum settings (10%; n=10). A high 
prevalence of pre-hypertension among subjects was also 
detected (41.5%; n=178). It is important to note that in tribal 
settings, 26.1% (n=28) of the subjects were diagnosed with 
stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension. Abnormal blood sugar levels 
were detected in 27% (n=116) of subjects overall, while in 
the tribal setting 17.8% (n=19) had high glucose. Results 
also have shown that 79.4% of subjects (n=85) in tribal 
setting reported that they don’t know if they were ever told to 
have diabetes by a doctor (Figure 2).

These findings reflect an urgent need to utilize 
novel accessible and cost-effective technologies that can 
gather evidence-based data at the grassroots level so that 
timely interventions can be done to minimize the rising 
burden of chronic diseases in the rural and remote areas of 
developing countries.  
VI. 
CONLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The study results have shown that the prevalence of 
chronic diseases in tribal and slum communities is 
considerably high.

Results suggest that 1 in 3 subjects in urban settings are 
overweight, similar to what has been presented in a recent 
study where rates as high as 40% were measured in some 
urban areas [14]. Another important finding of the study was 
the high prevalence individuals in the tribal population with 
of pre-hypertensive status (34.6%; n=37) and hypertensive 
status (26.1%; n=28). High glucose levels were also detected 
in 17.8% (n=19) of subjects in the tribal setting. A very 
recent study in India, has presented similar prevalence with 
variations according to different Indian states [15].  
The state of Orissa, India, where Rourkela is located, has 
a population of over 40 million people. According to the 
2001 census, 85% lived in rural regions and 22% were tribal 
populations [16]. Of the Indian tribal population, however, 
25% doesn’t have access to health services [17]. This is a 
serious limitation for public health surveillance in India, as 
risk factors and harmful health conditions are not being 
assessed in a regular basis. Studies have been consistently 
detecting a high number of individuals with undiagnosed 
chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, among 
populations in different areas of the country [15,18].  
EHK can be a feasible technology to assess burden of 
risk of chronic diseases at the grassroots level and even in 
resource poor environments. These assessments can provide 
us true representation of the risk burden and the evidence 
based data to make informed decisions and timely 
interventions for improving the overall well-being of the 
individuals, the communities and the environment they live 
in. However, due consideration should be given to design 
and develop accessible and tailored technologies that take 
into account health literacy of the individuals and utilize 
targeted mode of delivery of health promotion messages for 
better adoption of these technologies. Further research is 
warranted to determine the role of utilizing EHK as a 
medium to bridge the gap among individuals with different 
risk factors in various settings. 
Limitations of the study include the use of a convenient 
sample, although similitudes in measured characteristics with 
recent studies may attest to the representativeness of the data 
[14, 15, 18]. Results showed less percentage of females 
participating in the urban setting as compared to the slum or 
tribal settings. This difference might be due to more number 
of females being employed in the urban setting as compared 
to the others.  In addition, cultural variations in the diverse 
settings might also account for these differences in 
participation. Another limitation was the lack of cost-
effectiveness assessments for the use of EHK in these 
settings and the long-term impact on population outcomes. 
These assessments are currently being evaluated in the 
ongoing studies.  
The EHK can be the multifaceted solution to the difficult 
obstacles faced by public health in developing countries. 
There are current plans to implement EHK by engaging 
community health extension workers in the diverse Indian 
settings including urban, rural, slum and tribal. Further, the 
development of a randomized controlled clinical trial is in 
course. The aim is to test the EHK efficacy as an interactive, 
personalized, culturally adaptive, contextually relevant, 
accessible and cost-effective platform. Another goal will be 
to help improve health outcomes among populations in 
resource-poor environments.  
EHK can be used to assess chronic disease status in areas 
that normally are not covered by a developing country public 
health system due to lack of infrastructure or health 
personnel. EHK can be a medium to deliver evidence-based, 
contextual and tailored multimedia health education 
modules, and could improve the overall quality of health care 
among these populations as further research is needed to 
determine this.  
For governments and institutions to act, enacting policies 
that can improve health outcomes in disadvantaged areas, 
first they need the data and the evidence to support it. EHK 
can be an instrument to raise awareness about health issues
