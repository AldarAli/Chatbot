Abstract—In this paper, we present a spatial motion planner in 
3D environments based on Deep Reinforcement Learning 
(DRL) algorithms. We tackle 3D motion planning problem by 
using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach, which 
learns agent’s and environment constraints. Spatial analysis 
focus on visibility analysis in 3D setting an optimal motion 
primitive considering agent’s dynamic model based on fast and 
exact visibility analysis for each motion primitives. Based on 
optimized reward function, consisting of generated 3D 
visibility analysis and obstacle avoidance trajectories, we 
introduce DRL formulation which learns the value function of 
the planner and generates an optimal spatial visibility 
trajectory. We demonstrate our planner in simulations for 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in 3D urban environments. 
Our spatial analysis is based on a fast and exact spatial 
visibility analysis of the 3D visibility problem from a viewpoint 
in 3D urban environments. We present DRL architecture 
generating the most visible trajectory in a known 3D urban 
environment model, as time-optimal one with obstacle 
avoidance capability.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Spatial clustering in urban environments is a new spatial 
field from trajectory planning aspects [1]. The motion and 
trajectory planning fields have been extensively studied over 
the last two decades [2][4][6]. The main effort has focused 
on finding a collision-free path in static or dynamic 
environments, i.e., in moving or static obstacles, using 
roadmap, cell decomposition, and potential field methods 
[11]. 
The efficient computation of visible surfaces and 
volumes in 3D environments is not a trivial task. The 
visibility problem has been extensively studied over the last 
twenty years, due to the importance of visibility in GIS and 
Geomatics, computer graphics and computer vision, and 
robotics. Accurate visibility computation in 3D environments 
is a very complicated task demanding a high computational 
effort, which could hardly have been done in a very short 
time using traditional well-known visibility methods.  
In this paper, we present, unique spatial trajectory 
planning method based on DRL algorithm based on exact 
visibility analysis in urban environment. The generated 
trajectories are based on visibility motion primitives as part 
of the planned trajectory, which takes into account exact 3D 
visible volumes analysis clustering in urban environments. 
The proposed planner includes obstacle avoidance 
capabilities, satisfying dynamics' and kinematics' agent 
model constraints in 3D environments, using Velocity 
Obstacles (VO) in 3D for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) 
model.  
In the following sections, we first introduce the DRL 
algorithm and method and our extension for a spatial 
analysis case, such as 3D visibility. Later on, we present the 
our planner, using VO method and planner model. In the last 
part of the paper, with planner simulation using DRL 
method.

This problem seems to be solved by conventional 
geometric methods, but as mentioned before, it demands a 
long computation time. We introduce a fast and efficient 
computation solution for a schematic structure of an urban 
environment that demonstrates our method based on DRL. 
On the first part, we present DRL algorithm, formulated 
to our planning problem, and the visibility analysis along 
with obstacles avoidance planner.

III. 
DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (DRL)  
In most Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems, 
the state is basically agent’s observation of the environment. 
At any given state, the agent chooses its action according to a 
policy. Hence, a policy is a road map for the agent, which 
determines the action to take at each state. Once the agent 
takes an action, the environment returns the new state and 
the immediate reward. Then, the agent uses this information, 
together with the discount factor to update its internal 
understanding of the environment, which, in our case, is 
accomplished by updating a value function. Most methods 
are using the use well-known simple and efficient greedy 
exploration method maximizing Q-value. 
In case of velocity planning space as part of spatial 
analysis planning, each possible action is a possible velocity 
in the next time step, that also represent a viewpoint. The Q-
value function is based on greedy search velocity, with 
greedy local search method. Based on that, TD and SARSA 
methods for DRL can be used, generating visible trajectory 
in 3D urban environment. 
 
A. Markov Decision Processes (MDP) 
The standard Reinforcement Learning set-up can be 
described as a MDP   as can be seen in Figure 1, consisting 
of: 
• 
A finite set of states S, comprising all possible 
representations of the environment. 
• 
A finite set of actions A, containing all possible 
actions available to the agent at any given time. 
• 
A reward function R = ψ(st ,at ,st+1), determining 
the immediate reward of performing an action at 
from a state st, resulting in st+1. 
• 
A transition model T(st , at , st+1) = p(st+1| st ,at), 
describing the probability of transition between 
states st and st+1when performing an action at. 
 
Figure 1. standard Reinforcement Learning Methology [20].  
B. Temporal Difference Learning  
Temporal-difference learning (or TD) interpolates ideas 
from Dynamic Programming (DP) and Monte Carlo 
methods. TD algorithms can learn directly from raw 
experiences without any model of the environment.  
Whether in Monte Carlo methods, an episode needs to 
reach completion to update a value function, Temporal-
difference learning can learn (update) the value function 
within each experience (or step). The price paid for being 
able to regularly change the value function is the need to 
update estimations based on other learnt estimations 
(recalling DP ideas). Whereas in DP a model of the 
environment’s dynamic is needed, both Monte Carlo and TD 
approaches are more suitable for uncertain and unpredictable 
tasks.  
Since TD learns from every transition (state, reward, 
action, next state, next reward) there is no need to 
ignore/discount some episodes as in Monte Carlo algorithms. 
 
C. Spatial Planning Using DRL  
In this section, we present DRL approach based on the 
proposed spatial planning method. The spatial planner seeks 
to obtain the trajectory T* that based on visibility motion 
primitives set as part of the planned trajectory, which takes 
into account exact 3D visible volumes analysis clustering in 
urban environments, based on optimizing value function f 
along T.  
The generated trajectories are then represented by a set of 
discrete 
configuration 
points 
T 
= 
{x1,x2,··· 
,xN}. 
Without loss of generality, we can assume that the value 
function for each point can be expressed as a linear 
combination of a set of sub-value functions, that will be 
called features c(x) = ∑ cj fj(x). The cost of path T is then 
the sum of the cost for all points in the path. Particularly, in 
the Velocity Obstacles as will be presented later on, the 
value is the sum of the sub-values of moving between pairs 
of states in the path: 
 
          (2) 
 
Based on number of demonstration trajectories D, D = 
{ζ1,ζ2,··· ,ζD}, by using DRL, weights ω can be set for 
learning from demonstrations and setting similar planning 
behavior. As was shown by [23][24], this similarity is 
achieved when the expected value of the features for the 
trajectories generated by the planner is the same as the 
expected value of the features for the given demonstrated 
trajectories: 
                        (3) 
     Applying the Maximum Entropy Principle [25] to the 
DRL problem leads to the following form for the probability 
density for the trajectories returned by the demonstrator: 
                           (4)

where Z(ω) is a normalization function that does not depend 
on ζ. One way to determine ω is maximizing the (log-) 
likelihood of the demonstrated trajectories under the 
previous model: 
L(D|ω) = −Dlog(Z(ω))        +∑
 (−𝑤𝑇𝑓(𝜁𝑖))
𝐷
𝑖=1
      (5) 
    
The gradient of the previous log-likelihood with respect to 
ω is given by [23]: 
       (6) 
      As mentioned in [23], this gradient in equation (6) can 
be intuitively explained. If the value of one of the features 
for the trajectories returned by the planner are higher from 
the value in the demonstrated trajectories, the corresponding 
weight should be increased to increase the value of those 
trajectories. 
     The main problem with the computation of the previous 
gradient is that it requires to compute the expected value of 
the features E(f(ζ)) for the generative distribution (4).  
     We suggest setting large amount of D cased, setting the 
relative w values for our planner characters.

UAV MODEL 
We introduce an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) model, 
based on the well-known simple car and Dubins airplane 
[26]. Dubins airplane [27] model extends Dubins car model 
with continuous change of altitude without reverse gear, 
avoiding sudden altitude speed rate variation. Our UAV 
model includes kinematic and dynamic constraints which 
ignore pitch and roll rotation or winds disturbances.  
A. Kinematic Constraints 
We use a simple UAV model with four dimensions, each 
configuration is
( , , , )
q
= x y z 
, when 
, ,
x y z  are the 
coordinates of the origin, and   is the orientation, in x-y 
plane relative to x-axis, as can be seen in Figure 2 for a 
simple car-like model. 
The steering angle is denoted as  . The distance 
between front and rear axles is equal to 1. The kinematic 
equations of a simple UAV model can be written as:

DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (DRL) PLANNER 
Our planner, as described in Table 1, based on DRL method, 
generate visible sequence of optimal-visible waypoints as a 
candidate trajectory. We extend previous planners which 
takes into account kinematic and dynamic constraints 
[29,30] and present a local planner for UAV with these 
constraints, which for the first time generates fast and exact 
visible trajectories based on analytic solution. The fast and

efficient visibility analysis of our method presented above, 
allows us to generate the most visible trajectory from a start 
state to the goal state in 3D urban environments, and 
demonstrates our capability, which can be extended to real 
performances in the future. We assume knowledge of the 
3D urban environment model and use the well-known 
Velocity Obstacles (VO) method to avoid collision with 
buildings presented as static obstacles.  
For obstacle avoidance capability, at each time step, the 
planner computes the next eighth Attainable Velocities 
(AV). The safe nodes not colliding with buildings, i.e., 
nodes outside Velocity Obstacles [28], are explored. The 
planner computes the cost for these safe nodes and chooses 
the node with the lowest cost. Trajectory can be 
characterized by the most visible roofs only, surfaces only, 
or another combination of these kinds of visibility types. We 
repeat this procedure while generating the most visible 
trajectory. 
A. Velocity Obstacles 
The VO [28] is a well-known method for obstacle 
avoidance in static and dynamic environments, used in our 
planner to prevent collision between UAV and the buildings 
(as static obstacles), as part of the trajectory planning 
method. 
The VO represents the set of all colliding velocities of 
the UAV with each of the neighboring obstacles, in our case 
static obstacles as can be seen in Figure 3 and Figure 4.  
Based on the dynamic and kinematic constraints, UAVs 
velocities at the next time step are limited. At each time step 
during the trajectory planning, we map the Attainable 
Velocities (AV), the velocities set at the next time step 
t
+
, which generate the optimal trajectory, as is well-
known from Dubins theory [27].

Considering the extremals controllers as part of the

by computing a set of Velocity Obstacles (VO).  
In Figure 4, nodes inside VO, marked in red, are 
inadmissible. Nodes out of VO are further evaluated; safe 
nodes are colored in blue. The safe node with the lowest 
cost, which is the next most visible node, is explored in the 
next time step. This is repeated while generating the most 
visible trajectory. 
Admissible velocities profile is similar to a trunked cake 
slice, as seen in Figure 4, due to the Dubins airplane model 
with one time step integration ahead. Simple models 
admissible velocities, such as point mass, create rectangular 
profile [28].

Our search is guided by minimum invisible parts from 
viewpoint V to the 3D urban environment model. The cost

C. Planner Neural Network 
In our DRL model, we are using fully-connected layers, 
consisting of: the state space of 37 dimensions, two hidden 
layers (64 nodes each), an output of four actions. Our 
network structure can be seen in Figure 5.
