Abstract—Modeling for wireless sensor networks is very 
challenging 
because 
the 
modeling 
needs 
to 
adapt 
network dynamics and find out multiple optimizing paths from 
the microscopic point of view. In this paper, we propose a 
cellular automata model that focuses on dynamic network 
topology, multipath data transmission mechanism and energy 
overhead. Each node in a network is represented by a cell, and 
any permutations and combinations that represent any links 
between two cells constitute the cellular space. A wireless 
sensor network is modeled by related cell states and 
cell evolution rule. A cell transmission model is derived 
for multipath transmission of information. All these aim to 
ensure network reliability with the minimum resource 
requirements. Presented analytical work is proved validly by 
simulations.

 INTRODUCTION  
With rapid development of the Internet of Things (IOTs) 
[1], Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [2] play an more and 
more pivotal role in bridging the gap between the physical 
and virtual worlds, which can enable things to respond to 
changes in their physical environment. Therefore, with 
WSNs technology improving, a new model that could adapt 
various application environments is needed to describe 
characteristics and goals of WSNs exactly. Concerning IOTs, 
the model must be applied to a wide range of WSNs. 
Tarik et al., [3] analyze some methods about WSNs 
modeling, and currently, these models have been explored  
with different features. It examines this emerging field to 
classify wireless micro-sensor networks according to 
different communication functions, data delivery models, 
and network dynamics. A service-centric model focuses on 
services provided by a WSN and views a WSN as a service 
provider [4]. The service-centric model only provides a 
holistic approach to measuring and presenting WSNs 
effectiveness. 
There 
is 
no 
description 
from 
the 
microscopic point of view in this model. The methodology 
for the modeling and the worst-case dimensioning of cluster-
tree WSNs shows the fundamental performance limits of 
cluster-tree WSNs [5]. Although it presents a general and 
flexible framework, the node function in such model is 
hierarchical. The Cluster Head nodes that are used for 
transmitting data packets will consume more energy. Then 
nodes inequality will reduce the network life systematically. 
Yet some routing protocols use another model that is based 
on data-centric [6], and this model depends on data 
identifiers and specified locations, therefore, it isn’t 
appropriate to the dynamic and randomly-deployed WSNs, 
and it have no strong convergence.  
Cellular automata (CA) is the dynamical system that 
evolves in the discrete time dimension according to 
some local rules, which is essentially defined in a cell space 
constituted of cells with discrete and finite state [7][8]. The 
composition of cellular automata is shown in Fig. 1.

In this paper, a cellular automata modeling view is 
proposed for WSNs. Our basic goal and idea are to ensure 
WSNs continuing 
and effective 
work 
by 
using some 
simple parameters, connection 
and operation 
rules, 
and 
finally simulate complex and rich applications of WSNs.                   
Such 
a 
model does 
not 
only 
guarantee equality 
of nodes within 
the 
network, and 
ensure the 
energy 
balance distribution, but also guarantee strong convergence 
under conditions of dynamic network topology. It provides a 
flexible multipath data transmission mechanism to ensure 
network reliability. Just as importantly, the cellular automata 
model describes WSNs characteristics from the microscopic 
point of view.   
The remaining organization of the paper is as follows. 
Section II presents the cellular automata model, which 
includes network model and data traffic model. Section III 
provides a simulation analysis based on this cellular 
automata model. Finally, Section IV concludes the paper and 
proposes the future work.

THE CELLULAR AUTOMATA MODEL FOR WSNS 
 WSNs have many challenges compared with traditional 
wireless networks, and communication in WSNs differs from

that in other types of networks. More specifically, WSNs 
energy is often limited since it is impossible to recharge 
sensor nodes if the networks are deployed in the 
uninhabited areas. This paper uses the following models to 
evaluate 
the performance of WSNs, including the 
dynamic network topology and data transmission reliability, 
and 
finally 
realize energy 
saving 
and 
prolong 
networks lifetime, which could keep the model practicality 
and simplicity.  
A. Network model 
In order to describe the model better, the following 
definitions are given firstly. 
Definition 1: The set of all the nodes C = {c1, c2, … , cn}, 
Then  any permutations and combinations L in set C 
constitute the cellular space, where L = {Lk = (c1, … , ci, … , 
cj, … cn)| ci, cj∈C, ci≠cj, i, j = 1, 2, … , n, k∈Z}, and each 
node is a cell (The cellular space is a two-dimensional grid).  
Definition 2: Let S represents limited and discrete states 
set of cells, where S = {s1, s2, s3}, s1: information 
transmission state, s2: wait state, s3: idle state, and three 
states represent three types of cells respectively: center 
cell(CC), neighbor cell(NC) and idle cell(IC). 
Definition 3: Let N represents cell link neighborhood, 
where N = {Lk*|difference(Lk1 - Lk2)≤d, Lk1, Lk2∈Lk}, 
difference(Lk1 - Lk2) is the difference between two 
permutations and combinations, d is the degree of difference. 
Fig. 2 shows the relationship diagram of cell parameters. 
Cell [52] has eight cell neighbors, including cell [44], cell 
[45], cell [46], cell [51], cell [53], cell [58], cell [59], cell 
[60]. When cell [52] requires communication with cell [0], 
the state of cell [52] is s1, its neighbors’ states are s2, and 
cells out of this local space keep idle state. As shown in Fig. 
2, the difference of two links Lk1 and Lk2 between cell [44] 
and cell [0] represent link neighborhood.   
 
 
Figure. 2  The relationship diagram of cell parameters 
Based on above definitions, the paper uses the 
following rule to update model in parallel.

S
F S
: 
Step 1: Initialize the parameters and define cell state,  
C = {c1, c2, … , cn}, S = {s1, s2, s3}. 
Step 2: Assuming that In is the number of idle cells, Nn is 
the number of neighbor cells, then determine the 
next hop link by judging the states of different 
types of cell. 
 Case (1): If CC has In idle cells(ICs) around(In≤6), it 
forwards the data packets to the next hop by 
cell transmission model(described in the next 
section), which uses an IC.  
Case (2): If CC has no ICs but has Nn neighbor cell(NCs) 
around, it forwards the data packets to the 
next hop by cell transmission model, which 
uses a NC. 
Case (3): If CC has no ICs and NCs around, that is, 
its neighbor 
cells are 
all 
in information 
transmission state, then this CC stores the data 
packets into the cache, and once it receives 
cell release message, it chooses this cell to 
forward the data packets.  
Step 3: With the dynamic changes in topology, establish 
a number of transmission links, and use  
                N = {Lk*|difference(Lk1 - Lk2)≤d, Lk1, Lk2∈Lk} 
to compare neighborhood of links, then choose the 
most effective link 
for 
related 
information 
transmission.  
Step 4: Update link, store the multiple link information.   
The network model is  constructed by cellular automata. 
The aim of this cellular automata model is to group cell 
nodes that have similar processing needs into unit cell 
families and sink node that meet these needs into each cell in 
the network. 
B. Cell dynamic rate 
To verify convergence of the model in a dynamic 
environment better, this paper defines the concept of cell 
dynamic rate that is represented by
n
 , and using simulation 
tool OMNeT++, we identify the range of the dynamic rate
n
 . 
The dynamic rate is defined as follow: 
Definition 4: the dynamic rate 
n
  represents average 
moving rate of all the cells in cellular space. In addition, let 
n
  express dynamic topological properties of cellular space. 
OMNeT++ is an object-oriented modular discrete event 
network simulation framework. It has a generic architecture, 
OMNeT++ itself is not a simulator of anything concrete, but 
it rather provides infrastructure and tools for writing 
simulations.  
One of the fundamental ingredients of this infrastructure 
is a component architecture for simulation models. We use 
wireless network simulator model by OMNeT++, where 
network protocol is IEEE 802.15.4. In this paper, we only 
consider the two-dimensional space situation, therefore, 
cells are laid out randomly in a 50m×50m two-dimensional 
area, and the cell network topology schematic diagram is 
illustrated in Fig. 3.

The mobile model of cells is random waypoint mobility. 
The paper verifies the WSNs allowable dynamic range by 
simulation experiments, and 
n
  is divided into four cases, 
as shown in Table I. When

, it is divided into three levels. According to 
different
n
 , we give networks convergence time step in 
different networks scales. From Fig. 4, as 
n
  varying, the 
network set-up time of the cellular space is almost no 
differences in the same network size. Also with increasing 
of the network size, the network set-up time has increased a 
little. Therefore, we come to the conclusion that the cellular 
automata model in the dynamic case for WSNs has better 
convergence.

C. Cell transmission model 
The following assumptions are adopted for simplifying 
the model: 
 
Communication radius of the center cell (CC) is 
its six neighbor cells. 
 
Except Sink cell, each cell has the same initial 
energy. 
 
Communication is symmetric. 
 
Each cell keeps static or movement according to the 
dynamic rate
n
 . 
For facilitating the model description, we define the 
following variables: 
fl :data frame length; 
lc :channel length; 
ve:transmission rate of electromagnetic waves in the  
channel;  
vi(t) :data rate of the cell i at time t; 
Di,j :time delay, from cell i to cell j; 
Bi,j :highest data rate in unit time that could be reached 
from cell i to cell j; 
qi,max(t) :max upstream data flow of the cell i at time t;  
hi,j :hops, from cell i to cell j; 
ni,j :the number of links, from cell i to cell j. 
In order to describe flow relationship between CC and 
neighbor cells, firstly, the metrics delay that we consider 
mainly between two cells can be formulated as  
                                    Di,j = dt + dp                                                    (1) 
where dt is transmission delay, dp is propagation delay. 
Typically, we have  
                                    dt = fl / vi(t)                                   (2) 
                                   dp = lc / ve                                                         (3) 
Secondly we consider another metrics delay-bandwidth 
product,

It represents the number of bits that this cellular link could 
accommodate. Thirdly, the data flow direction is divided 
into upstream and downstream. Normally, most event-
driven messages in WSNs are forwarded from individual 
cell to the sink in upstream direction, thus in this paper we 
focus on the max upstream data flow of cell i at time t , 
qi,max(t). Therefore, based on vi(t),  and qi,max(t), we define 
maximum carrying capacity of cell i, Ni, and we have  
                     Ni = balance { vi(t), , qi,max(t)}                (5) 
Then each CC determines the next link by comparing Ni 
value among the neighbor cells. 
We consider

Given 
such 
a 
cell 
transmission 
model, 
we 
address multipath transmission of the information for WSNs 
compared with other forwarding strategy [9], and aim to 
ensure the network reliability with the minimum resource 
requirements.

SIMULATION RESULTS 
Setting 60 sensor nodes and a sink node in an area of 
50m×50m to certify the effectiveness of the network model, 
where the simulation setting parameters are shown as Table 
II.We use IEEE 802.15.4 as the Physical layer and Data link 
layer protocol. The maximum datagram size of each cell is 
127-bytes.The maximum transmission distance that cells 
can be reached is 12m, and the network range is 
50m×50m.In addition, data flow style is CBR.

The simulation results is verified by three models, which 
is including service-centric model (SCM) [4], cluster model 
(CM) [5], and our cellular automata model (CAM). SCM 
focuses on services provided by a WSN and views a WSN 
as a service provider. A WSN is modeled at different levels 
of abstraction. For each level, a set of services and a set of 
metrics are defined. Services and their interfaces are defined 
in a formal way to facilitate automatic composition of 
services, and enable interoperability and multitasking of 
WSNs at the different levels. CM provide a fine model of 
the worst-case cluster-tree topology characterized by its 
depth, the maximum number of child routers and the 
maximum number of child nodes for each parent router.  
The 
first 
experiment 
is 
the 
comparison 
of models conver- gence. We apply the classical LEACH 
(Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) [10] protocol 
to CM and CAM. Fig. 5 shows the simulation result of 
convergence, which is measured by the metrics of 
Energy*Delay 
[11] 
with 
changing 
of 
time 
step. 
Energy*Delay model, introduces a great energy-effective 
solution to the communication from source nodes to 
destination nodes and significantly simplifies the topology 
of networks. From the research and simulation results that 
described in [11], an significant effect on determining the 
increment of pheromones by minimizing the Energy*Delay 
model was obtained.  
In the initial stage, there is a huge fluctuation about the 
metrics of Energy*Delay in the CAM, CM and SCM, this 
becauses the initiation of cellular automatas. After such 
processing, the Energy*Delay tends to a fixed value. As 
shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b), CAM gradually converges to 10, 
however, CM gradually converge to 80. In addition, as we 
known that, SCM is a macro-model, then from Fig. 5 (c), 
we can find that SCM has a huge fluctuation almostly all the 
time by the metrics of Energy*Delay, so it has the worst 
convergence during three models. Therefore, it is concluded 
that CAM that use cellular automata scheme has better 
convergence performance than CM and SCM.

Secondly, we simulate the network on different models 
for comparing the number of paths between two cells. From 
Fig. 6, CAM take less time to forward the data packets 
through the network than the other two models. The reason is 
that CAM has the characteristic of multi-path transmission 
by cells auto selection method. And as shown in Fig. 6, 
althought CAM finds less paths in local time slot, the 
tendency of finding more paths about CAM is increasing 
step by step compared with the other two models. 
 
  
Figure. 6  Paths Comparison of Models 
Finally, Fig. 7 presents the overhead results of the three 
models in dynamic environment described in Section II. A 
global analysis shows that CAM gives the best performance 
with the increasing of the dynamic rate
n
 , which is almost 
independent of
n
 . This is because that CAM uses the 
cellular evolution rules to optimize the network formation 
process, and decrease the number of messages exchange. 
 
 
 Figure. 7  Overhead Comparison of Models 
All these simulation results ensure network reliability 
with the minimum resource requirements by the cellular 
automata model. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, a cellular automata model is devised for 
WSNs application research. The key issues considered in this 
model 
are 
dynamic network 
topology 
struture, 
multipath data transmission, and WSNs network energy   
efficient. Simulation 
results 
by 
the 
comparison 
of 
convergence, multi-path transmission and overhead, verify 
the effectiveness of the related work. 
 However, there are much uncertainty for popularization 
of the IOTs, and many technical aspects based on WSNs that 
need to be broken through [12]. In the future work, we plan 
to apply this model to research WSNs routing algorithm and 
time synchronization strategy for solving WSNs localization 
problems [13] [14]. Moreover, these researches will provide 
a foundation that achieves the integration between WSNs 
and Internet of things.
