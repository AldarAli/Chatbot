Abstract—In this study, a method by which progression stages 
of venous disorders can be detected using the near-infrared 
vein images is proposed. For this purpose, the superficial vein 
surveillance system, which was developed within the scope of 
the ongoing doctoral thesis, was re-trained to find the 
telangiectasia and varicose vein patterns in the images. The 
trainings were carried out using the You Only Look Once 
version 3 (YOLOv3) object detection algorithm. Confidence 
values of 0.90 and above were achieved in object detection 
experiments performed with artificial telangiectasia and 
varicose vein patterns. According to the test results, the 
developed system can detect Chronic Venous Disorder patterns 
with Accuracy Rate (1), Misclassification Rate (0), Precision 
(1), Prevalence (0.5) and F-Score (1) values. With this system, 
the patient and physician will be informed about the 
development of venous disorders at an early stage and a pre-
diagnosis data will be created for the physician. 
Keywords - vein imaging; near-infrared light; telangiectasia;

 INTRODUCTION 
Medical imaging devices are one of the primary auxiliary 
methods used in hospitals to diagnose different diseases. The 
devices used in this context work on the basis of visualizing 
the area to be viewed with light or sound waves. Imaging 
with light is carried out by utilizing different wavelengths in 
the electromagnetic spectrum. Medical imaging devices 
currently in use are classified according to the body tissue 
they can monitor and the effects of the light used to 
illuminate the area of interest on the body. While the X-Ray 
device, which emits harmful rays (ionizing radiation) to the 
body, is dominantly used in the imaging of bone tissue and 
abdominal diseases, Computed Tomography is used for 
imaging both bone tissue and internal organs [1]-[3]. In 
addition, Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides imaging of 
tissues with magnetic waves, whereas Ultrasound uses high-
frequency sound waves for imaging [1][2]. 
Although technology advances at a dizzying pace, many 
lives are still lost due to late detection of diseases that can be 
easily cured if detected earlier. Despite the efforts to increase 
the awareness of early diagnosis for all kinds of diseases, 
modern people do not abandon the habit of going to the 
doctor after the disease occurs and often neglect routine 
controls. In these omissions, the concern of triggering other 
diseases by imaging devices working with harmful rays to 
the body during controls has a large share. However, 
currently developing technology techniques give a chance to 
produce harmless alternatives to detect some diseases early. 
Among them, varicose disease, which is one of the vascular 
diseases and caused by the enlargement of the veins close to 
the skin surface (i.e., superficial veins), can be counted. 
Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
techniques can be used for vein imaging [2]. However, both 
the negative effects of these devices on human health and 
their high costs limit their use to hospital environments only. 
In addition, although the ultrasound device, which provides 
visualization of blood flow [1][2], is harmless to the body, it 
has a high cost and can generally be used and interpreted by 
radiologists in hospitals. Near-infrared light, which is a type 
of light that is harmless to the body, is used in hospitals 
within the scope of superficial vein imaging, especially 
during vascular access procedures. 
The main advantage of near-infrared light in the scope of 
vein imaging is that photons of this type of light can be 
absorbed by hemoglobin molecules in the vein [4]-[6]. In 
this way, the veins in the tissue area illuminated with near-
infrared light of a certain wavelength (in the studies carried 
out in [5]-[7], a wavelength of 850 nm was used, which 
usually gives optimum results) can be viewed with a camera 
having the same wavelength filter. In this way, the 
visualization of the superficial veins can be easily performed 
with only the light source and the camera (even an ordinary 
camera can be turned into a simple near-infrared camera by 
changing the filter on it). By applying digital image 
processing filters on the obtained near-infrared image, some 
improvements can be made on the image. In this way, the 
edges of the veins can be sharpened, only the relevant vein 
patterns can be revealed by eliminating the surrounding 
tissues or the noise in the image can be removed. Processed 
near-infrared vascular images can be used for many different 
purposes from disease pre-diagnosis to biometric recognition 
[8]-[11]. For these purposes, deep learning techniques (such 
as classification or object detection/recognition) are applied 
on images. 
The system, which was prepared within the scope of the 
ongoing doctoral study (near-infrared images of the right and 
left forearms were used) and which enables the superficial

veins (in the near-infrared images) to be visualized as an e-
health application in the home environment, was retrained in 
this study to monitor the vein enlargement. In this study, the 
vein enlargement patterns in the images are detected by the 
object detection algorithm. In addition, two artificial datasets 
(representing vein enlargements) to be used in training and 
testing of the YOLOv3 object detection algorithm [12] were 
created. 
In Section 2, venous disorder stages are introduced and 
the re-trained YOLOv3 algorithm is explained so that the 
system can detect vein enlargement. How the datasets were 
created and the results obtained as a result of the trials are 
also stated in this section. In the last section, the study is 
discussed in general terms. 
II. 
VEIN ENLARGEMENT DETECTION: YOLOV3 
ALGORITHM  
Near-infrared imaging system is basically examined in 
two parts as hardware and software. While the hardware part 
is about the wavelength of the light source, Light Emitting 
Diode (LED) placements and camera features, the software 
part covers the extraction of vein patterns by making the 
veins in the obtained near-infrared images more prominent 
via digital image processing techniques. In this way, 
superficial veins can be visualized. The hardware part and 
digital image processing steps of this ongoing doctoral study 
were introduced in [10]. Also, the presentation of narrowing 
detections in processed images (using the YOLOv3 
algorithm with a single class as stenosis_vein) to patients and 
physicians as a video-based indirect augmented reality 
environment was explained in [11]. In this study, the 
visualization of enlargements in superficial vein images is 
discussed. 
When the valves of the superficial veins do not work 
properly, blood accumulations occur, and as a result, the 
veins expand and elongate, and form twisted folds, resulting 
in varicose veins [13][14]. Although varicose veins are most 
commonly observed in leg veins (which are under more 
pressure than other veins [13]), varicose veins can be 
encountered in every part of the body [15]. In general, 
however, the development of vascular disease in hand veins 
does not give results as dramatic as in leg veins. Chronic 
Venous Disorders (CVDs) affecting millions of people 
worldwide are caused by morphological and functional 
abnormalities of the venous system [16][17]. Risk factors, 
such as heredity (family history, height), lifestyle (long term 
standing/sitting, occupation, smoking), gain (age, pregnancy, 
obesity, deep vein thrombosis) or hormones (female gender, 
progesterone) can lead to venous disorders, such as vein 
enlargement [18][19]. CVD clinical stages are defined by the 
CEAP 
(Clinical, 
Etiological, 
Anatomical 
and 
Pathophysiological [16]) classification system: C0 (no 
visible signs of venous disease), C1 (visible veins, 
telangiectasia/spider veins), C2 (varicose veins), C3 
(swelling/edema), C4 (changes to skin quality), C5 (healed 
ulceration), C6 (active ulceration) [17][20]. CVD is often 
overlooked in its early stages [16]. In case of early diagnosis, 
advanced symptoms, such as edema, skin changes or leg 
ulcers can be alleviated with the support of lifestyle changes 
[17][19]. The incidence of vascular disorders in adults in 
urban and rural Bonn area is 59% for telangiectasia vein and 
14% for varicose vein, respectively [17]. 
As most superficial veins, varicose veins are also not 
easily visible to the naked eye, so near-infrared light is used 
to visualize these veins [21]. In this study, the hand vein 
dataset obtained with the superficial vein surveillance system 
developed within the scope of the ongoing doctoral study 
was used for the trials of the YOLOv3 algorithm, which was 
re-trained to detect CVD in the C1 (telangiectasia/spider 
veins) and C2 (varicose veins) stages. An example image 
from the dataset and its processed version are given in Fig. 1.

The YOLOv3 is a deep learning algorithm that performs 
object detection. With object detection algorithms, training 
can be performed for multiple objects (up to 80 classes [12] 
placed at certain locations on the image) that can represent 
different classes. In this study, the YOLOv3 algorithm was 
used for CVD detection in vein patterns obtained by image 
processing steps. The developed near-infrared imaging 
system was retrained in this study to detect CVD progression 
using two separate classes (spider_vein and varicose_vein). 
There is currently no venous disorder dataset consisting 
of near-infrared images, available to the public. For this, a 
two-class training dataset was prepared (The dataset was 
created by the method of obtaining images from the video 
recordings described in the study [11]) by adding artificial 
66

spider_vein and varicose_vein patterns on the near-infrared 
images. In this context, 5 spider_vein and 5 varicose_vein 
patterns were added onto 150 near-infrared images. 
Furthermore, 50 additional images were created from the 
existing images by data augmentation methods (10 degrees 
rotation, 30 degrees rotation, mirroring, noise addition and 
downscaling). In this way, an artificial training dataset 
containing 1000 spider_vein and 1000 varicose_vein patterns 
was obtained. The patterns in the images were labelled with 
the free (under General Public License version 3) makesense 
[22] web-based application.  
A second dataset consisting of 300 images containing 
artificial vein enlargement patterns was prepared for the test 
process to be carried out after the trainings. The dataset was 
created by adding only a single spider_vein or varicose_vein 
pattern to each image in random rotations and locations 
(maintaining a certain figural format). In this way, 150 test 
images containing the spider_vein class and 150 test images 
containing the varicose_vein class were obtained. The 
confusion matrix of the object detection results of the 
YOLOv3 algorithm, obtained using the test dataset, is given 
in Table 1. As can be seen from the matrix, all of the 
searched objects (spider_vein and varicose_vein patterns) in 
the test images were detected correctly. The developed 
system can detect CVD patterns in C1 and C2 stages with 
Accuracy Rate (1), Misclassification Rate (0), Precision (1), 
Prevalence (0.5) and F-Score (1) values. 
The YOLOv3 algorithm marks the locations of the 
objects detected onto the image with bounding boxes. In 
addition, the name of the class with the highest probability 
and the detection rate (confidence value is shown between 
0.00 and 1.00 in the study) are printed on the box. 
Two sample result images of the YOLOv3 algorithm test 
process (venous disorder detection with confidence value of 
0.99 for spider_vein and 0.90 for varicose_vein classes) are 
shown in Fig. 2. 
Although all classes in the test images were predicted 
correctly, the YOLOv3 algorithm had a lower confidence 
value for some patterns. Among 150 images containing 
spider_vein patterns, 130 had a confidence value in the range 
of 0.95-1.00, 13 in the range of 0.90-0.94, 6 in the range of 
0.80-0.89, and 1 of them was determined as 0.32. When the 
pattern with the confidence value of 0.32 is examined, it is 
determined that it is not much different from the patterns in 
the training dataset (mostly large-sized patterns were used) 
or other test patterns, but it is smaller in size, as can be seen 
in Fig. 3. It was evaluated that this situation may result in a 
low confidence value.

range of 0.79-0.30. When the 7 patterns with the lowest 
confidence values are examined, it is determined that these 
patterns are slightly different (U-shaped, twisted) from the 
patterns in the training dataset or other test patterns (mostly 
linear line patterns were used) which can be seen in Fig. 4. It 
was evaluated that this condition may lead to a low 
confidence value.

fold (may not follow a linear line) over time, such patterns 
are important in the detection system. Therefore, in order to 
overcome the low confidence values of spider_vein and 
varicose_vein classes, smaller-sized patterns and new 
patterns in different rotations (U-shaped) will be added to the 
training dataset as part of the future work. 
III. 
CONCLUSION 
In this study, it was investigated how the superficial vein 
surveillance system, which was prepared within the scope of 
the ongoing doctoral study, could be expanded to detect vein 
enlargement. The study is based on superficial vein imaging 
by using near-infrared light which is harmless to the body. 
The YOLOv3 algorithm was used to detect Chronic Venous 
Disorder patterns in the near-infrared images obtained. 
According to the test results obtained with artificial patterns 
including spider_vein and varicose_vein classes, confidence 
values of 0.90 and above were achieved in object detection. 
The developed system could perform object detection of the 
related classes with Accuracy Rate (1), Misclassification 
Rate (0), Precision (1), Prevalence (0.5) and F-Score (1) 
values. In this way, a system in which the development of 
Chronic Venous Disorder can be followed within the scope 
of pre-diagnosis has been created. It is vital to inform the 
doctor about the possibility of the detected telangiectasia 
vein turning into a varicose vein. In this way, it will be 
possible to start the treatment without delay. Within the 
scope of future studies, the system will be tested with real 
patient data. Also, the vein enlargement detection feature 
will also be integrated into the superficial vein surveillance 
system that offers video-based indirect augmented reality, 
therefore informing the patient and physician.
