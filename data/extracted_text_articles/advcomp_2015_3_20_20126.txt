Abstract— This paper presents a nondestructive method of
brick wall dampness testing in real building structures and a
new method of testing flood embankment dampness. We used
a setup made of specially built laboratory models to determine
the moisture level of test brick walls and flood embankments.
The topological method and the gradient technique were used
with the optimization approach. The finite element method was
used to solve the forward problem. The proposed algorithm
was initialized by using one step methods and topological
sensitivity analysis. We constructed the forward model and we
solved the inverse problem in order to visualize moisture inside
objects. Practical examples of using the Electrical Impedance
Tomography are also presented.

INTRODUCTION
This paper presents a new method examining the flood
embankment dampness and the brick wall dampness using
the electrical impedance tomography [5][9][10]. Numerical
methods of the shape and the topology optimization were
based on the level set methods [2][3][4] and the gradient
methods [15]. The discussed technique can be applied to the
solution of inverse problems in the electrical impedance
tomography.
New
algorithms
to
identify
unknown
conductivities were implemented. The purpose of the
presented method is to obtain a better image reconstruction
than gradient methods.
One of the major pathologies in historic buildings is the
existence of dampness. Moisture transfer in walls of old
buildings, which are in direct contact with the soil, leads to a
migration of soluble salts responsible for many building
problems. Building porous materials (e.g., brick or concrete),
both natural and manufactured, have pores (like a sponge)
and the moisture can be pulled up against gravity (capillary
effect). Figure 1 shows an example of a damp historical wall.
The dampness raising from the soil is a problem in old
buildings, especially without adequate horizontal and vertical
insulation of foundations. The moisture creates a danger not
only to the walls, but also to human health. It promotes
progress of rheumatic disorders and formation of fungus on
the walls. Fungus can cause allergies and many other
diseases.
There
are
many
different
drainage
systems
(watertight barriers, injection of hydrofuge products, etc.).
Regardless
of
the
method,
it
is
very
important
to
continuously monitor the status of dampness during the
drying process. In the case of historical buildings of great
cultural importance, the use of destructive measurements is
prohibited
by
conservation
specialists.
The
traditional
techniques used to deal with this kind of problem proved to
be ineffective, justifying the need to find a new approach [1].

historical buildings.
Numerical methods of shape and topology optimization
methods were based on the level set representation and the
shape differentiation and there were topology changes
possible during the optimization process [11][12]. Level set
methods have been applied very successfully in many areas
of the scientific modelling, for example in propagating fronts
and interfaces [6][7][8]. Therefore, they are used to study
shape optimization problems. Instead of using the physically
driven velocity, the level set method typically moves the
surfaces by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (2). These
approaches based on shape sensitivity include the boundary
design of elastic.
In Section II, we present some information about
electrical impedance tomography. Section III discusses

models of numerical methods. Section IV shows the
numerical results and the paper concludes in Section V.

ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE TOMOGRAPHY
The Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a
technique of imaging the distribution of conductivity inside
the tested object from measurements of the distribution of
potentials on the object’s surface. In Figure 2, the object is a
brick wall with dampness rising from the ground.
The
test
results
obtained
by
the
nondestructive
impedance tomography method are compared with the
results obtained by numerical simulations. We prepared two
prototype measuring systems. One is a low cost EIT
tomography system containing 16 electrodes for measuring
damp brick wall on one side. The second one is a full EIT
system with 32 electrodes for testing on both sides of a wall.
The forward problem in EIT is described by Laplace’s
equation [9]:

MODELS
Nondestructive methods do not require that samples be
taken from the wall, which is their advantage over the
destructive methods.

Figure 3. Surface electrodes on the damp brick wall.
Among the nondestructive methods, the most popular
are electric and nuclear methods, particularly, the electric
resistance method, the dielectric method, the microwave
method, and the neuronal method [1]. But, in the case of
nondestructive
methods,
the
dampness
measuring
instruments must be calibrated in order to determine the
correlation
between
their
indications
and
the
weight
concluded dampness of the tested material. In this paper, the
electrodes can be easily attached to the tested object. The
level set method and the gradient technique were based on
shape and topology optimization to solve the inverse
problem in the electrical impedance tomography. Such task
can be considered as application of the electrical impedance
tomography.

glue. We used an electrical impedance tomography device
with multiplexer to make measurements.
The flood embankment system is given in Figure 4. The
laboratory model (a) presents the measurement system with
multiplexer and 16 electrodes. The discretization model (b)
was based on the finite element method (using to solve the
forward and inverse problem). The first model (c) collects
measurements perpendicularly to the flood embankment. The
second model (d) performs measurements parallel to the
tested object.

NUMERICAL METHODS
Numerical methods of the shape and the topology
optimization were based on the level set representation and
the shape differentiation and were made possible topology
changes during the optimization process.
The motion is seen as the convection of values (levels)
from the function ϕ with the velocity field νr . Such a
process is described by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation [7]:

Here, νr is the desired velocity on the interface, and is
arbitrary elsewhere. Actually, only the normal component of

For the minimization problem, iterative coupling of the level
set method and the topological gradient method have been
proposed. Both methods are gradient-type algorithms, and
the coupled approach can be cast into the framework of
alternate directions descent algorithms. One step methods
and topological algorithms were used to solve this problem.

The test results were obtained by using the EIDORS
software [14] in Figure 5. We prepared two prototype

evolution during an iterative reconstruction process is
achieved by the level set method. The forward problem was
solved by the finite element method. Figure 7 shows the
process of the image reconstruction with the zero level at
initial step is represented by a lot of objects. The picture
shows the original object and the reconstruction after 273
number of iterations. The process of reconstruction seems to
be the correct one, because the region border is located
nearly the real object edges.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
A new nondestructive method of the flood embankment
dampness and the brick wall dampness was tested by the
electrical impedance tomography. Numerical methods of the
shape and the topology optimization were based on the
gradient techniques and the level set representation. The
presented methods have been applied very successfully in
many areas of the scientific modelling. These approaches
were based on sensitivity analysis. An efficient algorithm for
solving the forward and inverse problems would also
improve a lot of the numerical performances of the proposed
methods. In modeling of the problem in the electrical
impedance tomography, it is required to identify unknown
conductivities from near-boundary measurements of the
potential. Future work will be based on an implementation of
artificial
intelligence
algorithms
to
solve
the
inverse
problem.
