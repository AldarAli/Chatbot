Abstract—Seamless 
Handover 
between 
networks 
in 
heterogeneous environment is essential to guarantee end-to-
end QoS for mobile users. A key requirement is the ability to 
select the next best network. Currently, the implementation of 
the IEEE 802.21 standard by National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) considers only the signal strength as a 
parameter to determine the best network. In this paper, we 
propose including additional parameters such as available 
bandwidth, mobile node speed and type of network during 
selecting a new network to improve the QoS for mobile user’s 
application. The results of the experiments that we performed 
using Network Simulator show that there is a need for a new 
framework taking into account these parameters to guide 
network selection process during handover and to provide 
mobile users with QoS guarantee.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Communicating from anywhere at any time is becoming 
a requirement of great importance for mobile users. 
However, the rapid expansion of wireless network 
technologies 
creates 
a 
heterogeneous 
environment. 
Nowadays, mobile users would like to acquire, directly from 
their device, different kinds of services like Internet, audio 
and video conferencing which sometimes require switching 
between different operators. Moreover, user preferences 
differ, some are interested in service costs only; others will 
be satisfied with broadband networks that cover large 
geographic areas, etc. Consequently, to satisfy the above 
requirements, user mobility should be covered by a set of 
different overlapping networks forming a heterogeneous 
environment. Mobile device should be able to choose, from 
all available networks in its environment, the one that meets 
its needs and ensures accordingly the transition from one 
cell to another in the same technology (horizontal handover) 
or between different types of technologies (vertical 
handover). During this period of handover the challenge is 
to conserve the QoS parameters guarantee. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section II describes the background. Section III describes 
the main components of IEEE 802.21 standard and its 
implementation using NS2 simulator. Section IV provides 
an overview of wireless protocols used in our simulation 
environment. Section V describes the simulation scenarios 
and results and we conclude in Section VI. 
II. BACKGROUND 
The IEEE 802.21  [1] is an emerging standard, also 
known as Media Independent Handover (MIH) that supports 
management of seamless handover between different 
networks in a heterogeneous environment. The current 
implementation of the IEEE 802.21 standard for the network 
simulator NS by National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) based on draft 3  [2] [3] considers only 
the signal strength as a unique parameter to determine the 
best network  [4]. We argue in this paper that this parameter 
alone is not sufficient to satisfy user requirement. Indeed, 
signal strength, available bandwidth, traffic on the serving 
network and packet loss ratio are among the other 
parameters that affect the requirement of mobile user in 
terms of QoS guarantee. For example, a bad QoS, when 
using a real time application in a handover process, may be 
due to a lack of available bandwidth because of high load in 
the visited network while the signal strength is good. 
Several attempts have been made to improve the 
handover within the MIH framework. Chandavarkar et al. 
[5] proposed an algorithm for network selection based on 
the energy of the battery, the speed of the mobile, and the 
coverage radius of the network in order to avoid power loss 
during handover and to improve the efficiency of seamless 
handover. Siddiqui et al.  [6] proposed a new algorithm 
named TAILOR that uses different parameters of QoS with 
the user preferences to select the destination network. Also 
this algorithm optimizes the power consumption. 
Jiadi et al.  [7] [8], modified the Media Independent 
Handover component (MIH) where handover is performed 
in three steps: initiation, selection and execution. The 
proposed process aims to improve the handover delay by 
adding new events to the initiation step that can be 
generated from the application layer instead of lower layer 
upon the user’s satisfaction. Moreover they added a new 
algorithm at the selection step based on price, delay, Jitter, 
Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) and available data rate within the 
MADM (Multi Attribute Decision Making) function to 
improve the QoS during selection process. 
The research work initiated in  [9] [10] proposed a 
selection algorithm based on the willingness of users to pay 
for a given service, while Cicconetti et al.  [11] provided an 
algorithm based on three parameters: connectivity graph,

connectivity 
table 
between 
nodes 
and 
the 
current 
geographical position of the serving network. The proposed 
algorithm reduces the handover time and the energy 
consumption of mobile node due to scanning. 
The MIIS component (see Section III) of MIH is not 
fully implemented by NIST. Arraezet al.  [12] implement 
this service and install it on each access point allowing user 
to save the energy of the battery by just activating a single 
interface. According to the IEEE 802.21 standard, an MIH 
user communicates, through the link layer, with its MIHF 
which sends a query to MIIS to retrieve the list of all 
networks in the vicinity. Alternatively the authors of 
 [13] [14] developed a new method to communicate with the 
MIIS through the upper layers using Web Services. 
Moreover, 802.11 protocols defined 11 channels for 
communication and force the MN during the handover to 
scan all channels looking for the active one. Khan et al. 
 [15], proposed a new algorithm based on the Media 
Independent Information Server (MIIS), to provide user 
with a list of only active channel to be scanned in order to 
save time during handover. 
An et al. [16] added two new parameters to MIH that 
allow FMIPV6 to save the steps of proxy router solicitation 
and advertisement (RtSolPr/PrRtAdv). This resulted in a 
decrease of handover latency and improvement of packet 
loss ratio. 
In this paper, we investigate the effect of the inclusion of 
three parameters with the signal strength into the destination 
network selection mechanism during handover. These 
parameters are: Available Bandwidth, type of network and 
mobile speed. As far as we know, these parameters have not 
been investigated at the same time before. As it will be 
detailed in Section V, our first experiment will show that by 
including the available bandwidth parameter (ABW) the 
packet loss will be improved. The second experiment will 
show that upon the type (WI-FI, WIMAX) of the current 
and destination network we can save on packet loss. The 
third experiment will show that it is worthily significant to 
consider the velocity of MN while selecting new network 
during handover. 
III. IEEE 802.21 STANDARD 
User mobility can be achieved at different levels of the 
protocol stack. The IEEE802.21 standard, also known as 
Media Independent Handover (MIH), provide mobility 
management at layer 2.5, by being inserted between layer 2 
and layer 3. As depicted in Fig. 1, the Media Independent 
Handover Function (MIHF) is the main entity of the 
standard that allows communication in both directions 
between lower and upper layers through three services: 
event (MIES), command (MICS) and information (MIES) 
 [3] [17]. 
A. 
Media Independent Event Services, MIES 
This service detects changes in the lower layers 
(physical and link) to determine if it needs to perform 
handover. Two types of events can occur: "MIH Event" sent 
by the MIHF to the upper layers (3 +), and "Link Event" 
that spreads from the lower layers to the MIHF. 
 
Figure 1.  MIH architecture. 
B. 
Media Independent Command Services, MICS 
This service uses two types of events. The "MIH 
Commands" transmitted by the user towards the MIHF and 
"Link Commands" sent by MIHF to lower layers. 
C. 
Media Independent Information Services, MIIS 
The MIIS let the mobile user discover and collect 
information about features and services offered by 
neighboring networks such as network type, operator ID, 
network ID, cost, and network QoS, etc. This information 
helps doing a more efficient handover decision across 
heterogeneous networks. 
IV. WI-FI AND WIMAX STANDARDS 
A. 
IEEE 802.11, WIFI 
IEEE 802.11, Wireless Fidelity (WI-FI)  [18], is a 
wireless local network technology designed for a private 
LAN with a small coverage area (hundreds of meters). 
Different versions of 802.11 exist and communicate on 
different frequency bands with a different bit rate. In all 
simulations that we performed in this paper we use 802.11b. 
Mobility support in conventional IEEE 802.11 standard is 
not a prior consideration and horizontal handover procedure 
does not meet the needs of real time traffic  [19]. WI-FI’s 
QoS is limited in supporting multimedia or Voice over 
Internet Protocol (VoIP) traffic and several research 
activities have been carried out in an attempt to overcome 
this short fall [20]. 
B. 
IEEE 802.16, WIMAX 
IEEE 802.16, WIMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for 
Microwave Access), technology is for metropolitan area 
network (MAN) covering a wide area at very high speed. 
QoS in WI-FI is relative to packet flow and similar to fixed 
Ethernet while WIMAX define a packet classification and 
scheduling mechanism with four classes to guarantee QoS 
for each flow: Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS), Real-Time 
Polling Service (RTPS), non-real-Time Polling Services 
186

(nrtPS) and Best Effort (BE). WIMAX mobile (802.16e) 
adds a fifth one called extended real-time Polling System 
(ertPS)  [21]. WIMAX supports three handover methods: 
Hard Handover (HHO), Fast Base Station Switching (FBSS) 
and Macro-Diversity Handover (MDHO). The HO process 
 [22] is composed of several phases: network topology 
advertisement, MS scanning, cell reselection, HO decision 
and initiation and network re-entry  [23] [24]. 
V. MIH PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this section, we will present three scenarios to 
evaluate the impact of the available bandwidth, type of 
network, and user velocity on selecting a destination 
network during handover. 
A. 
Simulation Environment 
To show the limits of using one parameter to select an 
access network and to motivate the need of advanced 
selection methods that combine several constraints, we 
present in this section several simulation scenarios using 
NS2, v2.29, which support the Media Independent 
Handover (MIH) module implemented by National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST). 
The studied scenarios focus on the importance of some 
criteria other than radio signal strength while evaluating 
network in the vicinity for handover. The First scenario 
studies the impact of the selected network available 
bandwidth. The second one tryout the type of destination 
network, and the third scenario experiments the speed effect 
of the MN on QoS during handover. 
Simulation parameters are shown in Table I. Traffic used 
is a CBR (Constant Bit Rate), packet size is always constant 
to 1500 bytes and the throughput is determined by varying 
the interval of sending packet during simulation. 
B. 
Scenario I : NIST Selection Weakness 
1)  Topology Description: Topology of this scenario, 
shown in Fig. 2, consists of two WLAN Access Points AP1 
and AP2 (802.11b) located inside an 802.16 base station 
(BS) coverage area and one Mobile Node (MN) equipped 
with multiples interfaces. It is important to note that other 
stream of traffic source is connected to AP2 consuming its 
bandwidth. At the beginning, MN connected to AP1, starts 
moving to the center of the BS and on its way detect AP2. 
According to the NIST handover algorithm, that selects a 
new network based on the Radio Signal Strength only, AP2 
is considered a better network than WIMAX and the MN 
will make a handover from AP1 to AP2. Once the MN 
reaches the limit coverage area of AP2, the handover to 
WIMAX base station occurs. 
2) Scenario I Results: By increasing the throughput 
generated by the CBR application on the MN, we observe a 
greater number of packet loss overall scenarios. Fig. 3 
shows the packet loss during HO. When a MN loses the 
signal on AP1 it needs to make a HO to another network, it 
has 2 choices: handover to AP2 or to WIMAX. According 
to NIST algorithm, which selects a new network based on 
the signal strength only, AP2 is selected and Fig. 3 shows 
the number of packet loss during handover AP1-AP2. When

the MN reaches the limit coverage area of AP2, it makes the 
handover to WIMAX and we observe another amount of PL 
during HO AP2-WIMAX. 3) Critics of the NIST algorithm: 
select a destination network based on the signal strength 
received by the mobile node still unsatisfactory. Indeed, a 
mobile node, near to an overloaded base station, receives a 
strong signal. According to NIST algorithm, the MN 
handover to this base station and meet a high packet loss 
rate due to a lack of available bandwidth. 
C. 
Multi Criteria Selection Algorithm 
In this section, we propose a new selection algorithm 
named Multi Criteria Selection Algorithm (MCSA) which is 
a modified version of the algorithm proposed by NIST to 
select a destination network based on two criteria: Radio 
Signal Strength (RSS) and available bandwidth (ABW) of 
destination network. We assume that the user preference 
consists of selecting a network with the largest available 
bandwith whatever the cost is. Then, we compare the 
number of packet loss during HO between MCSA and NIST 
algorithm. 
1) Strategy of MCSA: A Mobile Node (MN) that is 
connected to a serving network receives beacons and router 
advertisement (RA) from Wi-Fi and WIMAX network in 
the vicinity. According to our proposed algorithm, MN will 
187

select the network that has the biggest available bandwidth 
(ABW). In order to get the value of ABW to the mobile 
node, we needed to change the structure of the beacons and 
router advertisement in NS2 by adding a new field that 
holds the value of ABW. 
2) MCSA results: in order to compare MCSA and NIST 
results, we use the same topology of simulation cited in Fig. 
2. By using our proposed MCSA algorithm, which aims to 
find among the visible list of networks, the one that have the 
largest available bandwidth (ABW), WIMAX is selected 
instead of AP2 and the total number of handovers decreases 
improving the total number of PL and the Quality of Service 
is preserved during the mobility of the MN 
For a user who gives importance for the number of 
Packet Loss rather than type of network (WIFI or WIMAX), 
it is better to follow the strategy of our proposed MCSA 
algorithm that improves the packet loss ratio by 33%. Table 
II shows the improvement in number of HO and PL with 
MSCA for a given throughput. 
We can conclude that selecting a destination network 
using only RSS as indicator does not meet the needs of all 
users. More accurate choice of destination network during 
handover would consider the ABW of the destination 
network. A new framework is needed to consider the values 
of different criteria to take a decision and make a better 
choice concerning the destination network during handover. 
In order to better understand the sequence of events that 
a MN and Network perform during successful HO, we 
provide a short description of messages sequence chart in 
Fig. 4. The dashed and non-dashed bloc represents the flow 
of handover messages according to NIST and MCSA 
algorithm. By using our MCSA algorithm, we can save all 
messages in the dashed bloc which enables less signaling 
over the network and improvement in number of packet loss 
for a better QoS guarantee provided to a mobile user. 
A detailed description of the events sequence according 
to the implementation of the IEEE802.21 standard by NIST 
is as follow: 
1) 
MIH user on the MN sends MIH Capability Discovery 
Request to discover link capability supported (events and 
commands) for each mac of each node. 
2) 
MIH user on the MN sends MIH Register Request to 
register to the local and remote MIHF. 
3) 
MIH User on the MN sends MIH Get Status requesting 
the available network interface; it discovers the presence of 
2 interfaces (WIFI and WIMAX) both interfaces support 
events and commands services of MIHF. 
4) 
MIH user on the MN sends MIH Event Subscribe 
request to subscribe to the events on the given links for local 
and remote MIHF. This latter send MIH Event Subscribe 
response to the MIH User of the mobile node 
5) 
Since the BS decides of the reservation of bandwidth, 
it informs the MN of the frame structure in the uplink and 
downlink. It sends the DL-MAP/UL-MAP to the WIMAX 
interface of the mobile node MN. The WIMAX base station 
is detected and generates a link up event toward the MIHF 
of MN. 
6) 
MIHF of the MN order the WIMAX interface of MN 
to connect to the BS.

In this case, a router solicitation is sent form the 
MIPV6 module of MN to the neighbor discovery module of 
the BS. 
8) 
Neighbor discovery module of BS reply by sending a 
router advertisement (RA) to the MIPV6 module of MN 
with the network prefix of WIMAX base station = 3.0.0; 
router-life time = 1800s and advertisement interval = 10s. 
9) 
MN’s WIFI interface receive a beacon message with a 
power above the threshold value and trigger a link Detect 
event; the available bandwidth of AP1 is largely available 
(not consumed by any other traffic), according to the both 
algorithm MCSA and NIST, AP1 is considered as a better 
network.

WiFi 
interface 
of 
MN;

and 
router 
solicitation between the MIPV6 of MN and the neighbor 
discovery module of AP1 (first WIFI access point). 
13) Starting of traffic flow between the WIFI interface of 
the MN and the correspondent node through the AP1 access 
point. 
14) Once MN reaches the limit coverage of AP1, it starts 
receiving the beacon message coming from AP2. Detect the 
presence of a beacon power above the defined threshold.  
15) WIFI interface of MN sends a link going down and 
link down to the MIH user of MN through the MIHF 
16) MIH user of MN sends a link scan request to the 
MIHF of MN. 
17) The WIFI interface of MN send a probe request and 
start scanning the 11 channels of WIFI interface looking for 
an active one.

18) This message received by AP2 which reply by sending 
a probe response to the MIH user of MN through its MIHF. 
MIH user of MN detects the presence of AP2. 
According to NIST algorithm, that considers this access 
point as better network decide to handover to it (and 
continue with step 19). But according to MCSA algorithm 
which evaluate the available bandwidth of AP2 before 
handover to it, find its available bandwidth, consumed by 
other traffic, very small comparatively to WIMAX, ignore 
this network and handover to WIMAX directly (jump to 
step number 20). 
19) MIH user sends to MIHF an MIH Link ConFig. this 
generates a Link Connect to the WIFI interface of MN 
(connection to AP2). 
20) MIH user sends to the MIHF a MIH Link Disconnect 
which disconnects the connection between the WIFI 
interface of MN and AP1. According to NIST algorithm, we 
continue with step 21 and according to MCSA we jump to 
step 28 saving by that all steps between 21 and 27. 
21) The WIFI interface of MN sends a link handover 
imminent message to the MIHF of MN. 
22) MIH user of MN sends link handover complete to the 
MHIF of MN.  
23) WIFI interface of MN send link up indication event to 
the MIH user of MN through his MIHF announcing the 
detection of AP2 (second WIFI access point). 
24) MIPV6 module of MN sends router solicitation to the 
WIFI interface of AP2 which answer by a router 
advertisement with the new prefix (2.0.1). 
25) Starting of traffic between the WIFI interface of MN 
and correspondent node (CN) through AP2. 
26) MIH user sends the MIH Capability Discovery 
Request and response to the Mac layer of AP2 testing if the 
Events and Commands events list is supported. 
27) The MN reaches the limit coverage of AP2, start a link  
going down event, the WIFI interface of MN send a link 
scan event looking for others network (delaying the 
connection to WIMAX) don’t find anyone else WIMAX. 
28) MN connect to WIMAX and a link disconnect event 
with WIFI is triggered and traffic continue to the end of the 
simulation through WIMAX. 
D. 
Scenario II : Type of Network Impact 
1) Topology Description: Fig. 4 illustrates the topology 
of scenario II. During this simulation we compare the delay 
taken by MN when it makes a HO from WI-FI to WIMAX 
(Fig. 5a) versus handover from WIMAX to WI-FI (Fig. 5b). 
Measurements are done according to handover algorithm of 
NIST only. 
During the simulation, the MN moves from WI-FI (AP1) 
toward the center of BS. Once it reaches the limit coverage 
of AP1, a “link going down” trigger is fired announcing the 
need for handover. Since the only available network is 
802.16 (WIMAX), the handover is made to this network. 
We also study the same simulation when the mobile moves 
from WIMAX to WI-FI. 
2) 
Scenario II Results: Fig. 6 shows a decreasing 
curve of the handover delay as a function of the throughput 
generated by the MN application. Handover delay is the 
time difference between the first packet received on the 
destination network and the last packet received on the 
current served network. When we increase the throughput, 
the time between two consecutive packets is smaller and 
packets reach the destination network earlier, which 
explains the appearance of the downward curves of 
handover delay in Fig. 6. 
Handover delay from WIMAX to WI-FI is less than the 
handover delay from WI-FI to WIMAX. When the MN 
connected to AP1 moves to the center of BS (Fig. 5a), it 
reaches the limit coverage area of AP1 and generates a “link 
going down” trigger. In this case, a scan process starts 
looking for a new network delaying the connection to BS 
(Fig. 6). While for handover from WIMAX to WI-FI 
network (Fig. 5b), the MN don’t trigger this event because it 
is still in the coverage area of WIMAX (no loss of WIMAX 
signal) that’s why we have less handover time (Fig. 6). 
As a conclusion of this experiment, we can say that upon 
the type of destination network, we can have different 
values of handover delay and as a consequence different 
value of PL. 
As shown in Fig. 6, we can note that by varying the 
throughput values between 120Kbit/s and 170Kbit/s, the 
handover time varies between 275ms and 200ms hence 
exceeding the maximum acceptable value of the QoS end-
to-end delay parameter (150ms) for real time application. 
This criterion is worthy to be considered when selecting a 
new network during HO.

E. 
Scenario III : Speed Impact 
1) Topology Description: In this scenario, shown in Fig. 
7, we study the effect of MN speed on the packet loss during 
HO. At the beginning, the MN connected to WIMAX, 
moves to the center of the BS, resulting on a handover to 
AP1 and AP2 according to NIST algorithm. Once the MN 
reaches the limit coverage of AP2, it returns to WIMAX 
network. 
2) Scenario III Results: For the three different 
experimented speeds the packet loss on WIMAX is null 
because 802.16e WIMAX is designed to support high speed 
mobile users  [25]. Once a MN starts moving toward the 
center of the BS, it detects the presence of AP1, and 
according to NIST algorithm it makes a HO to AP1. Some 
PL happen during this HO and the value of this PL increases 
with mobile speed (Fig. 8) because WI-FI, unlike WIMAX, 
is 
limited 
in 
high-speed 
transport 
communications 
environment  [26]; and doesn’t support high speed mobility, 
e.g., for a speed of 20m/s we can see a great impact of 
Doppler Effect on the system performance  [27]. 
The same process happens during handover from AP1 to 
AP2 as we experienced other number of packet loss that 
increases with mobile speed. Also when the MN handover 
from AP2 to WIMAX some packet loss occur whose 
number increase with mobile speed. Accordingly, we 
conclude that users who place importance on the number 
 
 
Figure 7.  Scenario III topology 
 
 
Figure 8.  Packet loss as a function of mobile speed 
of packet loss and MN speed would prefer to stay on 
WIMAX and never stream through AP1 or AP2. Moreover, 
we concluded that NIST fails to meet the requirement of 
mobile user moving at a speed higher than the pedestrian 
speed (1m/s). Thus, we argue that there is a need for a new 
framework that takes into account the user speed. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have evaluated the effect of some 
parameters like Radio Signal Strength, available bandwidth, 
type of network (802.11 or 802.16) and mobile speed for 
choosing the best network in the vicinity. We conclude that 
choosing a network based on the Radio Signal Strength only 
is not always a good strategy. The experiments that we 
conducted using the NS-2 simulator showed that the 
inclusion of additional parameters significantly improves 
the packet loss ratio and so the QoS guarantee for mobile 
users. In future work, we will propose a framework with a 
generic model that takes into consideration different levels 
of constraints such as network parameters with users and 
operators preferences to improve the selection of the best 
candidate network and optimize QoS parameters in terms of 
packet loss ratio, delay and jitter for real time applications.
