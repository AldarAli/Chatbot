Abstract — When companies engage in innovation, the 
appropriate selection of projects to invest resource in is 
paramount. In order to do this effectively, they need to 
research appropriate opportunities to create sufficient 
understanding. The various opportunities available need to be 
rationalised to match with the resource available. There are 
several rationalisation methods available, including Portfolio 
Management, Scoring Methods and Decision Support Systems. 
However, there are few that combine to be utilised by Small 
and Medium Sized Enterprises effectively. This work adds to 
the field of Small and Medium Sized Enterprise Decision 
Support by proposing an approach combining opportunity 
investigation, review and recommendation such that the most 
appropriate candidate innovation can be selected and taken 
forwards for development. 
Keywords - Portfolio Management; Scoring Methods; 
Decision Support Systems. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Scoring methods, such as the Absolute method from 
[1] or the risk-reward matrix from [2], can be utilised to 
repeatedly review attributes of potential development 
projects. Selecting an innovative development approach 
indicates business intentions going forwards. In order to 
make a success of this approach, it has to be ingrained at a 
business wide strategic level. Businesses often form their 
strategy around the development of new products [3]. This 
can take several forms including incremental [3], radical 
[4],and disruptive [5]. These different strategies lead to a 
number of products making up the company’s portfolio [6]. 
The difficulty for companies comes from selecting which of 
the next generation of potential developments should join 
the existing portfolio [7]. 
 
Currently there are a number of tools available to 
companies to aid this selection process including the 
Balanced Scorecard [8]. However, these methods introduce 
the potential for subjectivity, bias and an undue focus on 
particular attributes, when others may be of greater use to 
the company. This research and paper focuses on proposing 
three new methods to evaluate potential development 
projects that can be combined to form key elements of a 
Portfolio Management process. 
 
During the process of identifying new development 
projects, capturing and understanding information is critical 
and makes a core part of this process. Utilising a process of 
capture, comparison and ranking, from a company’s 
perspective, as to which are the most critical pieces of 
information can allow for directed capture and review. This 
forms a simple process, especially from the Small and 
Medium Sized Enterprise (SME) perspective of limited 
resource [9], which can result in clear understanding via 
prioritisation of the development options available.  
 
There are many tools available to aid companies in 
making the necessary decisions, as to which development 
path they should select, these are a form of Decision 
Support Systems [10]. These use available information, of 
varying types per system, and a calculation method to 
recommend which option should be selected [10]. However, 
the calculation systems make decisions. They present 
recommendations on the decisions that should be made 
based on the available information; it is then up to the user 
to make the decision. Therefore, it is critical that Decision 
Support Systems are able to combine the most relevant 
information in a suitable way for a recommendation to be 
made. In some cases, utilising trends or previous data is not 
sufficient to deliver a recommendation. Instead the input of 
experts within the relevant field is required to ensure that 
the captured information is synthesised and understood 
correctly.

The aim of this work was to use the most relevant 
information attributes to help make recommendations on the 
development direction the SME should pursue. This 
process, while intended for a single SME, should also aim to 
be as universal as possible to other companies in a similar 
position. The underlying process used was taken from [11] 
and [1]. These pieces of work deliver a necessary level of 
understanding for company processes to reach the point at 
which such a method would be required. In addition, they 
deliver processes to capture and review relevant information 
on technological innovation which can be used as the basis 
for a Decision Support System, for this specific application.  
 
An ethnographic stance was used to conduct this 
work. from a first-hand perspective [12], utilising 
experience of the problem space. It also requires observation 
of people’s behaviour [13] and engagement with the 
problem [14] to deliver the required solution. This approach 
was selected in relation to an industrial problem experienced 
by a highly innovative SME, herein referred to as “the 
SME”. The problem experienced was based upon the SMEs 
highly adaptable core intellectual property exploited in 
multiple technological applications. The SME has limited 
resource 
meaning 
that 
investment 
in 
innovative 
development projects had to be focused on those carrying 
the highest chance of success. Therefore, the purpose of the 
research project was to deliver a method to enable the 
appropriate selection between available possible innovative 
developments. This work was conducted in a cyclical 
manner within the SME to iteratively evolve the proposed 
Decision 
Support 
System 
to 
a 
point 
at 
which 
recommendations 
made 
could 
be 
utilised 
within 
conventional decision processes. 
 
The paper has the following structure. Background 
literature is introduced to cover Portfolio Management, 
Strategy and Decision Making. Then the proposed Decision 
Support System is discussed and evaluated. Finally, 
conclusions are drawn based on the presented work.  
II. 
BACKGROUND LITERATURE 
Strategy is an instrument for keeping a high level of 
performance and to enable success [15]; this is focused 
company wide to achieve competitive advantage [16]. For a 
company, strategy is outlined such that it can aim to achieve 
set goals [17]. A company may select different types of 
strategy depending on what it is that they are aiming to 
achieve. Some strategies include first to market [16] and 
product differentiation [18]. In order to adopt a strategy 
there are three stages. The first is selection; in which a 
company should select a strategy which takes them towards 
their goals that will work across environments [19]. Once 
the strategy is selected, the finer details need to be 
formulated based on the company’s knowledge [20]. Finally 
the strategy is implemented which requires buy in from all 
company levels [4] to ensure it is enacted as desired. 
Carefully designing and enacting strategy is critically 
important to differentiated activities such as innovation [4] 
as negative results can result from failing to be innovative in 
relation to the company’s products or service.  
 
The process of innovation can be seen as one 
whereby something new is done to bring benefit [21]. This 
benefit is in terms of the customer and the company 
performance [22]. The innovation process is so important, 
that it is one of the top priorities for 71% of companies [23]. 
However, it is an activity that pervades throughout a 
company including aspects such as culture, technology and 
resources [21]. There are several different forms of 
innovation. Two of the most common are process and 
product innovation. Process innovation is focused on the 
way in which firms carry out their activities [24]. Product 
innovation ensures the introduction of a new product to 
meet perceived market needs [25], based on the company’s 
understanding. In addition to being focused on delivering 
something new, the innovation process is formed to be 
delivered in a certain way. A prime example of this is 
radical innovation; whereby the innovation of products or 
processes are driven by the technology being created, not 
the market [26]. This form of innovation can deliver 
significant returns [27] as it is reported as being responsible 
for 61% of profits even though it is only 38% of revenue 
[27]. Therefore, the innovation can be seen as a way to 
generate new revenue streams differentiated from the 
competition.  
 
Many companies rely on innovation to achieve a 
competitive position within their market [7]. The challenge 
associated with this is assessing these opportunities [28] so 
the available resources can be distributed appropriately, to 
ensure the selected projects can be supported. With limited 
resources, which is always a concern, effectively managing 
an effective development pipeline is critical [29]. This helps 
to maximise returns by only allowing appropriate projects to 
begin. Within business, this distribution of resource is a 
managerial decision [30]. As such, the decision requires the 
necessary attention being placed on planning and 
understanding projects.  
 
It is not uncommon for several options to present 
themselves at the same time or to be implemented together 
[30] alongside existing projects. However, the challenge is 
determining what new product has a chance of becoming a 
success [28]. So the question is “ how to do the correct 
projects?” [7]. One approach is to use a conceptual funnel 
[31] which narrows down all potential projects into those 
with a higher chance of success. Activities such as 
investigation, evaluation and prioritising of potential 
projects are conducted within this conceptual funnel [29]. 
Prioritising potential projects, as part of the conceptual 
funnel, allows for an appropriate distribution of resources 
[7] to those projects that warrant them most. Approaches

that are used to do this are either quantitative or qualitative, 
using techniques that range from rigorous tests to social-
science methods [28]. 
 
A prominent approach to aid in the management of 
active and potential projects is Portfolio Management [6]. 
This has been developed to coordinate multiple projects 
towards the same strategic goals [32] and is commonly used 
to manage the composition of a company’s product 
portfolio, including potential new product development [6]. 
This is commonly used in a planning capacity by managers 
or key players in an organisation [6] and ties into the 
management of the development pipeline [29]. As a part of 
this process, a primary filter can be used to draw attention to 
particular potential projects [2] based on attributes such as 
their market potential. This can aid in removing those 
potential projects that would not deliver on their promise or 
are only pitched due to internal political reasons [7].  
 
There are several methods and frameworks discussed 
in literature for Portfolio Management. One method 
presented in [2] scores a potential project with respect to a 
number of criteria. However, when these same criteria are 
given to multiple people for review there is a strong 
possibility that different results are returned due to differing 
individual experience, making this approach highly 
subjective. The risk-reward matrix is also presented in [2] 
with the most desirable case being to have a project that is 
both low risk and high reward. Other methods include the 
organisation wide selection process in [33], the data 
envelopment analysis and Balanced Scorecard method in 
[34]. Additional methods are also presented in [7], [28], 
[35].  
 
When using the presented methods, decision 
attributes that are commonly used are cost-benefit and cash-
flow [35]. These are converted into a single determinant 
such as Net Present Value (NPV) or Internal Rate of Return 
(IRR) [7] so that they can be readily compared. However, 
there are several attributes that are unable to be converted 
into a financial measure. These include risk, route to market 
and engagement opportunities; all critical aspects to 
understand 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
potential 
technology 
development. Therefore, by using purely financial measures, 
only part of the picture is seen [36]; whereas by using other 
attributes a more holistic view is attained. Thus, an approach 
is desired that can deal with multiple types of attribute and 
still deliver comparable measures.     
 
Any decision made affects the future [37]. For a 
company, this relates to potential project selection and 
ultimate offering. These decisions methods can therefore be 
thought of as anticipatory [38] in the way that they try to 
anticipate the future and make the best decision for it. An 
anticipated future could be caused by their introduction of a 
new product or service and is related to their Portfolio 
Management approach. Therefore, Portfolio Management is 
concerned with the future [39] and ensuring a company is 
set to be as prepared and positioned as best it can to cope 
with the identified futures. To aid in this, Decision Support 
Systems are used by decisions makers, via a set of 
computerised methods which capture multiple data points 
[10]. These are best adopted to cater for the inherent 
uncertainty in Portfolio Management [40]  coming from the 
environment and the nature of the data collected. It is 
common for companies to collect vast amounts of data in 
relation to potential developments; however extracting 
something meaningful from it is the true challenge [41]. 
Decision Support Systems can help by utilising this 
collected data to deliver guidance on selecting a course of 
action. There are several forms of Decision Support Systems 
including data driven, model driven and knowledge driven 
[10]. Each form uses a variety of inputs to deliver a 
recommendation on how to approach the future that can 
then be enacted by the company. 
 
A different slant needs to be taken when relating the 
previous concepts of business strategy, innovation, Portfolio 
Management and decision making to SMEs. SMEs are more 
flexible in terms of structure, meaning they can be more 
ambitious than their size would otherwise suggest [42]. 
However, their owners and managers fear loss often more 
than the gain [42], often hindering the attainment of success. 
Yet they can be highly innovative in achieving their 
objectives. For SMEs, innovating is a necessity for survival 
[43]. However, being innovative relies on a riskier business 
strategy [44]. Furthermore, SMEs can find it hard to obtain 
the required finance [44], skills and knowledge [45] to 
support their innovations. Therefore when managing their 
portfolios, extra care has to be taken to balance the risk of 
any innovative path [46]. This is because SMEs cannot 
afford to make decisions with inherent risk [47].  
 
The existing literature as discussed here, presents 
how for SMEs, the ascertainment of their innovative 
strategy is fraught with difficulties. These include 
identifying 
appropriate 
innovations, 
researching 
and 
selecting between them. Conventional approaches are 
limited in their focus on understanding financial measures, 
yet this is only a segment of the overall picture. This 
drastically affects the Portfolio Management approach taken 
to focus on only those projects that present the least risk and 
financial impact; however, these will fail to yield the 
greatest return. Investigating 
these opportunities to 
encompass 
more 
attributes 
can 
deliver 
a 
deeper 
understanding beyond the financial, enabling the SME to 
reach its true potential via effective and suitable innovation. 
III. 
A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO SUPPORT 
INNOVATION OPTIONEERING 
Some companies have portfolios that are made up of 
multiple products and services. To keep operating they are 

330
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 10 no 3 & 4, year 2017, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

required to innovate and improve the portfolio and fulfil the 
needs of their customers. This process of product and 
service improvement, whether that is incremental or radical, 
needs to be selected from the other available courses of 
action. For SMEs these decisions, as to which courses of 
action to back, become ever more critical due to their 
smaller portfolio of more specialist products and services. 
They are likely to have a small number of products offering 
them a marketable proposition. In addition, they are also 
limited by resources that can be committed to development. 
This means that they have to be extra vigilant in committing 
resources to developments that are more certain to deliver 
the next step in the company’s evolution and revenue. To 
aid in this, there are many Decision Support Systems 
available. However, for an SME the focus comes down to 
being sure they are utilising suitable information to make 
their decisions as well as ensuring the collected information 
is used appropriately in the pursuit of the correct decisions. 
It is therefore proposed to deliver a Decision Support System 
designed to aid the decision process by utilising information 
of importance to SMEs and then by reviewing this to deliver 
a clear prioritisation of the development paths available. 
This would have the potential to improve their processes 
and indicate which path would bring them the highest levels 
of return and success.  
A. Underlying Structure 
In the process flow outlined by [11], there are several 
key phases for SMEs to progress through in order to move 
from the identification of an idea to its creation. These 
phases are Ideation, Research, Selection and Development. 
The process that was outlined in [11] details the relevant 
information to understand the innovation to be conducted, 
including prospective sources. In the Selection phase, core 
activities include the comparison of identified ideas using 
decision methods and prioritisation. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Selection and Development Phases from [11] 
 
In Figure 1 it can be seen how with the collection of 
captured information precedes the Comparison and review 
process. This uses relevant Decision methods which form 
the basis of this paper’s contribution to the body of 
knowledge.  
 
The proposed Decision Support System uses the 
Weighted Sum Model at its heart. This is comprised of a 
weighted sum of related values [48]; which necessitates 
both values and their respective weights. The scores 
originate from the attributes identified in [11] but are 
aggregated together to create a description of four Scoring 
Factors. These were defined to be Development Potential, 
Resource Applicability, Commercial Viability and Payoff 
Expected. The Development Potential of an opportunity is 
defined as a metric for the likelihood for success in 
delivering the required technology. This can be based on the 
requirements of the final solution and the development 
process needed. The Resource Applicability describes the 
suitability of assigning resource to a particular project based 
on the amount needed and how it is to be spent. The 
Commercial Viability relates to how the potential 
development would succeed if it were entered into its 
respective market in the face of current competition. Finally, 
the Payoff Expected describes the likely returns based on 
the proposed technology for the relative customers/end 
users.  
 
As introduced in [11], there are identified to be 
several critical attributes to understand in order to initiate 
technological innovation. These were utilised as a starting 
point and via the ethnographic nature of this work, those 
identified were modified and several others were added; 
these are shown in Table I.

What is the target market and its

Based on the utilisation of these attributes, a 
complete understanding can be created in relation to a 
technological innovation opportunity. In particular, this is

designed to be utilised from the perspective of a company 
aiming to undergo this process themselves. 
  
In order to describe each Scoring Factor, these 
information attributes need to be combined and aggregated 
together. This has been achieved by utilising the logic of the 
Hierarchy Process Model made up of distinctive layers [49]. 
To understand each Scoring Factor, a breakdown will be 
achieved via the question of “How is y defined?”. Then 
when traversing up the hierarchy, the statement “x is used to 
define y” is used. Based on this, the breakdown shown in 
Table II is created. 
 
Table II. Scoring Factor Breakdown

Based on the breakdown shown in Table II, each 
Scoring Factor can be defined as a summation of the 
information collected for each appropriate attributes. This 
can therefore also be used as a way to combine reviews of 
individual attributes into larger sections.  
 
In addition to the Scoring Factors for the Weighted 
Sum Model, there are associated weighting values used to 
give the final score and ranking. These Scoring Factors have 
associated weights called: Development Risk Aversion, 
Resource Spending Aversion, Commercial Risk Aversion 
and Payoff Expected. The Development Risk Aversion 
weight refers to the unwillingness of a company to enter a 
development project that displays anything less than a 
complete assurance of success. The Resource Spending 
Aversion describes how averse the company is to 
committing resources of any kind to a project. Commercial 
Risk Aversion relates to the level at which a company views 
a competitive market as being unfavourable. Finally, Payoff 
Expected weight describes the level at which the company 
expects there to be a return from any investment in a 
development project. These weights are assigned based 
upon the balance of these factors and therefore forms a basic 
description of the company.  
 
In addition to weighting values to represent the 
company using this approach, the Reviewers who will 
evaluate the captured information are also weighted, such 
that those with different knowledge and perspective will 
have a respective impact. In total, three different Reviewers 
are involved in this process. As per [11], information is 
collected in relation to three main areas, State of the Art, 
Course of Actions and Business Case. To result in an 
appropriate and valid score, a Reviewer must be paired with 
the information that best reflects their expertise. For this, 
three Reviewers are defined; the Technology Expert, 
Developer and Manager. The Technology Expert is 
described as someone who understands the field in relation 
to a specific opportunity. The Developer, is either a 
hardware or software developer and therefore understands 
the process of creating an opportunity. Finally, the Manager 
understands the potential business implications of selecting 
an opportunity to pursue, such as the cost on the business 
and the target market. It is expected that a different person 
will occupy each Reviewer role, and therefore their related 
weight will be set based on the worth and validity of that 
person’s review. However, it is also possible for the same 
person to occupy multiple reviewer posts; in this case the 
setting of their weighting value is even more critical. In this 
eventuality, the weighting values should be set with respect 
to the areas where their expertise lies. 
 
The weights are defined and calculated for the 
company and Reviewer profiles at the start of the process, 
with the company profile set once for the use of the 
framework. Reviewer profile weights are changed on the 
start of a new project when new Reviewers are involved; as 
shown in (1).  
 
𝜙 = 𝑠𝜙 ∙ 𝜎𝜙 
 
Where 𝜙 ∈ { 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿, 𝜀, 𝜁, 𝜂}   
 
Where α is the Development Risk Aversion Weight, 
β is the Commercial Risk Aversion Weight, γ is the 
Resource Spending Aversion Weight, δ is the Payoff 
Expected Weight, s is the score given and σ is calculated in 
(2). 
𝜎 =  1 ÷ 𝑟 
 
Where r is the normalisation factor for each of the 
utilised scoring methods; i.e., 5. 
 
An example of this would be as shown in (3).

𝛼 = 𝑠𝛼 ∙ 𝜎𝛼 
 
𝜎 = 1 5
  
 
𝛼 = 4 ∙  0.2 = 0.8 
 
This gives a weighted score relative to the 
Development Risk Aversion Weight, in this example. 
Furthermore, the Reviewer scores are weighted based on 
their 
respective 
importance 
(weighting 
value). 
The 
weighting value relevant to them is applied to every score 
they enter, this is calculated as follows where; ε is the 
Technology Expert Weight, ζ is the Developer Weight, η is 
the Manager Weight. 
 
𝑐 = 𝑏 ∙ 𝜏 
 
Where 𝜏 ∈  ε, ζ, η  
 
This gives 𝜙 = 𝑐𝜙 ∙ 𝜎𝜙 
 
In (4), b is the score entered by the Reviewer and c is 
the resulting score with their weighting applied. By doing 
this, the final score calculated is adjusted as to the relative 
importance of each Reviewer as defined during the setup of 
the Decision Support System. 
 
The overall formula demonstrating the WSM is 
given in (5).

𝑗=1
 
for i = 1, 2, 3, …, m  
 
Where there are n criteria, m alternatives, wj as the 
weight and aij is the performance criteria. An example of 
this over 4 criteria and weights would give (6). 
 
𝑊𝑆𝑀 =  𝑛1 ∙ 𝑤1 +  𝑛2 ∙ 𝑤2 +  𝑛3 ∙ 𝑤3 +  𝑛4 ∙ 𝑤4     
B. Reviewing Information Attributes 
The scores for each attribute are given by utilising 
one of three scoring methods. Scoring has been a project 
selection technique since its origin in the 1950’s [28]. 
Scoring methods help to estimate how attractive a project is 
and, which path to take [2]. In addition, they introduce 
sufficient rigor in the selection process while not being 
overly complex to discourage use [28]. Furthermore, they 
can also accommodate non-quantitative or “fuzzy” and non-
detailed data whilst also being customised for the 
organisation they are deployed in [28]. To construct the 
proposed scoring methods, three key properties were 
identified to differentiate between the types of attribute and 
therefore, which method can be used to apply a score. These 
properties are Independent, Comparable and Bounded. 
Independent refers to the ability of an attribute to be scored 
in isolation, with the score it receives being in no way 
related to those before or relying on those from another 
attribute. Comparable means that the only way to 
effectively score an attribute is through comparing it to 
several other instances. Bounded relates to the possible 
inputs that can be associated to that attribute, which can be 
of any value but will always be between two points, i.e., 
maximum and minimum.

Not all the combinations described in Table III are 
possible to be applied together. Combination 1 cannot occur 
as attributes cannot be both Independent and Comparable 
due to these properties not aligning. Combinations 2 and 4 
are not possible as an Independent parameter that is also 
non-Bounded, would effectively change each time it is used 
and would therefore require older versions to be changed, 
making it none Independent. Finally, combinations 6 and 8 
are not possible as an attribute can be neither Independent 
nor Comparable, as they must be mutually exclusive. This 
leaves combinations 3, 5 and 7. Each of these combinations 
are derived to make a viable method of applying a score to 
attributes.

Each of the methods shown in Table IV will now be 
presented along with an example demonstrating their use.  
 
The first method, Absolute, is based on combination 
3 as shown in Table IV. In this, the attributes being 
reviewed can be dealt with in isolation and have no bearing 
on others of the same type, they do not require direct

be thought of as a simple selection between the possible

outcomes. For example, a question could be posed such as 
the number of geographical regions that a technology could 
enter; this would then be combined with six possible 
choices representing the number of regions. From this, the 
Reviewer would select that, which best fits the information 
they are presented with. 
 
 
Figure 2. Absolute Scoring Method 
 
As can be seen in Figure 2, the Absolute method has 
been coded in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate 
ease of use for the Reviewer such that they can arrive at the 
most valid result for the question asked. In this example, 
they are asked about the possible number of engagement 
opportunities for a development opportunity. A selection is 
then made, based on the descriptions matching the 
information presented.  
 
The second scoring method is the Balance method 
and is described by combination 7 in Table IV. The 
attributes being reviewed using this method cannot be 
treated independently; so, all previous values need updating 
for a new review. In addition, it is comparable and requires 
comparison to other values already reviewed and it is not 
bounded, so the values entered can be of any size. This 
method is used to evaluate financial attributes, due to their 
unbounded nature. The required process is more complex 
than the Absolute method due to several rules being 
followed to deliver a normalised final score per attribute. 
These are based on the concept of a normalised scale onto, 
which all attributes are scored. In principle, this can be 
thought of as a numbered scale ranging from a lower bound 
to a maximum with steps in between; one and five with 
incremental steps of one, for example. This would result in a 
normalised scale with five fixed positions (normalised 
scores). When a value is entered, from a calculation of cost 
for example, this new value is compared to all those already 
entered to deliver the normalised score. If this attribute is 
the first to be entered, it is assigned the middle position on 
the normalised scale, in the case of the one to five example 
given, this would result in a normalised score of three.  
When there are two attributes entered, these are assigned to 
the extremes of the normalised scale, resulting in one and 
five as normalised scores in the example given earlier. 
When additional values are entered, a calculation is required 
to achieve a certain normalised score. This value is called 
Step Change and is given by (7). 
 
𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑝 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 =  𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 − 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 ÷ 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑝𝑠  
 
With this value for Step Change, it is added onto the 
lowest value on the scale accumulatively until the maximum 
value is reached. Utilising these at each point on the 
normalised scale, all remaining entries are evaluated. In 
effect, these values form barriers for, which those entered 
must be larger than to progress to the next normalised score. 
 
Figure 3. Balance Scoring Method 
 
In Figure 3, the Balance methods GUI can be seen. 
This presents a question to the Reviewer along with a place 
to entered their calculation for cost of all resources for the 
application at hand.  
 
The final method is named Comparative, due to its 
structure necessitating comparisons. This method is for use 
with complex attributes or those that can be defined as 
“fuzzy” and are difficult to assign an absolute value on, 
which to base multiple perceptions of the same problem. To 
enable this method, the pairwise comparison process and 
underlying calculations of the Analytic Hierarchy Process 
(AHP) are utilised. Using these comparisons, it is easier to 
define preference between sets of options than defining 
absolute values. This is presented to the Reviewer through a 
series of comparisons based on a range of values 
representing the whole normalised scale in use. As with the 
Balance method, the normalised scale is defined between 
two values with a defined step size between them. The 
(7)

normalised scale is used once the values from the AHP are 
calculated, following the completion of the pairwise 
comparisons. All values of the AHP calculations can always 
be summed to 1. The normalisation process occurs with 
these scores. For this process, a number of rules are 
followed to deliver the normalised score. If there is only one 
value to review, the middle score on the normalised scale is 
automatically assigned. From here, values are assigned to 
the fixed positions on the normalised scale around the centre 
until all are filled. Next, the largest and smallest values are 
placed at the extremes of the normalised scale, with the 
remaining being evenly distributed between them. With this 
distribution complete, the values are rounded down to the 
next normalised score available. 
 
Figure 4. Comparative Scoring Method 
 
In Figure 4, the pairwise comparison method 
between combinations of opportunities with respect to a 
single attribute can be seen. To conduct the comparison, the 
slider for each pair is moved to one of the possible nine 
positions to demonstrate a level of preference between the 
opportunities based on the presented information in each 
case.

Using each of the three scoring methods, Absolute, 
Balance and Comparative, it is possible to review any 
attribute by appropriate selection, based on the three 
principles in Table IV. They can then result in reduced bias 
on the final scores calculated in each case, meaning a more 
repeatable and trustworthy outcome is reached.   
 
As shown in Table V, each attribute has a Scoring 
Method assigned to enable the review of captured 
information. These were selected based on the definition of 
each method shown in Table IV. 
 
Each of these reviews for the defined attributes is 
combined with a measure of uncertainty in relation to the 
conducted review. This measure of uncertainty allows for 
the review to consider the quality, amount and source of 
information. With this, a poor quality, inadequate or 
untrustworthy source can have its review score graded 
downwards so it does not have the same level of impact as 
that from an industry expert for example. This is based on 
work by [50]. In application, this is defined as “Certainty” 
in the review that has been conducted as shown in (8). The 
values entered by each Reviewer are utilised to weight down 
their respective scores.  
 
𝑏 = 𝑑 ∙  𝑐 ÷ 𝑔   
 
Where d is the calculated Certainty score, c is the 
selected Certainty by the Reviewer, g is the range of 
possible Certainty scores, d is the entered score by the 
Reviewer and b is the adjusted review score for Certainty.  
 
The level of certainty entered by the Reviewer can be 
seen in Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 at the bottom of each 
console. In each of these, the Reviewer selects from a five-
point scale with five representing complete confidence in 
the review completed and one being very low confidence. 
This is driven by the information they are presented with 
and the understanding it delivers in relation to the 
opportunity in question. 
C. Calculation and Use of Final Score and Ranking 
With this calculation for Certainty, the overall 
calculation for the final score for an application is as 
follows. It is important to note how the calculated scores are 
not done so in any specified units, with larger scores 
showing a more suitable application. The scores for each 
factor are calculated upon the completion of the entry for 
the grading for a proposed technological innovation. This is 
a summation for all values entered in relation to each factor 
to be used in the later calculation of the final score; this is 
demonstrated in (9). 
 
𝐸 = {𝑏 ∈ 𝑅|0 < 𝑏 ≤ 𝑟} 
 
𝜓 =  𝐸𝜓 
 
Where 𝜓 ∈ { 𝜃, 𝜄, 𝜅, 𝜆}

Where θ is Development Risk Aversion Score, ι is 
the Commercial Risk Aversion Score, κ is the Resource 
Spending Aversion Score and λ is the Payoff Expected 
Score. 
 
This is calculated based on the scores for each factor 
and its associated weight value using the WSM described 
earlier as shown in (10). 
 
𝐹 = 𝜃 ∙ 𝛼 + 𝜄 ∙ 𝛽 + 𝜅 ∙ 𝛾 + 𝜆 ∙ 𝛿  
 
  
Where F is the final score for the application.  
 
In addition, based on the certainty values entered 
earlier for each review, an overall certainty of the 
application is calculated. This demonstrates the potential 
variability of the final score based upon the values entered. 
The benefit is that when reviewing the results, the potential 
maximum and minimum score for an application can be 
seen; which can be used for deeper levels of comparison. 
This utilises the core method described in [50] and is 
demonstrated in (11) and (12). 
 
     
𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝐹 = 𝑤1 ∙ 𝑥1 
 
𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐶𝐹 = 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝐶𝐹 +  1 − 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝐶𝐹 ∙ (𝑤𝑖 ∙ 𝑥𝑖) 
 
𝑈𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑦 = 1 − 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝐹 
 
 
Where w is the weight between 1 and 0 and x is the 
value. The second calculation in the process is repeated as 
required based on the available weights and values. To 
utilise this method, the entered confidence values by each of 
the three Reviewers are averaged and then utilised in (10).  
 
 
ℎ = 𝑡 ∙ 𝜀 
𝑝 = ℎ +  1 − ℎ ∙  𝑦 ∙ 𝜁  
𝑞 = 𝑝 +  1 − 𝑝 ∙  𝑢 ∙ 𝜂  
𝑣 = 𝐹 ∙ 𝑞 
 
 
 
Where t ̅ is the Technology Expert average 
confidence, y ̅ is the Developer average confidence, u ̅ is the 
Manager average confidence, h is the initial Certainty 
calculation, p is the second Certainty calculation, q is the 
third Certainty calculation and v is the relative uncertainty. 
 
Based on these, results are calculated such as those in 
Figure 5. The examples shown are not from any particular 
commercial projects.   
 
 
 
Figure 5. Example Results Export 
 
The results from the calculations are shown in Figure 
5. The overall score from the Weighted Sum Model are 
given by the overall score from each bar and the results for 
each segment coming from the Scoring Factors. Onto each 
of these, the calculated certainty is added in the form of an 
error bar. In the example shown, there are several 
conclusions that can be drawn based on the overall scores 
and the sizes of each segment of the bars. For example, it 
can be seen how Application 3 shows significantly greater 
Commercial Viability than the other applications; whereas 
Application 5 shows the greatest Development Potential. It 
is these aspects that aid in the selection process, not only the 
overall score; therefore, the additional visibility that is 
delivered by this approach can be seen, making it more than 
a pure ranking of opportunities.  
 
A threshold is placed onto this, to demonstrate the 
potential development paths that carry the most worth and 
should therefore be considered by the company decision 
makers. This threshold is to be devised by the company 
using this approach such that the relevant number of 
opportunities are taken forwards for consideration. As with 
a greater number of suitable opportunities taken forwards, 
the chance for selecting the one that delivers the desired 
success increases. Considering the graph shown in Figure 5 
with a threshold set at 30, only the top three applications 
would be deemed to be worthy of consideration for the 
distribution of resources. In addition, Application 6 would 
be sitting on the threshold with Application 1 being close 
behind, showing clear potential but not sufficient to pass 
outright. Therefore, in this case, additional research would 
be required to deliver a clear indication one way or another.

Figure 6. Normalised Scores with applied Certainty 
Finally, Applications 2 and 7 would demonstrate a 
score to be significantly below that of the threshold, 
meaning these options should not selected for additional 
research to potentially increase their scores to a point 
whereby they could be considered. Using such a threshold, a 
clear indication can be given as to the opportunities worthy 
of consideration, as only picking that with the largest score 
is an unsuitable technique.   
 
In addition to the ability to present a ranking based 
around four scoring factors and the related certainty, further 
visibility of the cause of these scores is reached via a 
breakdown of the review and calculation stages.  
 
As shown in Figure 6, the individual scores per 
application and attribute can be seen. This increases the 
utility of this approach by delivering visibility of the exact 
attributes where an opportunity achieves better or worse 
scores than those they are being compared to. By presenting 
this information, the decision-making process can be further 
aided by demonstrating not only, which opportunity 
presents the greatest scores with respect to the Scoring 
Factors, but also, which particular attributes are responsible. 
This can aid in deciding between two opportunities with 
very similar overall scores. 
 
Overall, the proposed Decision Support System has 
been built into an application that provides a GUI to each 
identified role as to increase the ease of use. It has two user 
classes, Admin and Reviewer. The Admin class is 
responsible for setting profile weights, adding Reviewers 
and creating new opportunity investigations and assigning 
them to the appropriate Researcher and Reviewer. In a 
conventional implementation, the usage procedure would be 
as follows. 
 
Firstly, the Amin class of user is required to set up 
the Decision Support System for use. This involves defining 
the company position via the use of the weighting values. 
The weighting values are also required to be set for the 
Reviewers based on who will carry out the review process. 
From here, the development opportunities to be investigated 
are added and the Reviewers assigned. Following this, the 
Researcher will use the defined information capture 
procedure based on [11] and the expansion of the required 
attributes shown in Table I, to capture an understanding of 
the development opportunity at hand. From here, the 
Reviewers will deliver their scores by utilising the defined 
Scoring Methods outlined. Once this is completed, the final 
score and ranking will be automatically produced for 
exporting by the Admin class user. It is important to note, 
how the user experience alters, based upon their 
classification. 
Throughout 
the 
appendices, 
various 
screenshots are shown of the interface for the devised 
Decision Support System.   
IV. 
SYSTEM EVALUATION 
To evaluate the proposed Decision Support System, 
several internal evaluations were conducted within the 
SME. These involved most staff and utilised several 
previous opportunity investigations analysed by the 
proposed system. Due to these still being commercially 
sensitive, they cannot be discussed in detail. In addition, due 
to this confidentiality and the limitations in staff numbers, it 
is acknowledged that the population size used for this 
evaluation was limited, yet it represented most of the 
company. Two separate areas of evaluation were conducted; 
the first analysed the performance of the described scoring 
methods and the second focused on the acceptance and 
validity of the recommendations made by the Decision 
Support System. The evaluation of the scoring methods is 
limited to the Comparative method alone due to this being 
the most complex. The Absolute and Balance methods 
required simple selections or calculations of values to result 
in the Normalised Score.  
 
The first area of evaluation investigated the 
consistency of the Comparative method as this is the 
method used the most due to most attributes being complex 
and “fuzzy” in nature. To do this, a commonly used 
technique based on selecting a score from a set number of 
categories was compared to. For this, several opportunities 
were presented to several staff within the SME along with a 
defined set of categories to score them and the Comparative 
method. For both methods, scores were assigned to each of 
the five opportunities and also a position in a ranking. In the

case of the category based method, the scores were assigned 
utilising a set of criteria and the ranking based upon each 
opportunity being placed in positions 1 – 5. For the 
Comparative method, the scores were extracted from the 
method before normalisation and the final ranking was 
obtained following normalisation. As the Comparative 
method calculates the scores of each opportunity in a way 
that always sums to one, the scores assigned utilising the 
category based method would require normalisation to allow 
for comparison. This normalisation is shown in (13).

Where A is a matrix of entered score values, C is 
matrix for scaling each row and B is the normalised matrix. 
 
In addition, in several cases it was required that 
outliers were removed for effective statistical analysis. This 
was due to participants delivering scores or ranking values 
that were significantly different from the others, meaning 
direction comparisons and averaging was disrupted. For 
this, the Median Absolute Deviation method was utilised as 
this demonstrates significant robustness to outliers. The 
equation for this is given in (14). 
 
  𝑀𝐴𝐷({𝑌𝑖}𝑖=1⋯𝑁) = 𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛({|𝑌𝑖 − 𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛({𝑌𝑖}𝑖=1⋯𝑁)|}𝑖=1⋯𝑁)  
 
Where Y is a collection of numbers. 
 
To compare the results from each aspect of this 
evaluation, the participant’s scores and rankings were 
averaged; this allowed for direct method comparison 
between the two approaches. Averages were also conducted 
per method based on those from the previous step to show 
the overall similarities between methods. In addition, the 
participants were grouped together with respect to their 
roles within the SME. The scores and rankings entered were 
also averaged per role group to investigate if participants 
were like their colleagues from similar backgrounds and 
skillsets. In addition, following the completion of both 
aspects of this evaluation, several questions were asked of 
each participant in the form of a questionnaire to obtain 
their opinions about the process they just experienced. This 
will add further insight into the preference between the two 
methods and experience in use, even if the results from the 
comparisons prove inconclusive or unexpected in any way.  
 
For the presentation of evaluation results, the 
Category method is abbreviated to CAM and the 
Comparative method is abbreviated to COM. In addition, 
“WO/O” will stand for “Without Outliers”. 
 
Table VI. Application Score Variances with and without Outliers 
 
 
The results presented in Table VI lead to several 
conclusions about the two methods evaluated. Firstly, in the 
case where outliers were not removed, the category based 
method demonstrated consistently lower variance per 
application. This is due to the nature of the way the scores 
are selected for this approach being defined and can 
therefore only be of five possibilities in this case; whereas 
the Comparative method utilises a calculation approach 
based upon 90 possible positions of the sliders for the 
pairwise comparisons. This results in significantly more 
variability leading into the score calculations. In the second 
half of Table VI, several outliers are removed, resulting in 
more equality between the two methods. This demonstrates 
the sensitivity of the Comparative method in its calculations 
based upon the positions of the results of the pairwise 
comparisons.

In Table VII, the average ranking assigned to each

demonstrated by each method to have the lowest variance is 
roughly equal. However, the two applications whereby the 
Comparative 
method 
demonstrated 
lower 
variability 
(application 3 and 4) was significantly more so that the 
others; which were much closer between each method. This 
illustrates how these two cases were positioned more 
favourably during the pairwise comparisons by most of the 
SME’s participants. Again, the calculated ranking is shown 
to be sensitive to the increased number of positions in the

pairwise comparison, yet the average across all applications 
is very similar. This points towards each method being 
equally capable of being used for delivering consistent 
rankings over a wide range of participant backgrounds and 
skills.  
 
Table VIII. Participant Group Score Variance 
 
The results presented in Table VIII present the 
variance per participant group; in each of the groups, there 
are two participants. These results show how the category 
based method delivers increased consistency within the 
same participant groups, showing how similarly people 
view information based on their background and skillset. 
Again, this demonstrates the sensitivity of the Comparative 
method between positions selected by the user as to the 
score calculated.  
 
Table IX. Participant Group Ranking Positions 
 
In Table IX, the variance of the ranking positions 
calculated per participant group is shown; based upon the 
same groups as those used in Table VIII. Here, it can be 
seen how the Comparative method delivers repeatedly 
greater levels of consistency within participant groups than 
the category based method. This is due to the defined 
calculation process converting the scores entered by the 
participant into the normalised ranking. Whereas, using the 
category based approach, this is done manually, and 
therefore the difference in approaches becomes apparent.  
This therefore demonstrates the utility of this method in 
delivering consistent reviews over participants but the 
careful selection of those to deliver the review is important. 
Such a decision should be made by the company’s 
management prior to the evaluation based on availability, 
skillset and experience. This may also highlight to those 
selecting the Reviewers that the SME lacks in certain skills 
or experiences, and should endeavour to fill these gaps. 
 
This evaluation has resulted in understanding several 
aspects of the defined scoring method. Firstly, the delivery 
of scores is more sensitive than a category based approach, 
which is more commonly used, due to the increased number 
of possibilities the Reviewer can select. When viewing an 
entire population, containing those of several different 
backgrounds and skillsets, the resulting ranking is also less 
consistent. However, when comparing those of a similar 
background and skillset, the results become far more 
consistent. This case is far more likely in actual use, 
whereby those of a similar background and skillset are 
selected to review the same information for each 
opportunity, 
leading 
to 
increased 
consistency 
and 
comparability between cases. 
 
Following the scoring aspect of the evaluations, the 
participants were asked several questions in relation to their 
perception on the two presented methods of delivering 
scores and rankings in the form of a questionnaire. This 
specifically related to their preference between them and 
any problems they could foresee. The general feedback 
illustrated a perception that using the category based method 
would lead to difficulty with larger datasets. In addition, this 
method was noted to be more difficult to deploy, as the 
definition of each scoring category was not a perfect 
description of the opportunities for evaluation. Furthermore, 
participants noted how their internal definition of categories 
would differ between multiple Reviewers, reducing 
comparability. In relation to the Comparative method, this 
was better received due to the ease of use and the reduced 
comprehension required for the application of scores. This 
was due to the configuration necessitating only a 
comparison to other opportunities. It was also perceived that 
this approach would lead to increase consistency due to the 
defined approach. However, during the evaluation it was 
noted to be more consistent, but only when compared to 
those of a similar background. Nonetheless, this would be 
more representative of an actual implementation, with those 
from similar backgrounds reviewing the same information 
attributes, leading to greater consistency and comparability. 
 
The next stage of the evaluation focused on the 
acceptance of the resulting ranking and the success 
experienced by those opportunities selected to be taken 
forwards based upon the Decision Support Systems 
recommendations. To conduct this evaluation, a semi-
formal interview process, driven via the use of a 
questionnaire, was conducted with the SME’s decision 
maker, the Managing Director. For this, questions were 
asked in relation to the created ranking, the ease of 
understanding, successes of selected opportunities and 
changes that would be made in hindsight.  
 
Based on presented results rankings from the 
proposed Decision Support System, clear understanding 
could be attained as to the position of opportunities within 
the ranking. This also included where each opportunity was 
positioned within the ranking and the aspects leading to this, 
based upon the four scoring factors. Furthermore, the 
uncertainty presented indicated to the Managing Director, 
which opportunities were the riskiest, due to the size of the 
error bar. It was also noted how succinct information on

each opportunity would be required alongside the graphical 
information to make a decision. Furthermore, it would also 
be required to include aspects of day-to-day operations in 
comparison to these development opportunities to decide on 
how to proceed. These points illustrate trust in the presented 
information and a utility to the decision-making process, but 
the necessity for several additions in the future.  
 
The second element of this evaluation was to gauge 
the success of the opportunities selected to be taken 
forwards because of the recommendations made. This 
would be utilised to evaluate whether they were the right 
decisions in retrospect. Over the course of the Decisions 
Support Systems development, two opportunities were 
selected to be taken forwards. One was a software add-on to 
the SME’s existing product range, with the other becoming 
a project made up of several individual opportunities that 
were closely related. Since introduction, the software add-on 
has experienced significant industrial attention but with 
slow adoption, increasing from 2 sales in year 1 to 18 by the 
end of the second quarter of year 3. This means an 
accumulative value of approximately £130k, not including 
additional system costs. The Managing Director noted how 
this new product has received significant attention, which is 
promising, yet it has not converted into sufficient orders to 
generate the desired revenue. This was judged to be due to 
there being limited features as a part of this offering, 
resulting in aspects of the related tests being incompatible 
with the current offering. For it to be considered a complete 
success it was noted that this offering would be required to 
increase its capabilities to encompass the remaining features 
and to result in a step change in orders to match the 
industrial attention observed.  
 
The second opportunity taken forwards, comprised 
of several related opportunities, was selected on the promise 
of creating a new business segment for the SME and 
offering significant returns due to displacing existing 
technologies noted to have several limitations. However, 
due to the resource constraints of the SME, funding was 
sought from an external source. This funding was not 
obtained due to the competition nature of the funding 
source; meaning this project has progress little past an 
extended evaluation of the technology and market. Yet the 
Managing Director still viewed this selection as the right 
course of action, given the information available and 
recommendations made. It was also viewed to be the path to 
take these applications forwards as a group rather than 
individually as these would present the greatest return in this 
way; while offering an increased number of avenues to 
investigate for taking this project forwards.  
 
Finally, 
the 
main 
outcome 
was 
that 
both 
opportunities were selected, utilising the recommendations 
made, aligning with those making the company decisions. 
As yet neither has progressed to the point desired due to the 
ability of the SME to fund and advance these products to the 
desired stage. Therefore, the potential success of the 
selected business opportunities is a constraint of the SME 
rather than of the Decision Support System. To more 
accurately analyse the recommendations made, a more time 
would be required for those opportunities already selected 
and for a greater number of new ones to also be selected and 
progress to market. Following this, a more in-depth analysis 
can be conducted. 
V. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
Based on the Decision Support System presented, 
several conclusions can be drawn. The underlying structure 
used [11], delivered the process required for companies such 
as 
the 
SME 
for 
the 
investigation 
of 
innovation 
opportunities. Using this in combination with the 
ethnographic process for this work, several enhancements 
and additions were made to the information capture process 
to increase the overall company knowledge in relation to an 
opportunity. This structure also highlighted the requirement 
for the decision point to come after the capture of 
information, using defined scoring methods. The advantage 
of this is that decisions can be made based on like-for-like 
information due to each opportunity having the same points 
researched.  
 
Using the defined scoring methods, the same 
attributes from different potential opportunities can be 
directly compared after conversion into a numerical form on 
the 
same 
normalised 
scale. 
This 
can 
deliver 
an 
understanding of where certain opportunities are stronger 
than others. Secondly, it is very flexible for the company, as 
any attribute can be scored using the outlined methods. 
Therefore, only the information that is important to the 
company is analysed. The approach also diminishes the 
impact of subjectivity on the final score. By defining the 
review process to be one of three methods, the results found 
from different points of view should be very similar; 
meaning consistent results can be achieved irrespective of 
who is conducting the review. Bias and personal influence 
can also be minimised as the final score is not created based 
on discussion but rather the generation of numerical scores. 
However, there is the chance for outliers in the scoring 
process, more commonly seen from those from unsuitable 
backgrounds or skillsets.    
 
These 
scoring 
methods 
individually 
deliver 
significant capabilities to the decision-making process by 
converting all attributes to the same scale for direct 
comparison. This is extended further through the addition of 
information certainty. This allows for the calculated score to 
be effectively weighted down, depending on the confidence 
of the Reviewer in the information presented. The advantage 
this delivers is that untrustworthy information will not have 
the same level of impact on the calculation of the scores and 
ranking as that from a reputable source. This achieves a

greater level of control over the score and ranking and 
reduces the influence of poor information. 
 
The scores calculated, and weighting values entered 
are then combined using the Weighted Sum Model. This 
simpler approach allows for the utilisation of calculated 
values and measures representing the company in place of 
weights, to result in a final score. The advantage of this is 
the visibility of the scores calculated and therefore the final 
position in the ranking, delivering traceability.  
 
With the final score and ranking calculated via the 
defined scoring methods, certainty values and the Weighted 
Sum Model, a threshold can be applied. This reflects the 
company’s position, as the decision threshold value can be 
set at the appropriate level. For companies with limited 
resources, such as SMEs [9], this threshold level can be 
increased such that potential development projects have to 
display a higher level of certainty of success before 
considering 
them. 
This 
threshold 
completes 
the 
recommendations made by this Decision Support System by 
indicating those opportunities that should be taken forwards 
for a selection process. This can be implemented by any 
SME in a similar position through stages of capturing 
information, defining their company position, profiling the 
Reviewers, scoring the information and certainty and 
applying a threshold to the final score and ranking.  
 
Concluding, 
we 
could 
firstly 
say 
that 
the 
Comparative method demonstrates increased sensitivity in 
relation to the scores, due to the number of positions 
possible during use. However, due to the defined nature of 
the normalisation process, these scores are converted into a 
more consistent ranking in comparison to those of a similar 
background. This is representative of a real-life application 
whereby those reviewing the same information would be 
assigned this due to their experience and background. 
Finally, the recommendations delivered are understandable 
and trustworthy within the environment where this Decision 
Support System was created. In addition, those opportunities 
recommended to be taken forwards displayed reasonable 
levels of success given the ability of the SME to fund their 
development.  
 
There can be seen to be several ways this Decision 
Support System has deliver impact to the SME and has 
potential to the wider field. To the SME, the internal 
product assessment procedure has been changed, to include 
the structure demonstrated by the Decision Support System. 
This restructures their information capturing efforts in 
relation to innovation opportunities, the review of this 
information, and the decision processes. Altogether this has 
delivered a more professional assessment process over the 
conventional ad-hoc approach commonplace with SMEs 
without burdening them with unnecessary activities. To the 
wider field, this Decision Support System and its 
information 
capture 
method 
can 
deliver 
several 
improvements. The defined information capturing process 
results in directly comparable opportunities due to the same 
attributes for each being understood. These can then be 
reviewed by a defined scoring method, irrelevant of their 
type. The calculation method offers simplistic creation of a 
representative score for the opportunity, based on the results 
of the scoring methods and the representatives of a 
company. Overall, this results in a complete modelling and 
assessment of opportunities to hand. Therefore, the 
approach outlined in this work forms a practical method to 
investigate, evaluate and select from available opportunities 
to direct a company’s innovation activities.
