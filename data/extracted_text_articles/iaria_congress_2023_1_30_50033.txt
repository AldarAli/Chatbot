Abstract— This paper examines the self-presentation and self-
disclosure practices of cloud services users that relate to the 
social group they belong to, through a quantitative survey 
addressed to the student population of three Universities in 
Greece, England, and Spain. Findings provide valuable 
insights regarding social identity-based users’ practices and 
indicate important information for the design of self-adaptive 
privacy schemes within cloud services, setting specific social 
requirements based on users’ social groups belonging.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Cloud services have significantly expanded in current 
society, transforming the way individuals and organizations 
store, access, and manage their data and applications. They 
often offer integration and interoperability capabilities, 
allowing different applications and systems to communicate 
and work together seamlessly, indicating the new notion of 
the Internet of Cloud [1]. This facilitates the exchange of 
data and information across platforms, enabling real-time 
collaboration, sharing, and communication among several 
team members regardless of their physical locations. Thus, 
the potential challenges and concerns associated with the 
expansion of cloud services are immense, such as data 
privacy and security, vendor lock-in and regulatory 
compliance [2]. Organizations and individuals should 
carefully evaluate their specific requirements and consider 
the 
appropriate 
privacy 
measures 
and 
service-level 
agreements when adopting cloud services [3]. Towards these 
requirements and measures, the notion of social identity has 
been indicated as an important factor that influences 
individuals' privacy preferences and concerns [4].  Social 
identity refers to the way individuals perceive themselves in 
relation to various social groups they belong to. The forming 
of these groups can include factors, such as nationality, 
ethnicity, gender, religion, profession, or interests [5]. Cloud 
services provide individuals with opportunities to express 
and project their social identities to others through profiles, 
content sharing, and interactions. People often join groups or 
follow pages related to their social identities, fostering a 
sense of belonging and connection. In this regard, social 
identity plays a key role in how individuals present 
themselves and manage their online image within cloud 
services [6]. Different social groups may have varying 
attitudes towards self-presentation and self-disclosure 
practices [7]. However, the nature of self-disclosure on cloud 
services raises privacy concerns, as individuals need to 
consider the potential risks associated with sharing personal 
information publicly [8]. Respectively, the variety of 
attitudes within cloud services concerns privacy as well, such 
as prioritizing the protection of personal information or 
embracing a more open approach. People may strategically 
disclose or withhold personal information in order to shape 
their online identity and project a desired image that aligns 
with their social identity and the desired/intended impression 
they want to create. They may share personal milestones, 
hobbies, achievements, opinions, or emotions, while 
choosing to keep other aspects of themselves and their lives 
private. Social identity can shape the norms and expectations 
around privacy within specific social groups. Group 
members may have shared understandings of what 
information is appropriate to share, the level of privacy they 
expect, and the consequences of privacy breaches. These 
group norms and the values associated with them can shape 
members’ 
privacy 
preferences 
and 
may 
influence 
individuals' privacy management practices and decisions [9]. 
Privacy 
management, 
in 
this 
context, 
involves 
considering what information to disclose and how it aligns 
with individuals’ social identity and desired impression. 
Users may employ privacy settings and controls to manage 
their self-disclosure and control who can access their shared 
content. Towards this, self-adaptive privacy measures and 
techniques have been indicated as an effective approach. 
Self-adaptive privacy in cloud computing refers to the ability 
of cloud systems to dynamically adjust privacy measures 
based on specific requirements and preferences of individual 
users or organizations. It involves tailoring privacy controls, 
mechanisms, and policies to meet the unique privacy needs 
of different users and data types [10]. In this regard, self-
adaptive privacy aims at empowering users by giving them 
greater control over their privacy. It provides users with 
visibility into how their data is being handled within the 
cloud, offering transparency into privacy practices, and 
enabling informed decision-making [11]. Considering that

privacy management is changing based on users’ social 
groups, several social factors and attributes play a significant 
role in self-adaptive privacy approaches. These factors 
influence the design, implementation, and acceptance of self-
adaptive privacy mechanisms and practices. Thus, as 
previous research indicates, these factors are usually hard to 
be identified or are neglected during systems’ design [12]. 
Recent studies have focused on developing algorithmic 
implementations of such self-privacy adaptation methods 
that pay attention to users’ individual attributes or context 
[13][14] and not on groups’ norms, while other work 
concentrates on the user interface mechanism to adopt such 
adaptations in order to be protected [15].  
Therefore, supporting that not only individuals’ social 
attributes should be examined but social groups as well, this 
paper examines critical issues about users' social groups 
within cloud services related to their self-presentation and 
self-disclosure practices. Specifically, we aim to identify 
relevant determinants, based on each social group, of self-
disclosure practices within the cloud. To gather the required 
data, a survey was conducted among the students of three 
Universities in Greece, England, and Spain. The findings 
from this study contribute to valuable insights regarding 
users’ practices based on their belonging to a group and 
provide important information for the design of usable and 
self-adaptive privacy features within the cloud, since they 
promote specific privacy requirements based on users’ social 
identity and groups, considering adaptation on a basis of 
group privacy management. Section II presents the research 
field, the methodology followed, and the implemented 
instrument. In Section III, the results of our survey are 
outlined, indicating users’ self-presentation and self-
disclosure practices. Section IV discusses and concludes the 
main findings, raising future research directions and practical 
implications.  
II. 
METHODOLOGY 
Supporting the arguments above suggesting that social 
identity pertains to how individuals shape their attitudes and 
behaviors within various domains of activity [5], the 
following 
foundational 
research 
question 
has 
been 
formulated to guide our study: RQ “Is belonging in a social 
group affecting users’ self-presentation and self-disclosure 
practices?” To address that, the research population selected 
for this study included the students of three Universities in 
Greece, England, and Spain: University of the Aegean,  
University of Bournemouth, and University of Malaga, 
respectively. The survey was administered to undergraduate, 
postgraduate, and doctoral students. Due to its diverse nature 
in terms of geographical location and demographics, the 
research population holds significant potential for providing 
respected insights regarding users’ disclosure practices 
within cloud-based services. It focuses on the domain of 
social media as the aforementioned cloud environments have 
been pointed out in the study as the handiest in users’ 
everyday online practices. To ensure access to a substantial 
portion of the research population and facilitate the 
generalizability of results [16], a quantitative approach was 
chosen, and a structured questionnaire was developed. The 
researchers opted for the Hellenic Statistical Authority’s 
categorizations when determining the values for measuring 
users’ socio-demographics across their survey in order to 
ensure reliability, representativeness, and transparency. All 
items were compiled from previous literature and, in 
particular, participants were asked to identify the groups to 
which they belong within cloud services using a social 
identity taxonomy that aligns with the work of [17]. This 
taxonomy encompassed a range of group categories, 
including 15 types of groups, such as leisure groups, well-
being groups, professional groups, and other user-indicated 
groups. In order to ensure the reliability and validity of our 
instrument, a comprehensive review of the literature for self-
presentation and self-disclosure practices was conducted. 
This review allowed us to incorporate validated metrics from 
previous studies [18] - [21] on self-presentation and 
information disclosure into our instrument. These concerned 
15 items, as follows: “I share personal information, I share 
photos of myself, I share information about my family, I 
share information about my friends, I share information 
about my job, I share information about my hobbies, I share 
information about my daily activities, I share information 
regarding my sexuality, I share religion-related views, I 
share information about my political views, I state my 
location, I update my status, I include contact information 
(e.g. email, links to other profiles, personal web pages, 
mobile number, postal address), I have included a short cv in 
my profile, I tag others in the photos I share”.  
Moreover, the instrument included a set of six questions 
aiming 
at 
capturing 
participants' 
socio-demographic 
characteristics based on previous work [22]. These questions 
encompassed gender, age, family structure, educational level, 
professional 
experience, 
and 
monthly 
income. 
By 
incorporating these questions in the final part of the 
instrument, participants had the time required to complete it 
more effectively. Prior to distributing the questionnaire to the 
research population, a pilot study was conducted with a 
sample of 60 students from the three universities. The 
purpose of this pilot study was to test the instrument for its 
form, language, clarity, difficulty level, and responsiveness 
to respondents' interests, leading to the necessary revisions to 
the questionnaire items. The survey was conducted using 
Google Forms, which allowed for direct distribution via 
email. In the introductory note of the survey, the purpose, 
procedure, and ethical considerations were clearly explained, 
adhering to established research ethics and standards [23]. 
The collected data was then recoded and processed using 
IBM SPSS Statistics 28 (SPSS28). 
III. 
RESULTS 
Out of the 368 responses received, thorough checks for 
completeness were performed, resulting in 280 valid 
responses being included in the analysis. The survey 
involved more women than men, while a small percentage 
declared a different gender. Despite the distribution of ages, 
the majority was in the age group of 18–32. Regarding 
family structure, the nuclear form dominates, while it is quite 
interesting that some of the responders preferred not to 
provide an answer.  Most of the participants held a Master’s

diploma, and 92% of the respondents have professional 
experience of at least 1-5 years.  The majority declared a 
relatively low monthly income, ranging from 301 to 800€. 
Participants’ individual attributes, presented in detail in the 
following Table 1, are associated with their level of social 
capital [24], setting the standard for a better understanding of 
users’ self-categorization procedure in order to formulate 
their social identity and define their perceptions and 
willingness to belong to a social group.

The findings of our survey indicate that participants 
declare belonging to various social groups when adopting 
cloud services, namely: Companionships group (33.9%), 
Professional group (11.3%), Political group (3.1%), Trade 
union group (2.4%), Voluntary group (8.1%), Sport group 
(7.7%), Leisure group (11.7%), Cultural group (5.9%), 
Human Support group (1.5%), Scientific group (2.9%), 
Environmental group (2.3%), Mutual Support group (1.1%), 
Religious group (2%), Technological Interest group (3.1%) 
and Gender equality group (3.2%). Previous research has 
already suggested that individuals who possess multiple 
social identities are shaping their behaviors, respectively, 
within specific contexts [25]. In this regard and in order to 
check whether participation in a specific social group is 
associated with specific self-presentation and information 
disclosure practices, the chi-square test for two nominal 
dichotomous variables was used. Results are shown in Table 
2, as follows.

Results show that there are statistically significant 
associations between the nominal variables of “group 
participation” and “self-presentation and information 
disclosure practices”, highlighting that the group in which 
one chooses to participate is related to the practices that 
she/he chooses or avoids for self-presentation. Most of the 
associations were revealed for users’ self-presentation and 
information 
disclosure 
practices 
on 
Messenger 
(25 
associations) and Instagram (22 associations), less on 
Facebook (15 associations) and few (1-2) on What’s Up and 
Google services. These results are not surprising, considering 
that the cumulative percent of participants using “once daily” 
and “several times daily” Messenger, Instagram and 
Facebook are, according to the results of the research, high 
(78.3%, 70.2% and 61.9%, respectively). 
The majority of associations were positive with the 
exception of fifteen (15) negative revealed in the case of 
participating in specific types of groups (mainly trade-union, 
professional, technological interest, scientific, voluntary, 
cultural, environmental) and for specific social media, 
mostly Instagram and less Messenger. Although the negative 
associations refer to nine (9) different practices, more 
negative associations were revealed for practices including 
photos sharing (“I share photos of myself” and “I tag others 
in the photos I share”) and for practices referring to hobbies 
and daily activities information sharing. This finding implies 
that the aforementioned practices are considered rather 
inappropriate by people participating in professional groups 
or groups that serve specific interests. Moreover, results 
revealed that those participating in companionship groups 
use more self-disclosure practices compared to others 
participating in other type of groups, which is explicable 
considering the more open goal of participation and the 
expected benefits from self-disclosure. Results also revealed 
that the self-presentation practices more used (or avoided) by

people according to the type of group they belong, and the 
media context, were that of sharing information about 
hobbies (12 associations, 3 of them negative) and photos 
sharing of oneself (9 associations, 3 of them negative). 
IV. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
As the findings above indicate, social belonging in a 
group 
affects 
users’ 
self-disclosure 
practices 
and, 
respectively, influences their privacy preferences. Self-
disclosure on cloud services contributes to users’ digital 
footprints, leaving a trace of their activities, interests, and 
interactions [26]. Thus, findings highlighted that users who 
share a similar social identity based on companionship, feel 
more comfortable disclosing personal information and 
photos within cloud services and particularly within social 
media. However, other users emphasizing certain aspects of 
their identity, mostly the professional based ones, and 
downplaying the others, declared to be mindful of their 
social identity presentation and self-disclosure on social 
media, considering the potential consequences and impacts 
on their privacy, well-being, and relationships. Evidently, 
previous research has shown that this digital footprint can 
have implications for reputation management, online 
perception, and potential consequences in both personal and 
professional contexts [27]. In this regard, the identification of 
social groups' self-disclosure practices on the cloud can have 
a significant impact on the design and implementation of 
self-adaptive privacy schemes, in order for users to be aware 
of privacy settings, critically evaluate the information shared, 
and maintain a balance between online and offline identities 
which can contribute to a more positive and authentic online 
presence. Considering that social groups’ norms serve as 
guidelines for users and societies to navigate privacy 
boundaries and expectations, contributing to the preservation 
of personal autonomy, dignity, and trust [28], the 
identification of the practices that lead to specific group-
based needs is of great importance.  Since self-adaptive 
privacy in cloud services seeks to strike a balance between 
data utility and privacy protection, by tailoring privacy 
measures to users’ needs and dynamically adapting to 
changing circumstances [29], users’ empowerment can be 
enhanced when self- adaptive privacy schemes from the 
beginning of the design take into account groups preferences 
and the balance between maintaining privacy and 
participating in social interactions within one's social identity 
networks. Furthermore, incorporating the understanding of 
social groups' self-disclosure practices into the concept of 
"privacy by design" methodologies, such as the extended 
PriS framework for cloud computing services [30] that 
should be used for designing self-adaptive privacy schemes, 
can help ensure that privacy considerations are embedded in 
the development process of cloud services. Despite the 
limitations of our survey, concerning the weak strength of 
association of the nominal-by-nominal relationships (Phi 
coefficient takes values between 0 and +/-1), our results 
indicate the diversity of self-disclosure practices across 
different social groups, providing a guide for specific social 
requirements that could be integrated from the initial design 
stages of self-adaptive privacy schemes. In this respect, the 
defining of the self-disclosure practices can influence the 
establishment of privacy defaults in cloud platforms. In 
Figure 1, these practices are visualized by group and cloud 
service, aiming to aid the self-adaptive privacy schemes 
designed to be aligned with the preferences of social groups 
by setting initial privacy defaults that reflect their common 
practices and expectations.  
 
Figure 1.  Social Requirements for Self-Adaptive Privacy Schemes in 
Cloud based on Social Groups’ self disclosure practices.  
Since the insights into social groups' self-disclosure 
practices can inform the design process, this knowledge can 
enable in particular the design of contextual privacy settings. 
These settings can dynamically adjust privacy levels based 
on the specific context or situation, taking into account 
groups’ preferences in order, for example, to be more 
restrictive for the information of the professional groups, 
while more permissive for companionship or leisure groups. 
Finally, the provided insights into the self-disclosure 
practices can enhance the transparency and consent 
mechanisms in the self-adaptive privacy schemes. Users can 
be provided with clear and understandable information about 
how their data will be used, shared, and stored on the cloud, 
allowing them to make informed decisions and providing 
meaningful consent based on their social group norms. 
Therefore, users will be provided with control and agency 
over their information and with respect to their individual 
privacy preferences, reducing the risk of unintentional 
oversharing or undersharing.
