Abstract—The objective of our paper is to improve efﬁciency
(in terms of throughput or system capacity) for mobile satellite
communications. In this context, we propose an enhanced Hybrid
Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) for delay tolerant services.
Our proposal uses the estimation of the mutual information. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed method for a land
mobile satellite channel by means of simulations. Results are
compared with those obtained with a classical incremental re-
dundancy (IR) HARQ scheme. The technique we propose, shows
a better performance in terms of efﬁciency while maintaining an
acceptable delay for services.
Keywords—Hybrid ARQ; Satellite Communications; Land Mo-
bile Satellite (LMS) Channel; Delay; Efﬁciency.
I. INTRODUCTION
For many years, mobile satellite communications services
are challenging and very costly. Land mobile satellite (LMS)
channels are highly affected by important propagation impair-
ments (time-selective channel) and inter/intra system interfer-
ence, that both cause unstable and low signal to noise ratio
(SNR), which the receivers have to cope with. This usually
implies strong limitations on the delivered service throughput,
whatever the considered satellite frequency band.
Our objective is to propose a mechanism, which improves
the efﬁciency of link usage while providing an appropriate
service to applications. The targeted services (data transfer
from sensors, messages for aeronautical services, etc.) are
assumed to be tolerant to delay. For example some aeronautical
services deﬁne delay requirement for the delivery of 95% of
messages [1].
To deal with problems caused by link characteristics in
mobile satellite communications, there are many solutions.
One of these solutions is to use pure Forward Error Correction
(FEC), which can makes the message very robust. However
using FEC is not sufﬁcient sometimes, due to the highly
varying channel, where its quality changes dramatically. This
make it difﬁcult sometimes to decode the message, even if
the used code is very robust. Alternatively, Automatic Repeat
reQuest (ARQ) can be used as a solution to deal with channel
variations, where transmitter attempts many retransmissions in
case of unsuccessful decoding. ARQ messages without FEC,
are not so robust to ensure a reliable communication.
Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) protocols are used in most of re-
cent terrestrial wireless communication systems. Worldwide
interoperability for microwave access (WIMAX) and long
term evolution (LTE) are examples of these systems that
use HARQ [2]. There are many types of HARQ techniques.
HARQ type I is called chase combining (CC). The receiver
asks the transmitter for the transmission of the same packet
of coded data. At the receiver, the decoder combines the
multiple copies of the transmitted packet weighted by the
SNR received. HARQ type II, is also called incremental
redundancy (IR). Unlike the previous method, which transmits
simple repetitions of the same encoded packets, IR technique
transmits additional redundant information in an incremental
way if the decoding does not succeed from the ﬁrst trans-
mission. If each retransmission packet is self-decodable this
scheme is called type III HARQ [3]. Classical IR HARQ,
which transmits a ﬁxed number of bits at each transmission,
is not optimal from the efﬁciency point of view even if it can
improve the decoding delay especially for high values of SNR.
However, choosing optimal values for number of bits to be
sent at each transmission can improve the system performance
and throughput level. Many papers has proposed methods to
choose an optimal number of bits at each transmission, a
theoretical basis for a parity bits selection by means of a risk-
sensitive optimal control is established in [4]. The idea of
random transmission assignments of the mother code bits was
introduced in [5]. An optimized IR HARQ schemes based on
punctured LDPC codes over the BEC was proposed in [6].
Contrarily to classical IR HARQ scheme, the main idea
of our enhanced HARQ technique is to estimate the average
number of bits to be transmitted at each transmission to decode
the codeword with a targeted probability. This probability
depends on the application/service (delay constraints). This
technique uses the mutual information to predict the mean
number of bits needed for each transmission. It uses the knowl-
edge of the statistical distribution of the channel attenuation.
Our enhanced HARQ transmission proposal is simulated in a
satellite communications environment, where an LMS channel
and a long Round-Trip time are considered.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section
II describes the channel capacity and the LMS channel model.

We present classical IR HARQ in Section III. In Section IV,
we propose an enhanced HARQ model for delay tolerant
services in mobile communications. We present the results
of simulations and we compare the performance of both
techniques (classical IR and enhanced HARQ) in Section V.
We conclude our study in Section VI.
II. CHANNEL MODELLING
In our study on mobile satellite communications, we con-
sidered an LMS channel to model this environment [7] [8]. In
the following, we explain how to compute the capacity of this
channel.
A. Channel capacity and Mutual Information
Channel capacity C quantiﬁes the maximum achievable
transmission rate of a system communicating over a band-
limited channel, while maintaining an arbitrarily low error
probability. It corresponds to the maximum of the mutual in-
formation between the input and output of the channel, where
the maximization is done with respect to the input distribution.
Mutual information (MI) measures the information that input
of the channel (X) and output of the channel (Y ) share. It is a
key parameter in our approach, as it will be used to calculate
the mean number of bits needed to decode a message at each
transmission with a given probability.
Given the channel input symbol xi, its energy Esi, a
realisation of noise ni (which has a Gaussian distribution
with variance N0
2 ) and the channel attenuation ρi, the channel
output symbol yi can be written as:
yi = ρi
p
Esixi + ni.
(1)
For an equally distributed input probability, the MI corre-
sponds to the capacity of the channel, which is AWGN, can
be calculated by the following equation [9]:

more than 2 states);

(t =
(t[1], ..., t[N]));

simulations (Code rate 1/6, with a maximum of 4 retransmissions).
• dmi =

N0 (xm − xi) (xi it is an input symbol).
For the rest of the paper, we deﬁne MIreq as the average MI
per bit required to decode a codeword at a given probability
expressed in Word Error Rate (WER). MIreq can be calculated
using the mutual information function (2) and the performance
curves giving the WER versus Es/N0 of the used modula-
tion/coding scheme [10]. By using these performance curves,
we can deduce the Es/N0 necessary to obtain a given WER.
Then we use this value of Es/N0 in the mutual information
function (2) to obtain the mutual information required to
decode a codeword at this given WER. The prediction of
performance of the WER based on MI is quite classical, and
has been described and validated in [11].
From now on, to compute the mutual information we use
(2), Es
N0 is replaced by ρ2
i
Es
N0 , where Es
N0 is the average energy
per symbol.
B. LMS Channel
One of the reference propagation models for LMS channel
is a statistical model based on a three state Markov chain [7].
This model considers that the received signal originates from
the sum of two components: the direct signal and the diffuse
multipath. The direct signal is assumed to be log-normally
distributed with mean α (decibel relative to LOS (Line Of
Sight)) and standard deviation Ψ (dB), while the multipath
component follows a Rayleigh distribution characterized by its
average power, MP (decibel relative to LOS). This model is
called Loo distribution [8] [12]. For the modelling of the LMS
channel in our simulations, we use attenuation time series
using a propagation simulator based on the three state channel
[7] [8] provided by CNES. Using this tool we calculate the
distribution of the probability to obtain an attenuation in the
channel for a given environment.
III. INCREMENTAL REDUNDANCY HARQ
IR HARQ can be described as follows. The sender transmits
a number of bits that correspond to a given codeword. After
receiving the feedback (ACK/NACK) from the receiver, the
transmitter decides to no longer send bits corresponding to
this codeword if an ACK is received, or to send more parity
bits if a NACK is received. The number of bits to be sent in
the next retransmission is ﬁxed at each transmission. These
numbers of bits are chosen without any knowledge about
the channel quality or the global channel characteristics. If
the cumulative received sequence can not be decoded after
a maximum number of bits transmitted, the transmitter stops
sending bits that correspond to this codeword. The parity bits

are generated according to a coding scheme with a code rate
corresponding to the maximum number of bits that can be
transmitted per codeword. Bits to be sent at each transmission
are part of the original codeword (mother code), leading to a
different code rate at each transmission (see Figure 1). This
technique of transmission is somehow similar to puncturing.
Data bits of each codeword must be kept at the buffer of
the sender as long as the codeword is still not decoded or
the transmitter has not decided to end the transmission. At
the receiver side, the LLRs (Log Likelihood Ratio) of the
received symbols of each codeword are kept in the buffer as
long as the codeword is not decoded or the transmission of
the corresponding bits has not ended. An overview of ARQ
and HARQ mechanisms implemented or proposed in beyond
3rd generation systems was presented in [2].
IV. ENHANCED HARQ FOR DELAY TOLERANT SERVICES
IN MOBILE SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS
In this section, we propose an enhanced HARQ model using
mutual information. In our scheme, the computation of the
numbers of bits to be transmitted at each transmission is done
in a way that insures the decoding with a probability. These
probabilities are predeﬁned for each transmission and chosen
according to delay constraints of the application.
In the following, we explain how to proceed to compute
the number of bits required to decode a codeword with a
predeﬁned probability, supposing the knowledge of the global
statistics of the channel.
A. Enhanced HARQ Model
Our proposal uses the MI to compute the number of bits to
be transmitted at each transmission. After transmitting some
bits of a given codeword, this codeword accumulates some
mutual information. This mutual information can be computed
knowing the number of bits transmitted and the attenuation
coefﬁcient affecting the transmitted bits. In this model we
consider a reference Es/N0, which is a ﬁxed value of Es/N0
in clear sky (for a given terminal and without attenuation).
The model assumes that the channel is stationary for the
transmission time of the bits, at a given transmission for a
given codeword. The MI obtained at the jth transmission for
a given codeword can be computed as:
MI(j) = N (j)
sent.MI((ρ(j))2. Es
N0
),
(3)
where:
• ρ(j) is the attenuation coefﬁcient affecting bits transmitted
at the jth transmission for a given codeword;
• N (j)
sent is the number of bits transmitted at the jth trans-
mission;
• MI(·) is the function giving the value of mutual infor-
mation for a given Es/N0 on a gaussian channel.
The MI per bit accumulated for a given codeword, from the
beginning of transmission until the jth transmission, can be
computed as:
MI(j)
acc = N (j−1)MI(j−1)
acc
+ MI(j)
N (j)
,
(4)
where:
• N (j) is the total number of bits transmitted for a code-
word up to the jth transmission;
• MI(0)
acc=0.
Note that ρ(j) is unknown in our model, thus MI(j)
acc is also
unknown.
Let us consider MI(j+1)
needed the minimum MI per bit needed
to decode the codeword at the (j + 1)th transmission with a
predeﬁned decoding probability.
Let N (j+1)
needed be the number of bits to be transmitted at the
(j + 1)th transmission, we have:
NbitsMIreq = N (j)MI(j)
acc + N (j+1)
neededMI(j+1)
needed ,
(5)
where Nbits is the maximum number of bits that can be
transmitted for a codeword in total.
Finally N (j+1)
needed is given by:
N (j+1)
needed = NbitsMIreq − N (j)MI(j)
acc
MI(j+1)
needed
.
(6)
MI(j+1)
needed and MI(j)
acc are the key parameters for the com-
putation of the number of bits to be sent at the (j + 1)th
transmission. In the following, we explain in detail how to
proceed to calculate these two values at each transmission
according to the predeﬁned decoding probabilities.
B. Computation of MI(j+1)
needed and MI(j)
acc
In a ﬁrst step, we will explain how to calculate MI(j+1)
needed,
then we ﬁnish by explaining the way we compute MI(j)
acc.
We use the knowledge of the statistical distribution of the
channel attenuation to control the probability of decoding a
codeword at each transmission.
The idea is to deﬁne at the beginning of the communica-
tion, a table containing the probability of decoding at each
transmission. The decoding probability and the efﬁciency of
the link usage are related, the sender can transmit a large
number of bits at the ﬁrst transmission, which increases the
decoding probability but the efﬁciency will decrease and vice
versa. So, we have to improve efﬁciency while respecting
delay constraints for services. In addition the sender may also
want to limit the number of transmission attempts for a given
codeword.
In the rest of this paper, we will consider Pj the probability
of decoding at the jth transmission conditioned on the fact
that decoding at earlier transmissions was impossible, where
P = P
j Pj is the percentage of decoded codewords over all
the transmitted codewords and is equal to 1.

To target a decoding probability Pj at the jth transmission,
we have to ﬁnd the corresponding MI(j)
needed necessary to
calculate the number of bits N (j)
needed to be transmitted (6).
For this, we deﬁne ρ(j)
needed as the minimum successive atten-
uation coefﬁcient (threshold) that provides a MI greater than
MI(j)
needed. This threshold is the minimum attenuation needed
to obtain the decoding probability at the jth transmission.
ρ(j)
needed depends not only on the jth element in the probability
decoding table but also on Pj−1
k=1 Pk as we will see later in
(8). MI(j)
needed is given by:
MI(j)
needed = MI((ρ(j)
needed)2. Es

),
(7)
Where
MI(·)
is
deﬁned
in
(2),
that
takes

(ρ(j)

We assume that the reference Es/N0 ﬁxed for a given ter-
minal (only ρ2 change over the time). MI(j)
on the channel attenuation threshold ρ(j) needed depends only
needed. Since decoding
probabilities at each transmission are predeﬁned, ρ(j)
needed is
pre-computed. MI(·) is a strictly increasing function (as a
function of ρ). Then any attenuation coefﬁcient greater than
ρ(j)
needed will lead to a successful decoding. To determine
ρ(j)
needed leading to Pj, we use the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of the attenuations of LMS Channel.
To simplify our calculation, we consider these two events:
• Aj: Successful decoding at the jth transmission;
• Bj−1: Not decoding at the (j − 1)th transmission.
Pj can be deﬁned as p(Aj ∩ Bj−1) and pj is p(Aj). Since
Aj and Bj−1 are independent (according to the channel
modelling),
Pj = pj(1 −
j−1
X
k=1
Pk),
pj =
Pj
(1 − Pj−1
k=1 Pk)
.
(8)
CDF of the channel gives us P(ρ ≤ ρ(j)
needed), while
pj corresponds to P(ρ ≥ ρ(j)
needed) (successful decoding).

to obtain ρi in the non decoding zone.
Finally, to calculate N (j)
needed we use MI(j)
needed and MI(j−1)

in (6). Where N (j−1) is the sum of all numbers of bits already
calculated for the previous transmissions.

of the numbers of bits to be transmitted at each transmission,

V. SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS
The system parameters that we will consider for all simu-
lations are:
• Satellite Orbit: Geostationary (GEO)
• Round Trip Time: 500 ms
• Band: S
• Land mobile satellite channel , Intermediate Tree Shad-
owed Environment (ITS)
• Speed: 60 Km/h
• Distance: 10 Km
• Mother FEC code, CCSDS Turbo Codes 1/6
• Codeword length: 53520 bits (Data bits : 8920 bits)
• Modulation: QPSK
• Symbol time : 4.10−6 seconds, bit rate (Rb): 500 Kbps
Our simulations are about 10 minutes of communication
between the transmitter and the receiver (about 300 Mb
transmitted). In our simulations, we consider a targeted WER
of 10−4, and we use the actual performances of CCSDS
Turbo codes (8920, 1
6) as presented in [10]. Attenuations in ITS
environment are very high, which makes difﬁcult the decoding
of 100% of codewords in the range of reference Es/N0
considered (7 to 13 dB) with code rates greater than 1
6. Hence
the choice of code rate 1
6. We suppose that the synchronisation
is never lost. The transmitted codewords are identiﬁed with
a sequence number that is never lost. We suppose also that
the return channel does not introduce errors and the feedback
can be transmitted immediately (no congestion problem on the
reverse link).
A calibration phase is required in the simulations, that take
into account the actual numerical performances of the targeted
FEC code(s). This allows to avoid implementing a real decoder
in the simulation chain, while assuring a very good accuracy
of the representation [11]. We use the MI to decide if the
codeword is decoded or not using this formula:
N (j)MI(j)
acc ≥ NbitsMIreq .
(10)
Simulations of classical IR and proposed enhanced HARQ
We present results obtained by implementing both schemes
(classical IR and proposed enhanced HARQ) described in
previous sections, and we compare these results.
We deﬁne a set of precomputed decoding probabilities, that
provide for each retransmission a precomputed number of
parity bits to send. We are interested to improve the efﬁciency
while maintaining an acceptable delay for services.
We deﬁne the efﬁciency, E (bits/symbol), as follows:
E = Ndata bitsNdecoded words
Ntotal
,
(11)
where:
• Ndata bits is the number of data bits (useful bits) per
codeword considered in our coding scheme;
• Ndecoded words is the total number of decoded codewords
during the communication;
• Ntotal is the total number of symbols transmitted during
the communication.
The delay for decoded codewords (at the receiver) can be
expressed in terms of number of transmissions (Ntrans), bit
rate (Rb), number of bits sent (N) and propagation delay
(Tpropag), assuming a negligible access delay:
Delay = N
Rb
+ 2(Ntrans − 1)Tpropag + Tpropag (s) . (12)
The efﬁciency and the delay are positively related. To
improve the efﬁciency we can increase the delay while
respecting the delay constraints for services. This delay is
controlled by the predeﬁned decoding probabilities, which will
be quasi constant along all the values of reference Es/N0. In
the following, we have considered three different tables of
decoding probabilities. Fixed decoding probabilities at each
transmission considered in our simulations are given in Table
I, where the maximum number of transmissions for a given
codeword is four. Case 1 corresponds to a service accepting the
delivery of 80% of the messages at the ﬁrst two transmissions
and 20% at the last two retransmissions. Case 2 corresponds to
a service accepting the delivery of 95% of the messages at the
ﬁrst two transmissions and 5% at the last two retransmissions.
Case 3 corresponds to a service accepting the delivery of 45%
of the messages at the ﬁrst two transmissions and 55% at the
last two retransmissions.

The number of bits to be transmitted at each transmission for
the classical IR HARQ scheme (Section III) can follow several
strategies. As a simple case, we consider an equally shared
repartition of the data+parity bits among the transmissions, as
shown in Table II.

After simulating ﬁrst (classical IR HARQ) and second (en-

under the same conditions, we ﬁgure out the efﬁciency and
the delay obtained for both schemes and compare them.
Figure 4 shows the average delay, required to decode code-
words, obtained with both models (by means of simulations).
The mean delay is computed by averaging delays obtained
for decoded codewords calculated using (12). As we can see,
the values obtained for each case of the proposed model
are approximately the same. The delay remains stable and

changes a little, from a reference Es/N0 to another, according
to the number of bits transmitted and the values of decoding
probabilities.
Figure 5 compares the efﬁciency obtained with both models
in the same conditions. We can see that even if we loose
in delay, the proposed model in cases 1 and 2, outperforms
the classical one especially for high values of reference
Es/N0. The resulting gain can reach 15%. These results
validate our proposal, that ﬁxing decoding probabilities at each
transmission can improve the efﬁciency while respecting delay
constraints for a given service. These results seem promising,
however they have been obtained without any optimization
of decoding probability for each transmission step. Therefore,
some further improvements could probably be obtained. This
clearly calls for an optimization process in further steps of the
work.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have compared two techniques of HARQ
transmission. The ﬁrst one is a classical IR HARQ scheme,
that transmits the same number of bits at each transmission
without any knowledge about the global statistics of the chan-
nel; the second one is an enhanced HARQ technique, which
takes into account the global statistics of the channel. This
proposed enhanced technique estimates the number of bits to
be transmitted at each transmission to decode a codeword with
a given probability. This estimation relies on the mutual infor-
mation given the decoding probability at each transmission and
the knowledge of the distribution of the channel attenuations.
Finally, results obtained after simulating both schemes in a
mobile satellite communication environment are compared in
terms of decoding probability (delay) and efﬁciency. Results
show that enhanced HARQ has better performance in terms
of efﬁciency especially for high values of reference SNR,
while maintaining a quasi constant delay acceptable by delay
constraints of service. As future work we will modify the

proposed method to make it an adaptive model. This model
would calculate the number of bits to be transmitted at
each transmission according to decoding probabilities and
real values of attenuation coefﬁcients obtained. We plan also
to consider additional system parameters, such as framing
constraints and overhead to evaluate the performance of the
mechanism in real systems.
