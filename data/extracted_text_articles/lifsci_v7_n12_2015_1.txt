Abstract—The use of cellular technology is overwhelming our 
lives these days. Global System for Mobile communications 
(GSM) waves -the basis of cellular technology - are high 
frequency, high energy electromagnetic waves that may pause 
as a threat to man.  The current work studies the effect of such 
waves on two types of skeletal muscles, the slow and fast 
twitching muscles in adult male rats. The activity, morphology, 
and structure of the affected muscles are studied and analyzed 
against control. Experiments evaluate changes in body weight, 
muscle mass, water and protein content, total RNA 
concentration, testosterone level, and Myosin Heavy Chain 
(MHC) isoforms expression. Our results show that in both 
muscles, there are changes in the distribution of muscles 
proteins and in the percentage of MHC isoforms suggesting 
that the GSM antenna relay affects the plasticity of skeletal 
muscle fiber by transforming slow type to faster one. 
 
Keywords-GSM electromagnetic waves; skeletal muscles; 
proteins content; testosterone level; MHC isoforms. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The widespread use of mobile phones has been going 
sky-high over the past decade and the applications offered 
by mobile phone technology have become an essential part 
of personnel, business and social life. We have recently 
reported that the structure, the morphology and the activity 
of 2 types of striated muscles in rats have been altered by 
the exposition to electromagnetic waves emitted from 
mobile phones devices [1]. In fact, mammalian striated 
muscle myofibrils are composed of repeating units called 
sarcomeres that are arranged in series. Sarcomeres in turn 
are composed of contractile filaments termed myofilaments 
that are of two major types, actin (thin filament) and myosin 
(thick filament), which interact together to generate force 
and contraction. These myofilaments are large polymers of 
noncovalently associated contractile proteins, actin and 
myosin, which comprise 70% of myofibrillar proteins in 
skeletal muscles [2]. The isomers of Myosin Heavy Chains 
(MHC) are often used to distinguish the types of skeletal 
muscle fibers: slow-twitch – or type I – muscle fibers, where 
MHC I isoform is abundantly expressed; and fast-twitch – 
or type II – muscle fibers (types IIa, IIb, and IId/x), where 
MHC IIa, IIb, IIx/d predominate, respectively [3-5]. Slow-
twitch fibers are adapted for continuous activity, and they 
are rich in myoglobin and oxidative enzymes. A typical 
example is the soleus muscle. Fast-twitch fibers are adapted 
for rapid activity, and they produce energy through 
glycolytic metabolism. A typical example is the extensor 
digitorum longus (edl) muscle [6]. 
A remarkable characteristic of striated muscles is 
plasticity. This term refers to the ability of these muscles to 
remodel and thus change their contractile and metabolic 
makeup, and – hence – their type from slow to fast, or vice 
versa, in response to specific environmental challenges, 
such as exercise, temperature, or gravitational loading,  or 
internal challenges such as nutritional conditions as well as 
neuronal, mechanical, metabolic or hormonal stimuli [7]. 
This may be attributed to a reversible change in the muscle 
gene expression that leads to reversible structural and 
functional modifications [8]. 
One of the important challenges that have developed in 
the last decade and is thought to have an effect on health is 
the 
population 
exposure 
to 
electromagnetic 
waves, 
particularly the Global System of 
Mobile (GSM) 
communication signals.  These signals are emitted from 
diverse sources particularly from cell phones and base 
station antennas. Also, they may come from industrial 
processes, where workers in broadcasting, transport, and

communication industries are highly exposed. They are also 
emitted from medical devices like electrosurgical devices 
and diagnosis equipment. Numerous studies have been 
conducted to measure, document, and archive the amount of 
Radio Frequency (RF) energy emitted from GSM sources in 
residential areas [9].  Thus, concerns from the risk of GSM 
signals on health arise from long term exposure, as well as 
from the cumulative effect of these waves. Researchers have 
been seeking options to minimize additional radiation 
exposures for the population and reduce the potential risk 
for harmful exposures.   
Tyagi et al. studied the effect of mobile phone radiation 
on brain activity.  They comparatively analyzed the effect of 
more than one type of radiations, and concluded that their 
effects on brain activity cannot be attributed to chance [10]. 
Tomruk et al. reported the substantial hepatic oxidative 
DNA and lipid damage on pregnant, non-pregnant, and 
newly-born rabbits [11]. Several studies reported the 
possibility that radio-frequency electromagnetic fields 
(EMF) used in cellular technology might influence DNA 
integrity of male germ cells as well as sperm motility. There 
was evidence that GSM radiation could induce, in vitro, the 
activation of stress conditions and response in human sperm 
cells [12].  The major mechanism by which such waves can 
induce an effect on biological systems is the thermal 
mechanism by which EMF at high intensities can increase 
the tissue or body temperatures above the normal value. 
Non-thermal mechanisms are under wide investigation in 
recent studies [13-16]. 
To understand the effects of EMF radiations, it would 
be beneficial to appreciate the nature and mode of action of 
this type of energy. EMF radiation is a form of potential 
energy exhibiting wavelike behavior as it travels in the 
space.  
EMF radiation has both electric and magnetic field 
components that oscillate – in phase – perpendicular to each 
other and orthogonal to the direction of energy propagation 
[16]. Such radiations can be classified as ionizing and non-
ionizing  radiation,  based  on   capability   to   ionize  atoms  
and/or molecules, and to break chemical bonds. The non-
ionizing type is associated with potential d non-thermal 
hazards.  The short high energy or the chronic low energy 
exposure of biological tissues to EMF radiations has been 
shown to change the functional activities of cells, resulting 
finally in some diseases [10]. 
Few 
studies 
have 
investigated 
the 
effect 
of 
electromagnetic waves on skeletal muscles. In fact, 
Radicheva et al. (in 2002) has shown that a 2.45 GHz 
microwave field could possess a stimulating effect on 
muscle fiber activity, which is in part due to its specific non-
thermal properties [18]. Moreover, our previous study has 
shown that one hour of exposure to electromagnetic field at 
900 MHz modulated by human voice could have an effect 
on the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism of 
mammalian fast- twitch skeletal muscles [19]. However, no 
study to date has investigated the effect of electromagnetic 
waves emitted by GSM relay antenna on muscle 
composition. Consequently, this study is designed to 
investigate the effect of 25V/m of electromagnetic waves 
emitted by GSM relay antenna on animal body weight, 
muscle mass, proteins and water content, total RNA 
expression, serum testosterone level and myosin heavy 
chain isoforms expression in the two types of skeletal 
muscle fibers, slow and fast- twitches. 
Kaasik et al. have shown that MHC I isoform relative 
content in human muscle was 2.6 times higher than in horse 
and 6.3 times higher than in rat muscle. This may be related 
to the differences in endurance capacity of human, horse, 
and rat muscle [20]. Indeed, these authors have shown that 
the main difference between the distribution of myosin light 
chain (MLC) isoforms in human, horse, and rat skeletal 
muscle is the relatively low level of regulatory MLC 
isoforms in human skeletal muscle. MLC isoforms 
distribution in skeletal muscle has been shown to be related 
to the physiological role and adaptational capacity of muscle 
to everyday motor activity [21]. Despite the relative 
proportions of each fiber type vary between homologous 
muscles of different species [22-23], and in the absence of 
human data, research with experimental animals is the most 
reliable means of detecting important toxic properties of 
chemical substances and for estimating risks to human and 
environmental health. Thus, we decided to use as animal 
model, the rat, in order to study the effects of GSM 
electromagnetic waves on skeletal muscles. The exposures 
received by animals can be compared to those received by 
humans in order to interpret test results and predict risk. 
This in turn helps regulatory agencies to prioritize funding 
for environmental cleanup. 
This paper studies the effect of GSM waves on skeletal 
muscles in rats. A background of the study is given in 
Section I.  The materials and methods used in the study are 
mentioned in Section II. The results are presented in Section 
III and discussed in Section IV.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Experimental Design  
All procedures in this study were performed in 
accordance 
with 
the 
stipulations 
of 
the 
Helsinki 
Declarations and with the current Lebanese laws for animal 
experimentation. Twenty adult Sprague-Dawley male rats 
with an average weight of 190 ± 5 g were divided equally 
into 2 groups. One group was subjected for 6 weeks to 
whole continuous (24 hours/day) body exposure to EMW 
(900 MHz, Eeff= 25V/m) (Fig. 1). The other group was 
considered as control and maintained in the same 
environmental conditions under the turned off antenna. Both 
exposed and control animals were housed in a temperature-
controlled room (22ºC) on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. They 
were daily supplied with the same kind of food and water.

B. Dissection  
After the exposure period, the rats were gently sacrificed 
and trunk blood was collected. Soleus and edl muscles were 
rapidly excised from the hind limbs of each rat. The muscles 
are weighted and preserved at - 80ºC for later analysis.  
C. Total RNA extraction 
 
Total RNA was extracted from muscle samples using 
RiboZol™ RNA Extraction Reagent from AMRESCO, 
according to the vender’s instructions (American Research 
Products, 30175 Solon Industrial Parkway, Solon, OH 
44139-9827 USA).  
D. Serum testosterone level determination 
Collected blood was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 
minutes. Serum of each rat was preserved at -20°C. Serum 
testosterone, insulin and cortisol levels, in control and 
exposed groups, were measured by Enzyme-Linked 
ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) technique based on the 
principle of competitive binding, according to instructions 
supplied by the vender.  
E. Proteins dosage  
Protein dosage was performed according to Bradford 
Technique 
[24]. 
Pieces 
of 
frozen 
muscles 
were 
mechanically disrupted and spliced in 5 volumes of washing 
buffer containing 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA (pH 6.4), and 
5 mM PO4. After 5 minutes of centrifugation at a high 
speed (12000 rpm), the supernatant is collected and the 
quantity of the protein is determined with the Bradford 
method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), where the results were 
expressed as a ratio of milligrams of proteins to 100 
milligrams of muscles. The pellet was then washed with 3 
volumes of extraction buffer containing 5 mM EGTA, 1mM    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dithiothreitol (pH 8.5), and 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 
and incubated in cold overnight. The next day, the mixture 
was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes and the 
supernatant – which contained the protein myosin – was 
collected and the amount of myofibrillar proteins was 
determined. Small volumes (50μL) of the supernatant were 
diluted twice with glycerol and stored at -20°C for 
electrophoresis. 
F. SDS-PAGE electrophoretic separation of Myosin 
Heavy Chain isoforms 
To analyze the content of MHC I, MHC IIa, IIb, IId/x 
isoforms in the extracts, we used simple vertical migration 
of SDS-PAGE electrophoretic separation. The separating 
gel was prepared from 99.5% glycerol, 30% acrylamide, 
0.6% bis acrylamide, 1.5 M Tris (pH 8.8), 1 M glycine, 10% 
SDS, 10% ammonium persulfate, and TEMED. The staking 
gel was prepared from 99.5% glycerol, 30% acrylamide, 
0.6% bis acrylamide, 0.5 M Tris (pH 6.8), 10% SDS, 0.1 M 
EDTA (pH 7), 10% ammonium persulfate, and TEMED. 
For best quantification, 2-3 μg of myosin were loaded in 
each well. Electrophoresis was performed using a Cleavage, 
Scientific ltd, system. Gels were run at constant voltage 
(70V) for 24 h and then stained with silver reagent that 
allowed the detection of the MHC bands corresponding to I, 
IIa, IIb, and IId/x isoforms. The stained gels were scanned 
using a Canon digital imaging system and the density of 
bands was estimated using the UN-Scan-IT software [25]. 
G. Statistical analysis 
All values are expressed as means ± SE for n 
observations. Data were analyzed by One-Way ANOVA

(StatView; Alsyd, Meylan, France) statistical test. A level of 
p< 0.05 indicated statistical significance. 
 
III. 
RESULTS  
A. Effect of GSM waves exposure on Body mass 
As shown in Fig. 2, all animals steadily gained weight 
and there was no difference observed between the control 
and exposed animals after 6 weeks of GSM waves exposure 
(Control: 283 ± 8 g; Exposed:  295 ± 7 g, n=10) 
Fig. 2. Effect of GSM electromagnetic waves exposition on Body mass. 
Each value displays mean ±SE. 
 
B. Effect of GSM waves exposure on muscles mass 
Although body weight was not affected by the exposure, 
six weeks of exposure resulted in a significant decrease in 
edl mass by 16% (Control; 133.56 ± 3.69 mg; Exposed: 
112.19 ± 2.57 mg, n=20, p<0.05). However, no significant 
effect was observed in soleus muscle mass (Control; 120.06 
± 2.89 mg; Exposed: 117.49 ± 3.11 mg, n=20) (Fig. 3).  
Such a decrease in muscle mass observed in edl muscle 
could be related to modification in water content and/or in 
the proteins content. Consequently, the water content and 
the soluble and myofibrillar proteins content were 
estimated. 
C. Effect of GSM waves exposure on muscles water 
content 
In control group, water content expressed as percentage 
is estimated to 37.5 ± 0.7% in soleus muscles and 26.9 ± 
0.6% in edl muscles. After 6 weeks of continuous 
electromagnetic 
waves 
exposure, 
and 
although 
no 
significant effect was observed in soleus muscle mass, an 
increase by 17% in percentage of water content was 
observed (43.9 ± 1.2%, n=12, p<0.05). However, no 
significant effect was observed in edl muscles (28.1 ± 0.6%, 
n=12) (Fig. 4).

D. Effect of GSM waves exposure on proteins content 
In soleus control muscles, soluble and myofibrillar 
proteins content were 2.71±0.13 and 3.42 ±0.26 mg/g of 
muscle, respectively. The six weeks of continuous 
electromagnetic waves exposure induced an increase by 
23% of soluble proteins (3.34±0.16 mg/g, n=24, p<0.05); 
however, a decrease by 32% of myofibrillar proteins was 
observed (2.33±0.29 mg/g, n=24, p<0.05) (Fig. 5).

In edl control muscles, soluble and myofibrillar proteins 
content were 3.56±0.18 and 3.83 ±0.11 mg/g of muscle, 
respectively. Six weeks of continuous GSM waves exposure 
induced a decrease by 28% and 24% of soluble and 
myofibrillar proteins, respectively (Soluble proteins content: 
2.78±0.19 mg/g; Myofibrillar proteins content: 2.91±0.22 
mg/g of muscle, n=24, p<0.05) (see Fig. 5). 
These modifications in proteins content in both soleus 
and edl muscles should be correlated to total RNA level 
expression.

In control condition, the total RNA values were 755.21± 
16.72 g/l and 548.32± 14.98g/l in edl and soleus 
muscles, respectively. After 6 weeks of GSM exposure, a 
decrease by 29% and 25% were shown in both edl and 
soleus muscles, respectively (n=10; p<0.05) (Fig. 6).   
This decrease in the amount of total RNA expression 
could be related to the modification in the serum 
testosterone level.

F. Effect of GSM waves exposure on serum testosterone, 
insulin and cortisol level 
In 
control 
condition, 
the 
Enzyme-Linked 
ImmunoSorbent Assay showed that serum testosterone level 
was 82.12 ± 4.39 ng/ml. Six weeks of GSM waves exposure 
induced a decrease by 50% in serum testosterone level 
(40.91 ± 5.71 ng/ml, n=10, p<0.05) (Fig. 7).

On the other hand, no significant difference was 
observed in the serum cortisol level after 6 weeks of GSM 
exposition (Fig. 9). 
G. Effect of GSM waves exposure on Myosin Heavy Chain 
Isoforms expression 
Separation and analysis of MHC isoforms by SDS-
PAGE allowed the estimation of the density of the bands 
corresponding to each of the MHC isoforms (MHC I, IIa, IIb, 
and IIx) using the UN-Scan-IT software. These isoforms are 
differentially expressed in the different muscle fiber types.  
In control conditions, the edl muscle expresses 34.6 ± 0.2 % 
of MHC IIx and 66.4±2.8 % of MHC IIb, while the soleus 
muscle expresses 5.1 ± 1.7% of MHC IIa and 94.6 ± 1.5% 
of MHC I.  
The 6 weeks of GSM waves exposure induced, in edl 
muscle, a significant increase by 63% in the expression of 
MHC IIx isoforms (56.3±4.2%) and a significant decrease 
by 33% in MHC IIb isoforms expression (44.9±3.4%, n=24, 
p<0.05). 
Moreover, in soleus muscle, the exposure induced a 
significant increase in the expression of MHC IIa isoforms 
(16.1 ± 1.7%) with a significant decrease in the expression 
of MHC I isoforms (84.3±1.5%, n=24, p<0.05) (Fig. 10).

phones or their base stations could affect the health of users. 
If there is a health impact, there will be a global impact 
because the number of active cell phones is estimated to 
reach 7.3 billion by 2014. For this, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) established the International EMF 
Project in 1996 to assess the science, and recommends 
research to fill gaps in the knowledge of risks arising from 
exposure to electromagnetic fields on health [8]. Safety is a 
valid concern for the users of wireless equipment, especially 
in regard to possible hazards caused by electromagnetic 
fields (EMFs). There has been increasing concern about the 
possible adverse health effects resulting from exposure to 
radiofrequency radiations (RFR), such as those from mobile 
communication devices, in general, and cellular phones, in 
particular. Mobile communication technology is achieved 
when signal is transferred via electromagnetic wave through 
radio frequency and microwave signals. This signal 
produces electromagnetic radiation in the form of thermal 
radiation that consists of harmful ionizing radiation and 
harmless non-ionizing radiation. When using mobile phone, 
electromagnetic wave is transferred to the body, potentially 
causing health problems, especially – for example – at the 
place near the ear skull region, where they are known to 
affect the neurons. Neurophysiological studies identified 
that radiations interfere with the electrical impulses that two 
neurons connect each other with. This can lead to adverse 
effects, from headache to blurred vision, to deafness and 
migraines. People using cell phones are susceptible to high 
blood pressure and other symptoms such as headaches and 
fatigue [26, 27]. There have been various studies into the 
connection between mobile phones and memory and the 
results were confusing and sometime contradictory [28-30].  
Other studies have explored the possibility that radio-
frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) employed by 
mobile phone technology could influence the genetic 
makeup and physiology of some specific cells, i.e., male 
germ cells, and sperm mobility [12].  It was shown that 
upon prolonged exposure to RF-EMF, sperm surface area 
and acrosomal region were significantly reduced. It was also 
shown that the primary function of sperm cells – binding to 
human oocytes – was significantly compromised. 
Furthermore, the effect of RF-EMF radiations was 
studied vis-à-vis their induction of cellular stress response.  
This was evaluated by quantifying the expression and 
activity of heat shock proteins (Hsp), namely Hsp27 and 
Hsp70, but was shown not to have measurable differences 
from normal [12]. 
Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in animals 
representing up to 50% of body mass in some athletic 
species such as dogs and horses. Muscle fibers are 
composed of myofibrils arranged in parallel, which 
constitute the major compartment in muscle cells, 
comprising from 73.2% of muscle fiber volume in horses to 
83.3% of muscle fiber volume in goats. Also, total 
myofibrillar volume is directly proportional to muscle mass 
with a scaling factor of 0.98 [31].  
Mammalian skeletal muscle is a highly heterogeneous 
tissue, able to adapt to environmental challenges to which it 
is subjected. In rats and mice, this process is governed by a 
set of mechanical, hormonal and nutritional signals [32-34]. 
Phenotypic plasticity of muscle tissue allows it to be 
modified in order to meet the specific demands faced by an 
animal during its life [18]. This critical property leads to a 
conversion of muscle fibers from slow to fast or vice versa 
[3, 35]. A wide range of contractile properties are mainly 
attributed to the diversity of the isoforms of MHC, which 
can exist in different muscle fibers. Four MHC isoforms (I, 
IIa, IIx and IIb), each encoded by a separate gene can be 
expressed in adult skeletal muscle. The intrinsic differences 
in the properties of the ATPase of MJHC isoforms led to the 
classification of fiber muscle as slow or fast fibers [33, 36]. 
Generally, the fast-type genes appear to be expressed at 
birth, while the slow-type genes are expressed in response to 
changes in activity during development [32].  
This study aims to examine the effect of electromagnetic 
waves emitted from GSM antenna relay, at 900 MHz 
frequency, on body weight, muscle mass, protein content 
and the expression of the isoforms of the myosin heavy 
chain (MHC) in 2 types of muscle fiber types. One is slow 
oxidative fiber and the other is fast glycolytic fiber.  
Actually, very few studies have examined the effect of 
electromagnetic waves on the skeletal muscle. In one of 
them, the study was conducted in vivo and showed that the 
field of microwave of 2.45 GHz has a stimulating effect on 
the activity of the muscle fibers, which is in part due to its 
non-thermal specific properties [18]. In another, the study 
was conducted in vitro, and showed that one hour of 
exposure to 900 MHz of electromagnetic field modulated by 
the human voice could have an effect on the mechanism of 
excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal muscle fast-
twitch [19].  
The 
results 
of 
our 
present 
work 
show 
that 
electromagnetic waves do not affect the body weight of rat 
males. In addition, the exposure period results in a decrease 
in absolute edl muscle mass, while that of soleus is kept 
unchanged. The myofibrillar protein content is directly 
proportional to muscle mass. A decrease in the mass of the 
edl was translated by decrease of both myofibrillar protein 
content and soluble protein. The increase in soluble protein 
content in soleus muscle was compensated by the decrease 
of myofibrillar proteins content resulting in the maintenance 
of muscle mass of soleus. This can be explained by the 
compensatory mechanisms at the translational and post-
translational levels as suggested by Nikolova et al. [37]. In 
addition, synthetic modification in myofibrillar and soluble 
proteins in edl and soleus may be the consequence of the 
changes of level of transcription of genes encoding these 
proteins or due to perturbation in the stability of their 
corresponding mRNAs [35]. Therefore, the quantification of 
the mRNA encoding the soluble and myofibrillar and 
measurement of protein half-life is necessary to detect the 
level at which the change has led to modify the level of

myofibrillar proteins and other proteins expressed in these 
two types of skeletal muscles. Our results provide new 
information by showing a decrease in the total RNA values 
in both edl and soleus muscles after 6 weeks of exposure to 
GSM in rats. These results are very propitious and may 
explain some of disorders observed in humans exposed to 
electromagnetic waves. However, further studies on human 
are needed in order to confirm these possible effects.      
On the other hand, the effect of electromagnetic waves 
is specific and can be attributed to a modification in the 
activity of different hormones. In 2010, Meo et al. [38] 
showed that exposure to radiation emitted by mobile phone 
for 60 minutes / day for a period of 3 months significantly 
decreased the level of serum testosterone in albino rats 
Wistar. In 2008, Al-Akhras showed that exposure for 6 
weeks in a sinusoidal electromagnetic field of 50 Hz 
resulted in a significant reduction in levels of gonadotropins 
(FSH and LH) in female rats [39]. These results are similar 
to our results, where we showed a decrease in the level of 
testosterone after 6 weeks of exposure to GSM waves. This 
decrease can explain the decrease in total RNA values in 
both muscles since it is known that testosterone binds with 
androgen receptors inside the nucleus of different target 
cells and turn on the synthesis of mRNA, which are then 
translated into specified proteins. Thus, the decrease of the 
level of testosterone may explain the decrease of the RNA 
levels. On the other hand, there was no change in the level 
of cortisol in the rats exposed to GSM electromagnetic 
waves. This result suggests that the exposition to these 
radiations will not affect the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal 
axis that regulates the stress behavior. Thus, it is possible to 
propose that the radiations emitted from GSM will not 
induce stress in rats exposed to them. However, our results 
show an increase in the level of insulin in rats exposed to 
electromagnetic waves. This finding is similar to those 
shown by Meo and Rubeann [40] who have demonstrated 
that exposure to mobile phones causes hyperglycemia with a 
simultaneous and significant increase in serum insulin 
levels. Eventually, a compensatory rise in insulin level helps 
to control the hyperglycemia. Considering this result and its 
connection with mobile phone radiation, it is important to 
find out whether it is associated with B-cell dysfunction or 
insulin resistance.  
If insulin resistance was developed, this can be linked 
to the change in the percentage of MHC isoforms observed 
in the present study. In fact, our results show an increase of 
the MHC IIa isoform, but a decrease in the MCH I isoform 
in the soleus muscle. In the edl muscle, a significant 
increase in MHC IIx and a significant decrease of MHC IIb 
isoforms were observed. These results suggest that the GSM 
antenna relay affects the plasticity of skeletal muscle fiber 
by transforming slow type to faster one. Thus, insulin 
resistance decreases the entry of glucose in muscle cells. 
These cells will switch from the slow aerobic type to the fast 
glycolytic one in order to accommodate the decrease in 
glucose uptake. These suggestions need to be established by 
confirming the development of the insulin resistance and by 
studying the glucose uptake by muscles cells in rats exposed 
to mobile phone radiation.
