Abstract— In this paper, a reliable electronic nose system
designed from the combination of various semi-conductor metal
oxide gas sensors (MOGS) is applied to the detection of ﬁre
resulting from various sources in a kitchen. The time series sig-
nals obtained from the same source of ﬁre are highly correlated,
and different sources of ﬁre exhibit unique patterns in the time
series data. Therefore, the error back-propagation (BP) method
can be effectively used for the classiﬁcation of the tested smell.
The accuracy of 99.6% is achieved by using only a single training
data set from each source of ﬁre. The accuracy achieved with the
k-means algorithm is 98.3%, which also shows the high ability of
the EN in detecting the early stage of ﬁre from various sources.

I. INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, odor-sensing systems (so-called elec-
tronic nose systems) have undergone important developments
from technical and commercial viewpoints. The electronic
nose (EN) refers to a device of reproducing human sense of
smell based on sensor arrays of smell and pattern recognition
methods. Recently, there are several commercial EN instru-
ments currently in use in the world such as quality control of
food industry [1], environmental protection [2], public safety
[3] and space applications [4].
Every year the damage from the household ﬁre disaster
brings about not only severe loss to property assets, but also
physical and psychological injuries of the people.
In this paper, we will explain the human olfactory process
and the EN system. After surveying various types of the odor
sensors, we explain the and then the reliability of a new EN
system developed from various semi-conductor metal oxide
gas sensors (MOGSs) is presented to specify the smell from
various sources of ﬁre.
James A. Milke [5] has proved that two kinds of MOGS
have the ability to classify several sources of ﬁre more pre-
cisely compared with conventional smoke detector. However,
his results achieve only 85% of correct classiﬁcation.
In this paper, a new EN [6] is applied to measure smells
from various sources of ﬁre such as household burning ma-
terials, cooking smells, the leakage from the liquid petroleum
gas (LPG). The new EN has been successfully applied to the
classiﬁcation of not only similar smells from different kinds,
but also the same kind of smell at different concentration lev-
els. The time series signals of the MOGS from the beginning
to the time until the MOGS fully adsorbs the smell from each
source of ﬁre are recorded and analyzed by the error back-
propagation (BP) neural network and the k-means algorithm.
The average classiﬁcation rate of 99.6% can be achieved by
the BP method with only a single training data set from each
source of ﬁre. The accuracy with k-means algorithm is 98.3%,
which is much better than the results in [5]– [9]. These results
conﬁrm the reliability of this new device in detecting various
sources of ﬁre in the early stage.
II. HUMAN OLFACTORY PROCESSES
Although the human olfactory system is not fully under-
stood by physician, the main components about the anatomy
of human olfactory system are the olfactory epithelium, the
olfactory bulb, the olfactory cortex, and the higher brain or
cerebral cortex.
The ﬁrst process of human olfactory system is to breathe
or to sniff the smell into the nose. The difference between
the normal breath and the snifﬁng is the quantity of odorous
molecules that ﬂows into the upper part of the nose. In case
of snifﬁng, most air is ﬂown through the nose to the lung and
about 20% of air is ﬂown to the upper part of the nose and
detected by the olfactory receptors.
In case of snifﬁng, the most air is ﬂown directly to the upper
part of the nose and interacts with the olfactory receptors. The
odorous molecules are dissolved at the mucous layer before
interacting with olfactory receptors in the olfactory epithelium.
The concentration of odorous molecules must be over the
recognition threshold. After that, the chemical reaction in
each olfactory receptor produces an electrical stimulus. The
electrical signals from all olfactory receptors are transported
to olfactory bulb. The input data from olfactory receptors are
transformed to be the olfactory information to the olfactory
cortex. Then the olfactory cortex distributes the information
to other parts to the brain and human can recognize odors
precisely. The other parts of the brain that link to the olfactory
cortex will control the reaction of the other organ against
the reaction of that smell. When human detects bad smells,
human will suddenly expel those smells from the nose and
try to avoid breathing them directly without any protection.
This is a part of the reaction from the higher brain. The next
process is to clean the nose by breathing fresh air to dilute the
odorous molecules until those concentrations are lower than
the detecting threshold. The time to dilute the smell depends
on the persistence qualiﬁcation of the tested smell.

III. EN SYSTEM
The EN systems provide an alternative method to analyze
smell by imitating the human olfactory system. In this section,
the concept of an EN is explained. Then various odors sensors
applied as the olfactory receptors are explained. Finally, the
mechanism of a simple EN that was developed in this paper
is described in detail by comparing the function of each part
with the human olfactory process.
A. EN concept
The mechanism of EN systems can be divided into main
four parts as shown in Fig. 2.
Odor delivery system
Odor sensor array
Data recording
Data processing
Fig. 2.
Main parts of EN systems.
1) Odor delivery system: The ﬁrst process of human ol-
factory system is to sniff the odorous molecule into the nose.
Thus, the ﬁrst part of the EN system is the mechanism to
bring the odorous molecules into the EN system. There are
three main methods to deliver the odor to the EN unit, sample
ﬂow, static system, and preconcentration system.
The sample ﬂow system is the most popular method to
deliver odorous molecule to the EN unit. Some carrier gas such
as air, oxygen, nitrogen, and so on, is provided as a carrier gas
at the inlet port to ﬂow the vapor of the tested smell through
the EN unit via the outlet port. The mechanism to control the
air ﬂow of an EN may contain various different parts such as a
mass ﬂow controller to control the pressure of the carrier gas,
a solenoid valve to control the ﬂow of inlet and outlet ports,
a pump to suck the tested odor from the sampling bag in case
that the tested odor is provided from outside, a mechanism to
control humidity, and so on. Most commercial ENs contain
complicated odor delivering systems and this makes the price
of the ENs become expensive.
The static system is the easiest way to deliver odorous
molecules to the EN unit. The EN unit is put into a closed
loop container. Then an odor sample is injected directly to
the container by a syringe. It is also possible to design an
automatic injection system. However, the rate to inject the test
odors must be controlled to obtain accuracy results. Normally,
this method is applied for the calibration process of the EN.
But in this case the quantity of the odor may not be enough to
make the sensor reach the saturation stage, that is, the stage
that sensor adsorbs the smell fully.
The preconcentration system is used in case of the tested
smell that has a low concentration and it is necessary to
accumulate the vapor of the tested odor before being delivered
to the EN unit. The preconcentrator must contain some adsor-
bent material such as silica and tested odor is continuously
accumulated into the preconcentrator for speciﬁc time units.
Then the preconcentrator is heated to desorb the odorous
molecule from the adsorbed material. The carrier gas is ﬂown
through the preconcentrator to bring the desorbed odorous
molecules to the EN unit. By using this method, some weak
smells can be detected by the sensor array in the EN unit.
2) EN unit: All ENs must contain an array of odor sensors
which act like the human olfactory receptors. Various kinds
of odor sensors can be used to detect odors. The details of
odor sensors will be explained in the following section. The
number of sensors in the ENs unit is around 4 to 50 sensors
depending on the design of each EN. The electrical circuit
to control the input and the output of the sensor array are
varied on the types of sensors. It is also possible to use several
sensors from the same model for analyzing the odor just like
the human olfactory receptors that may contain the same kind
of receptors from different ages (human olfactory replacement
time is around 30 days as an average). Inside of the EN
units may contain some mechanism to clean the sensor after
ﬁnishing the testing process in order to speed up the EN to
analyze new smell.
3) Data recording: It is necessary to record the output of
the sensor array in the EN unit while absorbing the tested
odor continuously. Generally, the output from the sensor array
is analog signal and it is necessary to convert the analog
signal to digital signal before being recorded in the computer
memory starage and A/D converters are used which include the
software to control the sampling time with the user interface.
This part of the EN system is like the function of olfactory
bulb to collect the signal from the olfactory receptors before
passing to the olfactory cortex.
4) Data processing: Once the data from the tested odor are
completely available for analyzing, it may be able to apply
269

various methods to analyze these data such as artiﬁcial neural
networks(NNs)or statistical analysis. It may be necessary
to modify the]raw data from the sensor array to increase
the speed of data processing, that is, training time for the
supervised NNs, or to correct some variation of data due to
the effect of measuring environment. The way to modify the
data is just like the internal function of olfactory bulb before
passing the input to the olfactory cortex. The NNs or the
statistical analysis with the software to interface with the user
will act like the olfactory cortex and cerebral cortex in the
human olfactory system.
The data processing part is one of the most important step
to make the EN system become reliable. Most commercial
ENs have a complicated mechanism for the odor delivery
system and the EN unit, but if the data processing part of
those ENs are not well designed, the high reliability of the
ENs system may not be achieved. This paper will focus on
the data processing to classify the several smells precisely.
IV. ODOR SENSORS
Actually there are many kinds of sensors that can be used to
detect odorous molecules. However, only a few kinds of them
have been successfully applied as artiﬁcial olfactory receptors
in commercial ENs. Those sensors are a conducting polymer
(CP)[1], a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)[6], a surface
acoustic wave (SAW)[1], and MOGSs[6].
A. Conducting polymer (CP) sensor
The CP sensor is widely applied as the array of artiﬁcial
olfactory receptor in the commercial EN. These sensors are
made by a thin ﬁlm electro-polymerization of the conducting
polymer across the gap between two inert electrodes. Variety
of different monomers can be polymerized to give conducting
polymer ﬁlm.
CPs show reversible changes in conductivity when chemical
substances such as methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate adsorb
and desorb from the polymer. However, the mechanism that the
conductivity is changed by this adsorption is not clearly under-
stood like the case of MOGSs. Anyway, variety of polymers
ﬁlm responds to different kinds of odor. The choices of CPs
sensors are wider than those of MOGSs. CP sensor is operated
at the nearly room temperature and it consumes low power
consumption. However, the response to odorous molecule is
slower than those of MOGSs and it is really sensitive to
humidity. The CP sensors are used in some commercial ENs,
but only the sensor itself is not sold separately.
B. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor
The QCM sensor is a kind of acoustic wave gas sensors.
The main element of a QCM sensor is made from a slice
of single crystal quartz typically around 1 cm in diameter.
The electrodes, usually gold, are coated on both surfaces of
the crystal quartz. The suitable alternative voltage is applied
across the two electrodes. The electromechanical effect can
make the crystal oscillate at its resonant frequency.
The oscillation wavelength and resonant frequency are al-
tered depending on the thickness (weight) of the crystal quartz.
The acoustic waves are oscillated at ultrasonic frequency
typically around 1 to 500 MHz. The sensitivity of the QCM
sensor to the odorous molecules depends on the gas sensitive
coating material on the surface of the crystal quartz. The
adsorbent coating materials are generally electro-polymers
since the wide ranges of materials must be synthesized. When
the adsorbent coating material adsorbs odorous molecules, the
wave velocity, frequency, and the amplitude of oscillation of
the sensor are changed. Therefore, the QCM with various
kinds of coating materials can be used as an array of artiﬁcial
olfactory receptors in the EN.
C. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor
A surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor is another kind of
acoustic wave sensor that is similar to the QCM sensor. The
SAW sensor comprises with a thick plate of crystal quartz. A
surface of the SAW is coated with the gold electrodes to excite
the oscillation of the surface of sensor. The wave is generated
by applying an alternative voltage to the gold electrodes on
the surface of the sensors. There are two electrode pairs, one
is for transmitting the wave and the other pair is for receiving
the acoustic wave.
The adsorbent coating material is coated on the surface
between the transmitter and receiver electrode pairs. The
changes in frequency of acoustic wave on the surface of the
SAW sensors can be detected while the adsorbent material
adsorbing odorous molecules. The properties of acoustic are
affected by the changes in the properties of the crystal surface.
The operating frequency of an SAW is between 30 to 300
MHz. The sensor also requires an integrated circuit to generate
and receive acoustic wave like the QCM sensor. SAW sensor
is sensitive to humidity and the response time that is not as
fast as the MOGS and the CP sensor.
D. Semi-conductor metal oxide gas sensors (MFGOGSs)
MOGS is the most widely used sensor for making an array
of artiﬁcial olfactory receptors in the EN system. These sensors
are commercially available as the chemical sensor for detecting
some speciﬁc smells. Generally, an MOGS is applied in many
kinds of electrical appliances such as a microwave oven to
detect the food burning, an alcohol breath checker to check
the drunkenness, an air puriﬁer to check the air quality, and
so on.
Therefore, we will use MOGSs as the smell classiﬁcation
in what follows. The picture of some commercial MOGSs are
shown in Fig. 3.
Various kinds of metal oxide, such as SnO2, ZnO2,
WO2,TiO2 are coated on the surface of semi-conductor, but
the most widely applied metal oxide is SnO2. These metal
oxides have a chemical reaction with the oxygen in the air
and the chemical reaction changes when the adsorbing gas is
detected. The scheme of chemical reaction of an MOGS when
adsorbing with the CO gas is shown as follows:
1
2O2 + (SnO2−x) → O−ad(SnO2−x)
(1)
CO + O−ad(SnO2−x) → CO2 + (SnO2−x)
(2)

Fig. 3.
MOGS
When the metal oxide element on the surface of the sensor is
heated at a certain high temperature, the oxygen is adsorbed
on the crystal surface with the negative charge as shown in
Fig. 3. In this stage the grain boundary area of the metal oxide
element forms a high barrier as shown in the left hand side of
Fig. 3. Then the electrons cannot ﬂow over the boundary and
this makes the resistance of the sensor become higher. When
the deoxidizing gas, e.g., CO gas, is presented to the sensor,
there is a chemical reaction between negative charge of oxygen
at the surface of the metal oxide element and the deoxidizing
gas as shown in (2). The chemical reaction between adsorbing
gas and the negative charge of the oxygen on the surface of
MOGS reduces the grain boundary barrier of the metal oxide
element as shown in the right hand side of
4. Thus, the
electron can ﬂow from one cell to another cell easier. This
makes the resistance of MOGS lower by the change of oxygen
pressure according to the rule of (3).
The relationship between sensor resistance and the concen-
tration of deoxidizing gas can be expressed by the following
equation over a certain range of gas concentration:
Rs = A[C]−α
(3)
where Rs =electrical resistance of the sensor, A = constant,
C =gas concentration, and α =slope of Rs curve.
Fig. 4.
Principle of MOGS[7]
The electric circuit for the MOGS is shown in Fig.5.
Electrical voltages are provided to the circuit(Vc) and the
heater of the sensor(Vh). When the MOGS is adsorbed with
oxygen and the deoxidizing gas, the resistance of the sensor
(Rs) is changed. Thus, it can measure the voltage changes
while the sensor adsorbing the tested odor(Vout).
MOGSs need to be operated at high temperature, so they
consume a little higher power supply than the other kinds
of sensors. The reliability and the sensitivity of MOGSs
are proved to be good to detect volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), combustible gas, and so on [7]. However, the choices
of MOGSs are still not cover all odorous compounds and it
is difﬁcult to create an MOGS that responds to one odor pre-
cisely. Generally, the commercial MOGS responds to various
odors in different ways. Therefore, we can expect if we use
many MOGSs to measure a smell, the vector data reﬂect the
speciﬁc properties for the smell.
Fig. 5.
Principle of MOGS[7]
Generally, it is designed to detect some speciﬁc smell in
electrical appliances such as an air puriﬁer, a breath alcohol
checker, and so on. Each type of MOGS has its own character-
istics in the response to different gases. When combining many
MOGS together, the ability to detect the smell is increased.
An EN system shown in Fig. 6 has been developed, based
on the concept of human olfactory system stated above. The
combination of MOGS, listed in Table I, are used as the
olfactory receptors in the human nose. The MOGS unit is
combined with the air ﬂow system to lead the air and the tested
smell into the MOGS unit. The A/D converter transforms
the analog signals to digital signals and stores them in the
data recording system before being analyzed by multivariate
analysis methods, such as the BP method and the k-means
algorithm.

The main part of the MOGS is the metal oxide element

surface with the negative charge. The reaction between the

negative charge of the metal oxide surface and deoxidizing gas
makes the resistance of the sensor vary as the partial pressure
of oxygen changes[7]. Based on this characteristic, we can
measure the net voltage changes while the sensors adsorb the
tested odor.
V. EXPERIMENTAL DATA COLLECTION
The investigation of the EN under temperature and humidity
controlled environments is performed and the experiment is
done in winter season.
1) Experimental conditions : Each data is repeatedly tested
consecutively forty times under similar weather conditions
to keep the temperature and the humidity constant. The
concentration of all tested smells is controlled as constant as
possible in order to observe the repeatability qualiﬁcation of
the MOGSs in this EN.
The temperature and humidity of normal air during the test
period are controlled by adjusting the valves shown in Fig. 6.
The carrier gas in this experiment is the dry air. Since the
measuring environment is controlled by using the permeator,
which can control the temperature, ﬂow rate of the air, and
humidity, we assume that the measurement data do not depend
on the environment in this experiment.
2) Measuring method : There are two methods to measure
the smell. The ﬁrst method called “ transient method (TM)”
is done by injecting the tested smell into the EN for a short
period of time, for example, 120s, while measuring the smell.
The other method called “saturation method (SM)” is done by
continuously providing the tested smell to the EN until the
smell data approach the saturation stage.
3) Measuring data : The smell from twelve sources of ﬁre
listed in Table II are measured by the EN system explained in
the previous section. Each source of ﬁre has been tested with
forty repetition of data measured on different days, in order
to check the repeatability in the response of the MOGS to the
same smell.

For each data set, the voltage signal in the dry air is
measured every two seconds for a sensor s during one minute,
and its average value ¯Vs(air) is used as the reference point.
After that, a testing smell is adsorbed, and the voltage V (s, t)
is measured every two seconds for a period of two minutes
on each smell sample. Finally, the net change of the voltage
signal in each period, Vsmell,t, is calculated by
Vs(t) = V (s, t) − ¯Vs(air), s = 1, 2, ..., 8
(4)
where t is the time from 0 to 120s and s denotes a kind of
sensor.
After testing one smell the MOGS need to be cleaned by
removing the tested smell and supplying only the fresh air
until the output of the MOGS return to a stable point and
a new sample can be tested. This process is just like the
human nose which needs to breath the fresh dry air before
being able to recognize a new smell accurately. Some time
series data are shown in Fig. 7. From these data, we can see
that many time series data of smells approach the saturation
stages within the measuring periods. But Some smells can not
approach the saturation stages within the measuring period,
such as OIL, PAPER, WOOD, because of two reasons. First
reason is that the distance from the tested smell to the EN
unit is increased and it takes longer time for smell to ﬂow to
the EN unit. The second reason is the changes of smell of the
burning material. For example, the smell of OIL is stronger
and stronger if heating is provided to the container of the
vegetable oil. The vegetable oil is able to turn to be the ﬂame
of ﬁre if the heating is continuously provided to the container
of the tested oil. Thus, we decided to measure the smell only
two minutes even though the data signals of some smells can
not reach the saturation stage.
The smells from AROMA, CANDLE, and the FLAME are
not as strong as the other tested smell. Thus, the responses
of the data signals from these data are lower than the other
272

6
smells. The signals from the same smell in every repetition are
similar and each smell has a unique pattern. However, some
smells like PAPER, OIL, and WOOD have some repetition
data of different patterns from their main repitition data due
to the inconsistent burning rate of these smells. Since all tested
smells in every repetition data are measured under similar
environment, it is not necessary to apply the normalization
method to modify the data. In this case, the raw data obtained
from Eq.(4) can be used as the input data for the NNs or the
statistical analysis, directly.
The method to measure the correlation of the data will be
performed in order to choose the proper training data for the
NN with the BP algorithm. Furthermore, the signals from the
same source of ﬁre in every repetition data are similar in most
data sources. The results using the BP method and the k-means
algorithm to analyze the time series data from each source
of ﬁre every two seconds and the average signals during the
saturation stages (time 100–120s) are discussed.
VI. CORRELATION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA
Before classifying each source of data, the correlation of
each data source is investigated by using the similarity index
(SI) and the principal components analysis (PCA).
A. Similarity Index
In the statistical application, the correlation value developed
mainly by Karl Pearson is widely used to ﬁnd the relationship
between two random variables. In this paper, we call the
correlation value as a similarity index (SI). The SI value varies
from −1 to +1. Two random variables with an SI of either
−1 or +1 are highly correlated, because the knowledge of
one provides precise knowledge of the other. However, the
SI provides information only for linear relationships between
random variables. Random variables could have a nonlinear
relationship but still have a SI close to zero [4]. Therefore, we
make an assumption on this application that each data pattern
has nearly linear relationship to the other data patterns. The
SI value between two data is calculated by
rxy =

set.
In this experiment, sensor SP-MW1 has some responses
with the smell that has high humidity such as the STEAM,
ODEN, and LPG. Thus, the signal from this sensor is included
as the analytical data. Therefore, the dimension of data vector,
n, in this experiment is equal to 480 (8 sensors×60 samples).
The SI values of the data that have consistent burning rates
such as the JOSS and the MC are higher than 0.995 in every
compared data. The data with inconsistent burning rates like
the PAPER and the WOOD have lower SI values in some pairs
of data. This means that the repetitions of these data types are
less correlated than the data with high SI values. Later we
will show that the classiﬁcation rate of the data with high SI
values is higher than those of the data with low SI values.
Since a pair of data with high SI values has linear rela-
tionship to each other, the signals from the same smell in
every repetition data have high SI values. It means that the
EN has reproducibility qualiﬁcation under similar measuring
environment. Thus, it may be able to use only a single data
from each smell to be training data of the NN by the BP
method or the initial data vector for the statistical analysis
like the k-means algorithm. Only a single data from each smell
with the highest average SI value to the other repetition data
of its own smell is selected as the training data.
B. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
The PCA is applied to transform the time series data by
using the input data obtained from Eq.(4). The dimension of
the input data is equal to four hundred and eighty. The plot of
two main components from the PCA is shown in Fig. 8 where
two cases of the experimental data are shown. The loading
factors of principal components 1, 2 are about 64%,16% and
about 71%, 19%, for full time series stage and saturation stage,
respectively. The full time series stage data use the data signals
every two seconds, and the saturation stage data case uses only
the average data from time 100s to 120s for the analysis. The
distributions of the data with inconsistent burning rate such
as the PAPER and the WOOD are more scattered than the
other data with consistent burning rates such as the JOSS,
especially in the saturation stage data. Most of the tested data
are separated into their own clusters with some overlap zones
among different data sources.
C. k-means Algorithm
The k-means algorithm is a kind of statistical method. It is
an unsupervised learning method that assign an input vector
to the nearest cluster center based on the Euclidean distance.
The k-means algorithm is performed as follows:
Step 1. Select an initial set of cluster centers, Ci
=
(ci1, ci2, · · · , cij) where i and j are an index of cluster and
a dimension of the input vector. The number of clusters in the
input vector space is assumed to be known such as k. The
cluster center Ci, i = 1, 2, ..., k are selected from a sample of
the input vector that should belong to that cluster.
Step 2. Assign an input vector l of Xl = (xl1, xl2, · · · , xlj)
to its closest cluster index by calculating the Euclidean dis-
tance between the input vector Xl and each cluster center,
Ci, i = 1, · · · , k. Here, xlm denotes an input data from cluster
index l and m-th component of the input vector.
Step 3. Repeat Step 2 until all n input vectors are assigned
to any cluster.
Step 4. Compute the new cluster centers by calculating the
mean value of all input vectors that belong to that cluster.
Step 5. If the position of any cluster center changes, return
to Step 2. Otherwise stop.

The processing time of the k-means algorithm is much faster
than the training time of the NN by the BP method. Thus, it is
a useful method to analyze the data that have high dimension
size like this experiment.

SERIES DATA
Full time series data is obtained from Eq.(4) with the
dimension of four hundred and eighty that is equal to the
number of sensors times the measurement data (8×60). They
are used as the input data for the NN by the BP method as
well as the data of k-means algorithm.
A. Experimental Results Using the NN
The structure of the NN by the BP method as shown
in Fig. 9 has three layers. The input layer contains four
hundred and eighty input neurons that are equal to the number
of sensors (8) tomes the sampling number (60) where the
sampling time is 2[s] and the measurement interval is 2[min].
The hidden layer has been tried with several values and ﬁnally
forty hidden nodes give the best result. The output layer
contains twelve nodes where each node represents the smell
from each source of ﬁre as listed in Table II. The learning
rate, α, and the momentum rate, µ, during the training period
are set by trail and error to o.1 and 0.001, respectively.
After checking the correlation of the data by applying
the SI value and the PCA, it is found that most data are
highly correlated to its own repetition data and most data are
distributed densely in its own area with some overlap zone as
shown in Fig. 8. The smells that have consistent burning rate
like JOSS, MC, LPG have the average SI value between their
repetition data higher than 0.995. This means that these data
have highly linear relationship with their own repetition data.
In the other way, some smells that have inconsistent burning
rate like PAPER or WOOD have some scattered repetition data
and these data have the average SI value to their repetition
data only around 0.980 which is not as high as the average
SI value of JOSS or MC. However, this experiment decides to
choose only a single data from each smell in Table II to use
as the training data for the NN by the BP method. This data is
selected by choosing the data that has the highest average SI
value to its own repetition data. The training process is started
by the randomized initial weight, and the process to update
the weights continues until the minimum mean squared error
is less than or equal to 0.0003.
In this experiment, it is assumed that a smell is classiﬁed
correctly if the highest value of output node is greater than or
equal to 0.6 while the corresponding reference value is equal
to 1, and those of other output nodes are equal to 0. The results
obtained by NN with the BP algorithm are shown in Table IV.
B. Experimental Results Using the k-Means Method
The k-means method is applied to analyze the same data as
in the case of NN with the BP algorithm. At ﬁrst, the number
of cluster is set to be twelve. Each cluster represents a tested
smell shown in Table II. The initial set of cluster center uses a

C. Discussions of both results by NN and the k-means methods
The results from the NN method have only two incorrectly
classiﬁed data from paper burning smell (PAPER). These data
are not misclassiﬁed as the other smells, but only the value of
their output nodes are not high enough to classify them as the
paper burning smell.
VIII. ANOTHER EXPERIMENTS
The input data are changed in the two cases:1) number
of sensors are 4 and 4 to check the effect of classiﬁcation
according to the number of input data(Experiment 1), 2)
number of sensors are eight and the input data has been
characterized by the regression coefﬁcients (Experiment 2).
A. Result in case of four and six sensors
We have used four and six sensors for this experiment. The
former is SP-MW1, SP-31, SP-32, and SP-42A in Table 1 and
the latter is SP-MW1, SP-19, SP-31, SP-32, SP-53, and SP-
42A in Table 1. In the former case total number of the input
data is 240 samples for 4 sensors since the sampling time
274

is 2 [s] and the measurement time is 2 [min]. In the latter
case it has 360 samples for 6 sensors. For the hidden layer,
we have tried several values, and the number of nodes which
gives good accuracy and reasonable training time for both data
turned out to be forty. The output layer contains twelve nodes,
each node representing one data source. The learning rate, the
momentum rate, and the minimum mean square error (MSE)
during the training period are set by trial and error method to
0.1, 0.001, and 0.0003, respectively.
Two case of data are analyzed by the BP method and k-
means algorithm.
The results in Table III show that the variation of sensor to
the quality of the classiﬁcation performance. Compared with
the classiﬁcation rate of four sensors, those of six sensors are
little bit improved as we expected although the difference is
a little. It can be noted that the classiﬁcation rate of the smell
that can be controlled the quality of smell like JOSS and MOS
can be perfectly classiﬁed in all cases. In the opposite way,
the smell that has some ﬂuctuation in the quality of smell tend
to have low classiﬁcation when the information of the input
data is decreased. Therefore, to achieve the high classiﬁcation
results, it is important to note the quality of the tested smell.
B. Result for SMM
It seems that the results will be improved if we use many
measurement data as much as possible. But there will be
some measurement noises in the data, which make the results
worse compared with the case that typical measurement data
were used. Therefore, we try to reduce the noisy effect in the
measurement data by using the regression model.
First, we divide the measurement data into n intervals. The
measurement data in each segment are replaced by the linear
regression model. We take n = 3 and the number of the data
in each division becomes 20. Then we get the following linear
regression model.
yi = β0 + β1xi, i = 1, 2, ..., 20
(6)
where yi is the estimated voltage, β0is the intercept and β1 is
the slope of the regression line, and xi is the time. Then the
slopes become
β1 =
n
X
i=1
(xi − ¯x)(yi − ¯y)
n
X
i=1
(xi − ¯x)2
(7)
where ¯x and ¯y are mean values of xi and yi, respectively.
The slope maximum mean(SMM) is to adopt the features
of the data as ﬁve dimension(three slopes in each segment
plus the maximum value and the mean value among the total
data)as shown in Fig. 10. We use eight sensors as shown
in Table I and the total number of input becomes forty(5
data times 8 sensors). For the hidden layer, we have tried
several values, and the number of nodes which gives good
accuracy and reasonable training time for both data turned out
to be forty. The output layer contains twelve nodes, each node
representing one data source. The learning rate, the momentum
rate, and the minimum mean square error (MSE) during the
training period are set by trial and error method to 0.1, 0.001,
and 0.0003, respectively.
As the comparison of the features by SMM, we adopt the
average of the TSD in the steady state, which means the
maximum values among the total data.
Based on the information during the investigation of the
correlation among data sets, most data sources are highly cor-
related to their repetition data with high SI values. Therefore,
only one data set which has the highest average SI value to
other repetition data sets from each source of ﬁre are used as
the training data for the BP, and the rest of the data are used as
the test data. We assume that a pattern is classiﬁed correctly
if either the output is not less than 0.7 and the target is 1, or
the output is not greater than 0.3 and the target is 0.
For the k-means algorithm, the training data of the BP
method are used as the initial data, and then the data patterns
are assigned to the nearest cluster center according to the
Euclidean distance. After that, the new cluster center is recal-
culated. The process continues until the position of the cluster
center is not changed. The ﬁnal results of this experiment are
shown in Table III.
The results using the TSD from both the BP method and
the k-means algorithm are better than those of the SSD case.
The data signals from the MOGS are affected by many factors,
such as the sampling condition, the inconsistency in burning
rate, the ﬂuctuation from the standard air, and so on. Therefore,
the saturation stages of the data vary by those factors. By
including the signal before approaching the saturation stage,
the accuracy of classifying all the smells is increased.
C. Discussion
Although the distribution of PCA shown in Fig.6 cannot
clearly separate similar sources of smell such as the aroma
oil and the aroma candle, the BP method and the k-means
algorithm are capable of classifying them perfectly as shown
in Table III. The results of TSD using the BP method have
only two incorrectly classiﬁed data. These two data are not
misclassiﬁed as the other smells. Only the output value of
their paper node are not high enough to classify them as
the paper. The output values of these two data on the paper
node are only 0.4951 and 0.4799 respectively, and the output
of the other output nodes are nearly zero. The results are
much better than those in [1], where two kinds of MOGS
are used for classifying several sources of ﬁre into three ﬁre
condition levels of ﬂaming, smoldering, and nuisance, and its
accuracy is only 85%. The smoke density of the tested data
are not high enough to trigger the alarm of the smoke detector.
In case of unusual burning smells in the residences such as
the wood burning, ﬂaming from the LPG, or the leakage of
LPG, it is necessary to have a proper device to detect these
sources before becoming unable to extinguish the ﬁre. We
can conclude that the new EN system shown in this paper is

IX. CONCLUSION
We have presented the reliability of a new EN system
designed from various kinds of MOGS. The EN has the ability
to identify various sources of ﬁre in the early stage with more
than 99% of accuracy by using only a single training data set
in the BP case. The results from the k-means algorithm also
shows the ability to predict the sources of ﬁre with more than
98% of accuracy. It can be concluded that the EN is suitable
for detecting the early stage of ﬁre.
