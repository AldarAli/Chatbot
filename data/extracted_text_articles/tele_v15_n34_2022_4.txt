Abstract— Device-to-Device (D2D) enabled cellular networks 
are a promising solution for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency 
Communication (URLLC) systems. Integrating D2D into 
future wireless industrial networks and next-generation 
manufacturing can support the creation of massive machine-
type wireless connections. In this paper, we present a Base 
Station Assisted (BSA) reinforcement learning approach for 
resource allocation in a D2D-enabled cellular network 
targeting smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 applications. 
A distributed local Q-table is used for the D2D agents to 
prevent global information gathering and a stateless Q-
learning approach is adopted to reduce the complexity of 
learning and the dimension of the Q-table. The Q-tables of the 
D2D agents are then uploaded to the Base Station (BS) for the 
resource allocation to be implemented centrally. Simulation 
case studies show that the presented semi distributed BSA 
technique results in reduced signalling overheads and a good 
Quality of Service (QoS) across the network compared to other 
conventional schemes.

 INTRODUCTION  
    The increasing growth in the number of wireless smart 
devices and applications necessitates novel and efficient 
Radio Resource Management (RRM) schemes to address 
the different challenges faced. Device to Device (D2D) 
communication is considered one of the key technologies 
for 5G and beyond networks aiming to provide 
improvements in performance metrics such as throughput, 
spectrum, and energy efficiency especially for new verticals 
such as smart manufacturing and Ultra Reliable Low 
Latency Communication (URLLC) use cases, e.g., in 
wireless industrial applications [1]. Machine learning and 
artificial intelligence techniques are some of the main 
techniques currently gaining increased interest to realise the 
expectations of future generation wireless systems [2]-[3]. 
    Spectrum access where a cellular and D2D users share the 
same resources can potentially result in improved spectrum 
efficiency. However, if shared resource allocation is not 
properly coordinated, mutual interference between cellular 
and D2D links may degrade the Quality of Service/Quality 
of Experience (QoS/QoE) of end-users. 
    Future wireless networks are characterised by a high 
density of devices and dynamic environments with rapidly 
changing Channel State Information (CSI). Centralised and 
distributed schemes are two RRM approaches used to 
allocate resources to users. In a centralised scheme, the 
global acquisition of CSI by a centralised controller (e.g., a 
Base Station (BS)) often incurs high signaling overheads 
and computation complexity which, tend to increase with 
the number of users, therefore making it impractical to 
deploy. Furthermore, RRM problems are often formulated 
as optimisation problems where the QoS requirements are 
modelled as the constraints. These optimisation problems 
are often complex and difficult to solve directly. A 
distributed approach does not need a central entity. 
Resource allocation is executed by users, therefore reducing 
the amount of information exchange, computations, and 
processing by the base station, and resulting in improved 
QoS across the network.  
    Game theory and machine learning are important 
techniques that can be used to realise a distributed RRM 
scheme. Matching theory, which, has been used to solve 
assignment or pairing problems between two distinct sets of 
players with diverse QoS objectives [4], may get complex in 
a multiuser scenario with rapidly changing channel 
conditions using full CSI, as in [5].  
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been explored to 
address RRM problems in dynamic environments [6]-[7].    
RL is a machine learning approach, well-suited to support 
decision 
making 
in 
5G-and-beyond 
networks 
with 
uncertainties, for example, in distributed resource allocation 
with unknown or partial information of network conditions. 
Q-learning is a reinforcement learning technique that uses a 
look-up table, known as Q-table, to determine an optimal 
strategy to adopt, by storing the values used to compute the 
maximum expected future rewards for actions taken at each 
state.  A large number of agents, states and actions can lead 
to a high-dimension Q-table which, may result in slow 
convergence and limit the practical applications due to the 
high memory requirements [8]. These challenges can be 
addressed by using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) 
which, uses deep neural networks to approximate the tables 
[9]. However, DRL is associated with high complexity and 
large learning data [10]-[11]. 
    RL has been widely investigated to study intelligent 
power level and spectrum channel allocations for D2D-
enabled cellular networks in a multi-agent environment. The 
work in [12] formulated the resource allocation problem as a 
stochastic non-cooperative game among D2D users. 
However, the QoS requirements of cellular users sharing the 
same frequency bands with D2D users were not considered

in the reward model. In [13], a multi-agent actor-critic 
framework was proposed which, involves cooperation 
between users and sharing of all historical information 
(states, actions, and policies) in a centralised training 
scheme to ensure stability. This will consequently increase 
the amount of signalling overheads and information 
exchange. In [12]-[15], the reward function captured the 
QoS metric of cellular users in a centralised Q-learning 
approach, which, also leads to increased signalling 
overheads.  
    In this paper, we present a semi-distributed reinforcement 
learning scheme for spectrum resource sharing of D2D 
Users (DUEs) and Cellular Users (CUEs) targeting smart 
manufacturing environments and URLLC networks. This 
semi distributed approach relies on two phases. First, a 
decentralised training of agents is implemented. This is 
followed by Q-tables being uploaded to the base station for 
final resource allocation.  The reward function is modeled in 
such a way that there is no information exchange related to 
other agents’ actions or rewards. To address the problem of 
the ‘curse of dimensionality’ associated with Q-learning, a 
stateless Q-learning approach is adopted to reduce the 
dimension of the Q-table, nonetheless capturing the QoS 
demands of the D2D users. The main contributions of this 
work are summarised below: 
 
• 
A hybrid RRM scheme with distributed D2D training 
and a centralised channel allocation is presented with an 
advantage of reduced signalling overheads compared 
with conventional centralised approaches. This hybrid 
RRM scheme relies on stateless reinforcement learning 
algorithm is presented, where there is no state 
transition, to ensure a reduced dimension of the state-
action mapping, nevertheless capturing the key 
performance metrics of the DUEs. With this technique, 
there is a decrease in complexity and signalling 
overheads making scheme adaptable to high-density 
networks. 
• 
In previous works [16]-[18], the QoS of cellular users is 
captured by integrating it in the state space or reward 
function of the D2D users. Rather than the BS exchange 
the QoS estimation of the CUE with the DUE at each 
time slot, a Q-table for the CUEs is maintained and 
updated. 
• 
Numerical simulations are used verify the performance 
of the presented algorithm in comparison to other 
approaches in terms of achieved throughput, signalling 
overheads and complexity. 
 
    The paper is organised as follows: The system model and 
problem formulation are presented in Section II. In Section 
III, a stateless reinforcement learning algorithm for base 
station-assisted resource allocation is presented. Section IV 
presents simulation case studies and results.  The main 
conclusions and directions for future work are summarised 
in Section V. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION 
         We consider D2D and cellular users coexisting within 
a cellular network for uplink spectrum-sharing as illustrated 
in Fig. 1. There are  Cellular Users (CUEs) represented by 
a set  = , … , 	, … 
 and  D2D Users (DUEs) 
denoted by a set  = , … , , …  deployed randomly 
within the coverage of the base station in a single cell 
system. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  An illustration of a D2D enabled cellular network 
    The DUEs can autonomously select a Resource Block 
(RB) denoted by a set  = , … , 	, … 
, from a pool of 
radio resources [18]19, which, can overlap with that of the 
CUEs for the benefit of reuse gain. The cellular users have 
strict performance requirements in the form of minimum 
Signal-to-Interference Plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) values to 
guarantee their throughput. The D2D links also have 
minimum SINR thresholds to guarantee their throughput 
demands, in addition, to the reliability and delay 
requirements. 
    We assume that each CUE has been pre-allocated a 
resource block. The transmit power of the CUEs and DUEs 
are denoted by  and  respectively. ,,  ,,  , 
and , are the channel gains of cellular communication 
from the CUE 	 to the BS, the interference link from the 
DUE transmitter  to the BS, the D2D communication link

from the DUE transmitter   to the receiver   and the 
interference link form the CUE transmitter to the DUE 
receiver  , respectively. The channel gain comprises 
small-scale fading which, is assumed to be exponentially 
distributed with a unit mean and large-scale fading which, 
includes 
pathloss

where M[ is the pathloss constant, \],[ is the small-scale 
fading gain due to multipath propagation and assumed to 
have an exponential distribution with unit mean. The large-
scale fading comprises pathloss with exponent ^[ and 
shadowing which, has a slow fading gain O],[ with a log-
normal distribution. P],[ is the distance from terminal F to 
terminal G [20].  
    The channel gain , and , can be estimated at the 
DUE receiver,   and made available at its transmitter,  
instantaneously [19]. Similarly, , and  ,  can be 
obtained at BS through local information since uplink 
transmission is considered.  
   The reliability of the DUE  ∈ ,  _(#), is defined as 
the probability of packet delay exceeding a predefined delay 
bound, `,abc, on channel ! at slot # is less than a threshold 
[21]. The objective of the system is to maximise the total 
throughput, d , of paired CUEs and DUEs while satisfying 
the QoS demands. The optimisation problem and constraints 
are described in (6).

   The minimum SINR, Γ,akl, to guarantee the throughput 
requirement of the CUEs is defined in constraint (6a). 
Constraint (6b) takes into account reliability and delay, 
where ` is the packet delay constraint for packet 
transmission of DUE . The expression captures the fact 
that the end-to-end delay should be less than `,abc with a 
probability of at least 1 − _
∗ . Constraints (6c) and (6d) are 
channel association criteria. The reliability of the DUE links 
in (6c) is evaluated using an empirical estimation of number 
of packets transmitted similar to [21], from  to   whose 
delay is within the budget `,abc over the total number of 
packets sent to   at time slot # i.e.,

the outage probability, which, is the probability that the

probability of "th DUE conditioned on the selected !th

where { (#) is the measured outage probability of DUE  
at time slot # and { ‡ is the maximum tolerable outage 
probability of .  
     
    The reliability of the DUE in terms of outage probability

                                _(#) = 1 − { (#).                            (9) 
 
    Transmission delay is given as the ratio of packet size 
transmitted within delay bound to the transmission rate [23].  
From (7), (8) and (9) the transmission delay of "th DUE 
using the !th RB is formulated as:

   At each time slot #, the resource allocation system 
implements two functions, namely:  
i) determining the SINR, Γ for the !th CUE and the SINR 
Γ that the "th DUE to ensure that the minimum SINR and 
target reliability _
∗   thresholds are achieved and  
ii) allocating RBs to "th DUE so that d  is maximised. 
     
   The resource allocation optimisation problem for D2D 
communication in a cellular network is NP hard and a direct 
solution is not feasible. We present a base station-assisted 
resource allocation scheme which, adopts a semi-
distributive RRM approach. 
 
III. 
STATELESS REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR BASE 
STATION-ASSISTED  RESOURCE ALLOCATION  
      The goal of the agents is to maximise throughput in a 
D2D-enabled cellular network. At each time slot #, a DUE 
observes a state Œ+ and takes an action •+ from the action 
space (i.e., select an RB 	), according to a policy π. Q-
learning enables an agent to determine the optimal strategy 
that maximises its long term expected cumulative reward. 
The Q-value is updated as follows [23]: 
 
Ž+.  
= •
Ž+(Œ+, •+) + • ‘G+ + ’ max

where • ∈ [0,1] is the learning rate. With • = 0,  the Q-
values are never updated, hence no learning has taken place; 
setting • to a high value such as means that learning can 
occur quickly and 0 ≤ ’ ≤ 1 is the discount factor used to 
balance immediate and future reward [24]. 
    The state space, action space and rewards function in the 
learning environment are defined as follows: 
 
1) State Space: The state observed by DUE  ∈ , ¡
	 (#), 
using resource block RB 	 at time slot # is defined by three 
variables, resulting in eight possible states as defined in

    The state-action dimension is reduced by adopting a 
stateless learning approach. For the considered scenario, an 
action •	 ∈ - taken by an agent will result in the end of an 
episode i.e., states 0 and 1 are terminal states, where 
¡
	 (#)  = 1 is the goal state of the DUEs. Therefore, the 
learning environment can be modelled entirely using a 
stateless Q-learning i.e., action-reward only since the state 
transition is not required. An agent can choose its action 
based solely on its Q-value. The updated Q-value of the 
chosen action is based on the current Q-value and the 
63

immediate reward from selecting that action. The update 
function in (11) is re-formulated as follows: 
 
Ž+.(•+) = ¢Ž+(•+) + •[G(•+) − Ž+(•+)], if  • = •+
Ž+(•+),          otherwise
Z     (13) 
 
where G(•+) is the immediate reward of selecting •. 
    In contrast to the standard Q-value update function in 
(11), it can be seen in (13) that not only the state-action 
formation (Œ, •) is not necessary, but also the information of 
the next state Œ+. is not required because the actions lead to 
a terminal state. Therefore, the Q-table is defined in terms of 
the actions only and updated using the immediate reward. 
This results in 1 × || dimension Q-table for "th DUE. This 
method reduces the learning complexity and the Q-table 
dimension.  
    The traditional cellular users in the network need to be 
protected from the interference caused by the DUEs for their 
minimum SINR to be satisfied. This may be achieved by 
integrating the SINR of the CUE, Γ in the state space or by 
reward function modelling. This way, the DUEs can obtain 
the information from the BS at time slot # as in [17]-[18], 
[25]; hence, the DUEs get a reward if the CUE SINR 
Γ ≥ Γ,akl , and a penalty otherwise. Rather than the BS 
exchange the measured CUE SINR, Γ, with the DUEs for 
every action •+ taken at each time slot, we adopt a scheme 
in which, the BS keeps a look-up table of the !th CUE based 
on the actions on the DUEs. Therefore, the Q-table for the 
!th CUE is  1 × ||  considering a stateless Q-learning 
structure.     
2) Action Space: The action space of DUE  ∈  is a set of 
all actions denoted by - = •,
+ , … , •	
+, … •,
+ , where  •	
+ is 
the action taken by  ∈  at time slot # and defined as the 
selection of an RB 	. 
3) Action-Selection Strategy: There are methods to select an 
action based on the current evaluation of the Q-value at 
every time slot # using a policy denoted by {
+ . These 
methods are used to balance the exploration and exploitation 
of actions taken by the agents [26]. Epsilon greedy (°-
greedy) is one of the methods of choosing an optimal Q-
value and described as follows:

where ° is the exploration rate with 0 ≤ ° ≤ 1. The 
exploration rate is the probability that the agents will 
explore the environment rather than exploit it. ° → 1 results 
in greater exploration whereas ° → 0 means greater 
exploitation. 
 
4) Reward Function: The reward function is modelled such 
that it relies only on local observations and can be 
implemented in a distributive manner. The rewards of the 
"th DUE and !th CUE for taking an action •	
+ is expressed in 
terms of the achievable throughput using the Shannon 
capacity formula. Thus, the reward is directly related to the 
objective function of the optimisation problem. 
    Equation (15) shows that "th DUE only gets a reward 
when all the state variables are 1 (i.e., the minimum QoS 
demands are met), while !th CUE gets a reward if its 
minimum SINR is satisfied at each time slot for the action 
taken by "th DUE. From the reward function defined above, 
learning 
can 
be 
implemented 
independently 
in 
a 
decentralised manner such that each agent maintains a local 
Q-table. There is no information exchange relating to other 
agents’ actions or rewards and no cooperation is needed 
between the agents, which, results in reduced signalling 
overheads and reduced complexity compared with a 
centralised Q-learning approach.

Similarly, the Q-value of the !th CUE for action taken by

   From (16), it can be seen that after the training, the Q-
table of the "th DUE,  Ž(•), will return Ž
	 (•) = 0 for its 
action on  !th RB that do not meet its QoS requirements. 
Similarly, the Q-table of the !th CUE,  Ž(•), will return 
Ž
 (•) = 0 for the action of ©th DUE on ªth RB that do not 
meet its QoS requirements.  
   The BSA algorithm summarised in Algorithm I, aims to 
optimise the achieved system throughput. After the training 
phase, each DUE loads its Q-value table, Ž(•),  to the BS 
for centralised matching. The BS will then allocate cellular 
resource blocks to D2D links in such a way that spectrum 
sharing is optimised, network throughput is maximised and 
there is no need for information exchange between the UEs 
to find a suitable candidate.

IV. 
SIMULATION CASE STUDY AND PERFORMANCE 
EVALUATION 
   The performance of the BSA approach described in 
Section III, is verified by considering a single-cell network 
in an industrial scenario. The simulation set-up and channel 
models are as described in [1] and summarised in Tables II 
and III. The network dynamics is captured by generating the 
channel fading effects randomly. The throughput is the main 
metric used to evaluate the performances of the algorithms. 
The performance of BSA is compared with centralised 
optimisation and the game theoretic Deferred Acceptance 
(DA) techniques [1][20]. 
A. Throughput Performance  
   The throughput performance of matched DUEs as a 
function of the number of DUEs in the system , is shown 
in Fig. 2. It can be concluded that the sum throughput of the 
DUEs increases with the number of cellular users  for all 
the considered algorithms. As expected, the number of 
admitted DUEs increases with the introduction of new 
DUEs to the system, but unchanged if a valid cellular 
resource-sharing partner cannot be found because the 
minimum QoS requirements are not satisfied. The 
performances of centralised and BSA approaches are 
comparable, while the DA method shows the least 
performance. The BSA algorithm outperforms the DA 
algorithm by up to 9.69% increase in the DUE throughput 
performance. However, it is semi-distributive as the final 
resource allocation is implemented by the BS whereas the 
DA approach is decentralised (the channel selection is user-
centric, and no BS intervention is necessary to achieve 
autonomy). Players can make their resource allocations 
choices to maximise their individual throughput and 
ultimately achieve system stability.  The performance of the 
sum throughput of the matched UEs (that is valid pairings 
between CUEs and DUEs) with respect to the number of 
cellular users  is shown in Fig. 3. The sum throughput 
increases with . The BSA approach indicates better 
performance at  ≤ 35 with up to 12.05% increase in sum 
throughput compared to the centralised approach, while the 
centralised approach performed better at  > 35 with up to 
9.39% increase in throughput. The DA algorithm again 
shows the least performance compared to the BSA 
technique. 
    The effects of the outage probability of the DUE, { ‡, and 
delay threshold of the DUEs, `,abc  on the sum rate of the 
matched UEs for all algorithms are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 
5, respectively. The sum throughput of the matched UEs 
increases with { ‡ and `,abc. This is because higher { ‡ 
causes the interference from the CUEs to be more tolerable 
by the DUEs, therefore making potential CUE-DUE pairing 
possible. Similarly, higher `,abc increases the sum 
throughput at fixed outage probability and payload since the 
delay requirement is less stringent. More DUEs are able to

satisfy the delay constraint and the number of admitted 
DUEs is increased.

B. Signalling Overheads and Complexity Analysis 
    We now evaluate and compare the signalling overheads 
and computation complexity of the investigated algorithms. 
Signalling overheads are evaluated in terms of the level of 
involvement of the BS and User Equipment (UE), i.e., BS-
UE communication. The signalling overhead evaluated is an 
aggregation of contributions of channel information 
acquisition and information exchange by the BS-UE links.      
The number of iterations d depends on the network 
dynamics. A summary of the signalling overhead estimation 
is presented in Table IV. The different approaches are also 
evaluated in terms of their computation complexity. The run 
time for the algorithm also depends on the number of 
iterations and on the number of users. It can be concluded 
that the centralised algorithm has the highest complexity, 
while the DA scheme has the least complexity, with a 
10.38% reduction in processing time compared with the 
centralised approach for the studied scenario. 
    An overall comparison for the studied techniques based 
on throughput, signalling and complexity metrics is shown 
in Fig. 6 for different numbers of users. It can be seen that 
the 
centralised 
approach 
has 
the 
best 
throughput 
performance, however it has higher signalling overheads 
and computation complexity in comparison to the other 
approaches. DA has the lowest throughput performance and 
complexity, while BSA achieves the lowest signalling 
overheads. BSA achieves a 49.81% reduction in signalling 
overheads and 0.94% reduction in complexity with less than 
9% lower throughput performance compared to the 
centralised approach which, is a good tradeoff of throughput 
and signalling overheads.

In summary, the results indicate that for throughput 
maximisation in a low-density network in which, self-
organisation is not important, the centralised scheme is the 
best to adopt at the cost of signalling overheads. The DA is 
a promising technique to achieve good throughput 
performance at lower signalling overheads and complexity 
if device autonomy and network stability are essential. On 
the other hand, BSA is a semi-distributive approach which, 
offers a good trade-off of throughput, complexity and 
signalling overheads trade-off compared to DA and 
centralised optimisation schemes. 
    Regardless of the limitations of the investigated and 
developed RRM techniques presented in this paper, the 
results from adopting these methodologies, suggest the 
possibility 
of 
developing 
a 
conceptual 
qualitative  
evaluation framework to assist in the selection of an 
appropriate scheme to achieve specific priorities for the 
target industrial scenarios, as presented in Table V.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
    
   We presented a semi-distributed BSA scheme for RRM of 
a D2D enabled cellular network targeting wireless industrial 
applications. The BSA scheme is an RL based approach 
which relies on distributed training of the D2D agents. 
Subsequently, the look-up tables for the D2D agents are 
loaded to the BS for centralised channel allocation. 
   The performance of the BSA scheme was compared with 
centralised optimisation and the game theoretic DA 
approaches in terms of throughput, signalling overheads and 
computation complexity. It is concluded that BSA offers a 
good trade-off of throughput, complexity and signalling 
overheads compared to DA and the centralised optimisation 
schemes. However, the BSA scheme is semi distributed. 
The future work aims at exploring optimised fully 
distributed techniques with the aim of  facilitating an 
increased DUE autonomy through the combination of game 
theory and machine learning techniques.
