Abstract—Today, with the advancement of the Internet and
transportation, we can readily travel around the world using
diverse modes of travel. On these journeys, many people use
various mobile devices to obtain the latest tourist information
from the Internet. However, most of the information focuses on
popular tourist attractions and leads to crowds flocking there.
Unlike
existing
studies,
which
concentrate
on
analyzing
popular tourist attractions, we attempt to disperse crowds
from popular tourist attractions and provide more spots for
travelers
to
choose
by
analyzing
rarely
known
tourist
attractions. For this study, we propose a formula for ranking
tourist attractions by analyzing geo-tagged photographs on
Flickr. The results of our questionnaire survey successfully
revealed tourist locations that were unfamiliar to the majority
of respondents, but which were attractive to them.
Keywords-Flickr;

I.
INTRODUCTION
In this era of the Internet and smartphones, most people
can readily share and record their touristic experiences on
Social Networking Services (SNSs) such as Facebook and
Flickr. Numerous studies have analyzed user records of tours
on SNS to elucidate user hobbies and preferences. It is
possible
to
discover
popular
tourist
attractions
and
recommend some tour plans for a user according to their
preferences [1]–[4]. Using SNSs, we can immediately obtain
the newest status of our friends, particularly using well-
known functions check-ins and “geo-tagged” photographs,
which are useful when one wants to share a location with
friends.
Aside from geolocation, diverse information is available
from different people using SNSs. That information includes
many important and useful data for research. For instance,
Hausmann et al. [5] pointed out that social media contents
might provide a swift and cost-efficient substitute for
traditional surveys. Furthermore, Liu et al. [6] proposed an
approach for the discovery of Areas of Interest (AoIs) by
analyzing
“geo-tagged”
photographs
and
“check-in”
information to supply popular scenic locations and popular
spots with travelers. Another study with similar aims to our
own
used
SNS
users’
information
and
“geo-tagged”
photographs to discover obscure sightseeing spots [7].
Most tourists have received sightseeing information
through travel websites. However, these websites only
present
well-known
tourist
attractions.
Consequently,
although the attractions are crowded and congested, visitors
will be led there. We conducted a preliminary investigation
which showed that the great majority of tourists do not like
crowded spots that make them feel uncomfortable.
As the number of tourists continue to increase, they will
bring
huge
revenues
for
tourism-related
industries.
Nevertheless, benefits from tourists are accompanied by
latent crises as well, which we should face. Kakamu et al. [8]
discovered that when the number of foreigners and the police
force increase, the rate of crime will also increase. However,
if criminal rates increase, it will reduce visiting willingness
and tourism income will be lost [9].
Most earlier studies have specifically addressed analyses
of popular tourism attractions or AoIs and neglected other
unnoticed places. Therefore, for the present study, through
dispersing crowds from more popular tourist attractions, our
goal is to improve several aspects: (1) crowded popular
tourist attractions make visitors feel uncomfortable; (2)
foreigners are too numerous at popular tourist attractions,
engendering higher rates of crime; and (3) supporting tourist
industries of regions apart from popular regions.
To accomplish our aim, we analyzed scenic “geo-tagged”
photographs taken in Japan from Flickr. Thereby, we
discovered worthwhile and rarely known tourist attractions.
We studied this topic based on scenic photographs to assess
tourism in many categories such as human landscape,
ecotourism, and natural landscape. For this study, we
specifically examine natural landscapes. Therefore, we used
scenic photographs to reach our aim of making travelers
realize natural landscape intuitively. In addition, it is clearer
to define the research scope. Moreover, we can provide more
tourist attractions options for tourists and reduce crowding at
well-known tourist attractions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
presents an overview of the method. Section III explains the
method used for scenic photograph evaluation. In Section
IV, we present rarely known tourist attraction estimation and
explain our questionnaire results. In Section V, we discuss

improvements to the survey questionnaire and present
conclusions and future works.

OVERVIEW OF THE METHOD
This section introduces an overview of our method, as
shown in Figure 1. Our method comprises two components:
definition of rarely known tourist attractions and data
construction.
Figure 1.
Overview of the method.
A. Definition of Rarely Known Tourist Attractions
To differentiate well-known and rarely known tourist
attractions, we adopt two definitions of rarely known tourist
attractions.
Definition 1: Only some people know about this tourist
attraction.
Definition 2: That tourist attraction deserves to be visited
and it is attractive for tourists.
B. Data Construction
Using Flickr API, we collected 769,749 photographs shot
in 2017 with geolocation in Japan. After extracting the
photographs’ latitude and longitude to gather details of
addresses through Google geocoding API, we sorted the 47
prefectures and 1,159 cities by the number of photo-counts in
descending order. Finally, we used a grouping method of
unequal class interval to divide prefectures and cities into
eight groups, as shown in Table I. This grouping method is
presented in the next section. However, 309 photographs had
no details of addresses because these photographs were shot
in the sky or on the ocean.

We classified these photographs into different prefectures
and cities according to the photographs’ address details. We
calculated the photo-counts in every prefecture and city.

photo-counts.
Furthermore,
we
extracted
2,671
scenic
photographs with tags which mean scenic in English and
Japanese (e.g., ''風景''，"景色", ''scenery''), and collected
these photographs’ comments and favorite counts.

SCENIC PHOTOGRAPH EVALUATION
A. Grouping Method of Unequal Class Interval
In this subtask, we present that the unequal class interval
is a kind of statistical grouping method. This method applies
uneven index values and class intervals of group as
dissimilar. We used a slightly modified method similar to
the one reported by Arjunan et al. [10]. We used this method
to divide the 47 prefectures and 1,159 cities into different
groups according their respective photo-counts.
To complete this grouping method, we employed two
methods.
1)
Reduction rate: By calculating the rate of increase
and reduction, we can observe the numerical change that
is usually used to calculate the mortality rate, rainfall
rate, unemployment rate, etc. [11]–[13]. For this study,
we sorted the prefectures and cities in descending order.
The
reduction
rate
of
prefectures
and
cities
was
calculated
using
equation
(1)
in
the
equation,ݔ௜
represents the count of photographs. Then, after dividing
the data into different groups through observation of the
reduction rate variation, the reduction rate variation
needs to meet two conditions: first is that the reduction
rate must be more than 10%; second is that the reduction
rate must be decreased gradually, then the next reduction

the respective prefectures.


In Table II, we can use the conditions above to divide
the data. Although the second reduction rate meets the
conditions, we still allocate it into group 4 because the city
count of every group must contain at least three cities. The
third and fifth reduction rates of prefecture are gradually
decreased. However, the sixth reduction rate is increased
and it is greater than 10%. We determined the sixth row is
the period with abrupt change and divided the second row to
sixth row into the group 4.

Standard
Deviation
(STDEV):
In
statistics,
the
standard deviation (ݏ) is usually used to measure dispersion
of a set of data values. A greater standard deviation and
greater magnitude will indicate greater deviation of values.

Z-score: z-scores are also called standard scores. In
statistics, z-scores are used to compare an observation to a
standard normal deviate. In the following equation (3),ݔ,ݔ
andݏ represent the count of photographs,ݔ sample average,
and the standard deviation, respectively.

Figure 4.
Z-score analysis of all city data.
4)
Application: The change of the reduction rate might
be readily apparent in the prefectures. Therefore, we only
used the method of reduction to divide them into groups.
For the group method of city data, in Figure 4, we can
observe that about eighty percent cities’ data center on -0.2
to 0, which means these photograph count of data less than
the photograph count of average (656 photos). However, the
data with z-score between 3 and 18 means that the data are
excessively different and that many outliers exist. If we use
only the z-score to group cities’ data, that will show
deviation, thereby we synthesized the methods above to
group the cities’ data. In the first to second group, the
reduction rate of data might be readily apparent. We used
the method of the reduction rate to group.
The reduction rate change might not be readily apparent
(there is little discrepancy of photo-count in group 8).
Groups 3–8 were grouped using their z-scores. Considering
the class interval size of each group, we judged where z-
scores are more than 4 that were divided into the same
group, where z-scores are less than 4 and more than 3 as a
group, where z-scores are less than 3 and more than 2 as a
group , and so on (see Table III). Finally, we used these
methods to divide prefectures and cities into eight groups.
We also defined scores of the respective groups: group 1
can get 8 points, group 2 can get 7 points, and so on.

B. Comments’ Sentiment
Only
viewers’
emotions
need
to
be
considered.
Therefore, we collected the scenic photographs’ comments;
owner’s replies are eliminated from the total comments. We
analyzed the comments and extracted the positive comments,
as shown in Table IV.

We specifically examine English and Chinese comments
by using TextBlob [14] and SnowNLP [15]. The scores of
English comments’ sentiments were -1 to 1. The Chinese
sentiment scores were 0 to 1. The score represents the
probability of positive meaning. Moreover, we discovered
the English comments’ sentiment score of more than 0.3 as
best. It can get higher accuracy. Chinese sentiment scores
should be greater than 0.4.
C. Formula of Evaluation
Considering the definitions of rarely known tourist
attractions and data construction, we propose a formula to
calculate and rank the photograph scores (ܵ௜).
ܵ௜ = ෍ܨ௣௜ܹ௣+ܴ௜
ܶ௜
,0<ܹ௣<1ܽ݊݀෍ܹ௣=1
ଷ
௣ୀଵ
ଷ
௣ୀଵ

In equation (4),ܨଵ௜ represents the prefecture group point;
and ܹଵ isܨଵ௜ weight.ܨଶ௜ represents a city group point; and
ܹଶ isܨଶ௜ weight.ܨଷ௜ represents
the photographs’ favorite
counts and ܹଷ is theܨଷ௜ weight. ܴ௜ represents the positive
comment count of the photographs. ܶ௜ represents the total
comment count of the photographs. In this formula, ܴ௜/ܶ௜ is
regarded as an additional score because most photographs do
not have comments. We supposed the photographs’ favorite
counts and positive comments as factors of attracting
someone to visit. Therefore, we can rank all scenic
photographs by this formula, as shown in Table V.
Table V presents some ranking results. The first column
is the GPS address of the photograph from Google API. The
second column is the neighboring popular tourist attraction.
The third and fourth columns are photograph groups (not the
group score). The fifth column is the favorite count of
photographs. The sixth and seventh columns are counts of
the
photograph’s
comments.
The
last
column
is
the
photograph’s score calculated using our formula. A high
score means that the place deserves travelers to visit. In this
table, the address of the first row is a famous resort in
Okinawa. Additionally, the second row is a hotel on a
famous hot spring street. The third row is a well-known
tourist attraction in Hokkaido. The place of the seventh row
is a renowned and historical temple in Kyoto. Others are
obscure places.
D. Entropy Weight Method (EWM)
For this study, we used EWM to set the weights used for
the formula. EWM is an objective set weight method
because it depends only on the discreteness of data. Actually,
EWM
is
used
widely
in
the
fields
of
engineering,
socioeconomic studies, etc. [16]–[18].
In information theory, entropy is a kind of uncertainty
measure. When information is larger, uncertainty and
entropy will be smaller. Based on the properties of entropy
information, we can estimate the randomness of an event and
the degree of randomness through calculation of the entropy
value. Furthermore, entropy values are used to gauge a sort
of discreteness degree of index. When the degree of
discreteness is larger, the index affecting the integrated
assessment will be greater.
To complete the setting of the formula weights, we
require some steps, as described below.
Calculate the ratio (ܲ௜௝) of the i-th index under the j-th
index. Therein,ݔ௜௝ means the j-th index of the i-th sample.

RARELY KNOWN TOURIST ATTRACTION ESTIMATION
A. Familiarity Level of Japanese City
We designed a questionnaire and administered it to 42
Taiwanese and 40 Japanese participants to ascertain their
level of familiarity with Japanese cities between different
nationalities. Surveying levels of familiarity of cities from
respondents is difficult. For that reason, we grouped the
prefecture and city data. In this way, we were able to select a
city’s name randomly from each group to decrease the
number of questions in the questionnaire. It is easier to
investigate which city is unfamiliar to respondents. A rarely
known tourist attraction might be included in unfamiliar
groups.
According to the scale of each group, 23 cities’ names
were selected randomly in this questionnaire. In addition, a
few background questions of travel were proposed for
respondents (e.g., frequency of travel, age, occupation). We
especially investigated respondents’ preferences of tourist
attractions (e.g., well-known, rarely known).
For these respondents, as shown in Figure 5(a), we
observed that 75 respondents like to travel. More than half of
the respondents like well-known tourist attractions and rarely
known tourist attractions (Figure 5(b)). Respondents were
provided with four choices to answer the city questions: (1) I
have absolutely no idea; (2) I have heard of this city, but I do
not know the relevant tourist attractions; (3) I have heard of
this city and know the relevant tourist attractions; (4) I have
been to this city. If a respondent chooses option (1) the
respondent is assigned 1 point in this question; option (2) can
get 2 points, and so on, with higher scores indicating greater
familiarity with this city.
Finally, we calculated the average scores of respective
groups, as shown in Table VI. The average represents the
city question score (23 questions) average. When the
score of a group is less than average, we categorize this
group as the rarely known one. Figure 5(c) shows that
group 6 – group 8 are unfamiliar to Taiwanese people.
Figure 5(d) shows that Japanese people are unfamiliar
with group 5 – group 8. We removed the familiar groups
from the ranking of Section III as our aim.

B. Verification Experiment
Based on the discussion presented above, we can
ascertain which group is unfamiliar to the Taiwanese (groups
6–8) and to the Japanese (groups 5–8). In this section, we use
the questionnaire to verify these rarely known tourist
attractions, which are obscure but attractive to respondents.

For the verification experiment, we extracted the top 10
rarely known
tourist attractions (from Taiwanese and
Japanese unfamiliar groups) to investigate 10 Taiwanese
(who have touristic experience in Japan) and 10 Japanese.
Two questions were asked for each attraction: “Do you know
this place according to the address?” If respondents probably
know this attraction, then the answer is “Yes”. The second
question is “According to this photograph, do you want to
visit this place?” For the second question, respondents can
score 1–5 for the attraction, with a higher score indicating
greater attraction.
Figure 6 portrays the survey results. Figures 6(a) and 6(b)
present how many people know this place. Figures 6(c) and
6(d) explain the level of attractiveness to respondents. In this
questionnaire, we observed that each respondent knows two
places out of ten on average. For Taiwanese participants, the
average score of the places was 4.07. Furthermore, for
Japanese participants, the average was 3.83. This result
demonstrates that these places were known by a minority of
respondents, but they still want to visit there. Results
demonstrate that our research was successful.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
People from different countries have distinct familiarity
with Japanese cities. We proposed a novel method to
ascertain rarely known tourist attractions for people of
different nationalities. By collecting and analyzing Flickr
photograph information, we classified them into different
prefectures and cities. Subsequently, we classified these
prefectures and cities into eight groups.
Additionally,
we
used
a
questionnaire
to
survey
Taiwanese
participants
and
Japanese
participants.
We
obtained the unfamiliar city groups of Taiwanese and
Japanese participants. The scenic photographs were ranked
using the formula for this research. We then removed the
familiar city groups in the result of ranking for respondent.
By a second questionnaire survey, we verified our results.
Consequently, through this research, we were able to
discover rarely known tourist attractions for travelers.
From
the
questionnaire
survey,
we
obtained
the
surprising result that Taiwanese participants are more
familiar with Japanese cities than Japanese participants are.
The reason might be that Taiwan and Japan are neighboring
countries. In addition, air travel from Taiwan to Japan is
cheaper, which might lead to higher frequency of Taiwanese
taking trips to Japan. We also discovered that most
Taiwanese respondents prefer individual travel in Japan to
travelling
with
groups.
Furthermore,
the
questionnaire
results demonstrated that income has little to do with travel
frequency.
As future work, we expect to collect and analyze more
photographs taken in distinct years. Then, we will try to use
different
methods
of
grouping
and
comparing
them.
Considering more factors of discovering rarely known tourist
attractions, we expect to improve the formula used for this
research. Rarely known tourist attractions will be classified
into different seasons, weather, days, and nights according to
photograph times and contents. We also want to provide a
personal
recommendation
service
using
Collaborative
Filtering (CF).
