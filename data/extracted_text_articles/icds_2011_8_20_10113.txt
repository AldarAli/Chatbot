Abstract—Physical layer measurements for an infrastructure
802.11 Multichannel MultiBand Wireless Mesh Network testbed
are described. Each wireless router node design consists of a
Linux processor with multiple 802.11b/g transceivers operating in
the 5 GHz band for backhauling, and multiple 802.11 transceivers
in the 2.4 GHz band for end-user service. Each transceiver
consists of a MAC and base-band processor (BBP) in addition to
a radio. A Linux-based device driver has been modiﬁed to adjust
the physical layer parameters. The 802.11 standard speciﬁes
three orthogonal channels, 1, 6, and 11. The routers can be
programmed to implement any static mesh binary tree topology
by assigning orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)
channels to network edges. The routers can be programmed to
implement any general mesh communication topology by using
a time division multiple access (TDMA) frame schedule, and
assigning OFDM channels to network edges within each TDMA
frame. Preliminary measurements of co-channel interference and
the signal to interference and noise (SINR) ratio for the network
testbed are presented, using omni-directional antenna and the
802.11b operation mode. This data can be used to optimize
the performance of large infrastructure Wireless Mesh networks
using 802.11 technology.

I. INTRODUCTION
Multihop infrastructure wireless mesh networks (WMNs)
as shown in Fig. 1 represent a low-cost access network tech-
nology, which can potentially provide ’last-mile’ accessibility
to much of the world. Industry estimates that by 2020 there
will be several billion wireless devices, providing a range
of new services. WMNs represents a promising infrastruc-
ture for supporting these wireless devices, as well providing
general communications infrastructure for homes and ofﬁces.
However, capacity and scalability are key challenges for such
networks. Multichannel multiband meshes can use multiple
radio channels in multiple frequency bands to improve system
capacity and throughput. For example, channels in the 5 GHz
band can implement the mesh backhauling trees between Base-
Stations (BSs) in Fig. 1, and channels in the 2.4 GHz band
can implement the communications between the Base-Stations
and end-users. The optimized design of such WMNs requires
statistics on physical layer noise and co-channel interference.
However, to date there have been very few published measure-
ments for co-channel interference and signal-to-interference-
and-noise ratios encountered in practical WMN testbeds. To

address this problem, an 802.11 WMN testbed has been
developed and detailed noise and interference measurements
are reported.
This paper presents a small mesh testbed composed of IEEE
802.11b nodes operating in IBSS (ad-hoc) mode, called the
Next-Generation (NG) Mesh. Each network node contains mul-
tiple wireless transceivers controlled in a Linux environment.
To study co-channel interference between WiFi channels in
the 2.4 GHz ISM band, preliminary physical layer (PHY)
measurements for the received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
and SINR are reported. The IEEE has speciﬁed standards
for co-channel interference in 802.11 standard [1]. Fig. 2a
illustrates the 11 channels in the 802.11 WiFi standard in the
2.4 GHz band. Each channel requires 22 MHz and channels
are separated by 5 MHz. Channels 1, 6 and 11 are logically
orthogonal, i.e., their spectrum is non-overlapping. The IEEE
802.11b spectral mask shown in Fig. 2b mandates a drop of
at least 30 dBm at a displacement of 11 MHz (two channels)
from the active channel. The standard also mandates a drop of
at least 50 dBm at a displacement of 22 MHz (four channels).
The spectral mask requirement ensures adequate attenuation
between 802.11 channels in the ISM band. However, the
spectral mask requirements apply to a single device tested in
isolation, and will not apply to a real network deployment due
to interference from multiple networks and other microwave
devices.
In order to test the co-channel interference and SINRs in

a practical 802.11 network deployment, a large ﬁle transfer
was performed over one channel in the NG Mesh testbed, and
the interference on the other 10 WiFi channels was measured.
Using 15 dBm of transmission power over very short (5
meter) wireless links and a datarate of 11 Mbps, SINRs in
that range of 20 - 30 dBm were consistently measured. In a
large deployment these SINRs are typically reduced according
to the distance cubed. Furthermore, the wireless link quality
was largely static with no noticeable changes over any 24
hour period, except for changes in activity in remote 802.11
networks. Given the lack of published data on SINRs in
realistic network testbeds, this data may help optimize network
designs.
Section 2 summarizes other recent wireless networking
testbeds that report physical layer metrics. Section 3 describes
the design of the NG-Mesh. Section 4 presents the physical
layer measurements of NG-Mesh. Section 5 closes with our
conclusion and future work.
II. RELATED WORK
Some other recently published wireless testbed designs that
consider physical layer measurements are discussed next. Like
NG-Mesh, all of them employ a Linux OS and multiple IEEE
802.11 wireless transceivers at each network node. In [2], a
wireless network was installed in a natural reserve spanning
several kilometers to collect ecological data. Each mesh node
consists of multiple 802.11b/g wireless transceivers capable
of multi-channel communication. The testbed was used to
investigate the correlation between packet error rate (PER) and
RSSI, to evaluate improvements in rate control algorithms and
routing protocols. In [3], a campus-wide 802.11b/g WMN was
used to provide internet access. Due to the close proximity of
the mesh nodes, a high degree of co-channel interference was
present. Although physical layer metrics such as the signal to
noise ratio (SNR) were collected, no solution was proposed to
mitigate the interference.
In [4], a mesh network composed of quickly deployable
relay nodes was formed to target real-time emergency com-
munication services. SNR measurements were used to infer
link quality to guide the deployment of additional relay nodes.
A case study concluded that SNR statistics reported by com-
mercially available radios accurately indicate link reliability. In
contrast to PER statistics, which report transmission errors that
have already occurred, SNR measurements provide predictions
of link failures before they occur. In [5], an 802.11a testbed
was used to measure handoff latency of high-speed vehicles
roaming between stationary road-side access points (APs).
Handoff between APs occur whenever the link between the
mobile station (MS) and the currently associated AP exhibits
an RSSI that is lower than a pre-deﬁned threshold.
In [6], a formula was derived for the amount of signal atten-
uation required for a small-scale network testbed to emulate a
large-scale network, reﬂecting the different inter-node spacing.
The transmit power and the inter-node spacings of the wireless
interfaces were scaled down accordingly, allowing a small
testbed (spanning a few meters) to emulate the large network
for testing purposes. Variable attenuators (Broadwave 751-
002-030 devices) were used. In contrast, the NG-Mesh testbed
employs a modiﬁed Serialmonkey [7] Linux-based device in
order to control the physical layer characteristics including
the transmission frequency (WiFi channel) and transmission
power.
In summary, while a number of 802.11 testbeds have been
developed to date there are no detailed measurements of co-
channel interference and SINRs in such network testbeds. In
contrast to the previous testbeds, the NG-Mesh will be used
to collect RSSI and SINR measurements on each channel
in the ISM spectrum given an isolated ﬁle transfer on one
speciﬁc WiFi channel. This data may be useful to optimize
the performance of future WiFi WMN deployments.

A. The Testbed Conﬁguration
As shown in Fig. 3, one node in the NG-mesh testbed
consists of four Linksys WUSB54Gv4 wireless transceivers
that connect to one PC via a non-attenuating four-port USB
hub. The 4 wireless transceivers provide the capability to
transmit or receive on c ≤ 4 channels simultaneously. For
example, each node can be conﬁgured to permanently receive
on 2 arbitrary channels and transmit on one arbitrary channel.
Alternatively, each node can be programmed to transmit or re-
ceive on selected channels in selected intervals of time, thereby
implementing a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) style
of mesh network.
To perform our experiments, the transceivers associated
with one node were placed 5 meters apart. One pair of
transceivers was conﬁgured to transmit a large ﬁle over a
given WiFi channel using a UDP socket. Another transceiver
was conﬁgured as an interference measurement device, to
receive on a different WiFi channel from which RSSI and
SINR measurements could be made. The transceivers in the
NG-Mesh are conﬁgured to operate in ad-hoc mode with
each being assigned a unique IP address and each tunable to
different radio frequencies. The conﬁguration of all network
transceivers are performed via the central PC console using
Linux network conﬁguration utilities such as iwconﬁg.
The testbed can be extended in several ways. More wireless
transceivers can be connected to one node, thereby enabling
one node with a small footprint to emulate a larger virtual net-
work. Alternatively, multiple NG mesh nodes can be deployed
over a large geographic region.
B. The Wireless Interfaces
The Linksys WUSB54Gv4 transceiver has a retractable
2 dBi omni-directional antenna and requires no propri-
etary ﬁrmware. Each Linksys transceiver contains the Ralink
RT2570 (MAC/BBP) and RT2525E (transceiver) chipsets. In
the 2.4 GHz band, the radio is tunable between 2.412 GHz and
2.484 GHz. In the 5 GHz band, the radio is tunable between
5.180 GHz and 5.805 GHz. The allowable channel subsets
are determined by the PHY mode and geographic region. The
PHY modes of IEEE 802.11a, b, and g are referenced in the
driver source code but by default, the PHY mode and channel
are set to IEEE 802.11b and 1 respectively. The bit-rates
supported by this chipset are 1, 2, 5.5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 18, 24, 36,
48, and 54 Mbps although it was found that only a maximum
bit-rate of 11 Mbps was conﬁgurable in ad-hoc mode. The
maximum transmission power output of this chipset is 100
mw (20 dBm). According to speciﬁcations [8], the receiver
sensitivity is nominally in the range of -65 dBm to -80 dBm.
Within the Linux community, there is an active project
maintained by a team of developers known as Serialmonkey
who maintains and enhances open-source Linux-based device
drivers for Ralink chipsets. Their legacy drivers from the May
12, 2009 build were selected to operate the wireless interfaces
of NG-Mesh. All Serialmonkey [7] and Ralink driver code
bases [9] are written in the C programming language.
Fig. 3.
Node conﬁguration.
The Serialmonkey legacy drivers for Ralink chipsets rely on
a periodically executed code segment within a function called
CMDHandler. By implementing a channel switching function
call AsicSwitchChannel in software in the CMDHandler, a
maximum frequency retuning rate of one channel switch
every 30 ms was achieved. This measurement indicates that a
TDMA-based WiFi network can achieve channel changes at
rates of 33 Hz in software. According to the IEEE standard
[1], much faster channel change times of 224 µsec can be
achieved in hardware.
C. The Wi-Spy Spectrum Analyzer
Our preliminary measurements were made using an in-
expensive MetaGeek Wi-Spy 2.4i entry-level ISM spectrum
analyzer. The software is freely downloadable from [10] [11]
for Windows, Mac, or Linux and can be used to plot real-time
distributions of the energy in the ISM band. The software
also computes the average and peak energies over time per
frequency, and can also use a separate wireless interface to
detect proximate WiFi networks. The MetaGeek Chanalyzer
Lite software enables this device to scan the frequency range
of 2.4 - 2.492 GHz and report the energy in the range -102
- 6.5 dBm, in 375 kHz and 0.5 dBm increments respectively,
roughly once per second. Under Linux, Kismet’s Spectrum-
Tools software enables the device to scan the frequency range
of 2.4 - 2.483 GHz and report four-hundred-and-nineteen
samples every 30 ms in 199 KHz steps.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A communication link was established by conﬁguring one
transceiver to transmit on the primary WiFi channel, and a
second transceiver to receive on the same channel. Another
transceiver was conﬁgured to receive on a secondary channel,
to obtain co-channel interference measurements. The Wi-
Spy spectrum analyzer was also conﬁgured to monitor the
secondary channel. The transmit power of both communication
endpoints were ﬁxed at 15 dBm via device driver modiﬁcations
while all ﬁle transmissions were performed at the 802.11b bit-
rate of 11 Mbps. All of the subsequent experiments took place
in a room measuring sixteen square meters within a residential
neighborhood. Remote APs were detected on channels 1 (-92

dBm), 6 (-84 dBm), and 11 (-97 dBm) at the test site during
testing.
In each experiment, a large 100 MB ﬁle was transmitted
over the primary WiFi channel using UDP socket transfers.
The background noise level was measured using one of the
RT2570 interfaces operating in monitor mode and was veriﬁed
using the Wi-Spy spectrum analyzer. The average noise level
at the test site was reported by this device to be -99 dBm, with
some occasional ﬂuctuations at various channels, especially 1,
6, and 11, due to intermittent activity on remote networks. The
monitor nodes also reported the power on each channel due to
activity on remote WiFi networks. Most remote channels had
powers in the range of -100 to -90 dBm, which we believe
were beacon powers. These power measurements were not
reported as noise by the device. However, spurious emissions
with magnitudes of -80 or -70 dBm were observed on many
channels, perhaps several times a minute. We believe that
these spurious emissions were caused by remote user activity,
though no exact measurements of remote beacons and noise
were made due to the lack of access to state-of-the-art test
equipment in our preliminary experiments.
Table II and Table III organize the RSSI and SINR data as
reported by the Wi-Spy device during ﬁle transmission on each
of the wireless channels, into a 2D matrix. The RSSI data in
the tables were collected using Kismet’s spectool raw utility.
A shell script was written to compute the average of the RSSI
readings in each channel during ﬁle transfer activities. The
SINR matrix was then computed from the RSSI matrix using:
SINRdBm = SignaldBm − (Noise + Interference)dBm.
As conﬁrmed earlier, the background noise level was reported
by the monitor nodes to be -99 dBm most of the time. The
interference power was reported per channel separately. The
highlighted main diagonal in the matrices represents the active
channels. Additional data on the RSSI and SINR are reported
in the 2D and 3D MATLAB plots shown in Fig. 4 to Fig. 6.
In Fig. 5 and 6, each uniquely color-coded line represents a
ﬁle transfer conducted at a particular WiFi channel. Given the
ﬁle transfer on one channel, the signal strength was measured
on each of the other channels using the Wi-Spy spectral
analyzer.
Referring to the tables, the peak signal energy is always at
the primary channel. Moving two channels away, i.e., a dis-
placement of approx. 11 MHz, the signal attenuation is approx.
20 dB, yielding interference about 10 dBm above the IEEE
spectral mask requirement. Moving 4 channels away causes
an additional attenuation of (0 to 5) dB, yielding interference
about 20 dBm above the IEEE spectral mask requirement.
These results are likely due to interference from remote WiFi
activity. The attenuation requirements speciﬁed by the IEEE
802.11b spectral mask shown in Fig. 2b apply to one device
in isolation, and interference from other devices limits the
SINRs in practice. Measurements of co-channel interference
and SINRs for typical WiFi testbeds has not previously been
quantiﬁed and published, so we cannot compare our results
with any others.
Fig. 7a demonstrates per-channel activity in real-time along
with a spectral density plot. These results were produced by
the Chanalyzer Lite software under the Windows OS. Fig. 7b
illustrates the power levels at different frequencies of the ISM
spectrum during ﬁle transfers. The test1 conﬁguration uses a
ﬁle transfer on wireless channel 1. The red specs represent the
most frequently occurring energy readings. Therefore, during
a ﬁle transmission on channel 1 the red outline indicates the
mean RSSI levels to be around -70 dBm, with the RSSI drop-
ping to about -100 dBm two channels away which conforms
to the 802.11b spectral mask requirements.
Although the 802.11b bit-rate was conﬁgured as 11 Mbps,
the average bit-rate was calculated from empirical measure-
ments for veriﬁcation. The average effective data rate was 3.96
Mbps, only 36.01% of the conﬁgured speed, which roughly
coincides with the results of previously published data [6].
Referring to the 2D matrices and Fig. 4, 5, 6 and 7, the
co-channel interference drops by about 20 dBm when the
secondary channel is 2 channels away from the primary, as
stated earlier. However, the interference increases when the
secondary channel is 3 channels away. These observations
are inconsistent with the IEEE spectral mask requirements.
This pattern is repeated for every primary channel from 1-
11, indicating that it cannot be explained by uncorrelated
remote user activity. Referring to Fig. 2b, the spectral power
density before the mast is applied is shown by the sinc()
curves, and the interference power appears to increase at a
distance of 3 channels. However, after the mask is applied
the interference power should decrease at a distance of 3
channels. We compared our preliminary measurements with
theoretical results on co-channel interference presented in [12],
with similar observations. We plan to secure access to state-of-
the-art measurement equipment and repeat the measurements,
to precisely quantify the effects of remote WiFi activity.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
An 802.11b wireless mesh network testbed was developed
using commercially available wireless transceivers and soft-
ware. A single node design consists of multiple wireless
transceivers which can be individually conﬁgured, i.e., the
transmission / reception frequency, the transmission power,
and data rate of each transceiver can be conﬁgured from a
device driver in the Linux OS. Each node can be extended in
several ways. Multiple wireless transceivers can be added to
one node, to emulate a larger network virtually. Alternatively,
multiple nodes can be deployed over a large geographic area,
to implement a large mesh network as shown in Fig. 1. The op-
timization of a large network requires realistic statistics on co-
channel interference and SINRs. Our testbed was conﬁgured to
enable a large UDP ﬁle transfer on one channel over a short
distance, and RSSI and SINR measurements were recorded
on all other channels. Our measurements indicate that at a
displacement of 2 channels or 10 MHz, the signal attenuation
is -20 dBm. At a displacement of 4 channels or 20 MHz,
the signal attenuation varies from -20 dBm to -25 dBm. This
data indicates that interference from other WiFi networks and
other microwave devices in the 2.4 GHz band is noticable in a

practical mesh deployment. Our measurements were made in
the early hours of the morning, and it is expected that the SINR
may drop during regular business hours when more activity on
remote WiFi networks will be present. We plan to quantify the
interference due to remote users more thoroughly once access
to state-of-the-art measuring equipment is secured. The work
can be extended in several ways. The current testbed uses
802.11b transceivers with omni-directional antenna. Currently,
open-source Linux-based device drivers for 802.11n devices
are available but they are unstable. The same experiments
can likely be performed within a year or two using the lat-
est generation 802.11n transceivers, open-source Linux-based
device drivers, with MIMO directional antenna. We expect
802.11n devices to offer a signiﬁcant increase in throughput
with improvements to the co-channel interference and SINR
measurements.
