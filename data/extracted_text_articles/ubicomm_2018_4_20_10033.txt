Abstract— It is challenging to prevent various kinds of
offenses, such as bicycle theft or street snatching. Machine
learning techniques, like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
Bayesian Network (BN), are considered to be promising
technologies to assess the risk of such offenses. However,
applying these technologies is not easy and some problems
include preparation of missing data, providing reasons, and
multi –level classification of risks. In this paper, we propose a
method to solve these problems. We applied our proposed
method on an example of risk information provision system on
bicycle parking lots; the results showed the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

INTRODUCTION
It is challenging to prevent various kinds of offenses,
such as bicycle theft or street snatching. PredPol, which
predicts crimes by using data of past offenses, has been used
in the city of Santa Cruz, California, USA, and, as a result,
contributed to decreasing the crime rate of that city [1].
The risk of accidents for a specified situation should be
assessed using many factors, and so it is difficult to model
crime
occurrence
mechanism
mathematically.
Machine
learning techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
Bayesian Network (BN) are considered to be promising
technology for this purpose.
However, we have the following three problems for
applying the techniques. The first problem is preparation of
missing data. Machine learning techniques require as
learning data both accident data that occurred in the past
and non-accident data that did not occur. The problem is
that, in general, non-accident data do not exist in the
database, and, in addition, accident data in the database
often have missing items in it. We should prepare such
missing data and data items. The second problem is
provision of reasons. Most machine learning techniques do
not present reasons for the assessment results, which makes
the user is doubtful of the results because he does not
recognize why the situation is unsafe. The third problem is
multi-level
classification
of
risks.
Machine
learning
techniques can classify the situation into safe or unsafe.
Such a classification alone could not satisfy the user needs
for determining what behavior to take. Although some
techniques can provide the probability for the result, it is
unlikely to be the real probability for the occurrence of the
accidents due to the first problem.
We propose a method to solve the above three problems
when using machine learning techniques to assess the risk
of a specified situation based on accident database. As
target machine learning techniques, we use SVM [2] and
BN [3].
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II
describes an Internet of Things (IoT) system, as an example
to which the proposed method is applied. Section III
addresses the three problems, and the Section IV provides
the method for solving them. We conclude the work in
Section V.

A RISK INFORMATION PROVISION SYSTEM ON
BICYCLE PARKING LOTS
This section describes an IoT system, as an example to
which the proposed method is applied: Risk information
provision system on bicycle parking lots [4], called RaBiPL.
Figure 1. Risk information provision system on bicycle parking lots
(RabiPL)
Figure 1 shows what devices the system uses and how it
works. The system provides risk information for a specified
situation to prevent from bicycle theft. This system works
with IoT bicycles [5], which have various sensors and
3G/WiFi connection. The server of the system at the service
provider site gets environmental information, based on
which it assesses the risk of theft for the situation. The

results are provided to the user’s smart device upon request.
The server performs the risk assessment by analyzing the
environmental information stored on the server.
TABLE 1.
ENVIRONMENT INFORMATION
Environmental information includes:
(1) Properties of bicycle, such as model and price,
(2) Regional characteristics, such as the number of crimes,
(3) Time, such as time zone and day of week, and
(4) Surrounding environment, such as pedestrian traffic.
TI shows the four types of environmental information and
the method to obtain it.

RESEARCH PROBLEMS
A. Problem1: Preparetion of missing data
Machine learning techniques require as learning data
both accident data that occurred in the past and non-
accident data that did not occur.
The problem is that in general, non-accident data do not
exist in the database, and in addition, accident data in the
database often have missing items in the data.
In the case of RabiPL, their victims report many bicycle
thefts, and their data are available on the Web [6], but each
data may have missing elements, such as bicycle’s color,
and weather in which it occurred. Of course, there is no data
for the situation where bicycle thefts did not occur.
B. Problem2: Provision of reasons
Most machine learning techniques do not present
reasons for the assessment results, which makes the user
doubtful of the results because he does not recognize why
the situation is unsafe.
In the case of RabiPL, if the system informs its user that
the risk that bicycle theft will occur in his situation is high,
only the result may not convince him to stop parking there.
Problem3: Multi-Level Classification of risks
Machine learning techniques can classify the situation
into safe or unsafe. Such a classification alone could not
satisfy the user needs for determining his behavior to take.
Although some techniques provide probability of the
result, it is not a true value for the accidents. Therefore, it is
necessary to show how high the risk is at multiple levels so
that the user can easily decide what to do.
In the case of RabiPL, users want to know that his
situation is not risky, a little risky, risky, or very risky so
that he can make a decision on whether he will park or not,
considering his need to do it.

PROPOSED METHOD AND ITS APPLICATION
A. Preparation of missing data
We propose a method to solve the three problems
mentioned in Section 3 and describe its application.
1)
Proposed method for preparation of missing data
To solve Problem 1, we propose the following
method to prepare accident data with missing data
items and non-accident data.
 Missing data items in accident data:
 What can be obtained with sensors: field work
 Others: randomly created value
 Non-accident data (the same number as that of the
accident data) :
 Place (Randomly selected from where the accidents
did not occurred)
 Time (Randomly selected)
 Others:
 What can be obtained with sensors: field work
 Others: randomly created value
“Field work” is to go where the specified situation can
be realized to collect data by using sensors.
2)
Application to RabiPL
 Missing data items for theft occurrence data:
 Using the theft data on the Web [6]
 Obtaining regional characteristics from a Web
service by searching by the current location
 Missing data:
 Information
on
surrounding
environment
(traffic lights, illuminance, etc.): obtaining the
data items by "field work" at the place where
theft occurred
 Non-theft occurrence environment data:
 Randomly selecting the same number of non-theft
data where no theft occurred in the publicly
available list of the bicycle parking lots
 Getting location of the lots
 Randomly selecting time and properties of the
bicycle
 Obtaining regional characteristics from location
with the Web service
 Collecting non-theft environmental data with
field work

obtained

In the "field work", we collected data for five
minutes to use the average value of the measured
sensor data.
Using the above method, we made 25 theft
occurrence environmental data in the perfect form and
created 25 non-theft data, and we were able to prepare
50 cases in total.
B. Provision of reasons
To solve Problem 2, we propose the following method to
provide reasons and describe its application.
1)
Proposed method for providing reasons
We adopt Bayesian Network [3] as the applied
machine learning technique, which is a probabilistic
graphical model (a type of statistical model) that
represents a set of variables and their conditional
dependencies via a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
[6].
When using BN, intermediate nodes are chosen to
explain the reasons for the assessment results, which
have been an established common sense through
statistical analysis conducted so far.
Then, after the assessment, choose the factors from
those with higher risks than thresholds as the reason of
the assessment.
2)
Application to RabiPL
From the analysis on the theft of bicycles [7], we
select
the
following
four
major
factors
as
the
intermediate nodes of the BN.
・ Existence of those who want to steal
・ Low possibility of detection
・ Attractiveness of the bicycle
・ Easiness to steal
Then, we link all the factors to the intermediate
nodes. With regard to RabiPL, we linked all the
environmental
information
items
to
the
four
intermediate nodes, as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2.Relationship between intermediate nodes and environment
information
Figure 3 shows an example to show the reason of the
assessment result.
 The user wants to know why theft risk is high.
 The system selects the intermediate nodes that are the
major contributors of the result. In this case, two nodes:
“Low possibility of detection” and “Easiness to steal”
are chosen.
 The system selects the environmental information
items
that
contribute
to
the
probability
of
the
intermediate nodes and exceed the threshold. In Figure
4, two items: “Pedestrian traffic” and “Time zone” are
chosen.
Figure 3.Relationship between intermediate nodes and environment
information 2
 The system provides abstract and detailed reasons for
the
user,
by
using
the
intermediate
nodes
and
environmental information items, as shown in Figure 4.

C. Multi-Level classification of risks
To solve Problem 3, we propose the following method to
provide multi-level classification of risks and describe its
application.
1)
Proposed method for multi level risk classification
We also adopt Bayesian Network as the applied
machine
learning
technique,
which
provides
a
probability value with the result. As mentioned before,
the value is not the real probability of the occurrence of
the accidents because of the Problem 1.
Therefore, we propose the following method to
classify the result into N levels based on its probability
value.
n: the number of data items.

Divide the sequence into N as follows.
ܵ௜ = ൫݀௟೔, ････, ݀௠೔൯

ܲ(݀௠ೖషభ) < ܲ(݀) ≤ ܲ(݀௠ೖ)
Where
ܲ(݀௠బ) = 0
ܲ൫݀௠ಿ൯ = 100
2)
Application to RabiPL
In
the
case
of
RabiPL,
we
set
the
number
of
classification level to three: high, medium and low. The
number of training data used was 30, including 15 theft data
and 15 non-theft data.
Figure 5 illustrates how the proposed method determines
threshold values to classify a probability value into a certain
level. In Figure 5, the horizontal axis is the probability value
of the learning data: ݀௜, and the vertical axis is the sequence
number i. The sequence numbers: 10 and 20 divide the set of
learning data into three levels, and so the corresponding
probability values P1 and P2 can be used as the thresholds
that classify a probability value into a certain level: low,
medium, or high.
Figure 5. How to determine the risk
We use six theft data and four non-theft data as test data
to evaluate the assessment results using the thresholds that
the proposed method determined. Based on this data, the
evaluation
was
made
on
multiple
levels
of
risk
determination.
Figure 6. Evaluation on risk assessment
Figure 6 shows the probability values for test data, in
which data 1-6 are theft data and data 7-10 are non-theft
data. From this result, five out of six theft data are classified
into high or medium level, and three out of four non-theft
data are classified into low or medium level. This result
shows this method gives us a good classifier of the inferred
results.
V.
CONCLUSION
We proposed a set of methods to solve three problems
that machine learning techniques have when they are
applied to the risk assessment based on accident database.
We applied the proposed methods to risk assessment for
bicycle theft, which shows a good performance of the
methods, although a relatively small number of data are
used for the experiment.
The proposed methods should be applied to risk
assessment for other types of accidents so that it can prove
useful more widely.
