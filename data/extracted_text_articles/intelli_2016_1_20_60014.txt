Abstract—Recent research topics in bionics focus on the analysis
and synthesis of animal spatial perception of their environment
by means of their tactile sensory organs: vibrissae and their
follicles. Using the vibrissae, these mammals (e.g., rats) are able
to determine an obstacle shape using only a few contacts of the
vibrissa with the object. The investigations lead to the task of
creating models and a stringent exploitation of these models in
form of analytical and numerical calculations to achieve a better
understanding of this sense. The sensing lever element vibrissa
for the stimulus transmission is frequently modeled as an Euler-
Bernoulli bending rod. We assume that the rod is one-sided
clamped and interacts with a rigid obstacle in the plane. But,
most of the literature is limited to the research on cylindrical and
straight, or tapered and straight rods. The (natural) combination
of a cylindrical and pre-curved shape is rarely analyzed. The aim
is to determine the obstacles contour by one quasi-static sweep
along the obstacle and to ﬁgure out the dependence on the pre-
curvature of the rod. To do this, we proceed in several steps:
At ﬁrst, we have to determine the support reactions during a
sweep. These support reactions are equate with the observables
an animal solely relies on and have to be measured by a technical
device. Then, the object shape has to be reconstructed in using
only these generated observables. The consideration of the pre-
curvature makes the analytical treatment a bit harder and results
in numerical solutions of the process. But, the analysis of the
problem results in an extension of a former decision criterion for
the reconstruction by the radius of pre-curvature. Is is possible
to determine a formula for the contact point of the rod with the
proﬁle, which is new in literature in context of pre-curvature.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the development of vibrissae-inspired
tactile sensors gain center stage in the focus of research,
especially in the ﬁeld of (autonomous) robotics, see e.g., [1] –
[5]. These tactile sensors complement to and/or replace senses
like vision, because they provide reliable information (object
distance, contour and surface texture) in a dark and noisy
environment (e.g., seals detect freshet and turbulence of ﬁsh
in muddy water [6] [7] [8]), and are cheaper in fabrication.
Most mammals exhibit such vibrissae, in a variety of types
and located in various areas of the skin/fur. Vibrissae differ
from typical body hairs: they are thicker, longer, embedded
in an own visco-elastic support (the so-called “follicle-sinus
complex” (FSC)), see also [9] for some illustrations. Moreover,
they feature a pre-curvature, a conical shape, cylindrical cross-
section and are made of different material with hollow parts
(like a multi-layer system) [10] [11] [12]. The vibrissa mainly
serves as a force transmission (due to an obstacle contact) to
its support. Hence, movement and deformation of the vibrissa
can only be detected by mechanoreceptors in the FSC [1]
[13]. It is hypothesized, that changing the blood-pressure in the
FSC allows the animal to adjust the stiffness of the tissue to
control the movement of the vibrissa [10] [12]. Furthermore,
the surrounding tissue (ﬁbrous band) and muscles (intrinsic
and extrinsic musculature) enable the animal to actively move
the vibrissa (active mode for surface texture detection) or to
passively return the vibrissa to a rest position after deﬂection
(due to a obstacle contact in passive mode) [14]. The pre-
curvature is due to a kind of protection role: purely axial forces
are prevented and, including the conical shape, the area of the
tip of the vibrissa is limp. This results in a tangential contact
to an object [10] [15].
In this paper, the investigations focus the inﬂuence of
the pre-curvature to the static bending behavior of a vibrissa
in context of obstacle contour detection and reconstruction.
We describe a quasi-static scanning process of obstacles: 1.
analytical/numerical generation the observables in the support
which an animal solely relies on, 2. reconstruction of the
scanned proﬁle contour using only these observables, and 3.
veriﬁcation of the working principle by means of experiments.
These steps were done in [5], [16] and [17] for cylindrical
vibrissae. Therefore, we extend these results to pre-curved
vibrissae in this paper.
The paper is arranged as follows: In Section II, a short
overview of the related literature is given. Based on these
information, Section III deals with aspects of setting up a
mechanical model for the object sensing and presenting the
describing equations. These equations are exemplarily solved
in Section IV – considering only a constant pre-curvature
radius of the bending rod. The results governed by numerical
simulations are veriﬁed by experiments in Section V. Sec-
tion VI concludes the paper.

SOME STATE OF ART OF PRE-CURVED VIBRISSAE
From the biological point of view, there are a lot of
works focussing on the determination of vibrissae parameters.
Towal et al. [12] pointed out an important fact that the
mostly vibrissae are curved in a plane. The deviation of the
vibrissa from this plane (referred to the length) is less than

0.1%. In [12], [15] and [18] – [22], a vibrissa is described
using a polynomial approximation of 2nd-, 3rd- and 5th-order,
which is rather low. In contrast to this references, we present
numerical results using one of order 10. In [15], it is stated
that approximately 90% of rat vibrissae exhibit a pre-curvature
κ0 ∈ (0.0065/mm, 0.074/mm), and in [20] that extremely
curved vibrissa provide κ0 > 0.25/mm. The authors of [11],
[15], [20] publish the following dimensionless parameters
L
d ≈ 30 ,
r0
d ≈ 90 ,
whereas L is the length, d is the base diameter, and r0 is the
pre-curvature radius of the vibrissa.
From the technical point of view, pre-curved vibrissae are
rarely used in applications. In [15], [21], [22], experimental
and theoretical investigations concerning the distance detection
to a pole are presented, using a pre-curved artiﬁcial vibrissa,
also incorporating the conical shape. The pros and cons of
a positive (curvature forward, CF) and negative (CB) curved
vibrissae are stated in [15] whereas the vibrissa is used for
tactile sensing of a pole. The CF-scanning results in low
axial forces, but higher sheer ones; CB the inverse results.
Summarized, the pre-curvature inﬂuences mainly the support
forces instead of the support moment.
III.
MODELING
This section shall serve as an introduction to the proﬁle
scanning procedure.
Beam Deﬂection Formula: The deﬂection of a largely
deformed beam with pre-curvature is described in using the
so-called Winkler-Bach-Theory. A detailed derivation of the
equations can be found in [23] and [24]. Furthermore, the
authors in [24] pointed out, that – assuming, that the radius of
pre-curvature is much greater than the dimensions of the cross-
section – the inﬂuence of the normal force can be neglected.
Hence, the describing equations can be simpliﬁed to
dφ(s)
ds
=
1
r0(s) + Mbs(s)
E Iz
,
(1)
with second moment of area
Iz :=
∫
A
η2dA ,
and Young’s modulus E, cross-section A, bending moment
Mbs, and radius of pre-curvature r0.
Scanning Procedure: Here, we describe the scanning pro-
cedure of strictly convex proﬁle contours using pre-curved
technical vibrissae in a plane. This is done in two steps:
1.
Because of analytical interest, we ﬁrstly generate the
observables (support reactions) during the scanning
process. Since our intension is from bionics, we sim-
ply model the support as a clamping (being aware that
this does not match the reality). Hence, the support
reactions are the clamping forces and moment ⃗MAz,
⃗FAx, ⃗FAy, which an animal solely relies on.
2.
Then, we use these observables in an algorithm to
reconstruct the proﬁle contour.
Fig. 1 sketches the scanning process of a plane, strictly proﬁle.
For this scanning process, several assumptions are made:
0
y
Figure 1. Scanning procedure using an artiﬁcial vibrissa; adapted from [5].
•
The technical vibrissa is moved from right to the left
(negative x-direction), i.e., the base point is moved.
•
The problem is handled quasi-statically, i.e., the vib-
rissa is moved incrementally (and presented in changes
of the boundary conditions). Then, the elastically
deformed vibrissa is determined.
•
Since we do not want to deal with friction at the
beginning, we assume an ideal contact, i.e., the contact
force is perpendicular to the contact point tangent of
the proﬁle.
The scanned proﬁle is given by a function g : x 7→ g(x),
where g ∈ C1(R; R). Since the graph of g is convex by
assumption, the graph can be parameterized by means of the
slope angle α in the xy-plane. Then we have, [5]:
dg(x)
dx
= g′(x) = tan(α)
−→ x
= ξ(α) := g′−1(
tan(α)
)
y
= η(α) := g
(
ξ(α)
)
Therefore, each point of the proﬁle contour is given by
(ξ(α), η(α)), α ∈ (− π
2 , π
2 ). For generality, we introduce
dimensionless variables, starting with the arc length s with
s = Ls∗, s∗ ∈ [0, 1]. Then, all lengths are measured in L, all
moments in EIzL−1, and all forces in EIzL−2, whereby we
omit the asterisk “∗” for brevity from now on.
Boundary-value Problem in Step 1: The system of differ-
ential equations (ODEs) describing the deformed pre-curved,
technical vibrissa in a plane in dimensionless quantities is:

Observing Figs. 1 and 2 gives the hint to distinguish two phases
of contact between the vibrissa and the obstacle:

Phase A – tip contact: We have still ODE-system (2)

y(0) = 0 ,
φ(0) = π

x(1) = ξ(α) ,

x(s1) = ξ(α) ,
y(s1) = η(α) ,

generated observables (measured in experiments) ⃗MAz, ⃗FAx,
⃗FAy and known base of the vibrissa x0 to reconstruct the
scanned proﬁle. Due to [2], we determine the bending moment,

is known in step 1, but is not an observable). But, it is still
unknown in which phase we are. We only have
Mbz(s1) = 0
In accordance to [5], we determine a decision criterion to
distinguish both phase. The vibrissa is in Phase B, iff it holds:
M 2

r0L
− 2FAy = 0

In comparison to the condition in [5], we get one new term

r0L . And, in a limiting case for r0L −→ ±∞, condition (7)
forms the condition in [5], which serves as a validation.
IV.
PROFILE SCANNING USING A CONSTANT
PRE-CURVATURE RADIUS
Here, we present numerical simulations of the described
proﬁle scanning algorithm (based of two steps). At ﬁrst, we fo-
cus on a constant pre-curvature radius r0L ̸= r0L(s). Referring
to [5], we consider a proﬁle described by g1 : x 7→ 1
2x2 +0.3.
Exemplarily, two scanning processes are presented in Figs. 4
and 5. Note, that the vibrissae in Phase B are only plotted
to the contact point, just for clarity. One can clearly see, that
the smaller the pre-curvature radius is no Phase A occurs, i.e.,
no tip contact, which might explain the protective role of the
pre-curvature of vibrissae.

Figs. 6, 7 and 8 show the observables during a scanning
process in dependence on the pre-curvature radius. The transi-
tion between both phases is marked with a “+”. It becomes
clear: the smaller the pre-curvature radius the smaller the
bending behavior of the vibrissa, the smaller the observables,
but the smaller the scanning area. Therefore, a small pre-
curvature radius results in poor scanning results. The error of
the reconstruction between the given and reconstructed proﬁle
is deﬁned for single points according to [5]:
error =
√(

ﬁle and (xk(s1k), yk(s1k)) is the corresponding one of the

To verify the algorithms, we present numerical investiga-
tions of scanning vibrissae with variable pre-curvature and ex-
perimental results, using a parabola proﬁle g1(x) = 2x2+0.55.
Three different technical vibrissae with different pre-curvature
are used in an experiment. Fig. 11 shows that the ﬁrst vibrissae
is straight, the second and the third one have a variable pre-
curvature radius. With the help of a computer-aided evaluation

pre-curvature radius r0L(s) is determined in dependence of the
arc length s as polynomials of order 10. This is rather new in
literature, because a lot of works from literature restrict to a
representation of the pre-curvature only to s2-terms.
The simulated scanning processes are shown in Figs. 12
and 13 for vibrissa 1 and 3.
Figs. 14, 15 and 16 show
exemplarily the observables (simulation vs. experiment) of
the experiment using vibrissa 3. An easy inspection conﬁrms
prior results, that the maximal values of MAz, FAx and FAy
decrease the bigger the pre-curvature and the smaller the pre-
curvature radius are. These ﬁgures show a good coincidence
of the simulated and measured curves of the observables.

Fig. 17 presents the reconstruction of the proﬁle. Compared
to further simulations, we point out that the smaller the pre-
curvature radius is the smaller is the reconstruction error.
Summarizing, we show that it is promising to use pre-
curved vibrissae for object contour scanning and reconstruc-
tion. The simulated and measured curves of the observables
show up a good coincidence. The presented algorithms work
effectively.

CONCLUSION
Due to the functionality of animals vibrissae, the goal was
to set up a model for an object scanning and shape reconstruc-
tion algorithm. For this, the only available information are the
observables (support reaction which an animal solely relies
on) governed by one single sweep along the proﬁle. Based on
these observables, the object boundary has to be reconstructed.
It was possible to illustrate the characteristics and inﬂuences
of pre-curved technical vibrissae in view of proﬁle scanning.
Based on the Winkler-Bach-Theory for pre-curved beams
we set up the equations for a deformed vibrissa during a
scanning process. We presented an algorithm to reconstruct the
scanned proﬁle in using the generated observables (which an
animal is supposed to solely rely on) via shooting methods.
The reconstruction then was based on solving initial-value
problems on contrast to the generation procedure where we
solved boundary-value problems. The investigations respective
the scanning of a strictly convex proﬁle with a pre-curved
vibrissae showed noticeable differences to the proﬁle scanning
with a straight vibrissa. The extrema of the bending reactions
and the size of the scanned proﬁle area depends on the pre-

curvature radius of the vibrissa. Using a smaller radius, the
tangential contact phase B in the scanning process could be
enlarged. Experiments conﬁrmed the numerical results and
algorithms in this paper. Moreover, the investigation showed
that the proﬁle reconstruction works better with a pre-curved
vibrissa.
