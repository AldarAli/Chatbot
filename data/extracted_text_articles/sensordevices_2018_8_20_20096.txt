Abstract—The dependence on temperature of the body-drain 
voltage appearing across a forward-biased body-diode is used 
to estimate the junction temperature of power Metal-Oxide-
Semiconductor 
Field-Effect 
Transistors. 
Moreover, 
the 
temperature sensor sensitivity, linearity, resolution, error and 
output repeatability are accurately discussed. The integrated 
diodes are characterized in a typical working temperature 
range, between about 22 °C and 150 °C and for currents 
between 1 µA and 1 mA. The best trade-off between sensitivity 
and linearity is found at a low bias current of 21 μA.

 INTRODUCTION 
The monitoring of the junction temperature (TJ) of power 
semiconductor devices is of paramount importance in many 
applications. In particular, the measurement of the junction 
temperature is essential to evaluate the performance of a 
circuit and of semiconductor devices as it has a strong 
influence on electrical parameters, reliability and operating 
lifetime of power devices [1][2].  
However, the direct measurement of junction temperature 
is very difficult, and still an open issue among designers, 
who have generally to rely on external sensors placed in 
contact with the observed device metal case. 
An alternative way for the monitoring of the junction 
temperature of a power MOSFET consists in using 
Temperature-Sensitive Electrical Parameters (TSEPs) of the 
same device [1][2]. Studies have demonstrated the 
possibility to monitor the MOSFET junction temperature 
through TSEPs, e.g., the on-state resistance, turn-on delay of 
pulse signal, turn-off delay time and gate drive current [3]-
[6]. 
In previous works, we have shown that Schottky and p-i-
n diodes can be used as linear temperature sensors thanks to 
the favorable temperature dependence of their forward bias 
voltage drop [7][8]. As commercial power MOSFETs 
include an intrinsic diode (body-diode), formed at the body-
drain P-N junction connected between drain and source, the 
body-drain voltage (VBD) can be considered itself a TSEP, 
varying almost linearly with temperature when this body-
diode is forward biased with a proper DC current.  
The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the possibility of 
monitoring the power MOSFET junction temperature 
through VBD-T relation. The almost linear dependence 
between the body-drain voltage and junction temperature 
has been studied in the MOSFET operative temperature 
range from room temperature up to 150 °C.  
The paper is organized as follows. The Section 2 consists 
of two parts; first, the linear dependence between voltage 
and temperature, the electrical circuit and the experimental 
setup used for measuring the junction temperature are 
described. The second part reports the experimental results 
with particular attention to temperature sensor performance, 
i.e., linearity, sensitivity and temperature error. Finally, 
conclusions and future works are presented in Section 3.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Use of Body-Diode as Temperature Sensor 
As well-known, the ID current flowing in a diode at a 
given applied voltage VBD can be analytically described 
using the following formula:

where η is the ideality factor, IS is the saturation current, RS 
is the series resistance, q is the electronic charge and k is the 
Boltzmann constant.  
The characterization of the sensor output has been 
performed under forward bias condition where, at constant 
DC current, the voltage across the diode is linearly 
dependent on the temperature. In fact, if q(VBD-RSID) >> 
ηkT, the voltage drop dependence on temperature can be

As demonstrated in [8], equation (2) makes explicit the 
linear dependence VD-T as long as the contribution of the 
series resistance can be considered negligible. Keeping the 
diode operating in its exponential region with a low bias 
current helps meeting this requirement. Moreover, the use of 
low bias currents allows to avoid both self-heating effects, 
which can negatively affect the sensor linearity, and 
excessive power consumption. 
   In our set-up, the integrated Body-Diode (BD) was 
biased at a forward constant current (ID), as schematically 
reported in Figure 1, while the gate was connected to 
ground. 
It is clear that the use of this technique in a working 
power circuit, e.g., a static converter, for the real time 
measure of the internal operating temperature of a switching 
MOSFET, the so called junction temperature Tj, would 
require the temporary switch-off of the device and the 
forcing of the probe ID current through the body diode. This 
scheme, however, should not have a serious impact on the 
circuit performance because of the very limited time interval 
necessary to proceed with the VDB measurement, of the 
order of a few milliseconds. 
 
B.  Temperature Sensor Performance  
The experimental measurements are carried out on a 
commercial SiC MOSFET (C2M0025120D) [9] having a 
maximum drain-source voltage of 1200 V, a maximum 
continuous drain current of 90 A and a drain-source on-state 
resistance of 25 mΩ. Moreover, the operating junction 
temperature range is claimed from -55 °C up to 150 °C. The 
device has been tested in a thermostatic oven (Galli 
G210F030P) setting the reference temperature through its 
internal Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) digital 
microcontroller. A thermocouple (K-type) temperature 
sensor was placed in contact with the Device Under Test 
(DUT) in order to monitor, during measurements, the exact 
temperature set points, gradually varied from (down to) ~22 
°C up to (from) 150 °C. By using an Agilent 4155C 
semiconductor parameter analyzer, tests were made for ID 
varied in a range from 1 μA to 1 mA ±(0.12%∙ID+500 nA+2 
nA∙VBD) accuracy, 100 nA resolution [10], and the 
corresponding voltage drops VBD across the body-diode were 
measured. The experimental setup used for temperature 
measurements is shown in Figure 2. 
While the DC bias current, ID, was varied in the given 
range, the corresponding voltage drop VBD across the body-
diode was measured as reported in Figure 3(a). At each 
Figure 3. (a) Current-voltage (ID-VBD) characteristics in the temperature

temperature, measurements started after waiting for the 
settling of stable temperatures for several minutes. 
Moreover, the experimental data are reported at five 
currents ID (1 µA, 10 µA, 21 µA, 100 µA and 1 mA). 
From ID–VBD–T measurements, the VBD–T characteristics 
have been extracted as shown in Figure 3(b), which also 
reports the linear fitting of data obtained through a proper 
computer routine. 
In our analysis, the coefficient of determination (R2) [11] 
has been calculated to evaluate the agreement between the 
experimental measurements and their linear best fit, fL(T). In 
particular, R2 allows to quantify the sensor linearity 
goodness by fitting the experimental data with a linear 
model. 
In Figure 3(b), the measured data are fitted with the best-
calculated linear model showing a good degree of linearity 
(R2 > 0.995) for the considered range of ID. The sensor 
sensitivity S can be obtained from the slope of the VBD–T 
characteristics. When ID is 1 μA the sensitivity is 2.49 
mV/°C and increases to 2.58 mV/°C for ID=1 mA. 
Figures 4(a) and (b) report a detailed analysis of the 
sensitivity and coefficient of determination for different 
value of biasing currents ID. The maximum of R2~0.9997 
has been calculated for ID=21 μA, corresponding to a 
sensitivity S=2.41 mV/°C. 
Another important parameter for the characterization of a 
linear temperature sensor is the root mean square error 
(rmse) between the calculated linear best-fit and the 
experimental measurements. The rmse was first calculated 
and subsequently converted into a temperature error by 
dividing by the sensitivity. 
The obtained plot, rmse versus ID, for the considered 
temperature range is reported in Figure 4(c). The root mean 
square error is always lower than 2.83 °C while a minimum 
rmse of 0.61 °C is obtained for ID=21 μA, which also 
provides the maximum linearity. 
As shown in the three graphs of Figure 4, the best bias 
current range for the sensor is from 8 to 100 μA. In fact, in 
this range the sensor shows a coefficient of determination 
higher than 0.9993 (see rectangle of Figure 4(b)). It is worth 
noting that in this current range the R2 varies by only 
0.016% from the average of Ra2=0.99953 over the 
considered temperature range, leading to an integrated 
temperature sensor with a highly linear behavior also for 
unwanted variation of the bias current during the short-time 
sensing phase. The corresponding average values of 
sensitivity and rmse are Sa=2.42 mV/°C and rmsea=0.83 °C 
with standard deviations of 0.01 mV/°C and 0.15 °C 
respectively. 
Another important parameter for the characterization of a 
temperature sensor is the temperature error. In this case, the 
maximum absolute error |Terr| of experimental data was 
extracted with respect to their linear best fit for different 
measurement cycles. The obtained values, for the best bias 
current of ID=21 μA, are reported in Figure 5. As shown in 
the graph, the maximum absolute error decreases as the 
temperature rises. Moreover, for temperatures above 100 
°C, which might be considered as a safety threshold to avoid 
MOSFET malfunctions, the maximum error is less than 2 
°C. This appears to be a small maximum error if the target is

and body-drain voltage (VBD) at bias current of ID=21 μA

root mean square error, rmse, within the whole temperature range of 22-
150 °C and for bias currents in the range ID=1 μA-1 mA.

device, at least compared to other techniques that involve 
the use of an external sensor, placed in contact with the 
device case.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
A highly-linear temperature sensor based on body-drain 
diode integrated within a power MOSFET has been 
characterized. 
The proposed type of sensor allows to monitor the 
junction temperature of power MOSFETs during their 
operation. Different cycles of measurements were iterated 
showing a good output repeatability. Measurements showed 
a maximum linearity coefficient R2~0.9997 for ID=21 μA, 
corresponding to a sensitivity S=2.41 mV/°C in the 
temperature range T = 22–150 °C. 
Future work will mainly cover the design and realization 
of a circuit for monitoring the MOSFETs junction 
temperature in power converter systems. Moreover, the 
analysis reported in this work will be extended to 
MOSFETs of various suppliers.
