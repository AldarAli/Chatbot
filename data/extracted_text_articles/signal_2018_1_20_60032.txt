Units. Parallelization provides computational speeds sufﬁcient for
signal processing and pulsar detection in the observations in real-
time.

INTRODUCTION
Big Scanning Antenna (BSA) is a unique instrument used
at Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory of Lebedev Phys-
ical Institute. This radio telescope has the structure of a phased
array of size 187 m x 384 m (10 football ﬁelds, see Figure 1).
It has no moving parts, consists of 16,384 half-wave dipoles
located in a grid of 64 dipoles in 256 lines. The telescope
performs simultaneous measurements along the meridian plane
and uses the rotation of the Earth to scan the celestial sphere.
The telescope has a working frequency band of 109-113 MHz.
It is one of the most sensitive telescopes in the world in
this frequency range. The telescope is used in a number of
projects: in studying pulsars, dynamic processes in near solar
and interplanetary plasma, analyzing the structure of compact
radio sources, studying active galactic nuclei [1]–[3].
The signal of the radio telescope consists of 1536 chan-
nels, representing simultaneous measurements in 48 spatial
directions (beams) and 32 frequency bands. Each measurement
represents a stream of 32-bit numbers taken at a frequency of
about 80 Hz, so the total density of the data stream from the
telescope is about 4 Mbps.
A typical one-hour observation is shown in Figure 2. The
image is similar to a snapshot of a night sky from an ordinary
optical telescope, the difference is that here the signal is
recorded in the radio range and only the sources of periodic
signals are reconstructed. The typical signal level is so small
that it is usually not visible directly in the observation data and
is extracted from noise only by special processing algorithms.
The telescope simultaneously detects the signal in 32
frequency bands, in which the signal manifests a phase shift.
The reason for this shift is the dispersion in the interstellar
medium, i.e., the propagation velocity of radio waves deviates
from the speed of light in a vacuum and begins to depend on
the frequency. As a result, the signals in different frequency
bands arrive at different time. The shift is proportional to the
total propagation time of the signal, i.e., the distance to the
source. Thus, the phase shift of the signal in frequency bands
allows to measure the distance to the source.
Similar effects appear in Search for Extraterrestrial Intel-
ligence (SETI), [4]–[6]. When looking for narrow band radio
signals from deep space, one needs to account for Doppler
drift due to the relative motion of the telescope and the
signal source. Doppler drift is time dependent, since the Earth
is rotating together with the telescope ﬁxed on its surface.
Also, the source of the signal is presumably located on the
surface of a planet or orbits around a planet. The both effects,
frequency dependent time shift in the search of pulsars and
time dependent frequency shift for SETI, lead to the signal
smearing over the exposition time, like shaking the camera
smears the snapshot. To increase the sensitivity of detection,
the both type of effects should be compensated on processing
stage.
In [7] [8], we described a method of statistical accumula-
tion, specially developed for the search for pulsar signals. The
method consists in computing the integral of the form
corr(T, a, b) =
Z
dfdt s(t, f) ∆((t − (a + bf))/T),
(1)
where s(t, f) is the signal depending on time and frequency,
∆() is the periodic delta function, T is the period, a+bf is the
phase shift, linearly depending on frequency. The integral over
the frequency-time plane deﬁnes the functional scalar product
of the measured signal with the expected waveform, i.e.,
periodically repeating pulses with the phase shift proportional
to frequency variation. When the signal is normalized to unity,
the integral represents a correlator of the signal with the
expected shape. The method consists in ﬁnding the signal
parameters (T, a, b) maximizing this correlator.
The reconstructed signal parameters: the period T, the
common phase a and the frequency shift b represent individual
characteristics of the pulsar. The period is determined by the
rotation speed of the pulsar, the phase describes the proﬁle of
the pulse, the shift can be used to determine the distance to
the source.
This paper is devoted to the acceleration of the processing
of signals of this kind. The processing is computationally ex-
pensive and requires massive parallelization. For acceleration
we use multiple Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs) and compare their performance in
application to the search of pulsars.

Recently, multiprocessor architectures and GPUs have been
used to accelerate the processing of astrophysical signals,
also, for the search of pulsars. In particular, [9] [10] describe
the implementation of Fourier Domain Acceleration Search
Method, using GPU acceleration for the search of pulsars with
Square Kilometre Array telescope. In [11] GPU acceleration
is applied for pulsar signal processing on Goldstone Apple
Valley radio telescope. In the present paper, we concentrate
on the usage of multiple CPUs and GPUs for acceleration of
signal processing from BSA radio telescope.
In Section II, we describe general computational aspects of
signal processing algorithms used for the search of pulsars. In
Section III, we present the acceleration of computation using
multiprocessor systems. The obtained results are summarized
in Section IV.
II.
SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS
Calculating in (1) the integral over the time dt, it can be
converted to the sum of the signal over the periods T, i.e., the
signal folding over the trial period in each frequency band.
The integral over the frequency df then corresponds to the
matching of the signals in different frequency bands, taking
into account the shift between the bands. The principle of the
reconstruction methods is shown in Figure 3, the prototype
algorithms are shown in Figure 4.
The processing is a multiple summation of data segments
in different combinations, requiring extremely intensive com-
putations. The estimates of [7], [8] show the computational
complexity of the order O(NfNbN 2
p log(T1/T0)), where Nf
is the number of frequency bands, Nb is the number of
observation beams, Np is the number of data points taken in
the analysis, T0,1 is the search limits for the period. Previously,
to process one-hour observation in less than one hour, the
coarser, shortened data consisting of 6 frequency bands with a
time resolution of 0.1 sec have been considered. In this paper,
we investigate the possibility of processing complete data in
real time, which requires additional acceleration of processing
methods. For this purpose, we use a massive parallelization of
computations.
III.
ACCELERATION OF SIGNAL PROCESSING
At ﬁrst, the full one-hour data occupying 1.8 GB are cut
into segments, containing observations in every beam in a
given time window tw, which we consider as a parameter in
our study. In order not to loose the signals spreaded across
the cut borders, we use an additional collocated segmentation,
shifted by tw/2. This doubles the total processing time, but
guarantees the reconstruction of all signals. The optimal value
for tw is related with the size of the beam and constitutes
3-5min. Reducing the window size is possible, but leads to
sensitivity loss, i.e., reducing tw by factor k reduces the
sensitivity by factor k1/2. An important aspect is a capability of
the algorithms to perform in real-time, i.e., to have processing
time not more than the time of data capture.
After the data splitting, each segment is processed in par-
allel, using the maximum number of available processors. We
have experimented with Intel 3GHz CPUs vs 0.812TFLOPS
Nvidia Quadro K620 GPU. The processing time tp as a
function of window size tw is shown on Figure 3 right. Real
time zone corresponds to tp ≤ tw and is displayed on this
ﬁgure in gray. One CPU cannot reach the real time zone for
all values of tw. When using 16 CPUs, the required real-time
reconstruction speed is achieved for all tw. For the variant
with collocated segmentation, 32 CPUs should be used.
At large tw, processing on GPU brings only insigniﬁcant
advantage over 1CPU variant and is also located outside the
real time zone. At about tw = 2.5 min, the data in processing
window start to match shared memory of the device, bringing
performance boost by a factor 15. Then, GPU outperforms
16CPU variant and is located completely in real time zone.

at Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory has been pre-
sented. For this purpose the parallelization of computations
on multiprocessor systems has been implemented. Typically,
16 CPU systems are sufﬁcient for real-time processing of raw
data from the radio telescope. The best results are achieved
with GPU processing, which ensures the maximum degree
of parallelization of computations. Here, below the threshold
tw < 2.5 min, the data in processing window match shared
memory of the device, providing a signiﬁcant 15x performance
boost. This allows to reach the computational speed, sufﬁcient
with a margin to process the signal from the radio telescope
and to reconstruct pulsars from the observations in real-time.
Our further plans include the development of efﬁcient al-
gorithms, separating near Earth Radio Frequency Interference
(RFI) from deep space signals. Interference from terrestrial and
near-Earth radio sources poses a serious problem for detection
of weak radio signals. In practice, the telescope receives high
gain signal from the main beam and low gain signals from all
possible directions. Low gain signals are not correlated with
the position of the main beam and penetrate the telescope
through the side lobes. On the other hand, the near-Earth
RFI has a signiﬁcantly higher intensity than the deep space
signals. Therefore, at the output of the telescope, near-Earth
RFI can overexpose the intensity of the sought-for signals.
The main idea for ﬁltering algorithms is to use correlation
between different beams to select those signals highly localized
on celestial sphere, i.e., deep space signals.
