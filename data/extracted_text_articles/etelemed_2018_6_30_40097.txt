Abstract— Genetic information provides important diagnostic
data
from
patients
to
their
health
care
providers
and
researchers that match phenotype and genotype. However,
both diagnostic and research data providers must be confident
that using this data for either purpose protects the data
provider from foreseeable privacy breaches. In order to do so,
Federal and State laws are in place to specifically address
genetic information in addition to the laws established to
protect generic health information. State genetic privacy laws
diverge widely in their level of detail and constraints on
releasing data, criteria for evaluating access to such data, data
owner consents required to release data, and conditions for
using released data. A rule-base specifying these variations can
be used as a policy language to enforce data releases from
electronic health records and gene pools. In order to satisfy
this need, we describe a comprehensive ontology for genetic
privacy based on existing applicable laws. Our ontology is used
in ontological rule bases within medical workflows that are
directly integrated with electronic health records. As shown in
our ongoing work, this integration provides a solid foundation
for enforcing laws and regulations in preventing unlawful
disclosures of genetic information.
Keywords- Genetic Privacy; Electronic Medical Records;
Ontology; Health Care; Genomic Medicine.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Patients are less likely to share data if there is a concern
about privacy, so consents are necessary to help allay these
concerns [1]. Privacy concerns have been heightened as
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become widespread
and ensuring privacy has increased in importance [2][3]. The
privacy concerns that patients have about electronic medical
records also
apply to
genetic information. There are
demonstrable benefits to using genetic information as genetic
studies map genotypic and phenotypic data directly to
diseases, allowing for preventive and early interventional
care to reduce morbidity and treatment costs [4][5]. These
benefits have to be balanced against inherent unusual
characteristics of genetic information that can identify a
patient and his/her genetic relatives, therefore placing any of
them
at
risk
of
negative
consequences,
such
as
discrimination [6]. Consequently, laws impose penalties if
genetic data is inappropriately released. Studies have also
shown that de-identification of genetic material may be
insufficient to protect patient privacy [7][8].
In the United States, overall health privacy was addressed
by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) of 1996, which was implemented to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the US healthcare system.
HIPAA was followed by the Privacy Rule in 2000 to address
three
covered
entities:
health
plans,
health
care
clearinghouses, and certain health care providers [9]. HIPAA
was
also
followed
by
the
Genetic
Information
Nondiscrimination
Act
of
2008
(GINA)
to
protect
individuals
from
discrimination
in
employment
and
insurance based on genetic information [10]. Furthermore,
almost every state and the District of Columbia have laws
that specifically address genetic protections to some degree.
Health Information Exchanges and direct sharing between
health care providers are still subject to the applicable State
laws even for interstate data transfers [11]. This paper
develops an ontology that provides the syntactical elements
(i.e., entities and their relationships) sufficient to specify
applicable legislation and regulations in the forms of a
structured formal rule-base.
In our previous work, we developed a prototype that uses
a medical workflow system for an EHR to enforce Federal
and State laws in addition to organizational policies.
Workflows provided the mechanism to gather the necessary
information within the context of an EHR. We prepared an
initial genetic privacy ontology and sample rules to enforce
laws in selected states to validate our approach.
Our next step is developing this comprehensive genetic
privacy ontology based directly on relevant Federal and State
laws. Following this Introduction, Section 2 addresses
related work; Section 3 provides the methodology we
followed in developing this ontology; Section 4 describes the
genetic privacy ontology with detailed descriptions for each
super-class; Section 5 provides an example of the ontology
being used in our prototype; and, finally, Section 6 presents
conclusions.

RELATED WORKS
There are existing standards and frameworks with
methods to implement various aspects of genetic privacy
protections. The Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE)

standards profiling organization has developed frameworks,
use cases, and specifications for managing the sharing of
documents
between
organizations
[12].
The
inter-
organizational policies must be completed prior to the use of
this standard for implementing the consent agreements.
There is some capability to address components of genetic
privacy related to acknowledging consents but not all the
required capability. For example, the use case of individuals
specifying that other specific individuals do, or do not, have
access to their data is listed as a scenario that is explicitly not
supported [13]. Many State laws call for this type of consent
specifications as a prerequisite for permissible access to data.
The restrictions placed by regulatory environments on
information sharing has been identified as an issue that
requires coordination across system silos [14]. The Global
Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) provides a
framework for sharing genome data with privacy and
security policies, technology recommendations, guidance
and architecture to allow interactions between organizations
[15][16]. The basis of data sharing in GA4GH is that the
donors or their representatives have provided consent in
accordance with organizational policies and the applicable
laws [17]. The work to date provides comprehensive policies
but does not have a functional mechanism for implementing
sharing data or addressing the restrictions placed by donors
in systems that hold and use such data.
Other health-care privacy ontologies have some overlap
with genetic privacy concepts based on laws. However, these
ontologies have gaps in numerous areas when compared to
State law implementation requirements. The HL7 Security
and Privacy Ontology has a class PurposeOfUseOntology
with a purpose code and description [18, p. 1]. Because the
focus is on health care organizations, the main categories in
this ontology are for health care marketing, operations,
payment, research, public health and treatment with options
for patient requested inquiries including family, power of
attorney and support network. This list does not include key
purposes regulated by law, such as Law Enforcement,
Homeland Security and Insurance access.
Other matching
HL7 ontologies have some overlap (such as Organization,
ObligationPolicy, Refrain, and Role) but not a complete set
of genetic information related categories.
The Sensitivity
class contains a genetic disease information sensitivity but
this needs to be set based on the state law attributes of the
ontology. Many of the state laws have conditions that must
be met prior to releasing genetic information in addition to
imposing specific obligations to be adhered to after the
release. A future research option is to develop a mapping
and extension between our genetic focused ontology and the
HL7 framework as a basis for an implementation.
Genetic privacy protections issues are expanding with the
introduction of big data repositories and Direct-to-Consumer
(DTC) DNA testing. Adoption of the latter has skyrocketed
with its lower prices and wide-spread advertising. DTC DNA
testing-related sites encourage sharing of genetic data,
including through the use of social media. But consumers
often do not have an understanding of the consequences of
these services [19]. In general, even when presented with
consent
agreements,
consumers,
patients
and
research
participants have a wide variety of reasons for permitting
access to their data, do not always fully understand the extent
and implications of these agreements, and underestimate the
ability for de-identification [20][21] .
Work by Rahmouni et al. developed an ontology of
European privacy requirements for sharing patient data
between countries [22][23]. It focused on the implementation
of data access between countries with respect to privacy
status, consent requirements, recipients, level of detail,
purpose,
secondary
purpose,
and
access
by
legal
representatives. There are no structures for the supplemental
requirements prevalent in US laws outside various options
for consent agreements and anonymization.
Other healthcare security focused ontologies lack the
focus on purpose-driven access found in US laws. Blobel’s
pHealth has a policy structure that can implement many of
the legal requirements and implements patient consent using
policies [24]. The patient and internal organizational focus
on access policies limits the opportunities to address the
wide variety of scenarios prevalent with external access to
patient data.
Most privacy models also use Role-Based Access
Control
(RBAC)
to
data
inquiries
and
implementing
enforcement policies. The use of RBAC has been identified
as one of the candidates for implementing privacy access
controls in the EHR domain [25], where rights can be
assigned based on organizational policies in a hierarchical
manner that is modified based on the user’s role and then
adjusted by the patient as desired.
Healthcare privacy
extensions, such as those proposed by Hung, provide the
structure for adding concepts for areas including purpose,
obligations, and retention [26]. The nature of genetic access
restrictions and criteria requires a specific framework to
accommodate the variations in State laws.
III.
METHODOLOGY
A.
Process
The goal of developing our genetic privacy ontology is to
identify diverse factors relevant to enforcing these laws in
the United States.
The applicable Federal law specific to
genetic privacy is the GINA [27]. For State laws, the
National Human Genome Research Institute maintains a
Genome
Statute
and
Legislation
Database
[28].
This
database classifies the laws into the following categories:
•
Employment Nondiscrimination
•
Health Insurance Coverage
•
Health Insurance Nondiscrimination
•
Other Lines of Insurance Nondiscrimination
•
Other Topics
•
Privacy
•
Research
•
Use of Residual Newborn Screening Specimens
A search against all categories generated a list of over
400 individual state statues that were reviewed for their
applicability. The focus was for statues with criteria that
would impact a request to an EHR or similar repository.
References to other statues within those on the search list

were followed when there was a potential for additional
relevant use cases.
The next step in the process involved reviewing every
relevant law for the specific terms and phrases associated
with privacy protection. Statements and phrases related to
the following super-classes (with two examples listed below
for each item) were extracted:
•
Purpose: What use case is being addressed? (law
enforcement, treatment)
•
Subject: Whose information is being protected?
(individual, minor child, family member)
•
Requester
Role:
what
role
is
specified
for
individual
making
the
request?
(physician,
genetic
counselor)
•
Requester
Organization:
What
kind
of
organization
does
the
requester
represent?
(insurance
company, court)
•
Target of Request: What kind of information or
activity is protected? (genetic information, test results)
•
Pre-conditions: What must be done before the
information can be released? (obtain consent, approved by an
institutional review board)
•
Post-conditions: What must be done, or not done,
once the information is provided? (non-discrimination,
destroy after use)
•
Penalties: How will any violations potentially be
punished? (misdemeanor, fine)
Then, all super-classes were structured into relevant
classes. For example, the Subject super-class was divided
into the Individual, Immediate Family, Beneficiary, and
Relative classes. The Relative class has additional subclasses
for Blood Relative, Family Member, and Identical Brother.
In order to ensure the appropriate coverage, similar terms
were recorded in the detailed model (which is not presented
here
due
to
space
constraints.)
An
example
is
that
“Treatment” is used as the class name and is in the model,
while “patient care” provides the same base meaning.
Properties are added to the ontology solely based on the
associated State law.
B.
Exclusions
The expansive state database generated a comprehensive
set of criteria for genetic privacy protection. Use cases not
relevant to protecting genetic information in medical records
were excluded from data elements analysis. For example,
while there are State laws related to maintaining State DNA
Databases for the criminal justice system, these laws were
not evaluated after the first screening review.
In addition,
the search was not expanded to address Federal and State
regulations as the basis of this guidance is derived from the
associated laws. Finally, laws that provide generic protection
to any component of protected health information and would
be enforced across all information requests were not
included. For example, while most State laws on genetic
privacy are relatively recent and still being legislated,
HIPAA restrictions have been in place since 1996 and are
well
established
within
the
medical
and
insurance
community [29].
IV.
GENETIC PRIVACY ONTOLOGY
The Genetic Privacy Ontology as shown in Figure 1 is
organized into four high-level components to reflect aspects
of accessing medical records.

Requester
is
information
on
the
individual
submitting the access request with their associated
role and organization. The role and organization are
linked with the purpose for a specific request. For
example, a law may permit physician access to
records for patient treatment at a hospital with a
different set of conditions if the physician is
participating in research at that facility.

Request indicates characteristics of the person
whose medical record is being accessed (subject),
how the information will be used (purpose), what
will be done with the information once received
(action), and what information or activity is being
requested (target).

Validation
provides
conditions
that
must
be
addressed
prior
to
information
release
(pre-
conditions) and if a consent agreement is required
with specific clauses to be included (consent).

Constraint addresses limits placed on the use of the
data (restrictions) and activities to be performed after
the request is fulfilled (obligations).
This
paper
addresses
the
Requester
and
Request
components as the most important aspects of enforcing the
law. The laws vary widely in terms of which classes are
specifically included and the amount of detail provided. As
an example of a law with broad scope, the genetic
information access law in Arkansas states “Except as
provided in (b) of this section … (1) a person may not collect
a DNA sample from a person … unless the person has first
obtained the informed and written consent of the person…”
followed by five specific purposes in section (b) where
access is permitted.
A.
Purpose
The Purpose super-class shown in Figure 2 provides the
linchpin of genetic privacy protections. Every access to
medical records must have a purpose (or reason for the
access request). It is a violation of core security principles
related to confidentiality to allow data access without a valid
reason.

Figure 2. Purpose Super-Class.
Figure 4. Subject Super-Class.
Figure 3. Action Super-Class.
The classes are:

Medical with a focus on genetic-related activities
plus access to genetic information for related efforts

Employer/Workplace
Programs
includes labor
organizations, apprenticeships, and licensing

Legal/Law Enforcement for criminal, civil, court
activities, compliance and related legal proceedings

Research
for
health
specific
research,
general
scientific studies, educational programs, and access
to deceased genetic information in an emergency
situation

Insurance for health plan underwriting, determining
payments and other business transactions. There are
two related subclasses for underwriting to determine
the type of insurance being processed and the plan.

Financial contains various financial transactions
including
whether
a
person
is
entitled
to
compensation for the use of their genetic material.

Authorized Person allows access to records by
people and organizations authorized in a consent
agreement along with the individual themselves.
Many other classes have a direct relationship with a
Purpose. For example, the Law Enforcement Purpose would
only be applicable to Law Enforcement roles and other roles
would be invalid. This linkage also applies to aspects of
Organization and Target.
B.
Action
During the full review of State laws, the need for an
Action class as shown in Figure 3 became obvious to
indicate how the interactions with the medical record will
occur. The list follows the information lifecycle of a medical
record from acquisition through use and destruction. These
terms are extracted directly from the laws and each class
contain lists of similar terms. For example, Require also
addresses the terms Inspect, Compel, and Order.
Request and Require are separated to reflect the ability to
deny a request for information as opposed to an inquiry that
indicates a demand based on a compelling reason. For
example, there
are
restrictions
as
to
when
insurance
companies may request information and that the information
may not be required as a condition of underwriting. In some
cases, both terms are used as seen in the District of
Columbia’s law stating that “A health benefit plan or health
insurer shall not request or require an individual or the
individual’s family member to undergo a genetic test.”
C.
Subject
The Subject super-class in Figure 4 is larger than the
immediate person in an access request. This broad definition
is needed in order to accommodate laws with statements like
the definition from a Delaware law, “’Genetic information’
means information about inherited genes or chromosomes,
and of alterations thereof, whether obtained from an
individual
or
family
member…”.
The
Individual
has
subclasses with specific terms that map to purpose. For
example, the Legal subclass has a law enforcement attribute
in the full model for “individual has been convicted of a
felony” to address a State law in New Mexico.
The age data field is not only a numeric value but a
conditional codifying the decision-making capacity and age
ranges. Some of the options beyond years of age include
“child born in the state” and un-emancipated minor. A child
can be minor child or also a reference to an adult child in the
Family Member subclass. Fetus and embryos are called out
specifically in some laws so they are articulated as a Subject
subclass. Dependents are presented as a separate subclass, as
these individuals are not necessarily a family member. The
same criteria holds for Beneficiary as the person may not be
directly related to the individual. This subclass is included as

Figure 5. Role Super-Class.
Figure 6. Organization Super-Class.
Figure 7. Target Super-Class.
Kentucky has a law that references the individual or their
beneficiaries accessing genetic services.
D.
Role
The majority of Roles in Figure 5 map to specific
purposes and their use would be restricted to the associated
purpose. There are general references to
“Individual”
accessing records so a broad subclass is needed for
undefined people. Kentucky state law includes a reference to
the person who orders a test on an infant or by the person
registering the birth. The law is not clear that the request
would be done by a health care provider so the category is
separated.
Within an organization, the role becomes important for
deciding on access. For example, a receptionist at a hospital
does not have access to genetic information even though they
work at a health care provider. Some terms are relevant to
both individuals and organizations. For example, the term
health care provider often means either entity.
E.
Organization
Some terms that are typically associated
with an
individual may also be applicable to an Organization super-
class which is provided in Figure 6. For example, the term
Person can be a corporation in some states, such as defined
in New Hampshire: “Person includes a human being, an
association or organization, a trust, corporation, and
partnership.” The phrase “Health Care Provider” is also an
organization in addition to a specific person/role. The use of
subclasses with the same name as the Purpose super-class
indicates a match where there are restrictions associated with
the organization (and hence role). Therefore, a Research
Organization would be limited to using Research Roles and
Purposes for a valid combination.
F.
Target
The Target super-class in Figure 7 addresses the specific
item being addressed in the law and encompasses more than
genetic information.

Physical Specimens are included as genetic material is
derived from these sources and thus have specific access
restrictions.

Record includes all the information, data and audit
records
within
an
individual’s
medical
records.
Numerous states have restrictions not only on the results
of genetic tests and activities, but also on whether a
request was made and/or denied by an individual or
family member. If a record has been de-identified,
different handling is indicated in some states.

Organization is included as some laws incorporate who
is the custodian or holder of the records being accessed.

Health Status Information (also called “health status
related factors” and other phrases) is generally defined
as including Health status, Medical condition (including
both physical and mental illness), Claims experience,
Receipt
of
health
care,
Medical
history,
Genetic
information,
Evidence
of
insurability
including
conditions
arising
out
of
domestic
violence,
and
Disability. However, in some states genetic information
is explicitly excluded as health status information.

Genetic Information includes all the related subclasses.
The state of Washington recently included genetic
information as a biometric identifier so a state list is
included.

Family Member and their Genetic Information is often
included in the scope of the individual’s genetic
information.

Research addresses genetic information obtained in this
purpose along with any genetic services obtained in
association
with
the
research.
(This
linkage
is
specifically called out.)

Genetic Services is for those areas targeting genetic-

to identify genetic characteristics. The test results
associated with these tests are also covered under the
umbrella of protected genetic information.

performed for reasons other than genetic services but the
resulting information is genetic-related.

by genetic services.
V.
IMPLEMENTATION
Our
previous
prototype
implemented
a
three-layer
architecture for enforcing genetic information release criteria
as seen in Figure 8. At the top layer, a workflow developed
in
Yet
Another
Workflow
Language
(YAWL)
[30]
orchestrates the information gathering on the Requester and
Request, invokes the Consent Service layer, displays the
access request decision (permit or deny) and gathers
electronic
signatures
to
enforce
the
Validations
and
Constraints. The Consent Service Layer uses Java code to
obtain the information from the workflow, populate the
ontology instances in Protégé, invoke the DL Reasoner, use
the Rules Hierarchy Algorithm to combine the Federal, State
and Local decisions into an overall final result, and populate
the workflow variables with the results for display and action
by the end user.
The ontology itself in implemented in
Protégé and the laws are encoded using Semantic Web Rule
Language (SWRL) [31].
Our
previous
papers
[32][33]
provide
extensive
information on the prototype operation and detailed use
cases. In this Section we provide targeted examples based on
the purpose-focused ontology.
A.
Related Organization
In New Mexico, genetic information access is allowed
without patient consent “(1) to identify an individual in the
course of a criminal investigation by a law enforcement
agency”. The corresponding SWRL rule for this law is:
Rule: makesRequest(?r, ?req), inState(?req, "NM"),
forResource(?req, ?resource), isGeneticResult(?resource,
true), includesIdentity(?resource, true), forPurpose(?req,
?pur), isInvestigation(?pur, true), hasOrganizaton(?r,
?org), isLawEnforcement (?org, true), hasResponse(?req,
?resst), responseLevel(?resst, "State")
isAllowed(?resst, true), canOverride(?resst, false),
decisionSource(?resst, "NM LAW 24-21-3.C"),,
hasRule(?resst, 3105)
In this rule,

?r is for the Requester of the Request

?req is for the Request that links the various
components, such as Subject, Purpose and Resource

?pur is the Purpose for the Request

?resource is for the “GeneticTestResults” part of the
medical record

?org is the Organization f the Requester

?resst is the State Response object that is associated
with the Request.
These SWRL statements are explained in Table I.

Boolean attributes are used in the ontology to simplify
the
evaluation
of
specific
conditions.
For
example,
isLawEnforcement allows any organization that meets the
criteria
to
be
provided
access
in
relation
to
the
isInvestigation attribute for Law Enforcement purposes. In
numerous laws related to law enforcement, the statement
specifically calls out using the genetic information for
identifying a person. Therefore, an includesIdentity attribute
is associated with the genetic information resources to
exclude any that are medically focused. The Boolean
attributes
enhance
the
flexibility
of
the
ontology
implementation.
B.
Broad Statements
Some states have broad statements that all uses for
genetic information are denied (or permitted) except as
outlined in a specific list. This scenario is addressed by
assigning state-specific attributes to the Purpose class. Then
the allowed Purpose instances are set to true and all other
instances are set to false.
For example, in Alaska, consent is required to collect
DNA sample, perform DNA analysis, retain DNA sample or
results, or disclose results except for the following cases:

Public Safety DNA database

Law Enforcement purpose

Determining Paternity

Screen Newborns

Emergency Medical Treatment
An
attribute
is
added
to
Purpose
for
isAKConsentRequired which can be set to true for these
specific instances. (The official state abbreviation for Alaska
is AK.) Within the Medical class, most instances under the
Therapeutic subclass would have attribute set to true with
only Emergency Medical Treatment set to false. A sample
SWRL rule that would be invoked for Emergency Medical
Treatment is as follows:
makesRequest(?r, ?req), inState(?req, "AK"),
forResource(?req, ?resource), isGeneticResult(?resource,
true), forPurpose(?req, ?pur), isAKConsentRequired(?pur,
false), hasResponse(?req, ?resst), responseLevel(?resst,
"State") -> isAllowed(?resst, true), canOverride(?resst,
false), decisionSource(?resst, "AK LAW 18.13.010"),
hasRule(?resst, 23)
In this rule,

?r is for the Requester of the Request

?req is for the Request that links the various
components, such as Subject, Purpose and Resource

?pur is the Purpose that is associated with the
Request

?resource is for the “GeneticTestResults” part of the
medical record

?resst is the State Response object that is associated
with the Request.
These SWRL statements are explained in Table II.

to 23 for reference
The corollary rule that would be invoked for any other
Medical purpose is as follows:
makesRequest(?r, ?req), inState(?req, "AK"),
forResource(?req, ?resource), isGeneticResult(?resource,
true), forPurpose(?req, ?pur), isAKConsentRequired(?pur,
true), hasResponse(?req, ?resst), responseLevel(?resst,
"State"), oblName(?pre, "ConsentRequired"),
clauseName(?clause, "AKGeneticConsent") ->
isAllowed(?resst, true), canOverride(?resst, true),
decisionSource(?resst, "AK LAW 18.13.010"),
hasPreCondition(?resst, ?pre), hasClause(?resst, ?clause),
hasRule(?resst, 21)
The additional arguments from the previous example are:

?pre is for a specific the Pre-Condition

?clause is for the text in the designated consent
clause

The SWRL statements that are different than the previous
rule are explained in Table III.
A side effect of these rules is that Alaska state law does
not define any situation where access is denied as long as
consent is obtained.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Our genetic privacy ontology was built directly from the
applicable Federal and State laws without any pre-conceived
boundaries or required elements. The work demonstrates the
importance of a purpose-focused structure to appropriately
link the various data elements necessary to permit or deny
access to the genetic medical information. The ontology and
previous prototype work allows the data collection to be
directly integrated into EHRs. The next step will be
validating an integrated EHR, ontology and prototype using
operational data and genetic data requests to demonstrate the
appropriate
data
protections
are
enforced.
This
comprehensive integration reduces the provider’s effort and
provides access decisions in accordance with relevant laws,
policies and regulations.
