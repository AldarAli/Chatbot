Abstract—Decision-making is expected to be encountered in many
aspects of people’s lives and is involved in ﬁelds such as economy,
business, health care, and education. There are also different
methods of making a decision, as well as various factors that
affect making such decisions. Decision-making, therefore, depends
on the context. It can be individual or group level. Group
decisions are more challenging than individual decisions because
of the existence of conﬂicting objectives among the participants
or stakeholders. Group decisions may require negotiation, which
involve the stakeholders’ inﬂuences on each other. Such inﬂuences
could be acquired from the trust among them. Therefore, trust
is used as a criterion for making group decisions. Usually, the
decisions come with consequences even if it is short term or long
term; therefore, it is important to put those consequences into
consideration before making any selections. Such consequences
can be addressed by perceived risk. The main contribution of this
paper is that it applies trust and risk as decision criteria in the
ﬁeld of multi-stakeholder decision-making. Additionally, we study
multi-stakeholder decision-making processes and models based on
our analysis of existing works. We found the consensus process
and GDM1 model are mostly applied in the existing schemes.
Keywords–Trust; Risk; Decision-Making; Multi-stakeholder.

INTRODUCTION
In real life, people encounter different situations, ranging
from critical to noncritical, that entail making a selection
among several options. Therefore, there have to be some
techniques or methods that help people with the selection
process. Trust and risk are criteria used for decision-making
because of the uncertainty of consequences involved in these
situations. Jøsang and et al. [1] stated that ”Risk and trust are
two tools for making decisions in an uncertain environment.”
In multi-stakeholder decision-making, a group of people
proposes an action or solution. From a psychological per-
spective, each individual in the group builds an impression
toward others based on his or her selection or experience.
As a result, we can imagine a network of participants who
represent nodes and the links between them are the feelings
they build for each other. This impression can be translated to
trust. In this situation, each person proposes a solution that is
feasible to him- or herself regardless of the effect it may have
on others. Therefore, the multi-stakeholder decision-making
model should help reach a solution that beneﬁts everyone and
prevents damage to the network of participants.
Numerous works on decision-making use different factors
depending on the ﬁeld and even the applications within the
ﬁelds. Those factors can be used to model trust. Therefore,
trust inﬂuences decision-making [2]. Moreover, every decision
comes with consequences and, as a result, makes risk another
important criterion in decision-making. The use and applica-
tion of trust and risk as the two criteria in decision-making are
beneﬁcial.
Trust can be a result of the decision maker’s expertise or
experiences, as well as the interaction between the decision
maker and other entities (e.g., humans and machines) [3].
Risk can be the result of estimating the potential damage or
loss that may occur following the outcome of the decision
[2]. Furthermore, when two entities interact with each other,
such interactions, which can inﬂuence decision-making, can be
risky [4]. It is necessary to survey multi-stakeholder decision-
making schemes to determine how to use trust value and risk
value when making decisions. Various trust systems have been
proposed, such as [5]–[15], including our framework [16]–
[26].
The main contributions in this paper are:
•
Study the relationship between trust and risk.
•
Study multi stakeholder decision-making process and
models.
•
Survey multi stakeholder decision-making schemes
based on trust and risk.
•
Analyze the challenges of existing multi stakeholder
decision-making schemes.
There
are
several
challenges
associated
with
multi-
stakeholder decision-making. For example, the participants
may come from various backgrounds and have different ex-
pertise. Also, the participants may have partial views about
the problem domain, as well as have conﬂicting objectives.
Regarding the use of trust and risk in a decision, several
challenges, such as risk quantiﬁcation and, more speciﬁcally,
rare events or those that have never occurred, arise as well.
Another challenge can emerge from knowing how to apply
trust and risk as decision criteria.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst survey of
multi-stakeholder decision-making using trust and risk. The
outcomes of this survey include classifying the processes of
multi-stakeholder decision-making and knowing the trust and
risk models that were used for making decisions.
This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we inves-
tigate different deﬁnitions of trust and risk, then we introduce
the possible relationships between them by analyzing existing
related works. Next, in Section III, we discuss trust and risk
in multi-stakeholder decision-making by presenting existing
multi-stakeholder decision-making schemes. In Section IV, we
conclude the paper.

TRUST AND RISK
In this section, we discuss trust and risk concepts by listing
some deﬁnitions and the relationship between them.
A. Trust
There is no exact universal deﬁnition for it according to
Daniel et al. [27]. Grandison and Sloman [28] indicated that
many researchers use the deﬁnition of trust in a very speciﬁc
form relating to topics, such as authentication, or the ability
to pay for purchases. Townend and et al. [29] deﬁned trust as
the level of reliance placed on an entity based on experience
of a particular context. Pereira and et al. [30] viewed the trust
concept as the degree of conﬁdence given to an entity. Neama
et al. [31] considered trust as an assurance among participants
while engaging in online auctions. Many researchers deﬁned
trust as a subjective probability that leads an individual to
believe that another person will behave as expected [32] and
as a particular level of subjective probability in which an agent
assesses one or more agents to perform a speciﬁc action [33]
[34].
B. Risk
Similar to trust, risk depends on the context as well.
However, several works interpret risk as the probability of a
negative event occurring. When taking risk into consideration,
it is important to identify then evaluate it. The evaluation can
be qualitative or quantitative. Flinn and et al. [35] deﬁned
risk as ﬁnding the balance between the likely cost and the
possible reward. The cost is based on the likelihood of harm
and its magnitude, which can be hard to asses. Jarvenpaa
and et al. [36] deﬁned risk perception as the ”trustor’s belief
about likelihoods of gains and losses.” Yet Dwaikat and Parisi-
Presicce [37] deﬁned risk as the probability of exploitation
of vulnerabilities in terms of software. Liu and et al. [38]
mentioned the ISO/IEC TR 133351 deﬁnition of risk, which
is related to the likelihood of exploiting vulnerabilities. Risk
was also deﬁned as the likelihood of an unwanted event and
its consequence according to some studies [29] [32].
C. Relationship Between Trust and Risk
It is necessary to understand the relationship between
trust and risk to know how to use them for decision-making.
According to our analysis of previous works, many types of
relationships were identiﬁed.
1) Risk inﬂuences trust: In this relationship, risk may
inﬂuence trust calculation [39],trust deﬁnition [1] and trust
relationships [40].Also, some works [28] [36] [41] showed that
trust is associated with lower perceived risk.
2) Trust inﬂuences risk: In this relationship, trust may
inﬂuence risk calculation [4], risk assessment [42], risk miti-
gation [43], risk relationship [44], and risk management [45].
3) Complements to each other: Trust and risk can be
viewed as complements to each other. Daniel and Ken
[27]
demonstrated that most systems consider trust and risk as
complementary or ignore them. In our opinion, having such
a relationship might lead to the use of one of them as a factor
for decision-making because the other one is its complement.
4) No relationship: It is also possible that there is no
connection between trust and risk. For example, trust can be
considered as a property of principles but risk as a property of
a process [27]. Kim and et al. [46] showed that it is common
to treat trust and risk as different concepts. In our opinion, this
is practical if we deal with trust as a property of an entity that
can make decisions and uses risk as a property of the decision
itself.
III.
USING TRUST AND RISK IN MULTI-STAKEHOLDER
DECISION-MAKING
Decision-making is not limited only to an individual’s
decision. Some scenarios involve more than one person to
make a decision. In these cases, it is called multi-stakeholders
or Group Decision-Making (GDM) [47]. One member involved
in a group no longer makes the ﬁnal decision without the
involvement of other members. In social settings, different
approaches, such as taking the average of all the participant
responses or taking the majority decision as ﬁnal, have been
proposed. Arrow’s impossibility theorem is used in the ﬁeld
of GDM. According to Herrmann [48], ”When we consider
the group decision-making problem (with more than two
choices), it is clear that it would be nice to have a ‘fair’
procedure that combined the individuals’ preferences about the
alternatives (expressed as rankings) into a statement about the
group’s preferences about the alternatives while preserving the
autonomy of each individual.”
A. Multi-stakeholder decision-making process
The involvement of multiple participants when making
a decision makes it essential to construct a process that
takes each individual selection into consideration to reach a
ﬁnal decision. There are different types of multi-stakeholder
decision-making processes. However, based on our analysis of
the existing works, we found that the three common processes
are consensus, ranking, and voting(Table I).
Voting, for example, is considered a simple method because
it involves making a decision based on the majority vote.
However, its limitation comes from treating all participants
equally even though they are different in terms of expertise.
Also, the outcome of voting may be unsatisfactory for the
members whose decisions received less votes [8]. Consensus,
however, does have the advantage of reaching a solution
that is agreed by everyone [7]. Thus, the decision makers
need to negotiate several rounds, and in each round, they
must modify their proposed solutions to be decided by other
participants. However, this has its limitation as the participants
cannot inﬂuence others, which could lead to an inﬁnite number
of rounds. The ranking process is used in several multi-
stakeholder decision-making model by ranking the suggestions
of each participant [9]. This has the advantage of knowing
the degree of group convergence, which is useful in selecting
the solution that receives the higher ranking. However, its
limitation is the difﬁculty of ranking a large number of
decisions. Also, it is possible that each participant will rank
the solutions but will give his or her own the highest ranking.
In terms of using trust on those processes, it has been
applied in a different way like obtaining the advices from the
trusted individuals or weighting each alternative with the trust
of the individual. Tundjungsari and et al. [5] used trust for the
consensus process and showed that the consensus decision is

Difﬁculty to rank the large number of decisions
reached when decision makers adjust their preferences, such as
the importance of the decision criteria, which can be obtained
from the advice of other trusted participants. For the voting
process, Rodriguez [8] aggregated single votes to a single
collective decision and used trust to weight the inﬂuences of
the decision makers in decision-making. Capuano and et al. [9]
proposed a multi-stakeholder decision-making model to rank
the preferences. However, in some cases, the decision makers
may not have enough information about some alternatives to
accurately rank them. Therefore, the decision maker’s opinion
about such alternatives is inﬂuenced by other experts he or she
trusts.
B. Multi-stakeholder Decision-Making Models
According to French and et al. [49], there are ﬁve classes
of GDM models. The ﬁrst model, GDM1, assumes that the
decision makers propose then aggregate their individual so-
lutions, rank them based on their utilities, and ﬁnally select
the highest ranked solution. In the second model, GDM2, the
decision makers propose their individual solutions and use
them as preferences when voting. In the third model, GDM3,
there is a supra-decision maker that manages the decision-
making process among the decision makers. The fourth model,
GDM4, ﬁnds group utility to reach a consensus. In the ﬁfth
model, DGM5, the decision makers use the bargaining theory.
There is no model better than the others because each model is
useful in speciﬁc applications. For example, GDM1 is useful
for applications that take individual preferences into account,
GDM2 for applications that use voting as a decision-making
process, GDM3 for applications where there is a hierarchy
among participants, GDM4 for applications that take group
preferences for the consensus process into account, and GDM5
for applications that deal with resource allocations.
C. Trust in Multi-stakeholder Decision-Making
Trust in multi-stakeholder decision-making is crucial [6]
because it is a valuable group component and is essential
in the collaboration process. It becomes, however, a further
complicated or more dependent parameter when an expert may
be uncertain, have incomplete information, or cannot access
information. Experts have to use their domain expertise to
arrive at a decision. An expert may give his or her subjective
preferences, but they may not be agreed to by other team
members. In such situations, experts have to collaborate,
exchange information, and arrive at a consensus. Jian Wu and
Francisco Chiclana [50] stated that the trust can indicate the
actual reputation between experts Consequently, it should be
taken into account as a credible source to be used in deriving
aggregation weights for individual experts. As a matter of a
fact, trust can be used in the decision-making process to weight
the inﬂuence of different decision makers [8].
Several schemes for multi-stakeholder decision-making
vary in terms of the trust model, as well as the GDM model
and process. In addition, each of the schemes comes with
limitations. For example, some schemes [5] [6] [10] [12]–[14]
do not allow the stakeholder to modify the decision outcome
because there is a ﬁxed set of decisions to select from. Such
ﬁxed outcomes limit the stakeholder’s ability to propose a new
outcome. Some schemes [8] [9] apply preferences ordering. A
large number of preferences is challenging to the stakeholder
to order. In addition, each stakeholder might rank his or her
own preference higher if he or she is the one proposing the
decision outcome. Some schemes [7] [15] do not use historical
interactions; they may lead to missing extra information that
might help the stakeholder when proposing solutions and
selecting the ﬁnal decision. Some schemes [7] [11] limit trust
to speciﬁc stakeholders, which leads to limited information in
the problem domain (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Limitations of Existing Multi-stakeholder Decision-making
Schemes
Table II shows the existing multi-stakeholder decision-
making schemes with the corresponding trust model, GDM
process and model, limitations, and applications.
1) Tundjungsari, Istiyanto, et al.: Tundjungsari, Istiyanto,
et al. [5] proposed a multistakeholder decision-making model
for urban planning in rural areas by combining a trust model
proposed by Abdul-rahman and Hailes [51] and the GDM3
model that assigns a supra-decision maker to manage the
consensus process. This scheme is useful for applications that
require assigning different roles to decision makers based on
trust.
2) Indiramma and Anandakumar: The authors proposed
a multistakeholder decision-making model for soil erosion
applications [6]. In their scheme, they showed a multi-agent-
based collaborative decision-making framework for distributed
environments. Trust is strengthened by familiarity and sim-
ilarity beliefs and evaluated during collaboration. The pro-
posed decision model starts by collecting the decision maker’s
decisions and allows each agent to discuss any decisions,
criteria, and conﬂicts. The trust values are then computed and
aggregated, and each agent rates those trust values. The highest
trusted decision is selected as the ﬁnal decision.

large numbers of decision makers [7]. In their scheme, there
are two groups: the selected expert and the nonselected expert
groups. The nonselected expert group provides the utility
toward the selected ones to establish the trust network.
4) Rodriguez:
The author proposed a multistakeholder
decision-making model for social decision support system
applications [8]. In this scheme, the author proposed a process
consisting of three serial stages; individual solution rank-
ing,collective solution ranking and solution selection from
collective solution ranking. Trust reﬂects the similarity and
expertise of the individuals and is used to weight the inﬂuence
of decision makers in the decision-making process.
5) Capuano, Chiclana, et al.: The authors proposed a
multistakeholder decision-making model for applications that
have incomplete information [9]. In their scheme, they pro-
posed a model that adopts fuzzy rankings to collect experts’
preferences on available alternatives and trust statements on
other experts. Sometimes, experts cannot express an opinion
on any of the available alternatives, leading to incomplete
information. Therefore, to estimate the missing preferences,
the Social Inﬂuence Network (SIN) addresses the experts’
inﬂuences. Then, the aggregation process is applied, followed
by selection of the best alternative.
6) Lau, Singh and Tan Scheme: The authors proposed a
multistakeholder decision-making model for coalition forma-
tion applications in multiagent system environments [10]. In
their scheme, they proposed a Weighted Voting Mechanism
(WVM) that allows agents to join existing coalitions. There
are two types of votes: agreement and disagreement. The trust
element is the main criterion for deciding the weight in the
voting session. The trust ration can be low, medium, or high.
7) Sanchez-Anguix, Julian, et al.: The authors proposed a
multistakeholder decision-making model for a bilateral alter-
nating protocol in electronic systems [11]. In their scheme,
they proposed a mediated negotiation model for agent-based
teams that negotiate with an opponent. This negotiation model
deﬁnes the communication protocol with the opponent and the
decisions of the negotiation team. Trust only applies to the
group meditator because he manages the negotiation process
and counts the votes from the team members.
8) Wu, Chiclana, et al.: The authors proposed a multi-
stakeholder decision-making model for incomplete linguistic
information contexts [12]. They proposed a trust propagation
method to derive trust from incomplete connected trust net-
works. The decision-making model consists of computing trust
degrees; estimating unknown preference values; determining
the consensus index, consensus identiﬁcation, recommenda-
tion, and feedback; and establishing a selection process. Sim-
ilarly, they proposed a decision-making model [14] that is
different from one [12] that employs dual trust (trust, distrust)
and nonlinguistic assessments.
9) Liu, Liang et al.: The authors proposed a multistake-
holder decision-making model for cloud service suppliers [13].
The proposed decision-making model consists of four stages:
”(1) Constructing the interval-valued trust decision making
space; (2) Determining the consensus degree at three levels; (3)
Visual consensus identiﬁcation, trust induced recommendation
and rationality analysis; and (4) Selection Process.”. This
model has the advantage of having a fewer number of rounds
by using the harmony degree in addition to the consensus
degree.
10)Park, Cho, et al.: The authors proposed a multistake-
holder decision-making model for supplier selection [15]. The
proposed scheme uses the stakeholder trustworthiness as an
inﬂuencing factor on the ﬁnal decision. The decision-making
process uses weighted scoring system, where the trustworthi-
ness are used for the weights. Moreover, decision alternatives
ranking is applied in this decision-making scheme.
D. Risk in Multi-stakeholder Decision Making
Due to the consequences that might occur following the
decision, using such consequences as decision criteria could be
practical to decision makers. Table III summarizes the existing
GDM model with the corresponding risk model and process.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Decision-making is deeply interwoven in people’s lives
and is saturated in almost every ﬁeld. It also incorporates
various methods and factors that can affect the outcome of
a decision. Collaborative decisions may involve negotiation,
which requires creating some level of trust among the partic-
ipants. Usually, decisions come with consequences. The main
contribution of this paper is analyzing the existing schemes
of multi-stakeholder decision-making based on trust and risk.
This paper also explores the concepts of trust and risk and
categorizes the relationship between them to investigate how
to adopt them when designing a decision model. Moreover,
we investigate some decision-making processes such as voting,
consensus, ranking, and GDM models. We found the consensus
process and GDM1 model are mostly applied in the existing
schemes. For future work, we will build a multi-stakeholder
decision-making framework that is applicable to every context
and uses trust and risk as factors.
