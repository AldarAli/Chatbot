Abstract—Providing access to the Internet or other network
services to remote regions with low population density is quite
complicated, since telecommunications companies may be un-
willing to invest in a communications infrastructure in these
locations. A possible solution to this problem is using Vehicular
Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) with Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN)
architecture in order to provide Internet access and other services
to these regions. This is quite a challenging task because it is
really difﬁcult to predict when vehicular nodes will be in contact
with each other and how long it will remain connected. In this
paper , we are proposing a unique VANET/DTN routing strategy
based on a new metric called Trend of Delivery (ToD). The
results have shown that our proposition had better performance
than other classical DTN protocols when applied to VANET. We
used the Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to implement classical DTN
protocols as: Epidemic, Prophet and Spray-and-Wait in order
to compare with our proposition. The simulation shows a good
performance of the proposed strategy, maintaining good delivery
rate while keeping overhead low, unlike purely epidemic strategy,
where the overhead increases uncontrollably.

I. INTRODUCTION
DTNs are a special class of networks that allow commu-
nication between regions with strong connectivity constraints,
propagation delays and high error rates. In these regions, there
is no way to use reliable communication and routing protocols
or common standards for wireless networks as has been shown
by Sadagopan et al. [1].
To overcome these constraints, the RFC4838 [2] propose
that the DTN architecture can store persistent messages in a
new network layer named the bundle layer until the node con-
nectivity could be restored. This layer can provide communi-
cation between heterogeneous networks operating at different
transmission media.
In the environment where we want to provide communi-
cation between the distant regions using the VANET/DTN,
the Epidemic protocol [20] may achieve a high delivery rate,
but its overhead is too high. The Spray-And-Wait [22] keeps
overhead low, but its delivery rate may not be practical,
because it controls ﬂooding by reducing the number of copies
to be made. However it does not use any smart strategy to
know when it is appropriate to copy. The PROPHET [21] may
have performance issues if there is no reencounters, since it
is based on historical encounters.
In our paper, we propose a new VANET/DTN routing
strategy, based on a new metric called the Trend of Delivery,
which was created especially for this work by using fuzzy
logic, in order to assist in the routing task. We also consider
other recommendations proposed by Cabrera et al. [3] (the
transmission range assumption, use of stale information, and
an objective function in trajectory-based routing) for the
development of our DTN routing protocol in order to satisfy
operating constraints in a real environment. This protocol has
been named the Vehicular Delay Tolerant Network - Trend of
Delivery (VDTN-TD).
Bromage et al. [28] proposed a DTN routing framework
based on epidemic behavior and mobility history of the nodes
called the Trajectory-Assisted Routing (TAROT). In this work,
the TAROT nodes only will be infected, in other words, they
will receive a copy of the message, if their mobility pattern
takes them closer to the destination. According to [28], when
the protocol succeeds in combining intelligently replication
and forwarding the messages, this leads to a reduction of
overhead. Similarly to the TAROT, VDTN-TD reduces the
overhead by using an intelligent forwarding strategy.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section
II describes the related works. Section III covers the theoretical
foundation, with a quick overview of VANET, DTN and DTN
routing. The Section IV describes how ToD is calculed, also
it presents VDTN-TD, the routing protocol proposed. The
Section V shows the experiments and resultsobtained through
simulations in ns-3. Finally, Section VI includes an outlook to
future works and the conclusion.
II. RELATED WORK
DTNs are recurrent themes in the literature [3-7]. Many
routing protocols have been proposed and they can be clas-
siﬁed according to their operations [7]. Franck et al. [8] pre-
sented the attributes and requirements for VANET’s operation
and described how DTN can help to overcome the problems
caused by high disconnection in a vehicular network. For
this purpose, many tests were performed using nodes with
and without vehicular DTN activated in different network
conditions. The authors concluded that purely a VANET node
has a high rate of packet loss and that even in a scenario
with VANET/DTN packet loss is encountered due to routing
loops in isolated clusters. This paper uses the combined

VANET/DTN to overcome disconnection problems inherent
in vehicular networks.
Cheng et al. [9] proposed a DTN routing protocol called
hybrid GeoDTN+Nav that explored the details of vehicular
mobility and navigation systems on-board to carry the mes-
sages. According to the authors, the protocol outperforms
protocols Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing [10] and Greedy
Perimeter Coordinator Routing [11] by comparing the rates of
message delivery.
Besides the VDTN-ToD uses this mobility information, it
also uses fuzzy logic [12] to identify mobility patterns and
then decide when it is appropriate to: copy, forward or stay
with the message.
III. THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
A. Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks
VANETs are a subclass of mobile ad hoc networks that
emerged due to the advancement in technology for transmitting
wireless networks. One of the main factors that boosted
its development was the need to improve safety and trafﬁc
efﬁciency through communication between vehicles. Although
similar to a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), a VANET
has speciﬁc characteristics that the protocols, developed for
MANET, are not suitable for operation in VANETs [13].
In a VANET, two categories of applications can be de-
veloped. One is focused on safety and the other should
provide comfort to passengers. The ﬁrst category contributes
to improving the efﬁciency of vehicular trafﬁc and to decrease
risk situations such as sending alert messages when an accident
occurs. However, the second category’s focus is to make the
entire trip enjoyable for the passengers. This can be achieved
through applications that provide access to the Internet such as,
chat with passengers of other vehicles, radios online, games,
restaurants or other information relevant to the comfort of the
trip [14].
B. Delay Tolerant Networks
DTN is architected by the group Delay Tolerant Network
Research Group (DTNRG), a part of the Internet Research
Task Force (IRTF), that enables the operation of networks
operating in environments with intermittent connectivity and
high delays.
In the design of the DTN architecture the following require-
ments have been proposed: reliable delivery, security services
and ﬂexible framework for identiﬁcation of late binding.
In order to attend these requirements, the architecture has
included a bundle layer operating above the transport layer,
where the packet of this layer is called bundle, permitting
the DTN to support intercommunication among heterogeneous
networks through the DTN gateways.
The DTN architecture was deﬁned in 2007 by RFC 4838
[2] together with the speciﬁcations of the bundle protocol by
RFC 5050 [15]. Later, in 2010 and 2011, they were deﬁned
in RFCs 6255 [16] and 6257 [17].
In this paper, we aim to establish communication between
remote regions, in the sparse environment, using vehicles as

data mules [29], as can be seen in Figure 2. A region in
the context of DTN, as illustrated in Figure 2, represents a
communication network that comprises one or more nodes
interconnected via protocols that are exclusive to their commu-
nication needs. The DTN is designed to enable communication
between different regions through the DTN gateway, using
the bundle layer that is able to provide such communication,
through speciﬁc protocol stacks to each region as shown in
Figure 1.
C. DTN Routing
A route (journey) in DTN is a sequence of communication
opportunities, foreseen or unforeseen without guarantee of
stability. At each contact, the message can be forwarded,
copied or retained. Accordingly, the main goal of a DTN
routing protocol is to increase the probability of message
delivery while it aims to reduce the end-to-end delay. In
challenging environments which the DTN operates, traditional
routing protocols like Optimized Link State Routing Protocol
(OLSR) and Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing
(AODV) do not work properly [4]. Therefore, several speciﬁc
DTN protocols were proposed.
IV. ROUTING PROTOCOL VDTN-TOD
A. Trend of Delivery
Trend of Delivery is based on fuzzy logic that serves to
evaluate how the mobility of nodes contributes to the delivery
of a message to a ﬁxed destination node. The ToD is composed
by three linguistic variables (explained below) that are very
important to the decision process, the sense (ωi,d), the distance
(ψi,d) and the speed (τi,d), where i denotes the node with
the custody of the message and d is a border gateway of
any destination region. Vehicles that possess the custody of
messages must decide if the transfer will be effectuated based
on these three metrics.

Categories of variable linguistic sense
1) Sense (ω): The sense is calculated by the node that
stores the message when cross with another vehicle. Its value
is calculated as a function of the angle Θ formed between the
direction vector −→u and the vector turned to the destination
node −→v , as can be seen in Figure 3. To identify the degree
of importance of Θ on the approximation or departure of a
node with respect to the destination, in Figure 4, we deﬁne the
ranges of possible values of Θ. We propose four categories for
the sense variable, based on the nebulous identiﬁcation: great,
good, bad and awful. We identify four angles associated with
different categories of the sense variable in the range [0◦,
180◦]. We consider the same range of values for the great and
awful classes as also to good and bad classes. It is important
to point out that the values of Θ1 and Θ2, shown in 4, are
deﬁned as a function of distance from the node i to the node
d and transmission range (R). Values greater than 180◦ and
less than or equal to 360◦ can be converted easily to values
between 0 and 180 degrees using equation 1.
F(x) = 360 − x
(1)
Where x is Θ1 or Θ2. The ranges of the categories of ω (Figure
5) are dynamically deﬁned as a function of the distance from
node i to node d and R, this is necessary because when i
reaches d the angle Θ1 (Figure 4) gradually increases. The
values of the intervals are deﬁned according to Table I. Note
that θ1 + θ2 = 90◦.
2) Distance (ψ): For the distance linguistic variable we
deﬁne four categories, namely: very close, close, far and

very far. The pertinence functions of each variable are
deﬁned as follows:
• very close: x < R; close: R < x ≤ 2.R;
• far: 2.R < x ≤ 3.R; very far: x > 3.R
Where R is the value of the transmission range and x is the
distance from a node i to the destination.
3) Speed (τ): The velocity used refers to decomposed
velocity for the node i (vi,x) as the speed that indicates if
the vehicle approaches or moves away from the destination. It
is calculated according to equation 2.
vi,x = vi.cos(θ)
(2)
For the speed linguistic variable we deﬁne three categories:
low, medium and high.

These three linguistic variables ωi,d, ψi,d, τi,d are used
together in order to infer the ToD using defuzziﬁcation by
generating a value between 0 and 1. Furthermore, ToD is
classiﬁed by seven categories: maximum (MA), great (GR),
very good (VG), good (GO), bad (BA), very bad (VB) and
awful (AW) as depicted in Table II. The ToD is considered as
a maximum when the distance from a node to the destination
is smaller than the transmission range.
B. Features and Operation of VDTN-ToD
The protocol VDTN-ToD uses a dissemination scheme
and maintenance messages based on the location technique,
Adaptive Detection Coverage, proposed by Harri et al. [18].
Each node sends a message to disseminate positioning (mp)
when travels a portion of its transmission radius. In VDTN-
ToD, besides sending a message in the same way, the protocol
checks in advance if it is really necessary to send a new
message positioning taking into account the last positioning
message sent. With the present position and speed of the
vehicle. It is easy to predict the time at which a new posi-
tioning message (mp) must be sent, considering an average

speed of the vehicle and the transmission range. The interval
between the instant of sending the initial message and the
instant expected is divided into seven equal parts as shown in
Figure 6.
After each interval ti, the real position of the neighbouring
vehicle (Pr) is compared to the predicted position (Pp), i.e.,
if the absolute difference between Pr and Pp is greater than a
constant ϵ (epsilon), a new message is sent to all vehicles in
the neighborhood. The mp consists of the following ﬁelds:
• Position- position vector;
• Velocity- velocity vector;
• Sending Time- time sending of the message;
When a node i receives a mp of a node j it adds a new entry
in its routing table and calculates the time that both remained
in contact. If during that time, node i does not receive another
updated positioning message from j, node j is removed from
the routing table i.
The VDTN-ToD protocol periodically checks the routing
table in order to identify when a route has expired. This
veriﬁcation cycle is called the cycle of protocol (cp). At the
beginning of each cp, the VDTN-ToD calculates the expected
ToD of its neighbours for the next cycle, as well as their
intended ToD, so the decision making by the protocol can
be based on a conﬁguration of the future network.
When the two nodes i and j get contact with each other and
the ﬁrst one has custody of a message, it compares its ToD
with the one of the node j to decide which routing strategy
should be used. In this sense, the strategy may be:
1) Read: ToD(i, m) Trend of Delivery of the node i with
the message m
2) If ( (ToD(i, m) = {great, very good or good})
and (ToD(j, m) = {great, very good or good}) and
(ToD(i, m) ≤ ToD(j, m))), then the vehicle i copies
the message m to the vehicle j, thus the VDTN-TD is
intended to increase the probability of message delivery.
3) If ( (ToD(i, m) = {bad, very bad or awful})
and
(ToD(j, m) = {bad, very bad or awful}) and
(ToD(i, m) ≤ ToD(j, m))), then the vehicle i transfers
the custody of message m to the vehicle j in order
to delay the remoteness of the message in relation to
the destination without overloading the network with
unnecessary copies of the message.
4) If (ToD(i, m) and ToD(j, m) are opposed, for example,
good and bad, then
a) If (ToD(i, m) < ToD(j, m) the vehicle i transfers
the custody of message m to the vehicle j.
b) If (ToD(i, m) > ToD(j, m) i remains with the
message m.
When i has more than one neighbour, for each message, the

one that possess the greatest ToD will be chosen among all
its neighbours. This is represented mathematically as follows:
y = max(ToD(j, m)∀j∈J,∀m∈M)
(3)
Therefore, the ToD(y, m) will be compared with the
ToD(i, m) in the decision making according to the protocol
operations previously seen.
The buffer management is an important aspect when using
DTN protocols. We propose to use the ToD in order to manage
this problem. Here, the bundle that has a higher ToD has
priority over other bundles to remain in the buffer when the
drop is necessary. To know the order of which bundle in the
queue has to be sent, it is ﬁrst checked whether any of them is
a direct link, in other words, whether the neighbouring node
is the destination of the bundle, if not a such case, then the
bundle that has a higher ToD will be chosen.
V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
A. Scenario Description
The scenario used in our experiments is shown in Figure 7.
It has a ﬁxed node (1) considered as a DTN Gateway which
is responsible for sending bundles with pre-deﬁned sizes and
rates for destinations (3,5,6,7,8). This scenario was developed
using the tool Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) [19],
where we created ﬁve routes that lead towards region 1 and
ﬁve others that lead towards regions 5, 6, 7 and 8 (Table
III) on the map. The thicker lines on the Figure 7 represent
a road with two lanes opposed to each other where two
vehicle nodes travel. The ﬁrst vehicle follows the circular
route 5-2-6-1-2-3-5 and the second one follows 6-2-5-3-2-1-6
throughout the simulation, other nodes randomly choose which
noncircular routes of the Table III they will follow. During

the generation of the bundles, the DTN sender node knows
the geolocation of the gateway node of the destination regions
and this information is loaded into the bundle, thus the ToD
calculation can be performed during the decision making of
the protocol.

The experiments were performed using the Network Simu-
lator 3.13 as described in Table IV. We implemented the fol-
lowing classical DTN protocols: Epidemic [20], Probabilistic
Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity
(PROPHET) [21] and Spray and Wait [22] in order to compare
with our VDTN-ToD.
B. Metrics
For this work we use three metrics to evaluate and compare
the performance of VDTN-ToD, they are the Delivery Rate,
the Overhead and the Average Delay. We assume Bg for
bundles generated by the source during simulation, Bc for
bundles copied, Bct for bundles that are transfered by custody
and Br for bundles successfully received in destination.
The Delivery Rate is calculated taking into account the
equation 4 which calculates how many bundles have reached
the destination.
delivery rate = Br
Bg
(4)
The overhead is calculated according to equation 5, which
compares the copied and transmitted bundles with the received
ones.
overhead = (Bc + Bct) − Br
Bg
(5)
The average delay denotes the average time spent by the
bundles in order to travel between the source and the destina-
tion regions.
C. Analysis of Results
First, we analyze the Delivery Rate. This metric is impor-
tant because it reﬂects how the protocols behave in different
situations. In a challenging network as VANET, the main
problems are related to low connectivity and packet loss.
In this case, it is important that a DTN routing protocol
adapted to VANET use a good strategy so as to not overly
consume network resources in adverse situations and behaves
well especially when transferring bundles of relatively large
size.
In this context, the proposed protocol achieved good results
in challenging scenarios, such as shown in Figure 8. In this

scenario, the VDTN-ToD get a delivery rate between 30%
and 50%, while the Spray-And-Wait and PROPHET stay with
lower rates. In the case of the Spray-And-Wait, it do not use
any mechanism to know when it should or should not spread a
bundle, thus the possibility to achieve the destination is smaller
than the VDTN-ToD. In the case of the PROPHET, there is a
poor performance because it depended on the historical basis
of the encounter, what it is difﬁcult to build considering that
in this scenario one vehicle can hardly meet another again.
We see in Figure 8 that the Epidemic protocol has the
Delivery Rate much higher than the VDTN-ToD, but as seen
in Figure 9, the overhead caused by the Epidemic is extremely
higher and it grows in an uncontrolled manner as the density of
nodes increases, showing its low scalability. The second metric
analyzed is Overhead. In Figure 9 we see that the overhead of
VDTN-ToD is really low, becoming very close to the Spray-
And-Wait (Despite its higher delivery rate). Note also that the
VDTN-ToD in a more dense scenario (VpH 150) maintains the
overhead close to the less dense scenario (VpH 50), unlike the
Epidemic protocol that its overhead rapidly increase in a more
dense scenario. We show that the VDTN-ToD can disseminate
bundles efﬁciently to reach the destination without excessively
overloading the network resources, i.e., it has a good delivery
rate and is also scalable.

The ﬁnal one is the Average Delay. In Figure 10, in the
less dense scenario (50 VpH), the Epidemic protocol achieves
better results, since Epidemic node copies the bundles for all
nodes that it comes in contact, the information spreads widely
in this scenario, contributing to the bundle arriving quickly to
the destination. When a node VDTN-ToD forward a message
to a neighbouring node, the choice is aided by the proximity to
the destination and speed of the neighbouring node, thereby,
although a few copies, VDTN-ToD achieves better results as
shown in the Figure 10 (150 VpH), where VDTN-ToD reaches
a delay smaller than the Epidemic.
From our experimental results we conclude that VDTN-ToD
has a good ability to adapt to the environment proposed due to
its well-formulated decision making, ensuring smart forwards
that cause low network overhead. This can be seen through its
good delivery rate and low overhead.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
One of the major simulation tools used to validate the
DTN routing protocols is the Opportunistic Networking En-
vironment (ONE). This simulator is used in several published
studies [23] [24] [25], but there are situations where it is
necessary to consider the propagation error of the messages
that are inherent in wireless networks what is not provided
by ONE. Differently, in this work, we use the simulator ns-3.
We develop an environment capable of simulating a vehicle
network together with the architecture of Delay Tolerant
Networks using a module developed by Herbertsson [26].

Regarding the techniques used to create the protocol VDTN-
ToD, becomes clear that we achieved great results, regarding
good practices that should be employed in the development of
protocols that must consider the characteristics and limitations
of vehicular networks.
In general, the metric trend of delivery can be used for
decision making in other DTN routing protocols. A future
work is to incorporate the ToD mechanism in PROPHET and
Spray-and-Wait in order to be used as a VDTN protocol.
Furthermore, we will analyze the behavior of our protocol
in a denser scenario, also we will evaluate perfomance when
source and destination are mobile nodes. The classical DTN
protocols and VDTN-ToD are available for downloading in
[27].
