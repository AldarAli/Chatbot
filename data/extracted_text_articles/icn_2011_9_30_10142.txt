Abstract—VANETs have the ability to transmit various types of
information between a vehicle and another, or between a vehicle
and a ﬁxed station. However, transmission may be impaired due
to long delays, quantity of collisions and signal noise. This is
caused, in part, by abrupt changes in the network topology. Thus,
in order to maintain the quality and stability of the network, a
mechanism is proposed for the vehicle to self-adapt dynamically
according to the context. For this purpose, MAC layer parameters
must be changed, allowing better control of access to the medium.

I. INTRODUCTION
The main goal of VANETs (Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks)
is to allow vehicles to exchange information to enable the
use of safety support applications such as: emergency warning
systems and accident prevention. But, comfort applications are
another type of application that will be present in VANETs [1].
The network environment present in VANETs can take on
diverse conﬁgurations. It can be a sparse network without
atmospheric interference, or it can be a dense network on
a rainy day in a big city. This second scenario can lead to
a strong degradation of network performance. Moreover, this
environment can change from sparse to dense or vice-versa.
In each case, the network needs to adapt to the environment
in order to work properly [2].
Thus, in order to optimize network resources, meet the
requirements of different applications and dynamically adapt
to network conditions and trafﬁc, we propose a mechanism that
has been developed with the support of fuzzy intelligence in
order to better control the VANETs and adapt medium access
control (MAC).
This work is organized as follows: Section 2 presents
related works. In Section 3 the theoretical basis is shown. The
architecture is explained in detail in Section 4. Sections 5 and
6 report on the scenario, results and analysis. Future works
and conclusion are outlined in the last sections.
II. RELATED WORK
In VANETs, the adaptability of protocols to the environment
has been investigated with the goal of not letting a highly
changeable scenario degrade network quality.
Shankar et al. [3] shows that the rapid changes in the quality
of connections and the rapid mobility of vehicles cause the
sub-utilization of network resources when the default network
settings are static. Thus, a scheme is proposed for adapting the
transmission rate to better utilize network capacity. For this
adaptation, the proposed scheme evaluates some information
from GPS (Global Positioning System) and some metrics of
network performance. However, in this paper, density was not
used as a context parameter.
Artimy et al. [4], consider density as an important parameter
in their work. The rapid change in topology, due to trafﬁc jams,
is shown to disturb the homogenous distribution of vehicles
on the road. Dynamic transmission power has been proposed
as a manner to maintain network connectivity and minimize
the adverse effects of unregulated power.
The contention window (CW) also plays an important role
in adjusting the network. In the paper of Wang et al. [5], the
contention window (CW) of a vehicle is adapted according to
the neighborhood density of a stationary unit (RSU). Thus, the
adaptation algorithm is centered on the RSU.
Another aspect that has received attention in the scientiﬁc
community is Quality of Service (QoS), because it is very
vulnerable to the environment. Adler et al. [6] proposes a
system to prioritize messages based on context and content. On
this basis, a function of relevance is calculated for each mes-
sage, and each message will have different CWs (Contention
Window).
Protocol scalability also gains with the adaptation. Mertens
et al. [7] states that, in broadcast scenarios, there are signiﬁcant
problems with scalability due to the ﬂood of messages among
the cars. In this adaptation, the CW is modiﬁed according to
the PER (Packet Error Rate), and the data transmission rate is
changed according to the degree of congestion of the channels.
It is important to quote the all the approaches proposed
above for VANETs MAC layer address changes have a reactive
aspect, i.e., they wait for the channel to become congested or
for the level of the PER to increase. These solutions do not
prevent large amounts of packets from being discarded while
waiting for the network to adapt through some mechanism in
order to change that scenario. Another unpromising approach
is to individually set the importance of each message through
different CWs for each one. This creates a large overhead and
processing time.
In order to overcome this problem, this article proposes a
mechanism of network adaptation to the trafﬁc scenario in

VANETs in order to improve the quality of transmission and
reception of packets. Trafﬁc density information are taken into
account as a parameter to be used by a trafﬁc based fuzzy
logic analyzer and, thereafter, the MAC layer parameters can
be change dynamically. The proposed architecture consists
of two main modules: a contextual information captor and
an information analyzer. It is important to note that the
changes are predictive, since they do not have to wait for any
degradation of the network to make any adjustments.
III. THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
A. Density
In different VANETs scenarios, speed ﬂuctuation, trafﬁc
signs, the road model and other factors that are described
in trafﬁc engineering contribute signiﬁcantly to changes in
network density, disrupting homogeneous node distribution.
These abrupt and frequent changes create a highly dynamic
topology and can cause degradation in network performance
if the protocols are not designed to handle such situations.
Panichpapiboon et al. [8] and Youseﬁ et al. [9] show studies
on network connectivity and attest to the importance of density
for the connection. Among other things, they emphasize that
density affects network connectivity proportionally, i.e., the
higher the density, the greater the connectivity. The impact of
network connectivity can be felt in different ways. Tonguz
et al. [10] shows that higher the density, the higher the
packet loss rate due to problems of contention and collisions.
Moreover, reducing the density increases idle time spent in
transmission / reception of a packet and for a sparse network
there will be more retransmissions as observed in Shankar et
al. [3] and was observed that increasing the density increases
the rate of penetration, i.e., the number of nodes that can be
reached by the message [8] [10].
Therefore, density can be considered a very important
feature for VANETs. A protocol project should consider its
inﬂuence on the quality of transmissions to allow continuous
and reliable exchange of information between vehicles.
B. Backoff Time
Backoff time is a time value that determines the time of
transmission. It is calculated by a random value, chosen based
on the contention window, multiplied by a time slot [11].
Higher priority will be assigned to the least amount of backoff
time. The backoff value has been taken into account in the
fuzzy system calculations and in the evaluations made in this
work.
Besides the density, Natkaniec et al. [12] estimated that
the contention window is crucial to reduce the probability
of collision and increase network throughput. Bianchi [13]
presents a more detailed study of this feature by showing
that the saturation throughput, limit reached by the through-
put in overcrowded conditions, is strongly dependent on the
contention window and that its optimal value choice depends
on the number of network nodes.
C. Fuzzy Logic
The probability theory can be used to formally represent
information in stochastic decision environments. It represents
the uncertainty associated with the randomness of events. The
theory of fuzzy sets, in turn, seeks to represent the uncertainty
associated with vague, inaccurate or independently unrelated
information. These sets were developed by Lotﬁ Zadeh and
initially published in 1965 [14].
Given that present day complex networks are dynamic, i.e.,
there is great uncertainty associated with the input trafﬁc
and other environmental parameters, that they are subject to
unexpected overloads, failures and disturbances, and that they
defy accurate analytical modeling, fuzzy logic appears to be a
promising approach to address key aspects of networks. The
ability to model networks in the continuum mathematics of
fuzzy sets rather than with traditional discrete values, coupled
with extensive simulation, offers a reasonable compromise
between rigorous analytical modeling and purely qualitative
simulation [15].
D. Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC)
Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) is the
standardization of a spectrum band in the United States [2]. In
1999, the Federal Communication Commission of the United
States allocated 75MHz of the DSRC spectrum in 5.9 GHz
to be used exclusively for vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-
infrastructure communications.
The DSRC spectrum is divided into 7 channels of 10 MHz.
Channel 178 is the control channel (CCH), which is exclu-
sive for security communications. The two side channels are
reserved for special uses. Others are service channels (SCH)
available for use in security and comfort communications.
WAVE architecture (Wireless Access in the Vehicular En-
vironment) uses standard DSRC.
E. Wireless Access in the Vehicular Environment
In 2004, the IEEE began the standardization of communica-
tions in vehicular networks, called WAVE architecture (ﬁgure
1) which is deﬁned currently in ﬁve documents: IEEE P1609.1,
IEEE P1609.2, IEEE P1609.3, IEEE P1609.4, IEEE 802.11p.
IEEE 802.11p deﬁnes the physical layer and medium access
control (MAC) for vehicular networks. This proposed standard
speciﬁes the extensions to IEEE 802.11 that are necessary to
provide wireless communications in a vehicular environment.

F. Wave Short Message Protocol (WSMP)
According to Figure 1, WSMP (WAVE Short Message
Protocol) is an alternative to the use of TCP / UDP, and
IPv6 in WAVE environments. The justiﬁcation of an alternative
network service is the greater efﬁciency in the WAVE environ-
ment, where it is expected that most applications require very
low latency and are non-connection-oriented. Many broadcast
applications use WSMP to minimize the size of messages and
reduce the delay for critical security messages [16] [17].
IV. PROPOSED MECHANISM
In this paper, we propose a mechanism for backoff time self-
adaptation in VANETs, as illustrated in Figure 2. The Captor
module is responsible for obtaining density information that is
passed to the Analyzer. The Analyzer also receives information
about the value of the random backoff time chosen. from the
802.11p MAC layer protocol. Using the value received, the
analyzer will check if this value is conforming to the current
situation of vehicular trafﬁc. Without this mechanism, in a very
dense scenario, the value of the backoff time chosen may be
very small. In this case, when there are several transmitting
cars, there may be a higher probability of collisions, losses,
etc.

Proposed Mechanism
One advantage of this mechanism is the use of predic-
tion rather than reaction. There is no need to wait for the
degradation of the service network to do something about
it. In reactive systems, during the time taken to measure the
degree of congestion in a channel, the amount of PER or the
amount of collisions, only to adapt the network parameters,
there may be more collisions and more packet loss. Using
density as a context descriptor and performing dynamic update
of parameters, there is no need to let the network conditions
get worse and then make an adjustment. Before there is a
decline in transmission quality, the network can already adapt
and thus maintain its stability.
A. Captor
Literature mentions two ways to obtain the density for a
particular vehicle. The density can be disseminated among
the vehicles through beacon messages [3] [18]. Each vehicle
delivers its speed and position to other vehicles. Thus, a
vehicle can count how many neighbors are in its range and
calculate its own density, and it may also spread its own
density. Another way is mentioned in Artimy et al. [4]. The
density is estimated based on the number and length of stops
the vehicle makes. The more the car stops, and the longer it
stands there, the greater the density.

Density by Transmission Range
As the focus of this paper is not to ﬁnd the best way to get
the density of a vehicle for this task we used a native function
of the simulator (see Section 5). The function calculates the
distance between vehicles in a given transmission range. As
the distance from a node to a given vehicle diminishes in
relationship to the transmission range of that vehicle, the value
of the density is increased. In Figure 3, the central vehicle has
a density of 7. The vehicle is at a distance D1 is being recorded
for that value, but the car at a distance D2 is not, because D2
is greater than the central vehicle transmission range.
The context information need not be calculated for each
transmission [3]. Considering that in scenarios of high mobil-
ity (vehicular speeds equal to 105km / h) in 100ms a vehicle
has moved less than 3m. As the density changes little in that
interval, we used 1 second periods to capture information
about density.

Fuzzy Sets for Backoff Value
The Analyzer receives the following information: the den-
sity, from the Captor module, and the backoff time based on
185

the MIB contention window range deﬁned by the 802.11p
protocol. The purpose of this module is to ensure that the
backoff time will be adjusted in accordance with the trafﬁc
scenario.
A fuzzy system is used to describe the values. Thus, a very
dense network should increase its backoff time to attempt a
reduction in the amount of packet collisions. A sparse network
should reduce the backoff time in order not to underutilize
network resources.
Figure 4 shows the fuzzy sets for density classiﬁcation based
on Wisitpongphan et al. [19].
Figure 5 shows the fuzzy sets that return the optimal backoff
time based on Wang et al. [5].
The fuzzy system calculates a new backoff value based on
vehicle density in order to optimize access to the medium. If
the density is low, the fuzzy system returns a small backoff
value and close to the optimum value [5] in order not to
underutilize the network. On the other hand, if the network is
dense, the returned backoff value is great and near to optimal
value, enough to provide a good cost-beneﬁt relationship
between throughput and collisions or loss.
A new backoff value is generated only when the channel
is busy, in other words, when the node is not transmitting,
although the density values are sent every second to the
Analyzer.
However, to avoid all vehicles from calculating the same
backoff time, the adjusted value is added to the little random
value generated by the 802.11p MAC layer protocol, which is
passed to the analyzer.
V. SCENARIO
The simulator used for the experiments was the NCTUns
6.0 [20]. The NCTUns has a complete implementation of IEEE
1609 and 802.11p standards. It is opensource and is allowed to
add on new modules and agents. However, the simulator does
not support more than 4096 nodes in a simple simulation.
The scenario used was a stretch of highway 6km long. All
vehicles have OBUs (On Board Units) and there is no RSU
(Road Side Unit). The propagation model used was the Two
Ray Ground [21]. Vehicular trafﬁc was generated according
to a Poisson process. Three environments were tested in this
scenario: a sparse density environment with 35 vehicles, an
average density environment with 50 vehicles, and a highly
dense environment with 200 vehicles.
Each vehicle has a transmission range of 1km and its
mobility is controlled automatically. This control is carried
out by an agent attached to the simulator called CarAgent.
The vehicles have a maximum speed of 130km/h, maximum
acceleration of 3m/s2 and maximum deceleration of 5m/s2.
All vehicles have 1.5 meter omnidirectional antennas.
Trafﬁc is generated through an agent called WSM which
simulates WSMP, but without retransmissions. Every 100ms,
a broadcast Wave Short Message is transmitted. For experi-
ments, we used an application that works with WSMP. Each
WSMP message has a length of 1458 bytes and uses the
control channel (178).
VI. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The aim of the experiments is to compare the adaptive
approach with the non-adaptive approach, i.e., to compare
the dynamic approach with the 802.11p standard. According
to Bilstrup et al. [11], IEEE 802.11p uses the following to
calculate backoff: (i) it chooses a uniform distribution integer
between 0 and CWmin (minimum contention window for a
given class), (ii) it multiplies the choosen integer by a certain
time slot at the physical layer, (iii) it decreases the backoff
only when the channel is free, (iv) when backoff reaches
zero, it transmits immediately. When a problem is detected
in the transmission, the value of the contention window is
doubled. Upon successful transmission, the contention window
value returns to the initial value. However, in broadcast
situations, there is no way to know if there was problem in
the transmission because there is no conﬁrmation. Thus, the
contention window value is always CWmin. Thus, there is a
higher probability of calculating the same backoff time and
transmitting data at the same time, causing a greater number
of collisions [22].
To analyze the network situation, we used three metrics:
number of packets received per second (BRX), amount of
packet loss (DROP) and percentage of success (SUC). The
amount of packets lost is the sum of errors caused by
collisions and discards. The success rate is the number of
packets received divided by the number of packets that should
have been successfully received if no losses occurred. Thus,
SUC = BRX/(BRX + DROP).
In the drop chart and packet loss chart, these values grow
up to a certain point, and then they decrease. This happens
because the densities calculated for each vehicle are very low
in the ﬁrst and the last moments. The cars enter and exit
by the Poisson process. These metrics will be highest when
all vehicles are present on the track, when it has the highest
density.
In ﬁgures 6, 7 and 8, with the adaptive approach, packet loss
is less than with the standard approach. This happens because
the vehicles use a backoff value close to optimum, reducing
the likelihood of the medium being used at the same time.

In ﬁgures 9, 10 and 11 with the adaptive approach, recep-
tions per second is greater than with the standard approach,
i.e., a greater number of neighboring vehicles is reported from
a single message from a transmitting node. Since there is no
retransmission, this metric provides a view of the rate of packet
delivery in the neighborhood of a node. Moreover, backoff
time is close to the optimum value. This way, the medium is
better shared.

This means that, considering the total number of packets that
should be received, the adaptive approach was more successful
than the standard approach.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This work, proposed a mechanism for context adaptation
to better control network use. Density was used as a context
descriptor, and the backoff time as a parameter to be changed
dynamically in each vehicle to handle its access to medium.
The adaptive approach has proven effective for all sce-
nario types: sparse, medium and dense. Collisions and drops
decreased. Useful network throughput was increased since
the amount of packets received per second increased in all
scenarios evaluated.
In the future, we intend to work with other network pa-
rameters, such as data rate, transmission power, AIFS, etc.
Other context parameters as speed, acceleration, connectivity,
signal strength, BER, etc can also be veriﬁed. In addition,
applications that use TCP, UDP or RTP will be tested. Other
ways to obtain density will also be analyzed.
