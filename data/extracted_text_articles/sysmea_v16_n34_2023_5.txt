Abstract — A wideband and high gain corrugated epsilon 
negative index metamaterial (ENG) Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna 
(AVA) with gain>12 dBi and working in frequency range from 
10 GHz - 25 GHz (for SATCOM applications) is proposed in 
this paper. The overall performance of the proposed Antipodal 
Vivaldi Antenna (AVA) is enriched by using a triangular 
shaped corrugation slots and pi (∏) shaped epsilon negative 
metamaterial cells. The ‘∏’ shaped metamaterial unit cells are 
positioned on the upper surface amid both radiators of AVA to 
emanate the intense electric field in the end-fire direction. The 
proposed antenna size is 22.6 mm × 15.8 mm x 1.6 mm and it is 
designed on the FR4 substrate. The proposed antenna is then 
fabricated using photolithography process and tested for its 
performances. There is good agreement between simulated and 
measured results. The measured gain varies from 6.2 – 10.7 
dBi.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
     Wideband antenna with high gain is the primary requisite 
for any communication system. Such a high gain wideband 
antenna is recently proposed in [1]. Furthermore, high data 
rates and increased quality of service (QoS) for end users 
are in ever-increasing demand due to the recent 
improvement and spectacular achievement in the field of 
wireless communication technology [2], [3]. Wireless 
communication system designers face a challenging task 
when designing compact and wideband antenna for high-
speed, high-capacity, and secure wireless communications. 
In contemporary times numerous designs of wideband 
antennas fulfilling varied objectives have been proposed by 
various researchers for modern wireless networks [4-6]. 
 
    To accomplish pervasive connectivity on the globe, 
SATellite COMmunication (SATCOM) is a crucial 
constituent of next-generation wireless communications. 
Also, SATCOM is one of the leading technologies used 
today for high speed internet communication [7]. Ku-band 
that is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which 
operates in frequency range from 12 GHz to 18 GHz, is one 
of prominent and widely used frequency band for satellite 
communication in the world. It is considered trustworthy for 
the high-powered satellite services used in digital TV, 
teleconferences, vehicular communication, entertainment, 
and international programming [8],[9]. Also, they find huge 
application in Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) [10] 
systems on ships, commercial aircraft, etc. 
 
     In recent times, a significant amount of research work 
has been proposed to design various vital components [11-
13] for SATCOM applications. The Vivaldi antenna was 
proposed and designed by Gibson for high-frequency 
applications [14]. Later, Gazit improved it by giving it an 
antipodal shape to enhance the bandwidth and gain [15]. By 
incorporating numerous enhancement methods, e.g., adding 
parasitic patch, dielectric lens, array and metamaterial, the 
parameters of the Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna (e.g., 
directivity, bandwidth, reduction inside lobe level, etc.) can 
be improved. Agahi et al. [16] proposed a novel scheme for 
enhancing the performance of AVA by integrating two 
small parasitic patches inserted adjacent to the conventional 
flare structure to make the current distribution stronger. The 
addition of the parasitic patches augment the bandwidth, 
nonetheless, the gain performance is not much improved. 
Moosazadeh et al. [17] proposed a high gain AVA. To 
enhance gain at lower frequencies, first slit edge technique 
is applied to conventional antipodal Vivaldi antenna 
(CAVA). Furthermore, a trapezoid dielectric lens is 
appended to improve the gain and directivity at higher 
frequencies. The dielectric lens used upsurges the end-fire 
radiations, but at the cost of a large size. Dixit et al. [18] 
proposed 1 x 4 AVA array (AVA-A) designed with 
apertures amid two antenna elements. Further performance 
of AVA-A is boosted by incorporating corrugations in it. 
The proposed AVA Array design improves the gain but 
suffers from augmented mutual coupling due to proximity 
of antenna elements. A wide-band and compact Antipodal 
Vivaldi Antenna (AVA) was proposed by Zhang et al. [19] 
for use in ultra wideband applications. To make the AVA 
smaller, an arc curve is used in place of the radiator's 
exponential tapering edge. The AVA also has a "director" 
and a "convex lens" to increase its gain at high frequencies. 
The proposed antenna has a small size and operates in the 
3.01 to 10.6 GHz frequency range but it has a drawback of 
complex design and fabrication.  Dixit et al. [20] proposed a 
1 × 4 AVA array for numerous 5G services. The proposed

antenna has a high gain and works in the frequency bands 
24–29 GHz and 30–40 GHz, respectively; nonetheless, it 
has large size due to multiple array elements. A novel 
technique was proposed by Nassar et al. [21] to improve the 
bandwidth and directivity of broad band (2 GHz - 32 GHz) 
antipodal Vivaldi antenna configuration. The technique is 
based on adding a parasitic elliptical patch to the aperture to 
increase field coupling between the arms and create 
additional radiation in the direction of the end fire, still it 
has low gain. Emre et al. [22] proposed an UWB Vivaldi 
antenna array with high gain for Synthetic Aperture Radar 
applications. First, the single element of antenna is designed 
for ultra-wide band operation in the X and Ku-band 
frequency range. Afterward, the proposed antenna is then 
shielded from surface currents by edge grooves made on the 
sides of the exponential etched patch surface.  Additionally, 
the parasitized element is supplemented to improve antenna 
gain still due to ineffective coupling, radiation properties are 
not good. Cheng et al. [23] proposed a miniaturized Vivaldi 
Antenna for Ground Penetrating Radar system. In the 
proposed design, an Artificial Materials Lens (AML) and a 
Side Lobe Suppressor (SSR) are implanted to enhance the 
gain and radiation properties of the GPR antenna. The 
higher frequency of EM waves is affected by AML, whereas 
the lower frequency of EM wave is affected by SSR but 
design is quite complex. 
 
    Amongst several techniques, the enhancement technique 
using metamaterial is quite effective without increasing the 
size of an antenna [24],[25]. After an intensive literature 
review, it is established that little work is done on AVA 
with metamaterial for SATCOM applications. This paper 
presents a compact and enhanced gain AVA with „∏‟(pi) 
shaped metamaterial for SATCOM applications. 
 
      The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section I 
covers introduction and literature review of Vivaldi antenna. 
Section II briefly discusses about Vivaldi antenna. Section 
III elaborates on the design of the proposed conventional 
AVA. Section IV deals with the design of the corrugated 
AVA.  Section V covers the design and analysis of 
corrugated AVA with the novel metamaterial unit cells. The 
simulated results of the proposed AVA are discussed in 
Section VI. Section VII deals with the fabricated design and 
measured results. The outcomes of the proposed AVA are 
concluded in Section VIII followed by references. 
 
II. 
VIVALDI ANTENNA 
 
     Vivaldi antenna is a traditional UWB antenna possessing 
wide bandwidth, high efficiency and small size. Vivaldi 
antenna‟s early design was unveiled by Gibson in 1979 [4].  
Figure 1 depicts the generalized structure of microstrip fed 
taper slot Vivaldi antenna. It is essentially a flared slotline 
that is fabricated on a single metallization layer reinforced 
by a dielectric substrate. The tapered profile conventionally 
has exponential curve that generates a smooth transition 
from the slotline to the open space. 
 
     
 
 
Figure. 1 Tapered slot Vivaldi antenna [26] 
 
     The tapered-slot antennas employ a traveling wave 
propagating along the antenna structure since the phase 
velocity is less than the velocity of light in free space. 
Therefore, they create radiation in the endfire direction at 
the broader end of the slot in preference to other directions 
[27]. 
III.  DESIGN OF CONVENTIONAL AVA (CAVA) 
 
      Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna (AVA) was first proposed 
by Gazit in 1988. It unveils superior features such as 
wideband, high gain, stable radiation pattern and easy 
fabrication and hence it can efficiently gratify the various 
requirements of SATCOM.  It consists of tapered or 
exponential metallic patches on top and bottom plane with a 
microstrip feed line matching with the connector, as shown 
in Figure 2.  
 
 
                      Figure 2. Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna [28] 
 
       Figure 3 depicts the geometry of the Conventional 
Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna (CAVA) simulated in HFSS ver. 
13. This antenna consists of two parts: elliptical curved 
radiation flares and feed line. The top and bottom patches 
act as radiator and ground, respectively. The antenna is 
designed on standard and economical substrate FR4 with a 
dielectric constant of 4.4, tan δ as 0.02 and thickness 1.6 
mm and simulated using HFSS ver. 13. As the Antipodal 
antennas operate as a resonant antenna at the lower end of 
frequency band, the antenna length L1 and width W1 are 
determined based on the lowest frequency fL, relative

dielectric constant Ɛr. The antenna dimensions are calculated 
by using the following equations [28]:     
 
               
                          L1 = 
 
  √

   √                    (2)      
                              
       
 
The curve equations are given as     
    
                  Y =                     (3) 
                                                                      
 where R1 and R2 are given by:       
                             
                   R1 =  
     
                          (4) 
 
                   R2 = 
              
         
          (5) 
                       
Here, R1 and R2 are constants, „r‟ symbolizes the increase 
rate of an exponential curve and, x1, y1, are the initial 
points and x2, y2 are the termination points of the 
exponential curve. 
 
                                    Figure 3. Structure of CAVA 
 
      The dimensions of the CAVA are calculated to have an 
optimized response over the desired bandwidth and they are 
found to be as follows: L1= 22.60 mm, L2 = 5.50 mm, L3= 
17.1 mm, W1= 15.8 mm, W2= 7.2 mm, W3= 4.2 mm. The 
width of the microstrip feedline (W4) is calculated to match 
the characteristic impedance of 50 ohm which comes out to 
be W4= 1.25 mm. The radiating structure of the antenna is 
formed from the intersection of quarters of two ellipses, as 
explained in [29]. 
 
      Figure 4 depicts the S11 response for the CAVA. From 
the curve, it can be seen that the designed CAVA resonates 
below -10 dB in the range of 10.8 GHz to more than 25 
GHz.  
 
 
Figure 4. Frequency response of CAVA 
 
     Figure 5 shows the gain for the conventional AVA 
(CAVA). It is evident from Figure 4 that CAVA achieves 
low values of gain mainly at lower frequencies with 
maximum gain of 5.8 dBi only towards higher frequency. 
 
 
 
 
                                        Figure 5. Gain plot of CAVA 
 
Since the proposed CAVA dispenses low gain at lower 
frequencies, corrugation can be used to overcome this 
problem [30]. This will be explained in detail in Section IV.      
 
IV. 
DESIGN OF CORRUGATED AVA 
 
      The low frequency performance of an AVA flare is 
enriched by the corrugation on its outer edges. Figure 6 
depicts the design of the equilateral triangular corrugated 
AVA with slot side length, S = 0.85 mm.

Figure 6. Structure of Corrugated AVA 
 
      The simulated S11 response of corrugated AVA is 
depicted in Figure 11. It can be seen that by adding 
corrugation, the lower cutoff frequency shifts to 10.3 GHz. 
The reason behind this shift in frequency is that the slot 
corrugation facilitates the electrical length of the inner taper 
profile to be elongated thereby extending the lower end cut-
off frequency [31]. Further, the corrugation acts as a high 
impedance region due to which the maximum surface 
current remains towards the inner edge of the tapered slot 
reducing side and backlobe radiation, increasing the gain in 
boresight direction [32]. 
      To further enhance the gain and improve the radiation 
characteristics, an array of metamaterial is commonly used 
on AVA aperture [33]. This will be explained in detail in 
Section V.        
          
V. DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF CORRUGATED  
 AVA WITH METAMATERIAL (MTM) 
 
       To enhance the gain and characteristics of the proposed 
Vivaldi antenna, an array of epsilon negative metamaterial 
(ENG) unit cells is supplemented at its aperture. The 
proposed „pi shape (π)‟ metamaterial is shown in Figure 7. 
The proposed MTM is placed inside a waveguide with 
Perfect Magnetic Conductors (PMC) on its top and bottom, 
Perfect Electric Conductors (PEC) on its side walls and two 
waveguide ports for excitation [34], as shown in Figure 8. 
Standard retrieving procedure is followed by using 
transmission and reflection coefficient of the unit cell, as 
described in [35], and it is found that the proposed 
metamaterial unit cell exhibits epsilon negative property, as 
shown in Figure 9. The optimized dimensions (in mm) of 
unit cell are as follows:  A = 1.6, B= 0.25, C=1.35, D = 
0.70.

Figure 8 illustrates the ENG behavior of the unit cell with 
negative relative permittivity property in range of 14 GHz - 
18 GHz.

     The MTM array was supplemented to the upper side of 
the antenna radiating aperture to augment the performance 
of the corrugated AVA. Using [36] and analyzing by 
various placements and 
numbers of the proposed 
metamaterial cells for the desired frequency range, it was 
found that the proposed design with six MTM cells at 3-2-1 
arrangement (from the top), as shown in Figure 10, attains 
the preferred bandwidth with better gain radiating maximum 
energy in the end-fire direction, as will be discussed in 
Section VI.

VI.  SIMULATED RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
      Figure 11 illustrates the simulated results of reflection 
coefficient (S11) with frequency for the corrugated AVA 
and corrugated MTM AVA.  As can be noticed from the 
figure, the reflection coefficient of the corrugated AVA is 
below -10 dB for the frequency range of 10.3 GHz to 25 
GHz. Applying the corrugation technique resulted in 
extension of the lower end frequency limit due to elongation 
of inner taper length. The negative index metamaterial 
further ameliorated the lower cut-off frequency making 
S11<-10 dB for the entire range from 10 GHz - 25 GHz.    
                                   
 
 
Figure 11. Comparison of Frequency response of Corrugated AVA and 
Corrugated MTM AVA 
 
        
 
      Figure 12 depicts the comparison of the gain plot of 
Corrugated AVA and Corrugated MTM AVA. The 
Corrugated AVA provides gain in the range of 6.5 dBi - 8.6 
dBi, whereas the AVA-M provides the gain in the range of 
7.3 dBi – 12.2 dBi with maximum gain achieved at 14.5 
GHz. As evident from the gain plot, by integrating 
corrugation on both side edges of conducting arms, the gain 
of the proposed antenna increased significantly, especially 
at the lower end of the operating frequency band. Further, 
by integrating the metamaterial unit cells structure, the gain 
enrichment is more pronounced in the mid frequency band. 
Hence, the peak gain is enhanced by approximately 3.8 dBi 
in the desired range after inclusion of metamaterial unit 
cells, which is a significant gain enhancement without 
changing the antenna size. Also, as observed from Figure 
11, the gain is maximum towards the center frequency and 
drops towards lower and higher frequencies. Since, gain is 
dependent on the matching, and it is matched at mid-
frequency ranges, therefore, it may be getting worse at 
higher and lower frequency ranges, causing a reduction in 
gain. 
 
 
 
Figure 12. Comparison of Gain of Corrugated AVA and  
Corrugated MTM AVA 
 
        
        Figure 13 and Figure 14 illustrate the simulated 
radiation patterns of the corrugated AVA and the proposed 
MTM antenna on the E-plane and H-plane at 10, 15 and 25 
GHz, respectively. It can be seen from the radiation pattern 
that loaded MTMs result in better directivity with 
improvement in gain [37] and possess enhanced radiation 
performance by suppressing the undesired side lobes [38] 
resulting in low side lobe levels.

      Thus, it is evident that the proposed antenna offers 
higher directivity, but it can be costlier due to the complex 
fabrication process. 
 
VII. FABRICATION AND MEASURED  RESULTS 
 
       To substantiate the simulated result as proposed in [1], 
the antenna is fabricated using substrate material FR4 with 
the relative dielectric constant of 4.4, tan δ = 0.02, and 
thickness of 1.6 mm. The antenna is fabricated by 
photolithographic technique [39]. The fabrication steps for 
the proposed antenna using photolithography process are 
briefly summarized: First, a computer aided design of the 
antenna geometry is made. A negative of this geometry 
printed on transparent sheet serves as the mask. Thereafter, 
a negative photo-resist film is laminated to the cleaned and 
dried copper clad substrate. The masked and photo-resist 
laminated copper clad substrate is exposed to ultra violet 
(UV) light. UV exposed photo-resist laminated copper clad 
substrate is developed.  Finally, the developed copper clad 
substrate is chemically etched by Ferric Chloride FeCl3 
solution. Figure 15 (a, b) illustrates the photograph of the 
top and bottom layer of the fabricated antenna with overall 
dimensions as 22.60  mm x 15.80 mm.

      Figure 16 depicts the simulated and measured S11 
characteristics of the proposed antenna covering the entire 
band from 10 GHz - 25 GHz. Before carrying the 
measurement, the VNA (Agilent Fieldfox) was calibrated 
with a calibration kit with a short, open and loading 
apparatus, respectively. Subsequently, after the calibration 
process, the proposed antenna was connected to the VNA, 
and 
the 
S11 
parameter 
results 
were 
obtained.

The measured return loss result displays that the proposed 
fabricated antenna achieves good impedance bandwidth 
(S11 ≤ −10 dB) from 10 to 25 GHz though there is some 
decline in measured return loss. The maximum value of S11 
lies in mid-range which is -21.4 dB at frequency of 18.2 
GHz. The discrepancy between the simulation and 
measurement may be due to ohmic and substrate loss, 
surface roughness, and fabrication errors [40] mainly 
loading of metamaterials that may introduce distortion. 
Also, insertion loss of SMA connectors may contribute to 
the discrepancy in simulated and measured result [41]. Also, 
external disturbances and adjacently placed instruments may 
also contribute to the error. 
 
 
Figure 16. Comparison of Simulated and Measured return loss 
 
 
    Figure 17 depicts the comparison of the simulated and 
measured gain of the proposed corrugated AVA with novel 
metamaterial cells. The result shows good matching 
between the simulated and measured results except some 
minor loss in the measured result. The gain depends on the 
impedance matching, and since it is matched at mid 
frequencies, the match may be getting poorer at the lower 
and higher frequencies resulting in decline in gain at lower 
and upper frequency range. The measured gain of the 
antenna varies between 6.2 dBi – 10.7 dBi over 10 GHz – 
25 GHz. 
 
 
 
 Figure 17. Comparison of simlated and measured Gain 
 
    The radiation characteristics of the proposed antenna are 
measured in the anechoic chamber and are shown in Figure 
18. Radiation Patterns [42] are graphical representations of 
the distribution of radiated energy into space as a function 
of direction. The radiation pattern has two lobes: the main 
lobe where the maximum amount of radiated energy exists 
and the side lobes or minor lobes, where the radiation is 
distributed in a sideward and backward direction. 
.  
    The AVA antenna which is antenna under test (AUT) and 
a RF transmitter system are placed at a known distance from 
the reference antenna. Horn antenna is used as the reference 
antenna, which is connected to a known receiver. The 
receiver system is employed to measure the power acquired 
by the antenna under test. A power meter to calculate the RF 
power is associated to the test antenna terminals by means 
of a co-axial cable and connectors. The positioning system 
is used to adjust the orientation of the AUT. The positioning 
system rotates the antenna under test and aids in the correct 
measurement of the AUT radiation pattern as a function of 
the angle.  
 
     Figures 18 and 19 display measured and simulated 
radiation patterns in the E and H planes at various AVA 
frequencies (10 GHz, 15 GHz, 25 GHz). As can be 
observed, the tapered slot's middle axis is where the 
maximum radiation occurs. Also, for E plane, the gain and 
HPBW increases with the frequency while for H plane it 
remains almost similar for various frequencies.  As can be 
seen, the highest gain is in mid frequency range and drops 
for very low and high frequencies. The figure depicts 
improved radiation properties of the proposed antenna with 
high directivity and low sidelobe levels.

       The results from simulation and measurement are in 
good agreement, except for slight discrepancy at higher 
frequencies caused by a fabrication error and the influence 
of the SMA connector on radiation characteristics. Hence, it 
is evident that the proposed fabricated antenna possesses 
higher directional properties with high gain. 
 
 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
 
        This paper proposes the analysis design and testing of a 
high gain corrugated AVA with novel epsilon negative 
(ENG) metamaterial. The ENG metamaterial enhances the 
reflection coefficient with a wider bandwidth from 10 to 25 
GHz without increasing the size. Further, the proposed 
corrugated MTM AVA enhances the gain by approximately 
3.8 dBi as compared to corrugated AVA in the desired 
frequency range. In this paper, first a conventional AVA 
(CAVA) is designed for desired frequency range. 
Thereafter, 
triangular 
corrugation 
is 
integrated 
and 
corrugated AVA is analyzed. Subsequently, its performance 
is further enhanced and analyzed by introducing ∏ shaped 
array of optimally placed metamaterial unit cells. 
Thereafter, the simulated design is fabricated using 
photolithography technique and the proposed fabricated 
antenna is tested for its return loss, gain and radiation 
pattern. The measured results are then compared with the 
HFSS simulated results. There is good agreement between 
simulated and measured results. The maximum gain 
achieved is approximately 10.7 dBi and antenna possesses 
high directional properties. As the proposed AVA design 
provides enhanced gain, improved return loss and 
compactness, it can be considered as a suitable candidate for 
satellite transmitter applications.
