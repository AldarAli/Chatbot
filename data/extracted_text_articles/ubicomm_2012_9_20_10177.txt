Abstract—It is only a matter of time before High Dynamic 
Range (HDR) video content becomes commercially available. It 
is necessary, therefore, to develop proper video compression 
standards that address the peculiarities of this content and 
enable the introduction of this technology to the consumer 
market.  So far there is no dedicated standard for HDR 
content. This paper investigates the performance of the 
emerging High Efficient Video Coding (HEVC) standard on 
HDR content and compares it with that of the H.264/AVC 
standard. 
Performance 
evaluations 
show 
that 
HEVC 
outperforms the H.264/AVC standard by 22.47% to 58.61% in 
terms of bitrate or 1.02 dB to 4.88 dB in terms of PSNR in the 
case of HDR content.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The human visual system is able to adapt to light 
conditions at approximately 10,000,000,000:1 contrast or 
dynamic range, and at a single time instant, human eyes can 
perceive a dynamic range at the order of 100,000:1 [1]. 
Contrary to the wide range of light intensity allowed by the 
human vision system, only a range between the order of 
100:1 to 1000:1 – known for this reason as “Low Dynamic 
Range (LDR)” - is supported by the majority of existing 
capturing and display devices. A new-generation of imaging 
systems promises to overcome this restriction by capturing 
and displaying high dynamic range (HDR) images and 
videos which contain information that covers the full visible 
luminance range and the entire color gamut [2]. 
In order to fully capture and represent the color space and 
dynamic range visible to human eyes, many solutions have 
been proposed in recent years. One solution is to combine 
multiple LDR videos captured at different exposure levels. 
Recently capturing HDR videos has become even more 
feasible, due to the availability of novel sensors that allow 
capturing multiple exposures.  
The display industry has also started to take note of the 
potential of HDR technology. In recent years important 
developments in HDR display and projection technology 
have been made. Prototypes of HDR display are built with 
dynamic ranges of well beyond 50,000:1 according to [3]. 
Moreover to ensure smooth transition from LDR to HDR 
service, the backward compatibility with current low 
dynamic range display systems has been investigated. At the 
introductory phase of HDR systems, HDR displays (that 
accept 10-bit or 12-bit signals) and LDR systems (that accept 
only 8-bit data) will coexist. Thus, the broadcasters should 
provide both LDR and HDR signals for consumers. To 
efficiently allow for this overlap, a number of tone-mapping 
operators have been developed which converts 10-bit or 12-
bit high dynamic range content to the 8-bit low dynamic 
range signal. Simple tone-mapping methods utilize the tone-
mapping curve for all the pixels in an image [4] [5]. More 
sophisticated tone-mapping algorithms consider the local 
features of each pixel and use local operators to perform tone 
reproduction [6] [7]. 
As with all HDR technologies for capture and display, 
HDR compression is a topic worth more research attention as 
it is going to enable efficient transmission of HDR video. 
The transmission of HDR content requires provisions beyond 
those used in transmission of conventional LDR content. So 
far there is no dedicated video coding standard for HDR 
content. Some of the existing video coding standards allow 
coding of LDR video content with more than 8-bits per pixel. 
These encoders are optimized to compress video content 
with the statistical distributions of LDR video with more 
detail than the traditional LDR video (the same dynamic 
range though). However, HDR content differs from LDR 
content as it uniquely has higher color bit-depth with more 
details in high intensity (brightness) as well as low intensity 
regions. Overall, this introduces 
more texture and 
information, which result in large amounts of data.  
To this day, the majority of compression efforts related to 
HDR have focused on separating HDR to a LDR stream and 
an enhancement layer both coded with existing 8-bit based 
standards [8]. This approach comes at a cost of low 
compression 
efficiency, 
but 
it 
ensures 
backward 
compatibility with the existing LDR displays, and allows 
reconstruction of the HDR content for HDR displays [6]. 
Only some very preliminary studies have been done on direct 
compression of HDR content. The method proposed in [9] 
adapts HDR signals to the JPEG-2000 coding requirements 
while the one described in [10] is developed around MPEG. 
 Among the existing video coding standards the 
H.264/AVC is the most advanced and efficient video 
compression standard (developed by the Joint Video Team 
(JVT) of the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) 
and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG)). 
Recently, the international community for standardization 
has considered a new generation of video compression 
technology, known as High Efficient Video Coding (HEVC).

This standard is offering substantially higher compression 
capability than the existing H.264/AVC standard. Current 
comparison results show that HEVC offer superior 
compression performance compared with H.264/AVC.  
The performance of the HEVC standard on HDR content 
has not been taken into account at the time of developing this 
standard and all the tests were conducted using LDR content. 
Given the difference in properties and characteristics 
between LDR and HDR content, it is important to consider 
how HEVC will perform on HDR video and from these tests 
try to identify challenges and additions or changes to the new 
standard.  
In this paper we investigate the compression performance 
of HEVC on HDR video content, to examine if HEVC has 
the potential to be used as a platform for a devoted HDR 
compression scheme. We conduct experimental tests on 
HDR content and compare the performance of HEVC with 
that of H.264/AVC standard. Comparable experiment 
settings of two codecs are introduced which could also be 
used in other similar tests. 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. 
Section II provides a brief background on the formats of 
HDR content and the specifications of high efficiency video 
coding technology, Section III presents the details of our 
experiment, Section IV discusses the results and future work 
and Section V includes conclusions.

BACKGROUND 
This section provides a brief background on the HDR 
content and the emerging high efficiency video coding 
technology. 
A. High Dynamic Range (HDR) Format 
HDR imaging offers the opportunity of capturing, 
storing, manipulating, and displaying dynamic real-world 
lighting. HDR signals preserve colorimetric or photometric 
pixel values (such as CIE XYZ) within the visible color 
gamut and allow for intra-frame contrast to reach the 
magnitude of 106:1, without introducing contouring, banding 
or posterization artifacts caused by excessive quantization. 
The photometric or colorimetric values, such as luminance 
(cd·m-2) or spectral radiance (W·sr-1·m-3), span to a much 
larger range of values than the luma and chroma values 
(gamma corrected) used in typical video encoding (JPEG, 
MPEG, etc.). In order to represent the dynamic range of 
intensities found in a real life scene, we need to use more 
than the typical 8-bits for each color. An intuitive solution is 
to represent the pixel value with floating point numbers to 
cover the larger dynamic range. One shortcoming of using 
floating-point numbers is that compression of HDR content 
becomes challenging since floating-point numbers are not 
optimal for compression compared to integer values. The 
other issue is that the precision error of floating point 
numbers varies across the full range of possible values. For 
these reasons, several file formats have originally been 
proposed for storing HDR data, including the Radiance 
RGBE (.hdr) [13], OpenEXR (.exr) [14], and LogLuv TIFF 
(.tiff) [15]. The RGBE format assigns four bytes to represent 
each pixel: one byte used for the mantissa of each of the 
RGB channels and the remaining one byte is used as a shared 
exponent. The exponent byte together with the mantissa part 
is able to represent a value of a very large range. On the 
other hand, OpenEXR spends 16 bits for each of the RGB 
channels: a sign bit, five bits for exponent and ten bits for 
mantissa. The LogLuv TIFF format represents the data in the 
logarithmic domain and supports 32 bits per pixel using one 
sign bit, 15 bits to encode the log scale of the luminance, and 
8 bits for each of the two chrominance channels. These three 
formats are considered nearly lossless and require high data 
rate. 
 
B. High Efficiancy Video Coding (HEVC) 
The recent advances in technology have made it possible 
to capture and display video material with ultra-high 
definition (UHD) resolution. To enable transmission of large 
amounts of data the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group 
(MPEG) and ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) 
established a Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding 
(JCT-VC) with the objective to develop a new high-
performance video coding standard. A formal Call for 
Proposals (CfP) on video compression technology was 
issued in January 2010, and 27 proposals were received in 
response to that call [16]. The evaluations that followed 
showed that some proposals could reach the same visual 
quality as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC High profile at only half of 
the bitrate and at the cost of two to ten times increase in 
computational complexity. Since then, JCT-VC has put a 
considerable effort towards standardization of a new 
compression technology known as the High Efficiency 
Video Coding (HEVC), with the aim to significantly 
improve the compression efficiency compared to the existing 
H.264/AVC high profile. Generally speaking, HEVC is a 
block-based compression scheme, similar to H.264/AVC, 
with some new features.  Some of the key elements of 
HEVC compared to H.264/AVC are: flexible block structure 
(recursive quad-tree partitioning and block sizes up to 64x64 
pixels), more intra prediction modes (35 in total), improved 
motion vector estimation, and different integer transforms 
allowing non-square transforms. HEVC also includes two 
new filters (Sample Adaptive Offset (SAO) and Adaptive 
Loop Filter (ALF)) to undo the distortion introduced in the 
main steps of the encoding process (prediction, transform 
and quantization) [11]. The effort for standardization of 
HEVC is still ongoing, and it is expected to be finalized by 
July 2012. So far, the objective comparison results reported 
in [11] show that the current HEVC design outperforms 
H.264/AVC by 29.14% to 45.54% in terms of bitrate or 
1.4dB to 1.87dB in terms of PSNR. Subjective comparison 
of the quality of compressed videos – for the same (linearly 
interpolated) Mean Opinion Score (MOS) points - shows that 
HEVC outperforms H.264/AVC, yielding average bitrate 
savings of 58% [12]. Note that all the reported performance 
evaluations are based on LDR content.

Conventionally, video compression techniques have 
considered only 8 bits-per-pixel (bpp) input videos, yet HDR 
videos require 10-14 bpp. The current design of HEVC 
provides the necessary capabilities to handle LDR videos of 
up to 14 bpp without clipping the bit depth during the 
encoding process. This allows us to encode HDR content 
using HEVC. However, the compression performance might 
not be optimal, since HEVC is optimized to compress video 
content with the statistical distributions of LDR video but not 
HDR video.  
III. 
EXPERIMENT 
In this paper, our objective is to test the performance of 
HEVC for compressing HDR content, and compare it with 
that of H.264/AVC. The following subsections elaborate on 
the details of our experiment.  
A. Test sequences 
For our experiment, four test sequences are selected from 
the database provided by JVT of ISO/IEC MPEG & ITU-T 
VCEG [17] [18]. These test videos are in YUV 4:2:0 format, 
with a resolution of 1080p and a frame rate of 50 fps. The 
dynamic range of two of the videos is 10 bits and that of the 
other two is 12 bits. Fig. 1 shows a snap shot of the four test 
sequences. The specifications of the test sequences are 
summarized in Table I.  
 
These test sequences have been generated form high 
dynamic range video content that was originally stored in 
floating point format and in a linear RGB space. The 
representation of the sequence was created by first 
normalizing the RGB values to the set [0, 1]. Then these 
normalized values were converted to the YCbCr format 
using the ITU-R BT.709 reference primaries. Chroma planes 
were subsampled by a factor of two in each dimension using 
the given separable filter (refer to [17] for more details). 
Finally, the resulting 4:2:0 YUV file was quantized linearly 
with a rounding operation to create the test sequences [18].  
B. HEVC configuration 
To evaluate the performance of HEVC on HDR content 
we used the High Efficiency Video Coding Test Model 5 
(HM 5.0) [19]. Note that HM 5.0 was the latest available

HEVC Test model at the time of conducting this experiment. 
To enable the highest possible compression performance, the 
Random Access High Efficiency (RA-HE) configuration is 
used in our experiment: Hierarchical B pictures, Group of 
Picture (GOP) length of 8, ALF (Adaptive Loop Filter), SAO 
(Sample Adaptive Offset) and Rate Distortion Optimized 
Quantization (RDOQ) were enabled.   In order to obtain a 
reasonable span of Rate-Distortion (RD) curves, the 
following Quantization Parameters (QPs) were used: 28, 32, 
36, and 44. QP is the parameter, which controls the 
quantization step size, and in turn decides the level of 
quantization error involved during compression. A higher 
QP value leads to a larger quantization step size and worse 
video quality. 
C. H.264/AVC configuration 
In our experiment, the performance of HEVC is 
compared with the state-of-the-art video compression 
standard H.264/AVC (JM 16.2). To accommodate HDR 
content, the configuration of H.264/AVC was set to High 
4:4:4 Profile, which accepts up to 14 bits. In our experiment 
we used hierarchical B pictures, GOP length of 8, CABAC 
entropy coding and RDOQ enabled.  These settings were 
recommended for comparing H.264/AVC to HEVC by 
MPEG/VCEG in the Joint Call for Proposals (for more 
details check the Alpha anchor in [20]). The same QP 
settings as those in the HEVC case are used for H.264/AVC.  
All the above-mentioned configuration settings were 
chosen to ensure a fair comparison between HEVC and 
H.264/AVC. However, these codecs are so different and 
have different tools and configuration options. As a result, 
aside from the necessary changes and above-mentioned 
settings, the default settings are used for the rest of available 
options.  
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
To 
evaluate 
the 
performance 
of 
HEVC 
versus 
H.264/AVC for coding HDR content, we conducted our 
experiment using the infrastructure provided in the previous 
section. Fig. 2 shows the RD curves for all the test sequences 
and Table II lists the average PSNR improvement and 
average PSNR savings achieved by HEVC over the 
H.264/AVC standard.  
As it can be observed, HEVC outperforms H.264/AVC 
by 22.47% to 58.61% in terms of bitrate (with same PSNR) 
or 1.02 dB to 4.88 dB in terms of PSNR (with same bitrate). 
Our results show that the compression efficiency of HEVC 
when applied to HDR content is dramatically higher than 
H.264/AVC and seems to follow the performance already 
witnessed for LDR content. In future work, we will include a 
new rate-distortion optimization process with HEVC that 
features an updated signal model and coding parameters 
derived specifically for HDR content. Moreover, subjective 
tests using an HDR display will be conducted to evaluate the 
performance of the two standards and the proposed schemes.

V. 
CONCULUSION 
This paper compared the performance of the current 
HEVC test model with the state of the art compression 
standard, H.264/AVC, for compressing HDR content. 
Configuration settings used for this study were chosen 
carefully to represent similar scenarios and ensure a fair 
comparison. Our experiment results show that HEVC 
outperforms H.264/AVC by 22.47% to 58.61% in terms of 
bitrate (with same PSNR) or 1.02 dB to 4.88 dB in terms of 
PSNR (for the same bitrate).  
The current progress of HEVC is proved to be promising 
and HEVC has the potential to replace H.264/AVC as the 
next state-of-the-art compression standard. Our study 
confirms that HEVC does not only offer superior 
compression performance for LDR content but also HDR 
videos. The compression improvement in the HDR case is in 
line with that of LDR. However the overall saving differs 
among different sequences (content dependent). Service 
providers could greatly benefit from HEVC due to more 
efficient use of bandwidth. It is worth mentioning that 
HEVC’s high compression performance comes at the price 
of increased coding complexity compared to H.264/AVC.  
With the rapid growth in the multimedia industry, it is 
only a matter of time before HDR videos become widespread. 
HEVC and future compression standards should be 
optimized accordingly to fully capitalize on this upcoming 
trend.
