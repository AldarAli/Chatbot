Abstract—The paper addresses the analysis of a social system
with identiﬁed groups and roles assigned to users. The important
elements of this representation of a society and its dynamics
are, on one hand, the identiﬁcation of various important users
in the whole network or in given groups, and, on the other
hand, the events describing how the groups evolved. In this
paper, we propose an approach integrating both these areas that
would allow us to draw conclusions regarding the inﬂuence of
important persons on the groups evolution and may make it
possible to predict the future of the group on the basis of its
current structure.
Keywords—roles dynamics; blogosphere; local roles.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Taking into account a dynamic growth of different forms
of social media, where users often express their opinions, it
is important to understand the behaviour of users participating
in them, identify their importance and predict directions of
evolution. For such research, the application of methods of
social network analysis became very popular. Considering
the size and dynamics of changes, such a network may be
perceived as a set of groups, within which users are more
strongly connected than with others outside the group. Ex-
amples of such connections are discussions on forums or in
blogosphere. The variety of subjects results in users belonging
to many groups and participating in them with different levels
of commitment, playing different roles in them.
Taking into consideration high dynamics of changes, an
important question is, why some groups last for a long time
and why others are more fugitive. It seems that the kinds of
activities of the users within groups may have an inﬂuence
on the duration of the groups. In this paper, we extend
our algorithm for the analysis of the evolution of groups in
blogosphere [1], [2] by including role identiﬁcation in groups
[3] and analysis of their evolution.
The organisation of the rest of the paper is as follows.
In Section 2, the related works about group extraction and
dynamics as well as identiﬁed roles of users are presented.
Section 3 shows the model of the group dynamics, role
identiﬁcation and introduced R-SGCI method. In Section 4, the
data set and performed experiments are described. Section 5
concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK
A. Groups extraction
One of the important problems in the analysis of social
networks is the identiﬁcation of the groups constituted by
strongly connected nodes in the graph. Many algorithms were
proposed so far and it is possible to organise them using
different classiﬁcation rules. One classiﬁcation detects either
non–overlapping or overlapping groups. The signiﬁcant exam-
ple of the algorithm which extracts ovelapping groups is the
Clique Percolation Method (CPM), based on the identiﬁcation
of k-cliques [4]. The CPM algorithm is also used in the
works presented in this paper. Other examples of overlapping
approaches are solutions proposed by Shen et al. [5] and
Gregory [6]. Examples of solutions working on non–ovelaping
communities are algorithms proposed by Girvan and Newman
[7] or Blondel et al. [8]. The wider overview of the group
identiﬁcation methods may be found in [9] [10].
B. Dynamics of groups
A typical way of analysing dynamic network is to divide
the whole network into a series of static snapshots (called
time slots or time steps). Greene et al. [11] presented a
general strategy of analysis of dynamics of groups. Firstly,
in each time slot the groups are extracted, and then groups
from neighbouring slots are matched – it is performed by
calculating Jaccard index between these groups and if the value
of such a measure is above a predeﬁned threshold, it means
that the groups are matched. We [1] proposed Stable Group
Changes Identiﬁcation (SGCI) algorithm, which contains some
improvements over earlier mentioned approaches. Instead of
Jaccard index, we deﬁned a new measure which has better
properties in terms of matching groups with different sizees
(Jaccard index is not well-suited for matching groups with
signiﬁcantly different sizes, because in such case the threshold
should be very low and, at the same time, very low threshold
applied to groups with very similar size could result in those
groups being very big and the number of common members
is very low, which is not the desired effect).
Another approach to analyse the dynamics of groups is
presented in [12] and it is based on the use of CPM algorithm
for group extraction. The ﬁrst step is also ﬁnding communities
in each time slot, but the process of matching groups from
neighbouring time slots is quite different. For each consecutive
time steps t and t + 1, the joint graph is built (the union of
graphs from these 2 time steps). Next, in such joint graphs
the groups are extracted and if a group from t time slot and
a group from t + 1 time slot are contained inside the same
group in the joint graph, it is assumed that these groups are
matched.
Another important aspect is the identiﬁcation of events
that can occur in the group lifecycle. The set of events
varies in different methods. Palla et al. [12] identiﬁed some
basic events that can happen to a group: growth, contraction,
merging, splitting, birth and death. Takaffoli et al. [13] used
only 5 events: form, dissolve, survive, split and merge, but
they additionally labelled transitions between groups as: size

transition (group shrinks or group expands), compactness
transition (group becomes more compact or more diffused),
persistence transition (number of nodes and edges in group
does not change), leader transition (when the node with the
highest centrality in group does change).
C. Roles
One of the most popular deﬁnition of roles is that given
by Wasserman in [14], where a role is identiﬁed as a position
that has a distinct pattern of relations to other positions. Gleave
in [15] distinguished two main methodological approaches to
ﬁnding roles: interpretative and structural. Interpretative anal-
yses employs methods such as etnography, content analysis,
and surveys to capture behaviors and relations within groups.
Structural analysis uses Social Network Analysis (SNA) and
assumes that role entails a speciﬁc structural position. The
most general approach to ﬁnding roles consists of two main
stages [16]: understanding the community in order to identify
potential roles, and then the creation of a role with observed
characteristics and rules that will allow the classiﬁcation of
individuals into the pre-deﬁned roles. One can distinguish
several approaches for identifying social roles. The oldest
one is based on equivalence classes [14], where the most
appropriate is regular equivalence. Another approach is based
on the identiﬁcation of the core and periphery structure [17]
where role is assigned based on membership of a particular
area. In approach based on clustering feature vectors, each
person is represented by a vector of some of the features
that represents its behavior and relationships with the other
members of the community and such vector can be clustered
[16], so that people with similar characteristics are placed in
one group.

MODEL
A. Dynamics of groups
A common approach to analyse dynamic networks is to
divide the whole range of time into smaller periods (called
time slots or time steps) and, then, in each time slot the static
network is analysed.
For experiments we employed SGCI method [1] to analyse
the dynamics of groups. The method is composed of four
stages: identiﬁcation of short-lived groups in each separated
time interval, identiﬁcation of group continuation, separation
of the stable groups (lasting for a certain time interval) and the
identiﬁcation of types of group changes (transition between the
states of the stable group).
Step 1. In each time slot the groups are extracted (such
groups are called fugitive groups). Any method of group
ﬁnding can be used for that purpose (in this paper we utilized
the CPM method).
Step 2. In this step, the algorithm identiﬁes transition
between groups observed at time t and the groups observed
at time t+1 (their successors). Identiﬁcation is performed
by calculating the Modiﬁed Jaccard Measure (A and B are
examined groups from neighbouring time slots):
MJ(A, B) =
(
0,
if A = ∅ ∨ B = ∅,
max( |A∩B|
|A| , |A∩B|
|B| ),
otherwise.
(1)
and if the calculated value is above a deﬁned threshold (in
experiments we assumed the value equals 0.5) and the ratio of
groups size
ds(A, B) = max( |A|
|B|, |B|
|A| )
(2)
is no more than a speciﬁed value (in tests we used value
equals 50), then group B is considered as continuation of the
group A.
Step 3. In this step, the algorithm retrieves the stable
groups. The stable groups are groups that exist in the required
number of consecutive time slots – the groups which are not
stable are rejected. In experiments such a number was equal
to 3.
Step 4. Transitions between groups from neighbouring
time steps are labelled by event names that describe a type
of occuring change between groups. In the algorithm the
following events are deﬁned (A is the source group and B is
the target group in analysed transition; sh and dh are deﬁned
thresholds which were set in experiments to values 10 and 0.05
respectively):
•
split takes place when a group divides into some
groups that do not differ considerably (in terms of
group size) from the predecessor group:
|A|
|B| < sh,
(3)
•
deletion occurs when a group disintegrates into some
successor groups and in analysed transition successor
group is much smaller than the predecessor group
|A|
|B| ≥ sh,
(4)
•
merge happens when many predecessor groups form
a successor group in the next time slot and the former
groups have size that do not differ signiﬁcantly from
the size of the successor group
|B|
|A| < sh,
(5)
•
addition occurs when several groups from the previ-
ous time slot create a group in the next time slot and
in analysed transition the origin group is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the successor group
|B|
|A| ≥ sh,
(6)
•
decay takes place when groups do not exist in the next
time slot,
•
constancy means simple transition with very small
change of the group size
abs(|A| − |B|)
|A|
≤ dh,
(7)
•
change size – simple transition with signiﬁcant
change of group size.

B. Roles in groups
Users can play different roles on a global level and different
ones in each of the group they belong to. In this paper we focus
on roles deﬁned on a local level – the level of group. The set
of roles we use for analysis in this paper, was proposed by us
in [3] and the roles were described there in detail.
We differentiated two kinds of inﬂuential people: (i) selﬁsh
ones who focus on building only their own position – they
comment mostly in their own threads (ii) social ones who also
take part in discussions started by other bloggers and comment
on their posts.
The roles presented take into account responses from other
users on the content the user writes (both in the form of posts
and comments). To meet this assumption, we deﬁned Post and
Comment Inﬂuence .
Post Inﬂuence for author a has the following form (in
this deﬁnition we use the notation c(X, cond) that means the
number of elements in X that every element of X fulﬁlls
condition cond):
PostInfa = 4 · c(pa, pr ≥ Ap) + 2 · c(pa, pr ≥ Ap/2)
+c(pa, pr ≥ Ap/4) − 2 · c(pa, pr < 1)
(8)
where pa – posts of author a; pr – number of comments
for a given post excluding the author’s comments in his own
thread; Ap = 10 · groupDensity · groupSize
Comment Inﬂuence for author a is calculated in the follow-
ing way (in this deﬁnition we use the notation w(cond) that
returns 1 when the condition cond is satisﬁed, otherwise – 0):
ComInfa = 4 · w(ra ≥ 1.25) + 2 · w(ra ≥ 1)
+w(ra ≥ 0.75) − w(cra < Dc) − 2w(cra < Dc/2)
−4 · w(cra < Dc/4)
(9)
where r is the the number of received comments from other
users divided by the number of written comments by given
authors;cr is a number of reiceved comments from other users;
Dc = groupSize · groupDensity.
To deﬁne roles we need also another measure ComEgo
which is a ratio between comments written in own threads
and all comments written by a given user.
Using the above deﬁnitions we can describe the set of roles:
1)
Inﬂuential User (infUser): PostInf
>
2 and
ComInf > 0
a)
Selﬁsh Inﬂuential User: ComEgo ≥ 0.75
b)
Social Inﬂuential User: ComEgo < 0.75
2)
Inﬂuential Blogger (infBlog): PostInf
> 2 and
ComInf ≤ 0
a)
Selﬁsh Inﬂuential Blogger: ComEgo ≥ 0.75
b)
Social Inﬂuential Blogger: ComEgo < 0.75
3)
Inﬂuential Commentator (infComm): ComInf > 0
and PostInf ≤ 2
4)
Standard Commentator (comm): c(comments) ≥ 20
and c(posts) ≤ 2
5)
Not
Active
(notActive):
c(posts)
<
1
and
c(comments) < 2
6)
Standard Blogger (stdBlog): User that does not match
to any from above roles.
The above parameters were adjusted by us by testing with
different values of them, comparing obtained results and ﬁnally
verifying them using knowledge about bloggers.
C. Method of group dynamics analysis based on local roles
We introduced R-SGCI – modiﬁed version of SGCI algo-
rithm that takes into account roles played by users in groups.
It has additional condition enforcing passing inﬂuential roles
between groups if they are present in the predecessor group:
RM(A, B) =
(
|R(A,Inf)∩|A∩B||
R(A,Inf)
,
if R(A, Inf) > 0,
1,
otherwise.
(10)
where R(A, Inf) is a number of users in group A with in-
ﬂuential roles. In experiments, we rejected transitions between
groups when the value of RM was equal to 0 - it means that
if the predecessor group has any users with inﬂuential roles
then at least one of them should be present in the successor
group.

DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENTS
A. Data set
The examined data set contains data collected from the
portal salon24.pl, where discussions mostly concern political
topics. The data set consists of 26 722 users (11 084 of them
have their own blog), 285 532 posts and 4 173 457 comments
within the period 1.01.2008 - 31.03.2012. The experiments
described were carried out on half of this dataset - from
4.04.2010 to 31.03.2012. The whole period was divided into
time slots, each lasting 7 days and neighboring slots overlap
each other by 4 days. In the analysed period there are 182 time
slots. In every slot the comments model was used, introduced
by us in [18] - the users are nodes and relations between
them are built in the following way: from user who wrote the
comment to the user who was commented on or if the user
whose comment was commented on is not explicitly referenced
in the comment (by using @ and name of author of comment)
the target of the relation is the author of post.
B. Groups and evolution events
In each time slot, the groups were extracted by CPM
method – CPMd version from CFinder tool [19], for k equals
5. For group evolution we used the SGCI method (described
in section III-A).
Fig. 1 shows the summary of groups with different sizes.
As we can see, the most numerous part of all groups are the
groups with the size equal to 5.
Fig. 2 presents the number of evolution events in the
analysed data set. The most popular ones are additions and
deletions, which occur when small groups attach to or detach
from, respectively, a much larger group. As we could observe
in Fig. 1, the smallest groups are the most numerous and due
to their small size it is quite easy to ﬁnd them matching with
larger groups, so this could explain the huge number of these
events.

C. Local roles
Table I shows how big a part of all users having a given
role in group is present in a group in the consecutive time
slot. The difference is most visible in the value of median for
roles. During transitions in group evolution the people with
the most important roles (Inﬂuential Bloggers and Inﬂuential
Users) almost in every case are also active in the successor
group.

D. Local roles in transitions between groups
Fig. 3 shows the number and proportion of roles that users
have (summed roles in all transitions) when they pass to any
group in the next time slot. One can notice that Commentators
and Standard Bloggers outnumber other roles. Inﬂuential roles
constitute less than 10% of all roles.
Fig. 3.
Local roles passing between groups.
Fig. 4 shows that different roles have different stability i.e.
proportion of all cases that a user with a given role in a group
will have the same role in a group in the consecutive time slot.
The most stable roles are Commentator and Standard Blogger –
they rarely become important users. Selﬁsh roles have higher
stability than social ones – selﬁsh users only maintain their
own threads. Moreover, Inﬂuential Blogger Selﬁsh has higher
stability than Inﬂuential User Selﬁsh and Inﬂuential Blogger
Social than Inﬂuential User Social. We can explain this sit-
uation that it takes more effort to play Inﬂuential User role
than Inﬂuential Blogger (apart from writing inﬂuential posts,
Inﬂuential Users have to also write inﬂuential comments), so
it is harder to hold their roles.
Fig. 4.
Stability of roles passing between groups.
Table II describes the transitions between roles i.e. number
of occurences that a user with the ﬁrst role (rows in the
table) in a group was present in a group in the consecutive
time slot and in that group the user has the second role
(columns in the table). We can notice that Commentators and
Standard bloggers mostly, after passing to another group, have
the same role. Inﬂuential Commentators in the majority of
cases also pass with the same role, but also quite large part
has roles of Commentator or Standard Blogger (which have
weaker conditions). Inﬂuential Blogger Selﬁsh moves with the
same role and also signiﬁcant part of users with that role
76

became Standard Bloggers in groups in the next time slot.
Inﬂuential Blogger Social passes mostly to Standard Blogger
role, but also a large part of them to Inﬂuential Blogger Social
and Commentators. Inﬂuential User Selﬁsh often becomes
Standard Blogger, Inﬂuential Blogger Selﬁsh or Inﬂuential
User Selﬁsh. Inﬂuential User Social proceeds to role Standard
Blogger, and, less, to roles Inﬂuential Blogger Social and
Inﬂuential User Social. In these transitions some more general
observations can be formulated:
•
most roles, except Commentators and Inﬂuential Com-
mentators, pass in most cases to Standard Blogger
•
social users, to a large degree, also transfer to social
users and selﬁsh users to selﬁsh users
•
Inﬂuential Users (Selﬁsh and Social) proceed, in
almost the same way, to Inﬂuential Bloggers and
Inﬂuential Users, but Inﬂuential Bloggers – only to
Inﬂuential Bloggers.
E. Stability of local roles in evolution events
During experiments it seemed that the overall role stability
for different events was very high and does not differ signif-
icantly. We looked into detail and it was caused by the fact
that the most numerous roles are Commentator and Standard
Blogger and they have very high stability for all events, as can
be seen in Table III.
Table III presents how many times a user with a given role
has the same role in any group in the next time slot for different
evolution events and shows how often such a case took places
in relation to all transitions of a given role in given event.
We can observe that in each event the roles Commentator
and Standard Blogger dominate over other ones (in terms of
keeping their position). Inﬂuential Users frequently hold their
role for simple transitions between groups – change size and
constancy. Inﬂuential Bloggers often play the same role when
the transition is one of following types: change size, constancy,
merge and split.
F. Method of analysis of group dynamics with local roles
In this section we discuss results obtained with R-SGCI
method. In Fig. 5, we can observe that the number of groups
differs slightly between the original method (SGCI) and the
modiﬁed one (R-SGCI). Differences are only in the number
of small groups.
Fig. 6 presents the number of events that are obtained
using both methods. The biggest difference is in the number
of deletion events. It means that if a large group contains
inﬂuential people and small group detaches from it (deletion
event), then in most cases (around 2/3 of cases) the smaller
group does not contain inﬂuential people.
In Table IV, there is a comparison of density and stability
measure for groups acquired by both methods. Decreasing
number of events (especially deletion event) and reducing
number of small events explains increasing stability (weak
events, such as deletion event, lower stability) and decreasing
density (small groups are usually signiﬁcantly more densier
than larger ones).

V.
CONCLUSION
In the paper, the model of the social system with stable
groups and roles is presented and a set of experiments was
performed. The obtained results allow us to better understand
behaviour of groups. The majority of the identiﬁed roles are
less signiﬁcant roles and we assume that only important roles
(inﬂuential users, inﬂuential bloggers or inﬂuential commen-
tators) have inﬂuence on group evolution. Generally, types of
important roles (social, selﬁsh) are preserved and passed to
new groups in the next time period. One can also notice that
a presence of inﬂuential roles signiﬁcantly increases chances
of groups lasting.
Future works may follow in several directions. The ﬁrst is
to analyse how the leaving of signiﬁcant roles from groups
inﬂuences the leaving of other group members. The second
is an attempt to improve prediction methods taking into
consideration important roles belonging to the group. We also
plan to conduct experiments on other datasets.
