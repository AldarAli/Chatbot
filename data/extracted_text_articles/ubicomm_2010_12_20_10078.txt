Abstract—The next generation of wireless communication will 
be characterized by heterogeneity. One of the challenges arisen 
is access selection among various radio access technologies. 
Meanwhile, the quality of experience (QoE) of user is becoming 
one of the most concerned topics. Analytic Hierarchy Process 
(AHP) has been popularly used in network selection, while this 
method is usually imprecise because consistency index in AHP 
does not accurately indicate users’ perception. In order to deal 
with this problem as well as optimize the system performance, 
an effective fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process scheme for 
network selection is proposed in this paper, which takes the 
multiple criterions of quality of experience (QoE) into 
consideration. By introducing the fuzzy consistency, the 
performance of the proposed scheme is consistent with user 
preferences and experiences. The fuzzy AHP derives relative 
weights from consistent fuzzy comparison matrices, which 
eliminates both additional consistency test and modification for 
the comparison matrix. Simulation results are analyzed in 
aspects of session quality, availability and instantaneity, and it is 
indicated 
that the proposed 
scheme 
outperforms the 
traditional AHP method and load balancing oriented method.

INTRODUCTION 
Motivated by the ever-increasing demand for wireless 
communications, the past few years has witnessed rapid 
development of varies of wireless networks. It is widely 
accepted that heterogeneity will be a prominent feature of 
the next-generation wireless system.  
While heterogeneous networks bring multi-access 
benefit, new challenges also emerge as how to achieve 
orderly and efficient cooperation across heterogeneous radio 
networks. Furthermore, the mobile multimedia services are 
expected as the most promising killer-applications for the 
next generation wireless systems. As the prime criterion for 
quality evaluation of multimedia applications, quality of 
experience (QoE) becomes important to network (service) 
providers in order to reduce user churn and maintain, and it 
has been well studied in both the academia and industrial 
community [1-3]. For QoE, it comprises all elements of an 
end user’s perception of using a service or product. QoE not 
only covers end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) parameters 
such as coverage, throughput, delay, jitter, bit error rate 
(BER) and so on, but also contains user preference 
criterions such as cost, mean of score (MOS), mobility, etc. 
Therefore, an essential issue in heterogeneous radio 
environments is how to select the most appropriate network 
according to QoE evaluations including user preference, 
network capability and service characteristics. 
Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been applied in 
many fields, such as network selection and satisfaction 
evaluation [4]. The relative importance of factors and sub-
factors with respect to their parents are estimated through 
pair-wise comparison based on human’s knowledge and 
experiences. In spite of its popularity, the method is often 
criticized for its inability to precisely represent human 
perception, the main reason for this imprecision lies in the 
inconsistent comparison matrices. As a result, AHP requires 
additional test of comparison matrix’s consistency to avoid 
the violation of common sense that “A is more important 
than B, B is more important than C, however C is more 
important than A”. However, problems still exist due to the 
fact that consistency index in AHP is not accurately 
consistent with user preference.  
This paper proposes a fuzzy AHP (FAHP) scheme for 
network 
selection 
based 
on 
QoE 
evaluation 
in 
heterogeneous scenarios. In order to deal with the problem 
mentioned above and effectively capture the ambiguity in 
user requirements, fuzzy complementary matrix and fuzzy 
consistent matrix are introduced to relax the consistency 
requirement in conventional AHP. Then relative weights are 
deduced based on FAHP theory without consistency test and 
modification to the judgment matrix. According to [5], 
several key quality indicators (KQIs) are chosen in this 
paper to reflect the degree of QoE, including availability, 
session quality, and instantaneity. Meanwhile, a number of 
key performance indicators (KPIs) are account for each KQI 
as its subcategories. Therefore, the FAHP procedure will be 
implemented in double-layer assessments, and then gives 
performance ranking of all the networks. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The system 
model and framework for the proposed network selection is 
studied in Section II. The detail process of FAHP is 
presented in Section III. A scenario in heterogeneous 
networks and simulation results are shown in Section IV. 
Finally, the conclusion is given in Section V. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL AND FRAMEWORK 
In the typical scenario of heterogeneous radio system, 
several radio access technologies (RATs) are deployed and 
different RATs may overlap with each other. These 
networks are diverse in capabilities of data rates, mobility, 
coverage, charging mechanisms, etc. For the mobile user, all

As shown in Figure 1, the resource assessment is 
decomposed into hierarchical levels. Several typical KQIs

KPIs are listed as sub-factors with respect to the upper layer 
KQIs.

A. KQIs  and KPIs 
Session Quality, Availability and Instantaneity are 
considered as the three typical KQIs in this paper. Each KQI 
is described as follows [5]. 
 
Session Quality—It represents the collective effect 
of performances that mainly concern with the 
definition of the service. A common metric of 
session quality is the Mean Opinion Score (MOS). 
Besides, objective performance indicators are also 
included: delay, BER and jitter. Thus the degree of 
session quality is achieved by a composite of 
objective and subjective parameters. 
 
Availability—The service availability is expressed 
as a percentage of time during which the service is 
available and the customer has the ability to use the 
service. It relates to the maintainability performance 
during the service and the charge cost of the service. 
Mean time between failure (MTBF) is used as a 
important metric for multimedia service quality. 
Besides, cost-effectiveness and mobility are also 
considered. 
 
Instantaneity—It 
refers 
to 
the 
punctuality  
performance of the service. The more prompt 
service delivery is, the high grade of instantaneity is, 
especially for real time services. The instantaneity 
assessment should include MOS, delay and jitter. 
B. Framework of network selection 
Figure 2 shows the block diagrams of network selection 
based on QoE evaluation. The whole FAHP system is 
divided into three parts: sub-category estimator, weights 
estimator and overall-category estimator, all of which 
coordinate with each other to give the ranking of network 
alternatives. 
Suppose that QoE assessment is decomposed into N 
aspects. Then for,

the three parts of network selection are introduced based on

Weights estimator is used to deduce the relative 
weights of KPIs and KQIs based on FAHP theory. 
According 
to 
user

in

requirements, the relative weights of KPIs for th

stands for 
relative weights of different KQIs. The KQI weights and 
KPI weights are then distributed to overall-category 
estimator and sub-category estimator, respectively. 
All KPI measures of each KQI are collected in the sub-
category estimator. Meanwhile the desirable KPI measures 
and weights are obtained from QoE requirements. Fuzzy 
rating of each aspect is represented by a closeness 
coefficient based on the TOPSIS (Technique for Order 
Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). According to the 
concept of TOPSIS, the positive ideal solution (PIS) and 
the negative ideal solution (NIS) will be defined as 
i

G and 
i
G
, respectively [6]. Then the sub-category estimator 
calculates the distance of each alternative from PIS and NIS, 
which are denoted as d  and d   respectively. In this paper, 
the distances are defined as (1) based on vector norms, since 
it can be proved that the vector norms satisfy the monotonic 
property required by TOPSIS method.

candidate networks will be ranked and the best one can be 
selected.  
III. 
DESIGN OF FUZZY AHP 
To relax the consistency requirement in conventional 
AHP, fuzzy consistent matrix is introduced, which is well 
consistent with user’s perception and meanwhile can capture 
the ambiguity in user requirements. 
A. Basic concepts  
Definition 2.1. [7] For the fuzzy matrix 
(
mn )
N N
r

R 
, if 
1
mn
nm
r
 r

 for any integer m and n, then R is a fuzzy 
complementary matrix. 
Definition 2.2. [7] For the fuzzy complementary matrix 
(
mn )

R 
, if 
0.5
mn
mk
nk
r
r
r



 for any integer m, n, k 
given at random, then R is a fuzzy consistent matrix.  
For a given user, the element 
rmn
 is a fuzzy membership 
in that criterion m is more important than criterion n 
according to their contribution to the upper layer criterions. 
When one criterion compares to itself, it is expressed as 
0.5 .
rmm

 According to definition 2.2, the inherent 
consistency of fuzzy consistent matrices can be proved by 
Theorem 1. 
Theorem 1: For any fuzzy consistent matrix R described in 
definition 2.2, R  satisfies the consistency requirement by 
user perception. Suppose m is more important than n, and n 
is more important than k, then m is more important than k.  
Proof: For different criterions m, n, k, if m is more 
important than n, and n is more important than k, then we 
have 
0.5
rmn

and
0.5 .
rnk

According to definition 2.2, 
0.5
mn
mk
nk
r
r
r



, then 
0.5
0.5
mk
mn
nk
r
r
r




. Hence, it 
is true that m is more important than k, which is consistent 
with user’s common sense of consistency. 
B. Fuzzy AHP process  
Step 1: Construct pair-wise comparison matrices 
It is required that the comparison matrices constructed is 
fuzzy consistent. As shown in Table I, comparison matrices 
can be obtained from pair-wise comparison, which is 
conducted similarly as the nine-point scale used in AHP. 
For KPI level, the consistent matrix is denoted as (4). 
 
(
mn )
N N
p

P 
 
(4) 
Step 2: Calculate relative weights 
Relative importance of each criterion is derived from 
consistent matrices. Since element 
pmn
 in P  is the result of 
importance comparison between sub-factors m and n, 
pmn
 is 
supposed to be a function of 
m
w and
n
w . The following 
theorem gives the detailed function expression. 
Theorem 2: 
(

P 
 is a fuzzy complementary matrix. 
Then P  is a fuzzy consistent matrix if and only if

Step 3: Closeness coefficient calculation  
When all N-aspect measures are collected in the sub-
category estimator, the fuzzy rating of each aspect is 
represented by a closeness coefficient based on the TOPSIS. 
Before calculating the closeness coefficient, the input 
measures need to be normalized in two situations, larger-

According to the concept of TOPSIS, the closeness 
coefficient for each aspect is calculated as (1-2) based on 
relative weights. 
Step 4: Overall estimation and decision making  
Similar to the sub-category estimation, both pair-wise 
comparison and relative weights construction are necessary 
in KQI-level estimation. With respect to different user, KQI 
preference may totally different. As to the KQI comparison 
matrices, it is denoted as

SIMULATION AND RESULTS ANALYSIS 
A. 
Simulation scenario  
Four wireless access networks are considered: WiMAX, 
WCDMA, WLAN1, and WLAN2. The pilots or the beacons 
of all reachable networks are transmitted periodically. 
Therefore, measurements criterions listed in Figure 1 can be 
always obtained by FAHP system for decision making. The 
subjective MOS value is calculated based on the R–factor 
model defined in [8]. MTBF can be deduced from system 
reliability model using basic reliability equations [9]. In the 
implementation scenario, three types of services are 
considered for simulation: VoIP, FTP and video, with 
Poisson arrival rates 
  0.6, 0.5, 0.6
 respectively. In order 
to check the scheme’s performance under heavy load, it is 
assumed that the serving rate (or the departure rate) of the 
system 
is 
smaller 
than 
arrival 
rate, 
which 
are 
  0.4, 0.3, 0.4
 for VoIP, FTP and video,  respectively.  
Besides, two other schemes are given as comparisons to 
evaluate the performance of the proposed FAHP scheme, 
which are named as AHP scheme and load balance scheme, 
respectively. Load balance is a technique to distribute 
workload evenly across different RATs. In the simulation, 
load balance is realized by utilizing the network with the 
lightest load. Therefore this scheme improves global 
resource utilization by reducing regional congestion.  
B. 
Simulation results and further study 
Figure 3(a) shows the total revenue of the heterogeneous 
system in terms of GSI. The revenue upper bound achieved 
by load balance scheme is about 112. The AHP has a better 
performance with GSI upper bound at about 120, another 
considerable gain is achieved by the new proposed scheme, 
which has an upper bound at about 145, and the 
improvement becomes more obvious with increasing of 
arrival users. Compared to the previous two algorithms, 
FAHP expands network assessment from currently single 
layer to double layers. More importantly, fuzzy consistency 
concept is included in FAHP, which helps overcome the 
weakness of AHP in consistency and therefore makes 
reasonable decisions. Hence, the new proposed mechanism 
can find out the actual most appropriate network according 
to user-specific QoE requirements. Although AHP scheme 
takes multi-criterions into consideration, it is imprecise 
because consistency index in AHP does not accurately 
indicate user’s perception. Consequently, system revenue 
degrades due to the mismatch between network capability 
and user services.   
As indicated in Figure 3(b), the proposed scheme has the 
lowest reject ratio. Especially when the system is in heavy 
load situation, FAHP proves robustness due to its well 
“understanding” of the network situation. Therefore, the 
proposed scheme has a considerable gain of user number at 
the same level of reject ratio, especially when the system 
bears a heavy load. 
In Figure 3(c), it depicts the comparison of reject ratio 
when using different parameter  . As analysis given in 
Section III, when 
 1
, the difference in relative 
importance is blurred. Therefore, network selection is 
executed passively and user service will not be rejected

easily. The larger   is chosen, the user is more sensitive to 
the relative importance of all factors.   
Therefore, different strategies are implemented by 
choosing different   and  . Under different circumstances 
they are adjust to upgrade the overall revenue. When there 
exists a network connection for the user, then a passive 
access strategy is adopted to avoid unnecessary vertical 
handoff. That means small   and   are chosen to make the 
user less sensitive to relative importance of factors. Then, 
vertical handoff is not worth, since the potential revenue 
improvement may not be able to compensate the cost caused 
by traffic handoff. The detail of this point will be studied in 
near future. 
V. 
CONCLUTION 
In this paper, an effective network selection scheme 
considering multiple QoE criterions is proposed to meet the 
challenges of multimedia applied in heterogeneous radio 
environments. For the sake of QoE evaluation, this scheme 
decomposes 
heterogeneous 
resource 
evaluation 
into 
multidimensional aspects, which are represented by KQIs. 
Meanwhile several KPIs are taken into account for each 
KQI, including both objective and subjective criterions. 
Then a fuzzy AHP system is designed for QoE reasoning 
and then gives performance ranking of all the network 
alternatives. Numerical results show that the proposed 
scheme outperforms the conventional AHP scheme and the 
load balance scheme.
