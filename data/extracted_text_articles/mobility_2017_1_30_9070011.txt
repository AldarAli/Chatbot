Abstract—Reliability, Context awareness and Energy efficiency 
are some of the most important requirements for Wireless 
Body Area Networks (WBANs). The proposed architecture for 
WBANs puts together a Media Access Control (MAC) 
protocol, a Transport Protocol and a Rate Control scheme 
proposed in our previous work. It proposes the use of three 
extra bits within each beacon period for indicating whether the 
hub is going to assign new slot Reallocations to the nodes, to 
request for lost packet Retransmissions from the nodes, to send 
Rate-control requests to the nodes, or any combination of 
them. Some experimental results are presented in order to 
validate the requirements and a comparison with other 
architectures is made using the main detected requirements for 
WBANs. 
Keywords–reliability; context awareness; energy efficiency; 
congestion control; loss recovery, WBAN architecture. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Information collected from body sensors in a WBAN is 
sent to a hub or coordinator, which processes the information 
and can also perform other functions, such as managing body 
events, merging data from sensors, sensing other parameters, 
performing the functions of a user interface and bridging the 
WBAN to higher-level infrastructure and other stakeholders. 
The IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area 
Networks - Part 15.6: Wireless Body Area Networks (2012) 
specifies short-range and wireless communications in the 
vicinity of, or inside a human body (although it is not limited 
to humans). It categorizes WBAN applications into medical 
and non-medical [1]. Some examples of medical applications 
might be: sleep staging, diabetes control and monitoring of 
cardiovascular diseases. Some examples of non-medical 
applications might be: entertainment, sports and military 
operations. 
The design of a WBAN implies the tackle of several 
challenges. Among the most important challenges, we can 
find: (i) the energy efficiency of the whole network, which 
may require new MAC protocols, new routing protocols and 
new energy scavenging sources; (ii) the consideration of the 
impact of data loss, which may require additional measures 
in order to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS); (iii) the 
reliability of the network to grant accuracy and to guarantee 
on-time delivery of data; (iv) the context awareness for 
responding according to the current situation in the network. 
The objective of this paper is to design an architecture for 
WBANs, which tries to tackle these main challenges. The 
architecture will be composed of three main components: (i) 
A context-aware and energy-efficient mechanism for 
providing QoS in WBANs; (ii) A reliable and energy-
efficient mechanism to provide packet loss recovery and 
fairness in WBANs; and (iii) A context-aware rate control 
scheme to provide congestion control in WBANs. 
Sports WBANs have a different behavior compared to 
other WBANs. In a Sports WBAN, most of the packets are 
periodic with a small portion of emergency packets that need 
to be delivered with low latency. A reliable, context-aware 
and energy-efficient architecture for WBANs used in sports 
applications is proposed, facing four challenges: energy 
efficiency, context awareness, QoS and reliability. 
Several architectures for WBANs have been proposed 
recently in the literature. Some of them are mentioned in 
Section II. The requirements of the proposed architecture are 
summarized in Section III. Section IV presents all the 
protocols and schemes, the general and the node 
architectures, the global topology, the phases in the beacon 
period, and the node behavior. Some experimental results are 
presented in Section V for demonstrating the requirements 
accomplishment. A comparison of some architectures with 
the proposed architecture is made in the Section VI. Section 
VII presents the conclusion and future work. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Wang et al. [2] have proposed a configurable quantized 
compressed sensing (QCS) architecture, in which the 
sampling rate and quantization configuration are explored 
together for improving the energy efficiency. A rapid 
configuration algorithm has been developed to locate the 
optimal configuration of the sampling rate and the bit 
resolution, always monitoring low energy consumption, 
reducing the elapsed time while keeping an excellent 
efficiency and capacity. However, loss recovery was not 
mentioned. 
In the following references, energy efficiency was not 
contemplated. Felisberto et al. [3] proposes a WBAN 
architecture to recognize human movement, identify human 
postures and to detect harmful activities in order to prevent 
risks. The architecture proposal comprises five basic 
components. (i) Sensor node – responsible for acquiring data 
of inertial and physiological sensors and transmitting them to 
the Coordinator node. (ii) Coordinator node – responsible for 
serving as a forwarder of data gathered by the Sensor nodes. 
(iii) Gateway node – it is the interface between the WBAN

and the network that provides the Internet connection. (iv) 
Mobile node – an alternative interface used when the 
Gateway Node or Internet connection are not available. (v) 
Control center – responsible for the registration and post 
processing of the motion events sent by the Sensor nodes. 
Almashaqbeh et al. [4] have proposed a Cloud-based 
real-time remote Health Monitoring System (CHMS) for 
tracking the health status of non-hospitalized patients while 
they perform their daily activities. The system tries to 
provide high QoS and to focus on connectivity-related issues 
between the patients and the global cloud. The CHMS design 
includes four basic components: Wireless routers, Gateways, 
WBANs and Medical staff. 
Domingo [5] has proposed a context-aware service 
architecture for the integration of WBANs and social 
networks through the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). In 
this architecture, multimedia services are accessed by the 
user from several wireless devices via an IP or cellular 
network based on the vital signs monitored in a WBAN. The 
architecture is divided into four layers: (i) Device layer – the 
sensors communicate with the gateway using ultra-wideband 
(UWB) or the IEEE 802.15.6 standard, and the gateway 
communicates with the monitoring station using Bluetooth or 
ZigBee. (ii) Access layer – responsible for the access of the 
monitoring stations to the radio channel. (iii) Control layer – 
it controls the authentication, routing and distribution of IMS 
traffic. (iv) Service layer - used to store data, execute 
applications, or provide services. 
Wan et al. [6] have proposed a framework for a pervasive 
healthcare system with Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) 
capabilities. This system is composed of four main 
components: (i) WBANs – which collect various vital 
signals, such as body temperature or heart rate information 
from wearable or implantable sensors. (ii) Wired/Wireless 
transmission. (iii) Cloud services – which possess powerful 
Virtual Machine resources, such as CPU, memory, and 
network bandwidth in order to provide all kinds of cloud 
services. (iv) Users – such as hospitals, clinics, researchers, 
and patients. 
Kartsakli et al. [7] cites a remote monitoring scheme that 
provides ubiquitous connectivity for mobile patients. A 
patient-attached monitoring device collects the WBAN data, 
classifies them as high-priority (e.g., critical data such as 
blood pressure, pulse rate and heart rate) or normal priority 
(e.g., ECG signals) and forwards them towards the 
healthcare provider through a heterogeneous WiFi/WiMAX 
access communication network. 
Kartsakli et al. [7] also cites a three-tier network 
architecture for the remote monitoring of elderly or chronic 
patients in their residence. The lower tier consists of two 
systems: (i) a patient-worn fabric belt, which integrates the 
medical sensors and is equipped with a Bluetooth 
transceiver; and (ii) the ambient wireless sensors that form a 
ZigBee network and are deployed in the patient’s 
surroundings (e.g., in the patient’s home or in a nursing 
house). In the middle tier, an ad hoc network of powerful 
mobile computing devices (e.g., laptops, PDAs, etc.) gathers 
the medical and ambient sensory data and forwards them to 
the higher tier. The middle-tier devices must have multiple 
network interfaces: Bluetooth and ZigBee to communicate 
with the lower tier and WLAN or cellular capabilities for 
connection with the higher layer. Finally, the higher tier is 
structured on the Internet and includes the application 
databases and servers that are accessed by the healthcare 
providers. 
Kartsakli et al. [7] also cites a system architecture based 
on two independent subsystems for the monitoring and 
location tracking of patients within hospital environments. 
The healthcare monitoring subsystem consists of smart shirts 
with integrated medical sensors, each equipped with a 
wireless IEEE 802.15.4 module. The location subsystem has 
two components: (i) a deployment of wireless IEEE 802.15.4 
nodes that are installed in known locations within the 
hospital infrastructure and broadcast periodic beacon frames; 
and (ii) IEEE 802.15.4 end devices, held by the patients, that 
collect signal strength information from the received 
beacons. Both subsystems transmit their respective data (i.e., 
medical sensory data and signal strength information) to a 
gateway through an IEEE 802.15.4-based ad hoc distribution 
network. 
III. MAIN REQUIREMENTS 
The selected architecture should offer to the hub and each 
node within the WBAN some specific advantages. The main 
requirements of the proposed architecture can be enumerated 
like: 
x 
Energy 
Efficiency: 
to 
minimize 
the 
power 
consumption avoiding or mitigating collisions, idle 
listening, overhearing, and control packet overhead. 
The 
proposed 
architecture 
should 
decrease 
contention-based transmissions and increase the 
sleeping time for each node. 
x 
Reliability: to assure the end-to-end packet delivery 
between the sensor nodes and the hub. The proposed 
architecture should allow the nodes to be able of 
sending all their emergency and normal packets to 
the hub. 
x 
QoS: to have the ability to deliver packets with the 
least latency and the highest throughput. The 
proposed architecture should allow the trade-off 
between the energy efficiency and the desired 
reliability of the WBAN. 
x 
Congestion Control: ability to control traffic in the 
WBAN in order to avoid packet collision and buffer 
overflow. The proposed architecture should decrease 
the packet loss due to the packet collision and both 
normal and emergency buffer overflow. 
x 
Rate Control: ability to prevent the nodes from 
overwhelming the hub and the whole WBAN. The 
proposed architecture should allow the hub to 
control the packet rate of the sensor nodes in order to 
keep an average rate in the whole WBAN. 
x 
Loss Detection: ability to detect the lost packets in 
the hub side and in each node side. The proposed 
architecture should provide the early detection of 
lost packets on both sides: the hub and the sensor 
nodes.

x 
Loss Recovery: ability to make the lost packet 
retransmission 
requests 
and 
to 
send 
the 
corresponding packet retransmissions. The proposed 
architecture should decrease the total number of lost 
packet through the retransmission of some of them. 
x 
Fairness: ability to distribute the network resources 
equitably among all nodes of the WBAN. The 
proposed architecture should allow all nodes to get 
equal access to the network and give the 
corresponding 
priority 
to 
those 
nodes 
with 
emergency traffic and with high packet rate. 
x 
Emergency Awareness: ability to respond to any 
emergency event in any node at any time. The 
proposed architecture should be able to detect early 
any emergency event and to give the corresponding 
priority to the emergency nodes. 
x 
Context Awareness: ability to respond to any alert 
(high buffer, low battery, emergency) in any node at 
any time. The proposed architecture should be able 
to detect high buffer levels, low battery levels, and 
any emergency event into the nodes. 
IV. PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE 
This section explains the proposed architecture that 
gathers all the protocols and schemes presented in the 
previous work by Jaramillo et al. [8]-[10]. The section 
presents the proposed phases for each beacon period. Then, it 
summarizes all the protocols and schemes, depicts the 
general and the node architectures, and the global topology. 
Finally, the section explains the operation of the R’s 
Indicator Bits (RIBs) scheme for each beacon period and the 
overall node behavior. 
A. Phases in the Beacon Period 
Figure 1 depicts the three proposed phases within the 
beacon period. The first phase is called Reallocation, 
Retransmission & Rate-control Phase (3RP). It is used by the 
hub for sending slot reallocations, retransmission requests 
and the Rate Control Factor (RCF) to all nodes. The second 
phase is Managed Access Phase (MAP). It is used by all 
nodes for sending normal and emergency traffic, always 
giving the highest priority to the emergency traffic. The third 
phase is called Special Contention Access Phase (SCAP). All 
nodes use SCAP for sending connection requests and 
additional normal and emergency traffic. 
There is no contention during 3RP due to the use of the 
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol. The hub 
uses all slots for sending slot reallocations and the RCF. 
 
 
Figure 1. Phases in the Beacon Period. 
The nodes only send lost packet retransmissions after 
they have received a lost packet retransmission request from 
the hub. MAP also uses the TDMA protocol for transmitting 
normal and emergency traffic. The use of Carrier Sense 
Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) in 
SCAP implies contention-based transmission during this 
phase. At least one phase needs to offer contention to allow 
the unconnected nodes to connect to the WBAN. 
B. Protocols and Schemes 
The 
energy-efficient 
and 
emergency-aware 
MAC 
protocol for WBANs proposed by Jaramillo et al. [8] is 
based on the existing MAC protocol described in the IEEE 
802.15.6 standard, but with some modifications in the access 
phases and the access methods for each beacon period in 
order to provide more emergency awareness while keeping 
energy 
efficiency. 
The 
proposed 
MAC 
protocol 
outperformed the IEEE 802.15.6 MAC protocol, the IEEE 
802.15.4 MAC protocol and the Timeout-MAC (T-MAC) 
protocol in the percentage of emergency and normal packet 
loss and latency, while maintaining similar energy 
consumption as the IEEE 802.15.6 MAC protocol. In the 
MAC layer, the hub uses the Slot Reallocation Algorithm 
depicted in Figure 2 to create the slot reallocations for all 
nodes. 
 
 
Figure 2. Slot Reallocation Algorithm. 
The reliable transport protocol based on loss recovery 
and fairness for Sports WBANs proposed by Jaramillo et al. 
[9] is a cross-layer design that detects out-of-sequence 
packets and requests retransmission of some lost packets. 
The hub and each node in the WBAN detect lost packets and 
make the requests and retransmissions during 3RP. The hub 
calculates the Fairness Index as the ratio between the number 
of lost packets and the total number of received packets. The 
hub uses the Fairness Index to prioritize the request creation 
in order to provide fairness between all the nodes in the 
WBAN. It outperformed the IEEE 802.15.6 Standard in the 
percentage of the packet loss, while maintaining similar 
energy consumption. The Packet Loss Detection Algorithm 
is used by the hub and the nodes and it is depicted in Figure 
3 and Figure 4, respectively. The hub and the nodes detect 
lost packets in the MAC layer.

Figure 3. Packet Loss Detection in the Hub. 
 
Figure 4. Packet Loss Detection in the Node. 
The rate control scheme for congestion control in Sports 
WBANs proposed by Jaramillo et al. [10] is context-aware 
and responses to emergency events in any node, reducing the 
normal traffic rate. When an emergency event occurs in the 
WBAN, the hub has to calculate RCF and communicate it to 
all nodes in the network in order to keep the same average 
rate of traffic during the entire emergency event. The 
proposed solution improved the performance of the IEEE 
802.15.6 Standard. The Rate Control Scheme depicted in 
Figure 5 is used by the hub in the MAC layer to calculate the 
RCF for all nodes, and it is used by the nodes in the 
application layer for applying the RCF sent by the hub. 
 
 
Figure 5. Congestion Control in the Hub. 
C. General Architecture 
Figure 6 depicts the proposed general architecture. The 
hub and the sensors are composed of five modules. (i) 
Sensing Module (SM) – in charge of sensing body 
information and detecting alerts into the packets. (ii) 
Memory Module (MM) – in charge of storing sensing data 
and lost packets for future retransmissions. (iii) Battery 
Module (BM) – in charge of detecting low battery levels. (iv) 
Processing Module (PM) – in charge of processing body 
information, creation of slot reallocations, detecting lost 
packets, sending requested lost packets, and processing the 
RCF for congestion control. 
 
Figure 6. General Architecture. 
(v) Radio-Frequency Module (RFM) – in charge of the 
transmission of the body information between the nodes and 
the hub (via either Human Body Communication - HBC, 
Narrow Band - NB, or Ultra-Wideband - UWB). It also 
manages the communication between the hub and the coach 
devices, data centers, and other stakeholders (via either 
Global System for Mobile communication - GSM, Long-
Term Evolution - LTE, Wi-Fi, or Worldwide Interoperability 
for Microwave Access - WiMAX). 
D. Node Architecture 
Figure 7 depicts the node architecture with its five 
modules. (i) The SM supports the Slot Reallocation 
Algorithm with the detection of the alert type into each 
packet. (ii) The MM supports the Slot Reallocation 
Algorithm with the detection of future emergency buffer 
overflow, and supports the Lost Packet Retransmission 
Algorithm with the buffering of lost packet for future 
retransmissions. (iii) The BM supports the Slot Reallocation 
Algorithm with the detection of low battery levels. (iv) The 
PM supports the Slot Reallocation Algorithm, the Rate 
Control Scheme with the processing of the RCF, and 
supports both the Packet Loss Detection Algorithm and the 
Lost Packet Retransmission Algorithm with the creation of 
lost packet retransmission requests and the sending of lost 
packet retransmissions. (v) The RFM supports the Slot 
Reallocation Algorithm, the Rate Control Scheme and the 
Packet Loss Detection Algorithm, with the sending of slot 
reallocations, the RCF, and lost packet retransmissions, 
respectively. 
E. Topologies 
The proposed WBAN topology is always a star topology. 
In this way, the use of a special routing protocol is not 
needed. The hub must always be in the center.

Figure 7. Node Architecture. 
The sensor nodes must be around the hub. The hub is in 
the right hip. There are two sensor nodes over the wrists, two 
sensor nodes over the ankles and one last sensor node over 
the chest. Each sensor node has a direct wireless connection 
with the hub, and there are not relaying nodes for the packet 
routing. With this direct connection of sensor nodes to the 
hub, the information takes the least possible delay in 
transmission. Besides, the failure of a single node does not 
compromise the remaining nodes. 
Figure 8 depicts the global topology for the proposed 
architecture. After gathering and processing the body 
information from nodes within the WBAN star topology, the 
hub can send this information both directly to a coach device 
(via Wi-Fi, GSM, LTE) or to other stakeholders (via GSM, 
LTE, Wi-Fi, WiMAX). The coach device can perform 
additional processing to help the coach to improve the 
training plan of the sportsman. The stakeholders can see the 
processed information into the data centers to improve 
research in training protocols of athletes, and deficiency 
detection. 
 
Figure 8. Global Topology. 
F. RIBs in the Beacon 
Table I shows the configuration of indicator bits into 
each beacon for the proposed architecture. Only three extra 
bits were used within each beacon for indicating whether the 
hub is going to assign slot Reallocations, to request packet 
Retransmissions, to send Rate-control requests, or any 
combination of them. When an emergency event happens in 
any node, the hub receives an alert from the node and it can 
decide whether the congestion control is necessary and use 
the Rate-control Indicator Bit (Third Bit). If there are many 
lost packets detected by the hub, it may use the 
Retransmission Indicator Bit (Second Bit). The Reallocation 
Indicator Bit (First Bit) is always used by the hub after an 
emergency event occurs in any node.

The value of 1 (one) in the Reallocation Indicator Bit, 
means that the hub is going to send slot reallocations to all 
nodes in the current beacon period. The value 1 (one) in the 
Retransmission Indicator Bit means that the hub has detected 
lost packets and it is going to send packet retransmission 
requests in the current beacon period. The value 1 (one) in 
the Rate-control Indicator Bit means that the hub has 
received an emergency alert and it is going to send a RCF to 
control the rate inside all normal nodes in the current beacon 
period. This strategy allows to easily extend the number of 
indicator bits for new hub behaviors. 
G. Nodes Behavior 
Figure 9 summarizes the behavior of each node for the 
proposed architecture. After the beacon reception, the node 
has two options: it evaluates the RIBs if it is connected or it 
must wait until SCAP if it is unconnected. When it is 
unconnected, the node will always send its connection 
request during the next SCAP. 
During 3RP phase (the yellow color zone), the node has 
previously evaluated the RIBs, then, the node can listen to 
slot reallocations sent from the hub, or listen to the RCF sent 
from the hub, or listen to lost packet retransmission requests 
sent from the hub and finally resend the lost packets 
requested by the hub. 
During MAP phase (the blue color zone), the node sends 
emergency and normal packets giving the highest priority to 
the emergency traffic. The node uses its own assigned slots 
and it might use the remaining slots at the end of MAP if 
needed. If there were slot reallocations for this beacon 
period, the node will use the new slot reallocation received, 
otherwise, it will use the original slot relocation received 
when it connected to the WBAN for the first time.

Figure 9. Overall Behavior of the Nodes.
Finally, during SCAP phase (the green color zone), the 
node sends management packets (e.g., connection requests) 
and additional emergency and normal traffic. The priority 
from the highest to the lowest for the traffic during SCAP is: 
(1) Management packets, (2) Emergency traffic, and (3) 
Normal traffic. 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The MAC protocol, the Transport protocol and the Rate 
Control schema were compared against the IEEE 802.15.6 
Standard, the IEEE 802.15.4 Standard and the T-MAC 
protocol. Castalia was chosen as the simulator because it 
offers a very good implementation for the IEEE 802.15.6 
MAC protocol [11]. The performance of the architecture was 
evaluated using three parameters: (i) the packet loss; (ii) the 
Energy Waste Index (EWI), which was calculated as the 
ratio between the total percentage of lost packets and the 
average consumed energy. The lower the EWI, the better the 
energy effectiveness of the proposed solution; and (iii) the 
latency of the normal and the emergency traffic. 
In some simulations, the number of emergency events 
was changed incrementally from one to five. Each 
emergency event had the duration of five seconds. The 
simulation time was 300s, the packet rate was 20pkt/s, and 
the number of nodes was 10. The percentage of emergency 
packet loss when the number of emergency events was 
changed in the WBAN is depicted in Figure 10. The 
proposed solution showed the lowest percentage of 
emergency packet loss (almost 0% no matter the total 
number of emergency events) because of the Slot 
Reallocation Algorithm and the Packet Loss Detection 
Algorithms. The behavior of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC 
protocol and T-MAC protocol with the emergency traffic 
when we increased the number of emergency events in the 
WBAN, demonstrates why we should not use WSN MAC 
protocols directly on WBANs. As the emergency events 
were not generated at the same time, the behavior of all 
protocols stayed almost the same when we change the 
number of emergency events in the WBAN.

Figure 10. Emergency Packet Loss vs Number of Emergency Events. 
For other simulations, the simulation time was changed 
incrementally from 400s to 2000s. The packet rate was 
20pkt/s, and the number of nodes was ten. There were three 
emergency events with the duration of five seconds each. 
The Energy Waste Index when the simulation time was 
changed in the WBAN is depicted in Figure 11. The 
proposed solution showed the best Energy Waste Index for 
emergency traffic (almost 0). The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC 
protocol showed the worst Energy Waste Index because of 
its poor performance with the emergency packet loss (more 
than 80%). The Figure 11 shows how the IEEE 802.15.4 and 
T-MAC protocols improve the Energy Waste Index with the 
increase of the simulation time, but this is due to the increase 
of the average energy consumption. 
 
 
Figure 11. Energy Waste Index vs Simulation Time. 
In the final simulations, the simulation time was 300s, the 
number of nodes was six, the packet rate was 20pkt/s and 
there was one emergency event at t=150s with the duration 
of five seconds. The latency distribution for emergency 
packets and normal packets is depicted in Figure 12 and 
Figure 13, respectively. The number of emergency packets 
with the lowest latency (between 0 and 100 milliseconds) in 
the proposed solution was much higher than the other three 
MAC protocols. This is due to the Slot Reallocation 
Algorithm, the lack of contention for emergency traffic 
during the MAP phase, and besides, the additional 
contention phase (SCAP) for emergency and normal traffic 
into each beacon period.  
 
Figure 12. Latency for Emergency Traffic. 
 
Figure 13. Latency for Normal Traffic. 
The number of normal packets with low latency (between 
0 and 160 milliseconds) in the proposed MAC protocol was 
higher than the other MAC protocols, excepting the IEEE 
802.15.4 MAC protocol, because of the poor average 
performance of the latter with emergency traffic. With the 
IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol, almost 90% of the emergency 
traffic was delivered with the latency of more than 400 
milliseconds, while almost 90% of the normal traffic was 
delivered with the latency of fewer than 120 milliseconds. 
VI. ARCHITECTURES COMPARISON 
The Table II presents a comparison of the proposed 
architecture with some architectures published recently and 
described in Section II. In order to make the comparison with 
other architectures, the main requirements of all the 
architectures were used. The first architecture used for the 
comparison was a Context-Aware Service Architecture for 
the Integration of WBANs and Social Networks through the 
IMS presented by Domingo [5]. The second architecture was 
an 
Un-Obstructive 
WBAN 
for 
Efficient 
Movement 
Monitoring presented by Felisberto et al. [3]. The third 
architecture was a Cloud-Enabled WBAN for Pervasive 
Healthcare presented by Wan et al. [6]. The fourth 
architecture was a QoS-Aware Health Monitoring System 
using Cloud-Based WBANs presented by Almashaqbeh et 
al. [4]. The final architecture was a Configurable Energy-
Efficient Compressed Sensing Architecture with its 
application on WBANs presented by Wang et al. [2].

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The main objective was to design a reliable, context-
aware and energy-efficient architecture for WBANs, 
ensuring QoS and fairness in sports applications. This 
objective was achieved through the joint of some protocols, 
algorithms, schemes, and the proposition of a new hub and 
nodes architecture. The architecture is composed of: (i) an 
energy-efficient, context-aware and reliable MAC protocol; 
(ii) a reliable transport protocol based on loss-recovery and 
fairness; and (iii) a context-aware rate control scheme for 
congestion control in WBANs. 
The architecture was compared with other architectures 
using the main requirements of all the proposed 
architectures. 
While 
some 
architectures 
focused 
on 
challenges like coexistence, interference, topology changes, 
node placement optimization, nodes wearability, and energy 
harvesting, the proposed architecture is the only one focused 
on energy efficiency, reliability, QoS, congestion control, 
rate control, loss detection, loss recovery, fairness, 
emergency awareness, and context awareness, all at the same 
time. 
Future work includes working in additional challenges to 
design WBANs like high-security mechanisms and topology 
changes support. Besides, the development of new energy-
efficient routing protocols taking advantage of the 
coexistence of other WBANs in the vicinity. This work 
could be extended to enhance the quality of life of children, 
ill and elderly people.
