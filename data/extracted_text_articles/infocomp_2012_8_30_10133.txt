Abstract—When disruptions occur, the airlines have to recover 
from the disrupted schedule. The recovery usually consists of 
aircraft recovery, crew recovery and passengers’ recovery. 
This paper focuses on aircraft recovery. Take the total cost of 
assignment, cancelation and delay as an objective; we present a 
more practical model, in which the maintenance and other 
regulations are considered. Then, we present a so-called 
iterative tree growing with node combination method. By 
aggregating nodes, the possibility of routings is greatly 
simplified. So, it can give out the solution in more reasonable 
time. Finally, we use data from a main Chinese airline to test 
the solution algorithm. The experimental results state that this 
method could be used in aircraft recovery problem.

I. INTRODUCTION 
When disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, 
air traffic control or mechanical failures occur, the airlines 
have to recover from the disrupted schedule. The airlines 
recovery usually consists of aircraft recovery, crew recovery 
and passengers’ recovery. Since the aircraft is viewed as the 
most important scarce resource, the most work on 
operational recovery problems has been reported on the 
aircraft recovery. 
Aircraft recovery problem (ARP) is to determine new 
flight departure times, cancellations and rerouting for 
affected aircrafts including ferrying, diverting, swapping and 
so on. Besides that several decision rules, such as, aircrafts 
balance requirements, maintenance requirements and station 
departure curfew restrictions should also be considered. At 
the end of the recovery period, aircrafts should be positioned 
to resume operations as planned. 
Being different to the aircraft rotation problem in the 
planning stage, the method to solve the ARP should calculate 
the problem in reasonable time, which is very difficult to 
most optimization solvers under most reasonable disruption 
scenarios. How to solve the ARP in reasonable time and 
meet these decision rules has been one of the most important 
keys in airline recovery study. Teodorvic and Gubernic 
(1984) [1] are one of the first to study the aircraft recovery 
problem, using a branch and bound (B&B) algorithm [2] to 
solve the aircraft recovery model (ARM) , but the research 
does not satisfy the constraints of station curfews, 
maintenance requirements and aircrafts balance at the 
recovery period in the modeling. Arguello et al. (1997) [3] 
creates a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure 
(GRASP) to reconstruct aircraft routings, which is a fast 
heuristic based on randomized neighborhood search, but they 
don’t consider the maintenance requirements and crew 
requirements after the aircraft routings altered. Afterwards, 
Bard et al. (2001) [4] develops a time-band optimization 
model to reconstruct cost-effective aircraft routings. The 
disadvantage is that the research excludes the maintenance 
requirements and crew requirements. Thengvall (2003) [5] 
presents a bundle algorithm to solve a multi-commodity 
network model. As in Petersen et al. (2010) [6], they 
integrate all kinds of recovery simultaneously, and employ 
the Bender’s decomposition to decompose the model into a 
master problem (airline schedule recovery) and three sub-
problems (aircraft recovery, crew recovery and passenger 
recovery), using an optimization-based approach to solve the 
situation of hub closure. 
In our paper, modeling is based on flight strings instead 
of flights as well as defining recovery scope, in order to 
solve the model in reasonable time. We assign specific 
aircraft to flight strings while meeting maintenance 
requirements, station departure curfew restrictions and other 
aircraft requirements. As to the solution methodology, firstly, 
we transform our model into time-space network. Then, we 
create a new method (a so-called iterative tree growing with 
node combination method) to solve the network model, 
which is the most important part of our paper. We test our 
intelligent method with data from Chinese airlines. 
Computational results are presented for a daily schedule 
recovery, showing that the proposed approach provides faster 
times to optimality in some cases and always obtains feasible, 
near-optimal solutions for medium-size airlines recovery 
problem much more quickly than can be found using CPLEX. 
In our future study, we should do much more experience to 
test our new method, try it on the large-size airlines recovery 
problem and use it much more widely, for example, in 
integrated recovery combining with crew recovery or 
passenger recovery or all of the three.  
The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. We 
first give in Section II a literature review of the aircraft 
recovery problem. In Section III, we build our aircraft 
recovery model. The solution methodology is described in 
Section IV and two scenarios are presented to test the 
intelligent method. We give our conclusion in Section V. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
When one or more aircrafts are out of service, the airlines 
have to operate the flight schedule with a reduced number of 
planes. Teodorvic and Gubernic (1984) [1] are the pioneers 
to study ARP. The paper tries to minimize total the 
passenger delay by swapping or delaying flights and solved 
exactly by branch and bound. Subsequently, Teodorovic and 
Stojkovic (1990) [7] formulates a heuristic algorithm to solve 
the same problem as Teodorvic and Gubernic (1984) [1]. But, 
in their paper the chief objective is to minimize the total

passenger delay with an equal total number of cancelled 
flights. In addition, neither of these models considers flight 
delay and cancelation cost. 
Yan and Yang (1996) [8] are the first to allow for delays 
and cancelations simultaneously. Four systematic strategic 
models are developed by perturbing the BSPM (basic 
schedule perturbation model) and combining various 
scheduling rules. The BSPM is designed to minimize the 
schedule-perturbed period after an incident and to obtain the 
most profitable schedule given the schedule-perturbed period. 
These network models are formulated as pure network flow 
problems or network flow problems with side constraints. 
With real flight data from Taiwan Airlines, the former was 
solved by the network simplex method while the latter was 
solved by Lagrangian relaxation with subgradient methods. 
However, the constraints of aircraft maintenance and crew 
scheduling are overlooked. 
An extension to the network model of Arguello et al. 
(1997) [9] is presented by Thengvall et al. (2000) [10]. The 
authors presents a model in which they penalize in the 
objective function the deviation from the original schedule 
and they allow human planners to specify preferences related 
to the recovery operations.  
Rosenberger et al. (2003) [11] models ARP as a set-
packing problem with a time window and slots restrictions. 
In this model the objective is to minimize the cost of 
assigning routes to aircraft and the cost of cancelling the 
unassigned legs. Being different from Arguello et al. (1997) 
[3] and Bard et al. (2001) [4], their paper assumes an aircraft 
selection heuristic (ASH) for ARO (an optimization model 
for aircraft recovery), which selects a subset of aircraft for 
optimization prior to generating new routes. Compared with 
network model, this model can check maintenance feasibility 
using column generation.  
Eggenberg et al. (2007) [13] introduces an extension of 
the time-space network model to minimize delays, 
cancellations and plane swappings, and make span cost. 
In Massound Bazargan (2010) [14], the paper introduces 
the airline irregular operation in detail and uses the time-
band optimization method to solve the aircraft recovery as an 
example. 
Le et al. (2011) [15] provides an overview recent years’ 
of disruption management of schedule, aircraft, crew, 
passenger and the integrated recovery. 
Something is done in our aircraft recovery model, aiming 
to minimize the aggregate cost comprised of assigning cost 
and recovering cost. We transform the aircraft recovery 
problem as a multi-commodity network with side constraints 
and using a so-called iterative tree growing with node 
combination method to solve the disruption.

The objective (1) tries to minimize the aggregate cost 
comprised of assigning strings (assignment cost) and 
recovering aircrafts (delay cost and cancellation cost) in the 
recovery scope. Either a flight must be contained in exactly 
one string or cancelled, as seen in (2). The cover constraints 
are split into (3) and (4) to distinguish between the 
mandatory and optional leg sets, ensure each aircraft is 
assigned to no more than one string. Maintenance cover 
constraints are seen in (5). This simply ensures a 
maintenance opportunity is built in, and the specific 
maintenance planning can be done post-optimization. 
Constraint (6) ensures that each available aircraft cannot be 
assigned to two different strings in the same time. The count 
constraint (7), make sure that the total number of aircraft in 
the air and on the ground does not exceed the size of fleet 
type e. Constraint (8) defines rotations aircraft usage. All 
flights in a rotation use one aircraft not different ones. By 
using the concept of rotation and defining rotations in the 
model, aircraft balance at each airport is satisfied. 
Constraints (9)–(12) determine the departure time of each 
flight. A flight cannot depart earlier than the ready time of its 
assigned aircraft, as stated in (9). Constraints in (10) ensure 
that when two flight strings are flown by the same aircraft, 
the second string cannot depart earlier than real arrival time 
of first string (because of the minimum connecting time). In 
a flight string, the departure time of a flight cannot be earlier 
than the arrival time of its previous flight, as stated in (11).

Constraints in (12) state that no flight is allowed to depart 
before its scheduled departure time. Constraints in (13) relate 
the departure and arrival times for each flight. Constraints 
(14)–(16) ensure that the x, z are binary variables. 
IV. SOLUTION METHODOLOGY 
Even by limiting the scope of the problem to get 
computational result, to most airlines, the problem is likely 
too large and complex to return a globally optimal solution 
with optimization solver for most reasonable disruption 
scenarios. Thus, we seek the hybrid method, which is 
optimization method with heuristic approach. The heuristic 
we used is so-called iterative tree growing with node-
combination. The time-space graph is used to describe our 
heuristic method. In the graph, the cities and times are 
represented horizontally and vertically respectively. Each 
node represents an airport-departure or airport-arrival event. 
All the arcs denote flights. Except first node (time-earliest 
node) and last node (time-termination node, usually night 
curfew time for departure), we draw all parallel arcs (copy 
arcs) if the arc lies above the node and originates from the 
same node (airport). As the flight arcs are placed in the graph 
iteratively, the tree grows downward. There are three kinds 
of arcs in the graph. One is original flight arcs. The other is 
copy arcs, which is actually opportunity flight arcs due to 
flight cancellation. The third is overfly arcs, which is actually 
delay flight arcs. Most probably, each copy arc generates a 
new node. From this new node, copy arcs and overfly arcs 
can be originated or connected again. It is an iterative 
procedure. By so stretching, the tree grows downward. 
Obviously, there will be more and more nodes and arcs 
as the graph stretches downward. Every route from top to 
down represents a routing. In order to simplify such a 
combinatorial problem, we use circle to replace a dot to 
represent a node. In other words, a node does not represent a 
single airport-departure or airport-arrival event, but a cluster 
of airport-departure or airport-arrival events. All the airport-
departure or airport-arrival dots within the certain time circle 
are aggregated to this node. The delay time is counted from 
departure circle node to arrival circle node, not the difference 
between real departure and arrival time. Under the extreme 
condition, such aggregating method may calculate delay time 
the whole circle diameter difference.  
The test instances used as benchmark problems in this 
study are acquired from real flight schedule of one medium-
size airlines in China. The schedule consists of 170 ﬂights 
served by 5 fleets, 35 aircrafts over a network of 51 airports 
all over the country. 
We choose test instances from the flight schedule. The 
relative data is listed in TABLE I. The computations also use 
the following assumptions: 
 
Each station requires a minimum of 40 minutes 
turnaround time; 
 
Execute midnight arrival/departure curfew (no arrival 
or departure after midnight is allowed); 
 
Each minute of delay on any flight costs the airline $20.

We use two scenarios to test the method.  
Scenario 1—Delay 
The aircraft 2 in airport SZX must be grounded at 8:00 
and is available until 15:00. That is, aircraft 2 is unavailable 
from 8:00 to 15:00. The trivial solution 1 is to cancel flights 
9380 and 9371 which are flown by aircraft 2 during 8:00 to 
15:00. The total cancellation cost is $28,990. The trivial 
solution 2 is to delay flight string 2(9380, 9371, 9372, 9369). 
The ready time of flight 9369 is 23:25. Against the curfew, 
so the flight 9369 should be canceled. The solution got from 
our method is listed in TABLE II. The total cost is $38.270. 
 
 
 
 
 
Scenario 2—Delay and grounded combination  
In this case, we assume that aircraft 1 in airport SHA 
becomes grounded owing to some mechanical failure at 8:00 
and is unavailable for the rest of the day. The obvious 
solution without permitting any rerouting of other aircraft is 
to cancel flights 9131, 9125, 9126 and 9132. These 
cancellations cost the airline a total of $71,300 (the sum of 
all cancellation costs for flight string1).

The according graph is drawn in Figure 1. The figure on 
the arc is flight number. The figure besides the node is 
departure or arrival time. The node is marked according to 
vertical time coordinate and horizontal airport coordinate. In 
order to reflect whether two flight legs can be connected, the 
arrival time has been added turnaround time. For example, 
flight 9131 arrives in TSN at 10:05 and connects to flight 
9125 which is available for departure at 10:45. We use 30 
minutes as the diameter of the circle. So, flight 9131 is not 
ready for departure at 10:45 but 11:00.

Figure 1 The flights graph 
In the Figure 1, one arc is drawn from node 2 to node 
16, it represents flight 9131. Actually it is a copy arc  
 
representing flight 9131, the delay time is 210 minutes, not 
the actual time minus the schedule time. This is because 
flight 9131 was scheduled to leave SHA at 8:15. If this 
flight occurs in node 2, the departure time is calculated as 
11:30. Considering the nodes are within 30 minutes circle, 
this delay spans from 8:00 to 11:30, a total of 210 minutes.  
Each minute of delay costs the airline $20, so flight 9131 
has a delay cost of $4,200 if it departs from node 2. 
Figure 2 is deduced form Figure 1 based on the method 
mentioned above.

Through a series of aircraft rerouting and cancellations 
in an effort to minimize the total cost to the airlines, the total 
cost of the solution is $16,800, less than the above two trivial 
options. In contrast with the method of branch and bound 
(B&B), using an intelligent algorithm we can quickly obtain 
feasible, near-optimal solutions faster times in some case 
study than using CPLEX (Thinkpad X201S). Through the 
computation results we can see our model has quite a good 
effect on aircraft recovery optimization. The total passenger 
delay is 40825 minutes. The total cost for this actual flight 
schedule is $16,800, which is similar to the solution got from 
our method.  
 
 
 
Using the so-called iterative tree growing with node 
combination method as scenario1，we can get the recovery 
solution for scenario2.

The total cost for scenario 2 by our method is $63,700, 
smaller than the trivial solution of $71,300 resulting from 
canceling all flights operated by aircraft 1. The total cost for 
this actual flight schedule is $63,400, which is similar to the 
solution got from our method. In this scenario we can see the 
aircraft is one of the most important resources in airlines 
recovery. The shortage of aircraft resources limited the 
degree of airlines recovery. 
V.    CONCLUSION 
The paper presents a more practical formulation for 
airline optimal recovery. In order to get the solution in a 
reasonable time, a new approach to solve the problem is 
studied. The computational results state the method could be 
used in airline recovery. On average, for medium-size airline 
recovery, the algorithm finds a feasible solution twice as fast 
as an exact algorithm, obtaining a high-quality feasible 
solution in half the time is an important improvement for our 
application. Often in our method, having several near-
optimal solutions provide decision makers much more 
flexibility.  
Airlines recovery is a more complex and large-scale 
problem. Not only should aircrafts be considered, but crew 
and passengers should be considered, too. In the future, a 
more comprehensive recovery model should be studied. 
Meanwhile, a more systematic evaluation of the method 
should be carried out.
