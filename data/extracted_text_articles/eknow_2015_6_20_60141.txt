Abstract—Based on a narrative review, this paper synthesizes 
the main contributions of the operations management and the 
information systems disciplines to the business process 
management literature. Our findings show that the operations 
management discipline has been the main contributor to the 
topics of business process definition, business process 
standardization, business process outsourcing/offshoring, Six 
Sigma, and business process management theories while the 
information systems discipline has been the main contributor 
to the topics of business process reengineering, the role of 
information technology, and the business process management 
nomological network.

INTRODUCTION 
The study of business processes has been a long-standing 
concern for members of academia and practitioners [1]. A 
business process can be defined as a lateral or horizontal 
organizational form that encapsulates the interdependence of 
tasks, role, people, departments and functions required to 
provide a customer (either internal or external) with a 
product or service, through the transformation of inputs into 
outputs [2][3][4][5]. The term customer refers here to both 
external consumers of the organization and internal 
recipients at linkage point between processes, as output from 
upstream processes become the input of subsequent 
processes [3][4]. This wealth of attention on business 
processes has fostered a vast literature centered on business 
process management (BPM). BPM can be defined as a 
strategy-driven organizational initiative to improve and (re)- 
design business processes to achieve competitive advantage 
through changes in the relationships between management, 
information, technology, organizational structure, and people 
[6][7]. 
Two disciplines have mainly contributed the BPM 
literature: the operations management (OM) and information 
systems (IS) disciplines. The OM discipline is concerned 
with overseeing, designing, and controlling the process of 
production and redesigning business operations in the 
production of goods or services by considering the 
acquisition, development, and utilization of resources. The 
IS discipline examine the phenomena that emerge when 
technology and peoples interact. While both disciplines have 
brought significant contributions to BPM, their respective 
efforts are most often conducted in silo and are rarely 
integrated into a common whole. Consequently, we still lack 
a comprehensive understanding of the current state of 
knowledge on BPM. The objective of this paper is thus to 
synthesize the main contributions of the OM and IS 
disciplines in order to comprehensively detail the state of 
knowledge on BPM. 
The findings exposed in this paper are based on a 
narrative review. A narrative review provides a verbal 
summary of previously published research on a particular 
topic of interest by either focusing on related concepts and 
theories, research methods or research outcomes [8]. 
Narratives reviews “serve a scientific field by providing a 
much-needed bridge between the vast and scattered 
assortment of articles on a topic and the reader who does not 
have the time or resources to track them down [9, p. 311]”. 
In addition, narrative reviews can serve as an appropriate 
starting point for future inquiries and research developments 
[10]. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
presents a brief history of the BPM literature to demonstrate 
that today’s understanding of business processes and their 
improvement highly rest on the intertwined findings of the 
OM and IS disciplines. Then, based on this understanding, 
we use a narrative approach in Section 3 to detail the main 
contributions of the OM and IS disciplines along the four 
main sub-streams of the BPM literature: business process 
standardization (BPS), business process reengineering 
(BPR), Six Sigma, and theorizing efforts. The paper 
concludes with a presentation of research limits and future 
research avenues. 
II. 
A BRIEF HISTORY OF BUSINESS PROCESS 
MANAGEMENT 
Initially, the study of business processes emerged as a 
central element of total quality management (TQM) [3][7]. 
The history starts with the seminal work of quality 
management proponents such as Ishikawa [11], Deming 
[12], and Juran [13]. In essence, these works focused on “the 
creation of an organizational system that fosters cooperation 
and learning for facilitating the implementation of process 
132

management practices, which in turn, leads to continuous 
improvement of processes, products and services, and to 
employee fulfillment, both of which are critical to customer 
satisfaction, and, ultimately to firm survival [14, p. 473]”. 
Subsequent writings by Davenport and Short [15] and 
Hammer [16] highlighting the necessity to focus on business 
processes reengineering (BPR) reinforced and broaden the 
initial interest on the subject [7]. It was also at this point in 
time that the interdependent relationship between IS and 
BPM was explicitly acknowledged [15] enticing the OM and 
IS communities to work together to improve our 
understanding of BPM. This is certainly exemplified by the 
adjacent publication of special issues on the topic of TQM in 
the Academy of Management Review in June 1994 and the 
Journal of Management Information Systems in 1995, two 
top journals in their respective discipline.  
Today, with the increasing emphasis placed on 
integrating business Web sites with backend legacy and 
enterprise systems, the management of business processes 
remains an important topic in the IS discipline [17] while the 
need for ambidextrous organizations puts BPM to the 
forefront in the OM and management discipline [3]. Hence, 
even though the initial idea of BPM emerged from the OM 
discipline [15], today’s understanding of business processes 
and their improvement highly rests on the intertwined 
findings of the OM and IS disciplines. Two reasons explain 
why BPM has been predominantly researched in these two 
disciplines. First, researchers within both the OM and IS 
communities have long recognized the systemic nature of the 
firm and the need for a holistic approach in its management 
[18][19]. Hence, studying business processes, which span 
across intra-organizational and in certain circumstances 
inter-organizational boundaries, is important in both 
disciplines. Second, because business processes span across 
internal and external organizational boundaries and because 
one of the key purposes of information technology (IT) is to 
reduce coordination cost across organizational entities, both 
disciplines have recognized the complementary if not 
symbiotic nature of business processes and IT [15][20][21], 
creating a state were both communities have mutually 
reinforced each other’s work and interest on BPM.  
III. 
A DETAILED NARRATIVE OF BUSINESS PROCESS 
MANAGEMENT AND KEY CONTRIBUTIONS 
Having briefly exposed the history of BPM and the 
importance of both the OM and IS disciplines to fully 
comprehend the improvement of business processes, we now 
examine the BPM literature in greater detail to show the 
contributions of both disciplines along the four critical sub-
streams of the BPM literature. To do so, we first show that 
the BPM literature initially evolved into two separate sub-
streams, BPS and BPR while a third sub-stream entitled Six 
Sigma that reconciles diverging views from the BPS and 
BPR sub-stream appeared more recently. Next, we detail the 
contributions within the fourth sub-stream that has focused 
on theorizing efforts to provide BPM explanations and to 
develop a BPM nomological network in an attempt to 
alleviate the previous three sub-stream’s shortcomings. We 
conclude by synthetizing the key contribution of both 
disciplines to BPM. 
A. The business process standardization, business process 
reengineering and Six Sigma sub-streams 
Various programs like TQM, ISO 9000, the Malcom 
Baldrige Award, Six Sigma and BPR have been developed to 
help managers improve their business processes [3][14][22]. 
However, despite the fact these programs share several 
similarities (i.e., they all aim to improve business processes), 
they also differ in scope and approach [3] as they differ 
significantly in the magnitude of change sought-after to 
improve business processes [3][23]. For instance, TQM, ISO 
9000, and the Malcom Baldrige Award programs have been 
depicted 
as 
programs 
seeking 
incremental 
changes 
[14][23][24] whereas BPR programs have been described as 
programs aiming for radical changes [6][16][25]. This major 
difference may be explained by the fact that proponents of 
both types of programs have different backgrounds. Indeed, 
TQM, ISO 9000, and the Malcolm Baldrige Award 
advocates relying on their vast experience with statistical 
process control continue to argue for incremental changes 
while BPR advocates relying on their IT implementation 
experience prone for radical changes [16][18]. Consequently, 
this divergence in scope and approach has led to the 
emergence of two key sub-streams in the BPM literature. 
The first, BPS, is mainly addressed in works from the OM 
discipline while the second, BPR is mainly addressed in 
works from the IS discipline. The BPS sub-stream has 
mainly focused on the standardization of business processes 
and process outsourcing/offshoring (BPO) while the BPR 
sub-stream has mainly addressed the reengineering of 
business processes and the role of IT in BPM. More recently, 
a third sub-stream focusing on Six Sigma has emerged. With 
its roots in the OM discipline, this sub-stream reconciles 
findings from the BPS and BPR sub streams. 
1) Business Process Standardization 
The cumulative and extensive work of TQM and other 
OM programs (e.g., ISO 9000, the Malcom Baldrige Award) 
has led to the identification of three key principles for 
business improvement, namely focus on customers and 
stakeholders, participation and teamwork throughout the 
organization, and focus on continuous improvement and 
learning [26], as well as the creation of three key BPM 
components: (1) process activity and flow standards, (2) 
process performance standards and (3) process management 
standards [4]. These principles and components have enabled 
a more efficient approach to improve business processes 
while simultaneously allowing for the emergence of BPS 
[27]. BPS can be defined as the degree to which work rules, 
policies and operating procedures in an organization, as 
established by consensus and approved by a recognized body 
(e.g., government agency, industrial consortia) [28], are 
formalized and followed [29]. BPS offers several important 
benefits to organizations [27]. Within an intra-organizational 
context, BPS facilitates communications on business 
operations, 
enables 
smooth 
handoff 
across 
process 
boundaries, and makes possible comparative measures of 
performance. Likewise, within an inter-organizational 
133

eKNOW 2015 : The Seventh International Conference on Information, Process, and Knowledge Management

context, BPS makes commerce easier by improving 
communication, enabling more efficient handoffs and 
allowing performance benchmarking [4]. As such, BPS has 
been shown to foster economies of scale, organizational 
learning, and overall organizational effectiveness [27]. 
Furthermore, when pushed to the extreme, the idea of 
BPS has also led some protagonists from operations 
management to believe that business processes could be 
outsourced/offshored in order to allow firms to reap further 
benefits by concentrating their efforts on their core 
competencies [4][30][31]. BPO can be defined as the 
delegation of one or more business processes to an external 
provider, whether onshore or offshore (Mani et al., 2010). 
Recent findings emanating from the OM and IS disciplines, 
however, suggest that reaping benefits from this approach is 
not as straightforward as previously expected [27][32] and 
that these benefits may only be temporary. Thus, 
organizations seeking to gain a sustainable competitive 
advantage should proceed carefully in embracing BPS and/or 
BPO practices [33][34]. 
2) Business Process Reingeneering 
BPR can be defined as an approach “for initiating and 
managing “radical” changes in business processes [35, p. 
32]”. Hence, with the help of statistical and quantitative 
analysis, BPR advocates aim to fundamentally rethink and 
redesign business processes in order to obtain dramatic and 
sustainable improvements in contemporary measures of 
performance (e.g., quality, cost, service, lead time, outcomes, 
flexibility, innovation) [25][26]. On their quest for radical 
changes, BPR advocates have directed their attention away 
from business processes themselves and started to look for 
solutions that could significantly alter them. This resulted on 
a strong emphasis on IT due to its ability to reduce 
coordination costs across internal and external organizational 
boundaries [15]. Accordingly, BPR advocates are mostly IS 
researchers. They have proposed five distinctive steps, one 
of which is dedicated to IS, to help managers reengineer 
business processes [15]. As a first step, managers should 
develop a business vision and define clear process 
objectives. 
Second, 
managers 
should 
identify 
the 
process/processes to be redesigned. Third, managers should 
develop an understanding of existing processes and measure 
them. Fourth, managers should identify key IT levers and 
fifth, managers should design and build a prototype of the 
improved 
business 
process/processes. 
By 
examining 
extensively the key role of IT in improving business 
processes, BPR advocates were able to determine that IT 
contributes to the reengineer of business processes in two 
ways. First, by forming an organization’s information 
backbone that spans across functional level and enables 
easier communication. Second, by providing capabilities that 
support key BPR activities, such as modeling, optimizing 
and validating [6][7][17]. Hence, IT can be seen as both an 
enabler  [20][25][36] and as a facilitator [37][38] of BPR. 
More precisely, IT plays an enabler’s role when it is used as 
a fundamental component of an improved process whereas 
IT plays a facilitator’s role when it supports the process 
improvement process without being included as a 
fundamental component of the final solution (i.e., the new or 
improved process doesn’t require IT). For example, 
improving the customer payment process may rest on the 
added capability of information technologies that allows for 
automatic payment between firms (i.e., IT enabler’s role) 
whereas improving a product assembly process could be 
done trough the use of statistical software in order to create a 
new optimal assembly sequence. In this latter example, the 
assembly process remains IT free but IT played a key role in 
improving the process (i.e., IT facilitator’s role). Evidently, 
both roles are not mutually exclusive and IT can, in many 
cases, play both roles simultaneously.  
Despite showing the great power of IT, these efforts have 
also highlighted the limits of technology. Indeed, these 
efforts have demonstrated that IT should not be a panacea to 
organizational process improvement problems but rather be 
considered as a part of a broader approach. That is, 
implementing IT just for the sake of it is not going to 
improve a business process. Having IT in mind as either an 
enabler, facilitator or both, organizations should aim to 
remodel their processes, in a way that the new processes 
developed answer business needs [20][38]. Furthermore, 
BPR efforts have also highlighted that IT can be a barrier to 
business process improvement. For instance, a firm lacking 
interoperability between its data from different information 
systems was unable to implement an improved version of its 
replenishment processes because its selling systems could 
not be readily integrated with ordering and logistics systems 
[36]. Taken as whole, these complementary findings indicate 
that anchoring BPR or BPM on IT alone is not enough to 
provide a sustainable competitive advantage [20][38] while 
the long term consequences of IT have to be considered 
since today’s solution can become tomorrow’s problems. 
3) Six Sigma 
Despite being mainly treated in two different disciplines, 
and characterizing business process change in a dichotomous 
manner where the relationship between incremental and 
radical changes is mutually exclusive, the BPS and BPR sub-
streams now seem to be converging. Indeed, recent 
characterizations of business process change in the BPM 
literature now follow a less strict standpoint and depict 
business process changes on a continuum ranging from 
incremental to radical changes, making the simultaneous 
pursuit of both types of changes possible [6][7][37]. This 
reconciliation between BPS and BPR advocates highlights 
the similarities between the two programs. That is, both BPS 
and BPR rest on the common purpose of transforming 
business 
processes 
by 
measuring, 
improving, 
and 
rationalizing each individual process as well as the handoffs 
between the different processes [3][7][21]. This convergence 
also highlights that the improvement of business process is 
grounded in three main common practices: mapping 
processes, improving processes, and adhering to systems of 
improved processes [3]. 
The reconciliation between BPS and BPR is also at the 
hearth of the emergence of new sub-stream on Six Sigma 
and may explain why organizations such as 3M, Ford, 
Honeywell and American Express already pursuing TQM 
and BPR programs were able to reach further benefit by 
adopting Six Sigma [24]. Indeed, because Six Sigma allows 
134

organizations to be ambidextrous, that is to support 
simultaneously the need for exploration and control, this 
innovative program combines the advantages of BPR and 
BPS while minimizing their respective shortcomings [3][24]. 
Six Sigma can be defined as a “project-driven management 
approach to improve the organization’s products, services, 
and processes by continually reducing defects in the 
organization [39, p. 1]”. As such, the main difference 
between BPS, BPR and Six Sigma rests in how business 
improvement tools/techniques are implemented in the 
organization, rather than in the underlying philosophy or the 
tools/technique employed to improve business processes 
[24]. More precisely, Six Sigma differs from BPR as it 
places more emphasis on data driven decisions rather than on 
statistics and quantitative analysis [26]. On the other hand, 
Six Sigma differs from BPS on the following aspects. First, 
it provides a more structured and rigorous training 
development program for managers. Second, the business 
process and its improvement is owned by a single 
“champion” in Six Sigma rather than by a multitude of 
worker in BPS. Third, Six Sigma is cross-functional and 
looks for verifiable return on investment whereas BPS is a 
process based methodology that lightly focuses on financial 
accountability [26]. Thus, besides providing a platform to 
allow for both incremental and radical changes, Six Sigma 
also suggests that an integrative framework of BPM is 
coming of age. It is important to note however that, to this 
day, the topic of Six Sigma has mainly been discussed in the 
OM disciplines while being addressed in only a very limited 
number of IS studies [40]. 
B. The Sub-Stream on Theorizing Efforts 
Research within the three previous sub-streams has 
fostered our knowledge on business process and BPM. 
However, 
although 
essential, 
these 
efforts 
remain 
insufficient to provide a comprehensive understanding of 
business process improvement. This is certainly exemplified 
by the fact that numerous if not the majority of organizations 
adopting one or many of the BPM programs mentioned 
above actually fail to reach expected benefits [1][6][41][42]. 
This phenomenon has created a productivity paradox with 
some organizations reaping significant benefits from BPM 
while others actually losing money. This issue is further 
exacerbated by the limited number of empirical research 
conducted to assess the effectiveness of BPM programs 
which has resulted in a state where BPM programs tailored 
to improve business processes are usually developed and 
adopted on the basis of anecdotal evidence rather then 
scientific knowledge [3][7][14]. Put differently, these 
previous observations indicate an evident lack of BPM 
theorizing [1][14][22]. In accordance with this assertion, 
several authors have observed that the vast majority of the 
studies on business process and BPM remains to this day 
highly prescriptive in nature and thus fails to highlight the 
underlying mechanisms behind the various programs 
developed and their respective limits [3][22]. 
Recognizing the need for theory, the OM and IS 
disciplines have conjointly begun to theorize on BPM. To do 
so, they have adopted various approaches: identifying 
BPM/IT critical success factors [1][41], identifying BPM 
antecedents [6], linking BPM with existing management 
theory [22], building BPM theory by using grounded theory 
[24] and censing current methodologies, techniques and tools 
[5] in an effort to resolve the issue. Representative findings 
from these theorizing efforts are summarized in Table 1. 
Four broad assertions can be gleaned from these 
theorizing efforts. First, BPM builds from knowledge rooted 
in multiple disciplines including management as strategy, 
organizational 
behavior 
and 
psychology, 
industrial 
economics and purchasing, innovation, organization design 
and human resources, sociotechnical design, quality and 
industrial engineering, marketing and finance [3][7]. 
Considering that the idea was to foster a holistic approach to 
organization management, it is not surprising that business 
process theorizing efforts have drawn from multiple 
disciplines that, altogether, allow for the required 360 
degrees view of an organization. Second, theorizing efforts 
aiming to explain the impact of BPM on organizational 
performance position the construct of business process 
management in a complex and dense nomological network 
[3][6][7][35]. A clear insight stemming from these proposed 
nomological networks is that researchers agree on the start 
and end point of BPM. Specifically, proposed BPM 
nomological networks typically build on the premise that 
BPM initiatives should be triggered by a strategic vision and 
aim for customer focused outcomes [6][7][14][22].

Third, contrary to early prescriptive attempts that prone the 
universality of BPM programs, current efforts clearly 
highlight that BPM programs are context dependent. The 
identified contingency factors generally include elements 
both internal and external to the organization [3][6][7]. 
Internal factors can be categorized in terms of organizational 
structure, management, information and technology, people, 
and business processes [6][7] while external factors usually 
refer to environmental conditions (e.g., economic conditions, 
industry competitiveness, innovations) [3][7]. As such, a 
careful reflection must be made before adopting one or many 
BPM programs [3]. Lastly, although they differ slightly, the 
contribution of the OM and IS disciplines to BPM theorizing 
efforts are complementary. Indeed, members of the OM 
discipline have mainly aimed to identify and define BPM 
underlying theories whereas members of the IS discipline 
have mainly aimed to define BPM’s nomological network. 
C. Synthethizing the key contribution of the operation 
management and IS discipline  
Having described the four sub-streams of the BPM 
literature, their respective key research topics and 
highlighted the role of the OM and IS disciplines in regards 
of each of these topics, we can now compare each 
discipline’s contribution towards the improvement of 
business processes. Table 2 synthetizes the results of this 
comparison.

Keeping in mind the results described above, one can see 
that the OM discipline played a prominent role in the topics 
of business processes definition, BPS, BPO, Six Sigma, and 
BPM theories. On the other hand, the IS discipline played a 
prevalent role in the topics of BPR, the role of IT, and BPM 
nomological network. Finally, both disciplines had an equal 
contribution in the business process management definition 
topic. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
We set out to identify the key contributions of the OM 
and IS disciplines to BPM. Our findings suggest that our 
knowledge of business processes and their improvement 
rests on the intertwined work of the OM and IS disciplines as 
neither discipline has comprehensively addressed each key 
BPM topics. While we have used a narrative review to 
provide a preliminary portrait of the OM and IS disciplines’ 
contributions to BPM and to show that each discipline seems 
to focus on different BPM topics, we have yet to thoroughly 
assess the quality of the sources composing our narrative 
review. Future research could address this issue through 
citation analysis and/or expert discussions, which would 
provide a more objective assessment of each discipline’s key 
contributions to BPM.
