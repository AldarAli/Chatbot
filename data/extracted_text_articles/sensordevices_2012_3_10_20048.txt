Abstract— Stacked layered pin a-SiC/a-Si devices based on a 
filter design are approached from a reconfigurable point of 
view. This paper shows that a double SiC/Si pin photodiode 
can be de-composed into two photonic active filters changeable 
in function. Reconfiguration is provided by optical control 
signals to the optoelectronic front and back pin building 
blocks. Depending on the wavelength and irradiation side of 
the external optical bias the device acts either as a short- and a 
long- pass band filter or as a band-stop filter, amplifying or 
rejecting a specific wavelength range. Particular attention is 
given to the amplification coefficient weights, which allow 
taking into account the wavelength background effects. We 
illustrate these effects in detail and discuss the filters transfer 
function characteristics. We present examples of filters and we 
propose a reconfigurable device for directed optical logic. An 
algorithm to decode the information is presented. An 
optoelectronic 
model 
supports 
the 
optoelectronic 
logic 
architecture.

 INTRODUCTION 
Multilayered structures based on amorphous silicon 
technology are expected to become reconfigurable to 
perform WDM optoelectronic logic functions and provide 
photonic functions such as signal amplification and 
switching [1, 2]. They will be a solution in WDM technique 
for information transmission and decoding in the visible 
range [3]. The basic operating principle is the exploitation of 
the physical properties of a nonlinear element to perform a 
logic function, with the potential to be rapidly biasing tuned. 
Amplification 
and 
amplitude 
change 
are 
two 
key 
functionality properties outcome of a balanced interaction 
between frequency and wavelength of the optical signal and 
background wavelength and placement within a WDM link. 
Any change in any of these factors will result in filter 
readjustments. Here, signal variations with and without front 
and back backgrounds move electric field action up and 
down in a known time frame. A numerical simulation 
support new optoelectronic logic architecture. 
II. 
DEVICE CONFIGURATION AND OPERATION 
The active device consists of a p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-
Si:H)-n heterostructure with low conductivity doped layers 
(Fig.1). The thicknesses and optical gap of the front í'- (200 
nm; 2.1 eV) and back i- (1000 nm; 1.8 eV) layers are 
optimized for light absorption in the blue and red ranges, 
respectively. 
Several 
monochromatic 
pulsed 
lights, 
separately (λR,G,B input channels) or in a polychromatic 
mixture (multiplexed signal), at different bit rates illuminated 
the device from the glass side. Steady state optical bias with 
different wavelength are superimposed (400nm-800 nm) 
from the front or from the back sides and the generated 
photocurrent measured at -8 V. The device operates within 
the visible range using as input color channels (data) the 
wave square modulated light (external regulation of 
frequency and intensity) supplied by a red (R: 626 nm; 51 
µW/cm2), a green (G: 524 nm; 73 µW/cm2) and a blue (B:

TRANSFER FUNCTION CHARACTERISTICS 
The transfer function magnitude (or gain) allows to 
determine the ability of the optical filter to distinguish 
between signals at different wavelengths. The spectral 
sensitivity 
was 
tested 
through 
spectral 
response 
measurements under different frequencies, with and without 
steady state optical bias applied either from the front or back 
side (Fig.1).

Figure 2.  Photocurrent without and with front (a) and back (b) 
backgrounds. The current of the individual photodiodes are superimposed 
(dash lines). 
In Fig. 2, at 500 Hz, the spectral photocurrent (symbols) 
is displayed under red, green, blue and violet background 
and without it. In Fig. 2a the steady state optical bias was 
applied from the front side and in Fig. 2b from the back side. 
For comparison the normalized spectral photocurrent for the 
front, p-i’-n, and the back, p-i-n, photodiodes (dash lines) are 
superimposed. 
Experimental data shows that the front and back building 
blocks, separately, presents the typical response of single p-i-
n cells with intrinsic layers based on a-SiC:H or a-Si:H 
materials, respectively. The front diode cuts the wavelengths 
higher than 550 nm while the back one rejects the ones lower 
than 500 nm. The overall device presents an enlarged 
sensitivity when compared with the individual ones. Results 
show that under front irradiation the sensitivity is much 
higher than under back irradiation. Under front irradiation 
(Fig.2a) the violet background amplifies the spectral 
sensitivity in the visible range while the blue optical bias 
only enhances the spectral sensitivity in the long wavelength 
range (>550 nm) and quenches it in the others. Under red 
bias, the photocurrent is strongly enhanced at short 
wavelengths and disappears for wavelengths higher than 550 
nm. Under green the sensitivity is strongly reduced in all the 
visible spectra. In Fig. 2b, whatever the wavelength of the 
backgrounds, the back irradiation strongly quenches the 
sensitivity in the long wavelength range (> 550nm) and 
enhances the short wavelength range. So, back irradiation, 
tunes the front diode while front irradiation, depending on 
the wavelength used, tunes the back one. 
 
IV. 
OPTICAL BIAS AMPLIFICATION 
In Fig. 3 the spectral gain, defined as the ratio between 
the spectral photocurrents under red (αR), green (αG) blue 
(αB) and Violet (αV) illumination and without it is plotted at 
500 Hz and 3500 Hz. The optical bias is applied from the 
front side, in Fig. 3a and from the back side, in Fig. 3b. 
Under front bias and red irradiation the gain is high at 
short wavelengths and strongly lowers for wavelengths 
higher than 550 nm, acting as a short-pass filter. Under green 
background and high frequencies, the device behaves as a 
band-stop filter that screens out the medium wavelength 
range (green) enhancing only the photocurrent for 
wavelengths outside of that range. Under blue and violet 
light the devices works as a long-pass filter for wavelengths 
higher than 550 nm, blocking the shorter wavelengths. Back 
light, whatever the frequency, leads to a short-pass filter 
performance. Experintal results show that by combining the 
background wavelengths and the irradiation side the short-, 
medium- and long- spectral region can be sequentially tuned.

In Fig. 4 the front and back gains as a function of the 
frequency, at fixed wavelengths: 470 nm (blue channel), 526 
nm (green channel) and as 624 nm (red channel) is plotted 
under 400 nm applied optical bias from the front (symbols) 
and back (lines) sides. Results show that, no matter what the 
irradiation side, the blue and green channel gain does not 
depend on the frequencies, while the red one increases under 
front illumination and is strongly reduced under back light. 
In Fig. 5 under front and back violet irradiation, it is 
displayed the spectral gain for three different frequencies. 
 Results show that, whatever the frequency, the device 
acts as an active long-pass filter under front irradiation and a 
low-pass filter under back irradiation. Under front bias the 
gain is higher than the unity for wavelengths above 500nm 
resulting in an amplification of the green and red spectral 
ranges. Back irradiation only amplifies the short wavelength 
range and extinguishes the others.

ENCODER AND DECODER DEVICE 
To analyze the device under information-modulated 
wave and uniform irradiation, three monochromatic pulsed 
lights separately (red, green and blue input channels, Fig. 6a) 
or combined (multiplexed signal, Fig. 6b) illuminated the 
device at 6000 bps. Steady state violet optical bias was 
superimposed separately from the front (solid lies, pin1) and 
the back (dash lines, pin2) sides and the photocurrent 
generated measured at -8 V. The transient signals were 
normalized to their values without background. In Fig. 6b the 
multiplexed signal without and with background are 
displayed (solid lines). Here the input channels without 
optical bias (dash lines) are also superimposed. On the top of 
the figure the signals used to drive the input channels are 
shown.

and from the back side (αpin2). b) Input R,G,B channels and multiplexed 
output without (no bias) and under front (pin1) and back (pin2) irradiation.  
 
Even under transient conditions, as in Fig 3, the front 
background presents the same nonlinear dependence on the 
wavelength. It enhances mainly the light-to-dark sensitivity 
in the medium-long wavelength ranges. Violet radiation is 
absorbed at the top of the front diode, increasing the electric 
field at the least absorbing cell [4], the back diode, where the 
red and part of the green channels generate optical carriers. 
So the collection is strongly enhanced (αV
Gpin1=2.2, 
αV
Rpin1=3.1) while the blue collection stays near its dark 
value (αV
Bpin1=1.1).  
Under back irradiation the small absorption depth of the 
violet photons across the back diode quenches the electric 
field and so, the red collection almost disappears 
(αV
Rpin2=0.2). Blue channel is absorbed across the front diode 
where the electric field is enhanced resulting in an increase 
collection of the blue channel (αV
Bpin1=1.6).

Figure 7.  MUX signal under front and back irradiation. On the top the 
DEMUX signals obtained using the decoder algorithm is displayed as well 
as the binary bit sequences. 
Since the green channel is absorbed across front and back 
diodes its collection is balanced by the increased collection 
in the front diode and its reduction at the back one 
(αV
Gpin2=0.7). 
Under 
front 
irradiation, 
the 
encoded 
multiplexed signal presents eight separate levels (23) each 
one related with an RGB bit sequence (right side of the Fig. 
6b). Those levels can be grouped into two main classes due 
to the high amplification of the red channel under front 
irradiation. The upper four levels are ascribed to the presence 
of the red channel ON and the lower four to its absence 
allowing the red channel decoder. Since under front 
irradiation the green channel is amplified, the two highest 
levels, in both classes, are ascribed to the presence of the 
green channel and the two lower ones to its lack. Under back 
irradiation, the red channel is suppressed, the blue enhanced 
and the green reduced, so the encoded multiplexed signal 
presents only four main separate levels (22). The two higher 
levels correspond to the presence of the blue channel ON 
with or without the green ON respectively, and the other two 
to its absence. The blue channel is then decoded. We have 
used this simple algorithm to decode the multiplex signal.

The results are displayed in Fig. 7 for two different bit 
sequences. An excellent fit was obtained. 
Results show that the pinpi´n multilayered structure 
become reconfigurable under front and back irradiation. 
They 
perform 
WDM optoelectronic 
logic 
functions 
providing photonic functions such as signal amplification, 
filtering and switching. So, by means of optical control 
applied to the front or back diodes, the photonic function is 
modified from a long- to a short-pass filter, giving a step 
reconfiguration of the device. 
VI. 
PHOTONIC ACTIVE FILTERS 
In the pi’n/pin device the morphology of filter system 
results from the interaction of the electric field under applied 
optical bias (red, green, blue, violet) and the transient electric 
field induced by the input channels. This interaction results 
in electric field lines that guides the photocarrriers generated 
by the input channels. The flow rate of the optical carriers 
through those field lines towards the output depends on the 
on/off state of the color channels.

Figure 8.  MUX signal outputs (a) and truth table (b) of the encoders that 
perform 8-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) function, under front violet irradiations. 
 
In Fig. 8a an output MUX signal under front violet 
irradiation is displayed. On the top the signals used to drive 
the input channels are displayed showing the presence of all 
the possible 23 on/off states (x0….x7). Fig. 8b shows the truth 
table of an encoder that performs 8-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) 
function. In the inputs (x0….x7) the index of each bit is 
related with of the first (highest) nonzero logic input. To 
understand this mapping, in Fig. 8b, for the input x7 and 
output S2, the first nonzero logic input is 7 (22+21+20), which 
corresponds an output [111]. That OR gate is expressed as 
S2=x7+x6+x5+x4. Under front violet irradiation, αV
R>>1, 
αV
G>1 and αV
B~1(Fig. 5). So, the correspondence between 
the outputs S2, S1, S0 and the on/off state of the input 
channels, SR, SG, SB, is obvious.  
The DEMUX, on the other hand, sends the input logic 
signal to one of its eight outputs (yS = x), according to the 
optoelectronic demux algorithm.  
To convert from a particular logic function (8-to-1 MUX) 
to another (FILTER), one needs only to redefine the input 
and output signals and to reconfigure the operation mode. 
Taking into account Fig. 5a, under back violet bias control, a 
step change in configuration occurs. Here, the encoded four 
level signal is grouped in two classes, the uppers two levels, 
where the blue channel is ON and the others where it is OFF 
(4-to-1 multiplexer; short-pass filter function). 
VII. OPTOELECTRONIC MODEL  
Based 
on 
the 
experimental 
results 
and 
device 
configuration an optoelectronic model, made out of a short-
pass and a long-pass filter (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) and 
supported by the complete dynamical large signal Ebers-
Moll model, was developed [5, 6]. The equivalent circuit, 
made out of a short-pass filter (front phototransistor, Q1) and 
a long-pass filter (back phototransistor, Q2) sections 
connected in parallel is displayed in Fig. 9a. The charge 
stored in the space-charge layers is modeled by the capacitor 
C1 and C2. R1 and R2 model the dynamical resistances of the 
internal and back junctions under different dc bias 
conditions. To allow independent blue, red and green 
channels transmission four square-wave current sources with 
different intensities are used; two of them, α1IB and α2IR, with 
different frequencies to simulate the input blue and red 
channels and the other two, α1IGpi’n and α2IGpin, with the same 
frequency but different intensities, to simulate the green 
channel due to its asymmetrical absorption across both front 
and back phototransistors. 
When the pi’npin device is reverse-biased, the base-
emitter junction of both transistors are inversely polarized 
and conceived as phototransistors, taking, so, advantage of 
the amplifier action of adjacent collector junctions which are 
polarized directly. This results in a current gain proportional 
to the ratio between both collector currents. The amplifying 
elements, α1 and α2, can provide gain if needed and attenuate 
unwanted wavelengths (<1) while amplifying (>1) desired 
ones. The values and the strategic placement of the resistors 
determine the basic shape of the output signals. So, the flow 
of current through the resistor connecting the two transistor 
bases, R1, is proportional to the difference in the voltages

across both capacitors (charge storage buckets). The device 
is formed by two reconfigurable building-blocks (the front 
and the back diodes) interconnected both optical and 
electrically, each of which has a distinct function. 
Depending on the side and wavelength of the optical bias 
control, the magnitude of the signals are changed by an α 
factor, and so the voltages across the front and the back or 
both photodiodes. The device behaves like an optoelectronic 
controlled transmission system that stores, amplifies and 
transports the minority carriers generated by the current 
pulses, through capacitors C1 and C2. 
To validate the model under front and back irradiation, in 
Fig. 9b, the experimental (solid lines) and the simulated 
(symbols) waveform under negative bias and violet front and 
back backgrounds is shown. The bit sequences to drive the 
channels are shown in the top of the figure to guide the eyes. 
To simulate the violet background, the current sources 
intensities that model the input channels (individual 
channels, Fig. 6b) were multiplied by the on/off ratio 
between the input channels with and without optical bias 
(αV
R,G,B

experimental and simulated data was achieved.

signals under front and back violet background. 
The device is formed by two reconfigurable building-
blocks (the front and the back diodes) interconnected both 
optical and electrically, each of which has a distinct 
function. Depending on the side and wavelength of the 
optical bias control, the magnitude of the signals are changed 
by an α factor, and so the voltages across the front and the 
back or both photodiodes. Under front irradiation the 
expected optical amplification in the short wavelength range 
and quenching in the long ones is observed due to the effect 
of the active multiple-feedback filter when the back diode is 
light triggered. The opposite occurs under back irradiation. 
 
VIII. CONCLUSIONS  
Combined tunable converters based on SiC multilayer 
photonics active filters are analyzed. Results show that the 
light-activated pi’n/pin a-SiC:H devices combine the 
demultiplexing 
operation 
with 
the 
simultaneous 
photodetection and self amplification of an optical signal. 
The output waveform presents a nonlinear amplitude-
dependent response to the wavelengths of the input channels. 
Depending on the wavelength of the external background it 
acts either as a short- or a long- pass band filter or as a band-
stop filter. A two stage active circuit is presented and gives 
insight into the physics of the device.
