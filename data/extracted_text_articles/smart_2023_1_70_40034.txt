Abstract—This paper compares the Electric Vehicle (EV) 
situations in Spain and Norway by looking at policy 
frameworks, infrastructural growth, adoption rates, financial 
incentives, and environmental effects. In contrast to Spain, 
which has suffered due to limited charging infrastructure, and 
a complex regulatory environment, Norway has been 
successful due to strong government support, financial 
incentives, and well-developed charging infrastructure. The 
carbon footprint of EVs is smaller in Norway thanks to the 
country's emphasis on renewable energy sources, whereas 
Spain is having trouble making the switch to clean energy. The 
comparison allows us to draw some conclusions. It also 
emphasizes the significance of a favorable policy environment, 
financial incentives, and a reliable charging infrastructure in 
promoting EV adoption. The paper suggests creating a 
national plan for Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Spain, increasing 
the availability of charging stations in urban and rural regions, 
and encouraging collaborations between the public, private 
entities, and utility companies. Norway should prioritize 
assuring the accessibility of charging infrastructure in rural 
locations, encouraging the use of second-life batteries, and 
resolving 
issues 
with 
electricity 
demand. 
By 
sharing 
experiences and adopting the necessary measures, both nations 
may hasten the transition to sustainable transportation.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Norway has the highest adoption rate of Electric Vehicles 
(EVs) per capita worldwide [1]. Spain has recently launched 
several initiatives to promote electric car adoption [2]. In this 
paper, we compare the adoption of EVs in Norway with the 
adoption in Spain. Spain is adopting some of the incentives 
shown to be effective in Norway. At the same time, Norway 
is removing some of its incentives due to the high adoption 
rate of EVs.  
An EV is a vehicle that utilizes one or more electric 
motors for propulsion. It can run autonomously using a 
battery that can be charged using various techniques, 
including solar panels, fuel cells, or generators, or it can 
receive power from an external source through a collector 
system.  
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are powered entirely by 
electricity. A BEV has no Internal Combustion Engine 
(ICE), fuel tank, or exhaust pipe. Instead, it has one or more 
electric motors powered by a large battery, which must be 
charged through an external outlet. Due to their lack of 
exhaust emissions, BEVs are regarded as the most 
ecologically beneficial form of electric car. However, they 
have a constrained driving range because the battery must be 
recharged. Several general advantages apply to EVs: 
 
• Environmental benefits: EVs do not contribute to air 
pollution or the release of greenhouse gases because they 
do not have tailpipe emissions. Even when fossil fuels are 
required to produce the energy needed to power the EV, 
it still produces less pollution than a conventional gas-
powered vehicle [3].  
• Lower operation costs: EVs require less maintenance 
since they have fewer moving parts than gasoline or 
diesel vehicles and are generally less expensive than 
those fuels. Electric motors frequently have longer 
lifespans due to their superior durability to internal 
combustion engines [4].  
• Efficiency: The power plant's efficiency will impact the 
well-to-wheel (WTW) efficacy. The overall WTW 
productivity of gasoline vehicles ranges from 12% to 
28%, whereas that of diesel cars ranges from 26% to 
38%. In contrast, EVs driven by natural gas-powered 
plants vary in WTW efficiency from 14% to 30%, while 
EVs powered by renewable energy sources exhibit up to 
70% total efficiency [5].  
• Energy independence: EVs might be powered by 
renewable energy sources like solar or wind energy. This 
reduces dependency on fossil fuels and could improve 
energy consumption sustainability [5]. 
 
The EV market differs from the typical Internal 
Combustion Engine (ICE) industry in many respects, which 
makes expanding EV service operations more challenging. 
Problems like the charging infrastructure make the EV 
market less convenient and less accessible than traditional 
gas stations, which presents difficulties for EV drivers, 
particularly when traveling large distances or in rural 
locations. Variations in charging interface standards and 
battery recharging rates make infrastructure development 
more difficult. Also, the related public policies, since the EV 
industry is still in its infancy, and public sector policies play 
a crucial role in encouraging EV adoption. Different 
taxation, carbon emissions, infrastructure for public

charging, 
incentive, 
and 
support 
for 
research 
and 
development policies are implemented by governments: EV-
specific market dynamics and uncertainty present decision-
making issues.  Business strategies are a challenge too. 
Innovative ownership models, such as battery swapping and 
EV sharing, aim to address range anxiety and high upfront 
costs. These models have been implemented in various 
cities, providing cost-effective access to EVs. A thorough 
examination of the business models is necessary for their 
successful implementation. 
The following section defines provides an overview of 
policies and regulations on EVs in Europe. Sections III and 
IV discuss electric vehicles in Norway and Spain, 
respectively. Section V compares the findings from the two 
countries, while Section VI concludes the paper. 
II. 
POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ON EVS IN EUROPE 
 The European Commission (EC) has proposed cutting 
emissions by at least 55% by 2030, with plans to increase the 
current 1.4 million EVs to 30 million by 2030 through 
regulations, targets, and initiatives such as encouraging low-
emission vehicle production and developing charging 
infrastructure. The EU's EUR 750 billion stimulus package 
includes 20 billion euros for clean vehicle sales and plans for 
1 million charging stations by 2025. This reflects the EU's 
commitment to promoting electric mobility and transitioning 
to sustainable transportation [6]. 
The European Union (EU) policy highlights the 
importance of renewable energy and smart grids for energy 
system decarbonization. A vital element of this policy is the 
Renovation Wave strategy, which focuses on integrating 
various sectors instead of treating them separately, enhancing 
the efficiency of future electrification projects. 
The EU recognizes that transportation contributes to 
almost a quarter of Europe's greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, 
promoting electric mobility (E-mobility) is crucial in 
achieving climate objectives. Therefore, efforts are underway 
to align the expansion of charging infrastructure with these 
targets. 
In her State of the Union speech, EC President Ursula 
Von der Leyen emphasized this need for integration and 
expansion, where she proposed investing one million electric 
charging points as part of the Next Generation EU initiative 
[6]. This policy indicates the EU's holistic and integrative 
approach to decarbonization and sustainable energy use. 
Some examples of recent and upcoming legislation in the EU 
are: 
Energy Efficiency Directive (EED): By 2030, the EED 
[7] aims to reduce the EU's overall energy consumption by at 
least 32.5% through energy efficiency advancements. This 
includes the transition to cleaner EVs and the enhancement 
of the efficiency of existing ones. Member states have 
introduced emission targets and awards to expedite the shift 
to e-mobility. All member states are encouraged to adopt 
ambitious transportation measures aligned with the EU's 
2030 energy efficiency target. 
EU Taxonomies: This classification scheme lists 
economically viable and ecologically sustainable activities 
vital to implement the European Green Deal and scaling 
sustainable investments. It mandates businesses seeking 
financing to document their emissions management [8]. 
The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 
(EPBD): EPBD [9] necessitates installing charging stations 
or ducting infrastructure in new or significantly renovated 
buildings. It also suggests that charging stations should be 
"smart," i.e., responsive to grid signals, offering long-term 
economic benefits for consumers and property owners. 
Electricity Directive (ED): ED, amended in 2022, [10] 
encourages 
member 
states 
to 
use 
smart 
metering 
technologies for power utilization and smart charging 
systems to ensure consumers can use, produce, store, and sell 
energy without extra charges, aiding in grid stability and 
flexibility. 
A strong message is being sent to the real estate industry 
by the Clean Energy Package and other approaching EU 
regulations: electric vehicle charging is a solution that 
addresses several issues at once. Aside from complying with 
legal standards, real estate companies must also meet the 
enormous demand for EV charging services among tenants 
and consumers. M. Kumpula-Natri, a Finnish member of the 
European Parliament, recently expressed [11]: 
“I think that now there is momentum to create a 
comprehensive and smart EV charging infrastructure with 
these many legislative proposals. I just introduced to you, 
that will be based, as much as possible, on renewables, clean 
energy and supports the demand response of the smart grids. 
So, we need smart systems and digital solutions to cut 
emissions and now the opportunities are great – there is 
finance, there is political will. Now we need everyone on 
board to make this happen.”  
III. 
ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN NORWAY   
A. History and development 
In 2016 the number of EVs reached 100,000. In 2017 the 
Norwegian Parliament decided on a national goal that all 
new cars sold by 2025 should be zero-emission. In 2022 the 
number of pure EVs reached 500,000. Norway has the 
highest adoption rate per capita worldwide [12].  
B. Charging infrastructure   
In Norway, the number of electric car charging stations 
has increased in recent years, reaching just under 19,300 for 
roughly 647,000 electric and plug-in hybrid cars registered 
as of 2021. The Type 2 or standard charger has been the 
most popular in the country. In 2021, there were about 
12,900 of this charging type in the country. In comparison, 
the number of Tesla Superchargers amounted to 1,200 that 
year. The Supercharger was introduced by Tesla to make 
fast-charging cars accessible exclusively to their models, 
such as Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X. Both were among 
the best-selling EV models in Norway [13]. 
The "charging right" for residents of apartment buildings 
was established by a parliamentary act in 2015. Still, EV 
owners believe it is crucial to have the option to fast charge 
when necessary, even if they charge at home and seldom 
need the fast charge alternative.  
33

SMART 2023 : The Twelfth International Conference on Smart Cities, Systems, Devices and Technologies

A well-planned charging network must be in place for 
more extended travels. In Norway, fast charging stations 
have been successfully installed on all major routes. By the 
end of 2022, they were trying to have more than 5,600 cars 
that can fast charge simultaneously. Customers are willing to 
pay more for the rapid charging service. On average, they 
spend three times as much on power than they do at home. 
Figure 1 shows the deployment of public EV charging 
stations by type from 2011 to 2021 [13]. According to 
nobil.no, the current number of public charging stations is 
26,258 [14]. 
 
Figure 1.  Deployment of public EV charging stations (Norway). 
C. Energy and fuel price 
Norway's average wholesale electricity price dropped to 
83 euros per megawatt-hour in March 2023, a 60% decrease 
from December 2022's record high of over EUR 246. The 
surge in 2021 and 2022 prices was due to factors like 
widespread electric heating, irregular rainfall affecting power 
plant production, new cable connections with the UK and 
Germany, and the EU market's relationship with fluctuating 
natural gas prices. 
Despite Norway's high cost of living, electricity was an 
exception until recent years. Peak demand times occur 
around 6:00 and 14:00, particularly in cold weather due to 
reliance on electric heating. Lower rainfall in the south in 
2022 affected power plant profits, while the operation of two 
new international cables in 2021 contributed 10-25% to the 
price hike. The EU's advanced bidding system and rising 
natural gas prices, influenced by COVID-19 and the Ukraine 
war, also increased electricity prices [15]. 
As shown in Figure 2, fuel prices increased in 2022 due 
to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a hike in Norway's 
CO2 taxes on fossil fuels [16]. In April 2023, gasoline and 
diesel prices stood at EUR 1.90/L and EUR 1.73/L, 
respectively. Despite these increases, EV sales have risen 
rapidly, with over 800,000 units sold by the end of 2022. 
D. Sales and adoption of EVs   
“Eight out of ten people choosing fully electric instead of 
combustion engines is a considerable step towards Norway 
reaching its climate goal of 100% BEV sales in 2025. This 
proves beyond doubt that affordable BEVs are the number 
one choice for new car owners”, said Christina Bu, Secretary 
General of The Norwegian EV Association. One-fifth of the 
Norwegian population has EVs.

"Our message to the rest of the world is crystal clear: 
Now there is no excuse for the internal combustion engines' 
unnecessary pollution when the climate crisis is so urgent to 
solve,” she said in a statement [17].

E. Government incentives and support programs 
The high adoption rate results from a comprehensive set 
of incentives encouraging the market adoption of zero-
emission automobiles. Since the early 1990s, the incentives 
have been steadily added to speed up the transition by 
several governments and large coalitions of parties.  
All new cars sold in Norway must be zero-emission 
(electric or hydrogen-powered) by 2025, according to a 
national target established by the Norwegian Parliament. 
More than 20% of Norway's registered cars by the end of 
2022 were Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). In 2022, BEVs 
held a 79.2% market share. Policy tools and various 
incentives are crucial in determining how quickly the 
transformation occurred.  
Weight, CO2, and NOx emissions are combined to 
determine the purchase tax for all new cars with emissions. 
Since the tax is progressive, big vehicles with significant 
emissions are expensive. The purchase tax has steadily 
changed over the last few years to place more emphasis on 
emissions and less on weight.  
EVs have long been excluded from VAT and Norway's 
high new-car purchase tax. But Norway will begin charging 
a 25 percent VAT on purchases costing NOK 500,000 or 
more in 2023. A new weight tax will also be in effect for all 
EVs.  
“We are unable to predict how these additional EV taxes 
would impact EV sales,” adds Christina Bu. She argues that 
the Norwegian government has to be reminded of the 
34

importance of these incentives if they are to succeed and 
continue to demonstrate to the rest of the globe that a cold 
environment and inaccessible infrastructure are not reasons 
to switch to 100% electric transportation [17].  
The following list shows incentives offered to Norwegian 
EV owners [12]: 
 
• No purchase or import tax on EVs until 2022, with a new 
purchase tax based on weight for new EVs starting in 
2023.  
• Exemption from 25% Value-Added Tax (VAT) on EV 
purchases until 2022, but from 2023, a 25% VAT will 
apply for the amount exceeding NOK 500,000. 
• No annual road tax until 2021, but reduced tax rates were 
introduced from 2021 onwards, and full tax is in effect 
from 2022.  
• EVs were previously exempt from toll road charges until 
2017, and from 2018 to 2022, a maximum of 50% of the 
total toll amount was charged for EVs. This increased to 
70% from 2023.  
• Similarly, EVs enjoyed no charges on ferries until 2017, 
and from 2018, a maximum of 50% of the total ferry fare 
was charged for EVs.  
• Free municipal parking was provided for EVs until 2017.  
• EVs had access to bus lanes since 2005, although new 
rules implemented in 2016 allow local authorities to 
restrict access to EVs carrying one or more passengers.  
• Various reductions in company car tax have been in 
place, such as a 25% reduction until 2008, a 50% 
reduction until 2017, a 40% reduction from 2018 to 2021, 
and a 20% reduction from 2022 onwards.  
• Leased EVs have been exempted from 25% VAT on 
leasing payments since 2015. 
 
The Norwegian Parliament set a national goal in 2017 for 
all new cars sold by 2025 to be zero-emission (electric or 
hydrogen).  
"Charging rights" were established in 2017 to ensure 
access to charging infrastructure for residents in apartment 
buildings.  
Public procurement rules require Zero-Emission Vehicles 
(ZEVs) for cars starting in 2022 and city buses starting in 
2025.   
IV. 
ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN SPAIN 
A. Charging infrastructure 
One of their biggest drawbacks is the need for more 
driving range in EVs compared to internal combustion 
vehicles. EVs can only become a substantial part of the 
market if their use aligns with people's normal movement 
patterns. For a vehicle to cover at least 80% of the daily 
driving profiles of regular customers in various countries, a 
range of roughly 50–60 km is required, which led to a 
battery's nominal size of 16 kWh. Therefore, the driving 
distance should be within the battery's operating range, or 
parking arrangements should permit recharging. Regarding 
the average daily driving distance in Europe, three groups of 
nations can be distinguished [19]: the first group includes 
countries that are over 70 km or even 80 km (Poland and 
Spain), the second includes nations that are around 40 km 
(UK), and the third includes countries that are between 50 
and 60 km (Example: France, Germany, and Italy). In this 
regard, if current driving habits are maintained, Spain has 
better prospects for EVs in urban areas.  
Looking through the last few years, we can see the 
evolution of Spain’s charging infrastructure.   
Starting with the charging points of public access in 
2021, this year, 4,866 points were installed, a growth four 
times less than necessary to keep pace with market growth. 
Additionally, this growth occurs at power levels associated 
with slow charging, with a maximum power of 22 kW. Just 
12% of the charging infrastructure for public access in Spain 
corresponds to loads with power greater than 22 kW [20]. 
Of the total points installed in 2021, 2,234 were in urban 
areas, which makes a total of 7,685 points in this type of 
area. On the other hand, 2,632 points were in interurban 
regions, leaving a total of 5,726 points. Table II shows the 
2021 distribution of charging points based on region and 
charging capacity [20]. 
TABLE II.  SPANISH PUBLIC CHARGING POINTS (2021) 
 
 
84% of the intercity charging points have powers less 
than 22 kW, which means long recharge times and a very 
important barrier for the consumer. Long-distance charging 
should focus on high powers as recharging points below 22

kW are unacceptable in intercity routes since using these 
points assumes a minimum recharge time of 3 hours.   
The recharge points of 250 kW (less than 15 min) were 
almost doubled throughout the year, going from 50 to 92. 
These figures are far from the forecasts, which they were 
aiming for approximately 150 points to yearend. The 92 
existing public access charging points are 350 kW and 400 
kW spread over 33 stations. Canary Islands, Cantabria, La 
Rioja, Ceuta, and Melilla don't have any charging point high 
power public access. 95% of public access charging points 
high 
power 
responds 
to 
projects 
of 
automobile 
manufacturers. The administrative difficulties associated 
with the development of these projects are one of the major 
barriers. Because of this, many projects have stopped. 
Moving forward with this study of the evolution of the 
charging infrastructure, in the last quarter of 2022, it 
increased by 1,563 recharging points (the pace of 
deployment continues to be lower than desired).   
Eight hundred ninety-three charging points have a power 
of up to 22 kW. In other words, 79% of the points of public 
access recharge are low power (up to 22 kW). This makes 14 
387 low power points (recharge time 19 - 3 hours). Long-
distance charging must focus on high power since 72% of 
the intercity points have power up to 22 kW.  
Only 52 load points between 22 and 50 kW have been 
installed. This leaves 823 points with this power (recharge 
time 3 - 1:20 hours).  
And in the last quarter of 2022, 400 recharge points 
between 50 kW and 150 kW of power compared to the 177 
installed in the third quarter (recharge time 27 - 40 min). 
This number represents 25% of the growth of the quarter. 
This makes a total of 2,220 points. Finally, between 150 kW 
and 250 kW, there are 227 points (recharge time 15- 27 min), 
442 in total [20].  
Figure 3.  Charging points for each region (Spain). 
The deployment of this type of infrastructure high power, 
which allows recharges like the refueling experience of an 
internal combustion vehicle, is essential for the proper 
growth of the electrified vehicle, even more considering that 
current technology of light-duty vehicles batteries already 
presented with power load exceeding 100 kW and shall 
rapidly increasing with the introduction of new models. It is 
also necessary for mobility associated with heavy vehicles 
that are from load powers of 150 kW already at present.  
Figure 3 shows the number of public charging points for 
each region in 2022 [21]. 
B. Energy and fuel price 
Currently, at EUR 70-80/MWh, energy prices are rising 
rapidly due to increasing gas prices, low renewable energy 
use, higher energy demand, and CO2 emission costs. Gas 
price hikes, especially caused by the instability in Ukraine 
and Russia, directly impact electricity costs. Spain's heavy 
reliance on imported energy and the resurging global 
economy has exacerbated this issue, escalating gas prices 
from EUR 10/MWh in 2020 to over EUR 100/MWh in 2022. 
Additionally, the EU's measures to reduce CO2 emissions are 
increasing consumer electricity bills. Figure 4 shows the 
increase in Spanish average energy prices since 1998 [22]. 
Energy peaks occur around 8:00 and 22:00, aligning with 
the highest demand periods. Currently, gasoline and diesel 
prices in Spain are EUR 1,637 and 1,611, respectively, 
influenced primarily by oil costs and taxes. Figure 5 shows 
the daily energy demand in Spain [23]. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Average energy price since 1998 (Spain). 
Factors impacting oil prices include OPEC's production 
limits, Russia's role in energy exports, and the conflict with 
Ukraine. Taxes account for 50% of the fuel price, with fixed 
logistics and distribution costs making up another 12%. 
Despite a 17.1% growth in the EV market in 2022, the 
total sales volume remains low at 9.63% of the general 
market, indicating the need for urgent measures to promote 
renewable energy adoption and emission reduction targets.

Figure 6.  Consumer prices of petroleum products (Spain). 
The current price of gasoline (blue line) is EUR 1.637, 
and diesel (red line) is EUR 1.611, with the corresponding 
taxes added. If we look at their evolution over the years, in 
Figure 6, we see how they have also been increasing [24].  
C. Sales and adoption of EVs  
Table III shows the numbers of registered vehicles by 
energy sources at the end of 2021 and 2022 [25]. While the 
total registrations in December 2022 decreased slightly 
compared to the previous year, the overall registrations from 
January to December 2022 increased. Gasoline vehicles had 
the highest number of registrations in 2022 (346281 
registrations), followed by diesel vehicles. However, electric 
vehicles (EVs) showed a significant increase in registrations, 
indicating a growing interest in sustainable transportation 
options. Within the EV category, Battery and Extended-
Range Electric Vehicles (BEV and E-REV) and Plug-in 
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) experienced an increase. 
Hybrid vehicles remained popular, with Hybrid Electric 
Vehicles (HEVs) dominating the category (with 243,267 
registrations). 
Hydrogen 
vehicles 
had 
minimal 
representation. These trends suggest a shift towards cleaner 
and more sustainable mobility choices, with EVs gaining 
traction in the market, going from being 30.17% of the 
market to 35.84% [25].

D. Government incentives and support programs  
Boosting EVs is essential for achieving zero-emission 
mobility by 2050. To this end, the Spanish Government has 
created a series of incentives that make purchasing EVs and 
installing 
charging 
points 
more 
feasible. 
Currently, 
incentives for electric mobility in Spain are included in 
Moves II Plan and Moves III Plan.  
The Moves II Plan was introduced in June 2020, and in 
March 2021, 20 million euros were added as several 
communities distributed all their aid. This program currently 
coexists with the Moves III Plan, which was introduced in 
April 2021 as an improved continuation of the previous one. 
The Moves III Plan will last until 2023 and aims to improve 
support for charging infrastructure for individuals and small 
and medium-sized enterprises, as well as for fast and ultra-
fast charging infrastructure.  
1) Moves II  
The program Moves II provides a set of incentives to 
promote EV adoption [26]. They depend on the engine and 
vehicle category, from EUR 600 for light electric quads to 
EUR 15,000 for purchasing trucks and electric buses. Aid for 
the purchase of EVs can reach, depending on the type of 
beneficiary, up to EUR 5,500 with scrapping, and in the case 
of commercial vehicles, up to 3,500 kg, up to EUR 6,000, 
also with scrapping.  
In the case of purchasing passenger cars for disabled 
people with reduced mobility, the amount of aid shall be 
increased by EUR 750, provided that the adaptation is 
indicated on the technical data sheet of the vehicle 
purchased.  
Regarding e-bike loan systems, the aid will be around 
30% of the eligible cost, with a ceiling of EUR 100,000.  
For the establishment of measures of Transport Plans to 
Workplaces and of measures to be carried out by 
Municipalities in urban centers to adapt mobility in a 
scenario of new demands arising from the post-COVID-19 
period, the aid will be 40% or 50% of the eligible cost, 
depending on the type of beneficiary, with a ceiling of EUR 
500,000.  
2) Moves III 
The program Moves III provides a new set of incentives 
[27]. For individuals, self-employed or administration, in the 
case of commercial up to 3,500 kg, this aid can reach up to 
EUR 7,000 (EUR 9,000 with scrapping) and up to EUR 
4,500 (EUR 7,000 with chargeable) in the case of passenger 
cars.  
The above aid amounts may be increased by 10% (not 
cumulative) in the following cases: 
 
• Purchases of passenger cars by recipients who are 
disabled persons with reduced mobility. Also, in the case 
of the acquisition of light commercial vehicles by self-
employed persons with disabilities with reduced 
mobility.  
• Vehicle purchases by persons registered in municipalities 
of less than 5,000 inhabitants (registration must be 
maintained at least two years from the date of registration 
of the application).  
37
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2023.     ISBN:  978-1-68558-071-1
SMART 2023 : The Twelfth International Conference on Smart Cities, Systems, Devices and Technologies

• Purchases of passenger cars by persons with economic 
activity (self-employed) intended for the use of taxis and 
services of transport vehicles with driver.  
 
The amount of aid in the charging infrastructure for EVs 
may be up to the following percentage of the eligible cost:  
 
• Up to 70% for self-employed individuals, communities 
of owners, and administration without economic activity 
(in the case of Municipalities <5,000 inhabitants, it will 
be 80%).  
• Companies and public entities with economic activity 
(public access recharge P ≥ 50kW): up to 35% (45% for 
medium-sized enterprises or 55% for small businesses). 
But in the case of municipalities with less than 5,000 
inhabitants, it will be up to 40% (50% for medium-sized 
enterprises or 60% for small businesses).  
• Companies and public entities with economic activity 
(public access recharge P<50kW): up to 30% (in case of 
Municipalities <5,000 inhabitants, it will be up to 40%).  
 
The five main differences between the two programs are:  
 
• Maximum help: The Moves III Plan offers a higher 
maximum help than the Moves II Plan.   
• Support for recharging infrastructure: The Moves II Plan 
offers 30 to 40% (up to a maximum of EUR 100,000) of 
the cost of purchasing and installing public and private 
chargers, while the Moves III Plan offers up to 80%.  
• 10% extra in three incentives: Unlike the Moves II Plan, 
the Moves III Plan offers 10% more aid for people with 
disabilities, self-employed using EVs as work tools, and 
holders registered in municipalities with less than 5,000 
inhabitants.  
• List of eligible vehicles: The Moves III Plan does not 
offer aid for electric trucks, buses, or gas vehicles.  
• Vehicle purchase date: The Moves III Plan focuses on 
acquisitions made as of 9 April 2021. Therefore, vehicles 
purchased before this date can only apply to Moves II 
aids. 
E. Challenges and obstacles  
The Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck 
Manufacturers (ANFAC) proposes the three challenges that 
must be faced immediately to make the mobility ecosystem's 
development possible [2]. 
 
1) Decarbonization and air quality  
Environmental concerns and stringent EU regulations on 
vehicle emissions drive manufacturers to reduce emissions. 
They've made significant technical advancements, reducing 
NOx and particle emissions by 85% and 90%, respectively, 
over 15 years, and aim for future vehicles to be carbon 
neutral. 
However, 80% of global emissions come from older 
vehicles, with the average vehicle age in 2018 being 12.4 
years, among the oldest in Western Europe. Regulations at 
various levels could promote fleet renewal, contributing to 
environmental goals. 
 
2) Deployment of infrastructure  
Implementing future vehicle infrastructure requires a 
focus on four areas: 
 
• Traffic management infrastructure: Incorporating smart 
signage, intelligent traffic systems, and 5G networks for 
autonomous vehicles. 
• Daily network infrastructure: Expanding the charging 
grid and redefining service stations due to longer 
recharge times. 
• Smart materials: Incorporating self-control, interactive 
features in roads and bridges, and photosensitive paint in 
pavements. 
• Fleet 
management: 
Modifying 
current 
parking 
infrastructure and dealership business models. 
 
3) Intelligent regulation  
Intelligent regulation must address mobility needs, ensure 
progress, propose a realistic timeline for transformation, and 
attract automotive sector investment. This requires legal 
certainty, investor and user confidence, and support for the 
sector committed to new mobility, thus creating a conducive 
framework for vehicle production and market strengthening. 
F. Roadmap for 2040  
To continue playing a relevant role in the international 
context, a framework that helps the industry to enhance its 
strengths and to devise appropriate strategies to overcome 
the challenges looming on the horizon is essential.   
This scheme [2] is presented in four temporary moments 
to advance in an orderly transition to respond to the need to 
rationalize efforts, resources, and capacities of the industry 
that will allow maintaining the competitive position of Spain. 
The Administration, at all levels, must accompany the 
industry to make this path possible, and there will be six 
pillars that must generate the necessary ecosystem for its 
development focus: 
 
1) industry and companies,  
2) the environment and energy, 
3) mobility,  
4) people,  
5) the vehicle and  
6) public-private collaboration.  
 
Figure 7 elaborates on the details of the roadmap. As it 
shows us, the action plan for the EV market in Spain from 
2020 to 2040 aims to unify the messages of all sectors and 
stakeholders 
involved, 
establish 
a 
stable 
regulatory 
framework, and optimize existing assets. By 2025, the 
objective is to attract investments, increase productivity, and 
encourage innovation-related activities, particularly in low-
emission and alternative vehicles. By 2030, the goal is to 
align the production mix with demand, adopt new business 
models, and occupy distinct market niches. By 2040, the

plan aims to fully deploy the Spanish mobility ecosystem, 
digitalize 
production 
and 
sales 
processes, 
become 
information managers, and capture value within the mobility 
ecosystem.

G. Spanish owners experience  
To know if all the incentives and efforts are working, let 
us see what the owners say by checking the official forum of 
the Electric Vehicles Users Association (AUVE).  
One of the most common topics is “Trips, routes, and 
experiences.” For traveling with an EV is essential to have a 
good plan, decide where and when to stop and charge the 
vehicle, following the next steps: 
Organize the route: Some apps will help, like ABRP (A 
Better Route Planner), used to calculate approximately 
where you must stop. Also, you can check all the available 
recharging points and their respective managers (Ionity, 
Endesa, Iberdrola, Wenea, etc.).   
Check the recharging points: The drivers check the 
charger’s condition with apps like ELECTROMAPS, which 
also include comments from other users.  
Choose the cheapest rate: The ABRP app will show the 
price of kWh for each charging station and makes it possible 
for the user to select the best alternative (like Ionity, Kia 
charger, Juicepass or Endesa, Iberdrola, etc.).  Payment can 
be made by an app or, alternatively, by card.  
This shows us all the planning needed to go on a trip. 
Other topics on the website are news, charging information, 
sports with EVs, and purchase and selling. You can also talk 
with the rest of the users to share information, ask questions, 
etc.  
Joana, an EV owner for six months and forum user, has 
shared with us her experiences where she tells us that for her 
daily life, it is perfect. 
  
“It is very efficient (I live 40 km from my work). When 
you have to consider longer distances, things get 
complicated. At the moment, I have always gone well, but it 
requires much more planning.” 
 
Regarding the difficulties that can be found with EVs, 
she tells us that they would be the purchase price and the 
complication of having a charging point at home if you do 
not have a parking space on your property; it is very 
common in Spain to have a community garage which can 
make even more difficult to install chargers. Nevertheless, 
Joana highlights the remarkable convenience of charging an 
EV at home. She describes it as a seamless process 
comparable to charging at work. Joana explains that this is 
inconsequential despite the slow charging speed since the 
vehicle remains parked for several hours, making it 
imperceptible when the charging is taking place. Home 
charging enables EV owners to integrate charging into their 
daily routines and eliminates the need for frequent visits to 
public charging stations. Since she also highlights the 
difficulties associated with public charging infrastructure, 
especially when using free charging stations. She emphasizes 
that these stations are often fully occupied, making it arduous 
for other EV owners to find an available spot. Furthermore, 
Joana expresses disappointment over the lack of empathy 
from some users who fill their batteries for as long as they 
need, disregarding the fact that public charging is a shared 
service. 
 
“Charging it at home is very comfortable, just as if you 
can at work, even if it is slow charging, the car is stopped for 
many hours, so you don't even notice when it's charging. But 
charging it on the public infrastructure is a horror. If it's 
free, it's always full and people aren't empathetic at all, they 
fill their batteries for the hours they need, without taking into 
account that it's a public service.” 
 
An important concern raised by Joana is the issue of 
overnight charging and the need for regulations. She 
observes that in her town, the only regulation is not staying 
for more than 4 hours. Consequently, many EV owners leave 
their vehicles charging overnight, taking advantage of the 
lenient guidelines. To ensure fair usage of public charging 
infrastructure, it is crucial to implement clear guidelines, 
such as limiting charging times or introducing penalties for 
prolonged stays. So, she recounts having a more positive 
experience with fast charging points provided by electric 
companies. These fast chargers offer quicker charging times, 
making them useful when immediate charging is required. 
However, Joana notes that the need for fast charging is rare, 
indicating that slow charging options are generally sufficient 
for her daily driving needs. 
 
“There is not much regulation about leaving it overnight. 
In my town, they only ask that you please not stay for more 
than 4 hours, so people leave it at night. I have had a better 
experience with fast charging points from electric 
companies, although electricity is almost the same price as 
diesel, but you rarely really need it.”  
 
In conclusion, it is imperative to recognize the need for 
continuous improvement in public charging infrastructure. 
This includes increasing the number of charging stations, 
implementing smart charging solutions to optimize usage, 
and promoting a culture of empathy and responsible 
charging behavior among EV owners. These improvements 
will provide a more seamless and accessible charging 
experience for all.

V. 
COMPARISON OF THE EVOLUTION OF EVS IN SPAIN 
AND NORWAY   
Charging Infrastructure: There are some contrasts 
between Norway's and Spain's charging infrastructure 
expansion efforts. The implementation of high-power 
charging infrastructure has been limited in Spain, where the 
growth of charging points has lagged behind the expansion 
of the market. On the other hand, Norway has a well-
established network of charging stations, including AC and 
DC fast chargers, providing quicker and more practical 
charging. This has aided in Norway's broad adoption of EVs. 
Energy and Fuel Price: Energy prices in Spain have been 
rising rapidly due to increasing gas prices, low renewable 
energy use, higher energy demand, and CO2 emission costs. 
In contrast, Norway has a significant share of renewable 
energy, mainly hydropower, which helps keep electricity 
prices relatively stable and lower than Spain. This has made 
EVs more cost-effective for Norwegian consumers. 
Sales and Adoption of EVs: Electric vehicle acceptance 
and sales have increased in Spain and Norway. In contrast to 
Spain, Norway has achieved a far higher market penetration 
of electric automobiles. With a market share of more than 
80% in 2022, EVs represented an essential percentage of 
new car registrations in Norway. Spain's market share of 
EVs remained low in 2022, representing just 9.63% of all 
recent car sales. 
Government Incentives and Support Programs: Spain 
and Norway have implemented incentives and support 
programs to promote electric vehicle adoption. Moves II and 
III in Spain offer financial incentives for purchasing EVs and 
installing charging infrastructure. In contrast, Norway offers 
tax exemptions, toll discounts, free parking, and a 
comprehensive charging infrastructure until 2023. These 
incentives and infrastructure developments have played a 
key role in driving the high adoption rate of EVs in Norway. 
Challenges and Obstacles: The necessity for effective 
regulation, the decarbonization of the vehicle fleet, and 
adequate infrastructure present issues for Spain. 2040 plan 
tries to deal with these problems. Norway must maintain 
charging stations and ensure the energy grid can handle the 
rising demand. It is crucial to control the market's impact on 
the nation's finances and maintain its continuing growth and 
prosperity. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS   
Recap of key findings: Spain and Norway have made 
efforts to promote electric vehicle adoption, but Norway has 
achieved a significantly higher market penetration of EVs 
due to government incentives, charging infrastructure 
availability, and energy prices. Spain has faced challenges in 
expanding its charging infrastructure, particularly in 
deploying high-power charging points, while Norway 
benefits from a stable and relatively low-cost renewable 
energy supply. This disparity can be attributed to 
government incentives, charging infrastructure availability, 
and energy prices. 
Lessons learned and recommendations: The findings 
have led to lessons being learned, and suggestions can be 
made to enhance the EV industry and charging infrastructure 
in both nations. To make EVs more appealing and 
accessible, Spain should take a page from Norway's strategy 
and 
prioritize 
constructing 
high-power 
charging 
infrastructure, boosting government subsidies, and raising its 
investment in renewable energy sources. To achieve a 
smooth transition to electric mobility, public-private 
cooperation should be encouraged in both nations, utilizing 
the knowledge of diverse EV ecosystem stakeholders. 
Dispelling EV myths and misconceptions, addressing range 
anxiety issues, and emphasizing the advantages of electric 
mobility for the environment and the economy can all be 
accomplished through education and awareness campaigns. 
Potential areas for improvement in each country: To 
bolster the EV market, nations need targeted strategies. In 
Spain, quickening the rollout of high-power charging 
infrastructure across all regions, boosting government 
incentives, and lowering energy prices can make EVs more 
affordable. In contrast, Norway must focus on expanding and 
upkeeping its charging network due to rising EV demand, 
vigilantly track the financial implications of EV incentives, 
and devise innovative solutions for surging electricity 
demand. 
By implementing these recommendations, Spain and 
Norway can foster the development of their respective EV 
markets and promote sustainable transportation methods. 
These actions can significantly contribute to their national 
goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A collaborative 
effort involving the government, private sector, and citizens 
is crucial to facilitate the transition toward electric mobility. 
This transition, in turn, could bring about substantial long-
term environmental benefits and help both countries meet 
their commitments under international climate agreements.
