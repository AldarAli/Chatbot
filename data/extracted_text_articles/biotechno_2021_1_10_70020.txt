Abstract—Sickle cell disease is a global health problem, a 
genetic disease which affects many people, particularly 
common among those whose ancestors came from sub-Saharan 
Africa. All individuals with sickle cell disease experience 
anemia which increases the morbidity and mortality. This 
research aims to identify genetic variants associated with 
anemia in individuals with sickle cell disease. In the long-term 
this will contribute towards efforts to improve the life 
expectancy of individuals by quickly identifying single 
nucleotide polymorphisms related to anemia in sickle cell 
disease and enabling better prediction of the severity of anemia 
that the individual will experience which enable better 
preventive treatment. Quality control of the Genome Wide 
Association Studies data and association between anemia and 
the genotype data were performed using PLINK software and 
will be presented. Designing of imputation and replication 
study of the Genome Wide Association Studies data is in 
progress. 
The 
analysis 
will 
identify 
single 
nucleotide 
polymorphisms and genes linked to anemia in individuals with 
sickle cell disease. The results can also be compared with single 
nucleotide polymorphisms candidates from other studies.

INTRODUCTION 
Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is inherited genetic disorder 
caused by mutation in the hemoglobin (HBB) gene. SCD is 
a major public health concern [1]. Worldwide, it is 
estimated that majority of the 275,000 babies born with 
SCD annually are in sub-Saharan Africa [2]. The burden of 
SCD in Tanzania is high where it is estimated that 11,000 
children are born with SCD annually [3]. SCD causes 
shortage of healthy Red Blood Cells (RBC) due to the 
polymerization of the RBCs into a sickle shaped red blood 
cells. These aggregate in small blood vessels and slow or 
block blood flow and oxygen initiating vaso-occlusion. 
Individuals with SCD become anemic because the sickle 
shaped cells have a short life (10-20 days) unlike normal 
RBCs which live for 120 days.  
Despite the similarity in the origin of the disease, 
individuals demonstrate varying symptoms and severity. 
Our previous studies confirmed known and identified new 
genetic variants associated with fetal hemoglobin [4] and 
liver function (manuscript write-up ongoing). Other studies 
[5, 6] have also identified genetic variants associated with 
different phenotypes observed in individuals with SCD, 
however much of the variation in phenotype is yet to be 
explained.  
 Anemia in SCD increases the morbidity and mortality of 
individuals. Considering the amount of hemoglobin (Hb) as 
one variable, non-SCD individuals have a normal range of 
13.5-17.5 grams per deciliter (adult men) and 12-15.5 grams 
per deciliter (adult women). In our database SCD 
individuals have an average of 8 grams per deciliter. 
Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) involve 
studying a set of genetic variants in different individuals to 
see if any variant is associated with a trait by investigating 
the entire genome of each individual. This study aims to 
identify genetic variants associated with anemia in 
individuals with sickle cell disease using a database of 
GWAS data for 1952 individuals with SCD in Tanzania.  
The methodology used to identify the markers will be 
presented in Section II, followed by the results of the 
analysis in Section III. Discussion and conclusion of the 
research will be presented in Sections IV and V, 
respectively.

METHODOLOGY
A.  Sampling of subjects and data collection  
The phenotype data contains clinical, laboratory and 
demographic information. Some of these parameters were 
used in this analysis. Data of 1952 individuals diagnosed 
with SCD from a cohort have been genotyped. Samples 
were collected, DNA extracted and genotyped. These 
individuals are part of the Muhimbili Sickle Cohort 
recruited at Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam, 
Tanzania. Full details are provided in [4]. Samples were 
typed on the Illumina Human Omnichip 2.5 platform.  
B.  Quality control of the genotype data and Association 
Standard technical Quality Control (QC) of the data was 
performed using PLINK software to remove possible 
sources of technical and genetic bias [7]. This includes 
removing missing data, duplicates and individuals and 
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) failing QC.

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and the association 
of the phenotype (Hb) to the QC genotype were done by 
using PLINK software. 
C. Genotype imputation and replication study 
   Genotype imputation is a statistical inference of 
unobserved genotypes which is performed on SNPs using 
known haplotypes in a population such as 1000 Genomes 
Project in humans. Genotype imputation is underway. 
Replication in GWAS studies is performed to confirm the 
phenotype-genotype 
association 
results 
by 
providing 
statistical evidence and rule out associations due to biases. 
Designing of replication and imputation study of GWAS 
data is in progress.

RESULTS 
Fig. 1 shows the relationship of the quality-controlled 
genotype data from our study to other populations. 
Our study population (blue dots) is admixture, most of 
individuals cluster with individuals of African ancestry 
while few individuals deviate from the cluster. The 
individuals deviating from the cluster are of Arabic and 
Indian origin.

DISCUSSION 
The analysis showed that the SNPs associated with 
anemia are present in the genes that are co-expressed. 
Individuals with sickle cell anemia experience anemia and 
frequent infections, this activates the immune response in 
individuals in order to fight the infections. The SNPs that 
significantly associated with anemia are found in the genes 
(Table.1) which function in cell-cell adhesion, antigen 
receptor-mediated signaling pathway, immune response-
activating cell surface receptor signaling pathway and T cell 
receptor signaling pathway These functions are associated 
with immune response in humans; it is common for immune 
system to respond when the human body gets infected.  
Other SNPs that significantly associate with anemia are 
found in the genes (Table.1) that function in hindbrain 
development 
and 
central 
nervous 
system 
neuron 
differentiation. This is expected in individuals with sickle 
cell anemia because they experience episodes of pain as 
well as developmental delays.  
Unfortunately, the SNP found to be mostly significant 
associated with anemia (Fig. 2) at chromosome 3 and 7 have 
not been annotated hence the functions are not known.  
Fig. 2 shows the SNPs (red and blue dots, the p-values on 
the y-axis) and chromosome in which the SNPs belong on 
the x-axis.

individuals with SCD are in Table 1.

It is our hope that the completion of replication and 
imputation analysis will reveal more and significant 
associations.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This study indicated genetic markers (SNPs) that 
associate with anemia in individuals with SCD. This is the 
first step towards developing a tool that will quickly identify 
the markers linked to anemia in SCD individuals which is 
an important step in improving preventive treatment of these 
individuals. Similar analysis has to be extended in same and 
different sickle cell disease cohorts in order to identify new 
and confirm the variants linked to anemia in individuals 
with SCD.
