Abstract— Network slicing for 5th Generation (5G) networks 
enables the support of multiple logical networks, called slices, 
which aim to be tailor-cut network solutions for specific 
services for the vertical industries (e.g., transportation, smart 
factories, health industry etc.). Although, considerable effort 
has been taken to define the generic framework for network 
slices, it still remains open how the network performance can 
be further optimized by taking into consideration the 
specificities of each use case.   At the same time, the work for 
the specification of network functions to support autonomous 
driving is picking up speed. However, up to this moment, it is 
still not addressed how contextual information can serve the 
optimization of a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) slice. This paper 
provides in detail the latest status of the 3GPP standardization 
process related to slicing. It also introduces two new 
mechanisms called Context Enhanced MOBility management 
(CEMOB) 
and 
Context-Aware 
Resource 
Pre-allocation 
(CARP). 
The 
former 
improves 
the 
existing 
mobility 
management process while the latter serves the minimization 
of the communication delay among vehicles. The point we 
make with these two mechanisms is that by taking advantage 
of contextual information the performance of network control 
functions can be significantly improved. Towards this end, we 
quantify the merits of our mechanisms and we present how 
these are integrated into a V2X slice.  
Keywords-network slicing; mobility management; pre-
allocation of resources; V2X communications. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Using contextual information for future mobile networks 
has become lately a hot topic [1]. 5G networks target, apart 
from the support of the telecommunications sector, also the 
communication 
needs 
of 
“vertical 
industries” 
like 
autonomous driving in transportation, smart factories, new 
health services, etc. An extensive list of 5G use cases can be 
found in [2] and [3]. A thorough examination of the verticals 
has identified that these sectors have diverse requirements. 
These requirements are mapped to different network Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs). The KPIs indicatively 
include throughput, transmission reliability, latency, energy 
consumption, blocking probability, etc. Services and 
applications for the vertical industries have different 
requirements 
and 
thus, 
different 
values 
for 
the 
aforementioned KPIs. It is widely accepted that no single 
network can support efficiently all these different use cases. 
Thus, it appears that the deployment of parallel logical 
networks over the same network infrastructure is a necessity. 
These logical networks may have network functions (NFs) 
configured differently or even introduce new network 
functions both in the Radio Access Network (RAN) [4] as 
well as the Core Network (CN) [5]. 
The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has 
defined a network slice to be “ A logical network that 
provides 
specific 
network 
capabilities 
and 
network 
characteristics” [6]. A “Network Slice” is implemented by a 
“slice instance” that in its turn is created by a “network slice 
template”. The latter is a template that defines a complete 
logical network including the NFs, their interfaces and their 
corresponding resources.  
Network slicing has been intensively investigated during 
the past years both by industry and academia. There are 
several research proposals that target full flexibility in terms 
of selecting, organizing and deploying NFs [7]. At the same 
time, 3GPP has already delivered the first phase 
specifications for 5G networks that include also the support 
for slicing. The standardization activities have followed a 
sensible path and have re-used existing NFs or share NFs 
across different slices as much as possible, focusing 
essentially on the enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) 
slice. The use cases to be supported, as well as their 
requirements, have been thoroughly studied [8], but current 
specifications do not provide fully tailor-cut solutions for 
them. In order to do this, it is needed to work really closely 
with the representatives of the so called “vertical industries” 
(e.g., transportation, health, factories, energy). This is needed 
to understand not only the requirements and the operational 
environment, but also the contextual information produced 
and how this can be used to optimize network functions.  
For example, the newly founded 5G Automotive 
Association (5GAA) [9] is working towards such a direction. 
Still, the activities for proposing mechanisms driven by such 
organizations, that are expected to affect the standardization 
process, are in primitive steps.  
In the current paper, extending our previous work 
presented in [1], we present the latest status of the 
standardization activities related to network slicing. We also

provide 
two 
novel 
mechanisms 
for 
vehicular 
communications, which can be easily deployed using slicing 
solutions. The first one is a new mobility management 
mechanism for autonomously driven vehicles. It takes 
advantage of contextual information that is possible to be 
used by the standardized 5G NFs. The second is a resource 
pre-allocation scheme that uses available contextual 
information to meet the stringent requirements of certain 
V2X use cases, by minimizing the communication delay 
among vehicles. These are exemplary schemes to highlight 
that different use cases need very different solutions. Thus, 
we believe that it is important that solution providers take 
into consideration the specificities of each use case. We also 
present how the new mechanisms can be supported by 5G 
networks.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, we provide the latest status of 3GPP in relation to slicing. 
Section III discusses how mobility management is planned to 
be supported in the technical specifications and why we 
consider this not to be efficient for moving vehicles. In 
Section IV, we provide the details of CEMOB on how to 
extend the 5G network functions to improve mobility 
management for moving vehicles. In Section V, we present 
quantitative results that illustrate the benefits of our scheme. 
In Section VI, we discuss how the allocation of resources 
takes place in 5G networks and what is the expected delay, 
while in Section VII we present the CARP mechanism, that 
minimizes the communication delay among vehicles and we 
analyse its performance improvements. In Section VIII, we 
summarize the key findings of the paper. Finally, Section IX 
concludes the paper and describes future directions.  
II. 
SLICE SUPPORT IN 3GPP 
3GPP has decided to treat 5G specifications in two 
phases. The first one is just recently completed (Release 15). 
This phase addresses a more urgent subset of the commercial 
needs. Phase 2 is to be completed by March 2020 (Release 
16) for the IMT 2020 submission, having addressed all 
identified use cases & requirements. In relation to slicing, 
several working groups are currently progressing on the key 
elements and procedures that have to be specified. 
In [6] and [10], the 5G network architecture is presented. 
There, a list of technical key issues, as well as potential 
solutions for slicing are presented. For example, in these 
documents the issues of slice selection, slice isolation, 
sharing of NFs among slices, multi-slice connectivity, 
management of slices, etc. are being addressed. 
The first set of specifications has addressed a number of 
key principles. The first principle is that NFs, previously 
incorporated into monolithic network components, are now 
decomposed to smaller modules. The target is to allow a 
synthesis and configuration of the NFs on a per slice type 
basis. A second principle is the further splitting of user and 
control plane functions to facilitate a more flexible evolution 
of NFs. A third key principle is the exposure of NFs to 
external services through appropriate APIs. This is expected 
to allow a better collaboration among network operators and 
service providers. 
Figure 1 presents a summary of the supported NFs. The 
control plane functions in the CN are considered to be the 
following: 
- Unified Data Management (UDM): supports the 
Authentication Credential Repository and Processing 
Function (ARPF).  
- 
Authentication Server Function (AUSF): supports 
the authentication of end users  
- 
Policy Control function (PCF): supports unified 
policy framework to govern network behaviour and 
provides policy rules to control plane functions  
- 
Core Access and Mobility Management Function 
(AMF): supports mobility management, access 
authentication and authorization, security anchor 
functions and context management 
- 
Session Management Function (SMF). supports 
session management, selection and control of UP 
functions, downlink data notification and roaming  
- 
User Plane Function (UPF): is the anchor point for 
inter/intra RAT mobility, supports packet routing and 
forwarding, QoS handling for user plane, packet 
inspection and policy rule enforcement 
- 
Network Exposure Function (NEF): provides a 
means to securely exchange information between 
services and 3GPP NFs.  
- 
NF Repository Function (NRF): maintains the 
deployed 
NF 
Instance 
information 
when 
deploying/updating/removing NF instances 
-   Network 
Slice 
Selection 
Function 
(NSSF): 
supports the functionality to bind a UE with a 
specific slice.

Note that some of these functions are common for all 
slices, while others can be dedicated for different slices. A 
User Equipment 
(UE) may access multiple slices 
concurrently via a single RAN. For such cases, it is assumed 
that the involved slices should share some control plane 
functions, like the AMF. The abovementioned logical 
network allows the support of Application Functions (AF) 
and provides connectivity to typical external data networks. 
Moreover, it has been agreed that RAN will be slice-
aware so as to treat slice traffic according to the customer 
needs. Moreover, RAN shall support resource isolation 
among slices so as to avoid shortage of shared resources in

one slice to break the service level agreement on another 
[11].  
Detailed alternative solutions have been proposed on 
how RAN is involved in slice selection by passing an 
appropriate identifier to the core network elements. 
Currently, slicing for RAN essentially focuses on different 
scheduling schemes for various slices and also by providing 
different L1/L2 configurations. Moreover, it is considered 
that even if a UE is connected to multiple slices, a single 
Radio Resource and Control (RRC) entity will be used. 
Other radio access protocols (i.e., Packet Data Convergence 
Protocol – PDCP and Radio Link Control - RLC) can used 
on a per slice basis. 
Every slice is identified by a Single Network Slice 
Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI) identifier. This 
identifier consists of a Slice/Service Type (SST) and a Slice 
Differentiator (SD). The former defines essentially the 
features and network services to be offered by a slice, while 
the latter is used to select among different slices of the same 
type. Currently, only 3 SST values have been agreed to be 
supported. These are a) eMBB, b) Massive Internet of 
Things (MIoT), and c) Ultra Reliable Low Latency 
Communications (URLLC) [6]. This information is 
exchanged as part of non-access stratum signalling through 
the RAN.  
In [12], the life cycle of a network slice is described by 
the following phases: a) Preparation phase, b) Instantiation, 
Configuration and Activation phase, c) Run-time phase and 
d) Decommissioning phase.  
Overall, 3GPP has defined the framework for slice 
deployment, operation and selection. However, there are no 
detailed solutions about how each slice type will be different 
from another. This is crucial gap that has to be addressed. In 
order to achieve the desired performance for each slice, new 
mechanisms are needed. These mechanisms must take 
advantage of the characteristics and the environment where 
the slices for the vertical industries will be used. As we will 
present in the following chapters, taking advantage of 
contextual information of autonomously driven vehicles 
(e.g., the street geography, the path to be followed by a 
vehicle), one can improve considerably control functions like 
mobility management and decrease the communication delay 
for critical services like collaborative collision avoidance. 
III. 
CURRENT STATUS FOR MOBILITY MANAGEMENT IN 5G 
NETWORKS 
Mobility management for legacy systems is performed as 
follows. The network is divided into non-overlapping 
regions called Tracking Areas (TAs). Idle UEs have to 
inform the network each time they cross the border of such 
areas or when a timer, typically set at 54 minutes, expires. 
However, this design was initially static and the cost for re-
arranging the coverage areas of TAs was quite high. 
Moreover, a problem appeared from excessive Tracking 
Area Update (TAU) messages due to the movement of the 
users near the TA borders. That is why the notion of 
Tracking Area Lists (TAL) was introduced. TALs were 
assigned on per UE basis and allowed the overlapping of 
TAs. The algorithm to define the TAL is proprietary and the 
operator decides according to his strategy whether to allocate 
large or short TALs for each UE. Whenever a UE has to be 
discovered (e.g., delivering data to it, incoming call etc.), 
paging is executed in a subset or all the cells inside a TAL 
according to the operator’s strategy [13]. If a subset of the 
cells of the TAL is paged there is a risk of increased delay 
due to page misses. On the other hand, if all the cells are 
paged, there is an increased signalling cost. The size of the 
TAL relates to a signalling tradeoff. Small TALs have 
reduced paging signalling cost but require frequent TAU. If 
large TALs are used, the signalling cost is high but fewer 
TAU notifications are needed. 
Even with these improvements, it has been noticed that 
whenever idle UEs switch into connected mode, signalling 
has again to be exchanged up to the core network and more 
specifically the Mobility Management Entity (MME) in 4G 
networks or the AMF in 5G networks. Inside the MME or 
AMF, contextual information for each UE (such as security 
credentials) is kept. Considering that smartphones have a 
number of applications (e.g., Facebook, Skype, Viber, etc.) 
that wake up asynchronously and exchange small amount of 
information, this creates a significant signalling load for the 
aforementioned network components. 
This is why, for the 5G systems mobility for idle 
terminals had to be redesigned [11]. In the latest 
specifications, the RAN-based Notification Area (RNA) has 
been defined. This can be considered as a smaller subset of a 
TAL and consists of a number of base stations (called gNBs 
in 5G terminology). While inside an RNA, an idle UE can 
move from one gNB to another, without informing the 
network about its exact location. Also, a new state called 
RRC_INACTIVE is introduced. Whenever a UE is in this 
state, then its context information is kept locally at its last 
serving gNB. Thus, a UE avoids contacting the CN entities 
(i.e., AMF) whenever the UE switches again to the 
connected mode. This addresses the needed minimization of 
signalling load caused by the frequent waking-up of end 
devices (e.g., smartphones) towards the CN.  
If the UE wakes up and becomes connected under a new 
gNB 
inside 
the 
same 
RNA, 
then 
it 
uses 
the 
RRCConnectionResume message to force the new gNB 
retrieve its context from the last serving gNB. The new gNB 
may also trigger a path switching by communicating with the 
AMF. Paging a UE takes place from the last serving gNB to 
all gNBs that are members of the RNA.  These procedures 
are illustrated in Figure 2. On top of these messages, note 
that whenever a UE crosses the RNAs borders it needs to 
receive the gNBs identifiers that are members of the new 
RNA. 
This 
mechanism 
treats 
indeed 
several 
of 
the 
inefficiencies present in existing cellular systems like 4G 
mobile networks. However, as explained in [14], the RAN 
based mobility management scheme suffers from excessive 
load for high moving UEs. This is why, Hailu and Säily [14] 
suggest a hybrid scheme where a typical CN mobility 
management takes places for high moving UEs, while a RAN 
based mobility management is executed for slow moving 
UEs. To achieve this, the UEs have to report their mobility 
status to the CN at some intervals or during specific events

(e.g., during location update). Moreover, the authors also 
indicate potential delay issues that may arise if there is no 
direct interface between the last serving gNB and the new 
one. In such a case, signalling between gNBs has to travel 
through the CN. The lack of a direct link between base 
stations is not uncommon in commercially deployed mobile 
networks. Note that in the current standard specification both 
the typical CN as well as the RAN mobility management 
scheme are supported. 
 
 
Figure 2: RAN based mobility management (adapted from [11]) 
Based on the above discussion, it is clear that the 
adoption of the RAN based mobility management scheme 
will be beneficial for some of the 5G use cases but inefficient 
for others. An example of a non-applicable use case is the 
one of the autonomously driving vehicles. This is because 
vehicles are expected to change their velocities quite often 
when moving for example inside an urban environment. 
Having the vehicles reporting their mobility status 
frequently, it will cause an excess signalling overhead to the 
network. On the other hand, the CN mobility management 
scheme will also suffer, as we have explained, from 
frequently awaking vehicles that will want to exchange 
information with their neighbours for a short period (e.g., to 
perform a manoeuvre). To optimize a control procedure like 
mobility management for moving vehicles, one has to take 
advantage of contextual information that can be easily 
available to the operator as we will discuss in the next 
section. 
IV. 
CEMOB: CONTEXT ENHANCED MOBILITY 
MANAGEMENT 
A. Algorithm Description 
Autonomous driving is one of the key targets of the 
industry for the next decade. 3GPP has already specified an 
architecture and the related mechanisms to support inter-
vehicle communication as well as their access to service 
specific servers (i.e., V2X application server - [15]). The 
support of such services introduces additional contextual 
information that if used, it can greatly improve the network 
control operations for a mobile network. More specifically, it 
is expected that in order to form a route, a vehicle will 
communicate with a server to receive the path to be 
followed. These servers can also estimate the time a vehicle 
will need to be at a certain position in the path. Such 
functionality exists even today with well-established 
applications like Google maps or any other GPS navigators. 
Obviously, these applications are unaware about the 
deployed base stations of a mobile operator. However, for 
5G networks passing a route information to an operator, it is 
going to be an easy task to perform.  
As we discussed in Section II, the NEF allows for 
Service providers (e.g., Google maps) to communicate this 
path the mobile network in a secure way. A translation 
function is then able to transform path coordinates to a list of 
gNBs that will serve the UEs when they reach specific areas 
at specific times. Furthermore, the specific geography of the 
roads can significantly assist in determining the exact cells a 
vehicle is going to pass through. Such information can be 
used to considerably optimize the mobility management 
procedure by optimizing the TALs allocation and at the same 
time improving the paging strategy. Additionally, the 
modularization of 5G network functions facilitates their 
optimum placement in the RAN or CN network components. 
For the V2X case it makes sense to keep part of the mobility 
management functionality close the moving vehicles (i.e., at 
the gNBs), since unnecessary frequent communication with 
CN entities like the AUSF can be avoided. 
 
 
Figure 3: Mobility management for vehicles in 5G networks  
In Figure 3 we present how a new mobility management 
scheme called CEMOB (Context Enhanced MOBility 
management). It is designed especially for vehicles operating 
inside 5G networks.  
Whenever a UE/vehicle wants to reach a specific 
destination, it will communicate with a V2X application 
server and it will receive the path so as the computer inside 
the car will start the autonomous driving functions (step 1). 
Upon calculation of such a path by the V2X application 
server, the information in terms of coordinates and 
timestamps (time when the vehicle will be at a specific point) 
can be communicated to the mobile operator. This will take 
place through the NEF entity (step 2). The NEF can also 
translate the coordinates into specific gNBs and forward 
further this information to the involved AMFs (step 3). 
These entities on their turn can transfer the UE context to the 
involved gNBs (step 4). Moreover, they will communicate

with the corresponding SMFs so as to pre-configure the data 
path for the vehicles (steps 5 and 6). Note that this pre-
configuration does not imply that resources will be allocated 
for large period of times but rather only for a short time for 
which a vehicle is expected to be in a certain area. 
Obviously, it is possible that a vehicle (or the respective 
V2X application server) may be required, due to traffic 
conditions, to modify and re-calculate a path. Such 
information will again be communicated through the NEF 
entity and the new information will be passed to all involved 
gNBs.  
Note that the communication of a UE with a V2X 
application server located inside the domain of the mobile 
operator, can take place in terms of a few tenths of 
millisecond [16]. Thus, any updating of network components 
by the server will take place very rapidly. During such short 
time, a vehicle will not have changed its position no more 
than a few meters. So, any mobility management action, like 
paging is not going to be seriously affected. 
Although Figure 3 illustrates the placement of the AMF 
inside the CN, part of its functionality can be placed in the 
gNBs. Consider for example the case where a UE/vehicle 
wants to communicate with a neighbouring one inside its 
own RNA. If part of the AMF functionality is placed at the 
gNB level, the communication request will stop at the 
serving gNB of the calling UE. The serving gNB’s mobility 
management function will perform the paging to the called 
UE/vehicle. To do this, it will send a paging message to its 
cell as well the neighbouring ones, since it is already aware 
of the vehicles that are under the RNA vicinity during a 
specific time. 
Since the actual location of the communicating UEs is 
well known with a pretty good accuracy, there is no need to 
communicate with the CN NFs to acquire a larger searching 
area (i.e., TAL). Also, there is no need for transferring the 
UEs’ context information in the RAN in a reactive manner. 
This information is pre-fetched in the gNBs during the 
execution of step 4, as presented in Figure 3. 
The benefits of CEMOB are manifold. Firstly, the 
mechanism is fully optimized for moving UEs independently 
of their speed. Firstly, it is not necessary to communicate 
with the network the UE’s mobility status. Also, tt is not 
necessary to revert to the typical CN mobility management 
scheme if a vehicle’s speed is high and the network 
signalling reaches a high paging load. Similarly, there is no 
need to switch to the RAN based mobility management 
scheme at a low moving speed.  
Secondly, there is no need to exchange control messages 
for UE location updates (i.e., TAU) over the wireless 
interface which is the bottleneck for any wireless system. 
Note that the execution of a typical TAU message exchange 
requires the communication of a considerable number of 
signalling messages as described in [10].  
In the case of CEMOB, the delay for transferring the 
context information of a UE from a serving to a new gNB is 
zero, since this information is in place beforehand. This 
delay in the RAN based mobility management scheme can 
be significant, as we have already explained for the cases 
where the gNBs have no direct interface and their 
communication takes place through the CN.  
The paging cost for CEMOB is significantly lower than 
the CN and the RAN based mobility management schemes. 
The already known geography of the streets can minimize 
the number of cells that need to be paged only to the few 
ones that are serving street segments. All the aforementioned 
benefits are possible because CEMOB takes advantage of 
service related contextual information that can be available 
to the NFs of the mobile operator in a standardized way. 
Finally, note that the modularized architecture and the 
slice support allow different NFs to be used for different 
logical networks (i.e., slices) and even place them at different 
network components. This means that CEMOB may be used 
only for the V2X communications network slice. Other 
slices, like the eMBB may use the existing solutions for 
mobility. This is possible since network slices can be 
configured differently for each use case. 
B. Performance Analysis 
To evaluate the performance of CEMOB we compare it 
with the CN and RAN based mobility management schemes. 
In order to calculate the signalling cost during paging, we 
follow the analysis presented in [14]. Let M be the number of 
cells and N the number of gNBs. As an exemplary analysis, 
we consider 3 cells to be supported by a single gNB. The 
RAN based scheme requires M messages to be transmitted 
over the radio link, plus N-1 messages to be transmitted from 
the last serving gNB to the neighbouring gNBs located inside 
the same RNA. As for the CN based mobility management 
scheme, M messages need to be transmitted over the radio 
interface. Additionally, N messages will be sent from the CN 
to the gNBs as well as 6 additional messages are exchanged 
on a per UE basis to inform the CN NFs that a UE is 
currently in the RRC_INACTIVE state [10]. 
 
 
Figure 4: Paging cost CEMOB vs. RAN based vs CN based  
Concerning CEMOB, the knowledge of the position of a 
UE with a high accuracy, even under some time coarse time 
period, requires paging only the gNB where the vehicle is 
camped under it. Also, knowing the topology of the streets 
and the direction of the vehicle, it is easy to make sure that 
there will be no page miss, by also paging the previous and 
the following gNBs from the estimated camped gNB.

Considering an inter site distance among gNBs of even 
500m, the vehicle is paged in an area of 1.5 km that makes 
the probability of success rather high.  
As shown in Figure 4, as long as the number of gNBs 
increases, the signalling reduction gain of the RAN-based 
mobility management scheme, compared to CN based one, is 
rather low. On the other hand, CEMOB outperforms these 
two schemes considerably since we take advantage of the 
accurate information about the location of the UE/vehicle 
CEMOB’s relative gain is improved when the number of 
gNBs in an area increases since the baseline mobility 
management schemes need to page a larger number of gNBs. 
To estimate the number of messages to be exchanged 
during a location update we perform the following analysis. 
As shown in Figure 2, for the RAN based scheme, 7 
messages need to be exchanged every time a UE crosses the 
border of an RNA or when it resumes an RRC connection in 
a gNB that is different from the last serving gNB. A similar 
number of messages is needed for the CN based scheme, but 
this time the communication takes places between a gNB and 
AMF, instead of the last serving gNB. For the CEMOB case, 
the UE context needs to be transferred to all gNBs of an area 
before the UE enters into it. Also, in case a UE selects with a 
probability p, a different path for any reason, then it will 
communicate again with the V2X application server and the 
context will have to be updated again to all the gNBs of an 
area. 
To perform an evaluation of CEMOB for the signalling 
load we consider an area of 15 gNBs containing 3 RNAs. 
We also consider that a street has two lanes. According to 
[17], the vehicle traffic flow with measurement at a point is 
“the number of vehicles that passes a point on a highway or a 
given lane or direction of a highway during a specific time 
interval”. Traffic flow q is expressed in vehicles/hour and is 
given by: 
 
𝑞 =
𝑛𝑡
𝑡  
() 
where nt is the number of vehicles passing a particular point 
in a defined period t. Related to the flow of vehicles the 
space headway parameter can also be used to derive q [17]. 
The average space headway ℎ𝑠
̅̅̅ is defined as the distance 
measured between the front ends of two successive vehicles 
(as the sum of the vehicles’ in-between space and a vehicle’s 
length). Based on this parameter the traffic flow can be 
calculated as: 
 
𝑞 = 
𝑣̅
ℎ𝑠
̅̅̅̅ 
() 
where the flow q is calculated as the average speed 𝑣̅ of the 
vehicles divided by their average space headway. Based on 
this, we are able to calculate the traffic flow of vehicles 
passing through the 3 RNAs border areas per hour. Our 
assumption is that for the baseline schemes (i.e., CN and 
RAN based), a UE will resume its connection once every 5 
cells. Having also a fixed road topology and assuming a 
uniform distribution of vehicles with fixed space headway 
distance among them, it is easy to calculate the number of 
vehicles in this area. Using this number, we can select a 
probability that some of the vehicles will change their path, 
so CEMOB will have to update all the gNBs of an RNA.  
Figure 5 presents the results for different vehicle speeds 
(from 20 to 60km/h) and different space headways (from 4.5 
to 22.5 meters). For this experiment, we consider that every 
30 sec the 20% of the vehicles will request a path update. 
As seen from the figure, CEMOB significantly 
outperforms the baseline schemes. The reason is that the on-
demand context transfer requires a lot of signalling even if 
this is requested from one gNB to another inside an RNA. In 
such cases, the CN has to be notified so that path switching 
is performed.  
On the other hand, CEMOB has to notify the gNBs only 
once and pre-configure the RAN-CN communication path at 
the same time. For a small number of cells, even for the 
exemplary topology under consideration, this means a 
considerable signalling reduction. Although CEMOB needs 
to update the gNBs every time a UE changes its path, this 
cost can be minimized by selecting a subset of gNBs to be 
updated at a time (e.g., only the time relevant part of the end-
to-end path). In the case of the baseline schemes, the 
signalling cost is heavily affected by a complex process that 
may take place every time a UE is paged or whenever it 
switches from and idle to a connected state. 
 
 
Figure 5: Signaling comparison between CEMOB and baseline scheme  
Obviously, the penalty for CEMOB is the transfer of 
contextual information to many more gNBs (all the gNBs 
inside an RNA) compared to the baseline schemes where this 
information is transferred only from one gNB to another. To 
evaluate this penalty, we present the following analysis. 
According to [18], the security information that needs to 
be transferred to the gNBs and is part of the contextual 
information is approximately 624 bits and consists of a) K-
ASME key (256 bits), b) K-eNB key (256 bits) and c) 
NONCE (32 bits). Also the Globally Unique Temporary UE 
Identity GUTI (80 bits). This information needs to be 
transferred the corresponding gNBs that are involved either 
in the RAN based mobility management scheme or the 
CEMOB mechanism.

Figure 6: Additional data transfer needed for CEMOB  
In Figure 6 we present the additional information needed 
to be transferred for CEMOB when compared to the baseline 
scheme in terms of MB/h for a fixed topology and different 
space headway among vehicles. The settings of this 
experiment were the same with the previous one (e.g., 
number of gNBs, size of an RNA, probability of changing 
path, etc.). As expected CEMOB always underperforms 
compared to the baseline scheme. The additional overhead of 
CEMOB 
for 
transferring 
contextual 
information 
is 
minimized when the space headway value increases since 
less vehicles are moving on the street and participate in 
mobility management functions. In all cases the additional 
amount of information that needs to be transferred over the 
wireline CN-RAN link for the case of CEMOB seems to be 
rather manageable for existing mobile networks. As shown 
in Figure 6 the worst case for CEMOB is for an average 
space headway of 4.5 meters for vehicles travelling at 60 
Km/h. For this case only an additional 27 Mbps needs to be 
exchanged between the AMF and the gNBs over the wired 
part of the network. 
Overall, CEMOB minimizes the signalling load and the 
interactions 
among 
NFs 
for 
mobility 
management 
procedures by taking advantage of contextual information 
that is related to the specificities of the V2X use cases. As 
we will demonstrate in the next Section the same principle 
may be applied to other network control functions like the 
management of network resources in a way that minimizes 
the communication delay among vehicles. This minimization 
is of paramount importance for autonomous driving 
applications.  
 
V. 
RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN EXISTING SYSTEMS  
In 
cooperative 
automated 
driving 
(CAD) 
communications, vehicles need to communicate under strict 
delay and reliability constraints. In the existing schemes, a 
UE must obtain the resources from the scheduler in order to 
communicate. This procedure consists of the following steps 
(illustrated in Figure 7): 
a) scheduling request 
b) scheduling grant 
c) UE processing 
The average duration of the overall procedure involved 
in obtaining the first schedule grant is about 10msec [19] 
thus, failing to meet the delay requirements of various V2X 
use cases such as cooperative collision avoidance, 
cooperative lane change, emergency trajectory alignment 
that may require an end-to-end delay in terms 3-10msec 
[20]. 
On the other hand, the delay for a UE to be granted 
resources for transmission is linked with the transition from 
RRC IDLE state to RRC CONNECTED. Table I presents the 
control-plane delay budget for moving from IDLE to 
CONNECTED which in total is approximately 50msec. In 
addition, 3msec is required for resources to be granted by the 
scheduler.  
The solution using the RNA concept [14], described in 
Section IV, introduces a “light” connected state (i.e., 
RRC_INACTIVE), where the UE is able to resume a 
connection with the RRCConnectionResume message. This 
procedure requires about 30msec for entering CONNECTED 
state from the light connected state (since interactions with 
the core network are omitted) [21]. Still, this solution cannot 
address the abovementioned strict delays. 
If all vehicles are always CONNECTED even though the 
new transmissions will require only 3msec to transmit their 
data, resources are wasted for having a signalling channel 
ready for the usage, even when the transmissions are not 
planned. Considering the number of vehicles in the street this 
can be a significant waste of resources. In case of downlink 
communication, the scheduling delay is insignificant, but the 
delay associated with the paging needs to be taken into 
account if the vehicle is in IDLE mode. Furthermore, in case 
where a vehicle crosses the boundaries of two cells, a 
handover has to be executed. The execution of a typical 
handover process requires about 30-50msec. Again, such a 
delay is not acceptable based on the latest specifications of 
3GPP. 
 
 
Figure 7: UE obtaining resources from the gNB 
Summarizing, the abovementioned baseline procedures 
have two key drawbacks. The first being the increased delay 
in obtaining the schedule grant and the second being the lack 
of assurance in getting the transmission opportunity.

CARP: CONTEXT-AWARE RESOURCE PRE-
ALLOCATION  
One of the key characteristics of the vehicular mobility is 
that they have restricted spatial distribution since the vehicles 
have specific dimensions and their mobility is confined to 
the dedicated road infrastructure which is of certain capacity. 
Consequently, the maximum number of vehicles on a road 
segment is known beforehand. Additionally, by considering 
safety aspects, inter-vehicle distance can be taken into 
account to know the maximum density of the vehicle-UEs. 
The above observation leads to the outcome that, in 
certain cases, allocating resources in advance on a per-
geographical area basis, rather than per-UE basis, will not be 
extremely costly for having collision free communication. 
Figure 8 illustrates such geographical area division in an 
intersection marked by the grid lines where each block in the 
grid can be allocated with resources beforehand. Also, the 
cost incurred by the pre-allocation can be further reduced if 
the resource pre-allocation is combined with spatial reuse by 
limiting the transmission power. Such an approach (i.e., pre-
allocating resources in specific areas and for specific use) 
eliminates the delay in obtaining the resources. The gain of 
such an approach is that it limits the communication delay to 
values that are required by the most demanding V2X use 
cases (e.g., collaborative collision avoidance).  
 
Figure 8: Pre-allocation Layout 
The knowledge about the existence of these resources 
can be communicated to the vehicles in advance (during 
initial attachment or tracking area updates). Hence, it has the 
potential to meet the delay-bound requirements without the 
need for scheduling. By availing context information, the 
pre-allocation strategy can support collision free low delay-
bound communication with a guaranteed delay. Obviously, 
the penalty of this scheme is that the pre-allocated resources 
are wasted if there is no need to be used. On the other hand, 
there are not really any other alternatives to support delays in 
the magnitude of a few milliseconds unless all vehicles are 
always in a connected state. But this requires even more 
resources from the network. 
Context information about the streets and specific 
geography (e.g., crossings, junctions, highways, etc.) 
combined with information about the traffic limitations (e.g., 
speed limitations, etc.) facilitate proper splitting of the 
geographical area and allocation of the resources where these 
are needed (e.g., in crossroads). Thus, by using the vehicle 
context and road topology, tailor-cut to vehicular 
communications, resources can be pre-allocated to specific 
segments on the streets. Then, vehicles can use them as long 
as they are on the predefined place for predefined services 
that require low latency and high reliability.  
We call this framework of pre-allocating resources in 
specific road segments and communicating this information 
to the vehicles beforehand CARP (Context Aware Resource 
Pre-allocation). To achieve its purpose, it is required from 
5G networks to be aware of the street geography and also 
about the current vehicle traffic load in the streets. This is 
possible to achieve in 5G networks since the introduction of 
NEF allows application functions such as the V2X 
application server to exchange information both with control 
functions but also to the Network Management System. 
By analyzing the context information for the vehicles 
and the streets, a centralized entity may further update the

pre-allocated resources accordingly. Figure 9 presents how 
this process takes place and the decision is distributed to the 
vehicles. Initially, the V2X application provides to the 
Network Management System (NMS) the vehicles and 
street context thought the NEF. The NMS, considering the 
street statistics and the vehicles information concludes about 
the proper gNBs configuration in the form of a Radio 
Resource Map (RR map). The NMS, by identifying 
segments where certain emergencies are highly probable, 
can proceed in certain optimizations. Then, the NMS 
communicates this information to the gNBs and the AMF, 
so as to configure the first ones and facilitate the vehicles 
information through the AMF. The informing of the 
vehicles can take place through the tracking area update 
procedure or every time a path diversion takes place.

VII. CARP PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
To analyze the capacity requirements of the pre-
allocation scheme, an urban environment described by the 
urban information society use case in METIS I project has 
been used [23]. This urban topology is based on the Madrid-
grid as shown in Figure 10. The dimension of the grid is 
considered to be 387m in width and 552m in height with 
lanes of 3m width. The length of a vehicle is assumed to be 
4m and the number of microcells is assumed to be 24. 
Considering 8 horizontal lanes and 10 vertical lanes, the 
total length of lanes without overlap is (387-30)*8 + 552*10 
= 8376m. Then, when the road is congested at its maximum 
capacity, the maximum number of vehicles on the road can 
be 8376/4 = 2094. The assumptions for the evaluation are 
presented in Table II.

Figure 10: Madrid-grid [23] 
 
Figure 11 presents the cost of the pre-allocated resources 
in terms of required resource blocks for guaranteeing 
transmission opportunities for various vehicular densities. 
Here, each resource block is considered to have 12 
subcarriers with inter subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz as per 
the existing LTE system. The considered messages are of 
100 bytes size and are required to be transmitted within 
5ms. It is observed from the evaluations that the cost of pre-
allocation can be as low as only 6 resource blocks when 
vehicles are moving with the speed of 15m/s and using a 
Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) 15. Even under the 
higher density scenarios and MCS 15, the cost associated is 
only about 17 resource blocks to achieve the required delay. 
In this analysis we observe that in cases of low inter-
vehicular distance a larger amount of resources for the pre-
allocation (i.e., ~ 9-10 MHz) is needed. Whereas when the 
inter-vehicular distance is rather high the cost of pre-
allocation of resources is quite low (~ 1-1.5 MHz). 
 
 
Figure 11: Pre-allocation Cost 
 
However, the abovementioned case is rather extreme 
since we need to pre-allocate resources in the overall area 

74
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 11 no 1 & 2, year 2018, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/

under consideration. A more realistic use case relates to the 
pre-allocation of resources only in the areas of interest (e.g., 
crossings) and only for certain distance from these points of 
interest. To analyze the cost of pre-allocation in such points 
of interest, intersection areas of the map are considered. In 
particular, one small intersection (cross of 2 vertical and 2 
horizontal lanes) and one large intersection (cross of 6 
vertical and 2 horizontal lanes) including area of 50m radius 
from the center of these intersection are analyzed. The cost 
analyses of these intersections are given in Figure 12 
considering each case with MCS 15 and 20. It is observed 
that with about 4 to 6 resource blocks, pre-allocation can 
support low latency communications even under higher 
density intersections. This translates to the bandwidth 
requirement of only ~0.7 MHz – 1 MHz along with 
additional 10% of the required bandwidth for guard bands. 
This cost is rather acceptable assuming the 10MHz 
bandwidth is typically allocated for V2V communications 
[24].

VIII. KEY FINDINGS 
As we have illustrated in the paper, the 5G architecture 
is flexible enough and gives a new opportunity to support 
very demanding use cases for the vertical industries. Having 
the appropriate functions in place (e.g., NEF) and by 
allowing the communication of the application functions 
(e.g., V2X application server) with the network components 
it is possible to collect the necessary static (e.g., streets 
geography) or dynamic (the moving path of a vehicle) 
contextual information and re-design the operation of 
control functions. 
In our view, what is missing from the current version of 
the specifications is exactly this consideration of contextual 
information and how it can improve the control functions of 
the networks. Information about the path and the speed of a 
UE, the maximum number of UEs the geography of the 
streets (e.g., crossroads etc.) can assist considerably in 
minimizing 
the 
communication 
delay, 
increase 
the 
reliability and alleviate the signaling cost in a network.  
This strategy of re-examining the network control 
operations based on the available contextual information can 
be adopted not only for the V2X case but also for all types 
of verticals (e.g., mIoT communications). We expect that in 
the future, for the next releases of 5G specifications, similar 
approaches will be followed for the further elaboration of 
the overall 5G architecture as a framework, as well as, the 
fine tuning of NFs that will support the operation of the 
different network slices on a per use case basis. 
 
IX. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This paper makes the case that although the specification 
of 5G networks is well underway and slicing is gradually 
reaching a mature status, several inefficiencies still exist. 
Standardization 
activities 
have 
sensibly 
focused 
on 
introducing new principles like NF modularization and the 
support of different numerologies in RAN and ported 
existing functionalities into the new principles. 
What is still missing though are further optimizations, 
that can be realized if use case specific context information is 
taken into account. In this paper, we have presented a new 
mobility management scheme that outperforms the baseline 
for the case of high moving UEs, like the autonomously 
driven vehicles. By taking advantage of the knowledge of the 
path that a vehicle will follow and by tailoring cut the 
involved network functions (e.g., AMF, NEF) appropriately, 
then significant benefits can be achieved in terms of 
signalling reduction with a manageable penalty of additional 
information being moved inside the network.  
Moreover, we have introduced a novel approach to pre-
allocate resources in road segments, where this is required 
(e.g., crossroads) and use this information to minimize the 
communication delay among vehicles. This is achieved by 
allocating not a significant amount of resources. As a next 
step of the current work, we will evaluate the proposed 
schemes using event driven simulations.
