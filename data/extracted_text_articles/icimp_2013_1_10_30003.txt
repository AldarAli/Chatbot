     Abstract – This paper focuses on the cybersecurity risk of 
online phishing and anti-phishing solutions to study user 
knowledge of phishing risks and intention to use anti-phishing 
solutions. Online phishing has become a major avenue for 
cyberattacks and a common cause for identity theft and 
financial losses. The availability of online security and anti-
phishing solutions has been on the rise. However, there has 
been little research focus and consensus on assessing the effect 
of users’ knowledge of cybersecurity risks and technology 
solutions on their acceptance and adoptions of cybersecurity 
solutions. This study proposes a novel model of assessment of 
users’ cybersecurity knowledge and acceptance, which consists 
of both direct objective assessment and indirect self-
assessment. The research model is designed to evaluate the 
relationship between online users’ technical knowledge and 
competence in cybersecurity risks (i.e., online phishing risks) 
and their behavioral intention to use cybersecurity (i.e., anti-
phishing) technology solutions. This study employs a survey 
method that measures end users’ knowledge and competence 
of anti-phishing techniques and their intention to adopt and 
use anti-phishing solutions. Statistical analysis of the data 
collected suggests a positive correlation between users’ 
technical knowledge of online phishing risks and solutions and 
their intention to adopt and use anti-phishing solutions. A 
positive correlation also appears between the direct assessment 
answers and self-assessment responses.

INTRODUCTION  
     Cybersecurity risks such as online phishing, have 
become an increasingly significant issue for information 
technology (IT) end users. Online phishing is a common 
cybersecurity attack targeting unsuspecting users and 
victims who are lured into clicking a spoofed universal 
resource locator (URL) or fraudulent email attachments or 
links pointing to a rogue Web page to give away their 
sensitive personal and financial information. The latest 
Phishing Activity Trends Report released by Anti-phishing 
Working Group (APWG) shows that attacks targeting 
consumers have remained at high levels with hundreds of 
phishing websites established online every day to lure 
online users to trouble and loss [1]. A recent report from 
security firm Trend Micro also confirms that 91 percent of 
cyberattacks now start with spear phishing, a special type of 
phishing targeting specific individuals [2].    
     There have been considerable efforts from cybersecurity 
industry and experts to make countermeasures and 
technology solutions available to detect, prevent, and 
minimize losses from cybersecurity attacks.  Anti-phishing 
technology solutions do exist, which include anti-phishing 
features built in web browsers and protection against 
phishing in commercial software from cybersecurity 
vendors, such as Symantec. However, the latest CSI 
Computer Crime and Security Survey report indicates a 
consistently small investment and effort in end user 
cybersecurity awareness training for several years [3]. 
Meanwhile, users’ adoption and actual use of cybersecurity 
solutions have been relatively low and not commensurate 
with the severity level of their perceptions and concerns 
about cybersecurity risks [4, 5]. Thus, it is vital to assess 
end users’ knowledge of cybersecurity risks and the key 
factors in users’ decision on adopting and using 
cybersecurity solutions. 
     Human capital and cybersecurity knowledge are the 
essential factors for achieving technical competence in the 
general cybersecurity competency model [6]. Knowledge is 
the contextual and high-value form of information and 
experience ready to apply to decisions and actions [7]. 
Research findings have indicated IT users’ lack of 
knowledge and clear understanding of cybersecurity 
solutions, including protections against phishing, unwanted 
tracking of their online activities, and potential leak of 
sensitive personal information [8, 9, 10]. However, there has 
been little research on user acceptance of cybersecurity 
solutions from the knowledge perspective. Most of the prior 
studies on technology acceptance focused on new 
technologies in general and the constructs of user 
perceptions of usefulness and ease of use as determinants of 
user attitude and behavioral intention toward technology 
adoption. These studies were primarily based on the 
technology acceptance model (TAM) and the theory of 
planned behavior (TPB). The research model proposed in 
this study focuses on the relationship between the 
assessment of user knowledge of cybersecurity and user 
attitude 
and 
intention 
toward 
adopting 
and 
using 
cybersecurity solutions.  
     Empirically, this study uses a behavioral survey method 
to assess users’ knowledge and attitude and intention 
regarding cybersecurity (i.e., anti-phishing) technology 
solutions. The findings suggest that user knowledge is 
positively associated with user acceptance of and intention

to use in the domain of cybersecurity (i.e., anti-phishing) 
technology.  
     There are six sections in this paper. Section I introduces 
the paper and the motivation for the study. Section II 
explains the research goals and discusses relevant 
theoretical background. Section III presents the research 
model. Section IV explains the survey-based methodology 
used for this study. Section V presents the results and data 
analysis. Section VI concludes the paper with findings, 
implications, and possible follow-up research.

RESEARCH GOALS AND BACKGROUND 
     The goal of this research is to use the anti-phishing 
scenario to assess end user knowledge of cybersecurity risks 
and solutions and uncover the relationship between user 
knowledge and user acceptance of cybersecurity solutions. 
Knowledge includes contextual information, awareness, and 
personal experience ready to be used for decisions and 
actions. Knowledge consists of both explicit knowledge or 
communicable information and tacit knowledge, which is 
personal and intuitive insights and know-how originated 
from individual experiences and values [11]. One’s attitude 
is a determining factor of one’s behavioral intention that 
predicts one’s actual behavior [12]. User knowledge of 
online security risks and protective and preventive solutions 
was found to be an important factor affecting user attitude 
and trust in online vendors in the e-commerce domain [13, 
14]. Thus, users’ knowledge of cybersecurity may be a 
predictor of their attitude and intention that are essential to 
their acceptance of security solutions. This research study 
primarily explores the relationship between user knowledge 
of cybersecurity and user acceptance of cybersecurity 
solutions. In addition, this study attempts to address the 
question of how to properly assess user knowledge of 
cybersecurity risks and technology.  
 
A. Attitudinal Theories on Cybersecurity Knowledge 
 
     A large amount of prior research on cybersecurity 
knowledge was based on attitudinal theories involving 
users’ perceptions of online risks and behavioral intentions. 
The conceptual assumption of such models was based on the 
theory of reasoned action (TRA). In TRA, behavioral 
intentions are antecedents to individual behavior, and 
intention is determined by attitudes and perceptions [12]. 
Accordingly, one’s perception and attitudes regarding online 
risks will have an influence on attitudes toward online 
transactions and in turn, affect his or her behavioral 
intentions to conduct online transactions. 
     Several studies used attitudinal theories to study how risk 
perceptions affect a dependent variable such as trust, 
purchase intention, and etc. These studies include Bhatnagar 
et al. [15], Miyazaki and Fernandez [16], Salisbury et al. 
[17], Pavlou [18], Milne et al. [19], Dinev and Hu [20], 
Jiang et al. [14], and Tsai et al. [21]. Knowledge in these 
studies generally refers to experience, maturity of subject, 
user awareness in a general sense, and familiarity with a 
task or risks in the online purchase environment.  
     The primary interest of these attitudinal studies was in 
user perceptions of online risks and intention to purchase 
online. Their common assumption is that people’s decisions 
under risks are driven by inconsistent perceptions, beliefs, 
and emotions. Such an assumption does lend support for the 
suggestion that users’ self-assessment of knowledge may 
have an impact on their behavior and decision making. 
However, the attitudinal studies have two major limitations: 
a) no focus on the assessment of user knowledge of 
cybersecurity risks and solutions; b) no focus on the 
relationship between cybersecurity knowledge assessment 
and intention to adopt cybersecurity technology solutions. 
This research attempts to address these limitations.   
 
B. Psychometric Theories on Cybersecurity Knowledge 
 
     The psychometric paradigm is an important approach to 
the knowledge dimension of risk studies even though such 
research on online security risks has been limited. The 
psychometric paradigm uses multivariate techniques to 
recover cognitive maps of decision makers’ risk perceptions 
and attitudes so as to understand the dimensions of risk and 
the cognitive schema [22]. Fischhoff et al. studied 
technological risks and benefits using the psychometric 
paradigm with some inclusion of knowledge of risks, but the 
study did not address the relationship between risks and 
technology acceptance [23]. Slovic, Fischhoff, and 
Lichtenstein found that risk acceptability is affected by risk 
attributes, such as familiarity with the level of risk [22]. 
They equated the concept of knowledge of risk to people’s 
familiarity with the level of risk. However, the study did not 
address the assessment of cybersecurity knowledge or user 
acceptance of online security technology solutions.   
     Slovic further elaborated the psychometric approach to 
the study of risk perceptions and suggested that the level of 
knowledge attribute seems to influence the relationship 
between perceived risk, perceived benefit, and risk 
acceptance [24]. However, he did not clearly define the 
concept of knowledge and did not include cybersecurity 
knowledge and technology acceptance in the study.   
     Nyshadham and Ugbaja used the techniques of the 
psychometric paradigm to study how B2C e-commerce 
consumers organize novel online risks in memory. The 
study called for further analysis to define the risk 
dimensions [25]. Using the psychometric paradigm, Gabriel 
and Nyshadham studied perceptions of online risks that 
affect online purchase intentions [26]. The study contributed 
a valuable taxonomy of online risks and a cognitive map of 
online consumers’ risk perceptions and attitudes. This is a 
positive step toward recognizing the knowledge dimension 
in user perceptions of online risks in general. However, 
there was no focus on cybersecurity risks and technology 
acceptance in the study.

C. Knowledge and Technology Acceptance 
 
     Prior literature on user knowledge and acceptance of 
cybersecurity solutions was primarily based on TPB and 
TAM. TPB considers user attitude, perceived social norm, 
and perceived behavioral control to be the factors 
determining user behavioral intention that predicts actual 
user behavior of adopting technology solutions [27]. TPB 
was the theoretical basis for the anti-spyware adoption 
model [4]. However, the model did not address the user 
knowledge factor. Another study on user attitude toward 
spyware and anti-spyware technologies was based on TPB 
and TAM [28]. In addition to the three TPB constructs, the 
TAM constructs of perceived usefulness and perceived ease 
of use were included as predictors of user attitude and 
behavior toward anti-spyware solutions. The study did 
include computer knowledge and awareness of spyware as 
predictors of user action. However, neither the construct of 
knowledge nor its role in the TPB model was clearly 
defined or assessed. Also, these two studies on spyware 
focused on anti-spyware technology, without addressing 
phishing risks and anti-phishing solutions.  
     A later study on protective information technologies 
based on an extended model of TPB attempted to address 
user behavioral intention toward cybersecurity technology 
in general [20]. The extended TPB model dropped the 
perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use factors and 
emphasized user awareness as a key determinant of user 
intention 
toward 
adopting 
protective 
information 
technologies. However, as acknowledged by the study itself, 
the awareness construct was not specific. The survey 
approach used by the study was also limited to questions on 
spyware and anti-spyware solutions.  
     A different theoretical approach to user acceptance of 
cybersecurity solutions was based on the Protection 
Motivation Theory (PMT) [29]. The PMT model argues that 
one’s fear appeals affect the motivation to protect oneself 
from potential harm. The study concluded that perceived 
vulnerability, perceived severity, response efficacy, and 
response cost influence individual behavioral intention to 
adopt anti-spyware protective technology. However, the 
PMT model did not address the user knowledge factor or 
assessment of user knowledge of cybersecurity. Subsequent 
studies by Wang [30] and Wang and Nyshadham [31] 
contributed more in-depth definitions of the user knowledge 
constructs regarding online risks, but their studies focused 
on the effect on online purchase intentions and decisions 
with little emphasis on intentions to adopt online security 
technology solutions.        
III. 
RESEARCH MODEL  
     Based on the review of the existing research above, this 
study proposes a new model of technology acceptance to 
address user acceptance of cybersecurity solutions from the 
knowledge assessment perspective. This model, shown in 
Fig. 1, extends the traditional TAM theory to include and 
focus on the knowledge assessment factor in determining 
user attitude and intention in the specific anti-phishing 
cybersecurity context. Knowledge management theory 
defines knowledge as the contextual and high-value form of 
information and experience that positively affect decisions 
and actions [32]. User knowledge in this study includes 
explicit contextual information and awareness as well as 
tacit personal experience and technical know-how. In terms 
of basic knowledge of anti-phishing solutions, users should 
be aware of and look for the https secure protocol in the 
URL for a secure website as shown in a sample secure URL 
in the browser window in Fig. 2. As an indicator of more in-
depth knowledge of anti-phishing technology, users should 
look for a valid security certificate for a secure website as 
shown in Fig. 3.

     Assessment of knowledge is a process of measuring and 
comparing learning expectations and actual learning 
outcomes [33]. Knowledge assessment in information 
technology areas can include both direct assessment, such as 
objective tests and projects, and indirect assessment, such as 
perceptions and self-assessment (or self-evaluation), and in 
evaluating the outcomes of technical knowledge and skills 
both direct and self-assessment methods can work together 
with positive correlation in results [34]. Accordingly, in 
assessing user knowledge of phishing risks and anti-
phishing technology solutions, objective test questions on 
technical indicators for secure websites can be used as direct 
assessment, along with indirect self-assessment questions

for users to present their perceptions and self-evaluations of 
their anti-phishing knowledge and skills.

     User acceptance refers to user’s positive attitude and 
intention toward using the cybersecurity solutions they 
know. One’s attitude, according to TRA and TAM, 
determines one’s behavioral intention which in turn predicts 
one’s actual behavior. Therefore, the research model 
proposes that user knowledge of cybersecurity risks and 
solutions is positively related to user attitude and intention 
toward using cybersecurity solutions.  
     TAM has been a traditional model for studying computer 
usage behavior and acceptance of information technology in 
general. However, to focus on the knowledge variable, the 
research model in this study does not include the TAM 
constructs of perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease 
of use (POEU). The awareness (a component of knowledge) 
of the consequences of not using cybersecurity technologies 
is more significant than PU and POEU in affecting user 
attitude and intention [20]. The constructs of intention to use 
and actual use are defined according to TAM constructs 
[35]. Intention to use measures the strength of one’s 
decision to perform the action or behavior of using the 
cybersecurity technology. Actual use refers to the actual 
action or behavior of using the cybersecurity technology. 
IV. 
METHODOLOGY 
     To test the research model, an anonymous questionnaire-
based survey was conducted among 210 randomly selected 
undergraduate students of various majors at a college in the 
northeast of the United States. The assumption for such 
randomization is that students of certain technical majors 
may have more cybersecurity background than those of non-
technical majors. Self-report survey question format has 
been an effective method for eliciting attitudinal responses 
[36]. The survey for this study utilized a seven-point Likert 
scale of responses ranging from 7=Strongly Agree to 
1=Strongly Disagree.   
     There are eight content questions related to user 
knowledge of phishing risks and anti-phishing technology 
solutions. The content of the questions is based on some 
common phishing risks and solutions for online activities 
and transactions. The first four questions in the survey are 
direct assessment questions expecting factual answers from 
the subjects to measure their knowledge of phishing risks 
and essential anti-phishing technology. Questions 5 through 
7 are indirect self-assessment questions to elicit the 
respondents’ self-evaluation of their knowledge of phishing 
risks and anti-phishing solutions. Question 8 was designed 
to be the dependent variable that measures the subjects’ 
acceptance of and intention to use anti-phishing technology. 
Additional questions on demographics, such as gender, and 
age group, years of using computers, average Internet usage, 
were included in the survey. The eight questions for the 
survey are as follows:  
1. I am aware that online phishing may lead to 
personal identity theft and financial losses.  
2. I am aware of at least one solution to protect 
against online phishing. 
3. https is an important protocol to look for in a 
secure web address.    
4. Before giving my credit card number to an online 
vendor, I will look for a valid certificate to certify 
that the vendor web site is secure.       
5. I will not likely accept email invitations from an 
unfamiliar source to give out my personal account 
information.  
6. I am well informed about online phishing risks.  
7. I am well informed about anti-phishing technology.  
8. I intend to use effective protection technology 
against online phishing on a regular basis.  
     The questionnaire was pilot-tested among 15 students. 
Minor changes in wording were made prior to the formal 
distribution and administration of the final survey. The 
survey was distributed to a total of 210 students. The 
student participation in the survey was declared anonymous 
and voluntary, and a total of 186 responses were received. 
14 responses were eliminated for missing data. A final total 
of 172 responses were used for data analysis. The next 
section presents the findings and discussions.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS 
     Demographic data collected from the subjects included 
gender, age group, years of using computers, and average 
Internet usage. The data show that all subjects had at least 
two years of experience of using computers.  Over 85% of 
the subjects use the Internet between 1 and 6 hours per day; 
4

and over 78% of the subjects have used the Internet for four 
or more years. The age of the subjects falls between 18 and 
56, including 55.7% in age 18-21, 32.4% in age 22-30, 8.9% 
in age 31-40, 2.3% in age 41-50, and 0.7% above the age of 
50. 55% of the subjects were female while 46% were male. 
The data are close to the general demographics of the 
student population at the surveyed institution.  
     SPSS version 18.0 for Windows was used for statistical 
analysis of the data collected. The reliability analysis of the 
survey instrument and the Pearson correlations among the 
eight variables are presented in Table 1 and Table 2 below. 
The seven independent variables include four Direct 
Assessment questions (coded as DA1, DA2, DA3, and DA4 
represented by questions 1-4 in the survey) and three 
Indirect Self-assessment questions (coded as SA1, SA2, and 
SA3 represented by questions 5-7 in the survey). ITN stands 
for the Intention to Use, which is the dependent variable 
represented by question 8 in the survey. The valid responses 
collected were entered into SPSS for reliability and 
correlations analysis. The analysis reports are presented in 
TABLE 1 and TABLE 2. The Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient 
is an effective measure of internal consistency reliability, 
and coefficient values over 0.80 indicate good internal 
consistency reliability [37]. The Cronbach Alpha values for

the four construct items in this study, as shown in Table 1, 
are all above 0.80 among the eight variables. Therefore, the 
measures used in this study are considered to have good 
internal consistency reliability. Discriminant validity of 
measures is achieved if correlations between any pair of 
latent constructs are significantly less than 1.00 [38]. The 
Pearson correlations among the variables shown in Table 2 
are significantly less than 1.00. Thus, the measures in this 
study have demonstrated considerable discriminant validity. 
In addition, the pilot test of the survey instrument and 
necessary revisions made in the wording of the survey 
questions were also helpful in improving the content 
validity of the questionnaire. 
     The Pearson correlation results shown in Table 2 indicate 
support for the research model of this study. The Pearson 
correlation coefficient is appropriate for interval-scaled 
measures [37]. The results in the correlations matrix in 
Table 2 indicate a significant positive relationship between 
end users’ cybersecurity knowledge (via direct assessment 
and indirect self-assessment) and their intention to use 
cybersecurity technology solutions. The results also show 
significant and positive correlations between the Direct 
Assessment variables and the Indirect Self-assessment 
variables, which indicates support for the cybersecurity 
knowledge assessment construct in the research model 
proposed in this study. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This study focuses on the relationship between 
assessment of users’ knowledge of cybersecurity risks and 
solutions (i.e., phishing risks and anti-phishing solutions) and 
their attitude and intention toward adoption and use of 
cybersecurity solutions. Based on the anti-phishing scenario, 
a novel and simplified technology acceptance model was 
proposed and tested using a survey study including 
independent variables of both direct assessment and indirect 
self-assessment of cybersecurity knowledge. The findings 
indicate support for the proposition that users’ cybersecurity 
(i.e., phishing) knowledge is positively related to their 
attitude 
and 
intention 
toward 
adopting 
and 
using 
cybersecurity (anti-phishing) solutions. The research data 
also indicate a positive correlation between the direct 
assessment method and the indirect self-assessment method 
in 
evaluating 
users’ 
cybersecurity 
knowledge. 
This 
correlation may point to the valid practice of including both 
direct and indirect assessment methods in cybersecurity 
knowledge training.   
User 
acceptance and 
adoptions of cybersecurity 
technology solutions is an emerging and significant area for 
researchers and the business community. This study 
contributes a new model of cybersecurity knowledge 
assessment and user acceptance of cybersecurity solutions. 
The study also adds valuable data to the study of online 
phishing risks and user acceptance of anti-phishing solutions. 
This study has some important practical implications as well. 
Cybersecurity technology solution vendors need to heed user 
knowledge level in marketing their products and services. 
Improving user training and knowledge level may lead to 
higher levels of acceptance and adoptions of cybersecurity 
solutions. It is also an opportunity and social responsibility 
for educational institutions to provide more effective 
cybersecurity (i.e., anti-phishing) programs and courses to 
improve user knowledge of cybersecurity risks and 
cybersecurity technology solutions. In terms of assessing 
cybersecurity knowledge, the study suggests that direct and 
objective assessment method can be as equally effective as

indirect self-assessment method. Therefore, cybersecurity 
training programs may consider using both direct assessment 
and indirect assessment questions in evaluating users’ 
knowledge and competency.  
There are promising follow-up research opportunities to 
pursue this study further. This study focused on the effect of 
the direct and indirect cybersecurity knowledge variables on 
user intention to use cybersecurity solutions using samples of 
general users. Further studies can be conducted among users 
of different levels of cybersecurity experience and include 
additional variables, such as specific variables on user 
experience in online security risks and resolutions as well as 
effectiveness in communication of cybersecurity risks and 
solutions. This study is based on the specific area of phishing 
risks and anti-phishing solutions. Future studies can be done 
on other cybersecurity topics, such as malware risks and anti-
malware solutions, botnets, or the emerging cloud security 
risks and solutions. In addition, using a larger sample size 
and a more comprehensive assessment process than those 
used in this study may produce more informative and 
conclusive data.
