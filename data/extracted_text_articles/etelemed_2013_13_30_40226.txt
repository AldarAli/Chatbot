Abstract—In a video conferencing based remote teaching
system, visual quality is of critical importance, specially when
it is used for medical training. However, transmission of high
quality video data requires substantial amount of bandwidth.
Unfortunately, communication systems in remote areas suffer
from low transmission rate which demands signiﬁcant com-
pression of videos at the expense of visual quality. To strike a
balance between the requirements of high visual quality and
high compression ratio, in this paper, we propose to achieve
higher visual quality only in the area of critical importance of
a video known as Region of Interest (ROI). In the proposed
scheme, the increase in the bit rate due to the improved
visual quality in ROI is compensated with a degradation in
the visual quality of non-ROI so that the effective bit rate
meets the available bandwidth constraint. One of the salient
features of the proposed method is that it operates outside
the rate-distortion optimization (RDO) process of standard
video codecs and thus ensures easy integration of the scheme
into existing video coding standards and devices. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed scheme signiﬁcantly
improves the visual quality of ROI without much degradation
of the overall visual quality.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the ubiquitous availability of broadband Internet,
video conferencing systems are replacing traditional face-
to-face meeting and teaching methods. Video conferencing,
which relieves the need for traveling across distance, is
not only cost-effective but also energy efﬁcient in terms
of carbon footprint. Besides, video conferencing allows
participants in rural areas to access quality learning where
traveling to a distance is not an option. Indeed, our research
motivation comes from the need of effective supervised
training of newly appointed general practitioners (GPs) in
regional Australia. Under the Australian General Practice
Training (AGPT) program, every newly recruited GP goes
through a mandatory supervised period. During this period,
an experienced supervisor assesses the GP’s consultation
performance, offers on-demand consultation in complex
cases, and conduct workshops along with a group of GPs.
Ideally, the GP and the supervisor should be co-located at the
same facility which is often infeasible as a supervisor has to
supervise several GPs practicing at different remote sites.
Clearly, in this scenario, remote supervision using video
conferencing is an effective alternative.
While in remote teaching, based on video conferencing,
the visual clarity is not a ruling factor in general, it is often a
critical requirement in medical training. For instance, when
a GP wants the supervisor to look at a particular skin rash or
the tone of an infection of a patient, a proper investigation is
impossible if the video quality is not clear. However, high
quality video transmission requires high bandwidth which
is often not available in rural areas. In a brute approach,
video data need to be compressed signiﬁcantly, given the
low available bandwidth in remote sites, albeit at the expense
of visual quality. However, in practice, the participants in a
video conference are mostly interested in a small region of
the video frames, termed as region of interest (ROI), which
needs detailed inspection. Therefore, an effective approach is
to allocate the scarce bandwidth unevenly between the ROI
and non-ROI of a video. Instead of transmitting the whole
frame at the same visual quality, the ROI area needs to be
transmitted at a high quality which must be compensated by
a degradation of the visual quality of non-ROI area.
ROI based video coding has been proposed in a number
of contemporary research works [1]–[4]. Since video coding
standards such as H.264 and MPEG are characterized by
high-complexity encoding, which is often considerable for
real time video communications, these works mainly focused
on reducing the encoding complexity. Liu et al. [1] used skin
tone and frame difference to detect ROI and proposed region
based computational power and bit allocation by adjusting
encoding parameters adaptively. Considering the fact that
lower frequency coefﬁcients of an image is less detectable
to Human Visual System (HVS) than higher frequency com-
ponents, Zheng et al. [2] proposed adaptively suppressing
the low frequency coefﬁcients of non-ROI blocks which, in

turn, reduces the overall computational complexity. Wang et
al. [3] proposed using the texture and motion features of
a video to determine its ROI and non-ROI. The authors
then proposed a dynamic parameter allocation scheme to
reduce the computational complexity to attain the low power
requirement of portable devices. Considering the importance
of rate control in ROI based video coding, Yang et al.
proposed a rate control mechanism in [4]. The scheme
proposed in [4] determines the quantization parameter (QP)
for the ROI, based on the user deﬁned interest level, and
adaptively allocates bits between ROI and non-ROI regions.
All above schemes essentially focused on reducing the
computational complexity of encoding. However, with the
advancement of VLSI techniques, high computational power
is now available even in portable devices like Apple iPAD
or Sumsung Galaxy III. Moreover, in recent days, neither
the computational power nor the battery life is a serious
concern for PC and laptop users. More importantly, these
schemes require custom rate-distortion algorithms which are
difﬁcult to accommodate in the framework of existing video
coding standards. The rate-distortion optimization (RDO)
algorithms implemented in the standard codecs are well
studied and are widely being used in real life applications.
Therefore, one of the objectives of our research is to
design an effective variable bit allocation scheme that can
easily be integrated with the standard video codecs. In this
paper, we propose a scheme to transmit the ROI at a high
quality where the additional bits used to transmit the ROI
is compensated by transmitting non-ROI regions at a lower
(than suggested by the standard codec) quality. In effect, we
attempt to maintain the same level of bandwidth usage while
transmitting the ROI at a higher quality.
The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows.
We brieﬂy review the architecture of current video coding
standard H.264 and its rate-distortion control mechanism in
Section II. In Section III, we then propose our scheme to im-
prove the visual quality of ROI without much degradation of
the overall quality of the video while meeting the bandwidth
constraint. Extensive experimental results are then presented
in Section IV to validate the efﬁcacy of the proposed method.
In Section V, ﬁnally we conclude our paper.
II. VISUAL QUALITY CONTROL IN STANDARD CODECS
Video is a sequence of image frames that are played back
at a speciﬁc frame rate. The feasibility of video compres-
sion stems from exploiting its interframe redundancy and
intraframe redundancy. The similarity among the successive
frames of a video is referred to as interframe redundancy.
On the other hand, intraframe redundancy refers to the
correlation that exists between a pixel and its neighbors
in the same frame. Effective video compression relies on
efﬁcient exploitation of all these redundancies.
The techniques of exploiting the intraframe and interframe
redundancies are referred to as intra coding and inter coding,
respectively. In both of the techniques, a frame is partitioned
into non-overlapped, ﬁxed sized, rectangular blocks called
macroblock. For each of the macroblocks in the current
frame, a prediction is made based on the previously encoded
data. In intra coding, the prediction is made from previously
encoded macroblocks of the same frame, while in inter
coding a set of recently coded frames called a Group of
Pictures (GOP) are used for prediction. Then the residual,
i.e., the difference between the actual block and the predicted
block, is transformed. After transformation, such as discrete
cosine transform (DCT), most of the energy of the residual
is concentrated into a few low frequency coefﬁcients. Since
HVS is less sensitive to the distortions at high frequency
components, signiﬁcant compression can be achieved by
discarding these high frequency coefﬁcients, by using a
coarse quantizer, without much degradation of the visual
quality of the reconstruction.
Indeed, in the video coding standards, it is the quanti-
zation step that controls the trade off between bit rate and
visual quality. In the H.264 video coding standard, the rate-
distortion trade off is controlled by the parameter QP which
can take a value between 0 and 51 and refers to a matrix of
Qsteps, i.e,. the quantization step size. In general, a higher
Qstep achieves more compression, however, results in higher
distortion and vice versa. The quantization matrices are such
that most of the high frequency coefﬁcients become zero
after quantization. For more details on H.264 see [5].
In real-time applications, given the available bandwidth,
the value of QP is a function of network usage (determined
from the emptiness of Coded Pixel Buffer (CPB)) and the
estimate of bit allocations for the current frame and its GOP.
More speciﬁcally, in H.264 video coding standard a RDO
algorithm allocates a number of bits to the GOP depending
on the emptiness of the CPB. The GOP includes a number
frames that can be any of I, P, or B frames. A GOP always
begins with an I frame which is followed by a sequence of P
and B frames. Depending on the type of current frame and
the remaining bit allocation for the current GOP, a frame
level bit allocation is decided in the RDO process.
Since QP essentially controls the trade off between the
visual quality and the compression ratio, it is an effective
tool to achieve varying image quality and enforcement of
bit allocation for individual macroblocks. In the following
section, we explain how we can adjust QP for individual
macroblocks to offer better image quality in ROI.
III. RATE ADJUSTMENT FOR HIGH QUALITY ROI
ENCODING
To increase the visual quality of the ROI, we need to
decrease the QP values of the macroblocks within the ROI
so that the quantization distortion during encoding is less
for these macroblocks. This allows the decoder at receiver
to reconstruct a better representation of the original frame.
However, using a lower QP to offer lower quantization
241

distortion at a ROI also increases the data size. If the increase
in the bit-rate is not compensated in the non-ROI then it will
result in buffer or network overﬂow. To overcome this prob-
lem, the non-ROI needs to be coded using higher QP values
to compensate for the increase in data size due to improved
encoding of ROI. The compensation mechanism needs to
ensure that, while satisfying the bandwidth constraint, the
maximum possible information is retained.
Adjusting the visual quality of non-ROI to maximize the
overall visual quality, subject to the available bandwidth, is
challenging. If a lower value of QP is used for non-ROI,
although the visual quality would be better, the resulting
bit rate will then be higher than the available bandwidth
which will lead to call termination. On the other hand, if
the QP for non-ROI is unnecessarily high, some of the
available bandwidth will be left unused which could have
been used to improve the overall visual quality. The primary
obstacle in selecting the appropriate QPs for ROI and non-
ROI macroblocks is that although bandwidth and quality
control parameters are closely related, their relationships can
not be expressed with simple functions. In the following, we
explain our proposed method of improving the visual quality
of ROI while maximizing the overall visual quality subject
to available bandwidth. Although, the proposed scheme
assumes the x264 codec as an efﬁcient implementation of
H.264, it can easily be adopted to other implementations of
H.264 as well.
In x264 codec, a award winning implementation of H.264,
after allocating a bit budget to a frame, QP for each of
the macroblocks is computed adaptively based on the com-
plexity and compressibility of the macroblock. Therefore,
we assume that while adjusting the QP values after the
RDO of x264 encoder, the variations in QPs among the
macroblocks of ROI and among the macroblocks of non-ROI
should be maintained. More speciﬁcally, the QP of each of
the macroblocks in ROI should be decreased by a constant
factor C as speciﬁed by the user. Similarly, a ﬁxed factor T
must be added to the QP values of each of the macroblocks
in non-ROI. Now we need to determine the value of T such
that the resulting bit rate after the adjustment of QPs matches
the available bandwidth. After extensive experimentation we
have observed that to ensure that the effective bit rate is close
to the target bit rate, the mean of the QPs of a frame after
adjustment should be same as the mean of the QPs computed
by the RDO process of x264 encoder. Therefore, QP values
of non-ROI should be increased by T = nC/(N −n), where
N is the total number of macroblocks in a frame and n is
the number of macroblocks in ROI. Clearly, this method
operates outside the RDO process and thus can be easily
incorporated into the standard codecs.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In image and video compression, peak signal to noise
ratio (PSNR) is used as an approximation to human percep-
tion of reconstruction quality. A higher PSNR value indi-
cates lower loss during compression and thus is preferable.
Therefore, in our experiments we used PSNR as a metric
for visual quality.
We implemented the proposed scheme in x264 codec [6].
To implement a real time video communication system with
ROI based coding, we extended the linphone [7] software,
which is a mature softphone application for Linux, Win-
dows, and Mac, to use in the modiﬁed x264 codec. For
comparison purpose, we used this modiﬁed x264 application
on a number of YUV test video sequences. The QCIF
and CIF YUV videos were collected from [8] while the
higher resolution (4CIF and 720p) video sequences were
downloaded from [9] and [10], respectively. Under different
target bit rate requirements, we determined the effective bit
rate and PSNR of ROI, non-ROI, and overall frame for
these video sequences having different resolution and image
complexity.
Fig. 1 demonstrates the impact of ROI based encoding
on the visual quality of four standard test video sequences:
‘Silent,’ ‘News,’ ‘Mother & Daughter,’ and ‘Foreman’. In
each of the video sequences, the ROI contained the face
which is detected using the Face Detection module of
OpenCV [11]. The ﬁgure shows that the perceptual visual
quality of ROI is improved without much degradation of
overall frame quality.
The performance of the proposed technique for a QP-
shift of C = 5 is illustrated in Fig. 2a-2d in terms of
effective bit rate, overall frame PSNR, ROI PSNR, and non-
ROI PSNR, respectively. It follows from Fig. 2a that the
bit rate resulting from the proposed method is considerably
close (within ±1.5 kbps on average) to the one obtained
by original x264 codec. This validates our equi-mean QP
hypothesis of readjusting QP values of ROI and non-ROI.
Fig. 2b shows that the overall frame PSNR obtained
with the proposed method degraded slightly than that with
original x264 codec. The average decrease in overall frame
PSNR was found to be 0.3 dB, 0.13 dB, 0.19 dB, and
0.61 dB for ‘Silent’, ‘News’, ‘Mother & Daughter’, and
‘Foreman’ video sequences, respectively.
It is worth mentioning that the visual quality of ROI
improved in every test video sequences. The ROI PSNR was
found to be 2.62 dB, 3.09 dB, 2.39 dB, and 2.2 dB higher
than that obtained with original x264 codec in ‘Silent’,
‘News’, ‘Mother & Daughter’, and ‘Foreman’ test video
sequences, respectively. This increase in visual quality is due
to lowering of the ROI QPs which resulted in additional
bit allocation for ROI. This increase in bit rate for ROI
was compensated by increasing the QPs of non-ROI which
lead to a decrease in visual quality of the non-ROI. The
decrease in non-ROI PSNR using the proposed method was
found to be 0.45 dB, 0.27 dB, 0.34 dB, and 0.9 dB for
‘Silent’, ‘News’, ‘Mother & Daughter’, and ‘Foreman’ video
sequences, respectively.

The ROI area in the above videos contained only face
which is about 5% of the total frame. Intuitively, the
performance of the proposed scheme will vary with the ROI
area and frame resolution. In the following, we present and
analyze our experimental results to understand the impact of
these parameters on the proposed ROI based coding scheme.

conducted on several QCIF, CIF, 4CIF, and 720p videos
using a QP shift of C = 5. In each of the video sequences,
(left) half of the frame was used as ROI and the other
(right) half was used as non-ROI. For space constraint,
results for only one video per resolution are reported in
this paper. However, similar results were observed for other
video sequences as well.
It follows from Fig. 3 that the proposed method resulted in
good agreement between effective bit rate and target bit rate.
The effective bit rate achieved with the proposed method
was found to be within 5.2 kbps, 1.03 kbps, 0.48 kbps, and
1.75 kbps of the target bit rate for ‘Claire’ (QCIF), ‘Silent’
(CIF), ‘Crew’ (4CIF), and ‘Shields’ (720p) video sequences,
respectively.
Fig. 4a illustrates that when the proposed method was
used the overall frame PSNR degraded slightly for CIF,
4CIF, and 720p video sequences. The CIF, 4CIF, and 720p
video sequences showed an increase in ROI PSNR by
2.6 dB, 0.54 dB, and 0.38 dB (see Fig. 4b) at the cost of
slight degradation in non-ROI PSNR by 0.45 dB, 1.95 dB,
and 1.1 dB (see Fig. 4c). The adverse result for the QCIF
video was primarily due to its low resolution for which the
QP shift of C = 5 was considerably large. The lower QP
used for ROI was compensated by using a higher QP in non-
ROI which resulted in signiﬁcantly lower PSNR for non-ROI
and for the whole frame.

Figure 5: Impact of ROI size on effective bit rate.
B. Impact of ROI Size
To demonstrate the impact of varying ROI size on the
performance of the proposed method, we use the CIF ‘Silent’
video and change the ROI size from 1% to 90%. The center
of ROI was at the center of the video since the important
visual objects are usually located at the centre of the video.
With varying ROI size, the effective bit rates were found
to be considerably close to that obtained by the original
x264 codec (See Fig. 5). At target bit rates as high as
200 kbps and 300 kbps, the bandwidth usage in the proposed
method differed by 1.49 kbps and 3.47 kbps, respectively.
This observation demonstrates the robustness of our equi-
mean QP hypothesis with the variation of ROI size, relative
to the frame size.
It follows from Fig. 6a that at each bit rate, the frame
PSNR decreased in the proposed method when the size of
ROI was increased. This pattern can be explained from the
resulting ROI PSNR (Fig. 6b) and non-ROI PSNR (Fig. 6c).
A much higher ROI PSNR (compared to original x264
codec) was obtained with the proposed technique when the
ROI was small. As the ROI area increased, the ROI PSNR
degraded and approached the ROI PSNR obtained with the
original x264 codec. For instance, at 50 kbps, the increase in
ROI PSNR by the proposed method from that obtained by
the original x264 codec was 2.25 dB and 0.15 dB when the
ROI area was 1% and 90% of the total frame, respectively.

Figure 6: Impact of varying ROI size on the performance (PSNR) of the proposed scheme on ‘Silent’ video sequence.
While determining the effective QP shift, we ﬁrst looked
for the minimum original QP within the ROI and then its
difference from the QP shift limit was subtracted from the
QP of each ROI macroblock. Therefore, as the area of ROI
increases, the probability of ﬁnding a lower QP within ROI
also increases. For instance, when the ROI size was 9.09%,
18.18%, and 27.27% of the whole image, the minimum
original QP-adjustment within ROI was found to be around
4, 7, and 8, respectively.
An inverse impact on the image quality of non-ROI was
also observed. When the ROI was small, the decrease in
ROI QP was compensated with slightly higher QP for non-
ROI. Therefore, the non-ROI image quality did not degrade
considerably and the non-ROI PSNR using the proposed
method was nearly same as that obtained with original x264
codec. However, when the ROI became larger, with the same
QP shift for ROI, we needed a much higher QP for the non-
ROI to ensure that the mean QP of the whole frame remained
same. Therefore, the non-ROI image quality degraded more
when the ROI area was larger. For instance, at 50 kbps,
the decrease (compared to original x264 codec) in non-ROI
PSNR was 0.06 dB and 15.61 dB when the ROI area was
1% and 90% of the total frame, respectively.
In effect, when the ROI size is small, the proposed method
gives a considerably higher ROI PSNR and slightly lower
non-ROI PSNR compared to the original. However, when
the ROI is increased, the increase in ROI PSNR diminishes
and the decrease in non-ROI PSNR intensiﬁes. As a result,
the overall frame PSNR degrades with increasing ROI size.
V. CONCLUSION
In this work, we presented a novel approach to transmit
ROI at a higher quality than the non-ROI counterpart,
subject to the bandwidth constraint. The bandwidth usage
is maintained by the use of original H.264 rate control al-
gorithms which are proven to be reliable. The desired result
is achieved by decreasing QP for ROI and compensating it
in non-ROI without affecting the overall bit allocation per
frame. Thus this method can be easily integrated with com-
mercially available standard codecs to selectively transmit
the ROI at a higher quality for effective real-time remote
medical training.
