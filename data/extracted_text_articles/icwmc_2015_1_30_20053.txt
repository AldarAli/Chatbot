Abstract—In wireless communication systems, a received signal 
may suffer both short-term fading and long-term fading 
(shadowing). The simultaneous use of both microdiversity and 
macrodiversity is essential to mitigate channel degradations in 
composite fading environments. In this paper, a wireless 
communication system with microdiversity and macrodiversity 
reception in gamma-shadowed Ricean fading channels is 
considered. An exact and rapidly converging infinite-series 
expression for the average level crossing rate (LCR) at the 
output of the system is provided. Numerical results are 
presented graphically to illustrate the proposed analytical 
presentation and to point out the effects of system’s 
parameters on the observed characteristics.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In wireless communication systems, short-term fading, or 
fast fading, and long-term fading, or shadowing, occur 
concurrently [1][2]. This leads to composite fading models. 
Fast fading is the result of multipath propagation due to the 
effects of reflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering. 
Shadowing is the result of large obstacles and large 
deviations in terrain form between transmitter and receiver. 
It is possible to use various distributions to describe the 
fading envelope of the received signal. In technical literature, 
the most often used are Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m, 
Nakagami-q, Weibull, - [1]. The average power of the 
received signal is also a random variable because the 
shadowing is present at the same time. The distribution most 
often used for describing the average power is log-normal 
distribution. Sadly, the use of log-normal distribution does 
not lead to a closed-form expression for the probability 
density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
[3]-[5]. With this approach, the system analysis is very 
unwieldy. More recent papers have shown by both 
theoretical results and measured data, that gamma and 
lognormal distribution match sufficiently [6][7]. Such 
approach, with gamma distribution used for modeling the 
average signal power, leads to a closed-form expression for 
PDF of the SNR, what facilitate further analysis. 
The diversity technique is one of the most used methods 
for reduction of fading effects and upgrading the 
communication 
system 
reliability 
without 
enlarging 
transmitting power and channel's bandwidth. Diversity 
techniques combine in different ways the multiple signals 
received. In single base station, the microdiversity technique 
helps mitigate short term fading effects. The diversity 
technique that reduces the shadow effects is called 
macrodiversity. 
Macrodiversity 
is 
implemented 
by 
combining signals received by several base stations or access 
points [8]. 
The maximal-ratio combining (MRC) is an optimal 
combining method [1, p. 262]. It gives the best system 
performance. The selection combining (SC) is a fast 
response hand-off mechanism that instantaneously or with 
minimal delay chooses the best base station [9]-[11]. The 
microdiversity and macrodiversity reception can be done by 
using the MRC and SC algorithms, respectively. If the 
distance between antennas in the base station is of the order 
of one half of the wavelength, the fading channels at micro 
level will be independent [8]. On the other hand, shadowing 
has a larger correlation distance and it is difficult to ensure 
that base stations operate independently, especially in 
microcellular systems. 
The first order system characteristics (the outage 
probability and average bit error probability (ABEP)) of a 
wireless communication system with microdiversity and dual 
macrodiversity reception in composite Rician-gamma channel 
are analyzed in [7][12]. Because in some applications, such as 
in adaptive transmission [13], the outage probability and 
ABEP do not provide enough information for the overall 
system design, the system’s second-order statistics must be 
determined to pointed out the correlation properties of the

fading channels and to provide a dynamic representation of 
the system’s performance. Such characteristics are the level 
crossing rate (LCR) and the average fade duration (AFD). 
They are used for choosing the adaptive symbol rates, 
interleaver depth, packet length and time slot duration. 
Bandjur et al. [14] analyze the second-order statistics as 
continuation of a previous study of the first-order 
characteristics [7][10]. In this paper, it will be shown that a 
system with three microdiversity branches gives better 
performance than a wireless communication system with two 
L-branch MRC receivers at the micro level and a dual branch 
SC receiver at the macro level presented in [14]. The closed 
form expressions will be derived and shown graphically for 
some parameters. 
This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we 
present the system and channel model. The expression for 
average Level Crossing Rate is derived in Section 3. In 
Section 4, numerical results are shown graphically and 
parameters influence is analyzed. We conclude in Section 5, 
which highlights the main contributions of this paper.

SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODEL 
The model of the wireless communication system with 
three L-branches MRC receivers at microlevel and triple-
branch SC receiver at macrolevel, analyzed in this paper, is 
shown in Fig. 1.

where rij is the envelope of the faded signal at the j-th 
diversity branch of the i-th base station. 
If there exists a dominant line-of-sight (LoS) component 
in the propagation domain and the envelopes are statistically 
independent, Ri has the Rician distribution, which is given by 
[14, eq. (1)]:

where K is the Rician factor, which is defined as the ratio of 
the powers of the dominant signal component and the 
scattered signal components; Ωi represents the average 
power of the signal per base station branch; In(.) is the 
modified Bessel function of the first kind and n-th order [15, 
eq. (8.445)]; L is the number of branches at microlevel. 
The influence of the number of diversity branches on the 
system performance was examined and it is established how 
much the value of the bit error rate (BER) is reduced with the 
change in the number of branches [16]-[18].  
 
 
Figure 1.  System model. 
With the increase of the diversity order, the performance 
of the receiver is improved. However, a larger number of 
diversity branches reduces the additional gain and increases 
the complexity of the system. 
Therefore, it is necessary to find a compromise between 
the performance of the system and its complexity. The 
increase in gain is getting smaller with increasing the number 
L. The power gain is the highest when the system diversity 
order increases from L=1 to L=2; the gain is getting less with 
increasing of L from L=2 to L=3, and with further growth of 
L the gain is getting smaller. It can be noticed that the gain 
declines exponentially with the increase in the system 
diversity order [16, Fig. 2, Table I]. Also, the practical 
realization of the system becomes more complex and, at the 
same time, more expensive [16][17]. 
Hence, there is no need to significantly increase the 
number 
of 
diversity 
branches 
because 
the 
system 
performance improvement achieved with a few diversity 
branches would not increase further very much with the 
introduction of more branches. 
So, the limitation for the number of diversity branches in 
the microdiversity system is the trade-off between the 
complexity 
of 
practical 
realization 
and 
requested 
performance improvement [18]. The obtained results in 
previous papers enable us to find a compromise between the 
efficiency (which is measured by the value of BER) and the 
complexity of the receiver (measured by the number of 
receiving antennas). Thereafter, we have chosen L to be 
equal to 3. 
The PDF from (1) is conditional with respect to 
shadowing with Ωi being a random variable. In this paper, 
Ω1, Ω2 and Ω3 are correlated with each other and identically 
gamma distributed with the joint PDF given by [19]

AVERAGE LEVEL CROSSING RATE 
The average LCR at a specified signal level is defined as 
the rate (in crossings per second) at which the signal crosses 
the given level going towards the positive (or negative)

where Kn(·) is the n-th order modified Bessel function of 
the second kind.  
The most important problem with the infinite-series of 
expressions is their convergence. The formulas for the 
average LCR converge rapidly, and they can be efficiently 
used in performance analysis. Table 1 shows the number of 
terms required to be summed to reach a four-significant-
figure precision in the expression (7) for the normalized 
LCR.

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
The numerical results are graphically presented based on 
the analytical process given in Section III. They show the 
second-order statistical characteristics for various systems 
parameters. 
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 depict the normalized average LCR 
(NR/fm) versus normalized signal level (Rth=R/0). It is 
obvious that LCR increases as the value of normalized signal 
increases, until it reaches the maximum, for Rth=Rth0. Then, it 
starts to decrease. 
The influence of fading severity on normalized level 
crossing rate, versus normalized signal level, is presented in 
Fig. 2. One can see from Fig. 2 that the normalized level 
crossing rate decreases with increasing of Rician factor k. 
The system performance is better for greater values of Rician 
factor. This effect is more pronounced for lower values of 
the signal. 
The influence of shadowing severity and correlation 
coefficient to the normalized level crossing rate is presented 
in Fig. 3.

Figure 3.  Normalized average LCR versus normalized signal level Rth, for 
different values of shadowing severity and correlation coefficient. 
It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the normalized LCR is 
higher for smaller values of signal under higher shadowing, 
while for bigger values of the signal, the normalized LCR 
decreases as shadowing severity increases. 
It is also visible from Fig. 3 that the influence of the 
correlation coefficient on the normalized LCR is more 
significant for small signal values. The signal changes are 
faster for smaller distances between the base stations, i.e., 
when the correlation is bigger (ρ=0.6).

CONCLUSION  
 The received signal in wireless systems with 
macrodiversity and three branches microdiversity reception 
in Gamma shadowed Rician fading channel is analyzed in 
this paper. The numerical results for the average level 
crossing rate are presented graphically to illustrate the 
effects of the severity of fading and shadowing and 
correlation between base stations on the system performance.
