Next Generation IMPAQT Miniaturized Underwater Transmitter System Design 
 
Abstract - In recent years, terrestrial wireless sensor networks 
and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have developed 
rapidly. However, due to the limitations of Electromagnetic 
(EM) signal propagation in water, there is less development and 
advancement in the underwater wireless sensor networks 
domain. As part of the IMPAQT project, a novel wireless 
underwater telemetry platform using acoustics has been 
proposed. This telemetry platform has the potential to replace 
the underwater sensors cables and provide a wireless method to 
collect and transmit a variety of environmental sensor data 
under water. The proposed platform system architecture 
consists of several ultrasonic transmitter nodes and a gateway 
buoy as a data aggregator node to transmit the data from the 
sensors to the cloud for analytics to be carried out. Transmitter 
nodes will read the attached sensor data and transmit it to the 
gateway buoy. The gateway buoy will send the collected data to 
a data management system using a Long Range (LoRa) 
communication 
link. 
The 
next 
generation 
IMPAQT 
Transmitter node developed is a compact, low-cost, low-power 
acoustic transmitter node that has an external sensor interface 
to receive data from attached sensors is described in detail in 
this paper. In addition, the potential for short-range EM-based 
underwater LoRa communication is evaluated and described.

INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extension of a previous conference 
submission [1]. According to the latest United Nations world 
population estimation, by the year 2050, the population of the 
earth will reach approximately 10 billion people [2], and this 
increase will result in a higher demand for food and 
consequently seafood as it is one of the primary sources of 
protein and nutrition for many people. In the past, capture 
fisheries productions were the primary source of seafood, but 
this has changed in 2012, where aquaculture production 
volumes exceeded that of the traditional capture fisheries, and 
it is seen to be increasing rapidly in recent years to meet 
demand [3].  
To provide more sustainability, reduce environmental 
impacts, and promote economic gains, integrated multi-
trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is gaining popularity among 
marine farmers. In IMTA, farmers combine fed species (e.g., 
fish, shrimp, oysters) with extractive species (e.g., seaweed, 
mussels), and the extractive species will use the by-products 
of the fed species, reducing the environmental impact of the 
sites and also providing commercial profit to farmers.  
IMPAQT [4] is a European project aimed at promoting 
and supporting the development of IMTA sites by providing 
a multi-purpose (Inland, coastal, offshore), multi-sensing 
(heterogeneous sensors, biosensors, smart systems), and 
multi-functional (Monitoring, data analytics, decision 
making) data management platform  [5]. The IMPAQT 
project also aims at providing training based on the obtained 
data to the farmers and improving farming sector 
performance [6]. In Figure 1, an overview of the IMPAQT 
project has been proposed by Michalek et al. [7].  
 
 
Figure 1. IMPAQT Project overview [7]. 
As part of the IMPAQT Data acquisition system, a 
communications device was required to collect information 
from the underwater sensors and transmit it to the data 
aggregator system (DAS) to provide accurate, real-time, and 
relevant information about the underwater environment.  
As a result, a novel miniaturized low-power and low-cost 
underwater acoustic transmitter node and a gateway buoy 
receiver have been proposed as a telemetry system and 
evaluated to collect data from sensors and transmit it to the 
inland data aggregators.

The transmitter node has an optional extension sensor 
board, and the transmitter node is capable of interfacing with 
external commercially off-the-shelf sensor modules using an 
external sensor connector. Due to its small size and 
lightweight design, it has little impact on the working 
environment and the artefacts to which the sensors are 
attached.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
With the rapidly increasing and evolving aquaculture 
market sector, it is essential to monitor and analyze the effects 
of the methods that have been used in aquaculture to reduce 
the costs and improve the stability and sustainability of sea 
farms. Experimental monitoring in labs and tanks can help in 
establishing optimal best practices. However, due to the 
differences between the experimental environment and real 
aquaculture environments, it is hard to compare the findings 
accurately, especially when it comes to the biasing caused by 
the handling of marine animals [8]. In [9], M. Føre et al. 
proposed the concept of Precision Fish Farming intending to 
use scientific methods to manage fish production by enabling 
farmers to monitor, control and document the biological 
processes in fish farms. With the advancement of chemical 
and electrical sensing technologies, it is now possible to 
develop miniaturized attached sensor devices to track and 
study the natural behaviour of marine animals and plants in 
their natural environment. This section includes an overview 
of the current marine monitoring platforms and also acoustic 
telemetry platforms and modems.  
A. State-of-art marine monitoring platforms 
To achieve the goal of precision aquaculture and fish 
farming, in [10], J. A. Martos-Sitcha et al. describe the 
development of the AE-FishBIT, shown in Figure 2A, an 
ultra-low-power sensor device, for monitoring physical 
activities and respiratory frequency of the farmed fish, using 
the on-board accelerometer sensor. AE-FishBIT is a small 
non-invasive monitoring sensor with a footprint of 14mm x 
7mm x 7mm and a total mass of 600mg. AE-FishBIT is not 
able to transmit the data, and the fish is required to be 
captured to download the sensors data. 
Almeida et al. [11] monitored the behaviour of the 
Lusitanian toadfish using accelerometry data provided by the 
externally attached AccelTag, which was able to recognize 
and log behaviour activities of the fish. It is capable of 
continuously recording tilt, roll, forward acceleration, lateral 
acceleration, vertical acceleration of fish for more than 7 
hours. To download the recorded data, the tag needs to be 
extracted and connected to a computer to download its data. 
There are also devices for tracking the movement of the 
fish in dams, fisheries, and cages. In [12][13], authors have 
developed the Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System 
(JSATS), shown in Figure 2B, to identify and track the 
movement of juvenile salmon in dams and rivers. JSATS tags 
are incredibly compact that can be injected using a needle 
into the fish's body. They can transmit ultrasonic pings for a 
year with a 15-second ping interval. But JSATS tags are only 
capable 
of 
transmitting 
a 
pre-programmed 
unique 
identification code and temperature data, and as they are 
sealed, they cannot provide any other sensor data. According 
to the report published in the journal of “review of scientific 
instruments” [14], the latest version of the JSATS tags can last 
up to 285 days with the ping rate of 15 seconds and 98 days 
with the ping rate of 5 seconds at 163dB sound level, and each 
ping can travel up to 500m.

In [15], C. Brockmann et al. implemented an energy-
efficient system for monitoring fish in freshwater using high-
frequency RF transceivers, capable of operating for one 
month using a single coin cell battery, with a measurement 
and transmission duty cycle of once every second. They 
utilized a low-power sub-GHz RF transceiver, CC1101  [16], 
which transmits at 866 MHz. They implemented an EMG 
sensor and a temperature sensor inside the module. They 
reported that the device was able to transmit data out of the 
fish cage, and they measured -70.52 dBm as the Received 
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) outside of the fish cage. 
They also reported that the module was able to cover one 
cubic meter of signal traveling distance in the water, which is 
not suitable for open-water communication requiring a more 
significant range. 
Monitoring the marine environment parameters such as 
wave motion and light intensity, which are known to impact 
plant growth and harvest levels, is important in IMTA 
aquaculture scenarios. In a recent research, Peres et al. [17] 
developed a seaweed monitoring tag named AquaBit, shown 

21
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 14 no 1 & 2, year 2021, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/

in  Figure 3, to record the accelerometry data of seaweed 
movement alongside recording the temperature, light 
intensity, and water pressure of the marine environment that 
it is deployed in. This novel miniature low-power NFC-
enabled tag records the relevant seaweed growth parameters 
for roughly two weeks at a 52 Hz sampling rate, and the 
recorded data can be downloaded using the on-board NFC 
transceiver and a mobile phone or using a USB cable and 
provided Python-based host application.  
 
 
Figure 3. AquaBit seaweed monitoring tag [17]. 
Another method to monitor the marine environment is to 
use unmanned underwater vehicles. SeaSmart has introduced 
three patented wireless drones to collect environmental data, 
such as oxygen, salinity, biomass, and temperature, by 
travelling through the cage to collect data and returning to the 
surface to transmit the collected information to the cloud. It 
can also measure where the fish are in the cage, which can 
help farmers in their production and also feeding procedures. 
The SeaSmart Sensor Drone, depicted in Figure 4, can run 
24/7 for six months on a single battery charge [18]. 
 
 
Figure 4. SeaSmart drone  [18]. 
The Waterlinked company also has a solution for sensing 
aquaculture cages, called CageSense, shown in Figure 5. It is 
a network of various sensors and gateways that provide real-
time underwater sensing [19]. They provide a wireless sensor 
that can be attached to cages using zip ties, and they can 
report the oxygen, salinity level, and cage’s tilt and depth. 
There is a limited amount of information regarding these 
sensors at the time of writing this paper. 
 
Figure 5. Waterlinked Cage Sense monitoring system [19]. 
There are also efforts on monitoring IMTA and 
aquaculture sites using remote sensing technologies; in [20], 
C. C. Krueger et al. have used multi-sensor (satellite, 
unmanned aerial vehicle, and ground spectroradiometer) 
remote sensing techniques to monitor seaweed aquaculture in 
the Yellow Sea.  
There are also underwater modems that are of large size,  
bulky and designed for specific purposes, i.e., Underwater 
Robotics, etc. [21][22], and these are not designed for 
general-purpose marine environmental monitoring and are 
not reported in this paper. 
In summary, various sensors can be used underwater for 
monitoring applications, but in order to extract their datasets, 
many of these need to be retrieved for data download at 
regular intervals. Wired sensors also exist, but there are 
limited numbers of sensors with underwater wireless 
communications capability for data download and analysis in 
real time. 
III. 
MATERIALS AND METHOD 
As it can be inferred from the state-of-the-art monitoring 
systems, there is a lack of a general-purpose miniaturized, 
low-power, wireless underwater transmitter that can be 
integrated with other commercial and research sensors to 
provide a telemetry system to collect sensors’ information 
wirelessly.  
The focus of the IMPAQT telemetry platform is on 
providing a communication link for monitoring IMTA sites, 
where all sensors will be deployed in a bounded area, and it 
is considered that the gateway buoy will be located at a 
maximum distance 100m from each sensor tag. Although an 
ultrasonic platform would be the optimum telemetry 
platform, there is also the possibility to use an 
ElectroMagnetic (EM) based solution at the shorter range, 
where the gateway is installed at the water surface of a cage 
right above the sensor, where a range of few meters would be 
required. 
The transmitter needs to be miniaturized to enable 
integration with a wide range of sensors without requiring 
special mounting, and it should run on its own battery, to be 
able to communicate with the gateway node even in the case 
that the external sensor's battery is depleted. Having an 
internal battery and a battery management system also makes

it easier to manage the battery health and estimate the 
charging status.  
Considering the IMPAQT deployment requirements, 
there is a possibility of using electromagnetic waves 
communication at ultra-short range and ultrasonic waves 
communications at longer ranges. In the next section, the 
possibility of underwater electromagnetic communication is 
discussed, and a practical experiment carried out to confirm 
the results is explained.  
A. Underwater electromagnetic communication 
In various publications, researchers have studied 
electromagnetic waves propagation underwater [15][23]–
[25]. In underwater communications, the transmission range 
is dependent on all the power gains and losses that a 
communication signal experiences during the transmission 
process. The most significant factor in establishing 
underwater communication is path loss. Path loss is the 
amount of wave signal degradation that occurs when a wave 
propagates in a medium, and it degrades as it moves in the 
medium channel. The amount of degradation depends on the 
conductivity and distance that the signal has travelled, and it 
is usually called path loss attenuation.  
There are two primary path loss (𝑃𝐿) types that could 
happen in underwater RF communication. Attenuation loss 
and complex permittivity are shown as 𝐿𝛼,𝜀 in an underwater 
environment, and reflection loss (𝐿𝑅) at the surface, as shown 
in equation (1) below.  
 
 
𝑃𝐿 = 𝐿𝛼,𝜀 + 𝐿𝑅 
(1) 
 
The path loss model for an underwater environment is 
extensively 
discussed 
in 
[24][25] 
for 
far-field 
electromagnetic communication and in [26] for near-field 
communications (i.e. NFC, RFID). Although there are 
various theoretical models available, there are limited 
numbers of publications describing practical experiments. To 
evaluate the potential for short-range (all that is possible 
according to theory and modelling) EM underwater 
communication, a series of practical experiments were 
carried out in a freshwater river using off-the-shelf LoRa 
transceivers to validate the theoretical models. According to 
the theoretical studies, lower frequency EM signals should 
attenuate less in the water, maximizing the range as much as 
possible. However, lower frequency EM transceivers require 
a longer antenna, which is not optimal for IMPAQT project 
context.   For the evaluation of EM waves underwater, it has 
been decided to use a general purpose LoRa transceivers. 
Current state-of-the-art LoRa transceivers by Semtech, 
SX127x series, offer a receiver sensitivity of -133 dBm with 
the most optimal configuration [40] and they are working in 
a range of 169MHz to 868MHz, According to Maxwell 
equation and experimental models such as Lioyd [19] and 
Hattab et al.  [33] models, at the frequency of 169MHz the 
maximum travelling distance for the SX127x series should be 
around 2.3 meter in freshwater and less than 20cm in 
Seawater. Similarly, at 868MHz frequency, the travelling 
distance is limited to less than 110cm in freshwater and less 
than 13cm in seawater.  
For the experiment, a LoPy4 radio node has been 
selected as the controller and RF module. LoPy4 [27] is a 
compact MicroPython enabled radio node based on SX1276 
transceivers, designed to work at 868 MHz frequency. A 
transmitter and a receiver with identical setups have been 
prepared to communicate at 868 MHz frequency range, The 
diagram of the setup is shown in Figure 6, and the prepared 
setup is shown in Figure 7. An STM32F4-Disco board [28] 
has been used to control custom made SX1276RF1IAS 
modules, which have not been used in this test. It also 
monitors the external start switch to initiate the test procedure 
and synchronise the transmitter and receiver’s timings for 
logging purposes.   
 
Figure 6. Underwater RF evaluation board diagram. 
An SD Card is used for logging the communication 
packets statistics and network quality of service. As these 
evaluation setups are intended to be immersed underwater, 
two IP68 plastic containers [29] were used as system 
enclosures, and a silicon sealant material was used to seal the 
antenna connectors and control switches. Airtight plastic 
bags are also used to cover the enclosure and antenna to 
provide an extra level of water protection. Using a 70 
micrometer airtight plastic bag adds an extra layer of plastic 
between the antenna and water, which is inevitable. However, 
based on the practical experiments by Donmez [30] on 1mm 
plastic material and another experiment demonstration at 10 
GHz frequency on a range of plastic materials [31], the effect 
of a thin plastic layer can be considered to be negligible. 
Initially, an urban environment communication range 
test in free space was performed to confirm that the modules 
were correctly configured. The non-line-of-sight urban 
communication test was carried out near Tyndall National 
Institute [32] in Cork [51.898736, -8.483184]. In these tests, 
the transmitter characterisation node was installed on the 
second floor of a four-level building in the urban area and 
received signal strength was recorded while increasing the 
distance of transmission.

Figure 7. Underwater RF Evaluation platform. 
 
In Figure 8, an aerial image of the test and average RSSI 
is shown. The red line shows the path taken with the 
transmitter board. The LoPy4 868 MHz receiver node 
managed to receive the transmitter signals up to 240 meters 
away from the starting point, with no line-of-sight, with the 
presence of dense and high buildings in between the 
transmitter and receiver and the transmitter located inside a 
four-level building. This indicates that the setup was working 
as expected, and there were no loose connections or 
deficiencies in the RF transceiver setup. 
 
 
 
Figure 8. RF Evaluation platform air communication test. 
 
After testing the EM waves communication in the air, 
River Lee in Cork [51.898757, -8.483163] was selected for 
performing the EM waves underwater communication test. 
First, the salinity of the water was measured using a salinity 
refractometer. “Refractometers measure the degree to which 
the light changes direction, called the angle of refraction. A 
refractometer takes the refraction angles and correlates them 
to refractive index (nD) values that have been established. 
Using these values, you can determine the concentrations of 
solutions” [33]. The salinity of the River Lee water was 
measured, and it was approximately 0%, which means that it 
is a freshwater river. 
In the test scenario, the 868MHz transceivers were kept 
underwater while the receiver was recording the RSSI values. 
Then the distance between transmitter and receiver increased 
from 50cm to 120cm, as shown Figure 9. At 50cm, the 
average RSSI was -112 dBm, decreased to -120dBm at 
100cm, however at 100cm, the percentage of packet drops 
increased significantly, and at approximately 120cm, the 
communications were significantly degraded, and the 
average RSSI of the limited received packets were -130dbm 
approximately.  
 
 
Figure 9. EM RSSI vs Distance Underwater at 868MHz. 
The experiment proved that communication underwater 
using high-frequency, high-power radio frequencies is not an 
optimal solution even at a range of a few metres, as a 
consequence, starting from 100cm, the signals are seen to be 
significantly attenuated, and a stable communication link was 
not possible. The result is generally in line with the 
theoretical background, however, the signals got more 
attenuated possibly due to the transceivers antenna 
misalignment, refraction, and diffraction caused by the 
environmental factors in a non-ideal environment. 
By validating the theoretical results for underwater 
electromagnetic communication, it is concluded that the 
solution for IMPAQT sites would be using acoustic 
communication rather than electromagnetic communication. 
In the next section, underwater acoustic communication is 
discussed, and the relevant telemetry platform is proposed.

B. Underwater acoustic communication 
As 
in 
most 
Aquaculture 
sites, 
a 
long-range 
communications system is required to get data from the 
deployment site to the mainland, an ultrasonic underwater 
telemetry platform was developed as an alternative to the 
short-range EM transceiver system described in the previous 
section. In Figure 10, the proposed IMPAQT telemetry 
platform concept is shown, and this is described in the rest of 
this paper, and also the design method of the ultrasonic 
transmitter node is described. The goal of the transmitter is to 
transmit sensors data provided by an externally connected 
sensor to the gateway buoy using acoustic waves. The 
IMPAQT telemetry platform has been previously discussed 
in [34]. In comparison with the previous publication about the 
IMPAQT transmitter node design [34], in this publication, a 
simpler design with fewer components and smaller size is 
proposed. The on-board sensors were removed to lower the 
transmitter node cost, size and increase the battery life. 
 
 
Figure 10.  IMPAQT telemetry platform. 
The transmitter node needs to be miniaturized to 
minimize its impact on the deployment environment, and the 
system block diagram design is shown in Figure 11. 
The focus of this publication is on the detail associated 
with the ultrasonic transmitter design. It is anticipated that the 
complete transceiver platform (gateway and transmitter) and 
its deployment will be described in full in a follow on 
publication when the system as a whole is fully characterised. 
 
 
 
Figure 11. IMPAQT Ultrasonic Transmitter. 
 
An ultrasonic transmitter, in the simplest form, generally 
consists of a transducer (usually piezoelectric) to produce 
acoustic waves, a transducer driver to apply the voltage and 
current to the transducer terminals, a controller to modulate 
the data, and a boost converter to step-up the battery voltage 
to provide adequate ultrasonic vibration wave amplitude 
level for the acoustic transmission. In the rest of this section, 
each of these elements is discussed for the IMPAQT 
transmitter node. 
1) Transducer Element  
 Acoustic waves are the result of variations of pressure 
in a medium. The variation of pressure can be made by 
acoustic transducers. Piezoelectric materials are one the 
materials that are being used to convert electrical energy to 
mechanical displacement and vice versa. PZT (lead zirconate 
titanate (Pb[Zr(x)Ti(1-x)]O3)) materials are one of the 
widely used piezoelectric materials, and they have been used 
in different applications, in particular as fish tags 
[11][12][35]. In [36], four types of PZT materials’ 
(Customized Type VI, Type VI, Type I, and Type II) energy 
consumption, source-level, and frequency response have 
been compared in operation. From the energy consumption 
aspect, PZT Type I and II consume the least amount of energy 
per transmission compared to other types, but they provide a 
lower source level and lower frequency response compared 
to others. However, in source level and frequency response, 
the difference between the four types is about 6dB, for short-
range applications such as those in the IMPAQT project is 
not a primary factor.   
 As a result of the above comparison and also the 
availability of the commercial transducers, three commercial 
hydrophones have been short-listed, shown in Table I. From 
the provided list, for the receiver side, BII-7003 has been 
selected as it covers a wide range of frequencies, virtually 
enabling us to research various miniaturized transducers. It 
also has reasonable sensitivity and working depth.

For the transmitter, AS-1 from Aquarian scientific was 
selected since it has a wide frequency range of 1Hz to 
100kHz, and it is compact in size with a good working depth 
appropriate for the IMPAQT application. It is encapsulated 
in a polyurethane material, and its dimension is 12mm D x 
40mm L; it can operate up to 200m depth. It is important to 
note that AS-1 can act as a transmitter and also receiver. In 
transmitter mode, the transmitting sensitivity is 140dB SPL 
re 1μPa, 1 Vrms input at 1 meter, at 90kHz frequency [38].

2)   Acoustic path loss and transducer driver 
The pressure of the acoustic waves produced by a 
transducer has a direct relationship with the voltage applied 
to the transducer's terminal. To estimate the required driving 
voltage for the piezo transducer, to provide sufficient 
detection range in any application, it is necessary to 
understand underwater acoustic models and associated signal 
path loss. The ultrasonic wave emitted by the piezo 
transducers is attenuated by two main factors in an aquatic 
environment, spherical spreading loss and absorption loss 
[40]. The absorption loss coefficient (𝛼) depends on two 
variables, viscous absorption [41], and chemical relaxation 
effect [42]. Viscous absorption is significant at high 
frequency (above 100 kHz). At the low-frequency range (up 
to a few kHz), boric acid chemical relaxation is the primary 
source of absorption and for intermediate range (up to few 
100 kHz) magnesium sulphate is the main source of 
absorption [43]. In the IMPAQT Project, the ultrasonic 
frequency range will be used to communicate, and in the 
ultrasonic frequency range, viscous absorption and the 
magnesium sulphate relaxation effect is seen to be 
significant. The absorption loss coefficient ( 𝛼 ) can be 
estimated by the following simplified equation [43] :

Using (2) by substituting the parameters, an absorption 
loss of 12.3 dB per kilometer has been estimated for an 
infinitely narrow acoustic beam; however, in practice, beams 
spread as they propagate through the water, and as their area 
increase, they lose more power. If a transducer radiates waves 
equally in all directions, the waves will spread spherically 
from it. Thus, the transmission loss due to the spherical loss 
can be estimated using the following equation: 
 
 
𝑇𝐿1 = 20logR  
(5) 
Where  𝑇𝐿1 is the transmission loss due to the spherical 
loss, and R represents the distance from the source in metre. 
It is important to note that R is the horizontal distance in water 
rather than depth. Using the equation (2) and (5), the 
transmission loss (TL) at the distance of R can be estimated 
using equation (6) [40]: 
 
 
𝑇𝐿 = 𝑇𝐿1 +  𝛼𝑅  
(6) 
 
In the IMPAQT project, a maximum distance of 100m is 
considered between the transmitter and receiver nodes, which 
leads to an overall transmission loss of 41.2 dB at 100m. 
There is an online absorption loss calculator provided by 
National Physical Laboratory of United Kingdom, that can 
be useful to estimate the absorption loss coefficient [45]. The 
transmission loss as a function of distance for 42 KHz 
frequency (for the IMPAQT project) is shown in Figure 12. 
 
 
Figure 12. Acoustic transmission loss vs. Distance at 42kHz. 
 
To provide an adequate ultrasonics level, a voltage 
booster circuit has been implemented using the TPS61040 
controller, which can boost the 2.5-3.7v (LiPo cell voltage) 
up to 28v. In the proposed transmitter design, a voltage 
booster is configured to boost the voltage to 20v. Having a 
voltage over 25V requires capacitors in the voltage range of 
50V, which are bulky and not suitable for a miniaturized 
system. Hence, it has been decided to use 20V as the driving 
voltage level. It is 5V less than the maximum voltage of the 
capacitors, but it provides a safe margin in case of a high-
voltage ripple when driving the transducer. The average 
current of the piezo transducer can be estimated by (7) [46] : 
 
𝐼𝐴𝑣𝑔 =
2𝑄
𝑇 = 2𝐶𝑉𝑓 
 (7) 
 Where Q = Charge in the piezoelectric transducer, 
T=Period of the driving signal, C= 5nF (Static capacitance), 
V = 20v (Maximum Driving voltage), F = 42KHz (Resonance 
frequency). Using the parameters of the selected hydrophone, 
the average current would be about 8.4mA while transmitting 
at the highest sound level. At F=100KHz, the average current 
of AS-1 transducer would 24.72mA. It is important to note 
that these current consumptions are from 20v (boosted 
voltage) supply. If needed, these values can be converted to 
the equivalent current drawn from the battery using the 
Electrical Power (P) equations [76] and booster efficiency 
value.

 As the on-board microcontroller cannot handle the 
boosted voltage level and also cannot handle the required 
current directly, a driver is needed to supply the voltage and 
current to the ultrasonic transducer. The driver should be able 
to perform driving at the designated frequency (42KHz), and 
it needs to be low power and small size. Hence, an ADG1436 
analog switch IC has been used to drive the piezo terminals 
at the boosted voltage using PWM modulation provided by 
the microcontroller. ADG1436 has a 4mm x 4mm footprint, 
with 125ns transition period; theoretically, it can reach up to 
8MHz input frequency, which is significantly above 42kHz. 
 
3) Sensors and external interface 
 In the previous publication regarding the first design of 
the tag, an accelerometer sensor (LIS3DH), and a pressure 
and temperature sensor (MS5837-30BA) were included in 
the IMPAQT transmitter tag design to monitor the 
aquaculture environment and tag’s movement. In the latest 
version of the transmitter, these embedded sensors were 
considered surplus to requirements for the use case in 
question and that the transmitter would be used in 
conjunction with external environmental sensors. The 
external infrared sensor interface, TFBS4650, was also 
removed, as it required a specific external sensor design with 
infrared interface capabilities to be able to communicate with 
the tag. The infrared communications interface was replaced 
with a wired serial UART connector, which simplifies the 
integration of the tags with other commercial-off-the-shelf 
sensors. Removing the internal sensors and also the infrared 
interface not only reduced the transmitter’s cost significantly 
but also improved the expected battery life. It also simplifies 
the transmitter’s integration so that other researchers may be 
able to use it with few modifications in their own systems and 
sensors in the future. 
In the latest version of the node, external sensors can 
trigger the IMPAQT transmitter node to wake up from sleep 
mode to read the external sensor’s data using the wake-up pin 
fitted on the external connector. Also, there is an option to 
schedule a program for the node to wake up and read the 
external sensor data and transmit the collected data.  
 
4) Power consumption and battery management 
The transmitter tag runs on a 1200mAh LiPo battery with 
the Part number LP503562 [47]. There is a compact battery 
charger and a battery supervisor circuit on the board to charge 
and cut off the battery in the case of a full discharge. The 
transmitter consumes 10.5µA in the sleep mode, 62545µA in 
the transmitting logic-one, and 1290µA in transmitting logic-
zero (refer to Table II, which is based on data available on 
individual product datasheets) and considering the 1200mA 
battery, based on user configuration and desired transmission 
cycle, the battery can last from two weeks to six months. The 
current consumption for the STM32 microcontroller is 
estimated using STM32CubeMX microcontroller power 
profile estimator. 
 
To maximize the battery life, the tag can be programmed 
via an external interface to wake up and read the sensor's data 
at regular intervals, while also an external sensor or module 
can force the tag to wake up using the wake-up pin. 
IV. 
COMMUNICATIONS TEST RESULTS 
The transceiver system prototype boards, shown in 
Figure 13, have been developed and evaluated in seawater, 
and 100 bits per second achieved using on-off-keying at 
42KHz modulation frequency at the range of 92m.

During the test, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) value has 
been recorded while increasing the distance between the 
transmitter and receiver up to the range of 92m. The same test 
was carried out at two different depths to study the effect of 
depth on the SNR value.  The SNR values are shown in 
Figure 15, and it can be seen that by increasing the depth, the 
SNR improved. This was concluded to be as a result of noise 
affecting the signal from the water surface and terrestrial 
environment, and also less sound reflection from the water 
surface. The G percentage shows the receiver gain, which 
was adjusted based on the distance. The 100% gain in the 
receiver board is equivalent to 52dB, and 6% is 3.12 dB. 
 
 
Figure 15. Distance vs Acoustic SNR in seawater. 
 In addition to the deployment tests in a real marine 
environment, a collection of analog datasets has been 
captured in a tank environment, which is accessible in a 
GitHub repository for further studies and analysis [48]. The 
dataset contains the captured signal by the receiver board 
where the transmitter was transmitting a fixed batch of data 
in on-off-keying modulation and binary-phase-shift-keying 
modulation. A sample captured dataset is shown in Figure 16, 
where (B) is the ground-truth data that transmitted, (A) is the 
binary-phase-shift modulation received on the receiver side, 
and (C) is the On-Off-Keying modulation received on the 
receiver side. 
 
The datasets for each modulation are provided 
independently, and in the above figure, they merged for 
demonstration purposes only.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
By 
evaluating 
electromagnetic 
communications 
underwater, it is concluded that it is not suitable for far-field 
communications other than for extremely short-range 
applications, as the communication got blocked at 
approximately 100cm range at 868MHz transmission 
frequency, using high-power LoRa modules. An alternative 
longer-range communications mechanism was investigated 
by evaluating the effective parameters in acoustic 
communication underwater, and finally, the IMPAQT next-
generation ultrasonic transmitter has been proposed. This 
ultrasonic transmitter using an acoustic transmitter and a 
gateway buoy can help farmers and researchers to monitor 
and analyze the underwater environment wirelessly. It also 
enables the researchers to develop sensors and deploy them 
in the water without the need for a cable to be connected. The 
main novelty of this work is its size, the novel low-cost 
transmitter design, and that it is designed to be attachable to 
other sensors and modules with multiple sensor interface 
options. 
In the future, more studies can be done on the 
optimization 
of 
the 
battery 
consumption, 
bitrate 
improvement, and a more miniaturized design. Also, there 
would be an opportunity to connect the tag to the sensors 
developed by other colleagues in the IMPAQT project to 
provide a better understanding of underwater environments. 
Based on the components that have been selected, it is 
estimated that the final dimension of the tag would be less 
than 4 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm. This system will be tested in an 
aquatic environment alongside other sensors developed by 
the partners in the IMPAQT project and will report on in a 
subsequent publication. 
This project is a work in progress, and it is considered to 
improve aquaculture sites monitoring as a part of the 
IMPAQT project, which is ongoing, and deployment in the 
marine environment are planned for the coming period.
