Abstractâ€” This paper studies the differentially amplitude- and
phase-encoded (DAPE) quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
for the amplify-and-forward multiple relay system over indepen-
dent Nakagami-m fading links. A simple equal gain combining
(EGC) receiver is proposed to noncoherently combine received
signals from direct and multiple relay links and then detect the
DAPE QAM signals without any link side information. Based
on Beaulieu's series approach, an efcient bit error probability
(BEP) upper bound computation formula is derived for the EGC
receiver. Performance results show that the EGC receiver for
DAPE QAM provides better BEP than the conventional receiver
for differential phase shift keying modulation with the same
constellation size.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cooperative relaying technique [1]-[5] is an efcacious
method to realize distributed spatial diversity through the co-
operation of relay nodes in terms of radio resource and signal
processing. In [1]-[2], various cooperative transmission pro-
tocols based on half-duplex mode were developed to achieve
cooperative diversity. As mentioned therein, the amplify-and-
forward (AF) relaying protocol is a simple relaying scheme
in which the relays amplify the received signals from the
source and retransmit them to the destination. This paper only
considers the AF protocol due to its simpler operation and
lower complexity required at relays.
Coherent detection is considered in most relay systems,
which is based on the assumption that the destination can
obtain the channel impulse response (CIR) characteristics of
all transmission links [1]-[2]. However, in fast fading environ-
ments, it is difcult to obtain the accurate CIR information
at the destination through delicate link estimation. To reduce
the overhead for complicated link estimation in relay systems,
differential modulation has been investigated in [3]-[5]. For the
AF multiple relay systems using differential phase shift key-
ing (DPSK) modulation, a weighted gain combining (WGC)
receiver was developed in conjunction with approximate bit
error probability (BEP) analysis over independent Rayleigh [3]
and Nakagami-m [4] fading links. Optimal power allocation
for AF multiple relay system based on a simple BEP upper
bound was also considered in [3], [5] to improve the overall
system performance. Despite a wealth of past studies, the
DPSK modulation decreases dramatically in power efciency
when the modulation alphabet size is increased.
The differentially amplitude- and phase-encoded (DAPE)
(Ja; Jp) quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) [6]-[7] is an
effective technique to achieve high bit rate transmission with-
out CIR information at the receiver side. DAPE (Ja; Jp) QAM
employs a star constellation with Ja concentric amplitude
rings, each containing Jp phasors, and sequentially encodes
information onto the level changes of amplitude and phase
between currently and previously transmitted signals. Due to
its higher spectral efciency and better BEP performance than
DPSK, DAPE QAM was extensively studied in [6]-[7] for
single link communications. However, DAPE QAM is not yet
investigated for relay communications.
This paper studies the DAPE (Ja; Jp) QAM signals for AF
multiple relay system over independent Nakagami-m fading
links. Section II depicts the system and channel models.
In Section III, the conventional EGC receiver in [6]-[7] is
adopted to cater to the AF multiple relay system and shown to
operate without CIR or any sort of channel state information
(CSI) when compared to the noncoherent DPSK WGC and
coherent QAM receivers in [1]-[5]. Inevitably, in order to
meet the corresponding relay power constraint, the knowledge
of average source-relay signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR)
is still required at each relay for the EGC receiver, which
is a design requirement typical in all differentially coherent
AF multiple relay systems [3]-[5]. Based on a union bound
argument and a convergent innite series approach [8], the
analytical upper bound of BEP is derived for the EGC receiver
over independent Nakagami-m fading links in Section IV.
Performance results in Section V show that the EGC receiver
for DAPE QAM provides better BEP than the WGC receiver
for DPSK with the same constellation size.

EGC receiver but used by the WGC receiver. Thus, the EGC
receiver suffers the BEP performance degradation under the
scenario rd > sr. As also observed, when sr  rd
(e.g., (sr; rd) = (10; 1)), the EGC and WGC receivers for
DPSK perform almost the same because the gain variable of
the WGC receiver ql  1 for all l 2 ZL, and both EGC and
WGC receivers for DPSK are approximately equivalent. Fig. 2
shows that the diversity reception can effectively improve the
BEP performance. This performance improvement is, however,
achieved at the cost of using more relays as well as reducing
overall network throughput [4]. As indicated in Figs. 1-2, the
EGC receiver for DAPE QAM signicantly outperforms the
EGC and WGC receivers for DPSK. As also observed, the
BEP upper bounds for both EGC and WGC receivers are in
the better agreement with simulation when the average link
SNRs are sufciently larger and L > 1.
Fig. 3 demonstrates the BEP characteristics of EGC receiver
for DAPE QAM and DPSK as well as WGC receiver for
DPSK with link SNR estimation errors. Because the test
metrics depend on link SNR estimates for the WGC receiver
but not for the EGC receiver, in addition to the requirement
that all relay gains depend on source-relay link SNR estimates,
the EGC receiver for DAPE QAM degrades in BEP less than
the WGC receiver in the presence of link SNR estimation
errors. This explains that the EGC receiver is less sensitive to
link SNR estimation errors than the WGC receiver.
Fig. 4 compares the BEP characteristics among the EGC
receiver for DAPE (4; 16) QAM, the WGC receiver for 64-
ary DPSK, and maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver [2] for
coherent 64-ary rectangular QAM with Gray labeling. For
the coherent ML receiver, the decision rule is to declare the
