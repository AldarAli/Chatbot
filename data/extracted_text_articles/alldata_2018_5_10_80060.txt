Abstract—This paper describes the use of the single-linkage 
hierarchical clustering method in outlier detection for 
manufactured metal work pieces. The main goal of the study is 
to group defects that occur 5 mm into a work piece from the 
edge, i.e., the border of the metal work piece. The goal is to 
remove defects outside the area of interest as outliers. 
According to the assumptions made for the performance 
criteria, the single-linkage method has achieved better results 
compared to other agglomeration methods.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Manufacturing processes of metals that end up in 
different uses involve cutting and shaping of work pieces. 
During this process, the machine blades that cut or bend such 
pieces tend to become dull over time, resulting in certain 
defects, such as dents, scratches, impressions and the like on 
the work piece. 
This work addresses the problem of grouping defects 
around the border of a metal work piece from the 
manufacturing process of car body parts. Hence, the 
objective is to use cluster-based outlier detection in order to 
realize the clusters that form around the border. 
The outcome could help in deciding whether the work 
piece can be used as is, needs to be polished (reworked) or 
must be tossed. Furthermore, it can help determine at which 
point in time the cutting or bending blade requires 
sharpening or replacement; which falls in the category of 
predictive maintenance. 
Cluster analysis, a subfield of unsupervised learning, is 
used to determine homogeneous subgroups within a larger 
group of observations. Hierarchical clustering is the 
approach used to obtain clusters of defects. Variant linkage 
metrics were sought out during the work. The single-linkage 
method has turned out to yield the best results. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
Section II describes related work and general background. 
Section III describes the approach and methodology 
followed during the study. Section IV describes and 
discusses the results. Finally, in Section V, conclusions and 
future outlooks are discussed. 
II. BACKGROUND 
Outliers are observations that deviate from the remainder 
set of data. Outliers and their detection have been studied in 
different domains for a variety of applications.  
A. Related Work 
Statistical 
methods, 
supervised 
and 
unsupervised 
algorithms are found in literature to conduct outlier 
detection. These algorithms are further subdivided into z-
score, classification-based, cluster-based, distance-based etc. 
to be implemented on univariate or multivariate outlier 
detection problems. 
In [1], distance-based and cluster-based outlier detection 
algorithms were proposed. The goal was to improve the 
quality of data preprocessing and capture the underlying 
patterns using an outlier score for outlier reduction. 
Distance-based approaches fetch the top r % (percentage 
recall) of the data based on (dis)similarity measures. While 
cluster-based approach considers clusters with minimum 
number of objects as outliers.  
The k-means algorithm was used for clustering data and 
Euclidean distance of each object from its corresponding 
cluster centroid was recorded. Recorded objects were sorted 
according to their score and those falling below a certain 
score were eliminated. This work concludes that cluster-
based outlier detection outweighs distance-based. It was 
conducted on three R built-in health care datasets. 
In [2], outlier detection based on hierarchical clustering 
method was conducted to detect erroneous foreign trade 
transactions in data collected by the Portuguese Institute of 
Statistics (INE).This work involved statistical performance 
evaluation according to the criteria specified by the domain 
experts. Variants of linkage methods presented similar 
results, but the distance function had major impacts in 
fulfilling the criteria. The Canberra distance function with a 
threshold of 5 resulted in performance evaluations of less 
than 50% of transactions containing at least 90-99 % of the 
errors, which was better than the desirable target. 
This paper reports on an experiment on synthetically 
generated data that resembles manufactured metal work 
pieces with defects, using cluster-based outlier detection with 
hierarchical clustering.

B. Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering 
Hierarchical clustering is one type of method that creates 
a sequence of nested partitions, i.e., a hierarchy of 
homogeneous groups (clusters). The clusters are visualized 
in a tree-like structure named dendrogram [3] [4]. 
 
Figure 1. Example of a dendrogram. 
 
The hierarchy ranges from the lowest level (leaf), i.e., 
each observation in its own cluster, to the highest level (root) 
consisting of all observations in one cluster. There are two 
approaches 
of 
applying 
hierarchical 
clustering: 
agglomerative and divisive.  
 Agglomerative clustering works in a bottom-up manner 
where each object is initially considered as a single-element 
cluster. Similar pairs of clusters are merged repeatedly until 
all points are grouped into one root cluster. 
The counterpart approach is divisive clustering. It uses a 
top-down approach; starting from a root cluster and 
recursively splitting a heterogeneous cluster until each 
observation is in its own cluster. 
Merging and splitting of clusters is performed based on 
the (dis)similarity measures. The default measure is the 
Euclidean distance between two observations, whereas the 
measure between each cluster of observations requires 
cluster agglomeration (linkage) methods [4].  
 
Complete: uses the maximum (largest) value of the 
dissimilarities to link clusters 
 
Single: opposite to complete, smallest (minimum) 
value is considered 
 
Average: as the name describes, it takes the average 
value of the distance 
 
Centroid: computes dissimilarity between the 
centroids of the clusters 
 
Ward's minimum variance: minimizes the total 
within cluster variance. 
Figure 1 illustrates an example of a dendrogram, where 
the x-axis shows the observations of the data and the y-axis 
represents the cophenetic distance (distance between 
merging/splitting clusters). 
Hierarchical clustering method would be more stable 
approach rather than partitioning clustering techniques 
because it is not dependent on the initialization of the 
clusters. The commonly used agglomeration methods are 
complete, average and ward’s minimum variance, these tend 
to produce balanced trees, whereas, single and centroid tend 
to 
produce 
unbalanced 
and 
inversions 
of 
clusters 
respectively.  
III. APPROACH 
Data used in this work are synthetically generated images 
resembling a cut part of a car panel (metal work piece) with 
size 800 mm × 100 mm containing random defects. For this 
analysis, 25,000 datasets have been generated. 
Records in the dataset represent defects that occur during 
the cutting of the work piece in the production line. Each 
dataset contains 5 variables and observations in thousands or 
minimum of hundreds. 
Each dataset has the following variables and they are 
described as follows: 
 
ID: represents the i-th work piece image (0-24999) 
 
X: horizontal axis of the work piece in mm (0-799) 
 
Y: Vertical axis of the work piece in mm (0-99) 
 
D: depth of the defects in µm (micrometers) 
 
C: category (types) of defects as numbers (1 = dent, 
2 = scratch, 3 = pinhole) 
 
Table I shows some rows of data for a randomly chosen 
workpiece as an example. The variables of interest for 
clustering are the locations (X and Y) and depth of the defect 
(D). Data preparation was done by scaling the variables of 
interest, as they were measured in different units. The 
variables ID and C were removed as they had no influence in 
the formation of clusters. 
In our approach, agglomerative clustering applying the 
single linkage method based on Euclidean distance was used 
to conduct the formation of clusters. 
Clusters are identified either by cutting the hierarchy of 
the resulting dendrogram at a certain height or specified by a 
domain expert with a predetermined number. 
Since each dataset had different records of defects, for 
the present work the goal was to make the resulting clusters 
be dependent on the number of observations (n).  
The following formula obtained from [2] has been used 
for the number of clusters. 
𝑛𝑐  = max (2, 𝑛
10)  
(1) 
It influences the formation of clusters to be dependent on 
the number of observations within each dataset.

As performance criteria, assumptions of the production 
line were made. The first 2000 work pieces will not have any 
defects as the blade would be new and sharp. Therefore, the 
first 2000 generated records of data shall just have some 
generated noises which represent defects with minimum 
depth. These defects are of no influence in creating a cluster. 
In order to satisfy the assumption taken and also realize 
which synthetic data gave reasonable results, clustering 
tendency was assessed. Hopkins statistics, a statistical 
clustering tendency method, was used for assessing whether 
the data contained inherent grouping structure or random 
noises [4]. 
The result value of a Hopkins statistic is a probability 
which indicates whether the given data D) has non-random 
or uniformly distributed structure. The following formula 
shows how clustering tendency using this statistical method 
is obtained.

𝑦𝑖
𝑛
𝑖=1
∑
𝑥𝑖

𝑖=1
+ ∑

(2) 
Hopkins statistical probability (H) is the mean of the 
nearest neighbor distance in a simulated dataset (random D) 
divided by the sum of the mean nearest neighbor distances in 
the real (D) and across the simulated dataset. If the value of 
H > 0.5, then it is concluded that the dataset D has 
meaningful clusters [4]. 
As per the assumptions made for the performance criteria 
the first 2000 datasets had H < 0.5 and did not contain 
inherent groups, therefore, no clustering technique was 
applied to these datasets.  
The remaining datasets had H > 0.5. Hence, the next step 
was to apply hierarchical clustering using the single linkage 
method based on Euclidean distance and remove outliers.  
The approach used in [2] has been adapted to cluster and 
remove defects outside the border as outliers. The key idea 
was to use the size of the resulting clusters as indicators of 
the presence of outliers. In the case of this work, outliers 
would be those clusters with a number of elements less than 
some threshold τ.  
The threshold used is a fixed number which can be 
replaced based on the assumptions or a domain expert user 
sees fit. 
This method of outlier detection requires parameters to 
be specified. The main parameters are the number of clusters 
nc and threshold τ. Table II shows the algorithm for outlier 
detection adapted from [1]. 
Once the final cluster(s) is/are obtained the further 
analysis is done in order to determine which cluster(s) 
has/have defects in the pre-classified range.

The threshold parameter for this work has been fixed to 
50 indicating the minimum number of elements that a cluster 
should hold. The clusters with number of elements less than 
the threshold are considered as outliers and removed. The 
sample dataset ends up having one final cluster, as illustrated 
in Figure 4. 
 
Figure 4. Final cluster for 13800 using single linkage. 
Variants of agglomeration techniques were sought before 
deciding on the single linkage method. The results for the 
other agglomeration techniques did not fulfill our 
performance criteria, which aimed to find clusters around the 
border of the work piece. The other techniques either did not 
remove clusters, or removed clusters from around the border 
as a whole. The threshold used for the other agglomeration 
techniques is less than 50 because they produce balanced 
trees. The number of elements in all clusters was relatively 
similar. In contrast, the single linkage produced trees which 
are unbalanced, i.e., few clusters contained a large number of 
elements, whereas the rest had a small number of elements 
and were eliminated as outliers. Figure 5 shows the clusters 
resulting from different agglomeration techniques with 
different thresholds for sample work piece 13800.  
After having the final clusters, the depth variable is 
classified into three ranges; 0-9 µm, 10-19 µm and ≥ 20 µm. 
Figure 6 shows a histogram that illustrates the number of 
observations in each range within a cluster. This can be 
helpful to determine whether or not the metal work piece 
could be of use. 
Based on the result depicted above, it could be concluded 
that the 13800 metal workpiece is of no use as most of the 
defects have ≥ 20 µm. 
It is also of particular interest to follow a series of 
consecutive work pieces in the production process, in order 
to see trends and possibly predict – and hence, avoid – 
machine failures. Figure 7 illustrates how the number of 
elements within each range of the final cluster(s) changes 
through time. 
This information indicates the growth of defects with 
high depths in the production process through time which in 
turn could be used as an indicator when to replace or sharpen 
the blade in the cutting device. It can be concluded that after 
manufacturing about 10,000 work pieces, the blade requires 
sharpening or replacement.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this work, hierarchical clustering using the single 
linkage method has been used to determine clusters of 
defects around the border of metal work pieces. Clusters with 
a number of elements less than a fixed threshold are removed 
as outliers.  
Single linkage agglomeration makes up for an ideal 
choice to be used in outlier identification in comparison to 
other agglomeration techniques because it tends to produce 
unbalanced trees where observations are infused one at a 
time.  
Prior to determining clusters within each dataset, the 
clustering tendency of each dataset is determined. 
The results of this work indicate whether the 
manufactured workpiece could be of use, requires some 
polishing or is of no use at all. The indicator is for the 
sharpness of the blade that cuts or bends the workpieces, in 
order to have less or insignificant defects. 
Future outlooks for this work could be to use the 
obtained results in a classification problem where all datasets 
contain labels of good, ok and bad work pieces. Based on 
their labels, work pieces could be intelligently classified.
