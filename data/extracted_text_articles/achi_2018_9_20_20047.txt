Abstract—In text-based communication via social media, users 
can communicate using not only emoticons and emoji, but now 
also a third type of graphical symbol called “stickers.” This 
study focused on role of stickers in communication. A 
questionnaire was developed, which asked subjects to 
individually rate the usefulness of 25 features of stickers on a 
Likert-like scale. Using this questionnaire, a survey targeting 
211 Japanese college students was conducted. Data obtained 
from the questionnaire were compared by gender and degree 
of text-messaging dependency for each question item. Results 
indicated significant effects of dependency and gender. 
Keywords—sticker; emoticon; perceived usefulness; text-
messaging dependency; gender differences; text messaging. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, a new type of graphical symbol called a 
“sticker” has appeared in social-media-based text messaging 
applications [1]. This study focuses on the role of this new 
type of graphical symbol. Stickers play a role in transmitting 
emotions, similar to emoticons and emoji, but they also serve 
other functions [2]. Research comparing the features of 
emoticons, emoji, and stickers found that whereas emotional 
transmission is the main role of emoticons and emoji, 
stickers can also change the flow of communication and 
serve as an alternative to text messages [3]. This previous 
research [3] generated a detailed list of sticker features by 
administering a survey to hundreds of Japanese young adults 
who own smartphones and routinely use LINE messenger. 
Participants were asked to provide free-text descriptions of 
the usefulness of stickers. To examine the role of stickers in 
greater detail, a questionnaire was administered that 
contained questions related to each of these features. 
Previous research has examined gender differences with 
respect to emoticon use [4]. For example, various researchers 
have suggested that women use more emoticons in 
computer-mediated communication. Conversely, another 
study showed that, compared with women, men use more 
emoticons in blog posts [5]. Results related to gender 
differences in emoticon use are thus mixed [6]. A previous 
study examined the usefulness of emoticons, emoji, and 
stickers, and showed gender differences in usefulness ratings 
of these three symbol types [3]. The authors suggested that 
ratings were influenced by text-messaging dependency [7] in 
addition to gender. Namely, since symbols serve various 
roles, multifaceted effects of gender and dependency may 
appear within each role. This study separately examines 
these effects for each feature of stickers. 
We prepared a questionnaire asking subjects to rate the 
multiple features of stickers on a Likert-like scale based on 
that employed in the previous study [3]. Using this 
questionnaire, we surveyed 211 Japanese college students. 
Data obtained from this questionnaire were compared by 
gender and degree of text-messaging dependency for each 
question item corresponding to each feature.  
II. 
METHODS 
Survey participants were 211 Japanese students (110 
women, 101 men; mean age = 19.09; SD = 2.34) at 
universities in the Tokyo area. All participants possessed 
their own smartphone and regularly used messaging 
applications capable of exchanging stickers, such as LINE.  
We constructed questionnaire items based on previously 
identified sticker features [3]. This was done by consensus of 
the authors. This resulted in a 25-item questionnaire that 
asked participants to rate each sticker’s usefulness feature

using a 7-point Likert-like scale from 1 (not useful at all) to 
7 (very useful). These items are listed in Table 1. 
We 
measured 
messaging 
dependency 
using 
an 
abbreviated 
15-item 
version 
of 
the 
Text-Message 
Dependency Scale [7] modified by the authors. This scale 
comprises emotional reaction, perception of excessive use, 
and relationship maintenance subscales. Each subscale 
involves five questions scored on a 5-point Likert-like scale 
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). 
III. 
RESULTS 
To investigate the influence of gender and degree of text-
messaging dependency on each usefulness rating, we 
assigned gender (male or female) and dependency group 
(high or low) as between-subjects factors. We then 
performed a two-way analysis of variance for each item. 
Results indicated a significant main effect of gender for only 
the following items: “Using stickers makes it easy to convey 
emotions,” (F(1, 207) = 5.49, p < 0.05, ηp2 = 0.03); “Stickers 
are cute,” (F(1, 207) = 10.97, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.05); “Using 
stickers can end a prolonged exchange,” (F(1, 205) = 4.25, p 
< 0.05, ηp2 = 0.02); and “A text message is already included 
in the stickers,” (F(1, 206) = 14.05, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.06). 
Each of these significant differences indicate that women 
appreciate these features more than men do. 
A significant main effect of dependency group was only 
seen for the following items: “Stickers can express messages 
that cannot be expressed by letters,” (F(1, 204) = 5.63, p < 
0.05, ηp2 = 0.03); “The variety of stickers is abundant,” (F(1, 
206) = 7.10, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.03); “Using stickers makes 
interactions cheerier,” (F(1, 205) = 4.05, p < 0.05, ηp2 = 
0.02); “Sending stickers is a catalyst for interaction,” (F(1, 
207) = 6.97, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.03); “The stickers themselves 
become the topic,” (F(1, 207) = 7.53, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.04); 
and “Lighthearted communication is possible using only 
stickers,” (F(1, 206) = 6.79, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.03). Each of 
these significant differences indicates that the high-
dependency group appreciated these features more than the 
low-dependency group did. In addition, a significant main 
effect of the dependency group was seen in “Using stickers 
can convey facial expressions,” (F(1, 207) = 6.17, p < 0.05, 
ηp2 = 0.03). However, this significant main effect is qualified 
by the significant interaction of gender × dependency group, 
F(1, 207) = 4.15, p < 0.05, ηp2 = 0.02. To rate this feature, we 
performed a simple main effect test using Bonferroni’s 
adjustment to investigate differences among the dependency 
groups for each gender. The results suggested that the high-
dependency group rated this feature as more useful than did 
the low-dependency group among men (p < 0.01), but there 
was no significant difference among women. 
Only the following items were significant in the gender × 
dependency group interaction: F(1, 207) = 4.22, p < 0.05, ηp2 
= 0.02 in “Stickers can express subtle nuances”; and F(1, 
205) = 8.28, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.04 in “Using stickers facilitates 
interaction.” We performed simple main effect tests using 
Bonferroni’s adjustment to investigate differences among the 
dependency groups in each gender. The results showed that 
men in the high-dependency group rated these features as 
more useful than did those in the low-dependency group 
(“Stickers can express subtle nuances,” p < 0.05, “Using 
stickers relieves interaction,” p < 0.01), but there were no 
significant differences among women. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
Regarding ratings of sticker roles, we found that some 
ratings are influenced by gender and some by degree of 
dependency. Further, there are both overlapping and unique 
parts within the scope of these influences. 
Some features in which gender differences were found 
are functions common to both conventional emoticons and 
emoji. Many previous studies have found that women have 
higher affinity for emoticons and emoji than do men, while 
other research has shown no gender difference, or even 
opposing findings [6]. This study, which focused on stickers, 
may explain the mixed results related to emoticons and emoji. 
Gender differences were seen in the ratings of some sticker 
roles that are common with emoticons and emoji, but there 
were also effects of text-messaging dependency.  
Roles related to the overall impact on interaction, such as 
“Sending stickers is a catalyst for interaction,” and “The 
stickers themselves become the conversation topic” appear to 
be roles unique to stickers [2][3]. There was no gender 
difference for these roles. The Text-Message Dependency 
Scale [7] measures how people perceive their usage of text 
messages along with their attitudes toward compulsive text-
messaging in the context of interpersonal relationships. In 
particular, high-dependency groups tend to fear disruption of 
relationships in the absence of text messages [7]. Therefore, 
the high-dependency groups may be more careful in 
maintaining interactions via text messaging, and use stickers 
to accomplish this.
