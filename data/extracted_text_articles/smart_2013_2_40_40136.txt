Abstract— Resident of a smart home, who may be an
Alzheimer patient needing permanent assistance behaves non-
linearly to achieve the intended goals. He actuates the world by
realizing actions, activities which can be observed through the
embedded
sensors
of
the
smart
home.
To
assist
him
automatically and live independently at home, it is needed to
capture information and knowledge from world to reason if
the world state is normal and to evaluate how much the
intelligent system succeeds; therefore, for recognizing the
activities and their correct realizations, we propose to consider
the activities as a sort of fuzzy temporal concepts that can be
formalized as a multivariable function. Perceiving the world,

These
hypotheses
are
resumed in a smoothing line and at the recognition time, the
activities functions check how much the observations are close
to their smoothing line. Finally, the activities are ranked based
on the inferred similarities to the observations. All the
introduced processes are data-driven and a case study that
deals with recognition of simultaneous activities based on the
proposed modeling approach is presented.

INTRODUCTION
Recently proposed works on activity recognition show
effective but unreliable results. They are still dependent on
the expert’s knowledge in both learning and recognition
steps; on one hand they presume activities are realized in
ambient environment, but on the other hand they recognize
each activity by consideration of only a few especial
attributes. Therefore, they do not propose a totalitarian
supervisor system that is capable to reason in all of the
possible events that may occur every time and everywhere
of the ambient environment. The result is that they cannot
verify correct realization of activities.
One more major reason that made these approaches
impractical is that their reasoning system is not flexible
enough to handle existing uncertainty in input data;
especially they are not capable to distinguish for what
context, which inputs may play more important roles in
activity recognition. In other words, they expect that the
activities are performed in standard and rigid structures in
order to be recognized.
In order to contribute in activity recognition, in the
current work, we propose an approach that not only deals
with data-driven activity recognition, but also proposes how
to recognize correct realization of activities. Furthermore,
we propose an extension of an event-driven approach, which
is published in [2] and [9]. In that approach, we formalized
an activity as a dynamic entity that can be recognized
through recognitions of the fuzzy events caused by the
activity realization (see Figure 1).
Figure 1.
Activity of “coffee making” modeled as chain of fuzzy events
In order to perform a data-driven process to discover the
fuzzy-events, we proposed to divide the world into two
general
parts,
one
of
them
representing
the
static
characteristics of the activities (fuzzy context [12]) and the
other representing the characteristics that dynamically
change while the activities are realized (activities fuzzy
states [13]). As a consequence, it is proposed to perform
classification process to group the common fuzzy states of
all activities in order to provide shortly all the learnt
knowledge in a decision tree format. By this modeling
approach, we could estimate the intention of the resident
and predict the events that may occur in the future when a
few elementary actions of a known plan or activity are seen
[9].
The mentioned approach includes some limitations that
are the subject of the current work: (i) The reasoning in
recognition of activities can be done only when an action is
performed in the world, so it does not reason in normality of
the current momentum observations. Therefore, we desire
the ability to do real-time reasoning. (ii) If more than one
activity is realized (simultaneous activities), it does not
recognize these correct activities as the normal world states.
Moreover, interruption of activities cannot be surveyed.
In this paper, we propose to consider the activities as
fuzzy
temporal
concepts
that
can
be
formalized

Here, “y” represents the activity function, “x” represents
the variable that activity depends on, and “α” and “β” are
the variables’ factors in activity model. In order to achieve
this model, we calculate the fuzzy contexts of the activities,
then, the hypotheses around the observations taken from the
activities realizations are generated and formalized as the
fuzzy states of the activity. Each fuzzy state is represented
with a fuzzy cluster center. In the next step, by performing
smoothing techniques, all the mentioned fuzzy cluster
centers are traversed through a line or curve in order to
collect all possible activity states so that we calculate the
activity’s function (“y”).
The reasoning for activity recognition will be done
based on the discovered similarity between the observation
and the activity formula. Then, the activities are ranked
based on the inferred similarities to the observations. For
instance, in Table I, we have illustrated twenty observations
from a typical activity through six sensors (activity’s
variables), in which one of them is time and the other ones
are the distances of the objects to special points in the
environments.
TABLE I.
OBSERVATION OF THE SIX WORLD ATTRIBUTES IN TWENTY
STAGES (SYNTHETIC DATA)
In order to break the world observations into two groups
of context and activity states, we apply the subtractive
clustering method [3]. The cluster estimation process is
performed based on the similarities discovered between the
data points. In Table II, we illustrated how the world is
perceived. We presented several hypotheses in order to
explain the observations if different cluster sizes (Influence
Range) are desired. For example, one hypothesis is that
activity transits four fuzzy states (coded as 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4
in Table II) and the sixth variable indicates the fuzzy
context of this activity (symbolized by © in Table II).

we will calculate a function that represents the behavior of

process.
Finally,
a
function
representing the activities characteristics is estimated.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
some preliminary theories about the proposed approach and
justifies the choice of multivariable learning. Section III
describes the formalizations and definitions concerning this
framework which serves as foundation for modeling the
recognition process. Section IV explains the process to
estimate the activity function as an important step for
recognition. Section V presents our method to survey the
simultaneous activities by using the estimation of the

activity function model. In Section VI, a case study is
presented in order to show experimental results and
validation of the proposed approach. Finally, Section VII
concludes the paper and outlines the future developments of
this work.
II.
ACTIVITY AS A FUZZY CONCEPTUAL SYSTEM
In this paper, we regard the “activity” as a type of fuzzy
dynamic conceptual system. In fact, it is presumed that an
intelligent system directs realization of the activity concepts
in the virtual world of temporal datasets. In order to explain
better this viewpoint we refer to the system theory [14],
where, a system is defined as a set of interrelated objects
that collaborate together in order to achieve a goal. A
system has a boundary with its environment. It takes input
from its environment, it processes it, it gives output to its
environment, and it directs this output according to the
taken feedback from the environment. For a system, we can
imagine machine states and a hierarchy of subsystems.
Here, the term “conceptual system” refers to a system that is
composed of non-physical entities, i.e., ideas or concepts
and concept is an abstract idea or a mental symbol, typically
associated with a corresponding representation in language
or symbology [15]. In conclusion, a conceptual system is
simply a conceptual model [16].
An activity is a conceptual system because it respects the
systems’ specifications: (i) it consists of a set of interrelated
variables which represent the world attributes, especially,
the object’s locations; (ii) it is realized to achieve a goal
(especially the world state); (iii) it has a boundary with its
environment, which is defined through fuzzy state and fuzzy
context; (iv) it takes input from its environment by
performing observation, it processes it, and it gives output
to its environment by accomplishing an action in order to
change the world attribute. For an activity we can define
fuzzy states [13] and a hierarchy of concepts such as actions
[4]. An activity is a dynamic conceptual system because its
state depends on time [16] and since fuzzy set operators are
applied to model it, an activity is regarded as a sort of fuzzy
dynamic conceptual system.
A.
Fuzzy contexts of the activities
Contexts are the surrounding conditions where activities
are realized [12]. The fuzzy context refers to a set of
variables in which they would keep a stable interrelation
while the activities are realized. At the recognition time, any
change in the context is interpreted as abnormality of the
world state. For example, if a human wakes up at 6 o’clock,
then it indicates a normal world state for the activity
recognition problem, but if he wakes up at 2 PM, then it can
be inferred that he is sick and there is an anomaly.
One other benefit of the consideration of contexts is that
it helps with the identification of similar activities. When
similar activities are performed in different contexts, they
represent different concepts and in this way we can
distinguish these different concepts. For example, if a
human eats in the morning, it means that he is having his
“breakfast”, but the same activity (eating) at 12 o’clock
means that he is having “lunch”. In the next part we will
deal with formalization of the fuzzy context.
In our view, context is a fuzzy term and it can be applied
to multi-variable problems such as ambient environments,
where multiple features of scenarios are observed. In the
real world problems, any sensor data may vary (even
partially) while the activities are realized. Sometimes these
changes should be taken into account because this variation
could be significant, but sometimes they should not be taken
into account because the variations of sensor data are not
significant to recognize the activity. We apply a fuzzy logic
based clustering approach in order to survey different levels
of details of occurring events in different levels of certainty
and survey the activity models in their own contexts. The
benefit of fuzzy context estimation is that it reduces the
process complexity and focuses the calculations of the
modeling on the role-playing variables.
B.
Fuzzy states of the activities
Fuzzy state represents a general and brief description
about the current status of the world. When an activity is
realized, the world would transit a chain of fuzzy states (see
Table II). However, this transition would be done in a
special fuzzy context. Each activity is regarded as a
sequence of fuzzy states (see Figure 1). In fact, when an
activity is performed, the world would transit a chain of
fuzzy states and the system achieves its goal while the
activities are realized.
An intelligent system is assigned to direct the realization
of an activity. Then, the perception of fuzzy states and fuzzy
contexts would indicate how to repeat realization of this
activity. For this system, the fuzzy context represents the
system environmental and external conditions for realization
of the activity, but the fuzzy states represent the procedures
or the actions that should be performed by the system in
order to realize the activity. In fact, the fuzzy states
represent the internal states of this system and the events
that would occur inside this system (see Figure 2).
Figure 2.
Fuzzy state and fuzzy context for realization of an activity
In Figure 2, we can see that although the types of the
fuzzy contexts and fuzzy states are similar, the objective of
their consideration is different. In fact, one represents the
conditions for a scenario to be realized by an intelligent
38

SMART 2013 : The Second International Conference on Smart Systems, Devices and Technologies

system, and the other represents the way that the scenario
can be realized in the world. Therefore, it is presumed that
in order to realize an activity the world is divided into two
sections, which are system intern and system extern. The
world features that should be unvaried during the activity
realization are considered as the fuzzy context members and
the attributes that would be varied (played) for activity
realization would be taken into account as the fuzzy state
elements. The boundary between a system intern and system
extern is not a fixed, stable or definitive border. This logical
boundary can dynamically change and new attributes can
join the system environment (fuzzy context) after a few
steps in activity completion.
III.
FORMALIZATIONS
Here, we introduce a modeling process to learn the
activities. The main function of activity modeling is to
recognize them and to reason in the correct realization of the
activities. Moreover, we would be able to judge if the world
state is normal, or if the smart home resident needs
assistance [10].
The “world” of the proposed learning problem is
observed through a set of applied sensors “S”. “si”
represents sensor “i” from the set of applied sensors; “n”
refers to the number of sensors or variables and “a” refers to
a typical activity. Goal “G” is achieved when “a” is realized,
so, in rather most of the cases, we can imagine that a goal
achievement
is
equivalent
to
an
activity
realization.
Presuming that the reality is the state of the world attributes
as they actually are, the world is the collection of attributes
that are observed from the world accompanying their
observed values. In ambient environment the world is
observed through a set of embedded sensors “S” where “si”
observes the i’th attribute of the real world out of the “n”
observed features. We refer to “si” at time “t” by “vi,t”; “T”
is the number of times that observation is done.

where “si” is the i’th sensor of the observing sensor, the
val() function captures the value of the sensor “si” at time
t
T
. The observations are done through “n” sensors for
“T” times. RFID sensors or generally, any kind or sensors
that generate any amount of values v or the ones that
generate 0-1 values are the data types that are accepted.
Because activities are realized and observed in an
ambient environment, we expect the observed world is
affected
by
no
event
occurring
out
of
the
ambient
environment. Moreover, we presume that all possible world
states are observed within “T” observations. Therefore, in
this paper, the Activity Recognition Reasoning System
(ARRS) supposes the world is closed or in other words it
benefits from the Closed World Assumption (CWA), which
is a presumption that what is not currently known to be true
is false [17]. So, it is presumed that if no explanation for an
observation is found, then we infer that the world is
abnormal or an erroneous activity is realized.
Definition 3.2 (momentum observation). This is the set
of digitized numeric values taken from each sensor and
registered into a temporal dataset, which indicates the world
quality at once. In other words, an observation is a line of
data-record inside of a temporal dataset which registers
frequently the measured world qualities. It is presumed that
per
observation,
the
world
attributes
are
observed
simultaneously and synchronously, so that at a record of
observation we can find all the measured attributes refering
to a unique world state. For example, we will not have the
world temperature at time 12:00 with the world light at time
13:00 within a single data record. That is to say every
attribute of an observation refers to a single reality or each
attribute explains a property of a single object (observation)
A temporal dataset would indicate a set of observations.
If the observations concern an activity realization then a
temporal
dataset
consisting
from
multi-attribute
observations is formed. We represent the set of observations
in a matrix format, where the consisting elements are the
values that indicate the quantified world’s qualities. It may
be sorted by a world attribute such as time:
Definition 3.3 (variable state). Each variable of the
observation
matrix
represents
a
value
concerning
an
observed world attribute or an activity feature. This value is
given to the variable according to the measurement that a
sensor does from the concerning attribute.
For example, in Table I, in each column we can see
twenty states per each variable. Here, a set of variable state
is defined as the values that a sensor generates. The
important point in here is that the definition of a variable or
sensor state is dependent on the time, so by elapse of time
new data records are created and new variables states can be
created. Considering the role of time, we face two groups of
variable states. The first group of states refers to the values
that in several moments the variable stops and causes a
relatively stable state within that value. For the other group,
there are also transition states that demonstrate transition of
a variable from a stable state to other stable states. In order
to distinguish these two transition and stable states in a
data-driven manner, we consider the time factor, so when a
variable stays at a definitive value for a relatively long time,
then this value is a sensor (variable) state and if a variable
stays relatively short on a definitive value, then it is a
39

transition state. In this paper, by the world state we refer to
the
stable
state
Here, “Ɛ” is the minimum delay for stay of a value in order 
to be recognized as a stable state. In the following parts of
this paper when we talk about variable state, we refer to the
stable variable state.
For each action that a smart home resident performs (in
order to complete realization of an activity), the state of one
or more sensors may be actuated, so their monitoring digital
numeric
value
may
be
changed.
Therefore,
the
accomplishment of simple actions in smart home is mapped
as a time series of events in the temporal datasets. During
the realization of activities, we can see each sensor stay
temporary or permanently at definitive values. This stability
at definitive values causes consideration of a world state.

in which “t” refers
to the time of observation and indicates all observed
attributes at time “t”.
World state represents a short estimation from the world
quality. The world quality is estimated depending on the
observed attributes. If more attributes from the world are
observed, then a better estimation from the world state is
provided and the difference between similar world states is
better distinguishable. For example, in Table II, considering
the world is observed frequently, each record of the
gathered
temporal
data
represents
an
instantaneous
estimation from the world quality. In other words, each
record of the observation matrix represents a momentum
world state at the concerning moment.
The important point here is that the definition of world
state is dependent on the time, so by the lapse of time new
data records are created and new world states can be
created. Considering the role of time, we face two main
groups of world states. The first sort of states refers to the
moments that entire variables stop in their old values and
cause a relatively stable world state. There are also
transition states that demonstrate transition of a world state
from a stable state to other stable states. In order to
distinguish these two transition and stable states in a data-
driven manner, we consider the time factor, so when the
world stays at a definitive sets of values for a relatively long
time then it causes a world state and if the world stays
relatively short on a definitive sets of values then it is a
transition state.
In the following parts of this paper when we talk about
“world state” or “home state”, we refer to the stable world
state. With the exception of the expression of the world state
per moment of observation, there are several other ways to
express the world states; we can view the world regarding
other variables’ states in order to estimate the world state.
For example, we can view the world represented in Table II
by this expression:
“The world state in which the distance of sugar to RFID
antenna 2 is high and the distance of glass to the RFID
antenna 2 is high.”
In this statement, we pointed out to the second and
fourth record of the observation matrix. Therefore, world
state is a record or a group of records from the observation
matrix which are subjected to variable limitations.

In temporal subtractive clustering process, the cluster
centers are discovered based on two parameters: (i) the first
one is a cluster of similar observations of a single sensor.
For each cluster (containing similar data points), a cluster
center is discovered in order to represent its concerning
cluster members; (ii) the second one is a cluster of similar
momentum observations, which are a row in “Oi,t”. For each
cluster (containing similar observations), a n-dimensional
cluster center is discovered in order to represent its
concerning cluster members. The symbol “n” represents the
number of observing sensors or the variables: {1<i<n}. For
detailed information about the cluster center estimation
using subtractive clustering approach, which is not the main
focus of this work, please refer to [3]. Through the process
of cluster center estimation we can calculate the fuzzy
sensors state and fuzzy world state.

members.
One important point here is that the selection of different
influence ranges in cluster center estimation would lead to
different interpretations from the sensor observations; so,
different data points with different quantity of the cluster
centers are proposed as the sensor states. In order to take
this parameter into account and point to a special sensor
state, we would have:

In here, “a” refers to the activity that is realized to
achieve the goal “G”, IR is the desired detail/generality
from the data and “k” points to k’th cluster center ordered
by t . “IR” is the influence range or the cluster radius rate,
which defines the clusters’ sizes; therefore, the cluster
centers would represent similar data points, where the
similarity criterion is the cluster radius. Influence range
factor is a relative factor and it depends on the range of the
data points. It should be mentioned that depending on the
cluster radius, different cluster centers may be discovered.
Therefore, for each temporal dataset, different sets of data
records representing the total dataset may be discovered.
In the next part we will discuss that combinations of
fuzzy sensors’ states would lead to creation of fuzzy world
states.

groups of similar world states. It is calculated as a result of

indicated to other world states.

where “a” refers to the followed activity; “IR” refers to the
range of influence or the relative similarity degree, and “k”
refers to the k’th (out of “T” possible fuzzy classes) data
point that absorbs similar data points around at the influence
range of IR; “k” also represents the number of fuzzy states
that are transited, so that activity “a” is realized. A fuzzy
state may include (subsume) one or more rows of the OS,G
matrix. For example, on the data of the Table I we can apply
fuzzy clustering process on the data points in order to
extract
the
points
(cluster
centers)
that
the
data
is
concentrated around them, so they represent different
existing qualities of the data points, which are similar to the
majority of the data points. The result of this process is
demonstrated in Table II. In there, we have shown that if at
cluster radius is selected as IR =0.7, then the world would
be divided into seven fuzzy states. If at running time a
relatively high similarity between the current observations
and the learned fuzzy cluster centers is observed, then it can
be inferred that the observations may belong to realization
of the surveyed activity.

“FAa,IR” represents the points (cluster centers) that each
variable (data of a column) regarding to itself or regarding
to other variables (data of other columns) would have a
meaningful concentration around. Each row of the “FAa,IR”
matrix is in fact a fuzzy world state. In this definition, ‘n’ is
the number of columns (variables or sensors), then it can be
inferred that activity “a” would ‘m’ times change the world
state to achieve the goal “G”.
Definition 3.9 (Fuzzy context). Fuzzy context is referred
to as “C ” and it is the set of variables that do not play any
significant role in both realization and recognition of the
activity
“a”
such
as
.
The variable “si” during the time of the activity “a”
realization does not vary significantly and it is fixed to value
“
iv ”; this value is calculated through the cluster center
discovery process. Fuzzy context indicates the surrounding
circumstances that scenarios or activities are realized in. The
fuzzy contexts of the activities indicate the conditions in
which the activities models are valid. A change in the fuzzy
context may cause invalidity of the system’s perception of
the activities; so, it will be taken into account as a new
activity model.
Therefore, any knowledge extracted from
the observations is valid only if the similar context is met.

IV.
ACTIVITY FUNCTION ESTIMATION
As it was mentioned earlier, one of our contributions in
this paper is to propose a multivariable function in order to
recognize it. The goal of this function is to recognize the
activities and in order to do that, it transfers the observations
to the model space, which is the activity space. This
function is represented by “ya”, in which “a” refers to the
surveyed activity. For instance, if we consider the positions
of the “glass” and “sugar” objects in realization of the
“coffee making” activity, then the “ycoffee making” transfers the
observations of the concerning sensors to the activity space
in order to verify how much it is similar to the coffee
making activity (see Figure 3).
Figure 3.
Activity function
The way that this function works is based on the
discovered
similarities
between
observations
and
the
activity structure. Therefore, it is expected that this function
reasons in both momentum observations and the series of
observations to recognize the ongoing activity. In order to
discover this function, we calculate equivalent of a curve or
a line that traverses the activities’ cluster centers. When an
observation is recognized as similar to at least one of the
activity’s fuzzy state, then it can be inferred that it may
possibly justify the realization of the activity. The sensors
are the variables that the activity function depends on and
based on their generated numerical values we can model or
recognize the activities. Presuming that we intend to
calculate a line that traverses the cluster centers of the
Fuzzy Activity (FA), the resultant line is reported in the
following equation:

Here, “ya” indicates the similarity degree to the activity
model and “a” is the activity.
A.
Sensor data smoothing
Dataset smoothing is a creation of an approximating
function that attempts to capture important patterns in the
data points [18]. The resultant smoothing line, traverses
normally the data points otherwise it passes near with
relatively closed distance. In the case that the smoothed
values can be written as a linear transformation of the
observed values, the smoothing operation is known as a
linear smoother; the matrix representing the transformation
is known as a “smoother” matrix or hat matrix.
There are several ways to smooth the data points and
each of them can be customized according to the problem.
Here, we suffice to introduce some famous smoothing
methods, which are moving average, Local regression using
weighted linear least squares with a polynomial model,
Savitzky-Golay filter, and Kalman filtering [19]. Generally,
these methods are different in the way they treat the existing
noise of the data and in the linearity of the smoothing curve.
For example, in Figure 4, it is graphically illustrated how a
smoothing line resumes the observations of a sensor
(location of the glass) using a linear smoother.
Figure 4.
Smoothing of the sensors’ observations
In Figure 4, we have presented that the sensors
observations can be described by a line calculated by a
linear smoothing technique such as linear regression [20].
B.
Temporal behavior of the sensors
Behavior of the sensors in realization of the activities
can
be
estimated
and
model
through
application
of
smoothing technique.
Definition 4.1 (Sensor’s linear Temporal Behavior).
Applying linear regression, we can calculate the sensors’
data trend while the activity “a” is realized. Performing this
process, the observations of the sensor “i” will be calculated
in the following equation:
, ,
,

a i t

Here,
, ,
sa i t
represents the average value of the “si” at
time “t” in realization of activity “a”. “β” and “τ” are the
smoothing line factors calculated from the linear smoothing
process obtained by the equation:

The calculations are done per each activity in the set of
activities “A”. The “T” is the activity duration. Because
there are several smoothing methods and for each method
different factors for data trend are proposed, from here, we
refer to the “β” and “τ” by the term “smoothing factors”.

Each sensor during different activities may present
different behavior. Therefore, by verifying the sensors’
behaviors, we can find which activity is the most possible
ongoing
activity.

The symbol “j” refers to the j’th activity out of “m”
activities and “γ” represents the matrix of activities. In order 
to recognize an activity, the current (live) observations are
compared to the “γ” and the activities are ranked from small 
to big deviations to the sensors’ temporal behaviors in order
to explain the current observations.
C.
Integrating temporal behaviors of the sensors in
activities realizations
Behavior of all sensors in realization of the activities can
be integrated and modeled through a curve or line that
traverses the fuzzy states of the activities (which are
multidimensional data points).
Definition 4.2 (Activities Linear Temporal Behavior). It
is the collection of data points representing the behavior of
the sensors per each activity in smart home. This matrix is
represented by “γ” and for the recognition objectives, the 
most similar behavior would be inferred as the most
possible ongoing activity. This concept is formalized as set
where “aj” refers to the j’th activity of the set “A”.

In order to apply the “γ” matrix for activity recognition, 
we would calculate the distance of the current (live)
observations. Out of the “m” activities, the one which tells
the most similarity in activity trend will be selected as the
most possible ongoing activity. The activities may be sorted
according to this criterion. In order to calculate the
similarity distance between a typical data point (“vi,t”) and a
sensor trend line, we would apply the following equation:

In this formula, “da,i,t” is the Euclidian distance of the
point (“vi,t”) to the activity trend line and it represents the
similarity measure of the mentioned point to the sensor’s
behavior in realization of the activity “a”. Generally, each
sensor can generate numerical values in range from its max
to min. Therefore, max (“di”) and min (“di”) are the values
that may be calculated manually or by the expert’s idea.
Therefore, we can normalize the similarities using this
equation:

In order to take similarity between the observation and
the total activity trend, we may apply several methods in
order to calculate the similarity degree. In here, because our
objective is to demonstrate only a general schema from this
process, we would suffice to the average similarity method
given by the following equation:

Here, the “ya” refers to the possibility that “vi,t” belongs
to realization of the goal “a”. In order to recognize the
activities at a glance and to calculate the linear activity
multivariable
function,
we
can
perform
a
multiple
regression on the output and input of the activity’s formula
given by the following equation:

(9)
The symbol “ya” represents the activity function and it is
resulted as the result of some linear operations on the
observations.
In this section, we discussed that an activity may be
recognized using linear statistical analysis methods. A big
problem of the application of this method is that it does not
help with the recognition of correct realization of an
activity. If two or more activities are different in just a few
actions (one or a few more sensors), they will not be
recognizable because the calculation of their portion in
similarity degree would not be noticeable,. Moreover, if an
activity is realized fast or slowly, then it will cause
noticeable differences inߨ(ݒ݅ݐ∈ܽ). Experimentally, two
different activities may cause very similar trends, so we
cannot rely well on the results. The weight of every data
point is equal; hence a noise may cause an undesirable high
similarity
degree.
Finally,
it
can
be
mentioned
that
generally, calculation of the similarity degree would depend
on three factors: quantity of the training data records or the
time of activity realization, domain of the sensors’ generated
numerical values, and quantity of the observing sensors. In
order to improve this method, we would perform the
smoothing process on the fuzzy cluster centers of the
activities. We calculate fuzzy states of the sensors and
perform the smoothing on the cluster centers (see Figure 5).
Some advantages of this process are that we would be able
to eliminate the transition states and also eliminate the data
points
that
point
continuously
to
a
repetitive
point.

Moreover, the amount of the smoothing data points would
be significantly decreased.
Figure 5.
Smoothing fuzzy sensor states
In Figure 5, it is illustrated that the process of smoothing
can be performed on the points that are the most similar to
their neighbors. This way we can redirect the similarity
degrees to the best representing data points rather than to
probable noise or transition states; therefore, we can
distinguish better the activities. In the next section we will
discuss this issue.
V.
SIMULTANEOUS ACTIVITIES
In order to realize an activity, several actions get
accomplished simultaneously, which are directed by smart
home resident. For each action, two more sensors may
observe the consequences of the action; therefore, even a
simple action can be interpreted as a set of simultaneous
operations. For example, when an object is moved two
sensors may observe this movement and two operations (in
direction to each sensor) can result.
Using the set theory, we can combine or analyze the
constituting elements of the concepts and as the result we
can recognize high or low level concepts rather than
individual activities. The application of this contribution is
data-driven recognition of simultaneous activities and also
lower-level concepts such as actions; therefore, we can
reason for the activities interferences.
The recognition of simultaneous activities requires to
analyze
the
fuzzy-world
states
in
order
to
discover
realization of which activities may possibly cause the world
state. By using traditional set theory, we would apply the
union (U) operation to find the constituting elements. When
two singular activities (“ak” and “au”) are realized together
then we would haveܨܣݏ=ܨܣܽݑ∪ܨܣܽ݇
in which “FAs”
refers to the simultaneous activity. In here, we would treat
the fuzzy entities (fuzzy clusters) with the traditional set
theory. The result is analyze/combine of the learnt concepts.
In order to analyze the “FAs” based on the known activities
we
apply
the
set
theory
algebra,
which
indicates
ܨܣݏ=ܨܣܽݑ+ܨܣܽ݇−(ܨܣܽݑ∙ܨܣܽ݇).
Therefore, “ak” refers to the known activity and “au”
refers to the unknown activity. A key point in here is that
the fuzzy context of both activities should be respected in
order for both activity models to be validated. Therefore, the
resultant world state should be subjected toܥ̃ܽݏ=ܥ̃ܽݑ∩ܥ̃ܽ݇..
Definition 5.1 (simultaneous activities). Simultaneous
activities are the sequence of fuzzy events that follow
achievement of two or more goals. Each fuzzy state
concerning the realization of a social activity should be
valid for both of the activity patterns.
In other words,
combination of individual activities is called simultaneous
activities. The concept of “simultaneous activity” refers to
the perception of the activities and the learned models from
them. Regardless of the quantity of activity performers,
when combination of two or more concepts is inferred, then
a simultaneous activity is recognized. The simultaneous
activity can be represented asܨܣݏ=ܨܣܽݑ∪ܨܣܽ݇ subject to
ܥ̃ܽݏ=ܥ̃ܽݑ∩ܥ̃ܽ݇.
Constraints
of
each
of
the
running
simultaneous activities should be realized in a space that
satisfies all of the known goals. This space is made using
fuzzy logic in a way that each activity saves its general
structure and has partial flexibility if it faces the deviations
from its previously learned structure.
VI.
CASE STUDY
In
order
to
validate
the
proposed
approach,
we
implemented a series of activities in both singular and
simultaneous manners in the LIARA laboratory [11]. More
than 500 activity features were observed during realization
of these activities. Singular realization of the coffee making
and hand washing activity was modeled. The simultaneous
realization of them was also modeled and we calculated the
simultaneous realization of these singular realizations. We
verified the similarity of these activities to their models and
finally, in Figure 6 we have represented the inferred
similarity in the range of [0-10].
Figure 6.
Similarity degrees in recognition of activities
In
our
experiments,
we
saw
that
the
calculated
simultaneous activity could approximately replace the real
simultaneous model. Other experiments proposed in [10]
confirmed reliable results, too. The important point here is
that we could achieve this result through application of the
activities multivariable function that could explain the
activities’ dynamicity at a glance.

VII.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we discussed how to model the activities as
multivariable problems and proposed to apply fuzzy logic,
especially the fuzzy time concept in order to model the
dynamicity of an activity in a mathematical function. This
function draws a fuzzy space for realization of the activities.
One benefit of this method is the modeling the simultaneous
activities. On one hand, the uncertainty in human behavior
is considered, and on the other hand, the imprecision of the
sensors is handled. However, the current solution needs
improvements. For example, the proposed approach learns
the activity models at first. Then, it uses the learnt
knowledge at the runtime. We did not propose an online
learning technique because we cannot distinguish between
anomaly and a new manner of correct activity realization. A
possible solution for this limitation is to make a border and
definition for tolerable anomalies, then any unfamiliar
patterns, which do not cross that border could be taken into
account as a new correct activity. This task would need new
definition on normality.
