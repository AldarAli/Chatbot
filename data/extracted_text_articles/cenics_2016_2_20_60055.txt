Abstract— UV (ultraviolet) curable nanoparticle conductive 
inks for 3D printing present a novel solution for production of 
a wide variety of parts with integrated conductive circuits. 
Such inks are difficult to design due to the complex tradeoff 
between achieving high conductivity, obtainable by a high 
metal content ink, and requiring low ink viscosity in order to 
meet jetting requirements. Adding to that is the complexity of 
managing the competing curing and sintering processes of the 
printed polymer and metal constituents. In the current work, 
UV curable nanoparticle conductive inks have been formulated 
and tested by different curing and sintering techniques. It has 
been demonstrated that a low resistivity of less than 10 times 
the silver bulk resistivity is attainable by thermal sintering, 
even with non-conductive organic content of 60%. Photonic 
sintering demonstrated the ability to obtain a resistivity of 
below 60 times the silver bulk resistivity, which is higher than 
the resistivity obtained by thermal sintering, but achievable in 
shorter processing times within milliseconds.

 INTRODUCTION 
PV Nano Cell Ltd. provides a wide range of solvent 
based nano conductive Sicrys™ inks [1], available for 
printed electronics applications with 50 wt% (weight 
percent) solid concentration and six times bulk resistivity at 
150 °C, 30 minutes thermal treatment. In order to expand its 
capabilities, PV Nano Cell is taking part in the EC (European 
commission) funded DIMAP project (Novel nanoparticle 
enhanced Digital Materials for 3D Printing and their 
application shown for the robotic and electronic industry), 
dealing with new materials for 3D printing [2]. PV Nano 
Cell will develop a novel UV curable nanoparticle 
conductive ink for 3D printing by PolyJet technology. The 
ink is based on PV Nano Cell’s Sicrys™ silver nanoparticles, 
dispersed in a monomeric matrix from Stratasys Ltd. or 
GEO® specialty chemicals, formulated for reaching high 
conductivity of the cured/sintered tracks.  
 
UV-curable inks have attracted increasing attention due 
to environmental considerations, fast curing speed, low 
energy consumption, fast overall manufacturing process, and 
the possibility to work with thermal sensitive substrates [3]. 
Moreover, UV irradiation has been demonstrated to be a 
viable alternative to thermal sintering. Polzinger et al. have 
shown resistivity values of about four times bulk silver after 
80 seconds UV-sintering of commercially available Ag ink 
[4]. Hu Yating et al. have demonstrated the sintering of 
copper ink by UV irradiation for a few seconds, achieving a 
resistivity of 4×10-5 Ω∙cm for antenna applications [5]. The 
ability of UV-irradiation to sinter Ag nanoparticles has 
opened up new paths to incorporate conductive features into 
the polymeric media. This makes UV-curable conductive 
inks attractive as they will benefit from both, fast curing and 
fast sintering. 
In the market, however, mainly pastes with high viscosity 
and only a limited number of UV conductive inks are 
available. Among these, Polychem UV/EB International 
Corp. [6] and Tanaka Kikinzoku International (Europe) 
GmbH [7] pastes can be found, as well as a UV Ag 
flexographic ink from Gwent Group Ltd. [8]. The published 
resistivity values of these pastes and inks are 70-100 μΩ∙cm.  
 
The preparation of UV-curable conductive inks has been 
demonstrated in the literature. Sangermano et al. prepared 
UV-curable 
acrylic 
inks 
for 
printing 
resistors 
by 
incorporating Ag nanoparticles into a monomer; and reported 
a resistivity of 5x103 Ω∙cm-1, which is an improvement of 
two orders of magnitude as compared to the pure polymeric 
matrix [3]. They also prepared UV-curable ink using Ag 
precursors; starting from silver hexafluoroantimonate and in-
situ production of the Ag nanoparticles during the UV-
irradiation [9], [10]. A hybrid Ag based ink prepared for an 
antenna printing application by Chiolerio et al. has shown 
5% conductivity of bulk silver after thermal sintering at 
250 °C for 30 minutes [11]. Zhai et al. shown conductivity of 
7.14 × 10−5 Ω∙cm for UV-curable ink after UV-curing and 
thermal sintering; they achieved the conductivity for the ink-
jet printed ink after evaporation of water on a heating stage, 
curing under UV spot light source and sintering in a muffle 
furnace. Thus, they showed that even after curing, thermal 
treatment might lead to sintering of nanoparticles within the 
polymeric media [12]. Designing UV-curable conductive 
inks is challenging due to the complex tradeoff between 
good conductivity, achievable with high metal content, while 
maintaining both a low viscosity ink that meets jetting 
requirements and realizing fast curing rates. All the while, 
the ink constituents of metal nanoparticles and polymeric 
media must remain stable in the formulation.

The main challenges facing this project include the 
ability to obtain a high solid content ink in a monomer 
matrix with suitable viscosity for jetting, and reaching 
percolation of particles in the sintered and cured printed 
pattern that will allow low resistivity. In order to overcome 
these hurdles, the formulation is carefully adjusted with 
appropriate additives and solvents for jetability, the solid 
content is raised so that percolation can be reached in the 
dried and cured samples, and alternative curing/sintering 
technologies to standard oven thermal treatments are being 
researched for short processing times.  
The aim of this work was to investigate the curing and 
sintering behavior of the monomeric silver inks and 
understand the effect of the different monomers on the 
resistivity in order to choose the most promising monomers 
for further formulation optimizations. In order to do so, 
several curing/sintering approaches were tested, including: 
thermal treatment in an oven, UV irradiation, photonic 
sintering and curing monitoring by FTIR (Fourier-
transformed infrared) spectroscopy.  
Photonic sintering is a technique that uses pulsed light of 
a Xenon flash lamp to sinter thin films of particles.[13]–[19] 
It is a fast sintering method with common processing time in 
the range of milliseconds that operates at room temperature. 
The delivered light energy is selectively absorbed by the 
target particles and transferred to heat that triggers 
coalescence. Due to the pulsed shape of the flash, the heat 
transfer and therefore the damage to the substrate is low.

Thus, heat sensitive materials like polymers, paper or textiles 
can be used as substrate materials for printed electronics. The 
structure of this paper is as followed: in section II the 
performed experiments are described, followed by the 
discussion of the results in section III. In conclusion, section 
IV summarizes the presented work and gives a brief outlook 
on future work. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Several different UV curable monomers were received 
from GEO (GM1-5) and Stratasys (SM1-3) and used as 
received, Ag nano particles were synthesized and prepared 
by PV Nano Cell.  
A. Sample preparation: 
1) Formulation preparation: 
Sicrys™ Ag particles were incorporated into monomers 
at a 50 wt% Ag concentration. A volatile co-solvent was 
used in order to lower the viscosity of the formulation and 
evaporate quickly out of the printed tracks, resulting in a 
high solid Ag content of ~85 wt% Ag in the dried printed 
pattern (40 vol%). Formulations D006 through D015 (see 
also Table II), consisting of Ag, dispersant, photoinitiator 
(PI), monomer, and solvent constituents, were prepared 
according to the formulation composition indicated in Table 
I. For curing rate characterization of the monomers, samples 
were prepared keeping the same component ratio but 
excluding Ag and dispersant.  
2) Curing:  
Formulations D006-D015 were printed with a dispenser 
and dried on a hot plate at 50 ºC. The samples were then 
cured/sintered by each of the following methods: 
• 
UV LED 
• 
UV-LED + Oven 
• 
Oven 
• 
Photonic sintering 
UV curing was performed with a 395 nm LED (light 
emitting diode) lamp and 2 min exposure time, and thermal 
treatment was performed in a box oven at 200 ºC for 1hr.  
3) Sintering:  
Ink samples on glass were freshly prepared by draw 
down bar printing (40 µm) on glass substrates followed by 
sintering. Photonic sintering was performed using a Heraeus 
flash system [20], with an emission spectrum between 200 to 
1000 nm. The lamp setting was fixed for all the different ink 
formulations. 
B. Sample Characterization:  
The ink formulations were characterized for viscosity 
with a viscometer (Brookfield), and for particle size 
distribution and sedimentation rates using a centrifugal 
measurement technique (Lumisizer). In addition, curing rate 
was monitored by FTIR-spectroscopy (Brucker Tensor 37). 
Electrical performance was obtained by a four-point probe 
measurement set-up for resistance, and cross-section 
measurements were obtained using a surface profiler (Dektak 
IIA).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Ink viscosities:  
Table II lists the formulations (D006 – D015) and their 
measured viscosity. The formulations slightly differ from 
each other due different GEO monomer (GM) and Stratasys 
monomer (SM) types  
B. Oven and UV curing/sintering 
As seen in Table III, the resistivity values resulting from 
the UV LED curing step alone are very high and the 
variation range of results is quite broad. After UV curing, the 
measured resistance from four-point probe was in the range 
of MΩ, though some measurement points showed lower 
resistances. The oven treatment, however, (with and without 
the UV curing step), significantly reduced the resistivity, 
along with a reduced variation in results.  
 
Figure 1 shows the resistivity of the printed patterns as a 
function of line thickness for formulations prepared from 
different monomers, where UV cured and thermal oven 
treated samples are shown as filled data points, and thermally 
treated samples without UV curing are shown as un-filled 
data points.  
As seen in the graphs, as the thickness of the samples 
increased, the resistivity increased as well. Thereby, the 
variation range of resistivity results indicated in Table III 
may have been due to line thickness variations of the printed 
samples.  
C. Photonic Sintering 
In addition to thermal and UV treatment, freshly prepared 
samples were photonically sintered. Hypothetically, matrix 
curing and particle sintering can take place in a single step 
and in a short period of time. In that way, samples D009, 
D012, D013 and D014 became conductive (low conductivity  
was determined) within a single flash experiment, although 
D014 showing the highest resistivity of the flashed samples 
using the stated setting. Samples D010, D011 and D015 on 
the other hand became conductive after a second flash. For 
Sample D006 no conductivity could be established.  
D. Monitoring Curing via FTIR:  
To investigate polymerization progress of the matrix, 
samples were prepared as described in the previous chapter. 
These samples were treated with UV light using a self-made 
UV-LED array in one minute steps. After each single step 
the irradiation was stopped for recording an IR-spectrum and 
irradiation was continued afterwards. For example, Figure 2 
shows the decrease of the transmission-band at 1640 cm-1 
corresponding to an α,β–unsaturated ketone (functional part 
of the acrylic monomer) over time for SM3. As can be seen, 
after two minutes of irradiation, there is no significant 
change indicating curing of most of the monomer content.  
IV. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
It has been demonstrated that UV-curable low viscosity inks 
are feasible. Even with 60% by volume of non-conductive 
organic material, a resistivity of 10 µΩ∙cm (6.3 times bulk 
silver resitivity) was achieved. In this work the curing step 
(UV radiation) did not sinter the Ag nano particles. This may 
stem from there being two competitive processes: the curing 
(cross-linking of the monomer) and the sintering of the 
nanoparticles; the curing being much faster than the sintering 
process therefore resistivities are high. As seen from thermal 
and UV LED sintering/curing treatments, there appears to be 
a dependence of the line thickness on the resulting resistivity, 
where thin lines achieve lower resistivity values. In addition, 
the UV LED conditions of 395 nm did not provide resistivity 
reduction of the printed tracks, and the oven treatment was a 
necessary step for achieving conductivity.

Figure 2. Curing progress based on FTIR spectroscopy. The data points 
correspond to the transmission recorded at 1640 cm-1. 
Another conclusion from the work is that the resistivity 
of the formulations differed from monomer to monomer. 
This might demonstrate the role of the monomer type on the 
percolation threshold or on the nano particle arrangement in 
the printed pattern. In addition, photonic sintering appeared 
to be a suitable method to cure and sinter the inks in one 
single step. Resistivity below 300 µΩ∙cm was obtained after 
one and two flash experiments. Compared to the results for 
UV curing and thermal treatment, the measured resistances 
obtained from photonic sintering were higher. However, 
conductivity from flash sintering was achieved in a shorter 
period of time (within seconds).  
Since the monomer matrix system was different in each 
of the ink formulations, the curing rates are expected to be 
different. The ideal setting for each ink has to be determined 
individually. The results shown here serve as a proof of 
concept for potentially using a photonic sintering strategy for 
monomeric inks. However, the flash parameters were not 
fully optimized in this preliminary experiment. Therefore, 
further work is necessary to find the optimal conditions for 
curing and sintering for each individual ink.
