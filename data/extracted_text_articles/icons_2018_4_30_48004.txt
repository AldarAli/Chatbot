Abstract— A mathematical model to describe the dynamics of
heat extraction in a domestic refrigerator is exposed in this
document. The concerned model is based on the Newton's Law
for Cooling as a boundary condition (walls that isolate the
volume of the box and keep the low energy level) for the
Fourier Heat Equation, which is used to describe the energetic
exchange among the mass nodes considered from the finite
volumes concept. The model was codified through Matlab and
used for simulation and validation with experimental results.
The simulation results add information to validate that the
temperature is not homogenous inside the appliance. The
information provided helps to understand the evolution of
temperature changes, assuming a homogeneous environment
and different ratios of thermal capacity.
Keywords- heat exchange; thermal diffusivity; finite volume.

INTRODUCTION
The
implementation
of
new
technologies
for
the
refrigeration industry has increased significantly in recent
years. The purpose of these new implementations was to
address different issues, such as energy expenditure and the
impact on the environment [1]. Cooling devices are mainly
used for conservation of perishable foods, making them
indispensable for the conservation of large volumes of food,
for a commercial level, and in small quantities, for domestic
consumption [2]. This article focuses on the exchange of
energy inside a domestic refrigerator and the relation
between energy consumption and thermal load contained in
the
refrigerator
chamber
[3],
leading
to
better
food
conservation and reducing the negative environmental
impact. The relevant understanding of the dynamics of
energy can be achieved by formulating a mathematical
model, using the law of cooling of Newton and the equation
of heat of Fourier, and by solving both using the method of
finite volumes.
The present work is structured as follows: Section II
mentions the basic concepts to detail the proposed theories
and
the
expected
effects.
Section
III
presents
the
mathematical model developed and the results obtained
from the simulation. In addition, it provides an early
interpretation of the process of energy exchange between
mass along the internal volumes. Section IV explains the
results generated by the simulations and their possible effect
in the refrigeration cycle. Finally, Section V discusses the
final
conclusions
of this
first
stage
of the
research
developed.
II.
BASIC CONCEPTS
To
determine
the
mathematical
model,
certain
conditions are assumed for the rest of this text, namely that
the environment temperature is homogeneous, and the
thermodynamic
parameters
of
materials
are
constant.
Previous considerations are proposed to generate a linear
model. Newton's Law of Cooling models the transfer of heat
between
the
environment
and
the
internal
volume,
considering a thin layer of insulation [7]. Fourier's heat
equation was used for the transfer of energy in the internal
volume, ignoring the gas flow inside the cold chamber. The
elements used as thermal loads were air and water. The
Fourier heat equation, mainly used for conduction of heat
energy between solid materials, can also be solved for gases,
considering that the fluid will not have any movement, and
only focusing our interest on the mass confined the volume
protected by the insulator [10]. Newton's cooling law is used
as the boundary condition that simulates the insulation from
the environment, adding perturbation to the refrigeration
cycle [8]. The outside temperature is considered uniform at
the surface of each wall.

Two states of thermal load, empty and full, are
considered: 0% of thermal energy stored (empty), to
determinate the temperature evolution and the energy
decrease along time [9]. 100% of accumulated thermal
energy (full), to show the difference between the absence of
load in the refrigeration cycle [11].
A.
Characteristics of the model
The transfer medium in the inside of the chamber, in 0%
of thermal load and a time of 0 sec, is considered a
homogeneous mixture (air), with a thermal conductivity of
0.024 w / m ºK. The movement of air is not considered. The
internal energy is extracted, and it is expelled to the outside.
The evaporator is maintained on to reduce the energy of the
air in a first empty state.
The system dynamic is altered when the thermal load
changes its state from empty to full. By modifying the
thermodynamic properties, the extraction of heat of the
thermal
equilibria
changes.
It
is
considered
that
the
properties of water in its liquid state can provide an
approximation of the behavior of food in refrigeration.
For purposes of a first approximation, only two possible
states of the thermal load are considered, considering that the
space to extract the energy could be empty or totally full. As
a future work, an adjustment may be made to consider
different middle operation points.
The different material characteristics used in the model
are presented in TABLE I:

Theoretical Proposal
For this investigation, the model was focused on the
internal
volume
of
refrigeration
(evaporator
output),
considering that its motion has a static behavior and is
described by the following dynamics, as observed in
equation (1).

According to the elapsed time, and the amount of energy
that the heat source can emit, the characteristics vary, which
are the thermal conductivity, the temperature gradient and
the volume. In order to obtain a linear approximation,
constant properties are considered throughout the duration of
the simulation.
C.
Volume Analysis
Considering that the objective is to describe the thermal
distribution in space of the chamber, three space dimensions
are considered, obtaining the mathematical model indicated
in equation (2).
The volume of each
material is considered. The
assumption that there are no spaces of different materials is
applied. All possible volumes in the total space are in
prismatic form, causing the transfer of heat between the
formed nodes similar to a solid. The only path of heat
transference is in the direction of the three space dimension.

Solving the dynamic model helped to generate the
distribution of temperature as a function of time and space.
The heat source is the evaporator, but the sign of its
effect in the system is negative, because of the idea of
extracting energy from the interior, instead of inserting
energy from the exterior. The interaction of energy between
the evaporator and the outside is not explained in this
document.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND SIMULATION RESULTS
The process of data acquisition requires a commercial
refrigerator with linear compressor, with the following
characteristics: 132 watts 60 Hz and 313 watts 150 Hz,
representing 0% and 100% thermal load, respectively.

In
addition,
the
width
of
the
insulating
wall
(polyurethane) has a value of 0.05 m. The energy entering
the cold chamber was 1.64 W, this energy being added to the
heat generated (extraction of energy from the evaporator).
The minimum value of the evaporator in an empty state, and
it is selected assuming that no thermal load with greater
conductivity than water leads to minimum work from the
evaporator. The interaction of energy between temperature
nodes causes an increase or decrease in energy of every
surrounding node.
A.
Operation of the model
The temperature behavior should be radial with the
center in the evaporator output. Every node will have a limit
of energy extraction coinciding with the phase change
energy of every material.
The simulation was generated proposing the space of the
refrigerator as empty, without shelves any object or product
inside.
As explained in Section II, only rectangular heat
fluctuation is considered. It is for this reason that no other
geometric flow is considered.

Figure 2.
Behavior of the temperature distribution in the domestic
refrigerator vacuum
The empiricial behavior is coherent with the theoretical
radial propagation, hence, the evaporator location to show
the lowest values in temperature as seen in Figure 2.
Figure 3 shows the same behavior as Figure 2, but with a
transversal view on the z axis, divided into 9 different
instants. The subfigures 1, 2 3 are the first layers and show a
considerable decrease in the internal energy, in layers 4, 5, 6
they show a higher energy, but a decrease in the lower part
of the chamber, because the density of the air increases
when temperature decreases.
The solution of finite volumes determines the zones of the
refrigeration cycle depending on the thermal load and the
percentage of use of the compressor, empty or full as
mentioned previously, generating two zones. In Figure 4,
the red zone indicates that after working at 100 percent and
with a total time of 12 hours (simulated), the system does
not reach steady state. However, with thermal load in 0%,
the system stabilizises.

IV. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
Based on the concept of finite volume, the Fourier’s
equation (proposed model) solved in finite differences
considering the sub-node strategy, maintains a dynamic
behavior similar to a first order system for all its nodes. The
dynamic obtained with the experimental characterization
represents a behavior consistent with the empirical results.
Since the model proposed in finite differences, in each
iteration, is fed by temperature data at the output of the
evaporator inside the cold chamber (sensor available in the
refrigerator), the stabilization time of the model is consistent
with the experimental results. However, the theoretical
values of the constants require adjustments; to reduce the
deviations in a permanent regime. Based on the results
obtained from the tests, 4 critical zones were chosen to

analyze the dynamic response due to the thermal load, as
well as the dynamic response due to the speed of the
compressor. In each zone, the corresponding dynamic poles
are calculated from each time constant. Considering the
poles obtained for the 4 regions of the load-velocity space,
the errors with respect to the theoretical values must be
considerably reduced.
V. CONCLUSIONS
Based on the results, a strong dependence has been
observed
between
the
coefficients
of
the
model
(thermodynamic properties) and the control variables that
are regulated in the refrigerator device. The speed of the
compressor and the distribution and magnitude of the
thermal load inside the refrigerator are variables that
contribute to modify the temperature evolution of the
system.
The non-linearity of the phenomenon must be
considered when modifying the value of the poles in the
model and is supported by the improvement of the results.
