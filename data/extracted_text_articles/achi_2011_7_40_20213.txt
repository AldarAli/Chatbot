Abstract—Interaction aesthetics is a substantial part of the 
design process of products and devices, especially those related 
to enhance the accessibility of heritage. This paper offers a 
perspective on the breadth of the concept interactivity through 
an extensive literature review and analysis of some of the areas 
closely linked to the concept: the wayfinding experiences, the 
visual and tactile perception of devices and the computers’ 
user interfaces. All these will help to evaluate the efficiency of 
existing products, in order to outline some directions that allow 
designers to develop new devices that make information and 
cultural content accessible to all users. We analyzed the most 
common devices used in cultural heritage sites, based on 
various parameters relating to the level of interactivity. The 
main results show that most devices are dynamic and designed 
to facilitate mobility, but they are not interactive. Therefore, 
designers must continue their work in this direction.

design; built environment 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The concept of interactivity has become worn and 
trivialised in recent years, due especially to the enormous 
quantitative leap in the field of domestic technology. Any 
electronic device with an interface appears to take on the 
characteristic of being interactive, and the term is often 
simply a feature added to product advertising as a 
commercial strategy. Many of these devices are presented as 
being accessible and interactive, but in most cases the 
relationship users manage to establish with them hardly 
helps to access content or understand the device, so that 
sometimes the activity of the device is limited to offering a 
simple reactive response to a stimulus. This lack of definition 
of the term creates difficulties when it comes to assessing, 
comparing or questioning interactivity as a quality in object 
design. It also comes into serious conflict with interaction 
aesthetics because the opportunities for developing the 
aesthetic component will depend on factors intervening in 
the interactive process (object-user-context). 
In view of the above, there is a need therefore to establish 
the limits of the term interactivity and study its real scope for 
the user in the process of relating to objects and the contents 
they offer. This work aims to reflect the concepts which 
intervene and merge in the subject of interaction 
differentiating three main levels to which the term refers, for 
better understanding of its particular interest for proposing or 
considering interaction aesthetics as an integral part of the 
design process.  
Another stage of research and analysis would attempt to 
focus on the design of accessibility products, which provide 
an appropriate level of interactivity required to ensure that 
specific groups of users can use and understand given 
contents. 
Nowadays, 
accessibility 
involves 
planning 
interactive resources. Designing access to a functional, 
cultural or information resource involves considering the real 
figure of the user. Users can only participate in content and 
enrich their knowledge by establishing interaction with 
devices and experiencing correct feedback. It is worth asking 
to what extent current devices effectively ensure that access 
and which devices are more suitable in certain situations.  
By identifying and clarifying interaction types, it will be 
possible to organise typologies of accessibility products in 
general and consider in particular products intended to bring 
heritage sites closer to the visitor.  
The structure of this paper starts with the definition of 
interactivity and the study of the relationship with the 
concept of wayfinding. Then we analyze the influence of 
aesthetics in the interactive experience and the connection 
between accessibility, interface and interaction design. 
Finally, the paper ends with a classification and analysis of 
the most common devices related to accessibility to heritage. 
The strong and weak points in each design can be observed 
and identified to establish directions for future projects. 
II. 
DEFINITION AND LEVELS FOR INTERACTIVITY 
The simplified idea of interactivity as a stimulus-
response cycle is very widespread but is somewhat limited as 
it identifies reaction with interaction without considering the 
extent to which feedback is involved. Any interaction refers 
to an information exchange and this happens when a user 
input has to produce a device output which in turn will 
condition the following input. Researchers who have referred 
to this basic interaction model include Maldonado and 
Bonsiepe, who proposed the idea of the feedback loop 
164

between machine and user [1]. Norman‟s more recent 
interaction models are based on that same idea [2]. 
Interactivity 
is 
a 
complex 
concept 
related 
to 
communicational exchanges which can involve human, 
objectual or electronic agents at the same time. Shedroff 
refers to the need for at least two independent participants in 
any interactive process, so that the response generated by one 
action provides relevant information and motivates a 
subsequent action [3]. Rafaeli has defined interactivity as „an 
expression of the extent that in a given series of 
communication exchanges, any third (or later) transmission 
(or message) is related to the degree to which previous 
exchanges referred to even earlier transmissions‟ [4].  
In view of the above, interaction can be defined as a 
process of continuous action and reaction between two or 
more agents who participate alternately, helping to create 
experiences through the information exchange. 
Taking into account these theories which relate feedback 
to the interactive process, very different situations can be 
found. In particular is the fact that firstly many objects are 
used in a basic, unilateral way, without exploiting their 
particular features. Secondly, other products and devices 
intended to make content accessible do not offer the 
possibility of establishing a valid dialogue between user and 
system. 
In a first step towards establishing a classification of 
interaction levels, there is an interesting proposal [5] that 
distinguish between two types of systems: static systems, 
which cannot act on their own or influence the environment 
and dynamic systems which act and influence the 
environment, either from mere reaction to a stimulus or from 
a more complex interaction. Thus, objects which admit 
manipulation and react to it are dynamic, although not all 
such objects can be considered interactive, because 
guaranteeing user response is not enough. 
Another main characteristic of interactivity is the 
opportunity for the user to act on all the agents involved in 
the process. As Liu and Shrum [6] pointed out interactivity 
can be defined as „the degree which two or more 
communication parties can act on each other, on the 
communication medium and on the messages and the degree 
to which such influences are synchronized‟ (p. 54). 
Similarly, 
Bettetini‟s 
definition 
highlights 
the 
multidirectionality of interactions, the user‟s active role in 
choosing the required information and the particular pace of 
communication [7]. Three typologies of interactivity can be 
established according to these agents: 
 
According to the level of control over structure and 
content [8]: reactive, where the user has little control 
over structure and content; coactive: provides control 
over sequence, pace and style; proactive: control 
over structure and content. 
 
According to the relationship between messages [4]: 
not interactive: a message does not relate to a 
previous message, reactive: a message relates only to 
the previous message, interactive: a message relates 
to the previous message and preceding messages. 
 
According to the participant agents [9]: user-
machine interaction: the computer must respond to 
user actions, user-user interaction: communication 
between persons, user-message interaction: skill of 
the user to modify messages. 
Thus, any discussion of interactivity involves considering 
these three areas and qualifying the degree to which the user 
manages to influence and modify each aspect related to the 
process. 
Interactivity, as a communication-related phenomenon, is 
linked to the acquisition of knowledge and the development 
of cognitive skills [10], and so it is important to ensure 
correct design of interactive resources. From the point of 
view of the product, interaction is the physical relationship a 
user establishes with a given device or object and therefore 
interactive design must consider various disciplines such as 
usability and ergonomics.  
Usability brings us back again to a broad conceptual 
framework. Its definition [11] shows that interactivity and 
usability share the same consideration towards the figure of 
the user, whose special features should be studied to gain a 
better understanding of the interactive process. 
III. 
INTERACTIVITY AND WAYFINDING 
Wayfinding originally meant orientation in an urban 
environment by interpreting signs [12] and has been 
expanded to include all inner orientation strategies in an 
architectural space [13], with reference to maps and 
directories. Assimilating this information is key for making 
decisions about where and how to move around and putting 
the decision into practice. Arthur and Passini define these 
two stages in the process highlighting the formulation of 
cognitive strategies inherent in complex decision-making 
[14]. Thus it can be said the appropriate design of a 
wayfinding system can facilitate cognitive accessibility to an 
environment. 
Wayfinding resources can be architectural, graphic, 
auditory or tactile and therefore the range of competencies 
covers all disciplines working with these resources. These 
subjects have been studied by architecture with more focus 
on the legibility aspects of the built environment, aspects of 
image and structure [12][15], geography developing 
symbolic content [16], environmental psychology which has 
investigated perception of the environment [17], cognitive 
representation and orientation of behaviour processes 
[18][19] and many others. Each of these different approaches 
is nourished by references and research from complementary 
approaches.  
Ensuring accessibility to informative content requires 
devices (static or dynamic) able to notify users of specific 
information efficiently. In interactive devices, the interface 
must show the user what actions are available at all times in 
order to establish a dialogue with the content or activate a 
helpful response for subsequent decision-making. This 
process is also key for developing teaching resources, as user 
learning depends on establishing correct feedback through 
the interaction. 
Therefore an interactive environment requires a sensory 
map (visual, auditory and/or tactile) which shows users the 
content and/or actions to be taken and guides them through 
the process. The wayfinding concept applied to orientation in 
165

a physical space may seem insufficient to establish parallels 
with interactivity applied to electronic devices as this 
happens more dynamically in a conceptual space where users 
do not have to move around a physical space, but around 
information. 
Nevertheless, 
to 
navigate 
and 
access 
information the user adopts similar behaviours to those based 
on feelings of confidence, efficiency, effectiveness, 
exploration or enjoyment, depending on user intention and 
the characteristics or conditions at each moment [20].  
So, the concept of interactivity is linked to wayfinding in 
that users must be able to access and explore different 
alternatives or information from an interface on the path to 
making decisions towards an action and must obtain a 
response from the device which orients them. 
IV. 
AESTHETICS AND INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE 
Aesthetic components are immanent specific values 
characteristic of design activity, capable of increasing the 
potential for interaction with objects. The conception of a 
product must integrate aesthetics in a way which is intrinsic 
to its functional resolution and that involves bearing in mind 
the elements which secure particular emotions. Danielle 
Quarante clarifies the factors which determine these 
elements and appeal to different orders: purely emotional 
factors, related to subjectivity; cognitive factors concerning 
our knowledge and culture; intellectual factors, which lead to 
the logical satisfaction of understanding a product; and 
psycho-physiological factors which lead to aesthetic pleasure 
in relation to the quality of our perceptions [21]. Aesthetic 
features are certainly not quantitative but related to taste, 
pleasure, sensation and many other individual, social, 
cultural and historical parameters which merge in the special 
poetics of the object.  
The degree of satisfaction users obtain from interacting 
with a product is structured on different levels: all 
experiences a user has with a product influences to some 
extent the degree of realisation and development of the ego, 
touching its different facets [22]. These experiences can be 
related to the different types of pleasure products can 
provide: physical, psychological, social and intellectual 
[23][24], differentiating a lower or physical level and a 
higher or mental level [25]. 
At this point it is worth offering some considerations on 
visual and tactile perception. In recent decades we have 
extended the field of action and our perception has evolved 
in these areas as a consequence of the technological 
revolution and materials engineering which enhance the 
qualities of objects and environments favouring orientation, 
use and legibility of the built medium, enabling more 
spontaneous use. Although emphasising visual factors, in the 
1960s Lynch was already pointing out the significance of 
these factors with reference to the built environment [12]: 
„Structuring and identifying the environment is a vital ability 
[…] Many kinds of cues are used: the visual sensations of 
color, shape, motion, or polarization of light, as well as other 
senses such as smell, sound, touch, kinesthesia, sense of 
gravity, and perhaps of electric or magnetic fields‟ (p. 3). 
Pallasmaa‟s contribution is important as it argues for the 
primacy of the sense of touch as the first contact with the 
medium on which all the other senses are based [26]. He also 
refers to the role of peripheral and unfocused vision in our 
experience of the world and how it integrates us in the space: 
„The very essence of experience is moulded by hapticity and 
by unfocused peripheral vision [...] In addition to criticising 
the hegemony of sight, the very essence of vision must be 
reconsidered‟ (p. 10).  
When we attempt to reflect these issues concerning the 
different levels of perception individuals obtain from their 
relationship with the physical medium, then the variety and 
diversity of stimuli and responses to which they are exposed 
immediately becomes apparent. The question is how 
designers can implement what is truly meaningful [27][28] 
to establish an optimum emotional relationship between user 
and product or environment. 
The concept of aesthetics applied to interactive products 
is a complex term, but necessary to establish an essential 
affective link between object and user. In this meaning, it is 
important to emphasise that aesthetics is not only based on 
the sensations deriving from surface appearance [29], but is 
conditioned by empirical factors related to use and function 
closely linked to a specific user and the task to be performed. 
As stated in recent researches [30], this interaction is also 
linked to product personality, which is important in order to 
make a consistent use. The interactive event provides the 
user with an expansive perception of the product which goes 
beyond the perception based on its appearance as it also 
concerns psychological and cognitive aspects related to 
achievement of the task and possible output. 
V. 
ACCESSIBILITY, INTERFACE AND INTERACTION 
DESIGN 
We have seen that by interacting with a device it is 
possible to consult and handle the information it contains, 
making accessible its functions, the tasks it can carry out and 
the knowledge it offers. Defining the concept of accessibility 
is not an easy task, as it depends on the specific context in 
question. We can consider accessibility as the set of all those 
conditions in the surrounding environment and the user 
which favour the achievement of a goal, whether it be 
economic, social, or in the case of our study, cultural. 
One of the most significant agents for accessibility is 
interface design, which is the key to appropriate interaction. 
We can initially consider the interface as a multiple space 
between two agents which enables communication by 
performing codification and decodification operations, 
thereby guaranteeing an information exchange. Limiting the 
definition for electronic environments, Mandel [31] defined 
the interface as „both computer hardware and software which 
presents information to users, enabling them to interact with 
the information and the computer‟ (p.14), thereby defining it 
as a medium through which users and computers 
communicate with each other, that is, the main agent for 
human-computer interaction. 
The concept although with nuances between authors, 
refers to two key ideas: the interface as contact surface or 
place between two entities which are not necessarily physical 
[32] and as key agent in the exchange of information 
between 
the 
user 
and 
the 
computer, 
enabling 
a 
166

communication relationship to be established. As Gui 
Bonsiepe (1999) has pointed out [33]: „A human interface is 
the sum of communicative exchanges between the computer 
and the user. It is what presents the information to the user 
and receives information from the user‟ (p. 42). 
The interface is a common space for both interactors (a 
logical mechanical entity and an organic one), it determines 
the typology of the actions and therefore the nature and 
scope of the communication. Multisensory experience 
(visual, tactile and sound resources) will give greater scope 
to the interface, while extending its use to more users. 
The construction of the interface involves considering 
such diverse fields as those touching users‟ perceptive, 
psychological and cultural peculiarities, the technical 
limiting factors inherent in the nature of the interface and the 
establishment of a structured taxonomy of the tasks it will 
enable. Thus, Rheingold maintains that the interface should 
be transparent, that interaction should not take place on the 
programme, but on the task itself [34]. Bonsiepe coincides 
with Rheingold and adds that the interface is nothing more 
than an intangible tool whose true raison d'être is to help 
users build a personal mental model to help them understand 
how the program functions, but without manipulating it 
directly [33]. Far from being a one-way communication 
system, an interactive interface -which now integrates both 
visual and audio signals- proposes a game with users which 
opens and amplifies their cognitive abilities [35] hence its 
importance for the subject of this study. 
A. Interface design: related concepts 
There are studies on interface design in the literature 
dating from the 1970s [36], followed by Apple publications 
[37], Open Software Foundation [38], IBM [39] and 
Microsoft [40][41]. All these studies highlight the 
importance of users as active participants in the design of 
any communication system, since knowing their modus 
operandi will enable a more efficient interface system to be 
generated thereby guaranteeing better accessibility to 
content. 
User acceptance of the interface largely depends on its 
practical operational ability. This concept known as 
cognitive compatibility [42] refers to complex information 
processing, accepted as a determinant part of human 
behaviour since the cognitivism emergence in the 1960s. 
Bruce Tognazzini [43] proposes 16 principles for 
interactive graphic interface design, that are based on the 
design of tasks to help users achieve certain goals. Cooper 
[44] provides another approach to interaction design, based 
on prior identification of user goals and designing the 
simplest route to achieve them in five stages, applying the 
five interaction design activities defined by Gillian Crampton 
and 
Philip 
Tabor 
[45]: 
understanding, 
abstracting, 
structuring, representing, and detailing.  
Above all these considerations, other authors [46] 
highlight the importance of matching user‟s expectations and 
actual experiences in interactive systems in order to 
guarantee a pleasant interactive process. These ideas refers to 
artistic spheres, but can be applied in all fields related to 
computer interface, because both interactive artwork and 
HCI aesthetics design „focus on users‟ perceptions and 
psychological states during experience‟ (p. 526). 
In short, we can say space for interface design is in the 
combination of user knowledge and goals, the tasks to be 
carried out and the necessary tools for that purpose. 
B. Basic guidelines 
We can state that treatment of the image, text and 
navigability must ensure formal and semantic unity 
throughout the interface. A solid organisation of content, 
tasks, functions and an appropriate navigation architecture, 
will speed up users‟ knowledge of the system. The practice 
of object-action syntax, the introduction of browsing and the 
adoption of graphic vehicles familiar to users also intervene 
to accelerate the learning required for control. Thus a space 
of action for the designer is establish where ordering logic 
and economy of resources should be directed at promoting 
communicative efficiency. 
VI. 
CLASSIFICATION OF DEVICES RELATED TO THE 
ACCESSIBILITY OF HERITAGE 
It is clear that many of the devices used in cultural sites 
don‟t guarantee a regular level of interactivity for all users. 
Disability or physical limitations prevent access to culture or 
understand the contents on equal terms, since these users 
assume a different perception of the environment, so that the 
most common interaction mechanisms implemented in the 
heritage access devices may no longer be effective. 
Realizing the importance of this issue, and considering 
the information previously treated, we have carried out a 
catalog of all accessibility related devices in the market, used 
in both cultural spaces as in other social areas. This section 
discusses a selection of the most common devices used in 
cultural enclaves. The aim is to establish a classification 
based on various parameters relating to the level of 
interactivity studied in previous sections, and thus better 
understand the scope of each of them, their limitations and 
appropriateness of their use for the fields of cultural heritage. 
For this purpose we have considered four parameters. 
First, the static or dynamic nature of the device, depending 
on the response to external stimuli and the ability to provide 
feedback to the user. Secondly, a classification based on the 
type of output information: touch, sight, hearing, as well as 
those designed for solving mobility problems. The third 
classification refers to passive or active nature of the device: 
input device, if it is able to receive new information for 
treatment and subsequent response, or output device, if only 
sends information to the user. Finally, a classification based 
on the level of interactivity within the parameters discussed 
in the literature review: according to the actors involved, 
according to the relations between messages, and according 
to the control over the writing and content. 
The results show that about half of the main devices used 
in cultural heritage sites present a dynamic behavior, that is, 
they have an output reaction caused by an input of the user. 
Many of these devices are designed to facilitate mobility, or 
require visual perception for use. Similarly, there are very 
few devices that offer full interactivity with the information 
they present: in most cases they only offer a reactive

response to user action, but they don‟t allow to interact with 
content. Thus, it remains necessary to focus the work of 
design in this field, in order to create applications that 
guarantee access to useful content and an appropriate 
response to a specific requirement.

DISCUSSION 
The quality of being interactive is frequently used to 
describe very different products and in some cases, in a 
contradictory way. If the term is overused, improperly used, 
or without reference to usability features, it can result in an 
initial sensation of rejection of the product. So, there is an 
obvious need to clarify what we mean by interaction as a 
first step towards specifically assessing this characteristic 
with quality criteria in different types of objects or interfaces. 
This paper has attempted to offer a perspective on the 
breadth of the concept of interactivity through an extensive 
literature review and analysis of some of the areas of study 
closely linked to the concept. 
In the last decade it can be seen that most studies related 
to interactivity focus on technological resources mainly in 
relation to the use of computers and graphic interfaces for 
digital applications where the visual and sequential 
organisation of the perceptive scene is particularly important. 
However, in order to highlight the role of people in this 
process it has been considered important to recover 
classifications which contemplate the set of participants in 
the process: people, messages and message structure. 
According to these agents three levels of interaction are 
established, which could guide methodical and empirical 
analysis of products and devices already implemented. Any 
device that focus on disabilities can be studied from this 
point of view, examining their potential for interaction. 
The review of other concepts and research related to 
interactive experience enables observation of the size and 
interest of this topic of study for architects and designers and 
the importance of aesthetic components as an inescapable 
part of objects and places.  
With regard to the design of user interfaces for 
computers, interaction aesthetics is a determinant element in 
the nature of the dialogue between user and information, 
opening a broad field for artistic practice based on 
multimedia experiences or providing the user with more 
efficient access to information.  
In the literature reviewed, we found there are numerous 
interaction studies based solely on visual attributes, ignoring 
elements that could enhance the interaction or lead to the 
development of new uses for interfaces. The wide expressive 
range of the movements of the human body, for example, 
can be used to establish a more dynamic relationship with the 
devices: speech, hands and finger movements to point or to 
drag objects, can certainly promote more intuitive contact 
with the contents and should be taken into consideration in 
any attempt to improve accessibility. 
All these approaches link multisensory perception, 
aesthetics and interaction as a substantial component in all 
kinds of products, places and services directed at people.

This idea must be kept in mind when designing for 
accessibility or for disabled people. 
We conclude this paper by stating that some major 
challenges for interactive product design in the XXI century 
include studying the potential of interactive images, 
incorporating the tactile qualities of materials, using the 
expressive and movement qualities of the human body, and 
giving the user the ability to discriminate between 
information, making content more pleasant and accessible.
