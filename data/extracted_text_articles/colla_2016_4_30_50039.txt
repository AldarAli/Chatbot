Abstract – Increasing market competition between service pro-
viders leads to further differentiation, currently often driven by 
offering so-called hybrid services. Hybrid services are typically 
implemented between several service providers as service chain. 
Hence, within service chains the effectiveness of collaborative, 
cross-company service processes constitute a major competitive 
factor. While basic service processes are typically company in-
ternal, service chains include cross-company administration, es-
pecially for service e-procurement. Hence, the collaborative ser-
vice chains also require domain specific information about pro-
curement and have to support information systems engineering. 
In turn, information systems have to support service e-procure-
ment and operations in an integrated fashion. To improve the 
transition from planning to implementation of collaborative ser-
vice processes with incorporated e-procurement, we suggest an 
integrated and formalized modeling approach. Our modeling 
approach will be practically demonstrated by case studies taken 
from the domain of industrial service procurement.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Current surveys highlight that services increasingly create 
value offerings to customers and thus constitute an integral 
element of many products [1], this includes industrial ser-
vices as one example of hybrid services. Industrial services 
make a significant share of companies total spending and en-
sure required operational levels and availability of systems 
and facilities. As a consequence, industrial service e-procure-
ment is gaining importance and an integrated perspective of 
goods and services is required [2][3]. An example of service 
chains in this domain are industrial maintenance services. 
They are typically delivered through third-party service pro-
viders to grant availability and reliability of industrial facili-
ties and infrastructures. For the procurement of these indus-
trial services, several service providers and service consum-
ers have to interact in industrial service chains [4].  
In multilateral service chains where capital goods produc-
ers, goods and service requesters, as well as specialized ser-
vice providers interact to produce, operate and administrate 
hybrid services. These cross company value added chains 
with flows of goods, cash and information are called service 
chains [5]. Hence, the ability to integrate and share products 
and services offerings of external business partners turns out 
to be a major competitive factor. In consequence, service sup-
pliers take focus on supporting customer’s processes or even 
offering to provide larger parts of value creation processes. 
Service suppliers and service requesters are collaborating in 
industrial service chains. In these service chains, the produc-
tion of services is in focus.  
Since service requesters request different service types 
from different service suppliers, new ways of flexible collab-
orations are emerging. In this case service e-procurement 
constitutes an important segment of e-business activities. It 
compasses extensive use of Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) to improve productivity and business pro-
cesses. Electronic processes support business interactions re-
ducing interfaces, process and throughput times and support 
improved harmonization of meta data, activities, procedures 
and integration of resources. E-business standards can help to 
support a shared process understanding and increase process 
transparency amongst business partners by harmonization 
and structuring of exchanged business data. In this way, e-
business standards facilitate enhanced interoperability.  
Electronic service processes of service chains are in focus 
throughout planning (modeling level) and operation (execu-
tion level). Nevertheless, there is still a lack for a precise 
modeling, analysis and benchmarking of these service pro-
cesses. The paper is focusing on the development of an inte-
grated analysis and modeling service processes in service 
chains. We suggest a formalized modeling method for collab-
orative business processes in service chains for further im-
provement. Our focus within that is the service e-procure-
ment. The overall research approach is based and evaluated 
on case studies of a research and standardization project [6]. 
The remainder of this article is structured as follows: In sec-
tion 2 the challenges of service e-procurement are outlined 
and the approach of iServMod is motivated. In section 3, the 
modeling approach of iServMod is presented while in section 
4, the modeling of service objects, in section 5, the modeling 
of eSN and in section 6, the modeling of hSN are described 
in detail. After the application of iServMod (section 7), con-
clusion and outlook are drawn in section 8.

II. CHALLENGES AND MOTIVATION 
Service chain collaborations achieve economies of scale, 
economies of scope and lower transaction costs. These col-
laborations are confronted with several challenges: The miss-
ing harmonization, integration and standardization of cross-
company service processes. Therefore, the creation of new 
collaborations suffers from low quality of business interac-
tions caused by integration and transaction costs, manual ex-
ception handling, offline communication (media breaks) and 
long procurement lead times; also resulting in less transpar-
ency and low quality of processes and data. The aforemen-
tioned shortcomings result from missing standards in docu-
ment exchange and lack of information harmonization. Also, 
in the past service processes for administrative order pro-
cessing in service chains did not draw much attention. How-
ever, especially these processes require many resources and 
incorporate long process and throughput times.  
Inefficiencies result from internal and especially cross-
company handling und coordination of transactions and non-
harmonized and non-integrated electronic service processes. 
Service processes must support procedural rules and service 
logic of required interactions and communication between 
service suppliers and requesters [2]. Industrial service e-pro-
curement is still source of high cost because underlying busi-
ness processes are error prone. Errors and failures occur fore-
most through the absence of coherent e-business standards 
and reference frameworks offering meta models of processes, 
data objects and interaction patterns taking into account the 
service logic.  
A. Research Objectives 
Within this paper, we follow paradigms defined in design 
science. Thus, knowledge can be gained by creation and eval-
uation of artifacts in the form of models, methods and sys-
tems. In contrast to empirical research, the goal is not neces-
sarily to evaluate the validity of research results with respect 
to their truth, but to the usefulness of the built artifacts as a 
tool to solve certain problems [7]. 
In this spirit, we will impose requirements driven by anal-
ysis of service and service e-procurement literature, inter-
views with domain experts as wells as hypotheses. The re-
quirements analysis will disclose the decisions for the design 
concept of our planning approach. In contrast to an approach 
driven by theory, the basis for the design not necessarily has 
to be formulated as hypothesizes. Hence, the planning 
method will be constructed, implemented and tested in a real 
environment. 
The paper proposes a model-based approach for the fol-
lowing reasons: information and knowledge has to be cap-
tured, before it can be part of sound analysis and utilization. 
Informal, semi-formal as well as formal models offer an ab-
stract possibility to represent information and knowledge. 
Furthermore, graphical representations such as class dia-
grams, data-flow diagrams, state-transition diagrams or Petri 
nets ease understanding between stakeholders both for the ex-
pert and the non-expert. Overall this facilitates the communi-
cation between persons of different domains. In addition, for-
mal languages allow to describe a certain phenomenon 
uniquely and precisely, but with a high level of abstraction of 
reality. They can be easily evaluated and verified or be used 
to automate certain tasks. The goal of this article is the defi-
nition of a modeling method which improves the quality of 
service chain definition by a domain-specific modeling ap-
proach, linked collaborative, cross-company service pro-
cesses, hierarchical modeling structures, and precise model-
ing of processes and data. 
B. Planning and modeling requirements 
Due to these challenges, the modeling of service pro-
cesses seeks for an adequate and precise integrated modeling 
approach as well as a precise system design for information 
systems. So far no adequate modeling approach based on a 
modeling language focusing the domain specific context of 
service e-procurement is existing. The modeling approach for 
system design should be based on a formal modeling lan-
guage to enable the following advantages [8]: 
 adequate concept for representation for domain specific 
description of data flow and control flow 
 formal semantics of workflow processes due to a formal-
ized syntax 
 uniqueness of syntax and graphical descriptions for an easy 
understanding 
 expressiveness for a precise system modeling 
 mathematical foundation for evaluation and sound proof 
of system design 
 analysis of information systems for properties like dead-
locks, performance or the correctness of information sys-
tems (regarding requirements) 
 interoperability and vendor independence of the modeling 
language, to support different modeling and analysis tools 
 consideration of static and dynamic elements in business 
processes to describe the control flow and data flow. 
III. STATE OF THE ART 
Scientific literature reveals several approaches for service 
procurement with different focus and different granularity. 
FlexNet Architect [20] offers reusable modules for the sce-
nario-based modeling of hybrid value creation. For planning 
and modeling of hybrid value creation networks, the cooper-
ation definition, actors, areas and information flows can be 
modeled. The HyproDesign [21] modeling language was de-
veloped for modeling customer specific configurations and 
calculations of hybrid bundles of services and is based on a 
meta model to describe variants and configurations. Single 
modules are described as semantic models via Entity Rela-
tionship diagrams [22]. Winkelmann and Luczak [23] pro-
pose a Petri net based approach for the cooperative supply of 
industrial services by using colored Petri nets (CPN) [24].

Becker and Neumann [25] define central components like 
processes and activities, technical objects, contacts and ser-
vice offers based on data models for the order transaction of 
technical services. Che et al. [26] are using XML nets [11] for 
modeling, execution and monitoring of cross-company busi-
ness processes. Mevius and Pibernik [27] propose XML nets 
for the support of business processes for the Supply Chain 
Process Management (SCPM). Every approach considers 
certain aspects of the description of services and service pro-
cesses. But none of these approaches represents a compre-
hensive model for the description of service objects and ser-
vice processes for industrial services based on a formalized 
approach. For modeling collaborative service processes and 
service objects in service transactions of service e-procure-
ment, no such domain-specific approach considering the 
characteristics of service processes for service e-procurement 
is existing yet.  
IV. INTEGRATED MODELING APPROACH FOR SERVICE 
MODELING ISERVMOD 
To meet the challenges and requirements described before, 
an integrated modeling approach based on a formal modeling 
language considering the domain specific context of service 
procurement will lead to the following advantages: 
 increased transparency in service chains: service pro-
cesses lack transparency due to individual internal service 
processes of service providers and service requesters. 
 precise modeling of collaborative service processes and 
data flow: the precise modeling of service processes and 
service objects serves as a basis for high quality documen-
tation and analysis. Internal service processes can be mod-
eled separately and put together in service process models 
with an adequate modeling approach support. 
 analysis of service processes: application of analysis 
methods for the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of 
service process models serve as a basis for benchmarking. 
 integration of domain specific context: integration of ser-
vice e-procurement context for its integration into infor-
mation systems.  
 support of modeling and execution layers: the modeling 
and the execution of service processes rounds up the com-
prehensive analysis of service process models. 
Such a modeling approach results into the improvement 
of the efficiency (performance) and productivity of the ser-
vice processes due to the reduction of process costs, reduction 
of process times, reduction of process throughput time, the 
improvement of process quantity, improvement of process 
transparency and increase of process flexibility. The inte-
grated modeling approach integrated service modeling 
(iServMod) is based on Petri nets [9]. A Petri net is a formal 
mathematical modeling language for the description of dis-
tributed systems. A Petri net is a directed bipartite graph, in 
which the nodes represent transitions and places. The directed 
arcs describe which places are pre- and/or post-conditions for 
which transitions. With Petri nets, major network structures 
like sequence, iteration, alternative, concurrency, synchroni-
zation and contact can be modeled and dynamic properties 
like liveness, reachability, boundness and soundness can be 
analyzed [28]. High level Petri nets fulfill these requirements 
and support an integrated modeling of service processes and 
service objects. 
A. Modeling Concepts 
Based on modeling concepts, service processes and cor-
responding service objects can gradually be modeled in a top-
down approach in detail or on a higher abstraction level. Ser-
vice processes can stepwise be transformed into different for-
malization stages and their hierarchical scaling and modular-
ization. For the modeling of different formalized service pro-
cesses, the screen model [10] serves as a modeling concept 
for Petri nets. The modeling concept support four different 
formalized Petri nets modeling language types, starting from 
informal modeling languages (Petri nets) up to programming 
modeling language types for an automated execution (XML 
nets [11]). The modeling concept describes the successive 
transformation of these modeling language types of Petri 
nets. The hierarchical and modular modeling of service pro-
cesses is supported by the layer model [12]. On a higher ab-
stract modeling level, process phases are choreographed. On 
a detailed modeling level, complex electronic processes 
based on web services are orchestrated. 
B. Petri Net based Modeling of Service Processes 
Petri nets are extended by syntactical extensions. There-
fore, the semantic of Petri nets and its characteristics aren’t 
changed. The extensions serve as a basis for a detailed and 
precise modeling of service processes (design time) in order 
to integrate service processes on the execution level (run 
time). In the first step, the modeling of service objects as 
static components of data schemas is presented.  Service nets 
as dynamic components of business processes are developed: 
single Service nets (eSN) based on place/transition nets are 
defined. High level service nets (hSN) based on XML nets in 
a second step are developed. With these Petri nets types, the 
screen model is supported. 
V. 
MODELING OF SERVICE OBJECTS 
Service objects describe static object-oriented components 
in service processes. Service object are identified data objects 
which describe central service master data and transaction 
data. These data are service requesters and service provider 
data, materials, service and business documents. Service ob-
jects are input and output objects of service processes. Service 
objects are economically relevant data objects which are exe-
cuted in electronic service processes as workflows. Service 
objects are relevant data objects like a service specification, a 
service order, a service invoice or another service-relevant 
data object for service transactions of service e-procurement.

For the graphical modeling representation, service objects are 
modeled with the XML schema model (XSM) [11] as model-
ing constructs in XML nets. XSM serves as a formal object 
description method to describe complex object structures in 
conjunction with organizational processes. As an example, the 
service object industrial service description is shown (Fig. 1). 
 
Figure 1.  Service object industrial service description 
XML schema diagrams are used to describe service ob-
jects. Data structures in XML nets are determined by Petri 
nets places. Places combine structured service objects with a 
common schema (typification of places). The modeling con-
structs of XML schema models are element types represented 
by UML classes and dependencies represented by association 
types. 
VI. 
SINGLE SERVICE NETS ESN 
For the modeling of eSN, we utilize places/transition nets 
(P/T nets) to support initial modeling phases. Places and to-
kens of these nets represent the current status of a service 
chain. Domain specific process interface place types and pro-
cess transition types are defined to standardize modeling. In-
ternal (private) service processes are modeling by pools. The 
interface place types service object places (SO), service in-
terface places (SS) and service document places (SD) are de-
fined. SO places are containers for general service objects. 
SS places are internal and cross-company interfaces for 
the data flow. Static interface places between service pro-
cesses and dynamic interface places for capsulated interface 
processes are defined. SD places serve as containers for ser-
vice document types. For transition concepts, service process 
phases (SP) are defined to reflect the specific process phases 
in service procurement. Service process modules (SM) 
represent service processes of a collaboration participant 
(service provider or service requester). SP and SM represent 
both a black box for further detailed modeled service 
processes. A service process phase consists out of service 
process modules. Service process phases and modules 
represent and apply hierarchical modeling concepts to 
support the layer model. As an example, the singe 
collaborative service process between a service provider and 
a service requester is shown in Fig. 2. 
VII. HIGH LEVEL SERVICE NETS 
The use of P/T net concepts accompanies a couple disad-
vantages: the semantic correctness cannot be checked, do-
main specific modeling constructs are not supported, commu-
nication and information concepts are not designed, the struc-
tured hierarchical modeling is not supported and tokens can-
not be specified individually. Thus we introduce modeling 
extensions of eSN with transfer to higher level service nets on 
the basis of XML nets with individual tokens. 
High level Service nets (hSN) are based on XML. Thus 
operational sequences and the document flow are based on 
XML and all tokens of are represented by complex structured 
XML objects. All activities correspond to operations on 
XML documents. hSN are characterized by domain specific 
extensions, and individual tokens. Furthermore, within hSN 
the phases of service chains are standardized. Thus, elec-
tronic service processes and their data flow can be precisely 
modeled, analyzed, simulated, executed and maintained.

Figure 3.  
Modularization of a service process phase by service process modules 
For the process interface place types, places are typified 
based on the domain specific context. Service process phases 
(SP) are represented by coarsened transitions with capsulated 
service processes based on service process modules. Service 
process modules are also coarsened transitions and contain 
capsulated service processes of one process participant (in-
ternal service process). Service process modules contain a 
service process which fulfills the requirements of a Workflow 
net [13].  
A service process module is defined by an internal struc-
ture and communicates with other modules based on process 
interface places. Service process modules (SM) describe uni-
directional and bidirectional interaction and communication 
patterns. Service process phases and service process modules 
contains typified input and output places SO, SS and SD. Ser-
vice process phases are defined with specific typified places 
in dependence on process patterns. Service process phases 
and service process modules are syntactically compatible. 
The service process phase offer (𝑡𝑠𝑝𝐴𝐺) is modularized by 
two service process modules (Fig. 3). The service process 
consists of the service process ℎ𝑆𝑁′𝑠𝑚1 of the service pro-
cess module 𝑡𝑠𝑚𝐴𝐺
1
 and ℎ𝑆𝑁′𝑠𝑚2  of the service process 
module 𝑡𝑠𝑚𝐴𝐺
2
. ℎ𝑆𝑁′𝑠𝑚1 of the service provider is modeled 
as an XML net. The representation of XML filter schemes 
𝐹𝑆𝑖, transition inscriptions 𝑇𝐼𝑖 and place type definition 𝑆𝑇𝑖 
are not modeled. The service process of the service requester 
is represented by the service process module 𝑡𝑠𝑚𝐴𝐺
2
. The 
place 𝑠𝑠𝑝1
𝐼𝑁1 and the place 𝑠𝑠𝑝1
𝑂𝑈𝑇1 are the in- and output of ℎ𝑆𝑁. 
The input place 𝑠𝑠𝑚1
𝐼𝑁1  (𝑠𝑠𝑝1
𝐼𝑁1) and the output place 𝑠𝑠𝑚1
𝑂𝑈𝑇1 as the 
input place 𝑠𝑠𝑚2
𝐼𝑁1  and the output place 𝑠𝑠𝑚1
𝑂𝑈𝑇1 (𝑠𝑠𝑝2
𝑂𝑈𝑇1) are mod-
ule interface places of the service process modules. Thus a 
high level Service net hSN is defined as follows: 
A Service net is defined as a tuple ℎ𝑆𝑁 =
(𝑆, 𝑆𝑆𝑂, 𝑆𝑆𝐼, 𝑆𝑆𝐷, 𝑇, 𝑇𝑆𝑃, 𝑇𝑆𝑀, 𝐹, Φ
, 𝐼𝑆, 𝐼𝑇, 𝐼𝐹, 𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑂, 𝐼𝑆𝑆𝐼, 𝐼𝑆𝑆𝐷, 𝑀0), where 
1. 𝑋𝑁 = (𝑆, 𝑇, 𝐹, Φ, 𝐼𝑆, 𝐼𝑇, 𝐼𝐹,  𝑀0) is an XML net. 
2. Φ = (E, FKT, PRE) is a structure consisting of a non-
empty and finite individual set E of Φ, a set of formula 
and term functions FKT defined on E, and a set of pred-
icates PRE defined on E. 
3. The set of places is structured in the sets process object 
places 𝑆𝑃𝑂 and service object specific places 𝑆𝑃𝑆. The 
set of 𝑆𝑃𝑆 is further structured in the sets of service ob-
ject places 𝑆𝑆𝑂, service interface places 𝑆𝑆𝐼 and ser-
vice document places 𝑆𝑆𝐷. 
4. The set of transitions is structured in the sets of process 
activities 𝑇𝑃𝐴 and service process activities 𝑇𝑃𝑆. The 
set of 𝑇𝑃𝑆 contains of service process phases 𝑇𝑆𝑃 and 
service process modules 𝑇𝑆𝑀. The set of 𝑇𝑃𝑆 is de-
fined as a real set of transitions 𝑇: 𝑇𝑃𝑆 ⊆ 𝑇. 
5. 𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑂 is the function that assigns a valid XML schema as 
a place typification to each place 𝑠𝑠𝑜 ∈ 𝑆𝑆𝑂. 
6. 𝐼𝑆𝑆𝐼 is the function that assigns a valid XML schema as 
a place typification to each place 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑠 ∈ 𝑆𝑆𝐼. 
7. 𝐼𝑆𝑆𝐼 is the function that assigns a valid XML schema of 
a service documents type 𝑗 as a place typification to 
each place 𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑗 ∈ 𝑆𝑆𝐷. 
8. 𝐼𝑇 is the function that assigns a predicate logical ex-
pression as inscription to each transition on a given 
structure Φ and the set of variables which are con-
tained on all adjacent arcs. 
9. 𝐼𝐹 is the function that assigns a valid XSLT expression 
to each arc which is conform to the adjacent XML 
scheme.

Figure 4.  Web Service net with web service selection 
A. Modeling of distributed Service Processes based on SOA 
Service processes can be modeled as dynamic interface 
processes and be executed by web services in service oriented 
architectures (SOA). iServMod supports the modeling and 
analysis of distributed service processes based on web ser-
vices by Web Service nets (WSN) [14]. A web service is con-
sidered as an implementation of a local service process (in-
terface process). A distributed service process can be realized 
by the composition of web services. Input and output mes-
sages represent the data flow in Web Service nets. Web Ser-
vice nets also support the composition concepts like the or-
chestration and choreography. The example service process 
validation of incorrect orders is models as an abstract Web 
Service net with web service selection (Fig. 4). 
B. Transformation and Execution of Web Service Nets 
Based on the precise modeling of all aspects of service pro-
cesses with Web Service nets, Web Service Business Process 
Execution Language (WS-BPEL) elements can be derived to 
use standardized web service technologies like interface de-
scription (WSDL), protocols (SOAP) or service discovery 
(UDDI). Web service process models [15] can be modeled 
and the transformation of Web Service nets into executable 
WS-BPEL code is based on control flow and data flow struc-
tures. Specific structures and elements can be identified and 
transformed into equivalent WS-BPEL structures. A detailed 
transformation of Web Service net structures into WS-BPEL 
code with a transformation algorithm is defined in [16].  
VIII. APPLICATION OF ISERVMOD IN USE CASES 
The integrated modeling approach integrated Service 
Modeling (iServMod) serves as an adequate method for a pre-
cise modeling and analysis of service processes. The ad-
vantages of iServMod increase the value of business process 
simulation and business process benchmarking. The simula-
tion of service processes based on key performance indicators 
reveals gaps and weaknesses. The execution of a process 
benchmarking identifies differences of relevant factors like 
throughput times, resource assignments or cost items. The 
causes of performance gaps can be analyzed. For the model-
ing and simulation of service process models, the software 
tool Horus [18] was enhanced by the new modeling exten-
sions of Service nets and used for a software based simula-
tion. As business process simulation method, a discrete event 
driven business process oriented simulation was used [19]. 
The strengths of the independent simulative analysis are the 
possibility of a “playground” by simulating different process 
alternatives. Evaluation of simulation results can shed light 
on correlations of system parameters at build time and can be 
used to develop action strategies [1]. Unlike analytical proce-
dures, the simulation can be used for the analysis of large sys-
tems. Based on benchmarks, performance gaps can be quan-
tified. Redundant service processes and non-value creating 
activities as well as automation potentials for service pro-
cesses can be identified and the error data is reduced. Also 
the cost-effectiveness of service processes can be ensured.  
The integrated modeling approach iServMod has been 
successfully applied in a research projects in the domain of 
service procurement [2]. The service process models of 18 
use cases between six service suppliers and four service re-
questers were analyzed, modeled, simulated and bench-
marked [1][6][17]. Service process models were modeled 
with high level Service nets. The modeling of Service nets 
was based on a reference process model [2] to structure and 
align the individual service processes. iServMod supported 
the precise modeling of service processes and service objects 
in a syntactical correct and semantic formal way. The data 
flow could be modeled based on XML. Service processes 
could be model in a hierarchical modeling approach based on

different abstraction levels to support modeling user groups 
with different modeling experiences. Service processes could 
be modeled top down from high level process description to 
detailed service processes as workflows using web services 
and representing and supporting a further implementation in 
information systems. Service process phases and service pro-
cess modules allow for reusability of pre-defined concepts by 
assuring the syntactical and semantic compatibility in service 
process models. The evaluated uses cases were compared 
pairwise for benchmarking by applying the presented proce-
dure model.  
IX. 
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK 
We presented the integrated modeling approach iServMod 
based on formalized modeling techniques. iServMod supports 
integrated modeling of service processes and service objects. 
Additionally, iServMod offers an adequate modeling ap-
proach for the precise analysis and implementation of service 
processes. iServMod is focusing on collaborative service pro-
cesses which are modeled independently by different compa-
nies and their domain experts (modelers). It furthermore sup-
ports the domain specific requirements of service e-procure-
ment in service chains.  
The presented modeling concepts enact different formal-
ization levels, starting from a semi-formal description of ser-
vice process models up to highly formalized and executable 
service process models. This includes a hierarchical order of 
service processes typically modeled ion a top down approach 
utilizing service process phases. The modeling approach is 
concluded by integrated description of web service calls to 
implement sound information systems at execution level. The 
syntactic domain specific extensions both of service object 
specific process interface place types and process transition 
types enable a precise hierarchical modeling of process par-
ticipants, modular service processes, e-procurement service 
phases, pre-defined process patterns, interfaces and service 
data objects. 
While eSN serve as an initial modeling approach and fur-
ther analysis based on Petri nets, hSN enable an integrated 
modeling of service processes and service objects for the de-
sign of information systems. The integrated modeling and de-
sign approach was evaluated with real-life case studies [2]. 
The service process models have been modeled and analyzed 
and the developed extension of the software tool Horus sup-
ports the overall modeling of collaborative service chains.  
As next steps, we foresee the evaluation of iServMod by 
a survey of domain specific users to determine. We also strive 
to further evaluate the performance, quality and efficiency of 
this approach together with several leading companies in the 
domain of industrial services. Furthermore, the adoption and 
application of iServMod in different domains and hence dif-
ferent types of service chains are planned.
