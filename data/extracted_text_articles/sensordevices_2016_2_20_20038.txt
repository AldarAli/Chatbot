Abstract — This paper presents a method to determine the 
octane number of gasoline products using a piezoelectric 
lateral electric field resonator. The dependence of permittivity 
of the gasoline on its octane number was measured. It has been 
shown that, for Russian gasoline grades, there is an unique 
dependence of aforementioned parameters. It has been found 
theoretically and experimentally that the frequency of the 
parallel resonance insignificantly changes with the change of 
the permittivity of gasoline contacting with free surface of the 
resonator. Our analysis shows that the value of the real part of 
the electrical impedance on the resonant frequency is 
unambiguously determined by the octane number of the 
gasoline. We provide an example of the determination of the 
octane number of an arbitrary mixture of different gasoline 
grades. We also consider the temperature of the gasoline 
sample under study. 
Keywords - octane number of gasoline; relative permittivity; 
lateral electric field excited piezoresonator; gasoline sensor. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Gasoline, which is widely used as engine fuel, represents 
the inflammable mixture of light hydrocarbons. The most 
important parameter of gasoline is its octane number, which 
characterizes its detonation resistance. This parameter is 
extremely important to ensure the optimal characteristics and 
durability of a working engine. Detonation is a process of 
spontaneous inflammation of air-and-fuel mixture not from 
the spark plug, but from heat of the gas mixture, which is 
compressed by the piston. In this case, burning has an 
explosive nature, which leads to the temperature excursion 
and the premature wear of the engine. In practice, the needed 
octane number is achieved by using special additives, which 
may evaporate in time. This process will lead to changes in 
the octane number of gasoline. So, in a number of cases, one 
needs to check the octane number of gasoline. At present 
time, the octane number of gasoline is determined by motor 
and research methods on special laboratory equipment [1]. 
These methods are carried out under laboratory conditions, 
with the help of expensive instrumentation and qualified 
personnel. Therefore, the development of the sensor for 
express analysis of octane number of gasoline acquired in 
fuel stations represents the prospective problem. At present, 
there exist only several papers devoted to express methods of 
octane number determination. For example, it is proposed to 
determinate the octane number of gasoline by measuring its 
viscosity [2]. But this method has not been put into practice. 
In our laboratory we develop the sensor based on the self-
excited oscillator the feedback of which contains the delay 
line based on the plate of Y – X lithium niobate with 
propagating acoustic wave with shear – horizontal 
polarization [3]. The liquid container with gasoline under 
study was placed on the path of acoustic wave. It has been 
shown that the frequency oscillation is unambiguously 
associated with the permittivity of the gasoline, which, in 
turn, is determined by its octane number [3]. It is well known 
that the lateral electric field excited piezo - resonator is 
sensitive to the change in the properties of contacting liquid 
[4]. Therefore, the aim of this paper is the development of a 
sensor for express analysis of gasoline octane number based 
on the lateral electric field excited resonator. In Section II, 
we measure the dielectric permittivity of gasoline. In Section 
III, we describe the fabrication of gasoline sensor. In Section 
IV, we theoretically analyze the sensor loaded by gasoline. 
Section V concludes the paper. 
II. 
THE MEASUREMENT OF THE DEPENDENCE OF THE 
RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY OF GASOLINE ON ITS OCTANE 
NUMBER 
It is obvious that, for the development of a sensor for 
express analysis of the octane number of gasoline, one 
needs to know its parameter, which is unambiguously 
determined by its octane number. As it has been pointed out, 
this parameter is permittivity. Table 1 contains the region of 
admissible values of permittivity for three octane numbers: 
80, 92, 95 and their averaged values [5].

The aforementioned grades of gasoline are standard for 
Russian market. We have measured the values of 
permittivity for these grades, which are also presented in 
Table 1. Below, our method of measurement is described. 
For measuring the permittivity, a plane air capacitor with 
shear dimensions of 20×20 mm2 and with the gap of 1 mm 
was fabricated. The capacity of this capacitor in air was 
measured with the help of the LCR meter 4285A (Agilent). 
A LCR meter is a piece of electronic test equipment used to 
measure the inductance (L), capacitance (C), and, resistance 
(R) of a component. Then, the capacitor was immersed into 
a sample of the gasoline under study and the capacity was 
measured again. With the assumption that relative 
permittivity of the air is equal to 1, the sought permittivity 
of gasoline was determined as the ratio of capacity in 
gasoline and capacity in air. The obtained data for the three 
grades of gasoline is also presented in Table 1. One can see 
that they are close to the values which are taken from 
literature. Figure 1 shows the dependence of the measured 
permittivity of the gasoline on its octane number.

octane number 
It is evident that permittivity of gasoline insignificantly 
increases with increase of the octane number. 
III. 
FABRICATION OF GASOLINE SENSOR  
For fabrication of the gasoline sensor, the piezoelectric 
resonator with lateral electric field based on the plate of 
lithium niobate of X cut was used (Figure 2). The plate 
thickness was equal to 0.5 mm. Two rectangular aluminum 
electrodes with shear dimensions 5×10 mm2 and with the gap 
between them of 3 mm were deposited in vacuum on the 
lower side of the plate.  
 
 
Figure 2. The gasoline sensor: 1 – piezoelectric plate, 2 – electrodes, 
3 – liquid container, 4 – gasoline under study, 5 – damping layer. 
The orientation of electrodes was chosen in such a way 
that lateral electric field was directed along crystallographic 
axis Y. Such orientations of the plate and lateral electric field 
lead to the excitation of longitudinal acoustic wave in the 
space between electrodes, which propagates along the 
normal to the surface and resounds between the sides of the 
plate [6]. The region around the electrodes was covered by 
the special damping layer. The metallic liquid container with 
the shear dimensions of 25 × 25 mm2 was placed on the 
upper side of the plate. These dimensions exceeded the sizes 
of the region of damping layer. The container was fixed to 
the plate surface with the help of gasoline-resistant epoxy. 
Figure 3 shows the frequency dependencies of the real (a) 
and imaginary (b) parts of the electrical impedance of the 
resonator with an empty liquid container. One can see that 
clearly expressed parallel resonance takes place at a 
frequency of 6.48 MHz. At that close to this frequency, the 
intensity of suppressed parasitic oscillations is significantly 
less.

parts of the electrical impedance of the empty sensor 
 
Then, we measured the frequency dependencies of real and 
imaginary parts of electrical impedance of the sensor loaded 
by the gasoline with a given octane number. These 
dependencies for values of octane numbers of 80, 92, and 95 
are presented in Figures 4, 5, and 6, respectively. All 
measurements were carried out under a laboratory 
environment with the temperature of 260C and atmospheric 
pressure of 99.5 kPa. The detailed analysis has shown that, 
as an analytical parameter which is unambiguously 
associated with the octane number of the gasoline we can use 
the value of the real part of electrical impedance of the 
sensor on the frequency of parallel resonance. The resonant

frequency does not depend on the grade of the gasoline. The 
dependence of the maximum of real part of the impedance 
on octane number is presented in Figure 7. This dependence 
may be used as a calibration curve of the sensor. 
We have also carried out the experiment to determine 
the octane number of the arbitrary mixture of gasoline 
samples with octane values of 80 and 92. The measured 
value of the maximum of real part of impedance turns out to 
be Rmax = 20.149 kOhm. This data corresponds to the octane 
number of 82.25. 
It is obvious that, in practice, the estimation of the 
octane number of gasoline must be carried out at different 
values of environmental temperature and atmospheric 
pressure. It is well known [7] that the liquid permittivity 
strongly depends on the temperature and insignificantly 
changes with the variation in atmosphere pressure. It means 
that the estimation of octane number of gasoline by 
measuring its permittivity requires the need of temperature 
consideration. Our experiments have shown that the 
frequency of the series resonance does not depend on 
gasoline octane number (Figure 8) but unambiguously 
depends on the temperature. So, in the future work, we will 
measure the dependencies of Rmax on octane number at 
various temperature values. In this case, we will obtain the 
calibration set of curves with the temperature as parameter. 
The dependence of the frequency of series resonance on the 
temperature will also be measured.

Therefore, the determination of the octane number of the 
gasoline considering its temperature will be performed in the 
following way. For the sample under study, the frequency of 
the series resonance and the value of Rmax will be measured. 
Then, by using the temperature dependence of this 
frequency, the temperature of the sample will be found. This 
will allow to choose the corresponding branch on the 
calibration set of curves and to determine the sought octane 
number by using the known value of Rmax.

THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF REAL AND IMAGINARY 
PARTS OF RESONATOR LOADED BY VARIOUS GRADES OF 
GASOLINE  
In this work, we also calculated the frequency 
dependences of real and imaginary parts of the resonator 
loaded with gasoline samples with different dielectric 
permittivity.  
The theoretical analysis was carried out using the finite-
element method [8]. The geometry of the problem is shown 
in Figure 9.

region of solution: the plate of resonator and the gasoline layer, e1, e2 are 
electrodes, d1, d2 are damping layers. 
 
The geometrical dimensions of all elements of the sensor 
and crystallographic orientations of a plate and electrodes in 
the XY plane are accurately equal to the experimental ones. 
The width of a piezoelectric plate, the electrodes and the gap 
between them were equal to 25 mm, 5 mm and 3 mm, 
respectively. The width of the area of a covering around 
electrodes was equal to 5 mm. The upper side of a plate was 
contacted with the layer of gasoline of 2 mm thick. 
In the direction of the Z axis, the structure was implied 
to be infinite. All calculations were carried out inside a 
circle with a diameter of 100 mm. The elastic, piezoelectric 
and dielectric constants of lithium niobate and its density 
were taken from [9]. The speed of sound in gasoline and its 
density were taken from [1]. The relative permittivity of 
grades of gasoline were assumed to be equal to 2.0, 2.1, and 
2.2 respectively. The computed dependencies of real and 
imaginary parts of electrical impedance for these three 
grades of gasoline are shown in Figure 10.

V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we developed a meter to measure the 
gasoline octane number based on the piezoelectric resonator 
with lateral electric field. The dependence of the relative 
permittivity of gasoline on its octane number was 
experimentally measured. It has been shown that, for 
Russian gasoline grades, there exists an unique relation of 
the aforementioned parameters. It has been theoretically and 
experimentally shown that the frequency of the parallel 
resonance insignificantly changes with the change in the 
gasoline permittivity. Analysis has shown that, as an 
analytical parameter unambiguously tied with gasoline 
octane number, one can use the value of real part of 
electrical impedance on the frequency of parallel resonance. 
An example of the determination of the octane number of an 
arbitrary mixture of different gasoline grades was given. We 
also considered the temperatures of the gasoline samples 
under study. The possibility of the consideration of the 
temperature of the gasoline sample under study is shown.
