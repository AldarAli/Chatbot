Abstract— The Compostela Ways correspond to a strong and 
heavy tradition in the Middle Ages. But it was quasi-forgotten 
during three centuries. In the last forty years, they have 
constituted a highly publicised phenomenon of our ultra-
modern society. In this paper, we analyse digital identities, 
motivations and social representations of the hikers from 
information and communication approach with a focus on 
meaning and interactions. We concentrate on the digital aspects 
of the Compostela Ways, especially identities, traces and 
interactions on social networks as a new perspective to this 
social phenomenon. We analyse the importance of this 
communication media for the hikers as a specific manner to 
interact and give meaning to their trip and all their life in our 
individualist and consumerist society. 
Keywords – digital identities; social representations; digital 
society; social media; Facebook; information; communication, 
situations; hikers, Santiago de Compostela. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
With the ascent of social media, the community of Santiago 
de Compostela hikers adopted this mediation tools: Facebook, 
Twitter, Instagram, etc. as it was the case previously with 
websites. The aim of this research is to study the digital 
identities and social representations of the Compostela hikers 
by analysing their Facebook posts. In a previous paper, 
published in the proceedings of HUSO 2018 Conference [1], 
we presented the first results. This paper consequently extends 
the previous results to an analysis of interactions and feelings 
on social networks especially on Facebook. 
In fact, Santiago de Compostela Pilgrim Way is a highly 
publicised phenomenon and it is part of a long tradition that goes 
back to the 10th century [2]. It reached its peak in the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries, times of affirmation of Latin Christianity in 
Western Europe and the Reconquest of Muslim powers in Spain. 
In this context, monasteries federations such as Cluny and 
Citeaux, Military Orders (Templars, Hospitallers, etc.) played an 
important role. After a long period of lethargy, for more than 
three centuries (1650 – 1980), the interest in Santiago de 
Compostela Ways has increased for the past forty years. In 1982, 
John Paul II was the first Pope to go to Santiago de Compostela. 
Since this visit, the number of people who obtained the 
“compostela” has increased significantly: from 2491 hikers in 
1985 to 7274 in 1991, 277,854 in 2016, 301,036 in 2017 and 
327,378 in 2018 from 177 countries. The Compostela is an 
official certificate given by Santiago’s archbishopric to those 
pilgrims who did at least the last 100 km on foot or horseback, 
or the last 200 km by bicycle. For this purpose, pilgrims have to 
collect the stamps on the “Credencial del Peregrino” from the 
places they pass through to certify that they have been there. We 
use the word hikers, rather than pilgrims, which has a religious 
connotation, not shared by all the travellers. These hikers come 
from Spain (44.03%) Italy (8.25%), Germany (7.73%), USA 
(5.68%), Portugal (4.40%), France (2.68%), etc. [3]. As shown 
in the last available statistics, Santiago de Compostela is 
currently trendy all over the world. In addition to the growth rate 
of visitors and hikers, this interest is also shown by the number 
of publications: books, films, newspapers, etc. in various 
countries and languages. 
In this paper, which is the second step in a larger project, we 
will focus on the digital identity of hikers in the specific issue of 
the “trace human”, a concept defined by B. Galinon-Mélenec: 
“The ‘trace human’ would identify the Human of the 21st 
century, leaving everywhere traces of his passage and activities, 
likely tracked by merchants, watched to the detail by observers 
of all kinds, punished for any deviation from the norm... risking 
to raise legitimate concerns about the respect of privacy, the 
respect of individual freedoms and of ethics” [4]. The virtual 
community of Compostela hikers, by communicating on social 
media, keeps traces of their experience, but also of their life, their 
thought, their feeling and of the villages, towns and cities they 
visit. These traces allow creating the digital identity of the 
members of this community. Since the invention of the Internet, 
this issue has been subject to many publications. For Stutzman 
“The social network community fosters a more subjective and 
holistic disclosure of identity information” [5] even though it has 
been demonstrated that “In cyberspace the economies of 
interaction, communication, and coordination are different than 
when people meet face-to-face” [6]. 
Below, we explained the method used (in Section II) to 
study the social representation and the digital identities of 
Compostela hikers. Then we focused on the theoretical 
foundations of this study (in Section III) and explained why 
Compostela ways constitute an interesting field to track 
interactions and digital identities (in Section IV). Afterward, 
we presented the results for both quantitative and qualitative 
methods (in Section V) before discussing them (in Section 
VI) and concluding (in Section VII).

II. 
METHOD 
In this paper, we study the presence of the Compostela 
hikers on Facebook. We address this issue through an 
interdisciplinary lens with a focus on the social representation 
theory. In fact “social representations provide criteria for 
evaluating the social environment that enable determination, 
justification or legitimization of certain behaviors” [7]. Social 
representations specify a number of communicative 
mechanisms explaining how ideas are communicated and 
transformed into what is perceived as common sense and 
allows the understanding and interpretation of the digital 
identity of the Facebook Compostela Pilgrim. 
As a first step, we focused our study only on francophone 
Facebook pages considered as a public space. We excluded 
personal accounts as they belong to the private space as well 
as Facebook Groups that belong to both private and public 
spaces with closed and public groups. Our choice is also 
motivated by the characteristic of a Facebook page. It lets the 
page owner engage with people on Facebook as anyone can 
follow a page to get the public updates, even those who are 
not friends on Facebook. To assess our issue we used a mixed 
method “to achieve a systematic understanding of both the 
magnitude and frequency of the phenomena (quantitative) 
under study and the context, meaning, and motivation of those 
phenomena (qualitative)” [8]. 
The search for the keyword Compostelle gave 
75 francophone pages on Facebook, the first one dating back 
to 2008 and being still active. Two of the accounts publishing 
these pages were commercial. As they do not allow any 
understanding dealing with our issue, we decided to exclude 
them. Since then, the number of pages has grown every year 
(see Figure 1) also showing the growing interest in the 
Compostela Ways phenomenon. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Number of Facebook pages created per year. 
Facebook allows classifying pages in different types, more 
than half (42 of 75) of the pages are designated by their author 
as a page that brings together a community (cf. Table I). When 
they create their account, people are trying to federate and 
create a community to be able to share their interests and 
feelings.

To conduct the data collection and analysis, we employed 
different tools. 
The online tool Likealyzer developed by Meltwater 
allowed us to evaluate the activity of the selected pages. It 
provides data according to 5 criteria: 
 
Frontpage, which gives the first impression 
concerning the Facebook page.  
 
About page, which should contain milestones that 
give context of the page and contact information.  
 
Activity, which gives the information type (text, photos, 
or videos), the number of posts per day, events, etc.  
 
Response, which measures the interaction with 
visitors.  
 
Engagement, which relates to people talking or liking 
the page.  
The 
Facebook 
application 
Netvizz, 
that 
allows 
investigating different aspects: 
 
Who? Which explore users’ profiles, their relations 
(friendship patterns and interactions), and the larger 
social spaces emerging through pages. 
 
What? pages that allow for an investigation into posts, 
in particular concerning media types and audience 
engagement. 
 
Where? For all outputs containing information about 
users, 
interface 
language 
is 
provided 
in 
a 
comprehensive way, because users do not have the 
possibility to prevent applications from receiving this 
information. While interface language is certainly not 
a perfect stand-in for the locality, it allows engaging 
the question of geography in interesting ways. 
 
When? Temporal data is limited to pages, but here, a 
timestamp for each post and comment is provided, 
allowing for investigating page and user activity over 
time. [9] 
As the Where aspect of Netvizz is based on the interface 
language, this criterion has not been accurate for our study. In 
fact, as we focused on French Facebook pages, it was more 
accurate to take into consideration the location listed in the 
posts than the language criterion. 
Netvizz allowed us to collect 5,782 posts for the year 2018. 
In fact, as the number of Facebook accounts pages is growing, 
we decided to focus on the year 2018 which has the most 
important number of posts related to our issue (cf. Fig. 1). 
The 
qualitative 
analysis 
took 
into 
consideration 
15 accounts with 3,286 posts. This sample represents 56.83 % 
of the total number of posts for 2018. The qualitative analysis 
has been done by using Nvivo 12.

III. 
A HIGHLY PUBLICISED PHENOMENON ILLUSTRATING 
THE CONTRADICTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY 
A. A privileged field to capture social representations and 
identity 
In this study, the “Compostela phenomenon” has been 
considered in a double perspective: search for meanings 
and analysis of the interactions between actors: “hikers”, 
inhabitants and the role of information and communication 
technologies and social networks in the new sociability of 
the Compostela Ways.  
We also have a position of “engaged” or committed 
researchers [10] because one of the authors accomplished 
the Santiago de Compostela walk in 2011 and continues 
his observations and discussions with other walkers, 
interviews with Tourism Office members, with people in 
charge of Compostela Walkers’ Associations, by specific 
documentary resources and by websites and social media 
networks. 
The Compostela Ways constitute a privileged field to 
outline two key concepts in Human Sciences: social 
representations and identities. As defined by D. Jodelet 
[11], “social representations constitute an ‘ordinary 
knowledge’. They describe, explain and recommend. They 
provide a method to interpret the reality, controlling our 
environment and driving us in society”. For J.-C. Ruano-
Borbalan, [12] “we interpret the world continuously 
through the representations that the brain accumulates… 
they constitute reference mind systems to understand the 
world around us. The social representations constitute a 
key concept for Human Sciences that allow the 
interpretation of the mechanism of intelligence, the 
ideologies and mentalities.” The proposed framework for 
this study subscribes to the perspectives drawn by these 
two authors. 
B. The modern individualism crisis: a multiple and burst 
identity questioning the sense of existence 
Modernity, which has gradually been affirmed since 
the beginning of the sixteenth century in the West, largely 
corresponded to the development of individualism at the 
expense of collective institutions and traditions as trade 
unions, religious organisations and even States. 
Having become actors of their lives in a secularised 
society [13], the human being has become responsible for 
their successes, as well as failures [14]. In a 
“communicating society, but where people meet less and 
less” [15] the individuals of social networks correspond to 
a “connected individualism” [16], but where the ultra-
connection does not prevent hard loneliness. The 
“Compostela Phenomenon” has progressively developed 
since the 1980s in this context of a crisis of meaning, of 
“tiredness 
of 
being 
oneself” 
and 
of 
“connected 
individualism” 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
ambivalence. 
This 
ambivalence corresponds to those of contemporary 
individualism and of all our consumerist society. Our work 
tries to illustrate these situations and ambivalent feelings. 
IV. 
 TRACKS FOR INTERACTIONS AND DIGITAL IDENTITY 
ON SOCIAL NETWORKS 
The Camino de Santiago – the Way of St. James – has 
always been a search for identity and meaning. In the Middle 
Ages, pilgrims belonged to various religious brotherhoods, 
benefiting from their assistance system (such as the 
organisation of groups to avoid the high level of insecurity of 
the ways: robberies and also murders) or a specific religious 
cult in a chapel dedicated to Saint James in their parish church, 
and also annual meetings, particularly on July 25th (St James 
day). Communities on Facebook reflect some of these two 
dimensions in the digital area that we can measure by the 
number of likes on each page.  
The Compostela Ways may both favor a collective 
approach or a search for loneliness, for the inner self, but 
staying always connected through their mobile Internet. For 
the collective approach, we can cite the Facebook page 
“Chemin de Compostelle” [Way of Compostela] that gives 
“All the information to enjoy the experience of Compostela 
Ways: advantages of each way from France, where to stay, 
monuments, landscapes…” [17] and for the inner self, we are 
referring to “Mon chemin à Compostelle” [My way to 
Compostela] where we can read in the About page “I feel like 
at the crossroads and I have to find the one that is mine. I am 
looking for myself, walking to find myself ...” [18]. 
Compared to similar religious phenomena like Virgins of 
Fatima in Portugal or Lourdes devotees in France, the 
presence of Compostela hikers is significant on Facebook, but 
compared to the number of Francophone hikers who achieved 
the trip and get the Compostela, it is not so high.  
These virtual communities vary between 35,444 followers 
for the largest one [17], and 89 followers for the smallest one 
[19]. These figures have been updated in February, 2019. The 
aims of both pages are to help those who make the way to 
Santiago de Compostela by giving advice, provide addresses, 
express feelings and emotions, and to surround themselves 
with their impressions and pictures. As these figures show, 
like brotherhoods and chapels in the past, social media allows 
hikers to brotherhoods and chapels. 
Today motivations have become secularised. NPOs and 
communities replaced brotherhoods of the past. Interactivity 
is the magic word. This is done in two ways, by commenting 
on a post or by posting a message on the page if this function 
is available. This was the case for 67 pages from the selected 
corpus and 45 had a response rate higher than 90% that may 
reflect the desire to share with others. In general, hikers share 
their feelings, thoughts, progression, experience, photos, 
videos, etc. and the community reacts, reassures or 
encourages. Sometimes they thank hikers for the shared 
information. NPOs provide assistance and advice. 
Today, social networks have become essential to share 
information about the Compostela Ways and to provide 
assistance, as the objectives of the pages suggest. 
Commercial Facebook pages (around 8%) have the same 
weaknesses as personal pages: contact information is missing 
and there are not many followers (There are 2,163 followers 
for the oldest page created in 2012 [20]. The analysis of these 
pages shows an obvious lack of professionalism: they are not 

13
International Journal on Advances in Systems and Measurements, vol 12 no 1 & 2, year 2019, http://www.iariajournals.org/systems_and_measurements/
2019, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
 
 
very active (less than 30% of interaction), the About page is 
not really enticing. If this weakness is acceptable for a 
personal page, it is less acceptable for a professional one. 
To be successful, the communication on FB pages should 
be optimised in order to increase user engagement. Posting too 
little or too much information can damage engagement and 
interaction with followers. The Compostela hikers post less 
than one message per day except for three pages that have an 
average of 6.6 [21], 2.7 [22] and 2 [17] posts per day.  
Facebook pages are a part of the identity of the connected 
Compostela hikers. All of them have a Frontpage in accordance 
with the standards. However, most of them do not depict the full 
context that helps to engage people, and they do not give 
information about their identity, even though, hikers leave 
enough traces to be able to capture some traits of their identity. 
The privileged means of communication remains the text, 
with the photo being widely used as well and the video, but to 
a lesser extent. Around 50% of the pages do not use photos, 
and 73% do not use videos. 
Many hikers (22%) did not post any information on their 
pages. Often, the FB page accompanies the walker on his/her 
journey and dies shortly after the end of the adventure. 
Numerous pilgrim walkers exchange on Facebook about 
preparation or keep in contact after the trip on the ways. Most 
of the associations linked to Compostela (Saint-Jean-Pied-de-
Port, Pyrenean Piedmont, etc.), as well as the more official 
institutions (Archbishopric of Compostela) have their own 
Facebook page, sometimes in several languages. They provide 
above all information, statistics, advice, addresses. In the past, 
their forums were not, in our opinion, very interactive; today, 
with Facebook, this is no longer the case. Nevertheless, this 
digital dimension of the pilgrimage becomes more and more 
important, especially social networks. 
V. 
DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS AND SOCIAL 
REPRESENTATIONS 
According 
to 
Santiago’s 
Archbishopric 
[3], 
the 
motivations of the hikers obtaining the “Compostela” were 
religious and others 156,720 (47.87%), religious 140,037 
(42.78), non-religious 30,621 (9.35%). The religious fact is 
not the only motivation for the majority of hikers. They are 
mainly “cultural hikers” more than pilgrims in the strict sense 
of the term, that is to say, with mixed religious and cultural 
motivations and often the challenge of a personal experience 
to better understand oneself in interaction with others. 
Motivations may be extremely diverse. It is often a 
willingness to review a turning point in one’s life: divorce, 
bereavement, retirement or entering the active life for younger 
adults, especially Spanish. There are also various dimensions 
of a group trip or an individual trip: to be able to meet others 
and oneself, walking on a known and valued road linked to the 
past, traditions and cultural heritage. 
More generally, motivation is above all a search for 
meaning, in the ambient materialism of the consumer society. 
In addition, the motivation is a search for authenticity. We can 
cite the overworked executive director who forsakes their role, 
their social and hierarchical positioning for a period. Some 
may walk the Way in response to a wish or for a sick person 
(intention). 
There may also be cultural motivations: the Compostela 
Ways are a magnificent book of art history: Romanesque, 
Spanish Renaissance (“Plateresco” in Spanish) or Baroque, 
discovery of diverse landscapes, contact with nature, etc. 
Alternatively, there are also historical and traditional 
motivations: to walk the routes of thousands of pilgrims who 
have travelled these paths for more than a millennium. 
Up to a certain point, the Compostela Ways put the hikers, 
regardless of their social standing, on an equal footing, dealing 
with the challenges of a long-distance walk. However, some 
clues can be significantly revealing. There are those who sleep 
in the overcrowded refuges, those who prefer private inns and 
monasteries (more expensive but more comfortable), the 
various categories of hotels, those who carry all their 
necessities in their bags, those who have support cars (“coches 
de apoyo” in Spanish) from family’s support or have received 
the services of transport companies step by step, etc. 
The values of shared meaning and the quality of 
relationships that fostered the rise of Christianity twenty 
centuries ago and that of the Compostela Ways in the Middle 
Ages are again reflected in the success of the Compostela 
Ways. They create shared meaning and some solidarity, often 
emphasised, of people who meet new people. They help each 
other and learn to walk together towards the same goal and 
sometimes stay together (couples form on the ways). 
The quality of relationships depends on the search for a 
certain authenticity. The language barrier is often easily 
overcome, as English has become the common language for 
the majority of hikers. For P. Nadal [23], “The Way... is not a 
simple walking way... [it is] an initiatory journey to the inner 
self that would change the perception of many things... the 
disconnection from the superfluous, the communion of the 
body with nature... For us, the Compostela Ways may be 
assimilated to a “semiotic machine” for the construction of a 
meaning of existence. It is a point to develop in future works.  
Do these motivations emerge from the Facebook page’s 
posts? Can we follow the steps of the hikers on the 
Compostela ways? 
To be able to answer these questions, we carried out a 
qualitative analysis on 15 pages from the 75 selected pages. 
We have excluded: 
 
Pages with more than half of the posts containing 
links. They cause redundancy and they do not add 
anything new to what is demonstrated in the other 
pages.  
 
Pages with commercial offers. The aim of these pages 
is to sell services and does not contain any 
information about feelings and experiences of 
walkers. 
 
Pages with fewer than 50 posts all over the year 2018. 
These accounts are not very active. 
Only text posts have been analysed, the other form of 
publications (text, photo, video and link) will be covered at a 
later stage. 
As mentioned previously, we extract data by using 
Datavizz Facebook application. This data-driven approach 
enabled us to create a database of 3,336 units extracted from 
the 15 selected accounts that have been analysed with 
Nvivo 12.

A. Facebook Pages Types 
When a user creates his own pages on Facebook, he has to 
classify his page among different categories. The remained 
15 pages have been classified as follows: Three Blogs, 
8 community, 2 NPO, 1 Website, culture and society and 1 
touristic webpage and local attractions. In fact, a close 
analysis of the content of the pages allowed us to suggest this 
classification: 
 
pages that serve as synchronous diary. For some 
walkers, they share the preparation of the trip, their 
experience during the trip which village they crossed, 
what churches they visited and express their feelings 
and emotions. We can cite “Aller à Compostelle” [Go 
to 
Compostelle] 
[24] 
or 
“Mon 
chemin 
de 
Compostelle” [My way to Compostelle] [25]. They 
continue to publish after the trip sharing their feelings 
and impressions as well as information about 
Compostela. 
 
pages that serve as asynchronous diary. The posts 
serve 
to 
share 
memories, 
photos, 
readings, 
thoughts… For example, in Compostelle à l’infini 
[Compostela endlessly] [26] Florence [the owner of 
the page] explained in the about page why she is 
writing after the trip: “I do not know how to do it other 
than in a delayed mode. Doing it in live mode or 
online it is not for me. I cannot imagine myself doing 
20 to 30 km per stage and make a daily report 
publishing it “instantly” on the web.” 
 
mixed pages “Pèlerins de Compostelle” [Compostela 
Pilgrims] [27] managed by Fabienne Bodan who 
wrote many guide books on Compostela where we 
can read information about her trip, her personal life 
like the death of her father. She also shares impersonal 
information concerning books, events, articles or 
broadcasting about the Santiago ways as well as 
information concerning other hikers  
Hubert, 82 years old and his 
walking companion Thierry from the 
Châlonnais both visually impaired 
started their trip to Santiago de 
Compostela. (1st of May, 2018). 
 
a real community page that regroup people with a 
common characteristic interest living together within 
a larger society. These pages serve to share 
testimonies and photos of the Santiago Ways. For 
example “Radiocamino” [28] gathering pilgrims from 
Belgium that also meet in real life as they organize 
events and share activities even though this page is 
not categorised as a community but as a “website, 
culture and society.” 
 
pages belonging to associations and promoting their 
activities (exhibitions, film screenings, conferences, 
etc.). They relay the information of some walkers and 
report the publication of an article or the release of a 
video or a broadcast about Santiago de Compostela. 
We can mention the page of “Compostelle 2000” [29] 
which, since 1998, has provided assistance to pilgrims 
and hikers on their way to Santiago of Compostela 
and the “Agence des chemins de Compostelle” [30] 
created in 1990 which informs the public and 
implements actions of cultural, educational and 
tourist valorisation of the old ways of pilgrimages 
towards Santiago de Compostela or the local 
association which aims to promote the way in a 
specific region, e.g., “Compostelle Loire Atlantique” 
[31]. 
 
photo album pages where more than 80% of 
publications are photo tokens all the way going to 
Santiago de Compostela with a short comment on the 
place where the photo has been taken. It is the case of 
“Chemin Saint-Jacques de Compostelle” [Santiago de 
Compostela Way] [22] 
 
pages that could be equated to touristic guides. We 
can cite 
“Chemin de 
Compostelle”[Way 
of 
Compostela] [17]. It gives advice and information 
concerning the Ways of Santiago de Compostela: 
what could be seen or visited, the cities, the 
monuments, what and where to eat, gastronomy, local 
products, festivals, traditions, stories and legends… 
The stated purpose is to help walkers or pilgrims to 
decide which way to choose and what the best period 
is to walk way. 
In this classification, we split on purpose pages belonging 
to an association and community pages. In the latter the words 
used to describe activities are more familiar and warmer: 
26 participants came this Monday 
to Anderlecht for the first Pilgrim's 
get-together in Brussels. Thank you 
for the exchanges, the sharing, the 
testimonies, the meetings, the 
listening, the advice... Friendships 
were woven tonight: nothing can make 
me happier! See you soon on the 
Belgian paths and at the next get-
together :-)(11/12/2018) [28] 
B. The most important is not to reach Compostela, but the 
Way by itself 
The content analysis of selected Facebook pages 
demonstrates that Compostela ways are not usual ways. Many 
hikers write about its impressive aspect, they spoke about their 
feelings and emotions before, during and after the trip. 
We left without any certainty. We 
have stamped our credentials. Day 
after day we walked without never 
really imagining our arrival in Saint 
Jacques de Compostela. (9/11/2018) 
[24]. 
Compostela ways are a kind of mix between a personal 
challenge, a search of oneself and an interest in arts and 
history. They are a way of spiritual quest, but not only in the

religious meaning. People who do the trip try to take stock 
with their life when appreciating encounter and exchanges in 
an original way to travel as tourists. 
1) A way of spiritual quest, a way to take stock of their life 
Diverse posts have highlighted reasons that push a walker 
to involve themselves in this adventure, and who go all the 
way despite the difficulties. The Way is seen like a way of 
redemption and renewing of the self. As evidence, we can cite 
two different walkers who shared and commented a 
newspaper article [32] about three prisoners who, by making 
the Way, “volunteered to reflect on themselves; they expect 
listening, friendship and they are searching for a new meaning 
of their lives and to think about their future.” These comments 
reveal their opinion and what they think about the Way: 
We never tired of saying 
Compostela is a way for all and also a 
path of freedom for prisoners! 
(17/12/2018) [33]. 
The paths of Compostela as a way 
of redemption for the prisoners? 
(19/12/2018) [27]  
The Way is also seen as a means to bounce back after 
suffering from a tragic event in life. It could be the death of a 
beloved person, or after a critical illness. We can highlight the 
post of this pilgrim who lost her father and who shared a photo 
of a heart on the floor. She wrote: 
You were a big-hearted dad, I am 
offering you this heart, collected in the 
ways, to go with your so brutal flight 
to another world. Thank you for what 
you did for many people during your 
82 years in this life. You kept your 
legendary dynamism until this serious 
stroke took you in 48 hours. I will keep 
you in my heart forever? (14/6/2018) 
[27]  
Other hikers reported the story of “Julie [who] left all by 
herself, on the road to Arles, with a camera and some objects 
that belonged to her deceased mother to make a film and its 
mourning on the way.” (12/3/2018) [27] 
But for the hikers, walking the ways of Compostela is 
more than that: 
To walk is also to share. One’s 
doubts, joys, sorrows, and life. 
(3/3/2018) [27] 
2) A Way of Encounters 
Our form of life requires a faith that stimulates us to walk 
the Way. It can be qualified as a way of encounters and 
dialogue. This is true, as it is a theme that often comes up in 
many posts. Interactions with others and sometimes 
interactions with oneself are always reported at each stage of 
the trip. 
By publishing on Facebook, the hikers try to establish a 
relationship of trust with their followers. They post messages 
such as “have a good day”, “have a good week”, “best 
wishes”, etc. They share their experience, their difficulties. 
They describe each stage of their trip and their followers’ 
comment and encourage them. 
Day 12 Sainte Eutrope. Another 
long, but beautiful stage through the 
fields and vineyards. A favourable 
weather at the departure from 
Mazeray. Marvelled by the beauty of 
Romanesque churches, the lantern for 
the dead. (21/7/2018) [34] 
In their post, the word Ultreia is quite recurrent. “The word 
‘Ultreia’ (also ‘ultrella’ or ‘ultreya’) comes from Latin and it 
means ‘beyond’. Ultreia is another pilgrim salute, like the 
more popular ‘Buen Camino!’. While ‘Buen Camino’ literally 
means ‘have a good journey, a good Camino’, the meaning of 
‘Ultreia!’ goes a bit deeper, implying encouragement to keep 
going, reaching ‘beyond’, heading onwards. 
It is also believed medieval pilgrims used to greet each 
other with ‘Ultreia, Suseia, Santiago’, meaning something like 
‘beyond, upwards, Santiago’. Other sources suggest ‘Ultreia’ 
was used in the same way as ‘Hallelujah’, once pilgrims 
finally reached Santiago de Compostela.” [35] By ending their 
post with this word, do hikers encourage themselves in their 
trip or does the repetitive aspect of this word suggest that 
hikers use it as an identity affiliation? 
Ultreia 
Every morning we walk the Way, 
Every morning we go further. 
Day after day, St Jacques calls us, 
It is the call of Compostela 
Ultreia! Ultreïa! E sus eia Deus 
adjuva nos !. (2/2/2018) [34] 
The other kinds of interactions are the real-life encounters 
and exchanges on the Way. Often, the hikers report their 
encounters with other pilgrims, with hospitaleras and 
hospitaleros. They anonymously mention the confidences of 
the people they meet, such as the one who confides the illness 
of his wife, or the pilgrim whose heel hurts and so that he 
cannot finish his stage. The Way promotes sharing as 
expressed by these hikers.  
After 2 hours’ walking, I came 
across an open barn and house. At the 
entrance, a table is set with fruits, 
boiled eggs, coffee, dried fruits… En 
donativo (we give what we want). A 
great place run by cool young 
people.” (10/6/2018) [36]

I have had wonderful encounters, 
people who stood by me when I went 
through rough patches. The Way is a 
great family with a classless society, 
we are all here for the same reason, 
reach the end.” (8/10/2018) [25]  
Talking about social classes, much the same can be said 
when we look at the housing system described by the walkers. 
In general, they are using cottages, camping and tents. Hotels 
were rarely mentioned at least by the walkers. 
3) An obsessive Way full of happiness and suffering 
Many hikers, in their posts, seem to be obsessed by the 
Way. Months before, they start to write about their preparation 
for the walk as we can see: 
Well, there I cannot back off. The 
camino del-norte is calling me. 
Departure from Chartres on 
September 3. The 4th, I will walk in 
the footsteps of my fellow pilgrims.” 
(8/7/2018) [25] 
When they start walking, they express their happiness as 
well as their doubts: 
Sometimes simply some tiny thing 
makes us happy. Starting our Camino 
from Madrid, it is with joy that we 
found our first yellow arrow, so 
symbolic of a new adventure in the 
ways.” (6/3/2018) [27] 
The way is a long-drawn-out process, but this does not 
prevent the walkers from enjoying it. 
D2: Shelter of Orisson – 
Roncevaux, 16 km. At the beginning 
the sky was clear, but not for a long 
time. The difference in level is less 
important today than yesterday. Cold 
rain, snow, fog, but I ARRIVED I am 
so happy. A lot of emotions invaded 
me today: the freedom to be in this 
beautiful nature, in the middle of the 
beeches, the desire sometimes to cry, I 
do not know why?” (14/5/2018) [36] 
But they are also flooded with doubt: 
When you walk alone, greater is 
the desire to drop out… but you are 
here to test your limits even if each 
step counts.” (2/4/2018) [34] 
Walking the Way of Santiago de Compostela is more than 
a hike: the body and the spirit are put to the test. This 
adventure can change a life. 
Do not worry! Everything will be 
alright! The shoes or the backpack do 
not hike. These are just simple tools. 
Only you are going to hike in Santiago 
Not even your legs but it is your brain 
your mind, your brain, your mind: 
20% physical effort 80% morale. The 
most important thing is to manage the 
pain, the fatigue to keep the morale.” 
(25/9/2019) [24] 
When the walkers end the journey, it is not really the end. 
Walkers are always attracted by the Camino Ways. They have 
the “Camino blues” and express it: 
This way is not just any way. It 
becomes a way of excellence, a quest 
for the absolute. If it is difficult to set 
out for this journey, how many people 
think or dream about it... It is also 
difficult to go back, find the nature, the 
forest, these plains as far as the eye 
can see, sown with corn or sunflowers, 
get up early with a smile and put on 
the boots. As soon as you get back, 
you feel the urge to go away from the 
noise, the pollution, to find that inner 
peace to the rhythm of my steps and 
my stick [mon bourdon in the original 
text]”. Precisely, being down in the 
dumps [le bourdon in the original 
text]... let us talk about it or not. This 
morning, I do not take the Way, so I 
will not go further. Ultreia” 
(1/8/2018) [34] 
The Camino can change a life. This could be summarised 
by the “about” pages of “Compostelle à l’infini” [Compostela 
endlessly] page: 
This page does not aim to "unpack" 
everything about why or how. The Way 
is peculiar to everyone, and I consider 
that I have no advice to give. The 
comments that accompany my photos 
are only my feelings, in view of my 
sensitivity, my experience. I recognize it, 
the way has changed my life. Or rather, 
it transformed me. Due to a long 
exterior path, and therefore interior.” 
[26]  
These posts, extracted from different Facebook pages, 
reminded us of a quote by Lao Tzu, a Chinese philosopher 
from the 5th century B.C.: “There is no way to Happiness, 
Happiness is the way” and in our case the different ways of 
Compostela seem to be the Happiness.

C. Hikers identity from traces left on social networks 
Facebook users are said to use “authentic identities” 
throughout the site’s documentation. Normally, we can 
identify nominatively people as well as their age and 
sometimes their address or at least the city where they live. 
Most of the time people share their photo, their opinion, their 
way of thinking, which allows the reader to reconstitute the 
digital identities of the walker. Many indicators could be 
helpful. 
A first clue could be the way hikers express themselves. 
In the verbatim concerning the camino blues, we kept the 
word bourdon as this pilgrim is playing with words. In fact, 
bourdon has a double meaning in French. Bourdon is the 
walking stick of the pilgrim which was supposed to chase out 
infidels and devils, while “avoir le bourdon” can be translated 
as being down in the dumps.  
From this linguistic detail, we can infer a humoristic trait 
of this pilgrim’s character. 
There are also those who use a literary style with many 
quotations: 
Christian Bobin. Life is a gift of 
which I untie the strings every morning 
when I wake up (24/12/2018) [26] 
Walking is not about saving time 
but losing it with elegance. Auguste Le 
Breton. (11/7/2018) [34] 
And those who use a telegraphic style:  
Cultural moment. Church of St 
Thibault 16th 17th century at château 
Porcien. 12/3/2018 [37] 
The vocabulary used is also very revealing: for example, 
“the way of the cross”, “path of faith”, “way of life” ... denote 
their religious culture. 
Other pilgrims express their faith and religious practices 
openly: 
A 12 o’clock pilgrims’ benediction 
at the cathedral. Again, I cannot help 
crying on hearing the crystalline voice 
of the nun who sings... I already think 
of another Camino with my love. 
(15/6/2018) [36] 
Or when they write about the votive candles: 
I lighted 3 candles in Santiago de 
Compostela Cathedral: one for my 
family to be protected, another for my 
friends asking for the same, one for 
our dear dead people wishing peace 
for their relatives. (9/10/2018) [25] 
The way they mentioned a church is also very informative. 
Many hikers name it by the city name while others use the 
patron saint to whom the church is dedicated to designate it. It 
is a further indication of a religious culture.  
In general, we do not enter a church just to admire the 
statues. For many pilgrims these churches are seen as places 
of local pilgrimage. 
But above all, by the traces left in these posts, backtracking 
the journey of a tripper becomes easy from a geographical 
point of view.  
Day 10 From Questembert Halls 
passing by Saint Clair fountain. We 
need shells to get to Malansac 
(10/4/2018) [34] 
All along the way of Compostela, many frames or 
sculptures of Saint James shells indicate the Way. That is why 
this tripper is mentioning that he needs many shells to get to 
his destination.  
The towns and villages mentioned in the posts cover 
almost all the ways from France to Compostela. 
As demonstrated by D. Cardon [38] the process of identity 
construction has found privileged spaces in the social-network 
services to deploy. It is the case of the Compostela hikers. The 
Internet offers multiple social environments in which to 
perform representations of social identity, Facebook is one of 
them. It is a publication tool offering people original formats 
for narrating their personal identity. But whatever the reason 
to set out for this journey and the identity of the walker it still 
remains a great life achievement: 
Tourist or pilgrim walker or 
Christian hikers or atheist ... does it 
matter? (23/3/2018) [24] 
VI. 
DISCUSSION: TYPOLOGY OF HIKERS AND INTERNAL 
AND EXTERNAL WAY 
C. Bourret [2] proposed a typology of the people met in 
the Compostela Ways that may be extended to users of Social 
Network Services: 
 
Authentic pilgrims (with main religious motivations),  
 
Semi-pilgrims or walkers’ pilgrims in different 
groups 
including 
those 
called 
by 
Spanish, 
“turistigrinos”, a mix of tourists and pilgrims,  
 
hiker-pilgrims, above all for the pleasure of the walk 
and its interactions,  
 
sportsmen or sportswomen, often walkers but also 
cyclists or riders, in search of physical experience and 
exceeding their limits.  
 
Cultural walkers, cyclists or riders very interested in 
various monuments and cultural heritage,  
 
minimalists, only walking a few kilometres to collect 
the precious stamp on the “credential” to finally 
obtain the precious “Compostela” as the others. 
 
Strictly tourists. 
There are always different degrees of involvement or 
participation: from a few days (with special organized trips, 
particularly in May) to more than 2 months, but almost always

in one direction, rarely going back on the same ways, instead 
they use cars, coaches, trains or planes to return home. 
Actually, two aspects of the Way coexist for and in each 
tripper in a “walking situation towards Compostela”.  
First, the outer dimension, the most visible one: the hikers 
walking, interacting, living, meeting people on the 
Compostela Ways. It corresponds to the walking act by itself, 
visible and tangible: the way with the places crossed, the 
difficulties, the encounters, etc.  
But there is also the whole inner dimension of the 
ways [39], invisible, intangible. It is about the thoughts, the 
feelings, the internal emotions that we tried to catch. 
We can draw a similar analogy with work situations, 
where we talk about the invisible part of the human being 
work. Only a visible part of human activity at work is 
observed and analysed. Information and Communication 
sciences as well as Management sciences are studying this 
hidden part of the whole dimension of feelings, emotions, 
states of mind, etc. [40]. Trying to make all visible all this 
invisible and unformulated part of the Compostela Ways 
experience. It is the challenge that we tried to tackle and to 
construct the digital identity of the hikers. 
Most often, hikers indicate in a neutral way that they have 
visited a church. They rarely indicate whether they prayed or 
not. Is this a form of self-censorship in our secularised and 
highly critical society about values and the religious 
manifestations, especially in France? But do they walk on the 
Compostela Ways only by chance? Just for the physical 
challenge or to roll out and enjoy a beautiful art history book 
in the middle of striking landscapes? The search for the 
meaning of existence is often formulated. That of the spiritual 
dimension, particularly religious, is much less avowed 
because probably censored in our secularised society. 
According to the pilgrim’s posts, the places mentioned are 
very different. Beside the well-known places (Saintes, 
Rocamadour, Roncevaux, Fromista, Leon, Sahagun, etc.) they 
mentioned different other places and often little known that 
have individually marked each pilgrim. This corresponds well 
to our constructivist approach as defined by P. Watzlawick 
[41], according to which each one builds his own reality: each 
pilgrim builds his own path. In fact, “The way is for everyone, 
but everyone makes his own way,” as explained by 
A. Etchegoyen interviewed in a documentary film on 
Compostelle [42]. The idea that everyone builds his own way 
is also present in Machado’s poem mentioned in many guide 
books to Compostela: “Traveller, there is no path, you make 
the path by walking”. The fact that everyone constructs his 
way leads us to the constructivism theory as explained by 
Edgar Morin [43]. 
Finally, there are three different parts of the Camino, 
totally complementary, corresponding to a progressive 
process 
and 
the evolution of the experience 
and 
representations of the hikers. First, the preparation of the 
Camino: a few months before or even sometimes for several 
years before the departure. Second, the Camino properly: 
walking on the path for one or more periods, which may take 
several years. And thirdly, the after Camino which is still in it, 
but too often forgotten as expressed by JM Maroquin, former 
priest of San Juan de Ortega: “When you are back home, 
consider that you will always remain on the way, and that you 
will always be there, because it is a way which does not know 
the end.” [44] 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper we studied the interactions of the Compostela 
hikers by analysing their Facebook posts. This analysis 
brought us to comprehend the identities and social 
representations of the hikers. The Compostela Ways are a very 
revealing ambivalence and brings into question our society. 
Compostela hikers always return transformed by their 
participation in the Compostela Ways and by their interactions 
with other people. In future works, we would like to try to 
consider the evolution of the representations and the identities 
of voluntary “pilgrims”, at the beginning and at the end of the 
“pilgrimage” and thus the changes produced by their 
experience. As formulated by J.M. Marorquin, the “Camino 
will always be part of the walker’s mind.”  
The Compostela Ways are a particularly favourable 
ground to meet others but also to find oneself, constitutive of 
the widened “thought,” central in the new humanism 
advocated by L. Ferry [45], who tries to answer the question 
of the sense of existence, which is at the heart of the crisis of 
contemporary individualism. 
The Compostela phenomenon is a good way to investigate 
one's identity, and more specifically the digital identity, with 
all the traces left on social media. Through the queries of the 
“trace human”, we go back to the eternal question of life’s 
meaning and of our presence on Earth. Humans do not escape 
their fate, which is to try to understand (or not) the meaning 
of their lives and about their passage on this Earth, regardless 
of the communication medium or device they use. The 
identity and existence questions remain.  
As the Camino always continues, we are only at the 
beginning of our work to better exploit all the collected data. 
We want to further compare our results with deeper content 
analysis and new interviews with people who have walked on 
the Camino. With the idea to better understand the "invisible" 
part of the path that takes place inside each tripper. Always in 
the idea of "informational tracking" [46] approach, we would 
also want to try to follow the evolution of the digital identity 
of the hikers all along their way and, if possible, after, for a 
few years. This is another big challenge.
