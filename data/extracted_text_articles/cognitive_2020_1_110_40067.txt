Abstract—There are very few connections between physics and
cognitive psychology. But in this paper, we assume that recent
models inspired by concepts issued from physics and problem-
solving cognitive processes like the Model Human Processor with
Real Time Constraints (MHP/RT) model (Kitajima and Toyota,
2012) [1] allow to better describe and predict human behaviors
especially in complex and dynamical environments where inter-
actions between several bands and space-time constraints exist.
After presenting the importance of the concept of resonance
in physics and in cognitive psychology, the deterministic chaos
in human action and behavior will be described, by focusing
on an innovative model directly inspired by models issued from
physics and problem-solving cognitive processes, Model Human
Processor With Real Time Constraints (MHP/RT). If nowadays,
the distance between physics and psychology is very prominent,
the main goal of this paper is to defend the necessity to (re-
)create strong relationships between physics and psychology to
better understand and predict human behaviors because these
situations are the majority of situations where an individual
takes actions (such as walks, reads, stops, watching the other
pedestrians’ behavior in complex buildings or in street, etc.).

INTRODUCTION
The human mind is endowed with innate primordial per-
ceptions such as space, distance, motion, change, ﬂow of
time, and matter. Nevertheless, nowadays, there is very few
connection between physics and cognitive psychology. Can
physics offer anything to the cognitive sciences? The primary
goal of this paper is to demonstrate why the answer to this
question is in positive.
Physics is science that deals with the structure of matter
and the interactions between the fundamental constituents of
the observable universe. Psychology is scientiﬁc discipline
that studies mental processes and behavior in humans (and
animals). Physics (the basic natural science) elucidates the sim-
plest fundamental questions in nature. Psychology is intimately
related to the humanitarian sciences. Physics is concerned with
all aspects of nature. Psychology is the science of individual
or group behavior. Despite fundamental differences, there are
the same problems even in so completely different disciplines.
Interdisciplinality is best seen as bringing together distinctive
components of two or more disciplines [2].
From a historical point of view, physics and psychology
were strongly related [3]. For instance, in Wilhelm Wundt’s
(1832–1920) Leipzig laboratory and at numerous other re-
search sites, procedures, techniques and tools issued from
physics were used to conduct reaction time experiments. In
the same way, the purpose of Wheatstone (1802–1875), one
of the most famous English physicist, was to test his theory of
stereo vision and for investigations into what would now be
called experimental psychology.
But nowadays, the distance between physics and psy-
chology is important: ﬁrst, very few courses of fundamental
sciences (biology, physiology, etc.) exist in psychology cur-
riculum; second, no psychology course is proposed in science
curriculum except for some hours in speciﬁc curricula (e.g.,
curricula in cognitive sciences). From an epistemological point
of view, one of the main determinant factors was the division
of the human being into a soul and a body which are united
but separated [4]. This division, which corresponded to the
Aristotelian classiﬁcation of substances (Metaphysics XII),
posed the problem of the unity of the science of the soul and
its place alongside other ﬁelds [5] and explain the absence of
connection between physics and psychology in teaching. Yet,
the experimental methods in cognitive sciences have physics
as their basis.
In this paper, we assume that a majority of interactions,
including psychological interactions between humans and and
environment (social or physical environment), can be derived
from physical processes and thus, be apprehended by using
concepts issued from physics such as resonance.

RESONANCE IN PHYSICS AND IN COGNITION
This part is aiming to investigate the relationships between
physics and psychology about the common concept of reso-
nance.
A. Resonance in Physics
Initially, the term resonance originates from the ﬁeld of
acoustics, particularly observed in musical instruments, e.g.,
when strings started to vibrate and to produce sound without
direct excitation by the player. Today, because this type of
synchronization between two elements in a same environment
(with the same constraints) is observed in other areas, reso-
nance phenomena occur with all types of vibrations or wave
(e.g., mechanical resonance, acoustic resonance, electromag-
netic resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, and so on).
The phenomenon of resonance is known and observed for a
long time. For instance, In 1665, the Dutch physicist Christiaan
Huygens, inventor of the pendulum clock, was lying in his bed
with a minor illness and watching two of his clocks hanging
on a wall. Huygens noticed something odd: No matter how
the pendulums on these clocks began, in 10 minutes, they
ended up swinging in exactly the opposite direction from

each other. The cause of this effect, called “odd kind of
sympathy” by Huygens, remained a mystery for centuries.
Recently, two mathematicians Oliveira and Melo [6] calculated
that, as pendulums move back and forth, sound pulses could
travel through the wall from clock to clock. These pulses can
interfere with the swings of the pendulums, eventually causing
them to synchronize. Based on several experiments, Oliveira
and Melo [6] have developed a model explaining the Huygens
problem of synchronization between two clocks hanging from
a wall. In their model, each element (i.e., clock) transmits once
per cycle a sound pulse that is translated in a pendulum speed
change. Today, because synchronization between two elements
in a same environment (with the same constraints) is observed
in a great number of areas, their model is used in several
domains such as acoustics, cosmology, and mechanics. In other
words, in physics, resonance occurs when the behaviors of two
(or more) elements in a physical environment are synchronized
by an autonomous (and unconscious) process of vibrating
transmission between these elements.
B. Resonance in Psychology: Explanation of Imitation and
Learning for Newborn
The young child’s ability to imitate the actions of other hu-
man beings is an important mechanism for social learning and
for acquiring new knowledge. Since the ﬁrst study conducted
by Meltzoff and Moore [7] who reported evidence that two- to
three-week-old infants imitate the behaviors of an adult model,
a lot of reports of newborn imitation have been cited to support
hypotheses about the origins and nature of imitation, including
the hypothesis that imitation is a unitary competency inherited
as a unit and may be shared as a unit by species with common
ancestry (e.g., [8][9]).
Several studies about newborn [10]–[13] imitation have
also shown that a specialized neurological mechanism under-
lies imitative behavior in human infants and adults, and that
this neurological mechanism is inherited. According to these
authors, this neurological mechanism is a “mirror system”.
The idea of a mirror system specialized for imitation was
initially suggested by the discovery of “mirror” neurons in
monkeys [14][15]. Because mirror neurons appear to have
both sensory and motor properties, nowadays researchers see
in them the potential for a straightforward, automatic and
heritable mechanism for imitation in humans [8]. The exis-
tence of this “mirror neurons” system for human has been
demonstrated by using fMRI and was localized in the right
inferior parietal lobe [16][17]. For human beings, the mirror
system offers a way to make newborn imitation feasible: the
“mirror-neuron” system appears to bypass the requirement
for precocious knowledge and cognitive abilities in newborn
infants who imitate because the system itself embodies that
knowledge. The mirror system is thought to directly match
visual input from an observed action with a stored motor
program for the same behavior (e.g., [10][12][13]). If that
motor program is then executed, the result is imitation.
Since ten years, the “mirror-neuron” system has received
much interest in recent years because of its putative involve-
ment in a range of important cognitive processes (for a synthe-
sis, see [16]), from action understanding, observational learn-
ing, to socialization, theory of mind, and empathy. Moreover,
dysfunction of the mirror system has been linked with some
clinical disorders (e.g., in apraxia, autism,and schizophrenia,
see [12]) and in social human behaviors, see [18].
The mirror-neuron system is the main biological support
for resonance between individuals whatever the context (physi-
cal or social context): so, within natural social contexts, actions
of individuals often imply interactions with others individuals
by using the mirror-neuron system [19].
In other words, we assume that the mirror-neuron system is
the physical/neurological support for the resonance in human
behavior: newborn imitation is the result of a synchronization
between behaviors issued from two elements in a same en-
vironment (i.e., the newborn and the adult). First, the adult
initiates a behavior (e.g., tongue protrusion with mouth open-
ing); Second, this external stimulus from the environment is
processed by the newborn by perceptual/visual system to create
internal representations, which “resonate with” memory to ac-
tivate the relevant portion of memory automatically (Kitajima
and Toyota (2012) [20]), and this initial activation triggers
successive activation though its adjacent connected regions.
The activated network at some time later deﬁnes what follows
in the future, i.e., next behavior (i.e., tongue protrusion with
mouth opening).
III.
RESONANCE IN DETERMINISTIC CHAOS
If resonance is well-know in closed system from physicians
and psychologists, the deterministic chaos is more relevant to
understand it in our complex and open real systems.
A. The Deterministic Chaos: Generality
Classically, all physical laws are described by differential
equations (e.g., [22]–[24]). Because initial state of elements
present at the same time in a same physical environment,
environmental constraint, and physical laws are known, it is
possible to theoretically predict the future of the physical
system (i.e., future states of elements) for all times. This
is the deterministic view of nature. In other words, physics
systems are deterministic because they obey deterministic dif-
ferential equations. Because Wilhelm Wundt’s background was
in physiology, and this was reﬂected in the topics with which
the Institute was concerned (e.g., the study of reaction times,
sensory processes, and attention), this deterministic principle
was used in the Institute for Experimental Psychology at the
University of Leipzig in Germany in 1879, the ﬁrst laboratory
dedicated to psychology. This deterministic principle is one of
the main principles of modern psychology and always used in
experimental design in psychology.
As observed for many systems in physics, acoustics and
mechanics, knowledge about the future state is limited by the
precision with which the initial state can be measured [25][26].
That is, knowing the laws of nature is not enough to predict the
future. There are deterministic systems whose time evolution
has a very strong dependence on initial conditions. In other
words, the differential equations that govern the evolution of
the system are very sensitive to initial conditions. Usually,
physicians and mathematicians say that even a tiny effect,
such as a butterﬂy ﬂying nearby, may be enough to vary
the conditions such that the future is entirely different than
what it might have been, not just a tiny bit different. In
this way, measurements made on the state of a system at a
given time may not allow us to predict the future situation
even moderately far ahead, despite the fact that the governing
equations are exactly known. By deﬁnition, these equations
are named chaotic and that they predict a deterministic chaos
(for a recent review: [27]). This difﬁculty to have a global and

perfect knowledge of the initial state of a human being is also a
common characteristics in human and social sciences. In other
words, as said Lorentz in 1963 [28], deterministic chaos can
be used:
When the present determines the future, but the ap-
proximate present does not approximately determine
the future.
A deterministic chaos system has three characteristics that
can be applied to human behavior:
(A)
Long term behavior is difﬁcult or impossible to
predict: Even very accurate measurements of the
current state of a chaotic system become useless
indicators of where the system will be;
(B)
Sensitive dependence on initial conditions (a prop-
erty noted by Poincare, Birkhoff, and even Tur-
ing): Starting from very close initial conditions a
chaotic system very rapidly moves to different states;
(C)
Local instability versus global stability: In order
to have ampliﬁcation of small errors and noise, the
behavior must be locally unstable: over short times
nearby states move away from each other. But for the
system to consistently produce stable behavior, over
long times the set of behaviors must fall back into
itself, i.e., resilience.
So, deterministic chaos focuses on the behavior of dynamical
systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions but
sustainable in the environment, that could change within a
limited range, with a resilience mechanism.
B. The Deterministic Chaos in Human Action: Time Scale of
Human Action
Human behavior can be best viewed as a composite of non-
linearly connected four bands that are associated with different
characteristic times, ranging from 10−4 sec to 107 sec as
suggested by Newell [21, page 122, Fig. 3-3]. As shown by Ta-
ble I, it identiﬁes non-linearly connected four bands; SOCIAL,
RATIONAL, COGNITIVE, and BIOLOGICAL BANDs. The
claim that human action should be structured in terms of
the discrete four bands suggests that it should be possible
to build predictive and explanatory models for activities that
happen within a single band, and at the same time, it should
be impossible, or inappropriate, to build predictive models
that include activities that happen in multiple bands with
inter-band interactions. Impossibility of constructing predictive
models for inter-band activities comes from the existence of
non-linear connections between bands. This should make the
models non-linear and even if they are deterministic they suffer
from SEnsitive Dependence on Initial Condition (SEDIC), the
primary feature of such a non-linear system and make them
unpredictable.
C. The Resonance in Deterministic Chaos for Organizing
Human Behavior
The majority of situations where an individual takes ac-
tions, such as walks, reads, stops, watching the other pedes-
trians’ behavior in complex buildings or in street, etc., is
performed in space-time environment where different factors
and physical constraints exist. For example, as Hoogendoorns
and Bovy [29] said, one of the most interesting and challenging
theoretical and practical problems in describing/predicting
pedestrians behavior are route choice and activity scheduling.
The main reason is that, compared to other modes of transport,
a characteristic feature of pedestrian route choice is that routes
are continuous trajectories in time and space: since a pedestrian
chooses a route from an inﬁnite set of alternatives, dedicated
theories and models describing pedestrian route choice are
required. There exists several models describing and predicting
pedestrians behavior, these models being mainly issued from
mathematics, computer science, psychology, and sociology.
Recently, Kitajima and Toyota [1] conceived an innovative
model (called Model Human Processor with Real Time con-
straints (MHP/RT)) to describe and predict human behavior in
dynamic and complex environments.
MHP/RT is directly inspired by models issued from physics
and problem-solving cognitive processes, and simulates peo-
ple’s action selection as interactions between System 1 (uncon-

scious automatic fast processes carried out in the time range of
< 100 msec in the BIOLOGICAL BAND) and System 2 (con-
scious deliberate slow processes which take seconds, minutes,
and even much longer in the COGNITIVE, RATIONAL and
SOCIAL BANDs) that make use of memory through the res-
onance mechanism. System 1 and System 2, otherwise called
“Two Minds”, are the terms used by Kahneman [30][31].
They constitute the basis of behavioral economics, which deals
with decision making in human beings’ economic activities.
Figure 1 illustrates MHP/RT schematically. It operates in two
bands, the asynchronous band and the synchronous band.
The Bodily Coordination Monitoring System and the Memory
Processing System operate in the asynchronous band. The
Perceptual Information Processing System, Conscious Infor-
mation Processing System, Autonomous Automatic Behavior
Control Processing System, and Behavioral Action Processing
System operate in the synchronous band. These systems work
autonomously. System 1 of the Two Minds corresponds to the
Autonomous Automatic Behavior Control Processing System,
and System 2 corresponds to the Conscious Information Pro-
cessing System.
Even if the human brain is not literally divided in a dual
system, the distinction between the two systems (System 1
and System 2) is a useful analogy. Figure 2 illustrates how
MHP/RT outlined by Figure 1 works while a person behaves
in the real environment:
1)
When a sensory input is extracted from the physical
and/or social environment (e.g., visually and auditory
information), System 1, System 2 and Long Term
Memory (LTM) are activated by neural activation
based on matching and mapping processes;
2)
System 1 (biological band) thinking is automatic,
quick, intuitive, emotional and reactive while Sys-
tem 2 thinking is conscious, effortful, logical, and
deliberate. System 1 is driven by emotion and snap
judgement, especially if we are time-pressed, mul-
titasking or tired. Most of the time, most people
function using their System 1 as it requires little
effort. System 1 operates automatically and quickly,
with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary
control;
3)
System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental
activities that demand it, including complex computa-
tions. The operations of System 2 are often associated
with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and
concentration;
4)
Finally, a motor output (i.e., a behavior, an effective
action) is produced on the basis of the mental repre-
sentation elaborated;
5)
In reality System 1 and 2 work in tandem, they
complement each other: System 1 feeds relevant input
into our System 2.
This dual-process approach posit that a lot of cognitive
process – decision-making, emotion processing, memory for-
mation, or even the manifestation of thought itself – can arise
from one of two “pathways” (System 1 and System 2), and that
those two pathways can operate relatively independently from
one another. In other words, the MHP/RT model processes
through a combination of Systems 1 (intuition or pattern-
recognition) and Systems 2 (analytic) thinking.

characteristic behaviors of participants (or elderly passengers)
who had deﬁcit in one of three cognitive capabilities of atten-
tion, planning and working memory. The different operations
can be described as follows:
•
memory activation triggered by external/internal (bod-
ily) stimuli starts in the lower BIOLOGICAL BAND,
and it is kept activated in the lower BIOLOGICAL
BAND;
•
System 1 processes in the upper BIOLOGICAL
BAND (< 100 ∼ 150 msec) hook the part of acti-
vated memory to act in a feed-forward control, which
we describe System 1 process uses the memory by
resonance; because individual is arriving from Narita
Airport by train and because s/he wants to go to
visit the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, s/he has to go to
the upper ground of the train station; so trafﬁc signs
about stairways and elevators are visually detected in
surrounding environment;
•
System 2 processes typically performed in COG-
NITIVE and RATIONAL BANDs hook the part of
activated memory to act in a feed-back control, which
we describe System 2 uses the memory by resonance;
because many exits are possible from the upper ground
of Tokyo train station, individual has to choose the
most relevant; if s/he remembers that the Imperial
Palace is located very closed to South exit, s/he has to
choose the South exit; so s/he has to activate mental
schema to ﬁnd this relevant exit;
•
System 1 and System 2 are synchronized occasionally
to check if the feed-forward control works ﬁne, – since
System 1 and System 2 work in different BANDs, they
may suffer from the features of deterministic chaos
and cannot be connected linearly; if unfortunately,
South exit is closed because works, individual has
to choose another way; for instance, s/he can decide
to go to the East exit then to take the way on the
right side to access to the Imperial palace; or s/he can
decide to follow other pedestrians who have map of
the Imperial Palace in their hands because s/he can
hypothesize that these other pedestrians want also to
visit the same location;
•
the memory activation that reﬂect directly the external
and internal bodily situations which should represent
“reality” is one part of resonance, and System 1
processes and System 2 processes for creating actions
to interact with the environment and should cause
changes that deﬁne the next situation for the behaving-
self are the other part of resonance; several times
during her/his movement, individual monitors and
controls that s/he is on the good way;
•
resonance is a mechanism for coordinating non-
linearly connected BANDs to have the self behave in
the ever-changing environment

physics and psychology is very prominent. The main goal
of this paper is to defend the necessity to (re-)create strong
relationships between physics and psychology to better under-
stand and predict human behaviors, especially in complex and
dynamical environments where interactions between several
bands and space-time constraints exist. And these situations
are the majority of situations where an individual takes actions
(such as walks, reads, stops, watching the other pedestrians’
behavior in complex buildings or in street, etc.).
The modern MHP/RT elaborated by Kitajima and Toy-
ota [1] is directly inspired by models issued from physics and
problem-solving cognitive processes, and simulates people’s
action selection as interactions between System 1 (unconscious
automatic fast processes carried out in the time range of
< 100 msec in the BIOLOGICAL BAND) and System 2
(conscious deliberate slow processes which take seconds, min-
utes, and even much longer in the COGNITIVE, RATIONAL
and SOCIAL BANDs) that make use of memory through the
resonance mechanism. Based on several notions issued from
physics (deterministic chaos, resonance) and based on several
concepts issued from psychology (long term memory, working
memory, attention), we assume that this kind of model is a
good example of models combining physics and psychology
allowing to better describe human behaviors.
