Abstract—Non-contiguous Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing (NC-OFDM) Cognitive Radios (CRs) pose an 
intriguing situation for optimal pilot-pattern generation. It has 
been proposed that in order to attain the lowest possible Mean 
Squared Error (MSE) of a channel estimator, the pilots should 
be placed adjacent to an interfering Primary User (PU) to 
allow for the highest pilot to data symbol cross-correlation and 
the lowest pilot auto-correlation. In past research, this has 
been shown to provide a significant decrease in the channel 
estimator’s MSE; moreover the optimal power loading 
required such that the PU does not experience interference 
above a certain threshold from the Secondary User (SU) is not 
taken into account. This leads to a contradiction between the 
optimal power loading and the optimal pilot pattern. In this 
paper, the relationship between these two concepts is 
investigated with the implementation of a Minimum Mean 
Squared Error (MMSE) Wiener filter and the optimal pilot 
positioning is derived.

 INTRODUCTION 
Bearing in mind the practical limits of higher frequency 
ranges, spectrum scarcity has become a great issue. This is 
further exacerbated by the immense growth of services and 
protocols which demand an ever increasing link speed. It has 
thus become of great importance to achieve as high a spectral 
efficiency as possible when engineers design the next 
generation wireless communications systems and standards. 
A solution widely accepted as a spectrally efficient and 
practical alternative to spectrum re-arrangement is cognitive 
radio. Cognitive radio works on the basis of an intelligent 
software-defined radio (SDR) where a CR user (also known 
as the secondary user) transmits in licensed (or primary user) 
frequency bands when the licensed user themselves are not 
transmitting [1]. This solution promises to be an almost ideal 
alternative since, in a perfect implementation, the entire 
usable spectrum would be fully utilised.  
The call for cognitive radios is further backed by research 
and surveys done on spectral usage in typical geographic 
areas. It has been noted that even though much of the usable 
spectrum has been occupied and licensed, it is only used 
anywhere from 15% to 85% of the time in a wide geographic 
and time dispersion [2]. This can be even lower in certain 
situations such as sub-urban environments where frequency 
utilisation from 100 MHz to 3 GHz can be utilised as little as 
7% of the time [3]. An interpretation which can derived from 
this is that much of the usable spectrum is reserved for 
licensed operation but is only used by its licensees a very 
small percentage of the time or that its actual licensed use is 
limited to a relatively small geographical area. 
It is commonly proposed that a non-contiguous OFDM 
system be used to implement a CR system. This allows the 
sub-channels of an OFDM system which interfere with the 
primary user to be switched off. This means that the NC-
OFDM system would comply with one of the principles of 
CR such that any CR-compliant communications are 
transparent to, and need not be considered by, non CR-
compliant systems. 
In this paper, the related work in the fields of optimal 
power loading and optimal pilot patterns is described in 
Section II. The system model used to derive the proposed 
solution is described in Section III and the proposed solution 
itself is derived in Section IV. The simulation results are 
shown and discussed in Section V and a conclusion is drawn 
in Section VI.

RELATED WORK 
In related work, two aspects of CR research focus on the 
optimal pilot patterns and the optimal power loading for 
secondary users. In [4] the optimal power loading is 
investigated for CR users such that power loaded to the 
individual sub-channels (which are then assigned to SUs) is 
such that interference to PUs, which are adjacent to the SUs, 
is kept below a threshold value as specified by design. It 
found in [4] that the optimal power loading profile which 
maintains interference to the PU below a threshold is that of 
a ‘step’ profile, meaning that less power is allocated to sub-
channels closer to the PU and more power is allocated to 
sub-channels farther away from a PU. 
The optimal pilot pattern for the SU in a cognitive radio 
environment is investigated in [5]. It was found that when a 
PU initially starts transmitting it is optimal to convert the 
sub-channels adjacent to the PU’s transmission band to pilot 
sub-channels. This is such that the cross-correlation between 
pilot and data symbols is maximised (as the addition of an 
54

extra pilot sub-channel can only increase the cross-
correlation) and the auto-correlation between pilot sub-
channels is decreased. It is also noted that the MSE of the 
estimator also depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 
the received pilot symbols [5]. 
These two aspects are both optimal in their own sense but 
it was found that they crucially fail to consider their common 
dependence. While the optimal pilot pattern proposes that an 
extra pilot be placed adjacent to the PU (with MSE 
decreasing as the pilot sub-channel is moved closer to the 
PU) it is not considered that the SNR of the pilot symbols in 
the sub-channel may only decrease due to the decrease in 
transmission power for the pilot bearing sub-channel as 
necessitated by the optimal power loading algorithm. This 
contradiction is further exacerbated by the fact that a PU 
would, in most practical situations, be non-orthogonal to the 
SU and therefore the SU would have a higher noise floor on 
sub-channels closer to the PU, additionally reducing the SNR 
available for pilot sub-channels. 
A further addition to the problem is the principle of 
boosting the power for pilot symbols. This is characterised as 
the pilot-to-data power ratio (PDPR) and the point behind it 
being that a lower estimator MSE can be achieved by 
allocating more power to pilot symbols than which is 
normally allocated to data symbols.  
Research done on this contradiction, as presented in this 
paper, has led to the development of a solution where the 
optimal pilot pattern is achieved while maintaining the 
optimal power loading profile such that interference to the 
PU is kept below a desired threshold. The channel estimation 
method used is the MMSE criterion implemented as the 
Wiener finite impulse response (FIR) filter. 
III. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
The model used to simulate the CR system is that of an 
OFDM transmission of N  sub-channels having 
d
N  
carriers disabled due to an interruption caused by a PU. This 
allows spectrum to be fully utilised since there would be no 
guard-bands between the PU’s and the SU’s signal. 
The system is considered to have allocated a total of 
p
N  
sub-channels for the sole purpose of transmitting pilots. For 
the sake of simplicity, the system is analysed using a 1-
dimensional pilot pattern in frequency only. As prescribed in 
[6], the system differentiates between PU-to-SU and SU-to-
PU interference for the purposes of optimal power loading. 
A. Power density spectrum of signals 
The transmitted signals in the system model are assumed, 
for the sake of simplicity, to be shaped by a rectangular pulse 
shaping function. The power density spectrum of the 
rectangular pulse shaping function can be represented as [4]

In (1), 
iP  represents the transmit power of the 
thi
 sub-
carrier and 
sT  represents the symbol duration of that same 
sub-carrier. It would serve well to note that the equation is 
only applicable to a rectangular pulse-shaping function and is 
used for simplicity. Other equations may be substituted for 
(1) but the contradiction (and therefore solution) will still 
hold since all non-ideal filters have some form of spectral 
roll-off and therefore present interference to adjacent 
frequency bands. 
B. Interference from PU to SU 
The signals between PU and SU are assumed to be non-
orthogonal and therefore the interference imposed on a SU 
by a PU is effectively ‘smeared’ due to the Fast Fourier 
Transform (FFT) performed by the SU [6]. The expected 
value of the power density spectrum of the PU’s signal after 
an FFT of size M is performed can be described as [6]

 represents the 
width of one sub-channel of the SU (equivalent to the inverse 
of the OFDM symbol duration). 
C. Interference from SU to PU 
The interference from the secondary user to the primary 
user is modelled using simpler mathematics due to the 
assumption that we do not have any information about the 
PU’s modulation scheme and other transmission properties, 
only the bandwidth and signal power.  
The interference caused by spectral roll-off from the SU 
can then be simply modelled as the integration of the power 
density spectrum of the signal, represented as (1) for the 
rectangular pulse shaping filter case. The interference from 
the SU can therefore be modelled as [4]

It should be noted that B  denotes the bandwidth occupied 
by the PU’s signal such that the integration is performed over 
the PU’s bandwidth with an added frequency ‘offset’ 
introduced by the spectral distance between the considered 
sub-channel and the PU’s signal. 
D. Optimal power loading 
The optimal power loading algorithm is specified in [4]. 
It is important to note that the same power loading algorithm 
is derived at the boundary level where the interference to the 
PU is equal to the interference threshold parameter such that 
transmission power is maximized and, consequently, so is 
channel capacity. 
It is noted in [4] that this is indeed the optimal point for 
the power loading algorithm since the channel capacity of a 
sub-channel is proportional to the power loaded to said sub-
channel. The interference equation at the threshold was 
therefore used such that the equation is formulated as

where

 is the power threshold of the interference 
introduced into the primary user’s band by the secondary 
user. 
E. Estimator correlation and Wiener filter MMSE 
One of the ways in which a channel frequency response 
(CFR) can be estimated and interpolated is through the use of 
a Wiener FIR filter [7]. The optimal Wiener filter allows us 
to achieve the MMSE criterion for the channel estimator by 
utilizing statistics about the channel, specifically the 
channel’s auto- and cross-correlation data. 
The frequency cross-correlation between pilot and data 
symbols where a rectangular Doppler spectrum is assumed is 
given as [7], [8]

The auto-correlation function between different pilot 
symbols is also needed to compute the optimal Wiener FIR 
filter coefficients. The auto-correlation function for the pilot 
symbols is given as [7], [8]

For the implementation of the MMSE filter, the

derived as [7]

where   and   represent the cross- and auto-correlation 
matrices respectively. However, since we are dealing with 
the single dimensional estimator (frequency only) the cross- 
and auto-correlation matrices reduce to vectors [7] and 
therefore can be simplified to element-wise multiplication 
and inversion. 
IV. 
OPTIMAL SOLUTION 
In order to obtain the optimal pilot placement, the pilot 
needs to be placed in the sub-channel which allows for the 
lowest MMSE out of the possible sub-channels for pilot 
placement. Given that the MMSE is defined as always 
positive [7] it would mean that the pilot placement needs to 
be found where

is a maximum. It should be noted that, in (9), since the 
estimator is 1-dimensional for these purposes and the filter 
coefficients are strictly real [7], the error vector   is 
obtained without any conjugation and using only element-
wise multiplication and inversion. 
The optimisation problem can therefore be written as

The error function as specified by (9) and (10) is used to 
determine where the optimal placement of the new pilot 
would be. The functions are chosen such as to represent the 
change in MSE relative to the SU’s system without adding a 
new pilot. The MSE change in (10) is evaluated only over 2 
pilot sub-channels, therefore MSE difference is only 
compared to the nearest pilot instead of all pilots. This is due 
to the linear scaling of the MSE difference between a 
localised, 2-pilot model and an evaluation over all pilots and 
so the optimal calculation is done over the nearest, unmoved 
pilot and the proposed positioning of the new pilot. Since the 
SNR expression in (7) represents the average SNR over all 
56

pilots, the term is then adjusted in (10) so that the SNR 
contribution added by the new pilot is divided by a factor of 
two. This allows the error function value to be either positive 
or negative in that a negative error function value would 
represent a decrease in the overall estimation MMSE 
whereas a positive value would represent an overall increase 
in the estimation MMSE. 
The proof to this logical decision is simple in that the 
MMSE of the Wiener filter as demonstrated in (8) depends 
on the auto-correlation of pilot symbols (  ). For a two-
dimensional system, the matrix depends on the nearest pilot 
symbols in both time and frequency but in the one-
dimensional case (be it either time or frequency) the matrix 
becomes a vector and the values are then only dependent on 
the two nearest pilot symbols on either side of the pilot 
symbol concerned. 
It would serve well to note that the function described in 
(10) is transcendental in nature and therefore has no 
algebraic form solution for its derivative. Techniques such as 
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions cannot be used 
to find an equation for the optimal position. The solution, 
therefore, has to be found using enumeration over the 
problem space or through a numerical solution. 
At first thought, it would seem computationally 
expensive to search for the optimal pilot positioning (where 
the MMSE error function is lowest) by brute-force 
enumeration. This is however not the case since the error 
function is bound to a problem space which is single 
dimensional (vector space) and, at most, has a length equal to 
the pilot interval of the original pilot pattern. Another 
advantage is that the pilot auto-correlation values can be pre-
computed and stored after the first iteration for obtaining the 
optimal error function since the pilot symbols are of a known 
sequence. 
V. 
SIMULATION PARAMETERS AND RESULTS 
In order to simulated the system an NC-OFDM cognitive 
radio receiver was simulated using the parameters as 
described in Table 1. It should be noted that the narrowband 
and wideband PU interference parameters are specified as a 
percentage of the PU’s power. 
The system was simulated by averaging the results over 
10000 runs such that a statistically significant sample was 
achieved and an appropriate conclusion could be inferred. 
The system simulated first was that of a wideband system 
where the PU’s spectrum was set to be 20 times the 
bandwidth of a single SU sub-channel. 
It was noted that due to the mathematical formulation of 
the SU-to-PU interference, the width of the PU plays a large 
role in determining the optimal pilot positioning. This is due 
to the summation caused by the integral, effectively meaning 
that PUs with a larger bandwidth are more sensitive to 
interference effects and spectral roll-off introduced by the 
SU. This meant that in implementing the error function and 
obtaining the optimal pilot placement, lower interference 
thresholds could be used for the narrowband case (where the 
PU’s band is assumed to be of the same bandwidth as 1 pilot 
sub-channel).

Figure 1. This figure demonstrates the error function value of a pilot 
sub-channels for all possible placement positions. The model of interference 
from the PU is that of a wideband one where the PU’s bandwidth is 
equivalent to 20 times of that of the SU’s sub-channel bandwidth. 
 
Fig. 1 shows the error function values for possible sub-
channel positions of the pilot sub-channel. The different 
graphs also represent the different interference thresholds in 
Table 1. This is done for the wideband PU case. 
It is noted that in Fig. 1 the optimal pilot position shifts 
farther away from the PU as the interference threshold 
decreases. This can be attributed to the stringency of the 
threshold constraint forcing the pilots to be placed farther 
away due to the needed reduction of spectral roll-off from 
the pilot sub-channels. 
Another interesting observation which can be noted in 
Fig. 1 is that for sub-channels 7 and 8, the error function 
value is almost identical for all 4 interference threshold 
parameter values and it seems to converge to a point. This

can be attributed to the optimal power loading algorithm and 
the finite, maximum transmission power which can be 
loaded per sub-channel. Since the power loading algorithm 
has reached the point where power assigned to the sub-
channel is capped, the whole factor of power loading has 
effectively been removed from the error function’s equation 
and the power at those points assumes a uniform loading 
profile (or a water-filling profile for data sub-channels). This 
means that the error function’s value from sub-channels 7 
and onwards purely depend on the auto-correlation between 
pilot symbols and the cross-correlation between pilot 
symbols and data symbols such that the algorithm becomes 
irrelevant and the values at any further positions need not be 
computed so as to save on computational time.

 Figure 2. This figure represents the error function value for all possible pilot 
sub-channel placement positions for an interference threshold of 1 %. The 
graph is zoomed in for the threshold value from Fig. 1. 
 
Fig. 2 demonstrates the error function value as seen in 
Fig. 1 for 1% interference threshold while zoomed in on the 
graph. The graph shows how the optimal pilot position is at 
sub-channel 6 (5 sub-channels away from the PU where sub-
channel 1 is adjacent to the PU). This graph shows an 
interesting result in that while there is a clear, optimal 
position, the numeric difference in values of the error 
function between the best and second best position is 
relatively small when compared to the rest of the graphs. 
This can be attributed to the low interference threshold 
parameter as defined for the optimal power loading 
algorithm. This means that the pilot sub-channel has a lower 
power assigned to it throughout the possible placement 
positions such that a placing the pilot anywhere in the 
solution space will provide a relatively small decrease in 
MSE. 
In a practical implementation scenario, this phenomenon 
can reach a point where it could be debated as to whether a 
pilot should be added or whether the decrease in MSE is 
negligible compared to the loss in data rate for when the sub-
channel is converted to a pilot-bearing sub-channel. 
In Fig. 3 the system is simulated for the case where a 
narrowband primary user is transmitting. Upon first 
inspection, once can easily notice that the interference 
threshold parameter values are much lower, this is due to the 
decreased bandwidth of the PU which in turn leads to 
integration over a smaller period to compute the interference 
introduced to the PU from the SU. The reduced integration 
period means that for a fixed threshold value, the total sum 
of the interference will be less than the wideband scenario 
due to the smaller area of integration. This means that the 
pilots will tend to be placed farther away the higher the PU’s 
bandwidth is. 
Another observation made from Fig. 3 is the convergence 
to the same error function value occurring from a distance of 
6 sub-channels and greater. This can be attributed to the 
same reason as explained for Fig. 1.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The hypothesis investigated in this paper has shown that 
for the successful implementation of a cognitive radio 
system, the optimal power loading algorithms and optimal 
pilot patterns cannot be implemented independently without 
considering either of them. 
It was found that the sub-channels adjacent to the PU 
cannot simply be converted to pilot sub-channels without 
any consideration to the optimal power loading algorithms. 
An error function was therefore derived which allows for the 
optimal placement of pilots which satisfy interference 
thresholds while achieving the lowest possible MSE. 
The error function was used to compute the optimal pilot 
placement and was simulated accordingly. It was found that 
in many cases it is impractical to place the pilot sub-channel 
adjacent to the PU since the reduction of power required to 
keep interference to the PU below a threshold mandated a 
very low SNR on the pilot symbols, leading to a very noisy 
channel estimate. 
It was also found that the interference threshold 
mandated for the optimal power loading played a big role in 
58

determining the optimal position for the optimal pilot sub-
channel position. It was observed that, trivially, as the 
interference threshold decreased, the pilot sub-channel 
needed to be placed farther away from the PU such that the 
threshold condition still is satisfied. 
An observation also made was that the error function 
value for all thresholds converged due to the maximum 
power which could be allocated per sub-channel due to the 
power loading algorithm. This meant that the error value did 
not need to be computed for sub-channels farther than the 
convergence point.
