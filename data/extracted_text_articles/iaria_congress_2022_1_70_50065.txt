Abstract—Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is one of the
alternatives to monitoring endangered ecosystems. PAM uses
acoustic recordings of monitored sites to understand the dynam-
ics of communities, and landscape transformation, among other
ecological indicators. PAM studies of landscape transformation
have applied machine learning techniques using discrete labels
for transformation states (i.e., high, medium, low). However,
a site does not necessarily belong to a discrete label but can
be between two transformation states. Thus, discretely labeling
a degraded site while ignoring intermediate states is biased.
Due to the natural variability of soundscape, multiple groups
that describe different patterns are a requirement for clustering
recordings that can belong to specific transformations. This paper
proposes an unsupervised methodology based on clustering to
identify the ecological transformation. Our proposal does not use
transformation labels, either selecting the variables or training
the models. This allows to find sites with intermediate states
and associate different clusters to a specific level of ecological
transformation. Similar groups of recordings were found and
linked with ecological transformation using Gaussian Mixture
Models (GMMs) in three periods of the day: morning (5-8), day
(8-17), and night (17-5). We evaluated 13 Clustering Internal Vali-
dation Indices (CIVI) to know which one establishes the number
of clusters associated with ecological transformation. Acoustic
Indices (AIs) operated as variables to provide information on the
acoustic complexity of the sites. We use the Dependence Guided
Unsupervised Feature Selection (DGUFS) method to select the
most relevant AIs. With data collected from 2015 to 2017, we
tested the proposal in a Tropical Dry Forest ecosystem located
in the Bolivar region of northern Colombia. Results showed that
it is possible to identify the ecological transformation with an F1
score of 0.86 using the Scattering Distance (SD) index as CIVI.
In the paper, we evidenced that it is possible to identify the
ecological transformation not limited to known a-priori discrete
labels.

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the emerging ways to complement ecosystem mon-
itoring studies is Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) [1].
PAM involves acoustic soundscape recordings that incorporate
information from geophony (earth-related sounds such as rain
and thunder), biophony (animal sounds), and anthrophony
(human and machine sounds). The acoustic data are used
in Machine learning algorithms taking advantage of the rich
information from soundscape estimating species richness [2],
occupancy models [3], temporal trends of species [4], among
others.
In particular, an emerging field in PAM is the study of
the acoustic signature of ecosystem transformation [1]. The
understanding of ecological transformation can help with con-
servation policies and restoration strategies, especially for en-
dangered ecosystems [5]. Previous studies have demonstrated
the effectiveness of Acoustic Indices (AIs) to determine the
transformation of sites [6] and cover types [7]. So far, PAM
works that have analyzed the transformation [8] and changes in
habitats [9] have used supervised machine learning methods.
Ecological transformation labels used by supervised PAM
methodologies are based on discrete pre-classification of
health states by satellite imagery [5]. These transformation
labels do not take into account community dynamics [10]
and do not consider intra-class variability and the intermediate
states in which sites could be. Then, supervised methodologies
do not let data provide new information on site-specific vari-
ability associated with acoustic community dynamics. Some
PAM methodologies have used clustering to give information
about disturbances [11], geophonic, anthrophonic, biophonic
activities [12], temporal patterns and cover types [5]. However,
no studies have analyzed the soundscape to identify ecological
transformation with unsupervised methodologies. Therefore,
we propose a fully unsupervised methodology to identify
ecological transformation and analyze acoustic gradients in
each site using acoustic patterns.
Given that fine-tuning of parameters (number of clusters)
under an unsupervised approach is a complex task, clustering
validation indices have emerged to evaluate the resulting
partitions [13]. There are two types of criteria in the cluster
validation indices: The external, which compares results with
existing classes (expected labels), and the internal, which
compares results with similarity metrics (no labels usage)
[14]. As in our proposal, we need to find information on

the ecological transformation gradients, we use the Clus-
tering Internal Validation Indices (CIVIs). However, these
indices have drawbacks such as sensitivity to noisy data-
sets or overlapping classes, where each index gives different
results regarding the recommended number of clusters [15].
Moreover, internal validation indices’ performance is context-
dependent [15], which implies that evaluations should be
conducted at each application to select the index with the best
performance. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, all clustering
PAM studies have only considered one cluster validity index,
and they did not implement an evaluation to select the adequate
validity index for the particular study case. We integrate into
our proposal an unsupervised feature selection of AIs, and
an evaluation of 13 CIVIs to determine partitions that give
complementary information to the ecological transformation
models. Therefore, we propose a fully unsupervised automatic
methodology to analyze the acoustic patterns related to eco-
logical transformation gradients in a tropical dry forest.
The structure of the article is as follows. In Section II , we
describe the proposed methodology and the used data. Results
are given in Section III, and discussed in Section IV. Finally,
conclusions are drawn in Section V.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Study site
The data used in this work were provided by the Alexander
Von Humbold Institute. The acoustic recordings were acquired
from 2015 to 2017 in the Colombian Caribbean region, in the
department of Bolivar through a Global Environment Facility
(GEF) project. The study sites correspond to a tropical dry for-
est ecosystem, which is an ecosystem distributed below 1000
m.a.s.l. highly seasonal in its rainfall with dry periods of at
least three months. In the locality of Arroyo Grande (Bolivar),
twelve sites were sampled along a landscape transformation
gradient for over 1 week to reach a total of 2476 recordings.
The recordings were obtained using Wildlife Acoustics’ SM2
and SM3 recorders which were programmed to record 5-min
every 10 minutes during 5 continuous days and stopping to
record 5 days periodically. Prior to field campaigns and after
a landscape transformation analysis was conducted, each site
was classified as high, medium and low transformation. High
transformation are sites with a low proportion of retained
forest and high proportion of lost forest between 2000 and
2016.Low transformation are sites with a high proportion of
retained forest and a low proportion of lost forest. The medium
transformation are sites between theses two extremes. These
labels were used to compare results of unsupervised algorithms
and internal validation indices through the external validation
index F1 score (explained in Table III).
B. Unsupervised methodology for transformation identifica-
tion
For the unsupervised identification of ecological transfor-
mation, we propose the methodology presented in Figure 1.
Our methodology follow these steps: First, calculate the AIs
and select the most representative indices through the DGUFS
method explained in section II-B2. With the selected AIs, train
a GMM for each day period varying the number of clusters
(see subsection II-B3). We tested 13 CIVIs (see Table I) to set
the number of clusters. We found that the CIVI SD gives more
information related to ecological transformation (see section
III). We explain each step in the next subsections:
Fig. 1.
Automatic unsupervised identification of ecological transformation
through acoustic recordings Methodology.
1) Soundscape metrics : Acoustic Indices (AIs) are mathe-
matical functions designed to estimate the acoustic complexity
from communities to soundscapes. As equivalent to biodi-
versity indices in ecology, acoustic indices are indices that
emphasize diversity of acoustic elements (similar to species)
in a community (alpha (α) diversity), or indices that emphasize
the similarity between two areas in terms of shared acoustic
elements (beta (β) diversity ) [16].
In this work, we focused on the α AIs to characterize the
sound of each study site. We used the most popular AIs:
Acoustic Complexity Index (frequency- time): ’ACIft’ [17],
Acoustic Diversity Index: ’ADI’ [18], Acoustic Complexity
Index (time- frequency): ’ACItf’ [17], Bioacoustic index:’B’
[19], Temporal Entropy: ’TE’ [16], Entropy of spectral max-
ima: ’ESM’ [20], Normalized Difference Soundscape Index:
’NDSI’ [21], Ratio of biophony to anthrophony: ’P’ [22], Me-
dian of amplitude envelope: ’M’ [23], Number of peaks: ’NP’
[23], Mid-band activity: ’MID’ [20], Frequency Background
Noise: ’BNF’ [24], Temporal Background Noise: ’BNT’ [24],
Musicality Degree: ’MD’ [25], Frequency Modulation: ’FM’
[26], Spectral Flatness ’SF’, Root Mean Square ’RMS’, Crest
Factor ’CF’, Spectral Centroid ’SC’, Spectral Bandwith ’SB’,
’Tonnets’, Signal Noise Ratio ’SNR’ [27]. Also, we calculate
the ADI index in each of the 1-11 frequency bands. These
indices measure characteristics of the audios related to acoustic
complexity. All these AIs were implemented in a user interface
application available in [28] . Some of these indices have been
used to classify in a supervised way sites by ecological trans-
formation [6], cover types [7], quantify ecosystem changes
over time [29] and study the ecological integrity [30].
The behaviors of the soundscape could vary in the hours
of the day. Sanchez [30] showed that the relationship between
AIs and ecological integrity can vary between different periods

of the day. Rendon Hurtado [31] proposed three periods with
different patterns of the sound: morning (5-8), day (8-17) and
night (17-5). We used these periods to create three clustering
models, one for each period.
2) Unsupervised feature selection method: Usually, feature
selection in PAM studies has been done based on expert
knowledge [29], [30], [32]. However, there are feature se-
lection methods such as the wrapper methods that do not
use the data labels. Wrapper methods help to improve the
quality of clustering algorithms results based on unsupervised
criteria [33]. The Dependence Guided Unsupervised Feature
Selection (DGUFS) [34] is a wrapper method that enhances
the interdependence among original data, cluster labels and
selected features using the L2 norm [34]. In this work, we use
the DGUFS to select the most informative AIs. As a result,
we obtain an x vector with the selected features.
3) Unsupervised transformation level model: To determine
the transformation level of a site, we use the Gaussian Mixture
Models (GMM) algorithm in an unsupervised way. As input
features for the clustering, we use the selected AIs. GMM
establishes a P(x) distribution of nc clusters for the x feature
vector;
P(x) =

(1)
where µGi and Σi are GMM mean and covariance matrices
of the data, respectively. The data is the matrix containing all
estimated vector AIs for all training audios. D is the number
of features (i.e., number of selected AIs). The algorithm
parameters are denoted as λ = (µGi, Σi). To determine
these parameters, we used the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm refining the parameters using the log-likelihood in
the data distribution. One of the characteristics of the GMM is
that it requires the number of clusters. If we choose a number
of clusters larger than the number of original transformation
labels, then several clusters could belong to one transformation
state (i.e. high, medium, low) providing information on intra-
transformation patterns. We determine the number of clusters
evaluating 13 CIVIs presented in the sub-section II-B4. The
F1 score results were used as a benchmark to compare the
unsupervised approach using CIVIs. We also tested other
clustering algorithms (K-means, Gkmeans, DBscan, Fuzzy-
Cmeans, Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model
emissions (GMMHMM)) to contrast the results.
4) Cluster validation indices (CVIs): The task of finding
clusters using unsupervised algorithms depends on the relative
nature of the data [15]. CIVIs are proposed to select the
best clustering according to a specific criteria [13]. However,
CIVIs have certain drawbacks such as low performance due to
noise and outliers in data [13], validating the clustering result
for large data-sets involves a high computational cost [35],
lack of stability and sensitivity to data-set size, and a number
of features [14]. Furthermore, different clustering validation
indices often recommend different partitions for the same data-
set (with a different number of clusters) [36]. Performing
comparisons between cluster validation indices would increase
the robustness of the application using unsupervised learning.
CIVIs are useful to compare solutions up to a limit that
depends on the nature of the data. Therefore, the best solution
must be found, according to each application. Comparing sev-
eral CIVIs is relevant because each index can give information
about clusters with different soundscape properties. Then, as
we searched for partitions related to ecological transformation,
we included a comparison of 13 CIVIs. We compared the
behaviors of the CIVI presented in Table I with the external
validation index F1, also presented in the table.
III. RESULTS
The 35 AIs mentioned above were calculated for each
recording and standardized (0 to 1 values). We obtain the
following AIs using the DGUFS method: ’ACIft’, ’ACItf’,
’BETA’, ’NDSI’, ’P’, ’M’, ’NP’, ’MID’, ’BNF’, ’MD’, ’FM’,
’SF’, ’RMS’, ’ SC’, ’Tonnets’. Six clustering algorithms were
tested by performing a grid search by tuning each algorithm
with a different number of clusters (grid search from 2 to
80 clusters). Table II presents a comparison of clustering
algorithms using the F1 score. The results show that GMM has
the best performance for transformation identification. Then,
we selected GMM as the proposed clustering algorithm in our
methodology.

These results show that it is not enough to have only three
discrete categories (high, medium, low). A large number of
clusters is required to identify the transformation. Since our
objective was the automatic and unsupervised identification of
ecological transformation, we estimated the CIVIs explained in
Table I, with the clustering obtained varying the number of the
cluster in each GMM model. Table III shows the recommended
number of clusters of the CIVIs in each day period.

We expected three groups representing the three transfor-
mation labels. However, the partitions found with a number
of clusters of 3 did not correspond to the ecological transfor-
mation (see Calinksy index performance in Figure 3).
IV. DISCUSSION
In this work, it was proved that it is possible to build
GMM models to identify the tropical dry forest transformation
in a completely unsupervised way. Our proposal includes
automatic feature selection and a selection of adequate par-
titions. Our proposal was tested in the Bolivar region in
northern Colombia. Figure 3 presents a comparison of the best
performance clustering validation indices.
The Calinksy index suggests a lower number of clusters in
each period (morning:2, day:3, night:3). These are the number
of labels of previously categorized transformations. The low
Fig. 3. F1 score using CIVIs: SD index, Xie Beni index, F1 score stabilization,
and Calinksy. In each approach the parenthesis show the number of the
recommended clusters for each day period
performance of Calinksy index (max F1=0.47) shows that
there exist acoustic nuances that describe more variability than
the preliminary discrete categories of the transformation.
Only the Xie Beni index and SD index recommended a
number of clusters that correspond to ecological transforma-
tion using as a metric the external F1 score (F1<0.75). The
Xie Beni index suggests 79 clusters for the morning model, 74
for the day model, and 79 for the night period. These number
of clusters permit to identify the ecological transformation
with a high f1 score (see Figure 3). The behavior of the Xie
Beni index (see Figure 4) establishes that the adequate cluster
number corresponds to the minimum value (0 in this case).
Then, we tested the behavior of the index with different limits:
30, 80, and 200, obtaining the number of clusters 29, 79,
and 197, respectively for each threshold. The Xie Beni value
decreases when the number of clusters increases. These results
suggest that Xie Beni values tend to grow when the number
of clusters grows without reaching stabilization. This problem
had already been mentioned in the literature by Rita de Franco
et al. [42] and Singh et al. [43], who made a modification
of the index. However, these CIVIs were proposed for fuzzy
clustering algorithms. For this reason, we do not use them in
our study.
The SD recommends cluster numbers 61, 62, and 44, which
are much closer to the external performance stabilization (F1
score stabilization in Figure 2). Thus, using the unsupervised
Gaussian mixtures approach and with the use of the SD,

it is possible to identify the ecological transformation of
ecosystems through sound.
In order to identify the meaning of the intermediate clusters
not included in the discrete labels, the behavior of AIs means
in some found clusters are shown in Figure 5.
Fig. 5.
AIs mean in different clusters that represents different ecological
transformation levels. Clusters 13, 3, 36 and 50 represents high, high-medium,
medium-low, and low transformation levels, respectively
Analyzing acoustic indices using machine learning tech-
niques increases results interpretation regarding ecological
aspects which cannot be achieved with other techniques such
as deep learning. For example, in Figure 5, it is evident
that the NP index increases as the transformation decreases.
This behavior was expected since this index is related to the
biodiversity of a site. On the other hand, the graph shows
intermediate clusters (high-medium and medium-low transfor-
mation), which would not have been found using a supervised
approach. These clusters show AIs with intermediate values
between high and low transformation.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper shows a methodology to identify tropical dry for-
est transformation in a completely unsupervised way. Having
an unsupervised approach allows not only to have an adequate
identification of 3 discrete states (high, medium, low) but also
to find intermediate states. Results show that it is possible
to determine the ecological transformation by sound in an
unsupervised manner in a tropical dry forest. In addition, in
the field of clustering validation, more work should be done
on the task of finding CIVIs specially designed for this type
of application.
