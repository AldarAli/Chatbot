Abstract—Although many studies in neuroimaging showed 
that semantic tasks activated the left ventral inferior frontal 
gyrus (LvIFG), whether there is the functional segregation of 
LvIFG in the semantic memory and semantic processing 
remains unclear. In order to determine neural differences of 
semantic memory and processing in LvIFG with functional 
MRI, thirty-six subjects performed reading tasks on triplets of 
either text or figure or text-figure. The text/figure/figure+text 
tasks activated two common areas located in an anterior 
portion of LvIFG and a posterior portion of LvIFG. The 
BOLD signal change of the posterior portion of LvIFG has 
semantic working memory characteristics because semantic 
repetition priming and the BOLD signal change of anterior 
portion of LvIFG has information processing characteristics. 
The results suggest that the posterior portion of LvIFG 
unrelated to information forms is for semantic memory, 
whereas the anterior portion of LvIFG related to information 
forms is for semantic processing.

INTRODUCTION 
Since the findings of Petersen et al. with Positron 
emission tomographic (PET) suggested that the left inferior 
frontal gyrus (LIFG) was identified in processing for 
semantic association [1], many researchers have focused on 
the study of the LIFG in neuroimaging. These functional 
neuroimaging studies have implied that the LIFG is involved 
in semantic processing, such as semantic 
 [1-6], 
the control of semantic retrieval [4,7], and the selection of 
semantic information [8]. Moreover, this region is also 
related to the processing nonverbal tasks such as object 
naming [2,9] 
judgement
and unfamiliar faces recognition [10]. 
Further studies showed that the LIFG was separated into 
two functional areas, including the dorsal (near the inferior 
frontal sulcus involving BA44/45) and ventral parts 
(BA45/47), and  the posterior and dorsal aspect of the left 
IFG related to phonological processing and the anterior and 
ventral aspect involved selectively in semantic processing 
[11-13]. For example, phonetic relative to pitch judgments 
for auditorily presented syllables activates BA44/6 and 
BA44/45 [14,15]. Similarly, BA45 is more significantly 
activated for phonemic orthographic decisions in the visual 
domain [16]. By contrast, the anterior and ventral LIFG 
appears to be involved in semantic processing. Kapur et al. 
[17] demonstrated that semantic-related activity in BA45/47, 
while others found such activity in the mid-ventrolateral 
frontal cortex (BA47) [18]. Additionally, most previous 
studies reported that the LIFG was also activated during the 
sentence comprehension [19-23]. The cognitive process at 
the sentence level is not only the semantic processing of 
words alone, but also refers to syntactic processing [19, 20], 
semantic working memory [21], and the integration of world 
knowledge [22,23]. Peter et al using ERP and FMRI 
demonstrated that the LIFG (BA45/47) is involved in the 
integration of both word meaning and world knowledge 
during reading a sentence, and the brain retrieves and 
integrates them at the same time [22].  
Besides the LIFG (BA45/47) is directly related to 
semantic processing of words, the similar area is decreased 
activation during repeated semantic processing of those 
same words (namely semantic priming) [4][24-26]. Gabrieli 
et al. found that, when making semantic decisions about 
words, the repeated semantic processing is decreased 
activation in LIFG relative to initial semantic processing. 
This decrease in activation represents a semantic repetition 
priming effect that occurs under implicit test instruction [25]. 
Further, such repetition-induced decreases in LIFG 
activation appear specific to semantic processing: Repeated 
nonsemantic processing of words does not reduce LIFG 
activation [4]. Another study about the semantic repetition 
priming examined the stimulus generality of LIFG function 
during repeated relative to initial semantic processing of

words and of pictures. Their results suggested that the LIFG 
area (approximately to BA45/47 posteriorly) is decreased 
activation with repetition regardless of perceptual form [26].   
Taken together, the left ventral inferior frontal gyrus 
(LvIFG) is a crucial area for semantic processing regardless 
of the verbal and nonverbal stimuli, and this region is also 
activated in the retrieval from semantic memory that terms 
semantic memory for short. Semantic processing and 
semantic memory are two different cognitive processes. It 
seems that these different processes are subserved by the 
individual subregions of LvIFG, however, whether the 
functional segregation of LvIFG in the semantic memory 
and semantic processing remains unclear. In order to 
determine neural differences of semantic memory and 
processing in LvIFG, the experimental materials were 
designed as the reading tasks on triplets of either text or 
figure or text-figure, which can describe the same 
information or content. Figure 1 gives an example of textual 
and figure tasks used in the experiment. These complex 
reading tasks involve many cognitive processes such as 
semantic processing of words, phrases or graph and using 
world knowledge to construct the whole meaning, and also 
requires to repeated retrieval of semantic knowledge to 
comprehend the whole meaning. Based on the above 
previous studies, we hypothesized that (1) the LvIFG related 
to semantic memory and processing would be commonly 
activated by the three present form (text, figure and 
figure+text) tasks; (2)there would be distinct subregions 
activated in semantic processing and semantic memory: the 
subregion of the LvIFG related to semantic processing 
would be increased activated, which showed the semantic 
processing characteristics; whereas the subregion of the 
LvIFG related to semantic memory would be decreased 
activated, which showed the semantic executive function 
characteristics.

METHODS 
A. Subjects 
Thirty-six volunteers (eighteen female and eighteen male; 
mean age ± standard deviation (S.D.) = 22.5 ± 1.7) 
participated in this study. All of the subjects were right-
handed and native-Chinese speaking. The subjects had no 
history of neurological or psychiatric illness, and no 
developmental disorders, including reading disablities. All 
of the participants gave their written informed consent, and 
the protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of 
Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University and. the 
institutional Review Board of the Beijing University of 
Technology. 
B. Materials and Procedure 
In the experiment, 20 text, figure and figure+text stimuli, 
as well as 8 text-baseline, figure-baseline and (figure+text)-
baseline stimuli were used. Each text stimulus was 
presented for a period of 16 seconds, the figure was 
presented for 14s, and the figure+text was presented for 18s; 
all the baseline tasks were presented for 8s. The 
presentation time was set according to the behavioral 
experiment, in which participants can fully understand the 
information of text or figure presented to them. The text, 
figure and figure+text tasks describing the same event were 
counterbalanced across subjects; no individual read the 
same event twice [27]. 
The experiment consists of 4 sessions. The order of the 
text, figure and figure+text stimuli was pseudo-randomized 
in each session. All stimuli were presented on a blank 
background screen. The participants were instructed to read 
text, figure or figure+text information attentively. After a 
stimulus task disappeared, a question including two options 
was presented, then the subjects could press the selected 
buttons (left button refers to the first option; right button 
refers to the second option). The subjects were limited to 
answer the question during a period of 8s, and then the 
following rest task was presented for 6s. Four sessions were 
collected per each participant. The images for the initial 10s 
were discarded because of unsteady magnetization; the 
remaining images in the session were used in the analysis.

C. Image acquisition 
In each subject, functional (T2* weighted) images, 
followed by an anatomical (T1 weighted) image, were 
acquired with a Siemens 3-T Trio scanner (Trio system; 
Siemens 
Magnetom 
scanner, 
Erlangen, 
Germany). 
Functional images consisted of echo-planar image volumes 
which were sensitive to BOLD contrast in axial orientation

(TR = 2000 ms, TE = 31ms, flip angle = 90°). Prior to each 
run, the first two (10 s) discarded volumes were acquired to 
allow stabilization of magnetization. The volume covered 
the whole brain with a 64 × 64 matrix and 30 slices (voxel 
size = 4 mm× 4 mm× 4 mm, slice thickness = 4 mm, gap = 
0.8 mm).  
D. Data analysis 
Functional data was analyzed with statistical parametric 
mapping (SPM 2, Welcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, 
London, UK) implemented in Matlab 7.0 (Mathworks, 
Sherborne, MA, USA). The functional images of each 
participant were corrected for slice timing, and all volumes 
were spatially realigned to the first volume (the head 
movement was < 2 millimeters (mm) in all cases). A mean 
image created from the realigned volumes was coregistered 
with the structural T1 volume and the structural volumes 
spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute 
(MNI) EPI temple using nonlinear basis functions. Images 
were resampled into 2-mm cubic voxels and then spatially 
smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width at half-
maximum (FWHM). The stimulus onsets of the trials for 
each condition were convolved with the canonical form of 
the hemodynamic response function (HRF) as defined in 
SPM 2. Statistical inferences were drawn on the basis of the 
general linear model as it is implemented in SPM 2. Linear 
contrasts were calculated for the comparisons between 
conditions. The contrast images were then entered into a 
second level analysis (random effects model) to extend 
statistical inference about activity differences to the 
population from which the participants were drawn. 
Activations are reported for clusters of 10 contiguous voxels 
(80 mm3) that surpassed a corrected threshold of p < .05 on 
cluster level. The coordinates given by SPM 2 were 
corrected to correspond to the atlas of Talairach and 
Tournoux (1988). 
III. 
RESULTS 
As shown in Figure 2 (a)-(d) and Table 1, we did the 
conjunction analysis of text, figure and figure+text, and the 
conjunction between them. All the results consistently 
showed that two distinct segregated areas were more 
significantly activated in the left ventral inferior frontal 
cortex involving an anterior portion (Talairach: -30, 30, -13, 
BA47/11) and a posterior portion (Talairach: -28, 13, -16, 
BA47) by text, figure and figure+text. The BOLD signal 
change percentages at the anterior portion of LvIFG showed 
the increased activation that has semantic processing 
characteristics, which suggests that the anterior portion of 
LvIFG is more related to semantic processing. In contrast, 
the BOLD signal change percentages at the posterior 
portion of LvIFG showed the decreased activation that has 
the semantic executive function characteristics because 
semantic repetition priming, which suggests that the 
posterior portion of LvIFG is more involved in semantic 
memory.  
In addition, we also did the conjunction of tasks and rest 
(text and rest, figure and rest, figure+text and rest, and text, 
figure, figure+text and rest), as shown in Figure 2 (e)-(h) 
and table1. The results showed that only the posterior 
portion of LvIFG (Talairach: -30, 10, -14, BA47) was more 
significantly activated during resting state, whereas the 
anterior portion of LvIFG was not activated. The BOLD 
signal change percentages at the posterior portion of LvIFG 
also showed the decreased activation.  
Therefore, these results suggest that the semantic 
processing and semantic memory are dissociated in LvIFG, 
which means that the anterior portion of LvIFG is more 
involved in semantic processing, whereas the posterior of 
LvIFG is more involved in semantic memory.

DISSCUSSION 
The goal of the present study was to examine the neural 
mechanism of the LvIFG related to semantic processing and 
semantic memory during reading comprehension of text, 
figure and figure+text. The three type tasks commonly 
activated the LvIFG involving an anterior portion and a 
posterior portion.  The increase in BOLD signal of anterior 
portion showed the semantic processing characteristics, 
whereas the decrease in BOLD signal of posterior portion 
showed the semantic memory characteristics. In order to 
further verify this result, we also do the further analysis 
about the conjunction between task and rest. If the posterior 
portion of LvIFG was related to the semantic memory, there 
would be only this region activated during rest state, and the 
BOLD signal of this region would be negative. Consistent 
with this hypothesis, the results of conjunction between task 
and rest showed that only the posterior portion of LvIFG 
was decreased activated and the BOLD signal was indeed 
decreased, whereas the anterior portion was not activated. 
Thus, the present findings reveal dissociation between 
semantic processing and semantic memory within the 
LvIFG.

A. Anterior portion of the LvIFG and semantic processing 
This study showed that the activation of the anterior 
portion of the LvIFG was more related to the semantic 
processing regardless of text, figure and figure+text. Many 
previous neuroimaging studies using Positron emission 
tomographic 
(PET) 
and 
fMRI 
have 
consistently 
demonstrated that the anterior extent of the LIFG, 
corresponding to BA45/47, plays a crucial role in semantic 
processing of verbal and nonverbal tasks [1-10]. Petersen et 
al. (1988) with PET firstly reported that the left inferior 
frontal gyrus (LIFG) was identified in processing for 
semantic association [1]. Other functional neuroimaging 
studies have implicated that the LIFG is involved in 
semantic processing, such as semantic judgement [1-6], the 
control of semantic retrieval [4,7], and the selection of 
semantic information [8]. Moreover, this region is also 
related to the processing the nonverbal [9, 10]. Further 
studies that the LIFG was separated into two functional 
areas, including the dorsal (near the inferior frontal sulcus 
involving BA44/45) and ventral parts (BA45/47), and  the 
posterior and dorsal aspect of the left IFG related to 
phonological processing and the anterior and ventral aspect 
involved selectively in semantic processing [11-13]. 
Additionally, 
many 
prior 
studies 
about 
sentence 
comprehension were also found the activation in LIPG [19-
24]. The cognitive process at the sentence level is not only 
the semantic processing of words alone, but also refers to 
syntactic processing [19, 20], semantic working memory 
[21], and the integration of world knowledge [22,23]. 
Furthermore, the higher level about the discourse 
comprehension also found that the LIPG is activated 
[27,28]. 
In our study, subjects were instructed to read and 
comprehend the information presented by the text, figure or 
figure+text, which involves many cognitive processes such 
as semantic processing of words, phrases or graph and 
using world knowledge to construct the whole meaning. 
Thus, our finding suggests that the activation in the anterior 
portion of LvIFG contributes to the semantic processing 
and the integration of semantic and world knowledge.  
B. Posterior portion of the LvIFG and semantic  memory 
In the present study, the posterior portion of the LvIFG 
(BA47) was decreased activated by the conjunction of task 
and task, and the conjunction of task and rest, suggesting 
this region might be more closely related to the semantic 
memory. This is consistent with previous studies [4][24-26]. 
Gabrieli et al. found that, when making semantic decisions 
about words, the repeated semantic processing is decreased 
activation in LIPG relative to initial semantic processing. 
This decrease in activation represents a semantic repetition 
priming effect that occurs under implicit test instruction 
[25]. Further, such repetition-induced decreases in LIPG 
activation appear specific to semantic processing: Repeated 
nonsemantic processing of words does not reduce LIPG 
activation [4]. Another study about the semantic repetition 
priming examined the stimulus generality of LIPG function 
during repeated relative to initial semantic processing of 
words and of pictures. Their results suggested that the LIPG 
area (approximately to BA45/47 posteriorly) is decreased 
activation with repetition regardless of perceptual form [26]. 
Semantic memory refers to persons’ general world 
knowledge [29,30], involving a wide range of information 
including facts, concepts and vocabulary [31]. Retrieval 
from semantic memory occurs during performance many 
cognitive tasks such as reading and making semantic 
decision. Other studies about the sentence comprehension 
have also reported that the LvIFG is activated and this 
region might be involved in verbal working memory during 
on-line sentence comprehension [20, 32]. In our study, the 
complex reading tasks require to repeated retrieval of 
semantic knowledge to comprehend the whole meaning. 
Together with the results during rest state, therefore, this 
study suggests that the decreased activation of the posterior 
portion of the LvIFG was more involved in semantic 
memory.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In summary, this study investigated whether the 
functional segregation of LvIFG in the semantic processing 
and semantic memory. The present findings indicated that 
distinct subregions in the LvIFG support the functional 
segregation of semantic processing and semantic memory.  
Our results suggest that the anterior portion of the LvIFG is 
more related to semantic processing, whereas the posterior 
portion of the LvIFG is more related to semantic memory. 
We look forward to future studies that further detail these 
complementary functions and the cooperative work 
between the anterior and posterior LvIFG play in the 
reading comprehension.
