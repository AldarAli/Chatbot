Abstract—Underwater wireless communications pose challenges
due to the characteristics of water as a propagation channel
medium. Regardless, it is needed for a range of systems that
operate underwater. Commonly used technologies for these use
cases (radio-frequency, acoustic and optical communications)
are lacking, as they usually suffer from strong attenuation,
multipath and propagation delays. In this context, we explore
Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) systems underwater and
the feasibility of their application. This paper aims to discuss the
theoretical transmission models for RFID systems underwater,
separating them into near-ﬁeld systems – which use Magnetic
Induction (MI) to communicate – and far-ﬁeld systems – that
transfer data via Radio Frequency (RF). We determine the path
loss for each case, explore its value for different system conﬁgu-
rations and present preliminary measurements of magnetic ﬁeld
strength.

INTRODUCTION
Underwater wireless communications present some chal-
lenges due to the channel medium. The underwater environ-
ment has different characteristics and phenomena compared
to the terrestrial radio propagation channel [1]. Despite these
difﬁculties, underwater wireless communications are needed
for underwater systems. Practical applications include seis-
mic activity monitoring, equipment monitoring and control,
underwater wireless sensor networks, underwater robots and
Underwater Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs), aquaculture and
underwater environment monitoring [2][3].
There are three commonly used technologies for under-
water communications [1][4][5]. Radio-frequency (RF) com-
munication consists of propagating electromagnetic waves,
and it has high data rates at short ranges but suffers from
multipath propagation, strong attenuation and Doppler effect
[1]. Due to the increasing attenuation for higher frequencies,
it requires that systems operate at lower frequencies for longer
ranges, which demands large antennas. Acoustic communica-
tion makes use of propagating sound waves, which have low
attenuation underwater, achieving the longest range. However,
this type of communication exhibits high propagation delay
due to the speed of sound underwater, suffers from multipath
propagation, and is affected by a large delay spread that
leads to intersymbol interference. Temperature gradients and
ambient noise are also problems for acoustic communications.
Another technology is optical communication, that leverages
electromagnetic waves in the visible spectrum to transmit
data. They have large data rates with low propagation delay.
However, they suffer severe absorption in water and strong
backscatter due to suspended particles.
Underwater Radio-Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) is not
an extensively explored topic due to the problems outlined
above. However, some RFID systems communicate via Mag-
netic Induction (MI), which could provide an alternative for
the existing technologies. In this paper, we want to explore
this possibility. We examine the different methods of commu-
nication that different RFID systems employ, separating them
into two categories: near-ﬁeld communication and far-ﬁeld
communication. Theoretical mathematical models exist for
terrestrial RFID systems, from which the system functionality,
communication properties and link budged can be derived.
This paper aims to derive similar models for underwater
RFID communications, by describing the underwater channel
physical properties for near-ﬁeld and far-ﬁeld electromagnetic
ﬁelds by presenting the path loss for each. This can then be
used to predict communication range, link budget and channel
capacity.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II discusses the
related work. In Section III, we give a brief overview of an
RFID system and its components. Section IV then presents
the model for underwater RFID for near-ﬁeld and far-ﬁeld
communications. In Section V, we present preliminary results
of measurements done of magnetic ﬁeld strength in free-
space and freshwater. Section VI discusses underwater RFID
in light of the theory presented and the measurement results.
We conclude the paper in Section VII.

RELATED WORK
Underwater RFID is not a common topic due to the
challenges that the underwater environment poses to RF com-
munications. However, some preliminary work has been done.
For example, [6] explores the use of Near-Field Communica-
tion (NFC) underwater. Using smartphones and smart cards
operating at 13.56 MHz, they tested the read range achieved
and the inﬂuence of dissolved salts in water in the read
range. Another group used Low-Frequency (LF) RFID to track
the sediment movements in a beach [7]. Transponders were
coupled to pebbles, creating "smart" pebbles that could be
detected at up to 50 cm underwater. They were then released
into the beach and tracked to map the sediment movement.
Systems that use LF RFID underwater can be found in Passive
Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags used to uniquely identify
ﬁsh in ﬁsheries and research [8][9].

ing of underwater RFID, examining the penetration depth

in freshwater and seawater. However, the model presented
is simpliﬁed and accounts only for the far-ﬁeld operation.
They also showcase other uses of RFID underwater, such as
underwater pipeline monitoring. Other authors have explored
MI communications underwater, where the system communi-
cates via induction coupling. [11] provides an overview of the
current research ﬁndings and challenges for MI. Models for
MI can be found in [12]–[16].

RFID SYSTEM
RFID uses electromagnetic ﬁelds to identify, track and
communicate with electronic data carrying devices (usually
called tags) [17]. An RFID system is comprised of a transpon-
der or tag that is the object to be identiﬁed and a reader that
reads/writes data from/to the transponder. The tag consists of a
coupling element (antenna or coil) and a microchip that stores
the data, while the reader has an antenna, a control unit and a
radio frequency module.
For data transfer, the reader generates an electromagnetic
ﬁeld to query any transponders in its range. The tag re-
ceives the signal via its coupling element, and the energy
captured from the electromagnetic ﬁeld is used to power up
the transponder’s chip. This chip then sends back the data to
the reader via load modulation or backscatter. In general, the
transponder is passive (does not contain a power source), and
it is powered by the ﬁeld generated by the reader. There are
also semi-active and active devices that have power sources
that can power up additional circuitry and extend the range of
communication.

RFID CHANNEL PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
The antenna or coil of the RFID reader generates an
electromagnetic ﬁeld. These ﬁelds can be described as time-
harmonic ﬁelds in a lossy medium [18]:
∇2E = γE
(1)
∇2H = γH
(2)
where γ is the propagation constant, with α as the at-
tenuation and β as the phase constants. The wavelength λ is
λ = 2π/β.

The dielectric permittivity of the medium ε is further
deﬁned by ε = εrε0, ε0 = 8.854 · 10−12F/m being the
permittivity in air and εr the relative permittivity of the
medium (also known as dielectric constant) that is 81 for water.
µ = µ0 = 4π · 10−7H/m is the magnetic permeability of the
medium, that does not change for non-magnetic media.
The salinity of the water is proportional to the concen-
tration of dissolved salts (chloride, sodium, sulphate, etc.).
The conductivity σ is dependent on temperature, pressure and
salinity. In marine water, the conductivity ranges from 2 S/m
to 6 S/m, being considered constant 4 S/m in most cases [10].
In freshwater, the considerations are the same. However, the
salinity is lower, which means that the conductivity is lower
(typically ranging from 30 to 2000 µS/cm) [10]. Due to this
high conductivity, Eddy currents are induced within the water,
caused by the propagating magnetic ﬁeld. These Eddy currents
are a source of attenuation of the magnetic ﬁeld.
For the Transverse Electromagnetic Mode to the positive z
direction in lossy medium (in this case, water), E and H can
be derived as [18]:
E(z) = ˆaxE0e−γz
(6)
H(z) = ˆay

jωµE0e−γz
(7)
For a given antenna, the space that surrounds it can be
separated into three regions: (a) a reactive near-ﬁeld, (b) a
radiating near-ﬁeld and (c) the far-ﬁeld. There are no abrupt
changes at their boundaries [19]. A representation of these
regions can be seen in Figure 1.

Field regions.
The Reactive Near-Field is the space immediately near the
antenna where the reactive ﬁeld predominates (magnetic ﬁeld).
For most antennas, the limit of this region is at 0.62
p
D3/λ
[19], where D is the biggest dimension of the antenna. The
Radiating Near-Field is located between the reactive near-ﬁeld
and the far-ﬁeld and is the space wherein radiation ﬁelds are
dominant. The angular ﬁeld distribution is determined by the
distance from the antenna. This ﬁeld existence depends on
the ratio between antenna size D and the wavelength λ: if
D/λ ≪ 1 then this region does not exist. The Far-Field is the
region wherein the electrical and magnetic components of the
ﬁeld become orthogonal to each other as they separate from
the antenna and propagate as an electromagnetic wave. The
lower boundary of this region is located at 2D2/λ for any
antenna [18], also considered to be λ/2π for dipole antennas.
According to [17], a good rule of thumb for RFID systems is
to place the beginning of the far-ﬁeld at λ/2π.
The ﬁeld boundary distance is different for each medium
due to the difference in wavelength. Tables I and II show the
values for the attenuation coefﬁcient, wavelength and far-ﬁeld
boundary for freshwater and seawater respectively.
Current RFID systems can be separated into two categories:
near-ﬁeld systems that work with inductive coupling due to
the dominance of the magnetic ﬁeld in the near-region, and
far-ﬁeld systems that receive power from the propagating

electromagnetic waves in the far-ﬁeld [20]. The frequencies
used in each region are different. Since the lower frequencies
– such as Low Frequency (LF) at around 134.2kHz and High
Frequency (HF) at 13.56MHz – have a far-ﬁeld boundary that
is further away, they are mainly used in inductive coupling
systems. Higher frequencies are then used mostly in far-ﬁeld
systems.
A. Near-ﬁeld
In the near-ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬁeld created by the reader’s
antenna induces a voltage in the transponder immersed in
this ﬁeld. This is called inductive coupling and the interaction
between reader and transponder can be considered as coupled
inductors. This method of communication can also be called
Magnetic Induction (MI).

Consider the equivalent circuit for the inductively coupled
system shown in Figure 2. The transmitter antenna is fed
by a source with internal impedance ZS and the receiver
antenna is terminated by a load impedance ZL. The transmitter
coil antenna has a impedance of ZT X = RT X + jωLT X +
1/(jωCT X) and the receiver coil antenna is ZRX = RRX +
jωLRX + 1/(jωCRX).

sidering an ideal source for VS, Z11 = ZT X and Z22 = ZRX
are the self-impedances of the coils and Z12 = Z21 = jωM
are the mutual impedances due to the coupling.

The resistance of a coil is R = N · 2πa · R0, where N is
the number of turns of the coil, a is the diameter of the coil
and R0 is the resistance of a unit of length of the wire used
to fabricate the coil. The self-inductance is

The path loss is a function of the number of turns and
radius of both coils and the impedances of the system, as well
as the frequency and the distance between reader and tag. The
highest amount of power is transferred to the load when its
impedance is matched with the impedance of the antenna.
For an example system with a transmitter antenna with 100
turns and 1 m of radius paired with a receiver antenna with
100 turns and 10 cm of radius, both resonant at 134.2 kHz,
the path loss in terms of range is shown in Figure 4. The path
loss as a function of frequency is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 4.
Path loss for an inductively coupled system operating at
f = 134.2kHz.
The path loss for the MI system increases with the in-
creasing distance between reader and tag. Also, the path loss
is higher for seawater due to the higher conductivity of the
medium. In freshwater, an increase in frequency decreases the
path loss. However, as the frequency increases, the distance
from the reader where the border between the near and the
far-ﬁeld is located decreases. This implies that the maximum
theoretical range decreases with frequency. We can then con-
clude that there is an optimal combination of frequency and
distance for each application. The decrease in path loss for

higher frequencies is not as signiﬁcant in seawater. This is
due to the higher conductivity, where the attenuation factor is
stronger for higher frequencies.
The inﬂuence of the number of turns of the transmitter or
the receiver coil in the mutual inductance M is linear. There-
fore the power received would increase quadratically with the
increase in the number of turns. The relationship between the
power and radius of the coil is not so straightforward. Figure
6 shows this relationship for a system operating at 134.2kHz
with a transmitter antenna with 100 turns and variable radius,
with a receiver antenna with 100 turns and 10 cm of radius,
at 50 cm of distance between reader and tag.

A more in-depth model of underwater magnetic induction
communication can be found in [13]. The model shown here
assumes that the reader and tag coils are oriented in the same
direction, with the ﬁeld strength reaching zero if the angle
between coils is 90°. To remove this limitation, the authors
in [21] present a model of the Underwater MI channel for
a tri-directional coil. To increase the achievable range of MI
systems, waveguides can be used [12][22].

Data transmission from tag: When a transponder is located
in the magnetic alternating ﬁeld generated by the reader, the
reader ’sees’ the transponder as the secondary wing of the
transformer. This means that the transponder’s impedance is
reﬂected back to the reader as the transformer impedance ZT .
If the transponder antenna impedance changes, this is
reﬂected back to the reader’s coil via the reﬂected impedance
ZT . Therefore, a data stream can be transmitted via modulation
of the voltage UL in the reader’s coil (called Load Modulation);
this can be demodulated by the reader via rectiﬁcation of the
voltage [17]. This is only feasible in the near-ﬁeld as if the
transponder leaves the coupling is lost and the transmission
link is not operational anymore.
For an amplitude modulating system, due to the weak
coupling between reader and transponder antennas, the voltage
ﬂuctuation is orders of magnitude smaller than the voltage
provided by the reader. As a direct result, the reader has
to integrate a complex circuitry to separate noise from the
signal and detect the data stream. On the other hand, if the
transponder modulates the signal at a frequency fS, smaller
than the frequency of the magnetic ﬁeld (f0), two spectral lines
±fS are created and they can be ﬁltered with a band-pass ﬁlter
and demodulated more easily [20].
B. Far-ﬁeld
In the far-ﬁeld, the electromagnetic ﬁelds separate com-
pletely from the reader’s antenna and become propagating
waves, no longer retroacting upon the reader’s antenna. These
waves are captured by the antenna on the transponder. The
energy on the antenna is rectiﬁed and used to power up the
IC. The frequency range commonly used for this type of trans-
mission is the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) and Microwave.
A linearly polarized plane EM wave propagating in lossy
media in the z-direction can be described by the electric ﬁeld
strength Ex:
Ex = E0ejωt−γz
(18)
With γ = α + jωβ as the propagating constant according
to (4) and (5).
In [23], the authors propose a review of this model to
account for the difference between the theoretical model and
the empirical data of attenuation of the radio waves underwater.
The experiments show that the signal attenuation at higher dis-
tances (≫ 10m) is not as strong as predicted. Therefore, they
redeﬁne the attenuation constant α as a corrected absorption
factor α′ that matches experimental results closely:

a dipole receiving antenna (tag), both with gain 1.63. For
freshwater, it is clear that the higher frequencies suffer more
from attenuation than lower frequencies. However, in Figure 9,
the path loss increases with the frequency for 134.2 kHz, 13.52
MHz and 433 MHz, after which the path loss starts to stabilise
around a region. This happens due to the difference in the
behaviour of the propagating medium for different frequencies:
the medium can be classiﬁed as a good dielectric (insulator)
if (σ/ωε)2 ≪ 1 and – contrastingly – as a good conductor if
(σ/ωε)2 ≫ 1. The frequency at which this behaviour change
is around 666 Hz for freshwater (σ = 0.002 S/m) and 888
MHz for seawater (σ = 4 S/m). This behaviour can be seen in
Figure 10, in which the path loss for a reader and a tag with
dipole antennas separated by 50 cm is plotted as a function of
the frequency of transmission. In this ﬁgure, the path loss for
seawater peaks at around 888 MHz.
Data transmission from tag: For passive RFID, the method
of transmitting back to the reader is via Backscatter. Electro-
magnetic waves are reﬂected by objects that are larger than half
the wavelength ( λ
2 ). The efﬁciency of this reﬂection depends

on the reﬂection cross-section of the object: antennas that are
resonant with the waves have a larger reﬂection cross-section.
The reﬂection characteristics can be altered by changing the
load that is connected to the antenna. For example, if a load
RL is switched on and off while connected to the antenna, this
changes the reﬂection characteristics of the antenna, generating
a modulated backscatter signal [17]. The range is limited by
the amount of energy that reaches the tag (path loss) and
the sensitivity of the reader’s receiver to the reﬂected signal
(reﬂected signal strength ∝ 1/x4) [24]. The authors in [25]
present a method for measuring the backscatter of an RFID
tag and for calculating its radar cross-section. They utilise a
network analyzer connected to an anechoic chamber.

MEASUREMENTS
To explore the difference in magnetic ﬁeld strength be-
tween free-space and water in the near-ﬁeld region, a pre-
liminary experiment was designed. The Anritsu MS2038C
VNA Master [26] vector network analyser and the probe 100C
from Beehive Electronics, USA [27] were used to measure
the magnetic ﬁeld strength at the system’s resonant frequency.
Two Evaluation Kit RFID readers were used: MRD2EVM from
Texas Instruments, USA that operates at 134.2 kHz [28] and
Pepper Wireless C1 USB from Eccel Technology Ltd, UK that
operates at 13.56 MHz [29]. Both have square loop antennae
embedded on the printed circuit board, with sides of length
3.0 cm and 4.5 cm, and number of turns 5 and 1, respectively.
For a square loop antenna with N-turns, the magnetic ﬁeld
strength in free-space can be written as [30]:

distance and compare this with the measurements made with
the probe.
For both systems, the setup for the experiments was the
same, as seen in Figure 11. The probe was placed in different
distances z from the centre of the embedded antenna of the
reader. The free-space tests were done without the water
container, while the freshwater measurements were done using
a plastic container bigger than the antenna ﬁlled with tap water.
The plastic container was then placed touching the antenna,
and the probe was submerged in the water to get the measured
ﬁeld strength.

Experiment setup for measuring the magnetic ﬁeld strength in
water.
Figure 12 shows the theoretical and measured values for
the 134.2kHz system, while Figure 13 shows the values for the
13.56MHz system. We can see that for both cases the measured
values agree with the calculated theoretical ones. The dif-
ference between free-space and freshwater for the theoretical
values is very small due to the small α for freshwater. However,
we can see that the difference between measured ﬁeld strength
in freshwater and free-space is greater. This is could be due to
the interfaces of water and plastic and water and air that could
introduce losses to the system. For the 13.56MHz system, the
attenuation underwater is bigger than the attenuation for the
134.2kHz. This is due to the higher attenuation coefﬁcient α
for higher frequencies.

DISCUSSIONS
The most common method of wireless transmission un-

range that can be accomplished with this technology. However,
some applications do not need such long range and are deeply
affected by acoustic noise and refractions, reﬂections and
multipath due to the proximity to the water surface, such as
coastal environments. In these cases, wireless communication
can be better served by other methods that do not suffer from
these problems. We explore the possibility of using RFID
technology to better serve these environments.
In the near-ﬁeld region, the magnetic component of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld dominates. The method of communica-
tion for RFID in this region is MI. Compared to other methods
of underwater communications, MI has several advantages. It
is not affected by multipath propagation or fading and the
magnetic ﬁeld can cross the water to air boundary with low
attenuation [12]. The signal propagation delay is negligible
if compared to acoustic waves. The channel response is pre-
dictable, and a sufﬁciently large range can be achieved with
modest data rates [11].
For the far-ﬁeld, the electromagnetic ﬁeld propagates as
a wave, and the communication is realised through radio-
frequency. Due to the high attenuation, there is a severe
constraint on data rates and propagation distances for this
method [1]. Lower frequency signals have lower attenuation
(due to conductivity of the water) but require larger antennas.
This also limits the bandwidth of the system due to the
lower frequency of operation. Higher frequency systems would
then require more power to reach the same ranges. Shallow
water environments, in particular, pose a problem to wave
propagation due to the proximity to the water to air upper
boundary and to the river/sea bed, which causes multipath
propagation [5].
Both technologies do not require line-of-sight and are
unaffected by light and acoustic ambient noise. Moreover,
the channel response is independent of water quality con-
ditions, such as turbidity. The achievable range for a given
transmission power is not great for both methods, as long-
range transmissions underwater are best served by acoustic
communication. However, the numerical results show that MI
has lower attenuation than RF for freshwater, and similar
results for seawater, which agrees with other studies such as
[12]. Combined with its immunity to multipath and fading, MI
is a great alternative for wireless communications underwater.

Added to that, the achievable range of MI communications
can be greatly extended by deploying waveguides that do
not require power – simple passive relay coils that guide
the magnetic ﬁeld – such as demonstrated in [12][22]. For
example, [12] uses an MI waveguide and achieves a range 26
times higher than a normal MI system. Another development
that improves MI communications underwater is to use omnidi-
rectional coils that remove the requirement of the transmitting
and receiving coils being aligned [11][21].
However, to design an underwater RFID system is to
balance a trade-off between range, transmission power and
frequency (and therefore data rate and channel capacity).
Nonetheless, the RFID system can always be engineered to
achieve the best range given its power budget. For an MI
system, the size and number of turns of the transmitting and
receiving coils has an impact on the path loss. In the far-ﬁeld
category, the antenna can be carefully designed to provide the
best radar cross-section, and therefore antenna gain, for the
desired application.
An example application that would beneﬁt from MI com-
munication over acoustic would be sensors deployed in coastal
areas and ﬁsh farms. In these environments, the acoustic noise
– from waves, animal life and vessels – and the proximity
with the water surface negatively impact acoustic underwater
communications. In these cases, MI underwater communica-
tion would better fulﬁl the needs of the system.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Given the existing challenges in wireless underwater com-
munications, it is worth exploring alternatives, such as RFID.
However, underwater RFID is not a well-explored topic. In
this paper, we expanded on the existing theoretical model for
RFID channel characteristics to account for the attenuation
that the electromagnetic ﬁeld suffers underwater. The RFID
operation was separated into two categories: near-ﬁeld and
far-ﬁeld. For both cases, the physical characteristics of the
transmission were presented and from this, the equation for
path loss was obtained and the values for different system
conﬁgurations were explored.
In both technologies, the water salinity is a problem, as
it increases its conductivity and, therefore, its attenuation.
However, MI communication has advantages that RF does not
have: immunity to multipath propagation and fading. Added
to that, the magnetic ﬁeld can cross the air/water boundary,
which is required for some applications. Therefore, near-ﬁeld
RFID communication is a promising alternative for underwater
wireless communications.
The model presented in this paper considers that both the
transmitting and receiving antennas are located underwater
with no transition borders and other losses. This model could
be expanded to account for transition borders such as the air-
water interface located at the water surface or the interface
with the waterprooﬁng material of the reader and tag. In
this paper, we also presented some preliminary measurements
for magnetic ﬁeld strength in free-space and freshwater. For
future work, we plan to include underwater measurements with
water of different salinity values and reﬁne the measurement
procedure.
