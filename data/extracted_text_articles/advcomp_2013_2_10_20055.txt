Abstract—The classiﬁcation technique using the neural net-
works has been recently developed. We apply a neural network
of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) to classify remote sensing
data including microwave and optical sensors for estimation of a
rice ﬁeld. The method has capability of a nonlinear discrimination
function which is determined by learning. The satellite data
were observed before and after planting rice in 1999. Three
RADARSAT and one SPOT/HRV data are used in Higashi-
Hiroshima City, Japan. RADARSAT image has only one band
data, which is difﬁcult to extract a rice ﬁeld. However, SAR back-
scattering intensity in a rice ﬁeld decreases from April to May
and increases from May to June. Thus, three RADARSAT images
from April to June are used for this study. The LVQ classiﬁcation
was applied to RADARSAT and SPOT data in order to evaluate
rice ﬁeld estimation. The results show that the true production
rate of rice ﬁeld estimation for RADASAT data by using LVQ was
approximately 60% compared with SPOT data. It is shown that
the present method is much better compared with SAR image
classiﬁcation by the maximum likelihood (MLH) method.

I. INTRODUCTION
Rice is the most important agricultural product in Japan
and widely planted in wide places in Japan. A lot of man-
power is still necessary to estimate rice ﬁeld areas every
year. Therefore, the development of a system to monitor the
rice crop will be welcome. Satellite remote sensing images,
such as LAND SATellite Thematic Mapper(LANDSAT TM),
or Satellites Pour l’Observation de la Terre Visible High-
Resolution data(SPOT HRV), has been expected to be used for
estimating a rice ﬁeld. However, these optical sensors hardly
have been able to get necessary data at a suitable time since it
may be often cloudy or rainy during the rice planting season
in Japan.
On the other hand, space borne synthetic aperture adar
penetrates through clouds. Thus, SAR observes a land sur-
face under any weather condition. The back-scattering in-
tensities of C-band SAR images, such as RADAR SATel-
lite(RADARSAT),
or
European

1(ERS1)/SAR, change greatly from a non-cultivated bare soil
condition before rice planting to an inundated condition just
after rice planting [1]. In addition, RADARSAT images are
rather sensitive to a change of rice biomass in a growing
period of rice [2], [3]. Thus, rice area estimation is expected
to be realized in an early stage. In previous works, the authors
attempted to estimate a rice ﬁeld using RADARSAT ﬁne-mode
data in the same stage [4]. The estimation accuracy of a rice
ﬁeld was approximately 40% by comparing with the estimated
area by SPOT multi-spectral data.
In this study, we attempt to detect a rice ﬁeld from
RADARSAT data using Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
and to compare with accuracy by Maximum LikelyHood
(MLH) method . First, we will explain the LVQ algorithm and
then we will show the test site and remote sensing data used
here. After that, classiﬁcation methods will be explained and
experimental results and discussion. Finally, we will present
the conclusion.
II. LEARNING VECTOR QUANTIZATION ALGORITHM
Vector quantization is to represent a data distribution using
a set of units, which are called codebook vectors such that
a distortion measure is minimized. The LVQ algorithm was
proposed by Kohonen [5] in 1997 to ﬁnd representative vectors
among many vectors by learning. In LVQ, only the closest
winning unit (using an Euclidean distance) to the current input
data is moved toward it at each iteration.
We will show the principle of the LVQ in more detail in
what follows. It consists of two layers which are an input
layer and a competitive layer as shown in Fig. 1. In the input
layer, input data with a dimension n are given. Let us denote
the input vector by X and neurons in the competitive layer are
connected to the input vector with weights wji, i = 1, 2, . . . , n
and j = 1, 2, . . . , M where connection weight vector is
denoted by Wj = (wj1, wj2, . . . , wjn), j = 1, 2, . . . , M and
M is the number of neurons in the hidden layer. Furthermore,
we denote the number of cluster by m, the iteration number
by t, and total number of iteration by T.
In order to measure a distance between an input vector X
and a weight vector Wj, we adopt a Euclidean norm given by
dj = ||X − Wj|| =
v

(xi − wji)2.

We will search a neuron in the competitive layer, which
attains the minimum distance and call it as the winning neuron
denoted by c, that is,
dc = min
j
dj = ||X − Wc||.

If the input vector X and the winning unit c belong to the
same cluster, then the weight vector Wc will be moved such
that it becomes nearer to X, as shown in Fig. 2.
Conversely, if they do not belong the same cluster, the
weight vector Wc will be moved such that it becomes farther
from X, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, at an iteration t, if the
input vector X and cluster of c belong to the same cluster,
then at the next iteration t+1
Wj(t + 1)
=
Wj(t) + α(t)(X − Wj(t)), j = c (3)
Wj(t + 1)
=
Wj(t),
j ̸= c. (4)
On the other hand, at an iteration t, if the input vector X
and the winning unit c belong to different cluster, then at the
next iteration t+1
Wj(t + 1)
=
Wj(t) − α(t)(X − Wj(t)), j = c (5)
Wj(t + 1)
=
Wj(t),
j ̸= c. (6)
Initial values of weights wji are determined by using
random numbers. The function α(t) means the learning rate
and it is set as follows:
α(t) = α0(1 − t
T )
(7)
where α0 is a positive initial coefﬁcient of α(t).
III. TEST SITE AND REMOTE SENSING DATA
The test area has a size of about 9.4 by 7.5 km in Higashi-
Hiroshima City, Japan, centered at latitude N 34.42, longitude
E 132.70. This site is located at the eastern part of Hiroshima
City. Three multi-temporal RADARSAT ﬁne-mode (F1F) im-
ages, taken on April 8, May 26, and June 19, in 1999 were
used as test data. SPOT/HRV multi-spectral data taken on June
21, 1999 were used to generate a reference image for a rice
ﬁeld extraction. Above, three merged RADARSAT, as shown
in Fig. 4; one SPOT image in a part of the test site is shown
in Fig 5. The rice ﬁelds are mainly distributed in the bottom-
center portion in the images. The land surface condition in the
rice ﬁelds on April 8 is a non-cultivated bare soil before rice
planting with rather rough soil surface. The surface condition
on May 26 is an almost smooth water surface just after rice
planting, and that on June 19 is a mixed condition of growing
rice and water surface.
The RADARSAT raw data were processed using Vex-
cel SAR Processor (VSARP) and single-look power images
with 6.25 meters ground resolution were generated. Then
the images were ﬁltered using median ﬁlter with 7 by 7
moving window. All RADARSAT and SPOT images were
overlaid onto the topographic map with 1:25,000 scale. As
RADARSAT images are much distorted by foreshortening
due to topography, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with
50 meters spatial resolution issued by Geographical Survey
Institute (GSI) of Japan was used to correct foreshortening of
RADARSAT images.

IV. CLASSIFICATION METHODS
Rice ﬁelds were extracted using two supervised classiﬁca-
tion methods from three temporal RADARSAT images and
one SPOT image. One was an MLH classiﬁer and the other
was an LVQ classiﬁer. In case of the LVQ classiﬁer we
adopted the initial weight α0 = 0.05 for RADARSAT and
α0 = 0.1 for SPOT. The MLH classiﬁer has been used
as a land cover classiﬁcation for satellite images. However,
the classiﬁcation results may become poor accuracy since it
assumes that the distribution of each categorical data is normal
distribution. Kohonen’s LVQ is a classiﬁcation method based
on competitive neural networks, which allows us to deﬁne a
group of categories on the space of input data by supervised
learning algorithm.
A water region, an urban area, a rice ﬁeld, and two kinds of
forest were selected as target categories. We considered three
sub-classes in a water region and an urban area. Furthermore,
four sub-classes in a rice ﬁeld and a forest. Then, we consider
them as the same class. The training data for supervised
classiﬁcation was selected by the map and the ground truth.
As training data of SPOT image we selected as ten areas
of 5x5 pixels , namely 250 pixels in each category. For the
purpose of extraction of a rice ﬁeld, the training data of the
rice ﬁeld were added 800 pixels to the data.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the beginning, SPOT image as an optical sensor classiﬁes
were used for two methods of LVQ and MLH and the
classiﬁcation results were compared. As we can see in Tables
I and II, the results of the confusion matrix were examined by
SPOT data. Comparing the results of two methods, LVQ was
a little better at high accuracy level, although the differences
were not so large.
The results of classiﬁcation rate were shown in Tables
III
and IV. The classiﬁcation score of a rice ﬁeld by SPOT
was about 90 % for both of two classiﬁcation methods and
RADARSAT was about 80 % accuracy. Table IV shows
the result by LVQ classiﬁer of multi-temporal RADARSAT
data. The results are better than MLH. In particular, the rice
classiﬁcation accuracy of LVQ is much better than MLH.
Tables
IV shows the results of average accuracy. The LVQ
classiﬁer is superior to the MLH clasiﬁer.
Figures 6 and 7 show the classiﬁed images by RADARSAT
and SPOT, respectively. The rice ﬁelds were obtained by the
three temporal RADARSAT images. The classiﬁcation result
of the urban and the forest area were different between these
two images, on the other hand, water and rice areas were
resembled between these two images.
We deﬁned two indices, a True Production Rate (TPR) and
a False Production Rate (FPR) for rice areas by RADARSAT.
TPR is the coincidence rate of rice areas by RADARSAT
within those by SPOT and FPR is the rate of non-rice areas
by SPOT within rice areas by RADARSAT. As the rice area
images extracted by RADARSAT are still contaminated by
speckle noises, the majority ﬁlter with 7 by 7 window was
applied to the rice extracted images by RADARSAT before
evaluation. The rice extracted image by SPOT was also ﬁltered
by the same majority operation as RADARSAT to make the
ground resolution compatible each other, as shown in Table V.
We found experimentally that about 60 % of rice areas by
SPOT were not extracted by RADARSAT and about 35 % of
the areas by RADARSAT were outside areas of rice by SPOT
using LVQ. This result of TPR was better than that of MLH.
Figure 6 shows the results of extracted rice ﬁeld in part of the
test site. In the ﬁgure, the white region shows the rice ﬁeld
of each image. MLH has not included adjustable parameters
by users compared with LVQ. The latter could more excellent
results we must ﬁne tuning parameters, especially the learning
rate α(t) selection needs trial error to get the better results.
Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the results of extracted rice ﬁeld
in part of test site of RADASAT by MLH and by the LVQ
method where white color denotes rice-planted area. Figure 10
show the results of extracted rice ﬁeld in part of test site of
SPOT by LVQ. From these results, the classiﬁcation result by
LVQ becomes more detailed extraction of rice ﬁelds compared
with MLH.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
A rice ﬁeld extraction was attempted using multi-temporal
RADARSAT data taken in the early stage of rice growing sea-
son by MLH and LVQ classiﬁcations. The LVQ classiﬁcation
is much better compared with classiﬁcation by the MLH for
a rice ﬁeld extraction by RADARSAT data. However, for a
quantitative evaluation, the rice ﬁeld areas by RADARSAT
resulted in poor coincidence rate with those by SPOT. Thus,
we will apply this proposed method to other SAR data due to
the extraction rice ﬁeld.
