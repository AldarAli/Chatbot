Abstract—Nowadays, many people use a Social Networking Ser-
vice (SNS). Most SNS users are careful in protecting the privacy
of personal information: name, age, gender, address, telephone
number, birthday, etc. However, some SNS users disclose their
personal information that can threaten their privacy and security
even if they use unreal name accounts. In this study, we inves-
tigated Twitter users who gave likes to tweets disclosing submit-
ters’ personal information that potentially threatened submitters’
privacy and security. We collected 318 tweets promising to
disclose submitters’ personal information. Then, we investigated
the relations between the submitters of these 318 tweets and users
who gave likes to them. The results of our survey showed that the
submitters followed most of the users mutually before the users
gave likes to tweets promising to disclose submitters’ personal
information. On the other hand, most of the users did not follow
each other although they followed the same submitters and gave
likes to their tweets.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, many people use a Social Networking Service
(SNS) to communicate with each other and try to enlarge their
circle of friends. SNS users are generally concerned about
potential privacy risks [1]. To be speciﬁc, they are afraid that
unwanted audiences will obtain information about them or
their families, such as where they live, work, and play. As
a result, SNS users are generally careful in disclosing their
personal information. However, some SNS users, especially
young users, disclose their personal information on their
proﬁles, for example, real full name, gender, hometown and
full date of birth, which can potentially be used to identify
details of their real life. In order to discuss the reasons why
some SNS users disclose their personal information willingly,
it is important to investigate who they want to read their SNS
messages disclosing their personal information. However, it is
difﬁcult to ask them who they want to read them. To solve
this problem, it is important to investigate who gave responses
to their SNS messages disclosing their personal information.
This is because, if submitters felt unwanted audiences read and
gave responses to their SNS messages disclosing their personal
information, they would delete them. In order to investigate
who gave responses to SNS messages disclosing submitters’
personal information, we investigate Twitter users who gave
likes to tweets disclosing submitters’ personal information.
Furthermore, we investigate whether users concerned with
a tweet disclosing submitter’s personal information followed
each other. In other words, we investigate whether
•
a submitter followed users who gave likes to his/her
tweet disclosing his/her personal information,
•
users who gave likes to a tweet disclosing submitter’s
personal information followed the submitter, and
•
each user who gave a like to a tweet disclosing
submitter’s personal information followed every other
user who gave a like to the same tweet.
In this study, we examine these points by checking their Twitter
follow relations. The investigation is based on an idea: when
an user follow someone on Twitter, he/she is not a stranger to
the user. By using the results of the investigation, we discuss
the relations of submitters of tweets disclosing their personal
information and users who gave likes to the tweets. The
results of the investigation might improve social media design
elements, such as privacy controls and friend introductions.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we survey the related works. In Section III, we show how
to collect tweets where submitters seemingly disclosed their
personal information honestly and detect users who gave likes
to them. In Section IV, we examine whether users concerned
with a tweet disclosing submitter’s personal information fol-
lowed each other and discuss the relations of them. Finally, in
Section V, we present our conclusions.

RELATED WORK
Personally identiﬁable information is deﬁned as informa-
tion, which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s
identity, such as social security number, biometric records,
etc. alone, or when combined with other information that
is linkable to a speciﬁc individual, such as date and place
of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. [2] [3]. Internet users
are generally concerned about unwanted audiences obtaining
personal information. Fox et al. reported that 86% of Internet
users are concerned that unwanted audiences will obtain in-
formation about them or their families [1]. However, Internet
users, especially young users, tend to disclose personal infor-
mation on their proﬁles, for example, real full name, gender,
hometown and full date of birth. As a result, many researchers
discussed the reasons why young users willingly disclose
personal information on their SNS proﬁles. Acquisti and Gross
explained this phenomenon as a disconnection between the
users’ desire to protect their privacy and their actual behavior
[4]. Also, Livingstone pointed out that teenagers’ conception of
privacy does not match the privacy settings of most SNSs [5].
On the other hand, Barnes argued that Internet users, especially
teenagers, are not aware of the nature of the Internet and SNSs
[6]. Viseu, Clement, and Aspinall reported that many online

items in her tweets.
users believe the beneﬁts of disclosing personal information
in order to use an Internet site is greater than the potential
privacy risks [7]. The authors think that most SNS users are
seriously concerned about their privacy and security. However,
they often underestimate the risk of their online messages and
submit them. Hirai reported that many users had troubles in
SNSs because they never thought that strangers observed their
communication with their friends [8]. Watanabe, Nishimura,
Chikuki, Nakajima, and Okada reported that some Twitter
users submitted tweets disclosing their personal information
that can threaten their privacy and security even if they
use unreal name accounts [9]. In this study, we investigate
what relations existed between users concerned with a tweet
disclosing submitter’s personal information. In order to analyze
relations in communities, many researchers have adopted tie
strength. Granovetter deﬁned tie strength as the strength of
a friendship: close friends are strong ties and acquaintances
are weak ties [10]. Both strong ties and weak ties are useful
because they provide access to different types of resources
[11]. For example, strongly tied peers have greater motivation
for assistance and provide access to information known by the
group [10]. In contrast, weak ties provide diverse perspectives
as well as novel information and resources [12]. Panovich,
Miller, and Karger investigated the relation of tie strength to
answer quality and showed that social network Q&A is more
effective when the asker and answerer know each other well
[13]. Gilbert and Karahalios proposed a predictive model of tie
strength on Facebook using proﬁle characteristics [14]. In this
study, we investigate what relations existed between Twitter
users concerned with a tweet disclosing submitter’s personal
information by checking their Twitter follow relations.
III.
A COLLECTION OF TWEETS DISCLOSING
SUBMITTERS’ PERSONAL INFORMATION
It is difﬁcult to collect tweets disclosing submitters’ per-
sonal information, such as tweets in Figure 1, directly. To solve
this problem, we focused on tweets where submitters promised
their audiences to disclose the same number of their own
personal proﬁle items as likes to their tweets. Figure 2 shows a
tweet submitted by Yata on December 30, 2021. Both in Figure
1 and Figure 2, her screen name is redacted for privacy. Figure
2 shows that Yata promised her audiences to disclose the same
number of her personal proﬁle items as likes to her tweet.
Figure 2. A tweet promising to disclose the same number of submitter’s
personal proﬁle items as likes to it.
Actually, as shown in Figure 1, Yata submitted three replies
disclosing her ﬁve personal proﬁle items to her tweet shown
in Figure 2 on December 30, 2021. Watanabe, Nishimura,
Chikuki, Nakajima, and Okada reported that Twitter users
seemingly disclosed their personal information honestly when
they promised to do it, such as Yata’s tweet in Figure 2 [9].
As a result, it is easy to collect tweets disclosing submitters’
personal proﬁle items when we collect tweets promising to
disclose submitters’ personal proﬁle items. Furthermore, they
often used the same sentence in their tweets, like a game
password, as shown in Figure 2, # I will show the same number
of my proﬁle items as your likes. In order to collect tweets
promising to disclose submitters’ personal proﬁle items, we
used the shared sentence as key to collect them. To be speciﬁc,
we collected these tweets by using Twitter API v2 [15]. Twitter
API v2 helps us to collect tweets where the given sentence is
used. Also, Twitter API v2 helps us to collect user accounts
who submitted a speciﬁc tweet and who gave likes to it. Every
10 PM, we tried to collect user accounts and their tweets
•
that contained # I will show the same number of my
proﬁle items as your likes
•
that were submitted in the past 24 hours, and
•
that were given one or more likes.
After we obtained the tweets promising to disclose submitters’
personal proﬁle items, we tried to collect user accounts who

gave likes to the obtained tweets every 10 PM for a week.
Finally, we collected 318 Japanese tweets promising to dis-
close submitters’ personal information. These 318 tweets were
submitted from December 30, 2021 to January 31, 2022 by
317 users. One out of the 317 users submitted two tweets
promising to disclose his personal information on January 12
and 17, 2022. These 318 tweets were given 7060 likes by 6325
users within a week after they were submitted. Figure 3 shows
the histogram of the number of likes given to the obtained 318
tweets promising to disclose submitters’ personal information.
Figure 4 shows the daily number of likes given to the obtained
318 tweets in the investigation period. Day N in Figure 4
means that N days have passed since the obtained tweet was
submitted and our investigation started. Day 6 was the last day
of the investigation period. Figure 4 shows that 77 % of likes
were given on Day 0. 30 tweets out of the 318 tweets were
deleted within a week after they were submitted.
IV.
AN ANALYSIS OF TWEETS DISCLOSING SUBMITTERS’
PERSONAL INFORMATION
In this section, we investigate whether users concerned with
a tweet disclosing submitter’s personal information followed
each other. To be speciﬁc, we survey
•
Twitter users who submitted tweets promising to dis-
close the same number of their own personal proﬁle
items as likes and
•
Twitter users who gave likes to these tweets
and investigate
•
whether an user who submitted a tweet promising to
disclose his/her personal information followed users
who gave likes to the tweet,
•
whether users who gave likes to a tweet promising to
disclose submitter’s personal information followed the
submitter, and
•
whether users who gave likes to a tweet promising
to disclose submitter’s personal information followed
each other.
The investigation is based on an idea: when an user follow
someone on Twitter, he/she is not a stranger to the user. We
can know whether an user follows someone on Twitter by using
Twitter API v2.
After collecting user accounts of submitters and users who
gave likes to submitters’ tweets, we analyze the relations
between them. The relations between a submitter and an user
who gave a like to submitter’s tweet can be classiﬁed into three
types:
•
mutual follow relation: The submitter and the user
mutually followed each other.
•
one sided follow relation: The submitter followed the
user, however, the user did not. Or, the user followed
the submitter, however, the submitter did not.
•
no follow relation: The submitter and the user did not
follow each other.
Furthermore, we analyze the relations among users who gave
likes to submitter’s tweet. They can also be classiﬁed into three
types: mutual follow relation, on sided follow relation, or no
follow relation.
Let us consider one example. As shown in Figure 2, a
Twitter user, Yata, submitted a tweet promising her audiences
to disclose the same number of her own personal proﬁle items
as likes on December 30, 2021 at 9:02 PM. We detected her
tweet on the same day at 10:00 PM, and then, recorded that
she received ﬁve likes and submitted three replies disclosing
12

her ﬁve personal proﬁle items on December 30, 2021. After
that, every 10 PM, we tried to check whether someone gave
likes to her tweet. On January 5, 2022, we conﬁrmed that
ﬁve users gave ﬁve likes to her tweet on December 30, 2021,
as shown in Figure 2, and ﬁnished the investigation on her
tweet. Then, we analyzed the relations between Yata and each
of the ﬁve users and conﬁrmed that she followed them and
each of them followed her. As a result, the relations between
Yata and each of the ﬁve users were mutual follow relations.
Furthermore, we analyzed the relations among the ﬁve users.
There were ten cases to choose two out of the ﬁve users. In
one case out of the ten, two users followed each other. On
the other hand, in nine cases out of the ten, two users did not
follow each other. As a result, the relation of one case was a
mutual follow relation and the relations of the other nine cases
were no follow relations.
A. Follow relations between submitters and users who gave
likes to submitters’ tweets
At ﬁrst, we discuss the mutual follow relations between
submitters and users who gave likes to submitters’ tweets. In
order to discuss this problem, we introduce the ratio of mutual
follow relations between a submitter and users who gave likes
to his/her tweet. Suppose that the number of users who gave
likes to tweet t is n and m of them are mutually following the
submitter of tweet t. Then, the ratio of mutual follow relations
between the submitter of tweet t and the users who gave likes
to it, PMF 1(t), is deﬁned as follows:
PMF 1(t) = m
n
Figure 5 shows the distribution of the ratio of mutual follow
relations between the submitters of the obtained 318 tweets
and the users who gave likes to them. Furthermore, Figure 5
(a) and (b) shows the distribution of them investigated on the
Day 0 and Day 6, respectively. As shown in Figure 5, it is
probable that most of the users have followed the submitters
mutually before they gave likes to submitters’ tweets promising
to disclose their personal information. In other words, the
submitters and most of the users were not strangers to each
other. The distribution of the mutual relation ratio on Day 6
(Figure 5 (b)) moved to the left than that on Day 0 (Figure 5
(a)). It showed that the number of users who did not follow the
submitters and whom the submitters did not follow increased.
It is probable that submitters were careful to follow unfamiliar
users even if they gave likes to their tweets.
Next, we discuss the no follow relations between submitters
and users who gave likes to submitters’ tweets. In order to
discuss this problem, we introduce the ratio of no follow
relations between a submitter and users who gave likes to
his/her tweet. Suppose that the number of users who gave likes
to tweet t is n and l of them are not following the submitter
of tweet t and the submitter is not following them, too. Then,
the ratio of no follow relations between the submitter of tweet
t and the users who gave likes to it, PNF 1(t), is deﬁned as
follows:
PNF 1(t) = l
n
Figure 6 shows the distribution of the ratio of no follow
relations between the submitters of the obtained 318 tweets
and the users who gave likes to them. Figure 6 shows that
the number of users who had the no follow relations with the
submitters was small on Day 0 and increased after Day 1. It
is probable that the delays were caused by the time it took to
ﬁnd tweets disclosing submitters’ personal information.
B. Follow relations among users who gave likes to submitters’
tweets
At ﬁrst, we discuss the mutual follow relations among users
who gave likes to submitters’ tweets. In order to discuss this
problem, we introduce the ratio of mutual follow relations
among users who gave likes to a tweet. Suppose that the
number of users who gave likes to tweet t is n and there are m
cases where two users of them are following each other. Then,
the ratio of mutual follow relations among the users who gave
likes to tweet t, PMF 2(t), is deﬁned as follows:
PMF 2(t) =
m
n(n − 1)/2
Figure 7 shows the distribution of the ratio of mutual follow
relations among the users who gave likes to the obtained 318
tweets. Figure 7 shows that it is probable that most of the users
did not follow each other mutually. In other words, most of
the users were strangers to each other although they followed
the same submitters and gave likes to their tweets.
Next, we discuss the no follow relations among users
who gave likes to submitters’ tweets. In order to discuss this
problem, we introduce the ratio of no follow relations among
users who gave likes to a tweet. Suppose that the number of
users who gave likes to tweet t is n and there are l cases where
two users of them are not following each other. Then, the ratio
of no follow relations among the users who gave likes to tweet
t, PNF 2(t), is deﬁned as follows:
PNF 2(t) =
l
n(n − 1)/2
Figure 8 shows the distribution of the ratio of no follow
relations among the users who gave likes to the obtained 318
tweets. The distribution of the no relation ratio on Day 6
(Figure 8 (b)) was similar to that on Day 0 (Figure 8 (a)). It
showed that it is probable that not many users started to follow
users within a week even if they gave likes to the same tweets.
It is probable that users were careful to follow unfamiliar users
even if they gave likes to the same tweets.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the relations of submitters
of tweets promising to disclose their personal information
and users who gave likes to the tweets. The results of our
investigation show that most of the users had followed the
submitters mutually before they gave likes to submitters’
tweets promising to disclose their personal information. On
the other hand, most of the users did not follow each other
although they followed the same submitters and gave likes to
their tweets. As time went on, the number of users who gave
likes to submitters’ tweets but did not follow the submitters and
whom the submitters did not follow increased. It is probable
that submitters were careful to follow unfamiliar users even
if they gave likes to their tweets. Also, users were careful
to follow unfamiliar users even if they followed the same
submitters and gave likes to the same tweets. The system
that understands these relations might carefully treat users who
choose not to friend someone with good reasons.
