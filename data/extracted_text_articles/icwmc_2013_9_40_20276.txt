Abstract—IEEE 802.15.4 is designed mainly for static low
duty cycle wireless personal area network and its capability
to support mobility has not been extensively explored yet. We
observed that the amount of time required for the association
process is the key reason for making IEEE 802.15.4 unable to
handle mobility. In a beacon-enabled network, mobile node can
only learn about the existence of any neighbor by listening to
incoming beacons. Nevertheless, as neither the channel on which
the neighbor operates nor its frequency of beaconing are known,
nodes have to scan every available channel, which can take from
few to several seconds depending upon the beacon interval. In
this paper, we propose a new fast association technique, which
prevents nodes from scanning multiple channels. In our proposed
scheme, by scanning just a single channel, node can learn about
all the coordinators working in different channels. Our single
channel scan scheme is able to decrease the association time of
IEEE 802.15.4 operation in 2.4 GHz by 32 times. Experiment
results have veriﬁed that our scheme works well in the mobile
environment.

INTRODUCTION
Incorporating mobility in wireless personal area network
(WPAN or PAN) is one of the most desirable features today,
but it raises many new challenges. WPANs widely use IEEE
802.15.4 due to its low energy consumption, low cost, and
small size. In WPAN, node mobility is expected to facilitate
numerous applications, from home health-care and medical
monitoring to target detection [1]. Wireless body area network
(WBAN) is one such area where node mobility is frequent
and IEEE 802.15.4 has been proposed as its possible MAC
in various literatures [2][3]. There are, however, also multiple
other cases in which an IEEE 802.15.4 node needs to discover
coordinator in their proximity and establish communication
with them. Such a scenario requires very efﬁcient discovery
schemata. Although the standard MAC protocol IEEE 802.15.4
has proven to satisfy low data-rate and low power-consumption
requirements, the support for mobility is desirable in various
WPAN applications [1]. In IEEE 802.15.4, there are mainly
two types of devices: full function device (FFD) and reduced
function device (RFD). FFD can support all the network
functions and can operate as a PAN coordinator or an end
device. RFD can only be used as an end device. The IEEE
802.15.4 standard supports three kinds of topology: star, peer-
to-peer, and cluster tree topologies, which can operate on
beacon and non-beacon-enabled modes.
Node association deﬁnes the procedure with which nodes
can become a member of WPAN. In beacon-enabled networks,
end devices ﬁrst discover coordinator(s) by listening to the
beacons and then join them by using association messages.
However, once a node moves out of the radio range of its
parent, it loses synchronization with its parent and ﬁnds a new
parent.
This paper focuses on the problem of how a node having no
initial information about the surrounding can organize fast and
energy efﬁcient discovery of other WPANs in a beacon-enabled
network. In such case, node can only learn about the existence
of any neighbor by listening to their beacons. There are 16
channels in the 2.4 GHz band, 10 in the 915 MHz band, and 1
channel in the 868 MHz band allocated for IEEE 802.15.4 [4].
Nevertheless, as the channel on which the neighbor operates
are unknown, nodes have to scan every single available channel
in their operational band before getting associated. In this pa-
per, we introduce a novel association scheme called dedicated
beacon channel (DBC) in which beacon frame is broadcast
in a dedicated channel. Our multichannel solution allows a
node to acquire network information about all the coordinators
in the vicinity by scanning just a single channel. DBC can
decrease the association time of IEEE 802.15.4 by 32 times.
However, application of DBC is not limited to IEEE 802.15.4
and can be used in any beacon-enabled network. Furthermore,
with the application of DBC scheme, now IEEE 802.15.4 does
not require separate channel scans such as ED scan, active
scan, passive scan, and orphan scan for learning different status
of channels. Our single DBC scheme does functions of all
channel scans with minimal time. However, we propose only
the modiﬁcation of association scheme to provide support for
mobility where as keeping intact the original features such as
ﬂexibility, scalability, adaptability, and low power consumption
of original protocol as it is. The proposed scheme is a complete
and sophisticated protocol that will be beneﬁcial in the next
generation mobile WPAN applications.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II presents the brief description on association procedure
of beacon-enabled IEEE 802.15.4 followed by related works
in Section III. Section IV shows the operation and the main
features of the proposed association scheme. The numerical
and simulation analysis of the proposed scheme has been
described in Sections V and VI. Finally, we conclude the paper
in Section VII.

ASSOCIATION IN BEACON-ENABLED IEEE 802.15.4
In the beacon-enabled mode, communication is synchro-
nized and controlled by a network coordinator, which transmits
periodic beacons. The beacon contains information related to
PAN identiﬁcation, synchronization, and superframe structure.

The superframe may consist of active and inactive periods.
The active part of the superframe consists of two groups: the
contention access period (CAP) and an optional contention
free period (CFP). All communications must take place during
the active part, and devices can sleep to conserve energy in
the inactive part. The structure of superframe is determined
by coordinators using two parameters: superframe order (SO)
and beacon order (BO). SO is used to determine the length
of superframe duration, while BO deﬁnes the beacon interval.
The duty cycle of nodes within PAN depends on BO and SO.
Increasing both BO and SO, increases transmission latency
and decreases system throughput due to intensive channel
contention, whereas simultaneously decreasing BO and SO
increases energy consumption and reduces available bandwidth
[5].
Any FFD could be a PAN coordinator. FFD should perform
the energy detection (ED) to detect the peak energy of a chan-
nel and choose an appropriate channel for data transmission.
In each channel, ED scan is performed for the duration of
tscan symbols. Then, it carries out an active scan to locate
any coordinator transmitting beacon frames within its personal
operating space (POS). During the active scanning, it ﬁrst
sends out a beacon request command and waits for the duration
of tscan symbols. If a beacon could not be detected in tscan, the
FFD believes that there is no coordinator in its POS and can
construct its own PAN by broadcasting its periodic beacons.
After a PAN has been initialized, the other devices in the
POS of the PAN can communicate with the coordinator and
associate with this PAN. In order to start association, an end
device needs to know PAN’s physical channel, coordinator
ID, addressing mode, and PAN ID. In beacon-enabled IEEE
802.15.4, two types of channel scanning operations are per-
formed by end devices. During scan, nodes are deprived from
data communication and must discard all data frames received.
(i) Passive scan is performed by the node, which is just turned
on or who failed to ﬁnd its coordinator through the orphan
scan. As shown in Fig. 1(a), during passive scan, a device
search for beacon frame in each channel for the duration of
tscan symbols and records the beacon frames received in each
channel. If no beacon is detected, the device starts another
passive scan after a period of time. (ii) Orphan scan allows a
device to attempt to relocate its coordinator following a loss of
synchronization. The device shall ﬁrst send the orphan notiﬁ-
cation command frame, and waits for coordinator realignment
command frame for at most macResponseWaitTime symbols as

shown in Fig. 1(b). This procedure is repeated until it receives
the coordinator realignment frame or all the available channels
are scanned. If the device is unable to ﬁnd its parent though the
orphan scan, it looks for a new parent by performing passive
scan. Once the node ﬁnds the suitable coordinator, it can start
association procedure by sending a request for association. The
message sequence exchanged during the association is shown
in Fig. 2. If the association request is permitted, the device
will successfully associate with the PAN and get its own PAN
address to communicate with others. Thus, in beacon-enabled
IEEE 802.15.4, a node association requires channel scanning
followed by the association message exchange, which is really
a time consuming procedure. For a mobile node, association
procedure is even worse because the mobile node has to go
through the orphan scan ﬁrst followed by the passive scan
and then only can start the association message exchange. We
use the term re-association to explicitly denote the association
procedure used by the mobile node. We have observed from
our study that if somehow this whole association duration be
shortened to some tolerable level, IEEE 802.15.4 can be used
in the mobile sensor network applications.
III.
RELATED WORKS
There are some efforts done to minimize the association
duration in IEEE 802.15.4. In IEEE 802.15.4e [6], optional
fast association (FastA) is deﬁned, which allows a device to
associate in a reduced duration. However, most of the efforts
are limited to decreasing the duration of association message
exchange or coordinator discovery, whereas the channel scan-
ning part has been left untouched. The association duration
can be drastically shortened if somehow nodes are prevented
from scanning every single available channel. Similarly, there
are several works on multichannel solutions, but are limited
to throughput improvement or beacon collision avoidance
[7][8][9]. To our best knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to propose
the multichannel solution for the association procedure.
In [10], Zhang et al. proposed an improved association
scheme called Simple Association Process (SAP) that elim-
inates the redundant primitives, thus, decrease the packet
collisions and the association delay. In order to account for
real-time trafﬁc, Meng et al. [11] proposed a new association
scheme in which channel scanning is stopped as soon as one of
the discovered PAN coordinators is estimated worthy to initiate
the association process. Although, this scheme prevents nodes
from scanning all available channels, but still nodes need to
scan multiple channels before ﬁnding the suitable coordinator.
Similarly, there are other works, which focus on the
neighbor discovery for quick association. In [12], algorithms

are proposed for the optimized discovery of IEEE 802.15.4
static and mobile networks operating in multiple frequency
bands and with different beacon intervals. In [13], a scheme
to increase coordinator connectivity time with mobile nodes is
presented for IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled networks. Nodes
use time-stamp of received beacons during the scan, along
with link quality to determine the appropriate coordinator for
association. Other mobility management schemes for cluster-
tree based WPAN have been proposed by Chaabane et al. [14]
and Bashir et al. [15]. These approaches use the speculative
algorithm for node association based on LQI. Based on LQI
value, mobile node anticipates cell change before the loss of
connection and tries to associate with the next coordinator.
However, in all the cases, nodes have to scan multiple channels
to ﬁnd coordinators.
IV.
PROPOSED SCHEME
In our proposed DBC scheme, we exploit the channel
switching capability of IEEE 802.15.4 radio hardware. In
DBC, we proposed the use of two channels: beacon channel
(BC) and data channel (DC). BC is used for transmission and
reception of the beacon frames only where as the rest of the
communication is done in the DC. A ﬁxed dedicated channel
is assigned for beacon whereas PAN coordinators are ﬂexible
to choose their own DC. Node switches its radio channel to the
beacon channel during its beacon period and then returns to its
original data channel at the end of the beacon period as shown
in Fig. 3. Thus, transmission and reception of the beacon frame
is done in the separate beacon channel. With this small and
simple modiﬁcation in the original IEEE 802.15.4, now the
nodes do not need to scan each and every channel for the
association. The entire network information can be learned by
just scanning the BC only as shown in Fig. 4. IEEE 802.15.4
has 4 types of scanning, i.e., ED scan, active scan, orphan
scan, and passive scan. Our scheme allows IEEE 802.15.4 to
work solely with the single passive scan only. Our scheme
has the potential to decrease the association time not just by
percentage, but by many folds that we will be demonstrating
in coming sections. DBC scheme can be used in any network
topology. However, in case of peer-to-peer and cluster tree
topologies, we assume that IEEE 802.15.4 successfully avoids
beacon collisions.

A. Modiﬁcation in Beacon Frame
In order to realize our proposed scheme, the data channel of
PAN should be conveyed in the beacon frame. For this, either
a new ﬁeld (data channel of 1 byte) can be added in the beacon
frame as shown in Fig. 6 or the data channel information may
be piggyback in beacon payload or some other ﬁelds.

B. Initialization of a PAN coordinator
Unlike in original IEEE 802.15.4, nodes do not perform ED
scan and active scan for initialization of a PAN coordinator. In
our proposed scheme, when a FFD is initialized, it performs
the passive scan in the beacon channel only for the durations
of tscan (Fig. 4). At the end of the passive scan, the FFD
will have the clear picture of all the working PANs in the
surrounding and can join the suitable PAN. If a beacon could
not be detected in the scan duration, the FFD believes that
there is no coordinator in its POS and can construct its own
PAN by broadcasting its periodic beacons. The FFD is ﬂexible
to select its own non-overlapped DC, but it must broadcast
its beacon in the BC. In the case where a number of PANs
coexist in an adjacent area, (i.e., apartments or buildings having
independent PAN), once the FFD ﬁnds out the available PANs
through the passive scan, it schedules its beacon period with
the minimum gap of the short interframe space (SIFS) than
the last beacon frame it received, and chooses the unused DC
from the available pool as shown in Fig. 5.
C. Association of network devices
A device that wants to associate with a PAN can be a new
(just turn on) or an orphan device. In IEEE 802.15.4, there
are separate procedures for the association of new and orphan
devices. However, in our proposed scheme, there is only the
passive scan and both devices perform the same procedure.
An unassociated node performs passive scan in the BC for the
duration of tscan symbols. At the end of the passive scan, the
end device will have clear information about all the coordinator
in the surrounding and may join the suitable coordinator.

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
Let aBaseSuperFrameDuration be the number of symbols
forming a superframe when SO = 0 and tscan symbols be the
time spent to scan a channel. In IEEE 802.15.4, it takes equal
duration to perform ED, active, and passive scan on a channel
and is given by,
tscan = aBaseSuperFrameDuration × (2BO + 1).

A. PAN Initialization
In IEEE 802.15.4, a PAN coordinator performs ED scan
and active scan in all available n channels. But, in case of DBC,
only passive scan is performed in the BC for the duration of
tscan. Thus, the total initialization time of a PAN coordinator
for IEEE 802.15.4 and DBC is,
PAN802.15.4 init = 2n × tscan,
(2)
PANDBC init = tscan.
(3)
Thus, comparing (2) and (3), DBC decreases the initialization
of PAN coordinator by the factor of 2n.
B. Association
The total time spent for association is the sum of time
spent in the channel scan and the time spent in the association
message exchange (Assomsg). A device that wants to associate
with a PAN can be a new or orphan. IEEE 802.15.4 has
separate procedures for the association of new and orphan
devices. The total time spend for association by a newly joining
node for both protocols are given by,
t802.15.4 asso = n × tscan + Assomsg.
(4)
tDBC asso = tscan + Assomsg.
(5)
From (4) and (5), DBC is able to decrease the association time
of newly joining node by almost the factor of n.
In beacon-enabled IEEE 802.15.4, an orphan node per-
forms the orphan scan on each channel for duration of macRe-
sponseWaitTime (32×aBaseSuperFrameDuration) symbols un-
til its parent is found or all n channels are scanned. Upon
the failure of orphan scan, a new parent is searched through
passive scan as mentioned above. Thus, the total time spent
for re-association is given by,
t802.15.4 reasso = n×macResponseWaitT ime+t802.15.4 asso.
(6)
Thus, comparing (5) and (6), DBC decreases the re-association
time of a node by many folds.
C. Numerical example
Assuming network parameters from Table II, we get aBas-
eSuperFrameDuration of 15.36 ms and macResponseWaitTime
and Assomsg of 0.49 sec [4]. Thus, using these values and
above equations and assuming BO = 3, the association time
for both IEEE 802.15.4 and DBC is shown in Table I. From
the values obtained in the table, we can conclude that DBC
reduces the association time of IEEE 802.15.4 by signiﬁcant
amount and makes association duration independent of the
number of available channels. We calculated, theoretically how
many times DBC can decrease the PAN initialization and
re/association time of the original IEEE 802.15.4 for all values
of BO (BO = SO), and the achieved graph is shown in Fig. 7.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The simulation analysis is performed using network simu-
lator NS-2. 10 nodes are deployed in a 50x50m ﬁeld with the
PAN coordinator in the center as shown in Fig. 8, where arrow
heads indicate the direction of movement of the mobile end
device (node 9). All coordinators broadcast beacon, and BO is
same for all nodes. In the simulation time of 100 secs, node
9 starts data transmission and at the simulation time of 110
secs, it starts to move. The mobile node continuously moves
while transmitting data to PAN coordinator. The simulation
ends when the mobile node comes to its original position.
There are total 8 cell changes before the mobile node comes
to complete rest. In all the simulations, SO is the same as BO.
Network parameters are listed in Table II.

A. Association Time
Fig. 9 shows the PAN initialization time and the node
re/association times for various values of BO obtained from
numerical analysis and NS-2 simulations. In the NS-2 imple-
mentation, the PAN coordinator performs the passive scan for
PAN initialization in the beacon-enabled mode. Similarly, for
the assigned BO, except the PAN coordinator, other nodes use
BO + 1 internally as the parameter for the scan duration.
The numerical equations from Section
V were adjusted
accordingly. In all cases, the analytical results match well with
the simulation results. As shown in the ﬁgure, the time required
by DBC for re/association is much lower because only the BC
is scanned for the association procedure. However, in the case
of IEEE 802.15.4, it scans all available 16 channels spending
signiﬁcant amount of time and energy. Also, from the ﬁgure,
we can see that the time required for both re/association is
same for DBC because there is no orphan scan, and the same
passive scan procedure is used for both re/association. At BO
= 3, DBC is able to decrease the PAN initialization time by
15.92 times, the node association time by 6.19 times and the re-
association time by 16.59 times, which is a great achievement
in itself.
The energy spent by the PAN coordinator to start a PAN
and for the node re/association under various BO is shown in
Fig. 10. Since the time spent by the DBC is much lesser, it
has a direct proportional impact in the energy consumption.
At BO = 3, DBC is able to decrease the PAN initialization
energy by 7 times, the node association energy by 7.5 times
and the re-association energy by 17.75 times. Thus, from above
observations, we can conclude that DBC is able to save both
energy and time by the signiﬁcant amount.
B. Association Success Rate
Success rate of association is calculated as the ratio
of successful associations to the total number of possible
associations. In our simulation model, there were total 8
associations possible before the mobile node comes to rest.
DBC increases the successful association rate of a mobile
node by providing quick passive discovery of a coordinator.
Percentage of successful associations at different BO(s) and
node speeds are shown in Fig. 11. We observed that in case
of IEEE 802.15.4, even a slight mobility has a signiﬁcant
negative impact on association. At the human walking speed

of 1.5 m/s, IEEE 802.15.4 has poor success rate of association
even at the lower values of BO, and at BO = 5 nodes were
completely unable to associate. However, in the case of DBC,
association rate was 100% until BO = 4 and even at BO =
5, DBC could successfully performed 7 associations out of
8. However, at node speed of 1.5 m/s, DBC was completely
unable to associate at BO≥9.
C. Packet delivery ratio and throughput
Fig. 12 shows the throughput observed at the PAN coor-
dinator in packet delivery ratio (PDR). Because of the prompt
re/association capability of DBC, mobile node can transmit
most of the generated data to the coordinator increasing the
overall throughput of the network. We can see in Fig. 12
that PDR of DBC is much better than that of IEEE 802.15.4
for various node speeds, which corresponds to the better
throughput achieved. At node speed of 1.5 m/s and BO = 5, the
PDR of IEEE 802.15.4 was just 20% that is also due to the fact
that the mobile node 9 gets some opportunity to transmit data
through node 6 before it starts to move and cannot associate
then after. However, the PDR of DBC was of 82% for the
same scenario.
The effect of cell change on throughput observed at the
PAN coordinator at the node speed of 1 m/s and at the data
rate of 2 Kbps is shown in Fig. 13. Coordinators in the network

Throughput observed at BO = 3, mobility of 1 m/s, and data rate
of 2 Kbps. Red circle indicates the loss of synchronization by node 9.
circles in the ﬁgure indicate the time when the node 9 lost
synchronization with the parent coordinator. Throughput of
DBC drops while performing cell change because packets
can’t be transmitted in the periods of passive discovery and
association. However, nodes quickly get associated with a new
coordinator and restart data transmission. Nodes can buffer
packets. Therefore, buffered data are also transmitted after new
association is completed, resulting into increased throughput
immediately after association. In some cell changes, through-
put does not even drop to zero and regains its default value
verifying prompt association property of DBC. However, in
case of IEEE 802.15.4, nodes were unable to associate in every
cell change and out of 8, only 3 successful associations were
achieved resulting in poor performance. The PDR observed
were of 53% and 96% respectively for IEEE 802.15.4 and
DBC.
VII.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a new association scheme for
IEEE 802.15.4 called DBC, which can decrease both time
and energy required for association. To achieve the above
mentioned advantages, the proposed DBC uses a dedicated
channel for beacon transmission, depriving nodes from scan-
ning all the available channels and looking for beacon. Our
analytical and simulation results demonstrated that our scheme
is highly efﬁcient in terms of both energy and time. With the
implementation of our scheme, we give new direction for IEEE
802.15.4 to be able to handle mobility. However, in this paper
we assumed, there is no beacon collision. As future directions,
we envision to study and provide solution for beacon-collision
avoidance in a dense network.
