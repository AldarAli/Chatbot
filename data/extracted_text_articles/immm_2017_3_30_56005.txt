Abstract—Blogosphere has, although slowly after the advent of 
Twitter, continued to rise and provides a rich medium for 
content framing. With no restriction on the number of 
characters, many users use blogs to express their opinion and 
use other social media channels like Twitter and Facebook to 
steer their audience to their blogs. Blogs provide more content 
than any other social media and serve as a good platform for 
agenda-setting. This content can be of great use to sociologists 
and data scientists to track opinions about events. However, 
the importance of blog tracking has been challenged due to the 
complex process of data collection and handling unstructured 
text data. This has caused many tracking tools to abandon 
blogs and move to other medium like Twitter. Nevertheless, 
blogs continue to be an important part of social media and 
cannot be ignored. In this paper, we explain the process to 
collect blog data, challenges we encounter, and demonstrate 
the importance of blog tracking through a real-world test case. 
The blog datasets discussed in this paper are made available 
publicly for researchers and practitioners through the 
Blogtrackers tool. 
Keywords-blog; unstructured data; web crawling; blog data

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The advent of participatory Web applications (or Web 
2.0 [1]) have created online media that has turned the former 
mass information consumer to the present information 
producer [2]. Examples include blogs, wikis, social 
annotation and tagging, media sharing, and various other 
services. A blog site or simply blog (short for web log) is a 
collection of entries by individuals displayed in reverse 
chronological order. These entries, known as blog posts, can 
typically combine text, images, and URLs (Uniform 
Resource Locator) pointing to other blogs and/or to other 
Web pages. Blogging is becoming a popular means for mass 
Web users to express, communicate, share, collaborate, 
debate, and reflect. WordPress, a popular blogging platform, 
reports that more than 80.7 million blog posts are generated 
each month [3]. 
 Blogosphere is a virtual universe that contains all blogs. 
Blogosphere also represents a network of blogs where each 
node could be either a blog or a blog post and the edges 
depict a hyperlink between two nodes in the Blogosphere. 
Bloggers, the blog post writers/authors, loosely form their 
special interest communities; where they share thoughts, 
express opinions, debate ideas, and offer suggestions 
interactively. Blogosphere provides a conducive platform to 
build virtual communities of special interests. It reshapes 
business models [4], assists viral marketing [5], provides 
trend analysis and sales prediction [6][7], aids counter-
terrorism effort [8], and acts as grassroots information 
sources [9]. 
A typical blog has different posts written by one author 
or multiple authors on various topics of interests or 
activities/events occurring around the world. Blogs and other 
similar participatory media afford democratic spaces for 
people to discuss and share views that may not be endorsed 
by mainstream media or even traditional journalism. 
Additionally, the commentaries or discussions are kept for 
others to view and contribute further. All these features make 
blogs a great platform for supporting citizen journalism 
initiatives. Such initiatives are essential for the democratic 
processes of production, dissemination, and reception of 
news. However, one need not look farther than the current 
political climate to comprehend the dangers of the freedom 
of the Internet. Blogging and other participatory media have 
been strategically used to disseminate falsehoods, rumors, 
and gossips, to provoke hysteria, or even delegitimize 
governments [10][11]. Therefore, it is important to 
understand 
the 
blogosphere; 
to 
explore 
information 
consumption behavior of individuals, and moreover, to shed 
insights on how misinformation originates and spreads. 
Analyzing blogs data help in understanding the pulse of a 
society, knowing what resonates with a community, and 
recognizing grievances of a group, among other reasons. 
Since blogs have no limit on the space available for 
expressing and/or discussing a topic of interest, blogs 
improve quality and inclusiveness of discourse and serve as a 
place for developing narratives. Blogs also provide a 
convenient platform to develop situational awareness during 
a socio-political crisis or humanitarian crisis in a conflict-
torn region or a natural disaster struck area. While 'big' social 
data, especially blogs, offer promise for analysis and 
situational understanding [12], it also imposes significant 
challenges. Some of the challenges impacting this area of 
research are: architectural and collection issues, keeping the 
data up to date, processing requirements, data storage, 
privacy considerations, incongruities of data forms and 
scales, trustworthiness and reliability of the source material, 
and vastly varied availability of data, etc. This paper 
addresses key challenges pertaining to architectural and data 
collection issues, data cleaning, data processing, and 
analyzing and extracting actionable insights from blog 
datasets. The blog datasets discussed in this paper are made 
publicly available for researchers and practitioners through 
the Blogtrackers tool [13].

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the current state of blog data collection. Section III 
describes the methodology for blog data collection and 
curation. Section IV explains the data collected. In Section 
V, we demonstrate the importance of blog data analysis 
using Blogtrackers tool through a real-world case study. We 
conclude with intended future work in Section VI. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
Despite the recent growth in the area of blog mining, 
several studies have been conducted to analyze how blog 
data can be effectively collected. Aschenbrenner and Miksch 
[14] study the development of mining techniques in a 
corporate environment. Their study shows a significant risk 
of failure due to the amount of open questions and 
misinformation currently available [14]. Tadanobu et al. 
analyzed various aspects of blog reading behavior [15]. The 
vast amounts of publicly available blogs have made it 
impossible to keep track of all of them [14]. Hence, there is a 
need for creating usable tools for extraction of vital 
information from the blogosphere. 
There are some tools that were developed to analyze 
blogs data, but these attempts have been discontinued, such 
as: 1)BlogPulse which was developed by IntelliSeek. It was 
developed to provide search and analytic capabilities, 
automated web discovery for blogs, show the trends of 
information, and monitor the daily activity on weblogs. This 
tool was discontinued in 2012 [16][17]. 2)Blogdex was 
another service that has been discontinued; it provided a 
resource for understanding hot-button issues in the 
blogosphere. 3)BlogScope, was another blog tracking service 
developed as a research project in the department of 
computer science in university of Toronto, provided blog 
analytics and visualizations but was shut down in early 2012 
[18][19]. 4)Technorati was originally launched as a blog 
index and search engine. It used a proprietary search and 
ranking algorithm to provide a rich directory of blogs sorted 
by content type and authority [20][21]. However, it did not 
provide blog monitoring or analytical capabilities to the end 
users. Furthermore, blog index and data is not available 
publicly to the researchers or practitioners community. The 
service now offers advertising platform to allow publishers 
to maximize their revenues without complications. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
To collect and store data, it is important to first identify a 
structure. After examining several blogs, we have identified 
a few common attributes such as: title, author, date of 
posting, actual post, permalink, and number of comments 
that almost all blogs have. We extract all these attributes 
while crawling each blog site.  
For crawling blogs data, we setup crawler(s) for each 
blog site to extract all the required attributes. There are three 
main steps in crawling data from a blog site – (1) exploring 
the blog site, (2) crawling the blog site, and (3) cleaning and 
storing the data in a database for analysis and retrieval. 
Figure 1 shows the flow of the data crawling process. 
 
Figure 1: Data crawling process 
A. Exploring the blog site 
To train crawler(s) for a blog site, it is important to first 
study the structure of the blog site and understand the 
following:  
• 
Type of blog site: 
o 
Blog on main stream media/journalist 
o 
Single author or multi-author blogs 
o 
Hobbyist blogger vs. professional blogger 
o 
Forum 
• 
Site Owner(s) 
• 
Sections of the site: 
o 
Archive 
o 
Topics 
or 
categories 
(e.g., 
news, 
entertainment, sports, politics, etc.) 
• 
Language(s) of the site (inferred using AlchemyAPI 
[22]) 
• 
Web content structure: 
o 
Title of blog post 
o 
Author of blog post 
o 
Date of posting 
o 
Actual post/content of the post 
o 
Comments section 
o 
Tags 
• 
Geographical location of the site (inferred using the 
IP address of the blog site’s domain from Maltego 
[23]) 
• 
Description of the site 
• 
Site navigation: 
o 
To identify next post or next page, if the 
blog is paginated 
o 
Search option for finding precise data. 
These explorations will help us train our crawler to 
collect valid data and analyze them for gaining insights. 
B. Crawling the data 
Currently, we are using Web Content Extractor (WCE) 
tool for data collection. With this software, we train a 
crawler to extract data from blog sites efficiently. Figure 2 is 
a screenshot of the WCE. 
To train the crawler, we first provide the starting or seed 
URLs. For example, the home page of a blog site or URL of 
the search page of a specific topic or section/s of a website. 
Then, we train the crawler to navigate to each blog post on 
the seed URLs as well as to the next page or older posts. 
Then, we take a sample post and define all the attributes we 
36

IMMM 2017 : The Seventh International Conference on Advances in Information Mining and Management

want to collect through WCE. Here, we need to carefully 
select the portion of the post to avoid noises. When all the 
attributes are selected, WCE is ready to run for collecting the 
data. 
 
Figure 2: Web Content extractor 
C. Cleaning and Storing of Data 
Web crawling doesn’t always give us clean data. It 
almost always crawls some noise. Data cleaning is 
required before using the data for analysis. For this, we 
follow a three-step cleaning process: 
• 
Step 1- Cleaning from WCE: Deleting the empty 
fields and advertisement URLs. Later, the data is 
stored into a temporary database. 
• 
Step 2- Cleaning by SQL Queries: Using SQL 
(Structured Query Language) to select validated and 
verified data from the temporary database. This step 
helps in removing the noise left unfiltered from 
previous step. 
• 
Step 3- Cleaning by Script: In this step, a major part 
of cleaning along with data processing, metadata 
extraction, and data standardization is done. We 
exclude any possible noise and standardize attributes 
like date of posting. Followed by extracting 
metadata such as sentiments using LIWC (Linguistic 
Inquiry and Word Count) [24][25], outbound URLs, 
entities and their types, language of the post, proper 
author name etc. This is all performed before 
pushing the clean data into Blogtrackers database for 
analysis.  
D. Challenges 
Some of the challenges that we face during blog crawling 
process are: 
• 
Changing blog structure – Blog site owners can 
change their blog structure any time and the crawler 
trained for one structure does not work for the other. 
This causes us to repeat the effort of training the 
crawler for the new structure of blog site. 
• 
Noises – Irrespective of how well a crawler is 
trained, noise is always crawled. Social media 
plugins (such as Facebook share plugins, Twitter 
share plugins, etc.) and advertisements from the blog 
site could be crawled as JavaScript. 
• 
Limitations of WCE – WCE sometimes fails to crawl 
dynamic pages that are loaded using JavaScript. 
IV. 
DATA STATISTICS 
Following the methodology proposed in Section III, we 
have crawled 194 blog sites, at the time of writing this paper 
and more blogs are being crawled. Blogs have been crawled 
for Ukraine-Russia Conflict, anti-NATO (the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization) narratives, migrant crisis in the 
European Union, and the fake news blogs in the Baltic 
States. Below, we provide details for each dataset:  
A. Ukraine-Russia Conflict 
This blog dataset was collected from mid 2014 to mid 
2016, during the political and military tension between 
Ukraine and Russia. A total of 57 blogs discussing the 
conflict were crawled. Tables 1 and 2 give location and 
language statistics for this dataset. Some blogs may have 
posts in more than one language.

B. Anti-NATO 
NATO’s support of Ukraine during the Ukraine-Russia 
conflict caused an increase in the anti NATO narratives in 
the blogs and this sentiment was also observed during 
various exercises conducted by NATO (such as, Trident 
Juncture 2015, Brilliant Jump 2016, and Anakonda 2016). 
We crawled 70 blogs that had an anti-NATO propaganda 
from mid 2015 to late 2016. Tables 3 and 4 give statistics 
for this dataset.

C. EU migrant crisis 
Due to the conflict in Eastern Europe and Middle East 
during late 2015 and 2016, many people were migrating 
from war torn regions to stable regions in Europe. This 
dataset was collected in early 2016 during the height of 
migrant crisis in Europe. Tables 5 and 6 give statistics for 
this dataset.

D. Fake News Blogs in Baltic States 
There is a rising concern for fake news. Subject matter 
experts had identified 26 fake news blogs from the Baltic 
States, especially of Latvian, Estonian or Lithuanian origin 
suspected for disseminating fake news. We crawled 16667 
blog posts from 21 blogs. This dataset was collected in early 
2017. Tables 7 and 8 give basic statistics for this dataset.

DATA ANALYSIS 
Blogs provide immense amount of content that can be 
analyzed to extract insights and sometimes gain situational 
awareness during conflicts. In this section, we explain the 
importance of analyzing blog data by extracting insights 
from our in-house developed tool, Blogtrackers (available for 
public use [13]).   
We used Blogtrackers to understand the anti-NATO 
narratives disseminated in blogs during the NATO’s Trident 
Juncture exercise conducted in October 2015. We started 
exploring our anti-NATO blogs dataset by studying the 
posting trends for the year 2015. Figure 3 is the posting 
frequency chart generated by Blogtrackers for the said 
period. We observed an increase in activity during August 
2015 – December 2015, roughly 2 months before and after 
the exercise. 
 
Figure 3: Posting Frequency of Anti-NATO blogs from January 2015 to 
December 2015. 
We generated sentiment trends to understand the overall 
tonality of the bloggers’ postings during this period. Figure 4 
is the sentiment trend generated by Blogtrackers for the said 
period. We found that the sentiment was majorly positive up 
until the exercise, i.e., October 2015, and negative after the 
exercise, demonstrating that bloggers did not see the exercise 
in a good light. There was a strong anti-NATO sentiment 
stemming from anti-NATO propaganda. 
 
Figure 4: Sentiment trend from January 2015 to December 2015 for Anti-
NATO blogs 
We also generated the influence trend to understand the 
variation of blogger’s influence over the community. This is 
helpful to know how the narratives in blogosphere resonated 
with the readers. Influence score for each blog post is based 
on the chatter it generates in the blogosphere. It is computed 
using the amount of discussion it generated (comments) and 
outbound URLs [26][27]. Influence of a blogger is assessed 
by how influential his/her posts are. Figure 5 is the influence 
trend of the top 5 (influential) bloggers in the said period. 
 
 
Figure 5: Influence trend for top 5 bloggers 
 
 
Figure 6: Blog browser showing the most influential blog post. 
 
From the trend chart in Figure 5, we identified 
NoBordersard was the most influential. As depicted in 
Figure 6, we used blog browser feature of Blogtrackers to 
know what has influenced the community. We found a blog 
post written by NoBordersard in Italian was calling for civil 
disobedience march against the NATO exercise. This blog 
post generated a considerable amount of chatter and had the 
highest influence. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 This article presents a novel approach on blog data 
collection. Currently, the approach followed is to - manually 
collect, clean and save blog data to relational databases for 
further analysis. This is helpful in many ways to benefit the 
user with the process of carefully analyzing the blog site 
structure and its changing nature, noises, and myriad other 
challenges. Obtaining a cleaner blog data sample is an 
extremely time consuming process and involves significant 
human intervention. Understandably, this is not a scalable 
approach, given the speed with which the blogosphere is 
expanding. Therefore, we are developing an automated 
crawling mechanism to overcome the challenges presented 
by blog data collection thereby significantly increasing the 
efficiency of the overall process from data to decisions. 
The article also presented a case study on how 
Blogtrackers, tool for analyzing blogs, had sift through more 
than 60,000 blog posts from 70 anti-NATO blogs to identify 
39

a blog post calling for civil disobedience; explaining the     
significance of studying blogs in analyzing information 
dissemination through social media to identify blogs and 
bloggers calling for deviant activities. Going further, we 
would like to add content analysis features to Blogtrackers, 
such as: topic modeling, network analysis, and cyber 
forensics features, to not only study blogs individually, but 
also to understand their coordination structure and 
information dissemination structure.
