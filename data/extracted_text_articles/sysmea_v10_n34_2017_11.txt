Abstract — The development of room-temperature gas sensors 
for nitrogen dioxide gases is of great importance for air quality 
monitoring due to unhealthy impact on human life and 
environment. In this work, we focus on Aluminum-doped Zinc 
Oxide sensing properties. We compare nitrogen dioxide 
detection at room temperature in dark and under ultraviolet 
or blue illuminations. Working temperature from 25°C up to 
100°C have been also performed in dark and under UV and 
blue Light Emitted Diodes. Aluminum-doped Zinc Oxide 
nanoparticles have been deposited by drop coating from 
colloidal solution as sensitive layer for air quality monitoring 
on Si/SiO2 substrate. Herein, a brief description of the process 
steps will be provided. We demonstrate that UV light and 
temperature enhance gas-sensing properties with good 
reversibility and repeatability.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from vehicles, power 
plants, industrial emissions and off-road sources, such as 
construction, lawn and gardening equipment. It is one of the 
most dangerous air pollutants. It plays a major role in the 
formation of ozone and acid rain. Continued or frequent 
exposure to NO2 concentrations higher than 0.15 ppm may 
cause incidence of acute respiratory. To detect NO2, 
resistive gas sensors are the most attractive due to easy 
fabrication, simple operation, low production cost and 
miniaturization. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a wide band gap (about 
3.37 eV at room temperature) II–IV n-type semiconductor 
that has many applications. It is one of the best candidates 
for air quality monitoring having large accessibility for the 
targeted gases. Moreover, doping is one possible way to 
improve the sensibility of the ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). 
ZnO is usually doped with small amounts of metal ions, 
such as Al, Ga, etc. We have recently reported our 
preliminary work on room temperature NO2 detection 
achieved by Aluminum-doped Zinc Oxide (Al-ZnO) 
sensitive layer on Si/SiO2 substrate enhanced by UltraViolet 
(UV) light [1]. Al-ZnO can be produced as nanoparticles 
and keep the same advantages as ZnO NPs in terms of layer 
processing. However, its conductivity can be three orders of 
magnitudes higher [2].  Operating at room temperature is 
interesting for working in explosive environment and also 
with flexible substrate to fit any shape needed on smart 
objects. In literature, several technics have been described to 
decrease the operating temperature and improve the 
sensitivity and stability of metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors, 
such as noble metal doping [3], transition metal oxide 
incorporation [4-5], light activation [6-8]. Among them, 
adding UV light at ZnO surface is the most studied to 
achieve room temperature sensitivity [9-12].  
Recently, Prof. Zhang’s team has reported that visible light 
illumination can greatly enhance the NO2 sensing 
performance of sensors performed with solution precursor 
plasma spray (SPPS) of n-n heterojunctions formed between 
SnO1-α, ZnO1-β and SnO2-γ [13]. However, SPPS is a 
process with ultra-high heating temperatures. In this work, 
we used low temperature process and we achieved NO2 
detection at temperatures not higher than 100°C to be 
compatible with most of flexible substrate aging. These 
detections have been made under UV activation by Al-ZnO 
NPs deposited on interdigitated electrodes fabricated on 
Si/SiO2 substrate using photolithography. In Section II, the 
Al-ZnO solution process will be described and the results 
will be discussed in Section III. 
II. 
DESCRIPTION OF APPROACH AND 
TECHNIQUES  
This description is composed of two parts, one is the 
sensing film fabrication; the other is the measurement 
system set-up.  
A. Al-ZnO solution 
In order to maintain a cost efficient integration process, 
solution based materials are used as they show an 
outstanding tradeoff between cost and system complexity. 
The use of a nanoparticle dispersion of the ZnO 
semiconducting material doped by aluminum avoids most of 
the issues related to temperature. It is an attractive method

for the following reasons: good homogeneity, ease of 
composition control, and large area coatings with cost 
effective processes. Al-ZnO (or AZO) NPs were prepared 
following procedures described previously [14,15]. In a 
typical experiment, Al-ZnO NPs were produced by adding 
zinc acetate, aluminum isopropylate and distilled water into 
a flask containing anhydrous ethanol. After heating at 80°C, 
potassium hydroxide dispersed in ethanol was added 
dropwise to the flask, and heating was kept at 80°C during 
16h. The as-synthesized Al-ZnO NPs were washed by 
centrifugation. By controlling the initial ratio of the 
aluminum to zinc precursor during synthesis while keeping 
constant all the other parameters, a precise control of Al 
doping content (atomic percentage, at.%) can be obtained. 
In the present study, Al-ZnO NPs with 0.8 at.% Al doping 
level have been synthesized. Size distribution of the NPs 
within the solutions was determined with Dynamic Light 
Scattering methods (DLS) using a NanoZetaSizer from 
Malvern. 
The 
solution-processable 
dispersions 
were 
prepared by transferring the synthesized Al-ZnO NPs from 
alcohol solutions to isopropanol at constant concentrations 
of 30 mg.mL-1. Additionally, cluster-free dispersion of Al-
ZnO NPs was obtained in isopropanol by using 0.2 vol.% of 
ethanol amine (EA) as surfactant [14]. EA is a small organic 
molecule giving high dispersions in alcohols and avoiding 
the need of bulky or long surfactants.  
Morphological study of Al-ZnO NPs was carried out by 
the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-
TEM) JEOL 3010, where samples were prepared by drop 
casting of diluted solution on a mesh-coated carbon film. 
Fig. 1 shows the EA-modified Al-ZnO NPs disperse in 
solution, which is not a complete translucent solution due to 
the Al doping.  A typical Transmission Electron Microscopy 
(TEM) image of this Al-ZnO nanocrystals is shown on the 
right side of the Fig. 1, evidencing their size (diameter about 
10 nm) and homogeneous size and shape dispersions.

(Al-ZnO NPs with 0.8 at.% of Al et 0.2 vol.% of EA) and TEM image of 
Al-ZnO nanocrystals drop-casted on a TEM grid [1]. 
Microstructure of thin films has been investigated using 
high-resolution scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM 
6320F). SEM micrographs were made on top sections on 
NPs-based thin films deposited on silicon substrates covered 
with 300 nm thick SiO2 dielectric layers. In order to get 
details in microstructure of thin films, solutions containing 
NPs in isopropanol were deposited by spin-coating on SiO2 
substrates following by a thermal post-treatment at 150°C 
for 30 min. With a boiling point (Tbp) of 82.6°C for 
isopropanol, solvent molecules were completely evaporated 
for annealing temperature reaching 150°C, but the EA 
surfactant molecules stayed adsorbed on the surface of NPs 
(Tbp = 170°C for EA) [16].  Previous analyses have shown 
that the Al-ZnO nanocrystals are monocrystalline with a 
classical wurtzite structure [14]. Starting from a dispersion 
state (i.e., the ink), the resulting solid states will depend not 
only on the chemical parameters of the materials but also on 
physical parameters such as deposition technique, substrate, 
drying 
process, 
thermal 
post-annealing, 
etc. 
The 
implementation and characterization of solution-processed 
gas sensors by drop casting or spin-coating require the thin 
film characterization. The morphological properties of the 
AZO thin films grown on SiO2 substrates were examined by 
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). 
Fig. 2 shows SEM images of Al-ZnO thin films 
deposited by spin coating with a speed of 2000 rpm/min 
during 30 s.

annealed onto a preheated hotplate at 150°C for 30 min as a 
post-treatment in a nitrogen-filled glove box.

Fig. 2 shows the surface uniformity of Al-ZnO thin films 
on a large scale and a smaller scale. Small agglomerates, 
with a diameter of 15-25 nm, uniformly and densely 
dispersed on the surface were formed. By drop coating, Al-
ZnO NPs entirely cover the substrate surface but with a less 
uniform morphology where the presence of tightly packed 
grains is observed. In both case, the free-spaces between 
NPs offer a high surface-area-to-volume-ratio to the thin 
film. Such surface structure gives a porous property to the 
thin films where gas molecules can diffuse in the volume 
structure. 
B. Gas sensors and set up 
The gas sensing properties of Al-ZnO films were 
investigated in a sealed stainless test cell to control the 
substrate temperature and NO2 concentrations. Our gas 
sensor consists of Ti/Pt interdigitated electrodes for gas 
detection. Temperature can be controlled underneath to 
improve the gas detection. The metal electrodes Ti/Pt were 
deposited on Si/SiO2 by magnetron sputtering with 
thicknesses of 5 and 100 nm, respectively. In this work, Al-
ZnO nanoparticles were deposited by drop coating. They 
were used as sensitive material with thickness of 200±10 nm 
measured by a Dektak 6M stylus profiler. The Al-ZnO films 
obtained were annealed for 30 min at 150°C for removing 
solvents and improving their quality and stability. The aim 
was to study the possible use, in a future work, on flexible 
substrates, which do not allow high temperature process. In 
order to find the best operating conditions, the gas sensing 
properties of Al-ZnO films were investigated in a sealed 
stainless test cell to control the substrate temperature and 
NO2 concentrations. The measurements were made keeping 
in mind that the maximum NO2 concentration is 100 ppb for 
1h exposure and 75 ppb per day [17]. Dry air was used as 
both the reference and the carrier gas maintaining a constant 
total flow of 500 standard cubic centimeters per minute 
(SCCM) via mass flow controllers. The sensor was exposed 
to dry air (i.e. 0% relative humidity) with different 
concentrations of NO2 (0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 ppm) during 30 s 
and finally exposed to a clean dry airflow for recovery. The 
dry air and NO2 gas were blown directly onto the sample 
placed on a heated holder. The applied DC voltage was 0.1 
V. The electrical resistance was measured using a Keithley 
(model 2450) source-meter connected to a computer with a 
homemade program. Gas response of the sensor is defined 
by (1) as the ratio of the resistance change on the surface of 
the gas sensor before and after being exposed to NO2: 
R= RNO2 / Rdry air                               (1)  
where RNO2 is the sensor resistance in presence of NO2 and 
Rdry air is the sensor resistance through dry air flow. 
The time exposure was fixed to 30s. Even if this time 
not allows reaching the sensor saturation, sufficient changes 
in resistance can be observed to extract information about 
the gas detection. The sensor response time is defined as the 
time required for a change in the sample's electrical 
resistance to reach 90% of the initial value when exposed to 
ozone gas. In the same way, the recovery time is defined as 
the time required for the electrical resistance of the sensor to 
return 90% of the initial value after turning off the NO2 gas. 
Several preliminary tests on conductivity change have been 
made using blue, red, UV, and green Light Emitted Diode 
(LED) under dry airflow without gas. The highest 
conductivity improvements have been obtained with UV 
LED. Gas sensing measurements under UV-light irradiation 
were performed using a UV-LED (Ref. UV5TZ-390-30 
peak wavelength of 390 nm). Respectively, the blue LED 
(Ref. 247-1690, peak wavelength of 430 nm) was used with 
the same power than the UV one fixed at 60 mW. The 
distance between one LED and the sensing material is an 
important parameter. In our homemade test cell, this 
distance can be adjusted to obtain the higher conductivity 
under dry airflow than kept it constant during the gas 
detection. Measurement system pictures for testing gas 
sensors under UV light are given in Fig. 3.

Before measurements, the sample was illuminated for 60 
min with the chosen LED under dry air 500 SCCM, to 
stabilize the electrical resistance.  
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The gas sensor fabricated with Al-ZnO nanoparticles as 
sensitive material and deposited by drop coating on Si/SiO2 
substrate is presented in Fig. 4.

The sample studied here was initially exposed to NO2 at 
room temperature (at 25°C) without any illumination. As 
can be seen in Fig. 5, low resistance increases were 
observed without recovery. In the presence of gases, the 
electrical conductivity of semiconductor film sensor 
changes due to two main reactions occurring on the surface. 
The gas response is related to the number of oxygen ions 
adsorbed on the film surface. In n-type semiconductors, the 
majority charge carriers are electrons. When they are 
exposed to an oxidizing gas a decrease of conductivity 
occurs. After the gas is absorbed on the ZnO surface, the O 
atoms of oxidative gas molecules extract the electrons from 
the ZnO nanostructure; consequently, the depletion layer 
becomes thicker due to the decreasing of the carrier 
concentration [18].

At temperatures less than 150°C, the ionic species O2 are 
dominant. These O2 species contribute to form a high-
resistance depletion layer in the NPs surfaces, increasing 
electrical resistance in the nanoparticles. Moreover, more 
oxygen vacancy related defects are introduced by Al doping, 
which increase the surface depletion thickness and the 
potential barrier height at the contact [19]. First, when the 
Al-ZnO NPs are exposed to an air atmosphere, oxygen 
molecules are adsorbed on the different surfaces. These 
oxygen molecules capture free electrons from the ZnO 
conduction band, forming ionized oxygen anions. Then, 
when Al-ZnO NPs gets exposed to NO2 (a typical oxidizing 
gas), the NO2 gas molecules adsorb on the Al-ZnO NPs 
surface, implying the formation of an electron-depletion 
layer due to adsorption of ions, which increases the potential 
barrier and diminishes Al-ZnO NPs conductivity. However, 
this last reaction needs enough energy to occur and the gas 
desorption is not possible at room temperature due to a lack 
of energy. When the NPs are exposed to UV irradiation (3.3 
eV), electron–hole pairs are photogenerated ((e-) + (h+)) in 
the Al-ZnO NPs surface. The photogenerated holes (h+) 
could migrate to the Al-ZnO NPs surface, and O2 species 
photodesorbed. As consequence, the depletion layer is 
diminished and the remaining unpaired electrons contribute 
to an increase in the electrical conductivity. Upon exposure 
to NO2 gas, NO2 molecules adsorb on the Al-ZnO NPs 
surfaces. This reaction widens the depletion-layer in the Al-
ZnO NPs surface, and consequently, the electrical resistance 
is increased when the sensing material is exposed to NO2 
gas, as shown in Fig. 5 at room temperature without 
humidity. Fig. 6 presents a comparison between the sensor 
responses without and with light illumination at room 
temperature for the NO2 concentrations used in this work.

Under continuous UV illumination, the interaction 
between NO2 and Al-ZnO NPs is enhanced over than 
without UV light due to the abundant photo generated free 
electrons.  
The responses plotted in Fig. 7a at 25°C under UV light, 
demonstrate the total reversibility and good stability of the 
base line. However, about 45 minutes are needed to return 
to the baseline. The responses plotted in Fig. 7b at 25°C 
under a blue LED show great amplitude improvements but 
the return times were three times longer compare to the 
return times obtained under a UV LED.

Heating excitations were also tested up to 100°C in dark 
and under UV and blue illuminations. In dark, at 25°C and 
50°C the resistance increases were observed without 
recovery. From 75°C in dark, the resistance returns to its 
reference value obtained through dry airflow for 1 and 2 
ppm. At an operating temperature equals to 100°C the 
response is slightly higher than at 75°C, however, the 
recovery was observed for all concentrations. Fig. 8 shows 
responses in dark for 0.2 ppm to 2 ppm of NO2 at 100°C. 
The response and the recovery time were improved by the 
heating excitation.

To decrease the recovery time under light illuminations, 
temperature excitation is required. Indeed, the heating 
temperatures improve the chemical reactions at the sensitive 
surface layer. The response amplitudes were therefore 
enhanced for the four tested concentrations under UV light. 
Fig. 9a presents the best response in terms of amplitudes 
and recovery times obtained at 100°C under UV 
illumination for 0.2 ppm to 2 ppm of NO2. Fig. 9b 
highlights that the amplitude responses were greatly 
improved at 100°C by the blue light compare to the 
measurements performed in dark or under UV LED at this 
temperature. Nevertheless, the return times were around five 
times longer than the return times obtained under UV 
illumination.

Under UV illumination, the results obtained show fast

reversibility without sensor saturation. By increasing the 
temperature up to 100°C, the response amplitude for 2 ppm 
under the UV LEDt was multiplied by 200 at least and the 
time to return to the baseline was divided by 10.

IV. CONCLUSION  
This paper reports nitrogen dioxide (NO2) detection at 
temperature up to 100°C. Room temperature NO2 detection 
have been achieved by sensors on rigid substrate and 
improved with one UV Light Emitted Diode illumination. 
The gas measurements in our experiments under UV 
showed good responses with fast response and return times 
towards NO2 even at 0.2 ppm. The photogenerated charge 
carriers (electrons and holes) present important benefits for 
working at low temperatures. UV light illumination results 
in an increase in the response signal, enhanced sensing 
reversibility, and an enhanced recovery rate at 100°C with 
good repeatability. It is open a new way to use Al-ZnO 
nanoparticles as sensitive layer for gas sensor devices on 
flexible substrates.
