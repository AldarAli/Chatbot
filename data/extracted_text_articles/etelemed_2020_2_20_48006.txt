Abstract— People with diseases, such as hemiplegia, and latter-
stage elderly people often have a walking disability, which
increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. The
magnitude of the angle velocity during the kicking the floor
phase (raising the heel) and swinging the toe forward phase of
walking is lower for disabled people than for healthy persons
due to lower muscle power. We have developed a spring assist
unit that fits in the heel of a shoe and helps disabled people
raise their heel when beginning to walk. Experimental results
demonstrated that it substantially assists gait walking, that
there is a correlation between body weight and optimal spring
stiffness, and that the spring assist unit does not affect the
person’s walking posture.

INTRODUCTION
As the percentage of elderly people in the world’s
population is increasing [1], the number of functionally
impaired people, such as those with hemiplegia, will also
increase. People with such diseases, or latter-stage elderly,
often have walking disabilities, which increase their risk of
falling, and consequently injuring themselves [2].
Our study of comparing the walking gait between
hemiplegia patients and healthy students shows that the
magnitude of the angle velocity during the kicking the floor
phase (raising the heel) and swinging the toe forward phase
of walking is lower for disabled people than for healthy
persons; this is because of the lower muscle power for
hemiplegia patients compared to the healthy students [3].
This means that assisting with raising the heel and swinging
the toe forward while walking could help disabled people
and could enable them to have a close to normal gait.
The Solid-Ankle Cushion Heel (SACH) foot (e.g., 1D10,
Ottobock, Germany) [4]) and the Energy Storage And
Return (ESAR) foot (e.g., Vari-Flex, Össur, Iceland) [5]) are
provided for foot amputees to improves their gait so that it
is close to a normal gait. They help the wearer raise their
heels and take their toes off. Unfortunately, such prostheses
cannot assist walking disabilities.
We previously developed a prototype shoe in which a
coil spring was built into the heel part of the shoe, and a leaf
spring was built into the half backward of sole. Experimental
results demonstrated that it reduced the magnitude of muscle
power needed to raise the heels and swing the toes forward.
They also demonstrated that there would be a correlation
between body weight and optimal spring stiffness, and that
the spring assist unit would affect walking posture.
We have now developed a spring assist unit that is built
into the heel of a shoe. Experimental results using springs
with four different degrees of stiffness demonstrated that
there was surely a correlation between body weight and
optimal spring stiffness, and that the unit did not affect
walking posture, unlike the prototype shoe. This means that
the assist unit does not have any negative effects.
After introducing two kinds of foot prosthesis, the SACH
and ESAR feet, in Section II, we describe in Section III the
differences in gait between a hemiplegia patient and a
healthy person to clarify the characteristics that need to be
addressed. A prototype shoe into which a coil spring and a
leaf spring are built and the experimental results are
described in Section IV. The structure of the spring assist
unit and the experimental results are described in Section V.
Section VI concludes with a summary of the key points.
II.
WALKING ASSISTANCE MECHANISM IN PASSIVE FOOT
PROSTHESIS
Since there are no walking assistance devices for
walking disabilities, such as latter-stage elderly people and
hemiplegia patients, walking assistance devices for foot
prosthesis are introduced in this section. There are two types
of walking assistance mechanisms in passive foot prosthesis.
The SACH foot [6], shown in Figure 1, was designed to
provide shock absorption and ankle action characteristics
close to those of a normal ankle without the use of an
articulated ankle joint. The action of the SACH foot is
achieved by the use of two functional elements: a properly
shaped wedge of cushioning material built into the heel and
an internal structural core or keel shaped at the ball of the
foot to provide a rocker action. Its primitive form was
developed toward the end of the 1800s.
The ESAR foot, shown in Figure 2, has weak push-off
power and adequate roll-over shape of the foot, which
increases the energy dissipated during the step-to-step
transition in gait. Wezenberg et al. reported that the ESAR
foot was more effective than the SACH foot in reducing
metabolic energy while walking [7], and Houdijk reported
that it improved the step length symmetry [8].

III.
DIFFERENCES IN GAIT BETWEEN HEMIPLEGIA PATIENT
AND HEALTHY PERSON
We analyzed the walking gait cycles of unimpaired
people and those with disabilities to walk using a Wearable
Device (WD) and a KINECT to detect warning signs of falls
[3]. Every walking disability in this experiment had one-side
paralysis, and trained periodically at a rehabilitation facility.
We
experimentally
measured
the
output
data
of
an
acceleration sensor and gyroscope sensor in a WD mounted
on the front of a shoe to estimate the kicking power and
change of angle between a foot and the floor as shown in
Figure 3. In this measurement, Smart watch 3, SONY was
used as a WD.
Figures
4
and
5
show
examples
of
changes
in
acceleration, angle velocity, and angle for an unimpaired
participant and one with a walking disability, respectively.
Data for two steps are plotted. Each flat period (roughly the
center period) in these figures represents when the entire
shoe sole touched the floor. The maximum angle velocity at
timing A indicates the kicking power when raising the heel,
and the minimum angle at timing B indicates the angle to
the floor at terminal swing.
The lower angle velocity at A in Figure 4 is about 420
deg./sec. On the other hand, the higher angle velocity at A
in Figure 5 is about 250 deg./sec. Thus, the participant with
a walking disability clearly has a weaker kicking power
when
raising
their
heel
compared
with
that
of
the
unimpaired participant, indicating a clear difference in terms
of gait.
The higher angle at B in Figure 4 is about -18 deg. On
the other hand, the lower angle at B in Figure 5 is about -8
deg. And, the swinging speed of walking disability is slower
than that of healthy participant. Thus, the participant with a
walking disability expressed difficultly when raising their
toe at the terminal swing phase.

between them in the angle at timing B; however, this value
would have sometimes overlapped each other.
IV.
PROTOTYPE OF SHOE TO ASSIST PEOPLE WITH
WALKING DISABILITIES
As described in Section III, people with a walking
disability, such as those who suffer from hemiplegia, clearly
have a weaker kicking power when raising their heel and
swing power when swinging their toe forward. We have
developed a shoe, shown in Figure 6, that assists with
walking disabilities. This shoe has a coil spring and leaf
spring to enable a user to easily raise their heel. The spring
force of the coil spring is 15 kg. The shoe has a roller to
avoid the toe accidentally tripping.
We compare the kicking power (angle velocity) when
the heel is raised between a normal shoe and our proposed
assist shoe worn by a stroke patient. The data is shown in
Figure 7. The kicking power with the assist shoe is lower
and more stable than that with a normal shoe.
We then measured a group of 8 students who were asked
to walk as if they had a disability while wearing a normal
shoe and the assist shoe. Measured data is shown in Figure 8.
In every participant except one, their kicking power with the
assist shoe was lower and more stable than that with the
normal shoe. Authors also examined, and sensed that the
shoe compensated to raise their foot slower with weaker
power than the normal shoe and its compensation power
was stable. Measured data in Figures 7 and 8 indicate the
above senses.
We measured the integrated ElectroMyoGram (iEMG)
readings for two walking disabilities to confirm the effect of
the assist shoe. We used the wireless EMG logger from
Logical Product Corporation [9]. The wireless EMG sensors
were attached to the gastrocnemius of the right leg as shown
in Figure 9. The sampling rate was 500 Hz. Measured data
is shown in Figure 10. The results for the assist shoe are
lower than those with a normal shoe for both people. The
compensation effect of the proposed assist shoe is also
confirmed with the iEMG.

It is clear that the proposed shoe compensates for muscle
weakness. However, most evaluators including authors felt
that the timing to generate a spring reaction force is too
early to walk smoothly; the timing at which the knee comes
out in front of the ankle is best, and they had to change their
gait motion to use a spring power effectively. And, we
noticed that there would be a correlation between the body
weight and most effective spring power, and would affect
the walking posture.
The prototype shoe has a toe roller. However, as it is
difficult to have walking disabilities intentionally trip over
an obstacle, we could not quantitatively evaluate it.
V.
SPRING ASSIST UNIT FOR WALKING DISABLED PEOPLE
A.
Structure
As described in Section IV, every participant felt that the
timing for generating spring reaction force was too early for
walking smoothly. We thus focused on clarifying the
correlation
between
body
weight
and
optimal
spring
stiffness; the effect on walking posture; and developed the
spring assist unit shown in Figure 11. Its mechanism is very
simple as it comprises only a conical coil spring and a V-
shaped attachment cover. We adopt the conical spring to be
thinner when stepping on of which spring power is 3, 5, 9,
and 11 Kg. The attachment cover is made of thin stainless
steel.
Figure 11. Two views of spring assist unit (heel-up spring).
B.
Assistance effect
The prototype assist shoe shown in Figure 6 had a coil
spring and a leaf spring and was made for the right foot. In
contrast, the spring assist unit shown in Figure 11 was built
into the heel part of the right and left shoes, as shown in
Figure 12. To measure the assistance effect, we had the
participants wear shoes with each of the spring stiffnesses
and walk straight for 6 m while we measured the iEMG. We
also measured the motions of the head and mid-hip to
analyze the effects on walking posture. Wireless EMG
sensors were attached to the gastrocnemius of the right leg,
as shown in Figure 9. The participant’s posture was
measured using a MS-Kinect [10]. The participants were ten
healthy students. In the near future, we plan to measure the
same data for persons with a walking disability.
Examples of the measured iEMG vs. spring stiffness for
two participants (A and B weighing 57 and 70 kg) are
shown in Figure 13. The iEMG values are lower for every
spring stiffness than without the spring assist unit. The value
was the lowest at the specified spring stiffness. The value
for Participant A was lowest at 5 kg, and that for B was
lowest at 9 kg. The spring stiffness at the lowest iEMG vs.
participant body weight is shown in Figure 14. The spring
stiffness magnitude at the lowest iEMG is linearly bigger, a
participant gets more weight.

The measured positions of the head and mid-hip for
Participant C are shown in Figure 15 for walking without a
spring assist unit and in Figure 16 for walking with the most
effective spring assist unit. The changes in the up and down
motion are shown in graph (a), and the changes in the right
and left motion are shown in graph (b). Without a spring
assist unit, the up and down motion of the head and mid-hip
clearly changes like a sine wave, as shown in (a) of Figure
15. The right and left motion of the head and mid-hip also
changes, but not clearly like a wave as shown in (b) of
Figure 15; and the cycle period does not differ from that of
the up and down motion. There are not big differences
between without a spring assist unit and with a spring assist
unit
The average range of each step’s peak in the right and
left motion (LR) and up and down motion (UD) for each
participant is shown in Table III. Although there are
differences between participants and spring stiffnesses, the
differences are random, with no obvious patterns.

A participant who tested the assist shoe shown in Figure
6 and the pair of assist shoes shown in Figure 12
commented that “I had to step on the shoe to walk smoothly
in the shoe shown in Figure 6, whereas I did not feel any
effect of the spring units when walking with the shoes
shown in Figure 12. I could walk smoothly without any
additional actions.”
We conclude that the spring assist unit does not affect
walking posture.
VI.
CONCLUSION
It is difficult for people with walking disabilities to raise
their heels because their muscle power is lower. Therefore,
most of them shuffle their feet when walking and sometimes
stumble over something and fall down. The spring assist
unit we developed for walking disabilities enables them to
easily raise their heels and walk smoothly. The iEMG was
measured to analyze the assistance effect. The iEMG values
for every spring stiffness were lower than those without the
spring assist unit. The iEMG value was the lowest at the
specified spring stiffness; the magnitude of the spring
stiffness at the lowest iEMG was linearly bigger and the
body weight was greater. These results demonstrate the
assistance effect of the spring assist unit and that there is a
linear correlation between body weight and the optimal
spring stiffness.
We also measured the position of the head and mid-hip
with and without the spring assist unit for spring stiffnesses
of 3, 5, 9, and 11 kg. There were differences among the
participants and among the spring powers, including no
spring. However, the differences were random, without any
obvious
patterns
between
them.
The
results
also
demonstrate that the spring assist unit does not affect
walking posture.
We would like to launch the commercial version in a
near future.
