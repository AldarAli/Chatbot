Abstract—Using ﬁrst principles density functional calculations,
the stability and structural properties Au@Ag and Ag@Au
core shell nanoparticles is explored. Our data shows that the
growth of Au shell layers on an Ag core nanoparticle is more
likely to happen than the growth of Ag shell layers on an Au
core nanoparticle. Our structural analysis indicates that lower
coordinated sites experience a bigger contraction when compared
to the metallic 12 coordinated sites. In addition, our structural
and energetic data for homonuclear Au and Ag nanoparticles
indicate that dispersion forces do not decisively inﬂuence these
properties.

INTRODUCTION
Metal nanoparticles (Nps) show size and shape-dependent
optical and electronic properties that are appreciable differ-
ent from those observed for bulk metals. These has lead
to extensive investigations involving metallic nanoparticles
as building blocks for nanoscale materials and devices. In
particular, gold and silver nanoparticles have been extensively
explored in a variety of ﬁelds, including catalysis, food in-
dustry, environmental conservation, ﬂuorescence biosensors,
glucose biosensors, nucleic acids-based biosensors, protein-
based biosensors, drug delivery vehicles and cancer therapeutic
agents [1].
Since gold presents high biocompatibility, chemical stabil-
ity, and easy surface modiﬁcation, it is often considered to be
more suitable for biomedical applications [1]. Silver, on the
other hand, presents higher plasmonic efﬁciency and superior
magnetic enhancement in the visible range and it is more
attractive for optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and sensing [1].
In order to combine these properties, a great deal of attention
has been devoted to the synthesis of core shell and alloy
bimetallic NPs. The main idea is to tune the NPs optical
catalytic properties and making them useful in other ﬁelds,
such as taggants for security applications [2].
The AuAg system is of particular interest since the Surface
Plasmon Resonance (SPR) band might be tunable between
∼520 nm for Au and ∼410 nm for Ag [2]. These interesting
physical and chemical properties appear because of the combi-
nation of two kinds of metals and their ﬁne structures, evolving
new surface characteristics. With a view to contribute to a
better understanding of the surface properties of these complex
systems, in this work we explore the stability and structural
properties Au@Ag and Ag@Au core shell NPs. In addition,
the inﬂuence of dispersion (van der Waals) interactions in the
core shell properties is also discussed.

core layers (gold atoms) and 3 silver shell layers (gray atoms), refered as

The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we brieﬂy
describe our theoretical approach. In Section III, our results
for Au@Ag and Ag@Au core shell NPs are discussed and
compared to available theoretical and experimental works.
Finally, a summary is presented in Section IV.
II.
THEORETICAL MODELING
Cube-octahedral nanoparticles with 147, 309, 561 and 923
atoms are modeled considering an extended bulk with a face
centered cubic (FCC) crystalline packing properly cut to give
the desired geometry, following the procedure described in [3].
These nanoparticle’s sizes where chosen in order to guarantee
that the studied systems can properly represent the nanopar-
ticle’s properties [3]. By construction, our nanoparticles are
similar to onions, i.e., the growth of a nanoparticle is done
by layers. This is consistent with the experimental ﬁndings by
Maenosono and co-workers [4] suggesting that the shell layers
thickness can be closely controlled. The 561 atoms nanoparti-
cle, for example, has 5 layers. Core shell nanoparticles are
then constructed by the exchange of a complete layer of
atoms. Following this picture, for a 561 atoms nanoparticle, for
example, 3Ag@2Au indicates a nanoparticle with 2 gold core
layers and 3 silver shell layers. The 3Ag@2Au nanoparticle is
schematically represented in Figure 1.
Our simulations are performed considering the supercell
scheme and a vacuum region greater than 10 ˚A between
the images. The ionic potentials are described by ultra-soft
pseudopotential [5][6][7] and the electron-electron exchange-
correlation interactions are described within density functional
theory (DFT) considering the generalized gradient approxi-
mation as proposed by Perdew and Wang (PW91) [8]. Spin

polarization effects, as considered in the Vienna Ab-initio
Simulation Package (VASP) [9][10], are explicitly treated.
The single-particle orbitals are expressed in a plane waves
base with energy up to 290 eV, considering only the Γ point
inside the Brillouin zone. Increasing the number of k-points
or the basis set results in changes in total energies, atomic
distances and vibrational modes smaller than 0.05%, 0.1% and
0.8%, respectively. The atoms are assumed to be on their low
energy position when the forces are smaller than 10 meV/ ˚A.
Dispersion forces, indicated by vdW for short, are taken into
account by a simple pair-wise force ﬁeld, as proposed by
Grimme [11]. The C6 and R0 vdW parameters for gold (silver)
are 40.62 (24.67) and 1.772 (1.639), respectively. Formation
energy per atom is obtained using
E f = Esystem −(NAg × µAg +NAu × µAu)
Ntot
,
(1)
where Esystem is the total energy of a given conﬁguration, NAu
and NAg are the total number of Au and Ag atoms, respectively,
µX is the chemical potential of atom X and Ntot = NAu +NAg,
i.e., the total number of atoms in the system.
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the ﬁrst step of our study, we investigate the inﬂuence of
the inclusion of dispersion forces (vdW) on the energetic and
structural properties of different sized homonuclear nanopar-
ticles. Figure 2 presents the energy per atom for different
gold and silver nanoparticles, bare surfaces and metallic bulk
against their mean coordination number. Nanoparticles with
147, 309, 561 and 923 atoms have coordinations numbers
8.98, 9.63, 10.05, and 10.35, respectively. The bare 001 and
111 coordination numbers are 10.67 and 11.00, while the bulk
coordination number is 12. It is clear from this ﬁgure that
both gold and silver have similar linear regression coefﬁcients:
0.23 and 0.21, respectively, when vdW is included and 0.13
in both cases when dispersion forces are not included. In
other words, the effect of vdW is different for different sized
nanoparticles. When vdW is included, the overall change in
energy per atom is smaller for smaller nanoparticles. This is
probably related to the fact that smaller nanoparticles also have
smaller coordination numbers. In other words, since smaller
nanoparticles have a smaller percentile number of ideal 12-
coordinated sites, vdW interactions are more relevant in the
description of the lower coordinated sites. This is consistent
with previous observations of smaller energy differences for
atomic adsorption, e.g., noble gases [12], on metallic surface
sites with different coordinations when vdW interactions are
considered.
In Table I, we compare the average bond contraction for
homonuclear Ag nanoparticles as a function of its coordination
sites considering (vdW) or not (no vdW) dispersion forces.
The average bond contraction, in %, was found comparing
the average bond distance between a given atom site and
its ﬁrst neighboring atoms for the ideal bulk NP and the
relaxed one. The mean value is obtained considering all studied
nanoparticles. It is clear from this table that lower coordinated
sites experiences a bigger contraction when compared to the
metallic 12 coordinated sites. Similar contraction patterns are
observed for Au nanoparticles. The inclusion of dispersion
forces only slightly decreases the observed contractions. Our

structural and energetic data for homonuclear Au and Ag
nanoparticles indicate that dispersion forces do not decisively
inﬂuence these properties. Therefore, in the following discus-
sion, we will present only the results obtained for one set of
calculations and comment on the other.
In Figure 3, we present the difference in formation en-
ergies, or energy gain in eV, (no vdW) when a new shell
is adsorbed on the top of a 147 nanoparticle (corresponding
to 3 atomic layers). We consider both Ag and Au cores
covered by additional Au or Ag shell layers. Our calculations
indicate that starting from an Au core, it is always less
favorable to encapsulate it with one or more Ag shell layers
rather than adding an additional Au shell layer. For an Ag
core nanoparticle, on the other hand, the addition of Au
shell layers is always more favorable than the growth of a
bigger homonuclear Ag nanoparticle. In other words, our data
indicates that the growth of an Au shell layer on an Ag
core nanoparticle is more likely to happen than the growth
of Ag shell layers on an Au core nanoparticle. Similar results
were obtained for larger (306 and 561) nanoparticles. This
is consistent with the experimental ﬁndings indicating that
growth of Ag shells on Au cores requires a reducing agent
for reducing Ag(I) to Ag(0). In contrast, growth of Au shells
on Ag can often be accomplished by galvanic exchange or
transmetalation reactions that oxidize Ag(0) to Ag(I) dissolved
in solution while reducing Au(III) or Au(I) to Au(0) [2]. As
a consequence, Ag@Au nanoparticles are characterized by a
smooth Ag shell layer, observed by G¨uzel et al [13] using
Ultraviolet visible (UVVis), Reﬂection Absorption Infra-Red
(RAIRS) and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy. Our
ﬁndings are also consistent with other synthetic routes, such
as the use of Neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf broth, proposed

by Shankar et al. [14]. Using this approach, Shankar et al.
have found that in a competitive process involving both silver
and gold ions, the reduction of gold ions is accelerated. As
a consequence, silver do not form a uniform layer around
core gold nanoparticles, but rather form small nanoparticles
that decorate them. Although small energy differences are
observed when dispersion forces (vdW) are considered, the
same energy pattern was found. It is important to mention that
our simulations do not consider possible exchange or diffusion
mechanisms, although they might play an important role in the
growth process, as suggested by Shibata et al. [15].
Next, we analyze the shape of the studied nanoparticles.
By construction, all unrelaxed nanoparticles considered present
a cube-octahedral structure. The largest distance inside a
nanoparticle is from the central atom to the c5 site. Upon
relaxation, for Ag using vdW, this distance experiences a
contraction ranging from 0.13 ˚A, or 1.5%, to 0.31 ˚A, or 1.8%,
when the size of the nanoparticle increases from 147 to 923
atoms. A larger contraction is observed for gold nanoparticles
and vdW: 0.10 ˚A (1.1%) and 0.43 ˚A (2.5%), respectively. In
a similar manner, the bond angles between the c5 site and its
4 ﬁrst neighbors is 300◦ for the unrelaxed nanoparticle. Upon
relaxation, increasing the size of the nanoparticles from 147 to
923, the angles increase to 305◦ and 309◦ for silver and to 310◦
and 313◦ for gold, respectively. Therefore, our data indicates
that, for pure cube-octahedral samples, gold nanoparticles are
more likely to have a spherical shape when compared to
silver nanoparticles. This is in agreement with TEM images
obtained by Shankar et al. [14] indicating that gold and silver
nanoparticles formed were predominantly spherical, although
thin planar structures were also observed for the former,
when Neem leaf broth was used in the nanoparticles synthesis
process.
We next analyze the 3Ag@3Au, 3Au@3Ag, 2Ag@4Au
and 2Au@4Ag 923 atom core-shell nanoparticles. The same
contraction pattern of pure nanoparticles is observed, i.e., we
observe a larger contraction for Au@Ag when compared to
Ag@Au nanoparticles. Interestingly, with only 2 Au shell
layers (2Au@4Ag) and vdW the distance between the c5 and
the central atom (0.43 ˚A) is already of the same magnitude
observed for the pure gold 923 atoms nanoparticle. The bond
angles between the c5 site and its 4 neighboring atoms for
Au@Ag nanoparticles (313◦) are similar to the ones observed
for pure Au nanoparticles. In a similar manner, the bond
angles for Ag@Au (309◦) are close to the values observed for
pure Ag nanoparticles. In other words, our data indicates that
Au@Ag nanoparticles are more rounded when compared to
Ag@Au nanoparticles, in a clear indication that the structural
behavior of core-shell nanoparticles are dominated by the shell
layers, with small inﬂuence of the core. This is consistent with
the TEM images obtained by Shankar and co-workers [14]
suggesting that the Ag@Au nanoparticles are predominantly
spherical in morphology. In a similar manner, G¨uzel et al [13]
TEM images of Au and Au@Ag NPs showed that most of
these nanoparticles present a spherical shape. In addition,
Shankar et al., based on a comparison of the TEM images of
silver, gold, and bimetallic Ag@Au nanoparticles, suggested
that the cores in the bimetallic Ag@Au nanoparticles resemble
that of pure gold nanoparticles and the particles constituting
the shell resemble pure silver nanoparticles in terms of both
their size and shape.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
Using ﬁrst principles density functional calculations, the
stability and structural properties Au@Ag and Ag@Au core
shell nanoparticles are explored. Our data shows that the
growth of an Au shell layers on an Ag core nanoparticle is
more likely to happen than the growth of an Ag shell layers on
an Au core nanoparticle. Our structural analysis indicates that
lower coordinated sites experience a bigger contraction when
compared to the metallic 12 coordinated sites. Our structural
and energetic data for homonuclear Au and Ag nanoparticles
indicate that dispersion forces do not decisively inﬂuence these
properties. Our data indicates that the effect of vdW is different
for different sized nanoparticles. When vdW is included, the
overall change in energy per atom is smaller for smaller
nanoparticles. In addition, our results indicate that Au@Ag
nanoparticles are more rounded when compared to Ag@Au
nanoparticles, in a clear indication that the structural behavior
of core-shell nanoparticles are dominated by the shell layers,
with small inﬂuence of the core. In the next step of our work,
the adsorption of functional groups and species on different
nanoparticle’s surfaces are going to be investigated.
