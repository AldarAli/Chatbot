Abstract – To remain competitive in today’s highly competitive 
global markets, organizations must be able to continually 
transform themselves, doing so at an ever-increasing pace. To 
succeed in their digital transformations, more and more 
organizations are adopting an enterprise architecture practice 
and related frameworks. Unfortunately, there is a plethora of 
EA frameworks (EAFs) available to choose from and the 
limitations of the EAF comparison matrices still make it 
difficult for organizations to select the right one. As a first step 
to fill this gap in the literature, this study proposes to review 
the academic and professional literature on the subject. The 
results of our scoping literature review show that there are 
nine criteria commonly used to compare/select EA frameworks 
(taxonomy, meta-model, accelerators, development process, 
maintenance and evolution process, principles, governance 
process, architecture practice and simplicity) and that the 
operationalization of these criteria remains elementary. We 
hope that our contribution will help organizations improve the 
success 
rate 
of 
their 
information 
technology-enabled 
organizational transformation. 
Keywords-Enterprise architecture; framework; selection criteria. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In today’s global economy, competition between 
organizations 
is 
becoming 
fiercer. 
The 
term 
‘hypercompetitive’ is often used to describe this global 
economic 
market 
in 
which 
competition 
between 
organizations is rapidly escalating [1]. The growing 
competition in this landscape is mainly fueled by the 
increasing pace of technological innovations along with the 
adoption of a liberal economy by more and more developing 
countries [1]-[3]. 
To remain competitive in today’s highly competitive 
global markets, organizations must be able to continually 
transform themselves and rethink every aspect of their 
operations, doing so at an ever-increasing pace [1][4]. 
An organizational transformation (OT) is an organization-
wide program that aims to substantially change an 
organization’s structure and/or practices [5] in order to 
enhance performance and boost organizational health [6]. A 
digital transformation, in addition, is an organizational 
transformation that changes how value is created and 
delivered to customers by integrating digital technologies 
into all areas of the organization [7]. 
Orchestrating 
an 
organizational 
transformation 
is 
extremely difficult. Indeed, the numerous challenges 
organizations face while transforming themselves are so 
important that most transformation endeavors are failures. 
According to a recent Mckinsey Global Survey, which 
garnered responses from 1,946 executives representing the 
full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional 
specialties and tenures, only 26 percent of respondents 
mentioned that the transformations they’re most familiar 
with have been very or completely successful at both 
improving performance and equipping the organization to 
sustain improvements over time [8]. 
Practitioners and researchers have proposed a number of 
initiatives and best practices that organizations can use to 
alleviate the challenges they face and increase the success 
rate of their (digital) transformation endeavors (e.g., top 
down direction setting; broad-based, bottom up performance 
improvement; cross-functional core process redesign; change 
management; and an integrated management system that 
links strategy formulation and planning with operational 
execution) [9]-[11]. 
An enterprise architecture practice is one of the best 
practices organizations can use to transform themselves. 
Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that an enterprise 
architecture practice can facilitate (digital) organizational 
transformations by managing technological complexity and 
setting a course for the development of their companies’ IT 
landscape [12]. 
EA presents an integral view of the enterprise and greatly 
facilitates the alignment of various components of the 
organization [13][14]. An EA practice is defined as a set of 
coherent services, roles and people with predefined 
responsibilities who participate in the creation, maintenance 
and evolution of the EA. The resources responsible for this 
practice participate in organizational decisions, their 
implementation and their post-implementation evaluation 
[15]. 
An EA practice can support an organizational 
transformation in several ways. Amongst the most important, 
we note: (1) engage top executives in key decisions; 
(2) emphasize strategic planning; (3) focus on business 
outcomes; (4) use capabilities to connect business and IT; 
(5) develop and retain high-caliber talent; and (6) reduce IT 
operating costs through standardization and reutilization; 
(7) increase flexibility and agility; (8) increase innovation; 
and (9) reduce the complexity of the organization [12][16]-
[18].

Over the years, a great amount of progress was made in 
the field of EA. Indeed, many frameworks were developed to 
help organizations start their EA practice. An EA framework 
is defined as a coherent set of principles, methods and 
models used by practitioners to design, implement and 
maintain an enterprise’s organizational structure, business 
processes, information systems and infrastructure [16]. EA 
frameworks can provide organizations with (1) one or more 
meta-models to describe the EA; (2) one or more methods 
used to design and maintain the EA; and (3) a common 
vocabulary and optional reference models used as templates 
or blueprints [14]. EA frameworks can also be used as tools 
to access, organize and communicate various architectures 
that describe key components of the enterprise [19][20]. 
There are over 25 EA frameworks in the current 
literature, and their number is growing [16][17][21]. The 
ever-increasing number of frameworks makes the selection 
process more and more difficult for organizations [22]. To 
help businesses select the right framework, several 
comparison matrices have been proposed in the literature 
[19][20][22]-[27]. For example, [19][26][27] compare many 
popular frameworks. Franke et al. [24] compare mainly 
frameworks targeted for governmental use. And, [20] use the 
Zachman framework as a basis to compare other frameworks 
that are mostly used by governments. 
Despite their relevance, the EAF comparison matrices 
currently available have several limits. Most importantly, 
they rely on somewhat different criteria making it difficult 
for organizations to identify the right set of criteria to guide 
their EAF selection process. These limits still make it 
difficult for organizations to choose the right framework to 
support their EA practice. 
As a first step to fill this gap in the literature, this study 
proposes to review the academic and professional literature 
on the subject to identify the key criteria used by academics 
and practitioners to compare/select EA frameworks. The 
results of our scoping literature review show that there are 
nine criteria commonly used to compare/select EAFs and 
that the operationalization of these criteria remains 
elementary. We hope that our contribution will help 
organizations improve the success rate of their information 
technology-enabled organizational transformation. 
The rest of this article is organized as follows. First, in 
Section 2, we describe the research methodology used to 
conduct our literature review. Second, in Section 3, we 
expose the findings of our scoping literature review. Lastly, 
Section 4 concludes the article by exposing the next step of 
our research program. 
II. 
METHODOLOGY 
Researchers can adopt several types of literature reviews 
to attain their research objectives [28]. In the particular case 
of this study, we relied on a scoping review. We relied on 
this type of review as the objective of this research is to 
examine the extent, range and nature of research activities on 
the subject [29] while focusing more on the breadth of 
coverage of the literature than the depth of the coverage [30] 
and being as comprehensible as possible [31].  
As such, and as a first step, we focused our research 
efforts on articles published in the IT seniors scholars’ basket 
of eight journals (European Journal of Information Systems, 
Information Systems Journal, Information Systems Research, 
Journal of AIS, Journal of Information Technology, Journal 
of MIS, Journal of Strategic Information Systems and MIS 
Quarterly), as well as three important professional journals in 
management 
- 
Harvard 
Business 
Review, 
Sloan 
Management Review, and McKinsey Quarterly. To carry out 
our research, we selected the ABI / INFORM Global 
(Proquest), as well as the Business Source Complete 
databases, since, when taken together, they gave us access to 
the previously identified journals. We also determined the 
search criteria to identify the articles to be included in our 
analysis. Specifically, the terms “enterprise architecture”, 
“selection criteria” and “comparison matrices” were retained 
as search criteria. Both conceptual and empirical articles 
identified using these criteria were retained. 
Then, as a second step, we also used Google Scholar and 
the ABI/INFORM Global (Proquest) database to search for 
other relevant articles in order to expand our research beyond 
the original set of articles identified. Both of these tools 
allowed us to conduct several searches using the same search 
terms identified previously and to identify articles from a 
wide range of scientific journals, international conferences 
and professional publications. Again, both conceptual and 
empirical articles were retained. 
Then, as a final step, we read the abstracts of the articles 
found in steps 1 and 2. This allowed us to identify a subset of 
articles that merited to be scrutinized in more detail. 
Anchored on this subset of articles, we then used a backward 
approach to identify and examine the references works cited 
in the articles we found [32] and a forward approach to 
identify and examine other articles that cited all the 
previously found articles [32]. This last step allowed us to 
ensure that no important publications were forgotten and 
therefore that we had the widest possible coverage of the 
literature on EAF selection criteria. 
Although our findings exposed in the following section 
stem from a fairly small set of articles, our scoping review 
allowed us to review more than 120 articles in the field. 
III. 
RESEARCH FINDINGS 
This section, which presents the findings of our scoping 
literature review, is subdivided into two subsections. The 
first presents the EAF selection criteria identified in the 
literature while the second presents how these EAF selection 
criteria have been operationalized as of today.  
 
A. EAF Selection Criteria in the Literature 
Our scoping literature review allowed us to identify 
eighteen articles that identified EAF selection criteria and/or 
proposed EAF comparison matrices (cited in order of 
appearance in the following nine Tables). These articles 
enabled us to identify nine criteria: taxonomy, meta-model, 
accelerators, 
development 
process, 
maintenance 
and 
evolution 
process, 
principles, 
governance 
process, 
architecture practice and simplicity.

The taxonomy criterion evaluates how an EAF defines, 
describes and classifies all the models that compose the 
enterprise architecture [19][24]. The meta-model criterion 
evaluates how an EAF defines design rules and all 
components of an EAF along with their relationships 
[24][26][34]. The accelerator criterion evaluates if the EAF 
comprises specialized software tools, procedures, generic 
models, templates, patterns or blueprints to accelerate the 
development of the EA (adapted from) [24][33][35]. The 
development process criterion evaluates if the EAF includes 
a step by step method to design an enterprise architecture 
that is aligned with the strategy of the organization. The 
maintenance and evolution process criterion evaluates if the 
EAF comprises processes for maintaining and evolving the 
enterprise architecture and to keep it updated with the recent 
changes in the IT/business landscape of the organization 
[23][24][36]. The principles criterion evaluates if the EAF 
expresses the philosophy and rules of an organization that 
guide the design and evolution of the enterprise architecture 
[37]. The governance process criterion evaluates if the EAF 
includes processes to carry out the review of various 
architecture and maintenance projects to ascertain their 
compliance with architecture principles and business-IT 
alignment [24][34][36][38]. The architecture practice 
criterion evaluates of the EAF promote the creation of a 
coherent set of services, processes, roles as well as bodies 
with responsibilities assigned to them and who participate in 
the creation, maintenance, modification and evaluation of the 
EA [39]. The simple criterion evaluates if the EAF is useable 
by internal resources with limited EA and IT knowledge 
without needing the help of external experts (adapted from) 
[13]. The following nine tables list the terms used in the 
articles identified in the literature review referencing the nine 
criteria we identified. In cases where the article didn’t 
present a clear definition for a term, our comprehension of 
this term is listed instead and noted by (*).

B. Operationalization of EAF Selection Criteria in the 
Literature 
Amongst the eighteen articles that identified EAF 
selection criteria and/or proposed EAF comparison matrices, 
only nine of them provided the operationalizations of their 
criteria 
[19][20][22]-[27][33]. 
While 
these 
operationalizations represent a step in the right direction, the 
scales proposed to evaluate each criterion are very simplistic. 
Indeed, most of the scale proposed (7 articles out of 9) only 
measured if a specific criterion is supported, partially 
supported or not supported by the EAF [20][23]-[27][33]. In 
this list of nine articles, only the ones from [19] and [22] 
contain scales that properly operationalizes the selection 
criteria. Indeed, using a range of 1 to 4 (1 being very poor to 
4 being excellent), [22] polled managers from various 
companies about their satisfaction level of the EAF being 
used in their organization while [19] used a very similar 
scale to evaluate various EAFs. Yet, the operationalization of 
the selection criteria in these two articles are based on 
subjective assessment and not on an objective instantiation or 
threshold. 
In sum, the shortcomings in the operationalization of the 
EAF selection criteria in articles comparing these 
frameworks hinders the selection process of organizations 
[4][22]. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
This research has enabled us to identify the nine criteria 
commonly used to compare/select EA frameworks: 
taxonomy, meta-model, accelerators, development process, 
maintenance process, principles, governance process, 
architecture practice and simplicity. This research has also 
shown that the operationalization of these criteria remains 
elementary. 
Findings of this research will be used as inputs to the 
following phases of our research program. The next phase of 
our research program will aim to use the criteria identified in 
this research to compare the most popular EAF available 
today in order to validate the pertinence and quality of these 
criteria. The objective of the following and last phase of our 
research program will then be to develop and test a complete 
artifact comprised of the complete set of criteria, as well as 
their operationalization (metric) to help organizations big 
and small to choose the EAF that best suits their needs. 
Ultimately, we hope that findings from our research program 
will help organizations succeed in their information 
technology-enabled organizational transformation.
