Abstract - This paper presents an automatic forest fire
surveillance ground system applied to early fire detection.
Sensor wireless network scheme allows not only supervising
remotely wide-forest area, but also to detect immediately any
fire threat. A real system for forest fire detection in actual
operation is presented. The system is based on advanced
thermal image processing techniques with the purpose of
determining
the presence of
fire.
The projected system
performs the fusion of different detectors, which exploit
different expected characteristics of a real fire, like persistence
and increase in time. Theoretical results, practical simulations
and results in a real environment are presented to corroborate
the control of the probability of false alarm (PFA) and to
evaluate the probability of detection (PD) dependence on signal
to noise ratio (SNR). Delays of the system for alarm detection
of controlled fire have been also evaluated. And finally,
temporary evolution of false and true alarms is presented to
evaluate the long-term performance in a real environment.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Video surveillance by means of sensor technologies is of
great interest when monitoring wide forest areas. Video
sensors and particularly thermal sensors [1] constitute a
powerful
tool
to
automate
and
complement
human
capabilities in wide-area surveillance tasks, since human
capabilities are limited, among others, by the decrease of
vision perception and by the range of coverage area. There is
no need to comment on the importance of this type of
systems for the protection and conservation of natural spaces
[2]
Studies
on
forest
fire
detection
and
different
contributions have been developed in the past. They have in
general, several practice limitations. We can cite, among
others, satellite based applications [3], but they are time
limited when continuous surveillance over the same area is
required [4]. Visible light cameras applications [5] but they
are limited by the decreasing of vision perception at night
[6]. And infrared based systems [7], [8] and [9] but in this
kind of systems, signal processing algorithms are calibrated
in a rather empirical manner, without relating to optimum
filtering or detection theory.
So an automatic forest fire surveillance wireless system
based on infrared sensors is presented at this paper in which
we have introduced some significant innovations regarding
classical infrared based systems. Basically, the algorithms
are selected inside the framework of optimum statistical
signal processing theory. Optimality is in the sense of the
Neyman-Pearson criterion: given a selected Probability of
False Alarm (PFA), try to maximize the Probability of
Detection (PD). In our scheme, we have total control of the
PFA
because
we
have
knowledge
of
the
statistical
distribution of every statistic involved in it. Also the PD is
maximized by appropriate selection of different energy
detectors, which are known to be optimum under very
general models of the background noise and of the unknown
signal to be detected. Therefore, the proposed system
provides total control of a tolerable level of false alarms and
has maximum sensitivity to the presence of an uncontrolled
fire for the defined false-alarm rate. In the end, this implies a
greater detection range and greater reliability of the overall
system.
In this paper, we focus on how to process the images
captured from each infrared sensor with simulated and real
experiences. In Section 2, a description of the global system
is presented. In Section 3 a scheme for infrared image
processing is presented. In Section 4 the theoretical basis is
corroborated with practical simulations. In Section 5 a
prototype system and some real data results are presented,
and finally, some conclusion about the operation of the
system will be also offered.
II.
GLOBAL SYSTEM
The implemented system has two types of stations;
several local stations strategically located to render a
required coverage and a central station, see Figure 1. The
local stations have three basic stages: a first stage of thermal
and visible image capture, a second stage of image
processing, and a third stage of communications.
Since the system has been designed to work in wide
forest areas and the required number of sensors and its
location depend on the concrete scenario, it is important to
choose a scalable technology system. For all these reasons,
we have used an infrared sensor network based on a wireless

communication link in order to collect all the sensor
information in a central station.
Figure 1.
Global System diagram.
The
local
sensor
station
main
functions
are
data
acquisition (from each of the sensor belonging to the
monitoring network) and real time image processing.
An acquisition card captures the images from the IR
sensor. The captured images will be the input data to the
image-processing step. Furthermore, another camera in the
video range is used to provide visible access to the area
under surveillance. If an alarm is detected, the system
captures both thermal image and a visible one, which only
contributes to information if there is sufficient diurnal light.
In spite of the automatic operation of the system, both
cameras can be remotely controlled in manual mode in order
to change system parameters or to verify the detected fire
threats. See Figure 2.
The thermal cameras which are used can be low cost and
without the ability to show temperature values, they do not
require the specific values of temperature, but rather the
relative increments of infrared energy in every pixel with
respect to some properly defined reference level.
Moreover, the proposed system indirectly uses physical
properties of the environment (such as temperature) to
reduce false alarms. In the calibration stage, the system
adjusts the sensitivity based on numerical parameters such as
level and span, which are supplied by the infrared camera.
These
have
a
direct
correspondence
with
physical
temperature values.
The thermal images captured from each sensor are
processed in real time to meet temporal restrictions and to
minimize the information flow as discussed below in section
3.
Therefore,
the
communication
unit
performs
the
management
for a
correct
transmission
of this basic
information.
For example, if a possible fire is detected, an alarm must
be sent to the central station indicating the geographic
location of the fire in minimum time and optimizing the
communication resources. To avoid an excessive flow of
information, only alarm threat coordinates, together with
complementary time-space information, are sent from the
local station to the central station.
Figure 2.
Real global system with infrared/visible cameras and wireless
comunication unit
In addition, an optimized system of alarm information
compression has been implemented to transmit only the
contour of the form of the object described by the alarms,
when they are numerous and close to each other.
The wireless link manages the information transmission
between each sensor of the network and the central station.
The central station represents fire threats in a zone map by
means of a Geographic Information System (GIS), or any
other equivalent form for locating alarms in a given area.
The central station also performs other functions, such us
management
of
historic
alarm
data-bases
or
remote
connection to surveillance ports. In addition, all the control
parameters of the system can be modified in real time by the
central station through of communications unit. Finally, note
that the system has control of the thresholds of each detector
type, which are calculated from the desired PFA and from
the sensitivity of the system, which depends on the level and
the span obtained from the camera in each recalibration. This
allows the thresholds to change based on the different
seasons and the different weather conditions, such as
morning, afternoon, night, summer, winter, etc.
III.
PROCESSING THE IMAGES FROM INFRARED SENSORS
We focus on processing the thermal images from each
local sensor, as described above. We perform a pixel to pixel
processing. We turn each thermal image into a matrix of
pixels, where each pixel is associated with a resolution cell
corresponding to certain coordinates of rank and azimuth. In
this way, we generate a vector that describes the time history
of each resolution cell (see Figure 3).
A first approximation to the problem of automatic alarms
detection could be to decide the presence of fire, in one
resolution cell, when the energy level of the pixel under test
reaches a certain threshold. If the statistic distribution of the

noise is known, the threshold can be fitted to satisfy a desired
probability of false alarm (PFA), getting a probability of
detection (PD) that depends on the signal to noise ratio
(SNR).
Figure 3.
Temporal processing of resolution
On the other hand, usually, infrared noise registered from
wide-area
surveillance
(registered
values
from
usual
environment conditions, without considering fires), is highly
correlated, that is: the temperature among neighbor cells, and
for the same cell along successive images, changes slowly.
We can take advantage of this additional information about
infrared background noise to improve the SNR using a noise
predictor. The noise predictor will compute the noise level of
the cell under test, through different scans. Then, this
estimated level may be subtracted from the pixel under test,
thus improving SNR. Note that if we improve the SNR we
get a better PD for a given PFA.
The proposed ideas are applied in the detector scheme of
Figure 4. The detector is applied to each resolution cell.
Figure 4.
Uncontrolled fires detector general scheme
Partial
aspects
of
the
algorithms
were
previously
presented. In [10] the design of an optimum linear predictor
was considered. The input to the linear predictor was the
values of the pixel under analysis recorded in previous scans.
In [11] the linear predictor is extended to the non-gaussian
case by including a nonlinear gain. Also in [10] a matched
subspace detector is considered to suppress undesired alarms
due to “occasional” effects like cars, people or wind. In [12]
the matched subspace detector is complemented with an
increase
detector
to
take
advantage
of
the
expected
increasing temperature behavior of an uncontrolled fire.
Fusion of the decisions made by both detectors is also
considered in [12]. Finally in [13] a complete detector
scheme is proposed, which makes use of both detectors, but
considering a different time-scale for everyone. Thus several
matched subspace detectors corresponding to short-term
intervals are fused to give the so-called persistence decision.
Then a long-term increasing detector is implemented, to give
the increase decision. Finally both decisions are fused.
In the system described in this paper we have basically
implemented the detector scheme of [12] plus a linear
predictor, which uses a reference image for prediction
instead of the previous images as it was done in [10].
In the following we include a brief explanation of the
algorithms. More specific details may be found in the
mentioned references. A main objective is to have control of
the overall PFA achieved; hence we present some new
simulation to verify the capability of controlling the overall
PFA in the complete detector system. And also we presented
a dependence study of PFA and PD with the system
parameters.
The input signal to the scheme is the vector x = s + wD
containing the level of one resolution cell through D
consecutive image scans. So, x will always have a noise
component wD and when a true alarm is presented, the vector
x will also contain the signal component s due to the
presence of a fire. In order to improve the signal to noise
ratio (SNR) of x, a reference image is also computed. This
image represents the infrared scene noise computed from N
consecutive scans of the cell under test, assuming that there
is no signal present at those scans. Then, we predict wD from
the reference image, using a predictor (details about the
optimum design of the predictor could be seen at [10]).
Subtracting the prediction xp from the signal x we get vector
e that defines the detector input with improved SNR.
An uncontrolled fire is supposed to be a fire that persists
on time, increasing continuously their temperature, in
contrast
with
other
occasional
effects
like
cars
or
atmospheric changes that may produce undesired alarms (see
Figure 5).
Figure 5.
Uncontrolled fire vs undesired false alarm pattern
This consideration let us to propose the detector scheme
of Figure 6. This scheme exploits the assumption about
persistence and increase by means of decision fusion
algorithms.

Figure 6.
Detector Scheme
Persistence detector allows removing false alarms due to
sporadic effects, which behaviour can be assumed to be
"high pass". So the persistence detector is implemented by
dividing vector e into L non-overlapped segments z1 ... zL
assuming that the fire signature across each segment is inside
a "low pass" subspace with projection matrix P. The energy
E, inside the subspace P, of vector zi, is compared with a
threshold λ that is calculated to meet a desired PFA0, whichis
the probability of false alarm for each individual detector
(which is equal for all of the chain) in the form of a classic
subspace matched filter.

To compute the false alarm probability after fusion
decision, PFAp, it is important to define an optimal fusion
rule in order to combine the obtained decisions for each of
the L segments or detectors of M elements. The optimal
decision fusion, as proved in [13], is as follows:

To illustrate the performance of expressions 3 and 4 we
have done a simple recreation where we select as input of the
persistence detector a continuous level signal under a
background noise.
As a result of this simulation we get the ROC curves
depicted in Figure 7 and Figure 8.
Figure 7.
ROC curve PDo vs PFAo
The Figure 7 shows the evolution of PD0 with PFA0
(note that this curves are for a single detector). The PD0 has
been computed for a range of PFA’s between 0.9 and 0.01
with SNR = 1dB and taking for the computation of each PD
1000 Gaussian and correlated vectors of 5 samples size,
under a continuous level of signal that depends on the SNR.
We can notice, as natural, that if we increase PFA0 the PD0
also increase.

ROC curve: PDp vs PFAp with 5 PFAo’s
As regards the ROC curve for the PDp vs PFAp (see
Figure 8. and comparing it with Figure 7) we can notice that,
we get higher values of PDp for the same PFA0, and this is
due to the fusion decisions.
On the other hand, long time increase detector will
enhance the presence of increasing trends. The structure is

based on a filter matched to a continuous component,
preceded by a linear transformation Q(n), which order
depends on the speed of fire increasing . It is implemented by
looking for increasing trends in the energy vector zE =
[E1...EL]T where Ei was defined in (1). To this end, the vector
zE is transformed by a difference matrix of order n, Q(n), and
then matched to a continuous component vector of L-n
elements sn = [1…1}T . The corresponding test is given by

The threshold λ0 is calculated to meet a desired PFA

Once described the persistence and increase detectors, we
define the final decision rule (final fusion in Figure 6). In a

As presented in next section, some practical simulations
have been carried out to corroborate the above equations (3),
(4), (7) and (8).
IV.
PRACTICAL SIMULATIONS
Settled the theoretical basis and once the design of the
system has been considered, some practical simulations are
addressed, at this section, to show the correct operation of
the proposed system.
Theoretical (continuous line) and experimental curves,
obtained by simulation, are superimposed to verify the
control on the required PFA by fitting parameters L, nu and
PFA0.
For the experimental curves, we suppose that the input
vector is a correlated Gaussian vector of T = L · M correlated
samples taken in L segments of size M and fixing M = 6 to
simplify.
On the subject of the relation between PFAp and nu,
fitting M=6, L=20, and nu varying from 0 to 20 and PFA0
from 0.5 to 0.01, we have, as expected, that for a fixed PFA0,
when nu increases the PFAp decreases (see Figure 9).
Moreover, if the PFA0 decreases the curves shift to the left,
that is, for the same value of nu we get a lower PFAp.
Figure 9.
Therotical and practical PFAp vs nu with L=20 for different
PFA0 values
Regarding the relation between PFAp and L we have
fixed a value for nu=6, L varying from 6 to 20 and PFAo
from 0.5 to 0.01. As depicted in Figure 10. , if we increase
the number of segments L we have more positive decisions,
for a fixed nu. For this reason PFAp increases with L.
Figure 10. Theoretical and practical PFAp vs L with nu=6 for diffrerent
PFA0 values
In the case of the relation between PFAp and PFAo, we
fixed nu=6, L varying from 6 to 18 and PFAo from 0.5 to
0.01. Looking at Figure 11. , we can notice that PFAp

increases with PFAo. It is a natural result since the
probability of false alarm of the fusion follows the same
trend that the probability of false alarm of each independent
detector.
Figure 11. Theoretical and practical PFAp vs PFAo with nu=6 for different
L values
An important conclusion to stress of these simulations is
the similar response of theoretical and practical results, thus
validating equation (3).
In the case of the dependence of PDp on the involved
parameters by simulation we only depicted practical curves
since PD for each detector are known. For these curves we
use the same Gaussian vector as input of the scheme, now
generating a fire increasing along the T samples. To generate
the simulated fire we use a linear model with increase slope,
crec, the initial value xini will be recalculated depending on
SNR and the noise variance var(x):

The results were as follows:
Regarding the relation between PDp and nu as we can see
in Figure 12. , fitting L = 10, SNR = 1, and increase slope
crec = 0.01, nu varying from 0 to 20 and PFA0 from 0.5 to
0.01, we have that when nu increases PDp decreases. That is
because when nu increase we have done a more restrictive
fusion and we get lower probability of detection.
Figure 12. Practical PDp vs nu with L=20, SNR=1, crec=0.01, for different
PFA0 values
Regarding the relation between PDp and L (see Figure
13. ), fitting nu = 6, SNR=1, and increase slope crec = 0.01, L
varying from 6 to 20 and PFA0 from 0.5 to 0.01, we have
that PDp increases with L, because we have more local
decisions to manage in the fusion decision.
Figure 13. Practical PDp vs L with nu=6, SNR=1, crec=0.01 for different
PFA0 values
In the case of the relation between PDp and PFA0 we
fixed nu = 6, SNR = 1, crec = 0.01, L varying from 6 to 18
and PFA0 from 0.5 to 0.01. Looking at Figure 14. , we can
notice that if PFA0 increases PDp also increases, note that
PDp increases quickly in comparison with the curve depicted
for one detector (see Figure 7).
Figure 14. Practical PDp vs PFAo with nu=6, SNR=1, crec=0.01 for
different L values

Regarding the relation between PDp and SNR fitting L = 10,
nu=6, and increase slope crec = 0.01, SNR varying from 0 to
20 and PFA0 from 0.5 to 0.01 (see Figure 15. ). If the SNR
increases the PD increases, this is a natural result, if we
increase the signal level we increase the probability of
detecting.
Figure 15. Practical PDp vs SNR with L=20, SNR=1, crec=0.01, for
different PFA0 values
Another important conclusion to stress from these
simulations is the importance of the decision fusion step to
improve the PD of only one detector.
In the case of the increase detector, we have no
theoretical expressions that connect the PFAi and PDi with
the model parameters, so we cannot show the curves which
compare the theoretical and practical results.
Finally we show the practical and simulated operation of
the final decision fusion as a fusion of the persistence
detector and the increase detector.
We have also represented the evolution of PFAt with L in
Figure 16. and with PFA0 in the Figure 17. for a fixed value
of nu.
Figure 16. Theoretical and practical PFAt vs L with different PFA0 values
As expected, we can see in Figure 16. , as if we increase
the value of segments L we have more positive decisions, for
a fixed nu, and this increases the PFAt.
Figure 17. Theoretical and practical PFAt vs PFA0 for different L values
In the case of Figure 17. occurs something very similar,
increasing the probability of false alarm of each independent
detector PFA0 increases the probability of false alarm of the
fusion PFAt and more significantly by increasing L.
In the same way, in Figures 18, 19 and 20 we have
represented the evolution of PDt with L, PFA0, and SNR thus
corroborating the concordance between the practical and
theoretical results.
Figure 18. Theoretical and practical PDt vs L with SNR=1, crec=0.01 for
different PFA0 values
In Figure 18, if we increase the number of segments L we
have more local decisions and this increases the PDt .
Figure 19. Theoretical and practical PDt vs PFAo with nu=6, SNR=1,
crec=0.01 for different L values
In Figure 19, if we increase the probability of false alarm
of each independent detector PFA0 the PDt increases.

Figure 20. Theoretical and practical PDt vs SNR with L=10, crec=0.01 for
different PFA0 values
In Figure 20, if we increase the signal to noise ratio SNR
the PDt increases because we increase the probability of
detecting.
Moreover, if we compare the continuous and dotted lines
we can notice that the practical results are perfectly fitted to
the theoretical ones.
Equations (7) and (8) also verify thus, indicating that the
assumed uncorrelation between the increase and persistence
detector is an appropriate hypothesis.
Another important issue to take into account is the
capability of the system to make an early detection of fire.
The curve depicted in Figure 21 have been computed for a
fixed L=10, and PFA0, PFAi varying from 10-3 to 10-6 and
show the delay that the system requires to generate the first
fire alarms from the beginning of the fire.
We can conclude that for a fixed value of L, if nu is
decreased L-nu increases and the persistence decision fusion
is less restrictive and the fire can be detected earlier. For a
fixed value of L-nu, if the PFA0 is increased, the system
response speed increases.
Figure 21. System delay vs L-nu, for fire detection with diferent PFA0
We can conclude that the system performs an earlier
detection like tens of seconds, if we compare the system
response with that of the average watchman.

RESULTS IN A REAL ENVIRONMENT
Some
results
in
a
real
environment
were
shown
to
demonstrate the correct operation of the proposed system.
First, the system was tested under various real scenarios
by performing the capture of infrared images from real area-
controlled forest fires under the supervision of several
firemen. Specifically in two tests with controlled fires made
in Ayora and Alcoy parks.
The signal processing parameters were: L=10, nu=2,
PFA0 = PFAi = 10-3. One of the processing testing resut was
shown in Figure 22.
In this test we can see how the
processing
system
is
capable
of
discerning
possible
unwanted effects due to other hot zones detected by the
thermal camera. In this example, the fire was detected at
1500 m of direct vision.

Finally the system was installed in the natural park
named "El Carrascal de la Font Roja" in the Spanish city of
Alcoy. The Font Roja natural park area is about 2500
hectares, and its maximum altitude is 1352 m.
Specifically
it
was
installed
in
the
tower
of the
“Sanctuary of the Red Font” building, see Figure 23.

During its normal operation, the system has generated
true detections (see Figure 24. ) and false alarms (see Figure
25. ).

Figure 24. True alarms/day
A true detection is defined as an alarm that can be
associated a posteriori to a true fire (whether or not the areas
is under human control). On the other hand, a false alarm is
one that cannot be associated to a real fire. And it is therefore
a system error.
Figure 25. False alarms/day
A small average number of 40 false alarms per day were
produced, which is in concordance with the configured value
of PFAt of approximately 8E-9.
Some possible explanations can be found for the false
alarms. Many of them were produced during the night or in
especially cool weather conditions in the presence of fog.
Other false alarms were produced during the night by the
lights of the city of Alcoy (part of the scanning angle
included this city). Finally, some false alarms were observed
on sunny days that had alternate periods of clouds.
Figure 26. Thermal and visible images of false alarms examples
These results are due to the automatic calibration of the
infrared camera. When the average infrared energy level is
very low, the camera increases the sensitivity, so more false
alarms are to be expected.
Appropriate control of the automatic calibration of the
camera by means of a temperature sensor could avoid most
of these false alarms. Then, if these problems are resolved,
this amount of false alarms will be reduced drastically,
theoretically getting average values of 14 false alarms per
day or a PFAtof 3E-9.
On the other hand the system has generated many true
fire alarms (see examples in Figure 27. ).
Figure 27. Thermal images of detection examples
Most of the true fires were detected from a significant
distance approximately 1 to 10 km. To our knowledge, no
fires went undetected during this period.

VI.
CONCLUSIONS
A system for early forest fire detection based on images
obtained
from
an
infrared
sensor
network,
has
been
presented. The system is based on the use of several sensors
strategically located to render a required coverage.
We have focus on processing the images captured from
the infrared sensors. Particularly interesting is the fusion of
two decisions respectively corresponding to persistence and
an increase detector. In essence both detectors try to
reproduce
the
behavior
of
a
human
watchman:
an
uncontrolled fire must persist at short-term, and must
increase at long-term.
The correct operation of the system has been justified
verifying that the final PFA may be controlled by appropriate
selection of the detector parameters. We have also evaluated
that the theoretical PD for the total fusion decisions is
consistent with practical simulations, and we can stress from
here the advantage of decision fusion.
The functionality of the system has been verified in
diverse controlled real tests and in normal operation in order
to authenticate the accuracy of the proposed system. We
have shown the temporary evolution of false alarms and true
detections to evaluate the performance of the system in the
real environment. We have also evaluated the delay of the
system in order to generate an alarm corresponding to a real
fire.
The obtained results show large potential interest for this
system to replace human surveillance. Furthermore, and once
it has been justified the correct operation of each single
sensor, it is important to emphasize the importance of a
network sensor in order to increase the coverage area of the
system. [14]
