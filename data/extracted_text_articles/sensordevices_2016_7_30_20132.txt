Abstract—This work reports on response times of a GaAs-
based p-i-n Position-Sensitive Detector (PSD) operated in 
lateral and transverse photovoltaic modes. Visible light spots 
with wavelength values of 405, 532, and 638 nm were employed 
for measuring both static and dynamic properties of the 
proposed p-i-n PSD.  The extracted sensitivity is 4.1 mV/mm 
for the 405 nm light with a power of 3 mW while it was 14.3 
mV/mm for the 638 nm light. The measured nonlinearities 
were 1.0%1.9%, 1.7%2.25%, and 0.25%1.25% for 405, 
532, and 638 nm lights, respectively, with a power of 1 to 3 mW. 
Experimental results reveal that the shortest response time is 
available for the PSD tested with the 532 nm light.

 INTRODUCTION  
After finding of Lateral Photovoltaic Effect (LPE) [1], an 
important Position-Sensitive Detector (PSD) that has its 
output of Lateral Photovoltaic Voltage (LPV) changed 
linearly with light-spot position has been widely investigated 
by using various structures [2][8]. Effects of the LPE on 
Metal-Semiconductor (MS) structures have been reported to 
show PSD’s sensitivities ranged from 12.4 to 28.8 mV/mm 
[2][4]. Currently, Si-based structures are preferred for low-
cost infra-red PSDs. However, there has been little research 
about PSDs based on GaAs-based p-i-n structures [5][7] 
which are appropriate for visible-light positioning. In this 
work, a GaAs p-i-n structure being layer-compatible to the 
base-collector junction of an InGaP-GaAs Heterojunction 
Bipolar Transistor (HBT) was utilized to fabricate a visible-
light PSD. Thus, it is possible to integrate a PSD with an 
HBT amplifier and hence to design a PSD circuit. In addition 
to wavelength and power dependences of sensing properties 
of the proposed GaAs p-i-n PSD, response times reflecting 
light-on and light-off were also addressed. Experiments and 
measurements about the proposed PSD are described in 
following section. In Section III, experimental results 
including key merits, such as sensitivity, linearity, and 
response time, are reported with theoretical discussion. 
Finally, conclusions are drawn. 
 
II.    EXPERIMENTS 
 
Fig. 1 shows a cross-sectional view of the p-i-n structure 
used to fabricate a visible-light PSD. It was grown on a 
(100)-oriented semi-insulating GaAs substrate by a Metal-
Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) system and 
consisted of a n+-GaAs layer (600 nm, n+=51018 cm-3), a n-
GaAs layer (600 nm, n=11016 cm-3), and a p+-GaAs layer 
(80 nm, p+=31019 cm-3) in sequence. Actually, it is layer-
compatible with the base-collector-subcollector structure of a 
conventional InGaP-GaAs HBT. After defining an active 
region, AuGeNi was deposited as a common electrode (C) 
upon the exposed n+-GaAs layer. Finally, AuZn was 
deposited to form two electrodes (A and B) upon the p+-
GaAs layer. A spacing between electrodes A and B is as long 
as 14 mm. Point O, the center between the electrodes A and 
B, is defined as origin of light-spot position (x=0). The light-
spot position is positive (x>0) when the light spot is on the 
right side of point O. A voltage appearing between the 
electrodes A and B was measured as the LPV value while 
that between the electrodes A and C (or B and C) was 
measured as the Transverse Photovoltaic Voltage (TPV).

properties include: the LPV values are close to zero when the 
light spot is located at point O;  if the light spot scans 
positively, LPV values also positively increase. On the 
contrary, they are negative when x < 0; maximum of the 
absolute LPV appears at x  7 mm; and moving the light 
spot beyond either the electrode A or the electrode B leads to 
abrupt decrease in the LPV. Two of the most important 
features associated with PSD’s static sensing properties are 
sensitivity (S) and linearity. We find that the PSD tested by a 
638 nm light has the highest S of 14.3 mV/mm as compared 
to those of 4.1 and 11.6 mV/mm by 405 and 532 nm lights. 
All nonlinearities obtained are below 2.5%, showing an 
excellent linear relationship with the light-spot position. Fig. 
2(b) shows LPV values as a function of light-spot position 
for the p-i-n PSD tested by a 638 nm light with a power of 1, 
2, and 3 mW. In addition to good linearity (> 98%), the 
sensitivity is enhanced from 6.7 mV/mm at 1 mW to 11.1 
mV/mm at 2 mW and finally to 14.3 mV/mm at 3 mW. It is 
noticed that S is dependent on a number density of the initial 
electron-hole pairs. Thus, it is reasonable that (1) at the same 
power, the 405 nm light has the smallest S due to its least 
photons and (2) the larger power with more photons will lead 
to more initial electron-hole pairs. Experimental results are 
in good agreement with theoretical ones reported previously.

parameter used is the light-spot position. It is found that the 
shortest response time is available for our PSD tested by a 
532 nm light. Besides, we find that the light-spot position has 
no relevant effect on the response time. Thus, the swept time 
for holes and electrons reaching to p+- and n+-side layers, 
respectively, is considered to mainly determine the response 
time. When the 405 nm light spot is used, the swept time is 
dominated by electrons generated within the p+- to i-GaAs 
region. On the contrary, it is dominated by holes generated in 
the deep i-GaAs region for the 638 nm light. Thus, a 
response time of 604 s for the 532 nm light is the shortest 
time as compared to those of 1342 and 992 s for the 405 
and 638 nm lights. Although response times of TPV values 
are not shown here, comparisons to those of LPV ones will 
also be addressed in this presentation. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
GaAs-based p-i-n PSDs have been fabricated for visible-
light positioning. A PSD tested by a 3 mW 638 nm light 
shows a sensitivity of 14.3 mV/mm, resulting in a 
sensitivity-distance product of 200 mV. Nonlinearities 
obtained from the present PSD are smaller than 2.5%. 
Response times of the LPV values are 992, 604, and 
1342 s when 638, 532, and 405 nm lights were used, 
respectively, that will be compared to those of TPV ones.
