Abstract — We have developed a novel technique providing 
fabrication of nanoporous silicon films on nonsilicon 
substrates. Magnetron sputtering of an Al+Si composite target 
with subsequent selective etching off the aluminum from the 
deposited film were used to produce nanoporous silicon films 
on stainless steel substrates. These films were found to have a 
highly nanoporous skeleton formed by connected 20-200 nm 
silicon 
grains. 
They 
demonstrated 
an 
efficient 
Li 
accumulation/release 
during 
charging/discharging 
cycles 
combined with a high mechanical durability. 
Keywords - nanoporous silicon; Li-ion battery.

INTRODUCTION 
There has been an increasing research activity in 
development of high-capacity, reliable and durable energy 
sources, in particular Li-ion batteries, for compact electronic 
devices, electric vehicles and various energy systems. Major 
efforts are focused on finding new and improving existing 
materials for electrodes of the batteries. At that point silicon 
(Si) is of a considerable interest because it is characterized 
by a much higher charge/discharge capacity as compared to 
the commonly used carbon materials [1]-[3]. Meanwhile, a 
principal problem of Si anodes in the batteries is their 
mechanical 
durability 
during 
volume 
expansion 
accompanying the lithiation process resulting in cracking of 
the electrodes. Nanostructuring of the electrodes could 
overcome this problem. 
In this paper we present experimental results on 
fabrication and study of nanostructured Si anodes for Li-ion 
batteries demonstrating appropriate accumulation properties 
and durability. Section II describes in detail preparation of 
the samples and the methods used for their analysis. The 
results and their discussion are presented in Section III. 
II. 
SAMPLES AND EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE 
In the experiments performed, stainless steel foils were 
used as substrates. Composite Al+Si films were deposited by 
magnetron sputtering of Al target with Si insets covering 
40 % of the erosion area (see [4], [5] for more details). The 
thickness of the deposited films was about 0.7 μm. Then the 
samples were immersed in H3PO4 water solution at 35 °C for 
5 min in order to etch off Al selectively and to get 
nanostructured Si skeleton revealed. Subsequently, the 
samples with the flat surface area of 1.5 cm2 were used as 
anodes in prototype Li-ion cells where cathode and polymer 
separator were taken from commercial Li-ion batteries. 1 M 
LiClO4 solution in propylene carbonate was used as an 
electrolyte in the prototype cells. 
Charging of the cells was performed at two current 
densities of 6.67 mA/cm2 and 33.33 mA/cm2 using Autolab 
potentiostat/galvanostat PGSTAT100N. Before and after 
charge/discharge cycling the anodes were analyzed with 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The nanostructured Si film after selective removal of Al 
is shown in Figure 1. Highly porous skeleton of Si is visible 
to be formed by connected 20-200 nm grains. Al is 
completely etched off while the Si crystalline grains left look 
to be covered with amorphous Si like it was previously 
observed in [6].

A voltage-time characteristic of the prototype Li-ion cell 
at charge/discharge cycling is shown in Figure 2. In general, 
it confirms conventional operation of Li-ion cell after the 
first charge cycle when the initial lithiation of the anode 
takes place.

reference. 
Self-discharge dynamics of the prototype Li-ion cell is 
shown in Figure 3. Despite the losses (of about 35 % within 
an hour) associated with the imperfection of the experimental 
system and the presence of leaks, the fabricated prototype 
Li-ion cell has demonstrated considerable potential for 
further improvement.

The nanostructured Si film morphology after 20 
charge/discharge cycles is shown in Figure 4. The test 
sample has retained the original coral-like structure, but 
microcracks have appeared therein. The number of the 
microcracks correlates with the current density used for 
charging the cells. Nevertheless, microcracks have not led to 
the fragmentation of the whole structure. The microcracks 
appearance is associated with the quite hard test conditions 
owing to high current density through the cell.

charge/discharge cycles: a) general view b) fragment of the structure. 
Rather thick cracked layer can be also seen on the upper 
surface of the anode. Apparently, it is a solid-electrolyte 
interphase (SEI), which is formed on the anode surface as a 
product of the electrolyte reduction [7]. Formation of thick 
SEI layers on Si nanostructures was observed in [3], [8]. 
They were noted to play a stabilizing role providing an 
increase of mechanical durability of anode materials. 
It is obvious that the coral-like structure is more 
mechanically strong in comparison to needle or tubular ones 
because its grains are interconnected to each other over the 
whole film thickness. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The coral-like nanostructured Si films fabricated by 
magnetron sputtering of the composite Al+Si target and 
selective etching off Al have clearly demonstrated an ability 
to accumulate Li during charging and to maintain a certain 
level of voltage on a discharge time. Herewith, they have 
excellent mechanical durability even at high charging current 
densities which is their undoubted advantage. An extended 
study of the role of porosity and crystal structure of the 
grains has to optimize their performance in Li-ion batteries.
