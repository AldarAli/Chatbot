Abstract—This work in progress expands a previous study, 
where we proposed a decision-making framework designed to 
address the following need: an end-user contacts a domain 
expert to help him solve a problem. The end-user and the 
domain expert establish an interaction between them, consisting 
of questions and answers. This interaction is required to be 
effective, and to this end, the number of questions must be 
limited. The purpose of the framework is to suggest the next 
question to the domain expert, while he interacts with the end 
user. The framework consists of inference algorithms, making 
use of the domain expert’s knowledge, which is structured into 
a knowledge graph. During the interaction, the end-user 
provides data that is fed into the graph as evidence and serves 
the inference algorithms to refine the next recommended 
question to the domain expert.  The proposed extension refers 
to the addition of an existing ontology, describing the relevant 
domain, to the framework's base of knowledge. In particular, 
we want to take advantage of the knowledge, existing in the 
ontology (i.e., concepts and their relations), to enrich the 
framework's ability to offer a greater and more accurate range 
of questions. In the paper, we describe the proposed extension, 
followed by a case study.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The world of “big data” produces many challenges [1], 
One of them refers to the integration of big data in the 
technological realm dealing with decision-making processes 
to leverage these processes. Considering different needs, there 
are several types of decision-making processes, each requiring 
a suitable setup [2].  
Our ongoing research [3] focuses on decision-making 
processes with the following setup: the process involves two 
entities - an end user (which is also the process initiator) and 
a domain expert (which assists the end-user to solve a 
problem); the entities establish an interaction, consisting of 
questions and answers, and is required to be as limited as 
possible (in time, the number of questions, money, etc.). 
Given the above setup, we propose a semantic technology-
based framework, which assists the domain expert in solving 
the end-user’s problem, by suggesting a set of questions 
(inferred from the integrated big data) for the end user, such 
that the cycles of questions and answers will be reduced.  
Our framework includes three components: (a) a formal 
representation of the relevant domain expert’s knowledge 
using semantic technology, specifically a knowledge graph, 
which has emerged as a natural way of representing connected 
data [4], (b) an interactive set of algorithms, using the 
knowledge graph, and initial knowledge provided by the end 
user. The framework suggests relevant questions to the end 
user, while his/her answers advance the domain expert in the 
decision-making process and become input for the next 
iteration. The iterations will stop once the domain expert is 
satisfied, and a decision is made; (c) a domain-specific 
ontology, which is integrated into the knowledge graph. The 
ontology enriches the knowledge graph, thereby expanding 
the set of questions the domain expert can ask the end-user. 
The larger the question space, the more accurate decisions the 
domain expert can make. 
The framework can support several domains that comply 
with the required setup; to demonstrate this, we chose to focus 
on the medical domain. To that end, we built a knowledge 
graph, which consists of two types of nodes representing 
diseases and symptoms. The directional edges, going from a 
symptom node to a disease node, represent a symptom that 
characterizes the disease. It is possible that a specific symptom 
can characterize several diseases. The goal of the decision-
making process is to assist the domain expert to decide on a 
diagnosis (i.e., provide an explanation for a given set of 
symptoms based on analyzing available data). 
The terms: disease, symptom, and diagnosis can be 
generalized, thus being used to represent other domains. For 
instance, in the domain of appliance repairs: the symptom 
represents a problem, the disease represents a malfunction, 
and the diagnosis is a fault identification. 
The rest of the paper begin with reviewing knowledge 
representations (Section 2). We then briefly introduce the 
proposed framework (Section 3) and its new extension. Then, 
we provide further details on the KG enrichment by using the 
Symptoms Ontology (Section 4). In Section 5, we compare 
the previous version of our work with the current one. lastly, 
in section 6, we discuss our contribution and future work.

BACKGROUND: KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION 
According to Davis [5], a Knowledge Representation 
(KR) serves five roles: as 1) a surrogate to enable an entity to 
determine the consequences of a plan or idea; 2) a set of 
ontological commitments about how and what to see in the 
world; 3) a fragmentary theory of intelligent reasoning; 4) a 
medium for efficient computation; and 5) a medium for 
human expression.

In this section, we review methods of KR: knowledge 
graphs, ontologies, and semantic technology. 
A. Knowledge Graph 
Knowledge Graphs (KG) represent information by 
converting data into a coded form, in particular by formulating 
relationships between entities into graph structures. KGs, also 
known as semantic graphs, generate interest among academic 
and industrial researchers, who deal with a wide variety of 
topics that all have the need to represent knowledge in 
common. 
KGs have the property of providing semantically 
structured information. This property enables KGs to provide 
creative solutions for important tasks, such as answering 
questions [6], recommendation systems [7] and information 
retrieval [8]. Knowledge graphs are also considered to hold 
great promise for building smarter machines. KGs are also 
considered to offer great promise for building more intelligent 
machines. 
B. Ontology 
An ontology [9] is an explicit, machine-interpretable 
specification of a conceptualization—that is, the entities, or 
concepts, that are presumed to exist in some area of interest, 
their attributes, and the relationships amongst them. Ontology 
defines a common vocabulary for humans and machines that 
need to share information in a domain. The key reasons to 
develop ontologies includes [10]: 1) to enable the sharing of 
common understanding about the structure of information, 
among people or software agents; 2) to allow reusing of 
domain knowledge; and 3) to analyze domain knowledge. 
C. Semantic Technology 
Semantic technology represents a family of technologies 
that seek to derive meaning from information. That is, manage 
knowledge and join different data streams to perform 
inference. Representing knowledge is naturally done using the 
domain ontologies, and since the ontologies are based on a 
graph model, it is common to use a graph model to represent 
and store the data. By using graph representation for both the 
data and the domain knowledge, graph algorithms are used in 
order to infer new insights.  
III. 
THE FRAMEWORK  
In this section, we briefly introduce the proposed 
framework in [3], which includes a collection of algorithms 
and the flow between them. Then, we describe our extension 
to the framework, which is our current work.  
We aim for interaction-based decision-making processes. 
The interaction is between a domain expert and an end-user, 
and results in a limited number of iterations consisting of 
questions that the framework suggests the domain expert ask 
the end-user. The decision-making process will progress 
according to the end-user’s answers. 
When we analyzed these types of processes, we concluded 
that they can be generically modeled as a collection of 
symptoms and diseases. Eventually, the process goal is to 
assist the domain expert to decide on a diagnosis (i.e., provide 
an explanation for a given set of symptoms based on analyzing 
available data). Questions that may arise during the diagnosis 
process are of the type: Does the end-user have a particular 
symptom?  
The above terms (i.e., symptoms, diseases, questions, and 
diagnoses) produce a jargon that can naturally be used in the 
medical diagnostic domain, yet it is also suitable for other 
domains, such as appliance repairs: the symptom represents a 
problem, the disease represents a malfunction, the diagnosis is 
a fault identification, and a typical question can be: Does the 
end-user have a particular problem with his appliance? 
In the rest of this section, we describe the framework 
presented in [3] along with its algorithms, and the extension 
of this work.  
We start with building a knowledge graph from raw data, 
which will assist in exploring the relationships between 
diseases and symptoms. Following this, we use the Louvain 
hierarchical clustering [11] on the KG (Algorithm 1) to find 
communities (i.e., clusters of diseases that have similar 
symptoms). Then, given the symptoms reported by the end-
user (called evidence symptoms), we find the possible 
diseases that are compatible with the evidence symptoms 
using inference on the KG (Algorithm 2). At this point, we 
infer the most probable community to include the end-user 
disease and suggest to the domain expert a question 
(symptom) that indicates this community (Algorithm 3). 
Lastly, we find the best diseases and symptoms that the end-
user might have, to suggest to the domain expert (Algorithm 
4), to address the improvement of the diagnostic process. 
The whole framework is divided into two main parts: the 
first part, the pre-processing part, is carried out once the 
framework is launched; while the second part, the processing 
part, is carried out each time a new request arrives in the 
framework. This current work expands on our previous work. 
As mentioned, it semantically enriched the knowledge 
maintained within the framework. In particular, the new 
addition expanded the pre-processing part, in step 2 (See 
Figure 1 for the new architecture of the pre-processing part). 
A. Pre-Processing Part 
Input: A list of diseases and their symptoms. 
Step 1: Construct a knowledge graph (KG) of diseases and 
symptoms. The left hand side of Figure 4 exhibits an example 
of a such KG. 
Step 2: Enrich the KG with symptoms Ontology [12]. (See 
Section IV for more details). 
Step 3: Cluster the diseases into groups (called communities), 
according to their symptoms: diseases with similar symptoms 
will be in the same community (Algorithm 1, from [3]).  
B. Processing part 
This part is presented in detail in [3]. 
Input: k evidence symptoms 
Step 1: Find the most probable diseases: the possible diseases 
that are compatible with evidence symptoms (Algorithm 2). 
Step 2: Infer and suggest to the domain expert (repeatedly as 
required) a question (symptom) that indicates the most 
probable community to include the end-user disease 
(Algorithm 3).

Step 3: Infer and suggest to the domain expert a list of diseases 
the end-user might have and their related questions 
(symptoms), sorted by relevance (Algorithm 4).

C. Contribution of the Semantic Technology Extention  
Adding the ontology to the KG, as part of the Pre-
Processing part (see Figure 2), has a main role in enriching 
the semantic knowledge of the domain expert. The KG is 
data driven knowledge, based on the historical 
examination of domain experts [13], and does not consist 
of the structure of the symptoms themselves (hierarchy). 
Adding this knowledge to the KG assists the 
recommendations process by inferring new relations, and 
thus inferring new relevant diseases to the domain expert.

IV. 
GRAPH ENRICHMENT ALGORITHM 
In this section, we present Step 2 of the Pre-Processing 
part: the enrichment of the KG using the Symptoms Ontology 
[12]. The Symptoms Ontology (SYMP) consists of nodes 
representing the symptoms, and edges representing an isA 
relation between symptoms. Thus, the ontology represents the 
hierarchy of the symptoms. The right-hand side of Figure 4 
exhibits an example of such ontology. After constructing the 
KG (step 1 of the Pre-Processing part), and storing it using 
Neo4j Graph Database, the ontology SYMP is added to the 
database, and then we perform the following procedures: 
A. Add Symptom Nodes to the KG 
• 
For all edges 𝑒 = (𝑠𝑖, 𝑠𝑗) in SYMP, such that 𝑠𝑗 ∈ 𝐾𝐺 
and 𝑠𝑖 ∉ 𝐾𝐺: 
o 
 Add 𝑠𝑖 as a symptom node to KG.   
• 
For all edges 𝑒 = (𝑠𝑖, 𝑠𝑗) in SYMP, such that 𝑠𝑖 ∈ 𝐾𝐺 
and 𝑠𝑗 ∉ 𝐾𝐺: 
o 
 Add 𝑠𝑗 as a symptom node to KG 
B. Add isA Relations between Symptoms in the KG, 
according to the Ontology 
• 
For all edges 𝑒 = (𝑠𝑖, 𝑠𝑗) in SYMP, such that 𝑠𝑗 ∈ 𝐾𝐺  
and 𝑠𝑖 ∈ 𝐾𝐺  : 
o 
Add the edge (𝑠𝑖, 𝑠𝑗) to KG, labeled isA.  
Figure 3 presents the legend we use in Figure 4 and Figure 
5. Figure 4 and Figure 5 present the construction and the 
integration of the ontology into the KG.

V. 
COMPARING THE PREVIOUS WORK WITH THE 
CURRENT  
The new edges that were added to the knowledge graph 
(the ontological edges - painted in orange), semantically 
enriched the space of questions, and are used by the domain 
expert. In the previous work, the selected symptoms were 
those that reinforce the most probable disease (independent of 
the other symptoms the patient has). In the current work, the 
symptoms that will be examined are those that will strengthen 
the most probable disease, and are also semantically related to 
the other symptoms of the patient. 
To illustrate the influence of this semantic enrichment, 
let’s consider the following scenario: A patient arrives with 
the following two symptoms: 𝑠1, 𝑠2 and 𝑠5. These are our 
evidence symptoms. Therefore, the patient’s probable 
diseases are 𝑑1, 𝑑2, 𝑑3 and 𝑑4. Since 𝑠2 is an evidence, and 𝑠3 
isA 𝑠2, the symptom 𝑠3 is more likely to be considered to the 
domain expert in the hypothesis that 𝑑1  is the patient’s 
disease. In addition, since  𝑠5 is an evidence, and 𝑠6 isA 𝑠5, the 
symptom 𝑠6 is more likely to be considered to the domain 
expert in the hypothesis that 𝑑3 is the patient’s disease.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION 
This section summarizes our results including our 
contribution, and present our future work.  
A. Summary 
In most areas of life, one can find decision-making 
processes, which makes this topic interesting for relevant 
research. At the same time, since these processes are found in 
many worlds of content, there is a wide and rich variety of 
decision-making processes, characterized by different needs. 
Therefore, in any attempt to support this topic, we must focus 
on a specific subtopic, characterized by specific requirements. 
In the current (and ongoing) work, we focus on decision-
making processes with the following configuration: an end-
user and a domain expert are involved in the process, which 
establishes an interaction between them, consisting of 
questions and answers, to address a problem of the end-user. 
The domain expert uses the suggested framework to make the 
interaction as limited as possible (in time, the number of 
questions, money, etc.). 
B. Contribution 
In our previous work [3], we introduced for the first time 
the framework we built, including a detailed description of the 
algorithms that we developed as part of the framework, which 
enable inference of big data. The innovation of [3] stems from 
the use of semantic technologies, including a graphical data 
model, combined with unique algorithms.  
In the current work, we introduce an extension to our 
framework, such that a domain-specific ontology is integrated 
into the knowledge graph, and hence expands the space of 
questions the domain expert can ask, resulting in a more 
accurate inference algorithm.  
C. Future work 
We want to develop the current research, in particular, to 
explore the contribution of the ontology to the decision-
making process, and to run a case study on the knowledge 
graph we created in the previous study, after incorporating the 
ontology into that graph.  
In addition, we wish to explore the possibility of using  
weighted edges in the knowledge graph for representing the 
cost of each question.
