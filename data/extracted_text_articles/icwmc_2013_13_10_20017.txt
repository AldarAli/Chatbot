Abstract—The network selection process has been widely 
studied in recent years as a result of technological evolutions 
which has been presented to the user with ease of access 
involving issues related to mobility and ubiquity of access to 
data. Thus, several proposals have already been presented, 
always showing a lot of variables that need to be considered for 
a good selection. However, these solutions presents a 
computational cost that grows with the complexity of the 
technique used, the number of variables involved and the ways 
of collecting these variables. The most common solutions, and 
still used in smart-phones and tablets, are those based on the 
signal level measured at the interface of the mobile, due there 
is no incremental computing cost to devices, maintaining these 
solutions as feasible. Therefore, this paper proposes a new 
metrics based on a mapping between the variables of network 
QoS (delay, jitter and packet loss) and the signal level, 
presenting, through experimental tests, prediction equations 
these variables based only on signal level measured at the 
device interface. The validation of the metrics is presented 
using a simple network selection algorithm, operating in an 
environment with two independent and overlapped WLANs 
and no distribution system, comparing the results obtained 
with the proposed metric and WLAN-First algorithm, present 
in most of smart-phones and tablets today.

 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, it is common the access to wireless networks, 
being those, the most diverse kinds. It is also increasing the 
popularization of devices, like smart-phones and laptops. 
Besides providing this technology with affordable prices, it 
offers an enormous mobility because the user can move it 
easily, keeping always best connected to the networks. 
The access to multimedia content, like videos, songs and 
others, through the Internet is an example of services con-
sumed by this increasing demand of users. These users do 
not want only to keep best connected, but also, to enjoy of a 
connection with quality of services. 
To define what would be the best network for devices 
that use wireless networks, it is necessary several 
requirements analysis, what generate high computational 
cost. The network selection needs take in account the 
quality of experience of the users during a connection, 
without generate incremental computational cost. However, 
today, this is a big problem.  
 
It is noticed that there is a challenge when we speak of 
network selection. Efficient Techniques to choose a better 
connection for these multiple devices are still are searched 
for researchers. This study looks for a solution with low 
computational cost, but efficient that could solve this chal-
lenge.  Considering that the computational cost to measure 
the signal level information is minimum, the study seeks, 
through experiments, to relate such parameter with the QoS 
network, proposing in this way, a metric that can be used on 
the mobile devices as an alternative to the algorithm WLAN-
First currently used. 
The article is organized the following way. In Section II, 
we present some theoretical references for the work under-
standing. In Section III, we present the proposal, determining 
the objectives, beside of where and how the processing will 
be done. In Section IV, we present the “test bed” and meth-
odology used for the realization of the study, like equipment 
and statistical studies about the data collected. In Section V, 
we present the results of the study and the models of network 
QoS prediction from the variables studied. In Section VI, we 
show the final considerations and some future work pro-
posed.

RELATED WORKS 
During the bibliographic survey done for the realization 
of this research, we found assignments [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], 
[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11] that show the signal level, meas-
ured on the mobile devices as a parameter to select networks. 
Some of them use methods of artificial intelligence, by 
combining many networks variables (including signal level), 
determining which is the best network in a available group 
[3], [4]. Other authors use methods of decision making 
(MADM) to realize the same task [5], [6]. Other works pre-
sent solutions for handover prediction based only in the sig-
nal level [7], [8]. Nevertheless, there is still a problem to 
solve in network selection scenario: How to establish what is 
possible to be done considering the computational cost added 
to the mobile device? Considering that the most efficient 
solutions for the networks selection has been focused on 
mobiles [1] and [2], the increasing of computational cost 
must be taken into account, in order to the applications can 
be feasible. 
This way, even knowing that the level of the signal 
measured in a wireless interface of a mobile device, it not 
represent, in most cases, the quality of the service provided 
by a network [9] [10], this work was motivated by the fact 
that to measure the power of the signal on wireless interfac-
es, a device does not have increasing computational cost. 
This way, the study was conducted on an experimental basis, 
with a purpose to verify traces that could determine a rela-
tionship between the main network QoS variables (delay, 
jitter, and loss) and the signal intensity (RSSI) measured on 
the device [11].

PROPOSAL 
Normally, modern equipments of wireless access, have 
the possibility to access and/or migrate between various 
networks at any moment. However, there is a diversity of 
parameters that influences the networks selection, mainly, 
when the focus is QoS. Due to complexity of this process, 
variables and context to consider, such techniques have not 
become yet, a pattern adopted by the industry, that continues 
to insert on its mobile devices, algorithms of network selec-
tion, based on methods/criteria not efficient [12]. 
Through statistic methods, this work seeks to predict the 
value of the other variables that affect the network quality. 
Thus, the primary objective of this work is to propose a met-
rics to be used in a mechanism of network selection that 
presents low computational cost (resulting also in energy 
saving). The hypothesis is based mainly on the relationship 
between signal level and QoS variables (delay, jitter and 
packet loss), that affect directly the QoS of the networks in 
general. 
This way, a practical scenario was mounted for measur-
ing the involved variables and a collector algorithm was 
proposed and validated with an implementation. This algo-
rithm can be seen in Figure 1.   
A. Sample Collector 
The first stage of the work was to develop a software to 
make the automatized collect of the necessary variables for 
the studies. In this case, we develop a program in C, receiv-
ing as parameters: i) the destination IP address (Host); ii) the 
quantity of ICMP requests; iii) the output interface, and iv) 
the number of iterations that it will be realized in each point. 
The number of iterations indicates how many times the 
group of requests will be executed at the point's collect. 
After the execution of the routines, a file with the following 
data for each iteration is generated: 
 
Average delay: variable that stores the mean delay of 
the requisitions; 
 
Average jitter: variable that stores the mean jitter of 
the requisitions; 
 
Quantity of packet loss: variable that stores the quan-
tity of requisitions ICMP that did not achieve its des-
tination; 
 
Average network signal: variable that stores mean 
level of the wireless network signal over iteration. 
When the program executes the ICMP requests, it creates 
a new process, in order to verify and store the signal level, 
until the end of every the set of ICMP requests. The algo-
rithm follows the steps illustrated in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Collector algorithm. 
In Figure 1, it is noticed that the algorithm uses two pro-
grams, one named executor and the other named collector. 
The first makes the call of the second according to the num-
ber of iterations defined via parameter. On the other hand, 
the second, divides its processing into two processes where 
one realizes the ICMP requests and the other stores the signal 
level. When the father process finishes its execution, it fin-
ishes the process son itself, calculating the averages of the 
collected values. The program verifies if the number of itera-
tions was achieved. If yes, the program is finished; other-
wise, the executor program calls the collector until it achieve 
the number of iterations established. 
B. Environment Used 
We define ten points, at ten meters from each other one. 
Every points were defined as illustrated in Figure 2. The set 
of points and the distance between each one of them, were 
defined following a straight line from the wireless network 
(Access Point – AP). 
 
 
Figure 2.  Collection Points 
The coordinates of the points were collected using a 
GPS (Global Position System) data test. The location of 
each point is shown on Table I.

We try to avoid obstacles like walls, uphills, downhills,

 METHODOLOGY 
The equipments used were two notebooks model ASUS 
EEE PC 1001PX, considering that one had the Access Point 
function and the other had the client station function. The 
wireless devices on the notebooks are  ATHEROS AR9285 
model. Every the tests were realized, exclusively, with these 
equipments. The operating system used was LINUX UB-
UNTU version 11.04. The wireless network model used was 
the Ethernet 802.11g. 
Then, with the collector program, five iterations of six thou-
sand requests were performed at three point's collect, consti-
tuting the pre-sample of data. These parameters were chosen 
randomly, using the statistical calculations to define the 
ideal set of the collect. 
The studies were realized to define how many iterations 
and how many requests per iteration should be done at each 
point's collect. Through the normal distribution, we can cal-
culate the size of set of tests. 
First, it was necessary to define the number of ICMP 
requisitions for each iteration. For this, through the pre-
sample of data, cited previously, and with only the data of 
one iteration of each one of the three points, we obtain the 
following results, shown in the Tables II and III:

In Table II, there are the results from the standard devia-
tions of the points 1, 2 and 3. In Table III,  the 
quantities of requests necessary for each iteration are pre-
sented, by considering the observation of each variable ana-
lyzed. The biggest value found was of the jitter analysis 
(9604); therefore, the value adapted for the number of the 
test was rounded to 10,000 requests. With these data it was 
possible to estimate the Confidence Intervals (C.I.). 
In previous studies, we notice that even collecting the da-
ta at the same point, some factors can change the values of 
the variables studied, therefore, it was necessary to estimate 
how many iterations should be done at each point. To define 
the number of ideal iterations, we used the same method 
previously described. The results are exposed in Table IV.

In this case, we use the averages of the five iterations, in-
stead of one. Another information that also must be quoted, 
is the error considered. The value of the error was defined 
through diverse considerations to enable the feasibility of the 
study. Some example of this is: i) the time for collecting; ii) 
climate factors and iii) the capacity of the equipment’s bat-
tery. 
With the data analysis, we can observe the values in Ta-
ble IV, are around to seventy (70). Therefore, we use this 
value as the ideal number of necessary iterations at each 
collection point. After the collect, we calculate the confi-
dence interval, with a significance level of 95%. These val-
ues may be visualized in Table V. The delay information and 
jitter are presented in milliseconds (ms), while the signal, in 
decibels (db) and loss, in datagrams (dgram).

RESULTS 
With the ideal collect finished, the next step was to seek 
the QoS prediction models, through of relationship between 
the variables studied. For this, we use techniques of linear 
regression (multiple and simple); therefore the prediction 
model was determined like illustrated on the equation 1. 
 
Y = b0 + b1.x1 + b2.x2 + b3.x3 
 
 (1) 
where: 
 
Y = Dependent variable; 
 
b0  = Linear adjustment coefficient; 
 
b1,2,3  = Coefficients of the variables 1, 2 e 3. 
 
x1,2,3 = Average values of the independent 
variables 1, 2 e 3. 
 
In this work, we study, always, four variables: signal lev-
el, delay, jitter and packet loss, with one of them is consid-
ered as dependent variable and the other three are considered 
as independent variable. In this context, four models of pre-
diction were found, but only three of them have shown coef-
ficient of determination to validate the prediction. These 
models are shown in Table VI.

R2 indicates how much of the variance of Y can be rep-
resented by the variance of the independent variables. The 
values of R2 are in the interval between 0 to 1, where 1 indi-
cates that model is more accurate. For example, in Table VI, 
the variance of the depend variable delay presents values 
around 88.23%, considering the group of independent varia-
bles: signal, jitter and packet loss. 
In real environments, these variables cannot exist sepa-
rately. It is not possible to observe jitter without observing 
delay, besides of the loss of datagrams being inherent to 
network environments. Beside the multiple regression model 
is the most efficient to predict values, analyzing more than 
one variable, it is not indicated in this case. In this sense, due 
the needy to analyze the impacts caused by each one of the 
QoS variables, we use for analysis, the models of simple 
regression, considering only one variable at each time, in 
order to verify the relationship with  the signal level variable. 
A. QoS Models of Prediction with Simple Regressions. 
The models of simple regressions relate only two varia-
bles, therefore, with the value of one of them, it is possible to 
predict the value of other one. This models are used, in this 
work, to obtain a model of prediction. 
We use the collected data in some simple regression 
models and we notice that both exponential and potential 
models has been goods correlation coefficients. The Figures 
3, 4 and 5 illustrate a graphic analysis of the data, showing 
relationship between the variables: loss, delay and jitter to 
the signal level. Tables VII and VIII present the coefficients 
of determination found.

We notice, through Figure 5 and Tables VII and VIII, 
that the relationship between signal level and packet loss is 
the most explained by the regression models. In the exponen-
tial and potential models, the determination coefficients (R2) 
show more than 92.16% and 97.54% respectively, when 
predicting the values of the variable Y (loss). In other cases, 
Figures 3 and 4 and also through Tables VII and VIII, for 
both delay and jitter, the better results are obtained for the 
potential regression, respectively. The coefficients of deter-
mination achieve around 65.62% and 56.27%. 
The purpose of the study was achieved in potential mod-
el, because only with the value of the variable signal level 
was has been possible to predict the other 3 variables, inde-
pendently. 
 
B. Validation of the proposed models 
To realize the validation of the models found for the pre-
diction of each QoS variable, in function of the measured 
signal level, it was mounted an environment with two over-
lay WLANs, without distribution system. In a mobile device, 
model SAMSUNG P6200, it was implemented a simple 
algorithm based on the models presented in this work. 
We use the described environment to transmit a video se-
quence known as highway, containing 2000 frames in the 
QCIF format, using a video server based on the VLC soft-
ware. Beside this, we consider the threshold of 20 packets 
loss to be used by algorithm to choice between the networks. 
By considering always a level of trust of 95%, we realize 
10 groups of tests, each one with 100 transmissions of this 
video sequence, from the server to the mobile. During the 
transmissions, we capture, using ICMP requests, from the 
mobile to the gateway of the two WLAN networks available, 
the values of the datagrams loss. During every transmissions, 
the mobile was submitted to a movement that allowed a large 
variations at the signal level measured on each network, 
aiming to test of the model found. The results can be seen in 
Figures 6 and 7.

and WLAN2. 
 
 
Figure 7.  RSSI measured on the Mobile of WLAN1 and WLAN2 
As we can see in Figures 6 and 7, the algorithm of network 
selection, proposed based on the presented model, did the 
change of network whenever the datagrams loss was above 
the threshold, providing the user with a better experience in 
the reception of services on its own devices. 
An example can be seen at the point referring to the sixth 
group of transmissions, where the average value of RSSI for 
WLAN1 was 60db and the loss for the same network was of 
28 datagrams. Meanwhile, for WLAN2, RSSI was lower, 
53db and the loss of datagrams was null. In this case, while 
WLAN-First didn't show sensibility, indicating to the mobile 
that it should remain in the same network (WLAN1), the 
algorithm based in the our proposal, had recommended to the 
mobile, the change of network to WLAN2. Even this net-
work having a smaller RSSI, the proposed model for data-
grams loss showed to be efficient, suggesting the change to a 
network with less loss. Meanwhile, using the traditional 
algorithm, native of the device (WLAN-First), the mobile 
remained in its origin network from the beginning until the 
end of the video sequence transmissions, not taking into 
consideration the losses of the network. 
  Similar results were found using the prediction models 
proposed for delay and jitter, characterizing that the proposed 
models can be used together or separated, depending of the 
traffic type considered by the network selection. 
We notice that the results of this work do not increase the 
computational cost to the device, demonstrated by the battery 
consumption, if compared to the WLAN-First algorithm, as 
in Figure 8.

Figure 8.  Percentage of consumed battery 
In Figure 8, it is possible to observe that the battery con-
sumption of our proposal did not change, if compared to 
WLAN-First algorithm. Considering that WLAN-First 
adopts the strategy of keeping the mobile always connected 
to a WLAN, without considering the QoS network, we can 
affirm that our proposal achieved better results, basically 
with the same battery consumption. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
As we presented before, there are no efficient 
computational network selection techniques available. This 
study presents satisfactory results, showing that there is a 
relationship between the variables studied. Table VI shows 
satisfactory results, reaching coefficients of determination in 
the interval between 0 and 1. 
With simple regressions, it was possible to determine R2 
to each one QoS variables, noticing, that, in 97.54% of the 
cases, it is possible to predict the loss of datagrams on a 
network, through of the signal level measured. Even without   
having an expressive relationship between other QoS   
variables, delay and jitter present coefficients, in order to   
show that there is a relationship with the signal level. 
We can notice, then, that it is possible to achieve success 
in the development a technique of network selection with 
low computational cost and efficient. Even that any  data has 
presented values with a low relationship, it is possible to 
determine some variables, that affect directly the QoS of a 
network observing the signal level only. 
However, the proposed environment shows only a 
portion of the possible environments, some aspects need to 
be better investigated and yet improved, facts that is being   
studied. 
A study mixing both simple and multiple regressions can 
result in more accurate values. Besides this, the proposed 
model here can be expanded and generalized to other test 
beds, using mathematical tools more elaborated that can 
verify other non-linear relationship between the variables.
