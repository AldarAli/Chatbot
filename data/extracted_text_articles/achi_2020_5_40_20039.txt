Abstract—Japan is well known for one of the highest suicide rates
in the world, and suicide is the third cause of death after cancer
and accidents. The most common reason for suicide comes from
overwork and stress-related issues. Researchers have found that
education is listed in the top 6 job categories that are highly
affected by overwork and stress. In this paper, we investigate
the human factors that inﬂuence the exhaustion and stress levels
of nursery teachers, which is one of the top social issues in the
education system of Japan. We are the ﬁrst to own a novel dataset
that contains the data of nursery teachers in Tokyo including
demographics, working schedule, and stress and exhaustion infor-
mation. The data was collected using survey-based and real-time
approaches with professional devices. We built a regression model
in machine learning with t-test in statistics and divided the effect
levels of the factors into three levels: normal, nearly-signiﬁcant,
and signiﬁcant. We found the following results. First, we found
the evidence that working on Thursday and Friday affects both
exhaustion and stress. Interestingly, although working on Friday
is more exhaustive than on Thursday, working on Thursday
is more stressful than on Friday. Surprisingly, we found that
while working on Saturday does not affect either exhaustion or
stress, working on Sunday is a factor affecting the stress (but
not exhaustion) of the participants. Furthermore, gender, weight,
and height do not appear as affecting factors. Also, people who
are less than 30 years old get more easily stressed than the other
ages.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Japan is well known for having one of the highest suicide
rates in the developed world. Japanese culture has a long
history of considering certain types of suicides honorable,
especially during military service. According to the National
Police Agency (Government of Japan), 24,025 people died by
suicide in Japan in 2015; and among those, 2,159 (12.0%)
were suicides due to overwork and stress-related issues [1]. Y.
Takashi et al. [2] studied 18 most common job categories and
found that education/learning support is listed in the top 6 job
categories that are highly affected by overwork and stress.
A. Motivation
Based on the data mentioned above, we ask the question:
why does education/learning support have such a very high
rank of overwork and stress rates? It is even higher than some
other job categories that were believed to have high overwork
and stress rates, such as scientiﬁc research, professional, and
technical services, or information and communications. Fur-
thermore, while a national initiative towards the prevention of
overwork and stress-related issues becomes a challenge, Japan
is encountering another big social issue in education that is the
massive demand for nursery teachers [3][4]. According to the
Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan, the number
of children on the waiting lists of nursery schools was over
20,000 between 2009 and 2016 [5]. Especially, this problem
is serious in large cities like Tokyo. In 2016, more than 35%
of the children on waiting lists lived in Tokyo [6]. So, we ask
another question: Is there a relation between these two social
issues in Japan, especially in Tokyo? More concretely, what
are the factors inﬂuencing the exhaustion and stress of nursery
teachers?
B. Contribution
In this work, we investigate human factors that affect the
stress and exhaustion of Japanese nursery teachers:
•
To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to collect
a novel dataset related to the exhaustion and stress
measurements of the nursery teachers in Tokyo. Our
dataset was collected using a survey-based approach
(i.e., questionnaire) and a real-time approach with the
help of professional devices.
•
Many people thought (but did not have evidence) that
working on the days of the week that are before and
close to weekends is more exhaustive and stressful
than on the other days, and we are the ﬁrst to ﬁnd
the evidence about it. We built a regression model in
machine learning, applied the t-test, and found that the
teachers working on Thursday and Friday tend to get
exhausted and stressed. Moreover, while working on
Friday is more exhaustive than on Thursday, working
on Thursday is more stressful than on Friday.
•
We also found that, while working on Saturday does
not affect either the exhaustion or the stress, working
on Sunday is a factor affecting the stress but not the
exhaustion, although both Saturday and Sunday are
weekend. Furthermore, gender, weight, and height do
not appear as effecting factors; but people under 30
years old get stressed easier than the others.

RELATED WORK
In this section, we introduce related work about factor
analysis in exhaustion and stress.
A. Exhaustion and Stress in Education
A. Rudman et al. [7] studied the inﬂuences of burnout
during nursing education in health and professional develop-
ment, and quality of care. They monitored the burnout of a
national sample of nursing students during their years in higher
education and at follow-up one year post-graduation, and found
that the burnout during education is an important concern to the
future clinical performance. A. Antoniou et al. [8] investigated
the occupational stress and professional burnout of teachers
in primary and secondary education. They showed that the
teachers in primary education and the female teachers expe-
rience higher levels of stress compared to those in secondary
education and male teachers, respectively. Furthermore, female
teachers experience lower personal accomplishment than male
teachers. N. Barkhuizen et al. [9] analyzed the relationship
between burnout and work engagement in higher education.
They found that job demands contributed to burnout while job
resources contributed to work engagement. Dispositional op-
timism strongly affects perceptions of job resources, burnout,
work engagement, ill-health, and organizational commitment.
L. Flook et al. [10] analyzed the Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction course (mMBSR) for teachers. They showed that
the course has a good effect on the participants with sig-
niﬁcant reductions in psychological symptoms and burnout,
improvements in classroom and performance on a computer
task of affective attentional bias, and an increase in self-
compassion. In contrast, control group participants showed
declines in cortisol functioning and signiﬁcant increases in
burnout. Contrary to our work, none of the related work
analyzed the stress and exhaustion for nursery teachers.
B. Exhaustion and Stress in Other Fields
N. Khamisa et al. [11] analyzed the nature of relationships
between work-related burnout, job satisfaction, and general
health of nurses. They showed that lack of support was
associated with burnout, patient care was associated with job
satisfaction, and staff issues were associated with general
health of nurses. Furthermore, burnout is more strongly related
to job satisfaction than general health. M. Mikolajczak et
al. [12] analyzed whether parental burnout is affected by
overwhelming exhaustion related to parental roles, emotional
distance with children, and sense of ineffectiveness in parental
roles. They showed that parental burnout is a multi-determined
syndrome mainly predicted by three sets of factors: parent’s
stable traits, parenting, and family-functioning. P. Gkorezis et
al. [13] studied Machiavellian leadership (a person’s tendency
to be unemotional, lacking in concern for conventional moral-
ity and more inclined to engage in interpersonal manipula-
tion) in employees’ emotional exhaustion. They showed that
Machiavellian leadership has both direct and indirect effect on
employees’ emotional exhaustion through organizational cyni-
cism. W. Liang et al. [14] analyzed whether the stress itself af-
fects other issues (i.e., the problematic smartphone used among
college students). Stress measurement is used as a factor not a
target function like our goal. G. Mark et al. [15] analyzed three
email use patterns, such as duration, interruption habit, and
batching in affecting workplace productivity and stress. They
tracked email usage of 40 information workers for 12 workdays
and found that the longer daily time spent on email, the lower
productivity and the higher stress. Furthermore, people who
primarily check email through self-interruptions report higher
productivity with longer email duration compared to those
who rely on notiﬁcations. A. Barbarin et al. [16] investigated
whether health information technology can support overweight
or obese women in addressing emotion and stress-related
eating. They showed that the factors (participants’ needs)
are holistic health goal development, building motivation to
achieve goals, and assistance with handling stress. J. Adri-
aenssens et al. [17] analyzed the inﬂuence of changes over time
in work and organizational characteristics on job satisfaction,
work engagement, emotional exhaustion, turnover intention
and psychosomatic distress in emergency room nurses. They
found that changes in job demand, control, and social support
predicted job satisfaction, work engagement, and emotional
exhaustion. In addition, changes in reward, social harassment,
and work agreements predicted work engagement, emotional
exhaustion, and intention to leave, respectively.

PROCEDURE
We collaborated with the Center of Early Childhood
Development, Education, and Policy Research (CEDEP) at
the University of Tokyo, Japan. CEPDEP helped contact 36
nursery teachers, who are working in seven nursery schools
located in different wards in Tokyo. All the teachers agreed to
participate in our measurement and signed the Privacy Policy
agreement about their personal data.
A. Demographics
A paper-based questionnaire is prepared and distributed to
the participants. The questions related to the demographics
include:
•
Gender: It is a single-choice question with two answer
options (male and female).
•
Age: The inputs are integers. The valid values are from
15 to 65 (years old), which are the allowed working
ages by the Japanese government.
•
Weight and height: The inputs are integers. The units
are kilogram (kg) and centimeter (cm), respectively.
The distribution of gender, age, weight, and height are given
in Tables I, II, III, and IV, respectively.
B. Working Days
All the measurements were conducted in 2019. Since there
were not enough devices for all the participants to use at
the same time, the data of each participant was collected
in different periods. Each day in the measurement period is
transformed to the corresponding day of the week (Monday
to Sunday). The distribution is given in Table V. The ﬁrst
column represents the participant ID (36 participants in total).
The second column represents the measurement periods. Some

participants have discontinuous measurement periods which
are presented in different rows. The third to ninth columns
represent the number of weekdays extracted from the mea-
surement periods.
C. Stress and Exhaustion Measurement
Professional devices were used to measure the stress and
exhaustion. The devices were given to the participants only in
the corresponding measurement periods that were designed for
each participant, as mentioned in Section III-B. The teachers
were required to wear the devices during the working time in
the nursery schools only, and had to return them before leaving
the schools.
To measure the stress, we used Garmin smartwatches
(Vivoactive 3), as depicted in Figure 1 (left). Garmin is
a technology company specializing in wearable technology
products, such as activity trackers and smartwatches [18]. The
devices measured the stress from 1 to 100. 1 to 25 represents
the resting states, 26 to 50 represents the low stress, 51 to
75 represents the medium stress, and 76 to 100 represents
the high stress. The devices determine the stress based on
the heart-rate variability. From the heart rate data, the device
extracts the interval between each heartbeat. If the variable
length of time in between each heartbeat is fast, it reﬂects the
autonomic nervous system of the user’s body. The lower the
variability between beats, the higher the stress levels, whereas
an increase in variability indicates less stress. We can read
the stress directly from the devices or logging in the accounts
from the Application Programming Interface (API) webpage
of Garmin.
To measure the exhaustion, we used Omron devices (Active
Style Pro HJA-750C), as depicted in Figure 1 (right). Omron
is an electronics company that is well-known for medical
equipment devices [19]. The devices measure the total calories
burned and the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). These values
are then used to calculate the exhaustion. More details are
explained in Section IV.

MODEL
Let f denote the model for both the exhaustion and stress:
f = demog + wdays
(1)
where demog and wdays denote the features extracted from
demographics and working weekdays, respectively.
A. Variables
The explanatory variables related to demog consist of
gender, age, weight, and height. For the gender, the input
values are normalized to binary numbers, such as male: 1 and
female: 0. For the age, the input values are grouped into three
features (i.e., ≤ 29, 30 to 39, and ≥ 40 (years old)), and are
normalized to binary numbers for each feature. For the weight
and height, the variables use the original input values.
The explanatory variables related to wdays are the seven
days in a week (Monday to Sunday) which are extracted from
the measurement period. For each weekday, the variable is a
binary number, such as working on that day: 1 and not working
on that day: 0. In summary, there are 13 variables (11 binary
variables and 2 continuous variables).
B. Target functions
For the exhaustion, the target function is deﬁned as follows:
f1 = wkcal
bmr
(2)
where wkcal denotes the calories burned during the work-
ing time for each weekday (Monday to Sunday); and bmr

denotes the BMR, which is the body’s metabolism. BMR
represents the required calories to keep one’s body functioning
at rest (a constant for each person). Thus, we calculate the
exhaustion by the rate of total calories burned everyday and
the BMR. For each weekday, wkcal is calculated as the
average of calories burned in all the working days that can
be transformed to this weekday. More concretely, suppose
that the measurement period is n days {d1, · · · , dn}. For each
weekday w ∈ {Monday, · · ·, Sunday}, wkcal is calculated
as wkcal = average(CaloriesBurned(di)) for all ∀i such that
WeekDay(di) = w.
For the stress, the target function is deﬁned as follows:
f2 = wsl
(3)
where wsl dennotes the stress for each weekday. wsl is
calculated as the average of stress levels in all the work-
ing days that can be transformed to the weekday: wsl =
average(StressLevel(di)) for all ∀i such that WeekDay(di) =
w.
C. Factor Determination
After constructing the model, the (multiple) linear regres-
sion is applied for each target function. The linear regression is
used instead of the logistic regression because the exhaustion
and stress have continuous values. Formally, suppose yp is the
predicted value. yp is determined as:
yp(w, x) = w0 + w1x1 + · · · + wnxn
(4)
where (x1, · · · , xn) are the variables and n is the num-
ber of variables. The algorithm designates the vector w =
(w1, · · · , wn) as the coefﬁcients and w0 as the intercept (i.e.,
the constant which is the expected mean value of yp when all
x’s are 0). To estimate w and w0, we use the Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS) method which ﬁts the model with coefﬁcients
to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed
targets in the dataset and the targets predicted by the linear
approximation:
minx || xw − y ||2
2
(5)
The t-test is then applied to ﬁnd the factors whose p-values
are less than or equal to 0.05. The factors are categorized as
follows:
•
0.01 < p ≤ 0.05: normal affecting factors
•
0.001 < p ≤ 0.01: nearly-signiﬁcant affecting factors
•
p ≤ 0.001: signiﬁcant affecting factors
In the experiment result, besides the p-value, we also show
the t-value which measures the size of the difference relative
to the variation in the sample data, the coefﬁcients wi of the
linear equation, and 95% of Conﬁdence Interval (CI) which is
an estimated range of values that may contain the true mean
of the population.
V.
EXPERIMENT
The program is written in Python 3.7.4 on a computer
MacBook Pro 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7, RAM 16 GB. The
regression model is executed using scikit-learn library 0.21.
The t-test is applied using statsmodels library 0.10.
A. Data Pre-processing and Statistics
1) Cronbach’s Alpha (α): Cronbach’s α is used to measure
the Internal Consistency (IC) or the reliability of the ques-
tions that have multiple Likert-scale sub-questions. Suppose a
quantity which is a sum of K components is measured as:
X = Y1 + Y2 + · · · + YK. The value α is deﬁned as follows:
α =
K
K − 1(1 −
PK
i=1 σ2
Yi
σ2
X
)
(6)
where σ2
X denotes the variance of the observed total test scores
and σ2
Yi denotes the variance of the component i for the current
sample of persons. The values of α can be interpreted as
follows: α ≥ 0.9 (excellent IC), 0.9 > α ≥ 0.8 (good IC),
0.8 > α ≥ 0.7 (acceptable IC), 0.7 > α ≥ 0.6 (questionable
IC), 0.6 > α ≥ 0.5 (poor IC), and 0.5 > α (unacceptable IC).
For our dataset containing the working weekdays (Table V),
we can ask the same type of question. We run the Cronbach
α test on the set of 36 rows (36 participants) and 7 columns
(Monday to Sunday) in the table. For the participants that have
more than one row, the values are summed for each working
weekday. The number of sub-questions is K = 7. The sum of
the item variances is PK
i=1 σ2
Yi = 10.49. The variance of total
scores is σ2
X = 67.01. Therefore, α =
7
7−1(1 − 10.49
67.01) = 0.98
(excellent IC). This indicates that the data for working days is
reliable.

2) Noise Removal: Each participant has different working
weekdays. In Table V, 122 samples are extracted as the number
of working weekdays of the 36 participants. For the exhaustion
measurement, we used all the 122 samples for the learning
dataset and applied the regression to the dataset. For the
stress measurement, there are nine samples that have zero
or untraceable stress levels. We thus considered them as data
outliers, and removed them from the dataset. We applied the
regression on the remaining 122 − 9 = 113 samples.

3) Distribution: As mentioned in Section IV-A, the model
consists of 13 variables (11 binary variables and 2 continuous
variables). The distributions are separately calculated on 122
samples for the exhaustion and 113 samples for the stress.
The distribution of binary variables is given in Table VI. In
some variables, the values may have a low distribution. For
instance, the variables Monday, Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday
have less than 10% of the distribution for the binary value ‘1’
(or ‘yes’). This may raise the question whether this kind of
variables will affect the result and should be removed from
the dataset. However, for the linear regression model, it is not
necessary to remove such variables because the inﬂuences of
any variable, which is even strong or weak, will be reﬂected in
the t-test’s result. For the continuous variables, the distribution
scores are described in Table VII and the distribution curves are
given in Figures 2 (weight) and 3 (height). The curve shapes
for the exhaustion and the stress look the same but in fact, are
different. All the variables have bell curves and the skewness in
[−2, +2]; this indicates that the variables are valid for normal
(Gaussian) distribution.
B. Main Experimental Results
1) Exhaustion: The regression is applied to 122 samples.
The result is shown in Table VIII. Two factors were found:
•
Friday: signiﬁcant affecting factor (p = 0.001). The
positive coefﬁcient (0.2541) indicates that the teachers
who work on Friday tend to get exhausted. If the

2) Stress: The regression model is applied to 113 samples.
The result is shown in Table IX. Five factors were found:
•
Age ≤ 29: normal affecting factor (p = 0.030).
The positive coefﬁcient (44.9775) indicates that the
teachers who are less than or equal to 29 years old
tend to get stressed.
•

C. Discussion
Both the results of exhaustion and stress show that the
nursery teachers who work on Thursday and Friday tend to get
exhausted and stressed. It is probably caused by the fact that
Thursday and Friday are the latest two days before the teachers
can take the weekend holidays. Furthermore, although working
on Friday is more exhaustive than on Thursday, working on
Thursday is more stressful than on Friday. The results also
show that the people under 30 years old get stressed easier
than the others. In our survey, the people under 30 years
old are the youngest participants (compared with 30 to 39
and over 30) and it is quite obvious that the young people
often do not have good control on their anxiety, emotion,
and stress. The deeper reasons that explain these results will
be formally examined in future work. Furthermore, a new
questionnaire can be re-designed to collect other promising
factors including the information related to schools (e.g., the
number of male/female teachers and children, public or private
schools, etc.) and teachers (e.g., experience (acquired skills),
self-conﬁdence, salary, full/part-time, etc.).
VI.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we used professional devices to collect
exhaustion and stress information from 36 nursery teachers
working in Tokyo. We built a regression model and found the
evidence that working on Thursday and Friday affects both
the exhaustion and stress. While working on Friday is more
exhaustive than on Thursday, working on Thursday is more
stressful than on Friday. While working on Saturday does not
affect either the exhaustion or stress, working on Sunday is
a factor affecting the stress, but not the exhaustion. Gender,
weight, and height do not appear as affecting factors. People
under 30 years old get stressed easier than the others.
