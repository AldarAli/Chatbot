Abstract—Free Space Optical Communications (FSOC) has 
proved to be a reliable alternative to radio frequency systems 
in providing high speed wireless data links, especially for 
satellite communications. To further improve the FSOC 
performance, plenty of novel light source beams are proposed 
and evaluated, among which Airy beams have gained intensive 
research efforts in the past decade, owing to its remarkable 
features. An ideal Airy beam is able to propagate in free space 
without diffraction, and it is resistant to atmospheric 
turbulence due to the self-healing feature. Besides, the main 
lobe of an Airy beam follows a controllable ballistic trajectory, 
which can be particularly useful to improve the link robustness 
in presence of blockage. However, if the transverse extent of 
the Airy beam is confined by a finite optical aperture, the non-
diffractive features no longer retain. But within the limited 
diffraction-free range, the Airy beam is still able to self-heal 
and self-bend, making it valuable for enhancing the 
survivability of FSOC systems. In this study, we first examined 
the effects of truncation methods on the Airy diffraction-free 
range and found out that the aperture-truncated Airy (ati-Airy) 
beam is more preferable in terms of propagation distance. 
Then, the scintillation behavior of ati-Airy beams is 
investigated under the conditions of controlled self-bending as 
well as self-healing from obstructions.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
With the ever increasing demand of high bandwidth in 
satellite data transmission, in recent years Free Space Optical 
Communications (FSOC) has become one of the mainstream 
physical-layer technologies [1][2]. Most of the current FSOC 
systems use traditional Gaussian beams as the optical source. 
In order to improve the receiving performance, various novel 
beams have been proposed [3]-[6], among which is the Airy 
beam [7]. The reason why the Airy beam is considered 
promising in FSOC roots in its remarkable features—non-
diffracting propagation in free space [8], self-accelerating in 
the transverse direction [9] and self-healing in the presence 
of obstacles [10].  
In the context of FSOC, it is of great beneficial if optical 
beams can propagate without diffraction, since the power 
loss due to diffractive spreading can be minimized in long-
haul links. However, for an Airy beam to fulfill the ideal 
diffraction-free feature, the transmitter (TX) optics should be 
larger than the spatial extent of the Airy field, which is 
determined by 
2

0
k x [11], where k is the optical wave number 
and x0 is the characteristic length of the Airy function. For 
effective capture and tracking in a practical system, x0 should 
not be too small, and reasonable values of x0 would require 
intimidatingly large TX apertures. That being said, in the real 
world of FSOC, the transmitting beam is always truncated by 
the finite TX aperture. Fortunately when that happens, the 
Airy beam is still able to propagate without much spreading 
within a limited distance called (nearly) diffraction-free 
range, beyond which severe diffraction takes place.  
Despite its limited propagation distance, the truncated 
Airy beam is appealing. The well preserved self-accelerating 
feature makes it unique as an optical carrier, bringing the 
possibility of circumventing obstacles on the path to the 
receiver. If the obstacle is too big to circumvent, the Airy 
beam can even regenerate the blocked part of its optical field, 
which is known as self-healing. Therefore, optical links built 
with Airy beams can be more robust than the existing line-
of-sight (LOS) links, especially in satellite communication 
scenarios, where blockage caused by clouds or other objects 
frequently occurs. 
In this study we try to demonstrate the performance of 
truncated Airy beams in FSOC links. By means of wave 
optics simulation (WOS), the effects of various truncation 
methods on the diffraction-free range are numerically 
examined. Reaching at the conclusion that the aperture 
truncated ideal Airy beam is diffracted least, we further 
investigate its scintillation behavior when the ballistic 
trajectory is dynamically controlled. Then, by blocking the 
main lobe at the initial plane or at the halfway point of 
propagation, we have managed to analyze the aperture-
averaged scintillation, as well as the mean Signal-to-Noise 
Ratio (SNR) of the regenerated main lobe. In addition to 
horizontal 
links, 
the 
propagation 
through 
vertically 
distributed turbulent atmosphere is also studied with non-
uniformly distributed phase screens. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II 
is intended to find out in the presence of a circular hard 
aperture, which truncation method enables the longest 
diffraction-free propagation distance. Then, in Section III, 
the self-accelerating and self-healing properties of truncated 
Airy beams are examined from the perspective of 
scintillation index. Section IV is a brief summary of the 
presented work.

In order to dynamically control the drop point, or the

Then, we can see that the acceleration of the ballistic is

controlled via υ at a specified distance ξ.

where sx = x/x0 and sy = y/x0, with the characteristic length in 
both directions assumed to be equal. 
As mentioned in the introduction, an ideal Airy beam 
exhibits infinite size and thus carries infinite energy, 
requiring truncation to restrict its power so that it can be 
physically realized. In the presence of truncation an Airy 
beam is no longer perfectly diffraction resistant. The specific 
truncation method matters a lot to its diffraction-free range.

In FSOC systems, the finite TX aperture forms a natural 
boundary, beyond which no beam wave field can exist. An 
ideal Airy beam truncated by the TX optics is called 
aperture-truncated ideal Airy (ati-Airy) beam, and its field in 
the initial plane can be written as

where circ () is a circle binary window and R is the radius of 
the TX aperture.  
Considering the rectangular shape of an Airy beam, to 
make full use of the circular aperture which is most common, 
we may not put the main lobe of the airy beam right in the 
center of the aperture. A feasible layout is illustrated in 
Figure 1 (a).  
The most intensively studied finite energy Airy beam so 
far, however, is the exponentially decaying Airy (ex-Airy) 
beam, which in the initial plane can be expressed as

Another way to truncate an infinite Airy beam is to apply 
a Gaussian apodization, which is called the Airy-Gauss (AiG) 
beam:

and ω is the width of the Gaussian

Since propagation distance is the major drawback of an 
FSOC system based on Airy beams, it is necessary to find 
out which truncation method in (5-7) enables the largest 
diffraction free range for a given TX aperture size and a 
constant Airy characteristic length. There is an analytic 
formula to calculate the non-diffraction range of an aperture 
truncated Airy beam [11], but there only the 1D case is 
considered and it is difficult to generalize to a 2D scenario 
where the Airy beam is truncated by a circular aperture. 
Also in [11], the authors have demonstrated that the 
expression for predicting the maximum propagation distance 
of ex-Airy beams in [12] is incorrect. As for the AiG beam, 
no prediction for the diffraction free range is available at all.  
Here, we try to find out the maximum diffraction-free 
range of truncated Airy beams with characteristic length x0 = 
25 mm, and the TX pupil radius is set as R = 200 mm. In 
order to make a fair comparison between the three truncation 
methods, the truncation parameters of the ex-Airy beam and 
the AiG beam should be adjusted so that the presence or 
absence of the specific aperture barely causes extra power 
loss. This is important because aperture truncation exists 
anyway for any source beam. Further, the optical power of 
all the beams in the launching plane is made equal. With the 
above considerations, the launching fields within the aperture 
are shown in Figure 1 (b-d), where the intensity distribution 
of an ideal, untruncated Airy beam is also given as a 
reference in Figure 1 (a). 
For more flexibility, we use the multi-step wave optics 
simulation (WOS), which is a numerical method based on 
the FFT version of the Fresnel diffraction integral [13], to

simulate the propagation process of those truncated Airy 
beams. Here, the diffraction free range is defined as the 
distance from the initial plane at which the full width at half 
maximum (FWHM) of the intensity peak of the main lobe 
doubles. And the FWHW of the main lobe is measured by its 
width on the diagonal of the quadrate Airy pattern. The 
evolution of intensity cross-section of the four Airy beams 
from Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2, and the corresponding 
measured FWHMs are given in Figure 3. It is clearly seen 
that apart from the ideal Airy beam, all the truncated beams 
are subjected to diffractive spreading beyond a certain 
distance. In comparison with the ex-Airy beam and the AiG 
beam, the ati-Airy beam has an obviously longer range of 
nearly diffraction-free propagation, which is about 27 km in 
this case, well consistent with the conclusion drawn in [11]. 
The other two counterparts, however, rapidly collapse 
beyond 18 km, and are thus excluded from further 
discussions below.

III. 
EFFECTS OF SELF-ACCELERATION AND SELF-HEALING 
ON SCINTILLATION IN ATMOSPHERIC TURBULENCE 
In Section II, we have made it clear that in terms of 
propagation distance, the ati-Airy beam performs better as an 
optical carrier than the ex-Airy beam and the AiG beam. And 
in this section we will find out how well ati-Airy beam’s 
self-acceleration and self-healing act in turbulent atmosphere. 
A. Self-acceleration 
Without external refractive-index potential along the 
whole optical path, the acceleration of lateral shift of an Airy 
beam is only dependent on the Airy characteristic length x0. 
If x0 is constant then in a specified meridian plane, there is 
only one possible initial velocity/launching angle for the 
main lobe to connect the transmitter with a certain receiver. 
But since in the 3D space there are numerous meridian 
planes, circumvents are possible if we just rotate the 2D 
launching beam pattern in the launching plane. Under 
conditions that the transceivers suffer from vibrations, 
dynamically controlled drop points can be useful in fast 
tracking.  
Now, we are interested in that whether the dynamic 
control of the ballistic trajectory would affect the turbulence 
reception performance. To this end, we will examine the 
scintillation index of an ati-Airy beam in a 20 km horizontal 
link. The transmitting beam is the ati-Airy beam shown in 
Figure 1(b), with x0 = 25 mm, and its main lobe adjusted to 
(0.1 m, 0.1 m) position in the launching plane to fully utilize 
the aperture with radius R = 200 mm. The drop point of the 
main lobe is controlled by υ through (3), ranging from x∈(0, 
0.5 m) in the receiver plane, and the free-space trajectories of 
the main lobe are plotted in Figure 4(a). The atmospheric 
channel is implemented through 17 evenly distributed phase 
screens, sampled by 512 points with 3 mm sampling 
intervals in each side. The scintillation is calculated by the 
normalized intensity flux variance of a D = 20 mm receiver 
centered on the main lobe intensity peak, and the results are 
shown in Figure 4(b). The minor fluctuations in the curve are 
mainly due to simulation inaccuracies, and it is safe to 
conclude that for truncated Airy beams, the scintillation 
behavior is not affected by the initial velocity control.

Figure 5.  Evolution of intensity profiles of an ati-Airy beam (a) without 
obstruction, (b) with the main lobe obstructed at the initial plane and (c) 
with the main lobe obstructed at 10 km. 
B. Self-healing  
Then we look into the self-healing of ati-Airy beams. 
Figure 5 illustrates the self-healing process of ati-Airy beams. 
Figure 
5(a) 
shows 
an 
unobstructed 
ati-Airy 
beam 
propagating in free space, while in Figure 5(b) the main lobe 
is obstructed in the initial plane, and in Figure 5(c) the 
obstruction in applied in the middle of the path, i.e. 10 km. 
We see that when the main lobe is obstructed in the initial 
plane, it is almost fully recovered at the receiver end. By 
comparison, if the obstruction happens halfway, the 
recovered main lobe seems much weaker in intensity. One 
reason for this is because in halfway the side lobes have 
already dispersed and thus are not able to provide as much 
power flow. The other reason is that the recovery distance in 
the case of Figure 5(c) is shorter than that in Figure 5(b). 
Anyway, in either case the receiver, located at the position 
where the main lobe is supposed to be, is able to detect the 
recovered signal so that the link will not fail. 
Next, we study the scintillation behavior of the ati-Airy 
beams with obstructions located at positions as shown in 
Figure 5(b, c). Nevertheless considering the fact that not all 
obstacles are totally opaque, we introduce the transparency 
of the obstacle as a variable τ, and the shape of the obstacle 
is a rectangle that just covers the main lobe of the Airy beam, 
see Figure 6 for the effect and shape of the obstacle in the 
initial plane. 
We will begin with a 20 km horizontal link then a 20 km 
vertical link. The horizontal atmospheric link parameters for 
simulation are the same as those used in Figure 4(b), only 
that  
 
Figure 6.  Shape and effect of the obstacle at the launching plane with 
transparency (a) τ = 0.3, (b) τ = 0.5, (c) τ = 0.7 and (d) τ = 1. 
the lateral shift is set to be zero. Three different receiver (RX) 
aperture sizes are considered, namely, 20 mm, 50 mm, and 
100 mm, all centered at the intensity peak of the receiving 
main lobe. Simulation results are shown in Figure 7. 
It seems neither the scintillation behavior nor the mean 
SNR is greatly affected, indicating that the self-healing 
process has perfectly counteracted the effects of the obstacle 
obstructing the main lobe in the launching plane. Similar 
results can be seen in Figure 8 in which case the main lobe is 
obstructed at 10 km, i.e. halfway of the path.

Until now we have investigated Airy beams propagating 
along a horizontal path. Taking advantage of the flexibility 
of wave optics simulation, we can further examine the 
performance of Airy beams in turbulent vertical paths. We 
simulated the case of a 20 km vertical turbulence channel 
where the H-V5-7 model [14] is applied with the ground-level 
turbulence set to 
2
n
C (0) = 1×10−14. To account for the 
altitude dependent 
2
n
C  profile, 17 nonuniformly distributed 
turbulence phase screens are used for accurate simulation of 
the channel. The obstacle is put at the halfway of the path, i.e. 
10 km, obstructing the main lobe. The results are shown in 
Figure 9, from which we can see that in the uplink, if the 
obstacle is translucent then the scintillation will increase a bit 
but if it is totally opaque, the scintillation even decreases 
compared with the case of no obstacle (τ = 0), and the 
resultant mean SNR can increase by 1 dB. While for the 
downlink, highly opaque obstacles will lead to increase 
scintillation and decreased SNR. 
In general, the self-healing of the ati-Airy beam makes it 
resistant to obstructions in its propagation path, as a result of 
which the reception performance is not heavily degraded. 
This can be explained this way: when the main lobe is 
blocked, the power of the adjacent side lobes begins to flow 
to the vacancy. Note that this self-healing flow of optical 
power comes from a larger area than that occupied by the 
original main lobe, giving rise to some area averaging in 
scintillation. This type of averaging also takes place in the 
propagation of self-focusing beams, such as RPCBs (Radial 
Partially Coherent Beams) [15], working in essentially the 
same mechanism with the well-known aperture averaging 
effect. 
 
Figure 9.  With the main lobe obstructed at 10 km, aperture-averaged 
scintillation and mean SNR of ati-Airy beams as a function of the obstacle 
transparency τ in a 20 km (a, b)uplink and (c, d) downlink. 
As can be seen from the results in this section, the self-
acceleration and self-healing of truncated Airy beams are 
barely affected by the presence of turbulence. Therefore, 
these beneficial properties can be exploited in atmospheric 
free-space laser communication channels. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
To investigate the feasibility of applying Airy beams in 
FSOC systems, we have firstly compared the diffraction-free 
range of three commonly used truncated Airy beams. With 
the presence of a hard aperture, an ideal Airy beam with no 
additional truncation (i.e., the ati-Airy beam) can propagate 
longer than the exponentially decaying Airy beam and the 
Airy-Gauss beam, making it more preferable for long-
distance FSOC links. Then, the scintillation behavior of ati-
Airy beams is studied when the lateral shift acceleration is 
controlled. It is found that varying the initial velocity will not 
obviously affect the reception quality. Moreover, the area 
scintillation and mean SNR of ati-Airy beams in the presence 
of an obstacle with varying transparency is examined. 
According to the simulation results, if either the main lobe of 
the beam is obstructed in the launching plane or in halfway, 
either in a horizontal or a vertical path, the reception 
performance maintains quite well. This strongly indicates 
that, the self-healing feature of an ati-Airy beam makes it 
resistant to obstacles blocking the propagation path and can 
thus benefit the link robustness a lot.  
In the following research, we will investigate the 
feasibility of applying truncated symmetrical Airy beams in 
long distance free-space laser communications.
