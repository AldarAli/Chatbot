Abstract- We investigate whether N-Back working memory 
(WM) training improves both trained WM- and untrained 
cognitive function performance (transfer effects). Previous 
studies showed that EEG responses, in particular Event Related 
Potentials (ERPs), can be used as a measure of working memory 
load during cognitive task performance. Here, we used three 
groups of young healthy participants to assess the effect of N-
Back training: cognitive training group (CTG), active control 
group (ACG) and passive control group (PCG). The cognitive 
training group performed an N-Back task with 3 difficulty levels 
(1, 2, 3-Back), the active control group used the same task but 
with lower difficulty levels (0, 1, 2-Back), and the control group 
no N-Back training at all. Pre- and post-tests were administered 
to all three groups to gauge any transfer effects (partial 
memory, attention, reasoning and intelligence). Our results 
showed that training improved N-Back task performance for 
CTG participants compared to ACG and PCG participants. In 
contrast, transfer effects were not so clear across cognitive tasks 
but transfer effects were present and stronger in CTG 
compared to ACG for attention (TOVA test).

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Working memory (WM), as defined by Baddeley [1], 
refers to a brain system that provides temporary storage and 
manipulation of information necessary to execute complex 
cognitive tasks. WM training was originally used to enhance 
WM in neuropsychiatric subjects with a WM deficit, such as 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [2] and 
several authors studied the mechanisms behind and the effect 
of WM training [3][4].  
The N-back task is a working memory task introduced by 
Wayne Kirchner in 1958 [24] as a visuo-spatial task with four 
load factors (‘‘0-Back’’ to ‘‘3-Back’’), and by Mackworth 
[23] as a visual letter task with up to six load factors. Gevins 
et al. [5] introduced it to the field of neuroscience by using it 
as a ‘‘visuomotor memory task’’ with one load factor (3-
Back). The task involves multiple processes and is considered 
a dual task: working memory updating, which involves the 
encoding of incoming stimuli, the monitoring, maintenance, 
and updating the sequence, and stimulus matching (matching 
the current stimulus to the one that occurred N positions back 
in the sequence). It reflects a number of core Executive 
Functions (EFs) besides working memory, such as inhibitory 
control and cognitive flexibility, as well as other higher-order 
EFs, such as problem solving, decision making, selective 
attention, among others [6]. The N-Back task requires 
participants to maintain simultaneously stimulus information 
necessary for successful task performance in working 
memory across multiple trials [6]. It has been shown that the 
N-Back task consistently activates dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex (DLPFC), as well as parietal regions in the adult brain 
[7]. Schneiders et al. [8] have shown that, using a N-Back 
training, it is possible to achieve an improvement in task 
performance and an alteration in brain activity, such as a 
decreased activation in the right superior middle frontal gyrus 
(BA 6) and posterior parietal regions (BA 40).  
Following a series of studies, Jaeggi et al. [9][10] reported 
that by performing an N-Back task, the effects of WM 
training transfer to untrained tasks requiring WM (transfer 
effects) and improve upon a complex human ability known 
as fluid intelligence. Jaeggi et al.’s [9] findings support the 
hypothesis that transfer effects to general cognitive functions 
can be achieved after single and dual N-Back training for 
tasks that conceptually overlap, albeit only slightly, with the 
N-Back. Training of the general fronto-parietal WM network 
should lead to improvements in cognitive functions that rely 
on the same network [2]. This general overlap hypothesis 
predicts that if training considerably engages the fronto-
parietal WM network and the transfer task generates a similar 
activation pattern, an extensive training of this network will 
yield a general boosting of cognitive functions. An alternative 
hypothesis predicts that WM training effects transfer only if 
training improves specific cognitive processes required in 
both training and transfer tasks. Dahlin et al. [11] found 
transfer, after WM updating training, to an N-Back task that 
resembled the original trained task in also relying on updating 
processes, but not to a Stroop task that involved inhibition but 
no updating.

The aim of our study was to verify whether N-Back task 
performance improves and whether transfer effects to other 
(untrained) cognitive functions are obtained, such as spatial 
memory, attention and reasoning, in three different groups of 
healthy young subjects: cognitive training group (CTG), 
active control group (ACG) and passive control group (PCG). 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we 
describe the material and methods (subjects, procedure, EEG 
recording). In Section 3, we focus on the behavioral and 
ERPs results using a WM training and on the transfer effects 
pre and post-training. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss our 
results and propose a number of technical and conceptual 
goals for future studies. 
  
 
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
In this section we describe the participants, procedure and 
EEG recording. 
A. Subjects 
We recruited 16 healthy young subjects (6 females, mean 
age 29 years, range 24-34 years), undergraduate or graduate 
students from KU Leuven and non- students. Participants 
were healthy, reported normal or corrected vision, no history 
of psychiatric or neurological diseases, they were not taking 
any medications and never participated in working memory 
training.  Participants were assigned to three sub-groups, 
cognitive training (N=6), active control (N=5) and passive 
control group (N=5), to evaluate improvements in task 
performance after the WM training and to record any transfer 
effects to other cognitive tasks (see further for their 
definition). During all training sessions, EEG was recorded 
(see also further). In the cognitive training group, 3 subjects 
performed WM training with visual feedback on the 
correctness of their behavioral response and other 3 subjects 
with monetary reward (with a maximum of 10 € if all 
responses are correct), however, the sample turned out to be 
too small to reveal any significant differences. The active 
control group performed the same training task, but the 
difficulty level was lower (0, 1, 2-Back task) and with 
monetary reward (max. 10 €/session). The control group did 
not undergo any training. A battery of cognitive tests were 
administered before and after training (pre and post-tests, 
note that for the control group there was no training between 
these tests) to see if there were transfer effects in attention, 
spatial memory, reasoning and intelligence. The study was 
approved by our university’s ethical committee and informed 
consent was obtained from our subjects prior to their 
participation in the experiment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. Procedure  
Subjects participated in an N-back task in which, see 
Figure 2, a sequence of stimuli were shown and the task was 
to decide whether the current stimulus matched the one 
presented N items earlier.  
The stimuli were presented for 1000ms followed by a 
2000ms Inter-stimulus interval (ISI), adding jitter of ± 100 
ms, during which the picture is replaced by a fixation cross. 
This is the moment where the participants needed to press the 
button if the stimulus was a target; 33% of our pictures were 
targets.  
Sequences with identical difficulty levels (all 0-back, 1-
back, 2-back, 3-back) were grouped into 2 min. blocks across 
four sessions. Each session included two repetitions of 3 
sequences. In total there were 8 blocks. For each sequence, 
there were 60 stimuli presented in pseudorandom order. 
Before starting with the first three sequences, a training 
session consisting of ten stimuli for each difficulty level was 
administered to explain the N-Back task. 
 
 
 
Subjects performed an N-Back training during 10 sessions, 3 
times per week (30 minutes each time), as shown in Figure 1. 
This is in line with literature reports on significant training 
and transfer effects obtained after 3 weeks of training [9][12]-
[15].

All participants were administered a battery of pre- and post-
tests to evaluate whether there were transfer effects to other 
cognitive functions (attention, spatial memory, reasoning and 
intelligence). We used Test of Variables of Attention 
(TOVA) [16], Spatial Working Memory Test (CORSI) [17] 
and Raven test [19]. The behavioral pre- and post-tests were 
administered to compare task performance between groups 
(cognitive training, active control and passive control groups) 
in the trained (N-Back task) and untrained tasks (TOVA, 
CORSI and Raven test). 
N-back task and transfer tasks had similarities and 
differences [9][19][20]. The spatial memory task (Corsi test) 
engaged WM updating processes just as the N-Back task, but 
differed in stimuli (squares in Corsi task vs pictures in the N-
Back task) and task rules (recognition of previously presented 
items in the N-Back tasks vs. recollection of items in the 
updating transfer tasks). Given these similarities and 
differences, we are using near transfer tasks according to 
Karbach and Kray [21]. 
In the first experimental session (pre-test), each 
participant was informed about the experimental procedure 
and invited to sign the informed consent form. The day after 
the first meeting, the participants performed the behavioral 
pre-test session, and from the third meeting, the two training 
groups (CTG, ACG) started their training procedure of CTG 
and ATG participants were not informed about the group to 
which they were assigned or its purpose. At the beginning of 
each training session, an EOG calibration session was 
performed to capture eye movements and blinks using the 
method described in Croft & Barry [22]. 
 
C. EEG recording  
EEG was recorded continuously from 32 Ag/AgCl 
electrodes at a sampling rate of 2 kHz using a SynampsRT 
device (Neuroscan, Australia). The electrodes were placed at 
O1,Oz, O2, PO3, PO4, P8, P4, Pz, P3, P7, TP9, CP5, CP1, 
CP2, CP6, TP10, T7, C3, Cz, C4, T8, FC6, FC2, FC1, FC5, 
F3, Fz, F4, AF3, AF4, Fp1, Fp2. The reference was placed at 
AFz and the ground at CPz. Additionally, four electrodes 
were placed around the eyes, on the upper and lower side of 
the left eye (vertical) and near the external canthus of each 
eye (horizontal), for electro-oculogram recording (EOG, bi-
polar recording). 
The recorded EEG signal was re-referenced oﬄine from the 
original reference to the average of two mastoid electrodes 
(TP9 & TP10), corrected for eye movement and blinking 
artifacts [22], band-pass filtered in the range of 0.1–315Hz, 
and cut into epochs starting 200 ms pre- till 1000 ms post-
stimulus onset. Baseline correction is performed by 
subtracting the average of the 200 ms pre-stimulus onset 
activity from the 1000 ms post-stimulus onset activity. 
Finally, the epochs are down sampled to 64 Hz and stored for 
ERP detection.  
Recorded epochs with incorrect responses were excluded 
from further analysis.  In addition, epochs with EEG signals 
greater than 100mV were excluded from analysis. A two-way  
ANOVA (factors: n-back X target) was performed on all 
sampled EEG time points between -300 ms to 700 ms.  
 
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used 
across all samples within this time window.    
 
III. 
RESULTS 
In this section we describe working memory training 
(behavioral and ERPs results) and transfer effects pre and 
post-tests. 
 
A. Working memory training (behavioral)  
In Figures 3 and 4, we analyzed changes due to cognitive 
training by examining behavioral data (accuracy, reaction 
time (RT)) of CTG and ACG during N-Back training (10 
sessions). The purpose is to test our second hypothesis: 
training can improve related cognitive function performance, 
and also transfer to other cognitive functions, in terms of RT 
and response accuracy revealed significant effects.  
For the CTG, we observed a reduction in RT with an 
increased number of training sessions. To test this, we 
performed a three-way ANOVA across factors (N-back level, 
subject and session). We found a significant effect of session 
(F(9)=4.9, p<0.001) confirming that RT indeed decreases with 
more training. Importantly, the N-Back x session interaction 
was significant (F(18)=3.01, p<0.001), which indicates that the 
N-back levels  are differentially affected by training. In 
contrast, when we looked at accuracy, the  main effect of 
session was not significant (p=0.56) indicating that accuracy 
did not substantially increase as a result of training although 
there was a main effect of N-back level confirming that task 
difficulty affected performance (F(2)=7.97, p<0.05). 
For the active control group (ACG), RT decreases. It is 
significant for N-Back x session (F(18)=1.95, p<0.05), and for 
subject x session interactions (F(18)=4.84, p<0.001). This 
indicates that the number of training sessions is subject and 
task-specific. Accuracy differences were significant for N-
Back x subject interaction (F(4)=6.8, p<0.001), N-Back x 
session interaction (F(18)=2.31, p<0.05), and for subject x 
session interaction (F(18)=2.54, p<0.05), which means that N-
Back and training session are subject-specific, and N-Back is 
affected by the number of training sessions.

We observed significant effects between the two groups 
(CTG, ACG): the accuracy between CTG and ACG was 
significant for N-Back (F(1)=8.26, p<0.05), and group 
(F(1)=18.39, p<0.001). The RT in the two groups was 
significant for session (F(9)=3.44, p<0.001) and group 
(F(1)=7.02, p<0.05). 
 
B. Working memory training (ERPs results) 
 
As neuroimaging studies have shown that during N-Back task 
performance the most activated brain regions are the lateral 
premotor cortex, dorsal cingulate and medial premotor 
cortex, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, 
frontal poles, and medial and lateral posterior parietal cortex 
[5], and several studies showed that the midline electrodes are 
the most significant [25][26], we decided to analyze ERPs 
using electrodes located over these areas: Fz, Pz, and Cz. 
Figure 5 has shown a peak in P300 amplitude in three 
different moments (3 sessions/each moment) during training 
(first-, middle- and last sessions). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Data from mean P300 peak amplitude is presented in Figures 
5 and 6. P300 peak amplitude data from midline electrodes 
(Fz, Cz, Pz) were analyzed with a three-way ANOVA (N-
Back, target, and N-Back x target). P300 peak amplitude 
(target minus no-target) was higher for the N-Back difficulty 
levels that were easier (1 and 2-Back), and was lower for the 
more difficult one (3-Back). P300 peak amplitude (difference 
between target and no-target) was largest for the frontal 
electrode (Fz) and decreased for the central (Cz) and posterior 
electrodes (Pz). Furthermore, the P300 peak amplitude 
decreased progressively from the easiest task (0 or 1-Back) 
to the most difficult one (3-Back). 
As a result of working memory training, the P300 peak 
became higher also for the most difficult task (3-Back). All 
together, these data support the observation that the P300 
peak amplitude decreases with increased task load/difficulty, 
and with WM training it is possible to increase it also for the 
more difficult task. 
 
C. Transfer effects (Pre- and Post-tests) 
Means for each task are presented in Table 1 for the pre- 
and post-tests. In Figures 7 and 8, a multivariate ANOVA 
(MANOVA) was conducted between groups (CTG, ACG 
and PCG) and between sessions (pre- and post-tests). 
Significant effects for accuracy in N-Back task between CTG 
and PCG (F(1)=6.21, p<0.05), and between CTG and ACG 
(F(1)=14.21, p<0.05) for pre- and post-testing, were observed 
as well as significant effects in pre- and post-testing for 
accuracy in TOVA between CTG and ACG (F(1)=8.18, 
p<0.05) and between ACG and PCG (F(1)=5.24, p<0.05). No 
significant differences in CORSI and RAVEN test accuracies 
between groups were found. 
For the N-Back task, significant effects were found for 
RT between CTG and PCG, for pre- and post-tests (F(1)=40.9, 
p<0.001), for task difficulty level (F(2)=4.92, p<0.05),  for 
group x pre- and post-test interaction (F(1)=9.14, p<0.05), and 
for pre- and post-test x N-Back level interaction (F(2)=3.54,

(F(1)=25.6, p<0.001), and for task difficulty level (F(2)=7.45, 
p<0.001), and between ACG and PCG for pre- and post-test 
(F(1)=10.48, p<0.05). 
In summary, with our pre- and post-training tests, we 
wanted to verify whether any transfer effects could be 
obtained after N-Back training. Our results show clear 
improvements in attention.    
 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
We investigated whether cognitive training using an N-
Back task improves only N-Back task performance or does it 
transfer to other tasks. To assess this, we performed 10 N-
Back training sessions in one group of participants (CTG) and 
assessed their cognitive performance for a battery of 
cognitive tasks (N-Back, TOVA, CORSI and Raven test) 
before and after training. During training, CTG participants 
performed the 1-,2-3-Back version of the N-Back task. To 
assess whether the level of difficulty affected training 
outcome, a second group of participants (ACG) performed 
the same experiment but with the 0-,1-2-Back versions of the 
N-Back task. Finally, a third group of participants (PCG) 
performed no training but was subjected to the same battery 
of cognitive tests. We found that training indeed improves 
performance for the CTG group compared to both the ACG 
and the PCG groups. Therefore, there is a clear improvement 
for the trained group on the task they were trained on. In 
contrast, the transfer of training effects into other tasks is 
more nuanced and although there was a trend for training 
effects in CTG to be stronger than for ACG this was only 
significant for the TOVA tests. These results are in contrast 
with the conclusions of Jaeggi at al. (2008) [9] who showed 
that a working memory task improves working memory and 
also fluid intelligence, and the study of Dahlin et al. [11] 
found that working memory training improves another 
working memory task but not other cognitive functions. 
An issue that deserves consideration is why N-Back 
training in our study did not produce transfer effects in 
CORSI test (spatial memory) while in Dahlin et al. [11] they 
observed transfer effects to another memory task.  In our 
view, this difference could be related to the size of the 
sample. Furthermore, as the EEG results from our study 
suggest a change in the P300 during the cognitive training, 
future study will consider not only the behavioral data 
(accuracy and RT), but also P300 component to change in 
real time the difficulty level of the task, avoiding too much 
fatigue or boredom for the subject. 
In conclusion, we showed that N-Back training not only 
improves WM but also transfers improvement to another 
cognitive function (attention). The results provide evidence 
that it is possible to improve not only performance of tasks 
that include the same cognitive function (working memory), 
but also other cognitive tasks, as attention in our case.
