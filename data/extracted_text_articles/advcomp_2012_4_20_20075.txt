Abstract—The main subject of the current paper is 
investigation of yield stress for C45 grade steel as well as 
development of a new methodology of such investigation. The 
method requires high accuracy model of semi-solid steel 
deformation. Hence, it requires a dedicated hybrid analytical-
numerical model of deformation of steel with variable density. 
The newly developed methodology allows to compute curves 
depending on both temperature and strain rate. The 
experimental work has been done in Institute for Ferrous 
Metallurgy in Gliwice Poland using Gleeble thermo-
mechanical 
simulator 
with 
high 
temperature 
testing 
equipment. A number of compression and tension tests have 
been done in order to verify the predictive ability of both the 
developed model and new, modified testing methodology. The 
comparison between numerical and experimental results is the 
supplementary subject of the presented paper, as well.  
The 
developed 
methodology 
allows 
reliable 
numerical 
simulation of deformation of semi-solid steel samples and 
calculation of realistic flow curve parameters. 
Keywords-yield stress; semi-solid steel testing; extra-high

 INTRODUCTION 
Due to the global energy crisis in recent years, more and 
more 
new 
production 
technologies 
require 
energy 
preservation and environmental protection. The integrated 
casting and rolling technologies are newest efficient and 
very profitable ways of hot strip production. Only few 
companies all over the world are able to manage such 
processes. The technical staff of a plant located in Cremona, 
Italy is working on new methods of flat steel manufacturing 
for several years now. The ISP (Inline Strip Production) and 
AST (Arvedi Steel Technologies) technologies which are 
developed in Cremona are distinguished by very high 
rolling temperature. The main benefits of both the methods 
are related to very low rolling forces and favourable field of 
temperature. However, certain problems particular to such 
metal treatment arise. The central parts of slabs are mushy 
and the solidification is not yet finished while the 
deformation is in progress. This results in changes in 
material 
density 
and 
occurrence 
of 
characteristic 
temperatures having great influence on the plastic behaviour 
of the material [1, 2]. The nil strength temperature (NST), 
strength 
recovery 
temperature 
(SRT), 
nil 
ductility 
temperature (NDT) and ductility recovery temperature 
(DRT) have effect on steel plastic behaviour and limit 
plastic deformation. The nil strength temperature (NST) is 
the temperature level at which material strength drops to 
zero while the steel is being heated above the solidus 
temperature. Another temperature associated with NST is 
the 
strength 
recovery 
temperature 
(SRT). 
At 
this 
temperature the cooled material regains strength greater than 
0.5 N/mm2. Nil ductility temperature (NDT) represents the 
temperature at which the heated steel loses its ductility. The 
ductility recovery temperature (DRT) is the temperature at 
which the ductility of the material (characterised by 
reduction of area) reaches 5% while it is being cooled. Over 
this temperature the plastic deformation is not allowed at 
any stress tensor configuration. 
 The most important steel property having crucial 
influence on metal flow paths is the yield stress. In the 
literature of the past years, one can find papers regarding 
experimental results [3] and modelling [4] of non-ferrous 
metals. Both the mentioned contributions focus mainly on 
tixotrophy. The first results regarding steel deformation at 
extra high temperature were only presented in the past few 
years [5]. This stems from the fact that level of liquidus and 
solidus temperatures of steel is very high in comparison 
with non-ferrous metals. It causes serious experimental 
problems contrary to deformation tests for non-ferrous 
metals which are much easier. Rising abilities of thermo-
mechanical simulators such as the Gleeble and development 
of new methods of identification of mechanical properties 
allow investigations leading to strain-stress relationships for 
semi-solid steels, as well. This problem became a subject of 
research done by authors of the presented paper for several 
years now. As a result a computer system supporting the 
investigation of mushy steel has been developed [6]. The 
current paper presents the modified methodology, which 
allows the calculation of the real stress-strain relationships 
for a wide range of temperatures and strain rate.

In the second section of the paper the modified methodology 
of stress-strain curves is described, the second one presents 
a mathematical model, in the last section an example results 
are presented. Finally, the main conclusions and future work 
are shortly described.  
II. 
THE METHODOLOGY 
Due to several serious experimental problems a special 
technique of testing was developed for temperatures higher 
than NDT. The deformation process has been divided into 
two main stages. The first one – a very small preliminary 
compression and the second one – the ultimate compression. 
The preliminary deformation is meant to eliminate 
clearances in the testing equipment. Well known Voce 
formula [6] has been applied to describe the yield stress 
functions. It takes account of a number of coefficients which 
are calculated using inverse analysis. This is the only 
acceptable method of interpretation of compression of semi-
solid steel testing results. Due to strong temperature and 
strain inhomogeneity observed during compression of semi-
solid samples the deformation causes significant barrelling 
of their central parts. Improvement of experimental 
methodology can help only to a small extent. Contrary to 
the old version of the method published in [6] the newly 
developed one allows the computation of curves depending 
on both temperature and strain rate. The tension tests has 
been replaced by compression ones and the Voce formula 
was 
replaced 
by 
more 
adequate 
equation.  
Fig. 1 schematically presents the modified methodology. 
More details concerning the experimental work were 
published in  [7].

investigation of semi-solid steel. 
The presented approach allows to compute realistic yield 
stress curves depending on strain, temperature and strain rate 
in temperature range from 1200oC to NDT and above. The 
objective function of the inverse analysis was defined as a 
square root error of discrepancies between calculated (Fc) 
and measured (Fm) loads at several subsequent steps of the 
compression process. The experimental values of the 
deformation forces were collected by the Gleeble equipment 
while the theoretical ones (Fc) were calculated with the help 
of a sophisticated solver facilitating accurate computation of 
strain, stress and temperature fields for materials with 
variable density. This solver is the least visible but the most 
powerful part of the computer aided testing system 
developed by the authors called Def_Semi_Solid (Fig. 2). 
The heart of the solver is based on a hybrid analytical-
numerical mushy steel deformation model described in the 
next section.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL 
A mathematical model of the compression process has 
been developed using the theory of plastic flow. The 
principle of the upper assessment, calculus of variations, 
approximation theory, optimization and numerical methods 
for solving partial differential equations were used [8]. The 
following assumptions were established: 
• 
Deformation and stress state are axial-symmetrical; 
• 
Deformed material is isotropic but inhomogeneous; 
• 
The material behaviour is rigid-plastic – the 
relationship between the stress tensor and strain rate 
tensor is calculated according to the Levy-Mises 
flow law [8], which is given as: 
 
 −

  =

   
(1) 
Rigid-plastic model was selected due to its very good 
accuracy at the strain field during the hot deformation and 
sufficient correctness of calculated deviatoric part of the 
stress field. Moreover, the elastic part of each stress tensor 
component is very low at temperatures close to solidus line 
and can in practice be neglected in calculations of strain 
distribution. The limits for plastic metal behaviour are 
defined according to Huber-Mises-Hencky yield criterion:

In cylindrical coordinate system  the solution is a 
vector velocity field defined by the distribution of three 
coordinates  = !", $, %& . The field is a result of 
optimization of a power functional, which can be written in 
general form as the sum of power necessary to run the main 
physical phenomena related to plastic deformation. Due to 
the axial-symmetry of the sample the circumferential 
component of the velocity field can be neglected and the 
functional is usually formulated as: 
 
'( ) = * = * + * + + *, 
(4) 
Component *  occurring in (4) represents the plastic 
deformation power, * + is the power which is a penalty for 
the departure from mass conservation condition, *, denotes 
the friction power and  = !", %& describes the reduced 
velocity field distribution.  
Rigid-plastic formulation of metal deformation problem 
requires the condition of mass conservation in the 
deformation zone. In case of solids and liquids with a 
constant density, this condition can be simplified to the 
incompressibility condition. Such a condition is generally 
satisfied with sufficient accuracy during the optimization of 
functional (4). In most solutions a slight, but noticeable loss 
of volume is observed. The loss  occurs because the 
incompressibility condition imposed on the solution is not 
completely satisfied in numerical form. It is negligible in 
case of traditional computer simulation of deformation 
processes although in some embodiments more accurate 
methods are used to restore the volume of metal subjected to 
the deformation. In contrast, in the presented case the density 
of semi-solid materials varies during the deformation process 
and these changes result in a physically significant change in 
the volume of a body having constant mass. The size of the 
volume loss due to numerical errors is comparable with 
changes caused by fluctuation in the density of the material. 
A further problem specific to the variable density 
continuum is power * +, which occurs in functional (4). It is 
used in most solutions and has a significant share of total 
power. Even when the iterative process approaches the end, 
this power component is still significant, especially if the 
convergence of the optimization procedures is insufficient. In 
case of discretization of the deformation area (e.g. using the 
finite element method) if one focuses solely on the * + a 
number of possible locally optimal solutions appear. They 
are related to a number of possible directions of movement 
of discretization nodes providing the volume preservation of 
the deformation zone. Each of these solutions creates a local 
optimum for * + power and thus for the entire functional (4). 
This makes it difficult to optimize because of lack of uniform 
direction of fall of total power which leads to global 
optimum. The material density fluctuation causes further 
optimization 
difficulties, 
resulting 
from 
additional 
replacement of incompressibility condition with a full 
condition of mass conservation. 
The proposed solution requires high accuracy in ensuring 
the incompressibility condition for the solid material or mass 
conservation condition for the semi-solid areas. This stems 
from the fact that the errors resulting from the breach of 
these conditions can be treated as a volume change caused 
by the steel density variation in the semi-solid zone. High 
accuracy solution is required also due to large differences in 
yield stress for the individual subareas of the deformation 
zone. In the discussed temperature range they appear due to 
even slight fluctuations in temperature. In presented solution 
the second component of functional (4) is left out and mass 
conservation condition is given in analytical form 
constraining the radial ("& and longitudinal !%& velocity 
field components. The functional takes the following shape: 
 
'( ) = * + * - 
(5) 
In case of functional (5), the numerical optimisation 
procedure converges faster than the one for functional (4) 
due to the reduced number of velocity field parameters (only 
radial components are optimisation parameters) and the lack 
of numerical form of mass conservation condition. The 
accuracy of the proposed hybrid solution is higher also due 
to negligible volume loss caused by numerical errors, which 
is very important for materials with variable density. 
As mentioned before, the solution of the problem is a 
velocity field in cylindrical coordinate system in axial-
symmetrical state of deformation. Optimization of metal 
flow velocity field in the deformation zone of semi-
variational problem requires the formulation according to 
equation (5). The radial velocity distribution "!, , & and 
the longitudinal one %!, , &  are so complex that such 
wording in the global coordinate system poses considerable 
difficulties. These difficulties are the result of the mutual 
dependence of these velocities. Therefore the basic 
formulation will be written for the local cylindrical 
coordinate system   with a view to the future 
discretization of deformation area using one of the dedicated 
methods. In addition one will find that the deformation of 
cylindrical samples is characterized by axial symmetry. As 
demonstrated by experimental studies conducted using semi-
solid samples the symmetry may be disturbed only as a result 
of unexpected leakage of liquid phase. 
Such experiments, however, are regarded as unsuccessful 
and not subject to numerical analysis. Establishment of the 
axial symmetry, which except in cases of physical instability 
can be considered valid also for the process of compression 
or tensile test of semi-solid samples, allows one to simplify 
the model because of the identical strain distribution at any 
axial sample cross-section. Considerations will therefore be 
carried out in  coordinates for the sample cross-section 
using one of the planes containing the sample axis. 
Components of power functional given by (5) have been 
formulated in accordance with the general theory of

deformation zone having volume of .  is given by the 
subsequent relation:

where  is the effective stress and   denotes the effective 
strain. The plastic deformation starts when the rising 
effective stress reaches yield stress limit    (  =  ) 
according to yield criterion given by equation (2). Effective 
strain occurring in (6) is calculated on the basis of the strain

The components are given by (3). The second component of 
functional (5) is responding for friction. To compute friction 
power on the boundary 3 of area . a model given by the 
subsequent equation was used:

(8) 
In (8), 4 is the so called friction factor, which is usually 
experimentally selected and  7 is a relative velocity vector of 
metal and tool  7 =  −  8. In case of tensile test the samples 
are permanently fixed in jaws of a physical simulator and 
friction must not be taken into account. However, 
compression test requires sharing the friction power which is 
significant. 
For the solid zones the incompressibility condition can be 
described by universal operator equation independently of 
the mechanical state of the deformation process: 
 
∇9 =  0 
(9) 
Because the semi-solid zone is characterized by density 
change due to still ongoing progress of steel solidification, 
the condition of incompressibility is inadequate to reflect 
changes and was replaced with the mass conservation 
condition, 
which 
describes 
the 
following 
modified 
operational equation:

The basis for the optimization of functional (5) is the 
velocity field determined by appropriate system of velocity 
functions in the concerned area. These functions are then the 
source of deformation field and other physical quantities 
affecting the power functional formulation. Obtaining an 
accurate real velocity field requires the use of velocity 
functions depending on a number of variational parameters. 
The functions should be flexible enough to map the field 
throughout the whole volume of the deformation zone. 
Analytical description of each component of the velocity 
field with a single function in the whole area of deformation 
is not preferred. This approach creates difficulties especially 
in areas not subjected to the deformation where the velocity 
function should remain constant. Therefore, the solution to 
the problem of semi-solid metal flow was based on a specific 
method. 
In the case of deformation of axial-symmetrical bodies, 
the incompressibility condition is given by following 
differential equation:

(11) 
For the semi-solid area, (11) is replaced by the mass 
conservation condition due to existing density changes. The 
longitudinal velocity has been calculated as an analytical 
function of radial velocity using this condition. In cylindrical 
coordinate system the condition has been described with an 
equation:

Equation (11) is a special case of (12) and therefore the 
proposed solution will consider the dependence (12) as more 
general. In (12) A is the temporary material density and B is 
the time variable. The proposed variational formulation 
makes the longitudinal velocity dependent on the radial one. 
Condition (12) allows for the calculation of C%/C 
derivative as a function of C"/C  after analytical 
differentiation of radial velocity distribution function 
"!, &. Hence, the longitudinal velocity is calculated as a 
result of analytical integration according to following 
equation:

(13) 
In this case, the velocity field depends only on one function – 
the radial velocity distribution. 
Heat exchange between solid metal and environment, and 
its flow inside the metal is controlled by a number of factors. 
During phase transformation two additional phenomena have 
to be taken into account. Note that in the process of 
deformation of steel at temperature of liquid to solid phase 
transformation there are two sources of heat changes.  On the 
one hand heat is generated due to the state transformation. 
On the other hand it is secreted as a result of plastic 
deformation. In addition, steel density variations also cause 
changes of  body temperature. 
Thermal solution has a major impact on simulation 
results, since the temperature has strong effect on remaining 
variables. This is especially evident if the specimen 
temperature is close to solidus line when the body consist of 
both solid and semi-solid regions. In such case the affected 
phenomena are: plastic flow of solid and mushy materials, 
stress evolution and density changes. The theoretical 
temperature field is a solution of Fourier-Kirchhoff equation 
with appropriate boundary conditions.

The micro and macrostructure of the tested samples were

the heating zone. Microstructure of the cooled samples 
consists of pearlite (the darkest phase), bainite (grey phase 
mainly near the borders of grains) and the bright ferrite. 
This is a result of  phase composition, wide melting zone 
and almost two times lower rate of cooling of central parts

tests 
were 
performed, 
according to the given methodology. During experiments 
die displacement, force and temperature changes in the 
deformation zone were recorded. The computer simulations 
were performed as well. All series of tests and computer 
simulations were done using long contact zone between 
samples and simulator jaws (cold handle). The deformation 
zone had the initial height of 62.5 mm. The sample diameter 
was 10 mm. The samples were melted at 1430oC, and then 
cooled to deformation temperature. During the tests each 
sample was subjected to 10 mm reduction of height. Results 
of each test were used for inverse analysis to compute yield 
stress curve parameters. Fig. 8 shows strain-stress curves at 
several strain rate levels for temperature 1300oC. The 
relationships were calculated using presented experimental 
methodology.

the developed computer aided experimental methodology. 
Results of such comparison are presented in Table 1. The 
table shows results for samples which have been subjected 
to deformation at several levels of temperature, i.e., 1300oC, 
1350oC and 1380oC. Good agreement between the real 
diameter 
and 
its 
calculated 
value 
is 
observed.  
The relative mean square error between both the values is 
equal to 2.76%.

Fig. 11 compares measured loads with those computed 
using the methodology previously used by the authors. One 
can see that the mean square error in this case is 
significantly greater than its equivalent for the newly 
developed method.

The main reason for that is the lack of strain rate 
dependency of yield stress in the old model. The results 
obtained taking into account the strain rate as a parameter of 
the flow curve are more accurate for temperatures exceeding 
the NDT level.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The investigation reported in the current paper has 
shown, that temperature distribution inside the controlled 
semi-solid volume is strongly heterogeneous and non-
uniform. Axial-symmetrical model does not take into 
account all the physical phenomena accompanying the 
deformation. Finally, the error of the predicted strain-stress 
curves can still be improved. The proposed solution of the 
presented problem is application of both fully three-
dimensional solution and more adequate solidification 
model taking into consideration evolution of  forming steel 
microstructure. Therefore, the study of multiscale modelling 
of mechanical properties is the main target of the future 
work. Contrary to the current model the new approach 
should allow to better capture the physical principles of 
semi-solid steel deformation in micro-scale. Additionally, 
the methodology should allow to transfer the characteristics 
of the material behaviour between the micro- and  macro-
scale. As a consequence the final results should be more 
precise and accurate. Modelling of deformation of steel 
samples at extra-high temperatures involves a number of 
issues. One of them is the difficulty of calculating of 
thermal and mechanical material properties. Another most 
important problem is the right interpretation of the results of 
compression tests that provide data for flow stress 
calculation. The presented testing methodology allows 
reliable numerical simulation of deformation of semi-solid 
steel samples and calculation of realistic flow curve 
parameters. The presented research was focused on 
mechanical properties of investigated semi-solid steel. 
Compression tests carried out for semi-solid materials could 
only be interpreted using inverse analysis. Temperature 
strain and strain rate as a parameters of the flow curve 
provide accurate results of computer simulation of semi-
solid steel behaviour.
