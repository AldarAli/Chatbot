Abstract—This paper presents the system validation of an 
integrated Personal Health System for supporting elderly 
remote monitoring and services. Objective of the trial as a whole 
is the assessment of reliability, effectiveness and usability of the 
SMARTA system. Outcomes from the validation tests were 
more than good for the system’s reliability and all subjects 
assessed that they consider the system easy to use and that they 
will positively consider its introduction in their houses.

 INTRODUCTION 
The SMARTA project (acronym for the Italian title 
“Sistema di Monitoraggio Ambientale con Rete di sensori e 
Telemonitoraggio indossabile a supporto di servizi di salute, 
prevenzione e sicurezza per l'Active Aging”, i.e., 
Environmental Monitoring System through a sensors 
network and wearable tele-monitoring to support health, 
prevention and security services for Active Aging)explored 
the validation and exploitation of innovative technologies 
about future healthcare services dedicated to elderly for 
Ambient Assisted Living and for a more accurate, 
personalized and widespread management of geriatric 
pathologies. In fact, two billion people will be aged 60 and 
older by 2050 [1]. This represents both challenges and 
opportunities. Older people make important contributions to 
society as family members, volunteers and as active 
participants in the workforce. The wisdom they have gained 
through life experience makes them a vital social resource. 
However, along with these benefits come special health 
challenges for the 21st century. It is important to prepare 
health providers and societies to meet the specific needs of 
older populations [2]. This includes: (1) training for health 
professionals on old-age care, (2) preventing and managing 
age-associated chronic diseases, (3) designing sustainable 
policies on long-term and palliative care, and (4) developing 
age-friendly services and settings. 
In this perspective, the SMARTA project aims at 
developing and testing a system integrating personal and 
environmental sensors for the realization of healthcare 
services for monitoring vital signs, sudden adverse events 
like falls, promoting exercise and active lifestyle, 
communicating with caregivers, offering safety services at 
home (e.g., intrusion detection). 
The SMARTA system can be classified into the category 
of Personal Health Systems (PHS): introduced in late 1990s, 
they are a recent concept as devices and integrated solutions 
offering distributed health services by exploiting the 
innovation in science and technology such as the biomedical, 
micro- and nano-technologies, and the innovation in the 
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). In this 
specific application, PHS empower elderly in their health 
management together with supporting their safe home living 
thanks to continuous monitoring of health related signals and 
parameters, integrated home automation controls and a web-
based assistance. In fact, PHS are empowering systems 
because they have been designed to place the individual 
citizen/patient in the center of the healthcare delivery process. 
They allow citizens/patients to have more awareness and 
responsibility in managing their own health, and they support 
the interaction with care providers whenever is necessary. 
Among PHS, Wearable Biomedical Systems (WBS) are a 
specific category and they can be defined as integrated 
systems on a wearable platform (in the sense of clothing or 
devices attachable to the human body) and can offer solutions 
for continuous monitoring by measuring non-invasive 
biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Continuous 
monitoring with early detection of anomalies has likely the 
potential to provide patients with an increased level of 
confidence, which in turn may improve the quality of life. If 
WBS are an ideal platform for multi-parametric non-intrusive 
monitoring of health status, their user acceptance and 
reliability have been investigated in research but rarely in a 
real scenario. In the frame of the SMARTA project, a 
deployment of the system into real life has been tested: this 
activity was approved by Fondazione Don Gnocchi ethical

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The SMARTA system is the result of the integration of 
different components developed by the partners of the 
project. These parts correspond to specific functions of the 
overall system and are placed on different levels: 
• 
monitoring of vital signs and lifestyle (e.g., no. of 
steps inside the house/environment); 
• 
supporting the adoption of active lifestyles (e.g., 
performance monitoring of motor and physiological 
fitness exercises/prevention) and/or rehabilitation 
(exercises driven through video and the system is able 
to record the performance and movements); 
• 
safety system environment (detection of falls, 
intrusion detection through detection of footsteps on 
the floor); 
• 
communication with caregivers for continuous 
assessment and follow up. 
These systems send data to a body/home gateway that 
redirects them to a center which concentrates the data and 
implements the above services (figure 1). The biomedical 
monitoring 
system 
is 
composed 
by 
wearable 
and 
non-wearable 
sensors. 
The 
considered 
sensors 
are: 
pulse-oximeter, 
glucometer, 
sphygmomanometer, 
thermometer, weighting scale, garment provided with sensors 
for ECG, fall detectors. The system was settled-up at the 
Smart Home of the “IRCCS S.Maria Nascente” Center, 
Fondazione Don Gnocchi. 
The objectives of the test of the SMARTA system were 
the following ones. The main goal was the evaluation of the 
technical reliability of the prototype system in terms of: 
• 
correct recognition and processing of the signals 
collected through the various system components; 
• 
proper display/data management in the medical 
record; 
• 
suitable provision or communication to the subject of 
information related to measures/alarms through the 
dedicated interface. 
This first testing phase was carried out on 10 healthy 
subjects. 
Whenever the technical reliability was good, the second 
set of evaluations was related to the procedure compliance, 
system usability and acceptance by the different endusers; in 
particular, the following elements were considered: 
• 
simulation of the real applicability of the SMARTA 
system, through usability tests carried out in a 
controlled home environment; 
• 
assessment of the perception of the SMARTA system 
in terms of patient’s utility, usability, acceptability 
and attractiveness; 
• 
evaluation of the perception of the SMARTA system 
in terms of caregiver’s usefulness, usability, 
acceptability and attractiveness. 
Thirteen elderly subjects (mean age 66.5 years) affected 
by cardiologic pathologies were recruited in this second 
testing phase.

For each trial, a dedicated testing protocol and the related 
methodology for measuring the proper outcomes and related 
indexes were defined. This paper is focused on the outcome 
for (1) the overall system, (2) the wearable monitoring system, 
and (3) the ground monitoring system.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Overall SMARTA system reliability 
The first phase of testing revealed that the SMARTA 
system has some improvement fields in term of technological 
stability. In fact, some failed measurements are still present in 
the system (Table I).

In particular, the user interface (GUI) is the most stable 
component (100% of positive results) while during the 
measurement of the physiological parameters a 30-35% of 
failed test are shown. These problems were due to some 
intercommunication bugs distributed in the different 
hierarchical levels of the system. This test highlighted the 
need for a further step of tuning to increase the stability and 
the reliability of the system, even if the performance is 
generally encouraging. 
The system underwent the judgement of thirteen patients 
in terms of utility (Figure 2), usability (Figure 3), and 
acceptance (Figure 4). A set of subjective assessment was 
administered through a dedicated questionnaire to the 
recruited subjects (Table II). The Likert scale with 7 values 
(from -3 = fully disagree, to 0 = neutral, up to +3 = fully agree) 
was chosen for ranking the subjective evaluations.

The results show that the prototype of the SMARTA 
system has been highly appreciated by its potential users (both 
patients and clinicians) due to its potential in terms of 
improving home care and simultaneous decrease of the 
workload of caregivers. 
Patients consider the interface clear and effective, but 
further developments should include the implementation of 
the feedback alarm relating to home automation. Also the 
management of measurements can be optimized in terms of 
questions and confirmations to the end-users. 
Instead, the dedicated interface to clinical services 
(medical records), should be partially revised to match more 
effectively the needs of the operators. Further developments 
should include a general revision of the GUI and, in particular, 
an improved version of the management of the patient profile 
(profile creation and management of custom settings) and of 
the visualization of the results of the ECG (the track is neither 
readable nor understandable by patient and their relatives as 
end-users). 
B. Wearable ECG system reliabiliy and usability 
The wearable system was a system for non-intrusive 
monitoring of one ECG lead and trunk actigraphy. The ECG 
signal is acquired at a sample frequency fs = 256 Hz with 24 
bit resolution. The raw signal and the processed data are stored 
in an internal flash memory then downloaded through 
Bluetooth connection. The same device has also a three axes 
accelerometer used for wearable fall detection. Wearable 
solutions include two sensing components to be used with the 
same hardware device for ECG recording and transmission: 
an adhesive patch embedding the standard silver/silver 
chloride electrodes, and a garment provided with sensors (a 
t-shirt for the male patients and a belt for the female subjects 
as shown in Figure 5). These second elements embed 
conductive yarns to implement textile electrodes. Being not 
adhesive but simply adopting the t-shirt/belt elasticity to keep 
the sensors adhering to the skin and to minimize the skin 
motion artefacts. Specific attention has been paid to their 
design and the choice of materials. 
    
 
 
 
Figure 5.  Wearable components of the SMARTA system (the patch, the t-
shirt, the belt) and an example of acquired signal. 
Preliminary design validation was related to recorded 
ECG tracks quality compared to the actual one. This analysis 
demonstrated the clinical suitability of the proposed system. 
Both solutions provided clinical quality ECG tracks. The 
validation tests showed also that the sensing patch was 
preferred for its simplicity in putting it on, while the belt and 
the t-shirt required more demanding operations. Despite this 
aspect, prolonged t-shirt or belt wearing was comfortable and 
did not provoked any skin irritation effect, while adhesive 
patches usually do. No such tests on the SMARTA patches 
were carried out during this validation phase. 
C. Ground fall detection system reliabiliy and usability 
The ground fall detection was set-up with tri-axial MEMS 
accelerometers [3] located on the ground. The signals were 
acquired by a Raspberry PI based system and it was analyzed 
in real time by extracting the RMS and the maximum values 
of the waveform. An example of the vibration time history is 
shown in Figure 6. 
The vibration measured by the accelerometers was used to 
estimate if the event can be related to a fall or if it is due to the

daily-life activities. The dependence between the measured 
acceleration and the force generated by the impact was 
quantified with the ground apparent mass, that was identified 
with preliminary experiments not described in this work.  
The procedure for the fall identification is based on the 
data fusion at feature level as in [4]. To date, there were no 
falls and consequently it was not possible to validate the fall 
detection system. However, results showed that the system are 
useful to identify the human activities (between 11 and 18.30 
in Figure 6) from the period where there was no activity in the 
room (after 18.30). The vibration spectra evidenced that there 
were no dominant frequency components up to 50 Hz, 
coherently with what was evidenced in other kinds of building 
at the ground floor. 
 
Figure 6.  Vibration measured on the floor during the system usability 
tests. 
Experiments 
performed 
in 
laboratory 
conditions 
evidenced that the simultaneous use of at least three 
accelerometers located on the ground allows identifying the 
position of the event that generated the vibration. The 
detection is based on a particular triangulation method that 
uses the wavelet transform to localize the source position; in 
our case, the triangulation was not effective given the limited 
bandwidth of the system. The validation of the source 
localization procedure is deserved to forthcoming studies.  
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The SMARTA system demonstrated not only a good 
technical reliability but also a more than positive usability and 
acceptance judgement by the end-users. This is a key point for 
its deployment into real applications. In parallel, the residual 
problems of communication between the various hierarchical 
levels of the system, which in particular cases may introduce 
errors into the proper recording and data storage, were solved 
and now the robustness of the system ensures its applicability 
to the patient's home. About the sensors, further developments 
should be designed with respect to the design and ergonomics 
of the sensor-shirt and belt to facilitate their use in full 
autonomy. In doing so, the exploitation of the SMARTA 
system will aim to bring benefits to citizens and health 
authorities alike: first, by improving the quality of care for the 
individuals themselves; second, by containing the rising 
healthcare costs through the proper and efficient use of 
technological capabilities.
