Abstract— As usage of the Blogosphere increases, more 
and more Internet users have begun to share their 
experiences and opinions about products or services on 
the World Wide Web. Web logs (also known as blogs) 
have thus become an important source of information. 
In turn, great interest in blog mining has arisen, 
specifically due to its potential applications, such as 
collecting opinions regarding products, or reviewing 
search engine applications for their ability to collect and 
analyze data. In this study, we introduce an architecture, 
implementation, and evaluation of a  Web log mining 
application, called the BlogMiner, which extracts and 
classifies opinions and emotions (or sentiment) from the 
contents of weblogs. 
Keywords - blog mining, opinion mining, blog crawler, 
web blog mining 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The world’s biggest library, the World Wide Web, is 
increasingly populated with data contributed by every 
Internet user around the world. People share their ideas, 
interests, emotions, experiences, and knowledge with others, 
in the form of opinions and reviews, via the Internet every 
day. Thus, mining opinions on the Web is a rich and 
important area for research [2].  
Sociologists have used many different ways to recognize 
natural interests, aims, and preferences. In order to collect 
ideas from people’s sharing over the Web, the most efficient 
way is to mine their Internet diaries, their blogs, which are 
their own direct, personal accounts of their ideas and 
opinions. This study introduces a system that is designed to 
mine ideas to understand the views of a web community. 
In the last few years, blogs have emerged as widely 
known personal Web pages. Blogs began as online diaries. 
They are designed for regular updating. Each blog consists of 
a sequence of blog entries. A blog entry consists of a title, a 
textual content, and the time it was posted. Some blog entries 
may have comments by the blog readers. Some blogs are 
dedicated to a particular area of interest such as 
entertainment or business.  Easy-to-use blogging tools have 
led to an explosion in the number of blogs. Especially with 
increasing usage of internet, blogging and number of blog 
pages are growing rapidly. Blog pages have become the most 
popular means to express one’s opinions. By the end of 
2008, there were 133 million blogs on the global Internet, as 
indexed by Technorati [3].  
Mining opinions from Web pages involves several 
challenges. For example, these opinions, or review data, have 
to be crawled from Web sites and then separated from non-
review data [9].  
As an experiment, system extracts movie review data 
from blogs. As a result, we introduce an architecture and we 
describe the implementation of the system in detail. We also 
explain a classification of review data.  
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 
discusses the literature. Sections 3-4 outline the proposed 
approach and the system architecture. Section 5 addresses 
the evaluation study. Section 6 concludes the paper with a 
summary and analysis of results. 
II. 
LITERATURE SURVEY 
In recent years, there has been a huge burst of research 
activity in the areas of sentiment analysis and opinion 
mining. Earlier studies focused mostly on interpretation of 
narrative points of view in text [6-11]. The widespread 
awareness of the research problems in sentiment analysis and 
opinion mining has increased with the rise of machine 
learning methods in natural language processing and 
information retrieval; of the availability of datasets for 
machine learning algorithms to be trained on (due to the 
blossoming of the World Wide Web); and, specifically, of 
the development of review-aggregation Web sites.  
Zhongchao Fei et al. [4] describe a sentiment 
classification application that uses phrase patterns to classify 
opinions. In this study, at the document classification phase, 
the authors add tags to certain words in the text, and then 
match the tags within a sentence with predefined phrase 
patterns to find the sentiment orientation of the sentence 
under consideration. Next, they take into account the 
sentiment orientation of each sentence and classify the text 
according to the most repeated sentiment.   
Jeonghee Yi et al. [5] describe a sentiment miner that 
extracts sentiment (or opinions) that people express about a 
subject, such as a company, brand, or product name. In this 
study, the authors design the sentiment miner with the 
following challenge in mind: Not only does it try to capture 
the overall opinion about a topic, but it is also the sentiment 
regarding individual aspects of the topic, thus capturing 
essential information of interest. The reason for this is that 
document-level sentiment classification fails to detect 
sentiment about individual aspects of the topic. Thus in the 
author’s study, the sentiment miner analyzes grammatical 
sentence structures and phrases based on natural language 
processing (NLP) techniques, and detects, for each 
occurrence of a known topic spot, the sentiment about a

specific topic. With these characteristics, the proposed NLP-
based sentiment system [5] achieved high quality results 
(∼90% of accuracy) on various datasets, including online 
review articles and the general Web pages and news articles. 
The feature extraction algorithm, proposed by Jeonghee Yi et 
al. [5], successfully identified topic related feature terms 
from online review articles, enabling sentiment analysis at 
finer granularity.  
Jian Liu et al. [6] describe an application that completes 
sentiment classification with review extraction. This 
approach extracts the review expressions on specific subjects 
and attaches a sentiment tag and weight to each expression. 
Then, it calculates the sentiment indicator of each tag by 
accumulating 
the 
weights 
of 
all 
the 
expressions 
corresponding to a tag. Next, it uses a classifier to predict the 
sentiment label of the text. In this study, the authors used on-
line documents to test the performance of the proposed 
application. The experimental documents cover two 
domains: politics and religion. The experiments within those 
domains achieve accuracy between 85% and 95%.  
Yun-Qing Xia et al. [7] describe a method of opinion 
mining to help e-learning systems note the users’ opinions of 
the course-wares and e-learning teachers, and thus help 
improve the services. In this study, the authors develop an 
opinion mining system for e-learning reviews. The goal of 
this system is to extract and summarize the opinions and 
reviews, and determine whether these reviews and opinions 
are positive or negative. This study divides the whole task 
into four subtasks: expression identification, opinion 
determination, 
content-value 
pair 
identification, 
and 
sentiment analysis. The authors achieved the following 
precisions for these subtasks, respectively: 94%, 84.2%, 
80.9% and 92.6%.  
Qingliang Miao et al. [8] describe a sentiment mining 
and retrieval system called Amazing. The authors introduce a 
ranking mechanism, which is different from a general web 
search engine, since it utilizes the quality of each review 
rather than the link structures for generating review 
authorities. In this system, the most important aspect is that 
the authors incorporate the temporal dimension information 
into the ranking mechanism, and make use of temporal 
opinion quality and relevance in ranking review sentences. 
This study monitors the changing trends of customer reviews 
in time and visualizes the changing trends of positive and 
negative opinion respectively. It then generates a visual 
comparison between positive and negative evaluations of a 
particular feature in which potential customers are interested. 
The authors conducted experiments on the sentiment mining 
and retrieval system using the customer reviews of four 
kinds of electronic products, including digital cameras, cell 
phones, laptops, and MP3 players. The evaluation results 
indicate that the proposed approach achieves a precision of 
approximately 85%.  
Li Zhuang et al. [10] describe a multi-knowledge-based 
approach that utilizes WordNet for statistical analysis and 
movie knowledge. WordNet is a large lexical database of 
English, developed under the direction of George A. Miller 
[11]. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are grouped into 
sets of cognitive synonyms, each expressing a distinct 
concept. The proposed approach, described in [10], breaks 
down the problem of review mining and summarization into 
the following subtasks: identifying feature words and 
opinion words in a sentence; determining the class of feature 
word and the polarity of the opinion word; identifying the 
relevant opinion word(s) and then obtaining some valid 
feature-opinion pairs; and producing a summary using the 
discovered information. The authors use WordNet to 
generate a keyword list for finding features and opinions. 
Grammatical rules between feature words and opinion words 
are then applied to identify the valid feature-opinion pairs. 
Finally, the authors re-organize the sentences according to 
the extracted feature-opinion pairs to generate the summary. 
The objective of this study is to automatically generate a 
feature class-based summary for arbitrary online movie 
reviews. Experimental results show that this method has an 
average precision of approximately 65%. In addition, with 
this approach, it is easy to generate a summary with movie-
related names as the sub-headlines.  
In this study, we extend our previous work described in 
[1] and propose a project that is most similar to that 
described by Zhuang et al [10]. Our approach differs from 
this approach in the way we calculate sentiment orientation 
of the movie reviews from the blogs. The previous work 
focused on a constant dataset, while the proposed approach 
crawls the dataset from the blogs. In turn, this is used to 
calculate movie scores. We discuss our approach in detail in 
the next section. 
III. 
APPROACH 
A. Overview 
In this section, we briefly describe problem definition, 
the techniques used in this study and what we aim to achieve 
as a result. This study is categorized into three phases. The 
first phase is the crawling phase, in which data is gathered 
from  Web logs. The second phase is the analyzing phase, in 
which the data is parsed, processed and analyzed to extract 
useful information. The third phase is the visualization 
phase, in which the information is visualized to better 
understand the results. More details of the system 
architecture are explained in the system architecture section 
(IV). 
B. Problem Definition  
Web logs are full of un-indexed and unprocessed text that 
reflects opinions. Many people make choices by taking the 
suggestions of others into account. For example, one likes to 
buy a product that is most recommended by people who use 
that product. Thus, there is a need to crawl and process 
opinions, so that it can be used in decision-making processes 
of potential Web review applications.  
C. Solution  
In this study, we propose a blog mining system that will 
extract movie comments from Web logs and that will show 
Web log users what other people think about a particular

Sample Review: “I thought it wouldn't be as good as it 
was, because thousands of people and reviews said it would 
suck! It was great, but what it missed was that it needed to be 
at-least an hour longer, because it missed a-little bit, but it 
still rocked! I loved it! I thought it was funny, and as did the 
person next to me, when John says: "I'll be back!””. 
 
First we split the text into sentences: In this step, the 
BlogMiner simply breaks down the text into sentences and 
makes the sentiment analysis at sentence level. Below, we 
illustrate this process as applied to the sample review after 
step 1.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Second, we tag the words in each sentence by their type. 
In this step, appropriate tags are added to the words to be 
able to understand their meanings more accurately. Figure 8 
shows the tags that have been used and the meanings of these 
tags. The text below is the sample review after step 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third, we score the text using the keyword algorithm and 
calculate the scores. In this step, the system calculates the 
sentiment score for keywords and finds the accumulated 
scores for each sentence. Below, we illustrate the output of 
the sample review after step 3. The results of the experiments 
are illustrated in Figure 9 .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As can be seen in this figure, the producer and 
screenwriter columns include rows with a score of 5.25. 
These scores are default values because no keywords were 
found for these movies.  
The results of the experiment have been compared with 
each movie’s IMDB score. On the IMDB page of each 
movie, the movie’s general scores are listed. Thus, we can 
compare the IMDB score against the keyword algorithm’s 
score.  
For the producer and screenwriter categories, not enough 
comments were found to calculate a realistic score. As a 
result, most of the producer and screenwriter score columns 
are given the default value. When the results are compared 
against the IMDB scores, we observe a similar behavior. A 
movie with a low IMDB score also gets a low score in the 
proposed application. Similarly, a movie with high IMDB 
score gets a high score in the proposed application. We also 
observe two exceptions to this behavior. For example, the 
movies “Fast and Furious” and “State of Play” received high 
scores in our application; however, their IMDB scores are in 
a lower position than the proposed application calculated. 
We conclude that in the IMDB database, the comments and 
the score of the movie may not always be matched correctly.  
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS 
 
Opinion mining is an important area of investigation. As 
Web 2.0 applications produce an enormous collection of 
meaningful information, mining such information has 
become an important task. In this study, we introduced an 
opinion mining application that is created for calculating 
movie scores from blog pages.
