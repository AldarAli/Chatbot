Abstract—A new method of comparison of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) sequences, 3D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences,
is presented. This method allows for both graphical and numerical
similarity/dissimilarity analysis of the sequences. This method is
a generalization of our previous method called by us 2D-dynamic
representation of DNA sequences. The methodology is taken from
physics: the DNA sequence is represented by a set of ”material
points” in a 3D space. Using this nonstandard approach we have
obtained high accuracy: a difference in a single base can be
recognized. We can indicate which base it is (cytosine, guanine,
adenine, or thymine) and its approximate location in the DNA
sequence.

INTRODUCTION
The aim of the presented studies is the creation of new
bioinformatical models carrying information about similarity
of the DNA sequences. This information is relevant for solving
many biomedical problems. The inspiration for these studies
has interdisciplinary character.
A sequence is deﬁned as a sequence of symbols. In the
case of the DNA, this is a sequence composed of four letters
corresponding to four nucleotides: A - adenine, C - cytosine,
G - guanine, T - thymine.
The main idea in our work is an application of methodolog-
ical concepts derived from the classical mechanics to bioin-
formatics. The application of concepts of classical mechanics
to the classiﬁcation of biochemical objects, in particular to the
formulation of new criteria determining the degree of similarity
of DNA sequences led to the creation of new methods.

THEORY AND RESULTS
In this section, we brieﬂy review a new method in bioin-
formatics which is referred to as 3D-dynamic representation
of DNA sequences [1][2]. The name of this method is related
to the descriptors which are analogous as the ones used in the
dynamics. The method used to create a 3D-dynamic graph was
described in [1]. Two examples of such graphs are shown in
Fig. 1.
This method belongs to the group of methods in bioin-
formatics called graphical representation methods (See for
reviews [3][4]).
The correctness of these kind of methods is usually shown
using standard sets of data: β-globin and histone H4 coding
sequences of different species.
As the descriptors (numerical characteristics) of 3D-
dynamic graphs, we have proposed [1] the followings:
•
Coordinates of the centers of mass of the graphs
(µx, µy, µz),
•
Normalized principal moments of inertia of the graphs
(r1, r2, r3),
•
The values of the cosines of properly deﬁned angles.
The coordinates of the center of mass of the 3D-dynamic
graph, in the {X, Y, Z} coordinate system are deﬁned as [1]
µx =
P
i mixi
P
i mi
,
µy =
P
i miyi
P
i mi
,
µz =
P
i mizi
P
i mi
,
(1)
where xi, yi, zi are the coordinates of the mass mi. Since
mi = 1 for all the points, the total mass of the sequence is
N = P
i mi, where N is the length of the sequence. Then,
the coordinates of the center of mass of the 3D-dynamic graph
may be expressed as
µx = 1
N
X
i
xi,
µy = 1
N
X
i
yi,
µz = 1
N
X
i
zi.

The tensor of the moment of inertia is given by the matrix
ˆI =
 Ixx

as

The eigenvalues I1, I2, I3 are called the principal moments
of inertia. As the descriptors we select the square roots of the
normalized principal moments of inertia:
r1 =
r
I1
N ,
r2 =
r
I2
N ,
r3 =
r
I3
N .

Using this approach one can calculate similarity values
between the DNA sequences. For this purpose, we have
introduced the similarity measure [2]
Sij = 1 − exp(−|Di − Dj|),
(8)
where i and j denote two sequences. The measure is normal-
ized: 0 ≤ S ≤ 1. For the descriptors, which are identical in
both sequences (Di = Dj) the similarity value S = 0.
An example of the calculations using this approach is
shown in Table 1. This is the similarity/dissimilarity matrix
for the second exon of β-globin gene of different species [2].
Small values of S correspond to large degree of similarity
related to the considered descriptor D. As we can see the
largest similarity human-other species is for chimpanzee. Such
result is obtained for many descriptors for these data.

CONCLUSIONS
•
3D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences facil-
itates both graphical and numerical comparison of
DNA sequences.
•
The method is sensitive:
It can recognize a difference in only one base.
•
The new normalized similarity measure is a good tool
for similarity analysis of DNA sequences.
