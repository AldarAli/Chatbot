Abstract — 
In the past decade, numerous daylighting 
practitioners, architects, engineers, and researchers have 
progressively used daylighting simulation tools to estimate the 
daylight areas of building design.  Most of these tools employ 
overcast sky conditions for daylight simulations. However, the 
accuracy and pertinence of such simulation tools for the 
tropical sky are uncertain. This study aimed to validate the 
computer-simulated result of overcast and actual sky models 
with physical test bed results measured under a real tropical 
sky. The considered space is modelled as per the constructed 
test bed space (Mahindra-TERI Centre of Excellence 
(MTCoE), Gurgaon, India) model to be tested under a real sky 
measurement.  The same model was configured in VELUX 
Daylight visualizer 3.0 to perform daylighting simulation for 
March 21st, 2022, from 8:00hrs to 18:00hrs.  All the 
illuminance measurements in the test bed were carried out 
under prevailing sky conditions in Gurgram, India. In 
contrast, related CIE sky conditions and overcast sky 
conditions were used for simulations to compare the results 
using the agreement of the index method. The International 
Commission on Illumination (CIE) sky conditions are very 
dissimilar from the actual tropical sky; simulated absolute 
value results such as external illuminance, absolute work plane 
illuminance and surface luminance recorded moderate mean 
differences from the measured results. Results indicate that the 
accuracy of illuminance levels increased by almost 24% 
through daylight simulations under actual sky conditions on 
March 21st (equinox day). Aimed at imminent research, other 
parameters can be validated, such as orientations, angle of the 
overhang, glazing, window sizes, colours, environment settings, 
and electric lighting.

 INTRODUCTION  
Daylight is an essential and effective aspect of the 
sustainable development approach for reducing energy 
consumption [1], the impact of climate change [2], and for 
improving well-being and productivity [3], visual comfort 
[4], and the built environment development [5]. For colour 
rendering, daylight is the best available light source, and its 
high quality makes it the only light source suitable for 
human visuals. The internal spaces are brightened by natural 
daylight, which mainly enters the space via window 
openings and establishes a visual link between the area of 
interest and exterior environments. An important stage in 
daylighting designs is calculating the daylight illuminance 
for a specific location in a building [6]-[9]. 
For daylighting, several guidelines and conceptual 
design strategies are available; the most common way to 
predict daylight illuminance is to use the Daylight Factor 
(DF). The method is simple, and analysis can be carried out 
analytically or derived via particular design aids. The DF 
calculation is based on overcast sky conditions and does not 
account for direct sunlight [10]. DF is frequently described 
in daylight design guidelines and is an extensively used 
technique for practitioners in many countries [11]. The DF 
method has effectively established the connection between 
the daylight controls and efficiency; as per the split-flux 
theory, the Average Daylight Factor (AFD) required for any 
area of interest is directly proportional to the window area 
and involves a smaller amount of data than DF [12][13]. 
The sky luminance varies as the distance from the sun 
changes (both in azimuth and altitude), according to 
recorded sky luminance data from other tropical nations and 
accepted sky luminance prediction models [14][15]. Aside 
from that, the Indian design sky does not consider the 
changes in sky circumstances when climatic zones shift. As 
detailed above, azimuthal uniformity, climatic invariance, 
and insufficiency for calculating annual energy savings 
owing to daylight are among the limitations of the present 
Indian design sky model. Because of these flaws, the 
designers had no choice but to use different sky luminance 
forecast models for window design and annual building 
energy load estimates. The sky models of Perez [16] and the 
International Commission on Illumination (CIE) [17] are 
commonly used for predicting sky brightness distribution.

The daylight availability is primarily determined by the 
sky's luminance levels and patterns [18]. In 2003, the CIE 
approved a set of 15 sky types illustrated in Table I, which 
presents an overall practical framework for representing the 
skies in various environments, including different climates 
such as tropical humid and temperate maritime [19][20]. 
The respective standard sky characterizes a distinct pattern 
of sky illuminance. However, the mathematical equations 
can be rather complicated, particularly for the non-overcast 
sky, which depends on the various sun positions [21]. The 
shading properties of nearby buildings can dramatically 
reduce the amount of sunshine entering the interior of the 
buildings, specifically in densely populated zones [22][23]. 
With the advancement in computer technology, computer 
simulation tools can be utilized to evaluate the building's 
daylight requirement. On the other hand, full-scale computer 
simulation programs can be highly complex, costly, and 
time-consuming, particularly during the early stages of 
design when numerous architectural possibilities and design 
schemes are studied and evaluated [24]. Simple simulation 
tools provide insight into the interdependency of numerous 
daylight variables for building professionals. In earlier 
investigations, many researchers have used simulation 
techniques to accurately validate the light environment in 
the tropics under an overcast sky with no external 
obstruction [25], however the studies were not performed 
under real sky conditions. Once the design schemes have 
been 
finalized, 
the 
practitioner 
performs 
computer 
simulations, and the calculation results will be used to verify 
the simulated findings.  
The provisions, standards, and criteria for adequate 
natural light in buildings are specified in several regulations, 
codes of practice and design handbooks. A measuring 
station at the TERI Gram, Gurugram, Haryana, India, took 
solar irradiance and sky luminance measurements. All 
instruments were placed on the roof in a reasonably free of 
external impediments and easily accessible for examination, 
cleaning, and maintenance. Every day, data collection for 
sky luminance begins at 600hrs and ends at 1800hrs; on the 
other hand, data for solar irradiance is recorded every 
minute. 
All 
of 
the 
data 
was 
collected 
roughly 
simultaneously in true solar time, which aided in the 
computation of solar geometry and subsequent data 
comparison at other places.

Figure 1.  Measurement points for the sky scanner 
The EKO MS321LR sky scanner is used to scan the 
luminance distributions in the sky that presents the sky grid 
pattern for the sky dome; it records the luminance at 145 sky 
patches, as shown in Figure 1. The scanner's full view angle 
is 11 degrees, which allows each sky patch to be regarded as 
a point source with minimal inaccuracy. This study looks at 
luminance data measurements and validation of the recorded 
data by utilizing the VELUX software. 
II. 
METHODOLOGY 
The study is divided into four sub-activities where the 
first activity (see Figure 2) focuses on the CIE analysis of 
the raw luminance data obtained from the installed sky 
scanner instrument at the MTCoE lab, Gurugram, India. For 
the second activity (see Figure 4) of the study, a room was 
selected in the vicinity of the sky scanner instrument to 
measure the actual daylight illuminance levels of the space. 
The considered space is further modelled as per the 
constructed test bed space as a part of the third activity of 
the study (see Figure 7). The model was configured in 
VELUX Daylight Visualizer 3.0 to perform daylighting 
simulation for equinox day that is 21st March from 800hrs to 
1800hrs.  All the illuminance measurements in the test bed 
were carried out under prevailing sky conditions in 
Gurugram, India. In contrast, related CIE sky conditions and 
overcast sky conditions were used for simulations to 
compare the results using the agreement of the index 
method (see Figure 10). 
A. Activity-1 CIE Analysis of Luminance Distribution 
Data 
The performance of each CIE standard sky luminance model 
was evaluated for 21st March 2022 using the Root Mean-
Square Errors (RMSE) adapted from ISO 15469:2004 that 
defines a set of outdoor daylight conditions linking sunlight 
and skylight for theoretical and practical purposes [18] for 
the extracted luminance distribution data from the sky 
scanner instrument. The analyzed measured CIE sky-type for 
half-hourly data from 800hrs to 1800hrs as mentioned in 
Table II which is further used as an input for sky type 
consideration for CIE measured sky simulations as described 
in Activity-3.

measure the daylight illuminance levels for 21st March (800 
hrs -1800 hrs) using testo 540 - Light meter, the light sensor 
is modelled on the spectral sensitivity of the human eye and 
is ideal for measuring lighting conditions in the workplace at 
750mm work plane as shown in Figure 5.

C. Activity-3 Daylight Simulations 
A 3D Model of the selected room (MTCoE test bed) was 
developed to perform the daylight simulations under CIE 
overcast sky type and CIE measured sky type (see Table II). 
The simulation results in illuminance (lux) for the same data 
points as shown in Figure 6 grid as the measured case. Under 
the scope of the study, the simulations were performed for 
the 21st of March using VELUX Daylight Visualizer 3.0 
software that allows the user to perform daylight simulations 
considering any sky condition out of the CIE 15 general sky 
type (see Table I) only for the 21st day of each month.

D. Activity-4 Index of Agreement 
The daylight illuminance levels obtained from the second 
activity for actual measurements were compared with the 
simulated lux levels from the third activity. The index of 
Agreement method is used to assess the differences between 
the two cases as shown in Figure 10.  
 
 
Figure 10.  Analysis of the results 
The comparison of model-produced estimates with 
observed/reliable data is an important stage in any modelling 
investigation. The index of agreement is used to validate this 
study (also known as the Willmott index); Willmott (1981) 
recommended a standardized measure of model forecast 
error called the index of agreement (d), which ranges from 0 
to 1 [26]. The index of the agreement represents the ratio of 
the mean square error and the potential error. A value of one 
indicates a perfect match, while a value of zero indicates no 
agreement at all. The index of agreement can identify 
additive and proportional differences between observed and 
simulated means and variances; however, due to squared 
differences, d is susceptible to extreme values. 
 
 
 
where Oi is the observed value and Pi  is the predicted value 
and Obar is the average observed value.  
III. 
OBSERVATIONS 
Results from the index of agreement method (see Table 
III and Figure 11) reveal that under overcast sky type 
illuminance levels were 79% closer to the measured lux 
levels at 800hrs whereas illuminance levels were only 71% 
closer to the measured lux level under real sky type, 
however, at 830hrs the lux levels were calculated to be 80% 
and 60% closer to the measured illuminance results under 
overcast sky type and measured CIE sky type. At 900hrs, a 
decrease in the percentage was observed as the illuminance 
level was 73% closer to the measured data under measured 
CIE type as compared to overcast sky type data measurement 
which was 79% closer to the measured data. Further at 
930hrs the illuminance level was 85% and 91% closer to the 
measured lux level under overcast sky type and measured 
CIE sky type, it is at this time of the day where the 
percentage difference between overcast sky type and 
measured CIE type data was just one percent. At 1000hrs the 
illuminance level under overcast sky type and measured sky 
type were observed to be 88% and 91% closer to the 
measured data readings. At 1030hrs the illuminance levels

SIMUL 2022 : The Fourteenth International Conference on Advances in System Simulation

under overcast sky type and measure sky type were observed 
to be 82% and 91% closer to the measure data reading 
however at 1100hrs there was a dip in percentage observed 
where the illuminance level was 93% closer to measure data 
under overcast sky type and 60% closer to the measure data 
under CIE measured sky type which is the maximum 
percentage closer to the measure readings and at 1130hrs the 
percentage dropped to 89% and 91%. 
As observed during the noon, the illuminance level under 
overcast sky type and measured sky type were observed to 
be 68% and 84% closer to the measured illuminance levels 
and at 1230hrs the levels further dropped to 62% and 26%. 
At 1300hrs the illuminance level under overcast and CIE 
measure sky type were observed to be 75% and 95% closer 
to the measured data readings. Analysis indicates that at 
1330hrs the luminance levels under the overcast and CIE 
Measured sky type were observed to be 39% and 89% during 
this hour of the day the difference between CIE measured 
sky type and overcast sky type was 50%. At 1400hrs the 
illuminance level under overcast and CIE measured sky type 
was observed to be 43% and 89% closer to the measured 
illuminance data, however a decrease in the percentage was 
observed at 1430hrs as the luminance levels under overcast 
sky type and CIE measured sky type was 24% and 87% 
closer to the measured illuminance data. 
At 1500hrs the illuminance level under overcast and CIE 
measured sky type were analyzed to be the lowest, as they 
were just 3% and 73% close to the measured data, moreover 
by 1530hrs the percentage increase was observed to be 4% 
and 66%. The percentage increase continued for the next 
hour and the illuminance level was under overcast and CIE 
measured sky type were analyzed to be 6% and 73% at 
1600hrs and 6% and 83% at 1630hrs closer to the measured 
illuminance level. By 1700hrs the illuminance level under 
overcast and CIE measured sky type were analyzed to be 3% 
and 23% closer to the measured illuminance data, which was 
lower than the previous hour this percentage, however, 
increased to 5% and 85% by 1730hrs. 
The last reading of the day at 1800hrs demonstrated that 
the illuminance level was under overcast and CIE measured 
sky type were zero percent closer to the measured 
illuminance data.

For the 21st of March 2022 under overcast sky type the 
daily average of the illuminance level was 48% closer to the 
measured illuminance level and under CIE sky type data the 
illuminance level was 72% closer to the measured 
illuminance data with a standard deviation of 0.34 and 0.2 
was observed for overcast sky type and CIE sky type with 
respect to measured data.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The actual set of CIE design skies given in Table II can 
be selected for daylight simulation analysis for Gurgaon and 
Delhi NCR region to get 24% more accurate results than the 
current practice of analyzing under a worst-case scenario of 
overcast sky conditions. This would help architects and 
designers to select the glass with optimum visual light 
transmission and consider the optimum window-wall ratio of 
the project.
