Abstract—A rehabilitation program was developed and applied 
using the recent development of Kinect motion capture 
technology. We tested the use of Kinect in the rehabilitation of 
people with physical disabilities (the elderly in our case). The 
rehabilitation takes advantage of Kinect without requiring a 
controller and the intuitive use of Kinect through physical 
gestures. Evaluation of an improved program in a second test 
identified new ways of using Kinect in future tests and as an 
exercise aid for the test subjects. Survey results collected 
following the tests indicate that many subjects were interested 
in the program as a new application, and the program 
encouraged exercise by reminding the subjects of when they 
were young.

INTRODUCTION  
A. Background 
In recent years, it has become increasingly common to 
use motion capture technology for the movement of 
characters in three-dimensional (3D) movies and video 
games. This technology allows for the movements of 
humans in real life to be read by a computer. Since these 
data are a reproduction of the movements of actual humans, 
the recorded movements are extremely real. 
Motion capturing is performed by attaching sensors to 
joints of the human body. Receiving sensors, such as those 
in cameras, record signals from the attached sensors and 
send them to a computer to be converted into digital data. 
By assigning the movements of each sensor to the joints of a 
computer-created person, it is possible to make the 
computer-created person move in the same way as an actual 
human. 
However, using motion capture technology requires a 
wide space for filming and much technical machinery, such 
as cameras and computers, and it is thus not easy to use 
from a financial point of view. 
In 2010, the public started using Kinect™ [1]. Once the 
potential of Kinect, which uses motion capture technology, 
was identified, Kinect was modified for use on computers. 
The Kinect for Windows® software development kit 
(SDK) was officially released as a tool for personal 
computer (PC) development, on the prerequisite that it was 
not to be used for commercial purposes. As a result, Kinect 
is currently being used as a motion capture technology in 
various research fields, e.g., research on games and video, 
nursing and medical care. 
 
B. Kinect 
Kinect is an interactive system that allows the control of 
video games without the use of a controller. It is a 
peripheral for the Xbox 360 released by Microsoft that 
allows for intuitive control using gestures and voice 
recognition as shown in Figure 1. The word “Kinect” is a 
combination of the words “Kinetics” and “Connect”. 
 
Figure 1. Kinect Source: XBOX360 Kinect [1] 
 
Kinect was released by Microsoft in 2010. At that time, 
the Nintendo Wii, which was released in 2006, had opened 
up a new games market with its controller that used physical 
motions for controls. Users then found alternative uses for 
the interactive game systems. One of the biggest differences 
between Kinect and the Wii is that Kinect does not require 
the player to hold a controller, and it is possible to move 
characters in the game simply by making physical motions. 
Both consoles use motion capture technology. The Wii 
reflects the player’s movements in the game by performing 
detection along three axes: pointer movement (through 
acceleration), changes in movement and inclination via the 
motion sensor built into the controller and pointer detection 
using infrared light. Kinect uses a number of sensors and 
processors and does not need to attach markers to the body. 
Therefore, it can reflect movements in the game by 
estimating and constructing indirect parts on acquired 
skeletal images and using these to track movements in real 
time.  
 
C. Past research 
Much research has been performed in the medical field 
employing motion capture technology that uses Kinect.

1) 
Navigation support for the visually impaired 
The 
Human-Computer 
Interaction 
group 
of 
the 
University of Konstanz in Germany is conducting a 
navigation support project for the visually impaired [2]. The 
project aims to provide aid for the blind as they walk down 
hallways, ascend and descend stairs, and open doors, using 
Kinect as a sensor. 
This project involves scanning an environment with 
Augmented Reality using Kinect and then recognizing that 
environment. A system voice then tells the person wearing 
the device the distance to the next object (such as a door or 
staircase). By tying a device containing a vibration motor 
linked to the Kinect around the waist, it is possible to 
prevent the wearer from bumping into obstructions by 
physically (tactually) notifying them of danger, using 
vibration that becomes increasingly strong as the wearer 
approaches the obstruction in question. 
 
2) 
NAIST Ballpool 
Hiroyuki Funaya of the Doctor’s Course in Information 
Science and Technology at the Nara Institute of Science and 
Technology developed an application (app) called “NAIST 
Ballpool” [3], taking advantage of the fact that Kinect does 
not require a controller or the user to own a videogame 
console or computer. This app provides an exercise in which 
Kinect is used to move a robot displayed on a screen to 
touch a ball. The app was used in a retirement home [4] by 
residents aged 80–90 years. When asked what they thought 
of the experience, they said it was “fun”. Kinect is used to 
reflect physical movements on a screen, allowing the body 
to move freely in a virtual sense. However, the retirement 
home residents reported problems in implementing Kinect. 
First, “when using the Kinect for input-based controls, 3D 
input is not necessarily appropriate for two-dimensional 
display.” For example, when Kinect is used in lieu of a 
mouse, the arms must be continuously raised to perform 
input commands. This activity is tiresome compared with 
using a mouse controller, which allows easy input using 
only the fingers. Second, “when using the Kinect, there is 
nothing for the user to touch, so there’s no physical 
feedback.” This is because physical movements are 
reflected on a screen and there is no sense of being in 
control as there is no tactile feedback. 
 
D. Kinect for Windows SDK and the Sample Shape Game 
Microsoft initially stated in the Kinect instruction 
manual that Kinect should not be used to control a PC itself, 
but they acknowledged the use of Kinect on PCs for non-
business purposes, provided that the internal algorithms 
would not be altered and that Kinect would not be used for 
the manipulation of Xbox games. Microsoft officially 
released a beta version of “Kinect for Windows SDK” (a 
program development kit for running the Kinect on a PC) on 
June 16, 2011 [5][6]. 
Kinect for Windows SDK contains a “Skeletal Viewer” 
and “Sample Shape Game” as sample programs. These were 
constructed in a basic program that allowed Kinect to be 
used on PCs, and provided a simple experience 
demonstrating the abilities of Kinect. 
The Skeletal Viewer allows the display of depth images 
and color images, recognition of two people and indirect 
recognition of each person. Thus, source code from the 
Skeletal Viewer allowed users to study the basics of how to 
program and use Kinect for Windows SDK. 
In the Sample Shape Game, the player must touch 
falling objects with his/her body to score points. It also 
supports voice recognition, allowing the player to control 
the game with commands such as “Reset” and “Faster”. 
However, to make use of the voice recognition function, a 
voice recognition framework must be installed. 
 
E. Purpose and approach of this paper 
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness 
of Kinect application as the rehabilitation program. Subjects 
in a nursing home played the Sample Shape Game program 
included in the Kinect for Windows SDK. We then asked 
which areas of the game they would like to see improved 
using questionnaire. Based on their request we made 
improved version of application and then had them play the 
improved version. After they experienced improved version, 
we asked questionnaire again to evaluate the effectiveness.

II. 
DEVELOPED PROGRAM 
A. Development environment 
We installed Kinect for Windows SDK on a PC so that 
Kinect 
could 
be 
controlled 
using 
the 
PC. 
The 
development/implementation environment was as follows. 
 
PC System: FMV - F8370 
CPU: Intel® Core™ 2 Duo CPU T8100 (2.1 GHz) 
Memory: 2.00 Gb 
OS: Windows 7 Professional 
 
Furthermore, we used Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express 
as a development tool to implement improvements in the

Sample 
Shape 
Game 
program 
used 
in 
this 
test. 
Improvements were made according to survey results 
collected after test 1 (described below). 
B.  Falling objects 
The size, type and drop rates of falling objects were not 
originally programmed with our test subjects in mind, so we 
made the objects simpler and bigger and reduced the drop 
rate. The program was changed as follows. 
 
public void SetSize(double f) 
    {   baseShapeSize = f 
         shapeSize = sceneRect.Height* 
                                baseShapeSize / 1000.0;  } 
    public void SetDropRate(double f) 
    {   dropRate = f ;  } 
 
- Changed underlined value: 
  - 1000.0 → 500.0 
 - Increased size of falling objects 
  - dropRate = f → dropRate = f/2 
 
To simplify the objects, we changed the poly types to 
circular objects, such as circles and bubbles. Figure 2 shows 
the results of our changes. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Screen captures from the original program (left) and the changed 
program (right). 
C. Projecting the player on the game 
Originally, the top right of the main game window 
displayed a tiny player image entered via the Kinect camera. 
We decided to make the player image the same size as the 
full window by overlaying the player image on the main 
game window. When we superimposed the Kinect camera 
image of the player on the game window, we encountered a 
problem that only the camera image was being displayed, 
and the game screen was not visible. Therefore, to make it 
look as if the player was transported into the game, we made 
the image from the Kinect camera semi-transparent and 
superimposed the camera image onto the skeletal frame-
based image. The program was changed as follows. 
 
<Image Name="video" Opacity="0.5" 
Margin="12,50,12,12" HorizontalAlignment="center" 
Width="504" Height="550" 
VerticalAlignment="center" /> 
 
By changing the opacity value from 1.0 (non-
transparent) to 0.5 (semi-transparent), the player image was 
projected onto the game window. The semi-transparency 
meant that the screen images were slightly difficult to 
observe, but the result was adequate for our purposes. 
 
D. Final program 
The results of the changes and improvements of the 
program in Sections 2-B and 2-C are shown in Figure 3.  
 
 
Figure 3. Example of the display for the final program. 
 
We were, thus, able to improve the program in terms of 
the falling objects and the superposition of the player image 
from the Kinect camera onto the game screen. The 
improved program was used and evaluated in test 2 
(described below). 
 
III. 
EVALUATION 
A. Test 1: Sample Shape Game experience 
1)  Purpose of test 1 
Elderly people living in nursing homes who do not 
usually exercise and people who require day services were 
asked to participate in the test. Both the subjects and their 
exercise instructors played the Sample Shape Game. This 
formed the basis of the test. We asked the subjects and their 
exercise instructors for their opinions and thoughts on how 
the program should be improved for test 2. 
2)  Test subjects 
Seven people receiving day services and one exercise 
instructor were enrolled from the Suwa Central Hospital 
Union Nursing Home “Fureai no Sato”. 
3)  Materials 
The following materials were used. 
  
– Kinect 
   
– one laptop PC

– one projector 
 
– the Sample Shape Game. 
 
4)  Procedure 
On the day of the test, people who receive day services 
in the nursing home facility were asked to play the Sample 
Shape Game for about 30 minutes. We then asked them 
which aspects of the program they would like to see 
improved. 
 
5)  Comments and Opinions of the subjects 
The thoughts/opinions/requests we received from the 
people who experienced the game were as follows: 
– The game should display the actual person as recognized 
by the camera, not just a skeletal frame. 
– The falling objects should be more interesting (e.g., 
money or  strawberries). 
– The falling objects should be larger. 
– There should be recognition of wheelchairs (which are not 
detected properly). 
– There should be selectable levels of difficulty. 
– There should be familiar music (without music, there is 
little desire to play). 
 
B. Test 2: Playing the improved Sample Shape Game 
1)  Changes from test 1 
The following changes were made to the Sample Shape 
Game: 
–  Changes were made to the falling objects. 
–  Changes were made to the size of the falling objects (they 
were made twice as large). 
– Changes were made to the type of falling objects (they 
were changed from squares, triangles, and stars to just 
circles). 
– The falling rate was reduced and the intervals between 
falling objects were increased (by a factor of 2). 
– The players themselves were projected into the game by 
superimposing the player image captured by the Kinect 
camera (originally displayed in a small window at the top 
right of the screen). 
 
2)  Purpose of test 2 
We made changes to the Sample Shape Game according 
to the feedback we received from test 1, and we had the 
subjects play the improved version and take a survey 
afterwards. We used the results to study the usefulness of a 
program using Kinect in rehabilitation. 
 
3)  Test subjects 
Seven people receiving day services (different subjects 
from test 1) and one exercise instructor were enrolled from 
the Suwa Central Hospital Union Nursing Home “Fureai no 
Sato”.

projectors as shown in Figure 4. The projector was used to 
display the combination of the game screen and the image 
obtained from the Kinect camera on the main screen. 
 
 
5)  Procedure 
We returned to the facility where we performed test 1 so 
the subjects could experience the improved Sample Shape 
Game. In test 2, we played music during the test, in 
response to the subjects’ opinions in test 1. Since we used 
different subjects for test 2 and the testing time was 
restricted, we did not compare the program before and after 
improvements.  
 
 
Figure 5. Test subjects experiencing the improved program. 
 
Subjects used the improved program, as shown in Figure 
5, and then filled out a survey, in which they were asked to 
provide a five-level evaluation (from “I agree” to “I 
disagree”) in response to five statements: “The game was 
easy to use”, “The game helps me exercise”, “I want to play 
again”, “There should be music” and “The size of the 
objects was appropriate”. 
 
 
IV. 
TEST RESULTS  
A. Results and observations for test 1 
As stated above, the thoughts/opinions/requests we 
received from subjects who played the game in test 1 were 
as follows: 
– The game should display the actual person as recognized 
by the camera, not just a skeletal frame. 
– The falling objects should be more interesting objects (e.g., 
money and strawberries). 
– The falling objects should be larger. 
– Wheelchairs should be detected properly. 
– The player should be able to select the level of difficulty. 
– Familiar music should be played. 
Subjects wanted to see themselves projected in the game 
instead of a skeletal frame, suggesting the skeletal frame, 
which appeared inorganic, did not make them feel as if they 
were directly participating in the game. 
Some subjects wanted more interesting objects to fall, 
but since the original program only contained very simple 
shapes such as circles and triangles, it was difficult to 
change the shapes into specific objects; we thus decided to 
use only one shape. The size of the objects was changed by 
adjusting some values in the program, but since this would 
increase the density of objects on the screen, we changed the 
speed and number of falling objects accordingly. 
During the survey to determine which points required 
improvement for test 2, we encountered a problem not 
directly related to the program. Some subjects were 
wheelchair users, and they experienced problems in terms of 
being recognized by the game. Probable causes for this are 
that the game was not played within an area most suitable 
for using Kinect and that the armrests of the wheelchairs 
were mistakenly recognized as human arms. 
We did not think of using music when we designed the 
test, but subjects suggested that music was necessary to 
make them want to exercise. Therefore, we decided to use 
traditional Japanese Bon festival music, such as “Tankō 
Bushi”, to provide music familiar to people of the subjects’ 
age. 
B. Results and observations for test 2 
Test 2 involved a survey with a five-level evaluation 
(from “I agree” to “I disagree”) in response to five 
statements: “The game was easy to use”, “The game helps 
me exercise”, “I want to play again”, “There should be 
music” and “The size of the objects was appropriate”. The 
results are given in Table 2.

The results are summarized as follows. 
1)  The game was easy to use; mean score: 4.4 
The controls were simple, as the subjects only had to 
move their arms and legs to score points, and the subjects 
were thus able to get used to the game relatively quickly. 
Sometimes the skeletal frame was not properly detected, 
resulting in the subjects not being able to control and play 
the game. 
2)  The game helps me exercise; mean score: 4.0 
This statement referred to the question of whether the 
subjects felt the game helped them exercise. The results 
varied slightly, but several subjects felt that the game would 
be a good incentive for exercise. 
3)  I want to play again; mean score: 4.4 
Several subjects mentioned that the game reminded them 
of being younger and that they would like to play again. 
4)  There should be music; mean score: 5.0 
41

CENTRIC 2013 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Human-oriented and Personalized Mechanisms, Technologies, and Services

We did not use music during test 1, but in response to 
the opinions received during test 1, we played songs the 
subjects were familiar with, such as Tankō Bushi and Sōran 
Bushi, during test 2, resulting in the subjects being more 
motivated in their participation. 
5)  The size of the objects was appropriate; mean score: 
5.0 
We doubled the size of the falling objects in the original 
program to make them easier to recognize. There did not 
seem to be any particular problem in recognizing the objects 
and there were no negative opinions. 
 
Comprehensive evaluation of the five statements 
demonstrated that the game was easy to control and that it 
enabled the subjects to exercise by being reminded of when 
they were younger. It also demonstrates that playing music 
leads to more motivated participation and that feedback was 
generally positive. 
When evaluating the desire to play again, it is important 
to take into account that the skeletal frames were not always 
properly detected and that the subjects might become bored 
with the game over long periods. We did not survey this 
point in the study.  
The following positive and negative comments were 
made by the respondents outside of the five-level evaluation. 
 Positive points 
– The game is a good incentive for exercise. 
– The game reminded me of my younger self. 
– The game gives me something to focus on. 
– The game enabled me to move my hands again by 
reminding me of when I was younger. 
– The game is nice in that the colors change. 
– The game reminded me of when I played basketball. 
– The game is good for exercise. 
Negative points 
– I was not used to the game, so the movements were a bit 
difficult. 
– I did not have a good impression of the game because it 
did not display me properly (the skeletal frame was not 
properly detected). 
– The game responded too slowly. 
– It would have been nicer if the game moved in accordance 
with the music (permitting dancing). 
– There should have been more variety in the falling objects. 
 
One opinion that was particularly prevalent was that the 
game reminded the subjects of being younger, allowing 
them to move their bodies freely again. It is likely this was 
due to (1) increased motivation to move associated with 
their interest in new things (the Kinect system) and (2) 
music they were familiar with was being played.  
Some subjects were not able to evaluate the game 
properly because their skeletal frame was not correctly 
detected. Most of these subjects were wheelchair users, 
implying that the problem was due to Kinect not being able 
to distinguish armrests from arms and therefore failing to 
recognize a proper skeletal frame. 
 
V. 
OBSERVATIONS 
The nursing home facility usually has a 45-minute 
recreation session in the afternoon, where the elderly 
exercise by participating in bread-eating contests, playing 
balloon volleyball in which they move their arms in fan-like 
motions, or playing on a Wii (Wii Sports, Wii Fit). They 
also perform exercises that involve balancing, stretching, 
getting up and walking as a pastime while waiting for other 
people to finish their morning baths. In contrast to the kind 
of rehabilitation performed at hospitals, which is aimed at 
recovering a person’s motor functions (such as going to the 
bathroom alone) by practicing movements necessary for 
daily life, at the nursing home, rehabilitation involves the 
functions the person still possesses. Regarding the 
differences between the two kinds of rehabilitation, we 
received comments from the exercise instructors including 
“It’s good that they can use their whole bodies without the 
use of objects” and “The movements have been made 
slower, so it is different from things that are made for 
slightly younger people, like the Wii, and it provides a more 
comfortable exercise for people who cannot move quickly, 
such as the elderly.” As these comments show, the game 
was more playable for the elderly subjects in test 2 than 
those in test 1 by adjusting the rate and speed of the falling 
objects to be lower than those in the original program. 
Next, we considered the opinions received in the survey. 
These opinions suggested that some of the subjects required 
a long time to get used to the controls, but since the 
movements were very simple, it did not take long to 
understand the game in general. Many subjects also stated 
that being able to remember their younger selves made them 
able to move their bodies again. It is likely that the music 
played at the time played a large part in this. Subjects stated 
that this program offered a new experience for the subjects, 
and we were able to get them interested and move their 
bodies actively because of this. However, this only reflects 
their evaluation of the program when first experiencing it. It 
is possible that they will be less interested with the program, 
if they use it numerous times. The program itself involves 
touching round objects that fall from above to earn points, 
but there is no fixed play time, and the same objects fall 
down (even if they change color). Therefore, there is not a 
lot of visual variety and subjects may become easily bored 
with the game when playing it repeatedly or for long periods. 
Regarding detection of the skeletal frame, recognition was 
insufficient during test 1. Several people experienced 
problems in having their skeletal frames detected because 
the distance from Kinect to the subjects had not been 
adjusted to the number of people present, and the test 
location was too bright. Also, sometimes Kinect had trouble 
discerning between the armrests of a wheelchair and the 
arms of the person in that wheelchair. However, in test 2, 
42

CENTRIC 2013 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Human-oriented and Personalized Mechanisms, Technologies, and Services

detection of the skeletal frames was improved, because we 
had a better understanding of the optimal distance between 
Kinect and the test subjects.  
A comprehensive evaluation of the results from test 2 
showed that most suggestions received in test 1 were 
properly implemented in the revised program. Thus, test 1 
allowed us to improve the game so that subjects could 
perform reasonable exercise, and disregarding the problem 
of experiencing the same program continuously, the 
program was fresh and new and stimulated the subjects. In 
addition, the game was relatively easy for the subjects to 
understand because of the intuitive controls of Kinect. 
When comparing our program using Kinect with the Wii, 
we suggest that Kinect is more useful for rehabilitation 
programs, because it is easier to perform exercise with the 
easy controls, and because the movements can be slowed to 
the subjects' requirements. 
 
VI. 
FUTURE WORK 
We asked the instructors who participated in test 2 what 
they would like to see changed in the future. The following 
comments were received: 
– The program should change as time passes. 
– It might be fun if the objects came in from the sides as 
well from above. 
– There should be more room for competition. 
– The game should stimulate the subjects to bend their 
bodies and stretch their arms sideways by having the objects 
center on the subjects at first and then gradually fall in from 
the sides. 
VII. SUMMARY 
The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a 
rehabilitation program using the recent development of 
Kinect motion capture technology. We performed tests 
making use of the Kinect’s innate features of not requiring a 
controller and allowing intuitive play through physical 
gestures for the rehabilitation of people with physical 
disabilities, such as the elderly. Evaluation of the developed 
program in test 2 suggested new ways of using Kinect as an 
exercise aid for the test subjects. 
Kinect was originally used for playing games and 
creating 3D images on PCs using motion capture technology. 
However, this study demonstrates that our revised program 
can be used with Kinect to offer rehabilitation to elderly 
people with physical disabilities.  
Results of surveys taken after the tests indicated that 
many people were interested in the program and it yielded 
favorable impressions as a means of exercise by reminding 
the subjects of when they were young. In addition, playing 
music that the subjects were familiar with helped encourage 
subjects to participate. 
However, some subjects could not use the program 
because their skeletal frames were not detected properly. 
This suggests it is necessary to alter the sensitivity of the 
skeletal frame detection program specifically for the 
environment used. In addition, the program should be 
enhanced to prevent the subjects from becoming bored 
during the long-term use required for rehabilitation. 
Surveys results for problems with our program and 
suggested improvements demonstrated that Kinect can be 
used for rehabilitation programs. Therefore, future research 
should investigate the development of rehabilitation 
programs using Kinect. This study shows that the revised 
program in conjunction with Kinect was enjoyed by elderly 
people and it invoked their desire to exercise.
