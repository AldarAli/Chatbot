Abstract— Antenna-based biosensors have attracted an 
increasing research interest in the biomedical and 
healthcare 
community 
due 
to 
their 
reliability, 
sustainability, 
portability, 
scalability 
and 
cost-
effectiveness. These benefits depend on a holistic 
functional design and modelling of the antenna 
subsystem. This paper presents the design and modelling 
of a novel elliptically-slotted patch antenna (ESPA) 
based biosensor that yields a total gain of 7.5 dBi. This 
novel biosensing antenna is label-free, amenable to real-
time embedded circuit-emulating implementations and 
resistant to all solvents and reagents.

 INTRODUCTION 
New approaches for biological cell detection are being 
developed to improve the biosensor characteristics such as 
sensitivity, smaller footprint, selectivity, integration with 
microfluidic devices for sample handing, reproducibility, 
non-invasive and rapid real-time detection. Recently, radio 
frequency (RF) and microwave antenna biosensors have 
drawn attention in the development of biological cell 
detection due to their numerous applications including 
clinical analysis, real-time monitoring (of food, water and 
environment) and biosecurity [1-3]. Most the intensive 
research interests have revolved around biological and 
material science fields. Antenna biosensors enable the real-
time detection of the electrical and/or magnetic properties of 
biological materials (potentially also for bacteria like E. 
coli) at RF/microwave frequency. This approach provides a 
smart real time detection of biological samples without the 
need for biosample labelling, material intrusion and 
chemical transformation. 
The detection principle of antenna biosensors is to sense 
and characterise the changes of the return loss (S11) (or 
reflection coefficient, Г) and the dielectric properties (i.e., 
relative permittivity and loss tangent) in the useable 
resonant 
RF/microwave 
bandwidth 
caused 
by 
the 
biosample. The dielectric properties of various biosamples 
at frequency 2.79 GHz such as blood, cortical bone, blood 
vessels, fat and muscle are given in Table 1. The 
development focus has been on metamaterials that can 
provide the needed trade-off between the practical antenna 
size and the designed resonant wavelength. We investigated 
and modelled various novel patch antenna configurations to 
provide the optimal sensing location for the biosample 
detection. The elliptically-slotted patch antenna geometry 
with an eccentricity of cos 60o (or √(0.75)) yielded the best 
solution for the designed antenna size and resonant 
wavelength. RF/microwave antenna have been considered to 
be more suitable for real-time biosensing due to their unique 
properties such as non-invasive and non-ionising radiation 
sensing. 
These 
make 
RF/microwave 
antenna-based 
biosensors the more appealing alternatives for specific 
transducers currently employed in the development of 
biosensors [1, 4, 5]. The biomedical application domain of 
the reported novel ESPA system can be extended to include 
spacecraft-borne space-based wireless biosensing devices 
[6, 7].  
This paper is organised as follows. Section II presents 
the patch antenna system design including the system design 
parameters and the elliptically-slotted patch antenna system 
model. In section III, the simulation parameters, results and 
discussion are stated. The paper is concluded in section IV.

The EM-wave energy loss during transmittance is called 
the loss tangent, tan δ, and defined as the ratio of the lossy 
to the lossless EM-wave energy transmittances. The width 
of the patch influences the input impedance and hence, the 
antenna bandwidth. The larger the width of the patch 
antenna, the broader its bandwidth. Also, an increase in the 
antenna width results in a decrease in its input impedance 
(at the expense of a large footprint patch antenna system). 
 
B. ESPA System Model 
The CAD model of the ESPA system is created and 
Figure 1 shows the front view, where the elliptical slot is 
seen at the centre of the patch.  
The substrate is a Rogers RT duroid® glass fiber 
reinforced 
polytetrafluoroethylene 
(PTFE) 
composite 
designed for microstrip circuit applications. The actual patch 
component is a substrate-centralised elliptically-slotted 
copper metal with a thickness of 1–1.6 mm. The ESPA 
system is excited with a pin, such as a SubMiniature version 
A (SMA) connector. The ESPA feed assembly is a coaxial 
cable or probe feed is from underneath through the ground 
plane. The outer conductor of the coaxial cable is connected 
to the finite ground plane and the centre conductor passes 
through the substrate to the patch antenna.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. Slotless versus Slotted Patch Antenna 
A novel ESPA was designed, modelled and simulated 
for biosensing applications. Table 2 shows the parameters of 
the ESPA system utilised for simulation. The model was 
simulated over finite and infinite grounds. The performance 
of the proposed ESPA system was compared with a 
conventional slotless patch antenna (CSPA). There is a 
considerable improvement in performance, weight, size and 
power consumption requirements of the ESPA design over 
the traditional patch antenna. Furthermore, the ESPA model 
allows 
for 
an 
integrated 
combinational 
design 
of 
metamaterials to be implemented.

B. ESPA Performance Analysis 
Figures 2 and 3 give the reflection coefficients versus 
frequency for the conventional slotless patch antenna and the 
ESPA system respectively. The CSPA system resonates at 
about 2.69 GHz (finite ground) and 2.88 GHz (infinite 
ground) thereby yielding approximately 6.6 % difference in 
the resonance frequency (Figure 2). The ESPA architecture 
resonates at roughly 2.77 GHz (finite ground) and 2.83 GHz 
(infinite ground) thereby yielding a resonance difference of 
approximately 2.5 %. The difference in resonance becomes 
greater if the substrate dimensions are decreased further. In 
any given EM-based sensor design, a good correlation 
between simulated and real-life models is required. To 
ensure that the results of both the finite and infinite 
substrates improve, the geometrical size of the finite 
substrate must be increased to better match the infinite 
approximation. To obviate this requirement for reliable, 
small footprint and portable antenna systems for biosensing 
applications, the ESPA system is proposed. The centre-
design frequency, fc, of the patch antenna system is 2.793 
GHz and the close-to-real-life ESPA system yields a 
resonance frequency of 0.993fc. Moreover, the simulated 
ESPA model indicates a good correlation and yields the 
same reflection coefficient of approximately -14.0 dB at the 
fc (Figure 3).  
Figure 4 shows the impedance magnitude of the ESPA 
system 
for 
biosensing 
applications. 
In 
any 
given 
RF/microwave system application, impedance matching is a 
critical requirement for system transceiver stability and/or 
distortionless signal applications. The finite approximation 
(or near-real-life) model depicts a 50-Ω impedance at 2.77 
GHz. This matches the characteristic impedance (typically 
50 Ω or 75 Ω) of the input port of RF/microwave transceiver 
systems for biosensing applications. In Figure 5, the voltage 
standing wave ratio (VSWR) for the closely-matched finite 
and infinite models of the ESPA system is approximately 4 
dB at the fc. The VSWR values at 2.77 GHz (finite substrate) 
and 2.83 GHz (infinite substrate) are roughly 1 dB 
respectively. Figure 6 shows the mismatch losses of the 
infinite and finite models for the ESPA system. The 
maximum loss for each approximation occurs at their 
respective resonant frequencies and agrees with the 
scattering-parameters analysis. 
The radiation pattern of the ESPA system is illustrated in 
Figure 7. The fields are linearly polarised and the total gain 
is 5.0 dB in the vertical direction. Rectangular patch 
antennas are typically narrowband with a bandwidth of 
approximately 3 %.

Figure 5. VSWR of the ESPA System 
 
The ESPA was designed to operate at 2.79 GHz but it is 
resonant at 2.77 GHz. This frequency shift is attributed to 
the fringing fields around the antenna, which make the 
ESPA seem longer. The general design principle is to trim 
the patch antenna by typically 2–4 % to obtain resonance at 
the desired centre-design frequency. The fringing fields near 
the surface of the ESPA are responsible for its radiation. 
Equal but opposite currents flow through the ESPA and 
cancel the radiation due to current. The fringing fields are 
more bowed (extending further from patch) by a smaller 
value of εr; the smaller the value of εr, the better the 
radiation efficiency. Thus, the proposed novel ESPA is an 
excellent candidate for biosensing applications involving 
various microbes.

Figure 6. Mismatch Loss of the ESPA System 
 
Figure 8 shows the radiation pattern of the ESPA system 
with a blood sample at 2.8 GHz with the parameters 
provided in Table 1 (other samples with their respective 
parameters can be used as well). The directivity of the 
antenna changes due to the presence of the sample and 
yields 7.5 dBi. This helps to differentiate between various 
biosamples and serves as a real-time biosensor for body 
tissues and micro-molecules.

CONCLUSION 
The presented novel elliptically-slotted patch antenna has 
the lowest electrical loss, low moisture absorption, uniform 
electrical properties over the operating frequencies and 
excellent chemical resistance. The ESPA geometry with a 
semi-major to semi-minor axes ratio of 2:1 and an 
eccentricity of cos 60o (or √(0.75)) yielded the best solution 
for the designed antenna size and resonant wavelength. The 
ESPA system yields a total gain of 6.0 dBi, 7.5 dBi and 9.0 
dBi at 2.6 GHz, 2.8 GHz and 3.0 GHz respectively. The 
substrate is a glass microfiber reinforced PTFE composite 
that can be easily integrated into real-time embedded 
microstrip circuit for low-cost, small footprint, low-profile 
and easy-to-fabricate biosensor systems applications. This 
novel antenna is more suitable for biosensing application as 
it holds a great promise in enhancing the sensitive, selective, 
real-time detection of low-concentration label-free and 
“spot-volume” biological samples.
