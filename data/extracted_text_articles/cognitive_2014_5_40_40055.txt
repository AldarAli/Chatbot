Abstract—In this study, we discuss emotion classification for 
seven kinds of emotion (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, 
surprise, stress) in the psycho-physiological research. Seven 
emotions are evoked by stimulus formed on audio-visual film 
clips, and then physiological signals of autonomic nervous 
system responses are measured for the reaction of stimulation. 
Additionally, seven different emotions will be classified by the 
proposed classification methodology using physiological signals. 
We introduce a classification methodology on memory-based 
learning that dwells upon the usage of genetic strategy (Genetic 
Algorithms). Genetic algorithms (GAs) take selection problems 
of instances and features of memory into two level optimization 
processes. In the first level, GAs chooses P % of instances as a 
set of memory comes from instances with c classes. In the 
second level of the optimization process, GAs is instrumental in 
the formation of a core set of features that is a collection of the 
most meaningful and discriminative components of the original 
feature space. In classification problems, it becomes important 
to carefully select instances and establish a subset of features in 
order to achieve a sound performance of a classifier. The study 
offers a complete algorithmic framework and demonstrates the 
effectiveness of the approach for the classification of seven 
emotions. Numerical experiments show that a suitable selection 
of instances and a substantial reduction of the feature space 
could be accomplished and the classifier formed in this manner 
is characterized by high classification accuracy for the seven 
emotions based on physiological signals.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, the most popular research in the field of 
emotion recognition on human-computer interaction is to 
recognize human's feeling using various physiological 
signals. In the psycho-physiological research, it is known 
that there is strong correlation between human emotion state 
and physiological reaction. Emotion plays an important role 
in contextual understanding of messages from others in 
speech or visual forms. For affective communication 
between user and computer, it has to consider how emotions 
can be recognized and expressed during human-computer 
interaction and emotion recognition is one of the key steps 
towards emotional intelligence in advanced human-machine 
interaction. Psychologists and engineers have tried to analyze 
facial 
expressions, 
vocal 
emotions, 
gestures, 
and 
physiological signals in an attempt to understand and 
categorize emotions. Many previous studies on emotion have 
reported that there is correlation between basic emotions 
such happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc. and physiological 
responses [1]-[3]. Recently, emotion recognition using 
physiological signals has been performed by various 
machine 
learning 
algorithms 
(e.g., 
Fisher’s 
Linear 
Discriminant, 
k-Nearest 
Neighbor 
algorithm, 
Neural 
Networks, and Support Vector Machine , etc.[4]-[8]). 
The objective of this study is to achieve dataset on multi-
physiological signals for seven emotions induced by an 
emotional stimulus and to develop memory-based learning 
classifier driven by genetic algorithms. Firstly, in order to get 
physiological signals for emotions, we use 10 different 
emotional stimuli set to induce seven emotions, i.e., 
happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise and stress 
under the same conditions. We identify emotion-specific 
physiological responses induced by these emotional stimuli. 
To induce each emotion, ten emotional stimuli sets which 
have been tested their suitability and effectiveness, are used 
in 
experiment. 
Physiological 
signals, 
namely, 
Skin 
temperature 
(SKT), 
photoplethysmography 
(PPG), 
electrodermal activity (EDA) and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
are acquired by MP100 Biopac system Inc. (USA) and 
analyzed to extract features for emotional pattern dataset. 
For emotion classification, we use one of the techniques 
of evolutionary optimization, namely, genetic algorithms 
(GAs) [9]-[10]. In order to improve classification speed and 
accuracy of a classifier, suitable formations of a set of 
instance and features are required. GAs embraces two 
optimization processes, that is, choosing P % of instances as 
a set of memory comes from patterns with seven classes 
(emotions) and forming a core set of features that is a 
collection of the most meaningful and discriminative 
components of the original feature space. Numerical 
experiments are carried out and it is shown that a suitable 
selection of prototypes and a substantial reduction of the 
feature space could be accomplished that is also 
accompanied with a higher classification accuracy.

The study is organized into five sections. We outline the 
measurements of physiological signal induced by seven 
emotion stimuli in Section II. Section III covers all necessary 
development issues by the optimization scheme. Numeric 
experimental studies are presented in Section IV while 
Section V offers some concluding comments. 
II. 
STIMULI AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS FOR SEVEN 
EMOTIONS 
In this study six males (20.8 years±1.26) and six females 
(21.2 years±2.70) students participated. None of the subjects 
reported any history of medical illness or psychotropic 
medication and any medication that would affect the 
cardiovascular, respiratory, or central nervous system. A 
written consent was obtained before the beginning 
A. Emotional stimuli 
As shown in Fig. 1, seventy emotional stimuli (7 
emotions x 10 set) are used to successfully induce emotions. 
Emotional stimuli are selected the 2-4 min long audio-visual 
film clips which are captured originally from movies and TV. 
Audio-visual film clips have widely used because these have 
the desirable properties of being readily standardized, 
involving no deception, and being dynamic rather than static 
[11]-[14].

The used audio-visual film clips are examined their 
suitability and effectiveness by preliminary study. After 
being presented each film clip, twenty-two college students 
rate the category and intensity of their experienced emotion 
on emotional assessment scale. The result shows that 
emotional stimuli have the suitability of 93% and the 
effectiveness of 9.5 point on average. The suitability of each 
stimulus is ranged from 75 to 100% and from 8.4 to 10.4 
point in the effectiveness as shown in Table I. The suitability 
of emotional stimuli means the consistency between the 
target emotions designed to induce each emotion and the 
categories of participants’ experienced emotion. The 
effectiveness is determined by the intensity of emotions 
reported and rated by the subjects on a 1 to 11 point Likert-
type scale (e.g., 1 being “least happy” or “not happy” and 11 
being “most happy”). 
B. Physiological signals 
The dataset of physiological signals such as SKT, EDA, 
PPG, and ECG are collected by MP100 Biopac system. SKT 
is an important and effective indicator of emotion states and 
reflects autonomic nervous system activity. Variations in the 
SKT mainly come from localized changes in blood flow 
caused by vascular resistance or arterial blood pressure. EDA 
is a method of measuring the electrical conductance of the 
skin, which varies depending on the moisture of the skin, 
caused by sweat. PPG is a signal derived from light 
absorption changes in pulse oximeters in contact with the 
skin. The change in the light absorption reflects a change in 
the blood flow rate. Thus, the PPG signal is subordinate to 
pulse pressure, i.e., the difference between systolic and 
diastolic pressure in the arteries. Lastly, ECG is a 
transthoracic (across the thorax or chest) interpretation of the 
electrical activity of the heart over a period of time, as 
detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and 
recorded by a device external to the body.

SKT electrodes are attached on the first joint of non-
dominant ring finger and on the first joint of the non-
dominant thumb for PPG. EDA is measured with the use of 8 
mm AgCl electrodes placed on the volar surface of the distal 
phalanges of the index and middle fingers of the non-
dominant hand. Electrodes are filled with a 0.05 molar 
isotonic NaCl paste to provide a continuous connection 
between the electrodes and the skin. ECG electrodes are 
placed on both wrists and one left ankle with two kinds of 
electrodes, sputtered and AgCl ones. The left-ankle electrode 
is used as a reference.  
 The signals are acquired for 1 minute long baseline state 
prior to presentation of emotional stimuli and 2-4 minutes 
long emotional states during presentation of the stimuli. The 
obtained signals are analyzed for 30 seconds from the 
baseline and the emotional state. The emotional states are 
determined by the result of participant’s self-report. 
C. Feature extraction 
For seven emotions, 28 features extracted from the 
physiological signals and used to analysis are shown in Table 
II. Skin conductance level (SCL), average of skin 
conductance response (meanSCR) and number of skin 
conductance response are obtained from EDA. The mean 
(meanSKT) and maximum skin temperature (maxSKT) and 
the mean amplitude of blood volume changes (meanPPG) 
are gotten from SKT and PPG, respectively. ECG is 
analyzed in the view point of time domain and frequency 
domain. Analysis in time domain is divided into the 
statistical and the geometric approaches and in frequency 
domain is dealt with FFT and AR. 
III. 
DESIGN OF MEMORY-BASED LEARINIG CLASSIFIER 
For the classification of seven emotions, the proposed 
classifier is a type of memory-based learning that uses only 
specific instances to solve classification problem. Namely, 
the classifier is a method for classifying objects based on the 
closest training samples called memorized instances in the 
feature space. This classifier embraces two selection 
problems to classify a new pattern to a class. One is the 
selection of instance to be memorized and another is feature 
selection.  
Initialization
(Randomly generate an initial population)
Evaluation
(Compute and store the fitness for each individual)
Reproduction
(Generate the next generation by probabilistically selecting 
individuals to produce offspring via genetic operators)

Figure 2.  General Flowchart of Genetic Algorithms 
To format instance to be memorized, we start with 
choose P % of patterns using GAs. The classifier generates 
classification predictions using only P % of patterns. The 
classifier does not use any model to fit and only is based on 
distance between a pattern and memorized instance. Given a 
set of N instance, the classifier finds the one instance closest 
in feature space to an unknown pattern, and then assigns the 
unknown pattern to the class label of its nearest instance. The 
underlying distance between a pattern and an instance is 
measured by weighted Euclidean one,

where x and y are the two patterns in the n-dimensional 
space and σi is the standard deviation of the i-th feature 
whose value is computed using the instance set. 
Secondly, once the instances to be memorized have been 
formed, we reduce feature space by choosing a core set of 
features encountered in the problem. Those features are 
regarded as the most essential ensemble of features that, 
organized together, exhibit the highest discriminatory 
capabilities. We use GAs to choose d % of features which 
minimizes the classification error. 
GAs have proven to be useful in optimization of such 
problems because of their ability to efficiently use historical 
information to obtain new solutions with enhanced 
performance and a global nature of search supported there 
[9][10]. GAs are also theoretically and empirically proven to 
support robust search in complex search spaces. The search 
of the solution space is completed with the aid of several 
genetic operators. There are three basic genetic operators 
used in any GAs - supported search that is reproduction,

crossover, and mutation. Reproduction is a process in which 
the mating pool for the next generation is chosen. Individual 
strings are copied into the mating pool according to their 
fitness function values. Crossover usually proceeds in two 
steps. First, members from the mating pool are mated at 
random. Second, each pair of strings undergoes crossover as 
follows: a position l along the string is selected uniformly at 
random from the interval [1, l-1], where l is the length of the 
string. Two new strings are created by swapping all 
characters between the positions k and l. Mutation is a 
random alteration of the value of a string position. In a 
binary coding, mutation means changing a zero to a one or 
vice versa. Mutation occurs with small probability. Those 
three operators, combined with the proper definition of the 
fitness function, constitute the main body of the genetic 
computing. A general flowchart is visualized in Fig. 2. 
As a generic search strategy, the GAs has to be adjusted 
to solve a given optimization problem. There are two 
fundamental components that deserve our attention: a fitness 
function, and a representational form of the search space. 
Given the wrapper mode of instance formation and feature 
selection, we consider the minimization of the classification 
error as a suitable fitness measure. There could be different 
choices of the search space considering that an optimal 
collection of features could be represented in several 
different ways. Here, we adopt the representation scheme of 
the search space in the form of the n-dimensional unit 
hypercube (N is the number of patterns while n denotes the 
number of features of emotional dataset). The content of a 
chromosome is ranked viz. each value in this vector is 
associated with an index the given value assumes in the 
ordered sequence of all values encountered in the vector 
(The elements of a chromosome for prototypes and features 
are ranked separately.). Considering that we are concerned 
with d % of all features, we pick up the first d×n (0<d<1) 
entries of the vector of the search space. This produces a 
collection of features forming the reduced feature space. This 
mechanism of the formation of the feature space is portrayed 
in Fig. 3. For the entire patterns, the prototype formation is 
carried out in the same manner as we encountered in the 
feature selection. 
Given the instance formation and the feature selection, 
we consider the minimization of the classification error to be 
a suitable fitness measure of GAs.

There are two stopping conditions for seven emotion 
classification: (a) the algorithm terminates if the objective 
function does not improve during the last 100 generations, 
otherwise (b) it terminates after 500 iterations. The size of 
the population is related to the dimensionality of the search 
space. 
IV. 
RESULTS OF EMOTION CLASSIFICATION  
The numerical studies presented here provide some 
experimental evidence behind the effectiveness of the GAs 
approach. The detailed setup of an extensive suite of 
experiments is reflective of the methodology we outlined in 
the previous sections. The two essential parameters that we 
use in the assessment of the performance of prototype and 
feature selection are the percentage of features (denoted by 
“d”) forming the core of the reduced feature space and the 
percentage of the data forming the instance set (P) optimized 
by the GAs. The results are reported for the testing data sets 
for various values of “P” and “d”. 
In this paper, for the optimization of the classification of 
seven emotions, GAs uses the serial method of real type, 
roulette-wheel in the selection operator, one-point crossover 
in the crossover operator, and uniform in the mutation 
operator. More specifically, we use the following values of 
the parameters: maximum number of generations is 500; the 
number of populations is 100, crossover rate is 0.75, and 
mutation probability is set to 0.1. 
For the seven emotions dataset given as multi-
physiological 
signals, 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
percentage of features used in the GAs optimization, values 
of “P” and the resulting classification accuracy is presented 
in Table III. Here, “No. of F” is the number of selected 
features for d % of entire features, “AVG” and “STD” 
indicate average and standard deviation, respectively. The 
classification 
accuracy 
was 
computed 
over 
10-fold 
realization of the experiments, namely, for each combination 
of the values of the parameters (d and P), the experiments 
was repeated 10 times by running GAs. Fig. 4 shows the 
result of fitness function of GAs for d=30 and P=70. There is 
an evident effect of the “optimal” subsets of the instance and 
the feature space: clearly the subsets leads to better 
classification results when compared with the outcomes of 
the classifier operating on the entire feature space.

With the increasing values of “d”, the classification 
accuracy of seven emotions decreases substantially; in the 
case of P=30% it drops from 44.4 to 24.3 when increasing 
the number of features from 10% to 70%. Conclusively, the 
use of all features dropped accuracy of classification for 
seven emotions. Changes in the values of “P” have far less 
effect on the classification rate, however, the distinguished 
result was occurred in d=30 and P=70. From these results, 
we observe that the number of suitable features is 8 and 70 % 
of dataset are required as the prototype for the seven emotion 
recognition using multi-physiological signals. We report the 
number of occurrences of the features in Fig. 5. This 
indicator becomes more illustrative and offers an interesting 
view at the suitability of the features when forming various 
reduced feature spaces and using different prototype set sizes. 
In case of d=30 % for the classification of seven emotions, 
namely, the number of features is 8, we have gotten that 
classification accuracy is 83 % for P=70.  
For the classification of seven emotions, Table 4 
contrasts the classification accuracy (%) of the proposed 
method with other well-known methods studied in the 
literatures [5]-[8]. These machine learning algorithms are 
standard algorithms, which have been applied to various and 
lots of fields. For more information, refer to [5]-[8].  
As abovementioned, the experiments are reported for the 
10 times using a split of data into 70% training and 30% 
testing subsets, namely, 70% of the whole patterns are 
selected randomly for training of all methods and the 
remaining patterns are used for testing purposes. The results 
are averaged over 10 times for testing dataset. The 
experimental results reveal that the proposed approach and 
the resulting model outperform the existing methods both in 
terms of the simpler structure and better prediction 
(generalization) capabilities on feature space reduced 70% of 
entire feature space. 
While the experimental results provide sound evidence 
behind the selection process showing that the reduced feature 
spaces led to the better classification results than those 
obtained in some previous studies, they are also quite 
revealing in showing that the reduction of the feature space 
could exhibit different effectiveness. In some cases, the 
reduction of the dimensionality of the feature space could be 
high but there could be cases where the elimination of 
subsets of features could not be strongly justifiable

CONCLUSION 
In this study, we have discussed the acquisition of multi-
physiology signals using emotion stimuli and the design of a 
classification methodology for seven emotions.  The emotion 
stimuli used to induce a participant’s emotion were evaluated 
for their suitability and effectiveness. The result showed that 
emotional stimuli have the suitability of 93% and the 
effectiveness of 9.5 point on average. Twenty eight features 
have been extracted by means of the statistical and the 
geometric approaches in time and frequency domain from 
physiological signals such as EDA, SKT, PPG and ECG. 
These signals have been induced by emotional stimuli. In 
order to improve the classification accuracy using 
physiological signals for seven emotions, we have

introduced a memory-based learning classifier using the 
evolutionally mechanism for the seven emotions expressed 
by physiological signals. The optimization process of 
forming the instance and the feature space is reflective of the 
conjecture on the importance of forming a set of instance and 
a core set of features whose discriminatory capabilities 
emerge through their co-occurrence in these set. The 
methodology of feature selection becomes legitimate 
considering that we immediately see the result of the 
reduction of the feature space being translated into the 
corresponding classification rate. The use of the instance is 
also justifiable considering that this classification scheme is 
the simplest that could be envisioned in pattern classification. 
The proposed classifier will lead to better chance to 
recognize human emotions by using physiological signals in 
the emotional interaction between man and machine.
