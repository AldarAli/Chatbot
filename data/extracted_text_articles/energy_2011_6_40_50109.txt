Abstract—Power line communication is an emerging commu-
nication technology for the home area network of Smart Grid.
To evaluate the performance of power line communication,
in our previous work, we derived the closed-form probability
density function for the real part of amplitude distribution
of Nakagami-like background noise. With this result, in this
paper, we investigated the bit error rate performance of
binary modulated signal with a single channel transmission.
We derived an expression of bit error rate performance and
veriﬁed its validity through simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION
Smart Grid becomes the focus of public attention as
a next-generation energy efﬁciency optimization. In Smart
Grid, various communication technologies enable a two-
way exchange of energy consumption and control data via
wired/wireless medium. Power line communication (PLC)
has been adopted as a communication technology for the
automatic meter reading (AMR) [1] and, recently, massively
deployed in Korea. Now, PLC is a candidate technology for
Smart Grid as a home area network (HAN) communication
infrastructure.
To adopt the PLC technology effectively, there is a need
for the channel modeling of background noise, impulsive
noise, etc. [2], [3]. The channel modeling for the power-
line channel has been extensively analyzed and simulated
by many researchers. They tried to ﬁnd the exact (or
approximated) channel parameters such as noise, impedance,
and attenuation. Among the various parameters for channel
modeling, noise is important to evaluate the performance
of PLC system. However, due to the nature of power-
line channel such as various topologies, connected electrical
appliances, types of electrical loads, etc. , the noise modeling
could not be easily described as a mathematical expression.
Recently, it was proposed that the amplitude of back-
ground noise in power-line channel follows the Nakagami-m
distribution [4] [5]. The bit error rate (BER) performance
of the PLC system was also evaluated for both single and
multi-channel transmission. In [5], however, the BER per-
formances are not expressed as a closed-form mathematical
expression, there is thus work to be done yet. We brieﬂy
review the previous work in Section II and derive the BER
performance in Section III. The mathematical expression
gives the system designer a better understanding of the
system design and a performance prediction for his system.

III. DERIVATION OF THE BER PERFORMANCE
In this section, we derive the BER performance of binary
data transmission with the noise as described in section II.
Fig. 1 demonstrates the system model for binary transmis-
sion. A transmitter sends binary data, A or −A, then, the
decision metric at the receiver, r, is deﬁned as
r = ±A + y,
(5)
which is added by Nakagami-like background power-line
noise, y. We assumed the perfect time and carrier synchro-
nization in demodulation for the ease of analysis.
Then, the average bit error rate (BER), Pe, can be ex-
pressed as
Pe = p(A)P (E|s = A) + p(−A)P (E|s = −A)
(6)
where p(A) is the probability that the transmitter sends data
A, and P (E|s = A) is the probability of error decision at the
receiver when data A is transmitted. With equal probability
of transmitting A and −A, Eqn. (6) is represented as
Pe = 1
2P (E|s = A) + 1
2P (E|s = −A).
(7)
Since the noise PDF, p(y), is symmetric about y = 0, we
get
Pe = P (E|s = A) = P (E|s = −A) =

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
Numerical examples for the BER performance of binary
modulated receiver under Nakagami-like background noise
are presented through both analysis and simulation. The
analyzed BER performance is obtained using Eqn.(26). For
the ease of analysis, we assumed the transmitted data A = 1.
The simulated performances are obtained by using the Monte
Carlo method with 107 binary transmitted data. Fig. 2
compares the simulated and analyzed BER performance
with m = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 1. As m increases, the BER
performance improves since the Nakagami-like background
noise, y, has the shape of PDF close to Gaussian PDF, with a
result similar to [5]. Thus, the signal-to-noise ratio increases
as m increases. Simulation results with various m values
show good agreement between simulations and analysis up
to the SNR of 10 dB.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the BER performance of binary trans-
mitted signal under Nakagami-like background noise was
presented. We derived the BER performance with conven-
tional functions such as the hypergeometric function and the
Gamma function. Simulated results show the validity of the
derived BER performances. With these results, a PLC system
designer can easily predict and analyze the performance of
HAN system. The BER performance with impulsive noise
and the transmission of multi-channel modulated signal
would be the focus of the future work.
