Abstract— A new type of citizen participation has recently 
emerged in the Islamic Middle East countries through 
discourse on social media Websites, which opened up 
opportunities for citizens’ participation in socio-political 
movements. Despite Internet restrictions in the form of heavy 
imposed state filtering and censorship, the Internet and its 
various applications provide effective communication channels 
for acquiring free information and disseminating thoughts, 
ideas, opinions, reflections and information sharing about 
socio-cultural, political, environmental and economic matters. 
The results of this empirical study show that there is a linkage 
between information usage and citizens’ organized social 
actions, in the form of waves of street demonstrations, as we 
have seen across the region, as citizens demand a more open 
society, freedom and democracy. By applying the theory of 
new media communication, this study has found that 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has not 
only played an important role in building digital communities 
across the region, but also citizens’ who use effectively and 
efficiently ICT communication channels are more likely to 
participate in political discourse and mobilization.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are 
viewed by many scholars as an environment for promoting 
freedom of expression, social inclusion [1, 2], and as a 
catalyst in elevating public discourse, political participation 
and mobilization [3, 4, 5, 6]. In this context ICTs have 
created a new powerful social actor called “digital citizen” 
or “e-citizen” [7, 8, 9]. Other scholars view ICTs as a source 
of emancipation [10] in which citizens are involved in 
communication discourse with the aim of improving human 
lives and creating a more just and fair society [11]. The 
increased popularity of the Internet has not only resulted in 
increased citizens’ participation in public discourse, but also 
enabled them to request for more transparency and 
accountability [12, 13] from public servants, elective 
representatives and government officials. In other words 
citizens are able to actively participate in dialogues with 
democratic actors by raising concerns regarding local, 
national and global issues.  
In non-democratic countries, however, the role of ICTs 
in communication discourse is a more complex process than 
those of free nations. On the one hand, ICTs have provided 
citizens the opportunity to access free information, learn 
more about the world outside of their home countries, 
(otherwise not available in the official print and 
broadcasting); on the other hand, these ICT communication 
channels are heavily monitored and censored by the elites in 
power. Stahl [11] points out that in many developing 
countries, ICT may not only be able to address numerous 
social issues, but more importantly, it should be viewed as 
"a solution to a range of social ills" ([11], p.162). In this 
context the overall aim of ICT is emancipating citizens with 
the ultimate goal of improving society. ICT through its 
various applications such as the Internet, TV and radio 
broadcastings, mobile SMS and MMS messages, e-mail, 
chat and so on, enabled people around the world to 
exchange political, social, cultural, science, history, 
literature and in short information in a borderless format and 
in shortest possible time.  The Internet, for example, made it 
possible for millions of bloggers and users, in social 
networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, around the 
world, to create their own version of news or of cultural 
agencies. Youtube created a magnificent collection of video 
clips ranging from political, social, cultural, news and 
entertainment posted by people around the globe, a 
phenomenon that could not be predicted a few decades ago.  
However, these ICTs are subject to heavy monitoring 
and filtering arrangements. According to various reports 
published by independent institutes such as Freedom House, 
Reporters Without Borders (RWB) and OpenNet Initiative 
(ONI), ICT censorship and content filtering is a common 
practice 
in 
countries 
controlled 
by 
authoritarian 
governments (see [14] for more details).  
By using the theory of new media communication, the 
aim of this study is to investigate the intensity of ICT 
information usage in the Middle East to better understand 
the communication discourse in the region and their 
mobilization impacts on recent public unrests.  
The rest of paper is organized as follows: Section II 
presents the theoretical basis of the concepts new media 
communication that we are using in our study; Section III 
investigates the efficiency of ICT usage in the Middle East; 
Section IV presents the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) 
of archival data, Section V discusses the findings of 
empirical results, and finally Section VI concludes the 
paper.

II. 
THE THEORY OF NEW MEDIA COMMUNICATION 
Drawing on Manual Castelles’ [15] work The rise of the 
network society, it is argued that the new media has shaped 
today’s social organizations and institutes to a large extent. 
This study applies the theory of new media communication 
[16, 17] to investigate the impact of ICTs on communication 
discourse within in the context of the Middle Eastern 
countries and particularly in Iran.  
A modern networked society consists of organizations, 
individuals and groups in which they engage in 
communication discourse by the means of ICTs. The 
importance of the new technology is rooted in its ability to 
accelerate information dissemination and social interaction 
among individuals and groups [18] in a global search for 
fresh ideas and opportunities. ICT tools and services such as 
the Internet and mobile cell phones have created a new form 
of media called mass self-communication [16], in which the 
traditional one-way, one-to-many media structures (e.g., 
print and broadcast agencies) have transformed into a new 
form of communication which are in nature pluralistic, two-
way and many-to-many communication. There is ample 
evidence that citizens use the new media to effectively and 
efficiently participate in communication discourse and 
political mobilization by challenging the dominant power. 
Within the context of democratic institutes, Lievrouw 
[17] defines the pluralistic nature of new media in two broad 
categories or domains: an institutional aspect and a 
personal/relational aspect. While the institutional aspect of 
information exchange is mediated through the media, 
political, business and cultural structures (see Figure 1), 
coupled with ICTs, the personal/rational domain is a social 
network structure in which individuals and groups are able 
to not only share and disseminate information, but also 
participate in communication discourse.  
As depicted in Figure 1, these two domains interact with 
each other by the means of ICTs. At the crux of this model, 
there exists a flow of information from and between these 
domains in which individuals and groups can effectively 
participate in democratic decision making processes. Such 
participation can impact the institutional arrangement by 
inventing and reinventing social and cultural organizations. 
However this process is influenced by many other 
parameters including, but not limited to the availability and 
accessibility of ICT resources and the capacity of 
individuals and groups in using such tools and services. In 
other words, the capacity of individuals/groups is influenced 
by personal factors such as ICT skills, motivation, social 
intelligence and communicative competencies, as well as 
the social, economic and cultural environments [17].  
In other words, the capacity of individuals and groups in 
using ICTs is directly related to the efficiency of ICT 
information usage which will be discussed later. It is also 
important 
to 
note 
that 
ICT 
is widely used 
for 
communication discourse, in both democratic and non-
democratic countries, despite the fact that in non-democratic 
countries, such as Iran, media is heavily controlled by the 
elites in power.

A. Web2.0 Technology 
O’Reilly [19] defines Web 2.0 as a network platform 
spanning all web-enabled devices by the means of 
delivering software as a continually-updated service through 
consuming, mixing and remixing data from multiple 
sources. Database management as a platform for knowledge 
management is an essential part of the new technology. For 
example, as mentioned by O’Reilly [19] Google is not just a 
collection of software tools, it’s a specialized database, 
without data, the tools are useless; without the software, the 
data is unmanageable ([19], p.20).  In contrast to the non-
interactive top-down approach as seen in Web 1.0 
publishing tool, Web 2.0 offers a new feature called 
participation which is essentially a bottom-up approach 
allowing a two-way communication between the publisher 
and the end users (e.g., blogs) [19, 20]. As such, Web 2.0 
technology arrives with many new features as means of 
interconnected web of services such as blogs, wikis, social 
networking and content sharing websites (e.g., Facebook, 
Twitter and Youtube). These services and applications 
provided citizens the opportunity to participate in 
communication discourse more efficiently and effectively, 
or as noted by [20] the opportunities for citizens’ political 
engagement via “the propagation of political content over 
multiple applications and rich user experiences on political 
websites” ([20], p.19).  Using the new technology made it 
also possible for grassroots broadcasters and journalists to 
document events as they occur and post them on the social 
network sites (broadcast) and blogs, a phenomenon that was 
once the job of professional reporters working for expensive 
professional multinational broadcasters such as TV 
networks.

As discussed above, central to Web 2.0 technology is 
data storage and data sharing characterized by aggregation 
of huge amounts of information [20]. As such, those who 
can successfully mine, refine, and use these services are 
likely to engage in political discourse [20, 21].  In the 
context of this study, the citizen engagement in public 
discourse can be identified through the published articles 
and posted video clips and pictures on blogs and social 
networking and content sharing sites as well as users’ 
comments and views about published documents. However 
these services are also the main target of state filtering and 
censorship as practiced extensively in the Middle East. 
 
III. 
MEASURING ICT EFFICIENCY 
 
ICT tools and services played a vital role in public 
discourse and mobilization in the recent wave of popular 
unrest in the Islamic countries of the Middle East and North 
Africa. While the official media controlled by governments 
were publishing the political and ideological agendas of the 
elites in power, the digital communities were established on 
the Net, particularly around social networking sites such as 
Twitter and Facebook. These communities were actively 
engaged in public discourse by disseminating thoughts, 
opinions and concerns about various socio-political and 
economic matters. Despite heavy filtering and censorship 
mechanisms 
imposed 
on 
Internet 
and 
mobile 
communication channels, many citizens in these countries 
used free anti-filtering tools and utilities available on the 
Net including proxy servers, to successfully bypass the filter 
and connect to other digital communities in the region and 
around the world. The intensity of street demonstrations and 
popular unrest identified as the “Green Movement” of Iran 
and the Arab Spring of the region indicate the vital role of 
the new media in public discourse.   
This study used archival data for eleven Middle Eastern 
countries (Bahrain, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, 
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) to 
investigate the efficiency of ICT information usage in the 
region for the period 1995-2007. Two different analytical 
methods were used for this investigation. 
A. Method I: Regression Analysis 
Based on the theory of new media communication 
discussed earlier, this study takes into account four main 
factors that may influence the level of ICT information 
usage in each country. These factors are the availability of 
ICT network infrastructure (variable networks), the level of 
educational attainment in each country, the level of human 
development index (variable HDI) and the level of 
economic growth as measured by  per capita Gross 
Domestic Product per capita (variable GDPP).  
It is important to note that the above variables are not the 
only factors that may influence the level of ICT information 
usage in each country. There are other factors that may 
directly or indirectly influence the level of information 
usage in each country, including, but not limited to, the 
existing level of democratic institutions, culture and the 
level of infrastructure development (e.g., roads, power 
plants etc.) However, these factors are beyond the scope of 
this study.  
To measure the efficiency of ICT information usage 
(variable infouse) in the Islamic Middle Eastern countries 
the following regression model was considered:

B. Data Collection 
For the purpose of this study four sets of data were 
considered, the first set of data was related to ICT indicators 
such as ICT network infrastructure and ICT information 
usage introduced by ITU-Orbicom [22] and ITU [23].  In its 
2005 and 2007 publications Measuring the Information 
Society, ITU presented some indicators to measure the level 
of ICT expansion and ICT usage for each country on a 
global scale. These indicators shed light on our 
understandings about the pits and falls of ICT development 
in general and its usage in particular through an intensive 
comparative study. This study pooled two main indicators 
namely the networks index and the information usage index 
(infouse) related to eleven Islamic Middle Eastern countries 
from the above sources. While the networks index is 
composed of indices such as main telephone lines, cell 
phones, 
international 
network 
bandwidth 
(kbs 
per 
inhabitants), digital lines and cable TV, as well as the 
number of Internet secure Servers. The infouse index on the 
other hand is a complex variable of two other sets of 
variables, one measuring the information uptake by 
populace of each country and the other measures the 
intensity of such uptakes in form of the number of Internet 
users, the number of personal computers in use as well as 
the intensity of broadband and international telecom traffics 
(incoming and outgoing) among others (see [22, 23] for 
more details). Other data used in this study are related to 
variables such as the level of educational attainment (e.g., 
primary, secondary and tertiary), the level of human 
development index (HDI) and the level of economic growth 
in each country (GDPP). 
Following the previous literature, we assume that the 
level of ICT expansion and the intensity of its usage are 
correlated with the level of economic development in each 
country. ICT tools and services require individuals as well 
as firms and public organizations to have enough economic 
resources to spend on these resources (e.g., PCs, servers, 
laptops, cell phones and the Internet). That is why people 
living in developed countries invest more on ICT tools and 
services than people in the developing countries. Therefore, 
we can expect that there is a positive correlation between 
the presence of communication networks and information 
usage and the level of economic development in each 
country as measured by GDPP. Data related to HDI index 
was collected from UNDP’s database (http://hdr.undp.org)

while GDPP data was mainly obtained from ITU, UNDP 
and the World Bank database [24].  
C. Regresion Results 
The measuring the efficiency of information usage was 
conducted in two separate yet interrelated steps. In the first 
step the standard Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression 
method was applied on equation (1). Table I shows the 
results of regression analysis reported by STATA software 
version 9.1. As shown in Table I there is strong 
relationships between variable information usage (infouse) 
and parameters such as networks, GDPP and education as 
reported by the positive signs of variable coefficients and 
their related t-values and p-values. These impacts are 
statistically significant at 95% level while variable HDI was 
reported as statistically insignificant.

In the second step of our regression approach, we 
obtained the score of each country with regards to their ICT 
efficiencies by using a post estimate equation-level analysis 
of the variance matrix. This process is a pretty standard 
method in which a fitted value of variance matrix is 
estimated in such a way that the sum of the residuals is set 
to zero.

The resultant vector is then used in a second run of 
regression by involving the other two main variables namely 
networks (a reference to ICT network infrastructure) and 
infouse.  
This process is referred to an un-weighted score 
estimation. The results of the second regression are reported 
in Table II. As shown in this table, three countries had the 
highest efficiency scores with regard to their ICT 
information usage: Iran, Lebanon and Bahrain with Iran at 
the lead with an efficiency score of 41 units. 
The next step was to conduct an efficiency analysis, 
using a weighted method for comparison purposes and as a 
means of having a better estimation analysis of the digital 
communities across the region. The method used for this 
purpose is called DEA analysis. 
 
 
 
IV. 
METHOD II: DEA ANALYSIS 
DEA is a deterministic and non-parametric model [25] 
built around the stochastic frontier model [26]. The method 
is used as a means of benchmarking the most efficient 
unit(s) within a particular system.  
The core component of DEA is a unit called the 
Decision Making Unit (DMU). Each DMU represents a 
complete set of recorded observations in which data are 
grouped as units of inputs and outputs.  In other words, 
DEA calculates efficiency of each DMU within a dataset. A 
DMU can represent any type of measurable data, including 
metrics related to educational attainment and ICT data, such 
as the number of Internet users, the number of personal 
computers and/or the number of cell phones and fixed 
telephone lines in use. If DMUs are constructed using a 
simple model (e.g., single input and output) then the 
efficiency of 
i
DMU  is defined by the following simple 
formula:  
/
i
i
i
efficiency
y
x

 
 
(2) 
where 
iy  in equation (2) denotes the output of 
observation i  and 
ix  represents its related input.  
In a more complex situation where, DMUs are defined 
using multiple inputs and outputs, each of which contains 
different weighting metrics, then the efficiency of 
i
DMU  is 
defined as the sum of weighted outputs divided by the sum 
of the weighted inputs as depicted in following equation: 
1

where 
i
  and 
i  denote the weighted values for the 
output variable 
iY  and the input variable 
i
X  respectively. 
As depicted in equation (3), the results of efficiency 
calculation are strongly correlated with the selection of 
input and output weights. This is one of the main issues that 
should be addressed.  In other words, we should answer the 
question of how do we setup values of the weights so that 
the ultimate results do not discriminate the other units to 
favour a particular DMU or several DMUs within a system.

COLLA 2012 : The Second International Conference on Advanced Collaborative Networks, Systems and Applications

DEA solves this problem by estimating the efficiency of 
each DMU through the implementation of a weighting 
mechanism that fits best for each DMU in the system [27]. 
In other words, the system allows the efficiency of each 
DMU to be maximized and then it will benchmark the most 
efficient ones. For the purpose of this empirical analysis the 
same dataset used in Method I was used in Method II. Based 
on countries performances in ICT information use (variable 
infouse) and the existing level of network infrastructure 
(variable networks) development, as depicted in Figure 2, 
four countries Yemen, Iran, Lebanon and Bahrain have been 
placed on the efficiency curve. 
 
 
Figure 2. Descriptive statistics and the efficiency curve 
 
A further investigation of the efficiency scores of 
countries in this study, as shown in Table III, indicates that 
among the Middle Eastern countries of this study, Bahrain 
and Iran had the highest efficiency scores and therefore 
were benchmarked as the most efficient countries in ICT 
information usage.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the DEA frequency analysis indicates that 
both Bahrain and Iran had the highest frequency scores with 
regards to their information usage and networks in 
comparison with other DMUs in the dataset. Lebanon and 
Yemen were placed thereafter. It is important to note that 
the efficiency scores are estimated based on the maximized 
weighted score that fits each country’s performance the best.  
In this context, albeit Yemen has the least developed ICT 
infrastructure, but when it comes to citizens’ usage of 
information the country’s efficiency index scores higher 
than other ICT developed nations such as Kuwait, Qatar and 
UAE.  
 
 
V. 
DISCUSSION ON FINDINGS 
Citizens in counties located on the efficiency curve (see 
Figure 2) namely: Yemen, Iran, Lebanon and Bahrain had 
the highest online presence during the popular unrests in the 
region. This is mainly associated with level of ICT adoption 
among citizens of these countries particularly among the 
younger and educated citizens. Information technology 
adoption is argued as one of the main sources of 
emancipation [11, 16, 28, 29]. The role of social influence 
in technology acceptance has been argued as one of the 
main drives behind citizens’ acceptance of the new 
technology. Individuals engaging in the adoption of new 
technology achieve not only social status gains but also the 
pace of such an adoption is in part a result of individuals’ 
desire in response to the social conditions [29]. Thurman 
[30] argues that the adoption of established news websites in 
expressing their views is driven by social and technological 
conditions in which low cost online content management 
tools helped facilitate a rapid growth in the number of and 
popularity of independently published websites and blogs 
that overlap the space traditionally occupied by the 
mainstream news media.

As such, the digital communities in these countries 
adopted and utilized ICT media effectively for mobilizing 
citizens in political discourse. Millions of pictures, video 
clips, text messages and articles posted on social networking 
sites, blogs and video sharing sites such as YouTube 
document the intensity use of ICTs in these countries in 
particular from Iran, Bahrain and Yemen. 
Despite some differences in results reported by the 
weighted versus un-weighted analysis with regards to the 
efficiency of ICT usage in the Middle East, both methods 
scored Iran, Lebanon and Bahrain as the most ICT efficient 
countries in the region. The differences in reported scores 
(weighted and un-weighted) with regards to Yemen is due to 
the weighting mechanism deployed in DEA to benchmark 
the best performer(s) within the DMU dataset.  In this 
context the un-weighted scoring mechanism used by OLS 
regression is different than the method used by DEA. The 
study of the Iranian digital community as the most efficient 
community in the region warrants a future discussion about 
this community. Despite the fact that the Iranian ICT 
network suffers from advanced technologies such as 
broadband, the Internet users in Iran are utilizing the 
existing bandwidth more efficiently that other countries in 
the region. Poor infrastructure development in Iran is one of 
main barriers to access to the information highway. To 
highlight this according to the 2009 ITU report, in year 
2008 almost 32.5% of the population in Chile were 
connected to the Internet (measured based on the number of 
Internet users per 100 inhabitants) while 8.5% of these users 
were broadband users. In the same year 31.4% of Iranians 
were connected to the Internet, but only a very small 
number of users (0.41%) were connected to the Internet by 
the means of broadband. A comparison between Bahrain 
and Iran also reveals important information with regards to 
the poor ICT development in Iran, while 52% Bahrainis 
were connected to the Internet in year 2008, 14.18% of 
these users were broadband users.  
Despite the underdeveloped infrastructure the digital 
community of Iran has created the largest blogosphere in the 
Middle East. Currently there are over 60,000 active blogs in 
Iran. In addition, the Iranian Facebook users constitute a 
bloc of over nine million users. In addition, on average 
Iranians exchange millions of SMS messages on a daily 
basis. This value increased to a remarkable high number of 
110 million SMS per day during the 2009 presidential 
election in Iran. Many of these messages were politically 
motivated and caused the hardliners to shutdown the entire 
mobile network for a few days starting from June 11, 2009, 
which was the day before the election in Iran [31, 32]. The 
above examples show the intensity of ICT usage in Iran, 
confirming the results of the regression, as well as our DEA 
analysis based on data collected from sources such as ITU, 
The World Bank and UNDP. 
The results of this study indicates also, that, despite 
intensive efforts by the Iranian authorities in filtering 
Internet contents, the digital community of Iran was able to 
bypass the imposed filtering through various methods, 
including the use of proxies, VPN and anti-filtering software 
available on the Net.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
ICTs changed the nature of interaction among 
individuals, civil society, democratic institutes and business 
activities. In particular, many individuals and protest 
movements were organized by utilizing ICTs in their 
campaigns. As we have seen in recent popular unrests in 
Middle East and North Africa, ICTs provide the means for 
building the capacity to participate in democratic discourse, 
and mobilize masses for radical social change in 
constitutional and legal arrangements.  
Since the introduction of Internet in Middle East in 
1995, the digital communities in the region were able to 
effectively use the new technology for not only as a means 
of communication and interaction among people, but also to 
organize social-political events. Despite governmental 
control and filtering the content of Internet including the 
block of blogs, critical websites, Facebook, Twitter and 
email systems, the digital communities in the Middle East 
were able to use advanced anti-filtering tools and software, 
as well as proxies, to bypass the imposed restrictions on the 
Net and participate in discourse with digital societies across 
the globe. By using the theory of new media communication 
coupled with empirical analysis of archival data, this study 
tried to investigate the intensity of ICT information usage in 
the Middle East in order to better understand the nature of 
communication 
discourse 
in 
the 
region 
and 
their 
mobilization impacts on recent public unrests. The results 
showed that citizens who are actively engaged in digital 
communities and use ICT tools and services more 
efficiently are more likely to participate in public discourse 
and mobilization.
