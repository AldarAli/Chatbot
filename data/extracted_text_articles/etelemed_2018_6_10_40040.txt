Abstract— The Croatian Agency for Medicinal Products and 
Medical Devices is in the middle of implementation of project 
“OPeN.” With its completion, the Agency will automate 
capturing of pharmacovigilance data from various clinical 
Information Technology (IT) systems and enable data 
syndication in the Croatian National Adverse Reactions 
database. The mechanism can consequently help healthcare 
professionals to avoid repeated input of data and save their 
time; this way, it will enhance medical practice and improve 
the public health system in Croatia. 
Keywords— Adverse Drug Reactions; Clinical Information 
Technology Systems; National Adverse Reactions Database; 
OPeN; Pharmacovigilance. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices 
(HALMED) [1] is the National Competent Authority (NCA) 
in charge of the regulation of medicinal products and 
medical devices in Croatia. Its post-approval activities 
include 
monitoring 
of 
pharmacovigilance. 
“Pharmacovigilance is the science and activities relating to 
the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of 
adverse effects or any other medicine-related problem.” [2] 
An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is a noxious and 
unintended drug effect [3]. HALMED is responsible for the 
maintenance of the national ADR database. 
Pharmacovigilance (PhV) is principally a data-driven 
discipline. The database contains all ADRs received from 
various sources in Croatia. There were many advances in the 
last decade related to pharmacovigilance in general and ADR 
reporting in a particular degree.  
Although spontaneous reporting is a “valuable resource 
for detecting actual drug-drug interactions” [4], the global 
PhV 
community 
has 
recognised 
the 
problem 
of 
underreporting [5]. That led to taking regulatory actions, as 
reported in European Medicines Agency’s publications [6]–
[8], as well as international guidance [9], further prescribed 
by international specifications [10] [11]. It also led to the use 
of technological innovations like data mining [12] [13] or 
other IT techniques, and finally to conducting standardisation 
efforts in the field [14]–[16]. One way to mitigate the 
problem of underreporting is to get, or to mine, large 
quantities of data [17]. Another and additional way to do it is 
to add relevant [18] input from health professionals into the 
reporting process and to increase the quality of data.  
To enhance its pharmacovigilance capacities, HALMED 
participated in international pharmacovigilance IT projects – 
“Strengthening 
Collaboration 
for 
Operating 
Pharmacovigilance in Europe Joint Action” (SCOPE) and 
“WEB-Recognising Adverse Drug Reactions” (WEB-
RADR). The SCOPE project, a joint action at European 
Union (EU) level, focused on the development of reporting 
mechanisms for ADRs [19]. It resulted in several IT-related 
recommendations 
related 
to 
facilitation 
of 
data 
collection/syndication and processing in various systems. 
Croatia, Netherlands, and United Kingdom developed 
mobile apps for reporting ADRs under WEB-RADR in 2015 
and 2016 [20].  
HALMED gained experience through these international 
projects and initiated a new project called “OPeN.” [24] 
OPeN conformed entirely to the third suggestion of Work 
Package 4 of project SCOPE, namely its recommendation to 
NCAs to “integrate suspected ADR reporting into clinical IT 
systems” [21].  
The goal of the OPeN project was to increase both the 
number and the quality of ADR reports and to facilitate the 
communication between Health Care Professionals (HCPs) 
and NCAs via connected clinical IT systems and national 
ADR databases.  
This paper describes the development of HALMED’s 
OPeN system. In Section II, we describe risks related to the 
OPeN project, as well as project phases and methods of 
system development. In the same section, we describe 
modules of the system and its use. In Section III, we discuss 
why and how certain pharmacovigilance mechanisms were 
included in efforts taken by HALMED during the past 
decade, as well as in the OPeN project itself. We explain the 
advantages of direct reporting and the gist behind 
HALMED’s project. We also outline examples of equivalent 
European projects, selected for study because they use 
mechanisms of direct ADR reporting from clinical systems. 
Despite the fact that they were examined before the 
development of HALMED’s own system, we would 
nevertheless like to highlight some features like integration 
or communication with other systems, as well as coding and 
data mapping abilities. In Section IV, we show expected 
benefits of the OPeN project for Croatian public health 
system. Finally, Section V announces future work on the 
project, adding a goal to further facilitate the Croatian health 
sector.

II. 
METHODS OF THE DEVELOPMENT 
A. Project risks, phases, and the development  
Establishing a system as complex as OPeN involves 
many different institutions and stakeholders (The Ministry 
of Health of the Republic of Croatia, The Croatian Health 
Insurance Fund, The Croatian National Institute of Public 
Health, and providers of IT solutions and services in the 
healthcare domain). The most significant risk in this entire 
process is ensuring the necessary funding, as well as 
coordinating activities of various stakeholders, on time. 
Within the extent of the OPeN project, it was planned to 
connect OPeN with the Central Health Information System 
of the Republic of Croatia (CEZIH) [22], as well as with 
different hospital IT systems. However, this was not yet 
accomplished, and HALMED’s staff is actively working to 
achieve it. A possible risk related to this integration attempt 
could be the circumstance that the operation of CEZIH is 
not within the remits of HALMED (the responsibility lies 
with The Croatian Health Insurance Fund). Another risk is 
related to the fact that there are 64 hospitals in Croatia: they 
have various levels of computerisation and use various IT 
solutions. HALMED has developed the OPeN system to the 
extent that it is functionally ready; however, other Croatian 
main stakeholders need to incorporate it into the national 
healthcare ecosystem. The ideal path would be to enforce 
providers to incorporate ADR reporting elements into their 
clinical software products, but a variety of approaches are 
applicable for solving communication issues between the 
systems. 
The whole software development consists of central 
modules development, establishing the connection of the 
system 
to 
its 
environment, 
and 
specific 
modules 
development (see Figure 1). At the moment, HALMED has 
finished the first phase of system’s development and the 
project is entering the second phase. The first phase dealt 
with the facilitation of HALMED’s internal ADR 
processing and the development of Web reporting form and 
smart PDF form. The result of the first phase is a functional 
Web ADR reporting form and completed OPeN ingest 
functionality. The interface of the OPeN system is user-
friendly and designed to both simplify and decrease the time 
required for the data entry. During the reporting, HCPs can 
select values in fields from various lists of medicinal 
products, institutions, units, and measurements. Users can 
also choose one of the existing templates for new reports.  
 
Phase 1: 
Build HALMED’s 
and reporters’ 
basic modules
Phase 2: 
Exchange data 
with clinical 
systems
Phase 3:
 Upgrade the system 
with inform-and- 
educate function

B. The OPeN system modules, functionalities and use 
HALMED has developed OPeN as a Web-based 
application that consists of a database, a Web interface, and 
Web services for integration with other IT systems (external 
clinical IT systems and other IT systems in HALMED). 
OPeN has been based on the Windows technology and 
developed in .NET Framework, while the data is stored in 
the Microsoft Structured Query Language server database 
(MS SQL). Firewall and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
protocol protect the entire system.  Access 
and 
data 
protection are established through the domain admin 
policies for internal users (Windows Active Directory) and 
the ones for external users. Backup procedures are 
performed regularly. HALMED's goal with this project was 
to automate reporting of adverse drug reactions by the HCPs 
directly via IT systems they use at their workplace. The 
scenario is the following: HCP submits reports and transfers 
them to HALMED, where the staff in charge of this task can 
process them (see Figure 2).

The design of OPeN predicts connecting the system with 
CEZIH (Central Health Information System of the Republic 
of Croatia) and also with all IT systems used by HCPs, like 
hospital systems, general practitioners' IT systems, systems 
in pharmacies, private practices, and some additional 
stakeholders' systems. Most of the data required for 
reporting ADRs are already contained within HCPs’ IT 
systems, so it takes less time to fill out the forms; it 
simplifies the process of sending data to HALMED as well. 
All things considered increase the quality of sent data, 
reduce the possibilities of errors during data entry, and 
prevent the submitting of the incorrect or incomplete forms.  
The Web part of OPeN consists of two modules: the 
module for HALMED’s employees and the module for 
external users (HCPs). Figure 3 shows OPEN’s data entry 
interface (with creation dates and statuses - “Received” or 
“Task accepted”). HALMED’s employees use the system to 
register the received reports, to validate them, to detect 
duplicates, to assign them to assessors, to track their 
processing, and any further steps (e.g., sending them to 
EudraVigilance system [23]). The module for HALMED’s 
employees is also connected to HALMED’s Enterprise 
Content Management System (ECMS) via Web services, 
where all the digital records are stored. These digital records 
are available for reading and editing in the OPeN system 
during the entire process. External users (HCPs) will use the 
system to report adverse drug reactions, having registered 
with the purpose of authentication.  
All institutions that participate in data exchange will use 
the same list of HCP authentication data. This facilitates 
data exchange without the need for additional authentication 
at the moment of sending the data to HALMED. A common 
list will enable data traceability. Data exchanged between 
internal and external systems will be in XML data format. 
XML structures are following E2B-R2 and E2B-R3 formats 
[10] [11]. In the first phase of the project, HALMED has 
developed a smart PDF form which also includes embedded 
lists. The form is available via HALMED Website and 
OPeN system Website, currently in the test phase [24]. 
Anyone can access the form, fill it out and send it via e-
mail. OPeN contains the function of automatic data loading 
from the form into the OPeN database, which eliminates the 
requirement to enter data manually.

III. 
DISCUSSION 
A. Efforts to increase the number and quality of ADRs in 
Croatia during the last decade 
Spontaneous ADR reporting is the keystone of 
pharmacovigilance. A sufficient number of high-quality 
ADR reports are directly correlated to the effectiveness of 
ADR systems' capacity in detecting drug safety issues. ADR 
systems are reliant upon the goodwill of HCPs and patients, 
not only on identifying suspected ADR reports, but also on 
reporting them. ADR reporting schemes are recognised to 
be 
subject 
to 
underreporting 
[25]–[27]. 
Directive 
2010/84/EU, which came into force in 2013, identified the 
issue and stated that NCAs need to encourage and improve 
reporting of ADRs. According to the Article 102 of the 
Directive, NCAs shall “take all appropriate measures to 
encourage 
patients, 
doctors, 
pharmacists 
and 
other 
healthcare professionals to report suspected adverse 
reactions to the national competent authority” [28]. Heads of 
Medicines Agencies (HMA) within their Strategy for 2011-
2015 have further propagated the aim of the Directive [29]. 
HMA aimed to support the strengthening of spontaneous 
ADR 
reporting 
systems, 
indicating 
four 
main 
complementary approaches as a mean to improve ADR 
reporting 
and 
achieve 
a 
more 
robust 
national 
pharmacovigilance system: (1) education, (2) motivation, 
(3) promotion, and (4) facilitation of ADR reporting, all of 
them mainly directed to HCPs and patients. 
Throughout the last decade, HALMED has been 
included in numerous activities to increase the number and 
quality of reported ADRs in Croatia. The number of 
spontaneous ADR reports increased from 856 in 2007 to 
3486 in 2016, bringing Croatia into top ten countries in the 
world per number of ADRs per million inhabitants [30]. 
Education, 
motivation, 
and 
promotion 
have 
been 
extensively used and combined with different ways of 
facilitation of reporting. The facilitation was done by 
introducing novel methods for capturing ADRs: online 
reporting form for patients and mobile app for patients and 
HCPs. On-line reporting form was launched in 2012: by 
2016, 20% of all ADRs were received through this channel. 
Although HALMED intended the on-line reporting form for 
patients, it was widely used by HCPs. The PhV mobile app 
was introduced in 2016 (through project WEB-RADR) and 
it accounted for the 2% of ADR received in 2016. The focus 
was on activities aimed at facilitation of reporting. 
HALMED started introducing electronic reporting and it 
influenced the rationalisation of internal ADR processing. 
The main reason was a reduction of manual entry into the 
national ADR database. This issue gained more importance 
as the increasing number of received ADRs began to have a 
real 
impact 
on 
resources 
available 
to 
other 
pharmacovigilance processes within HALMED (e.g.,

assessments of risk management plans, periodic update 
safety reports).  
B. Direct reporting from clinical systems as advancement 
in the field of pharmacovigilance  
Although regulatory workload in HALMED increased 
substantially from 2013 onwards, there was still an active 
commitment to improving the national PhV system, as well 
as possibilities to detect signals and potential safety issues. 
This was this reason for planning and starting the OPeN 
project. OPeN aims to automate the internal handling of 
reported ADRs and to further increase both the number and 
the quality of ADR reports. The way to do it is by capturing 
ADR reports from online reporting form and clinical 
systems. The idea behind OPeN was to build a system that 
will allow the communication of clinical IT systems and the 
National ADR database. HALMED considers the capturing 
of ADR reports from clinical systems in electronic form to 
be the most challenging part of the project. Direct reporting 
from clinical systems, however, has many advantages. It 
improves reporting efficacy of HCPs by reducing their 
efforts to complete forms as it uses data from patients’ 
records and automates data entry methods. HALMED 
considers it as a way of promotion of ADR reporting in 
general. According to the systematic review and meta-
analysis published by I. Ribeiro-Vaz et al. [31], projects that 
aim to promote ADR reporting by using IT represent an 
increasing trend. According to their aggregate analysis, 
these interventions doubled the number of captured ADR 
reports. 
Reporting from clinical system helps obtain complete 
information on ADRs. It can significantly facilitate case 
assessment by providing context for ADRs. An additional 
value is the possibility to prompt reporters to complete a 
report within the system when specific tasks are completed, 
e.g., drug withdrawal from therapy. It can also prompt a 
reporter to enter data that are more particular into the report 
(e.g., a batch number in case of ADR related to vaccines and 
biologicals). This information is rarely captured in paper 
ADR form; it can, however, be crucial for understanding the 
cause of the ADR.  
An additional benefit of automatic data entry method in 
direct ADR reporting from a clinical system is the use of 
controlled data entry. Where applicable, ADR reporters 
could use data registries (e.g., medicinal product registry) to 
facilitate their data entry method. Another benefit of using 
IT is the option to use data validation rules and to facilitate 
receiving accurate and valid reports. In this way, national 
ADR databases are becoming more accurate too. It reduces 
the need to contact the reporter in case of non-valid ADRs. 
Rules of reporting should meet the applicable ICH E2B 
standards [10] [11] and minimum required data. Additional 
validation rules should also be built in if needed to meet 
business or regulatory needs. Besides, the use of 
dictionaries, including the mapping of dictionaries, should 
help set up standardised terminology and coding terms for 
assessors. The use of dictionaries would represent a 
significant benefit for any pharmacovigilance system. The 
second phase of OPeN will address these issues. 
C. A short comparison of pharmacovigilance systems with 
mechanisms of capturing ADRs from clinical systems 
According to the SCOPE results, there are only 2 NCAs 
that use the possibility of capturing ADRs from clinical 
systems: regulatory agencies from Spain and UK (Agencia 
Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios – 
AEMPS, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency - MHRA) [32] [33]. Their systems are mainly set to 
retrieve ADRs from General Practitioners (GPs), and this 
decision is logical since they have access to most of the 
patients' health information. Although their systems differ, 
their experiences indicate that the integration of ADR 
reporting with electronic health records, primary care, and 
e-prescription systems is positively correlated with the 
increased quantity of ADR reports and the quality of 
information received. In the UK, for example, during the 
pilot phase in 2011, automatic ADR reporting feature was 
added to one primary care system for GPs (SystemOne). 
Analysis of received Yellow Cards showed an increase for 
GP ADR reports of almost 50% compared to 2010. The UK 
and Spanish systems have a similar concept. There are some 
differences between the systems: ADRs received from 
clinical systems in Spain are not automatically uploaded 
into the national database Farmacovigilancia Española, 
Datos de Reacciones Adversas (FEDRA), but have to pass 
through their regional PhV centers. Also, the ADR 
description is in the form of free text, while the UK system 
allows ADRs to be coded using The Systematized 
Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) dictionary [34]. The 
MHRA has built up a mapping between SNOMED concept 
terms and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) [35] which is standard terminology used for 
coding ADRs worldwide. It enables ADR reports to be 
automatically loaded into the MHRA’s PV database without 
the need to code ADRs. OPeN will allow direct upload of 
ADR reports to the national database, however, coding of 
ADRs by the reporter will not be possible.  
HCPs 
in 
Croatia 
use 
International 
Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 
(ICD 10) terminology for coding medical terms [36] and no 
mapping to MedDRA is available. In addition to this, OPeN 
will allow for two-way communication with the reporters, 
mainly for retrieving follow-up information. We believe this 
is the benefit of our system, although no information on the 
communication possibilities within the UK or Spanish 
systems is widely available. There is limited published 
information on the particular data elements of both systems; 
we were able to compare our systems solely by actively 
participating in the SCOPE project. However, the 
information on the systems might be outdated since the 
SCOPE includes data up to 2013. Also, it is challenging to 
detect the publication on the efforts of other countries in 
57

implementing ADR reporting from clinical systems. As per 
our knowledge, Netherlands is piloting such a system. 
Previous research of the systems outlined above helped 
HALMED’s team to avoid straggling in the development, 
implementation, and fine-tuning of the OPeN system. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS AND EXPECTED BENEFITS  
Submissions of timely and well-completed ADR reports 
increase the data available to NCAs and their capacity to 
protect public health in the end. It improves NCAs’ ability 
to detect, identify, investigate, and act on potential drug 
safety issues.  
Pharmacovigilance professionals consider the integration 
of clinical IT systems and ADR databases as bleeding edge 
tool for increasing both the number and the quality of 
captured ADRs. HALMED initiated OPeN for this very 
reason. Croatian NCA started with the initiative that aimed 
for the integration of the national ADR database, CEZIH, 
and various hospitals IT systems. Expected benefits include:  
• 
Facilitation and promotion of ADR reporting, 
• 
A higher number and better quality of reports, 
• 
Reduction of manual data entry and data processing 
time per report, 
• 
Standardisation, clarification of professional terms, 
dictionaries, 
• 
Introduction to analytics, advancement in tracking 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and signals, 
planning for BI features, 
• 
Sophisticated and proactive protection of public 
health. 
V. 
FURTHER WORK 
 
An efficient and connected health system and its 
components facilitate the protection of patients, efforts of 
HCPs, and beneficial activities of all other stakeholders in 
the national health domain. The OPeN system is an excellent 
example of the vital technological element of the national 
health system. Although Web-application OPeN is fully 
functional, HALMED is working on signing the protocol 
with the Croatian National Institute of Public Health to 
enable data exchange between these key health sector 
institutions. The system can become fully operational on a 
national level only after strengthening this cooperation. In 
the meantime, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of 
Croatia inserted activities related to OPeN into one of their 
strategic goals for 2019. Besides, concurrently with the 
signing of data protocol and with preparing for the second 
phase, HALMED is planning the third phase (see Figure 1) 
or system upgrade with the additional module that will cover 
informing and online education of HCPs.
