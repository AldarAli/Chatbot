Abstract- In this paper, a flexible, compact, ultra-low profile 
dual band antenna is presented. The proposed design is 
suitable for wearable and flexible Wireless Body Area 
Network (WBAN) devices geared for tele-health technology. 
The antenna has a 50.8 µm thickness and fed by a Coplanar 
Waveguide (CPW) structure. The proposed design is based on 
a planar monopole and resonates at 2.45 GHz and 5.2 GHz 
which makes it suitable for Wireless Local Area Network 
(WLAN) technologies. Design and analysis of the proposed 
printed monopole antenna have been carried out using the full 
wave simulation software CST Microwave Studio, which is 
based on the Finite Integration Technique (FIT). The proposed 
design has the merits of compactness, light weight, wide 
bandwidth, and high efficiency which suggest that the 
proposed design is a reasonable candidate for integration 
within wearable and flexible telemedicine systems.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The light weight, efficient energy consumption, low 
manufacturing cost, fabrication simplicity, convenience, in 
addition to the abundance of inexpensive synthesized films 
and substrates, make wearable and flexible electronics an 
appealing candidate for the modern electronics market.  
Moreover, recent developments in miniaturized energy 
storage, 
flexible 
photo 
voltaics, 
and 
auto-powered 
electronic components have paved the road for the 
commercial success to such devices [1] [2].  
Wearable electronics, which can be bent, reconfigured, 
and flexed, would substantially expand the applications of 
conventional electronic devices.  
Generally, wearable and flexible electronics would 
often require the integration of antennas operating at 
specific frequency bands to provide wireless connectivity 
which is considered an essential requirement and greatly 
demanded by today’s information oriented consumers [3]. 
Applications of wearable wireless systems include but not 
limited to the fields of personal communication, medical 
devices, warfare, aeronautics, and entertainment [4]-[6]. 
Obviously, the efficiency of flexible wireless systems 
directly relies on the characteristics of the integrated 
antenna unit, which must be light weight, conformal, low 
profile, electrically and physically small, and robust. At the 
same time, these antennas have to exhibit high efficiency 
and good radiation characteristics [7]-[11].  
        On the other hand, Wireless Local Area Network 
(WLAN) is recognized as the most reliable standard for 
short 
range 
wireless 
connectivity. 
The 
continuous 
developments 
in 
WLAN 
technologies 
require 
the 
integration of all IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n standards of the 2.4 
GHz (2400 –2484 MHz), and 5.2 GHz (5150–5350 MHz) 
bands into a single radiating element. In the past decade, a 
plethora of flexible and wearable antenna designs have been 
reported in the literature, which are based on different 
topologies and substrate types. Electro textile based 
antennas seem to be a flexible, low profile solution for 
wearable applications; however, their substrate materials 
are likely to introduce discontinuities [12]. Technically, 
conventional microstrip (patch) antennas are not preferred 
in wearable electronics since the bandwidth is a function of 
the substrate’s thickness. In [13], a flexible inverted-F 
antenna printed on a paper-based film was proposed for 
integration within flexible displays. Although paper based 
substrates are cost effective, they are found to lack 
mechanical robustness when used in applications that 
require high extents of flexing and bending. Moreover, they 
tend to have a high loss factor which compromises the 
efficiency of the antenna. 
        In [14], a wearable and flexible aperture coupled 
antenna is reported. This technique significantly enhances 
the impedance bandwidth, however, it leads to a serious 
increase in the antenna’s overall thickness; moreover, it 
involves a multi-layer fabrication process.  
        In this paper, we propose a Co-Planar Waveguide 
(CPW) fed dual band antenna deposited on a 50.8 μm 
Kapton Polyimide substrate. In addition to its ultra-low

thickness, compactness, and flexibility, the design has a 
more reasonable feed than the abovementioned feeding 
techniques 
since 
it 
offers 
several 
advantageous 
characteristics such as: reduced radiation losses, improved 
impedance bandwidth, and more importantly, lower 
fabrication cost and reduced complexity since both 
radiating element and ground plane are laid on the same 
side of the substrate, which enables roll to roll production 
and a consistent thickness. 
        In Section II, the design of the proposed wearable dual 
band antenna is presented. In Section III, simulation results 
of return loss and radiation patterns of the proposed design 
are discussed. Finally, conclusions are given in Section IV. 
  
II. 
ANTENNA DESIGN 
The topology of planar monopole and dipole antennas 
have received significant attention over other antenna types 
especially 
in 
wearable 
applications. 
For 
WLAN 
technologies, printed monopoles are preferred over other 
antenna topologies due to their relatively large impedance 
bandwidth, low thickness, fabrication simplicity, and omni-
directional radiation pattern, which is highly desired in 
WLAN schemes.  
As shown in Figure 1, the antenna consists of a 
winding branched radiating element fed by a CPW (please 
note that the grey colored area represents the metallization 
of ground plane and the radiating element). This 
miniaturization technique lengthens the current path, which 
consequently gives rise to a lower resonance and in turn 
reduces the structure size without significant degradation to 
the radiation characteristic of the antenna. The antenna 
structure is positioned on a 31 mm 
 34 mm Kapton 
Polyimide substrate with a dielectric constant of 3.4 and a 
loss tangent of 0.002. To feed the radiating element, a CPW 
transmission line, which consists of a central strip with a 
width of 4 mm and a 1 mm gap between the central strip 
and the coplanar ground plane is used. 
To achieve the desired dual-band behavior, U-shaped 
structures, which comprise both horizontal and vertical 
sections are introduced. The introduction of these sections 
is to produce two distinct current paths and thus dual 
resonant modes are enabled. Obviously, the longer arm 
gives rise to the lower resonance while the short arm is 
responsible for the upper resonance. It is worth mentioning 
that a parametric study was conducted to investigate the 
gaps and ground plane size effects on the resonant 
frequencies and return loss of the antenna. As mentioned 
previously, the branched radiating element is fed by a CPW 
feed reduces the fabrication complexity as both the 
radiating element and ground  plane  are  deposited  on  the  
 
 
 
same side of the substrate. The dimensions of the antenna are 
depicted in Table I.

III. RESULTS 
Design and analysis of the proposed printed monopole 
antenna have been carried out using the full wave 
simulation software CST Microwave Studio which is based 
on the Finite Integration Technique (FIT) [18]. 
As can be seen in Figure 2, the simulated return loss 
for the antenna is 22.8 dB at 2.5 GHz, with a -10 dB 
bandwidth of 662 MHz (27%), while the simulated return 
loss is 25 dB at 5.35 GHz with a bandwidth of 2125 MHz 
(40%). The principal planes (E and H) were also obtained 
using CST microwave studio. E-plane (YZ cut) and H-plane 
(XZ cut) far-field radiation patterns for the resonances 
under consideration are depicted in Figure 3.

GHz ((c) and (d)). 
 
 
        It can be seen that the radiation power is omni-
directional at both resonant frequencies. The antenna 
achieved gains of 1.68 dBi and 1.64 dBi at 2.45 GHz and 
5.35 GHz, respectively, which are typical values for omni-
directional antennas. It is worth mentioning that the 
proposed antenna is suitable for low-power applications 
(less than 10 mW), hence, it is not expected to expose the 
user to any significant hyper-thermal effect due to 
electromagnetic radiation, and thus, Specific Absorption 
Rate (SAR) analysis would be redundant in this case [15]- 
[17].

IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the design, and simulation of wearable, 
flexible and compact printed dual band antenna are 
discussed in details. The reported design is based on a 
Kapton Polyimide substrate, which is known for its 
flexibility, mechanical robustness and low dielectric losses. 
Ultra flexibility, compactness, mechanical robustness, along 
with excellent radiation characteristics and efficiency 
suggest that the reported design is a feasible candidate for 
integration within wearable and flexible WBAN systems.
