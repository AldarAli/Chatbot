Abstract— Haptic feedback for handwriting training has been 
extensively studied, but with primary focus on kinematic 
feedback. We provide vibrotactile feedback through a wrist 
worn sleeve to guide the user to recreate unknown patterns 
and study the impact of vibrational duration (1, 2, 3 seconds) 
on pattern scaling. User traces a line at 90° angles, while 
attempting to maintain a constant speed, in the direction of the 
motor activated till a different motor activation is perceived. 
Shape and size are two features of good letter formation. Study 
performed on three subjects showed the ability to utilize four 
vibrotactile motors to guide the hand towards correct shape 
formation with high accuracy (> 95%). The overall size of the 
letter was observed to scale linearly with the vibrational 
duration. Implications for utilizing the vibrational feedback for 
handwriting correction are discussed.

 INTRODUCTION 
Handwriting is an important lifelong skill that can be 
challenging to acquire for children with learning disabilities 
and post-stroke patients with agraphia. Tracing, copying, and 
completing paper worksheets, with the help of corrective 
auditory feedback, remains the common mode of teaching 
this skill. Providing haptic feedback in addition to the audio-
visual format has shown to improve visuo-motor skills (a 
prerequisite to handwriting training) [1]][2], character 
retention [3] and the overall handwriting quality [4]. Several 
haptic guidance methods have been developed for 
handwriting training [1][3][5]-[11], with their suitability 
depending on the complexity of the task. For example, 
partial haptic guidance may be better suited for medium 
complexity letters/handwriting tasks, while disturbance 
haptic guidance for high complexity letters and full haptic 
guidance for the low complexity letters [8]; and combining 
the different haptic guidance methods over the training 
period has been more effective than utilizing either of them 
alone [9]. These systems while benefiting the sighted can 
also provide the visually impaired an accessible means of 
learning to write/sign their name [12][13].   
Owing to its ready availability to the research 
community, Phantom Omni has been the primary platform 
for developing these systems [1][3][5]-[11][13]. Although 
Phantom Omni based handwriting training has shown to be 
effective, it is still not a common training tool in classrooms. 
Their bulk and tethered nature, requiring allocated 
workstations in addition to their cost, might be a hinderance 
in their widescale adaptability. Utilizing similar force 
feedback principles of hand guidance, other ergonomically 
focused stylus systems like RealPen [14] and KATIB [15] 
are currently being developed.  While technologically 
promising, they are not cost-effective options yet. 
Meanwhile, there is growing research in utilizing tactile 
feedback for hand movement guidance [16]-[24]. These 
systems employ inexpensive vibrators/motors to develop 
affordable wearable solutions that could be easily accessible 
to the educators, as well as the research community. We are 
investigating the efficacy of vibrotactile wearable system for 
handwriting training. To this effect, we provide a brief 
overview of the vibrotactile hand guidance methods that 
have been investigated. 
In a large trial study, Matscheko et al. [16] achieved 
higher information transfer rate by placing tactors around the 
wrist vs. placing them in a grid on the dorsal side, while also 
demonstrating a lower impact of distraction load. They 
concluded that wrist worn tactile systems should place 
tactors around the wrist instead of in a grid form. They 
attributed the reduced accuracy (in the latter case) to space 
restriction of placing the grid beneath “the watch face” area 
while meeting the two-point discrimination requirement of 
about 38mm. Most systems have followed this guideline for 
motor placement with the motor type, number, or actuation 
method being the differentiators. 
Sergi et al. [17] used four Direct Current (DC) motors to 
provide tactile feedback on the four quadrants (dorsal, volar, 
radial, ulnar sides) of the wrist for angular directional 
guidance of the entire forearm in performing 2-Degree Of 
Freedom (DOF) tasks and showed an increased accuracy by 
including the tactile feedback in comparison to visual alone. 
Causo et al. [18] utilized 6 vibrating disk motors worn on a 
stationary arm for posture correction of the other arm in a 3D 
space with each axis being assigned to two motors. The user 
is supposed to move their wrist (and then elbow, and later 
forearm) towards the direction of increasing vibration till a 
maximum vibration is felt indicating the correct final 
position. Salazar et al. [19] arranged six vibrational motors at 
equal distances around the wrist circumference for wrist 
guidance in 2D space using phantom sensation illusion 
(produced by simultaneously actuating two adjacent motors 
resulting in a perceived stimulus at their midpoint). Hong et 
al. [20][21] developed different wristbands for angular path 
104

finding/tracing in 2D surface, one with four vibrating disk 
motors placed along four quadrants of the wrist (like Sergi et 
al.) and the second with an additional four motors placed in 
between these, totaling to eight motors around the wrist. 
They found the 4-motor wristband to be faster, more 
accurate and preferred over the 8-motor design. They also 
performed comparative study between activating single 
motor vs. providing illusions by activating two adjacent 
motors and found that participants could non-visually trace 
paths more quickly and accurately using the single motor 
activation design. 
VibroSleeve [22] proposed placement of 16 vibrating 
disk motors on a sleeve worn around the forearm (a row of 
four motors on each forearm quadrant: dorsal, ventral, 
medial and lateral) for arm guidance in 3D Cartesian space. 
In a test where they examined the user’s ability to correctly 
identify the stimulation side (top/bottom/left/right), they 
simultaneously activated all the four motors on that side for 
500ms before requesting participant response resulting in 
100% accuracy. They aimed to study the perceived direction 
of motion using movement illusion generated by the 
sequential stimulation of motors, from the proximal to distal 
end of the forearm for forward motion (or vice versa for 
backward motion). They also utilized Amplitude Modulation 
(AM) where the intensity of the previous motor was reduced 
before the activation of the next motor in the sequence. 
While they found highest directional accuracy (85-90%) and 
subjective ease of interpretation in the AM pattern 
representation method, this was also the only activation 
sequence where they had provided a break (100ms) between 
the activation of successive motors. Hence, it is inconclusive 
whether the increased direction recognition was due to the 
AM pattern or the difference between continuous activation 
vs. with breaks, or even due to the introduction of movement 
illusion.  
StrokeSleeve [23][24] design utilized two sleeves (worn 
on the wrist and biceps respectively), each embedded with 
four eccentric mass motors for hand guidance and movement 
training. The arm motion was tracked, and upon detecting a 
deviation from the desired trajectory, visual and vibratory 
feedback was provided. They found that vibratory feedback 
significantly reduced the angular error in motion during the 
training, especially for simpler tasks. Although they did not 
observe a significant angular error reduction during their 
retention trials, they attributed this to the short training 
period and the meaninglessness of the motions performed 
reducing the intrinsic motivation to memorize the 
trajectories.  
In vibrotactile hand guidance research area, there are 
limited studies in utilizing tactile wearable systems for 
handwriting training. A few exceptions are Morikawa et al. 
[25][26] and Narita et al. [27][28] that utilize wrist worn 
pressure presentation device for calligraphy training. They 
use two levers mounted on the wrist to provide stimulations 
(gentle taps) to correct the user’s hand position along the 
horizontal direction, for self-training. They do not provide 
any vertical direction feedback. 
Towards the goal of developing wearable vibrotactile 
handwriting training system, this study investigates the 
ability to utilize a sleeve for guiding the user towards the 
correct form (shape) and size/scale of different characters. 
Therefore, vibrations are provided at different spatial 
locations on a forearm (representing the direction of desired 
motion), and participants are asked to draw unseen patterns 
on graph paper (with grids) as the only visual guide. 
Appropriate form and size are key features of good letter 
formation [29]. Focusing on the proper sizing of the letters 
(prior to the form) has shown to improve letter form and 
handwriting legibility [30]. Hence, this work aims to study 
the applicability of utilizing a vibrotactile sleeve embedded 
with four motors for presenting the correct form of select 
letters from English, Arabic and Malayalam (a south Indian 
language) that are hidden from the user. We investigate the 
ability of using vibrotactile cues for controlling the size of 
each of these letters. 
This paper demonstrates the preliminary results of 
utilizing tactile feedback for controlling the form and size of 
letters drawn by the user. In Section II, an overview of the 
vibrotactile sleeve is provided, section III lists the scope of 
this study, section IV describes the experimental setup for 
data collection, section V explains the results, and section VI 
concludes with a summary and future work. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
The sleeve and the system architecture being utilized in 
this study has been presented in prior works [31][32] with a 
learn-to-write software that tracks pen movement (based on a 
webcam input) as the user tries to trace a pattern displayed 
on the screen. If the pen deviates from the pattern being 
traced, motors embedded within the sleeve provide 
vibrational feedback guiding the user’s hand in the correct 
direction. Different arrangements of the motors on the sleeve 
were considered and the accuracy of perceived location and 
user response time were investigated to identify the best 
location for motor placement [32]. A summary of the sleeve 
design is provided below for completeness. 
A. Motor placement 
Since four motor wristbands were found to be accurate 
and intuitive for hand guidance in 2D space [21], our 
hardware utilizes four mini vibrating disk motors. Only a 
single motor is activated at a time, thus enabling faster 
response 
by 
reducing 
the 
cognitive 
load/confusion 
introduced by providing illusions [19]. The activated motor 
represents one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right) 
of desired motion. 
Four different arrangements of motor placement on the 
sleeve were considered. Initially, the motors were placed 
around the four quadrants of the wrist (ring configuration) as 
recommended by literature [16]. Since the two-point 
discrimination on the forearm is between 25mm [33] and 
38mm [34], we also performed initial testing by placing the 
four motors in other configurations with spacing of 50mm or 
more.  
In top-arm configuration, two motors were placed on the 
dorsal side of the forearm, one near the wrist/distal region 
and the other 10cm apart on the proximal region, with none 
on the ventral side and in bottom-arm configuration both 
105

were placed on the ventral side with similar spacing as 
previous, with none on the dorsal side.  In spaced-ring 
configuration, one motor was placed near the wrist on the 
dorsal side of the forearm and another one was placed on the 
ventral side near the proximal side of the forearm (10cm 
from the wrist motor). The other two motors were each 
placed on the radial and ulnar side midway between these 
(i.e., 50mm from the wrist).  
Preliminary testing performed on three subjects on the 
ability to identify the activated motor showed an average 
accuracy of 94% using the wrist-ring arrangement and 98% 
using the spaced-ring arrangement. Spacing the motors on 
the same side (dorsal or ventral alone) also gave higher 
average accuracy (96%) but there appeared to be a 
directional bias wherein the down motor was often 
misidentified as the right motor. It was also observed that the 
spaced-ring arrangement had the fastest user response speed 
(average 1.02s, ranging from 0.45s to 1.6s) among the four 
configurations [32]. 
Hence, the spaced-ring arrangement was chosen for our 
sleeve design with a motor embedded on each side of the 
forearm: up motor on the dorsal side near the wrist, down 
motor on the ventral side near the proximal region 10mm 
away from wrist, left motor on the lateral side 5mm away 
from wrist, and right motor on medial side 5mm away from 
wrist. 
B. Motor Control 
Four mini vibrating disk motors by Adafruit (ADA 1201) 
were embedded into a fabric sleeve. The motors are 
controlled using ESP32 microcontroller and two dual DC 
motor drivers (TB6612FNG). Pulse Width Modulated 
(PWM) signal from the ESP32 is used to control the 
intensity of vibrations. In this study, the vibrational intensity 
is kept constant using a square waveform (50% duty cycle) 
at 250Hz frequency. The ESP32 is powered using a 3.7V 
500mAh Lithium-ion battery. 
III. 
SCOPE 
This study evaluates the feasibility of utilizing the tactile 
sleeve for handwriting intervention, with the eventual goal of 
providing a corrective feedback to their hand in case they 
deviate from the alphabet/pattern they are trying to 
trace/draw. Hence, it investigates the following:  
a) will the user be able to respond to a vibration and 
correct their hand movement in the desired direction, 
while they are attempting to draw a pattern? 
b) can the user’s hand move a consistent distance for 
identical vibrational cues (same vibrational intensity for 
the same time)? 
The response of a user in drawing a pattern projected on 
their arm via the tactile sleeve, was tested to understand the 
accuracy, scalability, and variability in the drawn pattern as a 
function of tactile duration. 
The study uses a wrist worn sleeve embedded with four 
mini vibrating disk motors, with a single motor being 
activated in the desired direction of movement (up, down, 
left, or right), thus providing 90° directional cues only. The 
vibrotactile sleeve was used to guide participants through 
blind patterns of low, medium, and high complexity, grouped 
based on the number of directional changes required to 
complete the pattern. 
It was hypothesized that the participants will be able to 
identify the vibrational direction provided by the sleeve and 
trace these blind patterns with high accuracy. Also, another 
hypothesis was that the size of the patterns drawn will scale 
with the duration of vibration. Finally, it was hypothesized 
that shorter vibrational durations (< 3 seconds) will show 
higher variability in the pattern size, due to a significant 
portion of the duration (approx. 1 second) being used for 
comprehending the direction to be moved in. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
Due to COVID-19 restrictions on large scale human 
subject testing, this pilot study performed initial data 
collection on three healthy adult volunteers, with no prior 
experience of using wearable haptics. All the participants 
were right-handed and wore the sleeve on the dominant 
forearm (Figure 1). 
 
 
 
Figure 1. (a) Sleeve embedded with the four motors in the spaced-ring 
arrangement. (b) Sleeve worn by one of the participants. 
 
Data was collected to test the accuracy of the (a) 
perceived location, (b) pattern formation (shape), and (c) 
pattern sizing (scaling) based on the vibrational duration 
provided. Prior to the data collection, each subject was given 
5 minutes to self-train by activating a desired motor on the 
sleeve using directional keys on a keyboard. The testing was 
performed as described below. 
A. Training 
The participants were asked to use a pen and draw 
straight lines in the direction of the activated motor on a 
graph paper (with 0.5cm x 0.5cm grids). They were provided 
a pattern, corresponding to English letter f for training.  
The letter f was converted into square font such that it 
required the following pen movements to draw: 2cm towards 
right, 4cm up, 3cm right, 3 cm left, 2cm down, 1cm left and 
2 cm right as shown (Figure 2). Each 1cm distance expected 
to be traced was encoded into 1s of continuous motor 
vibration in that direction, when presented using the sleeve. 
Continuous movement in one direction is considered one 
segment. Hence, the letter f consisted of 7 segments. The 
change from one segment to next is also continuous, i.e., as 
soon as the first 2s of vibration on the right motor are 
completed, the up motor starts vibrating and the participant 
has no prior information that the vibration location is about 
to change.

Initially, the participants were provided a graph paper 
and asked to draw the pattern based on straight movements 
in the direction of vibration perceived. Then, they were 
provided the graph paper with the letter f already drawn to 
the expected size/scale. They practiced tracing on this letter 
multiple (3-4) times while receiving the vibrations 
corresponding to the pattern through the sleeve.  
 
Figure 2. Letter f in square font showing the 7 segments to be drawn in the 
order numbered. Each grid is 0.5cm and each 1cm distance is encoded using 
a 1s vibrational duration/movement in that direction. 
B. Blind Pattern Drawing 
Five patterns, corresponding to English cursive letter (a), 
Arabic letters (s, f) and Malayalam letters (a, sh), converted 
into square font were randomly projected to the participant’s 
arm through the activation of corresponding motor. Based on 
the number of directional changes (segments) required to 
complete the pattern, the patterns were grouped as low, 
medium, or high complexity. 
English letter a was broken into 9 segments (medium 
complexity) of equal lengths in the following direction: right, 
up, right, left, down, right, up, down, right (Figure 3. a). The 
Arabic letter s had 9 segments (medium complexity) and 
letter f had only 6 segments (low complexity). High 
complexity Malayalam letters sh had 12 segments and a had 
16 segments. 
The shortest length (1cm) was encoded into 1s of 
continuous motor vibration in that direction. The low and 
medium complexity letters were presented at three scales: at 
1s, 2s, and 3s. i.e., the same pattern was presented with 2x 
and 3x the duration of vibration per 1cm distance, to evaluate 
how the same pattern would be scaled by the participants 
based on modulating the vibrational duration. To avoid 
fatigue, the high complexity letters were only presented once 
to the participant at 1s scale.

participants knew to read Arabic or Malayalam alphabets 
and no feedback was provided (during or after any trial) on 
whether the pattern was correctly drawn or not. Blind 
patterns were provided so that the subject’s ability to identify 
the vibrational location and respond to changes in the 
vibrational direction while performing the task of tracing a 
pattern could be isolated from their ability to trace 
known/seen patterns. They were asked to try and maintain 
their speed of drawing but were not provided any cues 
during (or after) the trials to modify their speed. They were 
provided 2-3 minute break between each pattern. 
V. 
PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
The data was collected from three participants. Each of 
them drew 11 blind patterns (3 scales of 3 low/medium 
complex letters and 1 scale of 2 high complex letters) 
corresponding to 100 segments/directional changes per 
participant. This data was analyzed for the accuracy, 
scalability, and variability of drawn patterns as a function of 
the vibrational duration. 
A. Pattern Shape 
The participants were able to replicate the shape of the 
unknown pattern with a high accuracy. Pattern accuracy was 
measured as the movement in the correct direction for a 
given segment with respect to the direction presented by the 
activated motor. The participants drew the blind patterns 
with an average accuracy of 95.67% (individual accuracy of 
96%, 95% and 96% per subject). This corroborates the initial 
measurements made on perceived location accuracy and 
demonstrates that subjects can distinguish and move in the 
direction of the vibration even while drawing patterns.  
The error was either due to the subject drawing a 
segment 
in 
the 
wrong 
direction 
or 
missing 
a 
segment/directional change completely and continuing in the 
same direction. Missed segments: Two subjects missed one 
segment while the third subject missed two segments. Each 
of the missed segments were the shortest 1cm segments, 
though not from the same pattern and not for the same time 
duration. 
B. Pattern Size and Scalability 
To determine whether the participants could maintain a 
steady size for the segments with same vibrational duration, 
and how the sizing of segments with longer duration scaled – 
length of each of the 100 segments were measured. The 
segment length/size (in cm) vs. continuous tactile duration, 
cumulative for all the subjects, is shown in Figure 4.  
As seen from the Figure 4, the size of the segments 
drawn by the subjects increases linearly with the increase in 
tactile duration. That is, the size of the patterns can be scaled 
linearly as a function of the tactile duration. Hence, once 
trained on a pattern, the user can be expected to move their 
arm relatively steadily for the same intensity of vibration. 
It should be noted that the participants in this study were 
not aware of how long any of the segments were (or how 
long the vibration would be felt in that direction) and when a 
new segment (or change in direction) would occur. Thus, 
they could not have predicted the segment length to be 
drawn.

continuous vibrational stimulation. 
C. Variability in Pattern Size 
Since the initial user response time had an average of 1s, 
it was hypothesized that it might be difficult to maintain a 
steady size for the shorter segments, due to the cognitive 
load of decoding the direction. However, in contrast to the 
assumption, as observed in Figure 4 and Table 1, the 
standard deviation in the drawn size for smaller segments is 
very low and increases as the segment length increases. 
Thus, as the tactile duration is increased, the error in size 
increases. Although the pattern scales almost linearly with 
tactile duration, the high variability for larger lengths 
indicates that when the vibrations provided continuously for 
a longer duration, it becomes more difficult to maintain the 
steady speed.  
Breaking down the larger lengths into multiple shorter 
durations might provide a more controlled size. Considering 
the broken segments are independent of each other, the 
variance sum law (1) provides that the individual variances 
can be added together to determine the total variance for that 
segment. For example, the 12cm distance covered using 12s 
continuous vibrations results in a variance of 10.25cm2. 
Breaking the 12s continuous vibrations into six shorter 2s 
continuous vibrations (σ22cm = 0.062cm2) with breaks in 
between would result in total variance of six times σ22cm (2). 
Hence, reducing the overall variance to 0.36cm2 in the 12cm 
length.  
σ2x+y = σ2x + σ2y

where σ2x  is the variance of segment with length x, σ2N.x  
the variance of segment with length N times x, and N is the 
number of segments the total length is broken into.  
The low variability for shorter lengths (< 5 cm) indicates 
the feasibility of utilizing continuous tactile durations for 
correcting handwriting movements that are expected to be 
within the short lengths. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
There is limited research on utilizing tactile feedback for 
handwriting training. This study shows the feasibility of 
utilizing a tactile sleeve to control the shape and size of blind 
patterns presented to the hand. A wrist worn sleeve 
embedded with four vibrating motors was utilized to guide 
the hand of three subjects. The subjects were asked to draw 
patterns, unknown to them, using the tactile feedback from 
the sleeve alone and were able to reproduce the patterns with 
high accuracy.  
The impact of continuous vibrations on the sizing of the 
drawn segments was evaluated. It was observed that the 
segment lengths can be scaled linearly using vibrational 
durations. It is proposed that shorter segments, of less than 
5cm, be provided using continuous vibrations. However, if 
longer segments need to be drawn, they can be broken into 
multiple small segments represented using continuous 
vibrations of less than 5s with a short break (eg. 100ms) 
between the segments. In handwriting training, the size of 
lines/segments drawn is usually less than 5cm and hence 
continuous vibrations of different time duration might be 
sufficient to provide the necessary scaling of the 
letter/pattern.  
Currently, work is in progress to test this sleeve on a 
larger number of participants. The ability of subjects to draw 
more complex patterns using phantom sensations is also 
being explored. Future work includes testing this system on 
individuals with visuo-motor skills issues and/or handwriting 
learning disabilities. Furthermore, the impact of modulating 
the vibrational intensity on the handwriting patterns is yet to 
be studied.
