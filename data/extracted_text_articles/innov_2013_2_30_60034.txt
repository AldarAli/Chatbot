Abstract-In Wireless Sensor Networks, several protocols and 
algorithms seek to prolong the network lifetime; among them, 
the localization algorithms are used as an accessory to provide 
the smallest distances for sending messages. This paper 
compares the Lateration, KNN and ANN as localization 
techniques to estimate planar coordinates using the RSSI in an 
indoor environment using a real WSN based on IRIS motes. 
The results show that a well worked out ANN is superior to 
Lateration and KNN.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Wireless Sensors Networks (WSNs) have many 
applications in various segments of society, including areas 
such as military surveillance, industrial and agricultural 
monitoring and residential automation [1]. They operate with 
low-power consumption devices, low hardware processing, 
and higher autonomy [2]. 
There are various protocols, algorithms and techniques in 
which the objective is to extend the network lifetime as 
security systems [1][2], data fusion [3], tracking [4], etc. 
Several metrics are approached to improve network routing 
accuracy considering reducing energy consumption. The 
sensor node localization in WSN is noteworthy as one of the 
more effective metrics to reduce energy consumption, since 
the longer the distance the greater the energy consumed by a 
node for routing information. 
GPS (Global Positioning System) usage is a very popular 
method when it comes to sensors localization. However, it 
has some disadvantages in WSN, such as the use of up to 
four satellite signals to achieve a good localization, the need 
of high power consumption due to the receiving of satellite 
signals communication and the high cost of using a GPS in 
each sensor node [3]. Leaving this method aside, other 
alternative techniques are able to compose a WSN 
localization system [4]. 
Some well-known localization techniques are Lateration, 
Nearest Neighbor (NN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Min-
Max [4], ANN [5], Kalman Filter [6], Time of Arrival 
(TOA) [3], Time Frequency of Arrival (TFOA) [7] and 
Least-Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) [8]. 
The Lateration, Min-Max, KNN and ANN is a set of 
techniques that use the Received Signal Strength Indicator 
(RSSI) for estimating node localization in WSN. It is a 
measure of the signal power on the radio link while a 
message is being received. Thus, the power of RSSI is 
inversely proportional to the distance (1). 
Featuring the RSSI, it is possible to: 
 
Calculate in matrix the location of each point 
(Lateration), 
 
Estimate the coordinates as weights in the 
arithmetic average of its nearest neighbors (KNN), 
 
Insert inputs in an Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN) or, 
 
Obtain the geographical location of a network node 
using other techniques and filters. 
This paper presents an experimental evaluation that 
compares the following techniques: Lateration [9], KNN 
[10] and ANN designed for localization. All the experiments 
were performed based on a set of RSSI collected and applied 
to localization techniques in the study in a real environment. 
The paper is divided into seven sections including this 
introduction. In Section 2, a survey of related work is 
performed, showing localization techniques without the use 
of GPS, using the RSSI as a metric for estimating planar 
coordinates. In Section 3, the methodology presenting the 
test environment, hardware and software is discussed, and a 
brief introduction about the Lateration, KNN and ANN 
techniques is given. Section 4 presents the benchmark results 
of  comparing the Lateration, KNN and ANN techniques. 
Later, in Section 5, we present our final remarks, followed 
by our suggestions for future work in Section 6.

RELATED WORKS 
This 
section 
introduces 
some 
researches 
about 
performance evaluations of WSN, highlighting comparisons 
between the localization techniques. 
Priwgharm and Chemtanomwong [4] performed a 
comparative study of the Lateration, Min-Max, NN and 
KNN techniques in an experimental indoor environment 
measuring 3x3 meters using XBee modules. The article 
shows Lateration as the technique with a smaller margin of 
error than the KNN technique.

Rice and Harle [11] compared the localization algorithms 
Non-Linear 
Regression 
(NLR), 
Iterative 
Non-Linear 
Regression (INLR), Least Squares (LS), Random Sample 
Consensus (RANSAC) and Trilaterate on Minima (ToM) is 
shown. Data were collected from real environments in an 
area of 550 m2. The radios use Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) 
(IEEE 802.15.4a) in their physical layer for transmitting and 
receiving 
signals. 
The 
INLR 
(Iterative 
Non-Linear 
Regression) technique gives the smallest number of estimate 
of location errors. 
Shareef et al.  [12] made a comparative work in a real 
environment is performed among several ANN based on 
methods such as Radial Basis Function (RBF), Multi-Layer 
Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), 
Position-Velocity (PV), Position Velocity Acceleration 
(PVA) and Reduced Radial Basis Function (RRBF). These 
methods evaluate the location errors in centimeters using 
these techniques in a 3x3 meters indoor environment. 
However, they do not compare the performance between 
some of the ANN methods with the common localization 
methods applied in a real environment; their results do not 
show a benchmark among the solutions. 
Tian and Xu [13] performed in a real environment a 
comparison between a Multi-Layered Perceptron Neural 
Network (MLPNN) model and two Kalman Filter models, 
namely PV and PVA techniques. The environment measures 
3x3 meters, marked in grid spacing of 0.30 meters with four 
beacon nodes located in the vertices of a square. The mobile 
nodes were placed on each intersection of the grid to collect 
the data. The experimental results indicate that the MLPNN 
neural network has the best performance, but there is a 
potential retraining or redesign cost associated with the use 
of MLP, which is not associated with the Kalman’s ﬁlter 
[13]. This work only compares Kalman’s filter with 
MLPNN, not with tests performed using mathematical 
techniques. 
Rahman et al. [14] made a simulation is performed in an 
environment measuring 200x200 meters, where they 
implement 
an 
ANN 
with 
the 
Levenberg-Marquardt 
algorithm [14] using an error minimization function. The 
simulation shows that the location accuracy improves with 
the increase of grid sensors density and Access Points (APs). 
The work is restricted to simulation and does not present the 
benchmark among the techniques analyzed, disadvantaging a 
clearer comparative preview. 
Langendoen and Reijers [15] simulated Lateration and 
Min-Max algorithms together with the sum of the distances, 
DV-Hop and Euclidean algorithms. They perform only 
simulation and it is described as an ideal environment, 
without discussing the effect of path loss or variable 
depending on the Lateration. 
Zheng and Dehghani [16] made a new ANN method 
known as Location Neural Network Ensembles (LNNE) is 
compared with DV-Hop and a Localization Signal Neural 
Network (LSNN). The experimental results demonstrate that 
LNNE consistently outperforms the other three algorithms in 
localization accuracy. This work employs a simple scenario 
controlled by simulation, but it does not perform a validation 
of the theoretical aspects in real environments. 
Maheshwari and Kemp [17] compared three methods of 
localization, namely Optimal Multi-Lateration (OML), Sub-
optimal Blind Trilateration (SBT) and Geometric Dilution of 
Precision (GDOP). They provide the benchmark in terms of 
achievable accuracy. However, they only compare the 
performance among Lateration variants and not techniques 
of a different nature, and their approach only uses simulation 
without conducting any real experiment. 
According to an analysis of related work, many of the 
studies involve the use of Lateration or some of its aspects 
[4][11][15][17], 
while 
other 
studies 
[12][13][14][16] 
compare the various topologies of ANNs. An experimental 
approach is presented in [4], in which Lateration shows the 
best results compared with three other techniques (KNN, NN 
and Min-Max). Based on the results presented in the above 
references, this paper conducts a performance evaluation 
using the two best methods presented in [4] (Lateration and 
KNN) to compare with ANN. 
Since most of the current works are restricted to the use 
of simulation, and experimental works are much scarcer, the 
main contribution of this paper consists in establishing a 
practical comparison between some common classification 
techniques employed to use locating sensors in real 
environments.

METHODOLOGY 
This section presents the methodology to acquire the data 
and characteristics from the environment of the experiment, 
besides the approach to determine the architecture of the 
artificial neural network used in this research. 
 
A. Environment 
The tests were conducted in an indoor environment grid 
of 12x12 meters, as seen in Fig 1. The beacon nodes (red) are 
positioned in the corners of the scenario, points (0, 0), (0, 
12), (12, 0) and (12, 12), and the nodes to be localized (blue) 
are positioned in the internal area of the grid.

This area is configured in an indoor environment free of 
obstacles or barriers that may degrade the radio signal 
propagation. 
B. Hardware 
For real tests, this research uses the IRIS motes of 
MEMSIC, which implement the IEEE 802.15.4 radio 
standard in the range of 2.4 to 2.48 GHz and a maximum 
data rate of 250 kbps. This hardware can transmit data at a 
distance of up to 500 meters in direct view. The IRIS 
hardware is based on XM2110CB radio and ATmega1281 
CPU, both from ATMEL. To support the WSN node 
gateway, a MIB520 is used, which consists of a USB adapter 
that enables two serial communications, one for control and 
one for data. 
C. Middleware 
We used the TinyOS platform as a software component 
running on the sensor nodes. This is an operating system 
with open source BSD license devices designed for low 
power consumption such as WSN, ubiquitous computing, 
personal networks, home automation and industrial [18].  
A Java-based RSSI application was developed to extract 
the data in real time. The data are recorded in a file with the 
following fields: actual location, node identifier and the 
RSSI value obtained by target node. 
D. Lateration Algorithm for Localization 
A target node receives a message from each beacon node, 
in which it can get the value of the power in dBm from the 
signal, as shown in (1), or as a function of distance (in 
meters) according to (2). 
 
    [   ]                       (1) 
     
      
      
 
 (2) 
The values of A (1 meter RSSI distance) and n (path loss) 
are estimated before testing localization, thereby obtaining 
the value of the distance in meters from the anchor nodes to 
the target node. For each message received by an anchor 
node, the distance di is determined from the (3).

where x and y are coordinate values related to the target, xi 
and yi are coordinate values related to the i-th beacon node, 
and d is the distance between the target and the i-th beacon 
node. 
For each i visible anchor nodes, there will be one 
distance and one equation as a function of x and y 
coordinates. They can be summarized in matrix form as 
shown in (4). B is the estimated localization vector from 
coordinates x and y. Equations (4) – (7) are found in [4].

E. KNN Algorithm for Localization 
KNN is one of the most popular methods of classification 
due to its simplicity and reasonable effectiveness. It requires 
the assembling of a specific model and has shown good 
performance for the classification of various types of data 
[19]. 
As shown in (1), the RSSI is inversely proportional to the 
distance. To calculate the distance, we use the largest RSSI 
values that correspond to the closest nodes. Subsequently, 
we calculate the weighted average to estimate the values of 
x and y coordinates from the target node, as shown in (8).

where x and y are the coordinate values of the target node, 
RSSIi is the power value of the received signal from the i-th 
node, xi and yi are fixed coordinate values of the i-th node, k 
is the limit number of neighboring nodes. Then, the weighted 
average is calculated to estimate the values of the x and y 
coordinates of the target node. 
F. Artificial Neural Network 
Our application of ANN used for the localization of 
nodes in WSN is accomplished through the acquisition of 
RSSI from the messages sent from each node. Subsequently, 
these data are used to train and validate the network. 
For each location point, the mean and standard deviation 
are calculated to identify the 10% worst samples. With this, 
only accurate samples are used to train the ANN. 
To train the ANN, the collected points (x, y) are 
normalized maintaining those data output values between 0 
and 1. 
To define the architecture of the ANN, several tests are 
done to achieve a satisfactory configuration of the ANN, 
i.e., number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each 
layer, activation function for each layer or neuron and 
training algorithm.

The architecture used in the ANN is a feed-forward 
network with five layers: the input layer with 4 neurons 
(RSSI values of each beacon nodes), three hidden layers 
with 10 neurons in each and the output layer with two 
neurons (x and y). The learn rate used is 0.7. The parameters 
of the ANN are summarized in  Table 1.

RESULTS  
The absolute values of positioning errors in the 
coordinates x (xerror), y (yerror) and the Localization error (le) 
are used as a metric for comparing the techniques. The 
position error is the distance between the actual point and 
the estimated value as shown in equations (9), (10) and (11), 
respectively.

To compare the results between Lateration, KNN and

generate the graphs of the benchmark shown in Figs. 3 and

In Fig. 2, we can observe the comparison between ANN 
and Lateration, in percentage, where positive values indicate 
that ANN has better results than Lateration. Similarly, Fig. 3 
shows a comparison between ANN and KNN. To illustrate 
these graphs, only 50 points were selected from a total of 
255 used to estimate the localization (blue points in Fig. 1). 
Negative values occur whenever the ANN technique does 
not yield better results in the comparison. 
The ANN achieved better results in the localization with 
average 232.43% better than Lateration and 470.45% better 
than KNN. Table 2 shows the percentage of cases in which 
each technique has the best performance for the 
aforementioned metrics. 
The x and y values were estimated to apply filters in 
future works that allow reducing the error estimated by a 
coordinated reducing of the distance error. 
The data in Table 2 show that ANN obtains 76.0784% 
and 79.6078% of the best samples in the x and y 
coordinates, respectively, when compared to Lateration. In 
the comparison of KNN and ANN, Table 2 shows that 
85.8824% and 88.6275% of samples have better results for x 
and y coordinates, respectively. Therefore, the ANN shows 
better results when compared with Lateration and KNN.

When we consider the distance of the estimated 
localization and real localization, ANN has better results 
than Lateration and KNN, i.e., the ANN estimates the 
localization near the real localization in 94.902% compared 
to Lateration and 98.0392% compared to KNN. 
Table 3 shows the average (Avg) and variance (Var) of

In Table 4, samples are organized by zones of error. For 
errors which are smaller than 1 meter, the ANN shows the 
best results with a large advantage because 48.62% of the 
estimated positions’ locations are within the lower zone of 
error, i.e., error < 1 meter. 
Figs. 4 and 5 show some samples of estimated locations. 
Each real point is illustrated by a square connected to its 
three estimates by a dashed line. 
Fig. 4 shows samples located in the periphery of the 
scenario. With this figure, we can observe the behavior of 
these techniques near the borders. Fig. 5 shows the internal 
points situated in the innermost region of the experiment.

To compare the localization techniques presented here, 
we estimate the size of the accumulated error indicating how 
each technique deviated from the actual value for each 
record as illustrated in Fig. 6. 
 
 
Fig. 6  Size of accumulated error (m) 
 
Fig. 6 shows the near-linear behavior resulting from the 
accumulation of error over the samples. The final 
accumulated error of Lateration and KNN is 225.05% and 
383.61% greater than the final accumulated error observed in 
ANN, respectively. 
V. 
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The application of a neural network to resolve the 
localization problem shows satisfactory results in the 
estimation of a node within the limits of the beacon nodes. 
This method had lower mean and error variance when

compared to the techniques of Lateration and KNN, 
therefore having increased stability. However, the number 
of inputs is fixed and directly related to the number of 
beacon nodes, resulting in the need to retrain for different 
amounts of network beacon nodes. 
The Lateration is a technique for easy adjustment, 
depending on the number of beacon nodes maintaining 
stability similar to ANN. This technique requires an 
accuracy of the path loss of the environment and the value 
of the constant A, otherwise, the error can be increased and 
may exceed the expected limits.  
In this experiment, the KNN technique was performed 
by the weighted sum of each coordinate by dividing the sum 
of their weights. In KNN, the estimated location tends to be 
found within the boundaries of the scenario, due to the 
weighted sum of RSSIs from their neighbors.  
In [4], the performance evaluation indicates the 
Lateration technique has better precision, followed by KNN. 
In this study, both techniques were compared to ANN for 
localization. We observed that ANN had lower error and, 
consequently, better precision in locating the target node, as 
show in the analysis of the mean and variance of the error 
for both x and y coordinates and localization error, creating 
good reliability in the use of ANN compared to classical 
techniques for locating wireless sensor networks. 
VI. 
FUTURE WORK 
As future work, we intend to perform the target tracking 
in real time by applying this current artificial neural network 
to perform this task, test for different amounts of beacon 
nodes and test these techniques with other hardware, and 
apply filters to minimize error for coordinate and distance.
