Abstract—The technological development of the blockchain 
technology allows a new way of processing secured transactions 
and payments between different parties. Therefore, it is not 
surprising that new virtual currencies are developed to open 
new payment methods, as well as investment opportunities. To 
estimate the intention to buy and use cryptocurrencies, an 
empirical analysis was performed. The question of research is 
whether an investment in cryptocurrencies is primarily made 
for speculative reasons or because of a belief in the 
establishment of a digital currency. The ordinary regression 
analyses on base of survey data, which was distributed online, 
outlines that the intention to use cryptocurrencies is mainly 
driven by investment purposes.

INTRODUCTION 
Cryptocurrencies have achieved market capitalization of 
currently around 250 billion euros due to the strong growth 
in recent years [1]. On the one hand, investors see 
cryptocurrencies as an opportunity to reach high revenues 
accompanied with a specific (potentially high) risk, while on 
the other hand, researchers and experts see cryptocurrencies 
as opportunity to create a new known and general accepted 
currency and payment method [2][3]. Therefore, it will be 
analyzed what most private customers/users think about 
cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) and how 
cryptocurrencies are used. To estimate the described 
customer behavior, a quantitative research using an online 
survey is applied. The resulting database will be analyzed 
using statistical techniques for data estimation and the 
statistical program Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
(SPSS), which targets on the estimation of results about the 
later described hypotheses.   
In this respect, the paper is structured as follows. In 
Section II, (a) cryptocurrencies, (b) blockchain, (c) digital 
versus traditional currencies, (d) challenges, as well as (e) the 
used research model will be described. Following this 
section, the methodology and the theoretical approach for 
carrying out the analysis, will be explained. In Section IV, the 
results of the empirical analysis are presented. The paper 
concludes with a summary of the results in Section V. 
II. 
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND 
The following background section covers the definition of 
the research objectives cryptocurrencies and blockchain as 
well as the used research and conceptual model as well as the 
challenges in the named research field.   
A. Cryptocurrencies 
Although the first ideas to develop a digital and 
anonymous currency date back to 1989 [4], the first virtual 
cryptocurrency was implemented in 2008 [5], when 
Nakamoto published an approach for an electronic payment 
system and a new currency "Bitcoin" based on blockchain 
technology [6]. This approach differed from earlier 
approaches in particular in that all transfers must be validated 
by the community. This validation was performed decentral 
using a synchronized blockchain across multiple users [7]. To 
this extent, no third party is required as an intermediary to 
carry out secured transaction. This means that the currency 
Bitcoin was created primarily with the intention that 
transmissions can be cryptographically secured and tracked 
[5][8]. In addition, cryptocurrencies based on blockchain 
technology are implemented to (a) guarantee fast worldwide 
money transfers, (b) establish the privacy of the participating 
parties through anonymity, and (c) advance the development 
of a payment system independent of the traditional banking 
system [3]. 
B. Blockchain 
Following Nakamoto [5], a blockchain is a continuously 
expandable list of data records, called "blocks", which are 
linked together by cryptographic methods. Each block 
typically contains a cryptographically secure hash of the 
previous block, a timestamp and transaction data [9]-[11]. 
The blockchain allows the linking of transfers within a 
decentralized platform, which is distributed and publicly 
assessable [12][13], where through recording of transfers, 
processes and information are secured by cryptographic 
techniques [10][14][15]. The fact that a large number of users 
of the blockchain can access and track the linked blocks 
within the blockchain creates confidence in the reliability of 
the 
digitally 
applied 
processes 
and 
transfers 
[7][10][11][13][15]. Finally, blockchain provides a solution 
for a trusted, secure, decentralized and (by consensus) peer-

validated approach [16]. In general, the entire database is 
embedded in a peer-to-peer network architecture with equal 
nodes. Due to the node principle, the system is not dependent 
on a central location, which could be a single point of failure 
[3]. 
Since, the information and data are implemented in the 
blockchain, 
which 
is 
decentralized 
distributed, 
no 
information can get lost [13]. Any implemented block is 
irreversibly linked to a previously block and cannot be 
deleted. Each block contains information about transactions 
and information of the previous block [5]. A new block is 
only added in case the verification through the validation and 
consensus process by the community is done [17]. Any 
update needs to be performed in a new developed block, 
which needs to be verified by the described process [18]. 
The application of blockchains guarantees a technically 
secure communication on the base of mutual authentication, 
as well as tamper-resistant asymmetric cryptography, which 
enables an information exchange by timestamped and logged 
records [7][12][19][20][21][22]. The blockchain approach 
implies the irrevocability of changes, i.e., the blocks or 
information remain permanently in the system and cannot 
simply be deleted [7][18]. The security mechanisms are 
implemented to avoid any spam and denial-of-service attacks 
[23]. 
The interaction of users within the blockchain takes place 
by using a related key pair, which comprises a private key 
and a public key [24]. The latter is publicly visible and 
comparable to an address that each node has; it can be 
regenerated for each transaction in order to maintain 
anonymity. If a node wants to create a transaction and, e.g., 
add new data, this can be done anytime autonomous by 
signing it with its (secret) private key [25]. It is then sent to 
all nodes of the peer-to-peer network to reduce single point 
of failures [15]. Each node is then able to use the public key 
to verify the node that created the transaction before a 
distributed consensus mechanism regulates the addition of 
the new block [26][27]. 
A consensus 
mechanism 
implemented through the Distributed Ledger Technology 
ensures that there is only one next block, which is necessary 
to obtain integrity of the blockchain [15][26][28. This means 
that the consensus mechanism ensures that the transactions 
and blocks are sorted chronologically, which verifies the 
integrity, coherence and consistency of the blocks sustaining 
in the blockchain [7][15][19]. 
A subsequent update process ensures that all participants 
always have the latest version of the database at their disposal 
[29]. There are several methods for validating the transaction 
and reach consensus. The most common of which are 
currently known as 'Proof of Work' and 'Proof of Stake'. In 
these two methods, hash values are generated by the network 
nodes according to a certain pattern. Depending on the length 
of the blockchain, the degree of difficulty and the computing 
power required for this increase. In this context, the working 
nodes are also referred to as 'miners' [27]. The type of the 
utilized consensus mechanism varies in dependency from the 
type of network and other factors [26]. In summary, when a 
transaction is validated, it is stored in the block and chained 
in the blockchain [15], with the community deciding on the 
validation. I.e., this validation could only be manipulated by 
someone who has control over the majority (> 50%) of nodes, 
which is extremely unlikely due to the worldwide 
decentralized networks [7]. The timestamp documents 
(transparently for the whole network) the time of 
implementation and adjustments [30]. 
C. Digital versus Traditional Currencies 
The main differences between traditional and digital 
currencies are: (a) The digital currencies are organized 
decentral using block-chain technology and do not require 
banks or other intermediaries (unlike traditional currencies). 
(b) The digital currencies are (uniformly) valid and available 
worldwide [31], while the traditional currencies are generally 
specific to individual states or economic areas [32]. The use 
of traditional currencies (especially for international 
transactions) results in relatively high transaction costs, 
whereas digital currencies cause no or only very low 
transaction costs due to the consensus mechanism and the 
very fast "automatic" validation of transactions [3][31][33]. 
(c) Digital currencies offer a high degree of anonymity and 
protection of personal data, which is not provided by 
traditional currencies (e.g., credit card payments or money 
transfers). In traditional currencies, this anonymity could 
only be achieved through cash payments, but the transaction 
costs are very high. In addition, cash payments are strongly 
limited or regulated in many countries 
Another central feature of a currency is that it is always 
available, transportable and divisible. This is also true for 
cryptocurrencies [34]. 
In 
contrast 
to 
the 
traditional 
currencies, 
each 
cryptocurrency has a fixed limit regarding the maximum 
currency units that can be issued [34].  
D. Challenges 
Due to this "gap" regarding the legal and regulatory 
framework, there are potential uncertainties regarding the 
clarification of possible conflicts between trading partners 
[10][35]. 
In particular, the 'Proof of Work' mechanism causes 
extremely high-energy consumption, which is a factor of 
several thousand higher than traditional financial transactions 
[36]. 
For a long-term success, a digital currency (using 
blockchain technology) must achieve the acceptance of the 
majority of the population. After all, the long-term 
importance of the digital currency ultimately depends on the 
number of actual users and the acceptance as a payment 
system by the trade [37]. 
E. Research Model – Adjusted Model with Elements of the 
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2  
In this section, the used research model will be described. 
The focus in this research paper will be on the relationships 
68

CENTRIC 2019 : The Twelfth International Conference on Advances in Human-oriented and Personalized Mechanisms, Technologies, and Services

between (a) the risks of cryptocurrencies and the intention to 
use 
cryptocurrencies, 
(b) 
the 
experiences 
with 
cryptocurrencies and the intention to use cryptocurrencies, 
and (c) the general experiences with investments and the 
intention to use cryptocurrencies. The analysis of the named 
research concepts follows the Unified Theory of Acceptance 
and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2), which developed by 
Venkatesh, Thong, and Xin [38]. The UTAUT2 expands the 
existing UTAUT by the additional elements of hedonic 
motivation, price, and habit/experience, which allows a 
broader consideration of critical influence factors on the user 
behavior and the behavioral intention to use [38]-[40]. 
For this reason, to estimate these and further relations, an 
adjusted approach of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and 
Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) will be used, which is 
displayed in the conceptual model in Figure 1. 
In principle, it can be assumed that higher returns or 
expected returns are generally associated with a higher 
investment risk. In this respect, it is necessary to examine 
how much risk they are prepared to take in order to achieve 
high returns. It can be assumed that investors who have more 
experience with investments and who have often made these 
via digital channels (e.g., online banking) are generally more 
open to the use of cryptocurrencies. 
Finally, it should be noted that so far there has been no 
scientific review of the relationship between (a) performance 
expectations, (b) experience, (c) perceived risk and 
behavioral intention to use cryptocurrencies. The variable of 
perceived risk is treated as external variable in the further 
analysis. Additionally, the strength of perceived risk and 
experience will be estimated by linking these variables with 
the performance expectancy. The performance of the 
investments in digital currencies is rated by the performance 
expectancy. 
Problematically, (a) the expected performance, (b) 
experience, and (c) perceptions of risks differ between the 
individual customers [41]. This means, the user attitudes and 
beliefs are completely subjective [41]. The experience comes 
from the fact that users become more and more familiar with 
a technology or service after it has been used for the first time. 
[39][42][43]. With the increasing use of a technology or a 
service, the user gains more and more experience and 
knowledge and learns with it, whereby the use becomes more 
and more self-evident and "automatic" [44].  
Since habits and experiences allow predictions to be made 
for later use, it can be predicted that experience positively 
influences the utilization of cryptocurrencies. 
In principle, the existing risks influenced the uses and 
investment behavior of customers [45]. This is particularly 
reflected in the fact that the risk has a significant influence on 
customer acceptance of innovations (e.g., mobile payment, 
mobile banking and mobile shopping) [46]-[51].  
Previous researches identified that the perceived risk is one 
of the key drivers for the estimation of uncertainties in mobile 
payments, mobile shopping, mobile banking, and mobile 
transactions [46][48]-[52], because customers fear a lack of 
control.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Conceptual Model 
 
Consequently, the literature conveys the feedback that in 
several cases risks and uncertainties influence the customer 
user behavior. 
Based on the explanations, the hypotheses for this research 
paper are: 
H1: The customer perception of performance expectancy 
of investments (including digital currencies) has a directly 
positive effect on the intention to use cryptocurrencies. 
H2: Customers' experience with investments (including 
digital currencies) has a direct positive impact on their 
intention to use cryptocurrencies. 
H3: If customers are generally affine to risk when making 
investments, this has a direct positive effect on the intention 
to use cryptocurrencies. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
In this section, the approach for the verification of the 
hypotheses will be shortly introduced. Therefore, to test the 
hypotheses, an online survey was carried out to obtain 
information on the investment behavior of private 
individuals. In particular, the survey covered the perception 
of users regarding cryptocurrencies and the resulting 
investment behavior. The focus here is on the perceived 
performance of digital currencies and investments made. 
To achieve the needed user information, a cross-sectional 
online survey (“one-shot survey”) had been prepared and 
distributed through multipliers in social media platforms 
[53]. 
As this is an online survey, it cannot be guaranteed (as 
opposed to a personal survey) that most respondents will fully 
answer the questions. In addition, the questionnaire was 
designed in such a way that individual questions could not be 
skipped without ending the survey. In this respect, a relatively 
large number of participants prematurely terminated their 
responses to the questionnaire. The survey was distributed 
during the period from May to June 2018. In this period, 155 
people have opened and started the questionnaire. However, 
only 62% (96 out of 155) respondents have finished the 
questionnaire. For this reason, the sample of the whole

analysis will be the data set covering the 96 respondents, 
which have fully completed the questionnaire. 
In the first part, the demographic information (such as age, 
gender and educational level) of the respondents was 
collected. In the following part the previous investment 
behavior and the knowledge of the participants about 
cryptocurrencies was determined. It should be determined 
whether the respondents know cryptocurrencies and whether 
they 
have 
already 
made 
investments 
based 
on 
cryptocurrencies. A positive answer (= experience with 
cryptocurrencies) was used to determine in more detail how 
many transactions, how much with which cryptocurrency the 
participants have already carried out. Since the third part is in 
higher importance for the later data analysis, all the 
implemented questions were coded in the 5-Point-Likert-
scale format [54]. The third part covers especially questions 
regarding 
the 
respondent 
investment 
intentions 
in 
cryptocurrencies. In addition, the risk appetite and expected 
return (5-Point-Likert-scale: high to low) are important 
information in this part. The subsequent fourth part of the 
questionnaire considers questions regarding the user 
perception about the course of the cryptocurrency 
investment. As in the part before, the questions are coded in 
5-Point-Likert-scale format (very likely to very unlikely). In 
the last part of the questionnaires, the respondents were 
queried about the future of cryptocurrencies in general. 
The collected data were analyzed using quantitative 
research methods and the SPSS statistical program. To 
examine the reliability and validity of the data, the estimation 
of the Cronbach’s Alpha and the Exploratory Factor Analysis 
were performed. 
Only the eight largest cryptocurrencies (measured by 
market capitalization) were taken into account. 
As mentioned above, the used approach only contains 
elements of the UTAUT2. Therefore, the evaluation is not 
done by structural equation modeling [38]. Instead, an 
ordinary least square regression to test the significance of 
each hypotheses is used. In the final hypothesis, all the 
previous considered single variables, like (a) perceived 
performance, (b) experience, (c) risk appetite, (d) investment 
and speculation type, (e) regulations, and (f) assessment of 
the acceptance as alternative payment method will be related 
to the undertaking of investments in cryptocurrencies. 
IV. 
DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  
 
Following the described approach in conducting the 
survey, the outcomes for the estimation of the hypotheses will 
be deeply illustrated.  
A. Descriptive Results 
In the following, the descriptive results of the performed 
survey will be introduced. 53.1% of the respondents are male 
and the average age of a respondent is between 25 and 29 
years. With 41.7% respectively 24.0%, the group of the 18 to 
24 year respectively 25 to 29-year-old persons have the 
largest proportions of respondents within the survey. On the 
base that the age group of the 20 to 29 year old persons has 
only a 12.2% share of the total population in Germany, it 
must be noted that the young persons below the age of 30 
years old are overrepresented in the survey by a factor of 
approx. five [55]. Since cryptocurrencies are virtual goods, 
their use requires a high Internet affinity. Based on a study of 
ARD/ZDF from 2015 the age group of the 20 to 29-year-old 
persons does nearly complete use the internet [56]. 
Since younger people generally use the Internet more often 
and have a greater interest in virtual goods than older people 
have, the previously established overrepresentation of 
younger age groups is not surprising. With regard to the age, 
the survey is not representative for the total population of 
Germany. 
Considering the educational background, nearly the half of 
the respondents (46.9%) state that the school leaving 
examination is the education degree what they have. A 
quarter of the respondents have completed the Master degree 
(25%) from university. 
The average net household income of the respondents is 
between 1,000 and 1,999 euros per month, with most of the 
participants (36.3%) having a net (household) income of less 
than 500 euros per month. In addition, almost three quarters 
(73.8%) have a net (household) income of less than 2,000 
euros. In connection with the level of education and age, it 
can be assumed that the interviewees are predominantly 
students. 
90.6% (= 87/96) of the respondents know what 
cryptocurrencies are. These 87 persons are the basic 
population (= 100%) for questions about cryptocurrencies. 
47.9% (= 46/96) of the respondents have already made 
financial investments. However, only 35.4% (34 of 96 
respondents) have already done investments in or with 
cryptocurrencies. From this point of view, the 34 respondents 
will be the basic population (= 100%) for all questions 
regarding the investment behavior with cryptocurrencies, 
especially number of transactions, amount of invested 
financial 
resources 
and 
perceptions 
regarding 
the 
development of the invested portfolio. 
Firstly, the descriptive results for the respondents, who 
know cryptocurrencies (=87), will be illustrated. In general, 
all the respondents know Bitcoin as cryptocurrency, whereas 
two thirds of the respondents answer to know BitcoinCash 
and Ethereum, which can be seen in Table I.

Although 36.9% of the respondents are very risk-affine 
with regard to investments, only 23.4% of the respondents 
describe themselves as speculators. Contrary, 39.3% of the 
respondents answer to have a risk-shy nature, which can be 
also seen in estimation that 37.8% of the respondents estimate 
to be arbitragers. By regarding the estimation of returns, only 
21.7% of the respondents think to get low returns. Although 
it is well known that higher returns can only be achieved with 
higher risks, some of the respondents who are risk-averse 
hope for medium to high returns. 
Interestingly, 87.8% of respondents think that the new 
cryptocurrencies have been brought to life to drive a new 
form of speculation and investment. This is underlined by the 
fact that only 22.9% of respondents see Bitcoin as an 
alternative payment method to credit cards and the like. 
43.4% of respondents involved in investment argue for 
regulatory intervention or restrictions in the cryptocurrency 
market, while 32.5% reject it. 
Now, the results of the respondents using cryptocurrencies 
are shown. As already mentioned, however, the sample size 
is very small with 34 respondents, which is why the results 
cannot be generalized. 
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the investment in the 
eight most important cryptocurrencies. 83.0% of respondents 
have already invested in Bitcoin. In addition to Bitcoin, the 
currency Ethereum seems to be of particular interest to 
investors.  
48.5% of the respondents have invested at least 2,000 Euro 
in cryptocurrencies. 67.6%, these investors state that they 
make a profit by investing in cryptocurrencies. Figure 3 
shows the objectives of the investments.  
In general, most investors in cryptocurrencies believe in 
long-term increases in value. In comparison to the overall 
group of respondents knowing and using cryptocurrencies, 
the users of cryptocurrencies believe in a higher degree that 
Bitcoin could develop to an alternative currency and payment 
method. 
In general, over 50% of the investors have a long-term 
direction by investing in cryptocurrencies.  
 
 
Figure 2. Investments in Cryptocurrencies 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Purpose in Cryptocurrencies 
 
In this respect, the investment in these currencies usually 
takes place with a longer time horizon (of several years). 
Figure 4 illustrates the expectations of investors with 
regard to the performance of their currency investments. 
 
Figure 4. Expectations regard to the Cryptocurrency Investment 
 
The majority of the investors (82%) assumes that a total 
loss of the investment does not occur. Contrary, over the half 
of the investors assumes to gain profits (in 6 months: 55%; in 
12 months: 71%). Considering, the probability to get a loss in 
the investments, 58% of the investors estimate this as 
unlikely within the next 12 months. 
Overall, 
the 
investment 
atmosphere 
regarding 
cryptocurrencies is quite positively. Investors perceive high 
profits by doing the investments and see only minor risks of 
a loss of their investments. 
B. Reliability and Validity 
The results of the reliability and validity analyses are 
illustrated in the Tables II and III. In general, this study 
includes the following 7 concepts: (1) performance 
expectancy, (2) experience, (3) perceived risk, (4) intention 
to use cryptocurrencies, (5) purposes of investments in 
cryptocurrencies, (6) usage of cryptocurrencies, and (7) 
prominence of cryptocurrencies.

Generally, all named concepts are examined in the terms 
of reliability and validity. Following Cronbach, Alpha values 
must be higher than 0.7/0.6 to for a good/sufficient reliability 
[57]-[59]. Based on the results in Table II, the collected data 
for 5 of the 7 named aspects are at least sufficiently reliable. 
Solely, the concepts of performance expectancy and 
experience seem to be completely not reliable. 
After the testing of the reliability, the exploratory factor 
analysis includes the assessment of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin 
criterion (KMO), the significance test from Bartlett, and the 
examination of the cumulative variance to evaluate the 
validity of the collected data [60]-[64]. Validity considers the 
consistency of an empirical measurement with the based 
conceptual/logical measurement concept. To reach a good 
validity, the concepts should reach significant p values 
(p<0.05) in the Bartlett-Test and KMO values above 0.7 (at 
least higher than 0.5) [60]-[64].  
Table III shows a sufficient validity for 6 of the 7 concepts. 
The validity scores are also supported by the results of the 
cumulative variances higher than 50% except the concept of 
experience.

Despite the mark of 50% is not completely achieved, the 
explanatory rates of the variances can be rated as sufficiently 
high [61]-[63]. Consequently, the reliability and validity of 
the collected data are proved. 
Table IV shows the variables that have a significant 
correlation with the intention to use cryptocurrencies. In 
addition to the values shown in Table IV: (a) There are 
positive significant correlations for all variables of perceived 
risk 
and 
experience 
with 
the 
intention 
of 
using 
cryptocurrencies. 
C. Correlation Analysis 
The correlation analysis measures the degree of the 
relationship between two individual variables. It is not, 
however, the degree of the linear proportionality. A 
correlation of 1.000 shows a ‘perfect’ relationship. A 
correlation coefficient higher than 0.500 is classified as a 
good correlation. Below 0.300, the correlation coefficients 
are weak [65][66].

D. Regression Analyses 
As introduced earlier, the regression analysis will be 
performed on the method of an ordinary least square 
regression. The intension is to verify if the dependent variable 
behavioral intention to use cryptocurrencies is affected by the 
developed three concepts of independent variables [66]. In 
this regard, it will be examined, in which degree the predictor 
variables can explain the generated values of the dependent 
variable [67]. 
In the application of the regression analysis, four major 
indicators need to be considered. Firstly, the r-square will be 
determined to quantify the explanatory power of the whole 
regression model. The r-square is the share of the dependent 
variable, which can be explained by the independent 
72

variables. Following Chin and Cohen, the value should be at 
least 33% [68][69]. 
Secondly, the analysis of the variances (ANOVA) needs to 
verify the model fit. The resulting values should be 
significant (p<0.05) and higher than 3 in order to evaluate the 
model as good, which is the case here. 
Thirdly, the regression coefficients of the independent 
variables need to be significant (p<0.05). In particular, the 
identified estimators must match the expectations in the 
research hypotheses. Fourthly, the test of multicollinearities 
by the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) needs to be performed 
to find out, whether the variables included in the regression 
analyses have an identical relation. In the case of existing 
multicollinearities, i.e., if the VIF values exceed 10 (or in a 
stricter definition 3), the outcomes of the regression analysis 
are biased [60][70][71]. 
In performing the regression analysis, the relation between 
the variables of perceived risk and the intention to use 
cryptocurrencies are investigated (see Table V). In general, 
the r-square achieves a score of 35.2%. Since this value is 
slightly above the mark of 33%, there is at least a sufficient 
explanatory rate of the values of the dependent variable. The 
ANOVA scores an F-Ratio above the mark of 3.90. 
The expected return positively significant affects the 
intention to use cryptocurrencies. This means, when investors 
expect a higher return, they are more open to use 
cryptocurrencies. In addition, the affinity for risk relates 
positively significantly but weakly with the intention to use 
cryptocurrencies. If investors are open to speculate and to 
take higher risks in investments, they intent to use 
cryptocurrencies for their investments. The VIF-values are 
below the mark of 3, so it can be excluded that 
multicollinearities are within the assumed model. 
In Table VI, the variable of the expectation regarding a 
total loss of the investment is related to the intention to use 
cryptocurrencies. The r-square of the regression is 12.2%. 
Surely, the mark is below 33% and therefore, the explanatory 
rate seems to be low. In comparison to the other concepts, the 
expectation of a total loss of an investment in 
cryptocurrencies reaches a high r-square regarding that only 
one variable in the regression is considered. The F-Ratio of 
the ANOVA indicates a value better than the mark of 3.90 
and therefore, a model fit is given. The variable total loss is 
negatively significant related to the intention to use 
cryptocurrencies.

The negative relationship remarks that investors perceive 
that investments in cryptocurrencies are very improbable to 
lead to a full loss of the investment. This induces the 
openness for and investments in cryptocurrencies. Since there 
is only one variable, there cannot be any multicollinearities. 
In Table VII, the variables of the concept experience are 
directly related to the intention to use cryptocurrencies. The 
r-square of 45.8% describes a low to moderate explanatory 
rate of the values occurring by the dependent variables. At 
least two fifths of the values of the dependent variable 
intention to use cryptocurrencies can be explained by 
applying the independent variables covering the concept of 
experience. The F-Ratio of 8.734 remarks an existing model 
fit.

In the concept experience, two variables are positively 
significant with the intention to use cryptocurrencies. Firstly, 
the general investment behavior positively affects to the 
intention to use cryptocurrencies. In general, in case investors 
do regularly investments (indifferently in which field) they 
are 
more open to intent to use investments in 
cryptocurrencies. Secondly, the variable, which includes the 
investment duration, is positively significant related to the 
intention to use cryptocurrencies. This means, investors are 
more oriented in a long-term store of value. If they behave in 
this direction, they see cryptocurrencies also as opportunity 
to invest over a longer time. If investors want to invest for a 
longer period of time, they more intent to use 
cryptocurrencies for their investments. The VIF-scores 
identify that multicollinearities can be excluded in the model. 
Finally, in a combined regression, all independent 
variables of the three individual regressions are used together. 
The combination of the independent variables leads to an 
73

enhancement to the level of 70.1%. Comparing the resulting 
r-square to the mark of 33%, the combined approach 
identifies a high level of explanatory power. In this regard, 
nearly three quarters of the data points of the dependent 
variable can be explained by the application of the 
independent variables. The F-Ratio of 8.041 identifies a good 
model fit. Through combining all independent variables of 
the previous regression analyses, only the variable covering 
the general investment behavior affects positively significant 
the intention to use cryptocurrencies. When investors have 
more experience with the application and execution of 
investments in general, they are more open and willing to use 
cryptocurrencies. This effect seems to be the most dominant 
one in the model, since all the other independent variables are 
getting insignificantly when they are considered in the 
combined approach. It can be assumed that investors in 
cryptocurrencies are persons, who have done investments in 
the past. Therefore, if persons are familiar with investments, 
they are more willing to do investments in cryptocurrencies. 
However, the combined approach identifies two variables 
(risk appetite and risk type), which have VIF-values above 
the mark of 3. In this regard, the combined approach cannot 
fully guarantee that no multicollinearities are within the 
model. For this reason, the regression coefficients could be 
biased by the overwhelming effects of the independent 
variables, which are strongly correlating with each other. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Summarizing the regression analyses, the hypotheses H1 
to H3 can be accepted. In general, when investors have made 
investments in the past, they are more open to use 
cryptocurrencies. This result is supported by the fact that how 
longer the investors do investments and have a long-term 
store of value, they intent to use cryptocurrencies. In addition, 
if the investors expect to experience not a total loss of the 
investment in cryptocurrencies, they have a higher 
willingness to use cryptocurrencies. Lastly, investors, who do 
investments with a greater risk, they have also a greater intent 
to use cryptocurrencies for their investment to reach higher 
returns. 
To sum up, all three concepts identify significant variables, 
which are influencing the intention to use cryptocurrencies. 
For this reason, the assumed research model and hypotheses 
can be fully confirmed. However, as remarked in the 
beginning, the sample size of the whole analysis is too low. 
On this account, the achieved results cannot be generalized, 
and further quantitative analyses and surveys are necessary to 
deepen the influence factors of cryptocurrencies. As this is a 
very topical issue, the authors expect that further research 
works will be performed, which focus on the influence factor 
for the adoption of Bitcoin, Ethereum and further currencies.
