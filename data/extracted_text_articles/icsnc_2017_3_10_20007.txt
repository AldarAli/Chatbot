Abstract—Based on IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Func-
tion (DCF), Persistent Relay Carrier Sense Multiple Access
(PRCSMA) was proposed for cooperative transmission with two
or more relay nodes. We propose random assigning of the
initial Contention Window (CW) value of each relay node at the
beginning of cooperation phase in PRCSMA. Each relay node
independently and randomly selects its initial CW value among
a predeﬁned set of integers, while in the original PRCSMA,
a relay node ﬁxes its CW value to a common given integer.
Numerical results obtained from computer simulation reveal
that the proposed protocol can improve the performance of the
original PRCSMA. The proposed protocol makes it possible to
reduce the possibility of frame collisions among relay nodes
and successfully reduce the duration of cooperation. Also, the
results demonstrate that the binary exponential backoﬀ algorithm
degrades the performance of PRCSMA.

Introduction
In order to compensate poor channel quality and improve
communication reliability, cooperative communications with
relay nodes have been recognized as one of eﬀective and
promising techniques in wireless/mobile communication sys-
tems. Relay standards are on the way to successful implemen-
tation in Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced by the Third
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and 802.16m by IEEE
[1] [2]. Relay techniques have been enthusiastically investi-
gated from the viewpoint of the physical (PHY) and data-link
layers [2] [3]. From the viewpoint of PHY layer, Multiple-
Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) and diversity techniques
are known to be eﬀective. In the data-link layer perspective,
a number of Cooperative Automatic Repeat reQuest (C-ARQ)
protocols have been proposed and analyzed. Particularly, the
design of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols employed
between relay nodes and the destination node inﬂuences the
performance, when two or more relay nodes collaborate on an
identical channel.
Some MAC protocols for C-ARQ systems have been
proposed recently. Morillo and Garcia-Vidal [4] proposed a
C-ARQ scheme with an integrated frame combiner. They
analyzed the performance with round-robin cooperation among
relay nodes and with Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Col-
lision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). Alonso-Zarate et al. [5] [6] pro-
posed Persistent Relay CSMA (PRCSMA), which elaborately
incorporates well-known IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordina-
tion Function (DCF) [7]; de facto standard for wireless LANs.
When the number of relay nodes is unknown, contention-
based MAC protocols are required for the data-link layer at a
relay node. In [5], the performance of PRCSMA was analyzed
in terms of the average duration of cooperation, based on a
steady-state Markovian model proposed by Bianchi [8] For
IEEE 802.11 DCF, Foh and Tantra presented an accurate three-
dimensional Markovian model [9], which took into account a
carry-over of backoﬀ counter freezing after frame collision
occurred. In [9], the accuracy of the new model is veriﬁed
by computer simulation. In [10], the authors indicated that
incorporation of Foh and Tantra’s method to PRCSMA can
greatly improve the performance. However, the Contention
Window (CW) value of all the relay node is ﬁxed in advance,
as in the original PRCSMA [5].
In this paper, we propose random assigning of the initial
CW value of each relay node at the beginning of cooperation
phase in order to further improve the performance of PRC-
SMA. Each relay node independently and randomly selects
its initial CW value among a predeﬁned set of integers. The
proposed protocol requires no information of the number of
competing relay nodes. Random assigning of the initial CW
value makes it possible to reduce the possibility of frame
collisions among relay nodes before successful frame trans-
mission which completes cooperative retransmissions. The
performance of the proposed protocol is veriﬁed by computer
simulation.
The rest of the present paper is organized as follows:
Section II presents a system model with relay nodes. PRCSMA
is brieﬂy reviewed in Section III. In Section IV, the proposed
protocol of random assigning of the initial CW value is
described. Numerical results obtained by means of computer
simulations are presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI
concludes the present paper.

System Model
Consider a wireless network consisting of a pair of source
node S and destination node D with N relay nodes; R1, R2, . . . ,
RN, as shown in Figure 1. All channels are half-duplex, so
that a node can not transmit and receive simultaneously. All
nodes are located within their transmission range. Hence, each
node can overhear ongoing transmission originating from other
nodes. We assume that a node possesses no information on the
number of relay nodes. Let εSD, εSRn, and εRnD be the frame
error rates on channels between source node S and destination
node D, between source node S and relay node Rn, and
between relay node Rn and destination node D, respectively,
for n = 1, 2, . . . , N. If frame transmission from source node
S resulted in erroneous reception at destination node D and
if one or more relay nodes succeeded in error-free reception

of the frame, then such relay nodes can collaboratively serve
as supporters for frame retransmission. For eﬀective use of
cooperative communications, we generally assume that εSD >
εRnD. The duration in which relay nodes collaborate frame
retransmissions is referred to as a cooperation phase [5]. Note
that every frame is assumed to include an appropriate header
and an ideal Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for error/collision
detection, in addition to the payload. Note that the term
“ideal” implies that the probability of undetected errors can
be neglected.
III.
PRCSMA
PRCSMA [5] [6] is a MAC protocol which elaborately
resolves frame collisions among transmission from relay nodes
to destination node D, based on IEEE 802.11 DCF [7].
Similarly to IEEE 802.11 DCF, each relay node in PRCSMA
inserts random backoﬀ delay before every frame transmission
in a distributed manner according to its own current value of
the CW. More precisely, if CW = w, then the initial value of
the backoﬀ counter is set to an integer randomly taken from
the range [0, w − 1].
The operation of PRCSMA is summarized as follows.
The detailed description can be found in [5]. After erroneous
reception of a DATA frame transmitted by source node S,
destination node D broadcasts a Call For Cooperation (CFC)
frame following the Short Inter-Frame Space (SIFS). If one
or more relay nodes correctly receive both the DATA frame
and the CFC frame, then the cooperation phase is invoked. A
relay node which joins in the cooperation phase is referred
to as an active relay node. Active relay nodes simultaneously
start the DCF operation, after the reception of the CFC frame
followed by the Distributed Inter-Frame Space (DIFS). It is
regulated that DIFS is longer than SIFS in order to guarantee
prior transmissions of control frames to those of data frames
[7]. In addition, an idle period speciﬁed by ACKtimeout
after DATA frame transmission notiﬁes nodes of transmission
failure. Then, a relay node involved in collision carries out
another retransmission procedure with random backoﬀ interval.
When destination node D correctly receives a DATA frame
from one of the active relay nodes, it broadcasts an ACK frame
to announce not only correct reception of the DATA frame to
source node S but also completion of the cooperation phase to
all the nodes.
In the original PRCSMA [5], the decrement of backoﬀ
counter at each relay node follows the method considered in
[8]. In [10], the authors showed that by adopting the method
in [9], the duration of the cooperation phase can be greatly
decreased. Therefore, we consider the method in [9].
An illustrative operational example with three active relay
nodes, R1, R2 and R3, is shown in Figure 2. Active relay
nodes R1 and R2 independently set their backoﬀ counter to
three and active relay node R3 to four after reception of CFC
frame from destination node D, which follows an erroneous
reception of DATA frame (0). In Figure 2, a short thick down
arrow marks the start of backoﬀ interval. The ﬁrst DATA frame
transmissions from active relay nodes R1 and R2, named as
DATA frames (1-1) and (2-1), respectively, result in collision.
In this period of frame collision, another active relay node R3
freezes the decrement of backoﬀ counter. The two colliding
active nodes R1 and R2 recognize their frame transmission
failure after ACKtimeout. They randomly and independently
select their next backoﬀ interval, so that R1 sets its backoﬀ
interval to two and R2, to zero. Complying with the method
of Foh and Tantra [9], another active relay node R3 carries over
its backoﬀ counter whose value is one. Then, only the active
relay node R2 retransmits DATA frame (2-2). Assume that
destination node D receives DATA frame (2-2) erroneously,
so that the cooperation phase continues. Finally, DATA frame
(1-2) is received with no errors by destination node D. Then,
ACK frame transmission from destination node D notiﬁes other
nodes of completion of the cooperation phase.
IV.
Random Assigning of Initial CW Values
In PRCSMA, no speciﬁc backoﬀ algorithm such as the
binary exponential backoﬀ (BEB) algorithm is prescribed in
updating the CW values of relay nodes involved in frame colli-
sions. For the sake of mathematical tractability, Alonso-Zarate
et al. [5] and Predojev et al. [6] analyzed the performance of
PRCSMA with constant CW values, that is, a relay node ﬁxes
the CW value to the initial CW value, which is regulated to
be equal among all the relay nodes all the time, even after
frame collisions. It is clear that small CW value may increase
the probability of frame collision and that large CW value
may insert a large number of unnecessary idle slots, both of
which may enlarge the duration of cooperation phase. From
the assumption that the number of relay nodes N is unknown
to all nodes, neither adaptive nor optimization techniques with
respect to the CW value based on N can be applied.
In order to mitigate undesired extension of cooperation
phase, we propose a random assigning of the initial CW values
to each active relay node at the beginning of the cooperation
phase. Let us denote the minimum and maximum CW values
by CWmin and CWmax, respectively. Here, we deﬁne a set of
D possible initial CW values;
W = {W0, W1, . . . , WD−1},
(1)
where
Wi = min[2iCWmin, CWmax]
(2)
for i = 0, 1, . . . , D − 1. In the proposed protocol, each active
relay node independently and randomly selects its initial CW
value among W. For example, we have
W = {32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1024}
(3)
for CWmin = 32, CWmax = 1024 and D = 7. An active relay
node randomly selects one integer from W. Since D = 7
and CWmax = 1024 is doubly included in W, as in (3),
each integer is selected with probability 1/7 except for 1024,
whose probability is 2/7. As another choice for W in (3), we

can set W = {32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024} with D = 6
and probability 1/6 for each value. However, in the following
numerical results, we permit unbalanced probabilities in order
to enable us to compare the results for identical values of D.
Note here that for D = 1, the proposed protocol is
degenerated into the original PRCSMA, since the initial CW
value of all the relay node is CWmin.
V.
Numerical Results
We evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol;
random assigning of the initial CW values described in Sec-
tion IV, in terms of the average duration of cooperation phase
by means of exhaustive computer simulation. Comparisons
with the original PRCSMA, in which each relay node ﬁxes
its CW values to the given integer all the time, are presented.
We examine two cases for both the proposed protocol and the
original PRCSMA. In the ﬁrst case, each relay node keeps
the assigned initial CW value after frame collision; without
BEB, while in the second case, the CW value is doubled after
frame collision until it reaches to CWmax in a similar manner
to IEEE 802.11 DCF; with BEB. The simulation program is
written in C language and the results are obtained by averaging
105 trials of cooperation phases. Each trail starts with N
active relay nodes, which implies that all the relay nodes
correctly receive both DATA frame from source node S and
CFC frame from destination node D. The values of parameters
used in simulations are tabulated in Table I, which are basically
taken from IEEE 802.11a standard [7]. The values of CWmin
are taken by referring to IEEE 802.11e standard. Channels
between relay node Rn and destination node D are assumed
error-free; εRnD = 0 for any n = 1, 2, . . . , N. Hence, frame
transmission succeeds if it experiences no other simultaneous
frame transmissions.
A. Average Duration of Cooperation Phase
The average duration of cooperation phase of the proposed
protocol and the original PRCSMA (D = 1) is shown for
CWmin = 4, 8, 16, 32 in Figure 3 and Figure 4. In Figure 3, no
BEB algorithm is employed, so that each relay node holds the
assigned initial CW value after frame collision. In Figure 4,

each relay node doubles its CW value unless it is greater than
CWmax. Shorter duration of cooperation phase is preferred,
since nodes can move to the next data transfer rapidly.
First, let us roughly compare the performance between the
proposed protocol and the original PRCSMA. If the number of
active relay nodes N is small, then the proposed protocol for
large D is preferred. This tendency is outstanding for wider
range of N, when CWmin is smaller. On the other hand, if N is
large, the original PRCSMA exhibits small average duration of
cooperation phase. As a whole, we can observe from Figure 3
and Figure 4 that the proposed protocol for CWmin = 8 and
D = 7 with no BEB algorithm indicates best average duration
of cooperation phase, which is stable for wide range of the
number of active relay nodes.
Next, compare the performance with and without BEB
algorithm. An incorporation of the BEB algorithm generally
enlarge the average duration of cooperation phase. An ef-
fectiveness of the BEB algorithm has been widely known
and analyzed. In fact, the BEB algorithm is able to reduce
the probability of frame collision and to improve the steady-
state performance. However, it is revealed from Figure 3 and
Figure 4 that the BEB algorithm may defer the occurrence of
the ﬁrst successful frame transmission, in particular, in dense
networks. The results give us an insight that in the transient
state, the CW values should be kept constant until some frames

succeed in transmission, and then the BEB algorithm should
be invoked.
B. Slot Distribution
In order to reveal the reason why the adoption of the BEB
algorithm may bring about longer unnecessary time before the
ﬁrst success of frame transmission, we examine the average
number of virtual slots in a cooperation phase. Since channel
errors between relay nodes and destination node are ignored,
virtual slots can be classiﬁed into idle, collision, and successful
slots, where every cooperation phase ends with a unique
successful slot.
We examine the distribution of the number of slots in a
cooperation phase in average. The numerical results are shown
in Figure 5 for the case of CWmin = 8 and D = 7. The results
with no BEB algorithm are given in Figure 5(a) and those with
the BEB algorithm, in Figure 5(b). Comparing two graphs in
Figure 5, we can ﬁnd that the number of collision slots and
idle slots in Figure 5(b) increases for N > 50. For CWmin = 8
and D = 7, N/7 relay nodes start a cooperation phase with
CW = 8. If N is less than 50, about seven relay nodes start
with CW = 8 and other relay nodes, with CW ∈ {16, . . . , 1024}.
Therefore, the probability of frame collision may be small,
since the most possible collision among relay nodes with
CW = 8 may be rare. For N > 50, the probability of frame
collision can be expected to increase, which causes a necessity
of frame retransmissions. Recall here that according to Foh

and Tantra’s method [9], only the relay nodes involved frame
collision are permitted to retransmit their frame in the next time
slot, if their new backoﬀ counter is zero. It implies that the
possibility of consecutive occurrence of frame collision in the
time slot following frame collision can be mitigated. However,
the doubling process of CW values in the BEB algorithm
may decrease the possibility to randomly select zero backoﬀ
counter, compared to the case without the BEB algorithm.
C. Consecutive Frame Collisions
Next, we evaluate the number of consecutive frame col-
lisions followed by a successful DATA frame transmission,
which entails the end of the cooperation phase.
In Figure 6, the ratio of the number of consecutive frame
collision slots followed by successful DATA frame transmis-
sion is shown for the proposed protocol and the original
PRCSMA for CWmin = 8 and D = 7 with and without the BEB
algorithm. The results with no BEB algorithm are given in
Figure 6(a) and those with the BEB algorithm, in Figure 6(b).
An illustrative description of the number of consecutive col-
lisions followed by successful frame transmission is shown
in Figure 7. It follows from Figure 6(a) that in the case of
with no BEB algorithm, the ratio of successful DATA frame
transmission following an isolated frame collision slot after
an idle slot; red curve, increases faster than the case with the
BEB algorithm for 50 < N < 150. For N > 150, red curve for
the case with the BEB algorithm is greater than that for the

case without BEB algorithm. However, since the possibility
of two or more consecutive frame collisions decreases in the
case with the BEB algorithm, the corresponding curves; blue
and black curves, are almost zero. This means that a number
of idle slots are inserted in the case of BEB algorithm before
successful frame transmission.

Conclusion and Future Work
Random assigning of the initial CW value of each relay
node at the beginning of cooperation phase has been proposed
in PRCSMA. Each relay node independently and randomly
selects its initial CW value among a predeﬁned set of integers,
while in the original PRCSMA, a relay node ﬁxes its CW
value to a common integer. Numerical results obtained from
computer simulation have revealed that the proposed protocol
can improve the performance of the original PRCSMA. The
proposed protocol makes it possible to reduce the possibility
of frame collisions among relay nodes before successful frame
transmission which completes a cooperation phase. Also, the
results demonstrate that the binary exponential backoﬀ algo-
rithm degrades the performance of PRCSMA.
Further work includes, for example, the extension to bidi-
rectional communication systems and to the use of network
coding. Also, the theoretical analysis through appropriate
mathematical modeling of the proposed protocol should be
investigated.
