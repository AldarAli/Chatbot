Abstract‚ÄîDue to the development of V2V communication, such
safe driving support as collision prevention and adaptive cruise
control has been achieved. Furthermore, in recent years, in
addition to infrastructure-to-vehicle communication (V2I commu-
nication) and communication with a cloud server using mobile
lines is also possible (V2C communication), and such commu-
nication is generally called V2X communication. Through V2X
communication, vehicle‚Äôs peripheral information can be shared
with other vehicles on a cloud server. However, the inÔ¨Çuence
of inappropriate information on the cloud must be addressed.
By faking vehicle information, a system using a cloud server,
perhaps deliberately causing congestion and/or accidents. In this
research, we propose a method that detects camouÔ¨Çage data
from all of that aggregated data on a cloud server using V2X
communication and utilizing the surrounding vehicle information.
We also analyze possible threats and the requirements for the data
that are sent to a cloud, clarify security, and evaluate the proposed
method‚Äôs implementation. We detected 93% of the camouÔ¨Çage
data, and improved the detection rate 100% by increasing the
threshold value of the proposed method and, enhancing the effect
of guaranteeing the data‚Äôs reliability. Furthermore, we showed
the false positives of the proposed method and its execution
processing time and examined feasibility.
Keywords‚Äìvehicle security; V2X communication; detecting cam-
ouÔ¨Çage data.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, research on automatic driving and V2V
communication is being conducted in the Intelligent Transport
Systems (ITS) Ô¨Åeld. In addition to providing V2V communica-
tion using the Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET), vehicles
can engage in V2I communication with roadside aircraft and
V2P communication with tablets owned by pedestrians. Vehi-
cles can also do V2C communication with a cloud server using
mobile lines, and the kinds of communication we mention
here are generally referred to as V2X communication. While
vehicles perform V2X communication, a cloud server can
collect various kinds of information, and we can create a
Local Dynamic Map (LDM) [1] for cooperative driving from
the collective management of road and vehicle information.
This type of communication sometimes is referred as probe
information systems [2] or Ô¨Çoating car data (FCD) [3]. In
addition, various systems and services can be provided, such as
the simpliÔ¨Åcation of such management tasks as summarizing
operation results, analyzing operation trends, summing up
tasks, and simplifying the input of daily reports.
On the other hand, in a system using a cloud server,
camouÔ¨Çage data transfer to a cloud inÔ¨Çuences a system.
Attacks against safe driving support services using a cloud also
pose a threat because the intentional transfer of camouÔ¨Çage
data to a cloud camouÔ¨Çage acts are on the rise. Attackers
can block roads or cause trafÔ¨Åc congestion by sending to a
cloud a camouÔ¨Çage information that pretends to be involved
in an accident. As a type of vehicle disguising acts, various
camouÔ¨Çage acts have been identiÔ¨Åed, such as camouÔ¨Çaging
both driving and position information as well as the vehicle‚Äôs
condition. In this research, we focus on camouÔ¨Çage position
information among all of the data received by a cloud from
vehicles and detect them by mutually monitoring the position
information of vehicles using V2X communication.
II.
ANALYSIS THREAT OF TRANSMISSION DATA
There are things researching the detection of malicious ve-
hicles in V2X communication [4] [5], but in reality malicious
vehicles are ambiguous. In this section, we analyze attacks
on vehicle communication and show what kind of malicious
vehicles to be solved in this research.
A.
Threats, Requirements, and Resolution example
Table I shows analysis of the transmission data to a cloud
server. The threats include eavesdropping attacks, falsiÔ¨Åca-
tions, and spooÔ¨Ång. SpooÔ¨Ång attacks are divided into vehicle
pretense and data camouÔ¨Çage. Vehicle pretense means that
attackers pretend to be other vehicles. For example, even
though one vehicle doesn‚Äôt have any trouble, an attacker
pretends to be the vehicle and then calls the police with a
lie that it had an accident. An example of data camouÔ¨Çage is
when a vehicle‚Äôs own position information or status is masked.
Security requirements about threats includes conÔ¨Ådential-
ity, completeness, node reliability, and data reliability. To
supply conÔ¨Ådentiality and completeness, data encryption is
proposed and can be done by a secret key or an ID base cipher.
Node reliability identiÔ¨Åes vehicles that are pretending to be
other vehicles. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) method,
which is adapted by the vehicles, is one good resolution

Figure 2. Problem of settling by this research
because the certiÔ¨Åcate guarantees vehicles. Data reliability
prevents attackers from camouÔ¨Çaging data. It doesn‚Äôt involve
resolution at all.
B. Difference Between Node and Data Reliability
Node reliability means that a cloud server trusts a particular
vehicle and believes that it isn‚Äôt pretending to be a different
vehicle. The previous section showed that, PKI measures
adapts to the vehicles to resolve the problem. A cloud might
be able to verify the electronic certiÔ¨Åcation and conÔ¨Årm the
transmitter information by the mechanism shown in Figure 1.
This research focuses on such data camouÔ¨Çages, as de-
scribed in Figure 2 in spooÔ¨Ång acts. Since the data encryption
and PKI don‚Äôt conÔ¨Årm whether the received data are cam-
ouÔ¨Çage, the problem, which is resolved by these methods, is
different from the one we focus on in this research. We propose
a method that can handle such examples as when the given
matter, which guarantees the reliability of the data in an act,
camouÔ¨Çages vehicle data.
III.
PROPOSAL
In this section, we propose a method to detect camouÔ¨Çage
data from among data sent to the cloud.
A. Outline
Vehicles use V2X communication. When they send their
position information to a cloud server, they also send other
information than just their position. In this research, the cloud
detects camouÔ¨Çage data from the received data using the relay
base station information in V2C communication and peripheral
vehicles in V2V communication. We explain them separately
to simplify the movement outline of proposed technique.
B. Presuppositions
1)
A safe channel has been secured by a preliminary
relationship of mutual trust among all vehicles and
the cloud server
2)
Vehicles and the cloud have been mutually certiÔ¨Åed
beforehand.
3)
Relationships of mutual trust have been built by a
base station with a cloud server.
C.
DeÔ¨Ånition of Terminology in Proposed Method
‚Ä¢
Vehicle ID
The ID used by a vehicle during V2V communication; a public
ID that is different for every vehicle.
‚Ä¢
V2C Vehicle ID
The ID used for peculiar questions during V2C communica-
tion. This secret ID is not available to others. V2C Vehicle and
Vehicle IDs are uniquely related.
‚Ä¢
Via Base Station (BS) ID
This unique ID in a relay base station for V2C communication.
It adopts bidirectional one time ID signaling, and establishes
its life-time.
‚Ä¢
Peripheral Vehicle (PV) ID
The ID received by a vehicle from other vehicles by V2V
communication.
D. Use of Base Station Information in V2C Communication
When sending position information using V2C communi-
cation, a vehicle attaches the V2CVehicleID to its position
information and sends it to the cloud. The relay base station
on the V2C communication, is encapsulated and make a header
from the ViaBSID in the position that was sent from a vehicle.
The V2CVehicleID for all of the vehicles preserve the regis-
tration beforehand in the cloud, which knows a request that
can conÔ¨Årm vehicle‚Äôs identify by checking the V2CVehicleID.
The possible communication range covered by a base station‚Äôs
area and the ViaBSIDs are also registered with cloud.
Figure 3 indicates an example of base station information
in V2C communication. The vehicles possess V2CVehicleID;
the base stations possess ViaBSIDs. The V2CVehicleIDs are
regarded as either V2C A or V2C B, and ViaBSID, where the
base stations are unique, is made by BS1 or BS2 as simple
explanations. When a vehicle performs V2C communication,
it obtains the information that the cloud will a relay base
station as well as its position information: ViaBSID and
V2CVehicleID.
Figure 4 shows a countermeasure example of a position
data camouÔ¨Çage act. We can detect the position information
that is being camouÔ¨Çaged at another base department using the
relay base station information in V2C communication.
E. Using Peripheral Vehicle Information in V2V Communica-
tion
Vehicles exchange VehicleIDs with nearby vehicles using
V2V communication. A vehicle views the other vehicles other
vehicles in the potential V2V communication area as periph-
eral vehicles. A VehicleID that is received from a peripheral

Figure 4. Advantage of using base station information
vehicle is regarded as peripheral vehicle information (PVID).
In our proposed technique, only VehicleID information is
exchanged by V2V communication.
When a vehicle sends its position information to a cloud,
the V2CVehicleID, its VehicleID, and the PVID are attached by
V2V communication. The PVID shows a guarantee that nearby
vehicles are in the V2V communication possible area. Figure
5 shows an example of peripheral vehicle information by
V2V communication. Vehicle A communicates with the others
vehicles in the area where V2V communication is possible
and acquires VehicleIDs from Vehicles C and D. Vehicle A
handles the acquired VehicleIDs as PVIDs and veriÔ¨Åes their
nearby position with peripheral Vehicles C and D.
Figure 6 shows a countermeasure example of a position
data camouÔ¨Çage act. We assume that a malicious vehicle
camouÔ¨Çaged its position information. The cloud conÔ¨Årms the
PVID sent with the position information from a vehicle,
and compares a vehicle‚Äôs position information that is rele-
vant to the PVID with the information of the vehicle that
transmitted. When comparing the position information that
is outside the possible V2V communication area, the cloud
determined that the received position information has been
camouÔ¨Çaged. However when the position information does

not exceed the area, the cloud trusts the received position
information. Vehicles acquire peripheral vehicle information
using V2V communication and mutually monitor it. This helps
the cloud detect camouÔ¨Çage data.
F. Detection Method of CamouÔ¨Çage Data With V2X Commu-
nication
Our proposed technique is a combination of the two
described above by using V2X communication (Figure 7).
The cloud receives not only the position and the VehicleID
information data but also the data attached to the peripheral
vehicles and the relay base station information monitored
mutually by V2X communication. CamouÔ¨Çage data can be
detected through these data, as described in Figure 8.
The V2CVehicleID is used in the Ô¨Årst step on Figure 8.
Next, we veriÔ¨Åed whether the data received by the cloud were
sent from a vehicle. Second, we compared the ViaBSID with
the position information of a transmission vehicle to conÔ¨Årm
whether it exists in the area covered by the relay base station.
When the position information of the transmission vehicle

Figure 8. CamouÔ¨Çage data detection procedure to a vehicle send data
exceeds the area covered by the relay base station, we assume
that consistency can‚Äôt be maintained, and that the position
information was authorized by camouÔ¨Çage data. A camouÔ¨Çage
act in another base department is stopped by this step. In
the third or fourth stage, camouÔ¨Çage data are detected based
on vehicle information near the transmission vehicle using
a PVID. The third step‚Äôs adjustment-lessness occurs when a
vehicle, which doesn‚Äôt exist around the transmitter, is regarded
as a peripheral vehicle. It isn‚Äôt possible to camouÔ¨Çage another
nearby vehicle because a mutual VehicleID exchanged for
peripheral vehicles by the V2V communication. The position
information of the data, which didn‚Äôt reach the prescriptive
number of times, or peripheral vehicles and the data which
couldn‚Äôt maintain consistency, are identiÔ¨Åed as camouÔ¨Çage at
the fourth stage. We can treat a location‚Äôs camouÔ¨Çage beyond
the possible V2V communication area and make the data more
credible by setting up speciÔ¨Åed execution count. The data,
which didn‚Äôt meet the condition, violates authorization and
cant‚Äôt be trusted in the second, third, or fourth stages.

detection method, we calculate the evaluation. And then we

A.
Simulator
In this paper, we used Scenargie [6] as a simulator to
evaluate the performance of our evaluation of the proposed
method. Scenargie is a network simulator developed by Space-
Time Engineering (STE). By combining expansion modules,
like LTE, V2V communication and, multi-agent simulation
can be constructed. In addition, since communication systems
and evaluation scenarios are becoming more complicated, this
ingenious simulation has greatly reduced the effort required to
create scenarios. Examples include GUI scenario creation, map
data, the graphical information display of a communication
system, and a radio wave propagation analysis function.
B.
Evaluation Model
For the evaluation environment, we used a 1 square kilo-
meter square Manhattan model and the simulation parameters
shown in Table II. We set the number of vehicles to 158 [cars]
and the range to 1 [km2] because the average car density
across Japan is 158 [cars/km2]. The ITU-R P.1411 model
is a radio wave propagation scheme that considers road map
information, and radio waves are attenuated based on the shape
of the road, so we compared our model with a two-ray model
using direct waves and reÔ¨Çected waves from the ground. This
model closely resembles reality.
C.
Evaluation of CamouÔ¨Çage Data Detection
Figure 9 shows the per-threshold detection rate of the
camouÔ¨Çaged data from data aggregated in a cloud server. A
camouÔ¨Çage data transmitted to a cloud could be detected at
100% by increasing the proposed method‚Äôs threshold. How-
ever, when the threshold was low, completely detecting all
of the incorrect data was impossible. The reason is shown in
Figs. 10 and 11. The former shows an example where location
information can be disguised in a possible range within a range
in which peripheral vehicles and the V2V communication
range are possible. In this case, since peripheral vehicles
guarantee camouÔ¨Çage information from a malicious vehicle,
camouÔ¨Çaging the position information becomes possible. Fig-
ure 11 show a collusion between malicious vehicles. Since
they guarantee mutual position camouÔ¨Çage information, there
are trying to fool the cloud into trusting the camouÔ¨Çage data.
In other words, this is an inadequate PVID to help with
data spooÔ¨Ång. These problems can be addressed by increasing
the prescribed number of times (threshold values) shown in
Figure 8. By increasing the threshold values, we can create
the situation shown in Figure 12 and it is possible to limit
deception by malicious vehicles.

D. Evaluation of Misdetection Rate
Figure 13 shows the false detection rate (false positives)
of the proposed method based on the average car density in
Japan. The method‚Äôs threshold is the amount of information
data of the peripheral vehicles that is necessary for a cloud
to trust the information. In the previous section, we found
that an increase in the threshold improves the detection rate
of the camouÔ¨Çage data. Here, we consider the false positive
detection rate, (false positive), regarding whether a cloud trusts
information on vehicles that are not conducting camouÔ¨Çage
activities. In the simulation environment shown in Table II,
Figure 13 shows that not all 158 cars are doing camouÔ¨Çage
acts and the false positives were measured. By increasing the
threshold value, the false detection rate improved. Increasing
the threshold value in the average Japanese vehicle density
erroneously detects normal communication as abnormal.
Therefore, the false positives under the average vehicle
density environment in Osaka, which has the highest average
car density in Japan, are indicated by Figure 14. In a high ve-

can be acquired by V2V communication, even if the threshold
is increased, an increase in the false detection rate can be
suppressed. Therefore, we found that the proposed method is
more effective in areas with high vehicle density. Actually, the
inÔ¨Çuence of camouÔ¨Çage acts of vehicle information is great
in areas with high vehicle density. The proposed method, can
guarantee that the information transmitted by vehicle to a cloud
is better in areas where more peripheral vehicles exist than in
areas with fewer peripheral vehicles. Our proposed method is

E. Measurement of Processing Time
In the evaluation environment shown in Table III, the
processing time necessary for the detection of camouÔ¨Çage
data is evaluated by Table IV, based on the detection method
of camouÔ¨Çage data in Figure 8. The processing time of one
vehicle is shown. By using BSIDs, camouÔ¨Çage data can be
detected at the beginning of the processing by the proposed
method, and the processing time becomes relatively fast. In the
detection method using PVIDs, the processing time is different
for each threshold. By increasing the threshold value, the
detection procedure of camouÔ¨Çage data by PVID is repeated.
Even during the repetition, since the processing time changes
depending on whether the comparative data can be found
relatively early or in the Ô¨Ånal stage, a range was set for the
processing time up to Step 4. A case where no camouÔ¨Çage
data is not detected is deÔ¨Åned as normal termination and
the upper limit of the processing time at that threshold is
indicated. As the threshold of the proposed method increases,
the processing time required for normal termination increases.
We must determine the threshold values based on the V2C
communication delay and the allowable range of the delay
times of safe driving support systems.
V.
CONCLUSION
In the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), using a cloud
server is inevitable. For providing a safe driving support
service using a cloud, camouÔ¨Çaging vehicle information and
spooÔ¨Ång a vehicle are threatening. In this research, we used
V2X communication, obtained information from various ob-
jects, and described measures against vehicle spooÔ¨Ång. We
proposed a method that detects camouÔ¨Çage data from the
information transmitted by vehicles to a cloud. By using the
information of a relay base station in V2C communication and
the peripheral vehicle information using V2V communication,
measures are taken against camouÔ¨Çaging vehicle information.
By increasing the proposed method‚Äôs threshold, the detection
rate of camouÔ¨Çage data was improved and vehicle information
was made more reliable. Our proposed method can be adapted
to depopulated regions by changing the amount of the data of
peripheral vehicle information required as the detection rate
improves based on car density. In overcrowded vehicle ares,
we conÔ¨Årmed that our proposed method is the most effective.
