Abstract— Modern methods of analytical chemistry are based
on
the
measurement
and
processing
of
two-
up
to
multidimensional signals. Multidimensional analytical signals
include the responses of multisensory systems, such as artificial
“nose, tongue, eyes”. The purpose of this work is to develop
software for personal diagnostic devices “electronic nose” with
the possibility of clinical diagnosis of humans and animals by
easily renewable selected biosamples. A program has been
developed as a native Android application written in a high-
level Java language, designed to interact with the electronic
nose device. For the analysis of signals received from an array
of 8 sensors, two algorithms have been developed. Analysis of
the measurement is carried out on a complete data matrix
which is generated when registering sensor signals over the
skin of a person’s hand or over a biosample. When processing
the output data of the sensor, the most informative parameters
about the health state of the body, individual organs and
systems are obtained. Based on these parameters, visual smell
traces are constructed by the sensor signals. The developed
software personalizes the diagnosis of the health state of the
human or animal using multisensory systems like electronic
nose, and displays information in an understandable form to
an untrained user. This makes it possible to use such devices
for personal purposes, on small farms, therefore, to prevent the
development of complex diseases, the death of livestock, and to
improve the quality of life.

INTRODUCTION
Modern methods of analytical chemistry are based on the
measurement and processing of two- up to multidimensional
signals. Multidimensional analytical signals include the
responses of multisensor systems, such as artificial “nose,
tongue, eyes”.
The purpose of this work is to develop software for
personal diagnostic devices “electronic nose” with the
possibility of clinical diagnosis of humans and animals by
volatile metabolome of body or biosample [1].
Section 2 presents some state-of-the-art methods for
processing and visualizing the signals from the multisensory
systems. Section 3 describes the processing and visualizing
features of sensor signals and the code of the proposed
program. In Section 4, the conclusions and perspectives of
the developed program application are provided.

STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS
Currently available scientific developments of mobile
applications for processing different information regarding
health
problems
can
be
found
in
[2]-[4].
All
such
applications have basic diagnostic information, but there is
no online connecting with a device based on sensors for non-
invasive screening of health state. The final stage of our
development
will
be
a
cloud
service
with
artificial
intelligence technology to provide complete information to
customers about their health condition and tips for improving
it.
III.
DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM
This program is written in a high-level Java language
(Figure 1) as Android application, designed to interact with
the electronic nose (e-nose) device and it is based on
previous our works [5][6]. For the analysis of signals
received from an array of 8 sensors, two algorithms have
been
developed.
The
first
one
allows
getting
the
measurement results in a way that is understandable to any
user. Initial processing of the measurement results is carried
out by the maximum sensor responses, which forms a health
state diagram (sphere), constructed based on the calculated
data. Figure 1 shows a fragment of a software algorithm for
assigning color to a sector in accordance with the values of
sorption efficiency parameters calculated from the maximum
sensor responses.

Fragment of a program about classes that work with the model
data
The numerical boundaries of the reference values were
determined experimentally for each sorption efficiency
parameter. Depending on the interval in which the calculated
parameters fall, certain comments about the health state of
the body or about the volatile substances contained in the
analyzed sample, are displayed. The program allows using
the simplest responses of the sensor array in electronic nose
to calculate a set of parameters that reflects the health state of
both individual organs in the human body and the psycho-
emotional sphere. Each calculation parameter is assigned
numerical thresholds, text decoding, and color gamut, when
the
calculated
value
corresponds
to
certain
semantic
numerical ranges. It is possible to manually enter the values
of the sensor signals (Figure 2a), as well as from the database
of the e-nose for 2 measurements simultaneously with the
possibility of averaging the calculated parameters. These 2
measurements may be the analysis results for one sample or
for different ones.

Program dialog windows with text and graphical information as
well as results of the comparison of two measurements for left and right
forearm (a) and for average measurement with norm (b) – The green sector
represents the normal health values for parameters included in the
diapazon, while yellow and red represent deviations from norm.
The program provides processing as well as presentation
of data for individual measurement and for averages as
separate recordings in the dialog window of the program
(Figure 2b). The decoding of the health state of the organism
corresponding to the color scheme of each parameter is
displayed on the screen together with a full set of calculated
parameters in the form of a sphere, where each parameter
corresponds to a separate sector (Figure 3 b). It is envisaged
to save all data entered, calculated, and visualized (data
measurement) to the database on a personal device.
A complete set of data is generated when registering
sensor signals for 80 s of sorption and 120 s for desorption
volatile substances excreted by the skin of a person’s hand or
by a biosample (for example, nasal mucus of cattle). When
processing
the
output
data
of
the
sensor,
the
most
informative parameters about the health state of the body,
individual organs and systems are obtained. Based on these
parameters, visual smell traces are constructed by the sensor
signals.
The use of adaptive, high-level Java language provides
high availability for users via Google Play Market. The
proposed mobile application can describe more than 17
health conditions, including tiredness, stress, weakness,
endocrine gland disorders, non-numeric level of glucose etc.,
due
to
connecting
with
portable
e-nose
based
on
piezoelectric sensors. Thus, the developed software surpasses
modern world analogues in many parameters.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The developed software personalizes the diagnosis of the
health state of the human or animal using multisensory
systems and displays the information in an understandable
form to an untrained user. This makes it possible to use such
devices for personal purposes, on small farms, therefore, to
