Abstract—In today's world, where positioning applications 
reached a huge popularity and became virtually ubiquitous, 
there is a strong need for determining a device location as 
accurately as possible. A particularly important role in 
positioning play cellular networks, such as Long Term 
Evolution (LTE). In the LTE Observed Time Difference of 
Arrival (OTDOA) positioning method, precision of device 
location estimation depends on accuracy of the Positioning 
Reference 
Signal 
(PRS) 
first-path 
detection, 
what 
is 
particularly challenging in multipath environment. There are a 
few algorithms, available in the literature, that are dedicated to 
detect the first-path of PRS signals, often basing on estimation 
of the strongest path or which do not adapt to continuously 
changing environmental conditions. The paper presents a new 
algorithm, called First-Path Estimator (FPE), which detects 
the first path of received PRS signal in the LTE system. 
Simulations showed that proposed algorithm reduces Received 
Signal Time Difference (RSTD) measurement error compared 
to the well-known Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) in 
urban scenario.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Long Term Evolution (LTE) system specification driven 
by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) consortium 
[1] defines several methods for positioning, i.e., locating of 
mobile terminals in the network coverage area. These 
methods may be particularly useful in harsh environments 
such as densely populated urban areas or indoor locations, 
where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) [2][3] 
are not working with accuracy demanded for some 
applications. One of the specified method is Observed Time 
Difference of Arrival (OTDoA) [4][5], for which special 
reference signals, called Positioning Reference Signals 
(PRS) 
[6], 
were 
defined. 
The 
OTDoA 
bases 
on 
measurements of the reception time differences between PRS 
signals arriving from multiple base stations to the User 
Equipment 
(UE). 
These 
measurements, 
along 
with 
knowledge of the geographical coordinates of the measured 
base stations and their relative timing, allow for estimation of 
the UE location in the network. Despite the frequency reuse 
factor in LTE  equals one, transmissions of the PRS signals 
take place with frequency reuse factor of six in order to 
avoid near-far effect. In time domain, PRS signals are 
located on so-called positioning occasions, which are 
periodically repeating. Every positioning occasion consists 
of the set of consecutive PRS subframes. Furthermore, it is 
possible  to  mute  PRS  transmission  in  chosen  positioning

occasion, what, with scalable bandwidth of PRS signals, 
gives a sophisticated tool for flexible management of radio 
resources. The PRS signal main parameters are shown in 
Table I [7].  
Accuracy of UE positioning in OTDOA depends mainly 
on PRS signals time of arrival estimation accuracy, therefore 
it is crucial to detects PRS reception time as precisely as 
possible. In this paper, new Time Delay Estimation (TDE) 
algorithm, called First-Path Estimator (FPE), detecting the 
first path of PRS signal, is proposed. The aim of its 
elaboration is to fulfill the requirements imposed by 3GPP 
on the accuracy of UE location estimation [8].  
There are several algorithms available in the literature 
that detect arriving signal, e.g., Maximum Likelihood 
Estimator (MLE) or Fitz estimator [7]. The MLE algorithm 
detects the strongest path in the received signal, what may 
causes large errors in multipath environments, where in 
majority of cases the first arriving signal path is not the 
strongest one. The Fitz estimator is a low complex algorithm 
that moves signal reception time estimation into frequency 
domain. Its performance is close to the MLE in terms of 
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of time of signal arrival 
estimation. Another worth to mention algorithm is an 
estimator that detects the first arriving signal by the first 
occurrence of signal level above a -30 dB detection threshold 
relative to the strongest peak in the Power Delay Profile 
(PDP). If the dynamic range of the PDP is less than 30 dB, 
the first occurrence of signal level above the noise floor in 
PDP is used [9]. This algorithm however, does not adjust 
threshold to the noise floor, what may results in errors of first 
path detection in different power of noise relative to the 
power of arriving signal scenarios. FPE algorithm adjusts 
dynamically threshold accordingly to the ratio of signal 
power to noise power, what makes it more precise in the 
estimation of the first path time of arrival. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes MLE and proposed FPE estimator. Section III 
gives an overview on simulation model and section IV 
presents results of the simulations. At the end of the paper 
conclusions were drawn.

II. 
TIME DELAY ESTIMATION ALGORITHMS 
Time delay estimation algorithms, with regard to 
positioning process in LTE, are in charge of reception time 
measurements of the PRS signals, performing in order to 
calculate the Received Signal Time Difference (RSTD) 
value. RSTD defined by 3GPP in [10] is a parameter 
specifying the relative timing difference between the 
neighbour cell j and the reference cell i and is defined as  

SubframeRxi
SubframeRxj
T
T
RSTD
 
 



where 
TSubframeRxj
  is the time when the user equipment 
receives the start of one subframe containing PRS signal 
from cell j and 
TSubframeRxi
  is the time when the UE receives 
the corresponding start of one subframe (also containing 
PRS signal) from cell i that is the closest in time to subframe 
received from cell j.  
Among 
other 
things, 
accuracy 
of 
the 
RSTD 
measurements depends on the size of search window, where 
the TDE algorithm searches for the desired signals. LTE 
system provides a tool for prior estimation of the expected 
RSTD and expected RSTD uncertainty values, both 
determining a search window for PRS signals. Properly 
evaluated search window is necessary for accurate estimation 
of the position in time of PRS signals receiving from 
neighbour base stations. Generally, the smaller the search 
window, the more accurate estimation could be performed. 
Referring to the Fig. 1, minimal and maximal values of 
RSTD can be evaluated as [11]:

B. Proposed First - Path Estimator 
Proposed First-Path Estimator searches for the first path 
in the receiving signal through analyzing the correlation 
between receiving PRS signal and signal pattern stored in the 
memory. Algorithm, using knowledge about parameters of 
the highest correlation peak and all correlation peaks that lies 
before the highest one, significantly reduces search window 
and chooses from the new window the first peak, assuming 
that it correspond to the first path of the received signal. 
The problem of detecting the first path in the correlation 
function is to set the threshold above which it may be 
assumed that detected peaks corresponds to the paths of the 
useful signal. Setting too low threshold 
THRlow
 (Fig. 2) 
induces detection of peak P1, which does not represent path 
of the useful signal. On the other hand, setting too high

 causes that peak detector misses the first 
path, in the worst case, becomes MLE estimator.  
Therefore, it is necessary to find an appropriate value 
THROk
, which is done here through the estimation of the 
difference between maximum value of the correlation 
function and the mean value of all peaks that lies before this 
maximum value.  
In order to find an estimate of the first path, algorithm 
firstly evaluate position

 and value

peak in the correlation function

minimize RSTD measurement error.

SIMULATION MODEL 
In the implemented simulation model, UE performs 
RSTD measurements between subframes containing PRS 
signals transmitted from two base stations. In order to 
receive reference signals, UE firstly synchronizes with the 
reference cell using Primary Synchronization Signals (PSS) 
and then is informed about expected RSTD and expected 
RSTD uncertainty values, which determine position and size 
of the search window for PRS signals. In the prior RSTD 
value estimation process, the distance between eNodeBref 
and UE is estimated through TA measurements. Due to an 
inaccuracy of timing advance measurements, measured 
distance 
dTA
 is a random variable described by:

A. Base station model 
For the purposes of the present simulations, physical 
layer of the implemented base station model consists of 
blocks creating PRS and PSS signals. Extract of transmitted

subframe, PSS signal is transmitted in order obtain coarse 
synchronization between transmitter and receiver. In the 
second one PRS signals are placed.

C. User equipment model 
Determining the position of PRS signals in time is 
preceded by cell synchronization process. It is assumed that 
UE and base stations are fully synchronized in frequency 
domain. The first action undertaken by the UE is to search 
for PSS signal in samples of the received signal. Finding of 
PSS signal allows to determine the position of time-
frequency 
signal 
structure 
and 
ensure 
coarse 
synchronization. Cell synchronization is performed by 
maximum likelihood estimator which finds PSS position 𝑚0 
in time [18]:

symbols are correlated with the known pattern in the receiver 
and time position of PRS signal is determined on the basis of 
a given algorithm.

SIMULATION RESULTS  
Simulations were carried out in compliance with the 
conditions specified by 3GPP for RSTD measurements 
accuracy requirements [8]. The main parameters of the 
simulation is presented in Table III, where (PRS Es/Iot)ref 
and (PRS Es/Iot)nei are ratios of received energy per 
Resource Element (RE) during the useful part of the symbol 
to received power spectral density of the total noise and 
interference for a certain RE, respectively for PRS signals 
transmitted from reference and neighbour base station. 
During the simulations, mean RSTD measurement error and 
number of trials that satisfy requirements given by 3GPP was 
evaluated. Mean RSTD measurement error is given by

Table IV. LOC% is a percentage of trials number which falls 
into the requirements of RSTD measurements accuracy 
imposed by 3GPP [8]. For 5 and 10 MHz bandwidth and 1 
ms duration of PRS signal the required accuracy is

respectively. The use of the FPE estimator 
significantly reduces mean RSTD error compared to the 
MLE estimator.

This  improvement may be even higher at longer distances 
between base stations and mobile terminal due to larger rms 
time delay spread of receiving signals. It should be noticed 
that gain from using FPE estimator is obtained only when it 
is possible to separate more than one path of the received 
signal in the correlation function of received signal and 
pattern stored in the receiver. This could be done only if 
bandwidth of PRS signal is sufficiently large relating to the 
delays of consecutive signal paths arriving to the receiver. 
The larger the PRS signal bandwidth is, the narrower 
autocorrelation function of PRS signal becomes and the 
greater possibilities in extracting distinct received signal 
paths from correlation function. Further assessments 
showed that for 1.4 MHz bandwidth of PRS signals, it is not 
possible to distinguish any two paths of receiving PRS 
signals in the correlation function due to small mutual delay 
between consecutive signal paths. It means that for 1.4 MHz 
PRS bandwidth, use of FPE algorithm does not improve 
accuracy of RSTD measurements. Therefore, for such small 
bandwidth it is justified to use MLE algorithm due to its 
smaller processing consumption.  
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A new First-Path Estimator FPE was proposed for 
detecting the first path in receiving PRS signal. Simulations 
have shown that it significantly reduces RSTD measurement 
error in urban environment, comparing to the well-known 
Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Moreover, it ensures that 
about 80% of RSTD measurement falls into accuracy range 
defined by 3GPP for 5 and 10 MHz PRS bandwidth, 
becoming a reliable tool for positioning purposes.
