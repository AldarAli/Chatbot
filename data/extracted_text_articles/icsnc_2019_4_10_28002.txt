Abstract—In collective decision-making where several partici-
pants involved to agree on one selection, reaching the consensus
among them is important but it is challenging when the par-
ticipants have conﬂicting interests. Therefore, the inﬂuence that
is based on the trust from one participant to another could be
useful to make the others shift their interests to be similar to
others. Shifting interest can be long term or short term depending
on participants behaviors. In our decision-making framework,
there are different rounds where participants interact by ratings.
Each round creates a rating matrix. In this paper, we study the
rating convergence by analyzing the rating matrix changes by
measuring its perturbations in each round and ﬁnd the effect
of these changes on reaching the consensus when using a trust
and without it. We built a simulation that generates several
decision scenarios. Our result showed that the changes in the
rating matrix under the trust improve reaching the consensus in
term of decreasing the required number of round and increasing
the consensus value. Moreover, our result showed that changing
interest in a long term performs better than short term in term
of number or rounds reduction.

INTRODUCTION
In the decision-making process where several stakehold-
ers involved, we need a mechanism to reach an agreement
speciﬁcally when the stakeholders have conﬂicting interests.
In general, the humans’ nature gives them the tendency to
decide rationally by selecting the decision that gives them the
maximum satisfaction according to the Rational Choice Theory
[1]. However, in reality, people might have different interest.
Therefore, relying on rationality makes reaching a consensus
decision to be challenging [2]. As a result, the stakeholders
could use the inﬂuence on each other using the assumption of
the Social Inﬂuence Theory [3] to make their interest similar
and in turn reach the consensus. In our existing trusted-based
decision-making framework [4], the trust of the stakeholder is
used to inﬂuence the others. The higher the trust the higher
the reputation of the stakeholder. As a result, any stakeholder
with a high reputation could inﬂuence the others in term of
recommending decisions or even changing their interests [5].
Changing the interest can be short term or long term [2]. In
this work, the short-term change of interest is done locally
during the negotiation in each round but does not affect the
future choices. The long-term change of interest is done in a
way that affects the stakeholder current and future choices.
In multi-stakeholder consensus decision-making, there is
a network of stakeholders who might or might not inﬂuence
one another. They meet, propose solutions and modify them
in several rounds to reach a solution that suits everyone.
During these rounds, the stakeholders rate each other to declare
their opinions regarding the proposed solutions and these
ratings can later be translated to trust. As a result, due to the
involvement of humans who interact during the negotiation,
trust among them comes into the picture. Trust provides many
beneﬁts, such as extra information through the impression the
stakeholders develop of each other over time in a particular
context, which helps to reach the consensus [6]. Also, trust
indicates the interests similarity among stakeholders. As a
result, the stakeholders’ reputations can be obtained from the
trust. The more ratings, the better because they increase the
amount of information available about the stakeholders. The
longer the history, the better because it increases the chances
of having more ratings. The fact of having the stakeholders
come from different backgrounds, hold different expertise and
not to mention the conﬂicting objectives makes the consensus
decision-making to be challenging.
In this paper, we aim to study the rating convergence of
our proposed decision-making framework [4] by studying the
rating matrix perturbation. The consensus is achieved when
either all the stakeholders propose the same solution or they
all give the maximum rating to one solution. The trust is
an inﬂuencer factor that lead the stakeholders to adjust their
selections based on the trustworthy stakeholders guides. Such
inﬂuences may affect the rating behavior, as well as changing
their initial interests they have in a way to be similar to the
highly trusted stakeholders.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we list the
existing related works. Then, we show our trust model and the
generic decision-making framework in Sections III and IV. In
Section V, we address rating convergence measurement. After
that, we explain the experimental setup and results in sections
VI and VII. Finally, in Section VIII, we conclude the paper.

RELATED WORK
Interactions among stakeholders when they make a collec-
tive decision is important since they negotiate while they are
seeking for a solution to choose. In decision-making frame-
work that uses machines to moderate the stakeholder negotia-
tions, the interaction could be rating or even written comment
to express the others opinion regarding the individuals choices
and preferences [7]–[9]. Such notion of preferences occurs in
decision-making ﬁeld [2]. The individuals’ preferences can be
changed over the time due to the changes in the interests.

Those interests change can be a result of the inﬂuence by the
others [6], the choices made before or even other factors that
are based on the individuals situation at the time of making
selection. Several studies showed that the individual interest
and preferences are changing [5] [6] [10]–[15] and these study
are different in term of the causes that lead changing the
preferences. In [12], they predicted the changes in preferences
based on the feedback of the negotiation process. Hansson
[13] presented the dominant theories of belief change that
may be called input-assimilating models. They expressed how
the subject’s belief state is transformed upon assimilation of
an input. In addition to the different factors that change the
individuals’ preferences, the choices proposed while making
a decision may affect the preferences or in other word, it
shapes them [15]. Babajide and et al. [6] explained the change
in the initial preference of an individual to match the others
choices, either through coercion from others or selection by
the individual team member. Preferences changes can be short
or long term [2] [5] [16] [17]. Short term preferences affect the
current choices while negotiating but the long term one affects
the choices in the future. In social psychology ﬁeld where
they study the peoples’ behavior, there are different theories
that predict the preferences changes. For example, dissonance
theory [10] [18] [19] motivates individuals to change their
preferences to match their prior decision that can be a result
of a selection they made in the past based on inﬂuence.
III.
TRUST
In reference to Alfantoukh and et al. [4], trust is a result
of meeting expectations in a particular context. Therefore,
there is no universal deﬁnition of trust because it is context-
dependent [20]. We may represent trust as the level of an
individual’s agreement with a proposed solution due to the
interests associated with it. We model trust by using the
solution ratings during the agreement. Trust can be classiﬁed as
local trust and global trust. Global trust is modeled by using all
the historical interactions between any two individuals, which
creates the stakeholders’ reputations that can be used as a
weight to inﬂuence other decisions. The local trust consists of
current negotiation interactions between any stakeholders and
it is used for updating the global trust. We have proposed a trust
system based on the measurement theory [21]–[30]. This trust
system has three stages: trust modeling, trust management,
and decision making. The quantiﬁcation of trust has been
taken care of in the trust modeling and management phases.
In our trust system, we deﬁne two metrics, impression and
conﬁdence, as continuous values in [0, 1]. The impression
m shows the stakeholder’s usefulness by evaluating his/her
decision. Every two stakeholders have several interactions at
different times, which lead to a distribution of their impressions
of each other M = {m1, m2, . . . , mk}. The impression value
is the mean of the distributions (1). The other metric, conﬁ-
dence c, shows the degree of certainty about the judgments.
The conﬁdence of the judgment is obtained by knowing how
far away from the real impression the stakeholder can be (2),
where r is equivalent to the square root of the standard error.

MULTI-STAKEHOLDER DECISION-MAKING MODEL
BASED ON TRUST AND RISK
We
have
designed
a
generic
framework
for
multi-
stakeholder decision making based on trust and risk that
produces a decision agreed upon by the participants [4]. In
this framework, the stakeholders negotiate with each other by
5-star rating to declare their agreement regarding the other
solutions. The process starts with the stakeholder proposing
their solutions that have corresponding interest value is calcu-
lated by the utility function. This utility function is context-
dependent. The trust relationship among stakeholders construct
the network of them. Those trust values form the reputation of
the stakeholders. The trust is computed by our existing trust
system [4] [21]–[29] that is based on measurement theory.
Next, the stakeholders rate each other to declare their opinions
of the proposed solutions. Then, the Group Decision making
Model (GDM) entity aggregates those ratings. After that, the
aggregated rating values of the solutions are ranked descend-
ingly. The consensus level is obtained by the aggregated rating
values. Therefore, the top value should have a value higher
than or equal to a threshold value to indicate that consensus
is achieved. Otherwise, a new round will start.
A. Rating
If we assume that the rating system is 5-star rating and
stakeholder a rates stakeholder b, then the rating will depend
on how far the a’s interest of its own decision from the interest
he gets from what b proposed. If b’s decision give more interest
to a than what a’s proposed then the rating is the maximum,
5 stars. Otherwise, we consider the differences between the
interest of decision proposed by a and the interest of decision
proposed by b. The larger the difference the lower the rating
and vice versa. Therefore, to compute the star rating associated
with the difference, it requires to transform the difference value
range (diff) to 5-star value range. diff range is [0,1] and the
start range is [0,5]. However, since the larger difference means
lower rating, we need to ﬁnd the transformation function,
f(diff), from [1,0] to [0,5], meaning to ﬁnd value rate in
[0,5] associated with value diff in [1,0]. If we assume the
function to be linear, we may use the afﬁne transformation
function to ﬁnd the rating from the differences. Using the afﬁne
transformation function, we can calculate the rating using (3)
f(diff) = 5 ∗ (1 − diff)
(3)
B. Aggregation
The outcome of the rating’s phase is the rating matrix.
Suppose that there is a set of stakeholders, S, a set of decisions,
D, and a set of corresponding trust values for each stakeholder.
The stakeholders rate each other as represented in matrix R.
In this matrix, the element rij represents the rating from
stakeholder i to stakeholder j regarding j’s proposed solution.
Each stakeholder has an assigned trust value represented in
the vector T. The sum of the trust values is W. The rating
weighted average operator is RWA and computed by using
R, T and (4). Here, the trust T is used to weigh the ratings.
The outcome is a vector of consensus degrees corresponding
to the proposed solutions. The selected decision is the decision
with the maximum consensus degree, which is later compared
to consensus threshold to check the consensus achievement.

RATING CONVERGENCE MEASUREMENT
As we indicated before, our framework generates rating
matrices during the negotiation, the more the ratings the larger
the magnitude of the matrices. Matrix norm can be used to
measure the rating matrices magnitude and then use it to ﬁnd
the perturbations. For example, the Frobenius norm [31] can be
used for calculating the ratings matrix norm by computing the
square root of the sum of the absolute squares of each rating in
the matrix. Suppose, the rating matrix is M and has elements
rij, which each rij represents the rating from stakeholder ri
to the decision proposed by rj and n is the number of decision
makers, the Frobenius norm is computed by (5)
∥ M ∥F =

| rij |2
(5)
The matrix norm shows how big the matrix is. Therefore, if
the ratings become higher in every round then the matrix norm
becomes larger than the previous round. Larger norms is an
indicator of the ratings convergence to the consensus degree
level. Our interpretation is that trust is an important factor to
inﬂuence the stakeholders which leads to increase the matrix
norm. To ﬁnd the matrix perturbations, we use the difference
of norms between the current round and the previous one.
Supposed that there are three stakeholders s1, s2 and s3 and
three consensus degree values c1, c2 and c3 stored in consensus
vector, c respectively. The rating matrix R stores all the rating
for one round.

Let’s assume there is a vector,x, of x1,x2 and x3 which has a

r12x1 + r22x2 + r32x3 = c2
r13x1 + r23x2 + r33x3 = c3
We can write the linear system above as:

EXPERIMENT
1) Experiment objective: The aim of the experiment is to
study the ratings changes when several stakeholders want to
make a decision and study the effect of the trust on those rating
changes. Such an effect can be examined through the number
of required rounds, the consensus degree average in each
round, and the consensus achievements. We have designed
and implemented a simulation to generate decision-making
scenarios. We used a Netbeans framework with java language
to build the simulation software. We created a database using
derby and then linked it to the java program to store the data.
2) Experiment setup: In this experiment, we selected ﬁve
users for each case of the interest overlap. So, for full overlap
interests, we assigned IDs from 1 to 5 to stakeholder, for no
overlap interests, we assigned IDs from 6 to 10 and ﬁnally
for semi overlap, we assigned IDs from 11 to 15. Then, for
each user, we stored the interest vales which is the rating
he/she gives. For each interest overlap scenario, we created ﬁve
samples and each sample has 200 selection project. Also, these
projects were generated one time with trust and one without.
Therefore, the total projects generated for each samples were
1200 projects. Additionally, we generated these projects under
two assumptions: one with long term interest and the other is
short term. Table I shows the parameter setup.

RESULTS
In this section, we show the result of the decision making
simulation. In this light, we present the stakeholders selections
movement during the negotiation for one of the generated
project of the no overlap case. Our evaluation criteria are
changes of the rating norm, the consensus degree convergence,
number of rounds and the correlation between the rating matrix
perturbation and the number of rounds.
Figure 1 shows the stakeholders decisions movement for a
project that took 5 rounds to reach the consensus. In round 0
(Figure 1(a)), all the stakeholders proposed different decisions.
In round 1 (Figure 1(b)), stakeholder 6 changed his decision
to be similar to stakeholder 10. In round 2 (Figure 1(c)),
stakeholders 7 and 9 selected decisions closer to 6 and 10. In
round 3 (Figure 1(d)), stakeholder 9 selected a new decisions
closer to 6,7 and 10. Round 4 (Figure 1(e)) is similar to round
3. In round 5 (Figure 1(f)), stakeholder 8 changed his decision
to be similar to the rest. Therefore, the consensus was achieved.
Table II shows the percentage of the projects that reached
consensus. Our result showed that applying the trust helped on
increasing the consensus achievement. Moreover, the long term
preferences performed better than short term. Similarly with
the number of rounds (Table III). Table IV shows the rating
matrix norm values and the consensus degree for the same
project. The rating norm and the consensus kept increasing.
Figure 2 presents the changes in the rating matrix norm
during negotiations. When considering trust, 82% of the inter-
actions had the norm increased, 2% no change and 16% was
decrease. However, without trust, the norm never increased
neither decreased and it remained unchanged. Figure 3 presents
the number of rounds for each project with trust for short-

noticed that the number of round for no overlap and semi

be decreased with trust and it is more decreasing for long-term
preference compared with short-term preferences. The matrix
perturbation has an effect on the number of round as there is
a moderate negative correlation, -0.45. So, when the average

From the results, we found that:
•
Trust helps the stakeholders to reach the consensus
when conﬂicting interest exists by the inﬂuence from
the highly trusted participants.
•
Trust increases the rating matrix norm in most of the
cases. Increase the norm means increasing the rating
which leads to increase the consensus degree.
•
Trust helps changing the preferences whether long-
term or short term. Changing the preference in the
long run helps to decrease the number of rounds later,
•
Trust helps decreasing the number of project rounds
except few cases, such as when a trusted participant
has his decision liked by the others and then he
changes his opinion frequently for the coming rounds.
•
Trust helps to increase the rating changes which leads
to increase the rating norm and the matrix perturba-
tion.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

Figure 3. Number of rounds in each project for all the three overlap cases
among them is important but it is challenging when the
participants have conﬂicting interests. The inﬂuence among
them can help to eliminate this challenge. Such an inﬂuence
can be obtained from trust of one participant to another. The
trust is useful in changing the participants preferences whether
it is a long or short term depending on participants behaviors.
In this study, we apply our decision making framework that is
based on trust for investigating the rating convergence during
negotiation. We used the matrix norm as a measurement for
obtaining the magnitude of the rating matrices and then ﬁnd the
perturbation accordingly. The larger the magnitude the more
chances to reach the consensus. Our result showed that the
changes in the rating matrix under the trust improve reaching
the consensus in term of decreasing the required number of
round and increasing the consensus value. Also, our result
showed that changing interest in a long term performs better
than short term in term of number or rounds reduction. More-
over, we found that there is a negative moderate correlation
between the matrix perturbation and the number of round
needed to reach consensus. For future work, we will validate
the rating convergence measurement in a real application.
