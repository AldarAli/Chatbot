Abstract—The efficiency of designated bus lanes is very
differentiated. This is an effect of the influence of many
disturbing
factors
and
the
lack
of
determination
and
consequence in privileging buses. Problems are mostly seen on
the approaches to junctions equipped with traffic signals. In
this paper, the factors influencing onto bus running conditions
on the designated lanes were classified, as well as the model of
bus traffic disturbances at approaches to junctions with traffic
signals. The partial elements of the model (e.g., queue clearing
time, stopping time in bus lane at approach to junction) were
estimated with regression models using. Also, the methods of
reducing losses of bus travel time at approaches to junctions
were presented. Finally, the micro simulation of bus running
time at approaches to junctions with traffic signals in different
traffic
conditions
were
executed.
Was
proved
that
the
reduction of queues in bus lanes may be achieved through
shortening the section of the bus lane which is open for vehicles
taking a right turn or through the separation of additional,
external traffic lane for turning right vehicles, off the bus lane.

INTRODUCTION
Designated bus lanes belong to a group of efficient
measures designed to privilege public transport vehicles.
Agrawal, Goldman and Hannaford [1] described a large set
of advantages for the adoption of designated bus lanes. Bus
travel conditions are significantly better in dedicated lanes
than in lanes used by other vehicles. Dedicated lanes enable
attaining higher travel speeds, favor improved punctuality
and regular bus runs [2]. Thus, they boost the attractiveness
of the public transport, which translates into an increased
number of passengers travelling by buses using dedicated
traffic lanes. They help in better bus routing (Molecki, [3])
and strongly increase the capacity of the whole public
transport systems, as described by Fernandez and Planzer
[4]. However, even upon dedicating a traffic lane, the
preservation of consistent, beneficial travel conditions for
buses is impossible in many cases. Schedule speeds in the
aforementioned
segments
are
significantly
higher
than
speeds which would be attained if bus lanes were absent and
buses travelled in open-access lanes among other vehicles. It
would be expected that average schedule speeds, even in a
section so greatly encumbered with public transport vehicle
traffic, should at least amount to 20 [km/h]. Therefore, we
should ponder upon the causes – specifically, what are the
factors disturbing bus traffic in dedicated lanes and how can
they be prevented. A simulation approach can be very
helpful in solving such problems. Micro simulation models
describing bus movement on designated bus lanes were
presented in [5], [6] and [7].
In Section 2, we present the factors influencing buses
running on the sections with designated bus lanes. In Section
3, we present the model of bus traffic disturbances at
approaches to junctions with traffic signals. Sections 4 and 5
explain the results of estimations of queue clearing time and
queue motion time. Section 6 presents the methods of
reducing bus time losses at approaches to signalized
junctions. In Section 7, an example of possible simulation
results
is
presented.
Finally,
Section
8
presents
the
conclusion of the paper.

DISTURBANCES IN SECTIONS EQUIPPED WITH BUS
LANES
Running
time
of
buses
was
considered
in
many
publications, e.g., by Diab and El-Geneidy [8]. Bus traffic
disturbances result from a complex influence of many
factors, which more or less affect bus travel times, also in
sections with dedicated bus lanes. Many of the factors are of
random nature and these factors are greatly responsible for
travel disturbances. These are:

Factors related to traffic in dedicated bus lanes – this
is a group of factors with the highest influence on
bus travel conditions within sections, junctions and
bus stops: the size, the variability and the structure of
traffic volumes of buses and other vehicles (taxis and
other vehicles authorized to use the lane), the size,
the variability and the structure of traffic volumes of
vehicles using the lane at the approach to a junction
in order to take a right turn.

Behavioral factors encompassing behaviors of all
road users including bus drivers (driving skills,
discipline, psychophysical characteristics), caused by
the size of the current advancement or delay in
reference to the time table – motivating towards a
slower or a faster bus driving.


Environmental factors, among which are: season,
daytime, day type, atmospheric conditions.
Additionally, disturbances on sections with bus lanes
may result from factors of a directly deterministic nature,
which themselves are not sources of disturbance; on the
contrary, they represent solutions, whose goal was to aid the
operation of bus transport. The influence of deterministic
factors on bus travel disturbances results, most often, from
either insufficient range and consistency in implementing
particular infrastructural solutions or their low resistance to
intensified activity of random factors. Disturbances may also
result from a traffic organization which is insufficiently
promoting public transport vehicles and from incorrect
planning of services. Deterministic factors may be generally
classified as follows:

Factors related to the infrastructure of designated bus
lanes, such as: the width and the length of the
section, the scope and the manner of separation from
open-access lanes (use of markings or, additionally,
physical separation e.g., green lane, concrete or
plastic separators).

Factors related to other elements of the infrastructure
of streets with designated bus lanes: the number of
traffic lanes in the street section, the amount of
junctions with and without traffic signals, the
number
and
location
of
designated
pedestrian
crossings.

Factors related to the infrastructure of junctions and
bus stops located within bus lanes, such as: the type
of the traffic organization at junctions, the manner of
conduct of conflict-point maneuvers, the number of
traffic lanes (especially at the approach), the location
of the stop (near side or far side the junction area),
the occurrence of stop lines and possibly the distance
between the line and the bus-stop shelter, the
position of the stopping position in relation to the
face of the stop, the amount of stands and their
location, the width of the side platform, the location
of neighboring pedestrian crossings.

Factors related to the traffic organization, especially
at approaches to junctions: the manner of the traffic
organization at the junction, including the type of
control, the scope and the form of assigning
priorities in traffic signals, the quality of signaling,
the dedicated traffic lane availability monitoring.

Factors related to the transit organization, including:
the frequency of bus runs and other public transport
vehicles, the level of viability of time tables, the
scale
and
the
scope
of
dispatch
control;
the
frequency of inspections checking the quality of
transit services, the form of ticket distribution (an
on-board ticket machine, tickets sold by the driver).

Rolling stock factors – the technical characteristics
of the fleet influencing the attainability and the
upkeep of the desirable speed (the ability to
accelerate and brake) and the efficiency of passenger
alighting and boarding processes (the capacity of the
vehicle, the bus floor height at entrances and other
parts of the bus, the number of doors and their width,
the number of entrance steps, the sitting and standing
area structure and arrangement), failure frequency.
Some of the influences (e.g., drivers’ psychophysical and
motoric characteristics) are almost unmeasurable in real
conditions, while other influences (e.g., the number of
passengers giving way to passengers alighting from the bus)
are hard to study due to technical issues in executing
sufficiently accurate measurements. Rarely do the bus travel
disturbances result from a single, easily distinguishable
factor. It is most often a cumulated effect of numerous
factors, especially in junction areas. The current paper
contains the analysis of the issue of time wasted by buses
which are stopped in queues at approaches to junctions with
traffic signals.
III.
MODEL OF BUS TRAFFIC DISTURBANCES AT
APPROACHES TO JUNCTIONS WITH TRAFFIC SIGNALS
Assigning right curbside bus lanes, which may be also
used by vehicles taking a right turn at the nearest junction, is
a very popular solution in European cities. The dedicated
lane is open for vehicles taking a right turn in a set distance
from the stop line, which helps car drivers to avoid a
complicated relation at the approach to the junction. Hence,
the traffic stream at the approach has a mixed nature [9] and
its structure and length greatly defines the conditions for the
bus travel through the junction.
The reference point of this analysis is a single stop-to-
stop section with only one signalized junction located in the
final part of the section. This section can be divided into two
units (Figure 1): the longer part of the section between the
head of the bus stop and the stopping line at the approach of
junction (S1) and the smaller part of the section – between
junction stopping line and the head of the next bus stop (S2).
In this case, both bus stops are located far side signalized
junction. This approach enables a comparison of time lost in
a single intersection in relation to undisturbed running time
of the section.

A.
Undisturbed bus riding the bus lane through the
signalized juntion
If vehicles taking a right turn appear at the green signal
and are able to leave the bus lane smoothly (the situation at
the exit of the junction allows it), then the blockage of buses
is occasional. This situation is presented in Figure 2; traffic
volume on the bus lane is small, and even in case of
significant parallel stream of pedestrians, the bus is able to
cross the junction with desired speed.
Figure 2.
Small traffic volume on the bus lane at the approach to
signalized junction, without significant influence onto bus movement.
This is the most convenient situation for passengers of a
bus. In case of not extremely long sections, running time
consists of acceleration time (during departure from stop),
time of running with desired speed and deceleration time
before next stop. Acceleration and deceleration times can be
estimated with acceleration and deceleration rates - most
often, they are values in the range from 0.6 to 1.1 [m/s2]. The
running time of the main part of the section depends mainly
on speed limits. In [10], average bus running time Tr [s] on
the section with designated bus lane, in close to free traffic
conditions, was described as the function of stop-to-stop
section’s length L [km]:



For such a function, the best fit to the results of
measurements carried out on the sections equipped with bus
lanes in case of close to free bus traffic conditions, in two
Polish cities (Cracow and Warsaw) – has been provided.
This model is very useful in meso scale transportation
planning, but it is not possible to evaluate bus traffic
conditions at the approaches to the signalized junctions.
Therefore, we decided to carry out a more detailed
analysis with the section travel time separation for: the
acceleration time during departure from stop, the time of
running with desired speed and deceleration time, just before
the next stop on the section. This kind of stop-to-stop
running time description has been proposed by Vuchic [11].
There were taken into consideration two cases of bus running
in the middle part of the stop-to-stop section:

Running with (desired) constant speed, chosen by
bus driver;

Running with no constant speed, with coasting –
which is an effect of economic driving with respect
to energy consumption. In this case, motion at a
constant deceleration takes place over almost the
entire length of the section.
In the first case, the bus running time can be estimated by
using the formula:

b – average deceleration rate[m/s2].

where, additionally:

c – constant deceleration rate until braking must be applied
[m/s2].
Both formulas have been used in stop-to-stop running
time calculations for sections with lengths ranging from 350
to 800 [m] – the same range of sections’ lengths was used in
(1). In case of running with constant speed, the best fitting to
the measurements’ results was obtained for acceleration rate
equals to 0.70 [m/s2], deceleration rate 0.80 [m/s2] and
maximum speed 54.0 [km/h]. Whilst, in case of stop-to-stop
running with coasting, there were obtained – successively:
0.70 [m/s2], 0.75 [m/s2] and 59.5 [km/h]. Additionally,
constant deceleration rate equals 0.1 [m/s2]. Results of this
comparison are presented in Figure 3.

Generally, (1) and (2) could be used in bus running time
description. Taking into account adaptation to changes in
speed, registered in short intervals, it was decided that the
model with constant speed will be used in further analysis.

B.
Bus stopping on the first position at the approach of the
signalized junction
When the bus has to stop at the stopping line and there is
no vehicle in front of it – the amount of time lost depends
mainly on the length of the red signal. This situation is
presented in Figure 4.
Figure 4.
Bus stopping at the approach of the signalized junction, due to
the red signal.
In this case, the running time is the sum of the time
period from the moment of departure from stop to the
moment of stopping at the junction stopping line (tS1), the
time of waiting for a green signal (tw) and the time period
from the moment of bus starting from junction stopping line
to the moment of stopping the bus at the bus stop (tS2):

The time period from the moment of departure from stop
to the moment of stopping at the junction stopping line can
be estimated from (2) for S1 distance. The waiting time at the
red signal usually results from a lack of implementation of
traffic signal prioritization at the approach to the junction. It
should be determined as an average value based on traffic
lights structure. In order to determine the time period from
the moment of bus starting from junction stopping line to the
moment of stopping at the bus stop, the following formula
can be used:

where:
S2 is the length of the section between junction stopping line
and the stop [m].
Most frequently, (5) is used for stop-to-stop running time
estimation, when the length of the section is shorter than the
critical distance – the running time is composed exclusively
of acceleration and deceleration times, because it was
assumed that the junction is located at final part of the stop-
to-stop section; such an approach is empowered. Finally, the
stop-to-stop running time in case of bus stopping on the first
position at the approach of the signalized junction one can
estimate by using the formula:

where:

S2 – length of the section between junction stopping line and
the following stop [m].
C.
Bus stopping in the queue at the approach of the
signalized junction
When traffic volume of right turning vehicles at the
junction is significant, buses often stop in the queue. This
may result in a significant increase of time lost, especially
when the queue is long and/or the parallel pedestrian stream
is blocking vehicles turning right. Figure 5 shows this
phenomenon.
Figure 5.
Bus stopping in the queue at the approach of the signalized
junction.
If the number of vehicles at the approach is low (usually,
no more than 2-3 vehicles) and time lost narrows down to the
time needed to stop at the red signal, and the time necessary
to clear the queue amounts to several seconds. If, for
example, there are two vehicles stopped in front of a bus,
after the signal changes to green, they commence a right turn
and stop in front of a pedestrian crossing, causing no
blockage for the bus, which also resumes the travel.
However, the situation changes significantly, when at the
same approach to the junction, the flow of vehicles taking a
right turn is longer than the accumulation section before the
pedestrian
crossing.
Then,
each
consecutive
vehicle
preceding the bus in the queue will block its motion and
4

force an additional halt. The loss of time resulting from the
time necessary to clear the queue will extend. Certainly, if
the halt was short, the length of the time lost at the junction
would be acceptable. However, if the length of the queue is
significant and the traffic situation at the exit of the junction
(influenced by a congestion or, more often, by pedestrian
movement at the parallel crossing) prevents the queue from
clearing smoothly, the bus will lose a significant amount of
time. At worst, it will lose the opportunity to cross at the
current green signal and the time lost will be extended
further due to the necessity to wait for next green light.
When a bus stopping at the approach to the signalized
junction takes place in the queue (K), two additional time
processes have to be introduced. These are:

Queue clearing time (tqc), defined as the time period
from the moment the green signal appears to the
moment the bus moves onward from the queue;

The bus queue motion time (tqm), concerning the
queue which formed in front of the bus at the
approach to the junction, which is counted from the
moment the bus moves onward from the queue to the
moment it crosses the stop line at the junction.
In Polish conditions, it is often assumed that every car in
the queue equals 6.0 [m] in average. Other kinds of vehicles
should be recalculated for cars (e.g., one heavy goods vehicle
or one articulated bus in queue – equals 3 cars). If K=1 or
K=2, there is no additional blockage for the bus, and the bus
running time can be calculated using the formula:

The queue clearing time and the queue motion time –

pedestrian traffic at the crossing parallel to the bus lane.

DEPENDENCE BETWEEN QUEUE CLEARING TIME AND
LENGTH OF QUEUE
The study on the influence of the length of a queue on the
queue clearing time includes the total number of 415 halts at
approaches, including 105 instances of queues consisting of
1 to 20 vehicles. The best match was achieved by a simple
nonlinear regression model:

Moreover, the analysis of the influence of the length of a
queue on the queue motion time includes the results of 1237
bus halts at approaches to junctions, including 263 instances
of queues consisting of 1 to 20 vehicles. The analysis does
not concern instances in which the buses did not manage to
cross the junction during a single signal cycle; those
instances will be contained in future research. The best

METHODS OF REDUCING LOSSES OF BUS TRAVEL TIME
AT APPROACHES TO JUNCTIONS
A reduction of queues in bus lanes at approaches to
junctions may be achieved through shortening the section of
the bus lane which is open for vehicles taking a right turn. If
it is too long, the possibility of extending a queue in which a
bus may be halted increases. Shortening this section allows
5

SIMUL 2014 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in System Simulation

to regulate the length of a queue in front of a bus at the
approach to a junction – upon the implementation of this
solution, vehicles taking a right turn would have to use the
open-access lane until the place where the bus lane is open
for those taking a turn, which would lead to a decrease in the
number of vehicles placed in front of a bus at the approach to
a junction. It is a solution which may be recommended for
areas of particularly long time lost, where the probability of
the queue not being cleared throughout the duration of the
green signal – is substantial. Buses often need to wait for the
next green traffic signal. Significant reduction of time lost
can be also achieved by the activation of a right-turn green
arrow at the approach to the junction, which will enable a
partial queue clearance during the green signal.
A very efficient solution can be the separation of
additional traffic lane for turning right vehicles – outside the
bus lane (if it is spatially possible). In that case, the influence
of disturbances caused by an excessive traffic of vehicles
taking a right turn on the bus traffic is being practically
eliminated. The only contact between these vehicles and the
bus lane is when they cross it. If the number of vehicles
taking a right turn is so great that the queue for the right turn
starts in an open-access lane, assigning even two lanes
outside the bus lane while simultaneously taking care of a
clear signing for the bus lane is worth considering.
VII.
EXAMPLE OF BUS RUNNING TIME
SIMULATION ON THE SECTION EQUIPPED WITH
BUS LANES, WITH ONE SIGNALIZED JUNCTION
Four scenarios of bus operation on single stop-to-stop
section at a length 500 [m], equipped with designated bus
lane were taken into consideration. On the whole length of
this section, only one signalized junction is located. At the
approach to this junction, all vehicles turning right use this
bus lane. The length from the stop to the stopping line of the
junction is 440 [m]. The following scenarios are considered:

Scenario S1: bus crosses the junction with constant
speed, without stopping at approach to the junction;

Scenario S2: bus stops at the junction stopping line,
on the first position (no queue);

Scenario 3: bus stops in third place in the queue at
the approach to the junction (K=2);

Scenario 4: bus stops in sixth place in the queue at
the approach to the junction (K=5).
Table I presents the values of the time lost per bus, in the
considered scenarios. In scenarios 2, 3, and 4, the time of
waiting for the green signal is relatively short – it is 20 [s].
Even, if we ignore it, the time lost in scenarios S2, S3 and S4
in comparison to S1 are significant.

The length of the queue is important as well, its
shortening about 3 vehicles (S3 and S4) saves almost 12 [s]
per bus. Having considered the number of passengers on a
bus, assuming that section is used only by 1000 [pers./h] –
the difference between scenarios S1 and S4 in losses of
passengers’ time during only one hour – amount to 14.36 [h].

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Familiarity with mechanisms of origin of bus traffic
disturbances may be helpful in implementation of fully
efficient means of bus privileging in traffic. Long queues of
vehicles result in far-off positions of buses at the approaches
to signalized junctions, and consequently, in time lost for
buses. Limitation of the time lost can bring serious benefits
for passengers and public transport operators. The results of
the presented analysis can be used to improve bus traffic in
Polish cities. They may also constitute a word of warning
against the implementation of too long sections of shared-
access to bus lanes. The methodology can be used also in
other countries, it is only necessary to carry out the control
tests of the queue clearing time and the queue travel time,
taking into account the local conditions of bus traffic. In
further studies, the model will be complemented by a priority
in traffic lights.
