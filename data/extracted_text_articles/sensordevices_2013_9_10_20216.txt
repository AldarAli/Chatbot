Abstract— A range sensor based on an ultrasonic array 
transmitter 
with 
anisotropic 
directivity 
is 
investigated 
theoretically. Although the sound power of an array 
transmitter with isotropic directivity decreases as the angle of 
the divergence increases, with anisotropic directivity, the 
decreases are limited and high power is obtained. The time 
delay required to control divergence is discussed.

 INTRODUCTION 
Ultrasonic sound has a number of applications. In 
particular, it is widely used to measure the distance between 
two points and in range sensors, which can measure the 
three-dimensional positions and shapes of various objects 
[1–4]. Ultrasonic sensors have the advantage of being simple 
to construct, of being able to perform measurements in 
optically invisible conditions, and of being relatively non-
intrusive when used to monitor daily activities. Since 
ultrasonic waves traveling through air are spread and 
absorbed, the range for measurements is limited to a few 
meters. Some investigations using spark discharge to make 
high-power ultrasonic transmitter in order to improve the 
measurable range [3]. However, the frequency is not 
controllable. We have constructed a high-power ultrasonic 
transmitter that consists of an array of transmitting elements 
[4] in order to improve the measurable range. We have 
constructed a high-power ultrasonic transmitter that consists 
of an array of transmitting elements and obtained the 
pressure 144 times higher than that of a single element [4]. 
The sound frequency is exactly 40 kHz. However, all 
elements of the array generate ultrasonic sounds that are in 
phase with each other, and the directivity is narrow. The 
measurement is thus limited to a small area. Therefore, we 
proposed an ultrasonic array transmitter in which the phase 
of the sound is controlled for each element [5], and which 
has isotropic directivity. As a result of these changes, we 
showed that the divergence of the directivity is successfully 
controlled by the phase control, and the directional 
measurement field covers a wide range. However, the sound 
pressure decreased significantly with the increase in the 
divergence. In many cases of measurement in air, a wide area 
is required in the horizontal direction but not in the vertical 
direction. Therefore, we consider an ultrasonic array 
transmitter with wide horizontal but narrow vertical 
divergence in order to retain a high level of sound pressure. 
In the present paper, we discuss the theory of this system 
and investigate its behavior. 
II. 
ULTRASONIC ARRAY TRANSMITTER 
The present paper discusses the array transmitter that was 
developed in our laboratory. The array has (12 × 12) 
elements in the XY plane at a distance of 10 mm from each 
other. Each element has a radius of 4.3 mm, directivity of 
100° (-6 dB), and operates at 40kHz. 
 
 
The phase of the signal from each element is controlled 
by a signal-delay controller, as shown in Fig. 1. The phase 
delay has been controlled with the sampling rate of 1s. 
III. 
THEORY 
A. Array Transmitter with Isotropic Directivity 
There are many transmitting elements at positions Pi(xi, yi, 
0) in the z = 0 plane and directed toward the z-axis, as shown 
in Fig. 2 (ultrasonic array).  
We now consider an array transmitter with isotropic 
directivity (the divergences are the same in the x and y 
directions). The coordinate system of the divergence is 
shown in Fig. 3. The sound pressure is obtained by the 
following equation [5]:

Figure 5(a) is the 2D image, and Fig. 5(b) is the result along 
with the x-axis.  The sound pressure is normalized by A/r 
such that the normalized sound pressure of a transmitter with 
one element is 1. A sound pressure 144 times higher than that 
of a single element is obtained, and it has a directivity of ±2 
deg. Note that this directivity is too narrow for some 
applications. 
 
 
Figure 6 shows the directivities of an array transmitter in 
which the divergence of the directivity is controlled, as in (1). 
The angle of the divergence used in the equation is 20 deg in 
the x and y directions. The sound pressure is normalized by 
A/r. 
The length L is calculated to be 155 mm. The time delay 
is calculated by (3), and it is 0 to 1.45 ms. Although the 
angle of divergence is about ±20 deg, the sound pressure is 
only 1/20th that of a single element, and it is 7 times lower 
than that of an array transmitter that is in phase. 
 
 
Figure 7 shows the directivities of an array transmitter for 
which the anisotropic directivity is calculated by (6). The 
angle of divergence used in the calculation is 20 deg and 5 
deg in the x and y directions, respectively. The sound 
pressure is normalized by A/r. 
The angle of divergence is about 20 deg and 5 deg in the 
x and y directions, respectively. The peak pressure is about 
48 times higher than that of a single element transmitter and 
2.5 times higher than that of an array transmitter with 
isotropic directivity. The measuring area at the distance r=30 
m is ±10 m horizontally and ±2.6 m vertically. 
Figure 8 shows the dependence of the sound pressure on 
the angle of the divergence in the y direction. The angle of 
the divergence in the x direction is changed. The sound 
pressure decreases with an increase in the angle of 
divergence for the isotropic array transmitter (

However, by using an anisotropic array transmitter, the 
decrease of the peak power can be controlled. The sound 
pressure is about 50 times higher than that of a single 
element when the vertical angle of divergence is kept within 
5 deg for an array transmitter with a wide horizontal 
divergence 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
An 
ultrasonic 
array 
transmitter 
with 
anisotropic 
directivity has been proposed and its characteristics have 
been investigated theoretically. The signal phase of each of 
the elements was changed, and the divergences were 
successfully 
controlled. 
By 
making 
the directivities 
anisotropic, a high sound pressure with a wide range of 
measurement was obtained. The detailed investigations 
comparing the simulation results with experimental results of 
actual device is now in progress.
