Abstract—Due to the imaging principle, there is a large 
number of noise points in polarimetric Synthetic Aperture 
Radar(SAR) images. This coherent noise leads to inaccurate 
segmentation results. To solve this problem, this paper proposes 
a region-based N-cuts polarimetric SAR image segmentation 
algorithm by combining the K-means clustering algorithm and 
N-cuts algorithm. Firstly, K-means clustering algorithm is used 
to pre-segment polarimetric SAR images to form segmented 
regions. Secondly, the similarity measurement matrix is 
constructed on the basis of pre-segmentation. Finally, the N-cuts 
algorithm is introduced to cluster regional nodes and to realize 
image segmentation. This method makes full use of the over-
segmentation characteristic of K-means clustering algorithm, 
and it significantly reduces the computation. Combined with the 
global optimization of atlas segmentation algorithm, the 
performance of segmentation results is improved. In this paper, 
full polarization E-SAR(the Experimental airborne SAR System 
of DLR) images are used for experiments, and processing results 
of 
various 
polarization 
characteristics 
are 
compared. 
Experimental results show that region-based N-cuts algorithm 
is efficient and practical for image segmentation. The results 
also show that this method has higher level of precision and 
shorter computation time than both K-means clustering 
algorithm and N-cuts algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Synthetic aperture radar imaging is a kind of microwave 
remote sensing technology, which has the characteristics of 
working all day in all weather. It is often used in aviation and 
space remote sensing. Polarimetric SAR obtains the 
polarization scattering matrix of the imaging area by 
adjusting 
the 
polarization 
mode 
of 
the 
working 
electromagnetic wave. The matrix contains rich ground 
object information, which improves the ability of SAR to 
obtain scene target information and is of great significance 
for improving the accuracy of image interpretation [1]. 
In recent years, with the maturity of the basic theoretical 
system of radar polarization measurement, the segmentation 
and classification of polarimetric SAR images have broad 
application potentials in unsupervised classification, target 
detection and recognition. 
Due to the imaging principle of SAR images, there are a 
large number of noise spots in polarized SAR images. This 
kind of coherent noise brings difficulties to SAR image 
segmentation. Therefore, the theory of polarization SAR 
image segmentation based on graph theory is still developing, 
and many new segmentation methods and optimization 
algorithms can be tried in the future. 
This paper is structured as follows: Section Ⅱ explains the 
related works about this paper; Section Ⅲ introduces the 
characterization of polarimetric SAR images; Section Ⅳ 
presents the K-means Clustering algorithm and N-cuts 
algorithm; Section Ⅴ introduces the Region-based N-cuts 
algorithm; Section Ⅵ presents experimental results and 
analysis of region-based N-cuts algorithm; and Section Ⅶ 
presents our overall conclusions. 
II. RELATED WORK  
In recent years of development, many researches 
combined classic segmentation algorithm and image 
segmentation algorithm based on specific theory. Zhu [2] used 
watershed over-segmentation and scattering parameters to 
carry out iterative classification, which effectively avoided 
salt and pepper noise, but failed to retain texture feature 
information. Xi [3] combined mean-shift algorithm and 
normalized cut algorithm to process ordinary images. Even 
though the processing effect was good, the images he used 
were simple-- the number of pixels in the image was small.  
In this paper, we use a region-based method to process a 
set of polarimetric SAR images. K-means clustering is a 
widely used classical clustering algorithm, which has the 
characteristics of simple operation and local optimization. 
However, it is sensitive to noise and outliers. In region-based 
N-cuts algorithm, K-means clustering is used for over-
segmentation, and the subsequent calculation units are 
converted from pixels to regions. Taking the obtained region 
into the N-cuts algorithm can effectively reduce the 
calculation and achieve the globally optimal image 
segmentation 
result. 
According 
to 
the 
polarization 
characteristics of SAR image data, we extract various 
polarization 
characteristics 
as 
data 
sets 
for 
image 
segmentation, which contain more information than ordinary 
images. Also, the region-based N-cuts algorithm has better 
processing performance and shorter calculation time than both 
K-means algorithm and N-cuts algorithm.

In practical situations, real objects are often considered as 
distributed targets. The concept of "distributed target" is 
derived from the fact that a non-static or unstable radar target 
changes over time, that is, the target exists in a changing 
environment, and the target scattering also changes with time 
and space. Therefore, the use of the scattering matrix S  to 
characterize the object is limited, so that the polarization 
coherence matrix T  and the covariance matrix C  are 
introduced [5]. These two are used as new data representation 
methods to reflect the scattering mechanism of the distributed 
target. The polarization coherence matrix and the covariance 
matrix are obtained by time-averaging or spatial averaging 
processing on the S  matrix. 
A multi-view polarization coherent matrix can be 
obtained by performing non-coherent averaging of multiple 
single-view polarization coherent matrices. For multi-view 
fully polarized SAR data, the polarization coherence matrix 
T is defined as

In the practical application of polarization SAR image 
processing, most of them are studied in the case of single 
station backscattering system, using the scattering matrix S , 
the polarization coherence matrix

matrix

C  , the combination and operation can extract more 
polarization characteristics. The comprehensive utilization of 
ground 
object 
polarization 
information 
and 
texture 
information is of great significance for improving the 
accuracy of polarimetric SAR image segmentation. 
IV. K-MEANS CLUSTERING ALGORITHM AND N-CUTS 
ALGORITHM 
In this section, we introduce two existing image 
segmentation methods, which are combined in the region-
based algorithm.  
A. K-means Clustering Algorithm 
As a classical clustering algorithm, K-means clustering 
algorithm is also an effective unsupervised classification 
method in the field of image processing. The algorithm 
divides samples into K clusters through an iterative process. 
It uses the mean of these K clusters to represent samples of 
each class in the iterative process. The iteration is terminated 
when the overall error is minimized. 
Firstly, let 
i
N  be the total number of samples in the 
number i cluster 
i
 , and 
i
m is the mean of samples[6]:

B. Image Segmentation Based on Graph Theory 
a) Graph cut 
With the development of image segmentation technology, 
applying graph theory to image segmentation is a hot topic in 
current research. In the field of graph theory, digital images 
can be mapped to a weighted undirected graph. The basic 
processing unit in the image is a pixel, and the basic 
processing unit in the figure is a vertex, which establishes a 
one-to-one correspondence between them: pixels in the 
image are mapped to vertices in the graph, adjacent relation 
of pixels is mapped to edge, and the similarity of pixel value 
between them is mapped to the weight on the edge [6]. 
For the graph 
( ,
)
G
 V E
 is a weighted undirected graph 
[7], as shown in Figure 1: the circle represents the vertex, and 
the line segment connecting the circle represents the edge. 
Weight of the edge connecting vertices
iv
 and
jv
 is 
represented by
ij
w , reflecting a certain property between 
vertices, such as the similarity relation. The degree of a vertex 
is defined by : 
 
( , )
i

(7) 
The degree of a vertex represents the association of the vertex 
with other vertices in the graph.  
If there are two graphs

b) N-cuts Criteria 
For graph
( ,
)
G
 V E
, it is an undirected graph with 
sideband weight. Remove some edges and divide the graph 
into two sets of disjoint vertices to satisfy relation 
,
A

  . Different cuts can be obtained 
according to different criteria. 
Shi and Malik proposed[8] the normalized cut criterion: 
 
( , )
( , )
( , )
( , )
( , )
cut A B
cut B A
Ncut A B
assoc A V
assoc B V


  
(8) 
where: assoc(A,V) is the sum of the weights of all the vertices 
in A and the vertices of the graph. In this way, the similarity 
between two classes is defined. The smaller the similarity 
between classes, the better the segmentation result. 
c) Solution of the N-cuts Algorithm 
In order to solve the optimal 
( ,
)
Ncut A B  value, the N-
cuts algorithm transforms the problem into the field of linear 
algebra research and becomes a solution to the eigenvector 
and eigenvalue problems of the matrix. Suppose a graph 
( ,
)
G
 V E
 is divided into two parts, A and B, so that we set
N
 V
 and x are N-dimensional indication vectors. When 
ix  0
 , node i is in A, and when 
ix  0
, node i belongs to B.  
Let D be a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements 
id . A 
symmetric matrix W is called a weight matrix and its element 
value
( , )
( , )
W i j
 w i j
. The problem of solving the minimum 
value of Ncut(A,B) can be transformed into the form of 
equation (10):

The above formula must satisfy the two conditions of 


 and

[9]. This formula is in the form of 
Rayleigh quotient. If the value range of y is broadened to real 
number, solving the minimum Ncut is equivalent to solving 
the equation under the generalized eigenvalue system:

(11) 
N-cuts method obtains the eigenvector corresponding to 
the second small eigenvalue as the optimal solution for 
Ncut(A,B) by solving the equation under the generalized 
eigenvalue system. The optimal feature vector y is an N-
dimensional solution vector. Select a segmentation threshold 
value y*, divide vertices with values greater than y* into set 
A, and divide the rest into set B. If the image needs more 
detailed segmentation, the algorithm can be recursively 
called to realize multiple segmentation. 
d) Construction of Weight Matrix in N-cuts Algorithm 
The weight matrix W indicates the mapping relationship 
between pixels in the image and nodes in the constructed 
network. The smaller the weight, the smaller the degree of 
similarity between proved nodes. To some extent, it means 
the smaller probability of being divided into the same class. 
We construct the weight matrix

where 
F( )i

X( )i
 
represents the position space vector of the pixel point i. The 
weight matrix considers both the feature vector information 
and the spatial position information. 
I

coefficients, according to experience, whose values can be 
selected according to experience. The range of 
I
  is mostly 
50~80, and the range of 
 X
 is usually 80~100. 
V. REGION-BASED N-CUTS ALGORITHM  
In this paper, a new computational complexity image 
segmentation method is designed by combining K-means 
clustering algorithm and N-cuts algorithm. Firstly, we use K-
means clustering algorithm to pre-segment the image. The 
segmented image is divided into several regions. Then, 
according to the K-means clustering results, the K clustering 
centers output by the algorithm are taken as representative 
points of each region to complete the construction of 
weighted undirected graph. The eigenvalues are used to 
describe the similarity relation between regional points. 
Finally, N-cuts algorithm is used to segment these regions. 
The implementation of the algorithm and the specific 
steps are as follows: 
(1) preprocessing the image by using a K-means 
clustering algorithm; 
(2) The image clustered by K-means is divided into many 
regions, and the number of regions is greatly reduced 
compared with the number of pixel points in the image.  Each 
region is extracted and labeled, and the clustering center of 
the region is used as a region point to replace the region.  The 
information contained in the regional points includes feature 
vector information and spatial location information. 
(3) According to step (2), the original image becomes an 
undirected graph composed of region points, which is input 
as N-cuts.  The weight matrix W is constructed by using 
regional points, and then clustering segmentation is carried 
out by using N-cuts algorithm[11]. 
The algorithm flow chart is shown in Figure 2

Compared with the traditional N-cuts algorithm, the 
region-based N-cuts image segmentation algorithm has the 
advantages of less computation and more accurate 
segmentation effect. 
VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
In this section, we introduce the selection of parameters, 
experimental process and analysis of experimental results. 
A. Data sets description 
In this experiment, a set of polarization characteristic are 
selected of a fully polarized SAR image. These polarization 
characteristic are obtained by several target decomposition 
methods [8], including Cloud decomposition, Yamaguchi 
four-component decomposition and Krogager decomposition. 
We also add the power spectrum image to data sets. These 
polarization characteristics describe ground objects from the 
perspective of scattering mechanism and physical structure.  
A high-resolution polarimetric SAR image is used in the 
experiment, and the specific technical indexes are given in

The image used in the experiment is shown in Figure 3(a), 
which is composed of fully polarized L-band data. The scene 
in the image is an area of Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.  Under 
the condition of fine division, there are about 10 kinds of 
ground objects in the image, including forests, buildings, 
farmland, bare land (obvious airport runway) and other main 
ground objects.

 Power spectrum image. Figure 3(b) shows the power 
spectrum image, which use the average power 
represents the scattering intensity of ground objects 
directly.  
 Cloud Decomposition Figure 3(c)(d)(e) shows the 
results of Cloud decomposition. The results represent 
three generation factors of the equivalent single 
scattering target: Bragg scattering
C11
, dihedral 
scattering
C22
, and volume scattering
C33
, which 
respectively represent three mutually independent and 
complementary correlation scattering processes. 
 Yamaguchi 
Four-component 
Decomposition. 
Figure 3(f)(g)(h)(i) shows the result of Yamaguchi 
four-component decomposition. Comparing the four 
images, we find that the urban area has the strongest 
double-bounce scattering, which is the main scattering 
mechanism of urban area. Due to the presence of 
relatively tall vegetation in forest area, the canopy 
consists of a large number of branches and leaves, 
mainly characterized by volume scattering. Surface 
features with less rough surface, such as farmland, bare 
land and some low vegetation, Bragg scattering is their 
main scattering mechanism. However, trunks and 
ground form a dihedral angle, so the radar tilting the 
scene will cause double-bounce scattering exhibited by 
such vegetation. The division of vegetation should be 
dominated by volume scattering, including Bragg 
scattering and double-bounce scattering. Most of the 
urban areas should be classified as double-bounce 
scattering, and should not be classified as volume 
scattering, which is a mistake with plants. For the helix 
scattering component, only the forest and urban parts 
are expressed, and they have certain differences. 
Applying this feature can effectively distinguish 
forests, cities and other features. 
 Krogager Decomposition. Figure 3(j)(k)(l) shows the 
result of Krogager decomposition. Krogager is 
decomposed into three coherent components, which 
correspond to spherical scattering
s
K , dihedral angular 
scattering 
Kd
with a rotation angle  , and helix 
scattering
h
K . Both the spherical scattering and the 
dihedral angular scattering in the forest area are strong, 
while the urban part mainly exhibits dihedral angular 
scattering. Cultivated land and bare land areas are 
mainly characterized by spherical scattering. Similar to 
Yamaguchi decomposition, helix scattering features 
can exist mainly in forests as well as in urban areas.

power   
Reasons for selecting the above experimental data: 
1) Number of clusters n: The original image has a higher 
resolution and the number of pixels is 1200 1300

 . Based 
on actual factors, the original polarized SAR image is roughly 
divided into roughly 10 types of features. Therefore, the 
number of pre-segmented areas is at least 10. It was found 
through experiments that clustering numbers 
k 100
 and 
k  20
 were selected for clustering, and there was no 
significant difference. Moreover, the split result is used as the 
input of the subsequent N-cuts algorithm, and the parameter 
k  20
 is selected as the number of regions, which can 
reduce the calculation amount and reduce the computer 
memory requirement. 
2) Maximum number of iterations and precision: Set the 
number of iterations to 50 and the iteration precision to 0.5 as 
the iteration termination condition. They can simultaneously 
define clusters to achieve better results. 
3) Selection of the initial cluster center: The number of 
pixels in the original image is huge, and it is impossible to 
select a representative representative point based on 
experience. Therefore, the initial representative points are 
selected in the natural order of the images[10]. 
4) Number of times algorithm was called: Set
N  8
, 
which can roughly cover the total number of features. 
5) Selection of polarization characteristics: In the 
experiment, six different polarization features with large 
amount of information are selected, including various 
scattering mechanisms, such as spherical scattering, dihedral 
angular scattering, Bragg scattering, and volume scattering to 
distinguish different features. The average power can directly 
express the scattering intensity of the ground object, which is 
also a very representative feature. 
According to the experimental results, it can be concluded 
that the average power   is used for segmentation. Most of 
the other polarization features can be clearly distinguished for 
a particular two species, but it is impossible to distinguish 
between multiple types of features. For example, the Bragg 
scattering characteristics of Yamaguchi decomposition have a 
better effect on the division of cultivated land and bare land, 
but the effect on forest and urban area is poor. Therefore, the 
average power is selected for the experiment and the overall 
performance is better. 
c) Performance evaluation metric 
The experiment also selected the average power   as the 
original image, changed the parameter settings in the 
experiment, and conducted a control experiment. For 
different cluster numbers K and N values in the N-cuts 
algorithm, the K-means clustering algorithm, N-cuts 
algorithm and region-based N-cuts algorithm are used to 
process the image separately, and the processing time is 
recorded. The processing results are shown in Table Ⅲ. It can 
be seen from the experimental data that the K-means 
clustering is used for preprocessing, and the calculation time 
based on the region-based N-cuts algorithm is much shorter 
than the calculation time of the N-cuts algorithm. The amount 
of calculation depends on the number of regions. The 
segmentation accuracy of the region-based N-cuts algorithm 
is better than the K-means clustering algorithm, and the 
overall optimal result can be obtained.

 d) Experimental Results of Image Segmentation 
The average power is selected as the original image and 
the N-cuts algorithm is recursively called to get the final 
segmentation result.  
A total of 4 recursive calls are made to the N-cuts 
algorithm for segmentation, and 20 types of features were 
divided into 8 categories. Then, based on artificial 
experience, similar features are combined and to make 
further fine division of ground objects. The final 
segmentation results in 9 types of features. The 
experimental results are shown in Figure 5:

The segmentation result shows that the N-cuts 
algorithm is continuously called to divide the original 
image into several parts to achieve the purpose of 
classification. A better segmentation effect can be achieved 
by selecting the average power  as the original image 
input. Moreover, the algorithm has a short processing time, 
occupies less computer memory, and is highly efficient. 
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
This section presents our overall conclusions and the 
works needed in the future. 
A. Conclusions 
From the perspective of the research problem of 
polarimetric SAR image segmentation, this paper first 
analyzes the shortcomings of various existing image 
processing methods, and then proposes a region-based N-
cuts algorithm and applies it to polarimetric SAR images 
segmentation. The proposed method is validated by E-SAR 
full polarization data, and this method is compared with 
other image segmentation algorithm results for evaluation. 
Experiments show that: experiments are carried out on 
multiple polarization feature images, and the influence of 
different features on segmentation results is compared and 
analyzed. The average power image is used to achieve the 
best segmentation effect. For polar SAR image processing, 
region-based N-cuts algorithm is objective and efficient 
compared to traditional image segmentation algorithms. 
Applying the mature theory in graph theory to the field of 
image segmentation, combined with K-means clustering, 
we can implement region-based image segmentation 
algorithm. This method can greatly improve the calculation 
efficiency, reduce the computer memory requirements, and 
achieve efficient processing. The region-based N-cuts 
algorithm is continuously called to divide the original image 
into several parts to achieve the purpose of classification. In 
addition, the algorithm is highly portable. In different actual 
scenarios, it can be improved according to specific needs 
and combined with different algorithms. 
B. Future works 
In the future experiment about region-based N-cuts 
image segmentation method, we consider to merge various 
polarization features to access some more representative 
new features. Also, other data sets with larger data and some 
other traditional image segmentation method should be 
carried out to compare with the proposed method. Moreover, 
the criteria for performance evaluation [11] need to be 
improved. In addition, the algorithm has good portability. 
So according to specific requirements, the algorithm can be 
improved or combined with other algorithms in different 
actual scenes.
