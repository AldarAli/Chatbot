Abstract— Recent proliferation of portable devices requires 
video contents playable on virtually any portable devices. 
However, their limited computing resources pose significant 
restriction to accomplish real-time decoding of high resolution 
or high quality video contents. To solve the problem, we 
propose a complexity scalable video decoding scheme for real-
time playback on portable devices. In this paper, we analyze 
the complexity of H.264/AVC video decoding elements and 
develop a complexity scalable decoding scheme by simplifying 
motion compensation and deblocking filtering. Experimental 
results with the H.264/AVC main profile coded bitstream show 
that its decoding complexity can be reduced up to 26% without 
significant loss in subjective quality as compared to the 
conventional H.264/AVC decoder.  
Keywords-H.264/AVC; video decoder; complexity scalable 
decoding 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The development of portable devices and prevalence of 
wireless communication infrastructures make the multimedia 
services very popular. The video services such as IPTV, 
video conferencing, or video telephony are the most popular 
multimedia services. However, the limited battery capacity 
and the computational performance of the portable devices 
are major restriction to implement real-time playback of 
video contents on portable devices. Moreover, increasing 
demand of playback of higher resolution or quality video 
contents on portable platforms makes it quite difficult to 
attain real-time video. 
To attain the real-time video decoding, we have to 
decrease its workload by reducing computational complexity 
of decoding process. The significant problem in such 
reduction is the possible huge degradation of objective 
quality due to processing mismatch between encoder and 
decoder. Since distorted pictures caused by reduced 
complexity process are used again for reference picture for 
the following pictures to be decoded, propagation of 
distortion error will become larger so that it causes even 
more degradation of objective quality as time goes on. 
However, due to some characteristics of human visual 
system, certain degradation in video quality might be 
tolerable to a certain extent.  
Therefore, many complexity scalable video decoding 
algorithms have been developed to make a good compromise 
between complexity reduction and subjective quality drop 
[1]-[4]. Peng [1] proposed a discrete-cosine transform 
(DCT)-based complexity scalable video decoder via pruning 
the DCT data. Chen et al. [2] expended the IDCT pruning 
approach [1] by using a simpler interpolation filtering 
method according to frame types in motion compensation. 
Lei et al. [3] proposed a complexity scalable algorithms in 
AVS video codec (Audio and Video coding Standard in 
China) using a loop filter and luminance interpolation in 
motion compensation scaling method. Its encoder sends 
some information about the loop filter and the luminance 
interpolation to a decoder for complexity control of a 
decoder. H. Nam el at [4] proposed complexity scalable 
H.264 decoder with downsized decoding. W. Ji el at [5] 
proposed energy-scalable video decoding algorithms.  
The 
H.264/AVC 
standard 
achieves 
high 
coding 
efficiency with many advanced coding tools such as variable 
block size motion compensation, multiple reference frames, 
quarter-pel motion vector accuracy, context adaptive entropy 
coding, etc. [6]. To implement a complexity scalable 
H.264/AVC decoder, we analyze its decoding complexity by 
decoding tool by tool and develop some complexity control 
parameters which our proposed complexity scalable 
decoding scheme utilizes in its decoding complexity control. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, we analyze H.264/AVC video decoding functions from 
the viewpoint of complexity control. In Section III, we 
describe the proposed method for complexity control of 
decoder. Experimental results are given in Section IV. 
Finally, we make some conclusions in Section V. 
 
II. 
VIDEO DECODING ELEMENTS FOR COMPLEXITY 
CONTROL 
H.264/AVC decoder performs variable length decoding 
(VLD) of incoming bitstream and then reconstructs various 
syntax elements such as motion vector, reference index, 
quantization parameter, and residual data of slices. The 
residual data are obtained through inverse quantization (IQ) 
and inverse transform (IT). Following, they are combined 
with a predictor which is generated either by motion 
compensation 
or 
by 
intra 
prediction. 
Subsequently, 
reconstructed picture is generated through deblocking 
filtering process. To evaluate the video decoding elements 
from the view point of complexity control, we analyze the 
complexity of them. Table I depicts the complexity profiling

result of H.264/AVC decoder in terms of decoding time. Its 
analysis is based on bitstreams conforming to the H.264/AVC 
main profile with IBBPBBP structure where every 60th frame 
is coded as I picture.  
As shown in Table I, motion compensation and VLD are 
the major complex elements in a video decoder. This means, 
other than the VLD, motion compensation is the most 
complex process in decoder. Second major complex element 
is the deblocking filter, which is applied to reconstructed 
picture after finished the decoding process. It is an important 
element to improve a subjective quality of reconstructed 
video, especially, in low bit rates bitstreams. By the way, 
IQ/IT takes only about 10% of complexity in which IT 
occupies more computational complexity than IQ. In the 
previous investigation [1], it is found out that complexity 
control of IT process brings a significant quality loss. 
Therefore, in this paper, we decide two decoding functions 
of motion compensation and deblocking filter for complexity 
control.   
A. Motion compensation 
In 
H.264/AVC 
motion 
compensation 
for 
luma 
component, pixel value at fractional quarter-pel positions 
generated according to motion vectors. Fig. 1 depicts their 
positions. Predicted values at half-pel positions are generated 
by an one-dimensional 6-tap FIR interpolation filtering 
horizontally or vertically. A sample value at quarter-pel 
position is generated by averaging values at two nearest half-
pel and integer positions. Computational complexity to 
generate the fractional samples is different depending on 
sample positions as depicted in Table II. Samples at quarter-
pel positions labeled as f, i, k, q are the most complex 
positions. On the other hands, half-pel samples labeled b, h 
are the least complex ones. To reduce the complexity of 
interpolation filtering, we simplify the interpolation filtering 
of each sample position using adjacent integer-pel samples. 
For example, a simplified sample value at quarter sample 
position labeled as a is derived,

where G is at an integer position as depicted in Fig. 1, and b 
is at half-pel position derived by 6-tap FIR interpolation 
filtering. To use a shift operation, we adjust a rounding value 
appropriately. In Table II, we propose a simplified luma 
interpolation filtering of each fractional sample. Motion 
compensation for chroma components are generated by a bi-
linear interpolation of four neighboring integer samples as,

where a is a predicted chroma sample value and A,B C,D are 
the integer-pel position samples. xFracc and yFracc are the 
fractional offsets of fractional samples. To reduce the 
complexity for chroma interpolation filtering, a predicted 
chroma sample is copied from nearest neighboring integer-
pel sample.  
B. Deblocking filter 
In H.264/AVC video coding, its deblocking filter consists 
of three processing phases: boundary strength decision, 
filtering decision, and actual pixel filtering.  
In the boundary strength decision of H.264/AVC, 
boundary strength parameter (BS) is determined by the rules 
in [6] for each boundary of 4
4 block. BS can be 0 ~ 4 
according to the rules. In our experiment, we found out that 
most often selected BS value is 0 or 2. Furthermore blocking 
artifact is more noticeable in flat and simple regions than in 
complex textured regions [7]. In H.264/AVC, flat and simple 
regions are often predicted in large partitions such as 16 16

16. On the other hand, complex regions are 
mostly coded under 8 8 sub-block partitions. Using these 
observations, we re-design a boundary strength decision 
process as shown in Fig. 2.  
Filtering process for sample sets (p0, q0) only takes place 
when following condition is satisfied  [6]:

where ߙ,ߚ are thresholds dependent on quantization 
parameter QP. Since filtering decision process has lots of 
comparison operation and it is performed for each edge, 
complexity would be much increased. In our simplified 
deblocking filter, filtering decision is performed just one 
time per each 4 4 block using an average value of samples 
such as:

where pAvg and qAvg is an average value of samples in P and 
Q 4 4 blocks. 
After the boundary strength decision and filtering 
decision, actual filtering process is applied to each block 
boundary. In H.264/ AVC, filtering strength is different 
depending on BS value. If BS < 4, a 4-tap FIR filter is 
applied with input samples p0, p1, q0, q1, and producing 
outputs p0’ and q0’. In case of BS being 4, a 5-tap or 4-tap 
filter is applied according to conditions [6]. However, the 
proposed simplified deblocking filter applies a 2-tap FIR 
weak filter when BS’ of a current block boundary is 1 
according to the proposed boundary strength decision rules. 
When BS’ value is larger than 1, we apply same filtering 
method like to that of H.264/AVC. 
III. 
COMPLEXITY SCALABLE VIDEO DECODING SCHEME 
Fig. 3 depicts a block diagram of the proposed 
complexity scalable decoding scheme. The complexity 
scalable video decoder has a minimum quality loss within 
the maximum complexity reduction by controlling the 
control parameters. Therefore, we have to find an optimal 
complexity control level of parameters which satisfy the 
minimum quality loss. To find an optimum control level of 
parameters, we evaluate complexity-distortion (C-D) 
performance according to various complexity control 
parameters. 
A. Motion compensation complexity control 
In this paper, we apply a simplified interpolation filtering 
method according to fractional sample positions as proposed 
in Table II. The complexity scalability for motion 
compensation can be attained by controlling the number of 
luma samples which are involved in the simplified 
interpolation filtering. Table III depicts a proposed motion 
compensation complexity reduction level (MCRLevel). As 
depicted in Table III, we reduce the complexity of interpolation 
filtering for luma samples from the most complex sample 
position labeled as f, i, k, q to the least complex position 
labeled as b, h according to MCRLevel. Furthermore in order 
to control the motion compensation for chroma samples, we 
apply the proposed simplified chroma interpolation method 
when the MCRLevel is larger than 0.
