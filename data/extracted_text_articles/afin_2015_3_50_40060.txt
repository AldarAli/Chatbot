Abstract— Due to the development of mobile communication 
technologies, multimedia services for mobile devices or other 
services have begun to be commercialized. In this paper, we 
propose a method that minimizes channel switching time by 
pre-computing the user’s preferred channels in the LTE-
Advanced System. The existing composition of the Multimedia 
Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) using the Internet Group 
Management Protocol (IGMP) transfers data using multicast 
from the Broadcast Multicast Service Center (BM-SC) to 
evolved Node B (eNB), and with broadcast from eNB to the 
User Equipment (UE). Therefore, in the case of channel 
switching, the IGMP Join report should be transferred to the 
BM-SC, where it then waits for the user’s content to be 
retransferred from eNB. However, in the case of our proposed 
method, the subscriber channel technique of priorities is used 
to minimize the wait times between channel switching as the 
UE broadcasts its favorite channels in advance. Our 
performance is evaluated using mathematical modeling and 
shows that the delay time can be reduced from approximately 
30 to 79% in terms of the channel switching time.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
The use of the Internet has increased greatly due to 
multimedia services. It is expected to increase by at least 
1000-fold by 2020 [1]. In wireless environments, as the 
quality of the internet connection has improved, the demand 
for multimedia services such as Internet Protocol Television 
(IPTV), Video on Demand (VOD), and Voice over IP (VoIP), 
using a mobile IPTV is steadily increasing. IPTV is a 
communication and broadcasting convergence service based 
on IP that provides a broadcast service to the user terminal, 
and it can provide an interactive service according to the 
user’s demands. In particular, mobile IPTV is mobility-
granted to the existing IPTV. The Multimedia Broadcast 
Multicast Service (MBMS) initially appeared in Release 6. 
The MBMS was introduced in order to provide a service in 
Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA). The 
most important technique of the MBMS is the Multimedia 
Broadcast Multicast Service Single Frequency Network 
(MBSFN) transmission scheme, which has been added in 
Release 7. The 3GPP has standardized tasks to provide Long-
Term Evolution (LTE) standardization and evolved MBMS 
(eMBMS) in Release 8, as well as including eMBMS 
standards in Release 9. In addition, the eMBMS features 
(counting techniques to determine the number of user 
terminals interested in a multimedia broadcast, the broadcast 
service to support the mobility of the receiving user terminal 
technology) have been added in Release 10/11, and are 
progressing towards standardization in Release 12 [2].  
The MBMS is an effective method for delivering 
multimedia content to multiple destinations by allowing for 
the sharing of resources more efficiently. The LTE-
Advanced system has two methods for supporting the 
MBMS. One is a single-cell MBMS transmission method 
used to transmit the MBMS content to users in a single 
evolved Node B (eNB). Another is a multi-cell MBMS 
transmission method for simultaneously transmitting MBMS 
content to the users that belong to a group of eNBs. The 
MBSFN transmission scheme is greatly improved in terms of 
the spectral efficiency in order to improve the Signal to 
Interference-Plus-Noise Rate (SINR) with compared to the 
Universal Mobile Tele-communications System (UMTS) for 
MBMS. This is very useful for the cell edge, which is 
considered to be inter-cell interference in the UMTS, because 
the interference signal is decreased and the received signal is 
increased simultaneously. The MBSFN generally provides 
better performance compared to single-cell Point to Point 
(PTP) or Point to Multipoint (PTM) transmission [3]-[4]. 
As a result, the MBMS transmits content by linking one 
eNB to multiple UEs. If any UE requests are connected to the 
applicable eNB, even if the UE does not request the specific 
channel, along with the channel requested by the other UE, 
the MBMS can receive content due to the broadcasting 
method. When the UE changes channels, if the UE is already 
receiving the channel via broadcasting, there is no time delay 
related to the channel change. If not, it can be received after 
sending the desired channel to the Broadcast Multicast 
Service Center (BM-SC) via the Internet Group Management 
Protocol (IGMP) Join report. To support the improved 
content in LTE-Advanced/eMBMS environments, we 
propose a method for minimizing the channel switching time 
by using channel priority assignment interlinked with the 
Content Database. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes 
the related work. In Section 3, we describe the improvement 
of the content transmission using the channel priority scheme 
with an IGMP. Section 4 shows the numerical results with 
the analytical model, and finally we conclude with Section 5.

RELATED WORK 
This section describes the LTE-Advanced System, 
Mobile IPTV and eMBMS. 
A. LTE-Advanced System 
LTE (Rel. 8/9) is based on the OFDM transmission 
scheme, and can be described as the evolution of 3G mobile 
communication technology, such as Code Division Multiple 
Access (CDMA), WCDMA and 3.5G High Speed Packet 
Access (HSPA). The LTE system operates at a rate three 
times higher than the 3.5G transmission system in the 
Downlink and the latest standard for LTE, LTE Advanced, 
seeks to achieve a rate more than twice as high as that found 
in LTE [5]-[8].  
LTE and LTE-Advanced technologies increase the data 
transmission rate, and many technologies are being studied in 
order to support seamless service. Multiple Input Multiple 
Output (MIMO) technology in particular is being studied to 
make high transmission rate a core technology of LTE and 
LTE-Advanced 
systems. 
MIMO 
technology 
has 
an 
advantage in that there is no help from electric power or 
frequency, and it can obtain an antenna number proportionate 
to the channel capacity. Increasing the performance of 
mobile communication systems represents an important 
avenue of research. MIMO technology has rapidly evolved 
from Single-User MIMO to Multi-User MIMO, and recently 
to Mass-MIMO [14].  
 
Figure 1.  Antenna techniques of LTE and LTE-Advanced. 
Figure 1 shows the antenna port and the spatial 
multiplexing layer in LTE (Rel. 8/9) and LTE-Advanced 
(Rel. 10) (Assuming that the UE has 4 receivers – 4 x 4). The 
downlink of LTE is up to support four transmit spatial layers, 
and the uplink (assuming that the eNB use the diversity 1 x 
2) is up to support one per UE. LTE is not supported by a 
multi-antenna transmitter in order to simplify the baseline 
UE. However, multi-user spatial multiplexing (Multi-User 
MIMO) is supported. For MU-MIMO, the 2 UEs transmit in 
the same frequency and time, and eNB has to separate the 
UEs based on the spatial attributes. The gain of the uplink 
capacity, including multi-user spatial multiplexing, is 
generated. The maximum data transfer rate of a single user is 
not improved. To improve the peak data rate of a single user, 
in order to meet the requirements of the ITU-R (radio 
communication sector) for spectrum efficiency, LTE-
Advanced may designate up to 8 downlink layers. This 
allows for 8x8 spatial multiplexing on the downlink where 
eight receivers are required for the UE. The UE has been 
specified to support up to four transmitters. Therefore, when 
combined with the four receivers, the eNB allows for the 
transmission of a 4x4 uplink. 
B. Mobile IPTV 
IPTV is a the TV service provider that provides services 
to the user via the IP network. In addition, the user has 
received the enhanced TV service instead of the traditional 
TV service through a technique called IP. Already we have 
been using a similar service, such as videos and web search 
using a computer or laptop via the Internet. The opportunity 
is in mobile IPTV, where users cannot watch TV services as 
one-way, but instead watch real-time two-way [13]. In 
addition, it is possible to use the enhanced TV service over 
the desired configuration. Moreover, once Korea had 
obtained popular mobile TV, such as DMB, it had a 
technique where you can always watch where you want. It is 
a concept known as Take-Out TV. However, this model of 
mobile TV technology extends the existing fixed-TV service, 
which had limitations with traditional TV services, where in 
particular there was still dissatisfaction with the one-way 
service [2]. In order to solve this problem, techniques for 
two-way service were introduced using mobile IPTV-based 
IEEE802.16, 3GPP and a variety of communication 
technologies (for example, 3GPP2 / BCMCS, Qualcomm / 
MediaFLO, IMNA / BCAST, etc.). Figure 2 shows the 
configuration of a mobile IPTV. 
 
Figure 2.  Configuration of mobile IPTV. 
Mobile IPTV can support services anywhere, anytime 
and also supports seamless mobility in the wireless 
environment, even when moving to another radio link with a 
mobility supporting technology, such as the handover 
duration of the IPTV service. Especially if there are 
characteristics of a different radio link, technical issues can 
occur, but these technologies are expanding the research 
scope of the technology because they are able to expand the 
available range of mobile IPTV standardization that 
organizations are required to have [14]. In addition, the 
mobility studies in the Next Generation Network (NGN), 
ITU-T SG13 and SG19 in charge of the mobile 
67

communication network standards fall jointly under the 
NGN-SGI (Global Standards Initiative) to form a group 
called Mobility Management, and the standardization 
progress and issues, such as Fixed Mobile Convergence 
(FMC), are also being studied at the same time [5]. Recently, 
mobile IPTV technology has been secured for the QoS and 
QoE of the content, security, interoperability and openness, 
anytime and anywhere, which aims to provide services 
across any device, through the combining of the next 
generation of web technology oriented user engagement and 
personalization and service convergence [16]. 
C. eMBMS 
3GPP has introduced 3G / 4G user multicast information, 
as well as MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast / Multicast 
Service). MBMS may share resources efficiently, as it is an 
efficient method for providing multimedia content to 
multiple destinations. MBMS in the "LTE" context of 3G 
systems are evolving to become eMBMS [2]. LTE's eMBMS 
aims to provide broadcast and multicast service combining 
the high efficiency of the spectrum capacity. LTE-Advanced 
is designed to share services, such as digital video / audio 
broadcast.  
 
Figure 3.  eMBMS architecture. 
In Figure 3, eMBMS shows the UE how to perform the 
broadcast / multicast in the LTE-Advanced network [9]. It 
can send a media signal simultaneously to multiple receivers 
in the same area using the same eNB. In addition, the 
interactive features of the eMBMS system can dynamically 
interact with the broadcast network. To support the eMBMS 
service without having to change the entire structure of the 
existing service, the addition of a new node such as BM-SC 
can be supported. The eMBMS architecture is compatible 
with the SGSN and GGSN, such as 2G / GSM or the 3G 
UMTS packet core node based on the packet core domain. 
The eMBMS configuration of the 3GPP / LTE is shown in 
Figure 3. An eMBMS gateway exists between BM-SC and 
the eNB and performs functions such as MBMS packet 
transfer to the eNB by IP Multicast, user plane data header 
compression, and session control signaling (session start / 
stop). The MCE is responsible for allocating radio resources 
used by all eNBs belonging to one MBSFN area [15]. 
We first define a new interface SGi-mb and SG-mb for 
the BM-SC and MBMS Gateway communication. The SG-
mb interface delivers authentication information and service 
management to the control plane. IP packets of the 
multimedia data are transmitted through the user plane 
interface’s SGi-mb. 
IGMP is split into two versions. It is a protocol for 
managing the large group membership of a multicast router 
and identifying a member of a multicast group on a network 
host. IGMPv1 is described in RFC 11/12 and IGMPv2 is 
described in RFC 2236. IGMPv2 is used by default in the 
router [10]. The operation is performed through joining, 
monitoring, member continuation, and leaving, as well as 
when a multicast group joins the router and sends a General 
Query message at 125-second intervals, and notifies the 
router to leave (IGMPv1 does not inform). Recently IGMPv3 
has been under development by RFC 3376 [11]. An IGMP 
message is composed of 8 bytes, where the first four bits 
discriminate the IGMP version. Consisting of 16 bits in the 
checksum, there is a group consisting of a 32-bit address (IP 
address of Class D). The time to query is when the group 
address is set to zero, since that is when the report has a 
value that represents the address of the group. 
 
Figure 4.  IGMP flow. 
Figure 4 is a schematic view showing the basic operation 
of the IGMP. When the first process is to participate in the 
group, the host sends an IGMP Join message. The host does 
not send the report when the first process and last process 
leaves the group, while the router periodically sends an 
IGMP Query message to check whether the host is part of a 
group. The host then sends an IGMP Report message for 
each group belonging to its own process, and responds to the 
IGMP Query message. 
Numerous standards and research papers for the Mobile 
IPTV service are presented and most of them address the cost 
by cell range. Our research, on the other hand, focuses on the 
improvement of the quality of user experience through 
minimizing the time of channel switching concerning MBMS 
service in LTE/LTE-A system. 
III. 
SERVICE CONTROL OF CONTENT DATABASE 
At present, several UEs are connected to one eNB, and 
the eMBMS transmits the content using a point-to-multipoint 
method. Therefore, the UE receives not only the requesting 
channels, but also unsolicited channels. Other UEs then 
request content in the same eNB. The channel change using 
IGMP is shown in Figure 5. After sending the IGMP JOIN 
report from the UE to BM-SC, the channel content packet 
may be transmitted from the eNB to UE.

Figure 5.  Channel selection procedure in eMBMS. 
Figure 6 describes the process for channel change. If a 
UE changes from channel#1 to channel#2, the IGMP JOIN 
message for channel#2, the IGMP LEAVE message for 
channel#1, and transmits the content for channel#2, this is a 
source of service quality degradation due to the waiting time 
to perform the channel change. 
 
Figure 6.  Flow of channel selection in mobile IPTV. 
As shown in Figure 6, the channels are transmitted by 
multicasting from the content provider to the eNB, and then 
the channels requested by the UEs are transmitted by 
broadcasting from the eNB to UE. Therefore, when the UE 
changes the channel for new contents, if the UE already 
receives the new contents representing the requested 
information by broadcast message, we assume that there is 
no delay time for the channel change. However, there cannot 
be an inefficient waste of broadcast packets for all channels 
regardless of the subscriber. We propose a method of 
broadcasting with respect to the expected channel to be used. 
Figure 7 shows a representation where a database node 
for the user to analyze the existing eMBMS system has been 
added. When the channel change request comes from the UE, 
if the channel is currently being broadcast, it sends the 
content of the immediately changed channel. If the channel is 
not being broadcast, it sends a message to the BM-SC 
requesting the content of the requested channel. This is the 
same method as the existing transmission system. Since the 
BM-SC has a preference pattern for UE channels, it is 
transmitted to the UE by the broadcast channel with selected 
channels that are decided by the BM-SC / content database. 
This method eliminates the delay time according to the 
channel change of the UE. The communication between the 
content provider / content database and BM-SC using this 
method is performed in the system backend, which reduces 
the burden of the UE and does not affect the existing channel 
switching time.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this section, we perform a mathematical analysis to 
assess the performance of MBMS channel switching time in 
terms of the delay time, and present some numerical results 
to evaluate the comparison of the channel change.

Using improved functionality, the MBMS time can be

B. Numerical Results 
Based on the analysis given so far, we compare the

Kcore
 specifies the proportion of a real-world environment 
to be larger than 
Kair
. The content database node increases 
and the subscriber may encounter a delay according to the 
calculation for the wireless channel. In this paper, the weight 
of 
Kair
 and 
Kcore
 was confirmed by setting three assumptions. 
If there are none of the subscriber’s favorite channels, as 
shown in Figure 8, the proportion of  
Kair
 and 
Kcore
 may be 
increased compared to the conventional MBMS channel 
switching time if the subscriber's preferred channel is 
included (if it is broadcast). Accordingly, the proportion of  
Kair
 and 
Kcore
 can confirm the degree of improvement from 
22.7 to 30.7% compared to the existing procedures. Of 
course, the delays are reduced when the proportion of 
Kcore
 is 
large. 
 
Figure 8.  Comparison of the channel change. 
 
Figure 9.  Channel popularity density [13]. 
According to [13], with respect to channel 96 for the 
popularity investigation result of the TV viewing conditions, 
0≤X≤10 is 45% as shown in Figure 9, 0≤X≤15 is 65%, and 
0≤X≤20 indicates a probability of 70% for 5 or more 
channels if the shared content can be sent without channel 
change time. 
The channel change time for the subscriber’s favorite 
channel is analyzed. Figure 10 shows that it is possible to 
reduce the delay time from 57.5 to 61.8% in the case of 0≤ X 
≤10. Figure 11 shows that it is possible to reduce the delay 
time from 76.8 to 79.2 % in the case of 0≤ X ≤20.  
If the most popular 96 channels are shared in a service 
node, the probability of a viewer choosing among the 
channels is 0.618. Figures 10 and 11 show the cumulative 
channel duplication probability of 10 independent trials when 
total numbers of most popular shared channels are 10 and 20. 
Notice that the newly proposed method is able to let viewers 
immediately watch on the shared mobile IPTV without 
channel change time using the enhanced group join and leave 
process for LTE / LTE-A systems, when more than 5 channel 
requests are made for most popular channels.

V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we analyze channel change techniques and 
conduct a performance evaluation for mobile IPTV in LTE-
Advanced environments. The proposed method, which is a 
curtailment of channel change time, can be effective for 
eliminating the delay time by broadcasting from the eNB in 
advance after analyzing the channel pattern of the accessing 
user in the content database. This method also reduces the 
burden of the UE and doesn’t affect the existing services at 
all because it is performed in the back end of the BM-SC and 
content database system after the user initially connects. For 
the performance evaluation, we analyze the transmission of 
the content without the IGMP message using the duplication 
probability of the selected channel for the shared channel. If 
the computational accuracy of the subscriber priority channel 
in the content database is able to be increased, we can expect 
to provide a better service for MBMS and improve the 
performance of MBMS.  
In future work, we will seek to increase the accuracy of 
the method for calculating the preferred channels of the 
subscriber in the content database.
