Abstract—The analysis of the quality of life has become an 
increasingly complex process through which a number of 
economic, political and social factors are examined in order to 
identify the necessary measures to be taken for the social 
inclusion of disadvantaged people, to reduce the poverty rate of 
the population and to increase the living conditions. Through a 
detailed analysis of the determinants of living standards, we 
identified the progress that Romania has made since 2007, the 
year of accession to European Union, until 2016, the year for 
which the latest open data sets are available. Thus, an important 
discrepancy it has been identified between the level of quality of 
life from the region that has obtained the highest score, the 
region which covers the Romanian capital has been excluded, 
and the one which has obtained the lowest score. With an income 
difference of 28% and with four times higher of foreign 
investments attracted in the Central Region against the North-
Eastern 
Region, 
the 
identification 
and 
adoption 
of 
administrative politics become imperative for ensuring a 
unitary development of the eight Romanian regions of economic 
development.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Measuring the quality of life represents an important 
instrument in determining the level of development of a 
determined region, as an increased value of life satisfaction 
reflects at the same time the individual’s and the society’s 
economic welfare, individual’s satisfaction, which reflects 
not only in his/her good emotional state, but also in the 
assessment of the local economy by the increase of 
productivity, capital attraction, increases of workplaces, etc. 
For an identification as accurate as possible of the level 
of the quality of life it is necessary not only to use the 
economic dimensions, which consider the rate of income and 
expenses, or other financial elements, but also to turn towards 
the factors which measure the citizens’ safety level, the 
medical facilities’ capability to ensure public interest 
healthcare, the education level accessible to citizens, the 
individuals’ satisfaction and other social factors which might 
have significant influence both on the economic welfare and 
on the social welfare of individuals belonging to a certain 
society.  
On the same hand, even though the data sets come from 
official sources, for calculating the level of the quality of life, 
an analysis of the former must be realized in order to ensure 
a level of data quality as high as possible by correcting 
possible errors present in the analyzed data sets. 
For the atomization of the calculation of the quality of life 
index, the QoLI Framework represents an authentic solution 
as it absolves the analysts from the application of complex 
sets of formulas in order to determine the level of quality of 
life of a determined community. Through this framework, the 
analysis becomes easier, involving only the preparation of the 
date which will be used to realize the calculation and to 
interpret the results obtained after applying the calculation 
formulas over a sphere of eight economical-social 
dimensions and of two supplementary indicators, the net 
medium income and the level of resident population. Thus, 
the quality of life indicator calculated using the QoLI 
Framework becomes a robust indicator, which has in mind 
both the financial nature factors which influence the 
purchasing power of individuals and the social nature factors 
as well, which affect the physical and emotional state of the 
population. 
The present case of study aims at realizing a study relative 
to the level of the quality of life in Romania centered on the 
economic development areas for the period 2007-2016, the 
year of accession of Romania to the European Union (2007), 
respectively the last year for which statistics are available. 
For this reason, we will briefly present the most important 
indexes for measuring the quality of life used after 1990, 
followed in Section III by a focus over detailing the economic 
and social dimensions which make up the formula for 
calculating the Quality of Life Index (QoLI). 
Section IV is reserved to presenting the used open data 
sources, followed on the next section by a focus on the 
process of ensuring the quality of data by identifying and 
suggesting solutions for rectifying the sensitive aspects 
regarding the increase of the data’s quality. The framework’s 
structure implementation will be presented in Section VI, 
while in Section VII it will be presented the result of the 
calculation of the QoLI for the laps of time analyzed so that 
the following section exposes a series of findings regarding 
the approached subject will be revealed.  
II. 
 STATE OF ART 
One of the most used metrics for determining the level of 
development of a country [1], the Human Development Index 
(HDI) [2], has its origins in year 1990, when the United 
Nations Development Programme launched a formula for 
calculating the rate of the welfare of the population using the 
following three factors:  
a) the population’s health status and longevity; 
b) the level of knowledge the citizens have access to;

ICDS 2019 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Digital Society and eGovernments

c) the population’s life standard reflected through the 
rate of its income.  
The recognition of the multi-dimensional nature of the 
factors that affect the quality of life has determined the 
identification of a new index, the World Health Organization 
Quality of Life (WHOQOF) [3], which treats more 
dimensions than the HDI: 
a) physical domain; 
b) psychological domain; 
c) level of independence; 
d) social relationships; 
e) environment; 
f) 
spirituality, religion, personal beliefs. 
Although HDI and WHOQOF are two indexes useful in 
determining a country’s level of development, the European 
Union’s Statistical Office (Eurostat) proposed that in official 
reporting, to measure the quality of life using the following 
relations [4]:  
a) material and living conditions; 
b) productive or main activity; 
c) health; 
d) education; 
e) leisure and social interactions; 
f) 
economic and physical safety; 
g) governance and basic rights; 
h) natural and living environment; 
i) 
overall experience of life. 
As far as the quality of the data is concerned, in the 
literature [5] [6] [7] can be distinguished the following four 
central dimensions which ensure a level of data quality as 
high as possible: i) data accuracy - measures the degree of 
representativeness of the data from the database in relation to 
the elements from real life which they represent; ii) data 
consistency - is the data’s property of respecting the integrity 
constraints; iii) information completeness - measure the 
capacity of the database to offer complete information at the 
user’s queries; iv) data currency - reflects the degree of 
update of the data. 
III. 
QUALITY OF LIFE INDICATORS 
Although the Gross Domestic Product Index (GDP) is one 
of the most used indicators for determining the level of 
development of a country [8], it is limited as it measures the 
quality of life only from a financial perspective. Therefore, 
scientists headed towards the identification of all factors 
which might have a significant influence over the 
population’s quality of life, such as social indicators, 
measures for the increase of the population’s welfare, 
economic measure [9], etc. As Eurostat itself specifies [4], 
the dimensions of the quality of life are grouped according to 
the functional capacities the citizens should have in order to 
identify a decent living. 
A. Material and Living Conditions 
The Material and Living Conditions (MLC) is a 
dimension which reflects the living conditions of a 
population, not only from a material point of view, but also 
from the perspective of the place where they live in. If the 
pay grade is a component which highlights the rate of 
standard living, MLC includes other relevant factors to be 
taken into account, such as the purchasing power of a 
household, the relative poverty rate, poverty risk and severe 
material depravation, etc. These distinctive factors reflect, on 
the one hand, the difficulty of satisfying the basic needs of a 
decent living, and on the other hand, the capacity of a 
population to afford expenses in order to support a decent 
living, such as contacting mortgage loans, paying bills, 
purchasing household appliances, tacking voyages inside and 
outside the frontiers of the country, etc.  
B. Productive or Main Activity 
As the time spent at work represents a significant lapse of 
time at which the individual renounces so that he/she might 
obtain benefits for him/herself, it represents an important 
factor in determining the self-respect. Thus, through a fair 
remuneration of the work undergone and through the 
evolution of the social status, individuals may feel their work 
appreciated, and their mental health is enriched by 
professional life success [10]. Therefore, the Productive or 
Main Activity (PMA) dimension is particular one as it 
measures the quality of life from the perspective of the 
individual’s social status.  
C. Health 
Health is another determining factor in calculating the 
rate of the quality of life because it directly affects the life of 
the individuals. This dimension can be calculated from the 
perspective of several factors, such as the quantity of fruits 
and vegetables consumed, the quantity of alcohol consumed 
(with a negative effect on the quality of life), the population’s 
degree of access to healthcare and the medical facilities’ 
capacity of ensuring public interest healthcare both from the 
point of view of the available infrastructure and of the 
existing qualified personnel, the rate of incidents (with a 
negative influence), average life expectancy, as well as other 
factors which directly affect the individual’s health quality.  
D. Education 
An important factor which has a significant contribution 
in determining the quality of life is represented by the level 
of education of the population, because a group with a high 
educational level may have access more easily to well-paid 
employment, which contributes to the possibility of accessing 
higher quality healthcare and to the increase of the living 
conditions. Moreover, the high level of education of the 
population is reflected in the governing and lawmaking, in 
creating a friendly environment both from the point of view 
of social interaction and from the point of view of nature 
preservation.  
E. Leisure and Social Interactions 
The fifth dimension which can measure the population’s 
quality of life, the Leisure and Social Interactions (LSI), is 
closely linked both to factors which facilitate the social 
interactions in environmental areas, such as museums, 
spectacles and to factors which are found in sports 
environments, such as the number of sports facilities.

ICDS 2019 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Digital Society and eGovernments

F. Safety 
Another dimension which has a significant influence over 
the quality of life of the population is represented by Safety. 
As the Law no. 51/1991 on National Security of Romania 
defines national security as a state of social, economic and 
political stability, we can look at the safety term as being a 
state of stability both social and economic. Therefore, the 
Safety dimension considers the individual analysis of the 
economic security (of the measures the society or individuals 
take for ensuring the individual economic security in case of 
loss of employment, variation of monthly expenses, 
mortgage and other exceptional situations) and of the 
physical security (of the factors that reflect the physical 
insecurity of a population, as the crime rate, the percentage 
of the population with a definitive penal sentence, etc.). 
G. Governance and Basic Rights 
The dimension Governance and Basic Rights (GBR) 
represents that series of factors which influence the life of 
population from the perspective of the governing and law 
making, but also from the perspective of the equality of 
opportunity no matter the political, religious or cultural 
background of the individuals in a society.  
H. Natural and Living Environment 
The dimension Natural and Living Environment (ENV) 
considers the calculating of the level of standard living of the 
population considering the quality of the environment where 
the individuals live by analyzing a series of factors, such as 
the level of pollution of the area, the measures taken to 
combat pollution, the degree of the population’s access to 
basic services (drinking water systems, electrical power 
supply systems, etc.). 
IV. 
OPEN DATA SOURCES 
From a simple perspective, by the term open data it can 
be seen as being that concept which defines the freedom of 
use, reuse and distribute data. Nevertheless, some data 
suppliers may have different perspectives regarding what it 
can be understood by openness [11], in the sense that the use, 
reuse, reworking, redistribution and reselling might have 
terms and conditions by their own, so that, even though the 
access to data is free, their use in one way or another, might 
be restricted. 
The collection of statistical was made through the API’s 
offered by the National Institute of Statistics of Romania 
(INSSE) [12], which allows the selection of open data sets 
according to topics, years and economic development area 
both in XLS format but also in CSV format. For the analyzed 
period, there have been identified data sets referring to the 
eight main topics, as the level of income and the average 
expenses of a household, the living standard of the 
population, the GDP value, the average number of employees 
and of unemployed workers, the population’s state of health, 
the level of development of the healthcare and educational 
system both from the state and private area, the number of 
leisure places, data regarding the measure for assistance and 
social protection, the rate of green spaces per head of 
population, the dimension of the drinking water supply 
system and a two data sets referring to the level of the average 
net income and the level of resident population which permits 
to calculate the main topics indicators as they have been 
presented in Table I.  
Due to the fact that INSSE does not make available a set 
of public data regarding the result of the parliamentary 
elections, these data were extracted using the portal of the 
Permanent Electoral Authority of Romania [13], where we 
identified two PDF files containing information regarding the 
turnout at the parliamentary election dated year 2008 and 
2012, and one HTML file dated year 2016. 
V. 
OPEN DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT 
Considering that the open data is a concept that enforces 
the existence of a free license for accessing the data, the open 
data quality may be expressed as it is expressed the quality of 
the data regardless their licenses, as being that state of the 
data which allows their use by consumers [14] [15]. The most 
frequently mentioned dimensions of this property [16] [5] in 
the literature being accuracy, completeness, consistency and 
timeliness. Therefore, the rate of the quality of data is directly 
related to the accuracy of the presented elements.

A. Data Currency Issue 
Data currency or timeliness is an indicator which 
measures the quality of data which reflects the degree of their 
timeliness in relation to the nature of the activity for which 
the date is being used [7]. Although the API of the INSSE 
includes an entry regarding the last date of update of the data 
sets, this date is available only for the data sets as entities, and 
not for the records from the data sets. This feature does not 
allow to identify whether the data set has been modified due 
to adding new records or whether the existing records have 
been modified.    
B. Data Source Inconsistency 
For the analyzed data sets, the data model is divided into 
categories having only 4 common columns: the economic 
development area, the reporting year, the measurement unit 
and the actual value. This discrepancy of the data sets implies 
the application of separate rules for each data category. 
Another relevant aspect of the way data is stored – the use of 
the Comma Separated Values (CSV) files, which implies 
storing data on columns in a text file, columns separated only 
by a comma or another specific separator. Therefore, storing 
data in text format restricts the user in terms of types of data 
related to the stored values, which urge the user to identify 
the data types based on the columns’ description and of the 
existing values before using these data. 
C. Data Inconsistency 
The data inconsistency can be seen as the state of the data 
of not being consistent, that is of not having the format and 
the value in conformity with the chosen data model [17] or of 
having discontinuities of data.

For the analyzed data sets, the data inconsistency is 
determined by the value of the missing record, as shown in 
Table II, considering that due to the periodical method of 
organization of the parliamentary election, the values of the 
missing years have been corrected with the one of the last 
years when parliamentary election has been organized in 
Romania. For example, for the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 
2011, for each year it has been considered the value related 
to year 2008, year when parliamentary elections have been 
undergone, proceeding the same manner for the following 
periods. 
As an exception to the previous calculation mode of the 
results of the turn-out, lacking the statistical data regarding 
the turn-out for the parliamentary elections from 2004, the 
value for the year 2007 has been calculated applying (1), 
realizing the arithmetic mean of the values relative to year 
2008-2016. 
To decrease the negative effect of the missing records 
during the process of calculating the QoLI, we have 
proceeded, taking in consideration that: i) the value 
fluctuation from one year to the other is linear; ii) by using 
(1) to calculate the average of the series, the magnitude of the 
majority of the series is low under 50% than the average.

Another aspect important to be mentioned regarding the 
data inconsistency is represented by the absence from certain 
data sets of the records classified for each county; this 
shortage restricts to an analysis on economic development 
areas, not including a detailed analysis on counties.  
VI. 
THE FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE 
Considering the complex character of the calculation of 
the Quality of Life Index, the present case of study, at the 
same time, aims at presenting the way the framework [18] has 
been conceived for the calculation of this economical-social 
indicator. Thus, who is interested in realizing the analysis 
referring to the state of living of the population is absolved 
from implementing the formulas of calculation of the QoLI, 
the only tasks that must be done being the supply of the input 
data and the interpretation of the obtained results.    
Figure 1 presents the diagram of the processes of realizing 
the QoLI framework, the first step being the analysis of the 
downloaded data sets in order to identify the common 
elements and the types of data for each individual column. 
After that, based on the formulated findings, the data model 
will be created for each analyzed data category, and for the 
missing records, the average of the respective period will be 
calculated using (1), so that the impact of the data set 
inconsistency will have an influence as light as possible when 
calculating the QoLI. 
The second stage implies the actual calculation of the 
values of the 8 QoLI main topics as they have been described 
and of the following complementary indicators: 
a) the average number of resident persons; 
b) the average net salary,

values calculated according to the reporting year and to the 
chosen economic development area. These indicators are 
used in determining the complementary statistic data, such as 
the share of the overall income of a household in relation to 
the average net earnings for the specific area; the share of the 
education establishments related to 1,000 resident persons, 
the number of square meters of green space for each 
inhabitant, and so on.  
The intermediate stage to presenting the QoLI result is 
represented by the analysis of the data, which aims at 
identifying errors and discrepancies in the calculation process 
of the indicators. For example, the school drop-out rate, the 
rate of persons involved in accidents, etc., they are all 
elements which negatively influence the calculation of the 
indicators they belong to, which implies that in the final 
formula their reverse must be considered, that is, to determine 
the proportions of population that is not affected. 
With the identification of the correction that must be 
made on the data so that they can reflect the real-life situation, 
the flow of operations come back to the sub-stage “Data 
Processing and Data Quality Assessment” for applying the 
mentioned modifications, a cycle that will be repeated until 
obtaining the expected results. In the end, the user will have 
the possibility of extracting the final result of the Quality of 
Life Index calculation classified on reporting years and on 
economic development area calculated using (2).

Using the geometric mean for the calculation of the QoLI 
is imposed by the asymmetric character of the indicators 
which compose the eight dimensions so that the linear 
compensation of the reduced values of one dimension with 
the higher values of another dimension will be avoided [19]. 
Thus, using the geometric mean for calculating the QoLI, will 
allow that a reduction of 1% of one dimension to register the 
same impact as a reduction of 1% of any other dimension. 
VII. 
DATA USAGE 
The result of the current analysis can be used both by 
governmental factors which have at their disposal the legal 
measures for combating poverty and increasing the living 
standard of the population and to other actors of the society 
interested in following the evolution of the economic and 
social development level in time. The analysis uses a series 
of statistic data broken down on reporting years and 
economic development area, which facilitates both the 
identification of the area which met a considerable advantage, 
and to those which present an index of the quality of life 
lower than the other areas.

The result of the calculation of the QoLI is presented 
using the histograms from Figure 2 and Figure 3, where it can 
be observed the evolution of the indicators in time, according 
to the economic development regions. Thus, it can be noted 
that, as expected, the Bucharest-Ilfov Region, the one which 
comprises the Romanian capital, is the most developed, being 
followed by the North-Western Region, the Western Region 
and the Central Region, and on the other side, the most 
underdeveloped region being the North-Eastern one, being 
followed by the South-Western Oltenia Region, the South-
Muntenia Region and the South-Eastern Region. 
The growth trend of the Quality of Life Index from the 
central-western region of Romania may be considered as 
being the result of the consolidation of the industrial poles as 
Cluj-Napoca, Timisoara and Brasov [20], evolution that can 
be noticed even from the statistical data regarding the foreign 
direct investment rate which the National Bank of Romania 
supplied [21] as it is in Table III. As the statistical data are 
presented, the Bucharest-Ilfov Region and the Central Region 
remain on the entire analyzed period on the top of the regions 
with the height’s foreign investment capital in Romania, and 
the North-Eastern Region and the South-Western Oltenia 
Region being classified as the most unattractive regions from 
the point of view of foreign capital attraction.  
 
 
Figure 2.  Lowest evolution of QoLI. 
 
Figure 3.  Heist evolution of QoLI.  
The importance of foreign capital attraction occurs due to 
the relation which has in the increase of the state of living of 
the population. If the financial value of the investments is 
inconstant, alongside the advantage of attracting the capital 
for the development of the private area, at the same time, the 
investors may realize technological and knowledge transfers 
with the host country, may integrate both highly-qualified 
employees and unqualified employees, investing, thus in 
human resources, they may bring new management concepts, 
may influence the local market structure determining the 
sector in which they activate to be more productive and, of 
course, may contribute to the local and national budget by 
paying taxes, which can materialize in the increase of the 
level of public investments done in the interest of the citizen 
[22] .  
Another important component which has a major impact 
on the increase of the state of living of the population is 
represented by the correct financial remuneration of the work, 
because, alongside the financial factor needed to each person 
for leaving, individuals can feel more appreciated if they are 
remunerated accordingly to the performed work [10]. 
Therefore, the increase of the self-esteem influences not only 
the individual satisfaction but also his/her productivity, 
which translates by the increase of the value of the company 
they work for, a value which can attract financial investments 
and can create new workplaces for the resident population. 
By analyzing the data relative to the value of the monthly 
income on household for year 2016 [12], presented in Table 
IV, it can be noted that in the four regions which register a 
higher QoLI indicator, the level of the income reaching 
almost 700 euro; in the Bucharest-Ilfov Region the income is 
reaching to 911 euro. On the other hand, the level of income 
on household relative to the other economic development 
regions do not even reach the level of 600 euro, in the North-
Eastern Region, the one which presents the lowest QoLI 
indicator, the level of income barely reaching 525 euro. 
VIII. 
CONCLUSION 
The analysis of the population’s living standard is a 
complex process which is considered the determining of the 
level of economic development and the degree of satisfaction 
which a group of individuals has in the society. From this 
point of view, for calculating the Quality of Life Index, 
analysts must take into account the use not only of economic 
indicators which reflect the financial situation but also of the 
social indicators which reveal the level of satisfaction of 
individuals, both on personal and professional level. 
Analyzing the statistical data previously presented, 
except for the Bucharest-Ilfov Region, it can be noted a 
considerable discrepancy between the most developed and 
the less developed economical region from Romania, for 
which the level of monthly income per household differs with 
up to 28%, and the value of foreign investments attracted in 
the North-Eastern Region represents only 25% of the value 
of the investments from the Central Region. Thus, the 
existence of these discrepancies between the economic 
development regions from  Romania may  represent an  alarm

a The monthly average of total income per household has been converted from RON to EUR accordingly to the exchange rate provided by The National Bank of Romania [23]
signal for the authorities, enforcing the realization and 
application of the public politics which should advantage the 
less developed regions for reducing the existent discrepancy 
and the increase of the level of the population state residing 
in less developed regions. 
Thus, extending dimensions proposed by Eurostat, QoLI 
Framework allows for a more complex analysis of the level 
of quality of life in a region by including factors, such as the 
degree of school and health infrastructure development, the 
number of square meters of green spaces per inhabitant, the 
share of the number of researchers per thousand inhabitants, 
etc., factors that have a significant influence on the social life 
of individuals. At the same time, the utility of the framework 
can be easily extended to any level of administrative detailing 
by including, in the constant lists, the name of the 
administrative unit which is desired to be analyzed, 
regardless of the fact that it is a city, a county, a region, a 
country or any other administrative form.  
The utility of this indicator is incontestable for any part 
involved in society, from government which need accurate 
data to identify and apply the best measures for combating 
poverty, to nongovernmental organizations which supervise 
the application of the measure on social welfare and regional 
development, up to individuals who, on the basis of the data 
supplied by the state institutions or by specialized 
organizations, can take decisions upon migration towards a 
more developed area.  
If the state institutions authorized to make forecasts and 
analysis regarding the living standard of the population have 
access to the data, natural or legal persons are strictly limited 
to the public data offered by the state institutions, which, 
unfortunately, cannot be used before processing them. 
Therefore, it is mandatory to make an analysis in order to 
ensure the quality of the data by identifying errors and 
applying specific technics for adjusting them, so that the 
identified errors will have an impact as light as possible on 
the calculation.
