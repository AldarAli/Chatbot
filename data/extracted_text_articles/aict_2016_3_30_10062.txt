Abstract –In this paper, a fullwave-mode analysis method is 
proposed for analyzing the dispersion properties of 
anisotropic coupled microstrip circuits with arbitrary 
located metallic strips in multilayer configuration. The 
numerical procedure is based on a spectral domain approach 
via an adequate choice of basis functions for current 
densities on the strips. The proposed model should be useful 
in computer-aided design of such structures in ultra-wide 
band (UWB) and millimeter-wave applications. Numerical 
results are in good agreement with data available in the 
literature. 
 
Keywords- multilayer; anisotropy; spectral technique; 
dispersion. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In microwave and optical regions, several techniques 
and technologies have been well developed, leading to 
various applications in radar, communications and other 
commercial sectors. The growing interest for coupled 
structures in microwave integrated circuits applications 
has considerably increased recently due to their various 
applications in microwave frequencies including UWB 
band  (3.1-10.6 GHz) to build mixers, modulators, filters 
and other specific circuits.  
Layers of suitable materials may be added to improve 
the performance of a device or may be required as 
essential building blocks in the design of a component. 
For example, in suspended microstrip couplers, extra-
layers of dielectrics may be used to improve directivity, 
very useful in filter design [1]. The analysis of such 
coupled structures is complicated by the inhomogeneous 
nature of the problem. The analysis method depends on a 
number of considerations, such as efficiency, accuracy, 
memory requirement and versatility.  
Anisotropic coupled microstrip-type structures with 
arbitrary located strips are the most popular circuit 
elements in microwave integrated circuits (MICs) since 
they are useful in many practical applications due to their 
flexibility in the design process and easier matching to 
external element connections [2]. In such coupled 
structures, the propagation is described in terms of C- and 
π-modes [3], which correspond to in-phase and out-of-
phase modes, respectively. As mentioned, the analysis of 
such coupled structures is complex due to the 
inhomogeneous nature of the problem.  
In this paper, the authors propose an original approach 
that combines speediness and accuracy to efficiently 
characterize coupled circuits with arbitrary located strips 
as well as in arbitrary multilayer configuration by the 
well-known spectral domain approach (SDA) method 
using the Galerkin's procedure via a suitable choice of 
basis functions.  
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we 
discuss the hybrid-mode spectral domain approach  
for 
asymmetric 
anisotropic 
coupled 
structures 
in 
multilayer configuration. Numerical results are presented 
in Section 3. Finally we summarize our major results and 
outline our future work. 
II. 
FORMULATION OF THE METHOD 
To illustrate the adopted numerical procedure used to 
evaluate the model dispersion parameters, we considered a 
shielded coupled microstrip structure with different widths 
(w1 not necessary equal to w2) in multilayer configuration 
(Figure 1). The number of layers can be arbitrarily set.

multilayer configuration [5]. The immittance approach 
allows obtaining the Green’s functions via a recursive 
process based on the determination of the equivalent 
admittances at all dielectric interfaces Hi (i=1 ... N). 
Because the propagation modes are hybrid in a 
fullwave analysis, the EM field components have been 
evaluated in each dielectric layer assuming that the hybrid 
mode is the superposition of LSE (Ey=0) and LSM (Hy=0) 
modes. So, the transverse EM field components in the 
Fourier domain can be expressed as 
  (1a) 
    
(1b) 
   
(1c)               
   (1d) 
where Ey and Hy are solutions of the field propagation 
equations [5]. αn and β are the spectral parameter and the 
phase 
constant, 
respectively, 
with 
εci=εxi=εzi 
and 
µci=µxi=µzi . The index  ∼ represents the Fourier transform 
following x. 
The following step was to use boundary conditions at 
all dielectric interfaces Hi to express the tangential electric 
field components (Ez, Ex) in terms of the currents 
densities Jx and Jz on the metallized interface Hm in the 
spectral domain. This allowed evaluating the admittance 
Green’s dyadic functions: 
  
 
 (2) 
and then, deducing the impedance form of the dyadic 
Green’s matrix [G] by a simple inversion of matrix [Y]. 
A. Resolution by Galerkin Technique 
The Galerkin’s procedure is a particular case of the 
moment method where trial functions are equal to basis 
functions. In this technique, the tangential components Jx 
and Jz of the current density on each conductor strip are 
expanded onto two complete sets of P and Q basis 
functions, respectively:  
 
  
(3) 
with ap,k and bq,k the real unknown coefficients to 
evaluate, with k = 1, 2 (left or right strip conductor of the 
coupler, respectively).  
First, the Fourier transforms of (3) are evaluated and 
substituted into (2). Next, after using the inner product 
with trial functions, the Parseval’s identity as well as the 
complementarity relations between the current and electric 
field on the two strips, we obtained an algebraic system of 
2(P+Q) homogeneous linear equations in terms of the 
2(P+Q) unknown coefficients ap,k et bq,k (k=1, 2).

The above homogeneous system was then solved for 
the phase constant β at each frequency f by setting the 
determinant of the matrix [Cj,m(ω,β)] (j, m =1... 4) to zero 
and by seeking the roots of the resulting equation. 
B. Basis functions choice criterias 
An adequate choice of basis functions is essential to 
assure a reliable solution with minimum numerical 
treatments and processing time. Indeed, a suitable choice 
of basis functions leads to a better configuration of the 
current density on the strips. This choice must respect 
several 
convergence 
criteria 
as 
detailed 
in 
[6]. 
Convergence may be speeded up by using basis functions 
whose behaviors resemble the physical distribution. 
Sinusoidal trial functions with metallic edge singularities 
have been chosen for the general nonsymmetrical case [7]:

Note that the solution accuracy for β can be 
systematically enhanced by increasing the number of basis

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
To confirm the adequate choice of basis functions, we 
analyzed a bilayer nonsymmetrical shielded coupler. 
Figures 2 and 3 show the convergence of the effective 
permittivity versus the total number of basis functions Nfb 
(equal to 2*(P+Q)) and the total number of Fourier terms 
Ntf. Note that 100 Fourier terms and about 8 basis 
functions were sufficient to achieve a good convergence.

Moreover, we note that narrow strips (w1 = w2 = 0.18mm) 
require more spectral terms compared to wide ones  
(w1 = w2 =0.36mm). A good compromise was found 
between accuracy, CPU time and memory storage with 
regard to differential methods since 4 basis functions per 
current density components were sufficient to reach 
convergence. Compared to differential methods which 
require a very dense mesh for a very good accuracy 
resulting on a large CPU time (as finite element method or 
FDTD method), the proposed technique is faster with a 
minimum memory storage.

Figure 4, showing the variation of the determinant of 
Ci,j(β), demonstrates the simultaneous existence of two 
distinct solutions for β, very similar to those published in 
[7]. Note that the authors in [7] used the resonance 
transverse method (TRM), generally used to get the wave 
propagation constant in waveguides including dielectric 
ones. It takes advantage of the fact that a standing wave is 
present along a certain direction (transverse with respect 
to the main propagation direction), due to purely reactive 
loads at both ends of the transmission line (which 
represents the wave propagation). Compared to TRM 
which is an integral method, the CPU time was reduced of 
about 20% depending of spectral terms Ntf and the 
number of basis functions Nfb 
Figure 5 shows the variation of the effective 
permittivity εeff for different values of h1. The results 
agree well with [7]. The evolution of the effective 
permittivity is characterized by the existence of three 
regions: first, εeff decreases with h1 for both c and π 
modes, this can be explained by the high concentration of 
fields in the thin substrate (near horizontal walls of the 
shield). Then, εeff reaches a constant value of about 1.6 
corresponding to equal thicknesses between the substrate 
and the air region.  
Finally, εeff decreases from h1= 6.6mm, due to the 
larger thickness of the substrate. The effective permittivity 
is higher for the lowest values of the substrate thickness.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper highlights an efficient and fast way to 
determine the fullwave numerical solutions required in 
multilayered coupled microstrip line analysis with 
arbitrary located metallic strips. Such devices are used in 
various applications in microwave integrated circuits, 
particularly in wireless communication, multiplexors, 
shifters, and delay lines, to name a few. To achieve this 
aim, we used the spectral domain technique via an 
adequate choice of basis functions for c- and π-modes 
through the Galerkin's procedure. The computed results 
are in good agreement with data available in the literature. 
The proposed CAD approach should be useful in high 
frequencies where the dispersion effects cannot be 
neglected.
