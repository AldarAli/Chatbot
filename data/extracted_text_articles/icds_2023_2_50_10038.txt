Abstract—The 2019 European Union (EU) Open Data 
Directive requires that public sector data should be open by 
design and by default. The EU Digital Economy & Society Index 
ranked Ireland as second in terms of data maturity amongst the 
EU Member States. In Ireland, local government is administered 
by 31 local authorities. In light of the Open Data Directive being 
transposed into Irish law in 2021, this paper explores the 
commitment of local authorities in the Republic of Ireland to the 
provision of open data by examining their activity on data.gov.ie, 
the Irish national data portal, and the treatment of open data in 
local authority corporate plans and digital strategies. We find 
preliminary evidence of a disconnect between national policy and 
local government activities and a potential urban-rural divide 
with respect to local government open data provision.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Open data is defined as data that meets three conditions i.e., 
it is (i) accessible at no more than the cost of reproduction, 
without limitations based on user identity or intent, (ii) in a 
digital, machine readable format for interoperation with other 
data; and (iii) free of restriction on use or redistribution in its 
licensing conditions [1]. Open government data is concerned 
with making Public Sector Information (PSI) freely available.  
in open formats and ways that enable public access and 
facilitate exploitation [2]. A wide range of political and social, 
economic, and operational and technical benefits have been 
ascribed to open data, and open government data specifically 
[3]. For example, the European Union (EU) [4] cite a number 
of reasons for supporting greater access to PSI and open data 
specifically including: 
 
• stimulating economic growth and spur innovation: public 
data has significant potential for re-use in new products 
and services; 
 
• helping address societal challenges with the development 
of innovative solutions such as in healthcare or in trans-
port; 
 
• enhancing evidence-based policymaking and increase 
efficiency in public administrations; 
• becoming a critical asset for the development of new 
technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), which 
require the processing of vast amounts of high-quality 
data; 
 
• fostering the participation of citizens in political and 
social life and increase the transparency of government. 
in open formats and ways that enable public access and

• fostering the participation of citizens in political and 
social life and increase the transparency of government. 
 
The economic value of PSI should not be underestimated. 
A 2018 study by Deloitte suggests that the total direct 
economic value of PSI is expected to increase from a baseline 
of €52 billion in 2018 for the EU28 to C194 billion in 2030 
[5]. 
Driven by these potential benefits, the European Union 
(EU) has sought to encourage, promote, and regulate the 
provision and (re)use of PSI for over a decade. More recently, 
the EU has shifted its emphasis from PSI to open government

data. This support is reflected in the reframing by the EU of 
the 2003 Public Sector Information Directive as the 2019 
Open Data Directive whose central principle is that public 
sector information data should be open by design and by 
default while ensuring a consistent level of protection of 
public interest objectives including the protection of personal 
data [6]. In effect, this means that public sector data in EU 
Member States should be considered open by default unless 
access is restricted or excluded [7]. It has been long-
recognised that open data has little has little intrinsic value 
i.e., its value is created by its use [3]. A significant feature of 
the Open Data Directive is that the EU specifically recognises 
that not all data is equal. 
 
Chapter V of the Directive specifically defines and 
prioritises high-value data sets. Article 14(2) defines high-
value datasets as having the potential to (a) generate 
significant socioeconomic or environmental benefits and 
innovative ser-vices; (b) benefit a high number of users, in 
particular SMEs; 
 
(c) assist in generating revenues; and (d) be combined with 
other datasets [6]. Article 13(1) refers to six initial thematic 
categories of high-value datasets - geospatial, earth 
observation and environment, meteorological, statistics, 
companies and company ownership, and mobility. [6]. Article 
17 required Member States to transpose the Directive into 
local laws, regulations, and administrative provisions by 17 
July 2021 [6]. 
 
 
The EU Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) ranks 
EU Member States based on their commitment to open data 
based on an assessment of the Member State’s open data 
policy, open data impact, open data portal, and open data 
quality [8]. In 2022, Ireland was ranked second of the EU28 
countries for open data maturity with a score of 95% of the 
maximum available score. The 2019 Open Data Directive was 
transposed into Irish law by S.I. No. 376 of 2021, the 
European Communities (Open Data & Re-use of Public 
Sector Information) Regulations 2021 and came into force on 
22 July 2021 [7]. As well as promoting and encouraging the 
sharing of open data by public sector bodies and emphasising 
the principle of open by design and default, Irish law requires 
that where data is made available for re-use in open format, 
this data must be linked to the national open data portal, 
data.gov.ie [7]. These regulations apply to all public sector 
bodies including local authorities [7]. Indeed, the Department 
of Public Expenditure and Reform Open Data Strategy 2017-
2022 and the Office of the Government Chief Information 
Officer’s (OGCIO) Public Service Data Strategy 2019 – 2023 
strategies both reinforce the general principles of the Open 
Data Directive. 
There are currently 31 local authorities in the Republic of 
Ireland - 26 county councils, three city councils (Cork, Dublin 
and Galway), and two city and county councils (Limerick and 
Waterford). This paper explores the commitment of local 
authorities in the Republic of Ireland to the provision of open 
data. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows; 
Section 2 outlines the data, methodology, results and 
discussion, and Section 3 concludes with the implications of 
the findings. 
 
II. METHODS, RESULTS & 
DISCUSSION 
 
The study involves all 31 local authorities in the Republic 
of Ireland. Data was collected in December and January 2023. 
Data on open data provision and public use was collected 
manually from data.gov.ie, the Irish national data portal. To 
assess the strategic commitment of a local authority to open 
data, corporate plans and digital strategies (where available) 
were reviewed for references to open data. 
As of January 2023, data.gov.ie featured 14,812 datasets 
from 160 publishers. Our results suggest 20 (65%) of the 32 
local authorities were registered as publishers on data.gov.ie 
although three of the registered local authorities had yet to 
publish a dataset. The 20 local authorities registered represent 
12.5% of publishers on data.gov.ie. In total, the remaining 17 
local authorities had published 1,152 datasets. Local 
authorities represent a mere 7.8% of all datasets on 
data.gov.ie. The average number of datasets published by the 
17 active local authorities on data.gov.ie was 67. Only five of 
the 12 local authorities published more than the average. The 
20 local authorities registered represent 12.5% of publishers 
on data.gov.ie. In total, the remaining 17 local authorities had 
published 1,152 datasets. Local authorities represent a mere 
7.8% of all datasets on data.gov.ie. The average number of 
datasets published by the 17 active local authorities on 
data.gov.ie was 67. Only five of the 12 local authorities 
published more than the average. The local authority dataset 
average is significantly lower than the average for data.gov.ie 
as a whole, i.e., 93 datasets. Six local authorities account for 
over 84% (968) of the published datasets, four of which are 
associated with the greater Dublin area (Dublin City Council, 
Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council, and 
Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council) and a further two 
in Connacht located in the West of the country i.e., 
Roscommon County Council and Galway County Council. 
Six city councils and county councils located fully in the 
functional urban area of cities accounted for 56% (646) of all 
datasets suggesting a significant urban-rural divide with 
respect to open dataset availability. Of the remaining 506 
datasets, one county council, Roscommon, accounts for 56% 
(284) of the datasets.

Dataset views was used as a proxy for utility. The 1,152 
datasets published by Irish local authorities generated 189,659 
views, an average of 6,118 views per dataset. Dublin City 
Council alone accounts for 72% of all local authority dataset 
views and the greater Dublin functional area accounts for over 
83% of all local authority dataset views. The urban-rural 
divide is further emphasised when views from other cities are 
included rising to nearly 88% of views. Table I summarises 
our findings by website. In a recent study of 146 cities 
worldwide by the United Nations Local Online Services Index 
(LOSI) found that 46% of the city portals assessed for the 
LOSI 2022 study provide open data [11]. Against this 
backdrop, 17 active open data publishers representing 54% of 
local authorities may be viewed in a positive light. However, 
LOSI measure cities from a wide range of countries 
worldwide, most of which are outside of the EU where open 
data provision is regulated 
To evaluate the strategic commitment and prioritisation of 
open data for local authorities in the sample, the most recent 
corporate plan and the most recent digital strategy (where 
available) were reviewed for references to open data. 
  Table II summarises our findings by website. First, while 
nearly all local authority corporate plans reference a desire to 
be open and transparent and a significant number listing the 
national open data plan in their reports, only two local 
authorities include a substantive reference in their corporate 
plan. Second, as can be seen from Table II, eleven local 
authorities did not have a current digital strategy accessible on 
their website. Of the remaining 20 local authorities, 12 had a 
substantive reference to open data in their digital strategy. 
However, despite the widespread lack of documented strategy, 
this should not be interpreted as a lack of open data 
prioritisation. Both Dublin City Council and Roscommon 
County Council, for example, have significant presences on 
data.gov.ie (see Table I), and both have their own data portal, 
and its own data portal, data.smartdublin.ie. and data - 
roscoco.opendata.arcgis.com. 
 
III. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Our results suggest that there is a disconnect between the 
EU and national policies and plans for open data and local 
authorities. This surfaces both in a lack of strategic intent as 
evidenced by the dearth of references to open data in local 
authority corporate plans, by a lack of action as evidenced by 
the relatively small number of datasets being contributed by 
local authorities, and finally by a lack of impact as evidenced 
by the number of views per dataset. Extant research posits a 
wide range of implementation and barriers to use that impede 
open government data projects including an inability to 
extract value from the data, local government willingness to 
share data, task complexity and individual or institutional 
skills and capabilities, amongst others [3] [12] [13]. In sum, 
there are challenges in will and skill for both data providers 
and users that need to be understood and overcome if the 
much-vaunted benefits of open data are to be accrued. 
Our results also suggest a potential urban rural divide with 
respect to the provision and re-use of open data. In our 
sample, the greater Dublin area accounts for 83% of the open 
data provided by local authorities on data.gov.ie. Even if high-
value datasets that generate significant socioeconomic or 
societal value are provided and exploited, they are likely to be 
biased towards urban communities thereby exacerbating 
existing digital and societal divides. 
In many respects while the Open Data Directive and 
associated regulations require local authorities to make PSI 
available by default and design, enforcement, and indeed 
exploitation, is effectively left to the public. Janssen et al. [3] 
note that merely publishing and providing open government 
data is not enough, open data is only value when used, not 
only citizens and companies but the public sector. Ten years 
ago, Bertot et al. [13] noted a lack of evaluative metrics for 
open government data. Today, international benchmarks such 
as DESI and LOSI, and to some extent this paper, are limited 
due to their continued emphasis on supporting policies, 
availability of open government data and input-related 
42

metrics, such as the number of datasets, views, and 
downloads, rather than outcomes from the use of open data. 
To paraphrase Golding [14], open government data has “the 
potential to nourish and enhance the public sphere” but not 
without fixing the disconnect between national and local 
government policy and action, and the provision and 
exploitation of open data.
