Abstract—Commercial advertising via vehicular ad hoc 
networks (VANETs) is a promising application.  It allows 
organizations to target drivers and passengers with the aim of 
promoting their products and services.  The implementation of 
such an application will not be successful without guaranteeing 
that these ads will not include any malicious information, and the 
ads will be broadcasted.  This paper will apply a cryptographic 
protocol to secure the dissemination of commercial ads.  Secure 
incentives for drivers reading/watching the ad will be introduced.  
Cheating, including multiple incentives for the same ad by the 
same driver will be dealt with.

I. INTRODUCTION 
   Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) treat vehicles in their 
vicinity as wireless nodes.  Vehicles within this area can 
communicate with each other.  Any vehicle exiting the zone 
will lose its communication with that VANET.  Vehicular ad 
hoc networks allow vehicles to broadcast messages to all other 
vehicles within the range.  This presents a great opportunity 
for various applications to be implemented on vehicles using 
their computing power and storage capabilities.  Safety-critical 
information including speed, heading, and position in addition 
to various warning on accidents and road conditions, and 
infotainment can be broadcasted by vehicles using vehicle-to-
vehicle communication.  Vehicular ad hoc networks 
(VANETs) are a subclass of mobile ad hoc networks 
(MANETs).  However, VANETs present characteristics that 
are noticeably different from many generic MANETs. 
VANETs are considered as a pledging style for future 
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). They possess no 
static infrastructure.   Consequently, they expect vehicles to 
deliver network functionality [1].   VANETs are extricated 
from other classes of ad hoc networks through their hybrid 
network architectures, node movement features, and non-
traditional new application settings. As a result, VANETs call 
for numerous unique research challenges.  Furthermore, the 
design of an effective routing protocol for VANETs is 
undoubtedly vital [2].  Vehicular ad hoc networks can provide 
a wide variety of services.  However, they are subject to a 
number of challenges including network architecture, 
protocols for physical and link layers, and routing algorithms 
[3].  Vehicular ad hoc networks will not only make safety and 
lifesaving applications a reality, but will also turn out to be a 
formidable communication instrument for their users [4]. 
   With the increasing number of various attacks on wireless 
networks, security becomes a critical challenge for VANETs 
and will continue to be so even after it is widely implemented.  
VANETs are subject to many attacks including denial of 
service, Sybil, hardware, software, sinkhole, impersonation, 
and flooding attacks. To ensure effective security, the security 
requirements; 
availability, 
authentication, 
integrity, 
confidentiality, and non-repudiation must be satisfied. 
    Considerable work on VANETs security has been pursued 
to ensure the above mentioned security requirements are met. 
Most of this work adopted cryptology.  Symmetric and, 
asymmetric cryptology, and tamper resistance hardware were 
suggested.  For some authors, cryptographic certificates were 
an option.    Other authors investigated various threats, 
particularly threats related to security requirements, and 
created various security protocols.   Standardization related to 
approaches of furnishing security services and protecting 
driver’s privacy were analyzed.  Gillani et al. [5] examined 
several aspects of VANETs security including security threats, 
challenges in providing security in VANETs environment, 
security requirements, and attributes of security solutions.  
The need for robust VANET networks is obviously related to 
their security and privacy characteristics. Various types of 
security problems and challenges of VANET, and a set of 
solutions to solve these challenges and problems have been 
analyzed and discussed in [6].  Al-Kahtani [7] stressed that 
designing security mechanisms to authenticate and validate 
transmitted messages between vehicles, and remove intruders 
from the network are substantially critical in VANETs. The 
author also reported several existing and possible security 
attacks and techniques to enhance the security of VANETs.  
Security 
and 
privacy 
are 
obligatory 
in 
vehicular 
communications 
for 
successful 
acknowledgment 
and 
utilization of VANET technology. Every vehicular application 
must be meticulously tested for security before it is

implemented in the real world. Simulation tools have proved 
to be very effective for such testing [8].   The security of 
VANET has mostly inspired the current research efforts.  
Thorough solutions to safeguard the vehicular ad hoc 
networks against adversaries and attackers still need to be 
developed to arrive at an adequate level for both the driver and 
manufacturer to achieve safety of drivers and security of 
applications and infotainment [9].  Details of further attempts 
to secure VANETs and its applications could be found in [10]-
[17]. 
   Commercial advertising via vehicular ad hoc networks 
(VANETs) is a promising application.  It allows organizations 
to target drivers and passengers with the aim of promoting 
their products and services that can possibly solve a problem 
in their lives. Advertising through VANETs will get the word 
out rapidly and more visibly to customers.  Customers in a 
vehicle would have the opportunity to listen to or watch ads 
that serve their needs.  Such advertising can compete with TV 
ads due to the fact that many audiences ignore most of the ad 
breaks on TV or get/do something else during those breaks. 
   The growth in market prospects and potentials necessitates 
further research on mobile marketing, such as mobile 
advertisement.  Mobile advertisements intermingle with 
customers on one-to-one basis via messages through the use of 
mobile devices [18].  Wireless technology has initiated new 
channels of marketing communication and innovation of 
advertisement media, such as the mobile advertisement 
platform.  Mobile advertisement relies on the use of wireless 
networks to dispense information about products to consumers 
in a localized, specialized and customized manner [19].  
People making use of modern wireless technology are more 
likely to consider mobile networks as their daily entertainment 
device than watching TV and possibly reading newspapers 
[20], [21]. Advertisement with mobile networks can highly 
target customers who will find reading or watching 
advertisement through mobile network more enjoyable and 
valuable [22]. These reasons provide mobile marketing with 
an effective means for advertisers to directly reach out for 
their potential consumers more effectively [23]. 
   A secure incentive framework for commercial ad 
dissemination in VANETs was introduced by Li et al. [24].  
The presented approach relied on public key infrastructure to 
provide secure incentives for cooperating nodes.  The 
framework relied on vehicles receiving ads and disseminating 
them to other vehicles.  The possibility of cheating by some 
drivers who can send receipts without even examining the ad 
is very high.  Multiple receipts for the same ad by the same 
vehicle will go undetected. Furthermore, the authors used 
public keys to encrypt ads.  Public keys are inefficient for 
encrypting large messages.  Zhu [25] introduced the security 
requirements 
for 
service-oriented 
vehicular 
networks.  
Commercial content distribution is one of these services.  
Secure payments are possibly needed for some commercial 
application in VANETs [26]. 
   This paper proposes a secure commercial ad broadcasting via 
VANETs.  The security architecture for the dissemination of 
the ad is integrated with the vehicular ad hoc network security 
architecture proposed   by the authors in [27].  Various 
cryptology protocols will be presented, and the security of 
incentives will be implemented.  The approach followed in this 
paper also treats possible cheating including drivers passing the 
ad code to their friends to claim incentives without 
reading/watching the ad, and requesting multiple incentives for 
the same ad by the same vehicle.  Section II presents the ad 
broadcasting architecture.  Section III demonstrates public key 
certificates distribution.  Organization to ad administration 
communication and state-level RSU to ad administration 
communication are introduced in Sections IV and V 
respectively.  Section VI provides the state-level RSU to 
county-level RSU communication.  Sections VII, VIII, and IX 
describe county-level RSU to city-level RSU communication, 
city-level RSU to street-level RSU communication, and street-
level RSU to vehicle communication respectively.  The paper 
is concluded in Section X. 
II. AD BROADCASTING SECURITY ARCHITECTURE 
   The ad broadcasting architecture is superimposed on the 
multi-level security architecture for vehicular ad hoc networks 
introduced by the authors in [27].  It is re-drawn to serve the 
purpose of the ad broadcasting security architecture.  The ad 
issuing organization (AORG), ad authority (AUTH), and the 
ad administration authority (ADMN) are added to it.  Fig. 1 
illustrates the ad broadcasting security architecture that will 
guide the security protocols.   The right hand side of this 
figure represents the security architecture for vehicular ad hoc 
networks mentioned above.  This is augmented by the left 
hand side part to include secure ad dissemination.  Note that 
apart from the box for RSUC, there supposed to be a number 
of boxes for all levels on the right hand side of Fig. 1 to 
indicate many states, counties, and cities.  
   The roadside units (RSUS) are organized in a hierarchal 
fashion.  The root of this tree is the Country-Level RSU 
(RSUC).  State-Level RSUs (RSUS) are connected to the 
(RSUC).  Likewise, County-Level RSUs (RSUCO), City-Level 
RSUs (RSUCI), and Street-Level roadside units (RSUST) are 
connected to RSUS, RSUCO, and (RSUCI) respectively.  Each 
Street-Level RSU is in charge of all vehicles passing through 
the street (or portion of the street for long streets) under its 
authority.  RSUs within the same level can only communicate 
through the parent node they belong to.  The computing power 
and capacity of RSU increases when moving upwards through 
the tree.  Detailed information about vehicles is stored at the 
State-Level RSU (RSUS).  With the exception of RSUC, there 
are many RSUS, RSUCO, RSUCI, and RSUST at their levels.    
However, only one RSU of each is shown in Fig. 1. 
   The ad authority (AUTH) is in charge of issuing certificates 
to the ad issuing organizations (companies interested in 
promoting their products or services), the ad administration 
authority (ADMN), and the State-Level RSU (RSUS).  For 
each state, there is only one ad authority and one ad 
administration authority.  In other words, one AUTH and one 
ADMIN will manage ads for the cities within the state.

Figure 1.  Ad broadcasting security architecture 
 
   The communication between RSUCT and RSUST, and RSUST 
and vehicles follows the security protocols used in [27].    In 
these protocols, RSUs at each level create their own private 
and public keys and exchange their public keys.  Each parent 
RSU creates a master key.  The master key and the ID of the 
parent node are encrypted with the public keys of the children 
nodes and forwarded to them.  At this point all nodes have a 
shared master key with their parent nodes.  The public and 
private keys are then discarded.  Each parent node creates a 
session key and encrypts it with the master key.   Once the 
session keys are obtained, messages can be exchanged.  To 
send any message between a child and a parent, the hash 
function of the message is appended to the message and both 
are encrypted with the session key.  Note that Street-Level 
RSU (RSUST) creates public key certificates for all vehicles 
entering its street.  This will be used by vehicles when 
broadcasting messages to other vehicles. 
   The ad material is sent by the ad issuing organizations 
(AORG) to the ad administration authority (ADMN) together 
with the ad ID (AID) and ad period (ADP).  ADMN checks 
the ad against the legal, social, and ethical constraints.  It later 
negotiates the cost with the ad issuing company.  The cost 
includes what the administration authority charges, the State-
Level RSU charges, and the coupon amount/number of points 
that will be allocated to vehicles reading or watching the ad.  
The State-Level charges include the amounts allocated to itself, 
the county, city, and Street-Level RSUs. Every ad contains an 
ad code (ADC), which will be used for incentives purposes. 
Upon completion of this part of the protocol, the ad material is 
forwarded by ADMN to the State-Level (RSUs).  The Street-
Level RSUs will receive the ad material from its parent City-
Level node (RSUCI) and securely broadcast it to the vehicles 
within its street authority.  Ads (clip or text and images) are 
mainly large messages.  Public key cryptology tends to be 
very slow and inefficient when dealing with such large 
messages.  Therefore, the ad administration authority (ADMN) 
will create two session keys, KS1 and KS2, which will be 
shared with AORG and RSUS respectively.  These two keys 
will be valid until the ad is completely administered.  This will 
occur when ADMN receives the charges from AORG. 
   The Street-Level RSUs (RSUST) ensures via secure 
communication that vehicles within its responsibility have 
read/watched the ad when they receive the ad code (ADC).  
This can only be obtained when reaching the end of the ad.  
Information regarding the participating vehicles will be 
forwarded to the parent RSUCI for charging purposes.  At the 
expiration date of the ad, the City-Level RSU will send info 
about all the participating vehicles to the RSUS via the RSUCO.  
The RSUS will send the charging information for all the cities 
within that state to the ad administration authority (ADMN) 
for charging purposes. Any incentive system for participating 
vehicles can be utilized provided it is secure. However, in this 
paper, coupon and points redemption will be used.  RSUS, 
RSUCO, RSUCT and RSUST will receive dollar amounts.   
   To better understand the protocols, the participating parties 
are introduced in Table 1.  Table 2 depicts the protocols 
notations and symbols used in the protocols. 
III. PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATES DISTRIBUTION 
   The Ad Administration Authority (ADMN), the Ad Issuing 
Organizations (AORG), and the State-Level RSU (RSUS) 
request their public key certificates from the Ad Authority 
(AUTH).  The public key of the Ad Authority, PUAUTH is 
made known to all these parties above.  The public key, ID, 
and a nonce for each party are encrypted with the public key 
of the Ad Authority and forwarded to it. 
 
RSUS     AUTH: E[PUAUTH, (PUS || IDS || NS)] 
ADMN  AUTH: E[PUAUTH, (PUADMN || IDADMN || NADMN)] 
AORG   AUTH: E[PUAUTH, (PUAORG || IDAORG || NAORG)] 
 
   The Ad Authority decrypts each message and creates public 
key certificates for the three parties and attaches the original 
nonce encrypted with the party’s public key. 
 
CRS     = E[PRAUTH, (PUS || IDUS || T1  || T2)] 
CRADMN   = E[PRAUTH, (PUADMN || IDADMN || T1  || T2)] 
CRAORG    = E[PRAUTH, (PUAORG || IDAORG || T1  || T2)]

AUTH  RSUS:    CRS    || E(PUS, NS) 
AUTH  ADMN: CRADMN || E(PUADMN, NADMN) 
AUTH  AORG:  CRAORG  || E(PUAORG, NAORG) 
    
   The certificates include a timestamp, T1, and a certificate 
validity period (expiration date), T2.  The original nonce are 
encrypted with the public key of the party and attached for 
further assurance that the message is not a replay.

IV. ORGANIZATION-TO-AD ADMINISTRATION COMMUNICATION 
   This sub-protocol involves the ad approval and costing, and 
securely handling incentives. 
A. Ad Approval and Costing 
   During this communication, the ad will be either accepted or 
rejected.  In addition, the charges will be set.  These charges 
will include the incentives which will be paid to vehicles.  
These will be taken care of later in this paper.   The integrity 
of all messages is important. 
   The 
Ad 
Issuing 
Organization 
(AORG) 
and 
Ad 
Administration Authority (ADMIN) exchange certificates, 
validate the currency of each other’s certificate, and extract 
the public key and ID of the other party.  ADMN creates a 
session key, KS1, to be shared with AORG.  This session key 
and the ID of ADMN are encrypted with PRADMN and then 
with PUAORG and forwarded to AORG.  After carrying out the 
needed decryptions to get KS1 and verifying the sender, 
AORG sends a request to ADMN for ad dissemination.  The 
request includes the ad ID (AID), the ad as a clip or text (AD), 
ad period (ADP), hash of the ad, H(AD), AORG’s ID, and a 
timestamp, TAORG. AD and H(AD) are encrypted with KS1.  
The rest are encrypted with AORG’s private key and then with 
the public key of ADMN.   
 
Z = E[ KS1, AD || H(AD)] 
X = AID || IDAORG || ADP || TAORG  
AORG  ADMN: E[PUADMN, E(PRAORG, X)] || Z 
 
   ADMN will first decrypt the first part of the message using 
its private key and then with the public key of AORG.  It then 
decrypt Z with KS1 to get AD and H(AD), calculates the hash 
code of AD and compare it with H(AD).  It will also check the 
timestamp to ensure the message’s currency.   Having verified 
the hash and timestamp, ADMN will examine the Ad to see if 
is not violating any legal, social, or ethical requirements.  It 
then, extracts the Ad Code (ADC), which can only be obtained 
when the end of the ad is reached.  The ADC will be used for 
incentive purposes in the future.  ADMN also uses it as an 
assurance to AORG that the ad has been processed by ADMN.  
Finally, a message containing AID, ADC, ID, Reject/Accept 
(R/A), and Ad Dissemination Cost (ACOST) will be 
encrypted with AORG’s public key PUAORG.  This implies one 
of the messages below will be sent depending on whether the 
ad is accepted or rejected.  Let Y = AID || ADC || IDAORG || 
IDADMN. 
 
ADMN  AORG: E[PUAORG, A || Y || ACOST] or 
ADMN  AORG: E[PUAORG, R || Y] 
 
   If the ad is rejected, no further communication for that ad 
will be followed.  Otherwise, AORG decrypts the message 
and verifies AID and ADC.  It either agrees or disagrees with 
the cost.  IDAORG and IDADMN are used as assurance 
components.  If AORG agrees, it sends the following message 
to ADMN: 
41

AICT 2015 : The Eleventh Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications

AORG  ADMN: E[PUADMN, (PRAORG, Y || ACOST || 
AGREE)] 
 
   Upon receiving this message and decrypting it, ADMN will 
verify the agreement and the stated cost.  Once again, the two 
IDs, IDAORG and IDADMN, are used for assurance purposes. 
B. Secure Incentives Handling 
   ADMN adds the total amounts for the coupons/points 
received from the RSUS to its charges and the charges of the 
state.  This represents the total amount charged for that ad. 
M = IDAORG || IDADMN || ADC || AID || TOTAL 
ADMN  AORG: E[PUAORG, E(PRADMN, M || H(M)] 
 
   AORG will subtract ACOST from TOTAL to get the total 
incentives for vehicles.  It will then divide the result by the 
coupon value or number of points allocated to this ad to find 
out how many vehicles read/watched the ad.  Having done that, 
TOTAL will be transferred to ADMN using any secure 
approach. 
V. STATE-LEVEL RSU-TO-AD ADMINISTRATION 
COMMUNICATION 
   This section introduces the ad material and incentive 
forwarding sub-protocols.    
A. Ad Material Forwarding 
   The Ad Administration Authority forwards the ad material 
to the State-Level RSU.  In addition, ADMN sends the 
monetary amount to the RSUS.  It will either accept the ad or 
return to ADMN in case of any problem.     Both ADMN and 
RSUS swap over certificates.  If the certificate is valid, the ID 
and public keys are retrieved.  ADMN creates a session key, 
KS2, to be shared with RSUS.  ADMN then forms a message 
containing IDADMN, the ad ID (AID), ad code (ADC), ad 
period (ADP), IDAORG, and coupon amount or number of 
points (C/P) all encrypted with PRADMN first and then with 
PUS.  It then attaches AD || H(AD) after encrypting them with 
KS2.  The resulting message is sent to RSUS.   
 
Z = E[KS2, AD || H(AD)] 
X = IDADMN || AID || ADC || ADP || IDAORG || C/P 
ADMN  RSUS: E[PUS, E(PRADMN, X)] || Z 
 
   RSUS performs the needed decryptions, verifies the hash 
code of the ad equals H(AD), ensures the ad code is the same 
as ADC and IDADMN  is a valid ID.  It also validates the ad 
period to make sure it is not an expired ad.  If there is an issue 
with all these checks, a message containing the problem will 
be sent.  Examples include “Invalid ID” and “Mismatched 
ADCs.”   The world “PROBLEM” will be used.  If there is no 
problem, “VALID” will be attached to the message.  
 
Y = IDS || ADC || AID 
RSUS  ADMN: E(PUADMN, Y || PROBLEM) 
RSUS  ADMN: E(PUADMN, Y || VALID) 
 
B. Incentive Forwarding 
   The responsibility of the RSUS in this communication is to 
forward a list of vehicles to the ADMN for incentives 
purposes. The information about vehicles involved in the ad 
will be received from the County-Level RSUs (RSUCO). 
   At the expiration date of an ad (ADP), the RSUS first ensures 
that no vehicle within the state will get multiple incentives for 
the same ad.  Having done that, the State-Level RSU sends a 
message, M, containing the name of the driver, IDV, address 
(ADR), ADC, AID, C/P, and H(M) encrypted with  PRS and 
then with ADMN’s public key. 
 
M= IDS || NAME || ADR || ADC || IDV || AID || ADC || C/P 
RSUS  ADMN: E[PUADMN, E(PRS, M || H(M))] 
 
   ADMIN decrypts this message and verifies there are no 
duplicate incentives for the same ad for the IDV that was 
received. The total incentives (coupon amount or number of 
points) are then updated.  This will be done for all the 
different ads.  At the end of the month, a coupon or total 
number of points will be mailed to the vehicle’s driver. 
 
VI. STATE-LEVEL RSU-TO-COUNTY-LEVEL RSU 
COMMUNICATION 
   The State-Level RSU maintains vehicle database.  It 
transmits the ad materials to all counties and receives all the 
anonymous IDs used for each vehicle at all counties, and the 
incentive details for all vehicles.  It uses the received 
information to update its database of vehicles.  In US, the 
minimum number of counties is 3 and the maximum is 254.  
Large counties will have more streets.  This will demand more 
street-level RSUs (RSUST) and more advanced equipment’s to 
improve performance.  The stretch of a street assigned to an 
RSU will designate the maximum number of vehicles under 
the responsibility of that RSU.  Therefore, the limit on the 
number of vehicles is only determined by the capacity of the 
allocated street section.  
 
   The state forwards the ad material continued in M below 
after encrypting it with the session key, KSC, shared with 
RSUCO to the County-Level RSU: 
 
M= IDCO || IDS || AID || ADC || AD || H(AD) || ADP || C/P   
RSUS  RSTCO: E(KSC, M|| H(M)) 
 
   The RSUS receives the IDV and IDVA for all vehicles from 
all counties.  The records in the State-Level database will be 
updated for each vehicle.  Note, IDST indicates where the IDVA 
was issued.  In other words, it is the ID of street 
accommodating the vehicle at that time. 
 
M = IDCO || IDS || IDST || IDV || IDVA 
RSUCO  RSTS: E(KSC, M|| H(M))

AICT 2015 : The Eleventh Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications

   Each county will send the incentives information for all 
vehicles within its cities after verifying no duplications exist 
for a vehicle among its cities with regards to the same ad. 
 
M = IDVA || IDCO || AID || ADC || ADP || C/P 
RSUCO  RSTS: E(KSC, M|| H(M)) 
 
VII. COUNTY-LEVEL RSU-TO-CITY-LEVEL RSU COMMUNICATION 
    In this communication sub-protocol, the ad material 
dispatching, storing vehicle information and incentive 
handling will be dealt with. 
A. Ad Material Dispatching 
   The RSUCO sends the ad material to the City-Level RSUs in 
addition to its ID and the ID of each RSUCI within that county. 
 
M= IDCI || IDCO || AID || ADC || AD || H(AD) || ADP || C/P 
RSUCO  RSTCI: E(KSCO, M|| H(M)) 
 
   KSCO is the shared session key between RSUCO and RSUCI.  
RSUCI will decrypt this message, verify the sender, check the 
integrity of the ad, and obtain the ad material. 
 
B. Storing Vehicle Information 
   The County-Level RSU (RSUCO) receives all vehicle IDs 
with all their IDVA’s, and the location where ID was issued.  
This location is in fact the Street-Level RSU’s ID.  The RSUCI 
sends the RSUCO the following information about each vehicle 
at each location (street): 
 
M = IDCO || IDCT || IDST || IDV || IDVA  
RSUCI  RSTCO: E(KSCO, M|| H(M)) 
 
 
   Here, KSCO is the session key shared between RSUCI and 
RSUCO.  There could normally be a number of such messages 
for the same vehicle, but for different ads.  The RSUCO will 
store this information together with that received from the 
State-Level RSU as mentioned above in its database. This 
history information will be beneficial for law enforcement 
authority to trace a vehicle if a need arises. 
 
C. Incentive Handling 
   Having verified there are no multiple incentives for the same 
ad, the RSUCI sends the message E(KSCO, M|| H(M)) to the 
RSUCO at the expiration of the ad.  
 
M = IDCO || IDCI || IDV || IDVA || AID || ADC || ADP || C/P  
RSUCI  RSTCO: E(KSCO, M|| H(M)) 
 
   After decrypting the message, verifying the sender, and 
validating the ad material introduced in M above, the County-
Level RSU checks that there are no multiple vehicle incentive 
requests by the same vehicle for the same ad among all the 
cities belonging to that county. 
 
VIII.  CITY-LEVEL RSU-TO-STREET-LEVEL RSU COMMUNICATION 
   The City-Level RSU, RSUCI, receives vehicles IDs and all 
anonymous vehicle IDs from the Street-Level RSU.   It also 
receives the needed ad information for incentive purposes.  
RSUCI sends the ad material to all Street-Level RSUs within 
the city. 
A. Vehicles ID Storing 
   Each RSUST send a list of real IDs and anonymous IDs for 
each vehicle passing through that street.  As mentioned in 
Section II, RSUs communicate using a shared session key.  
Therefore, the list of IDs and the hash code of the list is 
encrypted with the shared session key for Street-Level and 
City-Level RSUs (KSCI)  
 
M = IDST || IDCI || IDV || IDVA 
RSUST  RSTCI: E(KSCI, M|| H(M)) 
 
   The RSTCI updates its database to add all new IDVA issued 
for the vehicle during that period. 
 
B. Sending Ad Material 
   The RSTCI sends a message, M, composed of its ID, the 
Street-Level ID, AID, ADC, ADP, C/P, and AD.  The hash 
code of M is also attached. 
 
M = IDST || IDCI || AID || ADC || ADP || AD || H(AD) || C/P 
RSUCI  RSTST: E(KSCI, M|| H(M)) 
 
   The Street-Level RSU confirms the sender and the message 
integrity.  It then saves AID, ADC, ADP, C/P, and AD. 
 
C. Incentive Forwarding 
   The Street-Level RSU sends its RSUCI incentive messages 
for each participating vehicle: 
 
M = IDVA || IDST || AID || ADC || ADP || C/P 
RSUST  RSTCI: E(KSCI, M|| H(M)) 
 
   The City-Level RSU checks that there are no duplications 
for any ad’s incentives within its streets.  In other words, 
because RSUCI has the incentive information from all its 
streets, it makes sure no vehicle has sent multiple ADC for the 
same ad whether within the same street (driving through it 
more than once) or at various streets within the city.  At the 
end, each ad participating vehicle will have just one incentive 
for an ad.  Definitely, multiple incentives for different ads are 
acceptable. 
IX. STREET-LEVEL RSU-TO-VEHICLE COMMUNICATION 
   The Street-Level RSU, RSUST, receives the real ID of the 
vehicle, IDV, when entering its zone, and provides its public 
key, PUST, to that vehicle.  The RSUST uses a three-
measurement technique [6] to create an anonymous ID, IDVA, 
for the vehicle.  Each vehicle will create its own public and 
43

private keys (PUV, PRV), and forwards its public key to its 
RSUST.  
   RSUST creates a secret label, L, for each vehicle entering its 
zone.  It creates a random key, KL, and encrypts the ad ID 
(AID) and IDVA with it.   In other words, L = E(KL, AID || 
IDVA).  KL is not shared with the vehicle.  It will only be used 
once for each ad to control cheating.  Without this label, 
vehicles can cheat by sending the ADC to other vehicles 
within the street, or another street, possibly in another city. 
With the absence of such a label, vehicles receiving the ADC 
can submit the required details without reading/ watching the 
ad and to earn incentives.  L is encrypted with the public key 
of the vehicle and forwarded to it.  Vehicles requesting 
incentives should attach L to other incentive requirements.   
 
RSUST  V: E(PUV, L)  
 
   RSUST sends the ad materials to the vehicle.  It appends the 
ad ID (AID), IDVA, C/P, the ID of the Street-Level RSU, IDST, 
AD, and the hash code of the ad, H(AD) together to get the 
message X.  The hash function is used to ensure the integrity 
of the ad.  RSUST relies on broadcasting messages.  To 
achieve broadcasting, the RSUST selects a random key, Kr, to 
encrypt X.  It then encrypts Kr with the public key, PUV, of 
each vehicle.  Finally, the ID of the vehicle is attached to both 
encrypted messages and broadcasted to all vehicles in the 
zone. 
 
X = IDVA || AID || IDST || AD || H(AD) || C/P 
RSUST  V: IDVA || E(PUV, Kr) || (Kr, X) 
 
   Recognizing their IDs, vehicles will decrypt with their 
public key PUV first to get Kr, and then with Kr to get the 
message X.  The vehicle will verify the sender.  It then ensures 
the message is integral.  Later, the vehicle’s driver will decide 
if he/she is interested in the ad based on the value of C/P. To 
be eligible for incentives, the driver must watch the clip to the 
end, or read the text of the ad to the end in order to extract the 
ad code (ADC).  The ad code is the proof that will be used for 
providing incentives.  If the ad is followed to the end, the 
vehicle sends a message containing the ADC, AID, 
anonymous ID of the vehicle, ID of RSUST, and the label (L) 
all encrypted first with the vehicle’s private key and then with 
the public key of the RSUST. 
 
V  RSUST: E[PUST, E(PRV, AID || IDVA || IDST || ADC || L)] 
  
   After carrying out the decryptions and recognizing the 
sender, the RSUST verifies the received ADC matches the 
ADC of one of the ads, and ensures the AID in the message is 
the same as the AID of that ad.  Finally, it verifies the ad 
period (ADP), which was forwarded to it by the RSUCI to 
ensure the ad is still valid.  If there is any problem, the 
received message is ignored.  Finally, verification against 
cheating is carried out by decrypting L with KL and checking 
that AID and IDVA of the label match the received AID and 
IDVA.  If verification is positive, an acknowledgment (ACK) is 
sent to the vehicle.  The Keys, KL and Kr, will be discarded 
once the expiration date of the ad in question is reached. 
 
RSUST  V: E[PUV, E(PRST, AID || IDVA || IDST || ACK)] 
    
X. CONCLUSION 
   The advent of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) widely 
opened the door for various commercial applications.  An 
important application is the commercial ad broadcasting.  For 
such application to be successful and effective, dissemination 
of ad should be carried out in a secure manner to protect 
various communications.  Securing the ad dissemination 
without providing incentives will render the application 
ineffective as many drivers will just ignore the ads.   This 
paper introduced a secure architecture, which is implemented 
by a secure protocol to protect communications and 
incentives.   The protocol also prevented dishonest drivers, if 
any, from cheating. 
   This paper adopts coupon and points redemption for 
incentive purposes.  The management of incentives including 
selecting the incentive type and dealing with inappropriate 
behavior by vehicles is beyond the scope of this paper.  This is 
left to the states to decide as it involves legal, social, and 
accounting factors.
