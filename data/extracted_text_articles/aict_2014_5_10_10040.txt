Abstract–This paper proposes the novel broadband chaos and 
chirp based noncoherent amplitude shift keying (ASK) – on off 
keying (OOK) communication systems. Their theoretical 
probability of error expressions are derived and confirmed 
with the corresponding empirical bit error rate (BER) 
simulations 
demonstrating 
that 
they 
match 
the 
BER 
performance of the traditional narrowband system. The 
superiority of the newly proposed broadband systems over the 
traditional narrowband systems is then demonstrated in the 
presence of narrowband interference. This is a particularly 
important find as the traditional narrowband ASK–OOK 
systems are known to be highly susceptible to interference. 
Finally, it is demonstrated that the interference performance of 
the proposed chaos based system can be further improved by 
optimising chaos based signals for BER using the downhill 
simplex algorithm.

INTRODUCTION 
In chaotic communication systems a message signal 
directly modulates a broadband chaotic signal [1]-[3]. 
However, it is also possible to indirectly utilise a chaotic 
signal [4][5] to modulate a sinusoidal signal and thus create 
a constant envelope chaos based signal [5]. The chaos based 
signal may then be further modulated by a binary message 
signal to form a broadband amplitude shift keying (ASK) – 
on off keying (OOK) communication system as proposed in 
this paper. The ASK–OOK communication systems find use 
in radio frequency identification (RFID) devices as well as 
in medical applications such as endoscopy [6], among other. 
However, the traditional narrowband sine based ASK–OOK 
systems [7], where bits 0 are represented by no signal and 
bits 1 by a sinusoidal carrier, are highly sensitive to 
interference [6]. Therefore, the motivation for the use of the 
broadband chaos and chirp based carrier signals in place of 
a narrowband sinusoidal carrier signal within the ASK–
OOK systems stems from the fact that broadband signals are 
more resistant to interference than narrowband signals. 
In Section II, a novel broadband chaos based ASK–OOK 
system is proposed and its theoretical probability of error 
expression derived and confirmed by the corresponding 
empirical BER. Section III proposes the novel broadband 
chirp based ASK–OOK system and demonstrates its 
matching BER performance to that of the chaos based 
system and the traditional narrowband system. In Section 
IV, it is demonstrated that that the novel chaos based ASK–
OOK system offers increased resistance to the narrowband 
interference when compared to the traditional narrowband 
sine based carrier and the novel broadband chirp based 
carrier systems. Finally, Section IV also shows that the 
novel broadband chaos based system can be optimised to 
further improve its BER in the presence of narrowband 
interference. 
II. 
CHAOS BASED ASK-OOK SYSTEM 
The proposed broadband chaos based ASK–OOK 
communication system is shown in Fig. 1 where a binary 
signal m modulates a continuous chaos based signal. A 
systematic approach of generating continuous time signals 
by chaos generators was proposed in [4]. The concept was 
used in [5] to generate the sinusoidal chaos based signals for 
radar applications. A chaos based signal, similar to that of 
[5], is generated here for the application within the novel 
communication system by modulating the sinusoidal carrier 
of (1):

The bandpass filter of Fig. 1 filters out all but the 
frequencies surrounding the centre frequency of the received 
signal, 	 . Theoretically, the minimum bandwidth of the 
bandpass filter that can be implemented is equal to the bit 
rate 
 = (1/)  Hertz, where   denotes the bit period. 
Accordingly, the bandwidth of the chaos based, that is, the 
transmitted signal, must be kept within the system 
bandwidth 
. 
The total fixed number of samples within the chaos 
based carrier signal was chosen to be 100, that is, 100 
samples were chosen to represent any bit. The sample length 
of 100 was found to adequately represent a chaos based 
carrier signal of (1) and also yield a sufficiently low number 
of samples per bit what allowed for relatively fast Monte 
Carlo BER simulations. As it has not been established 
whether the signal s(t) of (1) is chaotic, it is referred to as a 
chaos based rather than a chaotic signal [5]. The chaotic 
map () of (1), used to modulate (1), was proposed by 
Carroll in [5]:

where p(i) are the system parameters. The largest Lyapunov 
exponent of () was determined to be 0.097 bits/iteration 
[5] thus proving that the proposed system of (3) is chaotic. 
For a system to be chaotic, its largest Lyapunov exponent 
must be greater than 0 [8]. 
For every chaotic sample of (3), there is a certain higher 
number of chaos based signal samples of (1) [5]. The 
number of chaos based signal samples per chaotic value is 
higher for higher chaotic signal values and lower for lower 
values. The reason for this can be observed by examining 
(1) from which it can be seen that higher () chaotic values 
produce lower frequency components and more samples per 
each sinusoidal cycle of the chaos based signal. Opposite is 
true for lower () chaotic values which produce higher 
frequency components and less samples per sinusoidal cycle 
of the chaos based signal. Therefore, in contrast to a linear 
frequency modulated (LFM) chirp signal [9] whose 
frequency changes linearly, frequency components of a 
chaos based signal change in a chaotic fashion. 
The empirical distributions of the decision variables of 
the newly proposed broadband chaos based ASK–OOK 
system of Fig. 1 are plotted in Fig. 2 at the bit energy to 
noise power spectral density (Eb/No) ratio of 10 dB, 
demonstrating the Rayleigh and Rician distribution of bits 0 
and 1, respectively. 
As the energy of a narrowband sinusoidal signal 
/ 2)
(
A2T
 [8][10] is independent of its frequency and only 
depends on its amplitude and signal duration, it can also be 
shown that the energy expression of the sinusoidal chaos 
based signal of (1) is governed by the same expression. To 
demonstrate this, (1) is first rewritten in the form of (4):

 [7]. Therefore, the chaos based signal energy is 
identical to that of a narrowband sinusoidal signal [7][10]. 
As the distribution of the decision variables and the 
energy of the chaos based signal match those of the 
traditional narrowband sine based ASK-OOK system [7] it 
is expected that the probability of error of the two systems 
will be identical. The probability of error () is obtained by 
considering the distribution of the decision variables 
sampled from the envelope at the input to the thresholding 
unit of Fig. 1. Accordingly, the probability of error that a bit 
1 is received when a bit 0 was transmitted is obtained by 
integrating the Rayleigh probability density function 
representing bits 0 for the values when the decision 
threshold  = /2 is exceeded:

expected, the result of (8) matches the result for the 
probability of error of the traditional narrowband ASK-OOK 
system whose theoretical probability of error expression was

final expression is somewhat inaccurate for high levels of

the more complex but exact result of (8) and the narrowband 
empirical BER. 
As opposed to indirectly using a chaotic signal to 
modulate the sinusoidal carrier within the chaos based 
ASK–OOK system, it is also possible to use a chaotic signal 
directly to represent a bit 1 and no signal to represent a bit 0. 
Such a system, termed chaotic on off keying (COOK), was 
proposed and investigated in [12]-[14]. However, unlike 
sinusoidal signals, chaotic signals generally do not have a 
constant envelope making a COOK system potentially more 
difficult and costly to implement.

CHIRP BASED ASK-OOK SYSTEM 
By replacing the chaos based carrier signal by an LFM 
chirp signal, a novel broadband ASK–OOK system is 
proposed here. Its novelty over the chirp based spread 
spectrum OOK system of [6] is in the envelope detector 
receiver architecture, which is simpler and more cost 
effective than the power detector architecture of [6] that was 
empirically investigated in the human body channel. The 
power detector architecture involves squaring and integration 
of the received signal, as opposed to the envelope detector 
architecture which simply samples the constant envelope, 
resulting in a lower implementation cost. As for the chaos 
based system, it was found here that the decision variables of 
the proposed system are also of Rayleigh and Rician 
distributions. Furthermore, as the energy of an LFM chirp 
signal is also equal to /2 [9], resulting in an average 
energy of a bit of 
/ 4

E = A T
, it is readily verifiable by 
repeating the derivation presented in (6) to (8) that the 
probability of error of the novel chirp based system is also 
governed by (8). The result is confirmed in Fig. 3a by an 
exact match between the empirical BER curve and the 
theoretical result of (8).  
IV. 
BER PERFORMANCE AND OPTIMISATION IN THE AWGN 
CHANNEL WITH NARROWBAND INTERFERENCE 
This section presents the BER performance of the 
narrowband sinusoidal and the two novel broadband 
systems when subjected to the sinusoidal narrowband 
interference. The novel chaos based system is then 
optimised to demonstrate a further improvement in the BER 
performance. 
A. BER performance of the ASK-OOK systems 
The BER results for the signal to interference ratios 
(SIR) of 20, 16, 12, 10, 8 and 6 dB are plotted in Fig. 4 from 
where it can be observed that although the narrowband and 
the proposed broadband ASK–OOK systems exhibit 
matching performance in the AWGN channel only, the 
broadband systems exhibit superior performance at all levels 
of interference.

The newly proposed broadband chirp based ASK–OOK 
system exhibits an increasing BER improvement over the 
narrowband system with the decreasing SIR. A further 
similar, 
but 
more 
notable, 
improvement 
over 
the 
narrowband sinusoidal and the broadband chirp based 
system is exhibited by the novel broadband chaos based 
system. For instance, at the SIR of 12 dB, and the BER level 
of 10'0, an improvement of approximately 0.5 and 0.75 dB 
can be observed in favour of the chaos based system when 
compared to the chirp and narrowband sinusoidal systems, 
respectively. The improvement increases to approximately 1 
and 1.5 dB at the SIR level of 8 dB. The bandwidth of the 
chirp carrier signal was kept the same as that of the chaos 
based carrier signal while the narrowband interference tone 
was kept near the centre frequency and within the system 
bandwidth 
. For the narrowband sinusoidal ASK–OOK 
system, the interference tone was generated at the carrier 
frequency.  
B. Optimisation of the novel chaos based ASK-OOK system 
In [5], chaos based signals were used for radar 
applications where broadband chaos based radar pulses were 
optimised for detection of specific targets. In contrast to an 
LFM chirp signal where only a single unique signal can be 
generated in a given bandwidth, a chaotic system can 
theoretically produce an infinite number of chaotic signals 
and therefore also chaos based signals by varying its 
parameters or initial conditions. By producing a large 
number of different chaos based signals, Carroll showed [5] 
that it is possible to find a particular chaos based signal that 
yields a high signal reflection from one arbitrary radar target 
and a low signal reflection from some other arbitrary radar 
target. This was achieved by optimising chaos based signals 
for a given radar target, or a set of targets, whose reflection 
characteristics are known in advance. The optimisation of 
the chaos based radar model was achieved by employing the 
downhill simplex or Nelder–Mead algorithm [15]. Downhill 
simplex algorithm determines the minimum of a given 
equation, termed minimisation equation. In case of the 
chaos based radar optimisation problem the minimisation 
equation of [5] was based on minimising the reflection of 
one radar target with respect to another. 
Taking the lead of [5], it is now demonstrated that the 
BER performance of the proposed chaos based ASK–OOK 
system of Section II can be further improved by optimising 
chaos based signals for a given level of narrowband 
interference. As opposed to minimising reflections from 
radar targets, the downhill simplex algorithm was used here 
to minimise the BER of the communication system. 
Optimisations were performed for each SIR level 
investigated at an Eb/No ratio corresponding to the BER 
level of 
4
10−  of a non optimised chaos based ASK–OOK 
system. Once an optimisation for a given SIR level was 
complete, the system was evaluated with the determined 
108

optimum chaos based carrier for a range of Eb/No ratios and 
the empirical BER curve obtained. The optimisations were 
started off with an initial random set of parameters that 
produce a non optimised chaotic signal of (3) and thus also a 
chaos based signal of (1). Upon evaluating the BER for the 
initial set of parameters, the downhill simplex algorithm 
varied the parameters and re-evaluated the BER. The 
process was repeated a large number of times until a 
smallest local minimum (optimum) BER value was 
determined. The optimisations were all nonlinear resulting 
in many local minima (as opposed to a definite global 
minimum), of which some had similar magnitudes. 
Nonetheless, the astringency of the algorithm may be 
improved by starting the algorithm execution with a 
favourable initial set of chaotic parameters. However, again, 
as the process is nonlinear, there is no rule on how to choose 
initial chaotic parameters that may enhance astringency. 
An advantage of the downhill simplex algorithm over 
some other optimisation algorithms is that it does not 
require derivatives [15] what reduces its complexity. Other 
algorithms may also be employed to try to further improve 
the BER performance [16][15]. However, this is beyond the 
scope of this paper and will not be investigated here. 
The optimised empirical BER curves for the varying SIR 
levels are plotted in Fig. 4 on the same set of axes as the non 
optimised curves. From the plots it can be observed that the 
improvement in BER performance of the optimised over 
non optimised chaos based ASK–OOK system ranges from 
less than 0.1 to approximately 0.5 dB at different SIR levels. 
Therefore, although the observed improvements are less 
significant than those of subsection IV-A, they further 
widen the improvement margin over the traditional 
narrowband system and demonstrate that the proposed chaos 
based ASK–OOK system’s BER performance can be further 
improved through an optimisation process. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, two novel broadband chaos and chirp based 
ASK–OOK communication systems were proposed. Their 
theoretical probability of error expression was derived and 
confirmed by an exact match with the corresponding 
empirical BER simulations. It was shown that both of the 
proposed novel broadband ASK–OOK systems exhibit 
superior BER performance to the narrowband system in the 
presence of narrowband interference, while also exhibiting a 
matching performance in the AWGN channel only. The 
novel chaos based system was shown to exhibit the best BER 
performance with interference in the system, providing an 
improvement of up to 1.5 dB. Such a find is of particular 
importance for the ASK–OOK systems, which are 
traditionally known to offer little resistance to interference. 
Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the newly proposed 
chaos based ASK–OOK system can be optimised using the 
downhill simplex algorithm to further improve its BER 
performance by up to 0.5 dB in the presence of narrowband 
tone interference.
