Abstract i- In this paper we propose and evaluate multicell 
coordinated beamforming schemes for the downlink of MISO-
OFDM systems. The precoders are designed in two phases: first 
the precoder vectors are computed in a distributed manner at 
each BS considering two criteria, namely distributed zero-forcing 
and virtual signal-to-interference noise ratio. Then the system is 
optimized through distributed power allocation under per-BS 
power constraint. The proposed power allocation scheme is 
designed based on minimization of the average bit error rate over 
all the available subcarriers. Both the precoder vectors and the 
power allocation are computed by assuming that the BSs have 
only knowledge of local channel state information and do not 
share the data symbols. The performance of the proposed 
schemes are evaluated, considering typical pedestrian scenarios 
based on LTE specifications. The results have shown that the 
proposed distributed power allocation scheme outperform the 
equal power allocation approach.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Multicell cooperation is one of the fastest growing areas 
of research, and it is a promising solution for cellular 
wireless 
systems 
to 
mitigate 
intercell 
interference, 
improving system fairness and increasing capacity in the 
years to come. This technology is already under study in 
LTE-Advanced under the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) 
concept.  
There are several CoMP approaches depending on the 
amount of information shared by the transmitters through 
the backhaul network and where the processing takes place, 
i.e., centralized if the processing takes place at the central 
unit (CU) or distributed if it takes at the different 
transmitters. 
Coordinated 
centralized 
beamforming 
approaches, where transmitters exchange both data and 
channel state information (CSI) for joint signal processing 
at the CU, promise larger spectral efficiency gains than 
distributed 
interference 
coordination 
techniques, 
but 
typically at the price of larger backhaul requirements and 
more severe synchronization requirements. Two centralized 
multicell precoding schemes based on the waterfilling 
technique have been proposed in [1]. It was shown that 
these techniques achieve a performance, in terms of 
weighted sum rate, very close to the optimal. In [2] a 
clustered BS coordination is enabled through a multicell 
block diagonalization (BD) strategy to mitigate the effects 
of interference in multicell MIMO systems. A new BD 
cooperative multicell scheme has been proposed in [3], to 
maximize the weighted sum-rate achievable for all the user 
terminals (UTs).  
Distributed precoding approaches, where the precoder 
vectors are computed at each BS in a distributed fashion, 
have been proposed in [4]. It is assumed that each base 
station has only the knowledge of local CSI and based on 
that a parameterization of the beamforming vectors used to 
achieve the outer boundary of the achievable rate region 
was derived. In [5], distributed precoding schemes based on 
zero-forcing criterion with several centralized power 
allocation based on minimization of the average BER and 
sum of inverse of signal-to-noise ratio (SNIR) have been 
derived. 
In the previous approaches, it was assumed that the 
transmitters (or BSs) share the entire data of all UTs. 
However, there are distributed beamforming approaches 
where the transmitters do not share the data, which fall into 
the interference channel (IC) framework. The local CSI, i.e. 
the CSI between a given BS and all UTs, is used by 
transmitters to design individual precoders to transmit 
exclusively to the users within their own cell [6], [7]. This 
approach, known as inter-cell interference nulling (ICIN), in 
which each BS transmits in the null-space of the 
interference it is causing to neighboring cells, has been 
discussed in the 3GPP long term evolution advanced (LTE-
A) literature. The authors of [8] proposed a non-iterative 
distributed solution to design precoding matrices for multi-
cell systems, which maximizes the sum-rates for only a two-
cell system at high SNR. In [9], a coordinated beamforming 
approach based on the virtual SINR framework, for a 
special case of two transmitters, has been proposed. 
The aim of this work is to propose and evaluate 
coordinated beamforming for the downlink of multicell 
MISO-OFDM systems. It is assumed that the BSs have only 
knowledge of local CSI and do not share the data symbols. 
The precoder is designed in two phases: first the precoder 
vectors are computed based on distributed zero-forcing 
(DZF), and distributed virtual signal-to-interference noise 
ratio (DVSINR). Then the system is further optimized by 
proposing a novel distributed power allocation algorithm, 
based on minimization of the average bit error rate (BER) 
over the available subcarriers. With the proposed strategy 
both the precoder vectors and the power allocation are 
computed at each BS in a distributed manner. The 
considered criterion for power allocation essentially lead to 
a redistribution of powers among subcarriers, and therefore

systems may be for the operators a goal as important as 
throughput maximization.  
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: 
section II presents the multicell MISO-OFDM system 
model. Section III briefly describes the considered 
distributed precoder vectors. In Section IV the novel 
distributed power allocation scheme is derived. Section V 
presents the main simulation results. The conclusions will 
be drawn in section VI.

III. DISTRIBUTED PRECODER VECTORS 
In this section we describe the distributed precoding 
vectors, namely DZF and DVSINR. To design the 
distributed precoder vector we assume that the BSs have 
only knowledge of local CSI and its own data symbols, i.e., 
BS b  knows the instantaneous channel vectors

 reducing the 
feedback load over the backhaul network as compared with 
the data and/or CSI sharing beamforming approaches.  
A. Distributed Zero Forcing (DZF) 
Zero forcing is considered a classic beamforming 
strategy which removes the co-terminal interference. We 
derive a distributed ZF transmission scheme with the phase 
of the received signal at each UT aligned. In this case,

B. Distributed Virtual SINR (DVSINR) 
Intuitively, the maximal ratio combining (MRT) is the 
asymptotically optimal strategy at low SNR, while ZF has 
good performance at high SNR or as the number of 
antennas increase. As discussed in [4][9], the optimal 
strategy lies in between these two precoders and cannot be 
determined without global CSI. However, inspired by the 
uplink-downlink duality for broadcast channels, the authors 
of [4] have derived a novel distributed virtual SINR 
precoder. The precoder vectors are achieved by maximizing 
the SINR-like expression in (9) where the signal power that 
BS b generates at UT b  is balanced against the noise and 
interference power generated at all other UTs. It was named 
DVSINR as it originates from the dual virtual uplink and 
does not directly represent the SINR of any of the links in 
the downlink.

IV. POWER ALLOCATION STRATEGY 
In this section we design a novel distributed power 
allocation algorithm, based on minimization of the average 
BER over the available subcarriers. The criteria used to 
design distributed power allocation essentially lead to a 
redistribution of powers among subcarriers. To derive the 
power allocation for both precoders, we assume that the 
interference is negligible at both low and high SNR, even 
for the VSINR precoder. 
The above precoders were specifically designed to make 
the equivalent channels, given by

respectively.  
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, the performance of the coordinated 
beamforming approaches with the proposed distributed 
power allocation scheme will be illustrated numerically. 
The scenario consists of 4 uniformly distributed single 
antenna UTs in a square with BSs in each of the corners. 
The power decay is proportional to 
4
1/ r , where r  is the 
distance from a transmitter. We define the SNR at the cell 
edge as
2
SNR
P
/
bt
c
Nc
=
ρ
σ , where the 
c
ρ  represents the 
long term channel power in the center of the square. This 
represents a scenario where terminals are moving around in 
the area covered by 4 base stations.  
The main parameters used in the simulations are based 
on LTE standard [14]: FFT size of 1024; number of 
available subcarriers set to 128; sampling frequency set to 
15.36 MHz; useful symbol duration is 66.6 µs, cyclic prefix 
duration is 5.21 µs; overall OFDM symbol duration is 71.86 
µs; sub-carrier separation is 15 kHz, and modulation is 
QPSK. We used the ITU pedestrian channel model B, with 
the modified taps delays according to the sampling 
frequency defined by LTE standard. 
We compare the performance results of the proposed 
distributed power allocation schemes, DZF MBER PA and 
DVSINR MBER PA. Also, these schemes are compared 
with equal power allocation approach, i.e., the power 
available at each BS is equally divided by the subcarriers,

, referred as DZF EPA and DVSINR 
EPA for DZF and VSINR, respectively. The results are 
presented in terms of the average BER as a function of Cell-
edge SNR defined above. 
From Fig. 2, we can see that the performance of the 
proposed distributed power allocation scheme, for the two 
precoders, outperforms their equal power i.e. the DZF EPA 
and DVSINR EPA approaches. This is because they 
redistribute the powers across the different subchannels 
more efficiently. As can be seen in this figure, the gains of 
the proposed power allocation schemes, DZF MBER PA 
and DVSINR MBER PA) against the equal power 
approaches are approximately, 8 and 6 dB (at target BER of 
10-3), respectively. Also, we can observe that the 
performance of the DZF MBER PA tends to the DVSINR 
MBER one as the SNR increases.  
Fig. 3 shows the performance results when one more 
antenna is added to each BS. In this scenario the DoF of the 
equivalent channels variables, given by

increasing the DoF, the DZF tends to the DVSINR. This 
behaviour is similar to the single cell systems where the 
precoders based on ZF criterion tends to the ones based on 
MMSE as the number of transmit antennas (or DoF) 
increases or at high SNR. From the results we can see that 
the gains obtained with power allocation schemes are lower, 
as compared with equal power approaches, than in the 
previous scenario. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
We proposed a novel distributed power allocation 
scheme for distributed precoding schemes, namely DZF and 
DVSINR, and for the downlink MISO-OFDM based 
systems. Both the precoders and power allocation were 
computed at each base station just by assuming the 
knowledge of local CSI without data sharing. 
The results have shown that the proposed distributed 
power allocation schemes outperform the equal power ones. 
Also, the performance of the DZF based approaches tend to 
the DVSINR ones when the number of DoF increases or at 
high SNR.  
It is clear from the presented results that the proposed 
distributed precoding schemes present significant interest 
for next generation wireless networks for which cooperation 
between BSs is anticipated.
