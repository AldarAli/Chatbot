Abstract‚ÄîRespiratory belt is a full-service home medical 
equipment to monitor respiration for homecare. Respiratory 
belt indicates breathing strength and characterizes breathing 
patterns. This paper describes a noninvasive respiratory 
movement monitoring using Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) and respiratory belt simultaneously to investigate 
internal-external 
correlation. 
Twenty 
healthy 
subjects 
participated in this study and they all performed paced 
breathing 
(12 
cycles/minute) 
during 
experiment. 
The 
diaphragmatic movement area and the anterior-posterior (AP) 
diameter of the body contour were represented as indexes of 
internal respiratory movement. The respiratory belt signal was 
represented as the external index. Cross correlation was used 
to evaluate the similarity between internal and external 
respiratory 
movement. 
The 
results 
indicated 
that 
diaphragmatic movement area versus respiratory belt signal 
performed strong negative correlation (R value is -0.847¬±0.06). 
The AP diameter of the body contour versus respiratory belt 
performed strong positive correlation (R value is 0.837¬±0.09). 
In conclusion, respiratory belt correlates strongly with 
diaphragmatic movement area and AP diameter of the body 
contour. Therefore, respiratory belt is a reliable external 
respiratory monitoring technique to detect respiratory 
movement in homecare.

 INTRODUCTION 
The measurement of lung function is predominantly 
based on conventional spirometry that measures the lung 
volume at the corresponding flow. Such measurement 
provides an averaged performance of the lungs at a point. 
There is no information that reflects the contributions from 
various regions of the lungs [1]. Therefore, a non-invasive 
method for recording lung function that primarily relies on 
cross sectional area of both thorax and abdomen called 
respiratory belt. Respiratory failure is too difficult to predict. 
Continuous 
monitoring 
of 
respiratory 
activity 
and 
appropriate monitoring equipment could be life-saving. 
Therefore, respiratory belt is a full-service home medical 
equipment to monitor respiration for homecare [2]. With 
such a device, the changes in the volumes of the 
thoracoabdominal compartments respectively 
measures 
anterior-posterior and lateral diameter changes of different 
conditions. It can provide respiratory volume, respiratory 
rate and pulmonary ventilation [3]. 
Applications of respiratory belt are the most widely used 
technique and play an essential role in clinic. For examples, 
respiratory belt measures the variation of thoracic or 
abdominal circumference during respiration which indicated 
breathing strength and characterized breathing patterns. 
Synchrony of the breathing pattern has promised to evaluate 
chest wall movement and stability in preterm infants [4]. 
Thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony 
during 
upper 
airway 
obstruction in small children can be documented by phase 
angle analysis of the Lissajous figure from the output of a 
respiratory inductance plethysmography as respiratory belt 
[5]. In gated radiotherapy, the accuracy of respiratory-gated 
treatments based on external body monitoring usually relies 
upon the assumption of a strong correlation between the 
external motion and internal respiratory motion [6]. However, 
there are several studies to verify the time series correlation 
of internal and external movement by Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI). 
MRI is a feasible technique to investigate the anatomy 
and physiology of the body, especially diaphragmatic 
movement. The technique is widely used in hospitals for 
medical diagnosis, staging of cancers and for follow-up 
without exposure to ionizing radiation. 
Cross correlation is commonly used for measuring the 
similarity of two waveforms [7]. Therefore, this study used

cross correlation to analyze the interaction between internal 
and external respiratory movement. The diaphragmatic 
movement area represents the respiratory movement. The AP 
diameter of the body contour represents the internal index. 
The respiratory waveform measured by respiratory belt 
represents the external index.

METHODS 
A. Subjects and data collection 
Twenty healthy subjects (10 males and 10 females; age: 
23¬±1.8; height: 167¬±9.3 cm; weight: 60¬±11.45 kg) 
participated in this study and they all performed paced 
breathing (12 cycles/minute) during experiment. All subjects 
followed the instruction during breathing for 2 minutes in 
MRI exam room (Figure 1).  
The diaphragmatic movement represented the internal 
respiratory index. And the images were projected in the 
sagittal plane with the subject in the supine position. The 
projection plane was placed sagittally in the coronal scout 
view directed through on the right side, midway through the 
most highest of the right diaphragm. All imaging 
experiments were performed on a Siemens 1.5-T Magnetom 
Sonata scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, 
Germany) with a two-channel body array coil. No 
intravenous contrast medium was administrated.  We have 
used Fast Low Angle Shot pulse sequence to acquire MRI 
images configured as follows: TR= 2.18 ms, TE= 0.74 ms, 
slice thickness=10 mm, field of view= 400 mm. The length 
of each trial recorded sequence was 129 s. During this time, 
512 images were recorded at regular intervals; one image 
was acquired every 0.252 s.  
The 
respiratory 
belt 
(Siemens 
‚ÄúPhysiological 
Measurements Unit‚Äù) located on xiphoid was used to 
measure the external respiratory movement. This study was 
approved by institutional review board of National Chiao 
Tung University and Chung Shan Medical University 
Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all 
participants before the experiment.

showed the following instruction. 
B. Imaging and signal processing 
The MRI image files were converted to analyze format 
with DicomWork 1.3.5 software. The imaging processing 
programs in this study were developed by using commercial 
software platform (LabVIEW version 2013, National 
Instruments Corp., Austin, USA). The experimental analysis 
was assessed under the following. 
1) Diaphragmatic movement area 
The diaphragmatic area movement is an internal 
respiratory movement.  The images analysis contains several 
steps as follows. First, the boundaries of the diaphragm are 
extracted from edge detection algorithm [8]. Edge detection 
is aimed to identify points in the MRI image, where the 
image brightness changes sharply. Green color is diaphragm 
which is extracted from edge detection (Figure 2). Secondly, 
it demonstrates the ‚Äúcresent‚Äù shaped image of diaphragm 
area during paced breathing cycle and converts to the 
waveform. The calculated area method is maximum 
inspiratory volume as a reference to calculate the ups and 
downs area of diaphragmatic movement. 
2) AP diameter of the body contour located on xiphoid  
Drawing the horizontal line at the location of respiratory 
belt as a reference recorded AP diameter of the body 
contour in sagittal MRI image. The AP diameter of the body 
contour represents the internal respiratory movement 
(Figure 3). The anterior-posterior boundary is extracted 
from edge detection algorithm. Then, it measures the 
diameter of the boundary. 
3) Respiratory belt signal 
The respiratory belt was used to measure the external 
respiratory movement (Figure 4).

is that it outlines AP diameter of the body contour changes at

C. Cross correlation function 
Cross correlation function is commonly used for 
measuring the similarity of two waveforms as a function of 
a time-shift applied to one of them. The process of 
calculation opened a fixed window size about one breathing 
cycle then calculated the quantity R, called correlation 
coefficient with time shift point by point. The mathematical 
formula for R is:

RESULTS 
Cross correlation is commonly used for measuring the 
internal-external correlation. The results of cross correlation 
were illustrated in one of the participants as an example 
(Figure 5,6,7) and the statistical results of 20 subjects are 
summarized in Table I. Diaphragmatic movement area 
versus AP diameter of the body contour performed strong 
negative correlation (R value is -0.908¬±0.09) after time shift 
zero. Diaphragmatic movement area versus respiratory belt 
signal performed strong negative correlation (R value is -
0.847¬±0.06). Diaphragmatic movement itself versus AP 
diameter of the body contour and respiratory belt is opposite 
direction during breathing. AP diameter of the body contour 
versus respiratory belt performed strong positive correlation 
(R value is 0.837¬±0.09).

DISCUSSION 
Cross correlation is commonly method for quantifying 
the internal-external correlation. This research verified the 
correlation of organ movement (internal index) and 
respiratory belt signal (external index) in the sagittal MRI 
images. There are two indexes from MRI images. One is the 
internal diaphragm represented soft tissue and the other is 
external body contour represented rigid structure. Therefore, 
diaphragmatic movement area versus AP diameter of the 
body contour performed strong negative correlation but no 
time shift. However, respiratory belt is another respiratory 
reference to discuss. Cross correlation about respiratory belt 
performed strong positive correlation but had several time 
shifts. The result showed that there is time difference 
between internal and external. Vedam et al. [9] measured the 
correlation between the respiratory signal and the superior-
inferior location of the diaphragm. Results from statistical 
analysis indicated a strong linear relationship between the 
respiratory signal and diaphragm motion (p < 0.001) but this 
only gave one dimensional internal information.  Ionascu et 
al. [6] studied the internal-external correlation investigation 
of respiratory induced motion of lung cancers. The results 
showed that internal-external correlation along the anterior-
posterior with values larger than 0.97 was better than along 
superior-posterior with values in the range 0.77-0.88. 
In other studies of quantifying the internal-external 
correlation, they have been tried to get the internal 
information by fluoroscopy, sonography or other imaging 
techniques for synchronization. Gierga et al. [10] showed 
that the information of internal organs by fluoroscopy and 
the correlation of the respiratory motion of external patient 
markers as body contour are important for image-guided 
therapy techniques, such as respiratory gating, that monitor 
the movement of external fiducials. However, fluoroscopy 
which uses X rays to obtain real-time overlapping flat plane. 
The limitation of fluoroscopy is on spatial orientation. 
Sawada et al. [11] carried out that using a moving-target

phantom simulated a patient respiratory movement and 
observing the variation of the calculated real-time 
correlation index synchronizes with the periodical motion of 
the moving-target. Though sonography is able to obtain the 
good time resolution, it is unable to set the same anatomy 
landmark on free hand mode. The research is a precise 
verification for analyzing the correlation of internal-external 
on fixed landmark by MRI images. It is hoped to investigate 
the correlation of internal-external information during 
breathing patterns such as thoracic breathing or abdominal 
breathing further. However, MRI has been limited in 
acquisition speed, so the pulse sequence of good time 
resolution is to be considered for the future.  
The physiology or imaging monitoring is often used 
respiratory belt as recording the external information. Ya-
Chen et al. [12] acquired the respiratory movement with 
four respiratory effort transducers based on using ensemble 
empirical mode decomposition for breathing patterns 
recognition. A 
long-term 
monitoring 
of respiration 
particularly becomes suitable for homecare application for 
chronic pulmonary diseases [13]. Respiratory belt helps a 
person who has obstructive sleep apnea breathe to monitor 
respiration. Therefore, respiratory monitoring is essential for 
health assessment. 
The location of respiratory belt is an important impact 
on the changing of the external information. For example, 
the displacement changes largely, which respiratory belt tied 
on abdomen during abdominal breathing. It is obvious 
changing of the belt as xiphoid during thoracic breathing. 
Therefore, the aim of our research is to investigate the 
correlation of different breathing types such as thoracic 
breathing or abdominal breathing in future work. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Based on cross correlation, this study attempts to verify 
that diaphragmatic movement versus signal of respiratory 
belt assumes a better similarity on correlation coefficient 
and can be a reliable non-invasive respiratory monitoring 
system to detect internal respiratory movement. Therefore, 
respiratory belt can be a home medical equipment to 
monitor respiration for homecare.
