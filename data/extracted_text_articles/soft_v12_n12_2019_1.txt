Abstract—This paper presents the research results from an
extended case study and implementation for the identiﬁcation
and spatial mapping of arbitrary non-georeferenced input data
entities. The implemented components and methods are based
on the methodology of knowledge mapping. The methodology
enables to implement and realise methods for the creation of
new context for objects and entities, e.g., creating support for the
tasks of knowledge mining and decision making. The focus of
the methodology is the mapping of knowledge and its facilities of
creating substantially different practical method implementations
for identical input objects while aiming on comparable tasks.
The main goal of these case studies and implementations is to
demonstrate how to create two different automatable methods
for knowledge mapping to be applied on each input object,
based on a functional architecture of sustainable long-term multi-
disciplinary knowledge resources and components, which provide
support for a wide range of ﬂexibility for knowledge mapping and
different computational solutions. The implementation cases are
based on automated computational cases of spatial visualisation.
In addition, the results from any of these realisations are used
to further valorise new knowledge and continuously improve the
contributing long-term knowledge resources.

INTRODUCTION
Knowledge Mining and decision making are facilities, which
are required for a large number of application scenarios but
which are, nevertheless, in practice widely based on plain
methods of data mining only.
This extended research is based on the results from the
collaborations on computation and Knowledge Mapping for
data entities, which was presented at the INFOCOMP 2018
conference in Barcelona, Spain [1]. The methodology goes
beyond creation of plain methods and the practically very
limited view of ‘data’, which is commonly used. The pa-
per illuminates the view of the Principles of Superordinate
Knowledge [2], which is not restricted to a plain data view
but focusses on advanced knowledge based context creation
for arbitrary knowledge. The principles are general, compared
to simpler approaches. Therefore, the principles should not be
intermixed with ‘data’ based mining approaches.
There are no other, comparable realisations known so
far, which use standardised, universal conceptual knowledge
frameworks for creating context, e.g., spatial context.
This paper presents context-methods for multi-dimensional
context creation based on the new methodology of Knowl-
edge Mapping. The methodology allows to create knowl-
edge mapping and new context for arbitrary objects, based
on knowledge, e.g., conceptual knowledge. The results are
methods based on an architecture allowing advanced knowl-
edge mapping, including ﬂexible deployment of computational
sequences and an implementation of resources and application
components.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II introduces
to the motivation, state-of-the-art, and the base of the new ap-
proach. Section III presents the architecture, frame of universal
knowledge, target input and associated universal knowledge.
Section IV presents an exemplary approach, with the details of
two well comparable but different case study implementations
and all essential components. Section V discusses the results
of the case studies, evaluates them based on the conceptual
knowledge, computational sequences, and architectures and
delivers a computational footprint in context with referred
knowledge. Section VI summarises the results and lessons
learned, conclusions, and future work.
II.
MOTIVATION AND APPROACH
Resources of knowledge are steadily increasing in number
and size and so is the complexity and heterogeneity of the
associated knowledge. In most cases, it is not possible to
ﬁnd satisfying results even though the basis of data is rapidly
growing. New approaches are needed in order to ﬁnd answers
to challenging knowledge mining requests.
Concepts used in the past mostly provided non consistent
and insufﬁcient approaches when dealing with the complex-
ity of knowledge. In most cases, those concepts basically
consider dealing with ‘data’ and claim to result in ‘knowl-
edge’ or even ‘wisdom’ of some kind [3]. For example,
the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) approach
widely used in Data Mining (DM) lacks an understanding of
data being only one aspect of knowledge [4].
Implementations are mostly neglecting the knowledge asso-
ciated with originary resources and referred knowledge and
therefore deal with the applications and isolated technical
features, which are neither able to be integrated for improving
results and resources nor can they provide reasonable freedom
of solutions.

Concepts like DIKW are lacking a profound relation of data
and information [5]. Terms like “knowledge hierarchy” and
“information hierarchy” are more misleading than constructive,
especially when we have to deal with complex and long-term
resources. Approaches used with data warehousing [6] on that
basis, e.g., Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and Extract, Load,
Transform (ELT) for integrating data newly also resulted in
requiring hybrid approaches but have not been based on a
profound understanding of knowledge.
It should be explicitly stated, as commonly not sufﬁciently
understood: The knowledge based concept is superior to a
plain, data based concept. Mining and management based on
the data concept is by far insufﬁcient due to its most limited
analysis approaches where accuracy is restricted to attributed
data, e.g., simple data mining procedures and character string
comparisons.
The described deﬁcits are a major motivation for the long-
term research presented in this paper. The fundaments of
terminology and of understanding knowledge are layed out
by Aristotle [7][8], being an essential part of ‘Ethics’ [9].
Information sciences can very much beneﬁt from Aristotle’s
fundaments and a knowledge-centric approach [10] but for
building holistic and sustainable solutions they need to go
beyond the available technology-based approaches and hypoth-
esis [11] as analysed in Platons’ Phaidon.
Making a distinction and creating interfaces between meth-
ods and applications [12], the principles are based on the
methodology of knowledge mapping [13], which fundaments
are not outlined here again. The implementation can make use
of objects and conceptual knowledge [14] and shows being
able to build a base for applications scenarios like associative
processing [15] and advanced knowledge discovery [16].
Considering this state-of-the-art, the methodology deployed
in this research and the accompanying implementation of
methods consequently focusses on the complex knowledge
basis, which allows to integrate the different aspects of knowl-
edge and the complexity of knowledge context. In result,
the methodology allows to create methods focussing on al-
ternative contexts based on a wide range of criteria and
solutions provided by knowledge context. Implementations are
considered knowledge-centric, with data being one comple-
mentary facet of knowledge. Therefore, the methodology and,
in consequence, the method implementations based on this
methodology, are vastly scalable. Scalability support ranges
from ﬁxed associations to arbitrarily fuzzy understanding.
III.
ARCHITECTURE AND UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE
An understanding of the essence and complexity of uni-
versal, multi-disciplinary knowledge can be achieved by tak-
ing a closer look on classiﬁcation. The state-of-the-art of
classifying ‘universal knowledge’ is the Universal Decimal
Classiﬁcation (UDC) and its solid background and long history.
The LX knowledge resources’ structure and the classiﬁcation
references [17] based on UDC [18] are essential means for
the processing workﬂows and evaluation of the knowledge
objects and containers. Both components provide strong multi-
disciplinary and multi-lingual support.
For this part of the research, all small unsorted excerpts of
the knowledge resources objects only refer to main UDC-based
classes, which for this publication are taken from the Multilin-
gual Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation Summary (UDCC Pub-
lication No. 088) [19] released by the UDC Consortium under
the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 3.0 license [20]
(ﬁrst release 2009, subsequent update 2012). Nevertheless, the
research conducted here in deploying knowledge provides a
new solution not precedented by comparable approaches, from
the view of methodology and implemented methods.

environments, allowing different methods (yellow/red) for implementations.
The illustration of the architecture for knowledge mapping
of arbitrary objects and entities to new object context environ-
ments also takes into account that the context of objects and
their entities can contain many different facets and references
from different origin.
The target for the case studies is a knowledge mapping
providing two different mapping views. The spatial visualisa-
tion is an illustrative step, providing insights on new context.

Data and modules are provided by Knowledge Resources,
originary resources, and application resources and components.
The architecture is also aware of allowing different methods
(e.g., highlighted in yellow/red) for implementations regarding
the same resources and target.
The core of the knowledge mapping in this case consists
of comparative mapping, conceptual mapping, and spatial
mapping. All the examples in the case studies are based on
the methodology of knowledge mapping [13]. The integration
of originary sources provides a generic view for terms like
‘knowledge integration’ and ‘knowledge representation’ as
such might be used in less generic approaches.
Here, in the mapping and the consecutive steps (here, a
visualisation for illustration purposes), we do have the major
differences of different methods for implementing alternative
ways for the same resources and target.
The following case studies, all from real productive imple-
mentations, demonstrate the different characteristics of imple-
mentations based on the same universal knowledge. From a
multitude of application scenarios, a term to location associa-
tion providing ways of knowledge mapping of textual context
to space and place were choosen for case studies.
B. Target Data and Universal Knowledge
The next passages show some major steps for creating
spatially linked context from plain text, which were used in
the workﬂows required for the cases.
For demonstration, a publicly available central target object
was used for input to both implemented methods realised in
this paper and for data entity analysis.

The sample object is the publicly available committees’ page of
the Tenth International Conference on Advanced Geographic
Information Systems, Applications, and Services (GEOPro-
cessing 2018), in Rome [21].
Large passages of text not relevant for demonstration of the
principles were reduced to ellipses. The spatial visualisation
can result from identifying and mapping entities in the text of
an object to various knowledge context. The identiﬁcation of
entities is resulting from automated analysis.

Figure 3. Object instance representation after integration into knowledge
resources, containing source references and locations (excerpt).
The Object Entity Mapping facilitates to associate relevant ob-
jects, e.g., via conceptual knowledge and comparative methods.
The objects and their entities can contain any knowledge,
e.g., factual and conceptual knowledge. In this case, dealing
with space and place data, the references, e.g., referred con-
ceptual knowledge, carried in objects are most relevant.
The complement knowledge used with the mapping con-
tains multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual knowledge, it can
contain names, places, and synonyms in different languages
as well as extensive context references, dynamically usable
geo-coordinates, geo-classiﬁcation, and so on. The comple-
ment knowledge is continuously improved and extended by
manual means, integration of resources as well as by training
procedures.
3) UDC: Place and Space: Tables I, II, and III show
example excerpts of relevant main classiﬁcation codes and
details of the UDC references used for conceptual mapping.
For conceptual knowledge of place and spatial context the
implementations requires to provide references to classiﬁcation
codes. The UDC provides references based on the common
auxiliaries of place of the UDC [22] as excerpted here for
facets of place and space, physiographic designation, and
places from ancient to modern world.

The references, e.g., classiﬁcation, facets, concordances, and
textual description, are usable in all the procedures and steps
and allow to consider and implement arbitrary ﬂexibility of
fuzziness. Entry points to relevant and associated knowledge
may be in any disciplinary context due to the consistent
framework of the UDC and the multi-disciplinary and multi-
lingual Knowledge Resources. During the research, two com-
putational sequences were implemented for illustration of such
procedures. These sequences show different characteristics in
content and context, as well as different characteristics in
architecture and computational requirements.

IMPLEMENTATION: MULTIPLE WAYS TO SPACE
The following case studies present two different methods for
implementing object/entity knowledge mapping to space and
place targets and discuss major insights. Computational knowl-
edge mapping procedures are presented for both methods, as
well as the visualisation of the results. The computational
application components are part of the available resources.
The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) [23] suite application
components were used for handling the spatial data, applying
related criteria, and for the visualisation. All provided spatial
presentations in the following examples are using the same
Mercator projection (region: -180/180/-60/84) in order to
provide a common base for the comparison.
A. Space and place: Afﬁliation based knowledge mapping
This method implements the knowledge mapping based
on afﬁliations. The implementation is done according to the
implementation architecture (Figure 1).

tional sequence of the core computational procedures.

In practice, the number of such place references can be very
large. In case of this study, the numbers are in the range of
millions of places. Therefore, it is important to understand
what the tasks of the modules are.
2) Module tasks:
•
The ﬁrst module creates possible entities, including a
recoder for alternative re-coding of codepages, a correc-
tor generating attempts for corrections of writing, and
a comparator computing comparisons with known and
available afﬁliation space and place in the resources and
references, here on base of afﬁliations and distinctive
locations.
•
The second module identiﬁes the resulting entities based
on the ﬁt, according to the conceptual knowledge rel-
evant for the targeted knowledge mapping, here geo-
spatial association and referencing.
•
The third module creates the spatial mapping and visu-
alisation, depending on the choosen base.
With all modules, functional code is generated for the respec-
tive steps. The generation ensures that appropriate implemen-
tations can be achieved depending on the computing resources
and infrastructures, which are used for the computational tasks.
This is important, especially for large numbers of target data
sets because many millions of comparisons may be required
for each step and, e.g., the computation be parallelised appro-
priately.
3) Output representation: The visualisation of the results
(red bullets) from the afﬁliation based procedures was done
on a spatial map (Figure 5).

The computing task can be parallelised for objects and
entities. For demanding application scenarios, e.g., dynami-
cal implementations, this implementation beneﬁts to a small
extend from parallelisation.
B. Space and place: Country code based knowledge mapping
This method implements the knowledge mapping based on
country codes. The implementation is done according to the
implementation architecture (Figure 1).

tional sequence of the core computational procedures.
That means, regarding space and place: Country mapping,

ation of country codes and visualisation.

•
The ﬁrst module creates possible entities, including a

The third module creates the spatial mapping and visu-

Here, too, with all modules, functional code is generated for
the respective steps. The generation ensures that appropriate

target data sets because many millions of comparisons may be
required for each step and, e.g., the computation be parallelised
appropriately.

The computing task can be parallelised for objects and
entities. For demanding application scenarios, e.g., dynamical
implementations, this implementation widely beneﬁts from
parallelisation. The parallelisation will be an individual task
of implementing a parallelisation concept optimal for the
resources, on precondition that the computational resources
and architectures are known in detail and available.
C. Visualisation
The spatial visualisation for the presented implementations
is done according to the implementation architecture (Fig-
ure 1).

visualisation of both methods implemented for afﬁliation based
knowledge mapping and country code based knowledge map-
ping.

DISCUSSION
Implementations can range from generic to specialised, as
granted by the methodology, all the components and the illus-
trated architecture. A reason for illustrating the methodology
with a well deﬁned implementation is that from many expe-
riences made from working with methodologies, specialised
implementations tend to be better comprehensible by the
majority of researchers in various disciplines.
The methodology of knowledge mapping, as illustrated
via implementation of two methods discussed here, allows
a versatile number of methods to be created for a purpose,
based the same knowledge and data.
A. Comparison and discussion of results
The two sequences show different characteristics
•
in content and context, as well as
•
in architecture and computational requirements.
Country code based and afﬁliation based solutions result
in visualisation of different distribution patterns. While an
afﬁliation based solution can have a higher granularity it can
be more precise in detail. In that context, a country code based
solution is associated with more dependencies in the results –
border lines, different country context, especially for handling
and visualising long-term intervals. For example, considering
the same data, on the one hand geo-references of a place do
not really change much over time, on the other hand border
lines of states change much faster on a global scale.
For a visual comparison, the results from both the afﬁliation
based and country code based sequences were placed on the
same spatial map (Figure 12).
Figure 12. Comparison of both afﬁliation and country code based knowledge
mapping: Geo-referenced place and ISO referenced state results.
There are more differences in detail, which can inﬂuence
decisions on applicability and implementation. In general,
there are arbitrary ways of implementing a knowledge mapping
target based on the same Knowledge Resources. An imple-
mentation will in most cases be triggered by a combination
of items, e.g., purpose, implementation efﬁciency, and com-
putational performance. The characteristics and resolvability
achieved via different knowledge mapping may be different.

The number of countries is much more limited and the identiﬁ-
cation can be much more standardised than for geo-referenced
places. The distribution of afﬁliation associated places can
create a different impression than a visualisation based on
country data. The sizes of mapped country areas can create
a different impression than a visualisation based on country
data. Associations based on both results can be signiﬁcantly
different, leading to further different knowledge context.
A further signiﬁcant difference of the two case study
implementations
is
the
fact
that
the
computational
requirements are much more complex for afﬁliation mapping
than for country code mapping. Depending on the objects and
entities and the selected knowledge resources the factor of
complexity can go up by millions. This is foremost relevant
for the computation of comparative modules and analysis and
visualisation of results.
B. Knowledge and its computational footprint
Based on the case studies, the characteristics of both solu-
tions result in different computational requirements. Table VII
compares the solutions regarding the numbers of computa-
tional checks required, done for the same object and entities.

Different implementations involve different knowledge. As
can be reasoned from the comparison, the case of afﬁliation
based knowledge mapping might be a challenge for certain
architectures, e.g., a distributed service implementation.
On the opposite, country code mapping can mean higher
requirements for supportive data and higher load on spatial
mapping application components, e.g., polygons provided by
additional data, requests, application bound features, and vi-
sualisation. The supportive data can easily get into the range
of millions of entities and Giga Bytes of data size per single
request. If considering that country shapes will differ for a
certain year or era, then multiple supportive data sets might
be needed. Therefore, load distribution is very much different
for the implementations due to the nature of the different
methodologies. The core sequences required for the knowledge
mapping result in signiﬁcant computational loads, especially at
two steps: Comparisons and visualisation. These result in both
comparative mapping load and supportive application load.
Conﬁguration of resources and modules can help to scale the
computational load, nevertheless, any different conﬁgurations
will have additional impact on the associated knowledge
involved, which can be a signiﬁcant reason for decision:
For most component implementations and investments it does
make a difference if a computational step takes two seconds or
two days and if the required knowledge and data are involved
or not. In addition to different knowledge being associated
during the sequences, there is another difference: Most of
the procedures are not bidirectional. If the afﬁliation based
knowledge mapping is used in order to compute a consecutive
country code based knowledge mapping and even if the result
would be identical to the plain country code mapping this does
not indicate that the country code mapping could also provide
a consecutive afﬁliation mapping in the same manner.
C. Re-use, continuous creation, and improvement
Access and interface modules, especially for accessing struc-
tures, dealing with formatting, and handling of sorting and
ﬁltering can easily be reused or cloned with modiﬁcations.
Visualisation modules can also be easily reused and adopted
for different methods of knowledge mapping.
The modules characteristic for a respective knowledge map-
ping method make up the core for a case. Different algorithms
should be implemented in modular ways, e.g., allowing stan-
dalone of algorithms as well as an integrated use of algorithms.
Nevertheless, on premise of sufﬁcient complexity of the knowl-
edge resources, even all the knowledge required with different
knowledge mapping methods can overall be delivered by the
knowledge resources. The delivered knowledge can comprise
the knowledge complements, e.g., including supportive knowl-
edge for methods, references, algorithms, implementations of
algorithms, and visualisation components.
With natural language target data or comparable sources a
lot of processing may have to be done before getting into the
knowledge mapping itself. For example, codepages have to be
resolved and codepages have to be recoded, languages may
have to be recognised by document, sentence, and even word
and different ways of writing the same object may have to
be resolved. Incomplete object references may be associated
with full entries and so on. Creation and improvement of
resources and knowledge content are continuous processes.
The optimisation, e.g., regarding the resources and modules
for improving resulting outputs is intrinsically supported by
the application of the modules itself. This is based on the fact
that intermediate results from any application or run can be
used for training of procedures and Knowledge Resources.
VI.
CONCLUSION
This paper presented the research results from an extended
case study and implementation for the identiﬁcation and spatial
mapping of arbitrary non-georeferenced input data entities.
The methodology of knowledge mapping was used for creat-
ing methods and implementing components for different tasks,
e.g., for advanced knowledge as successfully demonstrated
with the case studies. The methodology allowed an efﬁcient
implementation and realisation of methods for the creation of
new context for objects and entities.

It was successfully demonstrated that the goal of the studies
and implementations to create different automatable methods
for knowledge mapping in a spatial context can be efﬁciently
achieved in very ﬂexible, modular, and reusable ways.
The more, due to the high quality of the knowledge re-
sources in addition with the long-term training, the com-
pleteness of the resulting mapping in this case proved to be
ultimatively complete and sufﬁciently precise for the target
objects without additional intervention, for both methods.
The multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual Knowledge Re-
sources and the Knowledge Mapping based implementations
can beneﬁt from being continuously assisted by training proce-
dures, which can contribute to the complementary knowledge
content. In addition, the results from any of these realisations
can be used to further valorise new knowledge and continu-
ously improve the long-term knowledge resources, which again
extends the quality and quantity of available resources.
With this research the implementations targeted on knowl-
edge based, automatable computational cases of spatial visu-
alisation. This goal was achieved while preserving facilities
for any form of non automated or semi-automated use without
principle constraints.
In addition, the Knowledge Resources could be extended
and improved in quality and quantity by applying the imple-
mentations to various target objects, due to the successfully
mined results achieved from the implemented cases, which
become part of the knowledge resources themselves.
In consequence, the result of this research is a functional ar-
chitecture, which proved to provide most ﬂexible facilities for
creating knowledge mapping and different and very scalable
computational solutions. In consequence, the further develop-
ment of resources and methods allows to consider different
constraints when implementing solutions for a certain task.
It was shown that the architecture allows to efﬁciently create
implementations with signiﬁcantly different characteristics.
The knowledge resources and the knowledge based solutions
provide comprise universal knowledge and are not limited to
a certain discipline or task. Nevertheless, examples limited
to a deﬁned task had to be taken for demonstration. The
presented case studies illustrated how the knowledge mapping
is applied for different solutions, namely country code based
knowledge mapping and afﬁliation based knowledge mapping.
The knowledge objects involved for these solutions however
were not limited to a single discipline and task and are truly
multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual as are all the components
and referenced knowledge involved in the scenarios. Both
solutions are very much visualisations of object entities. Re-
gardless of that fact, both workﬂows are signiﬁcantly different
in steps, methods, algorithms, details of involved knowledge,
and computational characteristics.
The facts, which become visible when the case study
examples are discussed as an example of general abstraction,
while still accessing the same resources: The large range of
ﬂexibility from knowledge, algorithmic, and computational
perspectives. The complements of possibly required solutions
share the complementary knowledge. Here, results comparable
to the country code solution can be created with geo-referenced
place data. In contrast, from the data involved with the country
code solution it is not possible to create a geo-referenced view
based on the associated data.
From the educational view on insight it may be interesting
being able to generate different views of knowledge and infor-
mation in different ways and with different media based on this
methodological approach. The achieved results can become
part of what is known in addition of what is remembered [26]
and can preserve contextual details not learned otherwise.
Therefore, besides the individual context and results deliv-
ered by different implementations, it holds “The journey is the
reward”. The methodology of knowledge mapping as described
can be used for any knowledge and context. The conducted
case study is using terms in arbitrary text on the one hand,
which can be associated with geo-referencing on the other
hand. A different application scenario can be regional ﬂoras
and faunas being mapped to an biological context, in which
case even no geo-referencing or cartographic visualisation
needs to be involved. Instead, the results can show the level
of complexity for certain cases.
In conclusion, one can choose solutions under different
constraints of application scenarios, e.g., knowledge involved,
ﬂexibility of sequences, and computational requirements. That
way, it is possible to create scalable solutions considering the
implementation of required procedures and methodologies, as
well as the implementation of required infrastructures. Further
future research will be spent on extending the dimensional
extent of knowledge resources and on the creation of advanced
methodologies for creating method for advanced knowledge
mining, further increasing quality and quantity of multi-
disciplinary and multi-lingual content, knowledge mapping,
and integration.
