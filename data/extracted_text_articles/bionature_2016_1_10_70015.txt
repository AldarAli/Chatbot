Abstract— The limitation factor for using of the local energy 
resources in Israel is the persistent one that causes different 
economics participants to develop the ‘green’ technologies. The 
wind 
turbines 
installation 
constitutes 
undoubtedly 
an 
important trend of their efforts in this area. Many methods are 
elaborated for assessment of the investment projects in the 
industry and energetics. One of them, extensively applied to 
the investments evaluation, presents the standard discounted 
cash flow method, using the net present value criterion. 
Yet, this method is unsuitable for the fast altering investment 
environment, and for the consequent need of the managerial 
decisions flexibility. The technique of real options analysis is 
broadly used nowadays in many investment projects of 
renewable energy for their efficiency estimating. The current 
research develops the real options analysis facilities for 
evaluation of the wind turbines efficiency and profitability, as 
a part of the wind energy economic potential in Israel.

 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, considering the Israeli energy market, even 
when such plentiful sources of traditional nonrenewable 
energy as the prominent gas fields discovered in the 
Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Israel: the Tamar [1] and 
the Leviathan [2] gas fields with the estimated stocks of 356 
and 450 billion cubic meters respectively, - the perspective 
of their exhaustion still forces the state, as other numerous 
countries, to devote various efforts to the ‘green’ energy 
research and development. These efforts are undertaken 
primarily in the area of solar energy, but also last period in 
wind energy installations. Yet the wind power amount 
produced in Israel is diminutive comparing to the 
continuously growing world global market, however, the 
last steps undertaken by the state are designed to improve 
the situation. 
Israel currently operates one wind farm in Asanyia Hill 
in the Golan Heights, with an installed capacity of 6 MW 
(10 turbines at a height 50 meters including blades, each 
with a capacity of 600 kW), consumption of about 5 
thousand families. The duty cycle of the wind farm 
operating reaches 97%, and electricity selling consists 1 
million US $ a year. Indeed, wind energy potential of Israel 
is restricted due to moderate- or poor-wind velocities’ areas, 
and is limited to the areas with sufficiently high average 
wind speed, some of which are being opposed by green 
groups on landscape conservation grounds. Anyhow, in 
accordance with the Israel Ministry of Environmental 
Protection (IMEP) directions, the state continues efforts for 
the development of two more farms with a 50 MW capacity 
[3]. 
As it is emphasized in a document of the Israeli Knesset 
(Parliament), an improved estimate, based on the wind 
turbines’ technological development, gives a value higher 
than 500 MW for the Israeli potential wind energy capacity 
[4].  
 The main goal of this paper is the study of the influence 
of energy price fluctuations on the assessment of the 
feasibility wind turbine installation using the real option 
analysis tool.  
The economic output of wind turbine field is a function 
of its electric power output and market energy prices, when 
the electric power output is a function of the equipment used 
and wind velocity statistics. 
The equipment can be chosen to have an optimal cut-in 
speed (the wind speed level at which the turbine begins to 
generate electricity), and the cut-out speed (the speed level 
at which the turbine hits its alternator limit and intermits to 
produce increased power output following increases in a 
wind speed) [5]. For a more detailed discussion, we refer the 
reader to results of our previous investigations of the wind 
energy use, devoted to the technical appropriateness and 
environmental relevance questions [6]-[9]. 
While the annual power output of the field can be known 
to a high certainty degree, the prices of energy may vary 
indeterminately, and thus should be considered as a 
prominent investment risk. To evaluate the influence of risk

correctly we suggest the real option analysis which is the 
subject of this paper. 
In this context, our purpose is to contribute to the way 
where, following Grossman’s conception of risk allocation, 
"decentralized economy allocates risk and investment 
resources when information is dispersed" [10, p. 773]. 
Thus, in Section II, we describe the results of our 
preliminary statistic survey and the estimation results based 
on the investigated area’s data. In Section III, we outline 
and apply the methods of the wind energy exploitation’s 
estimation using the real options technique. Section IV is 
devoted to the analysis of energy prices’ volatility in general 
and in Israel particularly.  In Section V, we complete the use 
of the real options analysis for the wind turbines assessment 
in a case of high variability applying to the given data, and 
in Conclusion, we summarize the main obtained results. 
II. 
STATISTIC ESTIMATION RESULTS 
In the general framework of our research, we 
concentrated on the wind velocity distribution at the Golan 
Heights region, using the data of the Meteorological Service 
of the Israel Ministry of Transport and Road Safety [11], 
collected by the Merom Golan meteorological station, one 
of the 84 Israeli stations which is situated at the given area 
[12], for the 2014 year. The data include 52,066 
observations during this period of time, the sample values of 
the wind speed, one observation for every 10 minutes, 144 
values per day (except some non-significant missing values) 
[13]. 
We used the Weibull distribution function as the 
common accepted most appropriate function describing the 
wind speed statistical frequencies at a given location in most 
of the world. This information is essential for the planning 
of the wind turbine optimal configuration [6]. 
Generally, the Weibull probability distribution function 
(PDF) is defined, concerning a random variable of the wind 
speed X, by two parameters. They are a shape parameter k 
(dimensionless) and a scale parameter λ (m/s for the wind 
speed), which together determine the PDF form, as follows:

The PDF parameter values in (1) are significant for 
choosing the optimal location for the wind turbine, as well 
as for selecting most efficient turbine, which imply the wind 
farm efficiency [14]. 
For fitting the observed data of the given location to the 
PDF [15], we used the method of the maximum likelihood 
estimators [16]. The corresponding Weibull PDF for the 
wind speeds distribution at the Merom Golan site, together 
with their distribution histogram, is shown below in Figure 
1.

The figure demonstrates visually that low and moderate 
winds are widespread, with a tight condensation at the 
primary segment, which means that storms are just rare. It 
should be noticed that the distribution approximation by a 
Weibull PDF in this case is not perfect, though we could 
however obtain approximately based on it, the wind 
principal statistical parameters. 
Estimated annual parameters of the wind Weibull 
distribution were found to be: k =1.7228 and  =4.1206 m/s. 
In addition we calculated (excess) kurtosis (a measure of the 
PDF sharpness) to be 2.1757, and skewness (a measure of 
the PDF asymmetry) as 0.0574, were calculated to 
demonstrate the specific type of the Weibull PDF.  
The main meaningful statistical parameter for planning 
of the wind turbine installation, the speed mean, was 
obtained of 3.73 m/s, with Standard deviation of 2.03, 
during the given period, with a positive right-skewed tail. 
This finding, in accordance to the Israeli Cooperative for 
Renewable 
Energy 
conclusions 
[17], 
indicates 
the 
possibility of wind energy exploitation in the investigated 
region. 
III. 
USING OF THE REAL OPTIONS ANALYSIS  FOR THE 
WIND ENERGY EXPLOITATION’S ESTIMATION 
While the standard discounted cash flow (DCF) method 
using the net present value (NPV) criterion is extensively 
adopted to evaluate investments, the standard DCF method 
is inappropriate for a rapidly changing investment climate 
(Dixit and Pindyck [18]; Herath and Park [19]; Lee and Shih 
[20]) and for the managerial flexibility in investment 
decisions (Hayes and Abernathy [21]; Hayes and Garvin 
[22]; Trigeorgis and Mason [23]; Trigeorgis [24]). 
In recent years, the real options analysis technique is 
widely applied in many studies for valuation of renewable 
energy investment projects, for example Lee and Shih [20], 
Kumbaroğlu, Madlener and Demirel [25], Boomsma,  
Meade and Fleten [26], Menegaki [27].  Hence, we apply in 
this study the real options analysis approach for the 
valuation of wind energy turbines. In particular, we capture 
the value of the follow-on investment opportunities which 
add value to the investment.  
We found in our study on the basic Black-Scholes model 
of a financial market [28], because we focus on the missing 
value of the option to abandon in an environment where it is 
impossible to estimate the standard deviation by the 
numerical tools. 
We analyze in the current study the feasibility of 
installing an additional turbine field in the Asanyia Hill in 
the Golan Heights, in order to extract value from wind. We 
have partly based our investigation on the achieved results 
of the wind turbines construction and exploitation in Israel 
[29], while some of the numbers presented here are rough 
estimates. The decision to build the field which 
encompasses many turbines can be divided into two stages: 
in the 1st stage, we build one unit.  After building and 
operating which may take few years, the 2nd decision on 
building the turbine field is taken based on electricity price 
at this stage. 
We model the uncertainty over future electricity prices 
as a price of an underlying asset of a real option using 
Black-Scholes formula (2) as in [28]:

The notations in (2), (3) above are as follows: 
C is the call option value, S0 is the price of the 
underlying asset, K is the exercise price, r is the annual risk

standard deviation (StD) of the return of the underlying 
asset. N stands for the normal distribution cumulative 
density function (CDF). 
All the used figures were elaborated in accordance with 
a proposed scenario as in a Table I below, where the real 
figures can be introduced according to the data of each 
project (all costs are given in millions $US). 
We apply here the technique of real option valuation as 
illustrated in Brealey et al. [30, p. 584], where we have 
replaced:

- the stock price with the current value of the field, 
S0=114.7 million $US, which is the present value of 20 
years future operation with annual profit of 0.2 million $US 
per turbine for a field of 50 turbines, discounted with 6% 
annual cost of capital; 
- the number of periods to exercise in years (T) with the 
number of years between confirmation of 1st stage (one unit) 
to the decision on the 2nd  stage (the field). 
We have therefore calculated firstly the call value, based 
on the annual StD estimation of 0.031, as 57.05 million 
$US. This StD estimation of 0.031 is based on the data of 
the Electric Power Monthly report of the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (EIA), Table 5.3 “Average 
Retail Price of Electricity to Ultimate Customers” [31]. 
Our assumption of the 1st unit’s building cost is equaled, 
as above mentioned, to 50 million $US, where such high 
expenses of the first turbine’s launching include, among 
others, research and development to adapt the turbine to the 
specific area under consideration and the cost of connecting 
it to the power grid, subtracted by the profit from operation.  
Hence, the results indicate that the investment in the 1st 
turbine stage is warranted, and that there is the option to 
follow on, which adds significant value to the investment.  It 
follows that the net profit of the 1st stage is 57.05-50 = 7.05 
million $US for the standard deviation value of 0.031, 
accordingly to the following data of a Table II (in a column 
for the StD = 0.031 case), which includes the intermediate 
values and the option to follow-on. 
For comparison with a scenario lacking an option to 
abandon, the project value is estimated as the present 
discounted value of a difference between (i.e., the earnings 
from) the future cash flow raised from the 2nd stage 
realization subtracted by the 2nd stage building cost, which 
subtracted additionally by the 1st stage building cost.  
Applying to our numerical example, this yields just the 
negative benefit, meaning merely loss, of the 
(114.7-60)/1.062 - 50 = -1.3 million $US.  
However, using StD of 0.031 yields a profit of 7.05 
million $US, as was calculated above. This is so because 
one can make a choice to abandon the project in its midst. 
This is the economic meaning of the real option.

ESTIMATING THE VOLATILITY OF ENERGY PRICES 
It is difficult to determine the direction and intensity of 
energy prices in the future.  For example, the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration in its "Independent Statistics & 
Analysis" publication "The Availability and Price of 
Petroleum and Petroleum Products Produced in Countries 
other than Iran" states:  
"The uncertainty on both the supply and demand side of 
the market could result in large future price movements 
[underlined by the authors]. The possible lifting of sanctions 
on Iran could move additional supply on to the world 
market and reduce prices, while an unexpected supply 
disruption at a time of low surplus production capacity may 
push prices higher" [32]. Such irregular fluctuations in 
supply and demand can be observed in the graph from this 
report in Figure 2, where the spread between production and 
consumption is widening since July 2014. 
In addition to the world energy price uncertainty, there 
are at least four other sources for price uncertainty in Israel: 
(a) the possibility of military conflict; (b) the discovery of 
gas in Israel's shore; (c) the adoption of gas by the industry; 
For example, Foenicia – a glass manufacturer that was 
recently close to bankruptcy due to luck of gas turned to be 
a profitable [33]; and (d) the discovery of oil in the Golan 
Heights [34]. 
While it is still difficult with all these sources of 
uncertainty to determine the direction and intensity of the 
change of energy price, we must consider thus the 
possibility of high volatility in price. To this end, we will 
consider hereafter the possibility of high volatility taken to 
be StD=40% per annum. 
 
V. 
 USING OF THE REAL OPTIONS ANALYSIS  FOR THE 
WIND ENERGY EXPLOITATION’S ESTIMATION WITH HIGH 
VOLATILITY 
Calculating the call value, based on the annual StD 
estimation of 0.4, yields 59.48 million $US (compared to 
57.05 million $US based on StD of 0.031).  
It follows that the net profit of the 1st stage increased to 
59.48-50 = 9.48 million $US (see Table II, a column for the  
StD = 0.40 case). 
It would be worth to notice here that the main statistical 
parameters of the wind speed at the Merom Golan area, the 
mean and StD, are observed with a tendency to stability, 
without any significant divergence over the period of last 
years 2009-2014, as it follows from the calculated at the 
Table III data.

The expectation value of an annual average is the same as 
the expectation value for one sample but the standard 
deviation of the annual average is equal to the standard 
deviation of one sample divided by the square root of the 
annual number of samples. Thus, the standard deviation of the 
annual average of wind speed is between 0.6%-1.1% and can 
be further reduced by more sampling. A six year average 
based on 24327 samples will be 3.72 m/s with only 0.4% 
standard deviation. 
The standard deviation of average power for all turbines 
investigated is much lower than the mentioned above standard 
deviations. Hence, a long term project can ignore the risk 
connected with the standard deviation of wind speed. 
This circumstance determines the fact of non-relevancy of 
the speed variance, during prolonged period of time, for the 
wind turbine economic value; this should be compared to the 
significance of the energy prices for the turbine economic 
value.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Traditional calculation for an uncertain cash flow applies 
just the expected values of the cash flow from the project 
without the possibility to abandon.  Given our empirical 
assumptions, this yields a loss of 1.3 million $US instead of 
any profit, meaning the project becomes not worthwhile. 
Contrariwise, applying the proposed real option analysis, 
which reveals the value of the option to abandon the 2nd stage 
running as well, we turn the project just to become profitable 
and worthwhile. The value of the real option increases 
depending volatility to be either 57.05 million $US or 59.50 
million $US depending on future volatility, and the profit is 
either 7.05 million $US or 9.48 million $US, respectively.
