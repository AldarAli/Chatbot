Abstract— The nutrient concentration greatly influences the 
formation of various colony patterns generated by bacterial 
populations. We consider a 2D cellular automaton growth 
model of bacterial colony in the case of nutrient limitation. The 
present cellular automaton simulates the growth process in 
order to obtain these patterns in the case of random 
inoculation. We show that numerical patterns are close to those 
experimentally observed in the literature. 
Keywords-Cellular automaton; bacterial colony; nutrient 
limitation.

 INTRODUCTION  
 
Bacteria 
predominantly 
live 
in 
surface-associated 
communities [1]. They develop at any interfaces that are 
suitable for microbial growth. Important examples where 
bacteria develop are teeth [2], waste water treatment [3], 
problem of biocorrosion [4]. It is well known that these 
biological systems are combination of several behaviors of 
interacting individuals. These interacting individuals are 
able to produce higher-level patterns especially in the case 
of in-plane expansion of colonies. 
In the case of random inoculation, the collaboration of 
bacteria has been recently studied in the case of 
Pseudomonas Aeruginosa [5]. This study shows the 
existence of important links between patterns and the 
competition between growth and nutrient access. By varying 
the nutrient access, several patterns have been observed 
such as: dense, labyrinth, worm-like, spots or small and big 
holes (see Figure 1). The experimental setting consisted in 
cultivating a biofilm on glass coverslip submerged in 
inoculated liquid medium. This study investigated how 
evolutionary competition among individuals affects colony 
patterns. The main contribution was to provide a formal link 
between higher level patterning and the potential for 
evolutionary conflict in social systems. The "worm-like" 
configuration is obtained at the beginning of the experience 
when cells begin to colonize the surface. The nutrient 
competition between cells is very important due to a limited 
substrate. The colony growth is therefore limited and small 
colonies form the biofilm. If we increase the substrate 
concentration, nutrient competition is less important 
between bacteria, growth becomes heterogeneous in space, 
circular colonies deform due to fingering [6] [5] and leads to 
the "labyrinth" configuration. Conversely, if the nutrient 
concentration is saturated, all bacteria have a nutrient 
access, the nutrient competition is lower, the colony growth 
is fast until reaching the "dense configuration".

Cellular automata are now commonly used in ecology 
research. This modeling approach is appealing because it 
represents directly the individuals and their behavior,

making easier the link with scientific expertise about the 
ecosystem than in more abstract models. They show 
interesting spatio-temporal patterns that can be compared 
with observations. Several individual-based models have 
been used to model bacterial colony patterns in the case of 
in-plane expansion.  
The aim of the present study is to include the competition 
phenomenon in the growth process and to highlight the 
advantages and the limitations of a such model. For this 
purpose, a simple cellular automaton based on the numerical 
and experimental observations is proposed in the first 
section by focusing on nutrient competition aspects. This 
model is then explored in the case of random inoculation 
and 
numerical 
patterns 
are 
compared 
to 
patterns 
experimentally observed in the literature. Results are 
analyzed so as to give new means about competition 
between growth and nutrient access and explanations on the 
emergence of higher-level patterns. 
 
II. 
CELLULAR AUTOMATON OF BACTERIAL COLONY 
 
Discrete modeling of bacterial dynamics has been 
developed using individual-based models or cellular 
automata [7]. They have been already used in several and 
various domains in order to simulate patterns and constitute 
an additional approach to the differential equation approach. 
Since 10 years, a lot of individual-based models of bacterial 
biofilms have been developed, mainly by the Delft team [7] 
[8] [9]. Individual-based model and cellular automaton have 
been developed in order to model bacterial patterns in the 
case of in-plane expansion. Here, we propose a very simple 
model of bacteria expansion that focuses on the growth 
process including a competition behavior with cooperation 
in order to obtain some of the patterns described in the 
introduction. The main originality lies in the fact that the 
nutrient dynamics is not modeled. 
 
A. Spatial distribution of bacteria  
 
In the cellular automaton growth model, each bacterium 
is only represented by its spatial coordinates (in 2 
dimensions). Let n be the number of bacteria. The 
distribution of bacteria in the 2D space is given by the list 
i n
ix
1) ≤ ≤
(
of 2D positions.  
 
B. Bacteria dynamics 
 
Bacteria dynamics only includes a growth process. We 
assume that each bacterium cell has a constant probability b 
to produce a daughter cell during a time interval dt. 
Moreover, we had a competition function 
( ( '))
C d x
 in 
order to take into account the competition behavior. For this 
purpose, we consider a bacterium i, located at xi, that gives 
birth to a new bacteria, located at x’ such as to maximize the 
probability

This process represents the probability to a bacteria, 
located at 
ix , to give birth to a new bacteria, located at 'x , 
that is dispersed following the kernel 
1
ω . This dispersion 
kernel allows us to model the cell spreading on a surface 
which is commonly observed in the literature [5] [10]. The 
second term 
( ( '))
C d x
 represents a competition function. 
The aim is to propose a relevant competition function 
( ( '))
C d x
 based on the numerical observations performed 
in Section 2. This competition function depends on the local 
bacterial density 
d(x )'

The function 
d(x )'
 takes into account the influence of 
other bacteria in the growth process. The function 
2
ω  
enables us to model a nutrient competition due to a low 
diffusion coefficient through the value of 
2
σ . Indeed, if we 
consider a reaction-diffusion model, the distance between 
two bacteria affects the bacteria growth, especially in the 
case of a low diffusion coefficient of the nutrient. The 
influence of the nutrient diffusion coefficient process can be 
represented by the value of 
2
σ . In an experimental point of 
view, this competition process is observed for example in 
the DLA-like patterns [11]. The idea is to model this 
competition term with a simple function. This competition 
function 
( ( '))
C d x
 has to have the following properties:

Furthermore, the function has to have a parameter that 
enables us to tune the intensity of the competition due to the 
nutrient concentration. Different functions can be used such 
as exponential or polynomial We have chosen the following 
polynomial function:

In the case of n = 0, the competition term 
( ( '))
C d x
 is 
equal to 1, leading to no competition. It leads to have a 
classical growth process where the nutrient concentration is 
very important (limit case). For n > 0, the competition term 
( ( '))
C d x
 tends toward 0 for a high bacterial density in the 
local environment of the potential new bacteria. In this case, 
the bacteria become "`non active"'. When there is no 
bacterium in the local environment of the potential new 
bacteria, the competition term 
( ( '))
C d x
 is equal to 1, that 
is to say there is no competition. As explained above, n 
enables us to tune the intensity of the competition (see 
Figure 2). For high values of n, the competition is very 
important. It leads to slow down the growth of the bacterial 
population and to simulate bacterial behaviours observed in 
Figure 1.  
Finally, the lower the value of the competition function 
( ( '))

of the probability

a higher probability to be located in a new place where there 
are few bacteria. 
 
The cooperative aspect of bacterial biofilm has been 
described in [5] [12]. This cooperation is simply taken into 
account through the maximization of 
)
,
(
x
B x
i
′ : bacteria 
mechanically push the new bacteria where the environment 
is the most favourable. It enables us to model the 
mechanical pressure with a preferential direction (where the 
competition is the lowest). Losses in biomass are not 
considered because we consider that this phenomenon can 
be neglected in this phase of growth. Some simulations have 
been done (not reported in this paper) and have shown that 
losses in biomass influence the density of bacteria and the 
dynamics but not the obtained patterns in a qualitative point 
of view. The aim here is to propose a new growth process 
(including competition behavior) and to show that we can 
obtain patterns observed in the literature with the proposed 
growth process. 
 
C. Implementation 
 
The current model depends on 4 variables: b, 
1
σ , 
2
σ  
and n. A cellular automaton has been implemented using a 
200x200 µm2 grid. The model was implemented in Matlab 
(7.2) for Windows with the following operations: 
 
1. initialization of a population of N bacteria randomly 
located. The distribution of bacteria in the 2D space is given

RESULTS 
 
In this section, we have computed the spatial patterns for 
different values of the parameters. However, we have 
decided to fix the value of 
1
σ  (
1
σ =1µm). It seems to be 
unrealistic to have a higher value of 
1
σ . Moreover, if we 
increase this value, spatial structures tends to be uniform. 
We have chosen b = 1 bacteria.t-1, here. Note that for low 
values of b, spatial structures don't change but execution 
times increase. In the following, we started simulations from 
an initial state that represented a uniform inoculation with 
individuals, placed at random locations. The initial density 
of individuals is equal to 1% of the domain. We have tested 
different values of n and 
2
σ  and highlighted their influence 
on the competition process: n = (1, 5, 15, 25) and 
2
σ  = (4, 
6, 8) µm. Simulations have been stopped when the increase 
of individuals between two time steps is inferior to 0.1% in 
order to have a quasi-steady state. Results are plotted on 
Figure 3. Comments are: 
 
- influence of n: n is directly linked to the competition 
between individuals. The n-parameter increases this 
competition and leads to a decrease of the number of 
individuals. When n=0 (not reported here) or 1, the 
competition is weak and the distribution of the bacteria is 
uniform. Then, when n increases, labyrinth appears and for 
high values of n we have worm-like configurations. These 
results are concordant with the observed patterns (see Figure 
1): no competition leads to a dense and uniform 
configuration; important competition leads to worm-like 
patterns and the labyrinth pattern corresponds to the 
intermediate case; 
- influence of 
σ 2
: 
σ 2
 influences the competition 
distance. When the value of 
2
σ  is low, the competition 
between bacteria is not important. It leads to labyrinth 
with small voids. On the contrary, when the value of 
2
σ  
is high, large voids are observed within the labyrinth; 
- influence of the competition on the bacterial density ρ: 
we can see that configurations are directly linked to the 
final bacterial density. Indeed, the steady state depends on 
the competition between individuals and on the number of 
individuals, that is to say the bacterial density. When the 
competition is not important (n=5), bacteria can grow and 
we have a high steady bacterial density. On the contrary, 
when the competition is important, the growth is slowed 
down by the competition leading to a lower steady 
density. From a qualitative point of view, we have 
compared on Figure 7 the final density calculated from 
the simulated patterns and the density calculated from the 
experimental patterns. It clearly shows that we have a 
same qualitative correlation between densities and 
patterns; 
- main models enable us to converge to a steady state 
using losses in biomass. The current model leads to a 
convergence of the bacterial density with the use of a 
competition term in the growth process. We can see that 
patterns are directly linked to the final bacterial density 
(see Figure 5).

CONCLUSION 
Since twenty years ago, patterns of expansion produced 
by 
bacterial 
populations 
have 
experimentally 
been 
highlighted in the literature. Different models have been 
proposed in the literature, mainly based on differential 
equations, in order to simulate these patterns. A growth 
process including competition has been proposed in this 
paper that has been implemented in a cellular automaton. 
The competition aspect is taken into account by the 
calculation of a local bacterial density that is weighted by a 
polynomial function. Results have shown that this model 
enables us to obtain observed patterns in the case of random 
inoculations. This model leads to steady states with the use 
of the competition term in the growth process. Results have 
also shown that the obtained patterns are linked to the final 
bacterial density. Finally, this growth process (with a 
competition term) can be used in more complex models so as 
to take into account competition.
