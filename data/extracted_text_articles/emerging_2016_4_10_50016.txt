Abstract—In this paper, we describe the development of an
energy performance assessment system to evaluate the energy
performance of existing buildings to deliver energy efficiency
improvements by building remodeling. In consideration of the
performance effect of building structure and operation, this
system uses two kinds of building energy models, such as ISO
13790 and EN15232, to calculate the energy consumption of a
building. In order to run an accurate building energy model,
we use bill based energy consumption data and the Bayesian
calibration method to find the current value of uncertainty
parameters such as performance coefficient and deterioration
coefficient of various building components. So, this system can
accurately evaluate the energy performance of an existing
building. Also, it can provide Energy Conservation Measures
(ECM) for remodeling of existing buildings. The proposed
system can be used as an effective and accurate energy
performance assessment tool for improving energy efficiency
of existing buildings through building remodeling.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, the Korean government has announced it will
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 37% from the previous
projected emission levels for 2030. It takes about 22% of
national
energy
consumption
in
the
building
sector.
Therefore, building remodeling strategies to improve the
energy
efficiency
of
buildings
to
cope
with
these
requirements have been actively promoted. In Korea, there
are official building energy simulation programs, such as
ECO2, ECO2-OD (Office Design)[1], Building Energy
Simulation for Seoul (BESS) that evaluate the energy
performance and validate building energy efficiency rating
of a new building. But now there is no tool to evaluate the
energy performance of existing buildings. Therefore, a new
way is needed to effectively determine the deterioration and
performance
degradation
of
building
structures
and
equipment according to the aging of the building. Also, a
way to determine the energy efficiency of the building in
accordance with the operating method is needed. In this
paper, we describe the functional element of the system and
the
energy
performance
evaluation
model
based
on
ISO13790[2] and EN15232[3] and the way to improve the
accuracy
of
the
model
by
using
bill
based
energy
consumption data of existing building and stochastic energy
model calibration method. Finally, we show the comparison
results between actual energy consumption and predicted
energy consumption.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
To
evaluate
the
energy
performance
of
existing
buildings, it is very important to know how to effectively
find the current value of unknown variable related to the
performance of building components according to their age.
We proposed three methods to effectively derive the
coefficient of performance and deterioration, and to apply
them to building energy model in calculating building energy
consumption. First, we use the Bayesian calibration method,
which is a stochastic energy calibration model that uses
actual energy consumption data based on the bill. Second,
we use the deterioration equation method that can predict the
deterioration degree of building components according to
their age. Third, we use the monitoring method to directly
measure
the
actual
value
with
respect
to
building
components
influencing
the
energy
performance
of
buildings. Fig.1 shows the conceptual architecture of an
energy
performance
assessment
system
for
existing
buildings.

A.
Input File Genergation
This function asks the user to input the attribute values of
each building component such as envelope, heating, cooling,
renewable energy, measured data, and operation mode etc.
Also, it makes Excel-based building information and a list of
input parameters with uncertainty and it selects probability
distribution for these input variables. Excel-based building

data),
monthly

consumption data based on bill and energy source, the
schedule data to calculate the monthly average indoor heat

B.
Building Energy Model Generation
This function creates a building energy model to
calculate energy performance for existing buildings based on
ISO13790 and EN15232 energy model. ISO13790 calculates
the energy used by heating, cooling, hot water, lighting,
ventilation. EN15232 rates the operation mode of BACS and
applies efficiency coefficient according to the operation
mode to ISO 13790 energy calculation.
C.
Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity analysis is to identify the input variables
that greatly influence energy consumption in the energy
model. It is performed by Morris method to exclude input
variables with low influence from Bayesian calibration.
D.
Building Energy Model Calibration
This function performs calibration of input variables of
the energy model by using the actual energy usage data of
the analytic target building. It is performed in the building
energy
model
calibration
considering
the
inherent
uncertainty of the unknown input parameters automatically
generated building energy model. The unknown variables of
building energy model are corrected by a stochastic model
calibration scheme based on Bayesian theory. Bayesian
calibration is a process that estimates the probability
distribution of the calibrated input variables to make the
predictive value of a building energy model similar to the
actual building energy consumption. It uses the Metropolis-
Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
method.
E.
ECM Generation and Economical Effect Analysis
This function is to predict the current value of an
unknown
variable
with
respect to
each passive/active
component of the building by using the calibrated building
energy model as a base model. After that, it provides users
with
various
ECMs
for
improving
building
energy
performance. Users can select ECMs and it analyzes the
energy and cost saving effects according to the user’s
selection of ECMs. It automatically provides the user with an
optimal alternative in terms of the energy and cost saving
effect. Finally, it reports energy consumption, energy
reduction rate, CO2 reduction, payback, etc.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The developed prototype system was applied to three
actual buildings in Seoul. The performance evaluation results
are shown in Table I. This confirms excellent results in terms
of energy calculation and error rate when compared to the
ECO2-OD, which is used in conventional institutions.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we described a new building energy
performance assessment system to accurately evaluate the
energy performance of existing buildings in Korea. This
system can provide the user with ECMs and analyze the
economic effect to retrofit existing building components.
Experimental results verified that it is more accurate than the
official building energy simulation program ECO2-OD. In
addition, it has 1.5% error rate between the calculated energy
consumption and actual energy consumption. So, it is
expected that this system is a very useful building energy
performance assessment system for building remodeling and
building
energy

certification
for
existing
buildings.
