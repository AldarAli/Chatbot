Abstract— Air quality is one of the most critical issues 
humankind is facing today. There are diverse types of indices 
measuring the air pollution which are mainly based on 
aggregation functions. This paper proposes a model aimed at 
forecasting aggregated air pollution indices based on our theory 
of the linear fuzzy space. The proposed original model consists 
essentially of two sub models. The first one models 
concentrations of pollutants, while the second one models Air 
Quality Index (AQI). We model concentrations of pollutants by 
regression (XGBoost and deep neural network) utilizing fuzzy 
time series of two groups of data (measured concentrations and 
meteorological parameters). Multi-contaminant air quality 
index is modelled as an aggregation of Pollutant Standard Index 
(PSI) obtained via fuzzy linear transformation defined by fuzzy 
breakpoints. Some preliminary results are presented indicating 
model performance in terms of prediction mean absolute errors.  
Keywords: fuzzy set; linear fuzzy space; AQI index; 
aggregation operator. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
In the last decade, mankind has been facing air pollution 
as one of the most important issues with adverse effect on 
human health, but also on the economy of societies. 
According to WHO's annual World Health Statistics report 
from 2016, outdoor air pollution causes approximately 4.2 
million deaths per year [1]. As reported by the European 
Environmental Agency (EEA) in 2018, the number of deaths 
in Europe related to concentrations of the particles PM2.5 was 
about 379,000 [2]. Therefore, there is a great need for the air 
pollution forecasting models which will express the air 
pollution as a simple value that is understandable for a wide 
audience.  
Air pollution is an extremely complex spatio-temporally 
determined dynamic system distinctly characterized by the 
presence of imprecision and uncertainty. Therefore, it is not 
easy to give a precise air pollution forecast, which would be 
of great importance for public health. 
To cope with uncertainty and imprecision, we use a fuzzy 
approach. More precisely, the one based on our previous 
results presented in [3] - [8], where we use mathematical 
models for basic concepts: fuzzy point, fuzzy spatial relation, 
fuzzy ordering, and fuzzy distance. For modelling the 
temporal dimension of air pollution, we use a combination of 
time series models with techniques supporting the 
manipulation of imprecise and uncertain data, known under 
the umbrella term Fuzzy Time Series (FTS). This model 
enables a more adequate air pollution forecast.  
Multi-contaminant Air Quality Index (AQI) manages 
multiple effects due to the exposure to more pollutants, gives 
more complete information on the possible impacts of air 
pollutants and a direction for a more accurate, consistent, and 
comparable AQI system. Hence, we opt for multi-
contaminant AQIs as a model of air pollution estimate.  
The rest of the paper is organized in four sections. Section 
2 presents theoretical foundations together with related work, 
while Section 3 presents the model of the proposed 
framework. Section 4 presents the simulation results for the 
real data set (82457 samples/16 variables/24h measurements) 
while Section 5 summarizes the research results, identifies 
model deficiencies, and outlines future research. 
II. PRELIMINARIES 
The theoretical foundations of our model are based on 
linear fuzzy space theory, multi-contaminant fuzzy AQIs, and 
fuzzy time series. 
A. 
Linear fuzzy space 
In this subsection, we present the fundamental concepts of 
the linear fuzzy space: fuzzy point, linear fuzzy space, fuzzy 
space ordering, fuzzy space metrics, and fuzzy linear 
combination, as defined in [3] – [7]. 
Definition 1 Fuzzy point 𝑃 ∈ 𝑅2, denoted by 𝑃̃ is defined by 
its membership function 𝜇𝑃̃ ∈ ℱ2, where the set ℱ2 contains 
all membership functions 𝑢: 𝑅2 → [0,1]  satisfying the 
following conditions:  
i) 
(∀𝜇 ∈ ℱ2)(∃1𝑃 ∈ 𝑅2) 𝜇(𝑃) = 1,    
ii) (∀𝑋1, 𝑋2 ∈ 𝑅2)(𝜆 ∈ [0,1]) 𝜇(𝜆𝑋1 + (1 − 𝜆)𝑋2) ≥
𝑚𝑖𝑛( 𝜇(𝑋1), 𝜇(𝑋2)), 
iii) function 𝜇 is upper semi-continuous, 
iv) [𝜇]𝛼 = {𝑋|𝑋 ∈ 𝑅2, 𝜇(𝑋) ≥ 𝛼}  𝛼-cut of function 𝜇 is 
convex. 
Here, a point from 𝑅2  with a membership function 
𝜇𝑃̃(𝑃) = 1, is denoted by 𝑃 (𝑃 is the core of the fuzzy point  
𝑃̃ ), the membership function of point  𝑃̃ is denoted by   𝜇𝑃̃, 
while  [𝑃]𝛼 stands for the  𝛼-cut (a set from 𝑅2) of the fuzzy 
point.  
Definition 2 𝑅2 Linear fuzzy space is the set ℋ2 ⊂ ℱ2 of 
all functions which, in addition to the properties given in 
Definition 1, are: 
i) 
Symmetrical with respect to the core 𝑆 ∈ 𝑅2   
(𝜇(𝑆) = 1),   
𝜇(𝑉) = 𝜇(𝑀) ∧  𝜇(𝑀) ≠ 0 ⇒  𝑑(𝑆, 𝑉) = 𝑑(𝑆, 𝑀),  
where 𝑑(𝑆, 𝑀) is the distance in 𝑅2.

ii) Inverse-linearly decreasing regarding points’ distance 
from the core, i.e.: 
If 𝑟 ≠ 0:   𝜇𝑆̃(𝑉) = max (0, 1 −
𝑑(𝑆,𝑉)
|𝑟𝑆| ), 
If 𝑟 = 0:   𝜇𝑆̃(𝑉) = {    1      𝑖𝑓   𝑆 = 𝑉 
    0       𝑖𝑓   𝑆 ≠ 𝑉 , 
 where  𝑑(𝑆, 𝑉) is the distance between point 𝑉 and the 
core 𝑆 (𝑉, 𝑆 ∈ 𝑅2) and  𝑟 ∈ 𝑅 is a constant.  
The elements of that space are represented as ordered pairs  
𝑆̃ = (𝑆, 𝑟𝑆) where 𝑆 ∈ 𝑅2 is the core of  𝑆̃, and  𝑟𝑆 ∈ 𝑅 is the 
distance from the core for which the function value becomes 
0.  
Measurement in the space, especially the distance between 
plane geometry objects, is defined as a generalization of the 
concept of physical distance:  
Definition 3 Let ℋ2  be a linear fuzzy space and  
𝑑̃: ℋ2 × ℋ2 → ℋ+ 
, 
L, R: [0,1] × [0,1] → [0,1]
 be 
symmetric, associative, and non-decreasing for both 
arguments, and L(0,0) = 0 , R(1,1) = 1 . The ordered 
quadruple (ℋ2, 𝑑̃, L, R) is called fuzzy metric space and the 
function 𝑑̃  is a fuzzy metric, if and only if the following 
conditions hold: 
i) 
𝑑̃(𝑋̃, 𝑌̃) = 0̃ ⇔ [𝑋̃]1 = [𝑌̃]1 
ii) 𝑑̃(𝑋̃, 𝑌̃) = 𝑑̃(𝑌̃, 𝑋̃),  ∀𝑋
̃ , 𝑌̃ ∈ ℋ2 
(i) ∀𝑋̃, 𝑌̃ ∈ ℋ2: 
𝑑̃(𝑋̃, 𝑌̃)(𝑠 + 𝑡) ≥ L(𝑑(𝑥, 𝑧)(𝑠), 𝑑(𝑧, 𝑦)(𝑡))   
if 𝑠 ≤ 𝜆1(𝑥, 𝑧) ∧  𝑡 ≤ 𝜆1(𝑧, 𝑦) ∧ 𝑠 + 𝑡 ≤ 𝜆1(𝑥, 𝑦) 
𝑑̃(𝑋̃, 𝑌̃)(𝑠 + 𝑡) ≤ R(𝑑(𝑥, 𝑧)(𝑠), 𝑑(𝑧, 𝑦)(𝑡))  
if 𝑠 ≥ 𝜆1(𝑥, 𝑧) ∧ 𝑡 ≥ 𝜆1(𝑧, 𝑦) ∧ 𝑠 + 𝑡 ≥ 𝜆1(𝑥, 𝑦), 
The 𝛼-cut of a fuzzy number 𝑑̃(𝑥, 𝑦) is given by 
 [𝑑̃(𝑋̃, 𝑌̃)]
𝛼 = [𝜆𝛼(𝑥, 𝑦), 𝜌𝛼(𝑥, 𝑦)] (𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝑅+, 0 < 𝛼 ≤ 1). 
The fuzzy zero, 0̃ is a non-negative fuzzy number with 
[0̃]1 = 0.   
Definition 4 Let ℋ2  be a linear fuzzy space. Then, 
function 
𝑓: ℋ2 × ℋ2 × [0,1] → ℋ2
 called 
a 
linear 
combination of the fuzzy points 𝐴̃, 𝐵̃  ∈ ℋ2 is given by: 
𝑓(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃, 𝑢) = 𝐴̃ + 𝑢 ∙ (𝐵̃ − 𝐴̃), 
where 𝑢 ∈ [0,1] and the operator ∙ is the scalar multiplication 
of the fuzzy point. 
B. 
Fuzzy Air pollution indices 
As shown in [7], a multi-contaminant model of AQI, in 
which aggregation functions (aggregation operators) are 
applied to combine several numerical values into a single 
representative, is predominant by far. An aggregation operator 
has natural properties such as monotonicity and boundary 
conditions. In practice, the data is usually normalized, so the 
definition of aggregation becomes: 
Definition 5.  An aggregation function (operator) is a 
function 𝐴(𝑛): [0,1]𝑛 → [0,1]  which satisfies the following 
conditions: 
1. 
is nondecreasing (in each variable) 
2. 
𝐴(𝑛)(0, … ,0) = 0 and 𝐴(𝑛)(1, … ,1) = 1. 
Aggregation applies to various fields and takes diverse 
forms, from the simple to quite sophisticated ones, modelling 
the interaction between criteria which are managed by 
monotone set functions and corresponding integrals [8], [10-
12] that will be incorporated in our future research. 
The simplest 𝐴𝑄𝐼 model calculates a sub-index (𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖) for 
each pollutant 𝑖 by the following linear interpolation formula: 
𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖 = 𝐼ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝐼𝑙𝑜𝑤
𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑤
(𝐶 − 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑤) + 𝐼𝑙𝑜𝑤 . 
Here, 𝐶 is the monitored ambient average concentration of 
pollutant 𝑖; 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑤 is the breakpoint lower than or equal to 𝐶; 
𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ is the breakpoint higher than or equal to 𝐶; and 𝐼𝑙𝑜𝑤 
and 𝐼ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ are the sub-index values corresponding to 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑤 
and 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ, respectively. The overall 𝐴𝑄𝐼 is then calculated 
as a simple max aggregation: 
𝐴𝑄𝐼 = max𝑖=1
𝑚 (𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖). 
There is ongoing research for new aggregation functions, 
which involve the influence of multiple pollutants (see [13] - 
[20]). Among these 𝐴𝑄𝐼s, arithmetic pollutant aggregation 
integrates pollutants in a linear or nonlinear way, and 
weighted pollutant aggregation further assigns varied weights 
from different approaches. The General Air Quality Health 
Index (𝐺𝐴𝑄𝐻𝐼) is proposed as a pollutant-aggregated, local 
health-based 𝐴𝑄𝐼  paradigm suitable for representing a 
complex multi-contaminant situation:  
𝐼𝑠 = (∑(𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖)𝛼
𝑛
𝑖=1
)
1
𝛼
, 
where 𝛼 ∈ [1, ∞]. 
An interesting modification of the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 𝐴𝑄𝐼 is proposed in 
[13], giving a new index 𝑅𝐴𝑄𝐼 which is the product of three 
terms: 
𝑅𝐴𝑄𝐼 = 𝐹1 ∗ 𝐹2 ∗ 𝐹3 
were 
𝐹1 = max(𝐼𝑖),
𝑖 = 1,5 
𝐹2 =
∑
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦
5
𝑖=1
(𝐼𝑖)
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 ∙ (∑
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦
5
𝑖=1
(𝐼𝑖))
 
and the Shannon entropy function is introduced in the third 
term: 
𝐹3 =
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 ∙ 𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 (max𝑖=1
5
(𝐼𝑖))
𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 (max𝑖=1
5
(𝐼𝑖))
 
This model strives to avoid ambiguity (indicating a less 
polluted air as highly polluted) and ellipticity (indicating 
highly polluted air as less polluted) by introducing entropy. 
In addition, there are interesting approaches like in [14] 
that model the air pollution index via a mixture of distributions 
based on its structure and descriptive status.  Each of these 
models can be easily fuzzified by simply mapping crisp space 
to a linear fuzzy space by the suitable fuzzy function over a 
crisp domain.  
There are also results that utilize fuzzy logic for modelling 
air quality indices, like those presented in [15], [16], [19], and 
[20].  
In [15], the input variables are air pollutant criteria (PM10, 
SO2, CO, NO2, O3), and the output variable is fuzzy AQI.

The fuzzification process is defined via the boundary values 
of the universal sets and the corresponding fuzzy sets 
(trapezoidal for input, and triangular for output variables). The 
rule base representing the relationship between input variables 
and output variables contains 243 rules. The max-min 
inference strategy and centroid method are chosen for the 
inference and defuzzification process. 
In [16], ten parameters (selected concentrations of 
pollutants) are divided into two groups. Firstly, the parameters 
in each group are processed by the inference systems, and then 
grouped and normalized between 0 and 100, resulting in two 
new groups. These new groups are processed in the second 
step by new inference systems and result in the Fuzzy Air 
Quality Index (FAQI). All rules (72 in total) have only one 
antecedent. A classical fuzzy inference system (Mamdani) is 
used for this purpose. Common to those results is a reliance 
on an approach that utilizes fuzzy rule-based inference and 
does not include a time series-based prediction.  
In [19], the authors present a comparative study of the 
results obtained from several models for air pollution index 
forecast which shows that the fuzzy time series models 
outperformed the other models in terms of forecasting 
accuracy and computation time. Finally, [20] utilizes a fuzzy 
time series-Markov chain model for predicting the daily air 
pollution index.  
C. 
Fuzzy time series 
Most of the real-world tasks that utilize time series rely on 
multivariate time series models [21]-[24]. The common 
multivariate time series model is [21]: 
Let 𝑍𝑡 = [𝑍1,𝑡, 𝑍2,𝑡, … , 𝑍𝑚,𝑡]
′  be an 𝑚  -dimensional 
jointly stationary real-valued vector process such that 
𝐸(𝑍𝑖,𝑡) = 𝜇𝑖  is a constant for each 𝑖 = 1,2, … , 𝑚  and the 
cross-covariances between 𝑍𝑖,𝑡 and 𝑍𝑗,𝑠 for all 𝑖 = 1,2, … , 𝑚 
and 𝑗 = 1,2, … , 𝑚 are functions only of the time difference 
(𝑠 − 𝑡). 
On the other hand, the original definition of the univariate 
first fuzzy time series model is [24]: 
Definition 6.  Let 𝑌(𝑡)(𝑡 = ⋯ ,0,1,2, … ) , a subset of 𝑅1 
be the universe of discourse on which fuzzy sets 𝑓𝑖(𝑡)(𝑖 =
1,2, … ) are defined and 𝐹(𝑡) is the collection of 𝑓𝑖(𝑡)(𝑖 =
1,2, … ) . Then, 𝐹(𝑡)  is called a fuzzy time series on 
𝑌(𝑡)(𝑡 = ⋯ ,0,1,2, … ). 
Our time series model is a combination of the previous two 
where we apply the same common multivariate model which 
is modified to support imprecise values. In our model, we 
simply replace a crisp point with a linear fuzzy space point 
[2]:  
Definition 7.  Let 𝑌(𝑡)(𝑡 = ⋯ ,0,1,2, … ), a subset of 𝑅1 
be the universe of discourse. Let 𝐻𝑙(𝑙 = 1,2) be a linear fuzzy 
space. Furthermore, let 𝑓𝑖(𝑡)(𝑖 = 1,2, … )  be fuzzy sets 
defined as points on a linear fuzzy space over the given 
universe of discourse, and 𝐹𝑗̃(𝑡)(𝑗 = 1,2, … 𝑚) be collections 
of these fuzzy points. Then, 𝐹𝑡̃ = [𝐹̃1,𝑡, 𝐹̃2,𝑡, … , 𝐹̃𝑚,𝑡]
′ is called 
a linear fuzzy space based fuzzy time series on 𝑌(𝑡)(𝑡 =
⋯ ,0,1,2, … ). This definition enables all features of linear 
fuzzy space to be utilized. For example, a process vector can 
be of a mixed type (some components can be crisp, some can 
be fuzzy) whilst spatial relations defined on the linear fuzzy 
space hold.  
In our framework, diverse machine learning techniques 
can be used to create complex, non-linear relations. 
III. FUZZY MODEL OF AIR POLLUTION INDICES PREDICTION 
In this example, we demonstrate how the linear fuzzy 
space is used for time series-based forecasting. Fuzzy time 
series defined by means of the fuzzy linear space, as described 
in subsection C, are used to model air quality forecast.  
A. 
Data model 
The data model used in this paper consists of temporal 
georeferenced samples. Each sample is a time series covering 
the previous 24h in 1h sample rate (total 385 real values). Each 
time series corresponds to one variable. Variables are divided 
in two groups: meteorological parameters, the Global Data 
Assimilation System (GDAS), and six common air pollutants 
known as “criteria air pollutants.”  
GDAS parameters [25] are described in Table I.

Linear fuzzy space-based air pollution index 
Since air pollutants are measured in different physical 
units and scales, the first step is to transform them into a 
common domain (0-500). This transformation is usually 
defined by breakpoint tables and the resulting values are 
called Pollutant Standard Index (PSI). Instead of using 
discrete functions, we propose a fuzzy linear transformation 
defined by fuzzy breakpoints (Figure 1).

Figure 1.  Fuzzy linear transformation 
A fuzzy linear transformation is defined by an ordered list 
of 2D Fuzzy points 𝑃̃ = (𝑋̃, 𝑌̃) . Each 2D fuzzy point consists 
of two components 𝑋̃ = (𝑋, 𝑟𝑥) and 𝑌̃ = (𝑌, 𝑟𝑌) which are 
1D fuzzy points. Then, Fuzzy PSI (FPSI) is defined as: 
𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑖
̃ = 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝
̃ (𝐶, [𝑃0̃ , … 𝑃𝑛̃ ]) = ( 𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑖, 𝑟𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼) , 
𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑖 = 𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝑌𝑙𝑜𝑤
𝑋ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝑋𝑙𝑜𝑤
(𝐶 − 𝑋𝑙𝑜𝑤) + 𝑌𝑙𝑜𝑤 
𝑟𝑃𝑆𝐼 = 𝑟𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝑟𝑌𝑙𝑜𝑤
𝑟𝑋ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝑟𝑋𝑙𝑜𝑤
(𝐶 − 𝑋𝑙𝑜𝑤) + 𝑟𝑌𝑙𝑜𝑤 
where 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝
̃
 is a fuzzy linear transformation from 
concertation fuzzy space into index fuzzy space. Fuzzy points 
𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
̃  and 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑤
̃  are fuzzy points whose roots of  X̃ components 
are nearest to the concertation 𝐶. 
𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼 can be further represented by a linguistic variable, 
or it can be used directly in the aggregation process.  
A single fuzzy value 𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼 is obtained by applying some 
fuzzy aggregation operator (aggreg) to all (𝑛) component 
𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼 indices: 
𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼 = 𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔(𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑖), 𝑖 = 1, 𝑛  
To simplify the decision-making process and/or facilitate 
general understanding, a fuzzy linguistic variable defined by 
corresponding fuzzy sets can be easily introduced in such a 
model.  
C. 
Prediction model 
In our model, we opt for multivariate regression to forecast 
𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼  (Figure 2). However, other classification methods can 
easily be incorporated in the proposed model.

IV. MODEL APPLICATION  
In order to present the proposed model/methodology, we 
ran one experiment on a large and diverse data set. The used 
data set contains more than 82000 samples each with 385 real 
values. GDAS values are interpolated to fit five geo locations 
and merged with measurements of the concentration of the air 
pollutants. 
A. 
Data set 
In this experiment, we used five data sets from five distinct 
locations in USA, each in the same format. The sources of data 
are [25] and [26]. Samples are indexed by temporal attribute, 
datetime, ranging from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 
2021. All ten meteorological GDAS and six air pollutants are 
stored in 24 hours’ time slot with 1h sample rate (385 real 
values in total). Table III presents the data in more details 
(sample sizes per locations).

Fuzzy air quality index 
In our framework, the fuzzy air quality index is modelled 
via a simple max aggregation function applied to five 𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼 
indices of each criteria air pollutants:

Finally, we introduce a fuzzy linguistic variable (very low, 
low, medium, high, very high) defined by corresponding fuzzy 
sets, as depicted in Figure 3.

C. 
Prediction  
In our experiments, we applied two multivariate 
regressors. The first multivariate predictor regressor in this 
experiment is XGBoostRegressor with 24*10 GDAS and 
24*6 air pollutant variables as input, and 5 real valued outputs, 
each corresponding to a single fuzzy set (FAQI_very low to 
very high), as depicted in Figure 3. Data set is split up into 
train (80%) and test (20%) subsets and trained with 1000 
estimators with max_depth 4 and enabled early stopping 
method to avoid overfitting. 
The second multivariate predictor regressor in this 
experiment is a deep neural network with 24*10 GDAS and 
24*6 air pollutant variables as input, and 5 real valued outputs, 
each corresponding to a single fuzzy set (FAQI_very low to 
very high), with one hidden layer consisting of 20 Rectified 
Linear Units (ReLU) nodes. The activation functions in output 
layer are Sigmoid. The data set is split up into train (80%) and 
test (20%) subsets. Two dropout layers with 10% random 
filters are incepted between active layers to prevent 
overfitting.

     Tables VI and VII show that both regressors behave 
similarly. Moreover, they are good in prediction for categories 
medium, high and very high and poor in prediction for 
categories very low and low. Having that in mind and the main 
purpose of the FAQI to alarm of dangerous air pollution (high 
and very high, possibly medium), the results indicate that 
further research is needed and justified.  
V. CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes a model aimed at forecasting the 
aggregated air pollution index that is based on our theory of 
the linear fuzzy space. The proposed model consists of two 
sub models. The first one models the concentration of 
pollutants, while the second one models multi-contaminant air 
quality index. We model the concentration of pollutants by 
regression, utilizing fuzzy time series of two groups of data: 
measured concentrations of pollutants and meteorological 
parameters. The multi-contaminant air quality index is 
modeled as a fuzzy aggregation of PSI obtained via fuzzy 
linear transformation defined by fuzzy breakpoints.  
Preliminary results show that our model is characterized 
by a distinct property which is a good performance for higher 
values of air quality index, and significantly worse (mean 
absolute errors higher for an order of magnitude) performance 
for lower values. This is a notable deficiency of the model 
calling for improvement that will ensure equally good 
performance for all categories.  
Air pollution is a result of an extremely complex and 
interdependent interaction among multiple factors (air 
pollutants, environment, time, climate conditions, etc.) 
additionally burdened with uncertainty and imprecision in 
data. This makes a single index a rough approximation of the 
considered pollution situation.  
Indeed, there is a potential for improvements in the 
research topics tackled in this paper which shapes further 
research directions. The possible improvements could be 
further divided in two rough partitions. The first, which is of 
fundamental kind, is about rethinking the air pollution index 
concept (for example, making it contextually dependent, or 
making it multidimensional). The second one is about 
improvement of the model proposed in this paper: use of new 
parameters (like those in Table IV), training data balancing, 
learning shapes of membership functions from historical data, 
and alike. Improvements should specifically address creation 
of precision metrics in linear fuzzy space, enabling 
estimations of sensitivity of interval partitions selection in 
time series, aggregation models, and fuzzy sets parameters. 
Recent theory development (see [27], [28]) gives a method for 
identification of the optimal solution for convex and non-
convex optimization in fuzzy approach that could help to do 
this. 
The two partitions intersect at utilization of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) methods, particularly fuzzy approach, and 
machine learning techniques.
