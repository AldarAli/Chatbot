Abstract—Our eventual goal is to help students learn more
effectively. Toward this goal, we have asked the students to
retrospectively evaluate themselves and the class by looking back
at what they have learned, and we analyzed the answer-texts in
order to capture them objectively. We found that their viewpoints
affect their performances. Students with wider viewpoints get
better performances than those with narrow viewpoints. In this
paper, we analyze the answer texts for two contrasting targets;
lecture (L) vs. student (S), and good point (G) vs. bad point (B).
We propose an index for measuring the term usage and analyze
the answer texts using this index. We ﬁnd that most terms are
exclusively used in either one of the contrasting questions. For
the numbers of exclusively-used terms, L and G respectively
outperform S and B. Thus, students pay more attentions to
lectures than themselves and to good points than bad points,
as they evaluate. Further, the terms exclusively used in the
combination of L-S and G-B, i.e., LG, LB, SG, and SB, show
the points of evaluation view of students more speciﬁcally.

INTRODUCTION
The aim of our series of studies is to know our students
in order to help them succeed to their full potential in their
university studies. As a part of such studies, we have been
analyzing the answer texts to a retrospective evaluation ques-
tionnaire about lectures and the students themselves [4]–[10].
For example, we have been investigating the students’ attitudes
to the lectures/learning by analyzing the free texts obtained as
the answer to the question related to what they have learned in
class. The results show that the students with high examination
scores incline to use the terms that indicate the students’ wide
viewpoints and wide interests. By contrast, those with low
grades often respond the terms directly related to the lecture’s
main topic [8]–[10].
Such studies of educational data analysis and analytics
are conducted as Educational Data Mining (EDM) [12]. For
example, Romero et al. [13] gave a comparative study of data
mining algorithms for classifying students using e-learning
system data. Its major interest is on predicting the student’s
performance outcome. Our focus is on the student’s psycho-
logical tendency in learning, such as eagerness, diligence,
seriousness. Many studies in EDM use the target data which
are obtained from learning management systems. Different
from them, our target data can be obtained in everyday lectures.
The study by Ames et al. [1] has a similar motivation
to ours. They investigated the students’ attitudes to the class,
learning, and others, on the basis of the answers to question-
naire items. However, their underlying data were obtained by
asking the students to choose the rate from 1 to 5 for each
question item. In our case, even though 2 of our question items
are asking to rate from 0 to 100, other questions are asking
for an answer in a free-text format.
Our data analysis style is different from the major studies in
EDM. Most of them somehow intend to analyze the big data,
and the data obtained automatically as log data. By contrast,
we would rather take the approach of dealing with small data,
because our target data themselves may be very small [5] [7].
Also, the data we deal with are representing students, who we
have to educate and take care of them all. Thus, we have to
pay attention to all the data, even the data locate as outliers,
separated from the central area.
The aim of this paper is to perform an answer text analysis
in order to know more about students’ attitudes to learning
and their points of view while taking a class. We also aim to
develop new methods of analysis through case studies.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II,
we describe the data we use for analysis. In Section III, we
present our interesting ﬁndings in our previous studies. In
Section IV, we conduct the analysis by focusing attention
on the terms used by the students in the answer texts from
questions about good/bad points of the lectures and students
themselves. We analyze what types of terms are used in what
contexts and try to ﬁnd their points of view during learning in
the class. Finally in Section V, we conclude the discussions
and ﬁndings in this paper.
II.
TARGET DATA
The data used in this paper came from a class in
2009 named “Information Retrieval Exercise” in a two-year
women’s university [4]–[10]. The students were in their sec-
ond year, and thus, were going to graduate. The number of
registered students was 35. The class was a compulsory course
for librarian certiﬁcate. Thus, the students of this course were
more motivated than students in other courses. The major aim
of the course for the students was to become expert information
searchers so that they have enough knowledge about informa-
tion retrieval, and enough skills in ﬁnding appropriate search
engine sites and search keywords on the basis of understanding
the aim of the retrieval. One course consists of 15 lectures.
A lecture started with a ﬁve-minute quiz every time, and the
answer sheets were used for recording attendance of students.
Also, homework was assigned every week. Its aim was to
make the students review what they had learned in the class and
to study preliminary knowledge for the next class. At the same
time, the students were requested to write a lecture note every
week, which was also aiming to make the students review what
they had learned. The homework score reﬂected the frequency
and quality of the submitted homework.
The term-end examination of the course consisted of 3

questions. The ﬁrst question was to ﬁnd the search engine sites,
and to summarize their characteristic features, together with
discussing the methods for information retrieval. The second
question was to ﬁnd the Web sites about e-books and on-line
material services. The third question was to ﬁnd and argue
about the information crimes in the Internet environment. The
aim of these questions was to evaluate the skills for information
retrieval, including the skills for planning and summarizing.
These skills were supposed to have been acquired during the
course through in classes exercises and by doing homework.
We used the score of term-end examination as the measure for
the student’s performance.
We also asked the students to answer some questions re-
lated to their overall evaluation of the course. These questions
are [10]:
(Q1)
What did you learn in this class? Did it help you?
(Q2)
What are the good points of the lectures?
(Q3)
What are the bad points that need to be improved?
(Q4)
What score you give to the lectures as a whole? (With
the numbers from 0 to 100, where the pass level is 60
as in the same way to the examination score.)
(Q5)
Write comments on the course, on the lectures and the
lecturer, if any,
(Q6)
What are your good points in learning attitudes and
efforts for the course?
(Q7)
What are your bad points that should have to be
improved?
(Q8)
How do you evaluate your diligence and eagerness
to study? Choose one of “excellent”, “good”, “fair”,
“rather poor”, and “poor”.
(Q9)
Have you asked the lecturer any questions? Choose
one of “asked questions more than once”, “asked
question once”, “had not asked questions”, “could not
ask questions that came up with”, and “no questions
came up at all”. Describe in detail about the ques-
tion(s) you asked, and whether the lecturer answered
appropriately,
(Q10)
Have you done some research or information retrieval
in order to ﬁnd the answers of some questions af-
ter school hours? Choose one of “retrieved often”,
“retrieved sometimes”, “had not retrieved for solving
questions”, and “no questions came up with at all”.
Describe in detail about what you have done,
(Q11)
What score you give to yourself as the evaluation of
your own efforts and attitude toward the course. (With
the numbers from 0 to 100 as in the same way as in
Q4), and ﬁnally,
(Q12)
Write other comments, if any.
For an example of answer texts, we take a student. Her
answers to the ﬁrst half of the questionnaire were as follows:
(Q1) I think I can learn the elementary methods of information
retrieval, how to choose appropriate keywords, and others, for
getting the information I am looking for. What I have learned
is helpful when I do assignments of other lectures. (Q2) I
got to know what I did not know before, and about foreign
libraries. (Q3) Presumably, the lecturer has quite a lot of things
to teach, and thus, the lecture time was often too short to cover
all the contents planned in advance. I felt sorry about that. I
have no idea how to solve this problem. How about ensure to
ﬁnish the contents to be dealt with next time? Alternatively,
how about reducing the time spent to comment on students
homework? (Q4) 87. (Q5) I would like to take this lectures
in the ﬁrst semester, before having the practical training at a
library. Then, it might be more effective in various situations;
especially at the practical referencing training.
For the remaining questions about herself, she answered as
follows: (Q6) The good point for me was I tried as hard as
possible to tackle the homework, even though I thought I was
not good at operating machines and dealing with information.
Also, in order to submit better homework, I completed the
homework by trying to reﬂect on what the lecturer had talked
about. (Q7) I have been misunderstanding about homework,
without thinking about the lecturer’s intention. I should have
recognized it earlier. Further, it was wrong to complain to the
lecturer about homework assignment. Now, I know I made a
mistake about it, so I will not fail again. I agree that it is my
own responsibility what I learn from what are given to me in a
class. Here after, I will try to recognize other person’s intention
ﬁrst, and behave accordingly. (Q8) Fair. (Q9) No questions to
ask. (Q10) No investigation for questions. (Q11) 79. (Q12)
Although I was not very skilled in dealing with machines and
thus, was worried whether I could follow before the lectures,
it was nice that I got enough time to operate a PC and got used
to it through doing the homeworks and others. From now on, I
will try hard to make use of what I have learned in the lectures.
III.
FINDINGS IN OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES
In this section, we illustrate a couple of ﬁndings in our
previous studies. The study in Section IV is carried out on the
basis of these ﬁndings.
A. Analytics of Numerical Items [4]–[7]
We started with investigating the correlation between the
self-evaluation scores (which is obtained from (Q11)) and the
examination scores. The result shows that the students who
have high examination scores evaluate themselves from a very
low scores up to a very high scores, which means that those
students who evaluate low would have the self-image that “I
am the person who can do better than what I have been doing”.
These students have a good desire of self-improvement.
By contrast, the students who have poor performance
seem to believe in themselves without evidence, and evaluate
themselves something like, “I do fairly well in my study”.
Another possibility is that they actually recognize very well
about their poor efforts and poor performance. Still, or maybe
because of it, they wanted to believe that they have put in
good effort, instead of admitting to their lack of effort. In
this way, they could avoid facing what they really were, and
keep their pride. As a result of such a phenomenon, the
correlation coefﬁcient between the self-evaluation scores and
the examination scores becomes a negative value of 0.1.
B. Analytics of Word Usage [8]–[10]
Table I shows the words (translated into English) that
appear in the texts more than 5 times and their number of
occurrences in the answer texts to (Q1), in the decreasing
order of the number. We can see that the words related to
the lectures appear in high frequencies. For example, the word
“Search” appears 88 times in the answers for (Q1), which is the
most frequently used one among all words. Also, the words
“Information”, “Library” and others appear in the list. The
lecture-related words are 6 (20%) among 30 words, whereas
4 (29%) among 14 words with frequencies more than 10.

* Different words in Japanese
In a corresponding analysis between the students and the
terms they used, we divided the students into 5 groups. The
member of the group with the highest average examination
score characteristically used the technical terms and the terms
from broader points of view, in comparing Japan and the world,
such as “Foreign”, “National”, and “Japan”. It is interesting
to see that the terms which are relating to the homework
assignments do not appear in this group. Thus, we can say
that the students in this group attended the lectures with the
attitude of learning in a broad perspective.
In contrast, the students in the group with the lowest
average examination score used quite a lot of frequently-used
general terms, and did not use technical terms at all. It is
interesting to see that many students used a lot of terms
they have learned during the lectures, e.g., “Learn”, “Master”,
“Study”, “Useful”, and “Use”. So, we can guess, they payed
a lot of attention to the terms which are directly relating to
the main topics of the course, whereas they did not pay much
attention to such things like, their background, their relation
to the related concepts, their values in our society.
IV.
ANALYSIS OF LECTURE/SELF AND GOOD/BAD
POINTS OF STUDENTS
In this section, we analyze and discuss how terms are used
in evaluating the lectures and the students themselves as well
as whether they are used for positive points or negative ones on
the basis of the results described in the previous section. Firstly
in Subsection IV-A, we describe the outline of the process
for data analytics, which consists of two parts; term/word
extraction from the texts and investigation of their usage. The
ﬁrst part is described in Subsection IV-B, and the second part
in Subsections IV-C and IV-D.
A. Outline of the Analytics
As we have shown in Section II, (Q2) and (Q3) asked
the students to point out the good and to be improved points,
respectively. Similarly, (Q6) and (Q7) respectively asked the
good and to be improved points of the student herself. Thus, we
call these questions LG (meaning Lecture-Good) for (Q2), LB
(meaning Lecture-Bad) for (Q3), SG (meaning Self/Student-
Good) for (Q6), and SB (meaning Self/Student-Bad) for (Q6)
in order to recognize them with ease.
The aim of this paper is to investigate what kinds of terms
are used in which evaluations for lecture, self/student, good
point, bad point, and try to ﬁnd the students’ points of view
in evaluation. First, we extract terms from the texts that are
supposed to somehow represent the views for evaluations.
Then, we characterize the terms using indexes for measuring
the weights between lecture and self, good and bad points.
B. Term Extraction
We start with extracting the terms used in the answer texts
of students for the questions (Q2), (Q3), (Q6), and (Q7), or
LG, LB, SG, and SB, respectively.
Let n be the number of students, n 
Table II shows the list of most frequently used terms t
with #t C 9, which are 36 in number and the rate of their
total frequencies is about 54%. Note that the noun having
“To+verb” form in English shows that it is a “sahen-noun”,
which allows to add the verb “suru (Do)” and turns into its
verb-form. For example, the 9th term “紹介 (pronounced show-
kai)” is a noun, meaning “introduction”, or “to introduce”. By
adding “する (suru)” it becomes a verb “紹介する (show-kai-
suru, introduction-do)”, meaning “do introduce” or the verb
“introduce”. In the table, such nouns are translated into English
in the form of “To+Verb”. As a sahen-noun and its verb form
are so close to each other, they could be dealt with identically,
as they are the same in the intention of those who use them.
Many terms in the table were popular for (Q1), which asked
the students what they had learned in the class. For example,
the most frequently used term “ToSearch(検索):n” appears as
the 12th term in the table. The second one appears as the 6th.
These terms might be those the students remembered most
when they looked back at the lectures and at themselves.
By contrast, the terms that do not appear many in (Q1)
include the very ﬁrst term “Do(する):v”, the 11th, and those
from 17th to 22nd of Table II. The use of the term “Do”,
however, might not be very important because it is used
so often that its usages might not mean much. The use of
terms from “listen” (17th) to “investigate” (22nd) are probably
related to the 16th term “investigate”, and it means that it
remains in their mind about what their homework assignments
were like, and what they did, or did not.
C. Term Usage Analysis using LS- and GB-indexes
In order to investigate further about how terms are used in
evaluation texts, we introduce a new index, which quantiﬁes
how much is a term used in contrasting evaluation context. Let
t be a term (> T). The LS-index of t is deﬁned as follows:

good points than bad points for lectures, and they pay more
attention to bad points than good points for themselves.
A possible interpretation of such results is that the students
are generally generous to others and they try harder to ﬁnd
good points than bad points as they evaluate the lectures
and the lecturer, and at the same time, they try hard to ﬁnd
something to be improved as they evaluate themselves. We
need to investigate further on this issue.
D. Term-Usage Analysis for Self/Lecture-Good/Bad
In this subsection, we investigate what speciﬁc terms are
used in the types at the 4 corners SG, SB, LG, and LB.
Table IV shows the 20 terms belonging to each of them. As
these index values are either 1 or 1, they are used exclusively
in the corresponding evaluations. Note that some terms with
frequency 1 may not appear in the table.
The SG (i.e., Self/Student-Good) type is the one having
the least number of terms among the 4 types. As we have
a look at the terms in this type, we can see that the terms
relating to their efforts are conspicuous. For example, the
ﬁrst term “ToMakeEffort(努力):n”, which occurs 5 times and
the third term “MakeEffort(頑張る):v”, which occurs twice
are a noun and a verb expression, respectively, which admire
their efforts. Another term, which occurs twice is “Before(以
前):adv”. It appears in the st03’s answer text to (Q6) in the
sentence “It made me use the PC more often than before”.
This sentence does not admire her effort directly. However, it
is a kind of outcome of the lectures and her efforts, and it can
be considered as a sort of indirect admiration of her efforts in
learning.
As we have a look at the terms in the SB (i.e., Self/Student-
Bad) type, we can see that a lot of terms appearing in this
type are those that express regret. For example, the terms
“ToReﬂect(反省):n”, “ToRegret(後悔):n”, and “Regret(悔し
い):adj” directly express the student’s regret.
The most frequently speciﬁed points of regret is about
submitting homeworks, especially that they did not submit
some of them, or they submitted late. The terms “Keep(守
る):v”, “ToManage(管理):n”, “BarelyInTime(ぎりぎり):adv”,
and “BarelyInTime(ギリギリ):adj” are relating with submis-
sion of homeworks. Further, 4 out of 7 appearances of the term
“ToReﬂect(反省):n” relate to homework submissions.
Among the remaining 3 appearances, 2 cases are relating to
private talks and lack of concentration to the lectures. The rest
one mentioned misunderstanding of the lecture’s aim, which
most other students might not be able to recognize at all.
For the LG (i.e., Lecture-Good) type, we can see that many
terms relating to the introductory talks of libraries where the
lecturer had visited appear in the list. All the terms “Over-
sees(海外):n”, “ForeignCountry(外国):n”, “Japan(日本):n”,
and “Photo(写真):n” appear in the context of introductions to
the libraries, especially the ones overseas, where the students
could not visit. Further, some appearances of the ﬁrst term
“Usually(普段):adv” are relating to this issue something like
in the context “As we could not visit overseas library usually,
I always admired when a foreign library was talked about”.
The 9th term “IC(IC):o” and the 10th one “Tag(タグ):n”
refer the talk about IC tags, or RFID tags, installed to libraries,
which is a research topic of the lecturer. This is another topic
which does not belong to the major topics of the lecture at all.
Even with these topics are digressed ones from the major
topics of the lectures, they attracted the students so strongly,
and thus, they might also arouse the students’ interest to the
lectures and the major topics themselves. Actually, according
to our previous studies, the students who admire such talks
have better outcome (examination scores) than those who do
not [8]–[10]. This result inspires the importance of arousing
students’ interest in the lectures.
As we have a look at the terms in the LB type, we recognize
that a lot of terms are related to the time scheduling problem.
A lecture often started with showing one or two assignment
reports of students for the previous lecture, and gave additional
lecture together with some commentaries to the reports. Often
it took a lot of time for such commentaries and just little
time remained for the teaching of new material. Some students
pointed out this problem. More speciﬁcally, the terms “ToDi-
vide(配分):n”, “Reduce(減らす):v”, “ToExplain(説明):n”, and
“Short(短い):adj” are all related with this problem; some are
42

COGNITIVE 2017 : The Ninth International Conference on Advanced Cognitive Technologies and Applications

just pointing out, some are suggesting solutions. Further, one
case for “Want(ほしい):adj” is a requirement on this problem.
The ﬁrst term “Want(ほしい):adj” shows student’s re-
quirement in general, and thus, it was used for a variety of
requirements. A student asked for decreasing the amount of
homeworks. Another one asked for additional explanations.
To summarize our observations in this subsection, students
paid a lot of attention to their efforts mostly as they praised
themselves (SG) and regretted their insufﬁciency of efforts and
diligence (SB). For lectures, they praised the subsidiary talks
because what they heard was new to them and helped them
with widening their eyes to what they had never experienced
before (LG), and they pointed out the problem of time man-
agement (LB).
The speciﬁc points we have from the analysis of this
subsection are very speciﬁc to the data we used, and thus,
it is quite hard to generalize. However, at least, we are able
to demonstrate the usefulness of the methodology of taking
contrasting concepts, which consists of introducing indexes
for measuring usage, classifying and extracting characteristic
terms, and analyzing how they are used, and why.
V.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
We have been studying the student’s attitudes toward the
lectures. Our eventual goal in the research topic of this study
is two-fold: The ﬁrst one is to ﬁnd new facts and tips for
helping our students with more effective learning, and the
other is to develop new concepts and measuring methods which
can be used for the ﬁrst goal. Thus, understandability is very
important in our study. This is the reason why we rather choose
naive methods of analysis than to use more sophisticated, but
less humanly understandable methods.
In this paper, we took the questions (Q2), (Q3), (Q6), and
(Q7) of a retrospective evaluation questionnaire as the target
data in an answer text analytics. They asked for good/bad
points of lectures and the students themselves. Different from
our previous studies, we focused on the terms instead of
dealing with students directly. We introduced a new index
which measures the weight of usage between two contrasting
concepts. By using the indexes for L vs. S and G vs. B, we
divided the terms appeared in the answer texts into 55 groups.
We found that most of them locate at the 4 corners only, which
means they are used speciﬁcally to evaluate either LG, LB, SG,
or SB. By investigating the terms in the 4 corners, we found
that the students evaluated themselves from the viewpoint of
their efforts, and they evaluated the lectures from various
viewpoints; introductory talks of libraries for good points and
time-scheduling problem for bad point.
In comparison with the relation to their outcome, i.e.,
examination scores, we found that the usage of terms did
not correlate very much, which is different from the analytics
for the question (Q1). This difference might come from that
(Q1) asked the students for evaluation in general, and thus,
the answer texts correlate more closely with the students’
viewpoints. The questions for the study in this paper focused
on the good/bad points, and thus, the answers came from a
wide standpoints, which did not relate directly to the students’
ability/attitudes in learning.
Even though our current status of study is in a very begin-
ning stage, the methods developed in our previous studies have
shown high potential in our studies. It will become a necessary
knowledge management tool for student development [9] in
the near future, because it is a very important topic for the
institutional research (IR) for universities [5].
Our future study topics include the following: (1) To
develop a method for devising the new ideas further, and to
perform reﬁnement of dedication to the study of student effort,
and attitudes to learning, measuring diligence(s) of students
[11], together with the further analysis of the evaluation texts.
Also, it is worth comparing our model with other types of
models. (2) By collecting data from a different class, to analyze
them, and to verify if the results of this study are also holds.
Also, it is important to ﬁnd out the characteristic features
of each class by comparing them. It will be interesting to
investigate what features are gender-speciﬁc. (3) To generalize
the analysis methods and to integrate them into an automated
data analysis platform.
