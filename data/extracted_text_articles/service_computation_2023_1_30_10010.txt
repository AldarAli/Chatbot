Abstract—In today’s technology-driven era, managing digital
identities has become a critical concern due to the widespread
use of online services and digital devices. This has led to a
fragmented landscape of digital identities, burdening individuals
with multiple usernames, passwords, and authentication methods.
To address this challenge, digital wallets have emerged as
a promising solution. These wallets empower users to store,
manage, and utilize their digital assets, including personal data,
payment information, and credentials. Additionally, federated
services have gained prominence, enabling users to access multi-
ple services using a single digital identity. Gaia-X is an example of
such a service, aiming to establish a secure and trustworthy data
infrastructure. This paper examines digital identity management,
focusing on the application of digital wallets and federated
services. It explores the categorization of identities needed for
different cloud services, considering their unique requirements
and characteristics. Furthermore, it discusses the future require-
ments for digital wallets and federated identity management in
the cloud, along with the associated challenges and benefits. The
paper also introduces a categorization scheme for cloud services
based on security and privacy requirements, demonstrating how
different identity types can be mapped to each category.

I. INTRODUCTION
The management of digital identities has become a critical
concern in today’s digital age [1]. With the increase of online
services and the widespread use of digital devices, individuals
are constantly required to provide personal information to
access different platforms, services, and applications [2]. This
has led to a fragmented landscape of digital identities, where
users have to manage multiple usernames, passwords, and
authentication methods, which can be both cumbersome and
insecure [3].
Digital wallets have emerged as a promising solution to
tackle the challenge of managing digital identities [4]. These
software applications enable users to conveniently store, man-
age, and utilize various digital assets, such as personal data,
payment information, and credentials.
In addition, Gaia-X, a groundbreaking project [5], exempli-
fies the importance of federated services and the significant
benefits they offer. Gaia-X is designed to provide users with
a robust and secure data infrastructure, empowering them
with unprecedented control over their personal information
[6]. By adopting Gaia-X’s unified digital wallet, users can
conveniently access multiple platforms and services with a
single digital identity, streamlining the management of their
digital presence while bolstering security and privacy. This
usercentric approach not only enhances individual control but
also promotes innovation and competition within the digital
landscape, reinforcing the advantages of Gaia-X’s federated
service model.
In the contemporary digital landscape, the significance of
effective digital identity management cannot be emphasised
enough. Fortunately, emerging solutions such as digital wallets
and federated services provide promising avenues to address
this intricate challenge. This paper aims to delve into the
concept of digital identity management and shed light on its
applications, specifically within the realm of digital wallets and
federated services. Additionally, we will explore the utilisation
of digital wallets for accessing cloud services, offering insights
into their benefits and potential challenges.
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section II pro-
vides background information on digital wallets and federated
services. Section III discusses the requirements for identity
management in wallets to access the cloud. Section IV cate-
gorises cloud access based on identity group levels. Finally,
in Section V, we draw a conclusion.
II. BACKGROUND (STATE OF THE ART)
This section provides an overview of two key components:
Digital Wallets and Federated Services, which play pivotal
roles in ensuring secure and efficient digital experiences.
A. Digital Wallet
The digitisation of transactions has accelerated, particularly
in response to the pandemic, resulting in an increased reliance
on electronic services. Users now engage in various activities,
such as tax declarations, accessing vaccination and test cer-
tificates, and interacting with public administrations, through
digital platforms [7]. To access these services, users must
authenticate themselves and provide electronic identification
(eID) to secure personalised services and data. This authen-
tication process is facilitated by identity management (IdM)
systems, which ensure reliable and secure user authentication.
Digital wallets have emerged as a crucial component in
managing identities in the digital identity domain. A digital
wallet is a secure and encrypted storage solution that allows
users to store and manage their digital identities, credentials,
16

and other relevant information [8]. It acts as a central repos-
itory where users can securely store their authentication data,
such as usernames, passwords, and digital certificates [9].
Digital wallets offer several advantages in identity manage-
ment [10]. They provide convenience by allowing users to
have a single repository for all their identities across different
services and platforms. Users can store and manage multiple
sets of credentials within their digital wallet, eliminating the
need to remember separate usernames and passwords for
each service provider. This simplifies the user experience and
reduces the cognitive burden of managing multiple identities
[11].
Various models of identity management systems have
emerged over the years. The isolated model, where each
service provider has its own identity provider (IdP), was the
earliest and most prevalent [12]. However, this model requires
users to register separately with each service provider, result-
ing in the burden of managing multiple credentials. To address
this, the central identity model was introduced, outsourcing
the IdP functionality to a central entity that multiple service
providers can utilise [13]. Users only need to register once
with the central IdP and can then access various services with
the same set of credentials.
While the central identity model improves usability, it raises
concerns about the central IdP becoming a single point of
failure and potential privacy breaches. To overcome these
challenges, the federated IdM model was introduced, establish-
ing trust relationships among multiple IdPs [14]. This model
allows users registered with one IdP to authenticate themselves
to service providers served by other IdPs within a circle of
trust. An example is the European eIDAS interoperability
framework [15], which enables cross-border authentication
processes by federating national IdM systems of EU Member
States.
Another approach is the user-centric IdM model, where
identity data is stored in the user’s domain, such as on a
smartcard or a smartphone with a hardware-based security
element [16]. Users retain control over their identity data,
enhancing privacy. National IdM solutions utilising smart-
cards, such as the Austrian Citizen Card and the German eID,
exemplify this model. During authentication, the necessary
identity information is retrieved from the user’s domain and
forwarded to the requesting service provider.
Recent advancements include the concept of Self-Sovereign
Identity (SSI), where users have sole control over their cre-
dentials [17] [10]. SSI reduces reliance on central authorities
by utilising distributed ledgers among multiple IdPs within a
circle of trust for registering new credentials. Initiatives like
the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) [18]
and Veramo [19] embody this model. These developments
reflect a trend towards user-controlled identity data and have
attracted attention from policymakers, as evident in the Eu-
ropean Commission’s proposal for a new European Digital
Identity.
The OpenWallet Foundation (OWF) has emerged as a new
opportunity in the realm of digital wallets [20]. Established
under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation Europe, OWF
aims to develop open-source software that facilitates interop-
erability across a broad spectrum of wallet applications [21].
These applications encompass various use cases, including
payments, identity verification, and the secure storage of
validated credentials.
B. Federated Services
The concept of a federated catalogue plays a vital role in
identity management by facilitating the discovery and access
to various services through a centralised repository [6]. In a
federated catalogue model, multiple catalogues collaborate and
share information about available services, creating a unified
and comprehensive resource for users [22]. This collaborative
approach allows users to search, browse, and access services
from different providers using a single interface, streamlining
the process of service discovery.
Inter-catalogue synchronisation is a critical aspect of fed-
erated catalogues. It ensures that information about services,
including their availability, descriptions, and attributes, re-
mains up-to-date and consistent across different catalogues.
Through inter-catalogue synchronisation mechanisms, updates
and changes made in one catalogue can be propagated and
reflected in others, maintaining data integrity and ensuring
accurate and real-time information for users. This synchro-
nisation process enables a seamless user experience, where
users can rely on the federated catalogue to provide reliable
and consistent information about services.
The integration of wallets with federated catalogues intro-
duces an additional layer of functionality and convenience to
identity management [23]. Wallets, which store and manage
users’ digital identities and associated credentials, can interact
with federated catalogues to enhance the service discovery and
access process. When a user accesses the federated catalogue
through their wallet, the wallet can authenticate the user and
provide relevant identity information to the catalogue. This
interaction enables personalised service recommendations, tai-
lored search results, and seamless authentication and authori-
sation processes, ultimately enhancing the user experience and
security.
Federated services and federated catalogues are closely in-
tertwined concepts in identity management. Federated services
rely on federated catalogues to provide a centralised and
comprehensive view of available services, allowing users to
discover and access services using a single digital identity. The
collaboration between service providers and catalogues within
a federated model streamlines identity management processes,
as the catalogue acts as a trusted intermediary, enabling au-
thentication, authorisation, and seamless information exchange
between users and service providers [24].
III. REQUIREMENTS FOR IDENTITY WALLETS FOR
FUTURE CLOUDS
As cloud computing continues to shape the digital land-
scape, effective identity management becomes paramount to
ensure secure and seamless access to cloud services. In this

section, we delve into the categorisation of identities required
for different cloud services, discuss their unique requirements
and characteristics, explore the future requirements for digi-
tal wallets and federated identity management in the cloud,
identify potential challenges in implementing identity wallets
for future clouds, and highlight the potential benefits of using
digital wallets for identity management in the cloud.
Categorising identities according to their usage in different
cloud services provides a comprehensive understanding of the
diverse identity landscape. These identities can be broadly
classified into user identities, service identities, and device
identities. User identities represent individuals accessing cloud
services, service identities are associated with specific cloud
services or applications, and device identities pertain to the
authentication and authorisation of devices interacting with
cloud resources. Each identity category has distinct require-
ments and characteristics that must be considered to ensure
effective identity management.
R1: Secure storage of identity-related data: In the context
of cloud services, it is crucial to securely store identity and
identity-related information. This requirement ensures that
sensitive data associated with user identities, service identi-
ties, and device identities is stored in a protected manner,
safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of the data.
R2: Effective management of identity-related data: Man-
aging identity-related data in the cloud encompasses various
functionalities. These include the ability to select, remove, and
review identity data stored within the cloud environment, as
well as the capability to choose which identity data should be
shared outside the cloud. Such management ensures that users
have control over their stored information, promoting privacy
and data control.
R3: Secure sharing of identity-related data: Enabling the
secure sharing of stored identity-related data outside the cloud
is a critical requirement for cloud-based identity management.
This involves establishing secure communication channels
and protocols for sharing identity data with trusted entities,
ensuring that data integrity and confidentiality are maintained
during the sharing process.
R4: Secure storage of cryptographic material: As the
cloud environment handles digital identities, it becomes essen-
tial to securely store cryptographic material related to digital
identity. This requirement focuses on the need to protect
cryptographic elements, such as keys and certificates, ensuring
their confidentiality and preventing unauthorised access.
R5: Combining identity data before sharing: In the
cloud context, the requirement to combine identity data be-
fore sharing aligns with the concept of selective disclosure.
Users should have the ability to selectively share identity
data, combining relevant information based on specific sharing
requirements. This ensures privacy and controlled sharing of
identity-related data.
The use of digital wallets for identity management in the
cloud offers a range of benefits. Digital wallets enhance user
convenience by providing a centralized platform for managing
identities across multiple cloud services. They bolster security

through secure authentication mechanisms, robust encryption
of identity data, and efficient access control. Moreover, digital
wallets empower users by giving them control over their
personal information and the ability to selectively share it
with trusted entities. The integration of digital wallets with
federated identity management further streamlines identity
management processes, enabling seamless access to cloud
resources and promoting interoperability.
In this context, Table I provides a comprehensive compar-
ison between different digital wallets based on their identity
management (IdM) capabilities and wallet requirements. This
table serves as a valuable reference for understanding the
strengths and features of various digital wallet solutions in
relation to identity management. It highlights key factors such
as authentication mechanisms, encryption techniques, access
control capabilities, and user control features. By referring
to Table 1, readers can gain insights into the specific char-
acteristics and functionalities of each digital wallet, aiding
in the selection of an appropriate solution for their identity
management needs.
IV. ACCESS MANAGEMENT AND CATEGORISING
IDENTITIES FOR CLOUD SERVICES
In the realm of cloud computing, it is crucial to consider
the security and privacy requirements of different types of
cloud services. In this section, we introduce a categorisation
scheme that classifies cloud services based on their security
and privacy requirements. We then explore how different types
of identities can be mapped to each category, considering
their respective security and privacy features. Furthermore, we
provide practical examples to illustrate how this categorisation
scheme can guide the selection of the appropriate identity type
for a given cloud service.
The categorisation scheme for cloud services is designed
to capture the varying degrees of security and privacy re-
quirements across different service types. We propose a three-
tier categorisation: low-security services, moderate-security
services, and high-security services as shown in Figure 1.
Low-security services typically involve non-sensitive data and
require minimal protection measures. Examples include pub-
licly accessible websites or public information repositories.
Moderate-security services handle moderately sensitive data,
such as personal information or internal organisational docu-
ments. High-security services, on the other hand, handle highly

sensitive data, such as financial records or health information,
and demand stringent security measures.
Mapping different types of identities to each category is
vital to align the level of security and privacy features with
the corresponding cloud service. For low-security services,
simple user identities, such as usernames and passwords, may
be sufficient for authentication and access control. However,
moderate-security services may require stronger authentication
mechanisms, such as two-factor authentication or biometrics,
to enhance security. High-security services necessitate even
more robust identity types, such as digital certificates or
hardware tokens, to ensure the highest level of protection and
privacy for sensitive data.
To illustrate the practical application of this categorisation
scheme, let us consider an example. Suppose a cloud ser-
vice involves a public-facing web application that provides
access to general information about a company. Based on the
categorisation scheme, this service would fall under the low-
security category. Consequently, a simple user identity, such as
a username and password, would be sufficient to authenticate
users and manage access to the service. However, if the
same company offers a cloud-based Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) system that handles customer data, the
service would be classified as a moderate-security service.
In this case, a stronger identity type, such as two-factor
authentication or biometrics, would be necessary to ensure the
security and privacy of customer information.
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, digital wallets and federated services offer
significant advantages in digital identity management. Digital
wallets provide a secure and convenient way for users to store
and manage their digital assets, simplifying the management
of digital identities while enhancing security and privacy. The
emergence of different identity management models, including
federated and user-centric approaches, along with advance-
ments like Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), empower users with
greater control over their credentials. Projects like Gaia-X
exemplify the aim to give users increased control over their
personal information and foster innovation in the digital realm.
Moving forward, future research should focus on integrating
emerging technologies such as blockchain and decentralised
identity systems to further enhance the security and privacy of
digital wallets and federated services. Additionally, exploring
the usability and user experience aspects of these solutions can
drive their adoption and acceptance among users. Continued
efforts in research and development will contribute to address-
ing the complex challenges of digital identity management and
ensure its importance in today’s digital era.
