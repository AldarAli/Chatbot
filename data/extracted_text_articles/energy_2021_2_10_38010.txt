Abstract—In 2019, the most polluting power station in the
Balearic Islands was partially closed down, marking the end of
coal as the main energy source in the territory. In this work,
we analyze the differences in the statistics of ﬂuctuations of the
electrical frequency before and after the closure.

I. INTRODUCTION
Stable power grid operation is based on the continuous
balance between supply and demand. This balance is not trivial
due to the lack of large-scale storage capacity and the intrinsic
ﬂuctuations of (part of) the demand. If demand exceeds gener-
ation, the grid frequency reduces, while if generation exceeds
demand, it increases. Thus, studying frequency ﬂuctuations is
a good proxy to analyze the power grid stability.
Nowadays, balance is achieved by adapting in real time the
generated power to the demand, which can only be achieved
using controllable energy sources. Besides being controllable,
conventional power plants play a key role in grid stability.
They provide primary and secondary control, which compen-
sate frequency deviations from the reference frequency, and
they incorporate large inertia to the grid, which damps fast
ﬂuctuations.
The need to urgently address the effects of climate change
and the dependency of the energy sector on hydrocarbon
resources is accelerating the transition towards sustainable
and renewable energies. A ﬁrst step in this transition implies
the progressive closure of the most contaminating power
plants, such as those based on coal, whose role is taken
over by cleaner conventional energy sources, e.g., natural gas.
Subsequent steps imply a progressive reliance on variable
renewable energy sources to generate electricity, together with
a larger degree of electriﬁcation of the industrial, commercial,
transportation and domestic sectors [1].
The energy transition is particularly pressing on islands,
whose energy supply typically depends on imported fossil fu-
els and submarine connections to mainland or nearby islands,
which increases generation costs [2]. Given their typically
small size and limited inter-connectivity, islands have less
robust power grids compared to the mainland. In turn, they
are prone to more frequent failures. Moreover, many islands
rely on tourism as their main economic activity, thus they are
subject to seasonal changes of population and large demand
variations. Therefore, replacing conventional with renewable
generation in these territories requires speciﬁc analysis of
their operational challenges [3]. In the case of the Balearic
Islands, the energy transition has led to the partial close down
of its coal ﬁred power plant. We base our analysis on the
grid frequency statistics, as has been considered for several
locations [4]. Here, we focus on the effect that the replacement
of coal has had on this statistics.
The paper is structured as follows. Section II introduces
the Balearic grid as our case study. Section III presents the
two data sets which will be used. Sections IV and V analyze
frequency ﬂuctuations in the absence and presence of coal
generation, respectively. Section VI discusses the presence of
threshold-like frequency control. Finally, Section VII, sum-
marises the concluding remarks of our study.
II. THE BALEARIC GRID
The Balearic Islands are a Spanish archipelago located in
the Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian
Peninsula. Their high-voltage power grid can be mapped down
to substation level as a network of 61 nodes and 88 links dis-
tributed across its four largest islands, i.e., Mallorca, Menorca,
Ibiza, and Formentera [5]. This includes 6 conventional power
plants, which we summarize in Table I, and the 3 Alter-
nating Current (AC) submarine interconnections of Menorca-
Mallorca, Mallorca-Ibiza, and Ibiza-Formentera. Moreover,
Mallorca has a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) subma-
rine connection to mainland that provides around 30% of the
total demand [6].
The AC connections among the different islands ensure the
synchronous operation of the Balearic grid. Since the line with
mainland is DC, the Balearic grid operates asynchronously
with respect to European continental grid.
Although islands only account for a small fraction of global
greenhouse gas emissions, they are one of the most vulnerable
territories to the effects of climate change. The Balearic Islands
are no exception. For this reason, in 2019, the electric utility
company Endesa, the Balearic and the Spanish Government
reached an agreement to close down 2 out of the 4 coal
generating units of Es Murterar [7], the most polluting power
station in Mallorca.
Besides the close down, they also limited the amount of
operation time of the two remaining units to 1500 hours

per year until 2021. After that, the number of hours will be
reduced to 500 per year until the complete close down of the
power plant, which will coincide with the activation of a new
connection to mainland. These measures were taken in order
to decrease emissions, as a step in the decarbonization agenda
[8]. Nowadays, the main technology types in the archilepago
are combined cycle, gas turbines, and diesel engines.
III. DATA
Frequency data measured every second is obtained from the
open database [9] [4]. The database includes measurements
from October 2019 until December 2020, except the months
of August and October 2020. The data was taken at a single
location in the island of Mallorca, and we assume that the grid
frequency is the same in the other islands.
We also make use of data publicly available on the web
site of Red El´ectrica de Espa˜na (REE) [10], the Spanish
grid operator, who is responsible for maintaining the demand-
supply balance under speciﬁc power quality conditions. In
particular, for the case of the Balearic Islands, they provide
the overall demand and generated power averaged over 10
minutes, as well as the power arriving from mainland Spain
through the HVDC line. Generation is disaggregated by power
plant technology.
IV. ANALYSIS OF FREQUENCY FLUCTUATIONS
Frequency ﬂuctuations illustrate supply-demand unbalances,
which are a result of the unpredictable load changes. Accord-
ing to Spanish legislation [11], the reference frequency for the
power grid is 50 Hz and the statutory operational limits are
between 49.85 and 50.15 Hz.
Since we have access to both frequency and power data, the
ﬁrst step in our study is to simply compare these two data sets.
In Figure 1, we show the comparison for one day in January
2020, when there was no coal generation. In the upper panel,
we have the 10-minute power data for demand and generation
disaggregated by technology, and in the lower panel, we have
the 1-second frequency data.

Figure 1. Time evolution of the demand and generation (a) and frequency
ﬂuctuations (b) on January 26, 2020, a day in which there was no coal gen-
eration. On panel (a), generation is disaggregated by power plant technology,
including the HVDC connection to mainland. On panel (b), the dotted lines
indicate the statutory operational limits, i.e., (50.00 ± 0.15) Hz. Panel (c)
shows the moving standard deviation of the frequency calculated using a 10
minute sliding window.
The ﬁrst point that we notice is the overall behavior of
the frequency, which follows the daily pattern of the demand.
During the ﬁrst hours of the day, the frequency is above 50
Hz indicating an excess of generation. Since the demand is
decreasing, so is the generation. However, the generation runs
a bit behind because it is a response to the changes in the
demand, hence the excess.
Early in the morning, the decrease rate of the demand slows
down, which brings the frequency near its nominal value.
In other words, the generation closely matches the demand.
However, at some point, the demand starts increasing, which
causes a lack of generation and makes the frequency drop
below 50 Hz. Then, we could follow the same reasoning
throughout the rest of the day to see how the slow changes in
power are linked to the grid frequency.
Nonetheless, there are also fast power variations, which are
naturally responsible for the fast frequency ﬂuctuations. We
are referring to the stochastic changes in the demand caused by
consumers. Although these changes are not recorded in the 10-
minute power data, they can be seen in the frequency data by

looking at the thickness of the curve. This is further evidenced
in panel (c) which shows the frequency volatility measured by
the moving standard deviation σ10 evaluated using a sliding
time window of duration 10 minutes. As expected, we notice
the difference between daytime and nighttime, when there is
less frequency volatility because consumers are asleep.
Besides the random ﬂuctuations of the demand, there can
also be large deterministic events. These can be both demand
or generation power changes induced by a unique and some-
times anomalous cause. In Figure 1, we can see that this is
the case of the step-like changes in the power provided by
the HVDC connection between Mallorca and mainland Spain,
which cause large frequency changes visible in panel (b), also
reﬂected as large peaks in the moving standard deviation σ10
(panel (c)). In fact, most of the large frequency changes in
that day can be identiﬁed with changes in this power line.
The size of these large frequency shifts depends, of course,
on the power imbalance, but it also depends on the amount of
control available in the power plants operating at that particular
moment. It should be noted that during low load hours the
system is more susceptible due to the decrease in conventional
generation, which affects the inertial response. Therefore, a
HVDC power change in the morning can have a different
impact on the system than if the same variation happened at
night.
Figure 2. Rank distribution of the absolute value of the frequency ﬂuctuations
on January 26, 2020, when there was no coal generation and the energy mix
was dominated by CCGT.
In order to characterize the frequency ﬂuctuations, we can
use the rank size distribution. We evaluate ∆ωk ≡ ωk − ωR,
where ωR is the reference frequency (50 Hz), reorder the set
of values |∆ωk| from the smallest to the largest value, and
ﬁnally estimate the complementary cumulative distribution of
the deviations as R(|∆ωi|) = 1−(i−1)/(M −1), where M is
the number of data points. R(|∆ω|) measures the probability
to have a frequency ﬂuctuation of size larger than |∆ω|. In
Figure 2, we plot the result. We see that frequency variations
from the nominal value stay below 0.1 Hz, which we could
already see in Figure 1b. Moreover, the shape of the curve
shows a smooth decay in the probability of having large
ﬂuctuations. In other words, the frequency tends to stay close
to its nominal value, and large deviations are highly unlikely.
V. COAL GENERATION AND FREQUENCY FLUCTUATIONS
As we indicated in Section II, the year 2019 marked the
end of coal as the main source of power generation in the
Balearic Islands. In Figure 3, we plot the daily average power
generated from coal (panel a) and from CCGT (panel b) in
2019 and 2020.

To better appreciate the changes in the energy mix disre-
garding the seasonal variations in demand, we plot in Figure
4 the percentage of generation covered by the different gen-
eration technologies in 2019 (panel a) and 2020 (panel b).
We can see that coal generation has been replaced by natural
gas (combined cycle), which is a less polluting fossil fuel.
However, during certain periods of 2020, coal was still used for
electricity generation. In fact, it represents a very substantial
part of the energy mix on these periods.

In Figure 5, we plot the demand and generation disaggre-
gated by power plant technology (panel a), the grid frequency
(panel b), and the frequency volatility (panel c) for a typ-
ical day in 2019, when there were no restrictions to coal
generation. Looking at panel (b), we observe large frequency
deviations, specially compared to those in Figure 1b. In fact, it
is clear that the frequency reaches the statutory limits of ±0.15
Hz on several occasions. The frequency volatility, as indicated
by the standard deviation σ10, is also much larger when coal
generation dominates the energy mix, as shown in panel (c)
(compare this panel with that of Figure 1). Altogether, this is
an indication that the overall control capacity of the Balearic
grid is signiﬁcantly smaller than the case shown in Figure 1.
We believe that this is simply because combined cycle power
plants have a faster and more powerful control response.

We also computed the rank distribution of frequency ﬂuc-
tuations for this case, which we show in Figure 6. Comparing
it with Figure 2, we can conﬁrm the difference in terms of
ﬂuctuation sizes, but also in the shape of the distribution. The
smooth parabolic decay that we saw in Figure 2 is not present

in Figure 6. Instead, we see a much slower linear decay of
frequency deviations up to 0.15 Hz, which is followed by a
very steep drop. This indicates that the probability to have
frequency ﬂuctuations up to 0.15 Hz is signiﬁcantly larger
than in the case considered in Figure 2. Nevertheless, the
probability to have frequency ﬂuctuations beyond the statutory
limits ±0.15 Hz is very small.
VI. DISCUSSION ON THRESHOLD-LIKE FREQUENCY
CONTROL
The behavior of the frequency ﬂuctuations displayed in
Figure 5b and Figure 6 is very peculiar. The sharp cut of
the frequency deviations at the statutory limit of 0.15 Hz is
not observed in the analysis of other power grids [4]. Besides
the cut of the frequency deviations at ±0.15 Hz, we can also
see that when the frequency reaches that value, it may remain
clamped at that value for a relatively long period of time (tens
of minutes or even more than one hour). For instance, this is
what happens around 6 PM in Figure 5, when the frequency
is kept at its upper limit for 45 minutes.
The typical control mechanisms present in conventional
power plants tend to restore the frequency back to its nominal
value and act proportionally to the frequency deviation or
depending on a smooth function of the frequency deviation.
The existence of a threshold-like value beyond which the
damping of the ﬂuctuations is much stronger is not the natural
response of these mechanisms. For these reasons, we conclude
that there must be an additional control which is activated
when the frequency deviation reaches the statutory limits
±0.15 Hz.
The effect of this threshold-like frequency control is more
noticeable in periods of coal generation, when there are larger
frequency ﬂuctuations. However, we have found that it can
also be seen when combined cycle is the main generating
technology, although in this case it happens seldomly. This
is illustrated in Figure 7 for January 30, 2020. Although there
was no coal generation, during the ﬁrst hours of the day the
frequency reached 50.15 Hz and it stayed around that value
for 2 hours. As a consequence, in this day the rank distribution
of the frequency ﬂuctuations has a sharp drop at |∆ω| = 0.15
Hz, as shown in Figure 8.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
We have analyzed the frequency ﬂuctuations recorded in the
Balearic power grid. We have seen that the partial close down
of its coal ﬁred power plant in 2019, being replaced by CCGT,
has lead to signiﬁcant reduction of the frequency ﬂuctuations.
Nowadays, CCGT is the main generating technology during
large part of the year. However, coal can still be used for
electricity generation. On the periods of time in which this
is the case, the frequency is more volatile and has larger
ﬂuctuations.
In Figure 9, we compare the rank size distribution of fre-
quency variations for a three-months period in which coal was
the main energy source (red) with a similar period where it was
replaced by CCGT (blue). There is a clear difference between
the two scenarios. When there is coal generation, we observe
a similar shape to that in Figure 6, with a roughly power-law
decay up to 0.15 Hz followed by a sharp decrease all the way
down to cumulative probabilities of the order of 10−6. This
sharp decay is associated to the activation of threshold-like
frequency control, which happens quite frequently for periods
of time in which coal is the main component of the energy
mix. The sharp decay is followed by another power-law decay
for ﬂuctuations larger than 0.2 Hz, which was not visible on
Figure 6 since it is associated to very rare events not present
on the particular day of the ﬁgure.
Figure 9. Rank distribution of frequency deviations measured from October
to December 2019 (red), and from January to March 2020 (blue).
When there is no coal generation, the shape of the distribu-
tion decays faster than power law for |∆ω| < 0.10 Hz. This
fast decay is followed by a practically horizontal plateau up
to 0.15 Hz which indicates that there are very few ﬂuctuations
of that size. This is what we saw in Figure 8, and it has to
do with the fact that the frequency stays within (49.9, 50.1)
Hz most of the time. However, larger frequency variations
can occur as illustrated in Figure 7b, where the frequency
goes up to 50.15 Hz and, after some time, it jumps back
down to a point closer to its nominal value. The point is
that it spends very little time in the range (50.10, 50.15) Hz,
which is why the size distribution is ﬂat around those values.
Once the frequency ﬂuctuations reach 0.15, the threshold-like
mechanism is activated, albeit this happens seldomly when
there is no coal generation and the energy mix is dominated
by CCGT, leading to a sharp decay in the rank distribution.
Finally, the power-law tail associated to ﬂuctuations larger than
0.2 Hz is still present but its probability is lower than in the
case of coal-dominated generation mix.
To further illustrate the differences in the frequency statistics
when coal or CCGT are the main generation source, in Figure
10, we plot the probability density function for the daily time
series that we have analyzed in Figures 1, 5, and 7. TABLE

II shows the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of these
data sets. The data set in Figure 1 has the mean closest to
50 Hz, and the smallest variance, indicating that frequency
ﬂuctuations are smaller than for the other cases. This data set
has also the most symmetric distribution (smallest skewness).
Nonetheless, as we can see in Figure 10 and with a skewness of
0.09, the data in Figure 5 can also be considered symmetric. In
contrast, the data set in Figure 7 is highly skewed to the right.
This is due to the fact that the frequency ﬂuctuates around its
reference value for most of the time, except during the two
hours where it stays in the limit 50.15 Hz. For the kurtosis,
we have to compare it to that of the normal distribution, i.e.,
3. We see that Figure 1 is platykurtic (less than 3) and Figure
7 is leptokurtic (greater than 3). Therefore, in the former, the
probability of large events is smaller than in the Gaussian
distribution, while it is larger in the latter.

Moreover, we plot in Figure 11 the probability density func-
tion of the frequency ﬂuctuations obtained from sampling the
frequency every second during a three-months measurement
period. The probability distribution for the coal-dominated
period (red) shows a much longer tail than the one for the
CCGT-dominated period. As a consequence, while frequency
deviations between 0.10 and 0.15 Hz are quite probable for
the former case, they are very rare for the last one.
Finally, we have also seen that there is clear evidence of
a threshold-like frequency control in addition to the typical
control mechanisms operating in conventional power plants.
This additional control is activated when the frequency devia-
tion reaches the statutory limits ±0.15 Hz, strongly damping
deviations beyond this threshold. Its effect can be seen in the
frequency time series (Figure 5 and Figure 7), and also as a
steep cut in the rank size distribution (Figure 9).
