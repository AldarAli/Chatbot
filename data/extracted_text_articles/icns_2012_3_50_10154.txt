Abstract—The issue of power consumption in wireless net-
works is becoming increasingly important due to the rapid
development of various wireless devices such as sensors, smart-
phones, and tablet PCs. The IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard
deﬁnes multiple data transmission protocols, each of which has
various characteristics such as power consumption, data rate,
modulation method, and transmission distance. Therefore, it is
important to choose the optimal data rate in terms of power
consumption as well as throughput, especially when consider-
ing data transmission over multi-hop networks. In this paper,
we present a mathematical analysis of power consumption in
data transmission over IEEE 802.11-based wireless multi-hop
networks to investigate the effect of data rate selection on power
consumption. The analysis results show that there are some
situations where a low data rate should intentionally be selected
in order to minimize power consumption. Our analysis indicates
that power consumption can be decreased by up to 13% when
the symbol error rate is comparatively small.
Index Terms—IEEE 802.11; wireless multi-hop networks; power

I. INTRODUCTION
Internet access via wireless networks has become very
popular due to the rapid development of the wireless devices.
These devices are mostly battery-driven, and wireless com-
munication accounts for around 10% to 50% of their total
power consumption [1-3]. Therefore, decreasing the power
consumption in wireless communication is an important issue,
especially when considering wireless multi-hop networks such
as sensor networks and wireless mesh networks in which
energy efﬁciency is essential. In this paper, we focus on
the power consumption in wireless multi-hop networks based
on IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN (WLAN), which is the most
popular for implementing wireless multi-hop networks.
The IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard has multiple data rates
that can be used, each of which has various characteristics
such as modulation method, maximum transmission distance,
and power consumption. Many rate adaptation algorithms have
been proposed in the literature, such as automatic rate fallback
(ARF) [4], receiver-based auto rate (RBAR) [5], and adaptive
ARF (AARF) [6]. In ARF and AARF, each sender attempts
to use a higher transmission rate after a ﬁxed number of
successful transmissions at a given rate and switches back to a
lower rate after some consecutive failures. RBAR requires to

change some MAC control frames and include a new header
ﬁeld. However, these algorithms are designed for maximizing
the throughput of applications and they do not focus on
energy efﬁciency. In addition, these existing algorithms do not
consider multi-hop networks. On the other hand, the authors
in [7-10] present the mathematical analysis on the power
consumption in data transmission over WLAN. However, those
analyses do not take multi-hop networks into account.
In wireless communication, in general, when a node lowers
its transmission power, the transmission distance becomes
shorter, resulting in a reduction in power consumption. How-
ever, when considering wireless multi-hop network, a shorter
transmission distance may increase the total power consump-
tion, since the shorter transmission distance requires greater
node density and increases the hop count between a sender and
a receiver, as shown in Figure 1. Using a higher data rate can
decrease the air time of a packet, which may in turn decrease
power consumption. However, a higher data rate generally
has a shorter maximum transmission distance, and thus may
increase the hop count for data transmission. Note that such
an increase in hop count would lower energy efﬁciency, since
the number of packet transmissions would rise.
In addition, some data rates in IEEE 802.11 WLAN em-
ploy different modulation methods, which may affect energy
efﬁciency. In general, a modulation method used at a higher
data rate can transmit more bits per transmitted symbol, but
may result in a higher symbol error rate in a poor wireless

environment due to noise and interference. A higher symbol
error rate would then increase frame losses and retransmis-
sions, lowering energy efﬁciency.
The complicated situations described above warrant special
attention when considering the energy efﬁciency of wireless
multi-hop networks. Therefore, in this paper, we present a
mathematical analysis of power consumption in data trans-
mission over IEEE 802.11-based wireless multi-hop networks.
In particular, we consider the detailed behavior of the carrier
sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
method, and the complicated trade-off relationships described
above. We show numerical examples of the analysis based on
the speciﬁcations of an existing WLAN interface device and
clarify the effect of data rate on energy efﬁciency in wireless
multi-hop networks. In particular, we show that there are
some situations where a low data rate should be intentionally
selected in order to minimize power consumption.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we describe our mathematical analysis of power consumption
in data transmission over IEEE 802.11 wireless multi-hop
networks. In Section III, we show numerical examples of the
analysis and discuss the effect of data rate selection on energy
efﬁciency. Finally, in Section IV, we give our conclusions and
discuss directions of future research.
II. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS
In the analysis, we assume a CSMA/CA MAC with
RTS/CTS. There are multiple data rates that can be used
in IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard, each of which is different
in terms of transmission power, transmission distance, and
modulation method. Therefore, the distance of one hop has
a large impact on energy efﬁciency when data are transmitted
over a multi-hop network.
Figure 2 shows the network model for the analysis. The
network has a linear topology, where data are transmitted from
a sender (node s) to a receiver (node d), which are separated
by distance L. ri (i = 1, 2, ...) is a relay node located
between the sender and receiver. For simplicity, we do not
consider the effects of radio wave interference and overhearing
on power consumption. The number of hops between the
sender and receiver is determined when we choose the distance
for one-hop transmission. In other words, when the one-hop
transmission distance is D, the number of hops between the
sender and receiver becomes ⌈L/D⌉. This corresponds to the
situation where we have an inﬁnite number of relay nodes
between the sender and receiver and we can select some of
them to be used according to the transmission distance, as
shown in Figure 2. Under this assumption we can explicitly
evaluate the effect of data rate and its characteristics on the
energy efﬁciency of multi-hop networks.
In Section II-A, we explain the detailed behavior of
CSMA/CA in IEEE 802.11 WLAN. In Section II-B, we
describe the power consumption of one-hop transmission of
a single data frame between two relay nodes, and in Sec-
tion II-C, we analyze multi-hop transmission of a total data
whose size is SDAT A in Section II-C.
A. Frame exchange with CSMA/CA with RTS/CTS
Let us ﬁrst look at one-hop data transmission. Figure 3
illustrates the frame exchange in the data transmission from
ri to ri+1 by CSMA/CA with request to send/clear to send
(RTS/CTS). Figure 3(a) shows the case where no frame loss
occurs, and Figure 3(b) shows the case where successive frame
losses occur.
As shown in Figure 3(a), when a transmission demand
occurs at ri, it transmits an RTS command frame to ri+1
after a distributed coordination function (DCF) interframe
space (DIFS) and a random backoff (BO1). Then, ri+1 waits
for a short interframe space (SIFS) and transmits a CTS
command frame to ri. When ri receives the CTS command
frame, it begins to transmit a data frame after an SIFS.
After ri+1 ﬁnishes receiving the data frame, it transmits an
acknowledgment (ACK) frame to ri after an SIFS. When ri
receives the ACK frame from ri+1, the transmission of one
data frame is completed.
In Figure 3(b), when ri+1 fails to receive a data frame from
ri, it does not transmit an ACK frame to ri. In this case, ri
waits a retransmission time out (RTO) and retransmits the data
frame after a DIFS and a random backoff (BO2). This cycle
continues until the data frame successfully reaches ri+1 . Note
that BOj in Figure 3(b) is the random backoff for the (j−1) th
retransmission of the data frame. In the analysis, we assume
that RTS, CTS, and ACK frames are never lost in the entire
data transmission process.
B. Power consumption in one-hop data transmission
Based on the behavior shown in Section II-A, we calculate
the power consumption in one-hop transmission of a single
data frame. We denote the total size of the data to be
transmitted as SDAT A and the size of one data frame as Sf.
Then, the number of data frames to be transmitted, nf, is
calculated as
nf =
SDAT A

The value of l is different in each modulation method. For
example, l = 1 in binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and l = 2
in quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). Note that a single
symbol error corresponds to multiple bit errors when l > 1.
In the numerical evaluations in Section III, we treat the symbol
error rate as the probability that a transmitted symbol is not
received successfully. We then assume that a loss of a data
frame occurs due to one or more bit errors when the frame
is transmitted from ri to ri+1. By denoting the symbol loss
rate as ps, the probability with which a data frame fails to be
transmitted successfully, is
pf

1 − (1 − ps)ns.

Next, we examine the backoff time (BOj in Figure 3(b)).
The backoff time is a waiting period before a data frame is
transmitted to prevent collisions between multiple transmitting
nodes. The length of the backoff time is determined at random

Tslot. The value of CW varies according to the number of
successive retransmissions. The value of CW for the backoff
time at the j th retransmission, CWj, is calculated as

III. NUMERICAL EVALUATION
A. Parameter settings
We set the distance L between the sender and receiver to
1000 [m] and the total data size SDAT A is set to 100 [Kbytes].
As the parameters for determining the backoff time in Equa-
tion (11), we set m = 10 and CWmin = 15. The parameter
α in Equation (17) is set to 2. Frame sizes and physical-
layer overhead are listed in Table II(a), and IEEE 802.11
parameters are shown in Table II(b). TRT O is set at ﬁve times
the round trip time (RTT), according to the implementation of
FreeBSD [13]. RTT, which is shown in Figure 3, is calculated
based on frame size and data rate by ignoring the propagation
delay between relay nodes. We utilize the speciﬁcations shown
in Table II for a Cisco Aironet IEEE 802.11a/b/g Wireless
CardBus adapter [14] for the maximum transmission distance
and corresponding power of each data rate.
B. Numerical results and discussions
Figure 4 shows the power consumption for various data
rates as a function of symbol error rate when we set the
transmission power to 20 [mW]. Here, we assume that the
symbol error rate remains unchanged when we change the
data rate. We can see from this ﬁgure that power consumption
can be decreased simply by using a higher data rate. This is
because the main contribution to reducing power consumption
is from the decreased air time of a packet.

When we consider the transmission power conﬁguration, the
situation changes notably. In Figure 5, we plot the relationships
between symbol error rates when we use a 6 [Mbps] data
rate and when we use a 11 [Mbps] data rate, for certain
transmission powers where the power consumption at the two
data rates become equal. For example, observing the plot for
79

6 [Mbps] (20 [mW]) versus 11 [Mbps] (40 [mW]), using
11 [Mbps] has smaller power consumption in the upper-left
region of the plot and 6 [Mbps] has an advantage in the lower-
right region of the plot.
One possible way to decrease the symbol error rate at a
higher data rate is to increase the transmission power. By
comparing the two curves in the graph, we can observe that
when the transmission power is increased at the 11 [Mbps]
data rate from 20 [mW] to 40 [mW], the region where the
11 [Mbps] data rate has smaller power consumption decreases
considerably. This means that we should carefully choose the
data rate and transmission power according to the symbol error
rate which is observed during the data transmission.
Finally, we show another example where we utilize a static
relation between two modulation methods. Here we assume
that QPSK consumes twice as much power as BPSK in order
to obtain a given symbol error rate [15]. In other words,
when we decrease the symbol error rate at higher data rates
we should signiﬁcantly increase the transmission power. With
consideration these characteristics, BPSK at 6 [Mbps] and
20 [mW] transmission power is compared with QPSK at
11 [Mbps] and 40 [mW] transmission power in Figure 6. Here,
when the symbol error rate is approximately 10−6 or lower,
the lower data rate gives smaller power consumption, which
is an opposite result to that in Figure 4. The reduction in
power consumption reaches about 13% when the 6 [Mbps]
data rate is chosen. This means that increasing transmission
power to decrease the symbol error rate results in increased
power consumption for total data transmission, although we
can expect a longer transmission distance and smaller hop
count with larger transmission power.
From the above results, we conclude that we should consider
various factors that affect the power consumption of data
transmission over wireless multi-hop networks.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a mathematical analysis of power
consumption in data transmission over IEEE 802.11-based
wireless multi-hop networks to investigate the effects of data
rate selection on energy efﬁciency. The analysis revealed that
power consumption can be decreased by up to 13% when the
symbol error rate is comparatively small.
For future work, we plan to consider other modulation
methods such as quadrature amplitude modulation to pro-
vide further insight into energy efﬁciency at high data rates.
Another plan for future research is to enhance the accuracy
of the analysis, by including the effects of losses of ACK,
RTS, and CTS frames, data frame collision, interference, and
overhearing.
