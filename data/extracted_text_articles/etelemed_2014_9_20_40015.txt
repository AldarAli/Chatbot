Abstract: The purpose of this study is to gain understanding of 
nursing professionals’ expectations of their roles in terms of 
communication with patients using electronic devices. A 
quantitative design was used in the study. The target group of 
the study comprised the nursing professionals who worked in 
outpatient clinics, appointments, or reception services within 
either special or primary health care in one hospital district in 
Finland. The data was collected by an electronic questionnaire 
developed for the study and was analyzed by descriptive 
statistical methods. The nursing professionals were asked to 
choose the two most important roles that they thought 
described their own role in terms of communication with 
patients using electronic devices. The alternatives given were:  
learner, advisor, collaborator, teacher and limit setter. The 
descriptions of the roles were developed in the researcher's 
(MK) earlier study. Most often the professionals chose the role 
of collaborator where they communicate with patients by 
electronic devices. The role of collaborator was chosen 102 
times. The second most common choice was advisor, which was 
chosen 64 times, while the least popular choice was the role of 
limit setter. Patient-centered care and shared decision-making 
require that professionals collaborate actively with patients. 
The findings show that the members of nursing staff estimate 
their role to be that of collaborator and so they want to be 
partners in cooperation with patients. We can assume that 
nursing professionals are ready to utilize electronic devices in 
communication in concert with patients.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Nursing 
professionals 
have 
a 
critical 
role 
in 
communication with patients in health care. They can 
provide individuals with timely, effective and appropriate 
services and assist in safeguarding patients’ rights at 
treatment facilities [1, 2].  Nurses establish a caring 
relationship where both parties work together helping 
patients to cope with their health problems [3].  
Traditionally, nurses have been seen as servants who 
follow the physician’s instructions and ensure that patients 
receive high-quality care [4]. In addition, nurses’ role has 
been that of patient advocate, promoting health by giving 
information and educating patients. A key role is to support 
the patient as an independent survivor [5].  
While nursing staff was earlier seen as information 
providers, the trend in communication and patient education 
in the 2000s has shifted towards collaboration between 
patients and professionals [6, 7]. Nurses often have the role 
of coordinator in patient care.  They are responsible for  
discussing patients’ status with the patients themselves but 
also with family members and other health care 
professionals [8]. Thus, nurses need a wide range of 
communication skills and have a variety of communication 
situation related roles.  
Reciprocity and simultaneousness are central aspects in 
communication [3]. It attempts to build a confidential and 
equal partnership between professionals and patients 
through communication [9].  
Using the Internet for seeking health information and 
electronic devices for communication has become a popular 
choice in healthcare [10]. Today, the Internet is an easily 
available tool [11] and citizens are able to be in contact with 
healthcare staff via remote connections [12]. Patients are 
interested in using electronic applications for appointments 
[13], for looking at their own patient records [14] and for 
satisfying their health information needs [15]. The use of 
different reminder messages that are transmitted via mobile 
phone is also becoming more popular [13].  
The use of modern technology, such as mobile phones 
and email, can enhance communication between patients 
and health care professionals.  It is possible that the use of 
information 
technology 
makes 
nurses’ 
work 
more 
independent. For this reason, nurses’ awareness of their

roles and skills in electronic communication will be critical 
for efficient service delivery [16].   
According to earlier studies, the use of information 
technology applications for communication requires new 
skills, roles and attitudes on the part of staff in health 
services [17]. It is clear that face-to-face communication is 
different from virtual communication [18]. It can be 
expected that cooperation with patients becomes more 
significant than before when electronic applications are used 
because the professional must be able to clarify the patient’s 
situation and needs, sometimes without eye contact [19]. It 
is not possible for the professional to perceive and interpret 
the patient’s physical reactions, expressions and gestures 
which might provide valuable additional information about 
the patient’s situation and health status [20]. However, it is 
possible 
to 
use 
videophones 
and 
other 
computer 
applications that relay images. When using these tools 
communication becomes nearly the same as face to face 
[21].  
Information technology is widely used in Finnish health 
care organizations. Electronic patient records are in 
comprehensive usage both in specialized health care and 
primary care. Its distribution covers 100% of these health 
care providers [22]. However, electronic communication is 
not as common between patients and health care 
professionals.  
In this study, communication means patient-professional 
interaction which takes place with the aid of electronic 
devices. The key is to examine nursing professionals’ roles 
in this communication from professionals’ point of view. 
Electronic devices refer to the devices which belong to the 
field of information and communication technology: 
computers, mobile phones, videophones and various 
applications (e-mail, text messages transmitted with a 
mobile phone and Internet software, electronic forms, 
Internet 
applications), 
which 
make 
electronic 
communication possible between nursing professionals and 
patients.  
When the use of electronic communication becomes 
more common in nurses’ work, it is important to examine 
how nurses experience their own roles as service providers 
by these applications. New working methods may change 
the work of nursing staff  in such a way that the changes 
must be taken into account in the training or during the job 
orientation period. 
The purpose of this study is to gain understanding of 
nursing professionals’ expectations of their roles in terms of 
communication with patients using electronic devices.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The research questions were: 
1) How do the nursing professionals experience their 
own role in electronic communication with the 
patients? 
2) Do the professionals’ experiences of their own role 
in electronic communication differ in special health 
care and primary health care? 
3) Do the experiences of different occupational 
groups regarding their own role in electronic 
communication differ from each other? 
The study is part of a wider project whose objective is to 
clarify nursing professionals’ experiences of the use of 
electronic communication in Finnish public health services.   
 
II. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
A. Design and data collection 
 
A quantitative design was used in this part of the 
project. The target group of the study (N = 567) comprised 
the nursing professionals who worked in outpatient clinics, 
appointments, or reception services within either special or 
primary health care in one hospital district on the west coast 
of Finland.  
The data was collected in spring 2012 using a 
structured questionnaire developed for the study. The survey 
was carried out in electronic form using the Webropol® 
service. The participants got the link to their personal e-mail 
and were able to answer the questions using the link. In one 
organization, the staff did not have e-mail addresses and the 
questionnaire was delivered to them as a paper version. 
The survey instrument was organized into four blocks 
of questions: a) background characteristics, b) electronic 
communication with patients, c) electronic communication 
with 
colleagues, 
d) 
nurses’ 
roles 
in 
electronic 
communication. This paper concentrates on block d; the 
findings of the other blocks will be reported elsewhere.  
In block d, the participants were asked to choose the 
two most important roles that they thought described their 
own role in terms of communication with patients using 
electronic devices. The given alternatives were:  learner, 
advisor, collaborator, teacher and limit setter. The 
descriptions of the roles were developed in the researcher’s 
(MK) earlier study which was carried out in psychiatric 
nursing (see Table 1). The study aimed to identify nurses’ 
roles in systematic patient education sessions where also 
computer-based education was used [23]. In the present 
study, the target group received a short description of the 
roles in the questionnaire.

B. Ethical considerations 
 
The data collection was authorized by the nursing or 
medical directors of the study organizations. The basic 
principles of research ethics, such as confidentiality and 
good study practices, were followed throughout the study 
[24]. The target group was informed of the purpose of the 
study and the participation of the nurses was voluntary.  
 
C. Data analysis 
 
The statistical software package SPSS for Windows 
version 20 was used to analyze the data.  Descriptive 
statistics were computed for background information on 
organization 
and 
occupational 
groups. 
Nursing 
professionals’ 
choices 
of 
their 
roles 
in 
electronic 
communication were looked at from the software using 
frequencies. Because of small sample size in some job areas 
(charge nurses, practical nurses, physiotherapists and 
occupational therapists), the groups had to be pooled for 
statistical analyses. Chi-squared tests were used to 
determine the differences in background factors between the 
professionals’ role choices. 
 
III. 
RESULTS 
 
Out of 567 eligible participants in the sampling frame, 123 
answered the questionnaire (total response rate 22%). 23% 
of the participants worked in specialized health care and 
77% in primary care. There were 34% nurses among the 
respondents, 46% were community nurses, 7% charge 
nurses, 7% practical nurses and others, and 5% were 
physiotherapists and occupational therapists. 
The participants chose the role of collaborator 102 times 
when they estimated their own role in communication with 
patients by electronic devices. The second most common 
choice was advisor’s role, which was chosen 64 times. The 
most infrequently chosen role was that of limit setter, which 
was chosen eight times. (Figure 1) 
 
 
 
Figure 1 – Nursing professionals’ roles in terms of 
communication with patients using electronic devices (F = the 
count of the choices) 
 
There were no statistically significant differences in 
professionals’ experiences of their own roles in electronic 
communication with patients between staff working in 
special health care and primary health care. (Table 2) 
Similarly, there were no differences between occupational 
groups. (Table 3) 
 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
 
Our study showed that the use of electronic devices in 
communication between nursing professionals and patients 
might not change staff roles in practice compared with face-
to-face communication. This was supported by the study 
findings showing that nurses were seen as collaborators with 
patients when they used various information sources for 
giving information to patients [6, 24]. It is clear that the use 
of electronic devices does not remove the role of advocate 
for patients from nursing professionals. Compared to 
traditional practice, possible remote services require 
different sensitivity on the part of nurses to identify patients’ 
situation and needs.  
It is traditionally thought that nursing practice requires 
close face-to-face interaction. It can therefore be natural for 
nursing professionals to tend to collaborate actively with 
patients 
instead 
of 
using 
electronic 
devices 
for 
communication. On the other hand, it can be supposed that 
nurses choose more often the role of teacher because patient 
education has a significant role in client-nurse interaction 
and it often involves actual teaching.  
However, it is clear that professionals should be ready to 
tailor their roles according to the patient’s situation. In the 
present study, some of the participants were community

nurses who worked in school health care. Their patients are 
young children, so it can sometimes be important that the 
professional takes the role of limit setter. A competent and 
expert health care professional can operate flexibly. She or 
he can recognize different situations and patients’ needs 
when electronic devices are used in communication.  
There were no differences in nursing professionals’ 
experiences of their own roles in electronic communication 
with patients between staff working in special health care 
and primary health care as distinct occupational groups. It is 
probable that nursing professionals’ work does not differ 
very much in outpatient clinics between special and primary 
health care organizations. Communication with patients is a 
significant part of nursing professionals’ work and they use 
varying roles in practice regardless of the structure of the 
organization. Perhaps the most crucial factor that may affect 
the choice of the role of nursing professionals is the 
patient’s situation.  
The study had some weaknesses. First, nursing 
personnel’s participation in the survey was not very active, 
which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The 
study was performed in one hospital district area in Finland. 
It was known that the use of electronic devices for 
communication was not very common in this area. For this 
reason, is possible that nursing staff members were not 
interested in responding to the questionnaire. It may be that 
some of the nurses did not have much experience of 
electronic communication, which is why they found it 
difficult to look at their own role in it. 
Second, the descriptions of the roles were developed in a 
systematic patient education project in the area of mental 
health nursing. Now they were tested for the first time in 
other nursing areas.  However, we have no reason to believe 
that these limitations appreciably biased the findings. The 
results are suggestive and describe the situation among the 
target group. 
Our results show that nursing professionals have 
competence to use electronic systems in various ways for 
communication with patients. Therefore, there are no 
explicit barriers to the implementation of new applications 
for daily care. It is not self-evident that new applications 
will bring immediate economic benefits and working time 
savings, but there is some evidence that they increase access 
to health care services, thus helping patients [25]. For this 
reason, is important to ensure nurses’ role and competence 
in electronic communication.  
 
V. 
 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
According to the study, nursing professionals assume 
different roles in communication with patients using 
electronic devices. Most often nursing staff members think 
of themselves as collaborators. The findings show that 
professionals estimate their role to be collaborators, and we 
can thus suppose that they want to be partners in 
cooperation with patients. Patient-centered care and shared 
decision-making requires that professionals collaborate 
actively with their patients.  
It 
seems 
that 
the 
introduction 
of 
electronic 
communication devices in health care does not cause a 
problem from the point of view of professionals’ working 
methods. The results can be used in nursing education and 
orientation to ensure nursing professionals’ abilities to 
communicate with patients using electronic devices.  
In future, it is important to investigate electronic 
communication from the patients’ perspective. It is 
necessary to find out patients’ expectations for nurses when 
services are transferred to electronic format.
