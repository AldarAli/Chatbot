Abstract—We are living in the world in which resources are 
limited compared to the traffic demands, which are increasing 
rapidly. In this environment, it is essential for the resource 
management techniques to maximize the effectiveness of the 
resource utilization. In particular, since the satellite resource 
such as on-board power, bandwidth even beam itself are 
expensive and limited due to its inherent characteristics, an 
effort to enhance the efficiency on their utilization is crucial. In 
this paper, we consider beam resource management in the N 
multi-beam 
satellite 
system. 
The 
simulation 
result 
demonstrates that the proposed scheme selecting only K(≤N) 
active beams assigning the beam power can achieve the 
increase of a total throughput compared to the non-selective 
beam allocation.

 INTRODUCTION 
A resource management is one of the parts of important 
techniques in the wireless communications. In this system, it 
is possible to achieve a improve efficiency in a volatile 
environment depending on how to manage the resources. 
Since the satellite resources such as power, bandwidth and 
the use of a spot beam are expensive and scarce, the effort to 
enhance their efficiency is crucial. And also, recently, the 
multi-beam antenna technique plays important role in the 
satellite communications as it can be flexible network 
configuration. In previous research [1]-[4], the beam power 
allocation schemes were proposed using advantages of 
parallel multi-beams which is monotonically increasing the 
capacity gain with the number of beams. In particular, 
Jihwan et al. [1] addressed the issue of long term average 
gain in terms of Shannon capacity and power efficiency. It 
emphasized the mathematical formulation and analytic 
solutions of the optimum resource allocation problem as 
well as explained the trade off problem between the total 
system capacity and fairness among all spot beams with 
traffic demands. It noted that if we want to maximize the 
total system capacity, we should allocate a fixed amount of 
power regardless the traffic demand which exceeds the 
some threshold for each beam and sacrifice the loss of 
proportional fairness. It is well known that the maximum 
total capacity can be achieved by water-filling approach [5].

scheme 
 
On the other hand, it needs to allocate more power to beam 
with higher traffic demand and channel condition to achieve 
the proportional fairness over spot beams, but loses some 
total capacity. Referring to this, we want to allocate the 
beam power and small number of K active beams among the 
N(>K) 
multiple 
beams 
which 
can 
be 
illuminated 
simultaneously to achieve more total system capacity.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the background of optimum selective beam 
allocation scheme, and presents how to give the highest 
priority to the active beam for multi-beams within a satellite 
coverage area. Section III presents simulation result to 
compare the proposed scheme with the case of non-selective 
beam allocation scheme. Finally, the conclusion is drawn in 
Section IV.

OPTIMUM SELECTIVE BEAM ALLOCATION SCHEME 
FOR MULTI-BEAM SATELLITE SYSTEM 
A. Background of K active beam selection over N multi-
beam satellite system 
Fig. 1 shows the system configuration of a multi-spot-
beam satellite selecting the active beams to allocate the 
resource. In the network, a multi-spot-beam satellite in 
geostationary orbit and an ensemble of spot beam cells are 
deployed in the network. Each spot beam has different 
traffic demand Ti and signal attenuation αi
2 by channel 
conditions. The concept of active beam selection scheme 
is to allocate the capacity Ci subject to the chosen K(<N) 
active beams.  The purpose of the beam selecting

algorithm is to maximize the effectiveness of the 
resources utilization, and then total system capacity can 
be improved. As parts of this effort, we consider to make 
the reasonable beam power allocation for each spot beam 
with different traffic demand and channel condition [1]. 
Since the real traffic is non-uniform and time is varying, 
the resource management must reflect the different traffic 
distribution and channel conditions across all spot beams. 
Using the time sharing for Gaussian broadcast channels 
[5], we can obtain the Shannon bounded beam capacity 
of Ci = W log2(1+αi
2Pi/WN0),where N0 is the noise power 
density and W is the allocated bandwidth. Pi is the beam 
power to be allocated and adjusted. In this paper, we 
mainly consider that downlink channels have the property 
of rainfall attenuation, which are slow fading events.  
 
B. The review of optimum power allocation(OPA) scheme 
As one of the metrics to evaluate the system performance 
of resource allocation over satellite downlinks, Jihwan et al. 
[1] addressed some tradeoff between different objects for 
system optimization. They derived the downlink multi-beam 
capacity optimization problem and proposed a schematic 
method. It focused on the best case when available capacity 
matches demand under the assumption of a simplified model. 
Minimization of difference between the supported capacity 
Ci and traffic demand Ti for ith beam can provide a 
reasonable objective for resource allocation, considering 
trade-off between the maximization of total capacity and the 
support of fairness among beams with traffic demand. In 
view of this, a square deviation cost function between 
capacities and traffic demands was adopted as given below.

First constraint in (2) means that the capacity allocated to 
each beam cannot exceed the traffic demand generated in 
each beam to prevent the unnecessary waste of resources. 
The condition in (3) implies the power for whole spot beams 
should be allocated within total system power and is called 
as aggregate power constraint. Applying the Lagrangian 
function as L(Pi,Λ)=∑i(Ti–Ci)2+Λ(∑iPi–Ptotal), it can obtain 
the optimum beam power profile Pi, which should satisfy as 
follow equation (4).

where Λ is a Lagrange multiplier that is determined by the 
total power constraint of (3). If Λ is a nonnegative value, it 
means that the determined bandwidth by (4) satisfies the 
constraint Ci ≤ Ti of (2).   
As we mentioned, this OPA scheme needs to allocate 
more power to beam with higher traffic demand and channel 
condition to achieve the proportional fairness among the 
spot beams, but loses some total capacity. Therefore, we 
present a proper beam selection algorithm to achieve more 
total system capacity based on OPA scheme.  
 
C. OPA with selective beam allocation scheme 
In order to derive the selective beam allocation 
algorithm, we adopt another constraint as below. 
 
iP ³ 0
                                      (5) 
 
The constraint (5) is added to see which users should be 
served with non-zero power and to consider the beam 
selecting algorithm [6]. Applying the Lagrangian function 
as L(Pi, Λ, si)=∑i(Ti-Ci)2+ Λ(∑iPi-Ptotal)+∑isi(-Pi) and 
differentiating with respect to Pi, we can derive the 
following (6).

where, Lagrangian multipliers si(≥0) are for –Pi≤0, and Λ 
for the total power constraint. The Kuhn-Tucker condition 
[7] can yield si = 0 if Pi > 0, and sj ≥ 0 if Pj = 0. First, 
applying this condition to (6), we have the si = 0 and 
∂L/∂Pi|Pi= Pi* = 0 at the optimum beam power Pi
* > 0. From 
(6), we obtain as follow.

Next, when the optimal power is 0(Pj

have the sj ≥ 0 and ∂L/∂Pj|Pj=0 = 0. Then, (6) can be

In other words, in order to select the K active beams among 
the N spot beams with traffic demand, we only need to 
investigate the value of (10) across all spot beams. Whereas 
if we look at it, we can find that the factor affecting to value 
of  (10) is only term of Tiαi
2. It can deem that the higher 
traffic demand and better channel condition for whole 
beams give the highest priority to the active beam. It can 
achieve the improvement of system capacity, but lose the 
fairness for some of the beams. We can compare the 
performance when used with beam selection algorithm in 
the next section. 
III. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
This section presents the simulation result. For the 
purpose of performance comparison, we create a simplified 
simulation model as follows. We evaluate the performance 
of beam selection scheme in an S-band GEO satellite 
channel. Also, we assume non-uniform signal attenuation αi
2 
(≤1) across each spot beam, and generate randomly for the 
simulation. Table 1 represents the system parameters used in 
our simulation model for fig. 2. 
Fig. 2 shows the capacity distributions of spot beams that are 
allocated by water-filling method and optimum power 
allocation scheme and OPA with beam selection scheme, 
respectively. It is well known that the maximum total capacity 
can be achieved by water-filling approach. As confirmed in 
Table 2, indeed, a water-filling scheme can achieve greater 
total system capacity than the conventional OPA scheme. On 
the other hand, the selective beam allocation scheme results 
in total throughput gain compared to non-selective 
allocation scheme. However, in some cases, it cannot be 
selected as active beam based on worse channel condition 
despite the beam with high traffic demand by considering 
the total system capacity (e.g., ith beams for i= 10, 14, 15, 
18, 20 in the Fig. 2). From this result, we can infer that we 
can achieve more total system capacity, but lose the fairness 
for some of the beams. In other words, we face a trade-off 
problem between the maximum total capacity and fairness 
among the spot beams.

gap between supported Ci and Ti, and can confirm that the

of this resource allocation through a comparison of the 
total sum of the gaps shown in Table 3.

considering trade-off problem between maximum total 
capacity and proportional fairness among beams with traffic 
demand by minimizing difference between beam traffic 
demands and allocated beam capacities assuming a 
simplified model and minimization problem. The simulation 
results demonstrate that the proposed beam selection 
scheme sacrifices the fairness for some of the beams, but 
nevertheless, can achieve more proportional fairness 
compared with water-filling method. In addition, it can 
achieve the best performance of total system capacity. In 
order to implement the interaction of the algorithm such as 
ACM, the practical simulation condition with weather 
impairments should be considered in future.
