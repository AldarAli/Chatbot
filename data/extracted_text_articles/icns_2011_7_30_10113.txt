Abstract— These Wireless communication systems have been 
developed to support users’ various requirements. Multicast 
scheme is proposed for various types of service. Basically, the 
group Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) level for 
multicast transmission depends on the instantaneous worst 
channel user to provide reliable communication. However, this 
causes the low bandwidth efficiency for overall system. In 
order to overcome this problem, the proposed algorithm 
considers not only MCS efficiency of groups but also available 
overall system resources. The performance evaluation shows 
that proposed algorithm reduce the overall blocking 
probability and improve the throughput and revenue 
compared with traditional minimal and Proportional Fair (PF) 
based schemes.

 INTRODUCTION 
Since wireless access technology and end user device, 
such as mobile, laptops, have been developed, user behavior 
is not restricted to using voice service by wireless device. As 
user who requests various multimedia broadcasting and 
streaming such as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) 
increase, it is important to allocate resource efficiently [1]. 
Wireless multicast transmission can be a good solution to 
reduce the resource consumption for delivering the same 
contents to user who interested in certain group [2].  
The major wireless multicast technologies used in 
various 3G/4G deployment models are Multicast Broadcast 
Service 
(MBS) 
[3] 
by 
WiMAX-The 
Worldwide 
Interoperability 
for 
Microwave 
Access, 
Multimedia 
Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) [4] by 3GPP, and 
Broadcast and Multicast Services (BCMCS) [5] by 3GPP2. 
These technologies commonly use Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (OFDM)  technology with Adaptive 
Modulation Coding (AMC) in order to provide high bit rate 
and efficiently utilize the downlink bandwidth. By 
independently managing the each user, AMC can provide 
high bandwidth efficiency in unicast transmission. However 
in multicast transmission, it is not efficient since the 
multicast group MCS level is adjusted by only a user who 
has worst channel condition in a group [2]. Therefore, 
capacity saturation can be happened as the number of users 
increase because of depending on the instantaneous worst 
channel user in multicast transmission [6]. 
In order to cope with this problem, many researchers 
have proposed schemes especially considering throughput. 
Koh and Kim suggest the PF Scheduling for multicast 
service [7]. Kang and Cho suggest the dynamic packet 
scheduling for multicast [8]. Gopala and Gamal suggest the 
policy based scheduling for multicast [9]. Although these 
schemes can enhance system throughput by selecting 
maximal MCS level, it has low cell edge performance and 
causes high blocking probability. Therefore, there is no way 
to serve cell edge users and it will be a fatal problem if 
multicast is not provided to some static users. Xu Ning and 
Viver Guilame [10] concentrate to guarantee service of users 
in cell edge by handling PF parameter. In order to analyzing 
performance, we just focus on the PF scheduling algorithm 
since PF scheduling algorithm is one prominent example of 
compromise between fairness and high system throughput 
[7]. However, the proposed scheme is not restricted by PF 
algorithm. In this paper, we propose the adaptive scheduling 
based on MCS efficiency of groups and available overall 
system resources for multicast service. It improves not only 
cell edge performance but also increase the overall 
throughput. Finally, we compare the proposed scheme with 
the conventional scheme in wireless OFDM systems. We 
also analyze and compare the system performance of PF 
scheduling based multicast transmission scheme in terms of 
overall blocking probability, throughput and revenue. The 
rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, 
proposed transmission scheme is described, and then In 
Section III, we develop the system model for analyzing 
blocking probability. The system performance between 
proposed scheme and conventional scheme are compared, 
and the system performance of the proposed scheme is 
evaluated in Section IV. Finally, conclusions are presented in 
Section V.

PROPOSED TRANSMISSION SCHEME 
Figure 1.  Multicast group partitioning (No service vs. service) 
 
In this section, we describe a problem of the conventional 
transmission schemes for multicast and propose an adaptive 
scheduling scheme. 
A. Problem statement  
According to AMC, in unicast service, high spectral 
efficiency can be achieved by selecting the highest 
modulation and coding rate with a given acceptable Bit Error 
Rate (BER) constraint. However, in the multicast case the 
transmission rate must be the minimum value of a multicast 
group. This makes system throughput performance degrade 
extremely since the overall system capacity is limited by the 
worst channel user. One possible way to improve the system 
throughput is to split the multicast group into two subgroups 
and to serve the better channel subgroup only [6-9]. Fig. 1 
shows the example how the partitioning method can improve 
the system throughput.  
Although splitting the multicast group can enhance the  
Figure 2.  Proposed transmission scheme procedure 
 
throughput, the cell-edge users are sacrificed. Therefore, it is 
important how to increase the throughput with minimizing 
cell-edge blocking probability. In this respect, it is our 
contribution to propose the efficient adaptive scheduling 
scheme for the multicast user group with considering group 
MCS efficiency and available radio resources in a cell.  
B. Proposed adaptive scheduling scheme 
In this section, we address the proposed adaptive 
scheduling scheme. The proposed transmission scheme is 
involved with two cases : sparse phase and dense phase. The 
sparse phase means that the system has enough bandwidth 
to support the worst channel users in multicast groups. On 
the other hands, the dense phase, the system has not enough 
bandwidth to support the worst channel users because many 
groups are located in a cell. Fig. 2. expresses the overall 
procedure for proposed transmission scheme.

It is known that a proportionally fair allocation should 
maximize the sum of logarithmic average user rates [2]. 
Therefore, PF scheduler maximizes sum of Rk(t) by the

  From above index l*, we can extract MCS[i] as a group

To reduce overall blocking probability in the system, PF 
scheduling group selection procedure is executed. BN is the 
number of blocking user in group i, it affects the overall 
blocking probability in the system. Finally, we consider BN 
value to choose PF scheduling group by following below 
algorithm..

can execute PF scheduling algorithm to group GPF,i which 
has minimum number of blocking users.

Therefore, in proposed adaptive scheduling scheme for 
multicast service, we concentrate to enhance multicast traffic 
efficiency. 
III. 
ANALYSIS OF TRANSMISSION SCHEME 
To analyze the proposed transmission scheme, we can 
model our proposal with Mx/M/C/C for OFDM subcarrier 
allocation system [11][12]. From the viewpoint of analytical 
purpose, we may obtain statistical average number of used 
sub-channel in MCS level. Every subcarrier has the same 
average data rate.    The number of sub-channel C generally 
denotes the system capacity in an NG cell. Because sub-
channel is contained 28 subcarriers, the cell has in total 
28CRb rate resources, where Rb represents the average data 
rate per subcarrier. In our model, minimal data requests 
limited by sub-channel not subcarriers which depend on real 
service. Therefore, a multicast service (call) can request 
multiple sub-channels to fulfill its transmission requirement. 
Hence, this case is considered as a batch (group;bulk) arrival.

distributed with the parameter μ. The system propability

The model is equivalent to the standard Erlang loss 
system [11]. Fig. 3 depicts the state-transition-rate diagram 
of the model. Red circle means that there is possibility of PF 
algorithm due to lack of available bandwidth. Finally, red 
dotted line shows the PF transition rate when requested sub-

Recursive programs cannot always solve the equations, 
owing to overabundant recursive levels for large C. 
Therefore, an iterative procedure is adopted to solve the 
equilibrium equations. Let initial value P0
*=1; then other 
steady state probability value can be extracted by global 
balance equation. According to the normalizing condition 
(summation of steady state probability equals one) the 
equilibrium probabilities of all states are written as follows:

The Call Blocking Probability (CBP) of the model is 
explained in the following. Basically, PF algorithm contains 
static blocking probability that means rates of blocking users 
who don’t satisfy determined MCS level. This probability is 
expressed as PPF. Sometimes, available bandwidth can’t 
satisfy determined bandwidth which is extracted from PF 
algorithm, it is fully blocked. Finally, the CBP can contain 
two blocking cases : Fully block and Static block. Thus, the 
CBP can be expressed as

And, Throughput equation follows Erlang’s Loss Formula. 
Next, we introduce the service provider’s reward/penalty 
cost model to expect service providers’ revenue. We 
assumed that when the base station successfully serves the 
multicast service without blocking, the service provider 
receives a reward value of R. On the other hand, if a user is 
rejected, we assume that the service provider loses a value of 
L immediately [2]. 
In prior art under the resource allocation policy, for 
example, if the system on average services N client per unit 
time and reject M client per unit time, then the system 
revenue is

IV. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
Fig 4 shows the mobile terminal (MT) distribution 
example. MTs are directly mapping the MCS level by 
considering path loss in large scale fading. In this case, each 
MT requests the multicast service from BS. After requesting 
the service, each packet goes to the BS. Fig 5 illustrates the 
adaptive scheduling scheme for a packet-switched OFDM 
system. We focus on downlink transmission of multicast data 
traffic. Therefore, base station (BS) that makes scheduling 
decisions for packet transmission based on MBS capacity. 
BS can choose two scheduling method based on MBS 
capacity adaptively. At Media Access Control (MAC) layer,  
upon each packet arrival, the BS puts the packet into its 
corresponding buffer which is assumed to have infinite space. 
At Physical (PHY) layer, we assume perfect channel state 
information (CSI). With this CSI, the BS can implement 
AMC to maximize the throughput on each subcarrier [13]. In 
performance evaluation, we measure distribution of MCS 
level in worst channel user in multicast transmission and PF 
scheduling based multicast transmission. In this case, we 
consider the arrival rate has a discrete uniform distribution 
and arrival multicast user has MCS level which is uniformly 
distributed from 1 to 10. We simulate uniform distributed 
user in cell to execute min based algorithm and PF based 
algorithm. Finally, we extract PPF which is static blocking 
probability when PF algorithm used. Whole simulation 
procedure follows:  
Step1. Each user has their MCS level depend on channel 
condition. We just consider path loss in large scale fading. 
Step2. We randomly group users as multicast group. 
Step3. Apply two scheduling algorithm to each multicast 
group in same environment – PF algorithm and Min 
algorithm. 
Step4. Extract blocking probability and MCS level 
distribution. 
Finally, we assumed that total channel capacity C is 40 
and multicast streaming is 300kbps. Service rate is 0.0055 
since we just focus on ucc contents environment which have 
average 3 minutes (180 seconds) running time [12]. We 
analysis performance by using various parameters in 
simulation and numerical analysis in terms of blocking prob- 
 
ability, throughput and revenue. 
A. Call Blocking Probability by proposed adpative PF 
algorithm 
Fig. 6 (a) shows the performance comparison among the 
adaptive PF, min and PF in terms of blocking probability as 
arrival rate increase from 0.02 to 0.1 [12]. In PF algorithm, 
although arrival rate is small, it can make blocking situation, 
because it determines MCS level. As arrival rate increase, PF 
algorithm is better than min algorithm because min 
algorithm saturate faster than PF algorithm due to choose 
worst channel user. In adaptive PF, when arrival rate is low 
(unused sub-channels are enough to support requested sub-
channel), it doesn’t use PF algorithm. After arrival rate is 
high, it uses PF algorithm to enhance multicast sub-channel 
efficiently. Finally, overall blocking probability patterns 
show that adaptive scheduling enhances user blocking rates 
by adaptively choosing algorithm. It also affects cell edge 
performance since most of blocking user might be cell edge 
user in large scale fading environment. 
B. Throughput by proposed adaptive PF algorithm  
Fig. 6 (b) shows the performance comparison among the 
adaptive PF, min and PF in terms of throughput as arrival 
rate increase from 0.02 to 0.1 [12].  As result of blocking

probability, throughput shows the bandwidth utilization of 
each case. Since throughput is depend on blocking 
probability, adaptive PF ensures higher bandwidth utilization 
than min and PF algorithm based multicast. Conventional PF 
is smaller than min algorithm when arrival rate is low. As 
arrival rate is increased, conventional PF is better than min 
algorithm as shown in Fig. 5.  
C. Revenue by proposed adaptive PF algorithm 
Now we evaluate revenue of each scheme in the aspect of 
wireless service provider. In this case, we assume that 
wireless service provider provide IPTV service. Fig. 6 (c) 
shows 
the 
result 
obtained 
by 
service 
providers’ 
reward/penalty cost model. We assumed that is the base 
station successfully serves the multicast service without 
blocking, the system receives a reward value of R(=$10). On 
the other hand, if a user is rejected, we assume that the 
service provider loses a value of  
L(=$5) immediately. This figure shows that as the arrival 
rate increase, the revenue of each algorithm is slightly 
decreasing because of its blocking probability of services. In 
this case, our proposed algorithm can offer higher revenue 
than others. And PF can’t compensate within most of our 
observe point since PF algorithm contains static blocking 
probability. 
II. CONCLUSION 
Multicast transmission makes efficient utilization of sub-
channel in wireless environment. Although conventional PF 
enhance multicast channel utilization in hot-spot situation, it 
is not suitable for low arrival rate situation as our analysis. In 
OFDM environment, since multicast part in OFDM is 
dedicated, unused multicast sub-channel in certain time slot 
means inefficient resource allocation. To enhance efficiency 
of resource allocation, our proposed scheme has been 
suggested.  Our analysis have shown that adaptive 
scheduling scheme adaptively allocate sub-channel to 
multicast users depending on MBS channel capacity which is 
same as available bandwidth. As result of comparison, our 
proposed scheme guarantees more serviced users in certain 
time slot and more efficient bandwidth utilization. Since 
most of blocking users are in the cell edge, we can also 
enhance cell edge performance. Further work will extend the 
proposed scheme with considering weight factor of the 
number of users in multicast group and apply general 
scheduling algorithm.
