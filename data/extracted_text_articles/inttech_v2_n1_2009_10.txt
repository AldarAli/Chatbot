Abstract 
 
The DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting, Hand-
held) coverage area depends mainly on the area type, 
i.e. on the radio path attenuation, as well as on the 
transmitter power level, antenna height and radio 
parameters. The latter set has effect also on the audio / 
video capacity. In the detailed network planning, not 
only the coverage itself is important but the quality of 
service level should be dimensioned accordingly. 
This paper describes the SFN gain related items as 
a part of the detailed radio DVB-H network planning. 
The emphasis is put to the effect of DVB-H parameter 
settings on the error levels caused by the over-sized 
Single Frequency Network (SFN) area. In this case, 
part of the transmitting sites converts to interfering 
sources if the safety distance margin of the radio path 
is exceeded. A respective method is presented for the 
estimation of the SFN interference levels. The 
functionality of the method was tested by programming 
a simulator and analyzing the variations of carrier per 
interference distribution. The results show that the 
theoretical SFN limits can be exceeded e.g. by 
selecting the antenna height in optimal way and 
accepting certain increase of the error level that is 
called SFN error rate (SER) in this paper. 
Furthermore, by selecting the relevant parameters in 
correct way, the balance between SFN gain and SER 
can be planned in controlled way.

1. Introduction 
 
The DVB-H is an extended version of the terrestrial 
television system, DVB-T. Both are defined in the 
ETSI standards along with the satellite and cable 
versions of the DVB. 
The mobile version of DVB suits especially for the 
moving environment as it has been optimized for the 
fast variations of the field strength and different 
terminal speeds. Furthermore, DVB-H is suitable for 
the delivery of various audio / video channels in a 
single bandwidth, and the small terminal screen shows 
adequately the lower resolution streams compared to 
the full scale DVB-T. 
As DVB-H is meant for the mobile environment, 
the respective terminals are often used on a street level 
for the reception. This creates a significant difference 
in the received power level compared to DVB-T which 
uses fixed and directional rooftop antenna types. 
Furthermore, the DVB-H terminal has normally only 
small, in-built panel antenna, which is challenging for 
the reception of the radio signals. 
The DVB-H service can be designed using either 
Single Frequency Network (SFN) or Multi Frequency 
Network (MFN) mode. In the former case, the 
transmitters can be added within the SFN area without 
co-channel interferences even if the cells of the same 
frequency overlap. In fact, the multi-propagated SFN 
signals increases the performance of the network by 
producing SFN gain. 
Especially in the Single Frequency Network, the 
coverage planning is straightforward as long as the 
maximum distance of the sites does not exceed the 
allowed value defined by the guard interval (GI). The 
guard interval takes care of the safe reception of the 
multi-path propagated signals originated from various 
sites or due to the reflected radio waves. If the GI and 
FFT dependent geographical SFN boundary is ex-
ceeded, part of the sites starts to act as interferers 
instead of providing useful carrier. 
The maximum size of the non-interfered Single 
Frequency Network of DVB-H depends on the guard 
interval and FFT mode. The distance limitation 
between the extreme transmitter sites is thus possible 
to calculate in ideal conditions. Nevertheless, there 
might be need to extend the theoretical SFN areas e.g. 
due to the lack of frequencies. 
Sites that are located within the SFN area minimises 
the effect of the inter-symbol-interferences as the 
guard interval protects the OFDM signals of DVB-H,

although in some cases, sufficiently strong multipath 
signals reflected from distant objects might cause 
interferences in tightly dimensioned network. On the 
other side, if certain degradation in the quality level of 
the received signal is accepted, it could be justified to 
even extend the SFN limits.  
This paper is an extension to [1] and presents first 
DVB-H radio network dimensioning and SFN 
principles. A simulation method that was developed 
for estimating the balance of the SFN interference 
level and the SFN gain, is presented next. Case studies 
were carried out by utilizing a set of DVB-H radio 
parameters. The results shows the variations in the 
carrier per noise and interference levels, C / (N + I), in 
function of related radio parameters in over-sized SFN. 
 
2. DVB-H Dimensioning 
 
The main link budget items affecting on the dimen-
sioning of the DVB-H network are capacity and 
coverage related parameters. They also have inter-
dependencies so the final dimensioning requires 
iterative approach. 
 
2.1. Capacity Planning 
 
In the initial phase of the DVB-H network planning, 
the offered capacity of the system is dimensioned. The 
total capacity in certain DVB-H band – defined as 5, 6, 
7, or 8 MHz – does have effect also on the size of the 
coverage area. The dimensioning process is thus 
iterative, with the aim to find a balance between the 
capacity, coverage and the cost of the network. 
The capacity can be varied by tuning the 
modulation, guard interval, code rate and channel 
bandwidth. As an example, the parameter set of QPSK, 
GI ¼, code rate ½ and channel bandwidth 8 MHz 
provides a total capacity of 4.98 Mb/s, which can be 
divided between one or more electronic service guides 
(ESG) and various audio / video sub-channels with 
typically around 200-500 kb/s bit stream dedicated for 
each. The capacity does not depend on the number of 
carriers (FFT mode) but the selected FFT affects 
though on the Doppler shift tolerance. As a 
comparison, the parameter set of 16-QAM, GI 1/32, 
code rate 7/8 and channel bandwidth of 8 MHz 
provides a total capacity of 21.1 Mb/s. It should be 
noted, though, that the latter parameter set is not 
practical due to the clearly increased C/N requirement. 
The relation between the radio parameter values, 
Doppler 
shift 
tolerance 
and 
capacity 
can 
be 
investigated more thoroughly in [2]. 
2.2. Coverage Planning 
 
When the coverage criteria are known, the cell 
radius can be estimated by applying the link budget 
calculation. The generic principle of the DVB-H link 
budget can be seen in Table 1. The calculation shows 
an example of the transmitter output power level of 
2,400 W with the quality value of 90% for the area 
location, though assuming that the SFN gain does not 
exist. According to the link budget, the outdoor 
reception of this specific case yields a successful 
reception when the radio path loss is equal or less than 
140.3 dB. 
 
 
The Okumura-Hata model [3] can be applied in 
order to obtain the estimation for the cell radius (unit 
in kilometres) e.g. in large city type:

Okumura-Hata model for the large city, varying 
the transmitter power levels. 
 
In the SFN related reference material, different 
values for the SFN gain is proposed to be added to the 
DVB-H link budget, typically from 0 to 3 dB. As an 
example, [4] mentions that due to the large standard 
variation of the combined signal reception in 
environment with multi-path propagation, no SFN gain 
is recommended for the planning criteria. In the same 
document, a SFN gain of around 1.5 dB was obtained 
for the 2 transmitter case by carrying out field 
measurements. A 3-transmitter field measurement case 
can be found in [5], which shows that about 2 dB SFN 
gain was achieved. For the large amount of sites, no 
practical field results can be found due to the 
complexity of the test setup. 
Nevertheless, the possible SFN gain of, e.g., 2 dB 
would have around same effect on the coverage area 
growth as changing the 1500 W transmitter to 2400 W 
power level category, i.e. there can be an important 
cost effect in selected areas of the DVB-H network 
depending on the functionality of the SFN gain. 
3. Theory of the SFN Limits 
 
The DVB-H radio transmission is based on the 
OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex-
ing). The idea of the technique is to create various 
separate data streams that are delivered in sub-bands. 
The error correction is thus efficient as the sufficiently 
high-quality sub-bands are used for the processing of 
the received data, depending on the level of the 
correction schemes used in the transmission. 
In order to work, the system needs to minimize the 
interference levels between the sub-bands. The sub-
band signals should thus be orthogonal. In order to 
comply with this requirement, the carrier frequencies 
are selected in such way that the spacing between the 
adjacent channels is the inverse of symbol duration.  
According to [2], the GI and the FFT mode 
determinate the maximum delay that the mobile can 
handle 
for 
receiving 
correctly 
the 
multi-path 
components of the signals. The Table 2 summarises the 
maximum allowed delays and respective distances. 
The maximum allowed distance per parameter setting 
has been calculated assuming the radio signal 
propagates with the speed of light. 
 
 
 
As long as the distance between the extreme trans-
mitter sites is less than the safety margin dictates, the 
difference of the delays between the signals originated 
from different sites never exceeds the allowed value 
unless there is a strong multipath propagated signal 
present.

On the other hand, when the terminal drifts outside 
of the original SFN area and receives sufficiently 
strong signals from the original SFN, no problems 
arises either in this case as it can be shown that the 
difference of the signal delays from the respective SFN 
sites are always within the safety limits.

Figure 3. The GI applies also outside the physical 
SFN cell area where the signal level originated 
form the SFN is sufficiently high.  
 
The situation changes if the inter-site distance 
exceeds the allowed theoretical value. As an example, 
GI of 1/4 and 8K mode provide 224 µs margin for the 
safe 
propagation 
delay. 
Assuming 
the 
signal 
propagates with the speed of light, the SFN size limit is 
300,000 km/s ⋅ 224 µs yielding about 67 km of 
maximum distance between the sites. If any 
geographical combination of the site locations using 
the same frequency exceeds this maximum allowed 
distance, they start producing interference in those 
spots where the difference of the arriving signals is 
higher than 224 µs. 
If the level of interference is greater than the noise 
floor, and the minimum C/N value that the respective 
mode required in non-interfered situation is not any 
more obtained, the signal in that specific spot is 
interfered and the reception suffers from the frame 
errors that disturb the fluent following of the contents. 
In order to achieve correct reception, the additional 
interference increases the required received power 
level of the carrier to C/N → C / (N + I). 
Figure 4 shows that if the Deff, i.e. the difference 
between the signals arriving from the sites, is more 
than the allowed safety distance in over-sized SFN, the 
site acts as an interferer. Whilst the carrier per 
interference and noise level from the TX2 complies 
with the minimum requirement for the C/N, the 
transmission is still useful.

Figure 4. When the mobile station is receiving 
signals from the over-sized SFN-network, the sum 
of the interfering signals might destroy the 
reception if their level is sufficiently high 
compared to the sum of the useful carrier levels.  
 
Even if the C / (N + I) level gets lower when the 
terminal moves from one site to another, the situation 
is not necessarily critical as the effective distance Deff 
of the signals might be within the SFN limits e.g. in the 
middle of two sites, although their distance from each 
others would be greater than the maximum allowed. In 
other words, the otherwise interfering site might not be 
considered as interference in the respective spot but it 
might give SFN gain by producing additional carrier 
C2. This phenomenon can be observed in practice as 
the SFN interferences tends to accumulate primarily in 
the outer boundaries of the network. 
Figure 5 shows the principle of the relative 
interference which increases especially when the 
terminal moves away from the centre of the SFN 
network.

Figure 5. The principle of interference when the 
location of transmitter TX1 is out of the SFN limit.  
 
When moving outside of the network, the relative 
difference between the carrier and interfering signal 
gets smaller and it is thus inevitable that the C / (N + I) 
will not be sufficient any more at some point for the 
correct reception of the carrier, although the C/N level 
without the presence of interfering signal would still be 
sufficiently high. The essential question is thus, where 
the critical points are found with lower C / (N + I) 
118

value than the original requirement for C/N is, and 
where the interference thus converts active, i.e. when 
Deff is longer than the safety margin. 
As an example, the distance of two sites could be 
70 km, which is more than Dsfn with any of the radio 
parameter combination of DVB-H. For the parameter 
set of FFT 8k and GI 1/8, the safety distance for Dsfn is 
about 34 km, which is clearly less than the distance of 
these sites. Let’s define the radiating power (EIRP) for 
each site to +60 dBm. We can now observe the 
received power level of the sites in the theoretical open 
area by applying the free space loss, f representing the 
frequency (MHz) and d the distance (km):

Figure 6 shows the carrier (or interference) from

TX2 located in 70 km, when the parameter set allows 
Dsfn of 34 km. The interference is included in those 
spots where the Deff is higher than Dsfn. If the Deff is 
shorter than Dsfn, the respective received useful power 
level is shown taking into account the SFN gain of 
these two sites by summing the absolute values of the 
power levels:

Figure 6. The combined C/(N+I) along the route

gain when the interference is not present.  
 
As Figure 6 shows, the TX1 is acting as a carrier 
and TX2 as interferer from 0 km (TX1 location) to 18 
km, because the Deff > Dsfn. Nevertheless, the carrier of 
TX1 is dominating within this area in order to provide 
sufficiently high C / (N + I) for the successful 
reception for the QPSK, CR 1/2 and MPE-FEC 1/2 as 
it requires 8.5 dB. The segment of 18 km to 52 km is 
clear from the interferences as all the Deff < Dsfn, and in 
addition, the receiver gets SFN gain from the 
combined carriers of TX1 and TX2. The TX1 starts to 
act as an interferer from 52 km to 100 km (or, until the 
C/N limit of the used mode). Nevertheless, the 
interference of TX1 is already so attenuated such a far 
away from its origin that the C / (N + I) is high enough 
for the successful reception from TX2 of above 
mentioned QPSK still within the area of 80 − 100km. 
With 
any 
other 
parameter 
settings, 
the 
SFN 
interference level is high enough to affect on the 
successful reception in these breaking points where the 
Deff makes the signal act as interferer instead of carrier. 
As can be seen from this example, the interference 
level takes place when the terminal moves towards the 
boundaries or boundary sites of the network. As a 
result, the boundary site’s coverage area gets smaller, 
and depending on the parameter setting, there will be 
interferences between the sites. 
The required C/N for some of the most commonly 
used parameter setting can be seen in Table 3 [2]. The 
terminal antenna gain (loss) is taken into account in the 
presented values. The Table present the expected C/N 
values in Mobile TU-channel (typical urban) for the 
"possible" reference receiver. 
 
 
 
The FFT size has impact on the maximum velocity 
of the terminal, and the GI affects on both the 
maximum velocity as well as on the capacity of the 
radio interface. In fact, in these simulations, if only the 
requirement for the level of carrier is considered 
without the need to take into account the maximum 
functional velocity of the terminal or the radio channel 
capacity, the following parameter combinations results 
the same C/N and C / (N + I) performance due to their 
same requirement for the safety distances: 
 
• FFT 8K, GI 1/4: only one set 
• FFT 8K, GI 1/8: same as FFT 4K, GI 1/4

4. Methodology for the SFN simulations: 
first variation (unlimited SFN network) 
 
4.1. General 
 
In order to estimate the error level of various sites 
that is caused by extending the theoretical geometrical 
limits of SFN network, a simulation can be carried out 
as presented in [6]. For the simulation, the investigated 
variables can be e.g. the antenna height and power 
level of the transmitter, in addition to the GI and FFT 
mode that defines the SFN limits. 
The setup for the simulation consists of radio 
propagation type and geometrical area where the cells 
are located. The most logical way is to dimension the 
network according to the radio interface parameters, 
i.e. the cell radius should be dimensioned according to 
the minimum C/N requirement. 
For this, a link budget calculator is included to the 
initial part of the simulator. It estimates the radius for 
both useful carriers as well as for the interfering 
signals, noise level being the reference. 
Depending on the site definitions, there might be 
need to apply other propagation models as the basic 
Okumura-Hata [3] is valid for the maximum cell radius 
of 20 km and antenna heights up to 200 m. One of the 
suitable models for the large cells is ITU-R P.1546 [7] 
which is based on the interpolation of the pre-
calculated curves. 
When estimating the total carrier per interference 
levels, both total level of the carriers and interferences 
can be calculated separately by the following formulas, 
using the respective absolute power levels (W) for the 
C and I components:

In each simulation round, the site with the highest 
field strength is identified. In case of uniform network 
and equal site configurations, the site with lowest 
propagation loss corresponds to the nearest cell TX1 
which is selected as a reference. Once the nearest cell 
is identified, the task is to investigate the propagation 
delays of signals between the nearest and each one of 
the other sites, and calculate if the difference of 
arriving signals Deff is greater or lower than the SFN 
limit Dsfn. In general, if the difference of the signal 
arrival times of TX1 and TXn is greater than GI 
defines, the TXn is producing interfering signal (if the 
signal is above the noise floor), and otherwise it is 
adding the level of total carrier energy (if the signal 
level is above the minimum requirement for carrier). 
In order to obtain the level of C and I in certain area 
type, the path loss can be estimated with Okumura-
Hata radio propagation model or ITU-R P.1546. 
The total path loss can be calculated by applying the 
following formula:

fast fading as well as antenna losses. 
For the long-term fading, a normal distribution is 
commonly used in order for modelling the variations 
of the signal level. The PDF of the long-term fading is 
the following [8]:

The term x represents the loss value, and x is the 
average loss (0 in this case). In the snap-shot based 
simulations, the Lnorm is calculated for each arriving 
signal individually as the different events does not 
have correlation. The respective PDF and CDF are 
obtained by creating a probability table for normal 
distributions. Figure 7 shows an example of the PDF 
and CDF of normal distributed loss variations when 
the mean value is 0 and standard deviation is 5.5 dB.

4.2. Simulator 
 
A block diagram of the presented SFN interference 
simulator is shown in Figure 9. The simulator was 
programmed with a standard Pascal code. It produces 
the results to text files, containing the C/N, I/N and C / 
(N + I) values showing the distribution in scale of 
-50...+50 dB and with 0.1 dB resolution, using integer 
type table indexes of -500 to +500 that represents the 
occurred cumulative values. Also the terminal 
coordinates and respective C/N, I/N and C / (N + I) for 
all the simulation rounds is produced. If the value 
occurs outside the scale, it is added to the extreme dB 
categories in order to form the CDF correctly. 
A total of 60,000 simulation rounds per each case 
were carried out. It corresponds to an average of 
60,000 / (50 dB ⋅ 10) = 120 samples per C/I resolution, 
which fulfils the accuracy of the binomial distribution. 
Each text file was post-processed and analysed with 
Microsoft Excel. 
The terminal was placed randomly in 100 km × 100 
km area according to the uniform distribution in 
function of the coordinates (x, y) during each 
simulation round. The raster of the area was set to 10 
m. Small and medium city area type was selected for 
the simulations. The total C/I value is calculated per 
simulation round by observing the individual signals of 
the sites. 
 
Inputs: Geographical and simulation area, radio parameters.
Tables: Create CDF of lognormal distribution for long-term fading
and optional CDF for Rayleigh fading.
Initialisation: Calculate the single cell radius with Okumura-Hata
and place the sites on map according to the hexagonal principles.
Simulation: Place the mobile station on map. Calculate the
respective C/I levels. Repeat the simulation rounds until the
statistical accuracy has been reached.
Data storing: Save the C/I PDF and CDF distribution (-50..50 dB, 
0.1 dB resolution), coordinates of MS in each simulation round
and respective C/I value.
 
Figure 9. The simulator’s block diagram. 
 
The nearest site is selected as a reference during the 
respective simulation round. If the arrival time delays 
difference ∆t2–∆t1 is less than Dsfn defines, the 
respective signal is marked as useful carrier C, or 
otherwise it is marked as interference I. In the generic 
format, the total C / (N + I) can be obtained from the 
simulation results in the following way:

The term N represents the reference which is the 
sum of noise floor and terminal noise figure. The noise 
figure depends on the terminal characteristics. In the 
simulations, it was estimated to 5 dB as defined in [2]. 
The simulator calculates the expected radius of 
single cell in non-interfering case and fills the area 
with uniform cells according to the hexagonal model. 
This provides partial overlapping of the cells. Each 
simulation round provides information if that specific 
connection is useless, e.g. if the criteria set of 1) 
effective distance Deff > Dsfn in any of the cells, and 2) 
C / (N + I) < minimum C/N threshold. If both criteria 
are valid, and if the C/N would have been sufficiently 
high without the interference in that specific round, the 
SFN interference level is calculated. 
Figure 10 shows an example of the site locations. 
As can be seen, the simulator calculates the optimal 
cell radius according to the parameter setting and 
locates the transmitters on map according to the 
hexagonal model, leaving ideal overlapping areas in 
the cell border areas. The size and thus the number of 
the cells depends on the radio parameter settings 
without interferences, and in each case, a result is a 
uniform service level in the whole investigated area. 
The same network setup is used throughout the

locations the simulator has generated.  
 
The behaviour of C and I can be investigated by 
observing the probability density functions, i.e. PDF of 
the results. Nevertheless, the specific values of the 
interference levels can be obtained by producing a 
CDF from the simulation results. 
Figure 11 shows two examples of the simulation 
results in CDF format. In this specific case, the outage 
probability of 10% (i.e. area location probability of 90 
%) yields the minimum C / (N + I) of 10 dB for 8K, 
which complies with the original C/N requirement (8.5 
dB) of this case. On the other hand, the 4K mode 
results about 7 dB with 10% outage, which means that 
the minimum quality targets can not quite be achieved 
any more with these settings.

4.3. Results 
 
By applying the principles of the DVB-H simulator, 
the C/I distribution was obtained according to the 
selected radio parameters. The variables were the 
modulation scheme (QPSK and 16-QAM), antenna 
height (20-200 m) and FFT mode (4K and 8K). 
Figures 12-13 show the resulting networks that 
were used as a basis for the simulations. The simulator 
selects randomly the mobile terminal location on the 
map and calculates the C/I that the network produces at 
that specific location and moment. This procedure is 
repeated during 60,000 simulation rounds. One of the 
results after the complete simulation is the estimation 
for the occurred errors due to the interfering signals 
from the sites exceeding the safety distance (i.e. if the 
arrival times of the signals exceed the maximum 
allowed delay difference). This event can be called 
“SFN error rate”, or SER.

In Figure 14, the plots indicates the locations where 
the results of C / (N + I) corresponds 8.5 dB or less for 
QPSK. In this case, the interfering plots represent the

simulation rounds as for the simulated plots.

geographical format with C/(N+I)<8.5 dB. 
 
It can be assumed that when the SER level is 
sufficiently low, the end-users will not experience 
remarkable reduction in the DVB-H reception due to 
the extended SFN limits. In this analysis, a SER level 
of 5% is assumed to still provide with sufficient 
performance as it is in align with the limits defined in 
[2] for frame error rate before the MPE-FEC (FER) 
and frame error rate after the MPE-FEC (MFER). The 
nature of the SER is slightly different, though, as the 
interferences tend to cumulate to certain locations as 
can be observed in Figure 14 obtained from the 
simulator. 
According to simulations, the SFN interference 
level varies clearly when radio parameters are tuned. 
Figures 15-18 summarise the respective SFN area error 
analysis, the variable being the transmitter antenna 
height. Figures show that with the uniform radio 
parameters and varying the antenna height, modulation 
and FFT mode, the functional settings can be found 
regardless of the exceeding of the theoretical SFN 
limits. 
If a 5% limit for SER is accepted, the analysis show 
that antenna height of about 80 m or lower produces 
SER of 5% or less for QPSK, 8K, with minimum C / 
(N + I) requirement of 8.5 dB. If the mode is changed 
to 4K, the antenna height should be lowered to 35-40 
m from ground level in order to comply with 5% SER 
criteria in this very case. 16-PSK produces higher 
capacity and smaller coverage.

Figure 18. The summary of the case 4 (16-QAM, 
4K). 
 
The results show this clearly as the respective SER 
of 5% (16-QAM, 8K and minimum C / (N + I) 
requirement of 14.5 dB for this modulation) allows the 
use of antenna height of about 120 m. If the mode of 
this case is switched to 4K, the antenna should be 
lowered down to 50 m in order to still fulfil the SER 
5% criteria. 
The +60 dBm EIRP represents relatively low 
power. The higher power level raises the SER level 
accordingly. For the mid and high power sites the 
optimal setting depends thus even more on the 
combination of the power level and antenna height. 
According to these results, it is clear that the FFT 
mode 8K is the only reasonable option when the SER 
should be kept in acceptable level. Especially the 
QPSK modulation might not allow easily extension of 
SFN as the modulation provides largest coverage 
areas. On the other hand, when providing more 
capacity, 16-QAM is the most logical solution as it 
gives normally sufficient capacity with reasonable 
coverage areas. The stronger CR and MPE-FEC error 
correction rate decreases the coverage area but it is 
worth noting that the interference propagates equally 
also in those cases. 
The general problem of the SER arises from the 
different loss behaviour of the useful carrier and 
interfering signal. Depending on the case, the 
interfering signal might propagate 2-3 times further 
away from the originating site compared to the useful 
carrier as can be seen from Figures 12 and 13. 
In practice, the SER level can be further decreased 
by minimising the propagation of the interfering 
components. This can be done e.g. by adjusting the 
transmitter antenna down-tilting and using narrow 
vertical beam widths, producing thus the coverage area 
of the carrier and interference as close to each others as 
possible. Also the natural obstacles of the environment 
can be used efficiently for limiting the interferences far 
away outside the cell range. 
Figure 19 shows the previously presented results 
presenting the outage percentage for the different 
modes having 8.5 dB C / (N + I) limit for QPSK and 
14.5 % for 16-QAM cases in function of transmitter 
antenna height.

This version of the simulator gives indication about 
the behaviour of the C / (N + I) in geographical area. In 
order to estimate the SFN gain, the individual cells 
could be switched on and off for the comparison of the 
differences in overall C / (N + I) distribution. Never-
theless, when the investigated area is filled with the 
cells, it normally leaves outages in the northern and 
eastern sides as the area cannot be filled completely as 
shown in Figure 10. It also produces partial cell areas, 
if the centre of the site fits into the area but the edge is 
outside. An enhanced version of the simulator was thus 
developed in order to investigate the SFN gain in more 
controlled way, i.e. instead of the fixed area size the 
method uses the variable reuse pattern sizes. The 
following Chapter 6 describes the method.

As can be seen from Figure 20, the cells are located 
in such way that they create ideal overlapping areas. 
The tightly located hexagonal cells fill completely the 
circle-shape cells. A uniform parameter set is used in 
each cell, including the transmitter power level and 
antenna height, yielding the same radius for each cell 
per simulation case.

As the relative location of the cells is fixed, the

The simulations can be carried out for different cell

The variables k and l are positive integers with 
minimum value of 0. In the simulations, the reuse 
pattern sizes of 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 16, 19 and 21 was 
used for the C / (N + I) distribution in order to obtain 
the carrier and interference distribution in both non-
interfering and interfering networks (i.e. SER either 
exists or not depending on the size of the SFN area). In 
this way, the lower values of K provides with the non-
interfering SFN network until a limit that depends on 
the GI and FFT size parameters. 
The single cell (K=1) is considered as a reference in 
all of the cases. The fixed parameter set was the 
following: 
• Transmitter power: 60 dBm 
• Transmitter antenna height: 60 m 
125
International Journal On Advances in Internet Technology, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/internet_technology/

• Receiver antenna height: 1.5 m 
• Long-term fading with normal distribution and 
standard deviation of 5.5 dB 
• Area coverage probability in the cell edge: 70% 
• Receiver noise figure: 5 dB 
• Bandwidth: 8 MHz 
• Frequency: 700 MHz 
For the used bandwidth, the combined noise floor 
and noise figure yields -100.2 dBm as a reference for 
calculating the level of C and I. The path loss was 
calculated with Okumura-Hata prediction model for 
small and medium sized city. The 70 % area coverage 
probability corresponds with 10% outage probability in 
the single cell area. 
These settings result a reference C/N of 8.5 dB for 
QPSK and 14.5 dB for 16-QAM. The value is the 
minimum acceptable C/N, or in case of interferences, C 
/ (N + I) value that is needed for the successful recep-
tion of the signal. 
Figures 23 and 24 present the symmetrical reuse 
patterns that were selected for the simulations. The 
grey hexagonal means that the coordinates has been 
taken into account calculating the order number of the 
sites according to the formulas 14-16, but the 
respective transmitter has been switched off in order to 
form the correct reuse pattern.

According to the C/I link analysis, the case 
presented in Figure 26 is free of SFN interferences. 
The actual simulation results for C/N, or in case of 
the interferences, for C / (N + I), is done in such way 
that only the terminal locations inside the calculated 
cell areas are taken into account. If the terminal is 
found outside of the network area (the circles) in some 
simulation round, the result is simply rejected. 
Figure 27 shows the principle of the filtered 
simulation. As the terminal is always inside the 
coverage area of at least one cell, it gives the most 
accurate estimation of the SFN gain with different 
parameter values. Furthermore, the method provides a

As a verification of the geographical interference 
class, a study that can be called a C/I-link analysis can 
be carried out. It is a method to revise all the 
combinations (hash) of the distances between each pair 
of sites (TX1-TX2, TX1-TX3, TX2-TX1, TX2-TX3 etc.) 
marking the link as useful (C) if the guard distance 
between the respective sites is less than the maximum 
allowed SFN diameter (Dsfn). If the link is longer, it is 
marked as a potential source of interference (I). The 
interference link proportion can be obtained for each 
case by calculating the interference links over the total 
links. It gives a rough idea about the “severity” of the 
exceeding of the SFN limit, with a value range of 0-
100% (from non-interfering network up to interfered 
network where all the transmitters are a potential 
source of interference). 
 
5.2. Results 
 
Tables 4 and 5 summarises the C/I link analysis for 
the different reuse pattern sizes and for FFT and GI 
parameter values. The values presents the percentage 
of the over-sized legs of distances between the cell 
sites compared to the amount of all the legs. 
 
 
 
The C/I link analysis shows that in case of large 
network (21 cells in the SFN area), the only reasonable 
parameter set for the QPSK modulation seems to be 
FFT=8K and GI=1/4. This is due to the fact that QPSK 
provides with the largest cell sizes (with the 
investigated parameter set the r is 7.5 km). The cell 
size of the investigated 16-QAM case is smaller (r=5.0 
km) which provides the use of the parameter set of 
(FFT = 8K, GI = 1/4), (FFT = 4K, GI = 1/4) and (FFT 
= 8K, GI = 1/8). The interference distance rinterference = 
13.5 km is the same in all the cases as the interference 
affects until it reaches the reference level (the sum of 
noise floor and terminal noise figure). 
The C/I link investigation gives thus a rough idea 
about the most feasible parameter settings. In order to 
obtain the information about the complete performance 
of DVB-H, the combination of the SFN gain and SER 
level should be investigated as shown next.

Figures 29 and 30 show two examples of the PDF, 
i.e. occurred amount of samples per C/N and C/I in 
scale of 0-50 dB, with 0.1 dB resolution. 
The PDF gives a visual indication about the general 
quality of the network. Nevertheless, in order to obtain 
the exact values of the performance indicators, a 
cumulative presentation is needed. Figure 31 shows an 
example of the CDF in the non-interfering QPSK 
network with the reuse pattern size as a variable. The 
case shows the C/N for the parameter set of QPSK, GI 
1/4 and FFT 8K. This mode is the most robust against 
the interferences as it provides with the longest guard 
distance.

As can be seen from Figure 32, the single cell 
(K=1) results a minimum of 8.5 dB for the 10 % 
outage probability, i.e. for the area location probability 
of 90% in the whole cell area which corresponds to the 
70% area location probability in the cell edge. The cell 
is thus correctly dimensioned for the simulations. 
In order to find the respective SFN gain level, the 
comparison with single cell and other reuse pattern 
sizes can be made in this 10% outage point. The 
following Figures 33 and 34 shows the respective 
simulation results for all the symmetrical reuse pattern 
sizes 1-21 for QPSK and 16-QAM.

Figure 34. SFN gain levels for 16-QAM cases, 
with the reuse pattern sizes of 1-21. 
 
The simulation results show the level of SFN gain. 
The reference case {FFT 8K and GI 1/4} results the 
maximum gain for the reuse pattern sizes of K=1-21 
for both QPSK and 16-QAM and provides a non-
interfering network. In addition, the parameter set of 
{FFT = 4K, GI = 1/4} and {FFT = 8K, GI = 1/8} 
results a network where SFN errors can be 
compensated with the SFN gain. 
According to the results shown in Figure 33, the 
QPSK case could provide SFN gain of 3-4 dB in non-
interfering network. It is interesting to note that in the 
interfering cases, also the parameter set of {GI = 1/4, 
FFT = 4K corresponding FFT = 8K, GI = 1/8} results 
positive SFN gain even with the interference present 
for all the reuse pattern cases up to 21. Also the 
parameter set of {GI = 1/4, FFT = 2K, corresponding 
FFT = 8K, GI = 1/16 and FFT = 4K, GI = 1/8} 
provides an adequate quality level until reuse pattern 
of 16 although the error level (SER) increases. 
According to Figure 34, the 16-QAM gives equal 
SFN gain, resulting about 3-4 dB in non-interfering 
network. For the {FFT = 4K, GI = 1/4} and the 
corresponding parameter set of {FFT = 8K, GI = 1/8}, 
the SFN gain is higher than the SER even with higher 
reuse pattern sizes compared to QPSK, because the 16-
QAM cell size is smaller. 
As can be seen from Figures 33-34 and from the C/I 
link analysis of Tables 4-5, the rest of the cases are 
practically useless with the selected parameter set. 
 
6. Methodology for the simulations: third 
variation (urban SFN network) 
 
The dense and urban area of Mexico City was used 
as a basis for the next simulations as described in [11] 
by applying suitable propagation prediction models 
(Okumura-Hata and ITU-R P.1546-3). 
 
6.1. Simulation environment 
 
The city is located on relatively flat ground level 
with high mountains surrounding the centre area. The 
height of the planned DVB-H site antennas was 60, 
190, 30, 20, 20, 30 and 60 meters from the tower base, 
respectively for the sites 1-7. The site number 7 
represents the mountain installation with the tower 
base located 800 meters above the average ground 
level which results the effective antenna height of 860 
meters compared to the city centre level. Site number 4 
is also situated in relatively high level, but in this case, 
the surrounding area of the site limits its coverage area. 
The rest of the sites are located in the base level of 
Mexico City centre. 
As the cell radius of the investigated sites is clearly 
smaller than 20 km, the Okumura-Hata [3] is suitable 
for the path loss prediction for all the other sites except 
for the mountain site number 7. Figure 38 shows the 
principle of the geographical profile of this site, 
varying the horizontal angle from the site to the centre 
129

by 10 degree steps. As the profile shows, there are 
smaller mountains found in front of the site.

Figure 37 presents the location of the selected sites, 
and the Table 6 shows the site parameters. 
For the site number 7, ITU-R P.1546 (version 3) [7] 
model was applied by using the antenna height of 860 
meters and frequency of 680 MHz. 
The calculation of the path loss for the site number 
7 was done in practice by interpolating the correct 
ITU-R P.1546 curve for 860 meter antenna height (via 
600 and 1200 meter heights) and for 680 MHz 
frequency (via 600 and 2000 MHz). Figure 39 shows 
the resulting curve after the iterations.

Next, a trend line was created in order to present the 
tabulated values with a closed formula and to ease the 
simulations. For this specific case, there was one 
formula created for the path loss in distances of 1-20 
km (L20) and another one for the distances of 20-100 
km (L100), d being the distance (km):

calculation. 
 
The link budget of the simulator takes into account 
separately the radiating power levels and antenna 
heights of each site as seen in Table 6. 
 
 
 
During the simulations, the receiver was placed 
randomly in the investigated area (45km × 45km = 
2025 km2) according to the snap-shot principle and 
uniform geographical distribution. In each simulation 
round, the separate sum of the carrier per noise and the 
interference per noise was calculated by converting the 
received power levels into absolute powers. The result 
gives thus information about the balance of SFN gain 
and SFN interference levels. Tables of geographical 
coordinates with the respective sum of carriers and 
interferences were created by repeating the simulations 
60,000 times. Also carrier and interference level 
distribution tables were created with a scale of -50 … 
+50 dB. 
The long-term as well as Rayleigh fading was taken 
into account in the simulations by using respective 
distribution tables independently for each simulation 
round. A value of 5.5 dB was used for the standard 
deviation. The area location probability in the cell edge 
of 90% was selected for the quality criteria, producing 
about 7 dB shadowing margin for the long-term 
fading. Terminal antenna gain of -7.3 dBi was used in 
the calculations according to the principles indicated in 
[3]. Terminal noise figure of 5 dB was taken into 
account. Both Code Rate and MPE-FEC Rate were set 
to 1/2. 
 
6.2. Simulation results 
 
The usable coverage area was investigated by post-
processing the simulation results. The simulations were 
carried out by using QPSK and 16-QAM modulations, 
CR ½, MPE-FEC ½ and all the possible variations of 
FFT and GI.

with the parameter setting of QPSK, GI=1/4 and

As expected, the parameter set of {QPSK, FFT 8k, 
GI 1/4} produces the largest coverage area practically 
without interferences (Figure 41). The results of this

case can be considered thus as a reference for the 
interference point of view. 
When the GI and FFT values are altered, the level 
of interference varies respectively. The results show 
that in addition to the parameter set of {FFT 8k, GI 
1/4}, also {FFT 8k, GI 1/8}, {FFT 4k, GI 1/4} 
produces useful coverage areas, i.e. the balance of the 
SFN gain and SFN interferences seem to be in 
acceptable levels, whilst the other parameter settings 
produces highly interfered network.  
The 16-QAM produces smaller coverage areas 
compared to the QPSK as the basic requirement for the 
C / (N + I) of 16-QAM is 14.5 dB instead of the 8.5 of 
QPSK.  
 
 
Figure 42. Comparative example of the simulation 
results for the parameter set of 16-QAM, FFT 8k 
and GI 1/16.  
 
As can be observed from the previous analysis and 
Figure 42, the SFN interferences tend to cumulate to 
the outer boundaries of the planned coverage area. 
For the QPSK with FFT 8k and GI ¼, the area is 
practically free of interferences, i.e. the C / (N + I) is > 
8.5 dB in every simulated location. The dark colour in 
the middle shows the site locations with the C / (N + I) 
greater than 35 dB. 
By observing the 90% probability in the cell edge 
(about 95% in the cell area), i.e., 5 % outage 
probability of Figures 43-44, the mode {FFT 8k, GI 
1/4} provides a minimum of about 7 dB and the set of 
{FFT 8k, GI 1/8} and {FFT 4k, GI 1/4} provides the 
same performance in the whole investigated area. This 
similarity is due to the Dsfn limit, which is complied 
totally in both of the cases as the sites are grouped 
inside about 30 km diameter. It is worth noting that the 
values are calculated over the whole map of 45km × 
45km.

It seems that the QPSK mode would provide a good 
performance in the investigated area when using the 
non-interfering {FFT 8k, GI 1/4} parameters, whilst 
16-QAM gives smaller yet non-interfered coverage 
area. The advantage of the latter case is the double 
radio channel capacity compared to the QPSK with 
greater coverage area. The parameter set of {FFT 8k, 
GI 1/8} and {FFT 4k, GI 1/4} looks also useful, 
providing the possibility to either rise the maximum 
velocity of the terminal (FFT 4k), or give more 
capacity (GI 1/8). As for the rest of the parameter 
settings, the optimal balance can not be achieved due 
to the raised interference levels. 
The SFN gain of the investigated network could be 
observed more specifically by switching on and off the 
individual sites, by carrying out the C / (N + I) 
simulations and by noting the differences in the 
cumulative density function. This is not, though, 
accurate method unless the simulations are limited 
inside the maximum calculated cell radius of each site. 
The network layout used in this case is highly irregular 
and does not contain too much overlapping areas 
compared to the total area of 45 km × 45 km, so the 
separate SFN gain investigation was not carried out. 
On the other hand, the presented results already 
include the total sum of the SFN gain and interference. 
It can be estimated though that especially with the 
QPSK modes that provides with the largest coverage 
areas, the mountain site does have an effect within the 
overlapping areas of the nearest cells. According to the 
simulations presented in Figure 33, this case could 
provide an SFN gain of about 1 dB in such areas. 
Similarly, if there is spot with three overlapping cells 
in the middle of the area (i.e. in the area without 
interferences), the SFN gain could be around 2 dB 
according to the simulations presented in the chapter 
showing the balance of the SFN gain and SFN 
interferences. The results presented in [9] support this 
observation. 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
The presented simulation method provides both 
geographical and cumulative distribution of the SFN 
gain and interference levels. The method takes into 
account the balancing of the coverage and capacity as 
well as the optimal level of SFN gain and the 
interference level in case the over-sized SFN is used. It 
can be applied for the theoretical, e.g. hexagonal cell 
layouts, as well as for the practical environments, 
taking into account the radio propagation modelling 
for different sites. 
The method can thus be used in the detailed 
optimization of the DVB-H networks. The principle of 
the simulator is relatively straightforward and the 
method can be applied by using various different 
programming languages. In these investigations, a 
standard Pascal was used for programming the core 
simulator. 
The SFN gain results are in align with the practical 
results of e.g. [4] and [5] for the low number site. For 
the high number of the sites, no reference results were 
found due to the practical challenges in setting up the 
test cases. Nevertheless, estimating the theoretical 
limits by applying the formula 5, the results are in 
logical range. The SFN interference level results 
behave also logically and are in align with e.g. [10]. 
The results show that the radio parameter selection 
is essential in the detailed planning of the DVB-H 
network. As the graphical presentation of the results 
indicate, the effect of the parameter value selection on 
the interference level and thus on the quality of service 
can be drastic, which should be taken into account in 
the detailed planning of DVB-H SFN. 
Especially the controlled extension of the SFN limit 
might be interesting option for the DVB-H operators. 
The simulation method and related results shows 
logical behaviour of the SFN error rate when varying 
the essential radio parameters. The results also show 
that the optimal setting can be obtained using the 
respective simulation method by balancing the SFN 
gain and SFN errors. As expected, the 8K mode is the 
most robust when extending the SFN whilst 4K limits 
the maximum site antenna height. 16-QAM provides 
suitable performance for the extension, but according 
to the results, even QPSK which provides larger 
coverage areas is not useless in SFN extension when 
selecting the parameters correctly.
