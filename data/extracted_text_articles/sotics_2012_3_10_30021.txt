Abstract—In recent years, online social networks have grown
exponentially, as these networks are fantastic places to meet
and network with people who share similar personal interests.
Facebook, currently the largest social network, has more than
901 million active users. The amount of personal information
each user exposes on social networks like Facebook is stagger-
ing. Recent research in the area of social networking evaluated
that many Facebook users exposed personal information. Due
to the many security concerns regarding online personal
exposure, we developed the Social Privacy Protector, a software
which aims to improve the security and privacy of Facebook
users. The software contains three protection layers which
improve user privacy by implementing different methods. The
software ﬁrst identiﬁes a user’s friends who might pose a
threat, and then restricts this “friend”’s exposure to the user’s
personal information. The second layer is an expansion of
Facebook’s basic privacy settings based on different types of
social network usage proﬁles. The third layer alerts the user
about the number of installed applications on their Facebook
proﬁle which have access to their private information. An
initial version of the Social Privacy Protection software was
evaluated on 74 Facebook users and successfully assisted them
in restricting the access of 392 friends.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, online social networks have grown rapidly
and today offer individuals endless possibilities for publicly
expressing themselves, communicating with friends, and
sharing information with people across the world. A recent
survey [1] estimated that 65% of adult internet users use
online social networks sites, such as Twitter [2], LinkedIn [3]
Google+ [4], and Facebook [5]. As of June 2012, the
Facebook social network, has more 955 million monthly
active users [6]. On average, Facebook users have 138
friends and upload more than 300 million pictures each
day [6]. Moreover, according to the Nielsen “Social Media
Report” [7], American internet users spent more than 53.5
billion minutes on Facebook in the month of May 2011,
making Facebook the leading web-brand in United-States.
Due to the friendly nature of Facebook, users tend to
disclose many personal details about themselves and about
their connections. These details can include date of birth,
personal pictures, work place, email address, high school
name, relationship statuses, and even phone numbers. More-
over, Bosmaf et al. [8] discovered that an average of 80% of
studied Facebook users accepted friend requests from people
they do not know if they share more than 11 mutual friends.
In many cases, accepting friend request from strangers may
result in exposure of a user’s personal information to third
parties. In addition, personal information of Facebook users
can be exposed to third party Facebook applications [9].
Another privacy concern deals with existing privacy set-
tings which, for the majority of Facebook users, do not
match security expectations [10]. This results in many users
accidently or unknowingly publishing private information,
leaving them more exposed than they assumed.
If a user’s personal information is disclosed to a malicious
third party, it can be used to threaten the well-being of
the user both online and in the real world. For example, a
malicious user can use the gained personal information and
send customized spam messages to the user in an attempt
to lure such users onto malicious websites [11] or blackmail
them into transferring money to the attacker’s account [12].
In order to cover their tracks, social network attackers can
use fake proﬁles. In fact, the number of fake proﬁles on
Facebook can be counted in the tens of millions. Facebook
estimates that around 5%-6% of its users could be false or
duplicate accounts [13].
In this paper, we present an application for protecting user
privacy on Facebook. Our application provides Facebook
users with three different layers of protection. The ﬁrst layer
enables Facebook users an easy method for controlling their
proﬁle privacy settings by simply choosing the most suitable
proﬁle privacy settings in just one click. The second layer
notiﬁes the user of the number of applications installed
on their proﬁle that may impose a threat to their privacy.
The third layer analyzes the user’s friends list to identify
which friends of the user are suspected as fake proﬁles and
therefore impose a threat on a user’s privacy. The application
presents a convenient method for restricting the access of
these fake proﬁles to the user’s personal information without
removing them from the user’s friends list.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we give a brief overview of various related
solutions which better help protect the security and privacy
of social network users. In Section III, we describe the
Social Privacy Protector software architecture in detail. In
Section IV, we describe the initial evaluation results. Finally,
in Section V, we present our conclusions from this study and

offer future research directions.
II. RELATED WORK
In recent years, due to the increasing number of privacy
and security threats on online social networks users, so-
cial network operators, security companies, and academic
researchers have proposed various solutions to increase the
security and privacy of social network users.
Social network operators attempt to better protect their
users by adding authentication processes to ensure that the
registered user represents a real live person [14]. Many social
network operators, like Facebook, also offer their users a
conﬁgurable user privacy setting that enables users to secure
their personal data from other users in the network [10], [15].
Additional protection may include defense against hackers,
spammers, socialbots, identity cloning, phising, and many
other threats. For example, Facebook users have an option
to report other users in the network who harass others in the
network [16].
Many commercial and open source products, such as
Checkpoint’s SocialGuard [17], Websense’s Defensio [18],
UnitedParents [19], RecalimPrivacy [20], and PrivAware
application [21], offer online social network users tools for
better protecting themselves. For example, the Websense’s
Defensio software aims to protect its users from spammers,
adults content, and malicious scripts on Facebook.
In recent years, several published academic studies have
proposed solutions for different social network threats. De-
Barr and Wechsler [22] used the graph centrality measure
to identify spammers. Wang [23] presented techniques to
classify spammers on Twitter based on content and graph
features. Stringhini et al. [11] presented a solution for
detecting spammers in social networks by using “honey-
proﬁles”. Egele et al. [9] presented PoX, an extension for
Facebook which make all requests for private data explicit
to the user. Anwar and Fong [24] presented the Reﬂective
Policy Assessment tool which helps the user examine their
proﬁle from the viewpoint of another user in the network.
Recently, Fire et al. [25] proposed a method for detecting
fake proﬁles in online social network based on anomalies in
the fake user’s social structure.
In this study, we offer a method for protecting user privacy
in online social networks by detecting users who may pose
a threat to a user’s privacy by restricting their access to the
user’s personal information.
III. SOCIAL PRIVACY PROTECTOR ARCHITECTURE
To better protect the privacy of Facebook users, we have
developed the Social Privacy Protector software (otherwise
referred to as SPP). The SPP software consists of three main
parts (see Figure 1) which work in synergy: a) Friends
Analyzer Facebook application - which is responsible for
identifying a user’s friends who may pose a threat to the
users privacy, b) SPP Firefox Addon - which analyzes the
Figure 1.
Social Privacy Protector Architecture
user’s privacy setting and helps the user to improve their
privacy settings in one click, and c) HTTP Server - which is
responsible for the analyzing, storing, and caching software
results for each user. In the remainder of this section, we
describe in detail each individual SPP part.
A. The Friends Analyzer Facebook Application
The Friends Analyzer Facebook application is the part of
the SPP which is responsible for analyzing the user’s friends
list in order to determine which of the user’s friends may
pose a threat to the user’s privacy. After the user installs
the Friends Analyzer application, the application scans the
user’s friends list and returns a credibility score for each
one of the user’s friends. Each friend’s score is created
by simple heuristics which take into account the strength
of the connection between the user and their friends. The
application estimates the strength of each connection by
calculating the number of common friends between the user
and their friend, the number of pictures and videos the user
and their friend were tagged in together, the number of
groups the user and their friend were both members in, and
the number of messages passed between the user and their
friend. In the end of the process, the user receives a web
page which includes a sorted list of all their friends. The
list is sorted according to the score of each friend received
where the friends with the lowest scores have the highest
likelihood of being fake proﬁles appear on the top the list
(see Figure 2). For each friend in the returned sorted list,
the user has the ability to restrict the friend’s access to the
user’s private information simply by clicking on the restrict
button attached to each friend in the sorted list.

B. Social Privacy Protector Firefox Addon
The Social Privacy Protector Firefox Addon (also referred
to as Addon) is the part of the SPP software which is
responsible for improving the user’s privacy settings in just a
few simple clicks. After the Addon is installed on the user’s
Firefox browser, it begins to monitor the user’s internet
activity. When the Addon identiﬁes the user who has entered
into their Facebook account, the Addon analyzes the number
of applications installed on the user’s Facebook proﬁle and
presents a warning with the number of installed applications
that may pose threat to the user’s privacy (see Figure 3).
The Addon also presents the top two results obtained by
the Friends Analyzer Facebook application and suggests to
the user which friends to restrict (see Figure 3).
The Addon also detects when the user has entered the
Facebook’s privacy settings page and presents the user with
three new privacy setting options. The new privacy settings
are based on the user’s proﬁle type and can be modiﬁed
Figure 4. Social Privacy Protector Firefox Addon - warning about installed
applications and friends you may want to restrict
in one click (see Figure 4) instead of the more complex
Facebook custom privacy setting that may contain more than
170 options [24]. Using the new Addon privacy setting, a
user can simply chose the proﬁle type most suitable for him
out of three options: a) Celebrity setting - in this setting all
of the user’s information is public, b) Recommended setting
- in this setting the user’s privacy is only public to friends,
however some of the user’s details, such as proﬁle name and
pictures, are public, and c) Kids settings - in this setting the
proﬁle is only open to the user’s friends and only friends
of friends can apply for friend requests. Using this Addon,
users can easily control and improve their privacy without
the need to contact a security expert. Our application is also
easy for customizing privacy settings by adding more privacy
option settings to different types of users.
C. HTTP Server
The HTTP Server is the part of the SPP which is re-
sponsible for connecting between the SPP Firefox Addon
and SPP Facebook application. Moreover, to enhance the
application’s performance, the HTTP server caches parts of
the analyzed results. In order to protect the user’s privacy,
the application stores only the minimal number of features
in an encrypted manner using RC4 encryption.
IV. EVALUATION
An initial version of the SPP version was evaluated by 74
users who installed the Friends Analyzer Facebook applica-
tion and 4 users who installed the Addon. Using the Friends
Analyzer Facebook application, 31 users have a restriction
of 392 (median = 3 and σdev = 25.76) friends. According
to our initial evaluation results, the average common friends
between the user and the friends they chose to restrict was

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we present the SPP software which aims
to better protect user’s privacy in Facebook. The software
protects user’s privacy by providing three layers of privacy
protection. The ﬁrst layer helps to restrict a user’s friends
access to personal information. The second layer help to
identify and warn the user about installed Facebook appli-
cations which can violate the user’s privacy. The third layer
helps the user to adjust their privacy setting in one click. An
initial version of the software was evaluated by 74 users and
helped 31 users restrict the access of 392 friends to the users’
personal information. As expected, in our preliminary results
(see Table I), the application users’ chose to restrict friends
with less common features with them, such as number of
common friends and number of tagged pictures.
The study presented in this paper is a work in progress
with many available future directions. Using the SPP we
can gather examples on which friends users tend to restrict.
Using these examples, combined with Machine-Learning
algorithms, we can improve the recommendation results on
which friends to restrict. Moreover, in case many users re-
stricted the same users, we can conclude with high likelihood
that these users are fake users and recommend Facebook
to remove them from the social network. Another possible
future direction is to collect anonymous data on user privacy
setting preferences. By using the users privacy preferences,
we can create more types of “one click” privacy settings that
serve other types of users and protect their privacy.
In the near future, we are going to release a ﬁnal stable
version of the SPP, and make it available to any user that
want to improve his privacy on Facebook.
