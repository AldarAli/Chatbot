Abstract - Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are used for public 
communications and for scientific purposes. Most of the 
scientific satellites communicate with ground stations at S - 
band. Environmental satellites usually contain also equipment 
for search and rescue services communicating with ground 
terminals at L - band.  The antenna noise temperature impacts 
satellite 
ground 
station 
performance. 
Antenna 
noise 
temperature is a measure of the effective noise integrated over 
the entire antenna pattern. On these bands the ionosphere 
effects are negligible. Heavy rain attenuation is considered as 
the most important atmospheric factor on determining 
antenna temperature on L and S bands. In this paper, the 
calculation and comparison of antenna noise temperature, 
caused under the worst propagation case, of the hypothetical 
satellite ground station   implemented in different cities of 
Europe is given.

 INTRODUCTION  
 
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites provide opportunities 
for investigations for which alternative techniques are either 
difficult or impossible to apply. Thus, it may be expected 
that such missions will be further developed in the near 
future especially in fields where similar experiments by 
purely Earth-based means are impracticable. Ground 
stations have to be established in order to communicate with 
such satellites, and the quality of communication depends 
on the performance of the satellite ground station, in 
addition to that of the satellite [1]. The downlink 
performance is commonly defined through a receiving 
system Figure of Merit. Figure of Merit depends on system 
noise 
temperature, 
consequently 
on 
antenna 
noise 
temperature [2]-[4]. The concern of this paper is the 
variation of antenna noise temperature at L and S band in 
Europe [5], [6].  
At Section II, the concept of downlink budget 
expressed by range equation, the downlink margin and 
Figure of Merit are given. A general overview of system 
temperature, considering the best and the worst 
propagation case is presented at Section III. The paper 
aims to compare heavy rain attenuation impact on 
antenna noise temperature at different cities in Europe, as 
covered by Section IV.

DOWNLINK  BUDGET 
 
In downlink budget calculations, of the greatest interest 
is receiving system signal to noise ratio [(S/N) or (S/N0)] 
expressed by range equation [7], as:

where the r indicates  expected  signal to noise ratio to be 
received at receiver, and rqd means required signal to noise 
ratio by customer, based on defined performance. So, a 
positive value of DM is an indication of a good system 
performance. In efforts to maintain a positive link margin, 
we might trade among parameters of range equation.  If all 
parameters of the link are rigorously treated (the worst 
case), high link margin is not needed to be designed. In 
satellite industry expressions “link can be closed” and “link 
can not be closed” are often used, meaning respectively that 
error performance satisfies or not satisfies [7].  
The reception quality of the satellite receiving system is 
commonly defined through a Receiving System Figure of 
Merit as

III. 
SYSTEM  TEMPERATURE 
 
Schematically the satellite ground station receiving 
system and environment concept is presented in Figure 1.  
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Satellite ground station and environment. 
 
In Figure 1, 
C
T  represents the sky noise temperature, 
m
T  is 
medium temperature and A is medium attenuation. It is clear 
that unwanted noise, is in part, injected via antenna (
kTA B)
 
and a part is generated internally (
kTcomp B)
 by line loss and 
equipment [7], [8].  
 
A. Antenna  temperature 
 
 In front of receiving antenna different noise sources 
(natural, man-made or interferences) are present. The 
antenna temperature depends on where the antenna is 
looking at. From this surrounding environment (external 
sources) antenna will    pick up a part of this noise power as: 
 
                              
kT B
N
A
A =
                        (5) 
 
 where B is  receiver’s bandwidth.  
Under assumptions, that solid angle subtended by the 
noise source is much larger than antenna solid angle, 
antenna sees the sky without medium attenuation and 
antenna itself is considered lossless, then antenna noise 
temperature 
A
T  is equal to the sky noise temperature
C
T .  
  
                                         
C
A
T = T
                                      (6) 
 
Referring to [6] at L and S band the sky noise temperature is 
C
T = (3-10) K.  This is the best propagation case, where 
A
T =
C
T .  
Due to an atmospheric process the absorption increases 
the antenna noise temperature. If it is considered the total 
cosmic temperature as 
TC
, the absorptive medium 
temperature as 
m
T  and the attenuation due the absorptive 
process as A , then antenna noise temperature 
A
T  is [8]:

LEO satellites move too fast over the ground station. 
Ground station’s antenna has to track the satellite’s 
movement. Thus, the antenna’s elevation angle varies, also. 
Considering sky noise temperature as 
TC =10
K, antenna 
noise temperature as function of elevation angle is presented 
in Figure 2 [3].    
              
      
Figure 2.  Antenna noise temperature 
Figure 2, shows that under a perpendicular elevation 
angle it is the lowest antenna temperature.        
             
B. Rain attenuation  
 
Atmospheric attenuation depends mainly on the liquid 
water content along the propagation path. For the link 
budget calculation, including all types of hydrometeors, it is 
sufficient as the worst propagation case in Europe to be 
considered a heavy rain.  
The attenuation of a wave due to rain depends on the 
following: number of raindrops along the path, the size of 
drops and the length of the path through the rain. If Pr (0) is 
the signal power before the rain region, Pr(r) is the signal 
power after the rain region, and r is the path length through 
the rain region, then the propagation loss L (in decibels) 
because of rain attenuation is given by [8]:

In practice, the propagation loss due to rain attenuation is 
usually expressed via the specific attenuation γ  in [dB/km] 
so, the propagation loss L is: 
 
                                            
r
L
= γ l
⋅
                               (9) 
 
where γ  is the specific rain attenuation expressed in 
[dB/km] and 
rl
is rain path length in [km]. Specific 
attenuation depends on rain structure (including drops’ 
radius
dr
, drop size distribution
n(r)
, rain refractive 
indexm) and frequency f  as:

γ =
                  (10) 
 
But, based on the specific attenuation model of ITU-R [8] it 
is found that γ  (specific rain attenuation) depends only on 
the rainfall rate R, measured on the ground in millimeters 
per hour. From this empirical model, the usual form of 
expressing γ  is: 
 
                                      
[
γ = a Rb dB/km]

                   (11)                                    
 
where a  and b are constants which depend on frequency, 
polarization and average rain temperature [8]. Table I, 
shows values of a  and b  at various frequencies at 20 0C for 
both polarizations [ITU 838, ITU-R P838-1]. 
 
TABLE I.  PARAMETRS OF EMPIRICAL RAIN ATTENUTION 
MODEL 
 
The 
specific 
rain 
attenuation 
depends 
on 
the 
geographical location of the ground station, respectively on 
rainfall rate at that location. A normal rain fall rate in 
Central Europe is 5 [mm/h].  For most of Europe a rainfall 
rate of 30 [mm/h] is suitable, except for some of 
Mediterranean regions where rainfall rates up to 50 [mm/h] 
have to be used [5], [6], [8].  Considering Eqn. 11 and Table 
I, it is calculated specific rain attenuation for different 
rainfall rates at different frequencies (L and S band) for 
horizontal and vertical polarization, presented in Table II 
and Table III.

Table II and Table III confirm that the specific rain 
attenuation increases with rainfall rate and frequency.  For 
the same frequency and the same rainfall rate it is lower rain 
attenuation 
for 
vertical 
polarization, 
thus, 
vertical 
polarization is more convenient for communication under 
rain conditions. Passing through a rain medium, except the 
attenuation the polarization state of a wave can change also; 
such a vertical polarized wave can occur as a horizontal 
polarized wave. This is called rain depolarization. 
Depolarization depends on rain attenuation. Lower rain 
attenuation means less depolarization loss and vice versa. 
Problem of depolarization is avoided applying circular 
polarization, what is the most applicable polarization for 
satellite communication. Since, horizontal polarization is 
more sensitive on rain, representing the worst propagation 
case from the polarization point of view, further analyses 
relate on horizontal polarization. Specific rain attenuation 
for different frequencies and different rainfall rates for 
horizontal polarization as the worst case is presented in 
Figure 3.

. For rain paths under too low 
elevation angle (ex. ε0 < 50), it is necessary to take into the 
account the variation of rain in the horizontal direction [8].  
LEO satellites move too fast over the Earth. Obviously, 
the satellite’s path length over the ground station for 
different passes is not the same [1]; consequently the rain 
path length between the satellite and the ground station is 
not constant and varies for each orbit path. Considering the 
whole horizon in the azimuth range of 0º - 360º, in any 
direction of the horizon plane the natural barriers will differ 
[9]. The practical acquisition and loss elevation values 
ranges from 1º- 4º. In order to avoid the problem of natural 
barriers, designers predetermine the lowest elevation of the 
horizon plane which is applied during link budget 
calculations. The horizon plane with a predetermined 
minimal elevation is considered the designed horizon plane. 
Usually, for meteorological and search and rescue satellites 
operating on S and L band respectively, the ground station 
horizon plane is defined above 5º elevation [10] [11]. By 
this reason all further analyses as the worst case consider the 
communication under 5 º elevations. For rain attenuation 
calculations, some cities of Europe are chosen where 
hypothetically is supposed to be implemented a satellite 
ground station dedicated for scientific or search and rescue 
services. The horizon plane of ground stations is   supposed 
above 5º elevation. From the http://earth.google.com/ are 
provided latitude and altitude of these cities and presented in 
Table V. Rain path length is calculated based on Eqn. 13.

Applying Eqn. 14 it is calculated rain attenuation in (dB) 
for heavy rain storm in Europe (R=50mm/h) under 5º 
elevation and horizontal polarization as the worst 
propagation case for the link budget and presented in

Rain attenuation variation at 2GHz is less than 0.16dB 
and at 4GHz is less than 0.6dB. This is the first 
indication that the satellite ground station will perform 
approximately equally in different cities.

Figure 8. Antenna temperature  in Europe. 
 
Figure 6, confirms the fact that antenna noise temperature 
increases approximately exponentially with the raise on 
frequency. Figure 7 and Figure 8, show that the variation 
in antenna noise temperature among European cities 
increases with raise of frequency, also. The difference of 
the highest and the lowest antenna noise temperature for 
European cities is presented in Table VIII.

Obviously with raise on frequency this difference 
increases, and for 1GHz and 2GHz it is negligible. This 
means that communication between satellites and ground 
stations at L band, dedicated for search and rescues 
services, will have very similar performance in Europe. 
At S band, the upper edge at 4GHz is considered. For the 
case of communication on 4 GHz, 
it is considered a 
hypothetical ground station with composite temperature 
(including lines and equipment) of 
Tcomp = 70
K [12] and 
receiving antenna with gain of 
G = 35
dBi. For the 
ground station implemented in Rome, where the antenna 
noise temperature is the highest, yields the Figure of 
Merit as:

Further, considering the same equipment implemented in

The difference in Figure of Merit, between Rome and 
Berlin as cities with the highest and the lowest antenna 
temperature caused because of heavy rain under very low 
elevation angle of 5º, it is 0.5 dB. Considering that the 
most of communication among satellites and ground 
stations is above 5º, ground station will perform almost 
similarly at most of Europe in L and S band.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The antenna noise temperature has an effect to the link 
performance expressed by range equation. Only rain 
attenuation on antenna temperature is considered. Other 
local influences are not subject of this paper. Considering 
horizontal polarization transmission, and heavy rain under 
too low elevations as the worst propagation case, it is 
confirmed that the reception quality of a ground station 
within central Europe at L and S bands does not highly 
depend on location. The difference in Figure of Merit, 
between Rome and Berlin as cities with the highest and 
the lowest antenna temperature under the worst 
propagation case, it is always less than 0.5 dB at L and S 
band. This low difference in Figure of Merit, become 
negligible at circular polarization applications.
