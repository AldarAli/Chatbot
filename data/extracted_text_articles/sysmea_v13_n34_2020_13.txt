Abstract—Metal Oxide Sensors are promising for gas detection 
but only a few studies about barium titanium deposition for 
carbon dioxide detection were reported. Its influence on 
detection has not been yet fully studied. Herein, we have realised 
barium titanium sensitive films by drop coating and screen-
printing methods. A sensing material solution has been 
prepared by controlling the viscosity, and then the structural 
and morphological properties have been studied. The realised 
sensors were tested in the presence of CO2 in dry and humid air 
(20%-50%-70%), in a concentration range from 100 ppm to 
5000 ppm. Finally, a cross-interference study has been achieved 
with SO2, NO2 and CO interfering gases.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is regularly studied as a target gas 
due to its wide involvement in many circumstances for 
security, health, or agricultural applications. Our previous 
work [1] has been focused on CO2 sensing for the air quality 
control. CO2 is present in the air we breathe. Its concentration 
in outdoor air is around 400 ppm [2]. It is an odorless, 
colorless, and non-flammable gas. Outdoor CO2 emissions 
are mainly of natural origin such as volcanoes, and forest 
fires, or related to the breathing of animals and plants. 
However, a small part of emissions (around a few %) 
comes from human activities, such as economic development 
[3], the energy sector (extraction of fossil fuels, electricity 
production, and heating provided by fossil fuel power plants) 
[4], agriculture (methane production) [5], industry [6], 
deforestation [6], transport, or buildings (construction, 
heating of residential and non-residential buildings) [7], [8]. 
CO2 is a molecule also produced by the human body during 
respiration. Note that our respiratory and circulatory systems 
are sensitive to the CO2 concentration. Indeed, an increase in 
the CO2 concentration of the inspired air accelerates 
immediately our breathing rhythm. The CO2 concentration 
inside buildings is usually between 350 and 2500 ppm and is 
related to human occupation and air renewal. Starting at 
0.1%, CO2 becomes a factor in asthma or building syndrome.  
At 4%, CO2, the threshold for irreversible health effects is 
reached and a CO2 level higher than 10%, can cause death. 
The CO2 measurement can therefore be used as an indicator 
of air quality [9], [10].  
Nowadays, the most commonly used CO2 sensors are 
based on infrared phenomena, but this technology is 
expensive and miniaturization limited. Thus, the challenge of 
developing a CO2 gas sensor with a good sensitivity, low-
cost, which can provide reliable and reproducible detection 
results and a fast response to the target gas is increasingly 
claimed by different companies such as the environment, 
food industry, and medical. The electrochemical interaction 
of solid-state gas sensors meets these requirements. Indeed, 
many materials have been studied, in particular Metal Oxides 
(MOX) which have promising advantages as mentioned 
above [11], [12]. Iwata et al. [13] and Xiong et al. [14] 
worked on a CO2 detector based on La2O3-SnO2 and LaOCl-
SnO2, respectively. They obtained a high sensitivity of the 
sensor to a CO2 exposure, besides Xiong et al. exhibit any 
saturation to a wide detection range (100 to 20 000 ppm). 
However, other materials have a high potential for CO2 
detection, such as the barium titanate (BaTiO3) presented in 
our previous work [1], whose semiconductor behavior is n-
type. In 1991, Ishihara et al. [15] integrate BaTiO3 in a mixed 
semiconducting oxide for CO2 detection by a sensor based on 
a compressed disk. The combination of CuO-BaTiO3, in 
equimolar proportion, bring a capacitive response equals to 
2.98 for 2% of CO2. A significant improvement in sensitivity 
has been achieved by adding silver to the composite. It has 
increased the sensor response up to 7.74 for 2% of CO2 [16]. 
However, the operating temperature was still high (higher 
than 470°C) and a high concentration (20 000 ppm) was 
presented, which is not suitable for the air quality control 
application where the common concentration outdoor is 400 
ppm and low energy consumption is required. In addition, 
M.-S. Lee et al. [17] and Keller et al. [18] have worked on 
another approach using a complex mixed semiconducting 
oxide, BaTiO3-CuO-LaCl3 and BaTiO3-CuO-La2O3-CaCO3, 
respectively. The latter was based on the deposition of a thick 
film, which was coated by a combination of laser ablation 
technique and screen printing. The study presents a sensitive 
layer with a response, Rgas/Rair = 2.8 for 5000 ppm of CO2. 
Moreover, several publications tend to enhance the response 
to CO2 through the development of thin films. For example,

Herrán et al. [19] carried out a study about BaTiO3-CuO-Ag 
to improve CO2 detection. Thus, compared to the use of a 
thick layer, the radio frequency (RF) sputtering method to 
obtain a thin metal oxide film brings many benefits, such as 
the sensitivity or the response/recovery time. However, the 
main advantage provided by the thin film is its influence on 
the sensitivity due to the contribution of the metal-
semiconductor junction, which has led to a change in 
resistance [20]. Numerous studies [20, 21, 22] have also 
shown that it is possible to considerably improve the 
sensitivity of sensors based on BaTiO3-CuO by the addition 
of metallic nanograins such as silver. Also, Joshi et al. [23] 
studied this composite and demonstrated a good sensitivity to 
CO2 with long-term stability and excellent selectivity for low 
operating temperature (120°C). In the meantime, few authors 
report on a study on pure BaTiO3. In Table I, we have 
presented a literature review of CO2 sensors based on 
BaTiO3. The methods of deposition of the sensitive films, the 
operating temperature, as well as the sensor performances, 
are summarized.  S.B. Rudraswamy et al. [24] have shown 
that BaTiO3 based on a thin film deposited by RF sputtering 
had a sensitivity to CO2 equals to Rgas/Rair = 1.1 for 500 ppm. 
S. B. Rudraswamy et al. and B. Liao et al. have shown 
through their various studies [24], [25] that pure BaTiO3 has 
no sensitivity to CO2 in dry air. These observations can be 
explained by the need for the presence of moisture in the 
carrier gas mixed with CO2 to obtain a change in the work 
function [26]. Therefore, as this material looks promising for 
CO2 detection in wet conditions, we decided to manufacture 
a sensor using BaTiO3 ink to develop sensors that are easy 
and inexpensive to manufacture. 
In this paper, a comparison between the drop coating and 
the screen-printing methods are presented for the elaboration 
of BaTiO3 low-cost thick film. The advantages of their use 
are the speed and the deposition simplicity. Thus, the 
electrical performances of BaTiO3 during exposure to CO2 
are investigated. Both deposition methods are compared on 
the basis of several characteristics such as sensitivity, 
baseline stability, and response repeatability. The rest of the 
paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we describe our 
approach based on BaTiO3 Nano-Powder (NP) deposition on 
platinum interdigitated electrodes by screen printing and drop 
coating, low cost, and easily used techniques. Then, in 
Section III, the detection results are discussed based on a 
change in the conductance of BaTiO3 during the CO2 
introduction. The detection performances have been studied 
in a CO2 concentration range between 100 and 5000 ppm, in 
the presence of humidity (R.H. 20% 50% and 70%). Finally, 
a conclusion is given in Section IV. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
This experimental section consists of two parts; in the first

To carry out our platform test, interdigitated Ti/Pt 
electrodes, 5 and 100 nm respectively, were deposited by 
Radio-Frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering on a Si/SiO2

Figure 2. Description of the sensor test bench. 
0.3g of BaTiO3 Nano Particules (<100 nm, Sigma 
Aldrich®) was mixed with 0.3g of glycerol for the screen-
printing. For the drop coating solution, 0.3g of BaTiO3 NP 
was diluted in 5 mL of ethanol. Then, the solution was stirred 
by a magnetic agitator during 2h at room temperature. The 
solution viscosity has been adjusted to 2.7 mPa.s at 24°C with 
glycerol measured by the Sine-wave Vibro Viscometer SV-
10 instrument. The solution was applied in drops on it using 
a glass Pasteur pipette. The gas sensors were annealed at  
450 °C for 3 min in air ambient to evaporate the organic 
solvent and ensure the adhesion of the samples to the 
transducer. Then, the sensitive layer structure and the 
crystalline phase quality were checked by X-ray Diffraction 
(XRD) using an Empyrean Panalytical diffractometer 
equipped with a rapid detector with a theta-theta 
configuration and CuKα radiation (λ=0.154 nm). The surface 
investigation was performed by an SEM/EDS acquisition 
using a ZEISS GeminiSEM 500. Then, the thickness of the 
deposited BaTiO3 films was measured with a surface 
profilometry mapping using a Bruker's DektakXT Stylus 
Profiler. 
B. Electrical characterization 
The test bench described in Fig. 2, consists of three parts, 
including a gas and a humidity generation system (0 to 90%), 
a thermostatically controlled chamber for regulating the 
temperature during the sensor characterization processes, and 
a data acquisition system. This equipment allows controlling 
the dilution of CO2 in a carrier-neutral gas flow (air). 
Furthermore, the humidity is generated from the saturation 
flows of dry air by bubbling it in a container of deionized 
water, see Fig. 3. The humidity level is then regulated by 
measuring relative humidity with a capacitive probe and 
automatically controlling the mixing ratio using two mass 
flow controllers (MFC4 – MFC5) between the wet flow and 
the dry flow.  
 
Figure 3. Description of the humidity generation in the air flow. 
 The gas dilution is precisely controlled by mass flow 
regulators. The thermostatically controlled chamber allows 
keeping the test chamber temperature constant during all the 
processes. The samples were located on a hotplate to control 
the operating temperature up to 300°C in a thermostatic 
chamber regulated at 30°C. The electrical measurements and 
the temperature were monitored by a homemade LabVIEW 
program to control the Source Measurement Unit (SMU) NI 
PXie-4141 and the programmable DC power supply NI-
PXIe4113, respectively.

For the sensing property investigations, a 1V DC voltage 
was applied during the current measurements and a constant 
total flow was maintained by a MFC at 500 Standard Cubic 
Centimeters per Minute (SCCM). The CO2 concentrations 
(from 100 to 5000 ppm) were generated by the mixture of 
synthetic air and the CO2 diluted in dry air. Also, the CO2 
exposure was performed during 5 min with three Relative 
Humidity (RH equals to 20%, 50%, and 70%) to evaluate the 
sensor response. The sensors were operated at several 
temperatures from 200°C to 300°C. The best sensor 
performance compromise for this work was obtained at 
280°C. The sensor response is defined in (1): 
R = Rgas / Rair   
 
(1) 
Rgas is the sensor resistance under CO2 exposure and Rair 
is the sensor resistance in the air. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this section, we will present the structural properties of 
the sensitive layer, and we will discuss our sensor 
performances.  
A. Structural characterization  
The XRD pattern presents in Fig. 4a the diffracted X-rays 
obtained with an Empyrean Panalytical diffractometer 
(λ=0.154 nm) at room temperature after deposited the screen-
printing paste of BaTiO3 on a Si/SiO2 substrate and annealed 
it at 450°C during 3 min on a hotplate. Fig. 4b shows the 
diffracted X-rays obtained in the same conditions for the 
BaTiO3 layer deposited by drop coating. The both 
diffractograms present a good agreement with the 
conventional tetragonal BaTiO3 structure (PDF2 00-05-0626 
(ICDD, 2002)) [27]. The BaTiO3 layer deposited by screen 
printing presents some weak peaks visible in the 
diffractogram background that are not present in the BaTiO3 
layer deposited by drop coating indicating that this method 
leads to a layer with fewer impurities. For layers deposited by 
both techniques, the mean grain size was calculated to be 37 
± 2 nm using a single diffraction peak (111) and applying the 
Scherrer equation given by: 
𝜏 = 𝑘 ∗ 𝜆 𝛽 cos 𝛩 
 
(2)  
where k = 0.9 and β is the peak FWHM (rad).  
The (111) diffraction peak has been chosen as it is a single 
peak. Therefore, its width is supposed to depend only on grain 
size and instrumental width. However, the grain size 
calculation from one peak do not lead to an accurate 
estimation since it is representative to one preferential 
orientation.

Thus, a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image 
produced by a ZEISS GeminiSEM 500 (Fig. 5) enabled us to 
determine an average grain size which was estimated at  
55 nm for both deposition methods.

The EDS spectra (inset (c) and (d) in Fig. 5) validate the

the BaTiO3 reveal the component of Barium (Ba), Titanium 
(Ti) and Oxygen (O). The EDS analysis is in agreement with 
the XRD analyses.

The surface morphological images (Fig. 6) were

thicknesses, are estimated to be 30 µm and 15 µm for the 
screen printing and drop coating, respectively.

B. Electrical sensor study for screen printing deposition 
method 
Fig. 7 shows a reversible response of the BaTiO3 sensor 
to 400 ppm of CO2 gas in 50% RH at 280°C. We observed 
the sensor resistance increase in the presence of CO2. Since 
CO2 is an oxidant gas, the sensor resistance increase confirms 
the n-type behaviour of BaTiO3, according to [20]. The 
response and the recovery times are 2 minutes and 4 minutes, 
respectively. Where the response time τres is defined as the 
time required for the sensor to reach 90% of the sensor 
response, and the recovery time τrec as the time needed to 
reach 10% of the initial resistance baseline after the analyst 
gas has been purged.

Figure 7. Resistance variation for 400 ppm of CO2 at 280°C and 50% RH

By maintaining the same operating temperature of 280°C 
and 50% RH, the CO2 sensor responses were measured from 
100 ppm to 5000 ppm for both sensors and presented in Fig. 
8.

In humid conditions and high temperatures, it is assumed 
that the CO2 detection phenomenon follows the pathways 
indicated below [20], [26]:

The gas sensors provide a measurable response to CO2 as 
well as a stable baseline during the experiment. These results 
showed that our sensors have a wide detection range. It is 
possible to measure low concentrations with a low signal-to-
noise ratio. Table III shows the comparison of the samples 
regarding their response and recovery times, respectively, 
tested from 100 to 5000 ppm at 280°C as operating 
temperature and 50% RH.

We have noticed that the humidity has an impact on the 
CO2 response. For the different concentration levels, the 
sensor responses increase as humidity decrease. Therefore, 
optimal sensor responses were determined for 20% humidity.

humidity and deposition method.

In addition to sensitivity, reproducibility was examined in 
another set of experiments. However, the repeatability 
characteristics of the sensors were obtained at 50% RH, 
which is the value commonly used in the industrial sector. 
These results are presented in Fig. 10 and show good 
reproducibility 
of 
conventionally 
prepared 
sensors. 
Furthermore, we calculated the coefficient of variation (Table 
V) to evaluate the repeatability features, defined in (3): 
 
𝐶F = SD / 𝑥HIJ 
 
 
 (3) 
 
where SD is the standard deviation and xmoy the average of 
the normalized response for CO2 exposure.

Figure 10. Normalized resistance of BaTiO3 sensors for five exposures of 
1500 ppm CO2 at 280°C and 50% RH, a) screen printing and b) drop 
coating. 
We determined a Cv equals to 2.84 % and 1.24 % for the 
sensors prepared by screen printing and drop coating, 
respectively. It indicates good repetition behaviour during 
each CO2 exposure.

As MOX sensors are known for their poor selectivity, a 
cross sensitivity study of our BaTiO3 sensors to three other 
greenhouse gases was carried out and is presented in Fig. 11.  
 
Figure 11. Selectivity study for four gases: NO2, SO2, CO, and CO2. 
Variation of the normalized resistance of BaTiO3 sensors depending on the 
gas concentrations. 
The gas concentrations chosen are based on the exposure 
limit value recommended by health agencies. This figure 
highlighted that our BaTiO3 NP-based sensors have a high 
sensitivity to CO2 compared to other gases. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
Metal Oxide are often studied to find the best materials to 
fabricate miniaturized and inexpensive sensors. However, the 
deposition method also influences the properties of the 
sensors. In this work, two methods of BaTiO3 NP deposition 
were compared: screen printing and drop coating. The 
crystalline quality of the deposit was then checked for both 
sensor series. The sensitive layers formed by the BaTiO3 
material were tested as CO2 sensors at an optimized 
temperature of 280°C and three relative humidity values. The 
CO2 concentration is proportional to the increasing resistance 
of the sensitive layer and the sensor baselines are relatively 
stable during the experiment. Moreover, the sensor response 
increases with a lower level of humidity in the carried gases. 
The BaTiO3 sensors have good repeatability feature to CO2 
exposure. For the sensors fabricated by screen printing, the 
response and the recovery times were determined to be 2 min 
30 s and 6 min, respectively, and 2 min and 4 min for the 
sensors with droplet coating layers. This work demonstrates 
a slight improvement in the performances of CO2 sensor with 
the drop coating method. This observation would be due to a 
better control of the homogeneity thickness of the sensitive 
layer.
