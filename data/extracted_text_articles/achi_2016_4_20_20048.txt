Abstract— Most of the spatially moving vehicles and game
controllers use 2-3 degrees of freedom joysticks to manipulate
objects position. However, most of the spatially moving
vehicles have more than 3 degrees of freedom, such as
helicopters, quadrotors, and planes. Therefore, additional
equipment like pedals or buttons is required during the
manipulation. In this study, a passive Stewart platform based
six degrees of freedom joystick was developed to control
spatially moving objects. The Stewart platform mechanism is a
six-degrees of freedom parallel mechanism, which has been
used for simulators. The main challenge of using a parallel
mechanism to manipulate objects is the computational burden
of its forward kinematics.
Therefore, an artificial neural
network was used for the forward kinematic solution of the
Stewart platform mechanism to obtain the fastest response.
Linear potentiometers were used for the Stewart platform legs.
A mathematical model of a quadrotor was used to test the
capability of the joystick. The developed spatial joystick
successfully manipulated the virtual quadrotor model.
Keywords- Spatial joystick; Stewart platform.

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this study is to emphasize the difficulty of
traditional manipulation techniques, which are using a multi-
point control such as a lever, pedals, and collective lever.
This multi-tasking event is obviously difficult considering
learning, teaching and application procedure. Therefore, the
main objective of this study is gathering control tools of any
Spatially Moving Vehicles (SMV) into one hand. The
advantages of one-handed manipulation are investigated with
several scenarios, including reflection of external forces to
SMV to the user’s hand and force feedback control of the
manipulation
mechanism.
In
this
research,
a
linear
potentiometer based Stewart platform (SP) as a man-machine
interface is proposed as a means of mechatronic design,
kinematic
analysis,
and
simulation
environment
to
manipulate SMVs. Through the paper, first, the analysis of
SP mechanism for kinematics and design of the system is
investigated. Then, a “Quadrotor” is modeled using the
Newton-Euler approach, a Proportional Integral Derivative
(PID) controller is applied to the derived model and a user
interface is constructed for operating both the Quadrotor
model
and
Stewart
Platform
Mechanism
(SPM)
simultaneously. Lastly, the virtual Quadrotor model is
manipulated with a real Stewart Platform Joystick.
Stewart-Gough Platform is a parallel mechanism which
was first used as an universal tire test machine and a flight
simulator by V. E. Gough (1956) and D. Stewart (1965),
connecting a stationary lower and a mobile upper platform to
the two ends of six actuators in parallel and obtaining three
translational and three rotational Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
in space [1][2].
Many methods were studied for the solution of the
kinematics of the Stewart Platform Mechanism (SPM). A
major piece of work on solving the forward kinematics of
SPM was using the Bezout method [3]. This method allows
deriving the kinematics from a 16-th degree equation with
one unknown variable. The fact that one needs a numerical
solution
to
obtain
the
final
equation
is
one
of
the
disadvantages of the method. Obtaining the answer from 16
solutions is one of the disadvantages of this method. Another
solution method uses Newton-Rhapson algorithm and this
was presented for solving the forward kinematics, iteratively
[4]. This method usually converges to the solution. However,
if one of the encoder data is not clear or wrong, the solution
is not able to converge. A nonlinear observer was designed
for
predicting
the
3
rotational
and
3
translational
displacements of the SPM by using the state variables of the
mechanism, [5]. Artificial Neural Networks are also used for
solving the forward kinematics of the SPM [6][7]. This
method
is
the
best
suitable
solution
for
real-time
mechanisms.
Human and robot interaction introduces new control
requirements over time [21]. One of them is the force
control. Investigations and comparisons were made on many
force control methods ranging from the simplest to the most
complex [8]. An active stiffness control, which is one of the
force control methods, was applied with the help of a
program for controlling 3 translational and 3 rotational axes
[9]. A pneumatically actuated 6x6 SPM was developed for
endoscopic surgery. The relationship between the endoscope
and the surface was provided by a force control algorithm
[10]. Force control and tactile control methods, which are
very important in terms of human-machine interaction, are
frequently used in rehabilitation systems. 6x6 SPM was
designed for the rehabilitation of the ankle with a user
interface [11]. A 3-axis parallel robot was developed for the
rehabilitation of the wrist and system performance was
investigated including the therapist effect [12][13]. A 3x3
Stewart
platform
manipulator
has
been
proposed
to
manipulate spatially moving vehicles with force feedback
[18]. This mechanism has six linear actuators and a
force/torque sensor to sense the applied force and it
successfully
manipulated
spatially
moving
vehicles.

However, despite its small size, it is still too heavy for
practical applications.
Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) have become the center
of attraction due to their contributions to the military, rescue
and aerospace technologies. An important part of research
and development activities is the 4-rotor aircraft quadrotor,
which has 4 DOF and motion capability at 6 axes. The
Newton-Euler method has been used in many studies for
obtaining the mathematical model of the quadrotor [14][15].
Traditional and robust control algorithms were also applied
to a quadrotor [15][16][17]. A simplified deterministic model
of a quadrotor was presented for investigating the problem of
planning/re-planning [20]. In general, quadrotors and other
aerial vehicles have multiple manipulation points. The main
disadvantage of the developed manipulation mechanism is
that the user must carry out multiple tasks at the same time in
a standard multi-point manipulation. Briefly, the contribution
of this work is that the designed mechanism allows the user
to control all tasks from a single point. Section 2-A describes
the mechatronic design of the passive Stewart platform
mechanism. Section 2-B presents the forward kinematic
solution of the mechanism. Section 2-C describes the user
interface of the software and the specifications of the
mathematical model of the quadrotor. Section 3 consists of
the experimental results and discussions. Section 4 is the
conclusion section and addresses future works.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Mechatronic Design and specifications
The legs of the SP consist of six linear potentiometers.
The resistance of these potentiometers varies from 0 to 5 kΩ 
with the range of 0 to 100 mm. The diameter of the upper
ring (mobile ring) of the SP is 100 mm. The diameter of the
lower ring (stationary ring) is 140 mm.
Figure 1. Experimental setup of the SP joystick.
Potentiometers were connected both to the upper and
lower part of the SP with spherical joints. Analog input ports
of an Atmega powered Arduino Uno board were used both to
obtain voltage values from potentiometers and to send
position and orientation values of the SP to the computer,
which
are
obtained
from
forward
kinematics.
The
experimental setup of the SP joystick can be seen in Fig. 1.
B. Forward Kinematics
Obtaining position and orientation of the mobile ring of
the SP mechanism from the leg lengths can be called forward
kinematics
solution.
Iterative
solutions
and
optimized
solutions to solve the forward kinematics of the SP
mechanism have been proposed. However, iterative solutions
are not suitable for real-time applications because of time
delay. In this study, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are
used to solve the forward kinematics of the SP, which is
suitable for real-time applications because of fast response.
First of all, the workspace of the SP mechanism is scanned
with inverse kinematics to obtain training data, which are the
leg lengths for inputs and position/orientation values for
targets of ANN. Lawenberg & Marquard feed forward back
propagation algorithm is used to train ANN. The architecture
of the network can be seen in Fig. 2. Weight and bias values
of the network are embedded in the controller board after
training of the network.
20 neurons are used inside the
hidden layer. The leg lengths of the SP, which are obtained
from the potentiometer data, are the inputs to the network
(1).
ܮ=[ܮଵܮଶܮଷܮସܮହܮ଺](1)
Figure 2. Artificial neural network architecture of the forward kinematics
of the SP
The output of the hidden layer can be expressed using
(2), where “L” is the leg length vector from (1), “W” and
“B” are the weight and bias vectors obtained from the trained
network, respectively.
The weight value is the gain of an
input of a neuron. This value changes over the training
period of the neuron considering the importance of the input.
As an example, if the effect of an input is important for the
output, the value of the weight of the neuron should be
bigger. The bias value is the minimum stimulation level of
the neuron. The sensitivity of the neuron is inversely
proportional to the bias value. Mentioned ANN coefficients
are decided during the learning process. The output of a
neuron could be a linear or nonlinear function of input
values. In the present study, tangent sigmoid function (a
special case of logistic function) is used for the neurons in
the hidden layer and linear function is used for the neurons in
the output layer.

protocol [22]. A test program was written which includes the
dynamic model of a quadrotor. The controller board of the
SP joystick sends the position and orientation data to the
computer. These outputs of the SP joystick are the reference
inputs of the quadrotor model. A quadrotor mechanism has 6
degrees of freedom where two of them are dependent on
angular motion around its x and y-axes.
That means, if a
quadrotor needs to move along x or y-axes, it must rotate
itself around these axes.
Dynamic model and control strategies of a quadrotor have
been investigated by many of researchers. In this study, the
dynamic model of the quadrotor is constructed by using the
Newton-Euler
approach
[14][15].

Proportional integral derivative (PID) control was used to
control the 4-degree of freedom of the quadrotor, which can
be seen in Fig. 4. The reference values of the controller were
obtained from the output of the forward kinematics of the SP
joystick.
The position feedback of the quadrotor was
obtained from the dynamic equations of the quadrotor. The
PID coefficients of the controllers were decided after a series
of simulation considering the settling time, overshoot and
steady state error values.

Figure 5. User interface of the test program
The developed user interface of the test program can be
seen in Fig. 5. The user interface allows the user to observe
both the incoming data from the SP and the action of the
quadrotor model considering the reference data coming from
the SP joystick.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The dynamic model and the control of the quadrotor were
tested with the developed interface. Reference values of 10
m for displacement along the z-axis, 45 degrees for
displacement around the z-axis, 15 degrees for displacement
around the x-axis, -15 degrees for displacement around the y-
axis were used. The response of the controller is shown in
Fig. 6. The dynamic model of the quadrotor successfully
reaches the reference values.

Figure 6. Response of the PID controllers
Manipulation of the dynamic quadrotor model was also
tested with SP joystick. The reference values of the angular
displacements of the quadrotor model are the displacement
of the SP around the x, y and z-axes. The reference value of
the linear displacement of the quadrotor along the z-axis
was the multiplication of displacement of the SP along the
z-axis with a coefficient. The test was performed by one
inexperienced user. Moving the quadrotor model separately
around the x, y, z-axis and along the z-axis was requested
from the user.

reference values from the SP. Fig. 7, 8, 9, 10 depict the
displacement of both the quadrotor model and the SP
joystick. The dynamics of the quadrotor and the PID
controller cause a time delay between the reference values
and the position of the quadrotor. This settling time of the
quadrotor can be clearly seen in the mentioned figures.

CONCLUSIONS
Manipulation
of
the
spatially
moving
objects
is
important considering both the cost of the aerial vehicles
and safety of passengers. Multiple manipulations might
distract the user. The reason for many accidents is the
distraction of the pilot or the user. Therefore, a passive 6
DOF Stewart platform based joystick was designed for
single point manipulation. Classical iterative solutions of the
forward kinematics of the SP cause time delays and errors
considering real-time applications. Therefore, ANN was
used for forward kinematics solution of the SP. A dynamic
model
of
a
quadrotor
was
derived
for
testing
the
manipulation of the SP joystick. PID controllers were used
to control the axes of the quadrotor. A user interface was
built containing the dynamic model of the quadrotor.
Finally, the quadrotor model was successfully manipulated
from a single point with the SP joystick.
It is very probable that the development of one point
manipulation will become the center of attraction for most
disciplines, including simulation or game development. The
