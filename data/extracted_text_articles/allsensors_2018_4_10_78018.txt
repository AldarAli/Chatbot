Abstract—In this paper, we focus on nitrogen dioxide detection
at room temperature to avoid thermal degradation on flexible
substrates. We propose nitrogen dioxide detection at room
temperature by zinc oxide nanocrystals deposited on rigid
substrate by spin coating from colloidal solution as sensitive
layer for air quality monitoring. We investigated gas sensing
properties
at
low
post-annealed
temperature
and
under
continuous Ultra-Violet illumination for working at room
temperature with a process compatible with flexible substrates.

INTRODUCTION
Nitrogen Oxides (NO) are produced by petrol or diesel
burning engines and coil/oil furnaces. NO is a poisonous,
odourless, colourless gas. Once it is mixed with air, it
quickly combines forming nitrogen dioxides (NO2), which
is highly toxic, reddish brown gas with a very pungent
odour. NO2 is a major component of the outdoor air
pollution. The need for air quality monitoring demands the
development of NOx sensitive sensors under 3 ppm [1]. The
Metal OXide gas sensors (MOX) are propitious due to their
high sensitivity at a low cost process. Among MOX, Zinc
Oxide (ZnO) based materials have shown outstanding
electrical, chemical and sensory characteristics [2]. We
aimed to fabricate MOX sensors on flexible substrate to fit
shapes on a smart object for NO2 monitoring. However,
most of flexible substrates do not resist to temperature
higher than 120 °C. Previous studies have shown detection
under ozone gas as low as 35 ppb [3] and depending on
filter nature, O3 can be totally trapped while NO2 can pass
over a specific concentration range [4]. In this study, our
main purpose was to point out that, using continuous Ultra-
Violet (UV) light on the ZnO NanoCrystals (NCs), the
sensing responses at room temperature are also enhanced for
NO2 detection.
In Section II, the sensor fabrication will be detailed and
the results will be discussed in Section III. We conclude the
paper in Section IV.
II.
DECRIPTION OF APPROACH AND TECHNIQUES
This description is composed of two parts: one is the
sensing film fabrication; the other is the measurement
system set-up.
A. Gas sensors
Our gas sensor consists of Ti/Pt interdigitated electrodes
(5 and 100 nm, respectively) deposited on Si/SiO2 by
magnetron sputtering. Figure 1(a) shows two solutions based
on ZnO NCs with a diameter of about 5 nm: one named S1
without EthanolAmine (EA) with a milky white aspect
indicating the presence of agglomerates [4] and the second
one named S2 with EA with a transparent aspect. These
solutions (S1 and S2) were deposited by spin coating on
rigid substrates during 30s at 2000 rpm/min. Figure 1(b)
presents an optical images of a sensor based on ZnO NCs at
30 mg/mL with 0.2 vol.% of EA.

at 30 mg/mL with or without 0.2 vol.% of EA. (b) Sample image with ZnO
NC 30 mg/mL with EA after a post annealing at 80°C.
Previous studies have shown that 0.2% volume of EA, a
short-chain surfactant, gives aggregate-free solutions [5].
After mixing ZnO NCs with 0.2 vol.% of EA in isopropanol,
the EA molecules spontaneously graft on the surface of ZnO
NCs and enhance the particles solubility.
The small sized nanocrystals to form sensing thin films is
beneficial for the surface-area-to-volume ratio to adsorb gas
molecules. To be compatible with a flexible substrate, a low
post-annealing temperature (80 °C) was done for 30 min.

B. Setup
0.1 V DC voltage was applied to the sample while the
electrical resistance was monitored using a Keithley Model
2450 SourceMeter Source Measure Unit (SMU) Instrument
(Keithley, U.S.A.). Dry air was used as both the reference
and the carrier gas (it means no humidity RH = 0%). A
constant total flow was maintained at 500 Standard Cubic
Centimeters per Minute (SCCM) via mass flow controllers.
In order to find the best operating conditions, the gas
detections were carried out in a closed chamber under 30 s
exposures to NO2 by measuring the resistance through the
sensitive material in dark and temperature excitations (up to
300°C) or using UV light (λ = 325 nm) at room 
temperature. We used a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) for
UV illumination situated at 10 mm from the sensing material
to obtain more photo generated charge carriers.
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
We prepared two different sensitive layers with resulting
layer thicknesses measured by a contact profilometer Dektak
XTS (Bruker, Germany) equipped with a stylus of 2 µm
radius. The sensitive layer without EA deposited by spin
coating is around 80 nm thick. The sensitive layer with EA
realized by spin-coating at the same speed (2000 rpm/min
during 30 s) is around 50 nm. The gas response is defined in
(1) as the ratio of the resistance change on the surface of the
gas sensor before and after being exposed to NO2:
R = RNO2   / R
     a
(1)
where Ra is the sensor resistance through dry airflow and
RNO2 the sensor resistance in presence of NO2.
Figure 2 presents sensor responses of thin film obtained
with solution S2 and post annealed at 300°C to test working
temperatures up to 275°C. The sensors were exposed 30 s to
2 ppm of NO2 in dark for four working temperatures: 25°C,
100°C, 200°C and 275°C.

This result indicates no resistance variation at room
temperature in dark and an optimum working temperature
obtained at 200°C. It confirms that sensors based on ZnO
NCs
as
most
MOX
sensors
need
a
high
operating
temperature to enable the adsorption and desorption process.
This is also in agreement with our previous studies and this
optimum is lower than for ozone detection found around
300°C in dark [3][6]. To be able to work at room
temperature, a continuous UV illumination is needed. Figure
3 shows the sensors responses for four concentrations under
continuous UV light at 25°C.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This work reported an ambient temperature way to detect
NO2 molecules by sensors based on ZnO NCs thin films. It
opens a new way to develop NO2 sensors on flexible
substrate. For next studies, ZnO NCs sensors will be
processed on flexible substrate and tested in presence of
various
gases
at
room
temperature
assisted
by
light
activation.
