Abstract—In this study, we recruited 20 college students who
are video games enthusiasts and assigned them to two groups,
namely, video game playing (as a testing group), and book-
reading (as a control group). We use profile of mood state
(POMS)
scale
and
electrocardiography
(ECG)
patch
physiological signal device as tools to measure moods and heart
rate variability (HRV) before and after the experiment, and we
assessed the effects of playing video games on physical and
mental health. We expect that the low frequency (LF) and high
frequency (HF) powers for HRV in testing group to be
significantly higher than the value in the control one after the
experiment and to have 30 minutes duration in the following
sleep stage. We show that playing video games may excite the
sympathetic and parasympathetic systems during and after
playing. This will disturb sleep and increase the risk of chronic
diseases. Based on these findings, we recommend avoiding
playing video games for extended periods of time.
Keywords—video game; mood; heart rate variability (HRV);
sympathetic; parasympathetic.
I. BACKGROUND
As computers and the Internet have become more
popular, teenagers and students often fall vulnerable to
cyber risks [1]. Researchers [2][3][4] who studied junior and
senior high school students have found that those who
indulged in the cyber world are more likely to confront
health, academic or even family problems. Since video
games is one of the key reasons behind cyber time, it has
played a more dominant role even against sleep. Other
studies point out that devoted gamers lose their temper
easier,
and
often
exhibit
signs
of
aggression,
absentmindedness, lack of discipline, low self-esteem,
plummeting social skills, and anxiety toward the society.
A. Motivation
Compared to other stages of personal development, the
teenage stage is not only a turning point in one’s life, it also
lays down a foundation for a durable healthy lifestyle. With
a motive to promote health, this research is dedicated to
look into the physical and psychological experiences of
teenagers playing video games, and how the video games
impact their physical and psychological well-being, self-
esteem, and personal relationships. With this research, we
assess the video game impacts on players’ physical and
emotional conditions, and try to re-evaluate the recreational
and entertaining merits of video games.
B. Objectives
Objectives of this research are as follows:
•
To use profile of mood state (POMS) scale to measure
the changes of emotions before and after playing video
games.
•
To
find
the
effects
on
the
sympathetic
and
parasympathetic systems before and after playing video
games exhibited in heart rate variability (HRV).
•
To find the time duration of effects after playing video
games.

C. Limitations
Given restrictions in time and manpower, this research is
subject to limits and has a restricted scope, as follows:
•
As subjects of this research are college students, and the
desired trial period begins when the activity starts and
ends when the person goes to sleep, only students
residing in central Taiwan are selected for this research.
•
The research was designed to take place when college
students play video games, with the trial period between
9 and 12 pm, followed by a sleeping period of about five
hours, for a total of around 9 hours.
•
Given limitations in time, budget and manpower, this
research consists of 20 subjects. Each subject is assigned
to video game playing group once (as a testing group),
and motionless book-reading group (as a control group),
and for a total of sample collected data of 40.

RESEARCH STEPS
This research used POMS scale and electrocardiography
(ECG) patch to measure moods and HRV for effects of
playing video games on mental and physical health. The
processes of the experiment related to the testing and control
groups are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively,
with each group undertaking three steps, as follows:
A. Testing Group
•
Subjects fill out a questionnaire on POMS, before they
do the ECG device for the trial.
•
After a ten-minute recess, subjects proceed into one-
hour video game playing, and they repeat the entire
process consisting of recess and game playing.
•
When the second-round of game-playing is finished, the
subjects take another ten-minute recess and then fill out
the POMS for the second time. After another ten-minute
recess, they sleep.
B. Control Group
•
Subjects fill out two questionnaires: Questionnaire on
Internet Addiction and POMS, before they do the ECG
device for the trial.
•
After a ten-minute recess, subjects proceed into a one-
hour sedentary reading, and repeat the entire process
consisting of recess and reading.
•
When the second-round sedentary reading is finished,
the subjects take another ten-minute recess and then fill
out the POMS for the second time. After another ten-
minute recess, they sleep.

III. RESEARCH METHODS
The physiological signals obtained from the ECG patch
are digitalized into figures, before being analyzed by SPSS
statistical software. Analysis are given on the physiological
signals generated from the video game playing/book-
reading of the testing and control groups, and including all
the sleep stage.
The independent sample t test is used to compare the
PMOS data and physiological signals before video game
playing/book-reading of two group to ensure absence of
discrepancy. However, paired-t test is used to test the data
before and after experiment for each group to examine the
effect of video game playing/book-reading.
IV. PROJECTED RESULTS
Our projected results are shown in Figure 4, Figure 5,

V. CONCLUSION
The conclusion inferred from this research is the
following:
•
Based on the PMOS data collected before and after
video game playing, the scores for fatigue of the testing
stage increase notably, while the scores for vigor fall
significantly. This dramatic change in scores is absent in
the PMOS data of the control stage. It is concluded that
after long-time video game playing, players start to feel
higher level of fatigue and lower level of vigor.
•
The physiological signals collected from the testing
stage are not significantly different from that of the
control stage. Still, the testing stage generates stronger
physiological signals like LF and Lfnu, against the
signals generated by the control stage. This suggests
that, after long-time video game playing, players start to
experience sympathetic and parasympathetic elevations.
•
Within a thirty minutes period before sleeping, the
testing stage generate higher LF, Lfnu and HF against
the control stage. The assenting LFnu implies elevation
of the sympathetic and parasympathetic energies, of
which the former imposes greater impact on subjects.
We thus can conclude that after playing the video
games,
players
start
to
experience
temporary
sympathetic elevations that prevent sleeping or leads to
poor
sleeping
quality,
and
consequentially
impose
detrimental impacts on the physical well-being of
players. That is why video game players should avoid
playing video games for a long time or in the night so
that their physical and mental well-being can be better
protected.
