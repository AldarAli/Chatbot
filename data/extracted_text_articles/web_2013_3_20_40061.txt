Abstract—The paper presents a method of describing seman-
tics of 3D web content with RDFa—Resource Description Frame-
work in Attributes. Dependencies between 3D web components
are typically more complex than dependencies between standard
web pages as they may relate to different aspects of the 3D
content—spatial, temporal, structural, logical and behavioural.
Semantic Web standards help in making data understandable
and processable for both humans and computers. RDFa is
an RDF-compliant standard designed for creating semantic
descriptions embedded into web resources, but it has been
indented mostly for 2D web pages and not for 3D web content.
The main contribution of this paper is a method of creating
lightweight attribute-based built-in semantic descriptions of X3D
web content. The method utilizes the standard syntax and
structure of X3D documents providing a mapping of RDFa
attributes to metadata nodes in 3D models. Due to the use of
the standardized solutions, the proposed method enables ﬂexible
semantic descriptions of content for use in a variety of 3D
applications on the web.
Index Terms—3D content, semantic description, X3D, RDFa,

I. INTRODUCTION
Interactive 3D technologies enable signiﬁcant progress in
the quality and functionality of human-computer interfaces.
The widespread use of interactive 3D technologies, including
virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), has been
recently enabled by signiﬁcant progress in computing hard-
ware performance, increasing availability of versatile input-
output devices as well as rapid growth in the available network
bandwidth. However, the potential of 3D/VR/AR technologies
in everyday applications can be fully exploited only if ac-
companied by the development of efﬁcient and easy-to-use
methods of creation, publication and sharing of interactive 3D
multimedia content.
Building,
searching
and
combining
distributed
three-
dimensional interactive content is a much more complex and
challenging task than in the case of standard web pages.
The relationships between components of an interactive three-
dimensional virtual scene may include, in addition to its basic
meaning and presentation form, spatial, temporal, structural,
logical, and behavioural aspects.
Opportunities for widespread dissemination of 3D content
may be signiﬁcantly increased by applying the Semantic Web
approach. Research on the Semantic Web has been initiated by
T. Berners-Lee and the W3C (World-Wide Web Consortium)
in 2001. This research aims at evolutionary development of
the current web towards a distributed semantic database, link-
ing structured content and documents. Semantic description
of web content makes it understandable for both humans
and computers, achieving a new quality in building web
applications that can ”understand” the meaning of particular
components of content and services, as well as their relation-
ships, leading to much better methods of searching, reasoning,
combining and presenting web content.
The Resource Description Framework (RDF) [1] has been
developed as the foundation of the Semantic Web, enabling
semantic descriptions of various types of web resources. The
Resource Description Framework in Attributes (RDFa) [2] is
an RDF-compliant solution designed for creating lightweight
semantic descriptions of web content with attributes built into
described documents.
To enable 3D content description on the web, a number
of proprietary data formats have been devised. In contrast to
them, the Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) [3]
and its successor—the Extensible 3D (X3D) [4] have been
developed by the Web3D Consortium as open standards. The
openness determines the common use of X3D in a variety
of applications, as well as attempts to combine it with other
open standards, in particular for the Semantic Web. Currently,
X3D provides basic mechanisms for including metadata into
3D models, but it does not standardize creation of semantic
descriptions of resources. In turn, RDFa is intended mostly
for 2D web pages and not for 3D web content. Embedding
semantics directly into 3D content has several important
advantages in comparison to decoupling semantics from 3D
models. In particular, this enables more concise semantic de-
scriptions, faster and less complicated authoring and analysis
of semantically described 3D content, and permits storing the
3D content in simpler databases.
The main contribution of this paper is a method of creating
lightweight attribute-based built-in semantic descriptions of
X3D web content. The method utilizes the standard syntax
and structure of X3D documents, providing a mapping of
RDFa attributes to metadata nodes in 3D models. Using the
standard syntax and structure of X3D documents preserves the
compatibility of the proposed approach with available X3D
browsers. Due to the use of the standardized solutions, the
method enables ﬂexible semantic descriptions and widespread
dissemination of content for use in a variety of 3D applications
on the web.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section
II presents the X3D standard in terms of metadata description.
Section III provides an overview of the state of the art in the

domain of semantic descriptions of web resources, in particular
3D web content. Section IV presents a mapping between RDFa
attributes and X3D metadata nodes that enables lightweight
semantic descriptions of 3D web content. Finally, Section V
concludes the paper and indicates future works.
II. METADATA DESCRIPTION IN X3D
There are two types of metadata descriptions in X3D
documents: metadata describing the whole X3D document and
metadata describing 3D content included in the document—
elements reﬂecting the geometry, appearance and behaviour of
3D objects in a scene.
Example X3D content described by metadata is presented
in Listing 1. The ﬁrst group of metadata elements—describing
the X3D document—are contained in the head—the ﬁrst
X3D element preceding the Scene node. It may include
metadata indicating additional required components (line 2)
and expressing the semantics using [name, content]
tuples (3-4)—alike in (X)HTML documents.

The second group of metadata elements are structured
according to the abstract X3DMetadataObject interface
deﬁned in the X3D speciﬁcation [4]. The interface is inherited
by concrete metadata nodes of different types: integer, ﬂoat,
double, string, as presented in Fig. 1. These nodes derive two
attributes from the X3DMetadataObject: the name of the
metadata ﬁeld and an optional reference to a speciﬁca-
tion deﬁning the unambiguous ﬁeld name. The additional
value attribute is an array of values of the appropriate
type. A speciﬁc node is the MetadataSet containing an
array of metadata nodes of different types. Besides inheriting
from the X3DMetadataObject, the metadata nodes are
also descendants of the abstract X3DNode that includes an
X3DMetadataObject element. Hence, each metadata node
may be described by a nested metadata sub-node. Furthermore,
all elements included in the X3D document (concrete nodes)
implement the X3DNode interface, thus all elements of the
described virtual scene may have metadata speciﬁed.

In the example in Listing 1, the shape is described by three
elements: geometry, appearance and metadata. The whole
semantics is enclosed in the MetadataSet and includes both
simple (subject, creator, description—lines 9-10)
as well as complex (Mass, 11) nested nodes. Every node is
assigned a name and a reference to the name deﬁnition (a
web document). The containerField associates the node
with the appropriate ﬁeld of its parent node.
III. SEMANTIC DESCRIPTIONS OF WEB CONTENT
In this section, the state of the art concerning semantic
descriptions of web content is presented. In particular, ba-
sic techniques for describing semantics of web documents,
methods of attribute-based semantic descriptions as well as
semantic descriptions of 3D objects are considered. The ﬁrst
two domains are currently closely related to web pages, while
the last one constitutes an emerging ﬁeld of research on
semantically described virtual and augmented reality.
A. Foundations for the Semantic Web
The primary technique for data semantics description on
the web is the Resource Description Framework (RDF) [1]—
a standard devised by the W3C. RDF introduces general rules
for making statements about resources. Each statement is
comprised of three elements: a subject (a resource described
by the statement), a predicate (a property of the subject) and
an object (the value of the property).
An example statement expressed in RDF is: ”Bob (subject)
likes (predicate) shopping (object)”. According to the RDF
speciﬁcation [1], the subject may be either a resource identiﬁed
by a URI (not necessary accessible via HTTP) or a blank node.
64

WEB 2013 : The First International Conference on Building and Exploring Web Based Environments

The object may be either a resource with a URI or a literal. To
ensure unambiguous representation of the relationship between
the subject and the resource, the predicate must have a URI
assigned. RDF data sets may be encoded in different formats
such as XML, N-Triples, Turtle and JSON.
RDF introduces classes (as types of resources), containers
and lists to provide basic concepts for semantic descriptions.
However, these notions are often insufﬁcient for describing
the semantics of complex resources. To overcome limitations
of RDF, the RDF Schema (RDFS) [5] and the Web Ontology
Language (OWL) [6] have been proposed as W3C standards
based on RDF, providing higher expressiveness for semantic
descriptions of web resources, e.g., hierarchy of classes and
properties, constraints, property restrictions as well as opera-
tions on sets.
While RDF and RDF-based techniques permit creation of
ontologies and knowledge bases, SPARQL [7] is a language
for querying RDF data sources. To provide a common space
for identiﬁers of resources and properties on the web, a number
of ontologies and knowledge bases have been proposed for
various domains, e.g., describing relationships between people
[8], media resources [9], images, audio, video [10], quantities,
units, dimensions [11] and chemical compounds [12].
B. Attribute-based methods of creating semantic descriptions
It is often desirable to combine both resources and their
semantics in a single web document, e.g., in a web proﬁle
with personal data and relationships between people. In such
cases, web documents (e.g., (X)HTML) may be enriched with
additional attributes describing data semantics.
Among a few approaches to attribute-based semantic de-
scriptions of web content, the Resource Description Frame-
work in Attributes (RDFa) is the most powerful one and has
been standardized by the W3C. RDFa [2] deﬁnes a set of
markup attributes extending web documents with semantic
descriptions compliant with RDF:
1) about, src—the URI of a subject (external or em-
bedded into the document) described by the metadata;
2) typeof—a list of types of the subject;
3) property, rel, rev—a list of predicates speci-
fying properties, relationships and reverse relationships
between resources;
4) href, resource—the navigable/non-navigable URI
of an object resource;
5) content—an object resource speciﬁed as a literal
overriding the value of the element when using the
property attribute;
6) datatype—the optional data type of the literal, that
may be speciﬁed for the property value;
7) vocab, prefix—a vocabulary/list of preﬁxes used
to abbreviate URIs of resources and properties speciﬁed
in the metadata;
8) inList—a list of literals/URIs associated with the
predicate.
An example web page described with RDFa attributes is
presented in Listing 2. The document is described by metadata
in the head element (title and creator—lines 2-4).
The presented object (a sculpture) has a URI and a type (5),
properties (subject and Mass, 7-8) as well as a relationship
with an external resource (an image—6). In the document,
preﬁxes to global (1) and local (5) namespaces are deﬁned
and used.
Listing 2.

content=”DIT”
/>

<body><div

ty peof =”

<img

src=” s c u l p t u r e . g i f ” />
7
<span
p r o p e r t y =” dc : s u b j e c t ”
content=” s c u l p t u r e ” />
8
<span
p r o p e r t y =” qudt : Mass”
content=” 0.5 ”
d a t a t y p e =”
xsd : f l o a t ” />
9
</ div></ body>
10
</ html>
In some cases, it is desirable to decouple semantics from
data and present it as a separate RDF document (e.g., to
load into a triplestore). The Gleaning Resource Descriptions
from Dialects of Languages (GRDDL) [13] is a W3C standard
designed for this purpose.
Microdata [14] is another approach proposed by W3C to
embed semantics into web content. Alike RDFa, Microdata
describes triples comprised of the subject, property and object
using attributes for specifying types, scopes, ids, properties and
references. To enable common semantics on the web, some
vocabularies have been deﬁned for Microdata to describe, e.g.,
people, organizations, products, etc. [15][16].
Microformats [17] are a solution for describing metadata
embedded into web pages, that is simpler than RDFa and
Microdata. Microformats make use of the class and rel
attributes to express classiﬁcation and relationships for web
resources. These attributes may be built into various (X)HTML
elements such as span, div, ul, etc.
C. Semantic descriptions of 3D models
Several works have been conducted to combine X3D content
with semantic descriptions. In [18], an integration of X3D and
OWL using scene-independent ontologies and the concept of
semantic zones have been proposed to enable querying 3D
scenes at different levels of semantic details and implement
a guided tour through the Venetian Palace. In [19], interfaces
for annotating 3D worlds in X3D and a search module have
been described. A few projects have been conducted on
extending MPEG-7 with semantic annotations of 3D objects.
In [20], some descriptors have been introduced to optimize
speciﬁcation of semantics of X3D objects, in particular their
sizes, types, curvatures, etc. The works [21][22] consider a
generic semantic annotation model for describing semantics
of X3D content using MPEG-7. In [23], 3D digital assets in
COLLADA have been combined with semantic tags to present
sculptures and monuments. In [24], ontology-based RDF tags
are separated but linked to 3D models via identiﬁers to enable
web presentation of museum artefacts. A generic modelling
framework for metadata based on semantic web standards and
65

selected multimedia formats has been presented in [25]. Some
core patterns have been designed for describing provenance,
structure and values of objects. A video search engine for vehi-
cles described by a set of attributes has been presented in [26].
Some other solutions are devoted to structured composition
of interactive behaviour-rich 3D web applications [27]-[29],
describing interactivity of 3D objects [30], their interfaces
[31], as well as ﬁnding 3D objects by their properties [32].
The aforementioned projects address different aspects of se-
mantics of multimedia content in various application domains.
However, they do not focus on standardized built-in attribute-
based solutions for lightweight inclusion of metadata in web
resources. Embedding metadata directly into 3D content has
a few important advantages in comparison to approaches
that decouple resources from metadata describing them. First,
with embedded metadata, 3D models are unambiguously and
inextricably linked with their descriptions. Second, this enables
more concise semantic descriptions as well as faster and less
complicated authoring and analysis of semantically described
3D content. Furthermore, it facilitates combining the semantic
descriptions of 3D content with descriptions of web pages that
embed the content. Finally, it permits storing the 3D content
in structurally simpler databases.
IV. MAPPING OF RDFA ATTRIBUTES TO X3D METADATA
NODES
To enable lightweight attribute-based built-in semantic de-
scriptions of 3D web content, a mapping of RDFa attributes to
X3D metadata nodes is proposed in this paper. The presented
approach utilizes the standard syntax and structure of X3D
documents and decouples descriptions of the semantics of 3D
components from descriptions of their geometry, appearance
and behaviour by putting the metadata into additional elements
embedded in X3D nodes (as opposed to RDFa attributes nested
in HTML tags).
The mapping between the RDFa attributes and the X3D
metadata nodes is depicted in Fig. 2. Example X3D content
described with RDFa attributes is presented in Listing 3. The
scene (lines 11-65) presents a room in a museum with a shelf
(12-34) on which there is a sculpture (35-51) and a complex
model of a plough (52-64). Some geometrical and behavioural
elements and attributes have been omitted as they are not
crucial in the context of the presented method.

For the ﬁrst type of metadata, the mapping is easy, as the
resulting meta elements are equivalent to meta elements in a
web page (5-10). The standard to which a particular semantic
description conforms may be indicated by the appropriate
meta node (9) to enable proper interpretation of the docu-
ment.
The second type of metadata in X3D documents, in the
presented method, is used for describing the semantics of both
real objects and their corresponding 3D models. The mapping
is performed between RDFa attributes that are intended for
(X)HTML web pages and metadata nodes of X3D documents.
As a web page may include many (X)HTML elements with
RDFa attributes, an X3D document may incorporate a number
of XML nodes corresponding to different components of a 3D
scene, which may be described by metadata nodes.
The primary unit of the semantic description of such re-
sources is the MetadataSet node. The presented method
encompasses all the RDFa attributes mentioned in Section
III-B, putting their names and values into attributes of X3D
metadata nodes. A semantically described X3D element con-
tains a MetadataSet node (in addition to nodes expressing
its geometry, appearance and behaviour) that may include mul-
tiple metadata sub-nodes to which particular RDFa attributes
are mapped as follows:
1) typeof and about/src are mapped to the name and
value attributes of the MetadataSet, respectively.
Both attributes are optional and they are used in the
same way for real objects such as a worker, a sculpture,
a museum (28), and virtual objects, e.g., a document, an
image, a 3D model (15). The type should be deﬁned by
a data structure with properties. Data types and attributes
used in the presented example belong to FOAF, Media
Resources, Dublin Core and QUDT domains that are
intended for RDF. New item properties may be added
to the MetadataSet independently of the speciﬁed
data type.
The optional value attribute speciﬁes the URI of the
described web resource (not necessary navigable). Since
the method enables description of the semantics of real
objects and their 3D models, both types of resources
are referenced in the same manner. If a particular 3D
component is to be linkable, it has to be assigned a
URI in the X3D DEF attribute (11, 35). Such a solution
has three important implications. First, it conforms to
the language speciﬁcation. Second, it permits referenc-
ing both local 3D resources—through their URIs—and
remote nested 3D components—preceding their URIs
by HTTP URIs of their parent web resources. Third,
any real or virtual object may be described by any
MetadataSet independently of their relative location
on the web. In particular, a MetadataSet no longer
needs to describe only the parent 3D component.
If the about/src attribute is not mapped for a par-
ticular MetadataSet node (no URI of the described
resource is speciﬁed), the MetadataSet represent a
blank node (22-25). Blank nodes are used in semantic
descriptions when a subject is in a relationship with a
complex resource described by multiple ﬁelds, that has
no URI speciﬁed. In the presented example, a blank node
is used to describe the creator of the 3D model of the
shelf.
2) vocab (46), prefix (40)—are optionally mapped to
the reference attribute of the MetadataSet. Both
the attributes are applied to the entire scope of the node,
including all its descendants. The prefix attribute may
include a list. In the presented example, these attributes
simplify using FOAF (47) and quantity (41) deﬁnitions.
3) property/rel/rev
and
content/href/
resource attributes are mapped to the name and
value attributes of a typed node. For properties,
nodes of all types may be utilized (integer, ﬂoat,
double, string), while relationships (rel and rev
attributes) are only reﬂected by MetadataString
nodes. To differentiate navigable from non-navigable
URIs of objects given in relationships, an additional
MetadataString sub-node is introduced with the
name set to URI-type and the value set to href or
to resource. In the presented example, relationships
describe links to external content (30, 42, 47) and
hierarchical
dependencies
between
3D
components
(56, 61), while properties describe various features of
resources such as descriptions, formats, medium, etc.
(16-18, 29). When no value attribute is given for the
property, the descendant blank node is used as its value,
e.g., contributor described by multiple properties (22-
25). To describe some additional aspects of a property,
sub-nodes may be introduced, e.g., for mapping the
RDFa datatype attribute when typed metadata nodes
are not sufﬁcient to express sophisticated types (19).
4) inList—since X3D metadata nodes may have several
values separated with spaces, this attribute is simply
mapped to such an array. In the example, the shelf is
made of wood and metal (30).

The meaning of particular X3D attributes in the proposed
method differs minimally from their semantics described in
the X3D speciﬁcation. However, X3D metadata nodes have
been designed for simple metadata description and not for
use with Semantic Web standards. The small extension of
the meaning of their attributes enables full adoption of the
presented technique without disturbing the current syntax
and structure of X3D and conﬂicting with widely-used 3D
browsers.
An approach alternative to the presented one could be based
on the ordinary extension of X3D syntax with RDFa at-
tributes embedded into particular X3D nodes (alike in HTML).
Although little more concise, such solution is outperformed
by the proposed method in terms of the compatibility with
available X3D browsers and ﬂexibility in describing 3D com-
ponents distributed across the web. Despite the difference be-
tween the syntaxes of these approaches, the resulting semantic
descriptions are equivalent in terms of expressiveness.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this paper, a method of creating lightweight attribute-
based built-in semantic descriptions of 3D web content has
been proposed. Although several solutions have been devel-
oped for the Semantic Web, they are intended mostly for
describing standard web pages. Lack of commonly accepted
approach to describing semantics of 3D resources is one of the
important obstacles for widespread creation, dissemination and
reuse of 3D content on the web.
The presented method combines RDFa with X3D and it is
compliant with well-established web standards. It provides a
bidirectional mapping between RDFa attributes that are used in
typical web pages and metadata nodes used in X3D documents
without introducing any modiﬁcations to their standard syntax
and structure. Both descriptions are semantically equivalent.
Embedding semantics into the described documents permits
adoption of the method without the need for implementing
additional repositories and tools.
Possible directions of future research incorporate several
facets. First, additional mappings should be elaborated for
other formats of attribute-based semantic descriptions, in par-
ticular for Microdata and Microformats. Second, the proposed
approach stresses the compatibility with available 3D browsers
but not with RDFa parsers. To harvest metadata from seman-
tically described X3D documents and evaluate the proposed
method, a GRDDL agent should be implemented (e.g., based
on XSLT transformations). Third, a SPARQL engine could
be developed to enable querying X3D models. Finally, the
method may be combined with semantics derived from spatial,
temporal, structural, logical and behavioural components of 3D
models.
