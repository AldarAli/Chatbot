Abstract—This paper utilized a user-centered design approach 
as the foundation for technology in dementia care in order to 
improve the quality of telemedicine service. A status-quo 
analysis and questionnaire survey were conducted to explore 
the actual needs of the elders in using the lost seeking devices 
and the problems they encountered. 37 caregivers for people 
with dementia were surveyed. Through analysis and induction, 
3 problems were identified: poor information transmission, low 
user acceptance, individual material security anxiety. 2-4 
improvement proposals are suggested for each problem.

INTRODUCTION 
In the e-era, e-Health is an important issue. Telemedicine 
service is a means to realize the e-health. In order to have 
good quality of telemedicine service, the needs and 
requirements of users are essential elements. Nowadays, 
some institutes apply this kind of service through lost 
seeking devices to help find lost people, especially for 
dementia-patients. However, the users’ behaviors and 
opinions related with these systems and devices are still 
unknown. Based on the user-centered design (UCD) concept, 
this paper aimed to find the needs and requirements from 
users, and expected the results could be used as the 
foundation for technology in dementia-patient care. 
Dementia is now recognized as a global issue of 
increasing importance, affecting some 24 million people 
around the world [10]. In Taiwan, the population of 
demented agedness has been up to a million. People with 
dementia experience progressive cognitive impairments that 
typically begin with short term memory problems but can 
encompass language deficits, difficulties initiating tasks, 
planning, 
monitoring 
and 
regulating 
behavior, 
and 
visuospatial difficulties [9]. The neuropsychiatric changes in 
dementia are nearly universal and may result in extremely 
challenging management problems [14], and heavy burden 
on caregivers.  
However, wandering behavior is the reason that many 
family members unable to take care the demented elders in 
the house [2][15]. The most controversial application of 
technology for dementia care in e-Health and telemedicine 
services is seen in the application of tracking and 
surveillance equipment. Proponents of these technologies 
argue that the technologies reduce caregiver stress and 
increase individual autonomy since they allow the person 
with dementia having freedom to move around as they wish 
[12][13]. Critics however argue that these technologies are 
an infringement of people’s civil liberties and undermine the 
personhood of the individual [8]. However, assistive 
technology is a key aspect of improving healthcare. Bjørneby 
et al. [5] stated that the technologies should: 1) give a feeling 
of independence to the person; 2) support the person in 
making choices; 3) have a positive impact on his/her life; 4) 
support skills maintained or do not emphasize lost skills; 5) 
not focus on the user as a person with disabilities, but 
supports the self image of being a person with abilities; 6) 
remind the solutions that existed before; 7) the use of the 
products is possible by the information visible/available at all 
times. They [4][5] further elaborated on this and presented an 
adaptation of design for all principles in development of 
assistive technology for people with dementia.  
The existing technologies and systems are often 
expensive and unsuitable. Choosing the appropriate assistive 
technology is not always easy and there is a wide range of 
different technologies that can be adapted and used for 
people with dementia to cope with the practical problems 
encountered in daily life [6]. The UCD model advocates a 
design process that involves users in the whole design 
process in order to match the product to the user 
requirements and to increase its practical use [13][7]. This 
study adopted the UCD approach to investigate the processes, 
devices, and methods employed in dementia care, especially 
for lost seeking.  
This paper is divided into six main sections. Section 1 
provides some background information about the beginning 
of the project. Section 2 outlines the overview solutions for 
getting lost or wandering. Section 3 describes the interview 
with questionnaire. Section 4 summarizes results and 
analysis. Section 5 delineates some of the problems 
encountered. Finally, the implications of findings are 
discussed. 
II. 
OVERVIEW SOLUTIONS FOR GETTING LOST OR 
WANDERING 
A. Wandering Behavior 
The main character of dementia is the decline of their 
memory and learning comprehension [1]. Due to the problem 
of memory and orientation, wandering behaviors and easily-
to-be-lost always happens on dementia-sufferers [18]. There 
are 37% of dementia-patients developing to have wandering 
behaviors [3]. When they are lost, it is very important to help 
them and prevent them from wandering. Today, to the family 
members of the missing elders, they can only report to the 
Seeking Center of Missing Elders, police, newspapers, mass 
media, and broadcast or post the missing person’s photos.

Table I gives an overview of the solutions for getting lost or 
wandering behavior as described in the literature. This table 
is probably not exhaustive. However, the most important 
solutions are mentioned.

cable stations. 
Hospital 
Inquire the emergency center of local hospitals, or 
provide them photos to identify. 
B. Lost Seeking Devices 
The consequences of getting lost or wandering are very 
diverse. Wandering and disorientation may cause them with 
anxiety, boring, or less exercise [11][16][17]. However, 
outdoor activity is important to the dementia-patients. Since 
the patients are level and situation-dependent, the demand 
from caregivers and individual care-giving environment are 
different from one by one. Some lost seeking devices with e-
Health system are developed and marketed. Most of them are 
small, easy to wear and carry around, not easily loose, and 
water-proofing, strong features, but the sizes and usage are 
different. There are roughly three kind of lost seeking 
devices: non-electronic, electronic, and biometric (Table II). 
Each product has its own pros and cons, and can be featured: 
1) By the usage: portable, wearable, and biometric; 2) By the 
materials: paper, plastics, and stainless steel, et al; 3) By the 
labeled information: photo, name, emergency contact 
number, address, sufferer’s history of chronic cases, battery 
and system operating signals, and function bottoms.

RESEARCH METHODS 
A. Interview with Questionnaire 
A status-quo analysis and an interview with questionnaire 
were conducted. The contents of the questionnaire include 
subject’s personal information, disorientation experience, 
and their experiences and advices of using the lost seeking- 
devices. The collected data are analyzed by descriptive 
statistics. The purpose of the questionnaires is to understand 
the experience and requirements towards currently available 
products for dementia-patients. Researchers visited the 
subjects with the company of social workers. Each interview 
spent about 40 minutes.  
B. Subjects 
This study cooperated with the Seeking Center of 
Missing Elders. Social workers were asked to evaluate the 37 
voluntary subjects, who are caregivers and family members 
of dementia-patients. The qualified subjects are: 1) taking 
care of adult dementia-patients who are above mild level, 2) 
taking care of patients having Disability Certificates, or 3) 
taking care of patients who have experienced disorientation. 
17 care-givers in this study are male, 20 female, and their 
ages were from 28 to 86 years old (M = 50.08, SD = 15.47). 
The dementia-patients: 16 are male, 21 female, and their 
ages were from 40 to 93 years old (M = 72.75, SD = 10.23). 
The education levels of the caregivers are: below junior high 
school (24.3%), high school (40.5%), college (27%), above 
graduate school (8.1%); the profession of the caregivers: 
homemaker (32.4%), business (32.4%), industry (16.2%), 
free-lance (13.5%), and government employees (5.4%). The 
relationship between care-givers and patients, the most is the 
older generation (70.2%), and then spouse (18.9%). The lost 
seeking devices used by the dementia-patients: the most is 
self-made ID card (62.1%); the least is case history wrist, 
GPS and electronic care system. The lost seeking devices 
which dementia-patients have used: the most is self-made ID 
card (72.9%); the least is case history wrist, and electronic 
care system. 16.2% of patients have no experience. The 
duration of using the lost seeking devices: the longest is 84 
months, the shortest is 3 months (M = 28.56, SD = 25.44). 
IV. 
RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
The data is listed in Table III. In order to eliminate the 
concern of deviation, the responses of this questionnaires are 
based on care-givers’ first-time experience; question 1, 12, 
13, 22 are multiple-choice questions; the percentage is 
calculated on the basis of the number of responses.

V. 
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS 
Care-givers’ opinions towards lost-seeking report and 
seeking-assist products were discussed as follows: 1) 
Reporting to police would be the best choice: when the 
dementia-patients are missing, care-givers tend to seek on 
their own, and most of them ask for police’s help. With the 
time passing, police office will announce seeking notice to 
the seeking center. Thus seeking center is not in the front line 
of lost-seeking, but working as an information manager. 2) 
Care-givers’ computer skill should be concerned: if the care-
givers are elders, or in a lower education level, their 
computer skills are limited. They showed higher resistance 
towards electronic and GPS monitoring systems. 3) The 
seeking-assist product is not colorful enough: probably 
because too less propaganda or the color of the products is 
not obvious enough, or they wear the products in a wrong 
way, when the patients are found on the road, the passengers 
may be not aware of the patients were wearing seeking-assist 
products. 4) The patients show resistance to the products: 
care-givers indicate that the patients showed resistance 
towards the seeking-assist products, especially male patients. 
Female patients tend to consider the products as accessories, 
showing higher acceptance towards bracelets product. Care-
givers usually persuade the patients in a way of religion or 
family love, warning them not to take off the products. 5) 
The materials of the products are not strong enough: some 
patients tend to play, fiddle with, or dismantle the products, 
which cause the products loose or miss. Also, when the 
products are worn-down or eroded by water, care-givers tend 
to replace or repair the product by themselves, which causes 
the specification more messy. 6) Concern of labels and data 
leakage: most care-givers think the data leakage is not a big 
deal if the patients can be rapidly found. They indicate that 
the identification of labeling should be enhanced. 
Table III shows there are 46.42% of dementia-patients 
missing 
because 
they 
walk 
outside 
themselves, 
accompanying with wandering (16.07%), auditory and visual 
hallucinations (14.28%). Duration of disorientation is mostly 
less than one day (40.5%), and the care-givers would ask for 
seeking assistance when the patients are missing within one 
hour (35.1%). 48.6% of patients were silent when they were 
found; 45.9% are dull; some old patients were with abrasion 
due to falling down; incontinence may be caused by 
tiredness. Therefore, they should be psychologically 
comfortable treated to relieve their pressure. Regarding the 
person care-givers ask for help, police is credited with 32.4%, 
and passengers are 24.3%. Also, the care-givers tend to seek 
by themselves or by their family, if they are not able to find 
the patients, they will report to police office and ask for their 
help, which is in accordance with the response in question 12 
and 13. Comparing the disoriented distance, mostly are in the 
neighborhood and less than 2 kilometers (37.8%). 24.3% 
patients were found in the neighboring city. However, in the 
responses of the choice of lost-seeking (question 12 and 13), 
chief of the village and instant broadcasting are not their first 
choice. We presume that they might not know these methods, 
or they take it as privacy, and dislike to be known by others 
know. In the question of 14 and 15, when the patients get lost 
again, 91.8% are found in a different location, 91.8% of care-
givers seek the patients in the same way as the first time, 
which shows the route and situation are uncertain, seeking in 
the same way would reduce the efficiency. Perhaps the

situation of the patients is uncertain, and the care-givers have 
only limited way of seeking. This is a must-solve problem, 
and it is also the main issue of this study. 
In the question of what products care-givers have used 
and what they are using, 16.2% are first-using. Most people 
use non-electronic products, self-made card (61.1%) and 
bracelets (37.8%) are the top 2 choices, and some care-givers 
say they would use both at the same time. For open question, 
they show that there is telephone number of the seeking 
center in the bracelets; if they cannot find the card on the 
patients, bracelets would be the last defensive line. 
Electronic products are with higher price, and computer 
skills are required. Considering that 24.3% of care-givers are 
with the education level of below junior high school, 40.5% 
are high school, 18.9% are spouses, and most of them are 
elders, it may be the reason that they tend not to use the 
electronic products. Additionally, Case history wrist is the 
least used; it may be because the materials have less 
durability, even though there is contact information on it. In 
the question 19 and 20, the reason of using the product is 
wandering behavior (21.6%), which is in accordance with 
question 1. Furthermore, most care-givers bought the 
products after the 3.5 times of missing experience, but only 
20% family members would buy the products spontaneously. 
In addition, the suggestion from doctors (10%) and police 
(10%) would also be the main reason, which may because of 
their professional image. 
As for the acceptance toward the products, 37.8% of 
patients show high acceptance, but there are also 21.6% 
showing totally rejection, often taking the products off or 
rejecting to wear. Since most patients are the older 
generation, care-givers persuade them by religion and family 
love, which may be the reason. Comparing question 22 and 
23: care-givers’ choices of seeking-assistant and seeking 
method before and after using the products: 25.3% would 
choose seeking center, 56.7% choose police office, but the 
number of seeking themselves decreasing (referring to 
question 12 and 13), which may because the care-givers 
mainly use bracelets as the seeking product, and police office 
is the first choice for reporting. We hope the seeking center 
can become a center for consultation, the products did 
relieving care-givers’ burdens. Referring to question 24, 25, 
26, and 27, technology-assist (35.1%) would quickly find out 
the missing patients. However, bracelet (67.5%) is the first 
choice of the future product; 89.1% agree with the 
application of technology-assist product on aged patients, but 
there are also 59.4% consider that it may cause data leakage 
of personal information. We infer that most care-givers hope 
technological products would increase the efficiency and 
safety, but they also think it’s too expensive and lack of 
computer skills. This result demonstrates the choice of 
seeking methods depends on the education level of the care-
givers and most of them are elders. The concern of data 
leakage is also related to today’s fraud issue, which may be 
the reason limiting the promotion of electronic products and 
biometrics. 
Based on the interview and analysis mentioned above, 
some problems are concluded in Table IV: 1) Dementia-
patients move slowing, but disappear when the care-givers 
and family members didn’t keep their eyes on the sufferers. 2) 
Most care-givers and family members prepare cards for the 
dementia-patients; some of them are using more than two 
kinds of seeking-assist products. 3) People are not familiar 
with the seeking-assist products: they don’t know the phone 
number of the seeking center is on the product. 4) Computer 
skills are needed for some electronic products. It is difficult 
to those care-givers or family members who are not well-
educated or are in a ripe old age. 5) Some dementia-patients 
tend to play, fiddle with, or dismantle the products, which 
cause the products loose or miss. 6) Dementia-patients may 
have the negative feelings of being labeled and marked, so 
they tend to resist or forget to wear the products and then 
lose them. Some care-givers and family members entice the 
patients to wear the products by their regions, warning them 
not to take down or miss the products. 7) Some dementia-
patients, when they are lost, tend to lose their things, 
including the seeking-assist products. 8) Most of the seeking-
assist products are small, and easily loose, but the sizes and 
usage are different, and there are also 21.6% Dementia-
patients showing totally rejection, often taking the products 
off or rejecting to wear. Some care-givers and family 
members expect subcutaneous implantation of microchips 
and biometric would become a way for seeking. Comparing 
question 26 and 27: 89.1% care-givers and family members 
agree with applying high-tech to seeking-assist facility for 
demented elders. But 59.4% care-givers and family members 
disagree any concern of leakage of personal information on 
the application of high-tech to seeking-assist facility for 
demented elders. 9) Since electronic products are relative 
expensive and limited by its signal reception, the users are 
very few; those care-givers and family members with higher 
education level say they hope the ability of GPS would 
improve, and its price would decrease. 10) Most care-givers 
and family members say that for moderate and severe 
dementia-sufferers, and those who can walk around 
themselves, the products can only provide limited help. They 
will finally take the patients to a sanatorium, or hire a care-
giver to take care of the patients. 
The problems concluded above can be categorized into 
two directions: disorientation experience and lost seeking. 
The first one is about Problem (1), (3), and (7), which are 
related to disorientation experience and choosing a way of 
seeking; the second one is about Problem (2), (4), (6), (8), 
(9), and (10), which are the common problems of both ways 
and products for seeking. 
VI. 
SUGGESTION 
From the above discussion, we propose that the seeking 
products and methods should be re-examined and redesigned. 
More researches should be implemented in order to increase 
the sufferers’ preference to use the products, and reduce the 
burden of the care-givers. The general principle of seeking 
method and product design is suggested as follows: 1) 
Identification of the products: the products should be worn at 
a clear position and with vivid color, which would help 
people quickly find the contact information and increase the 
efficiency. 2) Since the youngest care-giver was 40 years old, 
and the average age of subjects was 72 years old, their 
20

computer skills should be put in concern, if telemedicine 
service is implemented. 3) The acceptance of the product: 
reducing the resistance of dementia-patients, and designing 
the products not easily to dismantle. We should also consider 
the habits and types of male, female, and patients in different 
levels. 4) Development of the local reporting system in the 
community: Since dementia-patients usually get lost in their 
neighborhood, and there are also 25.3% care-givers and 
family members would choose seeking center, 56.7% choose 
police office, a network connecting the office of village chief, 
recreation center, police office, the seeking center, and an 
online toll free assistance centre should be set up for 
convenience locating the lost. 5) Improving the lost-seeking 
poster design and promotion: according to the collected data, 
the sufferers were usually found by passengers, through 
promotion and lost-seeking poster, people will pay more 
attention on the missing patients. 6) After the lost were found, 
some actions and consultants should be adopted in order to 
comfort the patients and reduce their mental pressure in time. 
Not only dementia-patients, this principle can also be 
applied to disabled elderly, mental disorders, and mental 
retardation patients. The seeking-assist product is still not 
common; we should do more promotion and lead more 
people to use the seeking-assist products. Also, the 
development of reporting system can decrease the burdens of 
care-givers and police officers. The seeking center would 
play the role of consultation, report, and promotion. We also 
expect people will pay more attention to the dementia-
patients on the road, guaranteeing their safety. 
VII. 
LIMITATIONS 
This paper discovers the problems of current seeking 
method and facilities, investigating 37 care-givers’ opinions, 
and concluding some suggestions. However, it is very 
difficult to have subjects willing to take the test. The subjects 
are mostly from the Seeking Center of Missing Elders, and 
they mostly live in Taipei City and Taipei Country. It means 
they may not be the representative of the target population. 
Therefore, the conclusion of this study probably can only be 
applied to the Taipei metropolitan. We will consider other 
towns into our research and further discuss the opinions of 
care-givers towards seeking methods and facilities.
