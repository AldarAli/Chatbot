Abstract— Technological trends have given rise to the
development of flipped learning classrooms. An inverted
(or flipped) classroom is a specific type of blended
learning that uses technology to separate lectures from
learning activities. While lectures will take place outside
the classroom, learning activities and concepts practice
will
take
place
inside
the
classroom.
This
paper
compares the learning achievement of two flipped
English (ENGL 201) classes with traditionally taught
classes at the same university. A longitudinal panel
research study is used to investigate the learning
environment of these two classrooms. At the onset of the
pilot,
students
were
less
satisfied
with
the
new
orientation, but, they – later - became more open to the
new learning method. These findings are discussed in
terms of how they contribute to the stability and
connectedness of classroom learning communities.

INTRODUCTION
The Ministry of Education and Higher Education in
Lebanon
(MOEHE)
regulates
the
education
institutes
through a regional education system. The education system
in Lebanon is centralized, and this regulation is not direct.
The
education
system
is
managed
through
regional
education bureaus leaving the integration of technology into
the education system up to the public or private institution.
Given that the incorporation of technology is an integral part
of the curriculum, instruction, and assessment, technology
addition is inevitable.
Furthermore, the idea of integrating diverse approaches
to teaching and learning has been one of the major goals of
education. With the advancement of technological means
come new trends to advance the goal of education, the goal
of
personalizing
instructions,
and
leading
up
to
the
introduction of flipped classrooms. The university system at
the
chosen
educational
institution
(LIU,
Lebanese
International University) piloted the flipped learning – a part
of blended learning - for the first time in fall of 2014/2015.
In subsequent sections, we will address areas of research
related to student reaction of integrating flipped classroom
techniques with English 201 students at LIU (Lebanese
International University).
In the first section, research
related to the impact of general goals of education will be
addressed. In the second section, the goal of personalizing
instruction with students will be discussed. Finally, the last
section focuses on research-based strategies that have been
implemented in flipped classrooms.
A.
The Goal of Education
According to Paul O’Keefe [6], individuals have certain
approaches to goal pursuit. Two factors - cognitive and
affective – influence how people pursue goals. Individuals
need to be interested to maximize motivation and self-
regulation,
and
the
structure
of
achievement
context
influences motivation for attainment of goals as per O’
Keefe and Garcia [7]. In short O’keefe’s research examines
motivational processes involved in the pursuit of goals.
B.
The Goal of Personalizing Instruction
According to Keefe and Jenkins [4], personalization of
instruction and learning is the effort on the part of an
educational institution to take into account individual
student characteristics and needs and flexible instructional
practices in organizing the learning environment. Teachers
committed to personalizing instruction help their students
develop personal learning plans, assist in diagnosing their
cognitive
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
other
style
characteristics, help adapt the learning environment and
instruction to learner needs and interests, and mentor
authentic and reflective learning experiences for their
students.
Personalization
is

systematic in organization, and more authentic in its goals
and strategies.
C.
Asynchronous Learning
In an asynchronous learning environment, students are
able to actively participate in their own learning, giving
them the opportunity to interact with their peers, provide
peer feedback, and reflect on the status of their personal
learning
goals
and
outcomes
[2].
In
many
learning
environments, there are learning activities and expectations
that require students to create, synthesize, explain, and apply
the content or skills being taught [3]. Asynchronous
technologies support learning and allow more time for
student reflection, collaboration, and
student-to-student
interactions [1].
D.
Educational Technology
Technology has the potential to not only offer access to
resources for learning in a superficial sense, but also to
provide increased affordances for autonomous learning.
Opportunities for interaction, situated learning, and support
for learning outside formal contexts, have greatly improved
because of technology. These affordances are not yet always
capitalized on. However, they offer the opportunity to
support the learning process [8].
E.
Flipped Classroom Approach
The flipped classroom approach has been used for years
in some disciplines, particularly within the humanities.
Barbara
Walvoord
and
Virginia
Johnson
Anderson
encouraged the implementation of this method in their book
Effective Grading [9]. They suggest a model in which
students gain first-exposure learning prior to class and focus
on the processing part of learning (synthesizing, analyzing,
problem-solving, etc.) in class. To ensure that students do
the
preparation
necessary
for
productive
class
time,
Walvoord and Anderson propose an assignment-based
model in which students produce work (writing, problems,
etc.) prior to class. The students receive productive feedback
through the processing activities that occur during class,
reducing the need for the instructor to provide extensive
written feedback on the students’ work.
According to Aronson and Intern [5], the Flipped
Learning model of instruction is gaining consideration
among instructors and
professors at the college and
university levels. In this model, some or most of the direct
instruction is conveyed outside the group learning space
using multiple modes of delivery. Class time is optimized
for students to engage in hands-on learning, collaborate with
their peers and evaluate their progress rather than traditional
direct instruction delivery. Instructors can offer one-on-one
support, guidance and motivation. This enables a shift from
an instructor-centered classroom to a student centered
learning environment. Flipped Learning is principally well-
suited to higher education settings for a variety of reasons.
The in-class discussion and enrichment activities allowed by
moving content delivery outside of class time provide
opportunities for students to develop vital skills needed in
the 21st century, including critical thinking, creativity,
communications, and collaboration. The model can also be
especially useful in large lecture courses where student
engagement and interaction is usually minimal. When
students receive the lecture outside of class, they can use
time in class with their peers more effectively by breaking
up into smaller discussion groups or engage in other in-class
activities. Instructors also make more effective use of their
time by reviewing content that students actually need help
with and guiding student discussions. The Flipped Learning
model also permits for differentiated learning in classes of
all sizes, since students can preview the lecture content at
their own pace and ask questions on their own time [2].
II.
METHODOLOGY
A.
Research Purpose and Questions
The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness
of flipping a college course designed to teach composition
and research skills when compared to the traditional
classroom orientation. The research question was: Does
flipping the classroom impact learning effectiveness? The
following point was considered: how much did students
perceive what they learnt? The motivation was based on the
expectation that flipping the classroom will have a positive
impact on the students’ achievements, quantitatively and
qualitatively.
B.
Design of the Study
This research used a short - term longitudinal panel
study in which students of two flipped classrooms at
Nabatieh and Beirut campuses were tracked over a period of
four months and, eventually, compared to their traditional
counterparts. Inferential statistics were used to determine
the significance of any differences found between and
among groups. Observational data supplemented assessment
data to help better interpret and understand the results. The
setting for the study was an English (ENGL 201) course, a
general University requirement that teaches the principles of
“Composition
and
Research
Skills”,
taught
by
two
instructors
at
the
Lebanese
International
University
Nabatieh and Beirut Campuses.
English 201 is a course
where students study different types of discourse: narrative,
description, argumentative, cause – effect, process, etc…
and evaluate them based on the four bases of good writing:
unity, coherence, sentence skills, and support. Students also
learn how to conduct research and write essays.
C.
Description of the Instructional Approaches
This section describes the approaches tested in this
study: 1) traditional instruction in the form of classroom
lectures and large group based instruction. 2) a flipped
classroom enabling technology using videos, pdfs, web
links, narrated power points, word docs with classroom
34

support. Students of both sections used the same material:
all used a textbook, syllabus, assignments and exams.
D.
Form of Instruction
In the two chosen sections, instruction following the
traditional approach took place inside the classroom. On the
other hand, in the flipped approach, the instruction was
provided using a specialized platform called “Coursesites”
[10]
where
assorted
materials
were
uploaded
and
announcements to students were made regularly keeping
them updated of upcoming online sessions. Instructors had
to send invitations to their students so that they can log onto
the platform.
E.
Assessment
The primary reasons for evaluating students are those
reasons which are an essential part of a teacher’s main
responsibility, helping students improve in knowledge and
skills, feelings and attitudes, and hence, helping students
learn. In both treatments, students were assessed formatively
based on a criterion - referenced benchmark. Students sat
for two types of exams: a midterm and a final one. The
validity of the exams was taken into consideration.
F.
Class Process
In both orientations, students were asked to read the
textbook materials before attempting to complete the
homework. In the traditional classroom orientation, the
teacher provided instruction in the classroom. Students were
expected to be active learners: that is - come to class
prepared, participate in class discussion, and ask questions.
In the flipped orientation, students did not attend class, but
tackled
the
starting
material
and
completed
some
assessments online. In the flipped classroom orientation, in
addition to reading the textbook material, students were able
to watch narrated power points, videos, demonstrating how
to
accomplish
the
task.
Pdf’s,
weblinks,
and
other
attachements
were
also
provided
to
aid
the
stds
in
understating
the
starting
material.
There
was
also
a
discussion forum that they can use in order to raise any
question on mind. Answers to the forum can either be from
fellow students or from the teacher her/himself. In addition,
students were – through the forum able to read other
perspectives and carefully consider a final response.
G.
Participants
Subjects in this research were undergraduate students
taking the composition and research skills English course
(ENGL 201) during the Fall semester of 2015 at the
Lebanese International University (LIU), Nabatieh and
Beirut campuses. This course was divided into a fourteen
weeks term. Participants of both orientations were taught
simultaneously. The participants took the course as a
required part of their program. 36 participants were involved
per each traditional and flipped class in Nabatieh and 35
participants per each section in Beirut.
H.
Data Collection and Analysis
To answer the primary question regarding the students’
achievement, Pearson correlation was measured to identify
any statistically significant correlation specially that the
class sample was parametric. Final average grades were
calculated based on the unified grading system of the four
sections: Participation %10, Research Presentation %20,
Essay Quizzes %20, Midterm Exam %25, and Final Exam
%25. The tests were identical and designed to assess
students’ achievement of the learning outcomes of the
course. The tests were formative and summative, online and
in-class,
assessments
the
instructors
gave
students
throughout the learning process.
I.
Limitations
Course redesign took large time investment and effort
since extra resources and material other than the traditional
ones had to be found and used on part of the instructors.
Student Commitment – to a certain extent - rendered the
reliability of the instructions for students with high absence
rate. Email was the main form to send announcements,
where % 5 of the students still faced difficulty in checking
their emails regularly, but, eventually, doing so before
attending the sessions in question. There was difficulty in
reserving the computer lab – in one of the campuses - to
accommodate students in varied and convenient timings.
Students felt threatened – at the beginning - by the use of
technology, but – later - got accommodated with it. Some
students had difficulty accessing internet in and outside the
university, but had access to IT support though phone or
mail.
III.
RESULTS
Quantitative results were used to identify patterns and
explore the research findings.
A.
Students’ Achievements
Given
the
fact
that
all
students
submitted
their
assignments, Pearson correlation was used to examine the
effect of the instruction time (i.e., the regular classroom; the
flipped classroom) on test scores. The main effects of
instruction type in both Campuses: Nabatieh & Beirut were
significant as shown in the tables below:

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
This paper explored how technology can be used to teach
composition and research skills and what impact flipped
leaning might have for students taking a college course in
comparison to the traditional instruction. As shown in the
tables above, both traditional sections in Nabatieh and
Beirut showed positive correlations with their flipped
counterparts.
Hence,
it
demonstrated
how
technology
integrated into class instruction has a similar impact as the
traditional method, which was manifested by Pearson
Correlation - .5 at Nabatieh section and .07 at Beirut’s.
Compared to the traditional treatment, the flipped classroom
approach provided an effective method for delivering the
class; it allowed students to learn course content at their
own pace in which they had access to the online session
either on campus computer labs (in which the broadband
was made sure to be feasible to upload or download
material) or at the convenience of their own home, allowing
them to make a better use of their time and become more
teacher independent. At first, students used to rely on the
teacher to deliver the required material in class in which
they were quasi passive recipients, whereas and after the
very
first
two
sessions,
students
were
participating,
commenting, giving their opinion on the class material used
on Coursesites. It is of utmost importance to mention that to
meet the students’ needs, they were oriented on creating
student
accounts,
surfing
the
site,
downloading
and
uploading material, using discussion forums, & receiving
online announcements, in the university lab before the
official onset of the online sessions.
We expected the flipped approach to be better than the
traditional one, but, this result was surprising. We found no
statistical difference between the novice and the traditional
ones when it comes to the students’ final averages
achievements, and that is – of course – quantitatively.
Qualitatively, we are in the process of collecting students’
feedback
using
a
questionnaire
“Students
Satisfaction
Survey Form – SSSF) which will allow us to have a more
thorough view of the qualitative difference between the
flipped and the traditional approaches from the students’
perspective.
The evidence suggests that the flipped approach is at
least as effective as the traditional one for delivering this
class and somewhat more scalable which is impressive
given the limitations stated above. Despite the fact that few
students faced difficulty in logging onto their emails, most
of them were able to accomplish the intended tasks in the
modules. Moreover, students received vis-a-vis support and
had access to their instructors during their office hours to fill
in any gaps. It is a newly founded approach for students and
they still managed to fair out the same as a regularly
delivered class. Students had ownership of their own
learning resulting in experiencing independent educational
experiences. As the semester progressed, it was evident via
the teachers’ observation in class that students were able to
tackle various directions and topics independently. Another
point to elucidate, that prior to administering the final exam,
a mock-final exam was uploaded in one of the modules
which required higher order thinking skills, and the student
fared very well.
We also expected that the blended approach might be
inferior to the regular one in achieving the required
outcomes and objectives especially with the limitations we
had. But, the results of this study seem to suggest that this
is not the case and students became well acquainted with
technology and common educational means used globally.
In summary, our findings suggest that the flipped
approach was as instructional as the traditional method
given all the stated limitations.
V.
FUTURE RESEARCH
While our study provides evidence that the flipped
classroom is as efficient as the non - flipped, we should be
cautious in generalizing the findings beyond the scope of the
context. Future studies will show if one method has efficacy
over the other, when it comes to students’ performance and
motivation. Future research in this area is required. Due to
the positive impact of the flipped course in Fall 2014/2015,
the flipped program will continue as of Fall 2015/2016. It is
recommended to proceed with the study tackling both
quantitative and qualitative sides in accordance with LIU
(Lebanese
International
University)
students’
profiles.
Future recommendations include widening the scope of
flipped learning into telecommunication reaching students
in other countries.
