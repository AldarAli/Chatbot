Abstract—In the task of data classification, there exist many 
uses and applications such as Credit assignment, Business, 
games Development, gene Research in public health problems, 
among others. In this research there is a large collection of 
data for treatment and prevention of some diseases, the most 
complex is the study of Cancer. The databases there have 
provided valuable knowledge useful for study of this disease 
that in many cases is unknown. An example of these databases 
is at the Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, with information 
of human laryngeal carcinoma (LaCa). In this paper, we 
propose a Prediction System of Larynx Cancer (PSLC) to 
apply the task of classification of this type of databases to 
obtain novel knowledge for LaCa. The prediction system has 
two components, one component is the transformation and 
selection of data, the second component is a set of classifiers to 
obtain the prediction of life of sample patients with this type of 
cancer. With this prediction system, we found that, when there 
is an increase in CRBP-1 gene, it was correlated with patient 
survival; this allowed us to implement a Hybrid Classifier of 
Decision Rules (HCDR). The HCDR obtained the highest 
predictive value using genes CRBP-1 and provided a better 
degree of accuracy, with more than 90%, in comparison with 
different classifiers, indicating that the PSLC has a high degree 
of reliability.

 INTRODUCTION  
 
One of the most recent advances in genomic science is 
the search of genes responsible for alterations in different 
organisms, generating new research, in areas such as 
Agriculture, Medicine, Biomedical Sciences, among others. 
Some 
techniques, 
such 
as 
comparative 
genomic 
hybridization [6] and immunohistochemical assays on tissues 
[14] can determine the possible origin of different diseases 
such as cancer. By exhaustive search techniques and use of 
decision trees [2], there have been developed systems that 
make use of these techniques, finding relationship between 
genetic patterns of patients with some types of cancer, to 
provide prevention and early treatment. 
An example of these systems is OncoTree [11] (for renal 
carcinoma progression), which finds relationship between 
genetic patterns of Renal Cancer using decision trees. 
Although having good results on this type of cancer, this 
system has two limitations: on the one hand, it can only do 
an analysis of renal cancer, and, on the other hand, limiting 
the use of this system is reserved only for some businesses 
due to their high prices. 
There exist a small number of these and other predictive 
systems in only some countries; with high prices for use and 
analysis of results, limiting research in this area worldwide, 
this is a main problem with cancer prediction systems. 
Because of this problem in some institutions [4], studies 
have been generated on different types of cancer, seeking to 
develop prediction systems like Onco Tree. An example of 
these studies was conducted in the Centro Medico Nacional 
Siglo XXI in Mexico City, which obtained a database (DB) 
with information about Larynx Cancer. This DB has the 
study of 21 patients with this type of cancer for over five 
years, which represents one of the largest repositories in 
Mexico. 
The problem with this DB is that only specialists in the 
area of genetics have studies of how this may originate this 
type of cancer at the chromosomal level. In a study 
conducted with the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana 
(UAM) and Instituto de Ciencias y Tecnologías de la 
Información (ICyTDF), we had access to this DB, for which 
we proposed as a way to find these patterns using Data 
Mining, such as those used in Onco Tree. 
Data Mining [10] is the exploration and analysis to 
identify patterns non trivial (knowledge) within large 
amounts of data, which may be valid, novel, potentially, 
useful and understandable. With Data Mining we solve many 
tasks [13] as Prediction, Classification, Identification, 
Grouping and Association. 
In this paper, we propose a Prediction System of Larynx 
Cancer (PSLC), with which we use the first and second Data 
Mining tasks. The prediction we use to find the correlations 
of the attributes within the DB’s of Genetic Markers 
(dbGM). The task of classification is used to make the 
analysis and diagnosis of potential patients using the 
correlations found in the prediction task. 
The PSCL is composed of two components; the first 
component is the transformation and selection of data, 
because dbGM has a special format called ISCN (An 
International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature), 
which corresponds to all nomenclature that is handled in the 
research area of Human Genetics.  
For the second component, we mix the prediction and 
classification tasks to get a prediction of laryngeal cancer in 
patients who are predisposed to have this type of cancer. At 
this stage we call the Engine of Operation (EM) of PSCL, 
which we use to obtain the experimental results of the 
classification of dbGM.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will 
discuss previous work on prediction systems and the main 
algorithms used for constructing such systems. In Section 3, 
we describe how we build the PSLC. In Section 4, the tests 
that were performed to a DB of genetic biochips, will be 
discussed along with the results obtained using several Data 
Mining classifiers. Finally, we will present a conclusion and 
future work steps. 
 
II. 
PREVIOUS WORK 
A. Background  of LaCa 
 
Laryngeal cancer (LaCa) represents an important public 
health problem mainly affecting people over fifty years 
worldwide. Several methods are used for treatment and 
prevention. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has 
been widely used in cancer research [8], [10], [14] the 
detection of specific patterns of chromosomal imbalances, 
for example, loss of chromosome 13 in all carcinomas cell 
carcinomas of the larynx [9], [10]. 
However, in the spatial resolution of CGH not much is 
known about the identity of specific genes that could be 
targeted chromosomal regional imbalances. The CGH array 
solves this problem by increasing the sensitivity for detection 
of changes in DNA copy number in specific loci (which are 
the specific location of a gene or DNA sequence on a 
chromosome) through the use of genomic DNA fragments is 
defined by a mapping location. 
It is known that these arrays extend over a solid surface, 
resulting in a resolution of the imbalances in a number of 
copies of a single gene level [12]. To refine patterns of 
chromosomal 
imbalances 
present 
in 
squamous 
cell 
carcinoma of the larynx, and especially to identify the 
specific genes that could target the of copy number changes 
in this tumor type, array CGH is applied with oncogenes, 
tumor suppressor genes or some other genes associated with 
cancer. 
This is achieved by determining the relation of level 
chromosomal patterns of samples obtained using different 
classification models in data mining, to determine which 
genes are involved, below some methods are described for 
classifying data. In the next section we review some data 
mining classifiers. 
B. Several Methods for classification 
 
In the literature, there have been a large number of 
classifiers that allow us to differentiate a set of samples 
according to the category or as usually called the class to 
which they belong. 
There is a large number of classifiers [5] for instance the 
classifiers based on decision trees as adultery, C4.5 and ID3, 
classifiers based on decision rules as Decision Tables and 
Decision List, ensemble-based systems such as Bagging and 
Boosting, classifiers based on separating classes by 
hyperplanes such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
classifier, among others.  
In this paper, we developed a Hybrid Classifier of 
Decision Rules (HCDR) [2], which was incorporated in the 
information on the main genetic markers within the dbGM, 
which allow us to obtain better performance measures. 
Since this classifier has the better results, in this section we 
focus on the previous work of this classifier. 
There are three ways [13] of how to build a classifier 
based on decision rules, which are described below: 
 
 
Decision Trees: With this method we create a set 
of rules, each of them for each leaf of the tree, 
which are easy to interpret. 
 
Specific algorithms for rule induction: The 
language of representation of decision rules is 
essentially propositional. Is this method, each rule 
is learned one by one, so each time it selects a 
rule, the examples that are covered by the selected 
rule are removed from the training set. 
The process is repeated iteratively until a stop 
condition is fulfilled. To learn a rule begins with 
rules as general as possible, then these records are 
being added to maximize classification accuracy 
of this rule. 
 
Models based on association rules: The aim of 
the association rules is to find associations or 
correlations between items or objects in the 
database. Wanted the best association rules, in 
order to overcome some limitations of the models 
based on decision trees, which consider only the 
attributes one by one partially. 
Once we review the main strategies on how to build 
classifiers based on decision rules, in the next section we 
describe how we build the PSLC we propose. 
III. 
PREDICTION SYSTEM OF LARYNX CANCER (PSLC) 
A. PSLC components 
The PSLC has two components [7], the component of 
Transformation and Selection of Data (TSD) and the Engine 
of Operation (EO). 
In the TSD component receiving data input, either read 
from a file or entered manually by people who will use the 
PSLC, which have a special format ISCN. The function of 
this component will convert this format to a matrix format 
for easier the processing in EO component. 
In the EO component, once the data are in the matrix 
format we perform the classification of each patient tested. 
This component is implemented in the HCDR, which will 
allow us to make a prediction of what kind of life has one 
patient. The following sections explain in more detail each 
component of PCS_EME.

B. Transformation and Selection of Data  
 
For this component, we implement techniques to apply 
the pre-processing and transformation phases on dbGM. For 
these two phases we implement two algorithms of 
Digitization or Labeling and Discretization, which perform 
the pre-processing and transformation phases. First, we 
show the ISCN format, taking an example of genetic 
biochip BD; then, later, we describe each algorithm of the 
TSD component. 
 
1) ISCN Format 
 
The DB has some special format called ISCN, which has 
an entire nomenclature that is handled in the area of Human 
Genetics, for the specific case of the dbGM. 
These nomenclatures are reduced to a subset, which 
contains the information about possible genetic alterations 
associated with certain cancers. In one study of Centro 
Médico Nacional Siglo XXI of Instituto Mexicano Del 
Seguro Social, they obtained a dbGM with 19 records of 
patients with laryngeal cancer and two patients with cervical 
cancer [4], over five years. 
They obtained this dbGM from progenetix (this database 
containing an overview of the anomalies in the number of 
copies of Human Cancer of Comparative Genomic 
Hybridization (CGH)), to generate a karyotype and a 
grouping of data; one record of this base is as follows: 
 
L1    rev ish enh(1p36.22, 1p13.1, 1qtel, 2q14, 3p14.2, 
3q26.3, 5q21q22, 5q33q35, 7q32q34,  8p22, 8p22q21.3, 
8q24qter, 9q22.3, 14qtel, 15qtel, 16qtel, 17ptel, 17q23, 
20q13.2, 20qtel, Xq12) dim enh(19ptel) amp enh(1q21, 
Xp22.3)    
 
As we can see, this information is totally unknown 
because it is in a specialized format, such as the ISCN, but 
each acronym has a special meaning, which we are going to 
describe for each acronym that appears on this record: 
 
 
L1:Label assigned to the patient. 
 
rev, ish, enh, dim and amp: Techniques used to 
obtain genetic information, rev is the technique 
called Reverse, ish is the technique called In Situ 
Hybridization, 
enh 
is 
the 
technique 
called 
Enhanced, dim is the technique called Diminished 
and finally amp is the technique called Amplified 
Signal. 
 
1p36.22:It is the first record in the parentheses, the 
number at the start leading 1 is the number of 
chromosomes, p is the kind of arm that is in this 
case p is the short arm, if occupied q it would be the 
long arm, and finally 36.22 refers to the area of the 
chromosome where there is a change. 
We can see that each record has a set of implicit 
information, which is difficult to handle for most classifiers, 
which is why we implement a method of transformation for 
these data. To achieve this objective, we implement 
digitization and discretization algorithms to apply on this 
dbGM and we obtain a format more appropriate for the 
incorporation of classifiers, then we show how we apply 
these algorithms on dbGM 
 
2) Implementing 
Labeling 
and 
Discretization 
techniques. 
 
In the example of the previous subsection, there are terms 
that are used exclusively in the ISCN format, which 
represent the acronym of each element that compose a record 
of this type of the dbGM. 
With these acronyms, the labeling and discretization 
techniques were applied for change to integer values, which 
are handled by classifiers more directly, as a first element 
each acronym that are present in the dbGM is listed. 
Techniquesfor each patient 
 
rev ish enh 
 
dim enh 
 
amp  enh 
 
amp 
 
dim 
Chromosomes 
 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, X, Y 
Type of arm on chromosome  
 
p: Short arm. 
 
q: Long arm. 
Region where the genetic alteration is present: 
 
Real 
values 
associated 
with 
each 
of 
the 
chromosomes that can go terminal region (ter) at 
the telomeric (tel). 
So, when we apply the labeling and discretization 
techniques, we have to assign a nomenclature to each of 
these acronyms, the nomenclature used is as follows:  
Techniques:  
 
rev ish enh → 101 
 
amp enh → 102 
 
dim enh → 103 
 
amp → 104 
 
dim → 105 
Chromosomes: 
 
From 1, 2, …, 22 
 
X → 23 
 
Y → 24 
Arm: 
 
P  → 300 
 
Q → 301 
Region: 
 
Real values multiplied by 100 
 
ter → 4000 
 
tel → 4001 
 
The allocation of these values was arbitrary, having this 
way the transformation of all acronyms of ISCN format. In 
Table I, we can see an example of the application of these 
techniques on the record shown in Section 1).

In the record of Table I, there are only integer data so 
makes it easier handling it for the classifiers, however exist a 
problem because the size of registration is large and each 
record has a different length. For this reason we propose a 
way of how to make the registers have the same size, we do 
this by separating techniques which have in a register. 
To show how we apply this change in records to have the 
same size, we use another record of dbGM, which contains 
the following information: 
 
L8T2N0 amp (19ptel, 22q11.21, 22q11.2, 22q13.3, 
22qtel) dim (19ptel)    
 
As we can see in the previous record, there are two 
techniques, which are the amp and dim, this example will 
help to illustrate each phase that must be performed to 
transform the format ISCN to the format that handles PSLC. 
The operation of transformation has four phases, which are 
as follows. 
 
Phase 1: 
 
In the record above, there are two techniques, amp and 
dim, in this phase we identify the techniques, are divided, 
and new records are formed according to the number of 
techniques, the new records are creating as follows: 
 
amp(19ptel, 22q11.21, 22q11.2, 22q13.3, 22qtel)  
 
dim(19ptel)    
 
Phase 2: 
 
For each new record, we must separate it into each 
genetic alteration, retaining the order for each technique, 
after which we apply this phase to the new records and they 
change as follows: 
 
 
amp 
1. 19ptel 
2. 22q11.21 
3. 22q11.2 
4. 22q13.3 
5. 22qtel 
 
dim 
1. 19ptel 
 
Phase 3: 
 
Since they have separate genetic alterations, we will 
proceed to separate in chromosome number, type of arm and 
area of the chromosome where the alteration is present, 
respecting each new nomenclature established, we carry out 
as follows: 


Once we have coded both records, all information

having two records, it will have six records, but all the same 
size; the example obtained from this phase can be seen in 
Table II:

We can see that in this matrix format, there are the 
different techniques (amp and dim), with all information in 
them, but we add new information of each record, for this 
case we add two new attributes, number of changes and 
sequence. 
The number of changes attribute, has the techniques used 
in some patient. In the sequence attribute, since each 
technique was encoded in a range of 101 to 105, for this new 
attribute the last digit is used and depending on whether one 
or more techniques used they are strung together, returning 
to the previous example used the technique amp and dim 
which have associated values 104 and 105 respectively, so 
that the new attribute would be 45. Finally, adding these two 
attributes, the final record we can see in Table III. 
With this example, we explain how we performed the 
transformation the format of dbGM, for having a matrix 
format to carry out the EO component of PSLC. 
 
3) Operation Engine 
 
When performing the task of data classification, there are 
two sets, training and testing. With the training set the 
models of classification algorithms are constructed. Using 
the test sets the classification is performed for each of the 
records in the DB, which are carried out individually, i.e. 
record by record. 
This is the traditional way of how to perform data 
classification, however for the dbGM is not possible to carry 
out the classification in the traditional way, since as we can 
see in Table III; a set of six records in the matrix format is 
equivalent to one record in the ICSN format. 
In this paper, we develop a module called Engine of 
Operation (EO) of PSLC. The EO implements a set of 
classifiers as Naive Bayes, C4.5, k-NN and the HCDR, 
among others to perform the task of classification. The 
classification performed with these classifiers is the tradition; 
therefore we find a way to change it, for this we implement a 
voting criterion as used in classifiers based on ensembles. 
A classifier based on ensembles [1], joins one or more 
types of classifiers to obtain improvements in performance 
measures, which is why we need a criterion to designate the 
classification of each example in the test set, there have been 
two voting criteria the Majority and Weighted voting 
criterion. 
TABLE III.  
MATRIX FORMAT OF A RECORD 
 
In Majority Voting Criterion, each of the classifiers votes 
to decide to which class each example belongs to for the test 
set, eventually counting the votes and assigning the class 
majority. For Weighted Voting Criterion, each classifier has 
a weight, so each vote has a different weight, so that in the 
end has a weighted voting, but the class is assigned given the 
most voting weight. 
With these two criteria, we decided to use the majority-
voting criterion [3] to adapt the classifiers of EO, to 
exemplify this incorporation we can see the diagram in 
Figure 1, which shows the traditional way to carry out the 
classification (Tclass) and the applying of majority voting 
criterion for classification (MVclass).

and the class 2. The class 1 has the most votes, this set of 
examples that represent a single example in the ISCN 
format, they assign the majority class, respecting the original 
meaning that we have for each record, we conclude this 
component; in the next section, we review the experiments 
and results obtained by the PSLC. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
 
In this section, we show the results obtained by 
performing a series of tests with the BD of larynx cancer to 
measure the performance of the PSLC. The tests consisted in 
generating a number of test and training sets with different 
sizes; we can see these sets in Table IV.

With each training set of Table IV, the MVclass were 
performed according to the following steps: 
1. We take two sets of dbGM, a set classless and 
another set with the class of each record; these will 
be the test and training set respectively. 
2. The test sets we use by some classifiers, to perform 
the MVclass of each example. 
3. Once it gets the MVclass of each record of the test 
set, we compared them to their real classes. 
4. At the end of this comparison, we obtained the 
performance measures that will allow us to evaluate 
each classifier. 
At the end of the testing process, we choose the accuracy 
as the performance measure to evaluate each classifier. 
Accuracy provides information on the percentage of 
correctly classified examples, out of the entire test set; this 
performance measure is formally defined as follows: 
 
𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 = 
(𝑎 +  𝑑)
(𝑎 +  𝑏 +   𝑐 +  𝑑 )                                      (1) 
 
In equation 1 has the following:  
 
(a, d)  is the correctly classified examples and 
 
(c, b) is the classified incorrectly examples 
 
It is noteworthy that for each of the tests we used cross-
validation to determine the validity of each classifier we 
implement. Figure 2 and Table V show the final results we 
obtain in each of the tests that were performed.

We can see in Figure 2 and Table IV that the HCDR 
showed better results than traditional classifiers, obtaining an 
average accuracy of 93,619. The HCDR was strengthened 
with genetic markers found in the database of the study after 
five years in patients with larynx cancer. By using new 
technologies such as scanning AXON, the targets are 
searched must be related to cancer of the larynx and cervical 
cancer. 
Table VI shows the class for each patient in the study 
over five years. In these patients, we determined the main 
patterns present at the genetic level, which are present in 
ISCN format.

With Table VI, we locate the presence of CRBP-1 and 
EGFR genes. CRBP-1 is a protein involved in the transport 
of retinol from its storage sites of the liver to peripheral 
tissues. Vitamin A plays an important role in a variety of 
cellular 
processes 
associated 
with 
epithelial 
tissue 
proliferation and differentiation. This protein could improve 
the condition of some form of cancer, when analyzing our 
database we observed that it actually improved the 
conditions of patients with larynx cancer. 
In contrast, EGFR amplification could be associated with 
poor survival of patients with larynx cancer. A gain of 
CRBP-gene may have a protective effect and increased 
survival. These data suggest that alteration CRBP-1 gene and 
its expression in carcinomas of the larynx squamous provide 
prognostic information with greater potential patient 
survival. 
Previously, Peralta et al.  [4] reported the behavior of 
these two genes but with techniques in microarray data 
analysis. For this work became the chromosomal level 
analysis of each of the patients involved, and seek the 
relationship patterns of each sample to determine the genes 
present. In the same way, it was determined that the gene 
CRBP-1 was present in patients who survived the EGFR 
gene was present in poor survival. In this way it was shown 
at the chromosome level and table’s decision techniques and 
data mining obtained the correct result.  
By identifying these genetic patterns, we could 
implement the HCDR, which is able to incorporate decision 
rules that endorse the existence of these patterns in any of the 
branches of the decision tree constructed, which resulted an 
average accuracy of over 15% compared to traditional 
classifiers. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
In this paper, we propose a Prediction System of Larynx 
Cancer (PSLC), for exploration and analysis of the databases 
of genetic markers (dbGM). The PSLC has two components, 
the Transformation and Selection of Data (TSD) component 
and the Operation Engine (EO). 
With 
the 
TSD 
component, 
we 
perform 
data 
transformation that was in ISCN format to a matrix format 
for better data handling. This component was necessary since 
most of the classifiers are better suited to this type of data 
format. Otherwise if we had taken the raw ISCN format, 
many changes should have been made in the operation of 
each classifier. That is why we decided to not make these 
changes and implement the TSD module. 
With the EO component implemented as an alternative 
way to perform the classification by incorporating a majority 
voting criterion (MVclass). With this alternative form of 
classification, we performed a series of tests with a set of 
classifiers. In Table V and Figure 2, the accuracy grew 15% 
with respect to the other classifiers considered for the tests; 
this gives us the result that the HCDR performs better than 
traditional classifiers. 
This classifier considers the incorporation of decision 
rules with tree structures, together with the genetic markers, 
the CRBP-1 to survival of patients and EGFR to poor 
survival of patients, located in a series of preliminary tests. 
With PSLC we proved that by incorporating two areas of 
knowledge (Artificial Intelligence and Genetics), different 
from one another, there may be generated more complex 
algorithms; such is the case of HCDR. With this model of 
classification we obtained a better accuracy for each one of 
the tests we made to the dbGM, comparing it with different 
traditional classifiers. The PCSL is an example of the new 
interdisciplinary projects of Science and Technology that 
combine more than one area of current research. 
For the PSLC we consider its seminal work on the issue, 
since if we want to develop new versions incorporating other 
types of cancer, it will be directly because in tests we found 
that the genetic information of two different types of cancer, 
in this case larynx and cervical, show many similarities, so 
we left the base ready to scale this project.
