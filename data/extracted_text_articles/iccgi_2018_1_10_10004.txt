Abstract— 
This 
paper 
discusses 
a 
pilot 
study 
on 
conceptualization and validation of Information Security 
Culture (ISC) as a multidimensional second-order formative 
construct. The concept was developed in our previous works, 
and is based on widely accepted concepts of Organizational 
Culture and ISC. The model is validated using samples from 
employees of one Malaysia Public University. The Partial Least 
Squares Approach to Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-
SEM) using Smart-PLS software was used to model and 
analyse the data. The ISC construct was treated as reflective-
formative second-order construct and analysed using the latest 
approach in PLS-SEM. The findings empirically support the 
conceptualization and validation of ISC as a reflective-
formative second-order construct with all seven dimensions 
being significant in contributing to the underlying concept of 
ISC. The study contributes to the ISC literature by providing 
new insights on the conceptualization, operationalization and 
validation of ISC the concept based on widely accepted 
concepts and approaches. 
 
Keywords- ISC concept; reflective-formative second-order;

 INTRODUCTION  
Due to increasing number of security breaches and 
attacks caused by employee’s behavior, scholars and experts 
recommended practitioners to cultivate Information Security 
Culture (ISC) in guiding the security behavior in an 
organization. A number of studies related to ISC have been 
conducted to utilize this culture ranging from understanding 
of ISC to the development and validation of ISC 
frameworks and assessments [1]. However, there is still 
unclear what are the comprehensive guidelines to cultivate 
the ISC that effectively will influence employee’s security 
behavior. Moreover, there is no common understanding of 
what ISC is and what factors or dimensions should be used 
to conceptualize ISC [2]. 
In terms of concept, generally, there are two ways of 
conceptualization found in the literature. The first approach 
is by using a general construct with particular number of 
reflective items. Although this approach is mostly used in 
the literature, there are some limitations pertaining to the 
applicability of the items to represent the elements or 
aspects of ISC cultivation. Since it is a reflective construct, 
the items or indicators used to measure the ISC construct are 
representing similar aspect of ISC only. This is because the 
items for a reflective construct are interchangeable [3]. As a 
result, these items could not be used to represent the 
particular distinctive aspects of ISC and the findings from 
this type of ISC conceptualization could not be utilized as 
aspects to be used in ISC cultivation. Furthermore, this 
approach is not comprehensively representing the actual 
meaning of the ISC itself because ISC is a culture that 
should be cultivated by multiple aspects. The second 
approach is by conceptualizing ISC as a multidimensional 
formative second-order construct with a particular number 
of first-order dimensions. In this way, the ISC construct is 
measured by several different aspects of ISC that form the 
concept [4]. This second approach of conceptualization 
provides more clear indications on the aspects that could be 
used as guidelines and strategies in ISC cultivation 
compared to the first approach.  
This paper discusses ISC as a multidimensional second-
order formative construct by proposing and validating the 
ISC concept that was developed in our previous works 
[5][6]. Section II discusses literature review and the 
conceptualization of ISC concept followed by the 
methodology used to validate it in Section III. Section IV 
presents results and analysis of data followed by the 
discussion of findings in Section V. Section VI justifies 
limitations of the study and finally the conclusion is 
presented in Section VII.

II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW AND MODEL DEVELOPMENT 
There are many definitions of ISC in the literature. [7] in 
his systematic literature review on ISC studies has found 
that most of the ISC definitions were related to the model of 
Organizational Culture by [8] in one way or another. [9] 
defines ISC as the belief of individual employees on the 
value of complying with information security standards and 
policies. The latest definition by [10] refers to ISC as the 
collection of perceptions, attitudes, values, assumptions, and 
knowledge that guide the human 
interaction with 
information assets in [an] organization with the aim of 
influencing employees’ behavior to preserve the information 
security. 
Although there is quite a number of definitions, [1] 
suggested that there seems to be a common understanding 
that ISC “consists of a shared pattern of values, mental 
models 
and 
activities 
that 
are 
traded 
among 
an 
organisation’s employees over time, affecting information 
security”. In terms of ISC conceptualization, there are 
basically two approaches available in literature. The first 
one is in the form of general aspect of ISC construct 
measured by several reflective indicators such as in 
[11][12]. The second conceptualization approach treats ISC 
as a multidimensional second-order construct, such as in 
[13][14]. According to [15], “a multidimensional construct 
is a single theoretical concept that is measured by several 
related constructs”. Using this second approach, ISC is 
conceptualizing as a Higher-Order Construct (HOC) 
consisting of several lower-order latent constructs. These 
lower-order latent constructs are the indicators of ISC 
construct, 
where 
constructs 
are 
described 
as 
multidimensional when their indicators are themselves 
latent constructs [16]. 
Compared to the first approach, the conceptualization of 
multi-dimensional second-order is useful when a greater 
specificity of understanding is warranted in case of a 
theoretical construct [17]. [18] in their security behavior 
study has suggested that whereas two or three measurement 
items might suffice to define a construct of peripheral 
interest, a multi-dimensional construct allows researchers to 
develop items that describe a construct in terms of multiple 
sub-constructs and making the nature of the construct 
clearer and more visible. Moreover, ISC is a complex 
concept and according to [16][19], a complex concept 
should be modelled as a multidimensional construct so as to 
permit a more thorough measurement and analysis. This is 
consistent with [20] that suggested ISC security culture is a 
multidimensional concept that has often been investigated in 
a simplistic manner. 
In our previous studies [5][6], we adopted the general 
concepts of Organizational Culture by [8] and ISC by [21] 
to formulate the dimensions used to represent the ISC 
concept, as illustrated in Figure 1. These works produced an 
ISC concept in seven dimensions, namely Procedural 
Countermeasures (PCM), Risk Management (RM), Security 
Education, 
Training 
and 
Awareness 
(SETA), 
Top 
Management Commitment (TMC), Monitoring (MON), 
Information Security Knowledge (ISK) and Information 
Security Knowledge Sharing (ISKS).  
 
 
Figure 1.  Formulation of ISC Dimensions [6] 
Review of literature also revealed that the ISC concept is 
associated with these seven dimensions as discussed in [5] 
[6]. In order words, there are theoretical and empirical 
findings that suggest all the seven dimensions are 
influencing 
ISC. 
Although 
these 
dimensions 
are 
conceptually distinct, at a more abstract level, each can be 
viewed as describing a different facet of the overall 
construct of ISC [16][22][23]. These seven dimensions are 
forming the ISC construct, suggesting that the relationship 
between the ISC construct and its lower-order constructs is 
formatively similar to prior study [14]. This type of 
relationship is also referred to as aggregate by [16]. An 
aggregate construct ‘combines or aggregates specific 
dimensions into a general concept’, with the relationships 
flowing from the dimensions to the construct [24].

RESEARCH METHOD 
A. Measures 
This pilot study employed survey methodology to 
validate the proposed ISC model. Table I shows a summary 
of items used in this study to measure the respective 
constructs of ISC dimensions. The total measures were 30 in 
the questionnaire to represent the seven ISC dimensions. 
According to the table, most of the measurement items in 
this study are taken directly from prior tested and validated 
studies. The usage of previously validated instruments is 
strongly recommended in information system research [25] 
and it will increase and assure the content validity and 
reliability of the items used for the constructs in the study 
[26]. Only items of ISK were not directly adopted from the 
previous studies. The development of the items for this 
construct was based on literature analysis on this construct 
particularly in [21][27]–[30]. Additionally, the existing

scales in the literature also adapted in developing the items. 
All items were captured using a 7-point Likert scale ranging 
from (1) Strongly Disagree to (7) Strongly Agree to provide 
a more accurate view of their attitudes and perceptions [31]. 
Although most of the items in the questionnaires were 
adopted and adapted from the previous studies, a series of 
pre-tests have been conducted to ensure the validity for the 
context of this study. The responses from these tests were 
used to improve and refine the questionnaires.

B. Sample Design and Data Collection 
The data for this pilot study are collected using an online 
survey conducted for the duration of two weeks at one 
selected public university in Malaysia. The questionnaires’ 
survey is designed using Google form and all responses are 
stored in the Google drive. In this cross-sectional survey, the 
invitations to participate were sent to respondents via e-mail 
with the survey’s questionnaires attachment.  
Since this is a pilot study conducted as a preliminary test 
before the actual study, the survey was targeted to get a 
minimum sample size that was appropriate to validate the 
model. The survey managed to get 92 respondents. Five 
invalid responses were removed from 92 due to having the 
same responses to all the questions (straight lining) and 
outliers. The final accepted samples were 87. 
Specifically, the sample size calculation for this study 
has employed statistical power and effect size as suggested 
by [3] and recommended by [38]. This rule takes the 
number of maximum arrows pointed to a construct in the 
model, significance level and R2 into consideration in 
calculating the minimum sample size. In our research 
model, since the maximum arrow pointed to ISC is the 
maximum, which is 7, according to [38], the minimum 
sample size of 80 is required to achieve a statistical power 
of 80% for detecting R2 values of at least 0.25 (with a 5% 
probability of error). Therefore, 87 samples are appropriate 
for this study. 
The ISC concept in this study is operationalized as a 
formative 
second-order 
construct 
formed 
by 
seven 
dimensions of first-order constructs. Each dimension is 
representing a strategy or principle element of ISC in an 
organization. This is consistent with [39] that used lower-
order constructs to represent dimensions of strategic key 
components of instrumental and symbolic constructs. By 
using this approach, we could analyze the weights of the 
lower-order constructs to examine their relationship with 
ISC so that we could know which dimensions have 
relevance and significance in contributing to the ISC 
concept.  
 
IV. 
RESULT AND ANALYSIS 
A. Common Method Bias 
Since data for the dependent and independent variables 
are provided by the same respondent, there is possible bias 
called Common Method Bias (CMB) or Common Method 
Variance (CMV) in the data collected. To test this bias, 
Harman’s Single Factor Test [40] has been conducted. An 
unrotated factor analysis of all items yielded seven factors, 
the largest of which accounted for 47.55 percent of the 
variance. As an additional test, the correlation matrix [41] 
was examined to identify any highly correlated constructs (r 
> 0.90). The results have shown that all constructs had 
correlations below the threshold, which is less than 0.90. 
From these two tests, we conclude that the CMV bias is not 
a serious threat in this study. 
B. Respondents’ Profiles 
Table II shows the profiles of respondents involved in this 
study. The respondents have a fair distribution of gender, 
with the majority of them being Malay. Most of them work 
in academics, followed by administration and management 
employees. In terms of highest academic qualification, the 
majority of the respondents had a Bachelor Degree or 
higher. The majority of the respondents had more than 5 
years’ experience working at this university.

In summary, these demographic profiles show that the 
sample consists of appropriate sampling across the 
organization. 
C. Data Analysis 
The study employed the PLS-SEM to validate the 
model. The main reason is the model constitutes both 
reflective and formative constructs and also violates the 
assumption of multivariate normality [42][43]. PLS-SEM 
also has been commonly used by different scholars and 
provides a robust way to analyse the survey data [44][45]. 
Furthermore, PLS-SEM requires small sample sizes to 
conduct a valid analysis [46] compared to other techniques 
and all these criteria made PLS-SEM the most appropriate 
technique to be used in this pilot study. The Smart PLS 
(version 3.2.4; [47]) software was used to run the analysis 
by applying the technique of bootstrapping in order to 
evaluate the factor loadings’ significance and path 
coefficients. Following the widely adopted two-step 
approach to SEM [48], the quality of the measurement 
model for all first-order constructs and second-order 
constructs were assessed first to ensure the validity and 
reliability of the measurements.  Then, the structural model 
was analyzed by estimating the paths between the model’s 
constructs 
determining 
the 
significance 
of 
path 
relationships. 
 
1) Estimation of HOC in PLS-SEM through Repeated 
Indicator Approach 
In repeated indicator, a higher-order latent variable can 
be constructed by specifying a latent variable that represents 
all the manifest variables of the underlying lower-order 
latent variables [49]–[51]. In this study, the higher-order 
factor, which is the ISC construct, is created using the 
indicators of its lower-order factors, which are PCM, RM, 
SETA, TMC, MON, ISM and ISKS. Table III shows ISC as 
a second-order construct constitutes seven dimensions of 
PCM, RM, SETA, TMC, MON, ISK and ISKS as 
underlying first-order constructs, each with their specific 
manifest variables.  
By using this approach, the estimation of all the latent 
variables could be done simultaneously rather than 
estimating the higher-order and lower-order constructs 
separately [52]. Therefore, this estimation will avoid the 
interpretational 
confounding 
by 
taking 
the 
whole 
nomological network into consideration [39]. This approach 
is suitable since the primary objective of this study is to 
investigate the relationships of seven dimensions towards 
the ISC concept, which determines the appropriateness of 
these dimensions in representing the ISC concept.

Specifically, this study employed repeated indicator 
approach with Mode A and path weighting scheme to model 
the second-order factors in the PLS analysis. According to 
[53], Mode A corresponds to correlation weights derived 
from bivariate correlations between each indicator and the 
construct. Mode B corresponds to regression weights, the 
standard in ordinary least squares regression analysis. 
Formative type models are commonly estimated by using 
Mode A for the repeated indicators, in the case the first-order 
constructs are reflective [53]–[55]. Furthermore, Mode A is 
more suitable since the aim for this particular assessment is 
to validate the relationship between each dimension with ISC 
concept rather than the regression of dimensions towards the 
ISC concept. In this study, since the seven ISC dimensions 
have been taken as the reflective first-order construct but as 
formative 
indicators 
for the 
second-order construct, 
therefore, Mode A was used for the higher-order repeated 
indicators. 
 
2) Assessment of Measurement Model 
Figure 2 shows the factors’ loadings and path coefficient 
obtained from the PLS-Algorithm. Table IV shows the 
results of Cronbach’s Alpha, Composite Reliability (CR) 
and Average Variance Extracted (AVE) that measures all 
items for first-order constructs. It shows that Cronbach’s 
Alpha for each construct exceeds the threshold of 0.70 [56], 
AVE is greater than 0.50  [26] and CR is greater than 0.80 
[55]. This means that the measurements are acceptable. In 
terms of loadings, all items are loaded highly on their own 
latent variable, and thus all measurements have satisfactory 
levels of reliability.

The analysis of discriminant validity using Heterotrait-
Monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT) revealed that all 
values are below 0.90 [57], which indicates that 
discriminant validity has been established for all first-order 
constructs in the model. 
 
3) Second-Order Construct Assessment 
In assessing ISC as a second-order formative construct, 
this study used the recommendation in [58], by incorporating 
3 evaluations, which are convergent validity; collinearity 
issues; as well as significance and relevance of formative 
indicators.  
In measuring convergent validity, a global item of ISC 
that has been collected together in data collection was used 
to evaluate the path coefficient of the ISC construct, as 
illustrated in Figure 3. The result shows that the path 
coefficient is more than 0.70 and this suggests that the 
convergent validity was established.  
 
 
Figure 3.  Convergent Validity Assessment 
In terms of collinearity, Table V shows that the variance 
inflation factors (VIF) values for all ISC dimensions range 
from 1.95 to 3.75, which are below 5, thus indicating 
satisfactory reliability [59]. The results therefore, did not 
indicate a multicollinearity problem and support the 
formative nature of ISC.

Table V also shows that the weight of each ISC 
dimension is above the recommended value of 0.10 [49]. All 
these weights of formative indicators also have significant t-
values and have provided an empirical support to retain all 
the indicators [60].  
Finally, in order to show the model’s predictive 
relevance, a blindfold procedure has been done. The Q2 
values estimated by the blindfold procedure represent a 
measure of how well the path model can predict the 
originally observed values. The results of this procedure 
revealed that Q2 value of ISC construct is more than 0.35 [3] 
and this implies that the exogenous constructs have large 
predictive relevance for ISC construct. 
 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
This pilot study has provided several important findings 
to be highlighted. First, since the measurement model 
assessments indicate that all items have passed all the criteria 
such as reliability and validity, this means all the items used 
in this study are capable to measure the particular constructs 
used in this pilot study and could be used in our next larger 
scale study. Second, by using the latest approaches and 
techniques especially by [58], this study empirically proved 
that the ISC concept is a formative second-order construct 
that is formed by seven first-order constructs of Procedural 
Countermeasures (PCM), Risk Management (RM), Security 
Education, 
Training 
and 
Awareness 
(SETA), 
Top 
Management Commitment (TMC), Monitoring (MON), 
Information Security Knowledge (ISK) and Information 
Security Knowledge Sharing (ISKS). This also empirically 
proved that seven dimensions formulated based on 
Organizational Culture by [8] and ISC conceptual framework 
by [21] are relevant and significant in contributing the 
underlying concept of ISC.  
Although the sample population is limited to only one 
Malaysia public university settings, however, this findings 
shed some lights on the ISC concept for this particular 
organization as ISC is depending on organizational type and 
size [60][61], as well as the national culture [62][63]. 
Finally, since there is no common agreement on ISC 
definition and concept especially with regard to factors or 
dimensions [2], this study provides a new insight in the 
literature by providing a new holistic concept of ISC based 
on 
comprehensive 
dimensions 
to 
fill 
these 
gaps. 
Furthermore, since each dimension is representing an aspect 
of ISC, the findings from the studies that conceptualize ISC 
as multidimensional formative second-order construct 
provide clearer guidelines on aspects of ISC cultivation 
compared to another type of construct. 
 
VI. 
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
Although this study provided promising findings on 
conceptualization 
and operationalization of 
the 
ISC 
construct, however, this is only a pilot study conducted on a 
small scale using minimum sample size in order to assess the 
adequacy of research instruments and selected research 
methodology before the larger scale of actual study could be 
conducted. Moreover, although the sample size used in this 
study met the requirement for data analysis in PLS-SEM as 
suggested by [38], a bigger sample size is required to 
convincingly generalize the findings to the population under 
study. In the next study, we are planning to collect more data 
from all public universities in Malaysia so that the findings 
could be convincingly generalized to this population. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
 
Experts and scholars recommended cultivating ISC in 
guiding employee’s security behavior in the organizations. 
However, the conceptualization and operationalization of 
ISC is still unclear and need to be addressed properly. This 
study conceptualizes and operationalizes ISC construct that 
has been developed in our previous works. The findings 
confirmed that ISC is a multidimensional second-order 
construct that significantly formed by seven dimensions 
formulated 
based on 
widely 
accepted concepts of 
Organizational Culture and ISC.
