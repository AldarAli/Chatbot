Abstract— Wireless sensor networks are often used to monitor 
and measure physical characteristics from remote or hostile 
environments. In these conditions, data accuracy is a very 
important aspect for the way these applications complete their 
objectives. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for 
detecting wireless sensors anomalies. Our methodology relies 
on an ensemble-based system, composed of multiple binary 
classifiers adequately selected to implement a complex 
decisional system on network base station. 
Keywords- wireless sensor networks, ensemble-based systems, 
sensors anomalies, data accuracy. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are collections of 
small hardware devices responsible for monitoring and 
detecting different kinds of events, in almost any types of 
environments. Very often, the correctness of the measured 
values provided by each sensor node is a critical factor for 
the evolution of the investigated environments. Therefore, 
for a WSN application it is very important to have robust and 
fail safe sensors that expose correct measurements and, 
respectively, to receive and work with correct sets of data. 
There are situations when one or several network sensors 
measurements are affected by a deliberate or an accidental 
anomaly, 
anomaly 
that 
can 
cause 
erroneous 
data, 
compromising the objectives of the entire network. These 
behaviors are usually caused by sensor hardware related 
problems or by security attacks, especially, intrusion attacks 
for compromising node and network data. 
Previous relevant researches in the field of anomaly 
detection are developed around single binary classifiers that 
decide if the wireless sensor network activity is normal or 
abnormal by comparing the actual state of the WSN nodes 
with an intricate model of “correct behavior”. This stratagem 
was implemented in different forms using intelligent 
algorithms. 
In [1], Bhuse and Gupta enforce the idea of reusing the 
already available system information that is generated by 
different protocols, at various layers of the network. Their 
method incurs very little additional cost and thus is ideally 
suited for resource constrained WSNs. 
The research described in [2] proposes a novel scheme to 
detect anomalies based on the localization of sensor nodes, 
called LAD – Localization Anomaly Detection. The scheme 
takes advantage of the deployment knowledge that is 
available in many sensor network applications and is 
implemented in a distributed way at the sensor node level. 
Another interesting anomaly detection scheme is 
depicted in [3]. The proposed approach is able to detect 
anomalies accurately by employing only significant features 
of in-network data signals. For this, the authors used a 
mixture between the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) 
and a competitive learning neural network called Self-
Organizing Map (SOM). 
In [4], a cooperative monitoring scheme to detect the 
displacements of sensor nodes by the cooperation of 
implicated nodes is described. The methodology is mainly 
based on the feasible Received Signal Strength Indicator 
(RSSI) values to collect the data of anomalous actions in 
WSNs. 
In our paper, we propose a new approach for tackling 
these kinds of issues by implementing a powerful anomaly 
detection mechanism using an Ensemble-Based System 
(EBS). This ensemble-based system consists of multiple 
binary classifiers, each classifying every network node 
functioning as being accurate or erroneous. In our view, 
when 
dealing 
with 
dynamic 
and 
complex 
WSN’s 
environments, we can model this proper functioning state 
based on past measurements recorded by the investigated 
node and respectively, on measurements recorded by all 
adjacent nodes. 
Numerous research studies have exposed that EBS can 
outperform the single classifier approach [5]-[7]. The 
motivation behind this result is that by combining diverse 
and accurate models, we may improve the ensemble decision 
over each single classifier decision. The keystone of every 
EBS is represented by the notion of diversity between base 
classifiers which plays a crucial role in the success of 
ensemble learning techniques [8]. Intuitively classifiers are 
diverse if they make different errors. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
describes the proposed methodology. Section 3 presents the 
implementation and a case study. Finally, conclusions and 
future works are offered in Section 4.

METHODOLOGY FOR ENSEMBLE-BASED ANOMALY 
DETECTION  
Generally, sensor anomalies are handled by dedicated 
rule-based decisional systems.  For taking node behavior 
related decisions, it makes more sense to “ask” more than 
one decision making entities, because this practice assures 
undoubtedly a better, more informed, and trustable final 
decision.

Figure 1.  WSN with ensemble-based system at base station level 
We name these decisional instances as classifiers or 
experts, and their collection an ensemble-based system 
[8][9].  
Assuming that all the transmitted data within the network 
is confidential, the network may be a target for security 
attacks. In this paper, we address only those security attacks 
that try to prevent the network from the correct functioning 
by injecting erroneous sensor measurements. Worst, the 
network could experience hardware failures for one or more 
attached 
sensors 
that 
also 
mean 
erroneous 
sensor 
measurements. We developed and used an ensemble-based 
system to periodically investigate and detect each and every 
sensor node’s anomaly. As presented in Fig. 1, this ensemble 
contains several binary classifiers that separately classify the 
state of each sensor as “reliable” or “unreliable”. All the 
classifier outputs will be aggregated and the final ensemble 
decision will be generated, using a specific combination 
pattern [10]. The final ensemble decision will be further used 
by the base station to take all the required actions for the 
unreliable nodes. 
The proposed methodology describes how the ensemble-
based system is designed and used, and consists in the 
following set of steps: 
 
• 
Step 1. First step in building the EBS is to choose 
both, the network data that needs to be classified, 
and the classification results set. Data for 
classification represents the measurements gathered 
by a specific node A, at a specific moment in time . 
Regarding the classification results, all possible 
results of a classification are called classes and form 
a set like: 
{
ω ,...,ωC }
1
 ,  
(1) 
where each 
i
ω  represents a label or property 
associated with the classified data, andC represents 
the cardinal or the results set. In the case of 
anomaly detection, binary classification is used, 
meaning that we deal with only two possible 
classes: 
1
ω  - accurate data, labeled as “0” and 
2
ω  - 
erroneous data, labeled as “1”.  
 
• 
Step 2. In the second phase, the number of 
classifiers and their input data boundary are 
decided. In the case of a WSN cluster the EBS input 
data are represented by past measurements gathered 
by the node A and respectively, past and present 
measurements gathered by each of the node A 
neighbors
xk (t)
, where k  represents one of the 
neighbor nodes.  
 
• 
Step 3. In the third phase, we design and train all 
classifiers. For EBS, when it comes to designing 
classifiers, there are several approaches that can be 
used, depending on the type of data and the real 
application [11]. All the designed classifiers need to 
be trained with real or sampled data accordingly to 
each classification class
i
ω . Structurally, each 
classifier may contain prediction based algorithms, 
decisional trees and other artificial intelligence 
algorithms. As presented in (2), each classifier 
makes a hypothesis
h j (t)
, indicating the class 
which better suits the classified data.

(2) 
• 
Step 4. The obtained classifiers form the EBS 
residing at base station level. Through a data 
acquisition interface, every measurement provided 
by a node A is classified by the ensemble-based 
system within the base station. This happens for a 
64

fixed period of time and always ends by issuing  
h j (t)
 hypothesis. 
 
• 
Step 5. All the classifiers results, 
h j (t)
, are then 
combined using a voting schema for taking the final 
ensemble decision. In this context, there are several 
approaches for combining classifiers results, some 
of them requiring additional trained classifiers, 
while others requiring only the 
h j (t)
  hypothesis 
[12]. The class 
i
ω  that obtains the greatest number 
of votes
Vi (t)
 is established as the final ensemble 
decision. A simple vote 
vij (t)
 indicates that 
hypothesis 
h j (t)
 selected the class
i
ω , in other 
words, the classifier with j index, selected the class 
with i index. As presented in (3) and (4) the total 
number of votes 
iV  for the class  
i
ω  counts all 
simple votes for that class.

The 
i
ω  class is chosen as final ensemble decision if 
it was chosen by at least one more than half the 
number of the classifiers; e.g: when having an 
ensemble of three classifiers, a decision is taken 
when at least two of three classifiers pass the same 
vote.  
 
• 
Step 6. After the ensemble final decision has been 
taken, if the investigated node is found as having 
sensor anomalies, the network base station acts in 
consequence and excludes node’s sensor from 
network functioning sensors sets for a limited 
period of time. As an example, this can be achieved 
based on the following rule: if the EBS indicated at 
least three times that the node A suffers from a 
sensor anomaly, the base station decides to 
inactivate the sensor. The base station could later 
reuse 
the 
sensor 
after 
repeating 
the 
EBS 
investigation for testing if new readings became 
appropriate. 
III. 
IMPLEMENTATION AND CASE STUDY 
For demonstrating the above concept and methodology 
we performed a case study that assumes the existence of a 
clustered 
WSN 
responsible 
for 
the 
temperature 
measurements into an unsupervised environment. Using an 
experimental network composed of nine Crossbow-Imote2 
nodes equipped with ITS400 sensors boards, we developed 
an ensemble-based system that detects sensor measurements 
anomalies.  
The experimental network measures the temperature in 
nine locations 
θ(t)
 and reports all measurements to a base 
station machine, through a gateway. This process is repeated 
for a fixed period of time. The measured temperature has 
values from 21°C to 21.6 °C. We simulate erroneous 
measurements gathered by a certain node of the network 
(node A), by artificially increasing the node A measured 
temperature using a heat lamp placed in the vicinity of node 
A at three distinct moments in the supervised period T. We 
designed and used three binary classifiers: 
 
1.

C - an average based classifier that receives all 
present measurements of each of the node’s A 
neighbors and computes an average measurement 
value as presented in (5).

C  consists of an average computing 
block that provides a value that will be subtracted 
from the current measurement value of the sensor 
A. If the absolute value of the result exceeds a given 
threshold 
εC1
then the measurement provided by 
the node A is classified as abnormal. 
 
2.

C - an autoregressive predictor based classifier that 
receives all past measurements of the node A and 
predicts its current measurement as shown in (6):

of a 3rd order autoregressive predictor that provides 
an estimated measurement for the sensor A that will 
be subtracted from the current measurement value 
of sensor A. If the absolute value of the result 
exceeds 
a 
given 
threshold 
εC2
then 
the 
measurement provided by the node A is classified 
as abnormal. The autoregressive predictor is 
designed and used similar as in [13].

value of the result exceeds a given threshold 
εC3
then the measurement provided by the node A 
is classified as abnormal. 
In order to illustrate how our methodology works, we 
gathered temperature values from a group of nine sensor 
nodes placed in an indoor environment. The measurements 
provided by the sensor under investigation (sensor A) were 
intentionally perturbed using a heat lamp at three instants in 
time (t=15, t=20 and t=27 seconds). The temperature time 
series for sensor A and two of its neighbors are presented in 
Fig.2.

The required heterogeneity of the three binary classifiers 
included in ensemble plays its role, resulting different 
classifier hypothesis (Figs. 3a, 3b and 3c). Even if none of 
the classifiers works accurately in every situation, the 
ensemble decision obtained through the voting procedure is 
correct proving the power of ensemble (Fig. 3d).

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS  
Whenever we take a decision we want to have confidence 
in what we have decided. This is also applicable for all 
technical systems in general and wireless sensor network 
applications in particular. Being exposed to numerous risks, 
WSN often implement and use complex decisional systems 
for controlling their lifecycle, processed data and external 
threats [14]. In this paper we proposed an anomaly detection 
solution for WSN sensors using an ensemble-based system. 
The main advantage brought by this solution is that the final 
decision is taken based on the interrogation of multiple and 
different systems. 
To fully assess the expected benefits, we continue to go 
further by improving the ensemble with new binary 
classifiers based on Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference 
Systems (ANFIS) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) and by 
automating the training and tuning processes of individual 
classifiers base on pair-wise diversity metrics.
