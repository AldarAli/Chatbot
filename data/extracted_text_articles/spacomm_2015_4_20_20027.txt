Abstract—Spaceborne membrane phased array is prone to 
distortion due to lack of mechanical rigidity. Distortion 
introduces phase errors between array elements which will 
significantly degrade antenna performance, such as directivity 
and sidelobe level. An innovative self-calibration method was 
invented to compensate phase errors with minimum equipment 
involved. Using the un-calibrated array itself to transmit and 
receive ground reflective signal, the phase errors between 
elements can be estimated and then be compensated. Simulation 
demonstrated the principle of the algorithm and show promising 
results for further investigation.  
Keywords—membrane phased array; spaceborne antenna; 
calibration

INTRODUCTION 
Future space missions need low mass, low cost and high 
packaging efficiency structures to reduce launch cost, stow 
volume and production costs. The innovation of highly 
deployable membrane phased array antenna satisfies the 
requirements and promise wide application in future space 
missions. 
Spaceborne membrane phased array antenna (Figure 1) is 
manufactured on light weight membrane structures. This 
technology enables the use of larger antennas for high speed 
space communication and low frequency earth observation. 
Some earth remote sensing applications, such as soil moisture 
and ocean salinity, need the antenna to be physically large in 
order to obtain the necessary resolution at the frequencies of 
interest (low frequency). Membrane antenna also makes it 
possible to place huge Synthesized Aperture Radar (SAR) 
systems on Medium or Geosynchronous Earth Orbits (MEO or 
GEO) to compensate signal space loss and improve the field of 
view for earth observation which would lead to much shorter 
revisit times in comparison to satellites in a Low Earth Orbit 
(LEO). Moreover, membrane antenna is a key enabling 
technology for miniaturized satellite, for example, CubeSat, for 
its super light weight and high stow efficiency. 
The forerunner in this research field is Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory 
(JPL) 
where 
a 
membrane 
phased 
array 
demonstrator has been built including structure, radiator and 
electronics design. The primitive demonstrator has shown huge 
reduction of mass in comparison with traditional phased array 
antenna [1][2]. 
When applying membrane phased array to real system, 
there are many technical problems need to be solved. One of 
them is as the result of lack of mechanical rigidity; membrane 
structure is prone to distortion. Such distortion may be 
introduced during launch vibration, during folding and 
expending or caused by long term thermal effect. Besides, as 
fabricated on such highly elastic structure, antenna array will 
vibrate when spacecraft maneuvers, as happened in dual side 
looking SAR operations. Both of mechanical distortion and 
structure vibration generate relative displacements between 
array elements which will significantly degrade radiation 
performance of the array as a whole. Therefore, these 
displacements need to be calibrated, that is, to estimate and 
compensate the relative phase differences of antenna elements.

 There are some existing technologies to calibrate array 
element displacement and radiation pattern. As introduced in 
[3][4], the phase differences between array elements can be 
accurately measured by near field probe antenna attached on 
the spacecraft. The advantage of this technology is it can 
correct the phase errors with high accuracy. The major 
disadvantage is extra mass and cost, increased inherent 
technical risk to the spacecraft as the near field probe requires 
more mechanical structure.  
Another method measure the phase differences between 
array elements with pre-installed ground transmitters, receivers 
or corner reflectors [5][6]. The process is time consuming and 
costs a lot of labor.  
A more convenient scheme use reflective signal from 
illuminated patch to calibrate the antenna [7]. This kind of 
technology is more convenient because no ground facilities are 
needed. It processes signal reflected from noncoherent ground 
scatterers and takes advantage of the statistical properties of the 
backscattered clutter signal to estimate phase errors in the array 
[8]. The key idea is that a homogeneous clutter scene will make 
the phase of the ensemble correlation between signals received

by adjacent array elements equal to zero. Thus, any variation 
from this zero phase correlation attributes to relative phase 
error between the two elements and therefore can be used to 
calibrate the array.  
A large number of nonrigid scatterers, which are uniformly 
distributed and with random relative motions, can provide the 
required noncoherence, for example, sea waves and rainforest. 
And a well calibrated transmitting antenna installed on the 
spacecraft is also needed to illuminate the patch for the 
required homogeneous clutter scene. 
Our algorithm is based on such noncoherent scatterer 
algorithms, the difference from former ones is that the 
independent well calibrated transmitting antenna has been 
removed to reduce support structure complexity. Although 
adding some computation complexity, our method minimized 
the structure demand, reduced cost, and achieved real self-
calibration by using uncalibrated antenna array to calibrate 
itself. Since the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna 
is the same array. This algorithm can calibrate transmit channel 
and receive channel at the same time. Theoretical description 
of the algorithm is in Section II, followed by simulation 
demonstration in Section III, and finally concluded in Section 
IV.  
II. 
ALGORITHM 
Unlike 
the 
well 
calibrated 
illuminating 
antenna, 
transmitting signal with the uncalibrated antenna array can’t 
generate the homogeneous clutter scene we need. But when 
randomize transmitting phase in each pulse and accumulate 
different pulses, we can achieve equivalent result as required 
from homogeneous clutter scene. The underlying principle of 
our algorithm is presented here. 
The signal received by i th element is:

where 
( )
ie n  is the received signal at each sampling time when 
there is no phase error between adjacent elements. Since phase 
errors exist, the signal phase will change. 
iφ  is for electronics 
delay of different channel, 
id  is physical displacement of the 
array element deviated from its nominal position and 
iη  is 
measurement noise. Since λ  is the wavelength, 2
id /
π
λ  is the 
phase difference from displacement. The phase delay from 
electronics and displacement can be added together to 
iδ . As it   
will be showed in following description, our algorithm can 
actually estimate electronics and displacement phase change at 
the same time which is favorable for real system application. If 
we set the phase of one element as reference phase, then we 
only need to estimate the phase difference between reference 
element and other elements

For convenience, we give the theoretical analysis of one-

f x  is radar backscattering coefficient. 
ir  is distance 
from array element to ground scatterers as show in Figure 2. 
Figure 2 visualized the one-dimensional situation, where two

be taken as reference. The vertical distance from antenna array 
to ground is h . 
wT ( )
x  is ground project of antenna array 
transmitting pattern and 
wR ( )
x  is the receiving pattern of 
individual element. 4π  is for two-way distance delay include 
both transmitting and receiving path. Since the unknown array 
element displacement, we have no idea of the radiation pattern 
of the transmitting array. Nevertheless, we can randomize the 
transmitting array phase at each pulse and average the 
receiving signal from pulse to pulse. As draw in Figure 2, 
transmitting beam pattern is completely randomized.

. This 
means if antenna array elements are microstrip patches, our

In fact, the analysis above also guarantee that as long as array 
element radiation pattern is symmetric which is real for most 
applications, the algorithm will work well.

c  represents the speed of light, r  is distance between radar 
and a scatterer, then the round-trip time delay is 2 /

received signal is multiplied by factor

the scatterer reflectivity as well as the elevation angle θ  and 
azimuth angle β , and

geometrical features are statistically homogeneous over the

Figures 4 and 5 showed the simulation results. The array 
was constructed by 64 elements. Given working frequency 
1.5GHz, we design the patch firstly. The up sides of Figure 4 
and 5 is the radiation pattern before calibration, the down sides 
are after calibration. 
Simulation results proved the efficiency of the algorithm. 
Phase errors between elements can be estimated and calibrated 
with high accuracy. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
A problem when applying membrane phased array to real 
system is that the light weighted non-rigid membrane structure 
is prone to distortion. As the result of distortion, relative 
position of array radiation element will change and cause 
relative phase errors which dramatically degrade antenna 
performance and imaging capability. Therefore, these phase 
errors need to be calibrated and compensated. By measuring 
the correlation of backscattered clutter signal from noncoherent 
ground homogeneous scatterers, unknown phase errors 
between array elements can be estimated. The problem of non-
uniform illumination arise from unfocused array can be tackled 
by average pulses with randomized transmitting phase. 
Simulation result showed even when the array is completely 
unfocused, the algorithm can still work. 
Randomized radiation pattern will reduce imaging power in 
real system which may generate some other problems. Since 
the array will not completely unfocused at the first time, the 
decrease of transmitting power will not affect the efficiency of 
our algorithm, however, phase error estimation accuracy may 
be affected which need further investigation.
