Abstract—This paper is concerned with channel modeling
and capacity evaluation of the multilevel ﬂash memory with m
levels. The m-level ﬂash memory channel (m-LFMC) is modeled
as an m-amplitude-modulation channel with input-dependent
additive Gaussian noise whose standard deviation depends on
the channel input. Then the capacity of an m-LFMC is given.
The determination of the capacity can be transformed into
a two-step optimization problem, which can be numerically
solved by an alternating iterative algorithm. This algorithm
delivers not only the optimal input/level distribution but also
the optimal values of levels. This algorithm also delivers the
optimized number of levels at any given voltage-to-deviation
ratio. Numerical results are presented to show the consistency
with well-known Smith’s results for the amplitude-limited AWGN
channel and the applicability of the modeling method.

I. INTRODUCTION
As the demand for non-volatile data storage increases, ﬂash
memories are gaining attention. The original ﬂash memory
used only two levels to store one bit in one memory cell.
However, a modern mainstream ﬂash memory is a multilevel
ﬂash memory (MLFM), which stores more than one bit in one
memory cell to improve the storage density and reduce the bit
cost of ﬂash memories. The ﬁrst MLFM product was presented
by Bauer et al. in [1], which had four levels and stored two bits
in one memory cell. Later, MLFMs were investigated and/or
designed by many researchers, such as the 4-level MLFM
in [2] and the Intel StrataFlashTM 4-level memory in [3], the
8-level MLFMs in [4, 5] and the 16-level MLFMs in [6, 7].
As the number of levels increases, the capability of the
MLFM could be enhanced and the reliability could be de-
creased. On one hand, due to the complexity of the conﬁg-
uration (including the programming and reading techniques
and inter-cell interferences), it is complicated to model pre-
cisely the MLFM channel. Hence research on the information-
theoretic channel capacity is sporadic, such as [8, 9]. In [8],
the MLFM was quantized to different discrete memoryless
channels (DMCs) by introducing different reading numbers of
reference voltages. By optimizing the reference voltages, the
mutual information of DMC could be maximized, and then
the achievable rate of the MLFM could be obtained. On the
other hand, to guarantee the reliability, two approaches, i.e.,
signal processing methods and error correcting codes (ECCs),
are investigated and applied in MLFMs. Two examples of
signal processing methods are data postcompensation and data
predistortion [10], which could tolerate cell-to-cell interference
in MLFMs. Examples of ECCs include BCH codes [11], Reed-
Solomon codes [12,13], LDPC codes [8, 14], trellis coded
modulation [11,15, 16] and rank modulation [17,18].
In this paper, we focus on the MLFM with m levels. To
answer the question on the information-theoretic capability
of the MLFM with m levels, we need to solve a key
problem, i.e., channel modeling. The simplest model is the
input-independent additive Gaussian noise channel, which is
also called amplitude-limited AWGN channel [19,20]. In [19,
20], Smith proved that the capacity of the amplitude-limited
AWGN channel is achieved by a unique discrete random
variable taking values on a ﬁnite alphabet. Based on the
current techniques and conﬁguration, there exist two universal
phenomena for the MLFM. One is that the device degrades
with age and the degradation varies from cell to cell as
mentioned in [3, 21]. The other is the cell-to-cell interference
as mentioned in [10,22]. In this paper, we consider only the
former. In this case, we model the m-level ﬂash memory
channel (m-LFMC) as an m-amplitude-modulation (m-AM)
channel with input-dependent additive Gaussian noise (ID-
AGN) whose standard deviation depends on the input (The
m-AM with ID-AGN channel can also be regarded as a
constrained communication system [23,24].). Then we give
the channel capacity and present a numerical method to
evaluate it.
Structure: The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. The channel model of the MLFM with m levels is
introduced in Section II, and the channel capacity is given
in Section III. Section IV presents an alternating iterative
algorithm to evaluate a lower bound on the capacity. Numerical
results and discussions are shown in Section V, followed by
the conclusion in Section VI.
II. CHANNEL MODEL
For an MLFM with m levels, each level has an intended
threshold voltage [1]. Affected by the conﬁguration (includ-
ing the programming and reading techniques and inter-cell
interferences) of the ﬂash memory and device aging, the
threshold voltage shift may vary from cell to cell. Hence,
each level corresponds to a threshold voltage range [1]. In this

paper, we focus on only the variation caused by device aging.
For mathematical modeling, the variation of the threshold
voltage is usually approximated by a Gaussian distribution
and characterized by its probability density function (pdf). The
following example illustrates the models of threshold voltage
distributions for a 4-LFMC.
Example 1 (Threshold Voltage Distributions of a 4-LFMC):
Consider a 4-LFMC. Let the intended voltages of the four
levels be x0 = 0, x1 = 3.25, x2 = 4.55 and x3 = 6.5.
By default, the threshold voltage distribution model of the
manufactured 4-LFMC is shown in Fig. 1, where the noise
at each level has the same variance and the pdf of the output
for each level is depicted. As documented in [3, 21], the
number of electrons of a cell decreases with time and some
cells become defective as time elapses, which means that the
cell has a long but ﬁnite lifetime and the degradation varies
from cell to cell. Consequentially, the performance of the
4-LFMC gets gradually worse as the device ages. Suppose
that, after three years, the threshold voltage distribution
model of the 4-LFMC is shown in Fig. 2, where every level
experiences more noise than in Fig. 1 and the ﬁrst level
x0 is the most noisy level while the other three levels have
almost the same noise. Again, suppose that, after ﬁve years,
the threshold voltage distribution model of the 4-LFMC is
shown in Fig. 3, where every level has even more noise
than in Fig. 2, while the ﬁrst level x0 and the last level x3
are respectively the most noisy levels. This behavior can be
easily modeled by a function σ(x), which depends on the age
of the device. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the dash-dot-dot
curve
√
2πσ(x)
−1 is (approximately) the envelope of the
peaks of the level-output-pdfs. In Fig. 1, the curve σ(x) is
assumed to be a constant, i.e., σ(x) =

Models similar to Figs. 2 and 3 for the 4-LFMC were intro-
duced in [3, 11, 14]. In [3, 11], the model of the 2 bits/cell (i.e.,
4-level) NOR ﬂash memory was presented, in which the ﬁrst
level x0 had the highest noise variance and the last level x3 had
the second highest noise variance while the two middle levels

had almost the same noise variances. In [14], the model of a
4-level NAND ﬂash memory was derived by accounting for
the cell-to-cell interference, in which the ﬁrst level x0 had the
highest Gaussian noise and the other three levels had almost
the same noises characterized by bounded Gaussian variables.
In this paper, an m-LFMC is modeled as an m-AM channel
with ID-AGN. Speciﬁcally, it is characterized as follows.
1) Let X, Y and W denote the channel input, the channel
output and the channel noise random variables, respec-
tively. They have the relation:
Y = X + W.
(1)
2) The channel input X takes values from a ﬁnite alphabet
X (m) ∆= {x0, x1, · · · , xm−1} under the constraint
a ≤ x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xm−2 < xm−1 ≤ b

where a and b are the respective lowest and highest
possible threshold voltages, and their difference is de-
noted by Vm
∆= b−a. The ﬁnite alphabet X (m) is called

the collection of all such m-AM signal sets as X (m),
i.e., X (m) ∈ X (m). In the following context, we also
use the vector notation x to denote the m levels, i.e.,

Note that the solution of (13) may be sub-optimal (a local

Based on the two sub-problems, an alternating iterative
scheme is presented to solve problem (10). At each iteration,
the two-stage alternating strategy shown below is employed.
Stage 1. Fix x. Use BAA to obtain the optimal p∗

(15)
From the discussion of Sub-problem II, x∗ may be a local
solution. This sub-optimality also implies that a lower bound
on the capacity Cm,σ(·) of the m-LFMC is evaluated.
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we numerically compute lower bounds on
capacities of different m-LFMCs using the alternating iterative
scheme of Section IV. We also interpret the results and put
them in context with respect to prior work [19,20].
Let the lowest and highest threshold voltages be a = 0 and
b = 6.5, respectively. Then the difference is Vm = b − a =
6.5. We introduce a new parameter σ > 0 that severs as the
varying noise parameter in our computations. Let qi(x) where
i ∈ {1, 2, 3} be continuous and differentiable functions as
shown in Fig. 4. We consider three different standard deviation
functions σ(x), denoted as
σi(x) = qi(x) · σ, where i ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
(16)
We allow the parameter σ to vary such that the voltage-to-
deviation ratio (VDR) Vm/σ acts as an effective signal-to-
noise ratio. We assume that the intended threshold voltage
level x0 (usually corresponding to the erased state) is 0.
We present results for m ≤ 5, i.e., we consider multilevel
ﬂash memory channels with at most 5 levels. We consider
three different m-LFMCs whose standard deviation functions

are σ1(x), σ2(x) and σ3(x). The lower bounds on capacities
of m-LFMCs with deviation functions σ1(x), σ2(x) and σ3(x)
are shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 7, respectively.
From Fig. 5, we make the following observations.
1) When
the
VDR
is
less
than
10.5
dB,
i.e.,
20 log10(Vm/σ)
≤
10.5
dB, 2-LFMC, 3-LFMC,
4-LFMC and 5-LFMC have the same rates.
2) When the VDR is less than 15.5 dB, 3-LFMC, 4-LFMC
and 5-LFMC have the same rates.
3) When the VDR is less than 18.5 dB, 4-LFMC and 5-
LFMC have the same rates.
Furthermore, we observe (not explicitly shown in the ﬁgure)
that in the VDR regime between 10.5 dB and 15.5 dB, the
optimized lower bound is achieved with m∗ = 3 levels, even
if, say, the constraint allows up to m = 5 levels. This is
consistent with prior work [19,20] which showed that for the
amplitude-limited AWGN channel, the capacity is achieved by
a discrete channel input distribution over a ﬁnite alphabet. In
other words, for a ﬁxed VDR, there is an optimal number
of levels m∗ for a given multilevel ﬂash memory channel.
Increasing the number of levels m beyond m∗ does not further
increase the capacity (nor the computed lower bound.)
These observations imply that 2-LFMC, 3-LFMC and 4-
LFMC can achieve the capacity
Cσ1(·) = max
m Cm,σ1(·)
in the cases of VDR ≤ 10.5 dB, 10.5 dB < VDR ≤ 15.5 dB
and 15.5 dB < VDR ≤ 18.5 dB, respectively. In other words,
in the view of capacity, at a given VDR less than 10.5 dB,
a 2-LFMC is “optimal”; at a given VDR less than 15.5 dB,
a 3-LFMC is “optimal”; at a given VDR less than 18.5 dB,
a 4-LFMC is “optimal”. Naturally, as the VDR increases, the
optimal number of levels doesn’t decrease.
Similar conclusions hold for the other two channels with
noise standard deviation functions σ2(x) and σ3(x). Namely,
even if the constraint is set to be, say, m = 5, at low VDRs
the optimal number of threshold levels m∗ is less than 5.
For example, as shown in Fig. 7, the optimal number of
levels is m∗ = 4 in the VDR regime between 13 dB and

noise depends on the channel input. The capacity of the m-
LFMC was given. The determination of the capacity is an
optimization problem, which can be transformed into two
optimization sub-problems. One can be solved by Blahut-
Arimoto algorithm. The other can be solved by ﬁnding the
solution to KKT conditions. Based on these, an alternating
iterative algorithm was presented to evaluate a lower bound
on the capacity of the m-LFMC. This algorithm delivered not
only the optimal distribution of channel inputs but also the
optimal values of channel inputs. Numerical results showed
that at any given VDR there exists an optimal value m∗ such
that the capacity (or its lower bound) is achieved by an m∗-
LFMC, and that increasing the number of levels m above m∗
does not further increase the information rate for a ﬁxed VDR.

Solving KKT conditions (13) is equivalent to ﬁnding quan-
tities (x, λ, µ) that satisfy the equalities

Note that all quantities Ai, Bi and Ci depend on the input
vector x and the standard deviation function σ(·) when the
pmf p is given. To ﬁnd the solution to the KKT conditions (19)
by an iterative method, we assume that quantities Ai, Bi
and Ci are independent of xi. Then Eqns. (19) have at most
9 × 2m−2 solutions. Moreover, under the full constraints
in (20), the number of solutions may be much less than
9×2m−2 (This happens in our numerical computations). Based
on (19) and (20), we employ an iterative method to ﬁnd a
solution. Suppose that the input vector x(k) is known at the
beginning of the k-th iteration. Then solve Eqns. (19). Pick
those solutions that satisfy all constraints in (20), and from
them choose the one with the highest information rate as the
improved input vector x(k+1).
