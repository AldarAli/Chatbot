Abstract— In this paper, we present three spectrum allocation 
techniques, namely Static and Equal Spectrum Allocation 
(SESA), Flexible and Unequal Spectrum Allocation (FUSA), 
and Countrywide Full Spectrum Allocation (CFSA), and 
evaluate their performances for the 28 GHz millimeter-wave 
spectrum using in-building small cells. We discuss each 
technique broadly by identifying major concerns, presenting 
possible solutions, as well as evaluating performances relative 
to each other in terms of Spectral Efficiency (SE), Energy 
Efficiency (EE), and Cost Efficiency (CE). It is found that 
FUSA improves SE by 22.8%, EE by 18.56%, and CE by 
18.56%, whereas CFSA improves SE by 164.27%, EE by 
74.77%, and CE by 59.64% in comparison with that of SESA. 
As CFSA outperforms SESA and FUSA, CFSA can be 
considered as a potential spectrum allocation technique for the 
existing and next-generation mobile networks to allow a large 
spectrum availability, as well as efficient spectrum utilization, 
for an operator to serve high indoor data rates and capacity 
demands.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Spectrum allocation techniques have a significant impact 
on the efficient utilization of the radio spectrum in mobile 
communication systems [1]. Traditionally, each Mobile 
Network Operator (MNO) in a country is allocated statically 
and exclusively to an equal amount of the licensed spectrum 
(termed as Static and Equal Spectrum Allocation (SESA)) 
for a long term, irrespective of the demand of its users. 
Since the demand for user traffic of different MNOs in a 
country varies with time and locations, the requirements of 
the spectra of MNOs also vary accordingly. Due to this 
phenomenon, a great portion of the allocated spectrum to an 
MNO may be either unused or underutilized [2]-[3], while 
another MNO at the same time and location may suffer from 
an insufficient amount of spectrum. This, in turn, results in 
low spectrum utilization and Quality-of-Service (QoS), 
which raises concerns over how to allocate the spectrum 
among MNOs such that the required user demand can be 
served while ensuring an efficient countrywide spectrum 
utilization. 
One way to address this concern is to allocate spectrum 
to each MNO based on the actual requirement to serve its 
user traffic [4]. In this regard, a simple, yet effective, 
measure to define the actual requirement for an MNO is to 
allocate spectrum flexibly in accordance with its number of 
subscribers. Since the number of subscribers of an MNO is 
usually different from that of other MNOs, such a flexible 
and on-demand spectrum allocation technique allocates an 
unequal amount of spectrum to MNOs (termed as Flexible 
and Unequal Spectrum Allocation (FUSA)), unlike SESA. 
Also, to address frequent variations in the statistics of 
subscribers of MNOs, in FUSA, the allocation of spectrum 
to each MNO needs to be updated in the short term, unlike 
SESA. 
Another key technique to address an efficient spectrum 
utilization and the required QoS is to allow access to the 
countrywide full spectrum to each MNO subject to 
managing Co-Channel Interference (CCI) from one MNO to 
another (termed as Countrywide Full Spectrum Allocation 
(CFSA)). In this regard, since different MNOs have a 
different number of subscribers, an MNO can pay the 
spectrum licensing fee for a short term based on its number 
of subscribers with respect to the total number of 
subscribers countrywide to ensure fairness. Note that CFSA 
takes advantage of allocating a large amount of spectrum to 
each MNO to address the required QoS, as well as the 
dynamic allocation of the spectrum to each MNO 
corresponding to serving its user demand to address an 
efficient countrywide spectrum utilization. Figure 1 shows 
an illustration of allocating the countrywide spectrum to 
MNOs using SUSA, FUSA, and CFSA techniques. 
Since existing and next-generation mobile networks will 
be spectrum hungry to serve a high data rate and a large 
volume of traffic, particularly in urban multistory buildings, 
ensuring high spectrum bandwidth is one of the major 
concerns to MNOs. To address the high bandwidth 
availability for an MNO indoors, the Millimeter-Wave 
(mmWave) spectrum is considered as an effective solution. 
In this regard, the 28 GHz band has been considered as a 
potential mmWave band due to its favorable indoor 
characteristics to address a high data rate and capacity 
demand within a short distance. Hence, in this paper, we 
intend to evaluate the SESA, FUSA, and CFSA techniques 
indoors for 28 GHz spectrum in terms of Spectral Efficiency 
(SE), Energy Efficiency (EE), and Cost Efficiency (CE).

spectrum, CCI can occur in CFSA. We consider the time-
domain CCI management as an example. Hence, to avoid 
CCI in time-domain, we consider time orthogonality in 
allocating the full spectrum to small cell User Equipments 
(UEs) of all MNOs such that in any TTI t Small cell UEs

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
A. Performance Result 
Table I shows selected assumptions and parameters used 
for the performance evaluation. Detailed assumptions and 
parameters can be found in [7]. Figure 2 shows the 
outperformance of FUSA and CFSA techniques with 
respect to the traditional SESA in terms of countrywide SE, 
EE, and CE. It can be seen that FUSA improves SE by 
22.8%, EE by 18.56%, and CE by 18.56%, whereas CFSA 
improves SE by 164.27%, EE by 74.77%, and CE by 
59.64% in comparison with that of SESA. Hence, due to 
allowing dynamic access to the countrywide full mmWave 
spectrum to each MNO to utilize the full spectrum 
efficiently, CFSA provides the best SE, EE, and CE 
performances of all techniques.

B. Issues with CFSA Implementation 
Though CFSA provides the best performances of all 
techniques, a number of issues regarding, for example, its 
implementation, need to be addressed, as indicated below.  
1) CCI management system: A key issue with CFSA is 
the co-channel interference generated when UEs of more 
than one MNO intend to access the countrywide spectrum. 
Though CCI can be managed, it requires additional 
management mechanisms either in time, frequency, or 
power domain, which, in turn, cause additional complexity 
and cost. For example, depending on the spectrum sensing 
techniques, such as either proactive or reactive, as well as 
management 
approaches, 
e.g. 
either 
centralized 
or 
distributed, the control signaling overhead may vary.  More 
specifically, in the centralized management, though the 
global optimization of network performance can be 
obtained, it suffers from a large control signaling overhead 
in the network. In contrast, in the distributed management, 
the control signaling overhead is reduced by allowing the 
local network performance optimization.     
2) Countrywide spectrum manager: Since all MNOs 
access the same countrywide spectrum, a common spectrum 
manager may be necessary to communicate and coordinate a 
timely and fair allocation of the spectrum to each MNO. In 
this regard, the deployment of the spectrum manager, the 
degree of information to be shared by each MNO with the 
spectrum manager, and tight coordination to allocate the 
spectrum among MNOs timely and fairly are a few 
challenges that need to be addressed for the spectrum 
manager.    
3) Spectrum licensing fees: Distributing the licensing 
fee among MNOs in a country and the duration of the 
spectrum license renewed term tr need a common mutual 
understanding among MNOs in a country, which sometimes 
may not be possible due to the competitive nature of MNOs 
in the market. In such a case, the central administration by

the spectrum regulatory bodies may be required to sort out 
the issues among MNOs countrywide [11].   
V. 
CONCLUSION  
In this paper, we have presented three spectrum 
allocation techniques, namely SESA, FUSA, and CFSA, 
and shown that CFSA outperforms SESA and FUSA 
techniques in SE, EE, and CE such that CFSA can be 
considered as a potential spectrum allocation technique for 
Fifth Generation (5G)/Sixth Generation (6G) mobile 
networks.
