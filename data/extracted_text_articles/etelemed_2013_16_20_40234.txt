Abstract— The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the 
usability of a monitoring system that can monitor indicators of 
physical functioning (weight, balance, grip strength, and 
physical activity) in community-dwelling elderly people. 
Monitoring such indicators can identify elderly people who 
could benefit from (preventive) interventions. The system can 
also provide feedback to support elderly people in their self-
management. A geriatrician invited patients aged 70 years or 
older to participate in the pilot study. Participants rated the 
usability of the monitoring system after using the system at 
home for three weeks. Usability was measured on a 7-point 
scale using an adapted version of the Post-Study System 
Usability Questionnaire and by logging errors that occurred in 
a diary. Six participants between 79 and 83 years old were 
included and four of them completed the pilot study. The mean 
usability score was 5.2 (SD .90) and scores ranged from 3.8 to 
6.2. The participants were mostly positive about the usability 
of the monitoring system but some improvements have to be 
made before the system can be implemented and evaluated on 
a larger scale.

 INTRODUCTION 
In community-dwelling elderly people decreases in 
indicators of physical functioning, for example weight, grip 
strength, balance, or physical activity, predict adverse health 
outcomes such as disability, hospitalization and nursing 
home admission [1-3]. If care professionals would be able to 
detect decline in physical functioning in their patients at an 
early stage, interventions could be provided to slow down or 
prevent (further) decline or adverse outcomes. Elderly people 
with a decreased level of physical functioning might be the 
ones who are most likely to benefit from such intervention 
programs.  
Due to the increasing number of elderly people and the 
decreasing number of care professionals, it is not feasible for 
care professionals to assess physical functioning in all their 
patients on a regular basis using physical performance tests.  
As a result, elderly people and care professionals are often 
not aware of decreases in physical indicators at an early stage 
and decline continues until (health) problems arise [4].  
Innovative technologies can play an important role in the 
early identification of decline in physical functioning. Such 
technologies are on the rise and are often used to support 
remote monitoring of health conditions, self-management, 
and the delivery of interventions [5, 6].  
A monitoring and feedback system that can be used by 
elderly people to measure indicators of physical functioning 
on a daily basis was developed by engineers from the 
Université de Technology de Troyes (UTT) and researchers 
from Maastricht University (UM). The monitoring system 
consists of three devices: a bathroom scale for monitoring 
weight and balance, a grip ball for monitoring grip strength, 
and a mobile phone with a built-in accelerometer for 
monitoring physical activity [7-9]. The three devices are 
equipped with Bluetooth® so that the results of all the 
measurements are automatically transferred to the mobile 
phone. Via an application on the mobile phone, elderly 
people receive feedback regarding (changes in their) weight, 
balance, grip strength, and physical activity. Furthermore, 
the phone transfers the data to a database where health care 
professionals have access to the measurements that were 
performed by their patients. This enables care professionals 
to monitor the physical functioning of their patients from a 
distance and can help them in providing adequate and pro-
active care. Figure 1 illustrates how the system works. 
Elderly people and care professionals can collaborate to 
determine realistic and personally relevant goals with regard 
to physical functioning. Self-monitoring of the indicators of 
physical 
functioning 
and 
collaboration 
with 
care 
professionals can support elderly people in their self-
management [10-12].    
The monitoring and feedback system can only reach its 
full potential when elderly people are able to use it in their 
daily lives. To optimize the system’s usability it has been 
developed in close collaboration with elderly people and care 
professionals [13, 14]. During the user-centered development

process, the system was fine-tuned to the needs and 
requirements of the end users as much as possible. Taking 
human and other non-technology issues into consideration 
during the development process increases the usability and 
acceptability of the technology [15, 16]. The aim of this pilot 
study was to test the usability of the bathroom scale and the 
mobile phone in the daily lives of five elderly people. This 
small sample size was chosen because according to Nielsen 
et al. this should be sufficient to identify about 80% of the 
usability problems of a system [17]. The pilot study only 
focused on the usability of the system as experienced by 
elderly people and not on the usability of the database by 
health care professionals. Unfortunately the usability of the 
grip ball could not be tested yet due to problems in its 
production process. 
This paper describes the methods that were used to study 
the usability of the monitoring system and presents 
preliminary results. The discussion will provide an 
interpretation of the results and an overview of the strengths 
and limitations of the study.  
II. 
METHODS 
The methods section describes the design of the study, 
the recruitement of participants, the study procedure, and 
the measurements and analyses that were used to study the 
usability of the monitoring system.  
A. Participants and design 
Participants were recruited via the expertise center for 
elderly care at the Orbis Medical Center in Sittard (the 
Netherlands). Inclusion criteria were: 70 years or older, 
community-dwelling, mobility or functioning problems, 
Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) > 23,   able to step 
onto a bathroom scale independently, and willing to learn 
how to use the interface on the mobile phone. Exclusion 
criteria were: planned admission to a nursing home/hospital 
during the period of the pilot study, being confined to bed, 
serious visual or hearing impairments, and contra-indication 
for exercise. The center’s geriatrician invited eight patients 
who met the inclusion criteria. They received an information 
letter and a consent form via mail. Thereafter, the researcher 
contacted them within two weeks to ask whether they were 
willing to participate or whether they had questions 
regarding the pilot study. Patients who decided to participate 
signed written informed consent. 
Usability of the 
monitoring system (bathroom scale and mobile phone) was 
measured after three weeks follow-up. This study was 
approved by the Medical Ethical Committee Atrium-Orbis-
Zuyd (NL35961.096.11). 
B. Study procedure 
At the start of the study the researcher (JV) visited each 
participant in their home. During that visit, instructions 
regarding the daily use of the bathroom scale and the mobile 
phone were provided to the participants. They also received 
two instruction manuals. The first manual was a simple 
overview of which steps they had to perform on a daily basis 
to monitor their own weight, balance, and activity. The 
second manual provided more detailed information about the 
two devices, using written text and photographs. Once 
instructions were provided, the participants practiced the use 
of the bathroom scale and mobile phone with the researcher 
until they felt confident in their ability to use the system. 
After that, the bathroom scale and mobile phone (+ charging 
hub) were installed in the homes of the participants at a place 
that was convenient for them.  
After the home visit, the participants used the bathroom 
scale and mobile phone on a daily basis for 3 weeks to 
monitor their own weight, balance, and activity. Participants 
could use the bathroom scale between 7:00 and 10:30 A.M. 
They were encouraged to use the bathroom scale around the 
same time every day wearing similar clothing (and no 
shoes). After they used the bathroom scale they started their 
activity monitoring of that day. They did this by pressing the 
‘Start’ button in the activity submenu of the application on 
the mobile phone and by wearing the mobile phone with 
them in their pocket. Participants were encouraged to end 
activity monitoring around the same time every day. Since 
elderly women do not always wear clothing with pockets, a 
belt was provided to them to which they could attach the 
mobile phone. They could wear this belt around their waist. 
C. Measurements 
After daily monitoring their balance, weight, and activity 
for three weeks the participants received a modified version 
of the Post Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) 
[18]. Some items were removed from the PSSUQ because 
they were not applicable and some questions which focused 
on the usability of the separate devices were added. As a 
result, the items from the PSSUQ could be divided in three 
subscales: usability of the bathroom scale (5 items), usability 
of the mobile phone (10 items), and usability of the 
monitoring system as a whole (10 items). The participants 
rated each item on a scale from 1 to 7 (whether they totally 
disagreed, disagreed, disagreed a little, were neutral, agreed a 
little, agreed, or totally agreed). Besides that, free space was 
available after each question so that the participant could 
provide an explanation or clarification. Examples of the 
items were: ‘I liked using the bathroom scale daily to 
measure my weight and balance’, ‘I needed a lot of help with 
297

using the mobile phone’, ‘I liked using the monitoring 
system’, and ‘Overall I am satisfied with the monitoring 
system’.  
The participants also received an agenda at the beginning 
of the pilot study that they could use as a logbook. They 
were instructed to write down any difficulties they had with 
the devices on the day that it occurred. If the participants 
experienced any problems or had questions regarding the 
devices with the monitoring system, they could call the 
researcher for help. The researcher recorded the problems 
that occurred in a logbook as well.  
Finally, adherence to the daily monitoring regimen was 
automatically registered by the mobile phone. 
D. Analyses 
The scores on the adapted version of the PSSUQ were 
analyzed quantitatively. Mean scores were calculated for the 
total PSSUQ and the three subscales of the PSSUQ per 
participant. Higher scores indicate better usability.  
The data that participants provided in the free text space 
of the PSSUQ, the data that was recorded in the logbooks of 
the participants, and notes in the logbook of the researcher 
were analyzed qualitatively. All remarks, comments, and 
reported errors were structured per device and per function 
of the monitoring system. 
Adherence rate to the daily monitoring regimen was 
calculated by counting the number of days that data on the 
three physical indicators (weight, balance, and activity) 
were saved on the mobile phone. This number was divided 
by the number of days that a participant was included. 
III. 
RESULTS 
The results section provides an overview of the 
characteristics of the users and how they rated the usability 
of the monitoring system. Furthermore, data regarding the 
adherence to the daily monitoring regimen is presented.  
A. Characteristics of study participants 
Six participants, two men and four women aged between 
79 and 83 years, agreed to participate and provided written 
informed consent. All participants owned a mobile phone 
but they rarely used it. None of the participants had used a 
smartphone before. Of these six participants, four completed 
the pilot study. One female participant (participant 6) 
dropped out after two days because she was suddenly 
admitted to the hospital and therefore her data will be 
disregarded in this paper. Another female participant 
(participant 4) decided to stop participation after using the 
monitoring system for 6 days. She indicated that the main 
reason for her drop-out was that she did not feel supported 
by her husband in using the monitoring system. Despite her 
early drop-out, the participant filled out the adjusted version 
of the PSSUQ after 6 days of participation. 
B. Usability scores of PSSUQ 
The usability scores that the participants provided on the 
adapted version of the PSSUQ are presented in Figure 2.  
Figure 2. Mean usability scores after 3 weeks 
 
The mean score on the adapted version of the PSSUQ was 
5.2 (SD .90) and scores of participants varied between 6.2 
and 3.8. The mean scores of the subscales for the bathroom 
scale, mobile phone and system as a whole were 6.2 (SD 
.64), 5.0 (SD .84), and 4.8 (SD 1.0) respectively on a scale 
from 1 to 7. The participant who dropped-out of the study 
after 6 days (participant 4) gave the lowest usability scores 
on all subscales. 
C. Problems recorded in logbooks and PSSUQ 
Analysis of the logbooks and comments on the PSSUQ 
revealed that some problems occurred with the data 
transmission of the bathroom scale. Participant 1, 2 and 3 all 
recorded in their logbook that the bathroom scale did not 
transfer the data to the mobile phone on one occasion. This 
made it difficult for the participants to continue with their 
activity measurement of that day. Besides that, the 
application on the mobile phone accidentally shut down on 
three occasions. Due to this error, which was reported twice 
by participant 1 and once by participant 5, participants had to 
restart the application before they could continue monitoring 
their weight, balance, and physical activity. Furthermore, 
participant 2 had difficulty with starting the daily activity 
measurement at the start of the pilot study. During an extra 
home visit it appeared that the participant kept pressing the 
stop button directly after pressing the start button.  
D. Adherence to the daily monitoring regimen 
Frequency calculations revealed that participant 1 did not 
monitor any of the physical indicators on 5 of the 21 days. 
Combining the logbook with the adherence data revealed 
that on all 5 occasions, the participant skipped the 
measurements because the visited family members on those 
days. Participants 2 and 3 monitored their weight, balance, 
and activity every day during the pilot study. No adherence 
rate was calculated for participant 4 because she dropped-out 
of the study. Participant 5 had the lowest adherence to the 
monitoring regimen since data of all three indicators were 
missing on 11 of the 21 days. Thus, the adherence rates of 
participant 1, 2, 3, and 5 were 76%, 100%, 100%, and 48% 
respectively. The adherence data from the four participants

who completed the pilot study resulted in an overall 
adherence rate of 81% to the daily monitoring regimen. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
All participants who completed the study gave usability 
scores of 4 or higher on the different subscales of the 
adapted version of the PSSUQ and the participant who 
dropped-out rated the overall usability of the system with 
3.8. This positive evaluation of usability is important since 
this is a prerequisite for the uptake of new technology in 
daily practice [15,16]. However, another important 
requirement that should be met is that the monitoring 
system should operate without interruptions [19]. Analyses 
of the logbooks that were kept by the participants and the 
researcher revealed that a few errors occurred during the 
pilot study and therefore some improvements are still 
needed in the monitoring system and the application.  
The adherence of the participants to the monitoring 
regimen seemed to be satisfactory since three of the four 
participants used the bathroom scale and mobile phone at 
least 75% of the days to monitor weight, balance, and 
physical activity. Only participant 5 had low adherence, but 
this was mainly caused by the fact that the participant could 
not restart the application by herself after it had shut down 
automatically. So, her low adherence rate was a result of an 
error in the application that caused a usability problem. 
A. Strengths and limitations 
A recent review by van den Berg et al. regarding 
telemedicine and telecare for older patients revealed that the 
majority of studies in this field are carried out in ‘younger 
older patients’ who do not always represent the target group 
of the innovation [20]. A strength of this study is that the in- 
and exclusion criteria were formulated in such a way that the 
group of ‘younger older patients’ was not included. Another 
advantage is that the usability of the monitoring system was 
tested in the daily lives of elderly people instead of in a 
controlled lab-situation because this provides more accurate 
and detailed information regarding the usability problems 
that occur [21].   
A limitation of this study is that only few patients 
participated which makes it difficult to draw a firm 
conclusion regarding usability based on the data that is 
available. Furthermore, the relation between the home 
measurements that were performed by the participants and 
medical outcomes was not studied. Therefore, no conclusion 
can be drawn yet regarding the usefulness of tracking health 
evolution of elderly patients and the possibility of detecting 
clinically relevant health changes with the monitoring 
system. During the pilot study some changes in weight, 
balance and activity were detected, but it is difficult to say 
whether these were clinically relevant or not. Besides that, 
small variations in weight might also have been caused by 
calibration issues that are often present in bathroom scales. 
But it is unlikely that these variations will lead to serious 
misinterpretation of weight recordings since participant use 
the bathroom scale every day which will average these 
variations. 
Another limitation of this pilot study is that an adapted 
version of the PSSUQ was used to rate the usability of the 
monitoring system instead of the original version. This 
makes it difficult to compare the usability scores of this 
study to usability scores of other studies that used the 
original version of the PSSUQ. A positive aspect of the 
adapted version of the PSSUQ is that participants could 
provide comments to explain or complement their scores on 
each item. In combination with the logging files, this 
provided additional insight into what caused usability 
problems. 
B. Conclusion and future work 
The participants were mostly positive about the usability 
of the monitoring system but some improvements have to be 
made to the monitoring system and feedback application. 
The monitoring system and interface are currently being 
improved based on the results of the pilot study. Since the 
pilot study only had a few participants and a relatively short 
follow-up period, another study will be conducted during 
which 50 elderly people will use the improved system 
(including the grip ball) every day for 6 months. The follow-
up study will not only focus on the usability of the improved 
monitoring and feedback system but also on the 
acceptability and added value as experienced by elderly 
people. Besides that, the usability, acceptability and added 
value of the system and database as experienced by health 
care professionals will be studied. We expect that the 
follow-up study will also provide more insight into the 
possibility of detecting clinically relevant changes with the 
devices of the monitoring system.
