Abstract — Internet of Things (IoT) is present in several
environments, from houses to large health care institutions.
Data flows from small sensors and actuators to large data
centers and cloud computer services. Small sensors and
actuators need to guarantee data confidentiality, availability
and integrity, even with limited resources. This paper presents
a systematic mapping outlining problems and solutions studied
in the last three years about middleware and sensors network
security. The process used to select, filter and analyze articles
is described and the results indicate efforts to certify integrity,
availability and, especially, confidentiality.

I. INTRODUCTION
The term Internet of Things (IoT) was first proposed in
1999, in an article of the RFID Journal, when a supply chain
was
interconnected
with
an
enterprise
using
Radio
Frequency Identification (RFID) [1]. According to Khan, an
IoT
environment
has
to
promote
connectivity
with
everything
and
everyone
[2],
through
a
group
of
interconnected
sensors,
providing
a
set
of
relevant
information for a computer decision support system.
According to Business Insider, almost $6 trillion must be
invested in solutions using IoT in the next five years [24].
IoT is one emergent technology in Gartner’s IT Hype Cycle
[3], as seen in Fig. 1.
In
the
last
years,
concepts
about
IoT
have
been
implemented in many sectors, such as health care, public
services,
transport
and
so
forth.
This
paradigm
of
interconnected things increases the challenge to develop and
maintain an infrastructure to assist this demand without
security problems.
Figure 1. Gartner’s IT Hype Cycle [3]
An architecture proposed by Tan and Wang (2010) and
Wu et al. split the components used in IoT environments in
5
layers:
perception
(device),
transport,
processing
(middleware), application and business [4]. This work will
focus on the perception, transport and processing layers of
this model.
Every computing system may have security problems and
the same can be said about IoT. A secure computing system
has to guarantee the following pre-requisites:
• Availability: related to the computing system’s
level of availability.
• Integrity: related to the guarantee that information
was not modified in its source or on its path.
• Confidentiality: related to the assurance that only
an authorized person can access the data.

In IoT, the perception layer is mainly composed of
sensors, which are small, autonomous, with low processing
and low power consumption [5]. These features, combined
with its wide dispersion, make it even more complex to
guarantee privacy and security to the information collected
without the considerable increase in power consumption and
processing in these wireless sensor networks [6].
This work intends to do a systematic mapping of
problems and solutions in security communication within
sensor networks and middleware used in IoT environments
between devices in the perception and processing layers.
According to Petersen (2008), systematic mapping involves
a search in literature to verify the nature, extension and
quantity of published articles [7]. IoT was the object of
multiple studies over the last years and this work has the
purpose of identifying and categorizing problems and
solutions
related
to
sensor
networks
and
middleware
security in IoT, resulting in a reference to related studies.
This work is organized in five sections: Section 2
presents the theoretical principles of IoT, its concepts and
components. After that, Section 3 explains the process used
in systematic mapping detailing the process of search. It
also specifies the academic databases included in the
research and the criteria for their inclusion and exclusion.
Moreover, Section 4 analyzes and classifies the data
collected and, finally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of
this work.
II. THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES
A. Internet of Things (IoT)
IoT is a model that uses several objects (or things) to
establish a pervasive presence around us [9]. These objects
are present in houses, offices, industries, etc., providing
information about the context where they work [10].
Applications use the Internet to consume such information
and to serve reasoning and semantic data, intelligent and
responsive services, big data analysis, and so on. Thus, a
network of objects, services and people is ordered. Atzori et
al. show the interaction of these elements, as shown in Fig.
2 [9].
The top circle in Fig. 2 lists some of the objects used in
an IoT environment. Almost all of these objects are small
electronic sensors and actuators capable of interacting with
the
real
environment.
Nonetheless,
there
are
many
technologies to develop and to implant these objects. The
technologies shown in Fig. 2 are only a short enumeration.
Usually, sensors and actuators have a small amount of
resources to process or store data (even none). Some of
these sensors are integrated with smartphones and other
small computing platforms (like Arduino and Raspberry PI).
Finally, all these objects need a way to connect to the
Internet moving from the top circle to the left circle.
Sometimes,
middlewares
are
necessary
to
assure
the
compatibility
of
elements.
Sensors,
actuators
and
communication devices cover mold, what is called “things”
oriented vision [9]. The initial efforts to implant IoT
platforms over the years were concentrated in the top circle
elements and there are plenty of technologies in the market
about this.
Figure 2. “Internet of Things” paradigm as result of the convergence of
different visions [9].
Nowadays, another concept is being studied. Quantum
Lifecycle Management (QLM) messaging is a standard
based on IoT that defines changes in a life cycle of
information between different IoT products [11].
The left circle in Fig. 2 presents some technologies used
to provide applications that interact with objects, such as
those presented in the top circle. The “Internet”-oriented
vision is the connection between humans and objects in the
IoT concept. Humans, using a computer or a smart device,
can receive a data summary from sensors and send
commands to the actuators.
There is another modern approach to understand this part
of the concept. For example, Guo et al. present the
opportunistic IoT to provide networks compatible with the
movement and opportunistic contact of the human nature.
Then, a person who interacts with an environment of objects
(sensors and actuators) will find other people to provide the
network to share and feed the applications used in the left
circle [11]. Thus, smart mobile devices connected in ad-hoc
networks are the center of this concept to reflect the human-
human interaction against the human-computer interaction
reflected in network layout. Therewith, the IoT environment
will reproduce the human behavior more than objects
behavior,
changing
and
improving
the
context
of
information.
Moving to the right circle, the applications designed to
interact with humans have to interact with other applications
to extend their capability. The elements called Web of
Things (WoT) must implement new interfaces to computers
over the network or Internet. Again, new middleware is
necessary to exchange data between these elements. Some

technologies, such as Simple Object Access Protocol
(SOAP) or Representational State Transfer (REST), are
examples in this case. REST is a lightweight integration
technology introduced in 2000 by Roy Fielding. Rettig et al.
present a research work in which REST is applied in this
context [13].
Finally, in the right circle, the analysis of the data
collected and processed in the left circle will provide some
new real time information. At this stage, the analysis will
focus on providing knowledge more than information. The
objective is not to understand the responses of sensors, but
to interpret this information comparing it with another
environment with the same context or even to compare it
with other contexts to create new knowledge about this.
According to Atzori et al., to represent, store, interconnect,
search and organize the magnitude of information generated
by so many devices will be a great challenge [9].
B. Middlewares
Rocha et al. affirm that distributed systems generate new
problems because they are not centralized. Among the
questions regarding distributed systems is: how to make it
easy the development of distributed systems and the
integration with legacy systems? One of the responses to
this question is middlewares [14].
Maciel et al. (2004) define middleware as a software layer
that
permits
communication
between
distributed
applications. In other words, middlewares are responsible
for interoperating between systems, providing a layer to
allow transparent communication, minimizing complexity
and providing a homogeneous environment for the few or
several systems that might be involved [15].
Figure 3. Communication between middleware [15].
Fig. 3 shows a usage example of a middleware. The
middleware layer is inside the structure and it is responsible
for providing communication between existent systems. The
process is transparent to the applications (processes 1 and 2)
and the middleware handles the communication in a
heterogeneous environment.
According to Cavalcanti et al., the main middleware
features are [16]:
• Hiding the information distributed.
• Hiding the hardware components heterogeneity
from
several
operating
systems
and
communication protocols.
• Providing
high-level
uniform
interfaces
to
applications and developers.
• Supplying a set of common services to execute
some
general
functions,
avoiding
effort
duplication
and
facilitating
collaboration
between applications.
Middleware is gaining market over the past years in order
to integrate legacy systems with new systems and also to
simplify the integration by developing new services to both
systems.
Nowadays, middleware is used in several scenarios,
including IoT, from e-health to
smart houses
where
middleware is responsible for providing communication
between some sensors and interoperating them with other
systems.
C. Sensors Networks
When the Internet was proposed, the objective was to
create
a
long
distance
decentralized
communication
network. The client/server paradigm suggests an application
with one human interacting directly, with a client side and
one computer at the server side.
Despite this, sensor networks designed for an IoT
environment involve communication between a sensor and a
transport device without a human being in the circuit. These
components are installed at a short distance in the same
environment for almost all cases. Finally, sensors, actuators
and transport devices have reduced capacity to store and
process data and it is difficult to connect the sensor network
to the Internet because the data from the sensors cannot be
transmitted in long distance with the limitation of these
transmission protocols. With low power of processing data,
even none, sensors are not able to execute complex
algorithms to cypher information [17].
In this scenario, to ensure security features, especially
confidentiality, can be a great challenge. Many different
studies try to solve this problem with diverse approaches:
“small
sized
keys,
reduce
communication
exchanges,
operate under the assumption of insecure communication
channels, etc.” [18], but the discussion along this work
shows the challenge is only in its beginning. To face various
different scenarios, with singular needs and features, using
distinct technologies and implementing particular sets of
protocols is necessary to stablish more solutions with
different cost/benefit relations. This justifies the relevance
of the systematic mapping conducted to understand the most
recent studies about this topic.

III. SYSTEMATIC MAPPING
The systematic mapping adopted in this work is
based on the process proposed by Petersen et al. (2008)
that describes five steps [7]:
1.
Research questions definitions;
2.
Primarily relevant studies research;
3.
Classification (first filter);
4.
Summary keyword (second filter);
5.
Data extraction and mapping.
Usually, questions in a systematic mapping must be
general, of an exploratory nature, while systematic revisions
may use more specific questions [8]. This way, this work
focuses on the following questions:
•
(Q1). Which are the main problems related
to
communication
security
in
sensors
network and middleware used in IoT?
•
(Q2).
Which
are
the
solutions
to
communication security in sensors network
and middleware used in IoT?
The academic databases chosen to be part of this research
were ACM Digital Library, Elsevier (Science Direct) and
IEEE Xplore. The elected research keywords were: IoT,
security and sensors networks. To classify the articles, the
following criteria for inclusion were established:
•
Articles from 2014 or newer;
•
For articles about the same research subject,
only the most recent were selected;
Exclusion criteria were:
•
Any article about other subjects, not analyzed
in this paper;
•
Secondary
studies
such
as
summary,
presentations and so forth;
The first search returned a total of 649 papers. The
first filter (reading the titles and abstracts in order to
apply inclusion and exclusion criteria) reduced the
number of articles to 94. The second filter (reading the
introductions) reduced the number to 60 after we applied
applied again the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
result is presented in Table I.

To answer the first question (Q1) the articles were
arranged
in
groups:
Confidentiality,
Availability,
Integrity and ALL, presented in Section 1 of this paper.
To resolve the second question (Q2), the articles were
classified according to the presented solution:
•
Cryptography
–
key
generator:
key
generation solutions;
•
Cryptography – key management: key
management and distribution solutions;
•
Anonymity: guarantees privacy solutions;
•
Internal prevention of attacks: prevents
attacks
from
devices
inside

network;
•
Architecture:

architecture
to
implant security;
•
Physical
attack:
physical
attacks
to
devices, for instance to steal or to break;
•
Authentication: guarantees both, identity
and source of information;
IV. ANALYSIS
This section presents details about the study and
the collected information during the classifying process.
Fig. 4 shows the relation between academic databases
and the articles classified. The analysis draws 24 (39,7%)
articles from ACM, 24 (39,7%) from IEEE Xplore and 12
(20,7%) from Elsevier.
Figure 4. Counts of Base
In
all
the
articles
included,
60%
enumerate
confidentiality as the main problem to be solved by
security middlewares in sensor networks in an IoT
environment. As proposed by Baker (2009 apud Ntul et
al. 2016) [19], capturing data or doing a physical attack in
a sensor network means that “the attacker can clone the
device,
install
new
firmware
or
learn
sensitive
information”. The hacked device might be used in other
complex and destructive attacks. Belsis and Pantziou
[20], Gope and Hwang [21], and others show the risk of
intercepting and infering data about patients and location
in a medical monitoring environment in a likely IoT
approach. Something between sensors and gateways must
assure the privacy of people and accuracy of the health
information. It can be applied to other environments.
Caron et al. [22] discuss the privacy to the Australian
citizen and the legal guarantees to protect personal
information. The center of the discussion features how

secrecy, anonymity and solitude can be applied to almost
every country in the modern world. Nonetheless, low cost
devices have limited processing power and have to use
simple cryptographic and sign functions [23]. Fig. 5
shows the percentage of distribution of security problems
of this study.
Figure 5. Percentage of security problems
Figure 6. Percentage of security solutions
Among the identified problems, a few proposed
solutions
were
identified.
Those
were
arranged
in
categories. Fig. 6 represents the distribution of categories
for solutions and percentage from the selected articles.
Figure 7. Mapping
The main concerns found about the solutions were:
Cryptography - Key Management (17.5%), Cryptography
- Key Generator (24.6%) and Architecture (28.1%).
These represent 70,2% of all solutions found. Solutions
based in Architecture represent 28.1%, but solutions
based in Cryptography are more recurring representing
45,6%,
almost
half
of
all
solutions.
About
the
Architecture category, many solutions were proposed,
such as network architecture to middleware model,
including specific security issues with focus in data
confidentiality and integrity. The N/A category groups
articles without proposed solutions. Fig. 7 shows the
articles
distribution
comparing
the
two
questions:
problems (Q1) and proposed solutions (Q2).
V. CONCLUSION
The set of technologies that defines an IoT
environment is rapidly evolving. The concerns with
security are reflected in the articles discussed in this
paper and others that did not meet the outlined criteria.
The same way, different approaches suggest solutions to
different scenarios.
The aim of this work was to map security problems
and respective solutions to sensors networks in IoT
environments. Four categories of problems and nine
solution categories were defined, presenting uneasiness
with the lack of confidentiality and suggestion, especially
in cryptography.
The superficial analysis in this paper suggests a
deeper study to compare effectiveness and application of
presented solutions is necessary. It is important to work
and understand what makes confidentiality the most
exposed problem and explore best applicable approaches.
A survey is a great suggestion to continue the research in
future papers.
