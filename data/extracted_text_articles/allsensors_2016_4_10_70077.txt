Abstract—To resolve the high power consumption and complex
polymerization
process
of
most
CO2
sensors,
a
room
temperature operation CO2 sensor based on Emeraldine base –
polyaniline
(EB-PANI)
blended
with
poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)
was developed. In this work, the sensor performed linear
response to CO2 in working range of 1000-20000 ppm with the
response from 0.98% to 3.83%. This detection range is low
enough for environmental detection. On the other hand,
compared to the response to CO2, this sensor has considerably
lower response to humidity, from 50 % to 85 % RH. Hence, in
the ambient environment, this CO2 sensor is not affected by
humidity when detecting the CO2 concentration.

INTRODUCTION
CO2 is a common gas in our life and plays an important
role for agriculture [1], indoor air quality [2], food storage
[3], etc. For indoor air quality, the safe CO2 concentration
rage is between 1500 ppm and 5000 ppm. A higher
concentration would lead to people feeling sleepy, having
headaches, inattention [2] and so on.
Furthermore, it has
been proven that, by integrating a CO2 sensor into the
ventilation system, the ventilating strength level can be
adjusted depending on the CO2 concentration. This makes
the ventilation system more efficient and can reduce about
10%~30% of energy consumption and ventilation loads [4].
On the other hand, in health care, a CO2 sensor can be used
to monitor patients respiratory capacity, and, hence, lung
condition. The general standard is from 4% to 6%, or the
patient might be under the risk of metabolic acidosis or
respiratory failure.
Based on these important applications, many researchers
developed various new sensing materials for CO2 sensing,
such as copper oxide and spinel ferrite nanocomposite [5],
LaFeO3 [6] and other metal oxide of nanocomposite [7].
However, metal oxide based sensors need to operate at high
temperature, which are from 150°C to 300°C, and this
requires a large energy consumption. Therefore, other
research works focus on polymer-based materials to avoid
this problem, such as PEDOT [8], RGO [9], and PANI [10].
However, the chemical inertness of carbon dioxide has
caused many difficulties in developing polymer base CO2
chemical sensors [11]. For example, RGO sensor needs high
voltage plasma treatment to recover the sensing feature after
measurement [9]; SPAN sensor’s detection limit is too high
(20000ppm) and the polymerization process is complicated
[12][13]; PEDOT and PANI sensors need to detect CO2 with
high humidity to improve the sensitivity [8][10]. Therefore,
for environmental CO2 detection, these problems still need to
improve.
In this work, Emeraldine base–polyaniline (EB-PANI)
blended with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene
sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was used to be a sensing film. In
Oleg P Dimitriev ed. Al. study [14], the authors claimed that
the
blending
of
PEDOT:PSS
can
improve
PANI’s
conductivity because of PSS’s co-doping in PEDOT and EB-
PANI. According to previous research, it was expected that
the blending of PEDOT:PSS can also increase the water
absorption ability compared to pure EB-PANI and then
increase bicarbonate formation [15]. Furthermore, it was also
expected that the PSS co-doping will cause the sulfonic acid
polyaniline
(SPAN).
Based
on
the
assumption,
EB-
PANI/PEDOT:PSS would be an appropriate sensing material
for indoor CO2 monitoring.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In
Section II, the fabrication process and measurement steps are
described. In Section III, the sensing result and the humidity
effect are discussed. We conclude in Section IV.
II.
EXPERIMENT AND MEASUREMENT
This experiment is composed of two parts, one is the
fabrication process of sensing film and substrate; the other is
measurement system set-up and method.
A. Sensor fabrication
A p-type wafer with 300 nm oxide on the top of surface
was used as the device substrate. The substrate was cleaned

by acetone and isopropyl alcohol. After that, the substrate
was dry out by heating and N2 gas to remove humidity. This
was followed by photolithography. The electrode was
defined with W/L in the ratio of 800 um/40 um. Then, the
sensing electrodes, i.e., 20 nm/200 nm of Cr/Au electrodes,
were achieved by e-gun evaporation and lift-off process.
First,
EB-PANI
powder
was
dissolved
in
N-
methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) to prepare a stock solution with
concentration of 1 wt.%. Then, 1 w.t.% of PEDOT:PSS
aqueous solution was added slowly into 1 w.t.% of EB-PANI
solution in 1:1 proportion (v/v). After adding materials into
solutions, the blended solution was mixing well by stirring.
Finally, the sensing film was fabricating by drop-casting, and
baking in dynamic vacuum for 24hr in 60°C. Figure 1 shows
the
structure
of
EB-PANI
and
PEDOT:PSS.
In
our
assumption, this mixing will make the EB-PANI reform to
Sulfonic Acid polyaniline (SPAN), which will change the
working range for environmental monitoring [12].

B. Measurement system
To measure the response of the developed sensing
material, the LCR meter, Agilent E4980A, provides DC 1V
to measure the resistance of the sensing film. Figure 2 shows
the measurement system. The gas sensing experiment was
operated in the chamber. Before gas sensing, the chamber
was vacuumed by a mechanical pump for 5 minutes to
remove the ambient gas; the vacuum level was below 0.2
torr. After that, the dry air (79% N2 and 21% O2) was flown
into the chamber for 3 minutes, then, the vacuum process
was repeated. After removing dry air by vacuuming for 5
minutes, CO2 with dry air was then flown into the chamber
and, next, we waited for 5 minutes.
In order to simulate the real life environment, CO2
detection
was
measured
in
various
relative
humidity
conditions. Therefore, Deionized water (DI water) was ink-
jeted and flown in with dry air and CO2. The water fully
vaporizes. The relative humidity concentration was detected
from a commercial humidity meter. All the measurements
were carried out at room temperature.
Figure 2. The schematic diagram for gas sensor measurement
The CO2 concentration in chamber was controlled by
Micro Fluid controller (MFC). 500 ppm CO2 (background is
dry air) is a reference gas, then CO2 and dry air flow rate
were controlled to adjust the CO2 concentration. Each
concentration of CO2 with different humidity was staying in
chamber for 3 minutes then removed by vacuum. During
measurement, the pressure in the chamber was controlled to
be the same as the ambient pressure. Finally, the measured
data was recorded by a LabView program.
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the following, CO2 sensitivity and humidity effects are
discussed separately.
A. Gas sensing properties
In the case of CO2 sensing mechanism, Tsuyoshi
Tonosaki ed al. [16] claimed that the hydrolysis of CO2 will
generate bicarbonate ions, and be incorporated to EB-PANI,
which will then become emeraldine salt-PANI (ES-PANI).
The
ES-
PANI
is
more
conductive
than
EB-PANI.
Therefore,
the
higher
CO2
concentration,
the
more
bicarbonate ions will be generated and cause the EB-PANI
transforming into ES type, resulting in the decreasing of the
sensing material resistance.
Based on the theory, the response is defined as the
following equation:
response (%) = R଴ − Rେ୓ଶ
R଴
× 100%
where R0 represents the resistance of sensor in the reference
gas. Since the resistance decreased with the rising of CO2
concentration, the sensitivity can be defined. For a normal
indoor ambient environment, the CO2 concentration is
around 500 ppm and humidity is between 65% RH and 75%
RH. Therefore, in our measurement, we kept the humidity
in this range and 500 ppm CO2 was assumed as the
reference gas.

sensor decreases when a higher concentration of CO2 with
flow in (with vaporized water). As the CO2 concentration

increases, the resistance decrease, so we can clearly
distinguish different concentration of CO2. The details of the
resistance variation are shown in Table 1. In this table, the
response time can be observed, which is around 40 seconds
and the recovery time is around 250 seconds. Figure 4 is the
sensor response to different CO2 concentrations, which are
from 1000 ppm to 50000 ppm. The result shows that the
maximum response is at 20000 ppm with response of
3.83%. The linear working range is between 1000 and
20000 ppm. As CO2 concentration is higher than 20000
ppm, the response will saturate. For environment CO2
detection, this working range is appropriate for indoor
environmental monitoring.
Figure 3. CO2 response curve of EB-PANI/PEDOT:PSS sensor in humid
environment, the humidity was controlled at 70±5% RH. The step of single
concentration response measurement is: 1) flow the 500 ppm CO2 in RH
70%, 2) vacuum the chamber 3) flow the 20000 ppm CO2 in RH 70%, too.

B. Humidity effect
For past CO2 polymer base sensors, most of them
significantly depend on the humidity value and need to
detect CO2 with high humidity concentration. However,
compared to CO2 sensitivity, these sensing films showed
much higher sensitivity to humidity. To resolve this problem,
the hydrophilic material, PEDOT:PSS, was blended into EB-
PANI. With this method, it can improve the formation of
bicarbonate to enhance CO2 detection, but improve the
selectivity to humidity. Due to the opposing conductivity
variation trend of PEDOT:PSS and PANI, in summation the
response to humidity was assumed to offset each other then
become stable.
Therefore, the humidity effect is shown in Figure 5. The
sensor responses to humidity from 50% RH to 85% RH are
much smaller compared to CO2 response, and there is also no
obviously trend of humidity effect. Hence, in ambient
environment, this CO2 sensor can ignore the humidity effect
to detect CO2 concentration. Differences in the original
resistance of every sensor would due to process variations,
such as blending quality, and the relation of standard
variation and resistance still need to be studied.  
IV.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, a room temperature operated CO2 sensor
has been developed with a simple fabrication process. The
detection range is from 1000 ppm to 20000 ppm with highly
response from 0.98% to 3.83%. It is appropriate for
environmental CO2 detection. Furthermore, the humidity
effect is also discussed. Compared to CO2 sensitivity, this
sensor has extremely low response for humidity. Hence, the
blending of PEDOT:PSS into EB-PANI is successfully
resolving the problem of humidity effect for most polymer
based materials. This CO2 sensor is highly potential for
indoor environmental detection.
