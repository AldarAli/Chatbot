Abstract— IRSEEM is coordinator of a research program 
Savemore [19] aiming to develop and demonstrate the viability 
and effectiveness of systems for electrical transport and urban 
logistics based on autonomous robotic electric vehicles operating 
within a smart grid electrical power distribution framework. As a 
part of this project, our work focuses on the study of the coupling 
of electric vehicles with renewable energy. At the scale of a city, 
electric vehicles can be considered as a means of intermittent 
storage of electric power which can be distributed to the network 
when it is required (e.g., at times of the date when demand 
spikes). When these vehicles belong to a controlled and intelligent 
fleet, network organization is dynamic and leads to a smart grid. 
The widespread use of electric vehicles in cities coupled with 
renewable energy appears as a powerful tool to help local and 
regional authorities in the implementation of the European 
Agenda for low-carbon, reduced air pollution and encourage 
energy savings. In this paper, we present a Vehicle to Grid model 
which implements the interaction between an electric vehicle and 
a smart grid. The model takes into account several kinds of 
parameters related to the battery, the charging station, the size of 
the fleet and the power grid as the expansion coefficient. A 
statistical approach is adopted for the setting of these parameters 
to determine the significant parameters. Several simulations are 
performed to validate the model. In first step, we have studied 
the behavior of the model on a typical day of a person who has 
traveled from his home to work (in France). As a second step, 
and in order to study the power consumption behavior of the 
model, we have tested it during several seasons. The results show 
the effectiveness of the model developed.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
In a context of the economics and development of 
renewable energy, the “Grenelle Environment” enables 
research 
and 
development 
of 
electric 
vehicles 
and 
infrastructure. The Electric Vehicle (EV) market although 
launched many years earlier does not have great success so far, 
mainly due to lack of sufficient infrastructure to reassure 
consumers about autonomy. The development of new batteries 
has given a new boost to the field of electric mobility. 
However, a problem has been identified: while for example, 
the French State has planned to put into circulation a number of 
electric vehicles in the year 2020, recharging all these batteries 
is a real problem since it will create additional demand in 
periods already known for very high energy demand. However, 
recent proposals for the creation of Smart Grids of Electricity 
Distribution are suggest the peak demand can be managed 
effectively by introducing intelligent management of power 
consumption and storage. Until now, we have always used 
electric vehicle batteries in unidirectional mode. That is to say 
that the use of the battery can be summarized in a load area and 
a discharge operation of the vehicle. The innovative idea in 
smart grids is to use the batteries in bidirectional mode this 
time, and to inject electricity back to the grid when needed. 
However, a question arises: will this bidirectional battery usage 
counter peak daily consumption? 
 
At present, the countries of the world are confronted with 
serious issues and problems related to energy; whether for its 
production, operation, management or even transportation. It 
should be noted that the energy produced in the world comes, 
about 80% of fossil fuels [16][17]. The consumption of fossil 
fuels today poses a major environmental problem. Indeed, the 
production of energy from fossil fuels causes the release of 
greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, which results in global 
warming. 
 
Today, and for the sake of sustainable development, some 
sectors such as the automotive and logistics industries have to 
address the problems and offer alternatives to the use of 
combustion engines (which consume major part of fossil fuels). 
One such alternative is the expansion of the use of electric 
motors. The introduction of electric vehicles fleets by 2020 is 
of increasing importance. This will lead to a significant change 
in the behavior of the electricity distribution grids. To

anticipate this future behavior, the network must evolve to 
become "smart". 
 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 1 introduces the 
motivation of the paper. Section 2 presents the state of the art 
on Vehicle to Grid (V2G) projects. Section 3 presents the V2G 
model we developed. Section 4 illustrates the impact of the 
V2G model parameters in the interaction between the EV and 
smart grid. An adjustment of the model parameters is presented 
in this section. Results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 
concludes this paper. 
II. V2G STATE OF THE ART  
There are different ways to integrate a vehicle in the 
network: V0G: direct load on standard household outlet, V1G: 
the vehicle communicates in real time with the network and 
the network load when needed (outside peak), V2G: as V1G 
but bidirectionally, discharge to the networks when it is 
needed, V2H: as V2G but only with a specific building or 
building complex, and V2G NGU: a V2G project related to 
renewable energy production. 
The University of Delaware has launched the V2G project 
in 2004. This project is led by Dr. Willett Kempton [1][5][6]. 
Electric-drive vehicles, whether powered by batteries, fuel 
cells, or gasoline hybrids, have energy and power electronics 
capable of producing the 60 Hz AC electricity that powers 
homes and offices. They call it V2G. As an example of power 
production, the project has experimented for one vehicle that it 
can put out over 10kW, which is the energy consumption of 
10 houses [2][3]. 
 
The company AC Propulsion Inc. has developed the 
concept of Vehicle to Grid by designing the eBox car [7], with 
a V2G system for the transfer of electricity in both directions 
between the battery and the electric grid. This car is derived 
from the Toyota Scion Xb equipped with an electric motor and 
a V2G interface for the transfer of electricity.  
 
Danish Edison project stands for "Electric vehicles in a 
Distributed and Integrated market using Sustainable energy and 
Open Networks" [8]. The Danish electricity production 
environment is conducive to the development of this project as 
20% of its energy is wind. This represents a large share of 
intermittent and difficult to control energy. They use them for 
the eBox project developed by AC Propulsion Inc. 
As part of a project on a larger scale in the city of Toyota, 
the manufacturer available to Toyota Prius Plug conducted 10 
tests at houses. They were equipped with a V2H (Vehicle to 
Home) interface for storing in the car battery intermittent 
production from photovoltaic panels. The injection of energy to 
the battery or to the network is managed by a specific charging 
station equipped with an inverter to convert the current system 
and Home Energy Management System (HEMS) [9]. 
V2G technology developed by the U.S. Company Nuvve is 
based on the possibility of using electric vehicles as energy 
buffer reserves [10]. On the one hand, electric vehicles, used 
on average 5% of the time, representing energy capacity 
"dormant", i.e., not used for 95% of the day [4]. On the other 
hand, energy production is not constant, particularly in cases 
such as Denmark, where the random nature of renewable 
energy needs to be considered. 
Unveiled in August 2011, the Leaf-to-Home is a V2G 
device that reverses the energy flow of the Nissan Leaf to 
allow the vehicle to provide electric power to a private 
network [11]. Indeed, thanks to an integrated model that is 
100% electric, Nissan offers the possibility to transform the 
electric charge stored in the battery into alternating current for 
the energy needs of a home. According to Nissan, this system 
would power a Japanese home for 48 hours and a more 
energy-consuming house, such as an American home, for a 
day. This is useful when system power fails (for the basic 
operation of lights, freezer, etc.), or to reduce demand on the 
national system during peak times.  
The German E-Energy program aims to enable intelligent 
integration of electro-mobility in a global energy supply 
system. Electricity consumption is guided by the production 
and the vehicle battery is charged only before its next use, no 
matter what time of the day it will be connected to the mains 
for charging [12].  
The GRIDbot Canadian Company is specializing in the 
design and installation of charging infrastructure for 
municipal, commercial and multi-residential electric vehicles. 
It offers a global solution for the EVs’ networking. It is one of 
the largest manufacturers across public, commercial and 
residential sectors in Canada for recharging devices. The 
project aims to make possible bidirectional electricity flows 
for the introduction of V2G in Quebec [13].  
French Police Power Regulation assumptions are based on 
V2G, for a fleet of one million electric vehicles connected (the 
French government will provide a total of 2 million EVs by 
2020). Their storage capacity could reach 10 GWh [14]. This 
storage capacity could be valuable during peak periods. 
In [18], the author proposes a photovoltaic synthetic 
generator.  The system developed show a stochastic model for 
solar energy based on Markov chain approach and uses real 
data to generate the solar states for different times of the day. 
The system can be applied to design the appropriate size of 
energy storage devices or to determine the charging rate of 
photovoltaic powered EV charging station [18].

B. V2G Model Calculation 
In order to give a clear description for the model to be 
used, we consider the following parameters:  
 
Real Energy Injectable from the battery to 
the grid :   𝑅𝐸𝐼𝐵𝐺 
 
Real Battery Capacity:  𝑅𝐵𝐶 
 
Transformation Efficiency:   
𝐷𝐶
𝐴𝐶 ∶ 𝑅 
 
Number of Vehicles:  𝑁 
 
Average Journey carried out: 𝑃 
 
Manufacture Battery Capacity: 𝑀𝐵𝐶 
 
Real Autonomy Estimate: 𝑅𝐴𝐸 
 
Maximum Energy Injectable from the Grid 
to the Battery during Time 𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛: 𝑀𝐸𝐼𝐺𝐵 
 
Charging Station Power: 𝐶𝑆𝑃 
 
Charging Time in Hours: 𝑇 
 
Real Energy Injectable on the Batteries:  
𝑅𝐸𝐼𝐵 
 
The Eq. (6) shows the resulting model. For obtaining 
𝑅𝐸𝐼𝐵𝐺, we have to do the following calculations: 
Firstly, we calculate the energy consumption for 1 km as 
shown in Eq. 1: 
 
     𝐸𝐺1 = 𝑀𝐵𝐶
𝑅𝐴𝐸    
 (1) 
 
Secondly, we calculate the energy consumption per day for 
one EV as shown in Eq. 2: 
 
𝐸𝐶𝐷1 = 𝐸𝐺1 ∗ 𝑃   
 (2) 
 
Thirdly, we calculate the total energy (Eq. 3) expended per 
day: 
 
𝑇𝐸𝐸𝐷 = 𝐸𝐶𝐷1 ∗ 𝑁             
 (3) 
 
Fourthly, we calculate the remaining energy in the batteries 
which corresponds to the real available energy (Eq. 4): 
 
𝑅𝐴𝐸 = 𝑅𝐵𝐶 ∗ 𝑁 − 𝑇𝐸𝐸𝐷               
 (4) 
 
And finally, for obtaining the real energy injectable from the 
battery to the grid, Eq. 5 is presented as follows:  
 
𝑅𝐸𝐼𝐵𝐺 = 𝑅𝐴𝐸 ∗ 𝑅                 
 (5) 
 
And now in using the different parameters, we have (Eq. 6): 
 
𝑅𝐸𝐼𝐵𝐺 = 𝑅 ∗ (𝑅𝐵𝐶 ∗ 𝑁 − (𝑁 ∗ 𝑃 ∗ 𝑀𝐵𝐶
𝑅𝐴𝐸))          
 (6) 
 
The maximum energy injectable from the grid to the 
battery during time 𝑇 is presented in Eq. 7:  
 
𝑀𝐸𝐼𝐺𝐵 = 𝐶𝑆𝑃 ∗ 𝑁 ∗ 𝑇   
 (7) 
 
The Energy which really injectable on the battery is shown 
in Eq. 8: 
 
𝑅𝐸𝐼𝐵 = 𝑅𝐵𝐶 ∗ 𝑁  
 (8)

analysis of the impact of each parameter on the output of the 
system. In order to validate our choice, significant parameters

Significant Parameter-based Design of Experiment 
The setting of parameters based on methodology from the 
Design of Experiments (DOE) filed is used to identify the 
most significant parameters of our V2G model (by significant 
parameters we define those for which changes of values 
directly impacts the model output). The use of DOE has 
reduced the model parameters from 14 to 4 significant 
parameters. This significantly reduces the number of 
experimental simulations required and causes rapid converge 
towards an optimal parameter sets. The significant parameters 
obtained are shown in TABLE V.

V. RESULTS ANALYSIS & DISCUSSION 
 
As a synthesis of the whole set of simulations, we present 
the following conclusions concerning the impact of EVs on the 
power grid: Despite 2 million vehicles added to the classic 
park, the consumption profile has not changed “very 
significantly”. In other words, the general behavior of the smart 
grid is the same but with a higher level of consumption. These 
two million EVs replace probably at least their thermal 
equivalent. This causes more power consumption, which 
requires more energy production. This in turn provides the 
benefit of reducing fossil fuel fleet and thus reduces the carbon 
footprint. 
 
The energy feedback network does not affect the life of 
lithium-ion batteries; this is due to the fact that the discharge 
threshold setting of 25% was observed. Electric vehicles have 
an impact on electricity consumption although this impact 
remains "relatively modest" compared to the large size of the 
fleet of EV (2 million). Except for the private fleet (with 10000 
VE), and during the charging period, we found an increase in 
electricity consumption. However, as the fleet in question is a 
V2G fleet, EVs outside charging periods inject energy into the 
network to reduce consumption during peak hours. The 
average consumption clearly shows a slight increase in the 
daily electricity consumption, which supports our first 
observation above about the non-significant impact of EVs on 
the overall energy consumption. In addition to the V2G, the 
introduction of future wind farms and hydro plants could 
reduce the load on the grid absorbed by the EVs during the 
daily power consumption. This is also aided by the contribution 
of Vehicle to Home (V2H), hence the strong interaction 
between the V2G and V2H. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
We have presented in this paper an extensive experimental 
study on V2G and its impact in the production of renewable 
energy and its interaction with the conventional smart grid. 
This study included an overview of V2G projects. 
Subsequently, we presented our V2G model including several 
significant parameters. This model has been the subject of 
several simulations to demonstrate its feasibility. 
Subsequently, a synthesis has been prepared to present the 
impact of EVs on the smart grid. We found during our various 
simulations that despite the 2 million EVs added to the fleet on 
the horizon of 2020, and despite additional consumption of 
energy caused by the large number of EVs, the general 
behavior of smart grid has not changed “very significantly”. 
The EV power returned to the network is important and could, 
eventually, relieve the smart grid. The regenerative feedback 
into the smart grid does not affect the life of lithium-ion

batteries. The scenarios provide a minimum charge level for 
users. Designs of Experiments methodology have reduced the 
V2G model parameters from 14 to 4. As an example, our V2G 
model shows that for a fleet of 3 Million EVs, we can inject 
into the grid at about 31.6 GWh per day, representing energy 
production of two nuclear reactors (900 MW from each one 
and 32 GWh both of them) and a wind farm of 645 wind 
turbines (2 MW from each one and 31 GWh both of them). 
This illustrates the value of our V2G model and the benefits of 
using EVs within a Smart Grid environment.
