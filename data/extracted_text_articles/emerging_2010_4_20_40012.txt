Abstract—Personal area networks and, more speciﬁcally, body
area networks (BANs) are key building blocks of the future
generation networks and the Internet of Things as well. In the
last years, research has focused on the channel modeling and
the deﬁnition of efﬁcient medium access control (MAC) mech-
anisms. Less attention was paid to network-level performance.
Thereby, this paper presents a novel analytical model for network
performance analysis with centralized and mesh topologies. This
model takes into account the channel statistics (i.e., the large-scale
fading) and delivers several insights on the BAN implementation.
Index Terms—body area networks, wireless networks, fading,
performance analysis.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in ultra-low power sensors have fostered
the research in the ﬁeld of body-centric networks, also referred
to as body area networks (BANs). In these networks, a set
of nodes (called sensors) is deployed on the human body.
They aim at monitoring and reporting several physiological
values, such as blood pressure, breath rate, skin temperature,
or heart beating rate. A pictoral example of a BAN is shown
in Fig. 1, where two illustrative topologies are presented:
(i) a centralized topology, where a special node (denoted as
“HUB”) acts as a sink for all communications initiated by the
sensor and (ii) a mesh topology (or “multi-hop topology”),
where several intermediary nodes relay the information from
the source node to the destination (e.g., when data fusion or
sensor cooperation is required).

Most of the time, sensing is performed at low rates but,
in case of emergency, the network load may increase in
seconds. Therefore, an in-depth analysis of the network outage,
throughput, and achievable transmission rate can give insights
on the maximum supported reporting rate and the correspond-
ing performance.
The focus of this paper is on multi-hop communications and
the impact of the speciﬁcities of the propagation channel. The
modeling of the BAN channel has recently been thoroughly
investigated [1]–[5]. The main ﬁndings on the body radio
propagation channel can be summarized as follows. First,
the average value of the power decreases as an exponential
function of the distance. However, unlike classical propagation
models, where the received power P is a decreasing function
of the distance of the form d−α, in [6] the authors prove that
a law of the form 10−γd characterizes more accurately body
radio propagation. Second, the propagation channel is subject
to large-scale fading (that is, shadowing). This variation fol-
lows a zero-mean Gaussian distribution in the dB scale or a
Log-normal distribution in the linear scale.
This paper addresses the evaluation of the throughput for
BANs, being this metric a traditional measure of how much
trafﬁc can be delivered by the network [7], [8]. Therefore,
our analysis is expedient to understand the level of informa-
tion which could be collected and processed in body-related
applications (e.g., health or ﬁtness monitoring). We consider
slotted and asynchronous communications such that, in every
time slot, each node transmits independently with a probability
p. Indeed, in a generic scenario, the trafﬁc distribution in a
sensor network can be considered as spatially and temporally
bursty, that is, reporting periods alternate temporally and
spatially with periods and areas with little or no trafﬁc (or
even with a scheduled sleep of the nodes). It may therefore be
impractical to employ reservation-based MAC schemes, such
as those based on time/frequency division multiple access (TD-
MA/FDMA), that require a substantial amount of coordination
trafﬁc and cannot be implemented efﬁciently in energy- and
computation-constrained sensor nodes.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion II, the models, deﬁnitions, and notations are introduced.
Then, in Section III, the conditional success probability of
a transmission for a node given the transmitter-receiver and
interference-receiver distances is derived. Section IV investi-
gates the average link throughput and achievable transmission
rate for centralized and mesh topologies. Section V concludes
the paper.

II. MODELS, NOTATION, AND DEFINITIONS
A. Stochastic Channel Model
Deﬁning as P (r)
i
the received power from the i-th node at
distance d gives
Pi(d) = Pi L(di)Xi
where Pi is the emitted power, L(d) is the loss at distance d,
it accounts for the antenna gains and carrier frequency, and
Xi is a random variable (RV) which depends on the channel
characteristics. It is shown in [9] that Xi has a log-normal
distribution1 with parameters µ and σ, i.e., its cumulative
distribution function (cdf) is
FXi(x; µ, σ) = 1
2 − 1
2erf
µdB − 10 log10 x
σdB
√
2

where σdB typically ranges from 4 dB to 10 dB, µdB is the
average path loss on the link (dimension: [dB]). Since the loss
is accounted for by the term L(d), it follows that µdB = 0 and
the cdf of Xi reduces to the following:
FXi(x; 0, σ) = 1
2 − 1

.
(1)
In [6], [10], it is shown, on the basis of an extensive campaign
of measurements, that the path loss (in dB scale) is a linearly
increasing function of the distance, i.e.:
Pi − Pi(di) = Lref + 10γ(di − dref)
di > dref
where dref is a reference distance, Lref is the loss at that
distance, and γ a suitable constant. For instance, in [10]
the authors found dref = 8 cm, Lref = 55.18 dB, and
γ = 1.26dB/cm. The path loss, in linear scale, can then be
expressed as follows:
L(di)
=
10(10γdref−Lref)/10 .10−γdi
≜
L0 10−γdi.
(2)
B. Trafﬁc Model
The transmission state of the i-th node at time2 t is
represented by the following RV:
Λi(t) =
 1
if the i-th node transmits at time t
0
if the i-th node is silent at time t.
A simple random access scheme is such that, at each time
slot, a node transmits with probability p [11, p. 278]. There-
fore, {Λi(t)}∞
t=1 is a sequence of Bernoulli RVs with ∀t :
P {Λi(t) = 1} = p.
1Note that we use the log10 variant of the log-normal since the widely-used
shadowing model uses an additive Gaussian variation expressed in dB.
2For the sake of simplicity, we assume that t can take integer values, i.e.,
we refer to a slotted communication system.
C. Total Interference Power
A transmission in a given link is successful if and only
if the signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) is above
a certain threshold θ. This threshold value depends on the
receiver characteristics, the modulation format, and the coding
scheme, among others. The SINR at the receiving node of the
link is given by
SINR ≜
P0(d0)
W + Pint
(3)
where P0(d0) is the received power from the link source
located at distance d0, W is ambient the noise power, and Pint
is the total interference power at the link receiver, that is, the
sum of the received power from all the undesired transmitters:
Pint ≜ W +
N
X
i=1
Pi(di) Λi = W +
N
X
i=1
PiL(di) XiΛi.
D. Link Throughput and Link Transport Capacity
A transmission is successful if the channel is not in an
outage, i.e., if the (instantaneous) SINR exceeds a certain
threshold θ, that is, Ps = P {SINR > θ}.
The probabilistic link throughput (adimensional) is deﬁned
to be the success probability multiplied by the probability that
the transmitter actually transmits (in full-duplex operation)
and, in addition in half-duplex operation, the receiver actually
listens. So it is the unconditioned reception probability. This
is the throughput achievable with a simple ARQ scheme
(with error-free feedback) [12]. For the slotted transmission
scheme we consider, the half-duplex probabilistic throughput
is τ half ≜ p(1 − p)Ps and for full-duplex it is τ full ≜ p Ps.
Finally, the link achievable transmission rate (dimension:
[bit/s/Hz]) is deﬁned as the product of the probabilistic
throughput and the link capacity, i.e., T = τ log2(1 + SINR).

B. Narrowband Communications
The ﬁrst term of (6) deﬁnes the link probability of success in
a noise-limited regime, i.e., even if no interferers are present.
Starting from (4) with Pint = 0 gives:

.
If a threshold link probability of success equal to Pth

is
required and W is the thermal noise, a transmission is possible
if and only if
P0 ≥

L0 ζ−1(Pth
s ) 10γd0
0 < Pth
s < 1
(7)
where T = 300 K is the room temperature, k is the Boltz-
mann’s constant, and B is the transmission bandwidth. For
instance, in Fig. 2 the minimum transmission power P0 for a
ZigBee equipment (B = 5 MHz), operating at T = 30◦C with
a SINR θ = 10 dB and σ = 4 dB, is shown as a function of
the distance, considering various values of the required link
probability of success of Pth
s .
It can be seen that (i) the value of Pth
s
plays a limited
role on the transmission power3 and (ii) if the transmission
power is constrained by energy concerns, only short-range
communications (some tenths of centimeters) will be possible.
A multi-hop network architecture is therefore preferred.

In the following, we will consider only interfence-limited
networks, i.e., scenarios where condition (7) is satisﬁed. For-
mally, this situation is equivalent to letting W = 0 in (6).
IV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this section, we investigate networks with two topologies:
(i) a centralized (hub) architecture in which all nodes connect
to a central sink and (ii) a mesh architecture where every node
has the same number of nearest neighbors and the same dis-
tance to all nearest neighbors. Without any loss of generality,
we assume that all nodes are equivalent and, therefore, transmit
at equal power levels, i.e., ∀i, j ∈ {0, N} : Pi = Pj.

HUB
Fig. 3: Central hub surrounded by several nodes.
A. Hub Topologies
Fig. 3 presents a centralized architecture, where a central
node (called hub or sink) is surrounded by several nodes. These
nodes can be leaves of the routing tree or, in a star topology,
the coordinators of each star. In this architecture, all distances
between the nodes and the hub are approximately the same
(i.e., ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N} : di ≈ d0) and the link probability of
success at the hub becomes

.
The link achievable transmission rate is shown in Fig. 4
for full- and half-duplex systems. It can be seen that both
transmission strategies exhibit same performance when (i)
the number of nodes N to serve increases and (ii) the data
collection (through p) remains limited.

B. Mesh Topologies
Referring back to Fig. 1, it can be seen that a BAN build
using a mesh topology can be approximated as a cylindrical
surface of radius r and height 2h deployed on a human torso.
Without any loss of generality, the center of the reference axes
can be located on the receiver node. Therefore, as shown in
Fig. 5, the body area network can be modeled as a ﬁnite,
rectangular area of width 2πr and height 2h. For a regular

nodes distance is δ =

2πr = 1 m and 2h = 0.5 m, so that δ = 1/

Fig. 5: Schematic representation of a regular deployment of sensors.
It is interesting to note that the term 10γ(d0−di) is virtually
insensitive to an increase in the amount of nodes deployed
on the body surface. Indeed, if the amount of nodes is
multiplied by a factor α, the transmission distances are divided
accordingly, so that the term becomes 10γ(d0−di)/α. Since γ
is large (authors in [10] report γ = 126dB/m) and distances
are limited, the value of α has a small impact on the exponent
expression. This can also be interpreted as the fact that only
the direct neighbors do interfere on communications: these are
limited by interference from dominant nodes.
In Fig. 6, the throughput is plotted in a scenario similar
to Fig. 5 and with respect to the transmission distance. This
distance is expressed in terms of nodes hopped over, i.e., d0 =
nδ. More precisely, the transmission goes from n = 1 (direct
transmission to the closest neighbor) to n = 4 (transmission
four hops away).

It can be seen that, when the sensing rate is low (p ≪ 1),
long-range transmissions are to be preferred (for delay and
energy considerations). On the other hand, when p ≥ 0.05,
short-range communications and multi-hopping are more suit-
able.
C. Sustainable Number of Hops
In the context of multi-hop communications, each trans-
mission takes place on a route in which a certain amount of
intermediary nodes act as relays. The maximum sustainable
number of nodes (that is, the route length) is a critical
parameter since it quantiﬁes the effective distance that can

be covered and is an indicator of the connectivity of whole
the network [13]. It depends on the acceptable packet loss,
link interference, and topology among others.
In a conservative scenario, each node stores and forwards
every packet it receives, without any consideration for re-
transmissions. This case, though pessimistic, corresponds to
UDP-style connections and allows to derive the lower of bound
of the network performance. Since all links are considered
equals, the route probability of success is

rithm [15], [16] was used to determine the coefﬁcients {cj}
and {aj} for different values of σ and q = 10000 points
over the interval z ∈ [0, 1000]. The corresponding values are
