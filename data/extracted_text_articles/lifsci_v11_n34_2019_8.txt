Abstract - Our group developed a system for practicing 
breath sounds auscultation using KINECT. This system solves 
several problems associated with past simulation education 
models. The system is inexpensive, and simply operated. We 
evaluated the process of learning breath sounds auscultation 
with a nurse and a nursing student. In this paper, we introduce 
practical exercises, using the KINECT system. We also report 
the student’s evaluation of the system. We additionally 
completed an auscultation test using an existing breathing 
sound file and breathing sound data obtained using the 
KINECT system, and compared the results. We obtained 
responses from 78 students. All students replied that they were 
interested in the KINECT system, and 83.3% of students were 
able to distinguish an accessory murmur from normal breath 
sounds. In all, 97.4% of students reported feeling motivated to 
learn using the KINECT system. The result of the examination 
to identify a kind of the respiratory sound using the apparatus 
which we developed did not have a result and the change using 
existing sound data. The KINECT system was useful for 
learning breath sounds. Use of the system was interesting to 
the students because of the simulated patient interaction, 
similar to those encountered in “real life” clinical settings. 
Using the realistic KINETIC system, the nursing students were 
able to develop the skills necessary to distinguish breath 
sounds. Additionally, the system was motivating for nursing 
students.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
We developed an auscultation practice system using 
KINECT to solve various problems related to simulation-
based education [1] [2]. KINECT is a relatively inexpensive, 
easy-to-operate system that can produce respiratory sounds 
(e.g., wheezes) in synchronization with the respiration of a 
simulated patient. 
In Japan, slowing birth rates and an aging population, as 
well as advanced medical treatments limit the scope and 
opportunities available for nursing students to practice 
nursing techniques within internship settings at hospitals; 
additionally, enhanced consciousness of medical care safety 
can limit opportunities to practice [3]. For example, most 
inpatients in Japan are elderly. Therefore, in clinical practice 
it is difficult to be in charge of adolescents and children. In 
addition, 
nursing 
students 
cannot 
perform 
invasive 
procedures, such as blood sampling or intravenous IV 
injection. 
Amid this climate, simulation-based nursing education is 
poised for wide dissemination, allowing students to 
repeatedly experience realistic practical settings without 
risking patients’ safety. Simulations represent learner-
oriented education, and the equipment has been introduced to 
our university [4]. 
There are three types of trainings conducted in simulation 
education, i.e., task training for acquiring techniques, 
algorithm training like learning Basic Life Support, and 
situation-based training in which various clinical situations 
are reproduced [5]. 
Education with a highly functional simulator capable of 
computerized control of vital signs, breath sounds, and heart 
sounds has been practiced in areas such as intensive care [5] 
and in operating rooms [6]. Simulation training is necessary 
for learning team-based cooperative skills involving nurses 
and physicians [7]. 
This highly functional simulator is unable to simulate 
conversation; however, it has a limited capacity to elicit 
simulated communication via an integrated microphone 
(operated remotely) in cases where conversation is 
warranted [8]. Communication is an important skill for 
nurses, and communicative competence is very important to 
patients’ care [9]. Therefore, simulated patients designed to 
replicate patient-specific sentiments and personalities, not 
only in terms of clinical history and physical findings, are 
widely used for medical staff and allied health students [5] 
[9].  
However, we cannot reproduce abnormal breath sounds 
because a simulated patient is a healthy person. In exercises 
for learning diseases such as pneumonia, a hybrid 
simulation is conducted where conversation is made with a 
simulated patient and respiratory sounds are auscultated by 
a simulator placed nearby, but this is also unnatural. These 
problems interfere with the natural flow of clinical settings. 
Furthermore, high-performance simulators and existing 
auscultation training equipment are very expensive. At our 
university, more than 90 nursing students are registered in 
one class. The number of expensive simulators necessary to

provide training and practice opportunities to this many 
students is cost-prohibitive. 
We therefore developed the auscultation practice system 
using KINECT to address these issues. In our system, a 
simulated patient play the role of a patient, instead of a 
humanoid, and stethoscope locations on the body are 
measured with KINECT. Movements of the upper body 
from breathing can also be detected by KINECT. Also, 
appropriate disease sounds including normal ones can be 
assigned at four points on the upper body. Practicing 
students hear such disease sounds, synchronized with the 
movement of breathing, through earphones when a 
stethoscope is placed on the assigned area [1] [2].   
This paper describes our early experiences using the 
KINECT 
system. Additionally, 
we 
report 
student 
assessments of the system. In Section Ⅱ , we describe 
related simulators and their problems. In Section Ⅲ, the 
method employed in the study is explained. In Section Ⅳ, 
the results of student assessments of the system, are outlined. 
A brief discussion is offered in Section Ⅴ. In Section Ⅵ, 
the method of simulation training using this system is 
described,   conclusions and recommendations for future 
research are presented in Section Ⅶ. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
    In this section, we describe related simulators and their 
problems. 
There are several varieties of equipment currently used for 
learning auscultation of respiratory sounds. Kyoto Science's 
breathing sound auscultation simulator "Lang" [10] is an 
upper body instrument (Fig. 1). Users can auscultate from 
the anterior chest and back. Heart sounds are also audible. 
Also, the pedestal illuminates in accordance with inspiration 
and expiration. 
The Sakamoto model "Choushin kun” is a similar upper 
body simulator (Fig. 2) with seven built-in speakers [11].  
For each speaker, breathing sounds can be selected and the 
volume adjusted. Like Kyoto Science's "Lang," heart sounds 
are also audible. 
The person-like simulator used in this research was the 
ALS simulator, made by Laerdal Medical [12] (Fig. 3).  
Speakers are built into both sides of the chest. The thorax 
can be moved up and down by injection of air from the 
outside. Heart sounds are also audible. The ALS is a high-
performance simulator capable of displaying values such as 
electrocardiogram and pulse oximetry on the monitor. 
In the model released from Cardionics, a seal is placed on 
the chest of a simulated patient [13] (Fig. 4). When a 
stethoscope is placed on the seal, respiratory sounds can be 
heard. 
Cardionics's simulator evolves into a suit with built-in seal.  
A simulated patient wears this suit and exercises [14] (Fig. 5). 
However, existing simulators are extremely expensive, 
ranging from one million yen to several million yen. Also, 
the cost is high because the seal is disposable. It is necessary 
to prepare a suit for each simulated patient, and extra 
expenses such as washing are required. 
The system we developed is designed only with KINECT 
and PC controlling it. Therefore, simulated patients can sit 
on a chair and express abnormal respiratory sounds, just like 
real patients, by breathing normally. Moreover, the system is 
relatively inexpensive [1] [2] (Figs. 6 and 7).

METHOD 
   In this section, we discussed the auscultatory exercise 
practice method and research method. 
A. Participants and data collection  
The subjects were 91 first graders at the School of 
Nursing. The first training was held in July 2017. The 
students were previously instructed on respiratory anatomy 
and physiology; however, they had not yet practiced 
conducting physical assessments. The next training was held 
in December 2017 after they learned the physical 
assessment.

B. Practice method and evaluation  
a) First training 
We practiced distinguishing an accessory murmur from 
normal breath sounds using a system which we developed 
and a realistic, person-like simulator (Figs. 8 and 9). 
The students broke up into groups of 15 to practice. At 
first, an upper-class student explained how to use the system 
and the person-like simulator, then explained the breath 
sounds auscultation method.  
After practice, we questioned the students using a Likert-
like scale. The questions included: 
 
Did you develop the ability to distinguish breath 
sounds? 
 
Were you interested in a system and person-like 
simulator? 
 
Did this exercise motivate you to learn nursing? 
Each student had an additional free response option for 
recording his or her impressions. 
 
b) The second training 
 The 
second 
training 
focused 
on 
distinguishing 
accessory murmurs using the new system and existing 
breathing sound data. After listening to the breath sounds, 
the nursing students labeled the type of breath sounds using 
clickers.

Figure 9. Practice using the person-like simulator 
 
C. Statistical analysis 
We compared the results following use of the person-
like simulator with the subsequently-developed system 
using the Mann-Whitney U test. In the test to distinguish 
the type of breath sounds, we compared the first and second 
training results using the McManey test. Using the chi-
square test, we compared the existing data with the test of 
the breathing sound of the newly-developed system. We 
used the SPSS Ver.22 statistical software program for all 
analyses. The level of significance was set at 5%. 
For the free description responses, we organized the 
various responses around several response categories. 
 
IV. 
RESULT 
 In this section, the effect of simulation training and the 
result of distinguishing breathing sounds were mentioned. 
 
A. Participant and Questionnaire Responses 
Response questionnaires were obtained from 84 (92.3%) 
students. Ultimately, 78 (85.7%) of those agreed to 
participate in the study. 
All students expressed interest (“interested” – 74.4%; 
“moderately interested” – 25.6%) in the newly-developed 
system (Table 1). The mean ± standard deviation was 3.74 
± 0.44. Additionally, all students expressed interest 
(“interested” - 85.9%; “moderately interested” - 14.1%) in 
the person-like simulator (Table Ⅰ). The mean ± standard 
deviation was 3.86 ± 0.35. There was no significant 
difference in the level of interest expressed, with regard to 
the developed system and the humanoid simulator. 
When asked if the newly-developed system motivated 
the students to learn nursing, 71.8% responded “agree.” 
Additional responses included “moderately agree” (25.6%), 
“moderately disagree” (1.3 %), and “disagree” (1.3%; Table 
Ⅱ). The mean ± standard deviation was 3.68 ± 0.57. When 
asked if the person-like simulator motivated them to learn 
nursing, responses included “agree” (87.2%), “moderately 
agree” (11.5%), and “moderately disagree” (1.3%; Table 
Ⅱ). The mean ± standard deviation was 3.86 ± 0.39.

TABLE IV.  DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN NORMAL BREATH SOUNDS AND 
ACCESSORY MURMURS 
 
With regard to the motivation to learn nursing, there was 
a significant difference between the newly-developed 
system and the person-like simulator (Table Ⅲ). 
In the exercise using the developed system, we asked if 
the students could distinguish between normal breath 
sounds and accessory murmurs. The students responded that 
the differences were "distinguishable" (23.1%), "moderately 
distinguishable" (60.3%), "moderately indistinguishable" 
(15.4%), and "indistinguishable" (1.3%; Table Ⅳ ). The 
mean ± standard deviation was 3.05% ± 0.66. 
In the exercise using the person-like simulator, we asked 
if they could distinguish between normal breath sounds and 
accessory murmurs. The students responded that the 
differences were "distinguishable" (19.2%), "moderately 
distinguishable" (60.3%), "moderately indistinguishable" 
(16.7%), and "indistinguishable" (3.8%; Table Ⅳ ). The 
mean ± standard deviation was 2.95±0.72. There was no 
significant difference in the reported ability to distinguish 
between respiratory sounds when comparing the newly-
developed system and the person-like simulator.

B. Free response field 
We compared the thematic categories extracted from the 
free response field for both the newly-developed system and 
the person-like simulator (Table Ⅴ). 
【Can learn communication】 included the following 
items: “I can learn how to respond to patients”; “I can 
learn while taking communication with before and after 
auscultation”; “I knew how to talk to patients”; and “I 
was able to learn how to attend to breath sounds and 
conversation.” 
There were 17 students who responded that “I can learn 
communication” using the newly-developed system. 
There were 7 students who expressed the same believe for 
the person-like simulator. 
【Ability to learn abnormal breath sounds】 included the 
following items: “Learn the difference between murmur 
and normal breath sounds”; “Can learn care for 
abnormality.” There were 17 students who responded that 
“I can learn abnormal breath sounds” using the newly-
developed system and 8 students with the same response to 
the person-like simulator. 
【Reproduction of the clinical situation】 includes the 
following items. "I can learn skills that resemble practical 
nursing"; "I can learn how to avoid causing the patient 
discomfort" and; "The respiratory sounds I heard were 
realistic." Fourteen students felt the newly-developed 
system accurately reproduced. 
There were 14 students who responded that the newly-
developed system accurately reproduced clinical situations 
and 11 students who had the same impression of the person-
like simulator.

【Motivation to learn】 included the following items. "I 
learned about advanced nursing care"; "I want to learn more 
about nursing"; "I felt motivated"; and "I am interested in 
nursing.” 
Fifteen students felt that the newly-developed system 
motivated them to learn. There were 39 students who 
responded that the person-like simulator motivated them to 
learn. 
Free responses for the person-like simulator included, 
“I was able to practice thinking as an actual human” In 
addition, "There is a need to think humanoid simulator as 
human"; "There are similarities between people, but they 
cannot actually speak, there is no real person's weight." 
Improvements on the developed system were proposed by 
six students. Critiques included: "The five ranges varied 
depending on the posture of the patient"; "It was difficult to 
react"; "The breath sounds were more realistic if you hear 
them through a stethoscope"; "The sound felt small"; "The 
sound was difficult to hear "; and "I thought that it would 
sound smooth if breath sensing improved. " 
 
C. Determining the type of respiratory sound 
Nursing students received an examination using existing 
data and the newly-developed system to examine their 
abilities to identify respiratory sound types. Following the 
first and second trainings, we compared the existing breath 
sound data with that obtained using the newly-developed 
system. 
In testing the existing sound files, the students were able 
to accurately distinguish among the various kinds of 
respiratory sounds. Fourth breathing sounds (normal breath 
sounds, wheezes, coarse crackles, rhonchi) were the most 
frequent answers in the second test (Table Ⅵ). 
In testing the newly-developed system, the students were 
able to accurately distinguish among the various breath 
sounds, with the exception of wheezes. Following the 
second training, the ability to distinguish between coarse 
crackles and normal respiratory sounds had improved.  
However, the ability to distinguish between fine crackles 
and rhonchi was somewhat diminished following the second 
training (Table Ⅶ). 
Following the first training, the number of correct 
answers for coarse crackles and normal respiratory sounds 
was significantly better when existing breath sound files 
were used. Using the newly-developed system, wheezes and 
rhonchi had significantly more correct answers (Table Ⅷ). 
Following the second training, correct responses to three 
kinds of respiratory sounds improved significantly more 
with use of the existing breath sound files, compared to the 
newly-developed system (Table Ⅸ).

DISCUSSION 
In our previous research, 50 clinical nurses felt that the 
newly-developed system was useful for learning to 
distinguish respiratory sounds [2]. 
In other words, this system is effective for 95.8% of 
nurses to learn by students, 87.8% is effective for nurses to 
learn. In this research, we compared the newly-developed 
system with a person-like simulator, which has been used 
conventionally. 
Comparing the two systems, we found a significant 
difference in students’ motivation to learn nursing. They 
appeared to be more motivating because the heart sounds and 
pulse 
were 
measurable, 
and 
the 
output 
of 
the 
electrocardiogram could be confirmed via monitor. Future 
development of the system should focus on enabling both 
respiratory and heart sounds. In addition, the result of the 
developed system is considered to be caused by students 
acting as simulated patients. The response of students and 
educators to high fidelity patient simulation has been 
extremely positive [15]. In the future, we plan to conduct 
training using simulated patients, rather than students. 
There was also no significant difference between the 
newly-developed system and the person-like simulator for 
facilitating the ability to distinguish between normal 
respiratory sounds and accessory murmurs. An auscultatory 
learning equivalent to the person-like simulator is possible 
using the newly-developed system. 
However, students made many mistakes when attempting 
to distinguish among detailed respiratory sounds. In the 
second auscultatory test of fine crackles, many students 
answered incorrectly, both when using existing sound data 
files and the newly-developed system. These mistakes 
appear to be attributable to hearing fine crackles only during 
inhalation and mistaking them as coarse crackles. We also 
did not observe improved accuracy at detecting rhonchi 
using the newly-developed system. The previous study 
suggested that highly contextualized learning environments 
may not be uniformly advantageous for instruction and may 
lead to ineffective learning by increasing extraneous 
cognitive loading in novice learners [16]. In addition, 
respiratory sounds were perceived as "difficult to hear.” 
Other students reported, “We thought that it would sound 
smooth if breath sensing improved." We think that it is 
caused by the delay incurred when switching between 
inspiration and expiration. According to our study, the 
detection delay of respiration in KINECT v2 is 1.47-0.17 
seconds for inspiration and 1.21-0.37 seconds for expiration 
[1] [2]. Under present circumstances, it is difficult to desire 
further detection capabilities. Therefore, respiratory sounds 
were not synchronized with breathing. After detecting the 
inspiration and reproducing the sound of inspiration, 
exhalation should be reproduced continuously. 
Next, we discuss the issues clarified from student free 
comments. 
-"The five ranges varied depending on the posture of the 
patient" and "It was difficult to react." 
Although the installation angle and the height of KINECT 
are constant, the position of the chair shifts when students 
practice one after another. Measures that can mark the 
position of the simulated patient and the nurse's chair are 
needed. 
- "It sounds more realistic if you hear it through a 
stethoscope" and "The sound felt small";  
This was likely caused by using a speaker connected by 
Bluetooth so that respiratory sounds could be heard by 
simulated patients and students other than those playing the 
role of nurse. The stethoscope auditory resolution can likely 
be improved by using a wireless earphone. 
Also, the newly-developed system reproduces respiratory 
sounds synchronized with respiration of a simulated patient. 
Therefore, it would be unsuitable for use in scenarios such as 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation of patients with no response. 
However, the ability to communicate is an important ability 
for medical personnel such as nurses and doctors and 
requires entraining early on in clinical education. 
From the free comments of this survey, it was revealed 
that the developed system is useful 【 for learning 
abnormalities 】  while taking 【 communication 】  that 
【reproduction of a clinical situation】. 
For example, in a scenario where communication between 
medical personnel and patients is essential, we believe that 
the effectiveness of this system will be evident. Some 
examples may include: 
 Physical assessment of patients with convalescent 
pneumonia 
 Guidance for discharge from the hospital 
 Cases requiring physical assessment and medication 
guidance for elderly patients 
 A case of a febrile home care patient

EXAMPLE OF A SIMULATION EXERCISE USING THE 
NEWLY-DEVELOPED SYSTEM 
We introduced a simulation-based on a scenario of a 
patient with pneumonia before clinical practice.

Figure 10. Simulation of respiratory sound auscultation 
 
A KINECT was placed on the foot side of the bed with the 
head lifted (Fig. 9). This KINECT placement is in front of 
the patient, so the thorax can be sensed without distortion. 
Therefore, when the stethoscope contacts the thorax, it can 
detect respiratory sounds in the correct position. Also, since 
students approach from the side of the bed, they will not 
block the KINECT’s detection field, which is a good 
arrangement. To assist students with concentrating on the 
simulation, a personal computer was placed behind the 
curtain. Nasal cannulas for oxygen therapy and devices for 
vital signs measurement were also available. 
Patients with pneumonia generally receive oxygen therapy 
using a nasal cannula (Fig. 10). As advance preparation, the 
patient's breath sound sets featured accessory murmurs 
(coarse crackles or wheezes, rhonchi) in one or both lungs. 
This sound reproduces respiration that is affected by sputum 
over-production. The simulated patient wears typical 
clothing and sits on the bed. 
The simulation training time was 10 minutes. First year 
nursing students entered the hospital room and greeted the 
patient. After that, they checked the nasal cannula, 
performed auscultation of respiratory sounds, and measured 
vital signs. The students asked the patient about signs and 
symptoms of dyspnea, the presence of sputum, and 
perceived pain. In addition, the students communicated with 
the patient to get a comprehensive sense of the patient’s 
complaints. After the simulation, the students reviewed the 
session with the group members using the checklist. 
Debriefing time was carried out in 15 minutes using a 3-
Phase Conversation Structures like the GAS method [17]. 
During debriefing, the students discussed what they were 
doing as nurses and how to improve, as a group. The 
simulation and debriefing were repeated three times. In 
these scenarios, the patient’s respiratory state gradually 
worsened little by little. The patient also developed a 
medical device-related pressure ulcer behind the ear. 
Medical device-related pressure ulcers of the ear, results 
from contact with oxygen tubing, is included in the scenario 
for additional training [18].

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Our group developed a system for practicing breath 
sounds auscultation using KINECT. This system solves 
several problems associated with past simulation education 
models. The system is inexpensive, and simply operated. We 
evaluated the process of learning breath sounds auscultation 
with a nurse and a nursing student. In this paper, we 
introduced practical exercises, using the KINECT system. 
The newly-developed system was equally useful as a person-
like simulator for assisting students with developing their 
ability to distinguish normal breathing sounds and accessory 
murmurs. 
In addition, the system proved useful for learning 
anomalies while communicating in an environment that

accurately reproduced a clinical setting. Additionally, the 
system was motivating for nursing students. 
Future efforts should address environmental settings, 
including the system, improving the stethoscope, and the 
timing of the respiratory sound reproduction in order to 
enhance training reproducibility within the simulated clinical 
setting.
