Abstract-The microbiological quality of tahini produced by 
several manufacturers in Lebanon was evaluated. Forty two 
tahini samples were collected randomly from retail markets 
throughout the country with production dates ranging from 
October 2015 to August 2017. The majority of the samples 
were from companies that are international exporters of the 
product. Six of the obtained samples were from a traditional 
tahini manufacturer. All samples were assessed for the total 
aerobic plate count, the presence and enumeration of 
Staphylococcus aureus, yeasts and molds, Salmonella, coliforms 
and Escherichia coli. Spread plate methods were used for 
detection and enumeration. The following results were 
obtained: the aerobic plate count of the samples ranged 
between 1x102 CFU/g and 6.2x105 CFU/g with an average of 
6.9x104 CFU/g. S. aureus count ranged between <20 CFU/g and 
9.2x103 CFU/g with an average of 4.7x102 CFU/g. Yeasts and 
molds were present at counts ranging from <10 CFU/g to 
1.5x105 with an average of 2.3x104 CFU/g. Total coliform 
counts ranged between <30 CFU/g and 3.4x105 CFU/g with an 
average of 3.4x104 CFU/g.  E. coli was present in 43% of the 
samples (18 out of 42), while Salmonella was confirmed present 
in 17% of the samples (7 out of 42). When compared with 
Lebanese standards, many of the samples showed unacceptable 
quantities of microbial contamination and this was not 
impacted by the storage time, nor the processing method.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Tahini is a well-known Middle Eastern condiment made 
from toasted ground hulled sesame seeds. The paste has 
gained popularity all over the globe as a result of its health 
and culinary benefits [1]. In 2014, the Middle East and 
Mediterranean tahini market was estimated to be at a value 
of US$783.9 Million, with forecasts of a further escalation 
by 2020. Lebanon has been an important exporter of tahini, 
and is home to many key players in the market [2].  
The importance of tahini comes from the fact that it is 
used commercially and at a household level as an ingredient 
in many cultural delicacies. These include products that have 
gained international popularity, such as Hummus, and mtabal 
betejen (roasted eggplant and tahini) [3]. The paste is also 
used as a sauce for meats like shawarma, and as a sauce for 
fish, also known as tarator. Tahini also makes up about 50% 
of halawa, a sweet made up of tahini, sugar, citric acid and 
Saponaria officinalis root extract [4]. 
Tahini is of high nutritive value. It is rich in lipids, 
proteins, carbohydrates, niacin, thiamin, and some minerals 
like calcium, and phosphorous [5]. 
The traditional way of tahini processing in Lebanon 
includes: sorting the seeds to remove dark or imperfect 
seeds, followed by soaking the seeds in salt water. This helps 
settle impurities and dirt at the bottom and ease the peeling 
process. The seeds that are floating on the surface of the 
water are then collected, peeled and washed. The next step 
involves roasting the seeds, followed by the stone-grinding 
phase, which brings out the oil in the sesame and turns it into 
a paste.  
Many tahini manufacturers, however, rely on a fully 
automated process. Instead of soaking the seeds in salt water, 
they are passed into a centrifuge that separates any 
impurities. The sesame then enters a washing machine, 
followed by a drying machine and then a roaster. The roasted 
sesame is cleaned once again and sorted by color. The 
accepted seeds then undergo grinding, are homogenized and 
then finally pasteurized at a high temperature for several 
hours to get rid of any potential bacteria [6][7].  
After production tahini is stored at room temperature and 
has a shelf life up to 2 years [8]. It is typically consumed 
directly and does not require any further processing. 
Therefore, it should be free from any pathogenic bacteria 
upon packaging. The raw sesame itself should also be free 
from microbes, so as not to increase the risk of 
contamination. [9] However, despite the development of a 
hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP)  plan for the 
manufacturing of tahini [10], in recent years, sesame paste 
has emerged as a product of concern, with many of the end 
products containing Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus , 
Escherichia coli, and a number of other hazardous microbes. 
In addition tahini has a low water activity (~0.16) as well as 
low pH (~5.9) [10], conditions that permit the growth of 
many foodborne microorganisms [11]. 
The presence of microbes has been attributed to a number 
of reasons including, the microbial quality of sesame seeds, 
poor hygiene and sanitation, and improper processing and 
storage conditions [12]. Outbreaks of Salmonella infections 
have been traced back to tahini, some particularly correlated 
with Lebanese products [13]. Though some studies have 
dealt with the microbiological quality of sesame seed 
products, a collective investigation into tahini products in 
Lebanon using conventional plating methods has yet to be 
established. Therefore, the objective of this study will be to 
detect and enumerate microbial contamination of tahini in 
Lebanon, while also checking the impact of storage time and 
processing method on the microbial quality. This paper 
includes four sections. Aside from the introduction, Section 2

will include a detailed description of the materials and 
methods used in the study. In Section 3 we mention the 
microbial results obtained and whether sample age and the 
method of processing may have had an impact on the 
obtained results, which we discuss in accordance to similar 
studies. In the final section, Section 4, we wrap up our 
research in a concluding statement and mention some 
limitations, as well as possible future work in the related 
area.  
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Sampling 
Forty two tahini samples with production dates varying 
from October 2015 to August 2017 were collected from 
retailers and producers throughout Lebanon. Six of the 
samples were obtained from a company that produces tahini 
via the traditional method (no automated machinery). 
Sample weights varied between 200g and 900g. All samples 
were held at room temperature (25oC) and collected in their 
original packages, which were wiped with ethanol before 
testing. Using a sterilized rod, the samples were thoroughly 
mixed. 25 g of each sample were then transferred aseptically 
into separate sterile plastic bags containing 225 ml of 
buffered peptone water for homogenization. Homogenization 
was carried out using a stomacher (Model, 1605 BL Smart) 
for 2 minutes. Following homogenization ten-fold serial 
dilutions up to 103 were prepared and inoculated on 
appropriate media. 
B. Microbial Analysis  
Aerobic plate counts (APC), Staphylococcus aureus, 
coliforms, and yeasts/molds counts were determined for each 
sample, as well as the presence or absence of Escherichia 
coli, and Salmonella.  
C. Aerobic Plate Count 
APCwas determined according to the procedure specified 
by Morton R.D [14]. 0.1 ml of each dilution was inoculated 
and spread onto plate count agar (PCA) (Himedia) and left to 
dry. The plates were then incubated at 35±10C for 48 ±2 
hours.  
D. Staphylococcus aureus 
S. aureus was detected and enumerated via surface 
plating 0.5 ml on Mannitol Salt agar (MSA) (Himedia) and 
incubating plates at 35±10C for 48 ±2 hours. Colonies with 
typical and atypical S. aureus morphology were confirmed 
by catalase and coagulase test. This method is in accordance 
with that specified by the British standards institution, with a 
modification of the agar [15].  
E. Yeast and Mold  
Yeast and mold counts were determined following spread 
plate inoculation onto Saubaurad dextrose agar (SDA) 
(Himedia). Plates were incubated at 25 ±10C for 5 days. This 
procedure was taken from the United States Food and Drug 
administration (USFDA) [16] however the proposed agar 
was substituted with SDA.  
F. Total coliforms and Escherichia coli 
Total coliforms were enumerated on Eosin methylene 
blue agar (EMB) (Himedia) [17]. An addition to the 
procedure determined by Gehm & Heukelekian included pre-
enrichment of 1 ml of the samples with 10 ml lactose broth 
(Himedia) for 48 hours, at an incubation temp of 35 ±10C. 
Following the pre-enrichment step, 1 ml of each dilution was 
surface plated onto EMB agar plates and incubated at 
35±10C for 48 ±2 hours. Plates with typical E.coli colonies 
were confirmed for presence of the bacteria via biochemical 
IMViC tests (Himedia).   
G. Salmonella 
For detecting Salmonella, the FDA Bacteriological 
analytical Manual (BAM) procedure was implemented, with 
some modifications [18]. Pre-enrichment was carried out by 
suspending 25g of each sample in 225ml of lactose broth 
(Himedia), followed by incubation at 35±10C for 24 ±2 
hours. 1 ml of each sample was then transferred to 10 ml 
tubes of selenite F broth (SFB) (Himedia) and incubated at 
35±10C for 24±2 hours. After incubation, 3 mm loopfuls 
were streaked onto Salmonella Shigella agar (SS) (Himedia) 
and incubated for another 24 ±2 hours. Typical and atypical 
colonies for presumptive Salmonella were then transferred to 
Triple Sugar Iron Agar (TSI) (Himedia). Confirmation was 
carried out via IMViC biochemical tests (Himedia), urease 
broth (Himedia), and Phenol D broth (Himedia).  
H. Statistical analysis 
The data was analyzed using analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) complete randomized design, and computed via 
the java software SPSS. Differences among means of the 
treatments were analyzed using Duncan. Significant 
differences are determined when p≤0.05. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
APC, S. aureus, total coliform, and yeast and mold counts, 
as well as the presence or absence of Salmonella and E.coli 
are shown in Table 1. The aerobic plate count of the samples 
ranged between 1x102 CFU/g and 6.2x105 CFU/g with an 
average of 6.9x104 CFU/g. S. aureus count ranged between 
<20 CFU/g and 9.2x103 CFU/g with an average of 4.7x102 
CFU/g. Yeast and mold was present at counts ranging from 
<10 CFU/g to 1.5x105 with an average of 2.3x104 CFU/g. 
Total coliform counts ranged between <30 CFU/g and 
3.4x105 CFU/g with an average of 3.4x104 CFU/g. E.coli 
was confirmed present in 43% of the samples (18 out of 42), 
(presence of E.coli was noted when confirmed counts 
exceeded 10 CFU/g), while Salmonella was confirmed 
present in 17% of the samples (7 out of 42).  
Lebanese standards (LIBNOR NL 71 :2012) set the 
unacceptable limit for APC, yeast and molds, E.coli and 
Salmonella at 1x104 CFU/g, 1x103 CFU/g, 10 CFU/g, and  
21

0 CFU/g respectively [19], beyond which microbial content 
could prove hazardous upon consumption. Standards 
available from the gulf countries (GSO) set the limit for S. 
aureus in tahini at 1x102 CFU/g [20]. As seen in Table 2, a 
considerable amount of the samples analyzed contained 
unacceptable microbial content. 43% of the samples 
contained unacceptable quantities of APC and E. coli.  
Almost half of the samples (48%) showed unacceptable 
quantities of S. aureus, while more than half of the samples 
were unacceptable for yeast and mold quantities (64%). 
Meanwhile coliform counts were intolerably high in 98% of 
the tested samples. Even minute amounts of Salmonella are 
detrimental to one’s health and therefore 17% of the samples 
were found to be hazardous. These results were also 
consistent with standards set by the FDA for ready to eat 
foods [21].  
Furthermore, when the microbial content of the samples 
were determined in accordance with sample age, there 
seemed to be no significant differences. Therefore the 
amount of time the product spends on the shelf seemed to 
have no significant impact (p>0.05) on the microbial quality. 
In a similar study however, the microbial counts of tahini 
were seen to have decreased after four months [10].  
Another factor studied was the processing method, 
whether by traditional methods or solely automated 
machinery (modern). Statistical analysis of the data showed

in Table 4 also showed no significant differences (p>0.05) 
between the samples. Therefore the processing method does 
not appear to be an influencing factor in regards to microbial 
counts.  
The obtained results indicate that some tahini produced in 
Lebanon is hazardous and could pose life threatening 
consequences. In addition, about 35 percent of tahini 
produced in the country is exported, specifically to the USA, 
EU, Australia and the GCC.   The products tested in this 
study include some of the country’s major producers and 
exporters. The fact that Lebanese tahini has had incidents 
where Salmonella was detected, has reduced the quantities 
for export, especially to the USA [22]. Therefore the results 
indicate that Lebanese tahini could also have threatening 
consequences to health on a global scale, or to the country’s 
profits from tahini exports. Similar studies on the microbial 
quality of sesame seed products have been carried out and 
similar results were obtained. Tahini samples taken 
immediately after production from 14 plants located in 
Amman, Jordan were found to contain significant results of 
APC, coliforms, S. aureus, and yeasts and molds [8]. This is 
not the first time Salmonella has been identified in tahini. In 
a comparable study in Saudi Arabia, Salmonella was 
apparent in 20% of the samples studied [23]. Salmonella was 
also identified in other sesame seed products [24]. In Turkey, 
a study done on the microbial quality of halva (halawa), also 
showed that Salmonella dominated in many of the samples 
[8].Tahini has a low water activity and is therefore 
considered to be a low risk food. However it is a ready to eat 
product and there are many critical points during production 
that can expose the product to contamination if good 
manufacturing 
processes 
are 
not 
implemented. 
Contamination may occur from the use of contaminated 
water during washing or soaking, cross contamination during 
processes that are open to air, for example, grinding or 
filling, or bad hygiene conditions within the factory [7]. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
strongly 
recommended 
that 
tahini 
manufacturing 
companies 
strictly 
adhere 
to 
the 
implementation of good manufacturing processes to ensure 
safe microbial counts.  Other studies have even shown that 
contamination could come from the soil or sesame seeds 
themselves [25], and so thorough investigation of the 
microbial quality of sesame seeds used for tahini production 
in Lebanon could also be assessed in the near future.  
This is the first collective study in Lebanon that 
determines the quality of tahini produced in the country by 
studying the microbial quality of the products via 
conventional plating methods, while also considering the 
sample age as well as the processing methods as possible 
impact factors.  
Although the paper does only consider Lebanese products, 
it is worth noting that all the studied samples are from 
companies that export tahini worldwide, making the problem 
a global concern. Also, other major worldwide exporters 
(e.g., Turkish, Jordanian, and Saudi Arabian companies) also 
carried out similar studies on the tahini quality in their 
respective countries [10][23][8], and hence, this study is to 
complement the others. Furthermore the discovery of 
contaminated tahini products in other countries, (Jordon, 
Turkey, and Saudi Arabia) [10][23][8] motivated us to test 
the quality of tahini in Lebanon. 
 
IV. 
     CONCLUSION 
The results of this study provided an evaluation into the 
microbial quality of forty two tahini products manufactured 
in Lebanon and showed that some products are unacceptable 
in accordance to local and international standards. The 
results were also determined to be irrespective of the sample 
age, or processing method. Limitations include unequal 
sample sizes for the different factors studied (sample age, 
processing method) due to limited resources, and the 
randomization procedure. Currently, more samples are being 
assessed for microbial contamination in order to provide 
more accurate results. Further testing will be required to 
determine the source of contamination in order to contain it. 
Furthermore, the study could be a basis for further research 
(19) aimed at eradicating high microbial counts in tahini 
without impacting the overall physiochemical quality.
