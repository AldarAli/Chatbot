Abstract—Telecommunications operators continuously adapt 
their services offerings to new services usage trends in order to 
expand their customer base and enhance business models. 
With regard to existing services usage patterns, it is possible to 
select services that are suitable to users’ needs and to create 
stronger business models. This is especially important given 
the fact that, despite numerous advantages arising from the 
new Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, a majority of operators 
still have not defined adequate IoT offers and related strategies 
for the deployment in the telecommunication markets. In this 
paper, the process of selection of telecommunications services 
is examined considering predictive modeling processes which 
are based on the time series data representing services 
adoption rates. The given forecasted results indicate an 
effective choice for creating adequate business models based on 
IoT services offerings and a reduction of modeling risks which 
are often related to the deployment of new services on the 
market. 
Keywords - telecommunications services; services usage; 
prediction models; business modeling. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
An overall boost in the volume of network traffic and the 
evolution towards the next generation networking based on 
advanced information and communication technologies 
(ICT) encourage telecommunications operators to consider 
and improve their existing business planning and modeling 
approaches according to market trends and services usage 
patterns in the existing network settings. Due to a vast 
number of possible options and existing requirements related 
to 
quality, 
efficiency, 
and 
performance 
of 
novel 
telecommunications services, an optimal selection of 
services becomes a very challenging task for operators. 
Although services quality will be additionally addressed by 
intelligent algorithms for adapting resource management and 
implementation 
of 
adequate 
techniques 
for 
content 
offloading, given accelerated trends in services development, 
there is often not a lot of time to closely consider customer 
requests related to services offerings before launching 
services on the markets. This last aspect is particularly 
important considering the fact that a vast number of 
operators are currently searching for the best solutions for 
positioning on the Internet of Things (IoT) services markets.  
The prediction-based planning, services selection, and 
business modeling processes present significant challenges 
for operators under new market conditions. Therefore, the 
selection of adequate models for services offerings based on 
analytics of adoption of similar types of telecommunications 
services can effectively contribute to the optimization of 
business planning processes, as presented by analyses results 
gathered in this paper, as well.  
Telecommunications services analytics usually takes into 
account time series data reflecting usage rates of particular 
services. That could point to valuable communication 
services, which reflect the specific needs of particular types 
of end users. If taking data representing services usage 
patterns into account to derive useful knowledge within a 
certain environment, suitable prediction models must be 
defined.  
In this paper, the analytics of telecommunications 
services adoption processes is conducted using several 
predictive models which take into account only the cases 
with small sets of available time series data. In Section 2, an 
overview of current trends in telecommunication services 
adoption is presented. In Section 3, the importance of usage 
of the models for prediction of telecommunications services 
adoption in optimal business modeling is accentuated, and an 
overview of several common, as well as some additional 
predictive models, is presented. In Section 4, the defined 
models are applied to several collected data sets, and the 
collected results are presented and analyzed. In Section 5, in 
order to reduce the business modeling risks, optimal 
approaches in making decisions are indicated when short-
term business planning is necessary under fast-changing 
market conditions. 
II. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES ADOPTION TRENDS 
The majority of current forecasts and market estimates 
reflect operators’ high expectations for scale and scope 
arising 
from 
advanced 
telecommunications 
services 
offerings, and especially IoT services offerings. The positive 
expected results represent a major incentive for advanced 
services development and implementation processes. These 
expectations introduce new research challenges across 
different telecommunications settings. 
The majority of businesses based upon usage of 
advanced telecommunications services monitor metrics that 
reflect improvements in supply levels and customer quality 
of experience rates. Higher levels of availability and quality 
of services could induce additional growth of services 
adoption, which is closely correlated with profitability gains, 
as presented in Figure 1 [1].

Therefore, the analyses and comparisons of possible 
business models involving various telecommunications 
services are important for the business planning processes of 
every telecommunications operator on the market since a 
timely application of relevant data and new knowledge 
represents an important advantage within every business 
modeling process, and can help in reducing churn rates.  
Intensive adoption processes of a wide range of Internet 
services are currently taking place, as illustrated in Figure 1 
[1]. One of the main drives behind the further anticipated 
traffic growth is the usage of audio and video-on-demand 
services and increase of the video content resolution [2]. So, 
audio-visual media streaming will account for the majority of 
overall network data traffic. In addition to these factors, other 
factors that are expected to impact the overall future traffic 
demand comprise an increase in the bit-rates and quality of 
experience. Moreover, the exchange of data traffic among 
end-user devices, terminal network equipment, servers and 
storage in the cloud will continue to grow. 
The IoT solutions have the potential of becoming major 
contributors to the upcoming change in developing ICT 
business concepts. As part of the IoT solutions, Machine–
to–Machine (M2M) services, which include automated 
communication and data transmission among two or 
more ICT entities, also have the potential of becoming 
one of the fastest growing segments for the Internet usage 
and increased mobile data demand. Although common 
characteristics of IoT and M2M are based on remote 
access to devices, IoT is expanding the concept of M2M 
because it can be integrated into comprehensive, scalable, 
and flexible business solutions. While IoT is focused 
more on software solutions and the IP network, M2M 
communication is predominantly oriented on embedded 
hardware and mobile networks. M2M communications 
are based on installing a SIM card or pulling a fixed line, 
but considering the fact that M2M with internet protocol 
represents a part of IoT, the common M2M/IoT services 
adoption trends can be closely analyzed.

Figure 2.  Internet services packages. 
As presented in Figure 2, many different forms of 
telecommunications services offerings are currently 
available in the markets [1]. Although the stand-alone 
service offerings have kept a strong position in the 
markets, services packages comprising more than one 
type of service have also achieved intensive adoption 
rates. These are, for example, any service packages 
where two (i.e., the 2D packages) or three (i.e., the 3D 
packages) electronic telecommunications services (e.g., 
the Internet, telephone or/and TV services) are provided 
to users jointly. The 4D packages, which have recently 
been introduced in the markets, mainly comprise a 
combination of telephone services in the fixed network, 
telephone services in the mobile network, Internet 
services, and TV services. As can be seen from the 
services adoption rates presented in Figure 2, the 4D 
packages note for fast adoption growth, mainly based on 
their total value. This goes in line with the concept which 
suggests the creation of all-inclusive services offerings 
for the end users, and a specific definition of the services’ 
features [3]. 
Many advanced telecommunications networks implement 
necessary features that allow simultaneous management of 
various services, applications, and devices with different 
network and traffic requirements, and defined the quality of 
services. The methods that can be considered necessary for 
the selection of adequate services offerings to achieve 
optimal business models are based on the usage of predictive 
models and accurate forecast of services adoption rates. 
 
III. PREDICTIVE MODELS 
The models for prediction of telecommunications 
services adoption rates are increasingly important for optimal 
business modeling. The various predictive models whose 
implementation contributes to accurate business modeling 
are used [4].

An overall increase in network traffic has encouraged 
telecommunications operators to search for the best 
approaches to handle available data traffic, apply analytics 
over gathered data, and derive useful knowledge. Some 
efficient processes that can be used for the selection of 
adequate forecasting methods are described in [5]. 
For processing time series data, one of the most 
commonly used methods includes data classification. There 
are many examples of successful usage of data classification 
processes, some of which are used in adapting the mobility 
management mechanisms [6], prediction of applications’ 
data consumption [7], and user activity [8]. 
In this paper, the several commonly used models for time 
series data analytics, described for instance in [9], and some 
additional models, described in more detail in [10], are taken 
into account. In [10], the analysis is conducted to point to the 
fact that the presented models enable an adequate forecast of 
the number of future service users.  
However, the aim of the analysis conducted in this paper, 
unlike the one conducted in [10], is to demonstrate that the 
predictive modeling processes can also be used for selecting 
the best service offerings for chosen scenarios. This is 
particularly important for enhancing business planning 
processes and the selection of the most effective business 
models.  
A. Common Models Used in Predictive Modeling   
The scope of this paper covers the analyses of several 
common models [9], as well as additional predictive models 
[10], with the objective to compare their predictive accuracy.  
1) Simple Logistic model 
The simple Logistic model is a commonly used model 
for the forecasting of service market adoption, and is 
defined by the following expression: 


where L represents the number of broadband users per 
capita over period t. The model is defined by the following 
parameters: M, which reflects the market capacity; a, which 
reflects the speed of broadband adoption; and b, which 
positions the graph on the timescale. 
2) Richards model 
Richards model is called the Logistic model of four 
parameters, and is defined by the following expression:

parameters: M, which reflects the market capacity; a, which 
reflects the speed of broadband adoption; b, which positions 
the graph on the timescale; and c, which positions the 
model’s inflection point. 
3) Bass model  
The Bass model represents the most commonly used 
model for prediction of new services, and is defined by the 
expression:

where B represents the number of broadband users per capita 
over period t. The model is defined by the following 
parameters: M, which reflects the market capacity; p, which 
reflects the coefficient of innovation (p> 0); q, which reflects 
the coefficient of imitation (q ≥ 0); and t, which reflects the 
time when the service was introduced in the market (t≥ts). 
4) Gompertz model 
The Gompertz model is a special case of a Logistic 
function, and is defined by the following expression:

over period t. The model is defined by the following 
parameters: M, which reflects the market capacity; a, which 
reflects the speed of broadband adoption; and b, which 
positions the graph on the timescale.  
B. Additional Predictive Models   
In order to expand the analysis and compare features of 
additional models, combinations of some other parameters 
are taken into account and combined models are derived, as 
described in more detail in [10], using the following 
expression:

account several additional combinations of parameters’ 
values, previously defined in [10], as presented in Table I.

1) GB model  
The GB model combines the features of the Gompertz 
(G) and Bass (B) models. Like the Gompertz model, it has a 
fixed inflection point and the three parameters, M, a, and b, 
respectively.

It models the fast growth. Moreover, this model can also

the Bass model. 
2) GR model  
The GR model combines the features of the Gompertz 
(G) and Richards (R) models and models fast growth. Like 
the Richards model, it has a flexible inflection point and the 
four parameters, M, a, b and c, respectively.

The predictive models can be additionally modified 
using more explanatory parameters. Although certain 
generalizations of the existing models expand their features’ 
description, additional parameters require larger sets of 
known data points used in the predictive modeling process, 
which limits their usage.  
IV. MODELING OF SERVICES ADOPTION PROCESS 
All these models are suited for modeling of services 
adoption trends. For the given models, the analyses that point 
to the accuracy of fitting and forecasting processes are 
conducted. The estimated parameters can be used to generate 
the prediction of future values based on the known ones.  
A. Fitting Process 
As can be seen from the results presented in Figures 3-5, 
the fitting processes comprise the adjustments of models 
parameters to best describe the default time series values 
(denoted as ‘Data’) representing the number of users and 
revenues, respectively. The results point to the fact that the 
Bass model can model faster growth, but its accuracy 
improves as the number of known data points, i.e., the ones 
used for training, increase. All other models show similarly 
good properties in the presented cases, despite somewhat 
scattered data set for quarterly periods presented in Figure 3.

B. Forecasting Process 
A number of measures are used to determine the 
accuracy of forecasts [6]. Statistical criteria can be selected 
only after making the decision about the general type of 
forecasting method. There are mainly four types of forecast-
error metrics: scale-dependent, percentage-error, relative-
error, and scale-free error metrics. The chosen statistical 
metrics that describe the accuracy of forecasted time series 
values are the forecast error and the mean absolute 
deviation, as good metrics to use when analyzing the error 
for a single output, and considering the fact that the 
prediction errors are in the same unit as the original series. 
The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), also commonly 
called the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), is the measure of 
aggregate error defined by the expression:   

n
E
MAD
n
i
i



1

           
                 
where n is the number of prediction errors which are used for 
the calculation, and forecast error, E, is the difference 
between the actual value and the forecasted value in the 
corresponding period t. A smaller value of the mean 
deviation denotes the model's better prediction performance.  
The sample data set is divided into subsets which 
comprise the training data (shaded in Figures 3-5) - used for 
the model parameters fitting, and the testing data (all other) - 
used for determination of the accuracy of the forecasted 
values. The chosen available data sets comprise the number 
of users of the 4D services packages [1], the number of users 
of the M2M/IoT services [1], and the global revenue of IoT 
[2].  
C. Overview and Analysis of Results 
Considering the gathered results of the conducted fitting 
processes presented in Figures 3-5, and the conducted 
forecasting processes presented in Figures 6-8, the primary 
difference among the models’ fitting and forecasting 
accuracy is caused by different positions of the models’ 
inflection points.  
As presented in Figures 3-8, the Bass model shows 
limitations both in fitting and in the forecasting of the initial 
short-term upper market capacity. All other models show 
good fitting properties, as presented in Figures 3-5. 
Moreover, the Logistic model is less accurate in the 
forecasting of accelerated growth, as presented in Figure 8, 
and is more suitable for modeling of slower growth. It can 
also be noticed that, in the slower growth phase, the simple 
Logistic model gives the most accurate forecasting results, as 
presented in Figure 7. Furthermore, the good forecasting 
properties of the Richards model within the growth phase are 
caused by its flexible inflection point, which can be 
accurately adapted to the given changes in the modeling 
values, as presented in Figures 6-8. Finally, the Gompertz 
model shows a good accuracy in forecasting within the 
growth phase since it adequately models the accelerated 
growth of values, as presented in Figures 6-8.

The additional GB, GR and GBR models combine the 
features of the Gompertz (G), Bass (B), and Richards (R) 
models. The combined models that have the features of the 
Gompertz model accurately predict the fast growth. 
However, the lack of the Gompertz model relates to the fact 
that it can not limit the excessive growth in the long run, and 
this can reflect the forecasting accuracy of the combined 
models, as well.

Since the Bass model has difficulties in assessing the 
exact upper market capacity limit in the initial growth 
phase, the forecasting accuracy of the Bass model combined 
solely with the Gompertz model, i.e., the GB model, is also 
not adequate, as presented in Figures 6-8.  
However, the model that combines the features of the 
Bass model with the Gompertz and Richards models, i.e., 
GBR model, is more accurate for forecasting of the long-
term adoption of the services since having a flexible 
inflection point which limits the accelerated growth in 
values, as presented in Figures 6-8.  
The combined models that use the features of the 
Richards model, i.e., the GR and GBR models, generally 
show good forecasting properties even if the minimum 
number of values is used in fitting, as presented in  
Figures 3-5.  
The Richards model accurately forecasts significant 
growth in the long run since it uses a flexible inflection 
point in order to adjust growth to the last existing training 
value, which can be seen for the GR and GBR models, as 
presented in Figures 6-8.  
For a sum-up of the presented results, the models that 
combine the features of the Richards model with the 
Gompertz model achieve good fitting to fast growth and 
show good forecast results in all presented examples. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Since fast changes in the telecommunications markets 
around the world impact services development and adoption 
trends, users’ demand for services features continuously 
changes. Advanced telecommunications services bring many 
advantages and added value to end users, so further growth 
in their adoption is inevitable. However, given the 
accelerated trends in services development, there is often not 
a lot of time to thoroughly consider users’ requests related to 
services offerings before launching services in the markets. 
So, one of the challenges operators currently cope with is the 
way which makes it possible to select the best services 
offerings based on accurate forecasts of changes in market 
conditions and to estimate the adoption trends of novel 
telecommunications 
solutions. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
presumption of usage patterns of novel services, it is possible 
to track usage patterns of similar services to create stronger 
business models. 
In this paper, the analytics of telecommunications 
services adoption processes are conducted for the gathered 
smaller sets of time series data, i.e., for the short-term 
modeling period. For the chosen case study examples, the 
analyses of services adoption trends are compared based on 
the accuracy of forecasted model parameters. An overview 
and comparison of the accuracy of the predictive modeling 
of broadband services adoption using common adoption 
growth models are given. Alongside standard models, 
additional combined models are used to present their 
predictive capabilities, and to compensate for some lacks of 
the commonly used adoption models (for instance, of a Bass 
model which is not suitable for modeling of services 
adoption in the initial services' introduction on the market). 
The presented results point to fast expected growth in the 
number of services users. 
Moreover, the presented results could be used to define 
adequate M2M/IoT services offerings. Based on the given 
results, the conclusion that can be taken as a guideline for the 
business modeling process is the fact that, despite their 
expected growth, and due to general risks related to slower 
demand for novel services, the M2M/IoT services can be 
offered within the packages combined with other types of 
services that already have their strong user base, which was 
presented as a good solution, considering the fast adoption 
growth of the package services.  
Business models can be modified accordingly to enhance 
broadband adoption, boost revenue, or limit user churn rates 
in order to improve overall market dynamics.
