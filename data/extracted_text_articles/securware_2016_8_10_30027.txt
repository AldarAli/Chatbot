Abstract— Currently, electromagnetic interference presents a 
major problem in the design of electronic and electrical 
equipment and systems. Equipment must be designed to ensure 
that its operation does not negatively affect itself or the devices 
in its vicinity. To demonstrate how this can be achieved, the 
paper aims at comparing the electromagnetic interference 
generated by analog and IP cameras where the measurement 
fulfils the strict requirements described in the ČSN EN 55022 
ed. 3 standard.

 INTRODUCTION 
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) continues to be a 
current research topic, especially in today’s world where the 
number of electronic items in homes and workplaces have 
significantly increased. EMC is defined as the ability of 
electronic or electrical devices or systems to work correctly 
in an environment where other sources of electromagnetic 
signals operate. Devices or systems, for example Closed 
circuit television (CCTV), can be perfectly reliable, but they 
are not usable if they cannot work in the electromagnetic 
environment. In the case of CCTVs, the system consists of 
multiple devices (security camera, monitoring unit, control 
unit, etc.) each of which generates a different frequency 
range. 
Electromagnetic compatibility [4] is typically classified 
into two categories namely electromagnetic susceptibility 
(EMS) [9] and electromagnetic interference (EMI) [3]. 
Electromagnetic interference is a process wherein the signal 
generated by the source of interference is transmitted via 
electromagnetic constraints to disturbed systems. EMI is 
concerned with identifying causes of disturbance. On the 
other hand, EMS is set up to remove the effects of EMI. In 
effect, EMS tasked to establish a limit in which the device 
can operate without failures, which potentially can adversely 
affect its function [1][9]. There is a limited number of 
research publications that deal with the interception of the 
video signal, and this is the reason why this contribution 
exists. 
The purpose of this research is to investigate whether the 
cameras generate a sufficient level of interference that could 
be eventually exploited to acquire the transmitted 
information. 
Sections 2 and 3 clarify what kinds of devices were used 
for the experiment. Section 4 defines the process of 
measurement followed by the configuration of an equipment 
under test during the analysis. In Section 6, the results are 
shown. The contribution of the paper is described in Section 
7. 
II. 
EQUIPMENT UNDER TEST 
CCTV is defined as an information technology 
equipment used to obtain, transmit, display and store video 
information. Basically, the camera captures the image of a 
scene. The information captured by a camera is transmitted 
via a transmission medium to a control unit (notebook, 
Network Video Recorder). Subsequently, the control unit 
displays the information in the display unit (monitor). 
Finally, the information can be stored (memory disks, cloud 
computing) with strict adherence to privacy and data 
protection laws governing the area of operation.  
For the purpose of this paper, a CCTV consists only of a 
control / display unit (notebook) sensing unit (IP and analog 
camera) and communication medium (twisted‑pair cable). 
Cameras intended for the test are IP camera VIVOTEK 
FD8136B F3 and analog camera HIKVISION DS-
2CE56C5T-AVPIR3. 
III. 
MEASURING EQUIPMENT 
The electromagnetic interference testing was performed 
in the laboratories of electromagnetic compatibility at the 
University of Tomas Bata in Zlin. The equipment under test 
(EUT) was placed in a semi-anechoic chamber equipped 
with pyramidal absorption materials. The absorbers eliminate 
internal reflections in the chamber, which could cause 
deformation of the results of the measuring. The 
bilogarithmic-periodic antenna, as shown in Figure 1, 
measures the equipment in the chamber and operates over a 
wide frequency range of 30MHz - 2GHz. Concurrently, 
another measuring equipment is placed outside the semi-
anechoic chamber. The testing of the security cameras was 
performed using the following techniques of measurement: 
 
CBL 6112 - bilogaritmic-periodic antenna, 
 
ESU8 (Rohde & Schwarz) - EMI test receiver 
which is operating in the range from 20 Hz to 8 
GHz, 
 
EMC32 (Rohde & Schwarz) - EMC measurement 
software,

OSP 130 (Rohde & Schwarz) - switch and control 
unit,

OSP 150 (Rohde & Schwarz) - switch and control 
unit. 
IV. 
PROCESS OF MEASUREMENT 
The CCTV used to perform the testing included an 
analog or IP camera. Most parts of the CCTV were moved 
outside the semi-anechoic chamber to avoid a large distortion 
of the electromagnetic interference of the cameras. Power 
over Ethernet (POE) adapter was placed inside and outside 
the semi-anechoic chamber, in order to determine its 
influence on the level of EMI. Similar tests under the same 
conditions were carried by the authors in another research 
publication [2]. 
The standard [3] requires a changing polarization 
(horizontal and vertical) and an antenna height (from 1m to 
4m - the possibilities of testing the workplace) during the 
measurement. A peak detector was used to measure the 
interference of the cameras. The peak detector helps to 
evaluate the maximum level of EMI for each frequency 
value. Contrariwise, the quasi-peak detector evaluates 
several samples of interference for each frequency value 
within the specified frequency range. In this case, the 
frequency range of the measurement is set from 30MHz to 
1GHz, which covers a working frequency of both cameras. 
The measurement process was conducted according to 
standard EN 55022 ed. 3 [3], which defines the procedure for 
measuring a test equipment. The entire process can be 
summarized in the following steps. 
A. Preparing the workplace 
Selection and preparation of measuring equipment 
suitable to perform the measurement were first carried out. 
These techniques of measurement involved the preparation 
of bilogaritmic-periodic antenna, switching and control unit, 
receiver and computer with the measuring software. 
B. Configuration of EUT 
To avoid distortion during the measuring process, the 
device to be tested has to be properly configured for the task. 
In this case, the tested security camera was placed in the 
semi-anechoic chamber. The entire configuration is shown in 
Figures 1 and 2. 
C. Wiring of EUT 
The test devices must be connected in accordance with 
the requirements set out in the proposal. The function must 
be thoroughly tested to ensure that the measurement results 
would be relevant.  
D. Configuration changes 
CCTV always consists only of one camera (IP or analog) 
to avoid interference between each of them; one camera was 
exchanged for another. Additionally, the location of the POE 
adapter was also placed outside the semi-anechoic chamber. 
E. Evaluation of results 
The final step involved the processing and evaluation of 
measurement results. 
V. 
DISPOSITION OF EUT 
The equipment must be connected to its functional state. 
Standard EN 55022 requires that the testing devices are 
placed on an insulated (non-metallic) support. Subsequently, 
all cables must be routed over the rear edge of the insulated 
surface (in this case, it is a wooden table), ie over the edge 
which is farthest from the measuring antenna. The standard 
also requires the distance between adjacent devices to be at 
least of 0.1m. All surplus parts of cables, which are longer 
than 0.4 m must be folded. 
The security camera was placed in the semi-anechoic 
chamber on a wooden table and the distance of measuring 
device from the antenna was 3m, according to standard 
recommendations. The IP and analog cameras were powered 
by the POE adapter. The effect of POE adapter on the overall 
level of interference was also researched during the testing. 
Therefore, several measurements were performed with POE 
adapter located inside and outside the chamber. The first 
variant is shown in Figures 1, 2.

The POE adapter as shown in Figure 2, is positioned so 
that the effects on the measurement are minimized.

height and polarization during the testing to determine the 
conditions of the EMI in different situations. The progress of 
radiation was stated in a horizontal and vertical polarization 
of antenna for each change of the position during the testing 
procedure. 
The x-axis always describes the frequency in Hz in the 
following figures and the y-axis shows the level of 
electromagnetic interference in dB/m. The frequency range is 
displayed from 30MHz to 1GHz and EMI range is displayed 
from 0 to EMI 80dBμV/m. The limit within which the level 
of EMI should not be exceeded is around the value of 
41dBµV/m. 
A. Analog camera 
The analog camera was connected as shown in Figure 1 
and Figure 2. The Hikvision camera was set in an active 
mode throughout the time of measurements. The camera 
transmitted data based on the condition of the scene into the 
laptop, which displayed it. This operation was carried out to 
verify the functionality of the device. The distance between 
the security camera and the antenna was 3m. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Waveform of EMI in horizontal and vertical polarization. 
The most interesting results were reported at the location 
with the antenna height of 2.5 m and that is why the results 
presented in this entire section were measured under the 
same conditions. The changing of the height of the antenna 
detected no significant differences. The blue color depicts 
the horizontal polarization of antenna whiles the red shows 
the vertical polarization. This marking is valid for the entire 
section. The differences between the max and min values are 
given below. The maximum and minimum values of 
electromagnetic interference generated by the analog security 
camera are as follows: 
a) Horizontal polarization of antenna 
 
maximum level: 45.987dBμV/m (91.711MHz), 
 
minimum level: 16.389dBμV/m (63.868MHz). 
b) Vertical polarization of antenna 
 
maximum level: 39.938dBμV/m (995.701MHz), 
 
minimum level: 16.726dBμV/m (74.645MHz). 
 
The peak which originated in the frequency point of 
91.711MHz is caused both by an unattached Bayonet Neill 
Concelman (BNC) connector (Composite Video Blanking 
and Sync (CVBS) output) and twisted pair which received a 
radio signal (outside the semi-anechoic chamber). In other 
words, nothing was connected to the BNC connector, which 
remained free. Connecting only one connector was done for 
testing purposes in order to compare EMI of the coaxial 
cables (CVBS output, HD video output). For comparison, 
Figure 4 describes the process of EMI with attached CVBS 
output, but the HD video output was not connected to the 
laptop. In both cases, the free BNC connector acts as an 
antenna; therefore, a fluctuation arose in the waveforms of 
the EMI. 
 
 
Figure 4.  EMI waveform of the analog camera with the CVBS output. 
In Figure 4, the waveform of interference with the 
connected CVBS output represented by green color is 
shown. The previous measurement (horizontal polarization) 
is also shown in the figure; however, it is largely hidden by 
the new green waveform. The measurement makes sense 
only for the horizontal polarization of the antenna because 
the camera did not record any significant changes in vertical 
polarization. The maximum and minimum values of the new 
measurement recorded are: 
 
maximum level: 47.005dBμV/m (91.711MHz), 
 
minimum level: 16.437dBμV/m (60.633MHz).

Figure 5 shows the state of the EMI analog cameras. The 
POE adapter which supplies energy to the security camera is 
located outside the measuring chamber. The differences 
which resulted during the comparison of waveforms with the 
adapter (Figure 3), and without the adapter (Figure 5) are 
immediately visible. Figure 5 displays an increase of 
interference in the frequency range from 30 to 70MHz in the 
vertical polarization, and in the range from 90 to 115MHz in 
horizontal polarization. The maximum and minimum values 
for horizontal and vertical polarizations were the following: 
c) Horizontal polarization of antenna 
 
maximum level: 58.242dBµV/m (91.711MHz), 
 
minimum level: 16.873dBµV/m (60.391MHz). 
d) Vertical polarization of antenna 
 
maximum level: 41.767dBµV/m (992.719MHz), 
 
minimum level: 16.548dBµV/m (72.151MHz). 
B. IP camera 
The measurement procedure is the same as with the 
analog camera. 
 
 
Figure 6.  Waveform of EMI. 
Figure 6 describes the course of electromagnetic 
interference generated by IP cameras, where the height of the 
antenna is set at 2.5m. The color-marking of waveforms is 
the same as in the previous cases. The undesirable influence 
of radio interference is especially visible in the frequency 
range from 50 to 250MHz. Radio frequencies were 
transmitted via unshielded twisted-pair cable. The influence 
of interference is mainly evident in the blue course of the 
measurement. This case was observed in analog cameras and 
similar waveforms can be expected in the following 
measurements.  
a) Horizontal polarization of antenna 
 
maximum level: 57.539dBμV/m (91.711MHz), 
 
minimum level: 17.821dBμV/m (51.466MHz). 
b) Vertical polarization of antenna 
 
maximum level: 32.444dBμV/m (91.711MHz), 
 
minimum level: 16.772dBμV/m (78.392MHz). 
 
 
Figure 7.  Waveform of EMI with POE adapter outside of semi-anechoic 
chamber. 
Figure 7 compares the state of EMI of IP cameras with 
POE adapter outside of the semi-anechoic chamber. 
According to the figure, it is evident that changes are mainly 
in the blue (horizontal) waveform. The change of height of 
the antenna is mainly seen in the maximum values of EMI. 
This fact was ascertained by comparing the results of several 
measurements. The shape of the curve remains almost the 
same and the values of EMI are as follows: 
c) Horizontal polarization of antenna 
 
maximum level: 57.132dBμV/m (91.711MHz), 
 
minimum level: 17.552dBμV/m (67.275MHz). 
d) Vertical polarization of antenna 
 
maximum level: 40.880dBμV/m (980.884MHz), 
 
minimum level: 16.772dBμV/m (78.392MHz). 
C. Electromagnetic background 
 
 
Figure 8.  Electromagnetic background. 
As seen in Figure 8, the electromagnetic background 
depicts the fluctuations in the frequency range from 80 to 
100MHz, which must affect the resulting value of EMI 
obtained in this frequency band during the measuring. 
Interference in this band corresponds to radio waves. This 
fact must be taken into account in the analysis.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The paper described the state of electromagnetic 
interference generated by IP and analog cameras. It was 
observed that measurement is influenced by radio signals, 
which are commonly encountered in each environment. This 
unwanted radio interference had a significant impact on the 
results of the measurement because interference exceeded 
the desired limit of 41dBμV/m set in the standard CSN EN 
55022 ed.3. This problem can be eliminated by using another 
transmission medium (fiber optic cable, shielded twisted 
pair). The use of an analog camera is better able to handle 
the disturbance which also is as shown in the results of the 
measurements. The reason may be a converter that converts 
digital information into analog. Conversely, IP camera 
generates higher interference in the larger frequency range 
(about 80 to 250MHz), and this fact may be exploited to 
acquire the transmitted information. 
To ensure the required level of electromagnetic 
interference, it is necessary to pay attention to all parts of the 
system (CCTV). This is because each weakness in the 
system can have a congruent effect on the level of 
interference generated by the system or more precisely its 
parts. 
The main purpose of this paper was to prepare a basis for 
further research aimed at obtaining information via 
electromagnetic radiation. As shown in this investigation, 
cameras provide a sufficient amount of data that can be 
analyzed in detail. The results suggest that further research 
should be focused on the use of IP cameras which produce 
more unwanted information.
