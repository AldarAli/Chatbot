Abstract-The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted 
in many users actively working and learning from their homes 
with long hours of sitting and screen time. Health and wellness 
are the two concepts that require digital users to be aware of 
and self-managed towards social, physical, emotional, and 
spiritual well-being. There are multitude of digital interactions 
available now. Due to movement controls, there are various 
ideas and opportunities that have surfaced for users to interact 
for health and wellness, especially on using applications for 
contact tracing and vaccination management. This paper 
reviewed literature and survey reports on two user groups, 
namely the digital talents who serve the digital industries and 
youth gamers who are attending school online. Their digital 
interaction experiences with work-life balance were revealed 
and discussed. The paper ends by proposing how wellness 
concepts can be integrated into digital interactions for 
maintaining a balance of life and its quality.   
 
Keywords- Health and wellness; digital interaction; digital game; 
digital talents; youth. 
 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Health and well-being are vital in our daily lives, and they 
are now more important than ever following the global 
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of the 
new virus variants of COVID-19, and the surge in daily 
positive COVID-19 cases in Malaysia have caused most 
people to stay at home due to their fear of contracting it. This 
abrupt shift in lifestyle has caused a big impact to an 
individual’s physical and mental wellness. The awareness of 
health and wellness should be of paramount importance.  
The new definition of health by [1] as "the ability to adapt 
and self-manage in the face of social, physical, and emotional 
challenges" (p. 1) is highly applicable in this paper. 
Meanwhile, the concept of wellness is multi-dimensional that 
encompasses our lifestyle, mental health or mental wellness, 
and spiritual well-being [2]. Wellness is considered as “an 
active process through which people become aware of, and 
make choices toward, a more successful existence” [3]. Both 
health and wellness concepts are the foundation of the current 
discussions of heavy and active digital users on how they can 
choose their lifestyle or type of activities in performing their  
interaction with the digital world or virtual spaces. This paper 
aims to explore the current situations of two heavy user 
groups namely, the digital talents and the youth gamers, of 
their digital interaction experience while working/studying 
from homes.  
In this paper, Section II states the objectives and the 
research questions. Section III presents a framework of 
eHealth and some examples of eHealth apps or interaction 
platforms. Section IV highlights theories related to adopting 
new technology or desire in taking actions for better health. 
Sections V, VI and VII present the review methods of the 
case studies of two user groups of digital interaction. Section 
VIII discusses the key findings by integrating the wellness 
concept. The last section concludes the review and provides 
future research work in this area.   
II. 
OBJECTIVES AND THE RESEARCH 
QUESTIONS 
Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the digital talents and 
the youth gamers have been working or schooling from home 
with flexible working arrangements.  
 The main objective is to investigate how these two types 
of users, namely digital talents, and youth gamers, are coping 
in their current home-based environments. These research 
questions are asked to meet the objective of this paper: 1) To 
what extent do digital talents perform their work-life balance 
while working from home? 2) To what extent do youth 
gamers perform their daily and social life balance while 
studying from home? 
  
III. 
INTERACTING FOR HEALTH AND 
WELLNESS 
The primary goal of digital interaction for health can be 
explained through the eHealth concept. eHealth, telehealth, 
and digital health are proposed to be an important agenda for 
the development and innovation in the health system for all 
countries. The current healthcare system is also facing 
challenges due to restrictions of movement and patients' fear 
of stepping out from their homes. Healthcare services have 
been reduced, with non-core clinical services temporarily 
ceased, including the postponement or limitations of medical 
appointments via face-to-face consultations [33]. This 
situation necessitates the establishment of an efficient 
strategy for delivering healthcare while maintaining service 
quality. With the emergence of digital health / eHealth, 
40

GLOBAL HEALTH 2021 : The Tenth International Conference on Global Health Challenges

 
 
patients and healthcare providers can now interact digitally 
and communicate virtually; patients can continue to receive 
healthcare-related support without having to travel by 
utilizing various communication technologies such as 
teleconsultation, which is also cost-effective [33]. 
eHealth functions by integrating mobile technologies that 
serve as a great tool to promote health and wellness. Health-
related mobile apps, such as fitness apps, diet tracker apps, 
and mindfulness/relaxation apps are widely available and can 
be used by anyone, anywhere and anytime. In general, 
eHealth is a useful tool for bridging the gap in these difficult 
times caused by the pandemic, by offering venues for 
everyone to engage in digital contacts, virtual healthcare, and 
self-health management. Various communication tools are 
being applied to conduct virtual fitness classes and act as a 
platform for digital interactions with other users which also 
serves as a great source of motivation. Although mobile and 
online health tools that can be used to manage health are 
widely available, the interest in using these interventions is 
still low. There is a higher preference for face-to-face 
consultations over online programs for stress management 
purposes [4]. eHealth applied in digital interactions for health 
purposes is more acceptable by potential users who were 
among the digital workers [5]. They felt more connected to 
have someone to talk to regarding health topics. Because of 
these findings, digital interactions are an important feature to 
be integrated into any digital health / eHealth interventions to 
ensure higher acceptance by users.  
According to [6], eHealth consists of three dominant 
domains which are, health in our hands, interacting for health 
and data enabling health (Refer to Figure 1, the three circles); 
any eHealth initiatives with the application of three domains 
in combination (Refer to Figure 1, Star area) is believed to be 
the most impactful one. Figure 1 also shows various 
examples of eHealth applications explained in the text and 
visually. Digital interactions aided by digital health/eHealth 
tools are the way forward in providing better solutions to 
users / patients in healthcare during this unprecedented 
pandemic time. 
 
Figure 1. Overview of three domains of eHealth [6]. 
 
A. MySejahtera – Malaysia’s Contact Tracing App for 
Mitigating the Pandemic Outbreak 
The Government of Malaysia has developed MySejahtera 
in 2020 (Refer to Figure 2). “It is a smartphone application 
that was created to aid in the monitoring of the COVID-19 
outbreak in the country by allowing users to estimate their 
COVID-19 risk. This software also gives the Ministry of 
Health (MOH) the information it needs to plan for prompt 
and effective countermeasures.” [7]. The MySejahtera 
website listed the following functions of the app: “... it assists 
the Government in managing and mitigating the COVID-19 
outbreak; help users in monitoring their health throughout the 
COVID-19 outbreak; assist users in getting treatment if they 
are infected with COVID-19; locate nearest hospitals and 
clinics for COVID-19 screening and treatment”.  
The app has a check-in function for users to register point 
of entry into any business premises, while the data collected 
is to ease the identification of any individual who had casual 
contact with a positive COVID-19 patient within the same 
premise; data such as positive COVID-19 cases are also 
collected and analysed into useful information to identify 
COVID-19 hotspot locations, so that people may avoid going 
to that location; it has virtual health advisory feature to 
provide health-related support such as virtual consultation 
with a health practitioner. The MySejahtera app also 
integrates an online clinic appointment system in Malaysia 
such as BookDoc [7] and Encoremed [7] to allow 
appointment bookings with clinics. 
Generally, the MySejahtera app incorporates all three 
domains of eHealth (Figure 1), and it has been a very 
effective eHealth tool to assist the Malaysian government in 
handling the pandemic situation and the national vaccination 
programme. Its usage is widespread and it has become an 
essential app for all those who reside in Malaysia.

combat COVID-19.   
B. Other forms of lifestyle applications and interactions 
Exergame applications, such as Zwift Cycling [41], 
provide services that can change the future of our lifestyle. 
These will be the new way of digital interactions for 
promoting healthy lifestyles. Exergames can be performed at 
home and get connected with the community nearby or at the 
global stage. Another lifestyle application is a virtual run 
programme. For example, E-Bee Virtual Run programme 
was organized at Multimedia University (MMU), Cyberjaya, 
Malaysia [38]. Alumni from MMU and the public 
participated in virtual run. There were badges and goody bags 
provided upon meeting the minimum requirement of the race 
via some selected running apps and after the participant 
posted screenshots as evidence of completion. These kinds of 
virtual race games give space and opportunity for users to 
enjoy a healthy social life during the pandemic time.  
IV. 
THEORIES OF ADAPTING DIGITAL 
INTERACTION TOOLS 
eHealth innovations tend to diffuse relatively slow. The 
uptake was modest despite the effectiveness of eHealth 
interventions [4][8][9]. The understanding of the uptake 
facilitation of eHealth is very limited, and not many studies 
focus on the acceptability of eHealth consumers [4][10]. Low 
acceptability of eHealth is a key barrier to the diffusion of 
eHealth innovation [8]. Hence some understanding of the 
technology acceptance or diffusion theories are discussed in 
the following section.  
A. Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 
(UTAUT) 
 
UTAUT is a well-known and commonly utilized theory 
to study technology acceptance. UTAUT has been adopted 
by previous research to examine the acceptance of eHealth, 
and to identify key barriers to the acceptance of eHealth.  
Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence 
and facilitating conditions are four constructs proposed by 
UTAUT as direct predictors of users' propensity to use 
technology. Performance expectancy is described as “the 
degree to which an individual believes that adopting the 
system will assist him or her in improving job performance”. 
Effort expectancy is described as “the degree of ease of usage 
of the system”. Social influence is described as “the degree 
to which an individual perceives that important other believe 
he or she should use the new system”. Facilitating conditions 
is described as “the degree to which an individual believes 
that an organizational and technical infrastructure exists to 
support the use of the system” [9]. Overall, UTAUT provides 
a deeper understanding of the key facilitating and impeding 
factors of technology acceptance and usage, which is useful for 
planning the adoption of technology for health purposes. 
B. Behavioural intentions to adopt innovations  
“The Health Belief Model (HBM) was proposed through 
social, psychological, and behavioural theories to better 
understand actions or behaviours related to health” [10]. This 
theory mentioned that any health-related actions will be taken 
by individuals if they perceived the activities that could 
prevent illness or risk to their health. Perceived vulnerability 
to a negative health condition, perceived severity of a 
prospective negative health condition, perceived advantages 
of a specific preventive action on health, and perceived 
barriers that hinder engagement in a preventive health action 
make up the core foundation of the health belief of a person. 
According to this theory, an individual will engage in 
preventive health behaviour based on their motivation, which 
is impacted by overcoming perceived hazards and believing 
that positive outcomes may be achieved at a reasonable cost 
by doing some actions or measures [9][10]. Protection 
Motivation Theory (PMT) also establishes perceived severity 
and vulnerability of health issues as factors that influence 
individual actions on preventive interventions and health 
promotion. Perceived stress on related harm contributes to the 
intentions to seek health-related support to reduce the harm 
[4]. Both theories can be used to gain a deeper understanding 
of the acceptance factor of any health intervention by 
identifying the intrinsic motivation and barriers that influence 
an individual's decision to participate in a specific activity. 
This can help future developers to identify the needs of users 
and deliver interventions that are credible, safe, and well-
accepted by most users. One example to explain using these 
theories is the recent adoption of MySejahtera app, which is 
currently highly and widely used in the country. The data of 
December 2020 showed “24.5 million users with up to 30,000 
42

GLOBAL HEALTH 2021 : The Tenth International Conference on Global Health Challenges

 
 
daily downloads despite misconceptions” on the use of the 
app for the public and this number is 70% of the population 
of the country [40]. HBM and PMT’s conceptions on the 
perceived severity and vulnerability of COVID-19 health 
implications to all adults have influenced a strong reaction 
and beliefs of people to use it. Moreover, the concepts from 
UTAUT are relevant in explaining the adoptions of 
MySejahtera app, due to the factors such as Performance 
expectancy (usefulness), effort expectancy (ease of use), 
social influence and facilitating conditions (enforcement 
conditions by the government, surrounding environment of 
the community or society) will have a significant impact on 
users' acceptance and use of the health management app.   
V. 
METHODOLOGY 
 Digital lifestyles and interaction have had a significant 
impact on two groups of users: 1) digital talents and 2) youth 
gamers. Hence, the focus groups are targeted to these two 
user groups.  Their daily tasks are affected and profoundly 
influenced by how they work and study, while still staying 
digitally connected to the world. 
The current study reviews existing documents reported in 
the literature, which include media reports, to explore the 
digital lifestyle of digital talents and youth gamers.  The steps 
taken were to identify survey reports or official publications. 
Keywords used were digital talents, digital industry, or digital 
workers. As for the second user group, the keyword searched 
were gamers, youth, young gamers. All these were 
concurrently searched with the main keywords, i.e., COVID-
19 or pandemic, work, or study from home. These articles 
were reviewed by extracting the survey findings and key 
observations in this paper. 
VI. 
CASE STUDY 1:  DIGITAL TALENTS AND 
THEIR WORK-LIFE BALANCE 
A. Digital Talents:  To what extent do they perform their 
work-life balance while working from home? 
This section summarizes how digital talents are playing 
their roles in digital industries. Digital talents are those who 
have the technical skills and soft skills that serve digital 
industries.  
B. Digital talents drive the industries in need of technical 
and soft skills 
According to [39], digital industries are related to work 
areas in Software development, Creative Multimedia, 
Enterprise Resource Planning, Big Data & Analytics, e-
Commerce, Networking and Network Security, Artificial 
Intelligence, Automation, IoT, telecommunications, and 
others. The skilled workers in these industries are called 
digital talents who are the assets for the digital industry. 
Digital talents play a ‘frontliner’ role for digital innovations, 
particularly for the healthcare system. Industries that provide 
telehealth and digital health solutions have been in great 
demand [11]. [11] proposed that “monitoring, detection, 
prevention, and mitigation of the impact of COVID-19 could 
be aided by the use of four interconnected digital 
technologies: IoT, big-data analytics, AI, and blockchain”.  
A survey was reported in response to the COVID-19 
situation by [12] of 266 digital workers (workforce) recruited 
from different companies. Sixty per cent (60%) of the 
company expressed the need for training in various digital 
skills such as digital marketing (74 out of 179 respondents), 
skills on office automation / remote working skills, digital 
productivity tools and technical skills. Skills required in 
digital industries are constantly changed in reaction to the 
demand of the industry.  
Apart from the above technical skills, talents with soft 
skills are also high in demand. The World Economic Forum 
(2020) reported that the top three soft skills for Malaysia are 
1) emotional intelligence (EQ), 2) creativity, originality, 
initiative, and 3) skills in analytical thinking and innovation. 
According to [13], EQ is a skill that requires a sense of self, 
social awareness, a good attitude, emotional self-control, and 
a focus on people relationships and how to manage the 
relationships including with themselves. 
 
C. Work From Home (WFH)  
The future of jobs is emerging and requires timely 
delivery from anywhere and anytime. The survey conducted 
by [12] reported many digital workforces had shifted to Work 
From Home (WFH) through technology and digital platforms 
(Figure 3). Apart from that, many digital workforce 
companies are concerned about their salary payment and cash 
flow due to the pandemic and movement control orders in 
Malaysia. They are also concerned about adapting to how to 
WFH effectively such as the need to pay attention to the 
element of wellness, health, and productivity.  
 
Figure 3. Digital Workforce’s immediate concern by talents in COVID-19 
situation [12].

GLOBAL HEALTH 2021 : The Tenth International Conference on Global Health Challenges

 
 
The pandemic has also forced the need for social 
distancing and remote working at a global scale [12][14]. Out 
of 55% of workers who were surveyed by PwC, a 
combination of face-to-face and remote work is preferable, 
with 28% preferring largely virtual work with some face-to-
face interaction. 
 
D. WFH:  A precursor of burnout? 
The trend of the digital industry essentially focuses on 
digital collaboration, along with the virtual presence and clear 
communication, especially in the gig economy and future of 
work for digital industries. According to a job expert, the 
Employee Provident Fund’s CEO, Alizakri Alias [15] 
emphasized that the nation requires digital talents who are 
agile, flexible, and adaptable [15]. Multitasking is also a 
common working style for digital talents. Working digitally 
from home tends to involve long sitting hours and long screen 
time. Before COVID-19, Malaysian digital workers were 
also living a sedentary lifestyle with limited time to spend for 
more physical activities and a lack of knowledge on health 
priorities [41]. A study by [17] reported a high percentage 
(50% of 105 workers) who experienced high stress and 
pressure in terms of WFH during movement control orders. 
Cities in ASEAN like Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, and 
Singapore respectively were ranked at the bottom 10 out of 
50 cities of the 2020 Work-Life-Balance Index [18]. 
Moreover, the statistics also depict that generally Malaysian 
are not so healthy as there are high cases of adults in Malaysia 
who are overweight or obese [16]. In Malaysia, the incidence 
of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) is also very high. 
The incidence of diabetes among adults in Malaysia is one in 
five, hypertension is three in 10, and high cholesterol is four 
in 10 [16]. 
 COVID-19 has made most workers, especially digital 
workers who performs WFH, struggle to draw the line 
between work and life at home [18]. According to the same 
report, employees, especially digital talents, easily slip into 
an imbalance of ‘working’ and ‘home’ hours. People are 
unable to disconnect [19], as there is an unclear boundary 
between the two environments - workspace time and personal 
space-time. Workers may overwork and exceed 48 hours per 
week. At times, they experience loneliness due to having little 
interactions with others.  
A survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) 
has reported that only 28% of their employees can detach 
from work outside of working hours, and only 25% believe 
their boss helps them manage stress and focus on mental and 
emotional well-being. Only 22% of employees are 
encouraged to take brief breaks during the workday [19]. In 
some research, employees stated that they feel pressured to 
be "always-on" [14].  
With long working hours, talents may develop burnout 
symptoms. The three things that define burnout are being 
exhausted, cynical, and discouraged [20]. Pandemic burnout 
is also the most talked about topic in the media and research. 
Intervention and evaluation research for alleviating or 
preventing burnout continue to be scarce in the literature [20].  
Burnout is not caused by mental illness; it is caused by 
problems in an employee’s relationship with the workplace 
[21]. By spreading the awareness of unclear work and 
personal time boundaries and encouraging time off , digital 
talents can upskill or re-skill to strengthen their 
organizational resilience and agility.  A more empathetic 
employer with health-promoting workplaces is much needed. 
Hopefully, strategies can be implemented such as training 
and awareness campaigns about burnout issues and 
promoting wellness in digital working space by introducing 
many thriving and resilience concepts at workplace in 
collective manners. There are also some discussions at the 
global and local level on better policies and working terms 
for protecting the rights and well-being of digital workers. 
 
VII. 
CASE STUDY 2: YOUTH GAMERS AND 
THEIR PLAY AT HOME  
A. Youth gamers: To what extent do youth gamers perform 
their daily and social life balance while studying from 
home?  
Countries around the world have instituted various forms 
of lockdowns to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In 2020, this action has led to a significant increase in the 
amount of time spent on video gaming as a form of 
entertainment by 39% globally [22]. 
B. The rise of online gaming - The case of Roblox  
Roblox is a free online gaming platform where gamers 
can build and share their creations [23]. Gamers create 
avatars of themselves and interact with like-minded others 
from around the globe by sharing experiences in their virtual 
worlds through the built-in chat function. Roblox is the most 
popular game among 5- to 12-year-olds in the US, and as of 
the first quarter of 2021, is one of the highest played games 
in the world due to the pandemic. There are on average 42.1 
million daily active users of Roblox worldwide [24].  
C. Gaming trends among adolescent youth gamers 
According to a survey conducted by gaming accessories 
firm HyperX, playing video games was the primary method 
of socializing with friends among 13- to 18-year-olds with 
more than half doing so. 77% of their parents believed that 
gaming during the lockdown had helped with their child’s 
mental health as they could stay in touch with their friends 
[34]. In another survey conducted by HyperX, 55% of 13- to 
18-year-olds thought that gaming should be incorporated into 
their school curriculums as they believed that gaming was a 
path to a future career, which was also supported by 40% of 
the parents surveyed [35].  
Although these statistics are viewed very positively for 
the online gaming industry, nevertheless, are there any effects 
44

GLOBAL HEALTH 2021 : The Tenth International Conference on Global Health Challenges

 
 
or consequences of such an increase in gaming, particularly 
on youth gamers? 
D. Is Internet gaming addiction a disorder? 
In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) included 
gaming disorder in the 11th Revision of the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) [25]. Video gaming had 
already been recognized as a disorder in South Korea and 
China by then. Subsequent treatment programs had been 
established [26]. To meet the criteria for diagnosis, the 
behaviour pattern must be of “sufficient severity to result in 
significant 
impairment 
in 
personal, 
family, 
social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of 
functioning” and would have been evident for at least 12 
months [25]. 
In contrast, the American Psychiatric Association's 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM-5) took the position that there was insufficient 
evidence to determine if Internet gaming was a disorder but 
did recommend further research [27].  
 
E. Why have youth gamers embraced Internet gaming 
during the pandemic? 
Despite these differing perspectives, online gaming has 
increased significantly, hence it is important to explore the 
reasons for this increase and the associated experiences 
through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic. [28] conducted 
an online survey (N = 781) that focused on gameplay habits 
and effects on players’ well-being. It must be noted though 
that the data was derived from those who were 16 years of 
age and older with 47.4% of respondents falling into the 16–
24 age range. Nevertheless, the findings are important to gain 
an insight into the understanding of youth gamers behaviour 
during the pandemic. They found that 71% of respondents 
had increased the amount of time spent playing games, while 
58% of respondents reported that playing games had 
positively impacted their well-being by providing cognitive 
stimulation and opportunities to socialize, along with 
reducing anxiety and stress. 
F. The effects of video gaming on well-being  
[28] explained how video gaming on personal computers, 
gaming consoles and smartphones had affected the well-
being of gamers. A central theme across their research 
findings was related to escaping from reality. Respondents 
played video games to cope with and even escape from the 
realities of the pandemic. By escaping into an alternate reality 
of the virtual world, respondents could shift their attention 
away from their current situation.  
There were also key elements mentioned about how 
gaming had positively impacted their mental health. The data 
included many references to how gameplay improved their 
mood and reduced their anxiety which was likely due to 
experiencing flow [29], whereby gamers find optimal 
experiences balancing the challenges in the game with their 
need for achievement. The flow experience was also 
associated with cognitive stimulation as an effective method 
to combat boredom during the lockdown. 
Agency, or having a feeling of control within the game 
environment was also another important theme. Gamers 
could experience feelings of competence and achievement, as 
well as a sense of purpose as the games were found to address 
such basic needs that could not be satisfied under pandemic 
lockdowns. This agency was also found when the gamers 
specifically chose more relaxing type games that acted as 
stress relievers to calm down or de-stress. 
The last two themes of normalization and socialization are 
particularly significant. Respondents shared that playing 
video games provided them with a sense of continuity and 
normality in their lives, as well as providing them with an 
enjoyable experience too. This sense of normality is 
compounded by the added component of socialization, which 
has helped them keep in touch with friends. Playing online 
multiplayer games with friends kept respondents from feeling 
isolated at home which helps to combat loneliness and 
isolation. The gamers also felt connected to a community to 
whom they could talk to. Some respondents also shared that 
their family cohesion was also enhanced as playing online 
games with family improved family relationships. This study 
demonstrated that playing online games managed to provide 
both online as well as offline social support, thereby 
providing positive effects, particularly in the uncertainty of 
continued lockdowns. 
 
 
 
G. What are the effects of gaming on academic 
performance?  
Playing games can be engaging with some advantages on 
users’ well-being and collectively among the virtual team of 
gamers or families. The psychological impact of playing 
games can be obvious to youth gamers but at times 
unmanaged by them. A study conducted in China involved 
almost 10,000 students (average age 13.5 years old) were 
surveyed on their recreational use of the Internet, social 
media or on playing video games. The researchers found that 
students who spent more than an hour each day on these 
activities during the school week scored significantly lower 
grades [35]. The excessive technology use was a distraction 
from learning activities and recommended that students 
spend no more than an hour or four hours daily on school 
days and weekends respectively [35]. This finding suggests 
that incorporating time limits on youth’s usage of interactive 
technology is necessary to maintain a balance between online 
and offline worlds, such as on their studies or learning 
activities.

VIII. 
DISCUSSION  
Health is cultivation via a healthy lifestyle; it is not an 
outcome through medication or supplements.  Generally, 
studies showed a high percentage of high stress and pressure 
among those who WFH [17].   
 
A. Integration of wellness in the virtual and physical 
workplace for digital talents 
One can practice healthy lifestyles while being 
“immersed” in the digital interaction world for work, social 
connection, play and learn. The study of a healthy 
environment for work, be it physical or virtual space, is an 
emerging topic of discussion. Many scholars remind the 
public that a healthy lifestyle is vital for digital workers or 
youth gamers. However, are they aware of the principle of 
balance of work arrangement, play and personal life while 
WFH? All these are related to the wellness concept, which 
can be described as multi-dimensional in choosing a better 
lifestyle, social relationships, mental & emotional wellness, 
and spiritual well-being [2][3].  
[30] has provided some key guides of beating burnout 
among digital workers by identifying the priority of tasks, 
being able to communicate with family effectively at home, 
and being able to set better boundaries and mindset (attitude) 
between work and personal life. [30] stresses about collective 
well-being by organizing a workplace team to manage better 
their “collective time” or arrangement for connectivity and 
collaborations.  
 
B. The well-being of youth gamers  
       There are some guides for youth gamers when dealing 
with 
their 
digital 
interactions, 
especially 
on 
time 
management. Their awareness of moderation in spending 
time on games and the selection of the type of games and 
activities are crucial. The following are some other guides to 
ensure safety and privacy for the young users:   
 
(1) Never share any of their personal information online, even 
with friends. This includes passwords, telling people where 
they live, or how old they are [31]. Be aware of how to deal 
with online issues by showing them how to report and mute 
others. It is also vital to keep the channels of communication 
open and encourage them to talk to older adults such as their 
parents if they see something that makes them uncomfortable 
[31].  
 
(2) Most websites or gaming platforms have Parental 
Controls features. Parents can and should customize the 
safety and privacy settings. This entails turning off the chat 
function entirely or limiting interactions to only friends, as 
well as using the most restrictive contact settings to prevent 
anyone from reaching them [32]. 
 
(3) Parents need to control in-game purchases by ensuring 
that any credit cards are password-protected in the computer 
systems so that no unanticipated purchases are made. Many 
games work on the freemium model whereby they are free to 
play but gamers are incentivized to make purchases in the 
game with real money to customize their avatar or gain 
competitive advantages within the game [32]. 
 
C. eHealth interaction and acceptance 
The beginning of the paper, as presented in [6], has 
highlighted how digital interactions have been directly 
involved with health and wellness. The second domain, 
“Interacting for health” has higher acceptability by digital 
talents [5]. The use of digital interaction for wellness is 
inevitable during a pandemic. However, its adoption is also 
heavily influenced by individuals’ perceptions and beliefs. 
According to HBM, an individual's desire to engage in a 
specific health-related action is heavily influenced by their 
desire to avoid illness and their perception of benefits.  
According to UTAUT, the acceptance and use of technology 
are heavily influenced by perceptions of usefulness, ease of 
use, surrounding and facilitating conditions.   
IX. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We cannot deny that the digital virtual worlds have 
‘invaded’ our living spaces in the cognitive, social, and 
affective domains. Some studies have reported more users 
experienced burnout or always “on” from working at home. 
Life has not been easy for many people during pandemic 
time. Hence, the discussions of integrating wellness concept 
in digital interaction at homes is important. The paper 
presents the challenges and opportunities for the future of 
digital adoption for health in works at home settings.  
The setting of boundaries and the ability to manage EQ 
are some crucial steps to overcome the burnout issue at work. 
For youth gamers, the playtime should be in moderation.  
Addiction or long hour gaming is still a phenomenon that 
should be controlled through self-management from the 
youth and guidance from the adults. Some organizations or 
non-governmental organizations are promoting telehealth or 
therapy for those who need help from homes. There should 
be more discussions on how to promote positive mindset and 
interaction 
through 
improved 
communications 
and 
“collective wellness” through digital interactions. Future 
research will be exploring wellness concept for each of the 
user groups, especially on the young minors.  The research 
can be expanded to include students who are studying at 
home; what are the changes and challenges faced by them? 
Another question asked would be on the factors that motivate 
or deter user groups from using certain technologies for their 
health benefits.
