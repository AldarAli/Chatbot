Abstract - Non-linear video is an approach, which makes video 
content an interactive experience. Non-linear video gives the 
viewer the opportunity to interact with objects that are part of 
the video and access supplemental information. On demand, 
multimedia content is linked with related information. 
Interactive, time independent navigation opens a new ways to 
experience video content. This paper shows how such an 
system could be built upon IPTV and web technology in a cross 
platform manner.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Internet Protocol (IP) based media services, such as 
Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) [1], are different from 
conventional TV technology. Via IPTV, television content 
will be viewed and delivered through technologies used for 
computer networks. This opens to a wide range of new 
media services and asks for innovative advertisements and 
content patterns to satisfy the ever increasing demand of the 
advertisement industry as well as content production for 
predefined interfaces to place product and content related 
information and advertisements in close vicinity to particular 
objects within the video. 
Advertisements in the form of pre-rolls, post-rolls, and 
overlays are becoming increasingly ineffective as more and 
more consumers decide to skip these commercials due to the 
unimportance of the offered information and low individual 
involvement and interest in the offered product. This fact is 
boosted by the technological and economic evolutions in 
digital Television (TV) and media business areas. There is a 
strong need for new marketing strategies, innovative 
advertisements and finally a need for new kinds of 
interactive video content to fit these requirements [2]. 
Non-linear video concerns the delivery of personalized 
interactive value added information and related videos to 
end-users. Such an interactive item could be a video clip that 
can be paused at any time. Thus the introduced technology 
enables customers to decide when and which related 
information, interactive items and advertisements are 
displayed. In those environments customers can pause each 
video content at any time. 
Once paused, several objects in that current scene are 
automatically highlighted. Each highlighted object displays 
additional information, such as a detailed description and 
links to other objects or related content, when clicked. The 
displayed objects, descriptions and links are personalized 
based on previously learnt end-user profiles. The Non-linear 
video system identifies which objects are relevant to a 
particular customer based on his or her current situation and 
then only displays these objects for a personalized and 
interactive experience. Figure 1 shows, how different 
elements, such as a piece of content, a description of the 
object shown there, and content recommendations are linked 
to create a new interactive content experience. 
II. 
OVERVIEW 
Non-linear video offers the platform for realizing interactive 
and personalized multimedia content. Videos are linked to 
related 
information 
thus 
making 
time 
independent 
navigation possible. The linear character of traditional 
moving pictures and video formats are enhanced with non-
linear video towards multiple ways of interaction. The user 
can navigate at any time through objects, which are 
contained in the video content such as TV programs and 
films. As soon as the viewer clicks on an object that 
interests them, supplemental interactive information or 
video is displayed. This can be any multimedia content 
(image, text, animation, video, pdf), websites, or alternative 
communication methods such as telephone, chat, email as

well as Web 2.0, community and social media services, 
which can be shown on a time basis or in subject to the user. 
Non-linear video supplements the previous available 
technology of pre and post rolls, commercial breaks, 
product placement, and overlays. Videos become clickable 
using links to content and additional information which are 
brought up parallel to the existing moving pictures. 
Metadata describe the objects in the video as well as 
possible ways to interact with it. 
III. 
RELATED WORK 
As the history of the last ten years and recent developments 
on interactive multimedia content and related TV or Web-
based solutions have descriptive shown, interactive video 
content pines for easer solutions. Whether previous systems 
[3] seem to provide all technical issues and apparently fulfill 
all 
requirements 
for 
those 
interactive 
multimedia 
experiences, in fact the bulk of them disappear due to lack 
of usability. This includes both, the user side to experience 
value added services and real interactivity, and the service 
providers modality to serve such interactive content offers. 
Those solutions were mostly based on large and complex 
metadata descriptions as MPEG7 [4], related interactive TV 
technologies as MHP [5] or more theoretical approaches on 
top of MPEG4 [6] video scene and object descriptions. 
Unfortunately these approaches do not affect any products 
and services on the media market till now. In contrast to the 
depicted history of interactive video, the envisaged Non-
linear video solution tackles a more applicable and 
practicable route to enable interactive content based on a 
media platform to serve videos, and the related metadata to 
provide object descriptions and the associated information 
as well. 
The realization of the above-mentioned vision in section I 
require the exploitation of a number of ideas, which have 
been developed in different technology domains. Ideas 
taken from interactive and non-linear video utilization build 
the basis for the definition of the new interactive content 
features as described above. Results taken from previous 
projects and developments, which dealt with the realization 
of a recommendation system [7], are used to provide the 
required personalization features. A central component of 
the described platform is the Interactive Video Player that 
utilizes results from different technology domains, such as 
recommendations, next-generation video platforms [8] as 
well as standardized IPTV infrastructures [9] to provide the 
content including the interactive items to end-users. 
 
IV. 
USE CASE 
 Following, a usage scenario for interactive content-
based on the Non-linear video technology will be introduced. 
The ‘Berlin Tourism’ usage scenario can be categorized as a 
scenario for an interactive tourism information system. In 
this scenario a local tourism centre wants to promote their 
special offer for a weekend trip to Berlin. The campaign 
includes a series of short video clips about the most famous 
sights of Berlin, which are delivered through our envisioned 
new interactive non-linear video platform. The tourism 
centre links detailed tourist information to the sights and 
identifies a number of additional objects in the videos. 
Affiliates of the tourism centre are allowed to place their 
own information and related content on the previously 
identified objects.  
Affiliates of the tourism centre select the content that is 
provided by the tourism centre to feature their own products 
and services on the tourism centre website. The traveller is 
an end-user, who visits the tourism centre website looking 
for a place to go on his vacation. He will take advantage of 
the interactive service in terms of being able to plan his trip 
to Berlin and get informed in detail by watching and 
navigating through the interactive videos using the non-
linear video technology on his mobile phone, Laptop or TV 
at home. 
 
V. 
HOW CONTENT BECOMES INTERACTIVE 
Traditionally, videos and TV content have been created to 
be consumed passively. Using non-linear video, TV and 
multimedia content is made to be experienced interactively. 
This technology creates a seamless transition between 
additional information, valued added services and video 
content. The resulting interactive content functions just like 
a website. Individual sections can be annotated and linked to 
continuous content such as text, images, video and links. 
This information is represented by XML based metadata 
and is made available using an interactive video player. 
Web-Standards are employed as the access control 
technology. The FOKUS Tagging-Tool enables the 
annotation of the raw video data. This intelligent software 
supports the editor by identifying relevant objects and 
sections of a video-scene, placing information and by 
highlighting. The tagging tool is designed to be used as a 
web-based solution and can be conveniently utilized within 
the browser. In addition to the time and spatial data, you can 
also add keywords to describe objects such as the type, 
category or kind of interaction. 
VI. 
CROSS PLATFORM INTERACTIVE VIDEO UTILIZATION 
Non-linear video works with many of the user devices 
available today. The technology of Fraunhofer FOKUS 
enables the convergent use of interactive video content on 
TV, the web as well as mobile phone. This unique

environment makes interactive media available regardless of 
the end device and access platform.  
The different ways for the viewer to interact, the graphic 
presentation of the supplemental information as well as the 
content itself all come in the best possible format for any 
type of user device. Non-linear video thus offers diverse 
variations of both the visual aspects of and interaction with 
the content. As a result, it can offer interactive content, 
relevant 
additional 
information 
and 
communication 
channels custom-made for both the user and the device. 
 
VII. ARCHITECTURE 
This section provides a brief overview on the overall 
architecture of the envisioned interactive media platform and 
its downstream marketplace. The envisioned architecture is a 
three-tier architecture that consists of a rich content “media 
player component” and a video tagging and annotation 
toolkit both in the presentation tier, a set of backend 
components in the application tier and one or more servers in 
the data tier.  
A. Building blocks 
The high-level architecture of the platform consists of six 
different building blocks including sub modules: 
 
Interactive Media Player (client side) 
 
Object Tracking and Linking Tool (client-side) 
 
Media Server (server-side) 
 
Recommender Server (server-side) 
 
Marketplace (server-side) 
 
Advertising Server (server-side 
 
Fig.4 shows the high-level architecture and the above-
mentioned building blocks and their functionality. 
B. Workflow description 
The depicted technology for user-initiated content 
interaction based on our Non-linear video technology refers 
to the following set of features: 
 
The raw video is enriched by metadata. 
 
Users can initiate a content interaction session at any 
time. 
 
Prepared objects will be highlighted for interaction. 
 
Consumers can select several objects to get further 
information (dive into the content). 
The additional information, which is displayed when a 
highlighted object is selected, provides an added value to 
the user. In this way, he is capable of getting a description 
of the highlighted object as well as links to related content 
of any type. Navigating the hyperlinked content spawns a 
hierarchical object tree, which represents the user’s 
particular interests at a given moment in time. In contrast to 
traditional content, which has been produced for linear and 
non-interactive TV, the user is free to choose what content 
he wants to consume now and what will be next – the user 
goes interactive. In a first step, the raw video-content has to 
be analyzed and annotated. This results in an identification 
and description of the objects in the scenes (e.g., a car, 
watch, jacket, sight). The outcome of this procedure is 
metadata information describing the video content. 
Advertisers and content producers can place product related 
information and interactivity by annotating the predefined 
objects. After completion of the annotation and aggregation 
step, the raw video content is enriched with interactive items 
for user interaction. If the user initiates a pause while 
watching the video, the rich media player highlights all 
objects within the current scene, which have been pre-
annotated for user interaction. The user is now skilled to 
interact directly with the interactive items. Based on the 
given metadata information, various possibilities are 
conceivable, e.g., link to product portals, direct shopping, 
product related add-on information and nonlinear video 
scene navigation.

VIII. REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION 
A. Interactive Media Player 
The Interactive Video Player component displays interactive 
videos, which are delivered in the format that has been 
defined as Non-linear video. The media player highlights all 
objects, which have been previously identified and which 
are described in the corresponding metadata. When an end-
user clicks on an object a new user interaction session is 
started and all actions that are linked to the selected object 
are triggered. To ensure a high attention rate among the 
target audience objects can be filtered or differently 
coloured based on their predicted relevance. For that, a 
recommender system is used to calculate the relevance of all 
objects in this scene for a particular end-user. Fig. 5 shows 
the implementation of these interactive media player 
component in terms of our mobile solution running on 
Apples iPhone. Other implementations for Web-Browser 
and Hybrid TV sets are also available. The system provides 
multiple interaction layers, which enables the user to leave 
the current video by watching the next clip about an object 
in a hierarchical way, he can navigate throw the media in a 
non-linear manner. 
 
B. Object identification, tracking and linkage tool 
The Object Tracking and Linking Tool is used to identify 
all objects in a video. This is a three-step process: At first an 
object template has to be defined for each object that should 
be tracked in a video. Next a new instance has to be created 
for each scene that contains this particular object. At last the 
object has to be tracked in each scene. The object template 
contains the definition of the tracking shape, a link to an 
HTML page that provides further information about the 
object and a list of related Web links. Each object instance 
contains information about a particular scene in which the 
object is visible. Single frames numbers and the position of 
the tracking shape in the video frames are recorded.  
The output of the tracking and linking process is the 
object template definition and the list of object instances for 
all objects in a video. This metadata is described in an XML-
based Object Definition Language (ODL), which has been 
adopted on the experience of XML based metadata as TV 
Anytime [10] [11]. The information, which is described in 
the ODL, is used by the Interactive Video Player to enable 
the end-user interaction as described in the previous 
paragraph.  
In the following example, implementations of metadata 
separate from the video data are given, i.e., metadata and 
video data exist as separate files and database entries which 
are combined in the video data player. This has the 
advantage that the video data can remain unchanged. The 
video data player has to load the video as shown in 
“example.obj” in the sample code of the ODL given below. 
Further, the video player has to load the description of the 
identified objects in the video data and the respective linking.  
C. Object Definition Language 
The following sample XML-code describes the object 
identification. For each object that a user can interact with, a 
set of bounding boxes is defined. Each bounding box is

specified with its type (e.g., “a rectangular box”) and size. 
Then the set of frames where a particular object is shown is 
identified. Last, but not least transitions of the bounding 
boxes between individual frames are defined.  
IX. 
CONCLUSION 
 
As opposed to traditional video, which limits interaction and 
use due to its linear nature, interactive video opens up new 
and diverse possibilities. FOKUS non-linear video supports 
multiple levels of interaction in the content itself as well as 
between the interactive objects and the supplemental 
information available. The viewer can access interactive 
video content using three basic levels of interaction: 
 
Moving picture content (video material) 
 
Interactive objects in video (text, audio, video, 
image, web) 
 
Communication channels (telephone, chat, email, 
web 2.0, social networking) 
Whereas the level of moving picture content sparks 
someone’s interest in a topic or product, the newly created 
levels enable customization of content and make detailed 
information about the objects in the video available. In 
combination the interactive possibilities, that are carried out 
to produce a non-linear story line that, can be freely chosen 
and interacted with by the viewer. 
The linking of information using non-linear video can be 
applied ideally for multistep information access and 
business models: from free use, which grants access to 
general information to registration sites as well as premium 
content access through a pay system. Since interaction in 
today’s video platforms is limited to commenting on posts 
and placing advertising banners, the non-linear video 
technology offers new possibilities for interactive video use. 
Multimedia data, video objects and additional information 
are linked to interactive content and enriched by customized 
object interaction. Related information, communication 
channels and content are all customized for the user and his 
end device. Supplemental information enables advanced 
applications such as interactive advertising, video portals 
and edutainment. 
Fostered by the innovative technology and simultaneously 
upcoming opportunities, manufacturers and CE-Industry 
will be empowered to open up new markets. Interactive 
media services become reality and will boost the user 
experience to a higher level. The current solution provides 
interactive video content via rich internet application 
technology as MS Silverlight [12]. The integration to our 
ETSI TISPAN [12] and Open IPTV Forum standards 
compliant Open IPTV Ecosystem [14] has already been 
done. It shows how interactive content may be used in 
future IP based TV, and Hybrid TV environments [15]. Next 
steps will introduce more differentiated interaction models 
for identified interactive object items within the videos. This 
will imply enhancements on the object description language, 
the tagging toolkit and the associated interactive media 
players for the depicted various target platforms.
