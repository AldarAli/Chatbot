Abstract —  The frequency of teleconsultation by Polish family 
doctors 
increased 
significantly 
during 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic. This study aims to assess the usefulness of 
teleconsultation, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as 
its efficiency and credibility. Preliminary results indicate a 
fairly high efficiency and credibility of teleconsultation.

INTRODUCTION
E-health 
services 
in 
the 
form 
of 
medical 
teleconsultations make contact with healthcare professionals 
easier and more convenient than ever before. Tele-visits, 
also known as teleconsultations, allow patients to see a 
doctor from anywhere: on a smartphone, tablet or computer. 
Virtual physician appointments can save doctors and 
patients time and avoid crowded waiting rooms, which 
significantly reduces the risk of infection while waiting for 
an appointment. This is especially important during 
COVID-19 pandemic, since when digital access to medical 
databases and various forms of e-health services has 
increased significantly [1]. Doctors can conduct a medical 
interview during tele-visits. In addition, they can refer the 
patient to laboratory tests and other additional tests; they can 
make e-prescriptions, e-referrals to specialist doctors or to a 
hospital ward and issue a required sick-leave. In the period 
of the coronavirus pandemic, teleconsultation has quickly 
become one of the basic work tools for primary care 
physicians (PCPs) in Poland. 
Preliminary research conducted among Polish patients 
(N=1021) regarding their opinions on teleconsultation give 
ambiguous results - 49% (N=500) of Poles admitted that 
during the pandemic had a telephone contact with a doctor, 
and 5% (N=51) - online contact. As many as 58% (N=592)
of respondents who used a telephone contact with a doctor 
were satisfied with such a form of consultation. 
 Poles are rather not positively focused to telemedicine. 
Only 25% (N=255) of the respondents prefer contact 
telephone or online, and three-quarters of the respondents 
are of the opinion that teleconsultation does not replace 
direct contact with the doctor. 63% (N=643) of Poles claim 
that during pandemic patients with other ailments than 
COVID-19 were treated inadequately. Regardless of the age 
of respondents, almost half acknowledges that they do not 
believe in telemedicine, and consider online or telephone 
visits as completely ineffective [2]. 
In March 2021, by the ordinance of the Polish 
government, the rules of the 
widespread use of 
teleconsultations have been narrowed due to reported cases 
of misuse in this area. Nowadays teleconsultations cannot be

conducted when it concerns the child under 6 years of age, 
in case of suspicion of neoplastic disease, or significant 
exacerbation of a chronic disease.
The aim of the study was to assess the usefulness and 
suitability of medical teleconsultation as a valuable working 
tool for primary care physicians in the COVID-19 
pandemic. It was important to assess benefits and risks of 
this form of family doctor’s work. 
The following research hypotheses were made: 
1. For most primary care physicians, teleconsultation is 
the main working tool. 
2. Most family doctors will use teleconsultation in their 
work after the pandemic COVID-19. 
3. According to family doctors, teleconsultations are an 
effective and reliable tool in everyday work. 
II.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The research was based on the specially designed e-
questionnaire which was distributed in the online form 
among all primary care doctors – members of Polish Society 
of Family Medicine. In this preliminary study, a 
questionnaire was sent to the 828 family doctors from 
Lower Silesia District in Poland. 219 (N=219) of them 
completed the questionnaire, which allowed to achieve a 
26% response rate.  
The anonymous survey used in the study consisted of a 
metric 
including 
age, 
gender 
and 
any 
additional 
specializations performed by the respondent, and 10 
questions regarding the respondent's attitude towards 
teleconsultations. Among 219 respondents, 24% accounted 
for men (N = 52) and 76 % for women (N = 167); the 
respondents were in the age between 25-60 years (60%; 
N=131 in age range 25-49, 40%; N=88 in 41-60). All 
respondents were doctors; 96% (N=210) of them were 
family physicians.

RESULTS
Over 
70% 
of 
respondents 
(N=153) 
 
prefer 
teleconsultation as their primary tool for working in the 
coronavirus pandemic. 46% (N=101) of the respondents 
used teleconsultation as a work tool before the COVID-19 
pandemic. Almost 90% (N=197) of respondents indicated 
that the main advantage of teleconsultation is limiting the 
possibility of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 
4% (N=8) indicated the possibility of giving advice to more 
people at the same time. 
The 
most 
frequently 
reported 
disadvantage 
of 
teleconsultation is the inability to examine the patient 
personally and reliably verify his condition - as many as 
80% (N=175) of respondents encounter this problem. 10% 
(N=22) 
of 
respondents 
complain 
about 
unreliable 
information provided by patients themselves. Only 1% 
(N=2) believe that teleconsultation has no disadvantages. 
Most Polish family doctors intend to use teleconsultation 
after the pandemic is over - as many as 97% (N=212) of 
doctors expressed a positive attitude towards continuing 
work using this method, of which 54% (N=118) of 
respondents intend to use teleconsultation frequently, and 
43% (N=94) - occasionally. One percent (N = 2) do not 
intend to use teleconsultation at all, and 2% (N=4) have no 
opinion on it. 
A frequently reported problem by doctors is the inability 
to confirm the identity of the person being teleconsulted. 
Despite this, the vast majority (65%) (N=142) of physicians 
consider it sufficient to ask for their name and surname. On 
the other hand, over 20% (N=44) of respondents use a 
request for a PESEL number as a form of verification, 
which is the national identification number used in Poland 
that identifies just one person and cannot be changed to 
another one. 
Significant differences emerged in terms of time spent 
teleconsultation - 38% (N=83) report that this form of 
contact they take less time than a traditional visit, 44% 
(N=96) - as much as 18% (N=39) - more than a personal 
visit to the patient. 
The doctors' assessments of the effectiveness and 
credibility of teleconsultation are summarized in Figure 1. 
Teleconsultation was assessed on a scale from 1 to 10, 
where 1 - the lowest and 10 - the highest efficiency/ 
credibility. On average, teleconsultation efficiency was 
rated as 7.22, credibility - as 6.74, which means that doctors 
believe that teleconsultations have good properties as a 
work tool. A lower value of credibility than efficiency may 
result from the problems reported by them in the survey - 
the inability to identify the patient, the inability to 
physically examine the patient and simulating symptoms by 
patients in order to receive sick leave or other treatment, 
adequate according to patients.

DISCUSSION
Along with the development of technology, the universal 
affordability and availability of basic telemedicine tools are 
growing. The COVID-19 outbreak dramatically changed the 
situation of the patients and the family physicians. Despite 
the fact that televisits are a relatively new concept to most 
people, they are important working tool for epidemic 
reason. Telemedicine has advantages and disadvantages, 
however, the most important advantage during COVID-19 
pandemic that it is a safe way to receive medical advice [3] 
[4].  
Other Polish surveys also indicate benefits of televisits 
during the pandemic. Over 90% of the surveyed patients had 
got a good medical advice during teleconsultations 
according to a report of a patient satisfaction conducted by 
the Ministry of Health in cooperation with the National 
Health Fund and national consultant with the field of Family 
Medicine [5]. Telemedicine has made it possible to maintain 
contact between patients and the health care workers in the 
context of maximum complexity both in Poland and other 
countries [5][6].

CONCLUSIONS
Despite the fact that a large percentage of family doctors 
had the opportunity to use teleconsultation before the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the inability to conduct traditional 
visits forced their use by most doctors. According to the 
respondents, limiting the possibility of spreading COVID-
19 infection is the main advantage of teleconsultation. 
Despite this, most Polish family doctors intend to continue 
teleconsulting even after the pandemic ends. On the other 
hand, the main risk is the inability to examine the patient 
and reliably verify his health. However in their opinion, 
teleconsultation is characterized by good effectiveness and 
credibility. The main problem may be the discrepancy 
between the needs of patients and doctors - the first to use 
this form of consultation are often satisfied; however, most 
Poles still prefer stationary visits. Changing this preference 
will require physicians to adapt to patients' needs more 
closely and to try to circumvent the limitations of 
telemedicine.
