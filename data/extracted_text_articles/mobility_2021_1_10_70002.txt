I. INTRODUCTION
The current development of information technologies and
telecommunications gives rise to new control problems related
to efﬁcient transmission of information and allocation of
limited network resources. All these problems are determined
on distributed systems where the spatial location of elements
is taken into account. Due to strong variability and increasing
demand of different wireless telecommunication services, ﬁxed
allocation rules usually lead to serious congestion effects and
inefﬁcient utilization of network resources despite the presence
of very powerful processing and transmission devices. This
situation forces one to replace the ﬁxed allocation rules
with more ﬂexible mechanisms, which are based on proper
mathematical models; see e.g., [1]– [3]. For example, solution
methods for network resource allocation based on optimization
formulations of network manager problems and decomposition
techniques were presented in [4] [5]. In these problems, the
goal function is the total network proﬁt obtained from the total
income of users payments and the implementation costs of the
network. Otherwise, the total network users utility can serve
as a goal function.
At the same time, wireless networks should be reliable
with respect to various attacks. The most commonly seen in
wireless networks are eavesdropping in which attackers aim at
acquiring important/private information of users, jamming and
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which attempt
to interfere and disrupt network operations by exhausting the
resources available to legitimate systems and users. These
attacks may lead to degrading the network performance and
Quality of Service (QoS), as well as losing important data,
reputations, and revenue; see e.g. [6]–[9]. Hence, the network
resource allocation problem should take into account reliability
estimates.
In [10], we considered a problem of telecommunication
network link resources allocation among users under reliability
control of network connections with the pre-deﬁned non-
reliability level. For this problem, it was were suggested
a penalty method. This method attained a solution, but its
convergence does not allow one to attain high accuracy of
solutions.
In this paper, we consider also the problem of allocation
of link resources in telecommunication networks with respect
to both utility and reliability goals. However, unlike [10], we
do not indicate any pre-deﬁned non-reliability level. Our cost
function is a difference of the total network utility and non-
reliability. By using the dual Lagrangian method with respect
to the balance constraint, we replace the initial problem with
an unconstrained optimization problem, where calculation of
the cost function value leads to independent solution of single-
dimensional problems. We present results of computational ex-
periments which conﬁrm the applicability of the new methods.
In Section 2 we describe the link resources allocation
problem in telecommunication networks with respect to both
utility and reliability constraints. In Section 3 we describe
how to apply the dual Lagrange method for solving the
original optimization problem. Finally, in Section 4 we give
computational results which conﬁrm rather stable performance
of the method.
II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
We ﬁrst take the optimal link distribution problem in
computer and telecommunication data transmission networks,
which was suggested in [11]. This model describes a net-
work that contains a set of transmission links (arcs) L and
accomplishes some submitted data transmission requirements
from a set of selected pairs of origin-destination vertices I
within a ﬁxed time period. Denote by xi and αi the current
and maximal value of data transmission for pair demand i,
respectively, and by cl the capacity of link l. Each pair demand
is associated with a unique data transmission path, hence
each link l is associated uniquely with the set Il of pairs of
origin-destination vertices, whose transmission paths contain
this link. For each pair demand xi, we denote by ui(xi) the

utility value at this data transmission volume. Then, we can
write the network utility maximization problem as follows:
max →
X
i∈I
ui(xi)
subject to
X
i∈Il
xi ≤ cl, l ∈ L;
0 ≤ xi ≤ αi, i ∈ I.
If the functions ui(xi) are concave, this is a convex optimiza-
tion problem.
Let us now consider the same telecommunication network
where the reliability factor should be taken into account.
Namely, we associate the reliability to each arc ﬂow and
determine µl(fl) as the non-reliability of the l-th arc having
the ﬂow fl for l ∈ L. Then P
l∈L µl(fl) is the total network
non-reliability and we formulate the network manager problem
as follows:
max →
X
i∈I
ui(xi) −
X
l∈L
µl(fl),
(1)
subject to
X
i∈Il
xi = fl, l ∈ L;
(2)
0 ≤ fl ≤ cl, l ∈ L;
(3)
0 ≤ xi ≤ αi, i ∈ I.
(4)
If the functions ui(xi) and −µl(fl) are concave, this is a
convex optimization problem with the polyhedral feasible set.
However, solution of problem (1)–(4) is not so easy due
to large dimensionality and inexact data. In this paper we
consider the case where the functions ui(xi) and −µl(fl)
are strictly concave. Then, we can apply the known dual
decomposition technique.
III. DUAL DECOMPOSITION METHOD
Let us deﬁne the Lagrange function of problem (1)–(4) as
follows:
L(x, f, y) =
X
i∈I
ui(xi) −
X
l∈L
µl(fl) +
X
l∈L
yl
 X
i∈Il
xi − fl
!
for
x ∈ X =
Y
i∈I
[0, αi] and f ∈ F =
Y
l∈L
[0, cl] .
By duality, we can replace problem (1)–(4) with the dual
unconstrained optimization problem:
min → ϕ(y),
(5)
where
ϕ(y) =
max
x∈X,f∈F L(x, f, y).
(6)
Clearly, the dual cost function ϕ is convex. Moreover, under
the strict convexity of the functions µl and the strict concavity
of the functions ui it is differentiable. Calculation of its
value and its gradient is rather simple and decomposed into
independent solution of single-dimensional problems. Denote
by Li the set of links belonging to the path associated with
the origin-destination pair i. By deﬁnition,
ϕ(y)
=
max
x∈X,f∈F L(x, f, y)
=
X
i∈I
max
0≤xi≤αi
(
ui(xi) + xi
X
l∈Li
yl
)
−
X
l∈L
min
0≤fl≤cl {µl(fl) + ylfl}
=
X
i∈I
(
ui(xi(y)) + xi(y)
X
l∈Li
yl
)
−
X
l∈L
{µl(fl(yl)) + ylfl(yl)} ,
where xi(y) and fl(yl) are unique solutions of the single-
dimensional optimization problems
max
0≤xi≤αi
(
ui(xi) + xi
X
l∈Li
yl
)
and
min
0≤fl≤cl {µl(fl) + ylfl} ,
respectively. Next, we obtain
∂ϕ(y)
∂yl
=
X
i∈Il
xi(y) − fl(yl), l ∈ L.
These properties enable us to apply the usual Uzawa gradient
method to ﬁnd a solution of the dual problem (5):
yk+1 = yk − λkϕ′(yk), λk > 0.
IV. COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS
As part of the work, a numerical study of the suggested
method was carried out. The method was implemented in C++
with a PC with the following facilities: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-
4500, CPU 1.80 GHz, RAM 6 Gb.
In the experiments, we used quadratic functions of utility
of origin-destination pairs (QuadC)
ui(xi) = u1,ix2
i + u0,ixi, u1,i < 0, u0,i > 0, i ∈ I,
quadratic functions of non-reliability of arcs (QuadA)
µl(fl) = µ1,lf 2
l + µ0,lfl, µ1,l, µ0,l > 0, l ∈ L,
logarithmic functions of utility of origin-destination pairs
(LogC)
ui(xi) = u2,i ln(u0,i + u1,ixi), uj,i > 0, j = 0, . . . , 2, i ∈ I,
and logarithmic functions of non-reliability of arcs (LogA)
µi(xi) = µ0,lfl − ln(1 + µ1,lfl), µ0,l, µ1,l > 0, l ∈ L.
All the arcs and origin-destination pairs were indexed as l =
0, . . . , |L|−1 (|L| is the cardinality of L) and i = 0, . . . , |I|−1
(|I| is the cardinality I), respectively.

The coefﬁcients µ1,l, µ0,l, u0,i, u1,i, and u2,i were formed
on the basis of trigonometric functions:
(i)
for the functions QuadC
u0,i = 2| sin(2i+2)|+2, u1,i = −| cos(2i+1)|−1,
(ii)
for the functions QuadA
µ0,l = | cos(l + 1)| + 3, µ1,l = 2| sin(2l + 2)| + 1,
(iii)
for the functions LogC
u0,i
=
2| sin(2i + 2)| + 1, u1,i = | sin(i + 2)| + 1,
u2,i
=
3| sin(2i + 2)| + 1,
(iv)
for the functions LogA
µ0,l = 10| cos(l+1)|+10, µ1,l = 2| cos(2l+2)|+1.
The maximal arc ﬂow capacity cl was selected in [1] [10]
as follows:
cl = 10| cos(l + 3)| + 1.
The maximal path ﬂow capacity αi associated with a origin-
destination pair was selected in [1] [7] as follows:
αi = 7| sin(i)| + 1.
The stepsize parameter λk in the dual gradient method was
ﬁxed and equal to 0.6.
In our tests, we used the following combinations of func-
tions: QuadA-LogC, QuadA-QuadC, LogA-LogC. The distri-
bution of the available arcs across the origin-destination pairs
was carried out either uniformly or according to the normal
distribution law. In the gradient method, we used two different
initial points: the vector e of units and vector 100e.
We now introduce additional notations:
1) ε is the accuracy of ﬁnding solution of the problem,
2) Tε,1 and Tε,100 are the time (in seconds) of the method
with the starting point e and 100e, respectively,
3) Iε,1 and Iε,100 are the numbers of iterations spent
searching for a solution to the problem with the starting
point e and 100e, respectively.
The gradient method was stopped if the norm ∥ϕ′(yk)∥
appeared less than ε. In Tables I–IV we give the results of
ﬁnding a solution of the problem with QuadA-LogC combi-
nation of functions. In Table I, we give the results for the case
where |I| = 620, |L| = 310 and for different values ε. In
Table II, we give the results for the case where |I| = 310,
|L| = 620 and for different values ε. In Table III, we give
the results for the case where ε = 10−2, |L| = 310 and for
different values |I|. In Table IV, we give the results for the
case where ε = 10−2, |I| = 310 and for different values |L|.
In this series of numerical experiments the solution time was
less than one second. The experiments for the cases QuadA-
QuadC and LogA-LogC gave similar results, which are given
in Tables V–VIII and IX–XII, respectively.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We presented a general problem of allocation of network re-
sources in telecommunication networks using both utility and
reliability factors. We suggest to apply the dual decomposition
method to this problem. The results of computational experi-
ments conﬁrmed rather stable performance of the method.
