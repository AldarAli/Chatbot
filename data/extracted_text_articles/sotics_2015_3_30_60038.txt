Abstract—The phenomenon of social TV is gaining importance 
in both industry and research. TV broadcasters are 
increasingly adopting social TV strategies both on first and 
second screen to increase the viewers’ online engagement. The 
research done so far suggests quite simple models of the 
phenomenon, identifying and studying separately the effects of 
different variables on online engagement. This research 
represents one of the first attempts to develop a better research 
model. We analyzed a large dataset related to a popular Italian 
TV show using social strategies to engage viewers on Twitter. 
Through hierarchical linear regression models we studied the 
relationships among social strategies, TV contents, viewership, 
time and different kinds of viewers’ online behavior. We 
demonstrate that (i) different factors play different roles in 
affecting the viewers’ online engagement and (ii) the 
phenomenon can be better explained if we look at different 
kinds of online behavior that represent online engagement, 
such as posting original comments, sharing or replying to 
them. Despite some limitations, we think that this work’s 
findings may be important for researchers to develop a holistic 
research model of social TV, and for practitioners to realize 
how to balance the factors affecting the viewers’ online 
engagement in an effective way.  
Keywords-Social TV; social networks; viewers’ online 
engagement. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
The phenomenon of Social TV has gained a striking 
importance in the last years. Increasing the amount of 
discussion associated with TV show’s contents, i.e., the 
online engagement of TV viewers, has become a major goal 
of the companies in this industry. TV broadcasters 
encourage viewers interacting in real time with the TV 
shows and sharing online comments through “second 
screen” devices (smartphones and tablets). They do this 
through several social strategies, which can be delivered on 
both screens. Examples of strategies on the first screen 
include showing Twitter hashtags and recent viewers’ 
comments on the TV screen during a show, or let the show 
hosts reply to some of the viewers’ tweets. Second screen 
strategies include posting comments on a social network or 
delivering online messages to invite viewers polling a 
show’s contestants. The main reason behind the use of these 
strategies is the idea that they can increase the viewers’ 
online engagement in online communities, such as Twitter, 
which is the most popular social network in both research 
and industry domains. In the recent past, scholars have 
studied this phenomenon [34][35] examining the changes in 
the relationship between the broadcasting industry and its 
audience, thus considering the new ways of audience 
engagement through the integration of the technology. 
Particularly, recent research investigated the relationship 
between online engagement and social strategies. They 
showed that using social TV strategies on the first screen 
can be predictive of various types of online engagement 
[15]. Other works [5][10][12][32][33] have highlighted the 
existence of several variables, which can play an important 
role in driving the TV viewers’ online engagement, such as 
viewership, time and the show contents. Moreover, recent 
studies [3][7][15][27][29][32] have identified different 
kinds of behavior, which can represent online engagement, 
such as posting tweets or sharing them. However, the 
approach used in these works suggests a quite simple model 
of the phenomenon, where the use of a certain social 
strategy can have an effect, potentially positive, on the 
online engagement of viewers. This research represents the 
first step in the development of an appropriate research 
model to study the phenomenon of social TV online 
engagement (OE). The goal of this research is to 
demonstrate that a change in the OE of TV viewers cannot 
be simply explained by the use of social TV strategies, 
rather different variables play different roles in the 
phenomenon. Based on prior research we have identified 
several variables, which can be included in a model. Firstly, 
three main factors can affect OE: the use of social 
strategies, the type of TV content on air, the online behavior 
of other viewers. Secondly, three variables may influence 
OE and have to be controlled: viewership, time during an 
episode, time during the season. Finally, OE can be 
represented by three different kinds of behavior: generation 
of original tweets, sharing tweets (retweets), replies to 
tweets. We studied the relationships among these variables 
by analyzing the behavior of viewers on Twitter during 
“L’Isola dei Famosi”, a popular Italian TV show. We used 
hierarchical linear regression models. We have found that 
the phenomenon of OE can be better explained if we look at 
different kinds of behavior separately, namely generating 
original tweets, sharing tweets (retweets), replying to 
tweets. In this paper, we show the following main results: 
(1a) viewership affects the overall number of original 
65

tweets, as expectable; however, it does not affect retweets 
and replies; (1b) online engagement decreases with time 
during each episode, while it increases during the season; 
(2a) the effect of social strategies is different for different 
kinds of behavior: they increase generation while decrease 
retweets and replies; (2b) the effect of TV contents depends 
on the kind of content: commercial breaks decrease 
generation while increase retweets and replies, “challenges” 
always decrease OE. We also found that (3) an increase in 
the number of original tweets generated is correlated to an 
increase in retweets and replies. The contributions of this 
work are the following. First, we demonstrate that different 
factors play different roles in the phenomenon and their 
effect to online engagement is more complex than what 
research has shown so far. Second, we show that these 
effects depend of the type of online behavior we use to 
represent online engagement. Third, to our best knowledge 
this is one of the first attempts to develop a complex 
research model of the phenomenon of online engagement in 
the context of social TV. Despite some limitations in our 
research, we think that its findings may be important from 
the business viewpoint because they contribute to clarify the 
real factors affecting the phenomenon and help managers 
properly design TV shows and social strategies in order to 
drive viewers online and keep them engaged. The paper is 
structured as follows. Section II provides a description of 
the existing literature on social television. Section III depicts 
the methodology of our research, in terms of dataset, 
variables’ description and the propositions we explored in 
our research. Section IV illustrates the results and Section V 
describes their implications from research and managerial 
viewpoints and limitations of this work. 
 
II. 
PRIOR WORK 
Research has shown that television is a facilitator of 
social interactions, bringing people together and giving 
them a broad variety of topics to discuss [20][21][30]. 
Moreover, it affects viewers’ behavior [26] in terms of 
shaping, reinforcing or changing their reactions [16]. This 
depends on factors, such as the type of contents or messages 
[22][26]. In recent years, the television domain has been 
interested by the phenomenon of “Social TV”, which refers 
to the variety of systems that support social practices 
associated with TV viewing [13]. Social networks have 
gained a relevant role, since they allow viewers to share 
online their real-time viewing experiences [6], by 
interacting around the TV contents. Therefore, viewers can 
be affected by social interactions in online networks during 
a viewing experience [16][28]. Research has studied several 
aspects of Social TV. Some authors studied viewers’ 
motivations and the different ways to interact on social 
network sites during viewing [9][18][32]. Notably, some 
scholars analyzed the use of hashtags. For instance, [4] 
stated that hashtags are used to group tweets by topic, thus 
allowing people to follow and contribute to conversations 
on topics of interest, e.g., during televised political debates 
in the U.S. presidential primaries. Others studied how 
viewers’ messages are related to what viewers are watching 
and observed particular behavioral patterns focusing on 
specific TV programs and contents [5][12][32]. Moreover, 
viewers can deliver different types of messages (tweets) 
when using Twitter, which are generally studied separately: 
original tweets, when posting a message for the first time; 
replies, when responding to an existing message, and 
retweets, 
when 
sharing 
an 
existing 
message 
[3][7][15][27][29][32]. A major topic is the analysis of the 
Social TV Strategies that broadcasters often use during a 
show. These strategies may consist in adopting program’s 
official hashtags [8], displaying on the first screen social 
media elements such as viewers’ tweets [13][15] or in 
leveraging the use of second screen applications dedicated 
to the program to deliver several types of trigger [2][5][19]. 
These strategies aim at attracting people’s interest towards 
the live shows [24] and increase the viewers’ involvement 
towards the programs [31]. They are used to prompt real-
time viewers to interact online with the TV programs and to 
share online messages [13][14][15]. A few studies have 
reported the effects of the Social TV Strategies on viewers’ 
behaviors. For instance, reference [15] analyzed the effect 
of the social TV strategies in the American show “The 
Voice”. They studied the effects of different social strategies 
displayed on the first screen: showing a show-related tweet 
on the screen increases the number of retweet, while 
showing a hashtag on the screen increases the viewers’ 
online engagement, i.e., the amount of discussions 
associated with the TV show’s contents [15], during 
commercial breaks. Another study [10] showed that in 
certain circumstances online engagement can be predicted 
by the show contents rather than by the use of social 
strategies and that the overall number of tweets is highly 
correlated to the number of viewers. Another work has 
examined viewers’ visual attention while interacting with 
synchronized second-screen applications and found that the 
presence of the second screen dramatically decreased the 
attention towards TV contents [17]. Each one of these works 
has studied the influence of one single type of variable on 
OE. This entails the use of very simple models, which, in 
our opinion, cannot explain a complex social phenomenon 
properly. Researchers, indeed, have not built yet a complex 
model to explain the whole phenomenon of the viewers’ 
online behavior. Building and testing such models is 
important because it would clarify the factors affecting 
online engagement and, in turn, the source of business value 
related to social TV and second screen applications. Our 
research represents the very first step in the attempt of 
filling this gap.  
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
In this section, we report the methodology followed for 
our experiments. In particular, we discuss the dataset used to 
perform analyses, the variables measured during our study 
and the propositions to explore. 
A. Dataset 
We collected data from the 2015 edition of the Italian 
TV show “L’Isola dei Famosi”, a reality show where 
celebrities have to survive on a desert island. The show had 
66

one episode a week and lasted 7 weeks, from the 2nd of 
February to the 23th of March, each episode lasted around 
170 minutes. The TV broadcaster delivered several social 
strategies during the show on the second screen app 
dedicated to the program (see next section for the list). 
Viewers interacted on Twitter during the show using the 
official TV show hashtag. First of all, we acquired 
approximately 500,000 tweets, including the official TV 
show hashtag. The tweets in our dataset included original 
tweets, retweets and replies. We used the tweet time-stamp 
to associate each tweet with a minute during the show. 
Second, we structured in our dataset the type of TV content 
that viewers were watching minute by minute for the 1,242 
minutes of show (including commercial breaks). Third, we 
collected the type of social strategy that the broadcaster was 
delivering on the second screen app minute by minute. 
Fourth, we gathered the number of viewers who were tuned 
on the show also minute by minute (viewership), provided 
by Auditel s.r.l.. In conclusion, we collected 1,242 
observations corresponding to as many minutes and each 
observation included information on tweets, TV contents, 
social strategies and viewership.  
B. Measurements 
Based on the literature reviewed in the previous section, 
we have identified several variables, which can be included 
in a model of the Social TV phenomenon. Three main 
factors can generate OE, (1) the use of social strategies, (2) 
the type of TV content, (3) the online behavior of other 
viewers (the tweets generated). Three variables may 
influence OE and have to be controlled: (4) viewership (the 
number of TV viewers), (5) time (measured both during 
each episode and during the whole season). OE can be 
represented by three different kinds of behavior: (7) posting 
original comments, (8) sharing comments, (9) replying to 
comments. The dependent variable in our models is the 
online engagement (OE). According to the research we have 
reviewed, we have defined OE as the amount of discussions 
around the TV show’s content, measured by the total 
number of tweets including the TV show’s official hashtag. 
In addition we classified the tweets as follows: original 
tweets (OT), measured by the total number of tweets posted 
for the first time; original tweets from app (AT), measured 
by the total number of tweets posted for the first time, but 
delivered through the second screen application (AT 
represents a subset of OT); retweets (RT), measured by the 
total number of retweets, i.e., the share of existing tweets; 
replies (RP), measured by the total number of replies to 
existing tweets. According to prior research [15] the 
measurement of dependent variables is shifted by a time 
delay of one minute with respect to the measurement of 
independent variables. The independent variables in our 
models are the TV content and the social strategy. TV 
content is defined as a nominal variable that describes what 
type of contents viewers are watching on the TV screen and 
takes nine values: (1) general contents, (2) challenge, (3) 
nomination, (4) week summary, (5) contestant’s elimination, 
(6) appearance of eliminated contestant in studio, (7) visit in 
“Playa Desnuda”, (8) start of voting, (9) commercial break. 
Social strategy is defined as a nominal variable describing 
what message the broadcaster delivered to viewers through 
the second screen app. It takes eight values: (1) call to 
comment, (2) survey/quiz, (3) call to predict, (4) photo 
gallery, (5) call for appreciation, (6) call to vote, (7) 
displaying related information, (8) absence of strategy. 
Finally, we considered viewership and time (episode and 
season) as control variables. We measured viewership as the 
number of viewers in each minute. Since we observe the 
aggregate phenomenon of online interaction, a change in the 
number of viewers may affect the overall number of tweets. 
In addition, since a variation in OE may be caused by time 
[15], we used two measures of time: the minute in each 
episode and the number of episode. We included these 
measures of time to test the existence of a relationship 
between independent variables and dependent variables by 
excluding the effect of the control variables, but also to 
identify possible online engagement’s trends in time. 
C. Propositions development 
According to prior research, we developed three main 
propositions that we want to explore:  
P1: Viewership and time affect OE. 
P2: TV contents and social strategies affect OE. 
P3: OT affect RT and RP. 
 
We explored these propositions through hierarchical 
multiple linear regression models [1][11], using SPSS. In 
general, we first built a linear regression considering one 
dependent variable a time, checked the significance, then 
added more dependent variables and checked again the 
significance of the model. We repeated this procedure for 
each dependent variable. Dependent and control variables 
are metric, while we codified the nominal independent 
variables as dummy (binary) variables.  
IV. 
RESULTS 
In order to explore P1, we built models having 
viewership, episode and minute as independent variables: 
first, we built simple linear regressions considering only one 
of the described variables, then we used all variables 
together. We iteratively repeated this procedure one 
dependent variable a time, i.e., OT, AT, RT and RP. Table I 
reports the results. We also ran regressions measuring 
viewership in a log scale. For lack of space we do not report 
these results. As expected, we found that viewership 
positively affects the online engagement. Looking at the 
three kinds of behavior, we observed that viewership 
positively affects the number of original tweets (both OT 
and AT), while it does not affect the number of RT and RP. 
We also found that the online engagement decreases minute 
by minute during each episode. Looking at the three kinds 
of behavior, the decrease holds for AT, RT and RP while 
OT increase. In addition, only the number of RT and RP 
increases during the season (episode by episode), while 
there is no effect for OT. Therefore, we found that P1 is 
valid, however the relationship between viewership, time 
and OE changes depending on what kind of online behavior 
we measure. In order to explore P2 we ran the models with 
67

TV contents and social strategies as independent variables. 
First, we built the models considering only one independent 
variable and then all variables together, including 
viewership and time variables as control variables. We 
iteratively repeated this procedure one dependent variable a 
time. Table II reports the results of the final model. As 
expected, we found that TV contents and social strategies 
affect the online engagement. In particular, some contents 
(challenge), strategies (call to vote) and the absence of a 
strategy negatively affects the OE, while some contents 
(contestant’s elimination, commercial break, displaying 
related information) positively affects the OE. Looking at 
each kind of online behavior, we found more clear patterns. 
If we consider the TV contents, the “challenge” decreases 
all kinds of behaviors (OT, RT and RP); the “contestant’s 
elimination” increases the original tweets; the “appearance 
of eliminated contestant in studio” increases the number of 
RP. Interestingly, during “commercial breaks” the number 
of OT increases while the number of RT and RP decreases. 
If we consider the social strategies, we found that the “call 
to comment” has a positive effect only on the number of 
tweets from app (which is expectable because strategies 
were only shown on the second screen app) while it has a 
negative effect on the number of RT and RP. The “call for 
appreciation” and the “call to vote” have a negative effect 
on the number of RT, while the “displaying related 
information” has a positive effect on the AT. Finally, the 
“absence of strategy” has a negative effect on all kind of 
behaviors. Again, our models show that P2 is valid, 
however the relationships change depending on the way OE 
is measured. In order to explore P3, we ran the models with 
OT and original AT as independent variables. We included 
viewership and time as control variables. We used RT and 
RP as dependent variables. Table III reports the results of 
the final model, with all variables together. We found that 
the number of OT and the number of AT positively affects 
both the number of RT and RP. In this case, the models 
confirm the validity of P3.  
V. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  
In this section, we present and discuss the findings and 
their implications from research and managerial viewpoints. 
First, we have shown that the phenomenon of OE can be 
better explained if we look at different kinds of online 
behavior separately (namely generating original tweets, 
sharing tweets and replying to tweets). In fact, we confirmed 
the influence of viewership on OE: the higher the number of 
viewers tuned into the program, the higher the number of 
tweets posted. However, looking at the different kinds of 
online behaviors, we found that the viewership affects the 
number of OT while it does not affect the number of RT and 
RP. We also found that the OE changes during each episode 
and during the season. During each episode, the number of 
RT and RP decreases while the number of OT increases. 
Finally, the number of RT and RP increases during the 
season, while the OT do not. Second, we have shown that 
TV contents and social strategies affect OE. Also in this 
case, the relationship between contents and OE as well as 
the relationship between the use of social strategies and OE 
changes depending on what online behavior is used as 
measure of OE. On the one hand, we found that some 
strategies have a positive effect on the generation of OT and 
a negative effect on RT and RP, while the absence of a 
strategy has a negative effect on all kind of behaviors. On 
the other hand, we found that different TV contents have 
different effects on the online behavior. During challenges, 
all kinds of OE decrease. During commercial breaks the 
generation of OT decreases while RT and RP increase. 
During the elimination, OT and RP increase. Finally, we 
found that the generation of OT positively affects sharing 
and replying behaviors: the number of OT generated is 
correlated with the number of RT and RP. This research has 
clearly some limitations. The main are the use of one dataset 
only, the fact that the social strategies in our setting were 
only delivered by the second screen app, and the use of 
“simple” regression models. Despite this, our findings may 
have interesting implications from both a research and a 
managerial viewpoint. For researchers, it is interesting to 
develop a consistent interpretation of viewers’ behavior to 
build a holistic research model. For instance, when viewers 
are watching a challenge they decrease each form of OE, but 
this is offset by an increase in the willing to post new 
comments when contestants are eliminated. Viewers seem 
to be willing to share comments and reply to comments 
during breaks. Challenges are likely to attract more attention 
towards the first screen, while commercial breaks attract 
viewers to the second screen: however, since viewers are 
not provided with any content to tweet about, they tend to 
read and react to existing tweets. From a managerial 
viewpoint, our results suggest that TV contents remain a 
major factor affecting OE. However, social strategies may 
increase the generation of OT, which, in turn, are a factor 
affecting RT and RP. Broadcaster should then carefully 
balance the use of social strategies with TV contents in 
order to drive the viewers’ online behavior effectively. In 
the next research steps, we plan to develop a behavioral 
interpretation of the phenomenon and test hypotheses 
through the use of more datasets and the use of more 
sophisticated statistical models. Moreover, we plan to 
analyze the relationship between contents and strategies and 
understand the effect of combinations of contents and 
strategies.
