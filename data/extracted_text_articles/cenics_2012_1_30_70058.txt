Abstract—In this paper we present a simple ultra low-voltage
and high speed D ﬂip-ﬂop. The Flip-Flop may be used in any
standard digital low-voltage CMOS applications. Furthermore,
the ultra low-voltage Flip-Flop offers reduced data to output
delay compared to conventional CMOS Flip-Flops. Different
master latch conﬁgurations are presented and a differential
symmetric ultra low-voltage Flip-Flop is presented. Simulated
data using HSpice and process parameters for 90nm CMOS
are provided. Preliminary results show that the proposed Flip-
Flop has a delay less than 20% compared to a conventional
CMOS Flip-Flop.

I. INTRODUCTION
The ever increasing problem associated with modern
CMOS processes is the demand for digital CMOS gates op-
erating at low supply voltages. The available supply voltage
and threshold voltage is lowered as a consequence of the
reduction in transistor length. When the supply voltage is de-
creased the speed of the logic circuits may be reduced due to
reduced effective input voltage to the transistors. When the
threshold voltage is reduced the off current running through
transistors which are switched off will increase and thereby
increase static power consumption and reduce noise margins.
Voltage scaling reduces the active energy and unfortunately
speed as well. Low voltage applications are often dominated
by low speed and low energy requirements, typical battery-
powered electronics. The optimal supply voltage for CMOS
logic in terms of energy delay product (EDP) is close to the
threshold voltage of the nMOS transistor Vtn for the actual
process, assuming that the threshold voltage of the pMOS
transistor Vtp is approximately equal to −Vtn [1]. Several
approaches to high speed and low voltage digital CMOS
circuits have been presented [2][3][4].
Floating-gate (FG) CMOS gates have been proposed for
ultra low-voltage (ULV) and low power (LP) logic [5]. How-
ever, in modern CMOS technologies there are signiﬁcant
gate leakages which undermine non-volatile FG circuits.
FG gates implemented in a modern CMOS process require
frequent initialization to avoid signiﬁcant leakage. By using
ﬂoating capacitances to the transistor gate terminals the

semi-ﬂoating-gate (SFG) nodes can have a different DC level
than provided by the supply voltage headroom [5].
The ULV logic [6], [7] gates can be operated at a clock
frequency more than 10 times than the maximum clock
frequency of a similar complementary CMOS gate operating
at the same supply voltage. For high clock frequencies, the
switching energy consumed by the ULV gate will be reduced
compared to a complementary gate.
In this paper we present an ultra low-voltage ﬂip-ﬂop
(UFF) using ULV CMOS logic. The UFF offers a signif-
icant speed improvement compared to conventional sense
ampliﬁer FF (SAFF’s) [8] hereafter called FF1. In section
II a short introduction to ultra low-voltage logic is given.
The simple UFF is described in section III [9]. Four new
master conﬁgurations are presented in section IV including a
low-power version. Symmetric ultra low-voltage differential
FF’s are presented in section V with simulated results using
HSpice simulator and 90nm TSMC process.
II. ULTRA LOW VOLTAGE LOGIC
The original ULV inverter and ULV NP domino inverters
are shown in Figure 1. The recharge phase starts when the
clock signal φ switches from 0 to 1. Assuming a NPULV
Pφ inverter there are two different situations dependent on
the state of the gate. First, assume that the output is 1 or
close to 1, the nMOS ﬂoating gate is close to Voffset+
and the pMOS ﬂoating-gate is close to Voffset− due to a
static input in the previous evaluation phase. In this case the

only work to be done is a marginal refresh of the ﬂoating-
gates and the output. Secondly, assume that the output is
0, the nMOS ﬂoating gate is close to Voffset+ + kinVDD
and the pMOS ﬂoating-gate is close to Voffset− + kinVDD
due to a positive input transition in the previous evaluation
phase. In this case the output needs to be pulled to 1 and
this is done by the pMOS and nMOS transistors in parallel.
Notice that the nMOS En2 is positive biased at the time of
the clock edge and will contribute signiﬁcantly to pull the
output from 0 to 1. When the output is getting close to 1 the
recharged pMOS evaluate transistor Ep2 will pull the output
to 1. The nMOS ﬂoating-gate will initially have a potential
of Voffset+ + kinVDD ≈ 1.5 × VDD and a positive current
will ﬂow to Voffset+ or VDD while the nMOS ﬂoating-gate
will be recharged through a negative current drawn from
Voffset− or gnd. Simulation shows that the time required
to precharge the NPULV logic is two to three times the raise
and fall times for different supply voltages.
The evaluation phase starts when the clock signal φ
switches from 1 to 0. In the evaluation phase there are two
different situations depending on the input. If the input is
stable, i.e. no transition, during the evaluation phase the
output will remain close to 1. The circuit will in this situation
consume signiﬁcant static current. The static current is
dependent on the applied offset voltages Voffset− and/or
Voffset+ as well. Assuming a positive input transition, the
ﬂoating-gates will be moved by kinVDD and the output will
be pulled down to 0 in a similar manner as a complementary
inverter. The active current will be larger due to the boost
of the evaluate transistors.
The ULV inverters shown in Figure 1 recharge simultane-
ously when φ = 1. The precharge level is different, the Pφ
precharges to 1 and while the output of the Nφ precharges
to 0. The Pφ gate is susceptible to a positive input transition
when the evaluate phase starts, i.e. φ = 0.
III. SIMPLE ULTRA LOW VOLTAGE FLIP-FLOP
The transistor counts for the Flip-Flops presented in this
paper are less than for conventional Flip-Flops. The layout
area is dependent on the implementation of the ﬂoating
capacitors. The capacitance values for the ﬂoating capacitors
are typically less than 1fF, and hence can be implemented
using MOS transistor parasitic capacitances and metal-metal.
The accuracy of the ﬂoating capacitors is not critical and
high level metal can be used.
The simple ULV Flip-Flop is shown in Figure 2 [9]. The
input D is loaded onto QMP and QMN when φ = 0.
When φ switches from 0 to 1, one of the evaluate transistors
En1 or Ep1 will be activated due to a boosted voltage level
of QMN or QMP. If D = 0 then QMP will be pulled
down to ≈ −VDD/2 and a large current provided by the Ep1
transistor will be used to set the output of a slave latch and
Flip-Flop to Q = D. If D = 1 then QMN will be pulled
up to ≈ 3VDD/2 and a large current provided by the En1

transistor will be used to set the output of the Flip-Flop to
Q = D. The timing of the ULV Flip-Flop is shown in Figure
3. There are some critical events and timing restrictions that
are important for performance of the ULV Flip-Flop:
1) E1. Clock signal φ switches from 1 to 0. Any change
in D will be loaded to QMP and QMN. If D = 0
12

then QMP = D and QMN ≈ D, and if D = 1 then
QMN = D and QMP ≈ D. The slave latch will not
be inﬂuenced by any changes in QMP or QMN due
to the inverters at the output. The inverters must be
strong enough to hold a stable output value when the
master latch is transparent.
2) E2. Input D is stable. The critical timing restriction is
the setup time and thus only dependent on the delay
through a pass transistor.
3) R1. QMN and QMP will be set to D. More specif-
ically, VQMN = VDD if D = 1 and VQMN ≈ VDD/2
if D
= 0, and VQMP
=
0V
if D
= 0 and
VQMP ≈ VDD/2 if D = 1.
4) E2 → R1. Data to QM delay tDQM.
5) E3. Clock signal φ switches from 0 to 1. One of the
evaluate transistors are activated trough a boosted QM
voltage. The activated evaluate transistor will drive the
output Q to D because the current level provided by
the evaluate transistor is signiﬁcantly larger than the
current level of the inverters. This is the only event that
may trigger the slave latch and determine the output
of the Flip-Flop. The master latch becomes non active.
6) R2. Slave latch will respond to QMN or QMP and
set the slave latch output Q = D and Q = DB.
7) E1 → E3. The master latch is active and output Q is
stable due to the cross coupled inverters at the output.
8) E2 → E3. Setup time for the input. This is the only
signiﬁcant delay of the ULV Flip-Flop.
9) E2 → R2. Data to output time.
10) E3 → E1. The slave latch is active and master latch
is non active.
The simple ULV master latch is shown in Figure 2. D
is loaded onto QM1P and QM1N when φ = 0. More
speciﬁcally if D
= 1 then QM1N
= D = 1 and
QM1P < D due to the body effect, and if D = 0 then
QM1P = D = 0 and QM1N > D. When the clock signal
φ switches from 0 to 1 the recharge transistors Rn1 and
Rp1 closes and the capacitive input will increase the voltage
level of QM1N and decrease the voltage level at QM1P.
In the case of D being equal to 1 the resultant voltage at
QM1N is >> VDD hence >> D andQM1P is ≈ 0 hence
≈ D. In this case the nMOS transistor En1 is more enhanced
than the Ep1 transistor and the output Q will be pulled
to 0 = D through a large current provided by En1. The
QM nodes will be ﬂoating until the next event determined
by the clock switching from 1 to 0. Hence, the En1 and
Ep1 transistors will be ON until this event and contribute to
power consumption. One or both of these transistors should
be turned OFF to save power while the slave is active.
The most critical timing issue in the ULV Flip-Flop is the
setup time of the master latch. The elevated current level of
the evaluation transistors in a slave latch, i.e. slave latch
in Figure 2, will pull the output quickly to the right value.
Typically, the clock to output delay is negative due to the
extremely low rise and fall time of the output Q.
IV. MASTER LATCHES
In this section we present new master latch conﬁgurations
aimed for ultra low-voltage applications including a novel
low power version. The master latches presented are differ-
ent from previously published ULV Flip-Flops [9] in several
aspects. The inputs to the Flip-Flops are used to control the
recharge transistors and are used to reduce the static power
consumption. By adding transistors to increase the control
of the semi ﬂoating-gates, i.e. QM voltages, we can turn
off the non active evaluation transistors. Compared to the
ULV Flip-Flop in [9] all the presented master latches and
Flip-Flops described in this paper are low power.
Different implementations of ultra low voltage master
latches are shown in Figure 4. The basic master latch is
shown in Figure 2 where the input D is applied through pass
transistors. In Figure 4 2) additional recharge transistors,
labeled Kn2 and Kp2, are applied to the QM nodes. The
effect of these transistors is provide a way to turn the
evaluate transistors off and thereby reducing the power
consumption when φ = 1. The QM2N and QM2P will
be affected while the clock signal switches and the full
effect of the signal through the ﬂoating capacitor may be
reduced. In Figure 4 3) a differential input master latch is
shown where we use the D input to turn off the most active
evaluate transistor. This conﬁguration will not be as robust
as the master latch in 2). The master latch shown in Figure
4 4) resembles the circuit in 2). The effect of the keeper
transistors Kn4 and Kp4 will be delayed slightly compared
to Kn2 and Kp2 and the effect of the signal applied to
the ﬂoating capacitors are more evident. In Figure 4 5) the
additional transistors are controlled by the output of the slave
latch Q. If the output Q = 1 the Kn5 transistor will be
turned on and reduce the current running through transistor
En5 and hence reduce the power consumption and increase
the noise margin of a slave latch.
Simulated responses for different master latches are shown
in Figure 5. The supply voltage is 200mV and timing details
for event E1 and E2 are shown. The master latches become
active when φ switches from 1 to 0 and D is passed onto
the QM nodes through the recharge transistors. At event
E2 the input changes from 0 to 1 and the QM are affected.
QM2N, QM2N and QM4N will be pulled to 0 after right
after the output of the slave is pulled to 0. Master latches
1), 3) and 5) require less set-up time than 2) and 4).

V. SYMMETRIC DIFFERENTIAL ULTRA LOW-VOLTAGE
FLIP-FLOPS
A symmetric and differential ULV Flip-Flop is shown in
Figure 6. The master latches are similar to that of Figure 4 2)
and the slave latches resemble the basic slave latch shown in
Figure 2. The presented Flip-Flop is different from the Flip-
Flop presented in [9] by using the input D, and D, to power
the evaluation transistors En1, En2, Ep1 and Ep2 directly.
This reduces the signal path from input to output of the ULV
Flip-Flops described. The most critical timing issue of the
master latches presented is the set-up time. By using the D
and D inputs directly to the evaluate transistors as if they
were pass transistors the Flip-Flop will react more quickly
because all evaluate transistors will the pull the outputs in
the same direction.

are shown. The recharge transistor Rn1 will pass the D = 0
onto the gate of evaluate transistor Ep1. This node is labeled
QMP. In the set-up phase QMP becomes 0 and QMN
will be close to 0. Transistor Ep1 will be activated when φ
switches from 1 to 0. At the same time the recharge transistor

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper we have presented high-speed low-voltage
static Flip-Flop and different master latch conﬁgurations.
Different low power master latch conﬁgurations are pre-
sented. The data to output delay for the ultra low-voltage
Flip-Flop is signiﬁcantly reduced compared to conventional
CMOS Flip-Flop and sense ampliﬁer Flip-Flop. The Flip-
Flops is designed for ultra low-voltage digital systems, i.e.
supply voltages below 0.5V. Compared to conventional Flip-
Flops the delay of the proposed Flip-Flop is reduced to less
than 50%.
