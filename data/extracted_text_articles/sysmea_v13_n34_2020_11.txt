Abstract - In this paper, a sputtering ceramic target based on 
SnO2 doped with 2 at.% Co was synthesized by solid-phase 
reaction method. A chemiresistive alcohol vapor sensor based 
on SnO2<Co> was manufactured by the high-frequency 
magnetron sputtering method. The alcohol sensing properties 
of the SnO2<Co> sensor under the ultraviolet (UV) 
illumination were examined at room temperature (RT). The 
UV-assisted alcohol sensor showed a sufficient response to low 
concentrations of alcohol vapor at RT. The Co-doped SnO2 
sensor has also demonstrated a high sensitivity to alcohol 
vapors at elevated operating temperature. The impedance 
characteristics of the sensors have been also thoroughly 
studied. It is expected that in the future, Co doped SnO2 based 
sensitive thin films will be able to be utilized in highly sensitive, 
real-time alcohol vapor sensors.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Today, alcohol vapor sensors have a great demand in 
various fields. Ethanol sensors are used in the food industry, 
medicine and biotechnology. Ethanol sensors are also 
extremely important during the production of ethanol and 
alcoholic drinks to monitor the beverage quality. They are 
used in processes such as: food–packaging, clinical analysis, 
agronomic, vinicultural and veterinary analysis, also toxic 
waste and contamination analysis, fuel processing, Trends in 
Analytical Chemistry (TRAC) management and societal 
applications, as well as chemical processing in industry [1]-
[6]. Several methods and strategies have been reported for 
the detection of ethanol, e.g., gas chromatography, liquid  
chromatography, refractometry and spectrophotometry, 
semiconductor gas sensors and so on [3] [7] [8]. 
The solid-state gas sensors based on Metal Oxide 
Semiconductors (MOSs) with different nanostructures have 
played an important role in environmental monitoring, 
domestic and car safety, control in chemical processing due 
to their distinct advantages, such as simple implementation, 
low cost, high sensitivity, stability and reproducibility, low 
detection limit, easy production, nontoxicity, easy-achieved 
real-time response and compatibility with micro-fabrication 
processes [9]-[11]. Various MOSs materials, such as SnO2, 
In2O3, WO3, ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3, CuO, Ga2O3, CTO (CrTiO) 
with different nanostructures and dopant have been studied 
and showed promising results for detecting Volatile Organic 
Compounds (VOCs) [12]. Among these materials, the SnO2 
has good electrical and chemical properties. It is an n-type 
semiconductor with tetragonal rutile structure and it has a 
large energy band gap of 3.6 eV at 300 K. It has been 
widely exploited as an ultrasensitive gas sensor for the 
detection of carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia, ozone, 
carbon dioxide, hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide, nitrogen 
dioxide, ethanol and so on [13]-[15]. The wide range of 
possible applications has attracted many researchers to work 
on this material with different nanostructures, such as 
nanograins, nanorods, nanowires and nanofibers synthesized 
by various methods. It has a high sensitivity to reducing and

oxidizing gases, fast response and recovery behavior and 
low sensitivity to humidity [16]-[18]. 
Although many conductometric gas sensors made of 
MOSs have been commercialized for the last decades, a lot 
of problems still need to be solved in order to improve the 
performance of gas sensing devices. The main issues are 
related to sensitivity, selectivity and stability but the 
lowering of sensor’s operating temperature is still one of the 
main concerns. Resistive metal oxide based gas sensors 
normally operate at an elevated temperature (in a range of 
200 ºC to 400 ºC). This results in higher power 
consumption, limits the use of the sensor in explosive 
environments, and causes difficulties for the sensor to be 
attached to electrical systems [19] [20].  
There are many studies aimed at applying new 
technologies and reducing operating temperatures. To 
ensure a low operating temperature, several techniques have 
been used, such as doping the metal oxides with additives, 
using catalytic particles, applying a high electric field across 
the sensor terminals and illuminating the sensors with UV 
radiation [21] [22]. The irradiation of UV-assisted MOS 
sensors is an important alternative to activate chemical 
reactions on the metal oxide surface and reduce the 
resistance of the thin sensing layer instead of the more 
common use of energy-demanding heating. Almost 
completely replacing the effect of thermal energy, UV 
irradiation greatly influences the adsorption and desorption 
processes of the gas on the semiconductor surface 
enhancing their reactivity with the analyte gas. Under the 
influence of UV illumination, as a result of the formation of 
electron–hole pairs, more neutral atoms and molecules of 
absorbed oxygen on the surface of the semiconductor 
become ions, which then interact with analyte gas. UV 
irradiation can also be used to clean the active surface of a 
gas sensing layer, but the more important function is to 
improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the gas sensor by 
reducing the operating temperature. If it is not possible to 
lower the operating temperature to RT by using UV 
irradiation, UV irradiation combined with heating can be 
used to stimulate the gas sensor [23]-[25]. 
In this paper, we focus on low temperature sensing of 
SnO2 based thin film sensors under UV illumination. In 
Section II, the fabrication steps of SnO2<Co> sensor are 
presented. In Section III, the studies of sensing properties of 
UV assisted ethanol sensor are presented. In Section IV, the 
gas sensing mechanisms are explained. The conclusions are 
outlined in Section V. The sensor exhibited good sensitivity 
to low concentration of ethanol vapors. Fabricated sensors 
have also sufficient selectivity and stability over time. 
II. SENSOR FABRICATION 
Sensitive layers based on SnO2<Co> were deposited by 
the RF magnetron sputtering technique. Firstly, appropriate 
quantities of the corresponding metal oxide powders 
(SnO2+2 at.%Co2O3) were weighed and mixed thoroughly 
for 10 hours. Then, the mixture was subjected to pre-heat 
treatment at 800 0C for 5 hours (the initial annealing 
temperature was chosen based on the composition of the 
compound). The preheating of mixed powder eliminates the 
moisture of the metal oxide raw materials, which facilitates 
homogeneous mixing and milling of the powders (when the 
ceramic tablet is made of dry powders, it reduces the 
probability of the formation of mechanical cracks during 
final annealing). Then, the mixed powder was milled for 20 
hours until becoming fully homogeneous and pressed (with 
2000 N/cm2 pressure) in a form of a tablet (with 50 mm 
diameter). The sputtering ceramic target based on SnO2 
doped with 2 at.% Co (using the pressed tablet) was 
synthesized by solid-phase reaction method using thermal 
treatment in the atmosphere by the programmable furnace 
Nabertherm, HT O4/16 (with the controller of C 42). The 
final annealing was carried out at temperature range of 
500 °C-1100 °C 
for 
20 
hours. 
The 
synthesized 
semiconductor solid solution was subjected to mechanical 
treatment in order to eliminate surface defects. So, a smooth 
and parallel target with a diameter of 40 mm and thickness 
of 2 mm was prepared as a magnetron sputtering target (see 
Figure 1).  
The thin sensing layers were deposited on Multi-Sensor-
Platforms by the RF magnetron sputtering method using 
synthesized SnO2<Co> target. The Multi-Sensor-Platforms 
were purchased from TESLA BLANTA (Czech Republic). 
The platform has a temperature sensor (Pt 1000) for 
controlling the operating temperature. There are platinum 
heater and interdigitated electrodes on the ceramic substrate 
of the Multi-Sensor-Platform (see Figure 2). The heater and 
temperature sensor were covered with an insulating glass 
layer. Gas sensitive SnO2<Co> layer was deposited onto the 
non-passivated electrode structure, so the Multi-Sensor-
Platform was converted into a gas sensor. Then, palladium 
catalytic particles are deposited on the surface of the 
magnetron sputtered sensing layer the by ion-beam 
sputtering method for sensitization of the active layer. The 
working conditions of the high-frequency magnetron 
sputtering and ion-beam sputtering are presented in Table I 
(the base pressure was 2×104 Pa for both cases). The 
manufactured sensors were annealed in the air at 350 °C for 
4 hours for homogenization of sensing films and stabilizing 
their parameters. The fabrication steps of photo-assisted gas 
sensors are presented in Figure 1. 
The thickness of the SnO2<Co> thin film was measured 
by the Alpha-Step D-300 (KLA Tencor) profiler. The result 
of the study of the film-substrate transition profile is shown 
in Figure 3. The thickness of the SnO2<Co> film was equal 
to 180 nm. 
The electrical and gas sensing properties of the 
SnO2<Co> thin layer was measured using a home-made 
computer-controlled gas testing system. The testing system 
has 
a 
test 
chamber, 
pressure 
sensor 
(Motorola-
MPX5010DP) and a data acquisition system (PCLD-8115) 
[26]. For measurement of alcohol vapor concentration, the 
SnO2<Co> based sensor (the Multi-Sensor-Platform) was 
attached in the test chamber connecting the six pins (two 
pins of temperature sensor, two pins of heater and two pins 
of resistance measurement electrodes, see Figure 2) with the 
corresponding inputs on sensor holder. The UV LED 
(λ=365 nm) was attached 0.5 cm away from the active layer 
with an illumination of 2 mW/cm2. The gas sensing

properties of the SnO2<Co> sensor was measured at RT in 
the dark and under UV illumination. The response of the 
sensor was also measured at 200 0C operating temperature 
in the dark. The working temperature of the sensor was 
adjusted by changing the voltage across the platinum heater. 
To have the necessary concentration of  alcohol vapor in the 
chamber, the liquid ethanol was introduced into the chamber 
on the special hot plate designed for the quick conversion of 
the liquid ethanol to the gas phase. The response of the 
sensor is defined as [(Ra-Rg)/Ra]×100 %, where Ra and Rg 
are the electrical resistances of active layer in air and target 
gas, respectively.

GAS SENSING PERFORMANCES 
Initially, we tested the influence of the UV illumination 
on the baseline resistance of the SnO2<Co> sensor at RT. It 
can be seen from Figure 4 that the value of R0/RUV (~350) 
ratio is larger than 1, indicating the decrease of the sensor 
baseline resistance under UV illumination.  
 
 
Figure 4.  Resistance variation of the Co-doped SnO2 sensing layer under 
the influence of UV irradiation at RT. 
UV rays generate free carrier in the semiconductor, as a 
result of which the baseline resistance decreases (These 
processes are discussed in more detail in Section III). The 
response time of the Co-doped SnO2 thin film under UV 
irradiation is a few minutes.

The manufactured sensor is resistive and its operation is 
grounded on changes of resistance of gas sensitive 
semiconductor layer under the influence of ethanol vapors 
caused by an exchange of charges between molecules of the 
semiconductor film and absorbed ethanol. The high 
operating temperature of these types of sensors is mainly 
due to the high activation energies of chemical reactions. 
For this reason, these types of sensors are mainly not 
sensitive at RT. The UV light promotes the gas adsorption 
and desorption on the surface of the semiconductor 
participating to the sensing mechanisms [24]. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Resistance variation of the SnO2<Co> sensor under the 
influence of UV irradiation at RT in the presence of 150 ppm ethanol 
vapors. 
The thin film SnO2<Co> based sensor did not show 
sensitivity to ethanol vapors at RT without UV irradiation. 
We measured the resistance variation (also the signal 
repeatability) of the SnO2<Co> sensor in the presence of 
ethanol vapors under the influence of UV irradiation at RT. 
The resistance of the thin film changes by almost 400 Ω in 
the presence of 150 ppm ethanol vapors (see Figure 5). 
 
 
Figure 6.  The SnO2<Co> sensor's response to 900 ppm of ethanol vapors 
under the influence of UV irradiation at RT.  
Sensor response and recovery times are in minutes and it 
is clear that recovery times are faster because UV light more 
stimulate the desorption processes from the surface of the 
sensing layer. 
Figure 6 shows the transient response of the SnO2<Co> 
sensor in the presence of ethanol vapors under UV light at 
RT. The response to 900 ppm ethanol vapors under UV 
illumination is sufficiently high (24 %).  
We extracted the response vs. concentration curve for 
the Co-doped SnO2 sensitive film. Figure 7 shows the 
dependence of response on the ethanol vapor concentration 
under the influence of UV irradiation at RT. The 
dependence has almost linear characteristic, which will 
allow not only to detect of ethanol vapors but also to 
accurately measure the low concentrations of this gas. 
 
 
Figure 7.  The dependence of response on the ethanol vapor concentration 
under the influence of UV irradiation at RT. 
The gas sensing properties of the Co-doped SnO2 sensor 
under the influence of ethanol vapors in dark conditions at 
high operating temperatures and under the influence of UV 
irradiation combined with heating were also studied. The 
sensor's responses to ethanol vapors at different operating 
temperatures were initially measured with UV irradiation.  
 
 
Figure 8.  The dependence of response on the operating temperature of the 
SnO2<Co> sensor under the influence of UV irradiation at the presence of 
300 ppm ethanol vapors. 
Figure 8 shows the dependence of response on the 
operating temperature of the SnO2<Co> sensor under the 
influence of UV irradiation at the presence of 300 ppm 
ethanol vapors. As expected, in the case of not very high 
operating temperatures (up to 200 0C), the increase in 
temperature is accompanied by an increase in the response,

because the chemical reactions at higher operating 
temperatures are faster and more efficient. 
 
 
Figure 9.  The SnO2<Co> sensor's responses to 300 ppm of ethanol vapors 
under the influence of UV irradiation at different operating temperature. 
The sensor's responses were also compared at different 
operating temperatures under the influence of UV 
irradiation in dark conditions. It should be noted that the 
sensor did not show sensitivity to alcohol vapors at 50 0C 
and 100 0C operating temperatures in dark conditions. The 
SnO2<Co> sensor's responses to 300 ppm of ethanol vapors 
under the influence of UV irradiation at 50 0C and 100 0C 
operating temperatures are presented in Figure 9 (At high 
operating temperatures, as we are dealing with higher 
response values, it is desirable to use an absolute response 
definition: Ra/Rg). The effect of the UV irradiation at these 
temperatures gave the sensor increased sensitivity and as 
expected, at 100 0C we had a higher response and shorter 
recovery and response times. 
 
 
Figure 10.  The SnO2<Co> sensor's responses to 300 ppm of ethanol vapors 
at 150 0C operating temperature in dark conditions and under the influence 
of UV irradiation. 
The SnO2<Co> sensor's responses to 300 ppm of ethanol 
vapors at 150 0C operating temperature in dark conditions 
and under the influence of UV irradiation are presented in 
Figure 10. The effect of the UV irradiation dramatically 
improves the speed and the response of the sensor. 
Since the maximum response in the observed operating 
temperature range (25-200 0C) was recorded at 200 0C 
operating temperature, the gas sensitivity characteristics of 
the sensor were studied in more detail at this temperature. 
The sensitive layer's resistance decreases more than 25 
times in the presence of 150 ppm ethanol vapors at 200 0C 
operating temperature (see Figure 11). The response and 
recovery times of the sensor at high operating temperatures 
are a few seconds. 
 
 
Figure 11.  Resistance variation of the SnO2<Co> sensor in the presence of 
150 ppm ethanol vapors at 200 °C operating temperature in dark 
conditions. 
The sensor showed sensitivity (Ra/Rg=3) to the 
extremely low concentrations (0.5 ppm) of ethanol vapors at 
200 0C operating temperature even in dark conditions. The 
presence of the UV irradiation increases the response to 3.5 
and reduces the recovery time (see Figure 12). 
 
 
Figure 12.  The SnO2<Co> sensor's responses to 0.5 ppm of ethanol vapors 
at 200 0C operating temperature in dark condition and under the influence 
of UV irradiation. 
Figure 13 shows the SnO2<Co> sensor's responses to 
different concentrations of ethanol vapors at 200 0C 
operating temperature under the influence of UV irradiation. 
The sensor's response to 300 ppm ethanol vapors is 75, 
which is extremely high. The response and recovery times

of the sensor at 200 0C operating temperature are a few 
seconds at relatively high concentrations (300 ppm and 
100 ppm) but, as the concentration decreases, the response 
times increase. It is assumed that, in the case of low 
concentrations, the saturation of the gas-sensitive surface 
with ethanol molecules occurs delayed, which leads to an 
increase in the response time of the sensor. 
 
 
Figure 13.  The SnO2<Co> sensor's responses to different concentrations of 
ethanol vapor at 200 0C operating temperature under the influence of UV 
irradiation. 
The response vs. concentration curve of the sensor was 
also extracted under the influence of UV irradiation at 
200 0C operating temperature (Figure 14). The dependence 
has almost linear characteristic at the concentration range of 
0.5 to 100 ppm, but in the case of higher concentration, we 
have a deviation from the initial linear curve. At higher 
concentration, the angle of the linear curve changes and it is 
expected, that it will also be linear (which will show our 
future experimental work).  
 
 
Figure 14.  The dependence of response on the ethanol vapor concentration 
under the influence of UV irradiation at 200 °C operating temperature.  
So, if it is not possible to lower the operating 
temperature to RT by using UV irradiation, UV irradiation 
combined with heating can be used to stimulate the gas 
sensor. At high operating temperature both in dark 
conditions and with UV irradiation, the sensor performance 
is quite promising but the power consumption of fabricated 
sensor at 200 0C is about 2.5 W. It is more than two orders 
high then the power consumption (24 mW) needed the 
sensor operating with UV irradiation at RT.  
The alcohol responses of the SnO2<Co> based sensor 
were also compared with those described in previous reports 
(Table II). Our UV-activated SnO2<Co> based sensor 
exhibits much lower working temperature and comparable 
ethanol response compared with the previously reported 
ethanol sensors with and without UV illumination. Our UV 
activated SnO2<Co> sensor displays better ethanol response 
to extremely low concentration (0.5 ppm) of ethanol than 
most of the reported oxide-based sensors under UV 
irradiation.

Figure 15 shows the Nyquist plots of SnO2<Co> sensor 
observed under dark condition and in the presence of UV 
irradiation at RT. The UV response is quite large presented 
by the deviation of the semicircular Nyquist plots. 
 
 
Figure 16.  The Nyquist plots of SnO2<Co> sensor observed in the air and 
in the presence of 300 ppm ethanol vapors at 50 0C operating temperature 
under the influence of UV irradiation.  
 
Figure 17.  The Nyquist plots of SnO2<Co> sensor observed in the presence 
of 300 ppm ethanol vapors at different operating temperatures without UV 
irradiation.  
The sensor did not show sensitivity to alcohol vapors at 
50 0C in dark conditions, but at this operating temperature 
under the influence of UV irradiation the response was 
significant. The Nyquist plots of the sensor observed in the 
air and in the presence of 300 ppm ethanol vapors at 50 0C 
operating temperature under the influence of UV irradiation 
are presented in Figure 16. The significant deviation of 
Nyquist plots at the presence of ethanol vapors was 
observed. 
The Nyquist plots of SnO2<Co> sensor observed in the 
presence of 300 ppm ethanol vapors at different operating 
temperatures under the influence of UV irradiation and in 
the dark condition are presented in Figure 17 and Figure 18. 
The semicircle plots were obtained for Nyquist impedance, 
which indicates that the diameter of the semicircles 
increased gradually when the temperature was decreased. It 
is assumed that the deviation of the semicircles from the 
zero point by the influence of UV irradiation is related to the 
direct effect of the UV-activated adsorption/desorption 
processes on the impedance properties.

of 300 ppm ethanol vapors at different operating temperatures under the

Figure 19.  The Nyquist plots of SnO2<Co> sensor observed in the presence 
of 300 ppm ethanol vapors at 200 0C operating temperature under dark

Figure 19 shows that Nyquist impedance of SnO2<Co>  
sensor recorded in the presence of 300 ppm ethanol vapors 
at 200 0C operating temperature under dark condition and in 
the presence of UV irradiation. The impact of the UV 
irradiation dramatically reduced the diameter of the 
semicircle by shifting the curve to lower ranges of the 
resistance. This is due to the change of the localized charges 
and free carriers concentration on the active surface of the 
semiconductor.

The frequency dependencies for the real and imaginary 
components of the impedance for the SnO2<Co> sensor 
were also extracted (see Figure 20 and Figure 21). The 
deflection of the curves under the influence of UV light in 
the case of the imaginary components of the impedance 
depends more on the frequency. It is clear from the 
Figure 21 that the deviation is more significant in the case of 
high frequencies. This is due to the fact that at high 
frequencies the capacitive properties of the sensitive film 
are revealed.

Figure 21.  Frequency dependencies for the imaginary component of the 
impedance for the SnO2<Co> in the presence of 300 ppm ethanol vapors at 
200 0C operating temperature under dark condition and in the presence of 
UV irradiation. 
Our future researches will focus not only on the study of 
the deviations of Nyquist plots of the SnO2<Co> sensor at 
the presence of ethanol vapors under the influence of UV 
irradiation, but also on the build of the sensor equivalent 
circuit, obtaining more comprehensive information about 
the gas-sensitive element. 
The sensor's responses to acetone and toluene vapors 
were also measured. The sensor showed negligible 
sensitivity to acetone vapors, but did not show any 
sensitivity to toluene vapors, thus, the sensor has a high 
selectivity in the presence of VOCs.  
The fabricated sensors can be also easily attached to 
modern Arduino systems for data extraction and evaluation. 
 
IV. 
GAS SENSING MECHANISM 
To explain the observed sensing behavior of the Co-
doped SnO2 sensor, the gas sensing mechanism under dark 
and UV light conditions has to be taken into account. The 
basis of the operation of conductometric sensors is the 
change in resistance under the effect of reactions taking 
place on the surface of the sensing layer [35]-[37]. The 
target gases (chemical species) interact with the sensitive 
layer and thus modulate its electrical conductance. The gas 
sensing mechanism includes consideration of the role of the 
chemisorbed oxygen. The initial exposure to air results in 
oxygen adsorption on the surface through transferring 
electrons from the conduction band to the adsorbed oxygen. 
The oxygen chemisorption means the formation of O2−, O− 
and O2
− species on the surface. They originate due to 
electrons which are captured by adsorbed neutral oxygen 
species on the surface of the oxide. For the n-type 
semiconductor the majority charge carriers are electrons and 
upon interaction with a reducing gas an increase in 
conductivity occurs [38]-[40]. The oxygen ions are adsorbed 
mainly molecularly (O2
−) in the absence of UV radiation 
and atomic oxygen ions (O− and O2−) may be formed on the 
surface of the illuminated sensor, as shown in the following 
reactions [24] [41]: 
 
O2 (gas) ↔ O2 (adsorbed)                                                            (1) 
 
O2 (adsorbed) + e− ↔ O−
2 (adsorbed)                                             (2) 
 
O2(gas) + e− (hv) ↔ O−
2 (adsorbed)                                              (3) 
 
O−
2 (adsorbed) + e−
(hv) ↔ 2O−
(adsorbed)                                       (4) 
 
O−
(adsorbed) + e−
(hv) ↔ O2−
(adsorbed)                                          (5) 
 
UV illumination changes the number of charge carriers 
on the surface of the film through exciting electrons from 
the material valence band to the conduction band, which 
results in a decrease in sensor resistance and an increase of 
the number of surface atomic oxygen ions. The oxygen 
chemisorption results in a modification of the space charge 
region toward depletion. 
Upon exposure to alcohol vapors, the ethanol molecules 
react with surface oxygen species and produce electrons, 
resulting in an increase of electrical conductance of the n-
type semiconductor (Co-doped SnO2 sensitive film). The 
appropriate reactions are expressed as follows [42]-[44]:

The continuous UV illumination promotes the formation 
of more atomic oxygen ions (O− and O2−) on the surface of 
the semiconductor, which leads to increased sensitivity.

CONCLUSION  
In summary, a simple technology has been used to 
manufacture semiconductor thin film sensor based on SnO2 
doped 
with 
2 at.% Co. 
The 
fabricated 
SnO2<Co> 
chemiresistive gas sensor showed a good sensitivity to 
different concentrations of ethanol vapor (from 150 to 
900 ppm) at  RT with the activation of low-powered UV 
LED (24 mW, 365 nm). The sensor also showed sensitivity 
to extremely low concentrations (0.5 ppm) of ethanol vapors 
at 200 0C operating temperature even in dark condition and 
the presence of the UV irradiation increases the response 
and reduces the recovery time. The sensor displayed a good 
signal repeatability and long-term stability. The sensor 
provides not only high response to ppm level of alcohol 
vapors but also significant deviation of Nyquist plots at the 
presence of alcohol vapors. These sensing characteristics 
made the present SnO2<Co> based sensor a promising 
candidate for practically detecting ethanol vapors at the 
temperature range of 25 to 200 0C.
