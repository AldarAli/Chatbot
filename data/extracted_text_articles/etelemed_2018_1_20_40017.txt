Abstract—In the present work, the relation between the level
of education of elderly people and their health and quality
of life has been studied. The studies have been performed in
Poland. The collected data have been analyzed using the World
Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF)
questionnaire (an abbreviated version of the WHOQOL-100), and
the Geriatric Depression Scale. In both cases, we have observed
a large inﬂuence of the education level on health. In most cases,
the higher the education, the more positive the results. A large
inﬂuence of the marital status on the overall quality of life and
general health of the Polish pensioners has also been observed.

INTRODUCTION
Naturally, the human health deteriorates with passing time.
What is the inﬂuence of different factors on this natural
process? For instance, Cho et al. consider such factors as
education and past life experiences on successful aging and
subjective well-being among oldest-old adults [1]. Johnson et
al. study the inﬂuence of education and personality on health in
the oldest old [2]. The authors also consider other factors, for
example physical activity [3][4] or the attendance of lectures
at the University of the Third Age [5]-[8], which help in
successful aging.
In the present work, we study the inﬂuence of the edu-
cation level and the marital status of elderly people on the
overall quality of life and general health. We also examine
the inﬂuence of the education on the level of depression. The
studies have been performed on a group of retired residents of
Poland.
In Section II we describe the methods. The results in the
form of maps obtained using the correspondence analysis and
the spine plots are shown in Section III. Section IV summarizes
the results.
II.
METHODS
The studies were performed from February 2017 to May
2017 in Bydgoszcz, the eighth largest city in Poland, about 350
000 citizens. The studied group consists of 289 retirees (186
females and 103 males). All the participants were evaluated us-
ing the Polish version of the World Health Organization Qual-
ity of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire [9][10]
and using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [11]. They
could declare their education as: elementary school, vocational
education, high school, or university education. We applied
the correspondence analysis for the graphical representation
of the results. Originally, this method was introduced by
Hirschfeld [12]. Later, the method has been improved by
many authors [13][14]. In these methods, one creates maps
in which the objects under consideration are represented by
points distributed in a speciﬁc way. Distances between these
points are related to properly deﬁned similarity classes of the
objects. Thus, by studying the distribution of the distances one
can classify the objects according to some selected similarity
criteria. This methodology may be applied in many areas of
science. In particular, we have recently created an analog of
this kind of approach in bioinformatics [15].
In this work, the points on the maps represent different
groups of individuals and their answers to questions. In order
to classify the set of studied individuals, we analyze the
distribution of the distances between the points representing
the answers and the points representing groups of individuals.
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figures 1, 2 and 3 show 2D-maps derived from the cor-
respondence analysis. They show the relations between the
general satisfaction of the retirees with the quality of life and
health and their age, marital status, and education, respectively.
There are two different kinds of points denoted in the maps.
Empty rectangles denote groups of individuals. In Figure 1,
empty rectangles correspond to the groups of individuals of
different age: 51-64; 65-79, and above 80. In Figure 2, these
symbols correspond to the groups with different marital status:

single, married, widowed, divorced, separated. In Figure 3, the
groups of individuals with different education are considered:
elementary school, vocational education, high school, and uni-
versity education. Full circles denote answers to the questions
in the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire about overall quality of
life and general health. One can choose between ﬁve answers
denoted in the ﬁgure as A-1, A-2,...A-5. A-1 corresponds to
the least favorable quality of life and A-5 to the most favorable
one.
As expected, the closest point to A-5 is the youngest group
51-64. The oldest group 80 - – estimates its overall quality of
life and general health as the worst compared to other groups
(Figure 1).
Considering the marital status, the group married estimates
its overall quality of life as the best compared to other groups
and widowed as the worst (Figure 2).
Considering the education, the closest point to A-5 is
university education. It means that this group of individuals
estimates their overall quality of life and general health as the
best compared to other groups. The closest point to A-1 is
elementary school (Figure 3).
Figures 4, 5 and 6 show the results obtained using the
Geriatric Depression Scale.
We used the 15-item version of GDS. The questions are
the following:
1)
Are you basically satisﬁed with your life? yes / no
2)
Have you dropped many of your activities and inter-
ests? yes / no
3)
Do you feel that your life is empty? yes / no

Answers in bold indicate depressive symptoms. Answer yes
means depressiveness in questions No: 2,3,4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15
(Figures 4 and 5). Answer no means depressiveness in all
other cases, i.e., questions No: 1,5,7,11,13 (Figure 6). For each
bolded answer is given 1 point.
A score greater than 5 points suggests mild depressive
symptoms. If the score is greater than 10 points it may
be depressive disorder. Such individual should be tested for
depression.
Figures 4, 5 and 6 show the spine-plots. The width is the
largest for high school so the largest number of individuals
declare this kind of education. The smallest number of in-
dividuals declare elementary school education (the smallest
width in the spine-plots). Dark color represents the answer no.
In all the questions in which answer ’no’ means depression
(1,5,7,11,13) the percentage of answers ’no’ is the largest for
individuals having elementary education compared to other
groups (Figure 6). Analogously, in other questions in which
answer ’yes’ indicates depression 2,3,4,8,10,12,14,15 also the
largest percentage of answers ’yes’ is for individuals with ele-
mentary education compared to other groups (Figures 4 and 5).
The exceptions are only two questions: No. 6 and 9. For these
questions, the answer ’yes’ indicates depressive symptoms. In
question No. 6 all the groups answer approximately in a similar
way. In question 9 the differences between groups are also not
large but vocational education has slightly larger percentage
of ’depressive’ answers (yes) comparing to other groups.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Summarizing, the education and the marital status strongly
inﬂuence the overall quality of life and general health. We have
also shown that among Polish elders, the depressive symptoms
are related to the education. Higher education represents an
important positive factor affecting this problem. Generally, the
higher the education, the better the overall quality of life and
health.
In future work, we will concentrate on studies related to
the inﬂuence of factors other than education on depressive
symptoms. In particular, we will check the signiﬁcance of sex
and marital status.
