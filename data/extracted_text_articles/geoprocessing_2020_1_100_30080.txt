Abstract— This paper applies geospatial data analytics to 
explore trends in premature mortality in the United States. 
Premature mortality, or Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL), 
is one of the public health measures that focuses on deaths that 
happened at younger ages (before the age of 75 years) and thus 
could have been prevented.  We used publicly available YPLL 
data for 2005-2016 for 3080 United States counties with spatio-
temporal data mining tools in Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS) software to create a space-time cube and to find 
temporal trends in this measure. Our preliminary results 
indicate that 22% of counties experienced a statistically 
significant upward trend in YPLL, 24% experienced a 
statistically significant downward trend, and the remaining 
54% did not experience any monotonic trend in YPLL 
measure. These findings can help county-level department of 
public health with developing targeted interventions to reverse 
upward trends in YPLL measure.

 INTRODUCTION  
Premature mortality, or Years of Potential Life Lost 
(YPLL)  is one of the public health measures that focuses on 
deaths that happened at younger ages (in the United States, 
before the age of 75 years) and thus could have been 
prevented.  The Center for Disease Control collects annual 
county-level mortality data and provides state-level analysis. 
However, more detailed, local-level analysis is needed in 
order to conduct surveillance of temporal trends in 
premature mortality, and to evaluate the effectiveness of 
program interventions [1]. The goal of this paper is to 
identify temporal trends in premature mortality in the 
United States, using county-level data and space-time 
techniques in Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  The 
rest of the paper is organized as follows:  Section II provides 
a description of our data sources and methods. Section III 
reports our preliminary results, and Section IV discusses 
future research steps. 
II. 
DATA AND METHODS 
The YPLL measure was obtained from the County Health 
Rankings website [2] for 2005-2016. Since premature 
deaths are relatively rare events, YPLL is based on a three-
year period, rather than on a single year.  In this dataset, 
YPLL is a rate per 100,000 people and is age- adjusted to 
the 2000 US population. The rate is calculated as the 
number of total years of potential life lost for deaths that 
occurred amongst people who reside in a county under age 
75, divided by the aggregate population under age 75 for the 
three years.  The number of years lost is calculated for each 
death individually, and is based on the age at the time of 
death. The younger the person, the higher the number of 
years lost. To map the YPLL data, the GIS layer of county 
boundaries was downloaded from the U.S. Census Bureau 
[3] and YPLL tables were joined to the GIS layer using 
county Federal Information Processing Standards codes. 
There are 3142 counties in the United States, but 62 of them 
were missing YPLL data. 
To identify spatio-temporal trends in YPLL, first, a 
space-time cube was created in ArcGIS Pro [4]. A space-
time cube is a collection of spatial units (in this case, 
counties) layered vertically according to time. The bottom 
layer of the cube corresponds to 2005, the earliest year in 
the dataset, and the top layer of the cube corresponds to 
2016, the latest year. Thus, a particular county at a given 
year is referred to as a bin within the space-time cube.   
We applied the Mann-Kendall trend test to identify 
statistically significant temporal trends in YPLL for each 
spatial bin. This test compares values within each spatial bin 
over time and calculates changes between each consecutive 
time steps [5]. It identifies consistently increasing or 
decreasing trends over time at a location. Previous research 
applied this technique to analyze temporal trends in ground 
water level and precipitation [6]-[8], aridity [9], air 
temperature [10], traffic accidents [11] and crime [12]. We 
apply this widely used technique in a new context related to 
human health.  
The output from the Mann-Kendall test is a spatial layer 
showing each spatial bin belonging to one of  the seven 
categories: Up trend – 99% confidence; Up trend – 95% 
confidence; Up trend –90% confidence; Down trend – 99% 
confidence; Down trend – 95% confidence; Down trend –
90% confidence;  No significant trend. The confidence level 
is determined based on the z score and the p-value of the 
trend.  
To visualize the trends, we mapped seven trend 
categories and calculated the number of counties within 
each category.

RESULTS 
To create the space-time cube, we first created a separate 
YPLL map for each year. An example of such map is 
provided in Figure 1.  
 
 
 
Figure 1. Premature mortality  rate in continental United States in 2016. 
 
Then, we combined all eleven maps into a space-time 
cube.  It consisted of 3080 locations (counties) and 11 time 
slices, resulting in 33880 space-time bins. The minimum, 
mean, and maximum values of YPLL in the cube were 
2817, 7963 and 35147 years/100,000 people, respectively.  
The Mann-Kendall test results are shown in Table 1 and 
Figure 2.

These results indicate that 684 (22%) 
counties 
experienced a statistically significant upward trend in 
YPLL, 753 (24%) counties experienced a statistically 
significant downward trend, and the remaining 1643 (54%) 
counties did not experience any monotonic trend in YPLL 
measure. These findings are important, as they highlight 
areas with the alarming trend (statistically significant 
increase in YPLL rates over time) and can help local 
departments of public health develop targeted interventions 
to reverse these trends.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we identified temporal trends in premature 
mortality in the United States, using county-level data and 
space-time techniques in Geographic Information Systems. 
Our preliminary results indicate that in each state, there are 
counties with both upward and downward YPLL trends, 
sometimes next to each other. As the next step, it would be 
important to select several states for an in-depth analysis of 
the relationship between socio-economic and demographic 
factors and health outcomes to gain a better understanding 
of factors related to local variations in YPLL rate. This work 
could provide additional insights for more effective public 
health interventions.
