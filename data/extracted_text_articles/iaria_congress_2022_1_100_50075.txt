Abstract - The paradigm change towards digitalization in
industries has been a huge hype for years. The Internet of
Things, Industry 4.0, and recently Digital Twins, are the
buzzwords that every practitioner notices in the manufacturing
industry. However, how to make real business after the hype?
The ongoing international research is developing the utilization
of machine operations data as a basis for Digital Twins. Digital
Twins are the digital replications of real industrial machines.
New industrial services and new earning logics can be created,
but it takes time to get a real business going with digitalization.
This study presents the findings from multiple case studies in
Europe and discusses the business opportunities related the
Digital Twin concept.

INTRODUCTION
Data based industrial services are still hard to realize in
practice, despite the fact that there is plenty of hype around
Industry 4.0 and related concepts [1]. However, in the future
of the industrial service systems, value creation will be data
driven, as there has now been many digitalization initiatives
and development activities in manufacturing industries
globally [2]. In some sectors, individual companies already
generate more than 50% of their revenue and 100% of their
profit with their service businesses [3]. The servitization trend
is still today continuing in manufacturing industries and will
become the norm across the industry over the next few years
[3]. By 2030, companies will sell most equipment as part of
bundled solutions including software and services, reducing
the hardware’s share of total profits [3].
A Digital Twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a
physical object, product or process, or even factory [4]. The
level of data integration marks the difference of DT compared
to the concept of Digital Model (DM), sometimes called a
Virtual Model (VM), and the concept of Digital Shadow (DS)
[4]. These mentioned concepts are often used synonymously.
The digital representation can be modeled manually, without
connection to a real physical counterpart. Alternatively,
digital representation can be done fully automated way. DM
is realized manually, with a manual data exchange flow. DS
has an automatic data flow from the physical object towards
the digital object, but the reverse data flow is manual. The data
flow between an existing physical object and a digital object
fully integrated in both directions is referred to as DT [4].
Multiple DTs are a real-time integrated combination of many
physical objects and their digital objects. This paper uses the
DT concept to refer to fully automated data exchange between
real physical object and its digital replication. Therefore,
because of real-time and automated data exchange, DTs can
be the basis of new kinds of industrial services with entirely
new value offerings. Often digitalization helps the machine
manufacturer themselves, but the added customer value is just
a nice to know or a nice to have type of benefit. The real
benefit, which a customer is willing to pay for is hardly
achieved. The purpose of this paper is to explore DT-based
industrial service opportunities and examine how to develop
and commercialize DT-based services successfully. The
nature of the study is conceptualization. However, it does not
focus on technologies for realizing DT, data analytics or data
connection technologies. Today Artificial Intelligence (AI)
can be used for data analytics, machine operation simulations
and maintenance optimization. The rest of the paper is
structured as follows. Section II defines the used research
approach and methodologies. Section III presents the study
findings. We conclude our work in Section IV.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH
This study is a part of an international project focused on
researching the new service opportunities provided by the DT
concept in several industrial use cases. The project includes
three machine manufacturing companies, one automotive
supplier with an operative production line, seven software
development partners, three universities and two research
institutes that represent three different business ecosystems in
three countries. The empirical data is gathered by semi-
structured interviews with company practitioners, which
research organization facilitated workshops developed
further. The findings of company interviews were used as a
basis for understanding the current stage and the future
business potential of digital twin enabled services. Next,
several workshops were conducted to map the service
processes of the use cases in three ecosystems in Finland,
Turkey and the Netherlands. The ecosystem partners are listed
in Table I below, and more detailed information is available
at the project website [5].

The workshops were held remotely using Microsoft
Teams due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the
limitations to travel. The methods for conducting the
workshops in each ecosystem were customized to correspond
the specific background of the consortiums. Customer
Journey Mapping was used for identifying the actual customer
view of DT services within the ecosystems [6] and the Service
Blueprinting method for understanding the roles and
responsibilities within the service ecosystems [7]. A total
number of ten interviews and workshops were organized
within the ecosystems. The details of data collection

A literature study and benchmarking studies enriched the
empirical findings [8][9]. Two research questions were
formulated: 1) How can the Digital Twins boost value creation
in the industrial product-service lifecycle, and 2) Which kinds
of business models are needed in the future digitalized
industrial contexts. The research questions are related to the
main theme of this paper, namely are the DT services real

business or just hype? The study discusses the business
potential and business development challenges related to the
DT concept.
III.
FINDINGS
Digitalization has reached a mature level in industries, as
the companies have modern Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) tools for supporting operations. Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) solutions are today cloud based
software, available everywhere and support many kinds of
industrial operations, not only production. Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) software supports every
kind of customer interaction from marketing, to sales and
aftersales. For service operations, like installation and
maintenance, markets offer dedicated solutions. Every kind of
documentation can be managed in the digital format. The
latest trend of Industry 4.0 brings the Internet of Things (IoT)
to manufacturing industry. Cheap sensors and connectivity
solutions create many opportunities to collect real-time data
from machines which supports decision making related
operations and maintenance. Data itself is not valuable, but the
information gathered from the data using analytics and
visualization is. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine
learning can be utilized for data analytics, operative
predictions and maintenance optimization. Generally, today
all industrial operations can be digitalized. However, these
mentioned 
solutions 
mostly 
support 
manufacturing
companies internally, and the value of the software solutions
is clear for the manufacturers themselves. The customer value
is questionable, as it is not clear how digitalization helps the
customers who are using the machines. Customer
understanding is the key for success. Which kind of
information does the customer need? Do they need
information at all or are they just interested in operational
efficiency or the minimized downtime of the machines? In
many cases, the answer is yes. The data collected by the
machine manufacturer, when the customer operates with the
machine, should be turned to a customer value proposition.
The value proposition is dependent on the case and customer
[10]. The data can be used for DT, the digital replication of
the machine. Then, the DT can be used as a basis for a value
proposition for customers. According to our case studies,
typically, value is created in the selling, installation and
operations, and maintenance phases of the machine lifecycle.
The following subsections describe the main findings from the
case studies in the different lifecycle stages.
A. The selling stage
The selling stage includes machine ordering and planning
of the service delivery. The main actions in this stage demand
a lot of interaction between the customer and the
manufacturing 
company. 
In 
the 
selling 
stage, 
the
identification of potential customers for DT enabled services,
arguing the value propositions of DT enabled services to the
customers and helping them to make a positive purchasing
decision take place. Based on the machine design data, DT
visualizes the machine for the customer. Surely, DT is not a
sellable or monetized service in the selling stage, but DT can
have positive enabler role for buying decision.
B.  The installation and operation stage
At this stage, collecting and processing data plays a pivotal
role. In the installation and operation stage, the main activity
is ensuring Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) by
making sure that all necessary software is functioning as
expected and that is updated accordingly. DT can support
installation when all requested documentations can be
achieved via DT, and machine operational setup can be
simulated with DT to ensure operations at the customer site.
Training at the customer site can utilize virtual replication of
the real world by using Virtual Reality glasses and 3D models
of the machine and the surrounding factory environment. In
this stage, all actors (the customer, the manufacturing
company offering digital twin enabled services and the service
development partners) have a great role and seamless
cooperation and communication between the actors is very
important. Our case studies have identified the following
operation phase benefits where the DT has a strong supporting
or enabling role (in random order):

Machine works as expected (availability guarantee, e.g.,
98%)

Formally proves what is wrong and proves what has been
fixed

Detailed view from each component on what has gone
wrong

Time savings, money savings

Just in time delivery support

New business model opportunities for the machine
manufacturer because of a detailed view of how the
machine operates

Simplifies the job of the machine users: Less time needed
on the daily work activities and more time available on
the non-daily activities, e.g., “operator being more a
manager”. Operator work content can be moved towards
operations planning, production scheduling and other
activities than they do today. The DT can support
organizational changes in the future.

For moving robots, DT supports route planning, as well
as management of unexpected situations in operations

Higher quality and traceability of the final products

Easier for the customer to know what happens inside the
machines

Improved interaction with the customer

The customer is able to have customized views (control
room/ Human-Machine Interface (HMI) solutions) of the
factory and machine situation for different users
(production managers, machine operators, service
personnel).

The customer is able to visualize in a real-time what the
machine is doing

Reduced waiting time and faster time to market by
generating 
new 
operation 
schedules 
(optimized
operations based on the DT) for the system
Generally, the digital twin is used as a communication tool
to enable the interaction at the machine, line, factory, or
ecosystem level. The customer benefits include improvements
in safety (e.g., product safety and occupational safety),
51

improvement in product delivery efficiency, improvement in
the reliability of operations, improvement in product quality,
and financial factors, such as savings in operative costs.
C. The maintenance stage
In the maintenance stage, the main focus is on predictive
maintenance activities enabled by the digital twin. On a
general level, the key customer benefit is maintenance
downtime optimization. Prediction, in general, tends to be
highlighted as one of the key benefits of the digital twin-
enabled 
service across 
the 
service 
process 
stages.
Communication and data exchange within the diverse levels
of digital twin implementation play an important role.  If the
machine is a critical part of the customer’s operation or
production line, DT is even more important for ensuring
successful maintenance operations. The main activities of the
software partners are to make sure that the software works as
it should and that it provides accurate information related to
the machine, machine fleet or the entire factory. The main
activities of the manufacturing companies offering DT-based
services are to make sure that the preventive activities based
on the information enabled by the digital twin are done
accordingly. The main activity of the customers is to let the
maintenance activities take place in order for their downtime
to be minimized and their operations to run with full
operational rate. Below is a summary of preventive
maintenance and modernization possibilities with the DT:

Easiness for the customer when service operations are
well planned and predicted

Time savings in service operations

Fewer ad hoc situations

Added revenue for the customer can be collected from the
end-users by providing updates

Make sure that the software system is without any errors
(simulations with DT)

New business model for services/maintenance: Make a
model that provides constant updates for end-users
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
Because of the growing volume, complexity, and strategic
importance of data in industry, manufacturers need to create
DT-based services together with selected strategic partners.
The participants of future digital twin-enabled service
operations are forming an industrial ecosystem with multiple
actors and roles. Actors are needed to fulfil dedicated tasks
when delivering digital twin solutions with and to different
stakeholders. The realization of DT requires new kinds of
competencies, because of the need for data analytics,
visualization, simulations and other functionalities that might
be new for manufacturers. Therefore, collaboration is needed
between manufacturers and SW providers to consolidate data
collection, aggregation and analytics for making data and
insights available across different business functions and
units. These mentioned tasks need many kinds of individual
roles from the employees. Roles can be considered as action-
oriented tasks, like connectors, identity verifiers or service
provides. As part of a customer’s personnel, there are, e.g.,
persons responsible for production, different levels of
managers, procurement personnel and service engineers. The
most apparent roles in a manufacturing company are e.g.,
sales, maintenance, training and engineering staff taking part
in the DT enabled service operations. The ecosystem
orchestrator role is also something that is currently being
discussed to determine whether, in the future, there should or
could be one actor that is responsible for selling the total DT
enabled service solution to the customer with one-stop-shop
principle. So far, there is no such actors in the manufacturing
industry.
Unique and new value propositions can be formulated
with DT. However, while sellable services are not easily done,
there are many commercialization opportunities in DT-based
services. Business strategies should be updated when
investing in DT-based service offerings. In the end, an entire
new business model is needed for the manufacturers. As the
value proposition change, new outsourced SW elements are
needed and the customer base needs to be segmented
differently, since traditional customers might not be interested
in DT offerings.
A. Practical implications
This paper highlights the DT-based service opportunities
and challenges. A new understanding is needed on how to
develop economically sustainable service offerings with the
data and with multiple DTs of products. The study presented
promising results, but realization in each case is dependent on
the DT level of detail. With systematic development steps, a
successful DT-based service business can be realized.
Practitioners need to think about existing competencies within
the company, and make or buy decisions are needed for
realizing DT-based services in practice.
B. Research limitations
The present study has limitations that need to be taken into
account. The phenomenon of utilizing DTs in industrial
service development is very extensive and complex and this
study approached this phenomenon from a rather narrow
empirical perspective with three manufacturing ecosystems in
three different countries. However, by understanding these
particular cases in more depth, we eventually learned about
the greater phenomenon of DT-based service development in
the industrial context. Practical evidence of multiple DTs is
still limited, as multiple DTs were not in an operative
environment within the case examples.
C. Future research
Future research will focus on the development of a new
frame of reference for the service business innovations based
on DT and future business models in manufacturing
industries. The service business development model will be
updated, i.e., by Service Development Phases [11]. With the
updated step-by-step service development phases, an entire
business model can be made more competitive. A very
promising concept spinning out from this research project is
the Digital Twin Web (DTW). The DTW is a network of
digital twins formed by DT documents that describe the
contents of DTs and the relationships between the DTs. The
DTW concept can support multiple DT realizations in

practice. Factory DT and Ecosystem DT can benefit from
DTW, but so far, the DTW’s relation to industrial services is
unclear and, therefore, needs to be studied in the future.
