Abstract— Instant messaging apps are experiencing a 
significant upturn in recent years in mobile devices. This paper 
shows the results of applying a systematic evaluation of these 
applications on iOS platform that was performed to identify 
their main usability issues. As a result of this evaluation some 
guidelines for improving the usability of these applications are 
proposed, such as a carefully designing the interface or not 
exceeding more than eight (and preferably not more than six) 
interactions to perform the main tasks. The results and the 
guidelines proposed will help in the future to create more 
effective mobile applications for instant messaging.

 INTRODUCTION 
The increased use of mobile devices [1]  has led to the 
number of applications (apps) available in mobile markets 
has also increased significantly in recent years, such as 
instant messaging (IM) apps, which have become ubiquitous 
in contemporary society. To increase the chances of an app 
to be chosen by users among many others it is essential that 
it has a good usability. It is important to study usability in 
desktop applications, but it is even more important to study it 
in mobile apps because mobile devices have some 
limitations when compared to personal computers (PC) [2] 
[3], such as small-sized screens, limited input mechanisms, 
battery life, etc. These characteristics make necessary 
studying usability for mobile devices separately from 
usability for PCs. 
A mechanism for systematic evaluation (also called 
protocol) was created by Martin et al. [4] for studying 
usability in existing mobile apps, and consists of five steps: 
(1) Identify all potentially relevant applications, (2) remove 
light or old versions of each application, (3) identify the 
primary operating functions and exclude all applications that 
do not offer this functionality, (4) identify all secondary 
functionality and (5) test the main functionalities using the 
following methods: Keystroke-Level Modeling (KLM) for 
estimating the time taken to complete each task to provide a 
measure of efficiency of the applications [5] [6] and Mobile 
Usability Heuristics (MUH) for identifying more usability 
problems using a usability heuristic evaluation. 
Since mobile IM apps are becoming widely used in 
recent years, it is especially important to study the most 
common usability problems in this kind of apps, in order to 
get some guidelines or good practices for developers of 
mobile IM apps. This paper shows a systematic evaluation of 
instant messaging apps and the results obtained during this 
evaluation. Finally, some recommendations are proposed 
from a viewpoint of mobile usability. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 shows the 
evaluation carried out and the results obtained in the 
systematic evaluation. Section 3 presents a discussion of the 
results with previous work and, finally, Section 4 explains 
the recommendations and conclusions obtained from the 
results. 
II. 
EVALUATION AND RESULTS 
This section shows the systematic evaluation carried out 
and the different results obtained in the steps. iOS platform 
(an iPhone 4) was used along the evaluation steps. 
A. Steps 1 to 4 
In the first step, potential and relevant applications 
available in the iOS app store were identified. The “instant 
messaging” term was used to search in the app market. As a 
result, 243 applications were classified as potential 
applications. 
In the second step, the applications that were not fully 
functional (i.e., demos, lite or trials) were removed from the 
list of potential applications. In all, 20 applications (8%) 
were removed from the initial list. 
An application can be considered as instant messaging 
when it meets all the main functionalities, which were 
defined in Step 3 as follows: 
 
Task 1 (T1). Send an instant message to a specific 
contact ([7]). 
 
Task 2 (T2). Read and reply an incoming message 
([7]). 
 
Task 3 (T3). Add a contact ([7]). 
 
Task 4 (T4). Delete/Block a contact (derived from [8] 
and [9]). 
 
Task 5 (T5). Delete chats ([10]). 
Once the main functionalities were detected and defined, 
the applications that did not meet all these requirements were 
discarded. As a result, only 39 (18%) applications met the 
main functionalities to be considered as IM applications. 
In the fourth step, it was necessary to discover the 
secondary functionalities on the applications selected in the 
previous step (11 apps were discarded because they ran

anomaly with unrecoverable errors). The most common 
secondary functionalities detected were including a user 
profile avatar (74.36%), sending pictures (66.67%) and 
sending videos (64.10%), among others. 
B. Step 5-A: Keystroke-Level Modeling 
In this step, the remaining applications (28 apps in total) 
were reviewed in order to count the number of interactions 
(KLM) required to perform each of the main functionalities 
established in Step 3.

Table 1 only shows the top 10 with the fewest 
interactions; the minimum number of interactions for 
completing all tasks was 21 (Surespot encrypted messenger) 
and the app with maximum (39 interactions) was Spotbros 
app, but obviously it is not shown in Table 1. An average of 
6 interactions for each task can also be observed. 
In order to send a new message (task 1), the apps with 
fewer interactions (5 interactions) obtained these results by 
showing the keyboard automatically, although only 6 apps 
have this feature (WhatsApp, Tuenti, IM+ Pro7, Hike, 
Surespot and Kik). 
All analyzed apps required between 4 and 6 interactions 
to reply to a given message (task 2), except Spotbros, which 
required 8 interactions because chats were shown only when 
a button was pressed. The similarity in the number of 
interactions is because almost all applications had a section 
that contained the active chats grouped.  
The most variations were observed in task 3 (adding a 
contact): from 3 interactions (Surespot encrypted messenger) 
to 10 interactions (Tuenti and Spotbros). This is because 
some applications (11 of all apps analyzed) used the agenda 
of the mobile device and others used their own contact list, 
causing alternative implementations of this process, thus 
requiring extra data in some cases. 
Finally, for task 5 (deleting a chat) most of the examined 
apps required between 4 and 6 keystrokes, due to the similar 
implementation of the process. 
For the next step (5.B. heuristic evaluation), not all apps 
were selected to continue in the process. As in previous 
studies [11]-[13], the four applications with fewer 
interactions were selected for the next step. In this case, 
applications with the same number of interactions were 
considered as one. Therefore, 7 applications in total were 
selected: Surespot (21 interactions), Hike Messenger and 
HushHushApp (both 24 interactions), Kik Messenger, Hiapp 
Messenger and Touch (26) and WhatsApp Messenger (27). 
C. Step 5-B: Mobile Usability Heuristics 
In this step, the mobile usability evaluation using 
heuristics was performed. Six (6) experts carried out the 
evaluation with the 7 applications selected in the previous 
step. As Bastien [14] and Hwang and Salvendy [15] 
indicated, from 5 to 10 users participating in the evaluation is 
enough to detect at least 80% of the usability issues in 
software. The Mobile Heuristic Evaluation (MHE) method 
[2] is based on a study in which each expert checks whether 
each application meets or not a set of directives for usability, 
which includes directives about usability features of the 
application that the expert has to answer, expressing their 
opinion with a numeric value from 0 to 4 (where 0 indicates 
that there is no problem, and 4 indicates a catastrophic 
problem), which is known as Nielsen’s five-point Severity 
Ranking Scale [16], and they also had to justify their scores. 
The eight heuristics used were [2]: A (visibility of system 
status and losability / findability of the mobile device), B 
(match between system and the real world), C (consistency 
and mapping), D (good ergonomics and minimalist design), 
E (ease of input, screen readability and glancability), F 
(flexibility, efficiency of use and personalization), G 
(aesthetic, privacy and social conventions) and H (realistic 
error management). 
The results of the evaluation are shown in Table 2. 
Applications 
with 
lower 
values 
(i.e., 
more 
usable 
applications) 
had 
mostly 
cosmetic 
problems 
(small 
obstacles) or no problems. On the other hand, applications 
with higher values had mainly minor and major problems, 
obstacles that affect the functionality of the application in a 
regular use.

The mean of heuristics show that G heuristic is the one 
that got the worst score (Table 2), due to a (generally) bad 
interface design and the lack of privacy and security 
information. The second worst heuristic was C heuristic, 
mainly because in some apps some objects were not 
expected on the interface. On the other hand, H heuristic got 
the best results, thanks to the ease on editing incorrect inputs 
and also the ease on recovering from errors. The E heuristic 
was the second best rated because of the ease on entering 
numbers, as well as it shows a back button on the screens 
and (mainly) the ease on navigation through the screens. 
Finally, it is worth mentioning that a low number of 
interactions does not necessarily imply that the application 
has not usability problems. For instance, Hike messenger had 
24 interactions and was the second best app on KLM results, 
whereas it was the worst app according to the MHE results. 
This implies that both techniques should be applied in order 
to evaluate the usability of an application. 
III. 
DISCUSSION 
In this section, the results and analysis carried out will be 
discussed. Firstly, we could compare the results obtained 
with those from two similar studies performed using a 
similar method: one for spreadsheet apps [13] and another 
one for diabetes management apps [12]. 
Step 1 (potentially relevant applications) produced 23 
spreadsheet apps, 231 diabetes apps and we found 243 IM 
apps. The low number of apps in the spreadsheet study may 
be due to a more concrete term. Step 2 (delete light or old 
versions) discarded 9 (4.05%) diabetes apps and we 
discarded 20 (8.97%) IM apps. This variation may be due to 
IM apps are more popular. The analysis for spreadsheet apps 
does not indicate the number of discarded apps in step 2. 
Step 3 (identify main functionalities) got 12 (52.17% from 
step 1) spreadsheet apps, 8 (3.46%) diabetes apps and we 
obtained 39 (16.04%) IM apps. This difference can be due to 
the increasing number of applications or to the main 
functionalities chosen (different for each type of application). 
Step 5A (KLM analysis) revealed that, in average, the 
tasks in spreadsheet apps took between 2.1 and 4 
interactions, in diabetes apps they took between 3.16 and 
6.33 interactions and in IM apps they took between 4.2 and 
7.8 interactions. 
Regarding the MHE (Step 5B), the study on spreadsheet 
applications was not performed. In diabetes apps, the main 
usability issues detected were related to heuristics G and H, 
and related to IM apps were about heuristics B, C and G. 
These results on the heuristics suggest that the design is 
generally not good and it can be improved. 
The methodology used has a number of advantages [4, 
11], but it also has some disadvantages and limitations, for 
instance: some steps take a long time and can be tedious to 
perform, large number of elements in the initial stages, 
results are time sensitive, etc. Furthermore, detecting all 
usability issues in this kind of experiment is not possible 
because the context of use is not taken into account [3] [14] 
but, on the contrary, as a laboratory experiment there is more 
control over the usability issues detected. An important 
limitation of this study is that it was conducted only on the 
iOS platform. On other platforms, different results could be 
obtained. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
According to the results of the KLM, sending a message, 
replying to a message and adding contacts are usually the 
fastest functionalities to be completed. Moreover, deleting a 
contact or a chat usually becomes a serious problem. The 
applications with lower levels of interactions were (from 
lowest to highest) Surespot encrypted messenger, Hike 
Messenger, HushHushApp, Kik Messenger, Touch, Hiapp 
Messenger and WhatsApp Messenger. 
Regarding the Mobile Heuristic Evaluation with mobile 
experts, almost all applications had usability problems in 
performing the primary tasks. WhatsApp Messenger and 
HushHushApp obtained the best usability ratings. On the 
other hand, hike Messenger, Kik Messenger and Touch were 
negatively evaluated and presented critical usability, but did 
it well in KLM. This suggests that it is necessary to perform 
both the KLM and Heuristic Evaluation methods because if 
the results were based only in KLM the applications chosen 
would have many usability problems. 
After finishing the study, we can propose some 
recommendations to improve the usability of instant 
messaging apps in mobile devices. Firstly, based on the 
KLM 
results, 
we 
can 
suggest 
the 
following 
recommendations: 
 
Each task should not exceed more than 5 or 6 
interactions. It was observed that more than 8 
interactions cause confusion in performing a task. 
 
Specifying the ID of a contact (username, phone 
number or email) should be enough for adding a 
contact. Other options (extra data such as name, last 
name, location, etc.) should be optional. 
The heuristic evaluation results led us to propose the 
following guidelines: 
 
The interface should be carefully designed to ensure 
that all elements of the app are properly displayed in 
any position. 
 
Do not tolerate unrecoverable errors. It is always better 
displaying an error message than an unexpected 
shutdown of the app. 
The usability recommendations proposed are a valuable 
resource for mobile app developers because they will 
improve the usability of their IM apps in mobile devices, 
thus achieving more downloads and users of their apps. As a 
future work, a new analysis will be carried out on other 
existing mobile platforms (e.g., Android) to compare results. 
Finally, after that we are planning to develop a mobile 
instant messaging application meeting the recommendations 
proposed, which will solve the main usability problems 
identified in existing applications.
