 Abstract— This paper presents a sensitivity study of acoustic 
hydrogen gas sensors. The study emphasises on the comparison 
between sensitivity of Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) hydrogen 
gas and new acoustic hydrogen sensors based on Lamb waves. 
To highlight this comparison, a parametric model based on the 
variation of mechanical and physical properties of Palladium 
sensitive layers has been implemented. This results show that 
SAW wave devices are more sensitive to Young’s modulus 
variations than Lamb Acoustic Wave devices.

 INTRODUCTION   
Due to the increasing demand on hydrogen gas sensors 
for several applications such as automation, transportation, 
or environmental monitoring, the need for sensitive and 
reliable sensors with a short response time is increasing [1-
2]. The purpose of gas sensors is to analysis residual gas in a 
reservoir, to insure an optimal security in hydrogen vehicles, 
or to satisfy the current gas detection requirements. 
Therefore, in the recent years, the trend has been towards 
exploiting new emerging sensing technologies. One of most 
used technologies is the acoustic technology. Most of the 
developed acoustic sensors  are based on Surface Acoustic 
Waves (SAW) [3-5]. These devices present a good 
reliability and robustness in harsh environments, combined 
with low fabrication cost. In addition, SAW devices are 
passive, that reduces power consumption [6-8].  Recently, 
some work has been devoted to Lamb wave resonators [9], 
which is said to exhibit promising performances for 
biological detection due to their improved mass sensitivity.  
In this paper, a sensitivity comparison between SAW and 
Lamb wave devices is presented, in order to compare their 
suitability to hydrogen gas sensing.  
     Because of its high ability to interact with hydrogen 
molecules, Palladium (Pd) is often used as a sensitive layer 
to detect the presence of hydrogen gas [10-12] in SAW 
delay lines. In this work, 3% hydrogen concentration is 
considered and in this case, the Palladium density and 
Young’s modulus decrease by 2% and 14% respectively 
with an      error [13-14]. Based on finite element 
simulations, a parametric study technique has been used to 
analyze the impact of physical and mechanical parameters 
variations of a sensitive layer on the frequency of SAW and 
Lamb wave delay lines.  
      The different between acoustic modes used to perform 
the sensitivity analysis is presented in Section 2. In Section 
3, the methodology and the finite element models are 
presented together with a comparison between frequency 
bands. Section 4 is devoted to the presentation of the 
obtained results and the analysis. The conclusion will be 
used to summarize main obtained results and analysis.

 METHODOLOGY 
A. Selected Modes Characteristics 
     This sensitivity comparison is based on analysing three 
different modes with different characteristics: two Lamb 
wave modes using Aluminum Nitride (AlN) membrane - the 
symmetric    Lamb mode operating at low frequencies and 
an anti-symmetric    Lamb mode operating at high 
frequencies above its cut-off frequency – and the Rayleigh 
mode propagating on the Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) 
substrate. The shape of  these modes obtained by Comsol is 
shown in Fig. 1.

     The    Lamb mode corresponds to a compression or an 
extension of the piezoelectric plate along the propagation 
direction. Its deformations are homogeneous in the thickness 
of the plate. The      mode corresponds to shearing in the 
thickness-direction of the membrane. For a LiNbO3 substrate, 
the Rayleigh mode corresponds to an elliptic displacement in 
the sagittal plane and is evanescent in the thickness of the 
medium. 
B. Sensitivity Comparison Method 
To perform this comparison, the methodology used is 
based on a parametric study using Comsol. A model based 
on small simultaneous variations of sensitive layer 
properties (Young’s modulus and density) is implemented. 
Initial values for Palladium Young’s modulus and density 
are 
equal 
to 
           
 and
             
   respectively. To cover most of the cases, a variation of 
    for     with a step of      and      for    with a 
step of      will be considered in the parametric study. 
Then, a reduced equation that shows the dependence of the 
operating frequency to the variations of the studied 
parameters is established by curve fitting method. This 
equation will highlight the sensitivity comparison between 
studied acoustic modes. The following diagram shown in 
Fig. 2 summarizes the path adopted to establish this 
equation. 
 
Figure 2.  Flow chart  summarizing the steps of calculating the relation 
between  the frequency, the density and the Young modulus. 
where b is the constant related to the sensitivity of Young's 
modulus, c is the constant related to the sensitivity of the 
density and d the interrelationship constant. To determine 
the equation used as model to perform the sensitivity, 
another high-order equations (second and fourth order) is 
explored. This study revealed that the fit and the residuals 
obtained from high-order equations are better than the 
established equation in Fig. 2. However, the use of high-
order equations is more complex. Thus, for the sensitivity 
study the equation of first order will be adopted. 
C. Finite Element Model Building 
      A c-axis oriented AlN plate is used for Lamb modes and 
a Y/Z LiNbO3 cut for SAW mode. The description of the 
geometries used to perform sensitivity studies is represented 
in Fig. 3. 
 
Figure 3.  Comsol model proposed for the study of sensitivity: a) Lamb 
mode and b) SAW mode. 
        For each studied mode, piezoelectric,  linear elastic and 
electrical models are used. To ensure continuity between 
blocks, multiblock and conformal mesh are used. Finally, 
Floquet periodic boundary conditions at the edges of the 
model are imposed to force a wavelength in the propagation 
direction. 
D. Frequency Band Identification 
     Sensitivity studies are conducted around the ISM 
frequency bands: 433 MHz – 435 MHz and 902 MHz – 928 
MHz. To design the geometry of the excitation electrodes 
(period of interdigitated electrodes), the dispersion curves of 
the first four Lamb wave modes in a 2 µm c-axis oriented 
AlN plate is plotted, as shown in Fig. 4.

  From these dispersion curves, the    mode operates in 
the 430 MHz ISM band for electrode period of around 
10 µm. The    mode operates in the 920 MHz ISM band for 
electrode periods around 20 µm. These results are 
summarized in Table I.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
A.    Lamb and Rayleigh Mode Sensitivity Comparison 
From parametric study proposed in Fig. 2, a relation between 
frequency and the Palladium various parameters is 
established, see equation 1.   
    (   (
    
  )   (
    
  )   (
    
  ) (
    
  ))  (1) 
This equation is used for Rayleigh and    Lamb mode in 
order to determine the sensitivity of the frequency to the 
various parameters. The different constants for theses 
equations are shown in Table II.

0.0071 
These results show that the Rayleigh mode is more 
sensitive to changes in Pd stiffness than the    Lamb mode. 
However, the     Lamb mode is more sensitive to the mass 
loading effect than the Rayleigh mode. The initial frequency 
for Rayleigh mode and     Lamb mode are 442 MHz and 
476 MHz respectively. In the presence of 3% hydrogen 
concentration, density decreases by 5% and Young modulus 
by 20%.  The expected frequencies are 440 MHz for the 
Rayleigh mode and 476 MHz for the     Lamb mode. This 
shows that the Rayleigh mode is slightly more sensitive 
(0.45% frequency shift) than the    Lamb mode for which 
the effect of Pd film stiffening and the mass-loading 
compensate each other. 
B.     Lamb and Rayleigh Mode Sensitivity Comparison 
    The same analysis was performed to compare the 
sensitivity between    Lamb mode and Rayleigh mode in the 
same frequency band.  
For each mode, material constants related to the sensitivity 
properties of the Pd layer are extracted from the set of 
parametric simulations.

0.0078 
         In this case, the Rayleigh mode is more sensitive to all 
changes in material properties of the Pd film. In addition, the 
initial value and the expected value of the frequency are 
1082 MHz and 1075 MHz respectively for Rayleigh mode, 
resulting in a 0.65 % frequency shift. For the    Lamb mode, 
the initial value is 1154 MHz and the expected value is 1155 
MHz, that leads to a 0.09% frequency shift. It is also 
interesting to note that with the increase in operation 
frequency, the Rayleigh mode has become more sensitive to 
added mass and increased stiffness. This is attributed to the 
decreasing of penetration depth at higher frequency, and 
therefore a better confinement of vibrations at the vicinity of 
the sensitive material. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
    In this paper, the sensitivity comparison between the 
classical SAW hydrogen gas sensor and future potential  
hydrogen gas sensors based on Lamb waves was presented. 
This comparison was performed considering delay lines 
operating in the ISM bands, at around 430 MHz and 
920 MHz. Theoretical evaluations showed that, in the 
presence of 3 % hydrogen concentration, gas acoustic 
sensors based on Rayleigh waves are more sensitive to 
hydrogen than similar Lamb wave sensors. To generalize 
these results, other comparative studies will be conducted to 
determine the influence of hydrogen concentration.
