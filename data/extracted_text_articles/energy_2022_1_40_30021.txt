Abstract—With the prevalence of smart meter infrastructure,
data analysis on consumer side becomes more and more impor-
tant in smart grid systems. One of the fundamental tasks is to
disaggregate users’ total consumption into appliance-wise values.
It has been well noted that encoding of temporal dependency is
a key issue for successful modelling of the relations between
the total consumption and its decomposed consumption on an
appliance historically, and therefore has been implemented in
many state-of-the-art models. However, how to encode the varied
long-term and short-term dependency coming from different
appliances is yet an open and under-addressed question. In
this paper, we propose an Attention-guided Temporal Convo-
lutional Network (ATCN), which generates different temporal
residual blocks and provides an attention mechanism to indicate
the importance of those blocks with respect to the appliance.
Ultimately, we aim to address these two questions: i) How to
employ both long-term and short-term temporal dependency to
better disaggregate future loads while maintaining an affordable
memory cost? ii) How to employ attention during the training of
an appliance to obtain a better representation of the consumption
pattern? We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach
through comprehensive experiments and show that our proposed
ATCN model achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly
on multi-status appliances that are normally hard to cope with
regarding disaggregation accuracy and generalization capability.

I. INTRODUCTION
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), also referred to
as energy disaggregation, aims to disaggregate the power
consumption of a customer as a whole into detailed appliance-
level consumption [1]. It has become one of the key tools to
make effective use of the emerging smart meter infrastructure
for the benefit of energy customers and producers, with great
potential in applications such as energy awareness, energy
conservation, and identification of controllable loads [2].
NILM has been framed historically both as classification
and regression problems. Our paper is treating NILM as
a regression problem, i.e, to estimate the consumption of
individual appliances from the mains signal. In order to capture
all distinct consumption patterns from all types of appliances,
NILM algorithms tend to adopt a training dataset with a long
time span (as long as memory permits) and attempt to learn
temporal dependencies for each appliance. The trend is that
recent work tends to utilize a range of deep neural network
architectures, such as encoder-decoder networks, long short-
term memory (LSTM) networks, bi-directional, sequence-to-
sequence, and sequence-to-point [3] [4] [5] based prediction
algorithms and their variants, including the very recent Bitcn-
NILM algorithm [6], which combines sequence-to-point with
bidirectional dilated convolution network. The key challenges
of the prediction strategy are these: if the time window is
too small, essential dependencies cannot be learned, e.g. if
an appliance has a cyclic consumption pattern and the time
window does not cover a full period. However, if it is too large,
the efficiency of the scheme can significantly degrade, since
loading long historical data burdens the memory requirement.
Additionally, it also requires a much longer prediction time,
and therefore cannot meet the needs of real applications.
Remark that different appliances exhibit vastly different
temporal dependencies. As an example, we present in Figure 1
the daily power consumption of a household from the REDD
dataset (shown in black color) along with its corresponding
appliance-level consumption. Two important findings can be
seen: 1) both local neighbors and far-away neighbors in
disjoint time windows can together help with the disaggrega-
tion of appliance-level consumption. 2) for some appliances,
local neighbors are most important for prediction of future
consumption (e.g., fridge in Fig.1); for others, far-away points
play a more important role (e.g., microwave and washer dryer
in Fig.1). In other words, the relevant dependency ranges are
specific to each appliance and should be adapted accordingly.

Fig. 1.
Different appliances demonstrate various dependencies on short-term, mid-term and long-term neighbors. Appliance-wise consumption patterns in
REDD dataset [7] showing temporal dependencies over mixed time scales: The power consumption marked with cyan indicates that it depends on its historical
neighbors in a local time window (the yellow rectangle); A potential strong connection with far-apart neighbors (marked in blue points within a blue rectangle
window) is also indicated. Depending upon the appliance, such a dependency can range one day ahead (fridge), or even six days ahead (microwave).
Therefore, the ability to use both long-term and short-term
dependencies, while varying the attention on them according
to the appliance, is crucial in NILM methodologies. How to
accomplish this, therefore, is the key question in our paper.
II. PROPOSED ALGORITHM AND RESULTS
To the best of our knowledge, the adaptive attention is still
missing in the current literature and the question of how to
put varied attention on different appliances, i.e., short-term
or long-term dependency, has not been fully addressed. We
therefore propose an Attention-guided Temporal Convolutional
Network (ATCN) to encode such dependencies.
Our algorithm sequentially acquires the input and actively
attends relevant pieces of temporal information to refine the
target consumption estimate at each time step. The key com-
ponents are the casual dilation nature of the model and the
attention mechanisms, both of which we empirically show
the contribution to the appliance-wise consumption prediction.
The overall architecture is show in Fig 3.
The comparative results with state-of-the-art algorithms on
RMSE metric are shown in Table. I. Our ATCN algorithm has
a competitive performance on multi-stage appliances, such as
microwave and dish washer (on dish washer, our algorithm can
achieve the second best place, just following after Seq2Point
algorithm); it particularly achieves the best performance on
the most difficult multi-stage appliance: washer dryer, owning
to the combination of short-term and long-term dependency
and attention mechanism.
In addition to RMSE metric evaluation, we also have
provided the comparative results on EA metric, where esti-
mated accuracy (EA) has also been employed as in [8] and
[9]. Our approach has proven competitive performance on
multi-stage appliances, including wash dryer and dish washer.
Be noted that different evaluation metrics does not always
have consensus result on different algorithms, which have
been observed through the experiments. Moreover, failure to
penalize the false detection during the evaluation procedure
also has been noticed, and therefore how to propose a reliable
evaluation criteria for NILM algorithms would be one of our

III. CONCLUSION
As an important problem in smart home management,
NILM still remains a challenge with great potential for further
exploration and improvement. We propose a residual block
concatenation strategy and apply an attention mechanism
based on such residuals instead of dilated layers to im-
prove NILM performance. The essential dilation and temporal
convolution structure helps capture the long-term as well
as short-term dependencies in the consumption signatures,
while attention residuals ensure that the model’s emphasis on
relevant time scales is adapted to the appliance. Our proposed
