Abstract—In wireless sensor networks (WSN) energy efﬁciency
of routing protocols is of primary importance. Embedded with
local load balancing mechanisms, the proposed L2RP protocol is
a link reliability based routing protocol which aims to help source
nodes to exploit the potential capabilities of their respective
neighbors. As it is a reliability-oriented protocol, L2RP discards
unreliable links to avoid the substantial energy cost of packet
losses. Simulation results show major efﬁciency beneﬁts that stem
from load balancing which helps in lengthening the network
lifetime while minimizing packet losses.
In WSN, the choice of a routing protocol and its key parame-
ters depends on the nature of the application and on its primary
mission. Lot of works addressed routing issues with more or
less effectiveness, some of which pointed out the use of the link
quality indicator (LQI) as a route selection criterion (metric). In
a previous work, following an experimental study, we have shown,
under some conditions, the inefﬁciency of the LQI based routing.
In this paper, we propose through L2RP a simple way to improve
reliability and efﬁciency of the LQI based routing in WSN.
We also give a comparative study of several metrics including
new deﬁnitions of LQI based metrics. Simulation results show
that our adaptation of the LQI metric is among the best route
selection criteria regardless of the performance criterion under
consideration.

I. INTRODUCTION
Designing a cold chain monitoring application requires
special focus on at least two main phases. In [2], we presented
an example of sensor network for cold chain monitoring where
sensors are inside pallets. We proposed energy efﬁcient pro-
tocols for the transport phase in which the WSN is deployed
in trucks with no Base Station (BS) because it would be very
expensive to install and maintain Base Stations within each
truck. There are a few sensors in the truck.
The second phase concerns the product storage in a
warehouse where each pallet is handling temperature sensor.
This application speciﬁcally collects rare events (alarms)
to ensure the proper monitoring of the system. If the
temperature is over a threshold, an alarm will be generated;
this "interesting event" is then sent towards the BS. Due to
the size of a warehouse which hosts large number of pallets,
one upon the other, the WSN can reach several hundreds of
sensors which collaborate for sending data towards the BS.
So, in this environment, the link quality is a key parameter
which has many effects on the network performance.
In [3], we used up to 50 Moteiv Tmote Sky [4] sensors,
in a small experimental platform, including a 2.4GHz ZigBee
[5][6] wireless transceiver (chipcon′s CC2420) [7]. On each
packet reception, the CC2420 calculates the error rate, and
produces a LQI value. To conduct experiments, we used the
multiHopLQI1 routing algorithm along with the Sensornet
Protocol (SP) implementation [8]. In this algorithm, nodes
sense and send "interesting events" to the BS. Based on the
acknowledgement, a sensor decides to retransmit the data or
not. If the acknowledgement fails, the sensor selects another
node and routes data towards the BS. Under these conditions,
the experimental results pointed out that the LQI based routing
could have negative effects on the network performance [3].
After all, we think that the link quality might be a key
parameter which some routing protocols could rely on in
order to increase the network performance. The link quality
indicator (LQI) is deﬁned in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard
[5][6] as a measurement of the quality of packet reception
between two nodes. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard does not
specify the implementation of LQI, which is up to the radio
manufacturer. Several works address WSN routing, but only
few papers are related to LQI based routing protocols. Sensors
are characterized by their low energy level. Thereby load
balancing trafﬁc between different nodes, is also an essential
idea to increase the lifetime of nodes and thus the network.
This work addresses two challenges: improving LQI based
routing protocol by load balancing trafﬁc over multiple paths.
When a sensor has to send data towards the Base Station,
the load balancing routing consists to elect several nodes
as next hop routers depending on the order of packet
transmissions and the nodes previously used as the next hop
routers. The idea is to involve several sensors in the routing
effort to minimize the overall energy consumption and then
extend the network lifetime.

The metric is a property of a route in computer networking
consisting of any value used by routing algorithms to deter-
mine whether one route should perform better than another.
Commonly, the route with the lowest metric is the preferred
route. However, in this paper, a metric means the local value
associated with a node: for a source node, the highest value, in
its neighbourhood, may lead to the selection of such a node as
the next hop router. For instance, The remaining energy level
can be used as a metric to promote the selection of the highest
powered nodes as next hop routers.
In this paper, we propose WSN local load balancing routing
mechanisms using the Wait and See (WaS) protocol [2] by
comparing the following metrics: the remaining energy level,
the degree of connectivity (number of neighbors), the sensor
proximity with respect to the Base Station, the link quality
indicator (LQI), and a hybrid metric composed of any pairs
of these metrics.
The sensor networks are characterized by low energy
constituting their batteries. Then energy consumption and
some other performance criteria such as the load imbalance
factor (LIF), the average path lengths, the network lifetime
and the packet loss percentage are taken into consideration to
evaluate the effectiveness of routing mechanisms.
"Achtophorous
Node"
deﬁnition:
we
focus
on
homogeneous WSN where all sensors are participating
together in the routing effort. Since all nodes are routers,
we prefer using the term "achtophorous node" derived from
Greek term aχθoϕoρεω which denotes "node handling heavy
load". For each node sending data, its achtophorous nodes are
its next hop sensors which handle the load due to the routing
of its packets towards the BS. Each sensor selects among its
neighbors one or more achtophorous nodes. We also examine
the inﬂuence of increasing the number of the achtophorous
nodes on the routing efﬁciency. The WSN deployed in a
warehouse is proned to some unreliabilities of wireless links.
Then, we present results pertaining to unreliable links impacts
on the network performance.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. After pre-
sentation of a short background in the next part, the next
one gives some topics on studied metrics (Section III). Then,
we describe load balancing mechanisms (Section IV) and the
proposed routing protocol (Section V). Finally, the last two
sections present the simulation model and the results.
II. RELATED WORKS
Commonly used by the TinyOS community, MultihopLQI
is a routing protocol which employs the cost-based paradigm
deﬁned in [9]. Link estimation is viewed as an essential tool
for the computation of reliability-oriented route selection
metrics. In MultiHopLQI, the link metric is the Link Quality
Indicator (LQI) which is used additively to obtain the cost
of a given route. MultihopLQI avoids routing tables by only
keeping state for the best parent at a given time, drastically
reducing memory usage and control overhead. A new parent
is adopted if it advertises a lower cost than the current parent.
Many experimental studies related to WSN, some of which
are based on MultiHopLQI, [3][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]
have shown that high unreliability of wireless links must
be explicitly taken into account when designing routing
protocols. [11][12] address load balancing embedded in
reliability-oriented routing protocols and are also using
MultiHopLQI.
In [17][18] authors address the problem of minimizing
the total consumed energy to reach the destination. The
performance objective of maximizing the network lifetime
was considered in [19][20].
Several works are related to WSN and ad hoc networks load
balancing routing schemes [21][22][23][24][25][26]. In [21],
authors show that distributing the trafﬁc generated by each
sensor node through multiple paths instead of using a single
path allows energy savings. Paper [22] deﬁnes a network
optimization problem used for performing the load balancing
in wireless networks with a single type of trafﬁc. In [23],
authors study wireless network routing algorithms that use
only short paths, for minimizing the latency, and achieve the
load balance. In [24], authors introduce a collision awareness
in multipath routing; while [25] propose a multipath routing
protocol to address the congestion control issue in WSN.
In [26], the challenge of maximizing the network lifetime
by load balancing the trafﬁc is covered. In order to balance
the energy consumption among sensor nodes, they deploy
multiple sinks simultaneously, which are connected through
wired or wireless infrastructure. [27][28] and [29] are also
related to load balancing routing protocols.
The paper [30] presents a resource-aware and link quality
based (RLQ) routing metric. Based on both energy efﬁciency
and link quality statistics, the RLQ metric in [30] is intended
to adapt to varying wireless channel conditions, while
exploiting the heterogeneous capabilities. This protocol does
not include load balancing features.
Some works are taken into account the round-robin cluster
based routing [31][32] and [33], where clusterheads are
selected on a round-robin fashion. In [34] authors propose a
source count (packets) based weighted round-robin forwarding
algorithm.
Although all these studies provide a valuable and strong
contribution in WSN routing, the problems of load balancing
routing mechanisms based on local metrics, with special inter-
est on the LQI based metrics, are yet to be addressed. This is
the goal of this paper. To save energy, we exploit the broadcast
nature of wireless links, and the fact that the weights, in
our proposed L2RP protocol, are built upon the achtophorous
nodes capabilities instead of the ones of the source node. This

allows L2RP to avoid doing a per packet load-balancing by
the source, as done in [34], where the source node sends its
data without being sure that the achtophorous node is able
or not to sustain the load assigned. Thus, L2RP hleps in
reducing packet losses. Moreover, in most of papers addressing
the load balancing routing, both experimental studies and
simulation models are validated for only small sized networks
(few tens of nodes), whereas our work addresses large sized
networks (several hundreds of sensors). The comparative study
of different metrics in L2RP is also a contribution of this paper.
III. ROUTES SELECTION CRITERIA
In this paper, "metric" is used to refer to local route
selection criterion. As deﬁned in introduction, each time we
use "Achtophorous Node" it means next hop router with
respect to a speciﬁc node having data to transmit towards the
BS.
A. Remaining Energy Level
The remaining energy of sensors could be a metric for
selecting routes since a node with better battery life seems to
be a better candidate for the packet routing from its neighbors.
Conversely, if a sensor with low power is selected as an
achtophorous node, this can lead to packet losses because it
might not have enough batteries to forward packets. In this
paper, we consider that each node knows its energy level.

Fig. 3.
Location of a pallet: lane, location and level
In a warehouse (see Figure 1), depending on the nature of
their respective contents (frozen foods, fresh produce, etc.), the
pallets provided each with a sensor (see Figure 2) are arranged
in ﬁxed locations (see Figure 3) designated by the Warehouse
Management Software (WMS). Thus, during the warehouse
WSN initialization, sensors could be initialized with their
respective positions without using the GPS technology.
So, we consider a WSN deployed with a Base Station where
each node knows its exact position and that of the BS. As the
main goal of the application is to send data towards the BS,
it seems natural to look at the metric deﬁned as follows:
ProximityBS(Si, BS) = 1/d(Si, BS)
(1)
where d(Si, BS) is the distance separating the sensor Si from
the BS. We choose inverse of the distance to promote the
election of the closest sensor to the BS.
C. Degree of Connectivity
The degree of connectivity of a node, i.e., the number of
its neighbors, is also a metric that seems interesting to study
because, intuitively, the more neighbors a sensor has, the more
it seems to be an appropriate candidate as an achtophorous
node since a sensor with a low degree of connectivity might
have little information, from its neighbourhood, to forward to
the BS. In the initial phase, each sensor is involved in the
neighbourhood information exchanges (hello protocol), which
allows it to determine its degree of connectivity and the BS
position.
D. LQI: Link Quality Indicator
In Zigbee standard [5][6], the LQI measurement is deﬁned
as a characterization of the strength and/or quality reception
of a packet. The use of the LQI result by the network or
the application layers is not speciﬁed in [5][6]. The LQI
measurement is performed for each received packet, and the
result is reported to the MAC sublayer as an integer ranging
from 0 to 255. The minimum and maximum LQI values (0 and
255) are associated with the lowest and the highest quality
IEEE 802.15.4 reception detectable by the receiver, and the
LQI values in between are distributed between these two limits
[5][6].
For moteiv′s
Tmote
Sky
[4]
sensors
equipped with
chipcon′s CC2420 [7], the LQI values range from 50 to 110.
Even so, we stick with the ZigBee standard [5][6] because
some manufacturers, such as SUN-SPOT [35] and WiEye
[36], are still using the standard LQI values. Then, we use

the standard values (i.e., [0, 255]), instead of those of CC2420.
In this paper, we deﬁne three LQI based metrics: AvgLQI,
MaxLQI and MinLQI. The AvgLQI metric is the average
calculated from the LQI values of all the links between the
node and its neighbors. AvgLQI values give a characterization
of sensors throughout their respective coverage quality. This
metric might be useful in the context of the WSN deployed in a
warehouse which hosts a large number of pallets, one upon the
other. Such an environment is proned to high unreliability of
wireless links. the MaxLQI metric is the maximum LQI value
which matches to the standard deﬁnition of the LQI used in the
MultiHopLQI routing algorithm [3][8]. As for the MinLQI, it
is the minimum value beyond the given LQI threshold. For
example (see Figure 4), assuming that the LQI threshold for
an acceptable link quality is 100, the MinLQI for node 5 is
120 (LQI of link 5-8) instead of 90 (LQI of link 5-7). Thus,
Table I gives LQI metrics values for the WSN in Figure 4.
E. Composite or Hybrid Metric
In this paper, we deﬁne the composite metric (hybrid) as
follows:
Hybrid(LQI, Mi) = ρ ∗ LQI + (1 − ρ) ∗ Sc(Mi)
(2)
Hybrid(Mi, Mj) = ρ ∗ Sc(Mi) + (1 − ρ) ∗ Sc(Mj)
(3)
where Sc(Mi) is a scale function, which returns remaining
energy values comparable to LQI values. This help avoiding
the composite metric to be strongly inﬂuenced by the Mi
component in (2):
Sc(Mi) = α + β ∗ log(1 + (Mi − Mi,min))
log(1 + Mi,max)
(4)
Where Mi is a metric, Mi,min (resp. Mi,max) is the minimum
(resp. maximum) value of Mi. If Mi is the remaining energy
of the node, Mi,min represents the value under which, the
sensor is considered dead (battery depletion); while Mi,max
is the initial energy value of a new battery. α = 50, β = 255.
Like the LQI metrics deﬁnition, we can also deﬁne
AvgHybrid, MaxHybrid and MinHybrid metrics depending on
whether, we are respectively considering AvgLQI, MaxLQI
and MinLQI as deﬁned in Table I.
IV. ROUTING MECHANISMS
A. Simple Routing
Fig. 5.
Simple Routing: Nodes with their Metric Values
In the simple routing mechanism, each sensor Si selects an
achtophorous node which matches the highest metric in its
vicinity and located between the sensor Si and the BS. For
each given sensor, a unique achtophorous node plays the next
hop role for all its packets until the next election (see Figure
5).
B. Round-Robin Routing
Fig. 6.
Round-Robin Routing: Multiple routes from each source
In the round-robin routing, each source node has to elect two
or more achtophorous nodes. The source node sends data in
round-robin fashion, simply taking turns which achtophorous
node it routes each packet out (see Figure 6). This routing
mechanism is a per-packet load balancing routing which
gives most even distribution across next achtophorous nodes.

This per-packet load balancing method means that packets
in a particular connection or ﬂow arrive at their destination
out of sequence. This does not cause a problem for most
applications, but it can cause problems for the increasingly
popular streaming media, both video and audio. In this paper,
only data packets are concerned within cold chain monitoring
application for which the packet sequence order is not an issue.
C. Weighted Round-Robin Routing (W2R routing)

The weighted round-robin routing (W2R routing) is a load
balancing mechanism that involves assigning a weight to each
achtophorous node. Weights are proportional to metric values.
In the W2R routing, each achtophorous node is assigned
a value that signiﬁes, relative to the other achtophorous
nodes in the routing table, how the source node performs.
The weight determines how many more (or less) packets
are sent to that achtophorous node, compared to the other
achtophorous nodes (see Figure 7). The W2R routing is
one way addressing some shortcomings. In particular, it
provides a clean and effective way by focusing on fairly
distributing the load amongst available achtophorous nodes,
versus attempting to equally distribute data packets.
For example, in Figure 7, the source node routes 50% of its
packets through AN1, 30% through AN2 and 20% through
AN3. If the BS is not located within the transmission range
of an achtophorous node, this one should apply the same
mechanism to retransmit the packet towards the BS.
The weighted round-robin routing mechanism is computed
as described in the simple Algorithm 1 which is computed each
time a source node has to send a packet. The achtophorous
nodes, each with its respective weight, are listed in the routing

table of each source node in an ordered manner such that the
ﬁrst achtophorous node matches the highest weight as shown
in Figure 7. For each source node, the window interval is
the constant length of each stream of consecutive packets to
transmit. The weight of each achtophorous node is converted
as an integer value based on the window interval parameter.
For example, in Figure 7, window = 10 consecutive packets,
and weight(AN1) = 5. The use(AN) function returns the
number of times the current achtophorous node AN is used
during the window interval whereas packet_idx is the index
of the current packet during the window interval.
V. L2RP: THE LINK RELIABILITY BASED ROUTING
PROTOCOL
The proposed (L2RP) routing protocol (see Figure 8)
consists for a sensor having an empty routing table to
elect one next hop router (case of simple routing) or more
achtophorous nodes (load balancing routings) amongst its
neighbors according to the following:
• Initial step : all sensors empty their routing tables.
• The sensors located in the vicinity (transmission range)
of the BS send their data directly to it.
• A sensor, located outside of the vicinity of the BS,
inspects its routing table:
– If its routing table is not empty, it checks if the link
with the next hop is reliable or not. If the link is
unreliable, based on the LQI value, then :
434

∗ Case of simple routing mechanism: it sends a
"ROUTE REQUEST" to its neighbors.
∗ Case of load-balancing routing: it chooses an
alternate route and then checks again if the link
with this next hop is reliable or not. If no link with
achtophorous nodes listed in its routing table is re-
liable, then it erases the routing table and it sends
a new "ROUTE REQUEST" to its neighbors.
– If its routing table is empty, it also sends a "ROUTE
REQUEST" to its neighbors.
– Each neighbor, located between the BS and the sen-
sor having sent the "ROUTE REQUEST", computes
its own waiting time which is inversely proportional
to its metric value. We use the Wait and See protocol
(WaS), as in [2], where the only sensor having the
highest metric sends a "ROUTE REPLY" to the
requester node. The other neighbors simply ignore
the "ROUTE REQUEST" avoiding useless "ROUTE
REPLY" packets. In the case of a load balancing
routing, the number (ANs) of achtophorous nodes is
a known parameter in the initialization phase of the
network. This parameter is used by the WaS protocol
that allows ANs sensors having highest metrics in
succession to answer to the requester node, and then
be elected, for this node, as achtophorous nodes.
– Upon reception of the "ROUTE REPLY" packet,
the requester node updates its routing table, which
remains valid until the next election. In the case of
weighted round-robin routing, each "ROUTE RE-
PLY" packet contains the metric value of the an-
swering node, which allows the requester node to
calculate weights associated with each achtophorous
nodes.
– At the end of the current cycle, sensors reset their
routing tables and go back to the initial step of the
next cycle.
Upon receipt of a "ROUTE REQUEST" packet, a sensor
Si computes its own waiting time according to the following
formula:
T imer(Si) = τ +
ζ
1 + log(1 + Mi + id(Si)
Γ
∗ Mi)
(5)
where Mi is the metric value of the sensor Si. τ and ζ are
nonzero positive constants. Γ is a constant which is more
large than the network size (Γ = 106, for example). This
timer function avoids collisions between nodes having the
same metric value. Since Mi ≥ 0, if Mi = 0 then the sensor
Si can not be an achatophorous node.
As we can see, in this protocol the source node uses the
link quality indicator (LQI) to check if the link it forms with
the nominated achtophorous node is reliable or not. This helps
avoiding to send the packet to an achtophorous with which it
forms a link of poor quality which could lead to packet loss.

VI. PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Average Ratio of the Remaining Energy
The average ratio of the remaining energy is the ratio of
the average remaining energy on the average of initial energy.
Multiplied by hundred, this value represents the average bat-
tery life of sensors, in terms of percentage. The higher this
value is, the more energy-efﬁcient the routing protocol is.
B. Average Path Lengths
The average path lengths are calculated in terms of the
number of hops traversed by packets before reaching the BS. A
large value reﬂects participation of many sensors in the effort
due to the routing, which may increase the overall energy
consumption. A good routing protocol is recognized in this
performance criterion by a relatively low value. Conversely,
too small path length may lead to bad quality link.
C. LIF: Load Imbalance Factor
The load imbalance factor (LIF) is deﬁned as the root of
the squared coefﬁcient of variation of the relative remaining
energy. This shows the energy spent by communications:
LIF =
s
V ar(Ei
R)
ER
2
(6)
where Ei
R is the ratio of the remaining energy of sensor Si;
and ER is the average ratio of the remaining energy.
D. Network Lifetime
In this paper, we deﬁne the network lifetime as the average
number of packets routed until the ﬁrst time a sensor run out of
battery. This could also result in network capacity. We focus on
the ﬁrst battery depletion, which means the instant the network
stops fulﬁlling totally its role, because it leads to packet losses.
An ideal network is a network where all packets sent by source
nodes are actually transmitted to the recipient (BS). The earlier
the ﬁrst packet loss happened, the more ineffective the routing
protocol is.

E. Average Percentage of Lost Packets
Beyond the ﬁrst time a battery depletion is experienced by
the network, a high percentage of packet losses might reﬂect
an unreliable network whose routing protocol is less effective.

In the simulation model N nodes are randomly (according
to a uniform distribution) deployed over an area of length
L=100m, and width l=100m (see Figure 9). The BS is located
at the (0,0) position. Each node generates a sequence of "in-
teresting events", which are sensed data over the temperature
threshold Tmin, following the Poisson process of parameter
λ = 10. For simulation scenarios, the size of each data packet
is set to kdata = 128bits, and the "ROUTE REQUEST"
and "ROUTE REPLY" packets of the L2RP protocol have a
size of krr = 24bits. Each node knows its position and its
energy level. The initial energy amount of each node is set to
E0 = (1.5 ∗ 105 − ε)µJ, ε = rand(0, 1)∗ 102. A node battery
exhaustion is experienced when the remaining energy level of
the node is under the given treshold Emin = E0 ∗ 0.05. All
nodes, including the BS, have same transmission range (R =
20m). The main simulation parameters are listed in Table III.
C. LQI Model for Simulation Purposes
The WSN can be modelled as a graph G = (V, E), where
two nodes are connected by an edge if they can communicate
with each other. Let x ∈ V be a node in the WSN. N1(x)
is the neighbourhood of the node x. At each given time t, a
node x forms with each y ∈ N1(x) a link of which the link
quality indicator (LQI) value is denoted by ℓ(x, y, t) > 0. For
all other nodes z ∈ V \ N1(x), ℓ(x, z, t) = 0. Let ν be a
bijective function deﬁned in V which is a totally ordered set.
The ν function is deﬁned as follows:
∀ x ∈ V, ν(x) = (f(x), id(x))
(9)
where f(x) is the function which returns the metric value of x,
and id(x) returns the address of the node x. The total ordering
in V is deﬁned as follows:
∀x ∈ V, ν(x) > ν(y) ⇐⇒ (f(x) > f(y))
or
(f(x) = f(y)
and
id(x) > id(y))
(10)
After the WSN deployment in the warehouse, the BS initially
broadcasts a message containing its position. This information
is then retransmitted to all sensors in the network. In this
phase, each node knows its degree of connectivity. At each
given time t, the LQI value of the link formed by any pair
(x, y) of nodes is calculated by using the ℓ(x, y, t) function
deﬁned below:
ℓ(x, y, t) = f(x, y, t) ∗ g(x, y)
(11)
f(x, y, t) = 1 − Pr [ℓink(x, y, t) = Unreliable]
(12)
g(x, y) = α + β ∗ log(1 + (γ(x, y) − γmin(x)))

γmax(x) =
max
y∈N 1(x) γ(x, y)
(16)
where α = 50, β = 255 and d(x, y) is the distance separating
y from x.
In the context of a cold chain monitoring application, the
warehouse hosts hundreds of pallets, one upon the other.
Each pallets is provided with a temperature sensor. This
environment is subjected to some unreliabilities of the wireless
links. So, in the formula (12), Pr [ℓink(x, y, t) = Unreliable]
denotes the probability that the link ℓink(x, y, t) becomes
unreliable at time t. This probability is used in some
simulation scenarios, in order to evaluate the behaviour of
our L2RP protocol with respect to the unrelibility aspect of
the wireless links.
The choice of this model, formula (13) similarly to the scale
function Sc deﬁned in the composite metric, is guided by
experimental results shown in [39] and [10] which stated that
the LQI decreases when the distance between nodes increases
in Zigbee-based WSN.
As we can see, ℓ(x, y, t) ̸= ℓ(y, x, t), because of the
formulas (15) and (16). Hence, the model allows to take into
account asymetrical aspects of the wireless links.
For moteiv′s Tmote Sky [4] sensors equipped with chipcon′s
CC2420 [7], the LQI values range from 50 to 110. Even
so, we stick with the ZigBee standard [5][6] because some
manufacturers, such as Sun-SPOT [35] and WiEye [36], are
still using the standard LQI values. Then, we use the standard
values (i.e. [0, 255]) increased by α = 50, instead of those of
CC2420. The use of α = 50 allows to keep the null value,
ℓ(x, y, t) = 0, only for the two cases where the node y is not in
the transmission range of the node x, or when the ℓink(x, y, t)
becomes unreliable i.e. Pr [ℓink(x, y, t) = Unreliable] = 1.
This LQI model is only used for simulation purposes, so
sensor nodes do not compute these above formulas.
VIII. SIMULATION RESULTS
Simulations, using Matlab, are run for a network size
ranging from 100 to 500 nodes. The performance results
presented here are obtained by averaging the results for 50
different simulations for each scenario comparing the route
selection criteria. In each scenario where the three routing
mechanisms are compared, 25 different simulations were run.
For each simulation, a new random node layout is used.
In all simulation results presented below, ρ = 0.5 for the
composite metric as deﬁned in formulas (2) and (3). If it’s not
speciﬁed, the number ANs of Achtophorous Nodes is set to
ANs = 3 for each load balancing mechanism.
In all simulation scenarios, except those in Section VIII-H,
links are considered reliable, i.e.:
∀t, ∀x ∈ V, Pr [ℓink(x, y, t) = Unreliable] = 0 , ∀y ∈
N1(x).
For some results, the related conﬁdence intervals for a
conﬁdence coefﬁcient of 95% are computed as detailed in the
section 3.3 of [40].

The Figure 10(a) shows the average path length for the
simple routing; while the Figure 11(a) compares the average
path length related to the "Proximity with respect to the
BS" metric when it is used in the simple and load balancing
mechanisms.
This result shows that routes are longer for MaxLQI and de-
gree of connectivity metrics. The remaining energy, AvgLQI,
MinLQI and "Proximity with respect to the BS" metrics have
better average path lengths.
The Figure 10(a) shows, in the case of simple routing
mechanism, the average path lengths in terms of the average
number of hops obtained with the different studied metrics
when the node density is increasing in the deployment area.
This result shows that routes are longer for the MaxLQI
and degree of connectivity metrics. The remaining energy,
AvgLQI, MinLQI and "Proximity with respect to the BS"
metrics have better average path lengths. The gap is more
important for the MaxLQI metric with respect to the other
metrics. Moreover, for MaxLQI, the average number of hops
is a monotonically increasing function of the network density.
This reﬂects the fact that the routing according to the metric

Average path length: Comparison of the three routing mechanisms
with the Proximity-BS (a) and MaxLQI (b) metrics
MaxLQI consists of choosing as an achtophorous node the
node having the best link quality with the source node. In the
absence of obstacles and other phenomena like interferences,
the best link quality is determined by the shortest distance
separating a node from the source node. So, routing according
to the MaxLQI metric is equivalent to a multihop "step by
step" routing which is characterized by a great number of
hops due to small distances separating each source node and
its achtophorous node.
When the network density is increasing, the distances
separating sensors decrease. Thus, the distances separating
each source node and its achtophorous node also decrease,
as well. So, from any source node towards the base station,
the number of hops of each sent packet become increasingly
high when the MaxLQI is used. By multiplying the number
of hops, in this manner, the sensor network could not claim
to have a good performance. This result explains the low
performance of the MultiHopLQI routing algorithm which is
used today in many TinyOS based empirical WSN analysis.
Indeed, MultiHopLQI uses the LQI metric as deﬁned in the
ZigBee standard [5][6], that is to say the MaxLQI metric.
Conversely, the Proximity-BS and MinLQI metric have the
lowest average path lengths (see Figure. 10(a)). For any given
source node, the selected Proximity-BS based achtophorous
node matches the farthest neighboring node towards the Base
Station. Therefore, the routing according to the Proximity-BS
metric is equivalent to the shortest geographical path routing.
Accordingly, packets are transmitted from the source node to
the base station requiring the minimum number of hops. This
result (see Figure. 10(a)) is also interesting for the MinLQI
metric. Indeed, this metric promotes the use of the links of
intermediate quality. Links of good quality are synonymous
with the nearest nodes multiplying the number of hops,
whereas the links of poor quality stand for lot of packet
losses. This explain why MinLQI is a good metric.
For
the
Proximity-BS
metric,
the
load
balancing
mechanisms have the
effect of
increasing
the
average
path lengths which is almost the same average for the
weighted round robin routing and the round robin one (see
Figure 11(a)). In the case of load balancing mechanisms, each
sensor has in its routing table several achtophorous nodes of
which only one exactly corresponds to the achtophorous node
used by the simple routing. The other achtophorous nodes are
necessarily more distant from the base station. So, the average
path lengths slightly increase for load balancing mechanisms
with respect to the simple routing using the Proximity-BS
metric (see Figure 11(a)). For any given source node, the
selected achtophorous nodes are identical for both load
balancing mechanisms, their use only differs by the weight
introduced in the weighted round robin routing. This leads to
an average number of hops almost identical (see Figure 11(a)).
Unlike the Proximity-BS and MinLQI metrics , the MaxLQI
one has an average path lengths which is reduced by the
load balancing mechanisms (see Figure 11(b)). In this case,
the weighted round robin routing mechanism has an average
number of hops closer to the one of the simple routing
mechanism than the round-robin one. Indeed in the case of
W2R, the achtophorous node which forms the better link
quality (MaxLQI) is also the one which has the highest weight.
Thus, depending on the weight value, the sensors choose to
send their packets more frequently to that achtophorous node.
Therefore, W2R leads to an average number of hops closer to
the one of the simple routing mechanism (see Figure 11(b)).
B. LIF: Load Imbalance Factor
The Figure 12(a) shows the LIF when the "Proximity with
respect to the BS" is used as metric. It displays results for the
simple routing and load balancing mechanisms. The Figure
12(b) for MaxLQI and the Figure 12(c) for MinLQI also
display the LIF for the three routing mechanisms.
The lowest LIF value indicates the best evenly distribution
of the energy consumption between nodes. It would be
redundant to say that the load balancing mechanisms (round
robin and W2R) help evenly balancing the load. That is to
say that the average LIF values are lower for load balancing
mechanisms compared to the simple routing, whatever the
chosen metric (see Figure 12(a), 12(b) and 12(c)). But
the gap is more important for MaxLQI than other metrics.

Load Imbalance Factor: Comparison of different metrics in the
Weighted Round Robin Routing, i.e. W2R Routing, mechanism
Moreover, when the network density is increasing, the
difference between round robin and W2R tend to vanish
for the Proximity-BS and for the MinLQI (see Figure 12(a)
and 12(c)). For these two metrics, it would be more suitable
in dense wireless sensor networks to use the round robin
mechanism than the W2R one. Therefore, in doing so, one
saves the power required, mainly by the processor, for the
achtophorous weight computations (see Figure 7 and Table II).
These results conﬁrm that load balancing mechanisms
help in the distribution of the load across the nodes, because
whatever the metric used: the W2R routing produces lower
LIF than the round-robin routing which is followed by the
simple routing (see Figure 12(a),12(b),12(c)).
As for the Figure 13, it compares the average LIF of
different metrics in the W2R routing. The "Proximity with
respect to the BS" and MinLQI metrics produce lower LIF
values (see Figure 13). The remaining energy metric has
an intermediate LIF, while the degree of connectivity and
MaxLQI metrics tend to imbalance the energy consumption
on the network: some sensors exhaust their batteries while
others have a little participation in packet routings towards
the BS. This negative phenomenon is much more important
for the MaxLQI metric when the network size is increasing
(see Figure 12(b) and Figure 13).
This reﬂects the fact that the degree of connectivity and
MaxLQI metrics are the ones for which packets arrive at the
Base Station by routes using the largest number of hops as
shown in Figure 10(a) and explained in the last section. Thus,
along each route, the WSN experiences more retransmissions
and then more energy wastage due to the effects of overhead,
latency and overhearing phenomena which are more important
when the average number of hops is increasing.

Average percentage of lost packets: Comparison of the three routing
mechanisms with the Degree of connectivity metric
compared (see Figure 15) using the degree of connectivity
metric.
Generally, the loss percentage is quite low. This reﬂects the
fact that, in L2RP, losses are mainly due to the node battery
exhaustion. The ﬁrst result (see Figure 14) compares the
different criteria in the mechanism of simple routing. Here
again, best results are produced by MinLQI and "Proximity
with respect to the BS" metrics. MaxLQI has an intermediate
average percentage of packet losses, while the remaining
energy and degree of connectivity metrics have higher
percentages. For the Proximity-BS metric this result is easy to
understand, because according to the previous results (Figure.
10(a)), Proximity-BS is the metric which produces the shortest
path lengths. Accordingly, as the overhearing phenomenon
and the overhead induced by routing are reduced when the
number of hops is minimal, then the node battery exhaustion
occurs later (in time) leading to a low loss percentage for the
metric Proximity-BS.
Conversely, the degree of connectivity metric has the
highest percentage of packet losses (see Figure 14). By
choosing to route packets according to this metric, any given
sensor which has data to transmit chooses its achtophorous
node, in simple routing, as its neighbor which has the highest
number of neighbors. Therefore whenever an achtophorous
node
is
requested
to
route
a
packet,
the
overhearing
phenomenon causes more energy consumption which leads
to a greater packet loss percentage.
For all metrics, load balancing signiﬁcantly reduces the
average percentage of packet losses (see Figure 15). Load
balancing mechanisms produce lower packet losses than the
simple routing; differences are more important when load
balancing is run with the degree of connectivity metric, the
remaining energy metric or the MaxLQI metric.
Indeed, for the degree of connectivity metric of which the
overhearing phenomenon is the most important, Load balanc-
ing requires the selection of different achtophorous nodes for
each source node. So, in the routing table there is exactly one
node which has the highest number of neighbors: this the one
used by the simple routing mechanism. Then, in load balancing
when the other achtophorous nodes with less neighbors are
used, this helps reducing the overhearing phenomenon. This
justiﬁes why load balancing reduces the percentage of packet
losses compared to simple routing which always requires
the highest degree of connectivity as achtophorous node (see
Figure 15).

The Figure 16(a) (simple routing) and the Figure 16(b)
(W2R routing) display the average percentage of packet
losses including the hybrid metric which is a combination of
the remaining energy metric and the "Proximity with respect
to the BS" metric.
These results show that the hybrid metric composed of 50%
of the remaining energy and 50% of "Proximity with respect
to the BS" (i.e. ρ = 0.5 in Formula (3)) is a very good metric.
It has a percentage of packet losses which is relatively low,
especially when it is used with load balancing mechanisms.
As we can see, there are fewer lost packets when the simple
routing is run with the MinLQI metric than the W2R routing
run with the remaining energy metric, MaxLQI or the degree
of connectivity metric (see Figure 16(a) and Figure 16(b)).
These results show that compared to the "remaining energy
level" metric, the hybrid metric helps mitigating losses

particularly in load balancing (W2R Routing) where the
average packet loss percentage is less than 0.1% for this
metric.
This kind of metric is very interesting to consider because
depending on the speciﬁc WSN application purposes, it may
be useful to consider several criteria for selecting routes
by computing a single hybrid metric. In this result, it is
more beneﬁcial to route jointly depending on the distance
and the remaining energy than to route only along with the
remaining energy criterion. This reﬂects the fact that the
"remaining energy level" criterion is not a good metric for
route selection. Because in our simulation scenario (see Table
III) each node is deployed with an initial energy level E0
which is randomly and slightly lower than a reference value
E0 = (1.404 ∗ 105 − ε)µJ with ε = random(0, 1) ∗ 102µJ.
This scenario is very realistic, because even if the AA
batteries powering the sensors are new, they also have slightly
different energy levels in real world scenario.
Although the average percentage of packet losses is gener-
ally too low, the load balancing helps reducing the packet loss
percentage for the hybrid metric similarly to all other studied
metrics.

The Figure 17(a) displays the average network lifetime
for the simple routing. The Figure 18(a) shows the average
network lifetime when MinLQI is used in each routing
mechanism.
Firstly, these results show that more dense networks have
better lifetime. The MinLQI and "Proximity with respect to
the BS" metrics produce better network lifetime. MaxLQI is
better than the remaining energy metric which is followed
by the degree of connectivity metric (see Figure 17(a)).
Load balancing mechanisms signiﬁcantly increase the average
network lifetime which is more large than the one of the simple
routing with more differences for MinLQI (see Figure 18(a))
and "Proximity with respect to the BS" metrics.
The time of ﬁrst packet loss occurs earlier for the degree
of connectivity metric. As we explained in the previous
sections, this result is also caused by the overhearing
phenomenon of which effects are more important for the
degree of connectivity metric with respect to other metrics.
The Proximity-BS metric improves the network lifetime by
minimizing the number of hops (see Figure 17(a)).
Compared to the simple routing, the load balancing mech-
anisms (see Figure 18(a)) signiﬁcantly increase the WSN
lifetime. However, even if the weighted round robin routing
leads to a better WSN lifetime than the round robin routing,

the gap between the two load balancing mechanisms is not
signiﬁcant for the MinLQI metric (see Figure 18(a)).
By rotating the achtophorous node this helps splitting
the load among different sensors. So, load balancing helps
delaying the moment of the ﬁrst node battery depletion of
and therefore extending the lifetime of the network: Load
balancing adds lifetime beneﬁts to the WSN.

The ﬁgures (see Figure 19 and Figure 20) show, depending
on network density, the evolution of the average remaining
energy after a complete cycle. The cycle is constituted by:
the network deployment, the detection of alarms and the data
routing towards the base station where each source node uses
L2RP to build its routing table. The cycle ends when all
nodes have sent their alarms.
The degree of connectivity and MaxLQI metrics are the
least energy efﬁcient metrics (see Figure 19). In contrast,
Proximity-BS and MinLQI are the metrics that ensure better
energy efﬁciency.
The weighted round-robin routing (W2R) leads to less
energy consumption than the round-robin routing which is
better than the simple routing whatever the metrics used. The
Figure 20 shows the result for the MaxLQI metric.
In summary, these results are natural consequences of the
previous ones. Indeed, for the MaxLQI metric of which the
average number of hops (average path length) is high, the
energy consumption is also large because of the increasingly
overhearing, latency, and overhead phenomena.

These two results (see Figure 21 and Figure 22) show
that the average percentage of lost packets decreases for
the MinLQI metric. The network lifetime increases for both
metrics when the number of achtophorous nodes varies from

3 to 5. This is not obvious to predict, because increasing the
number of achtophorous nodes might increase the risk of using
low-energy sensors in routing process, which could cause more
packet losses.
From a given number of achtophorous nodes, the result
should be reversed. Nevertheless, until the value AN = 5, it
remains within reasonable limits for a cold chain monitoring
application.
H. Impacts of the Unreliability of Wireless Links
In the context of our application, the warehouse hosts hun-
dreds of pallets, one upon the other. Each pallets is provided
with a temperature sensor. This environment is subjected to
some unreliabilities of the wireless links. In this section we
take into account such a phenomenon. At any given time t, for
a sensor Si, its unreliable links (Pr [ℓ(i, j, t) = Unreliable] =
1 in Formula (12)) with some neighbors are modeled by the
Poisson process of parameter γ(Si, t) calculated as follows:
γ(Si, t) =
µ
δ(Si)
(17)
where δ(Si) is the number of nodes located between the node
Si and the BS. If δ(Si) = 0, then the node Si has no elligible
achtophorous node.
At any given time t, for each sensor Si, γ(Si, t) is too
small, then the Poisson process returns a series Ti of integers
Ti, in which nonzero values Ti[j] denote the unreliable
links formed by Si with some of its neighbours Sj, i.e.
Pr [ℓ(i, j, t) = Unreliable] = 1 in Formula (12).

case, the load balancing also increases the network lifetime.
Indeed, the round-robin routing in high unreliable WSN
(µ = 0.1) is much better than the simple routing in low
unreliable links environment (µ = 0.01), even if the simple
routing produces lower average path length (see Figure 24)
than load balancing mechanisms. Even in the context of high
unreliable links, the load balancing routing produces better
LIF than the simple routing (see Figure 25), which means
that the load is more evenly shared between nodes.
This result pertained to the MinLQI metric, clearly shows
that the unreliabilities of the wireless links phenomena reduce
the WSN lifetime because of more retransmissions needed
in such an environment. But the key point of this result
relies on the fact that load balancing mechanisms also add
lifetime beneﬁts in high unreliable environment. Indeed, in
the case of simple routing, a weak link between a sensor
and its achtophorous node involves the sending of a new
"ROUTE REQUEST" message. In contrast, for load balancing
mechanisms, each sensor has several achtophorous nodes in its
routing table. If a link between a sensor and its achtophorous
node were to be unreliable, the source node ﬁrst examines the
quality of the link it forms with the next achtophorous node
listed in its routing table. So, if this link is reliable, it simply
sends the packet without having to request a new route.

Therefore, in load balancing mechanisms, a source node has
to send a new "ROUTE REQUEST" message, if and only if
all the links it forms with all the achtophorous nodes listed
in its routing table were to become unreliable at the same time.
In the scenarios which do not take into account the
unreliabilities of the wireless links, the L2RP protocol leads
to identical routes for the two load balancing mechanisms
(see Figure 11(a)). The Figure 24 shows the impacts of
the unreliabilities of the wireless links on the average path
lengths (number of hops) in an environment subjected to high
unreliable links (µ = 0.1). In this result, we observe that the
routes obtained with the round robin mechanism are now
different from those obtained with the weighted round robin
routing (W2R) (see Figure 24). This is due by the fact that
link quality parameters are very ﬁckle and time variant and
are greatly dependent on the poisson parameter γ(Si, t) (see
Formula 17).
The Figure 25 plots, for µ = 0.1, the impacts of high
unreliabilities of the wireless links on the LIF criterion per-
formance. This still conﬁrms the effectiveness of the load
balancing mechanisms in unreliable environments. Indeed, the
load imbalance factor (LIF) is lower for the round robin and
W2R routing compared to the simple routing. Contrary to the
previous result (see Figure 12(c)), this one (see Figure 25)
shows that the gap between the average LIF of the simple
routing mechanism and those obtained via the load balancing
routings decreases as the network density is increasing. Indeed,
the unreliabilities of the wireless links become more and
more important when the density of the WSN is increasing.
Consequently, load balancing mechanisms gradually begin to
loose some of their interest.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed the L2RP routing protocol
(Link Reliability based Routing Protocol) which takes into ac-
count the quality of the links formed by any source node with
the achtophorous nodes listed in its routing table. This avoids
sending data over a link disrupted, unreliable or unstable.
The L2RP protocol also includes load balancing mecha-
nisms where the source node, based on "ROUTE REPLY"
packets, is able to estimate the load sustainable by each of
its achtophorous node. This property allows L2RP to avoid
doing a per packet load-balancing by the source, as done in
[34], where the source node sends its data without being sure
of the capacity of the achtophorous node to sustain the load
assigned. Thus, by doing so, L2RP helps to reduce packet
losses.
Applications often
have their
speciﬁc objectives and
constraints, so it is essential to have the choice between
several possible settings when deploying a wireless sensor
networks. Thus, in its design, the L2RP protocol can use
any chosen metric. This allows L2RP to be able to support
different applications by offering the choice of the metric
which ensures the best performance in the speciﬁc context of
each application.
We therefore evaluated the L2RP performance based on
routing mechanisms (simple or load balancing) and then
presented a comparative study of the different metrics in each
routing mechanisms. This work has shown that:
• The degree of connectivity metric is the metric that leads
to the highest percentage of packet losses. This metric
also has the lowest network lifetime. Indeed, it is the
metric which is the most sensitive to the overhearing
phenomenon.
• The
Proximity-BS
metric
provides
better
energy
efﬁciency. With this metric, the alarms sent by any
sensor
reach
the
Base
Station
in
less
hops.
By
minimizing the number of hops, it helps in reducing
energy wastefulness due to overhearing, overhead and
latency.
• The LQI used as a metric by considering the best link
quality (the MaxLQI metric) leads to an inefﬁcient
routing
regardless
of
the
performance
criterion
considered. This conﬁrms our previous experimental
results obtained in [3]. The MaxLQI metric matches the
standard deﬁnition of the LQI used in the MultiHopLQI
routing algorithm [8]. Indeed, this metric is characterized
by a relatively high average number of hops. In the
absence of obstacles and any interferences, the best link
quality is often observed for the nodes which are located
relatively close to each other. By multiplying the number
of hops, the MaxLQI metric has the effect to increase
energy wastefulness due to overhearing, overhead and
latency.
• Accordingly, despite its popularity in WSN empirical
analysis based on TinyOS platforms, the MultiHopLQI
routing algorithm is not suitable for WSN applications,
because it uses the MaxLQI metric for route selection.
• By setting a given LQI threshold, i.e. a value of
acceptable LQI, and considering the lowest LQI value
beyond this threshold (the MinLQI metric), we obtain
an optimal LQI based metric which highly enhances
the energy efﬁciency. As the LQI decreases when the
distance between the nodes increases, the average path
length is larger for MaxLQI than for MinLQI: this
explains why MinLQI is more energy-efﬁcient than
MaxLQI. Then, the average percentage of packet losses
is larger for MaxLQI. There is a trade-off between routes
consisting of good links quality and small average path
length (i.e without too many retransmissions).
• This interesting result shows that it is better for LQI based
routing algorithm to promote links of intermediate quality

(such as MinLQI metric) to avoid:
– better links which are synonymous of nodes located
relatively close to each other and also synonymous
of higher number of hops which are responsible for
excessive energy consumption;
– bad links (low quality) which are synonymous of
higher percentage of packet losses.
• The load balancing mechanisms signiﬁcantly improve
the routing efﬁciency by extending the network lifetime,
while minimizing the average percentage of packet
losses. The load balancing also helps evenly splitting the
load on all nodes in the WSN.
• Increasing the number of achtophorous nodes improves
the network performance: a low average of packet losses
and a longer network lifetime.
• The composite metric, resulting of the remaining energy
metric combined with the Proximity-BS metric, offers
good routing performance. This metric is interesting, as
each node ignores the settings of its neighbors (such as
the remaining energy, the position) when selecting its
achtophorous nodes.
• Since it is LQI based routing algorithm, the question that
naturally arises is how L2RP behave in an environment
subjected to high unrelibilities of the wireless links.
Simulation results has shown that, such an environment
slightly impacts the L2RP efﬁciency. Generally, packet
loss percentage is relatively low because in L2RP a
source node avoids sending data to an achtophorous node
with which it forms an unreliable link at the moment it
has data to transmit.
Embedded with load balancing mechanisms, L2RP adds
lifetime beneﬁts to the wireless sensor network. Nevertheless,
it would be more proﬁtable to combine L2RP with aggregation
techniques like cluster formation and data aggregation in order
to gain more scalability and lifetime. So, in [41] we used L2RP
in a cold chain monitoring application where regular sensors
send alarms to their respective clusterheads which aggregate
received alarms and then forward the aggregated data towards
the BS using the L2RP routing protocol. In this application
L2RP is run with the weighted round robin load balancing
mechanism using the "MinLQI" metric.
