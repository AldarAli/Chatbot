Abstract— Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are paradigms 
that offer an alternative communication channel between 
neural activity generated in the brain and the users’ external 
environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the 
feasibility of designing and developing a multiclass BCI system 
based on a single limb movement due to the factor, high 
dimensional control channels would expand the capacity of 
BCI application (multidimensional control of neuroprosthesis). 
This paper also proposes a method to identify the optimal 
frequency band and recording channel to achieve the best 
classification 
result. 
Twenty 
eight 
surface 
electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes are used to record 
brain activity from eleven subjects whilst imagining and 
performing right wrist burst point-to-point movement towards 
multiple directions using a high density montage with 10-10 
electrode placement locations focusing on motor cortex areas. 
Two types of spatial filters namely Common average reference 
(CAR) and Laplacian (LAP) filter have been implemented and 
results are compared to enhance the EEG signal. Features are 
extracted from the filtered signals using event related spectral 
perturbation (ERSP) and power spectrum. Feature vectors are 
classified by k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) and quadratic 
discriminant analysis (QDA) classifiers. The results indicate 
that the majority of the optimum classification results are 
obtained from features extracted from contralateral electrodes 
in the gamma band. Based on  a single trial, the average of the 
classification accuracy using LAP filter and k-NN classifier 
across the subjects in predicting intention and direction of 
movement is  68% and 62% for motor imagery and motor 
performance respectively; which is significantly higher than 
chance. The classification result from the majority of subjects 
shows that, it is possible and achievable to develop multiclass 
BCI systems based on a single limb.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system applies and 
decodes 
the 
brain 
signature 
obtained 
from 
an 
electroencephalogram (EEG) signal and translates this 
information into a usable signal such as command signals  
to control and/or communicate with augmentative and 
assistive devices [1]. Implementation of a BCI system in 
assisting neurally impaired patients in controlling an 
orthosis 
device 
[2], 
operating 
functional 
electrical 
stimulation (FES) [3] or operating spelling device [4] have 
evidently proven that a BCI system can potentially provide 
alternative communication methods for the neurally 
impaired community in particular locked in patients.  
Despite of recent achievements, most existing BCI 
systems are still under development and constrained by 
limitations. For instance, the current BCI system faces a 
challenge when it comes to equip a system with multiple 
independent control channels [5] due to the low dimensional 
control. BCI systems with low dimensional control only 
manage to recognise a limited number of mental tasks as 
control command [6]. Most current BCI systems are based 
on two-class [27]. 
There a number of approaches to overcome the multi-
dimensional control problem; one such approach is by using 
a combination of mental tasks that involve motor imagery of 
more than one limb, e.g., left hand, right hand, left foot and 
right foot [7].  Although this approach increases the control 
dimensionality, but it could be challenging to neurally 
impaired patients as they have limited access/control over 
their limbs and their brain signatures are affected by 
deafferentation and cortical reorganisation of brain regions 
which depend on the duration, level and type of disease [8]. 
The primary goal of this study is to explore the feasibility 
of designing and developing a four-class BCI system based 
on the movement of a single limb; namely the movement of 
the right wrist. The wrist movements are burst point-to-point 
centre-out movements comprising of extension (toward 
direction 3 o’clock), flexion (toward direction 9 o’clock), 
ulnar (toward direction 6 o’clock) and radial (toward 
direction 12 o’clock). This study also investigates the 
optimum frequency band and recording channels across the 
participating subjects that contribute to the highest 
classification 
accuracy 
in 
a 
motor 
performance                       
(including motor imagery) paradigm.

The rest of the paper is structured as follow: Section II 
describes the implemented experiment protocol and data 
analysis procedure. Sections III presents the results of the 
experiment and section IV elaborates the discussion on 
presented results. The paper end with a conclusion of the 
findings in section V. 
 
II. 
METHODS 
The set-up of the experiment, data acquisition and the 
data analysis will be explained in this session. 
A. Experimental Setup  
Surface EEG signals were recorded from 11 subjects (9 
males). All subjects had no history of neurologic disease and 
with 20/20 vision or corrected vision. Subjects were 
postgraduate students of the University of Strathclyde with 
average age of 28.91 years.  All subjects have given their 
informed consent.  
The experimental procedure was approved by the 
Departmental 
Ethics 
Committee 
of 
the 
Biomedical 
Engineering Department of the University of Strathclyde. 
Each subject was comfortably seated on a wheelchair 
facing a LCD monitor at a distance of 1 meter from the 
screen. As it can be seen in Figure 1 that    a manipulandum 
placed on the right side of the wheelchair, which allows the 
movement of the wrist in multi-direction. During the data 
recording process, subjects were required to hold the 
manipulandum 
and 
attempt, 
perform 
and 
imagine 
(kinesthetic imagery) performing right wrist burst, point to 
point center out movement towards four directions (3, 6 , 9 
and 12 o'clock) triggered by a visual cue showing the target 
direction on the monitor. On reaching the target position, 
subjects had to hold the manipulandum for as long as the 
cue remained visible on the screen and later reposition the 
manipulandum to the neutral position (0) according to the 
cue. While in the neutral position, subjects were instructed 
to stay calm and relaxed. 
The participating subjects manage to complete all trials 
for motor imagery and motor performance. Each experiment 
comprised of trials of both motor imagery and motor 
performance towards four different directions, establishing 
50 repetitions per direction. 
 
 
Figure 1. Experimental Recording Set Up 
Figure 1 shows the implemented set up during recording 
session. Subject is seated on the wheelchair and made to face 
a LCD monitor screen at distance of 1 m with a 
manipulandum attached to him on his right side. Neuroscan  
Synamp system was used for EEG and EMG signal 
recording. 
Movement 
signal 
was 
recorded 
from 
manipulandum using Cambridge Electronic Design 1401 
(CED). All systems were synchronized during recording 
process. 
 
B. Data Recording Set Up 
EEG, surface electromyography (sEMG) and movement 
signals were recorded simultaneously during the trials. EEG 
signal was recorded using 28 electrodes (earlobe reference) 
placed in a high density montage on the scalp according to 
10-10 system and the EMG signal was recorded from flexor 
carpi radialis, extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor carpi radialis 
brevis and extensor carpi radialis longus muscles. The sEMG 
signal was recorded in order to make sure that there is no 
movement during motor imagery experiments. Both EEG 
and sEMG were recorded using Curry Neuroimaging Suite 
7.0.8 XSB software with NeuroScanTM Synamps2 at a 
sampling frequency of 2 KHz.  
The movement signal was recorded using two precision 
servo potentiometers that are attached to the manipulandum 
in order to detect the onset and the direction of movement. It 
was recorded by Spike2 software through CED 1401 
(Cambridge Electronic Design, United Kingdom) at a 
sampling frequency of 100Hz. 
 
C. Data Preprocessing  
The recorded data from motor imagery and motor 
performance experiments were processed offline using 
MATLAB. EEG was epoched using EEGLAB toolbox 
version 12 [9] based on type of experiments (motor imagery 
and motor performance) and categorised according to the 
direction toward 3, 6, 9 and 12 o’clock. For instance, in the 
motor performance data, the EEG signal was epoched 3 
seconds before and 3 seconds after the onset of movement 
whereas, for the motor imagery, the EEG signal was epoched 
3 seconds before and 3 seconds after the visual cue 
presentation. 
The epoched EEG was filtered by a notch filter to 
remove any 50 Hz power line interference [10] and a high 
pass filter with cutoff 0.5 Hz in order to extract EEG 
component signal such as delta/δ (1-4 Hz), theta/θ (5-7 Hz), 
alpha/α (8-12 Hz), beta/β (13-30 Hz) and gamma/γ (31+ Hz) 
[11].  Common average reference (CAR) [12] and Laplacian 
(LAP) [13] spatial filtering methods to improve localisation 
were applied before any further processing of the data. 
 
D. Features Extraction and Classification  
In this study, we are interested in extracting salient 
features from: (1) Event Related Spectral Perturbation 
(ERSP) which is a 2D frequency-by-latency map, and (2) the 
distribution of Power spectrum. ERSP is a generalisation of

Event Related Desynchronisation (ERD)/Event Related 
Synchronization (ERS) which visualizes the entire spectrum 
in the form of baseline-normalised spectrogram. ERD refer 
to the decrease in synchronisation of firing neuron that cause 
a decrease of power in specific frequency band and can be 
identified by a decrease in signal amplitude. On the other 
hand, ERS is characterised by an increase of power in 
specific 
frequency 
band 
due 
to 
the 
increased 
in 
synchronisation of firing neuron and can be identified by 
increase in signal amplitude. ERSP is computed where each 
epoch was divided into a number of overlapping windows 
and spectral power is calculated for each window. The 
calculated spectral power was then normalized (divided with 
the baseline spectra calculated from the EEG immediately 
before each event) and averaged over all the trials.  This 
whole process was done using EEGLAB software version 12 
[14] [15]. Power Spectrum indicates the distribution level of 
the signal power for each of the frequency and latency. The 
Power Spectrum in the δ-, θ-, α-, β- and γ- bands from the 
ERSP was computed using code adapted from the EEGLAB 
version 12. 
Features were extracted based on the type of response, 
either predicting the intention of movement or the direction 
of movement. For the former response, we identify the 
subject’s intention to move by distinguishing whether the 
subject is static or moving his/her right wrist. For the latter 
response, we try to predict the direction of the movement in 
addition to the intention of movement.  
Predicting 
the 
intention 
of 
movement 
required 
identifying features extracted during both motor imagery and 
the motor performance for all four directions. Features were 
extracted from a 500ms window before onset of wrist 
movement (t=0).  On the other hand, for motor imagery, 
features were extracted from a 500ms window after cue 
presentation (t=0) [16].   
Conversely predicting intention and direction of 
movement required further analysis which involved 
statistical testing.  In order to determine whether a 
statistically significant difference exists in the extracted 
features between the four directions, analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) has been implemented [17]. Repeated measure of 
ANOVA was applied across the four directions through 
ERSP at each time and frequency point with p value was set 
at 0.05.  The Power Spectrum from the ERSP with p-value 
<0.05 was concatenated to form the feature vectors.  
 To reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors, 
Principal component analysis (PCA) has been used [18]. The 
principal components that represent 90% (PCA is set to 90% 
in order to get a balance between features dimension, 
computational time, complexity of classification process and 
computation demands) variance of the original data formed 
the new reduced dimension feature vector for the 
classification. The new features vectors were randomly split 
into training and testing data sets [19]. The training and 
testing datasets were randomly selected using the MATLAB 
function k fold cross validation (where k=10 was chosen) 
[20] and fed to the classifier as input. We used two different 
classifiers for comparison and verification: k-Nearest 
Neighbours (k-NN) (where k=7) [21] and quadratic 
discriminant analysis (QDA) classifiers [22].

RESULTS 
A. Results of Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) 
Figures 2 and 3 show a typical ERSP results of subject 
S1 for both motor imagery and motor performance 
respectively. The top four panels represent the average ERSP 
maps for all four directions and the ANOVA result for the 
electrode C3 using CAR. Although both of the figures using 
CAR, still they demonstrated different mapping results.  
For instance, in Figure 2, ERD was detected 
approximately 300ms post visual cue presentation (t=0) and 
this is illustrated by the presence of a blue region in all four 
directions. ERD is evidently detected in the β- (in all four 
directions 3, 6, 9 and 12 o'clock) and the γ- (in all four 
directions 3, 6, 9 and 12 o'clock) band. 
On the other hand, in Figure 3, the appearance of ERD is 
detected approximately 400ms preceding onset of movement 
(t=0) in the β- (in directions 3, 6, 9 and 12 o'clock) and in the 
γ- (directions 3 and 9 o'clock) band. In this study, the 
detection of the ERD prior to onset of movement indicates 
the intention of movement (planning phase).

Figure 3. ERSP and p value of channel C3 for detection intention of 
movement using CAR Method.  
 
     Referring to Figure 3, vertical axes represent the 
frequency of signal and horizontal axes represent the time. 
Top four represent the ERSP for direction towards 3, 6, 9 
and 12 o’clock respectively (blue shows ERD and red shows 
ERS) and the bottom one represent p value (blue indicate 
significance area in ERSP among four directions). t=0 
signifies the display of the visual cue. 
Even though the mapping results of ERSP of four 
directions are different between the Figures 2 and 3, both 
figures share a similarity when it comes to the ANOVA 
results. The ANOVA results that is presented by the p-value 
(p<0.5 for the blue region) indicate that there are significant 
differences in the ERSP among four directions.  
 
B. Predicting Intention and Direction of Movement 
The classification results in predicting intention and 
direction of movement for both of motor imagery and motor 
performance are based on single trial classification and 
presented in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. Tables 1 and 2 
show the detail of the results for each figure including the 
frequency band (b) and channel (Ch) associated with the 
maximum classification accuracy for motor imagery and 
motor performance respectively.  
Figure 4 and Table 1 present the results of predicting 
intention and direction of movement for the motor imagery 
scenario using k-NN and QDA classifier for both spatial 
filters, namely CAR and LPA. The classification results lie 
between 35% - 95% using a combination of CAR filtering 
and a k-NN classifier (36% of the maximum classification 
results are contributed to features in the γ band and 64% are 
associated with contralateral electrodes) and lie between 
40% - 80% using the QDA classifier (27% of the maximum 
classification results are contributed to both δ and γ band, 
and 73% of it are recorded from the contralateral electrodes).  
On the other hand, the classification results of LAP 
filtering combined with classifiers k-NN and QDA dwell 
within the range of 38% - 96% (54% of the maximum 
classification results are contributed by γ band, and 73% of it 
recorded from contralateral electrodes) and 41% - 76% (45% 
of the maximum classification results are contributed by γ 
band, and 55% of it recorded from ipsilateral electrodes) 
respectively.  
Distribution of the classification results show that, only 
subject three give a consistence and high classification result 
for both spatial filters (CAR and LAP) using k-NN and QDA 
classifier. Moreover, it also indicates that LAP has higher 
average classification accuracy compared to CAR using both 
of the classifier namely k-NN and QDA.   
 
 
Figure 4. Classification results in predicting intention and direction of 
movement for motor imagery.  
 
Apart from that, LAP and CAR have same thing in 
common, that is k-NN classifier offer higher average 
classification over QDA. Besides that, the highest 
classification accuracy contributed by the high density 
electrodes highlight the importance of the high density 
montage used.

Dissemination of the classification result demonstrate that, 
subject three give a consistence and high classification result 
for both spatial filters (CAR and LAP) using k-NN and QDA 
classifier. Additionally LAP has higher average classification 
accuracy compared to CAR using both of the classifier 
namely k-NN and QDA. Subsequently for both spatial filters 
(CAR and LAP) k-NN classifier has higher average 
classification accuracy compared to QDA. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION  
Based on the classification’s result criteria, this study 
demonstrates that the proposed methodology and features 
extraction approach are capable of increasing and providing 
multiple control signals using single limb. It is undeniable 
that, detecting and discriminating the motor imagery and/or 
motor performance within the same limb is a challenging 
task. This is because of the motor tasks actives regions have 
very close representations on the motor cortex area [23] 
[24].  
Although it is difficult - but not impossible,   Liao et al. 
[25] managed to distinguish right hand finger movements 
(thumb, index, middle, ring and little) using power spectral 
changes as features. Thus, we apply centre out right wrist 
movement (flexion, extension, ulnar and radial) and power 
spectrum as features with the hypothesis that there is a 
difference in distribution of power spectrum among the four 
different directions. The hypothesis is tested using ANOVA 
and the results showed that there is significance difference 
with p value < 0.05 among the different directions. 
The classification results from motor imagery and motor 
performance experiments indicate that, the maximum 
classification electrodes dominantly from contralateral 
electrodes. This is because movement related neural activity 
is lateralized where a significance occurrence of ERD over 
contralateral side whereas a significance occurrence of ERS 
over ipsilateral side of the brain during planned and 
terminated movements respectively [26]. Apart from that, 
the maximum classification electrode can be either the same 
or the nearest neighbour of that electrode when classified by 
different classifier. This is would be an advantage for the 
BCI design because, improper placement of BCI cap would 
not have much effect to the BCI system itself. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION  
In this paper, we have demonstrated the feasibility of 
developing a single trial four class BCI systems based on a 
motor performance of a single limb, namely the wrist 
moving in four different directions using a single trial. This 
is evidently supported by detecting ERD and ERS in both of 
motor imagery and motor performance for all four 
directions extracted from ERSP maps. Additionally, the p 
values estimated from ANOVA test verify that there is 
significant difference of the extracted features among the 
four directions. 
Moreover, the classification results of predicting 
intention of movement for both of motor imagery and motor 
performance emphasised that, the majority of the maximum 
classification accuracy are recorded from contralateral 
electrodes and from γ band features. 
Subsequently, the classification results from both of 
motor imagery and motor performance in predicting 
intention and direction of movement highlighted that, all of 
the maximum classification accuracy are contributed by

contralateral electrodes. The majority of the maximum 
classifications are associated with features from the γ band.  
The findings from this study highlight the importance of 
using high density montage electrodes placement and shows 
with experimental evidence that LAP is superior to CAR in 
terms of source localisation.
