Abstract‚Äî The performance of a manufacturing process and 
the need to increase throughput and reduce the cost of 
production are of the highest interest among modern 
manufacturers. Classical mathematical models developed were 
used to describe the operation of a robot during a complex pick 
and place task in a virtual manufacturing environment. The 
design parameters of the conveyor system were examined. 
Existing designs were studied and modeled to select the best 
operating 
speed 
to 
optimize 
throughput 
during 
the 
manufacturing system. The modeled design parameters were 
analyzed using MATLAB. The results were presented 
graphically with an optimal throughput obtained at an 
operating speed of 390m/seconds, operating time of 0.4secs, 
and power consumption of 12700W. The operation of the 
robotic arm was manipulated during service to determine the 
angle of placement that yielded a consistent and efficient 
throughput during the pick and place task. Consequently, an 
optimal throughput was reached when setting the manipulator 
at an angle of 88 degrees.

INTRODUCTION 
The goals of the fourth industrial technology were to 
improve the efficiency of the manufacturing process, 
improve product quality, and enhance safety and security in 
manufacturing industries. Industry 4.0 involved the 
integration of intelligent, disruptive technologies into the 
manufacturing environment by focusing on automation, 
real-time data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc. 
The new technology uses its automation approach to boost 
productivity and output, increase efficiency, and create an 
intelligent manufacturing environment. [1][2]. Industry 4.0 
has emerged with various disruptive technologies that can 
transform multiple manufacturing sectors from labor-
intensive processes to a modernized automation process 
[3][4]. Implementing robotics in an advanced manufacturing 
environment has been a trending technology that requires 
further studies, innovations, and adaptations.      
Robotics has been used in a wide range of applications. 
Applications include transporting materials and parts from 
conveyor systems to various stations, assembling parts, 
painting, sorting, packaging and labeling, inspection and 
testing, picking and place, materials handling, palletizing, 
etc. [5]. The applications of robotic technology to various 
systems were achieved with appreciable high speed, 
precision, and endurance limit [6][7]. The implementation 
of robotics in the manufacturing sector has improved the 
economic situation of various industries by enhancing the 
production process, product quality, and throughput rate. 
The robotic system uses several innovative sensory devices 
and control techniques to improve agility and productivity 
[8][9]. The importance of research in robotics in a recent 
study is to find solutions to manufacturing problems [10]. 
Enhancing a manufacturing process has become more 
apparent due to its technological impact on an advanced 
manufacturing environment. Recently, there have been 
various attempts to improve the service of industrial robots 
to perform some complex and time-consuming tasks in the 
manufacturing environment [11]. Implementing industrial 
robots as a disruptive technology in performing tasks has 
enabled technological growth in the manufacturing sector 
[12]. The behavior of a manufacturing system can be better 
expressed with classical models. In this paper, the 
throughput rate of a manufacturing system was enhanced. 
Classical mathematical models were used to describe a 
manufacturing environment, whereas robot was used to 
perform a complex pick and place task. The scenario was 
analyzed 
using 
various 
mathematical 
tools. 
The 
manufacturing scenario was validated by manipulating the 
robotic arm motion to select the best operating angle.

introduced 
tremendous 
changes 
in 
the 
advanced 
manufacturing environment. Robots have been widely used 
among manufacturers due to their exceptional efficiency and 
ability to perform complex tasks within the shortest period 
[14][15]. 
Robotics 
applications 
reinforced 
the 
manufacturing industries and enabled competitiveness 
among manufacturers [16]. 
Various disruptive technologies have been developed to 
support and enhance the smooth running of multiple stages 
of the manufacturing processes [17][18]. The use of 
automation in augmenting human activities has increasingly 
improved the efficiency of the manufacturing processes. 
Industrial robots are efficient automation tools with higher 
flexibility and can be programmed to perform various tasks 
within a short time [19][20]. The research presented in [20] 
[21][22] showed how robotic manufacturing systems were 
optimized for optimal efficiency and productivity. The part's 
positioning to be picked up can affect the robot's 
performance in an advanced manufacturing environment 
[23][24]. In this present work, robots were implemented to 
perform a pick and place task. The scenario was studied to 
determine the best angle of twist that can produce an 
optimal throughput rate. The research showed that at an 
angle of 88 degrees, the manipulator performed excellently 
as when performing the desired task. This research outcome 
can be useful among manufacturers in the competitive 
market. 
III. 
METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  
A virtual manufacturing scenario was developed and 
studied to determine the impact of using a robot to perform 
the complex pick and place task in a manufacturing 
environment. 
Classical 
mathematical 
models 
were 
developed to describe each process involved. The design 
parameters of an existing conveyor system were studied and 
simulated to obtain the best design parameter that can yield 
an optimal throughput rate during a manufacturing process. 
Also, the waiting time involved during the packaging stage 
was modeled and studied. The 
manufacturing 
process 
involved parts arriving via a conveyor system from multiple 
stations to a buffer station. The arriving parts were picked 
up and placed by a robot.  
The arrival behavior followed a Poisson process with 
varying mean arrival rates. The arrival of the parts from the 
buffer station took the form of a negative exponential 
distribution and observed the impatient behavior of 
customers in the M/G/I queuing system. The M/G/I queuing 
system follows a Poisson process varying with mean arrival 
rate Œª with a general service time distribution. The 
repeatability motion of the robotic arm ensures the system 
has a deterministic feeding time ùúá (mean service time). Parts 
that were not picked up during the initial cycle were 
redirected for service in the next cycle.  
Mathematical models were developed and analyzed using 
the queuing mathematical theory. The average queuing time 
was modeled. This enabled proper optimization of the 
performance of each robot with its corresponding queue. 
Various mathematical expressions were developed and 
solved using the Newton-Rap son iteration method. Some 
values were assumed and implemented into the equation to 
test the efficiency of the models.  
A. Model analysis for an optimal throughput rate 
    During the complex pick and place task, the robot does 
not pick up all arriving parts as the conveyor move past the 
vision camera. Other parts were redirected to join the 
following arriving parts. During the traveling period of 
parts, there existed a continuous movement of parts with a 
minimum distance/gapŒ± between the work envelope and the 
boundaries within which the arriving parts exist. The 
number of visible parts was fed along with the conveyor 
system and denoted as Nf. The center point of the arriving 
part was determined within the Height and width of the 
work envelope. The Diameter of the part fed into the 
process was assumed to be less than 20mm. The velocities 
of the conveyor belts were the same.  
Assumptions 
‚û¢ The system was not saturated or starved.  
‚û¢ There exist continuous motion in the conveyor 
system 
‚û¢ The Height and width of the work envelope were 
assumed to be equal 
‚û¢ All parts were well guided to avoid slipping off 
 
The following notations and parameters were used 
to arrive at a suitable expression that was implemented to 
obtain higher throughput. 
 
Notation/parameters 
Nf=Number of part fed through the work envelope 
c = Centre of work envelope 
d = Diameter of fed part 
ùõº = Minimum clearance required = d/2 
w = Height, and width of the workpiece 
Pb=  probability that work has been fully cleared 
v= Velocity of the belt 
Tr= The robot throughput rate 
ùëÖùëè=The arrival rate of parts from the conveyor 
(parts/mm2). 
An impatient customer's renewal theorem was implemented 
to obtain a suitable mathematical expression for optimal 
throughput. In (1), the Velocity of the conveyor system v is 
expressed as: 
 
ùëâ =
ùúãùê∑ùëõ

Equation (2) was developed to represent the probability that 
the work piece has been fully cleared from the work 
envelope. 
ùëùùëè =
(ùë§‚àíùëë‚àí2ùõº)2
(ùë§‚àíùëë)2

    In equation(3), the center of the work envelope c was 
modeled while considering the width and height of the work

Similarly, in  (4), the expression for the arrival rate of parts 
from the conveyor to the server (robot) was modeled as: 
ùëüùëè = 
1
ùëê
(ùë§‚àíùëë)2ùë£
ùë§ùúã(ùõº+ùëë)2  
(4) 
    In (5), the number of parts fed through the work envelope 
was obtained by considering the width and height of the 
work envelope, the Velocity of the conveyor, the probability 
of cleared work from the work envelope, the center of the 
work envelope, and the arrival rate of parts from buffer 
station to the pickup point.

ùë£) ùëüùëèùëùùëèùëí‚àíùëüùëèùëê 
(5) 
    The throughput rate was also determined by finding the 
relationship between the number of parts fed through the 
work envelope, the width of the work envelope, and 
Velocity of the conveyor system, as indicated in equation 
(6).

B. Mathematical Model for Queuing Theory and Newton-
Rap son. 
The model used in the research described the waiting 
time during the packaging stage in a virtual manufacturing 
environment. The system performance was modeled using a 
Poisson distribution function where the service times were 
exponentially distributed. Classical mathematical models 
were developed for describing and making a decision in the 
packaging stage of the virtual manufacturing process.  
Parameters were assumed under operating conditions, 
and values were effectively used to describe the 
manufacturing system. Parameters that were used within the 
waiting line model include the cost of waiting per 
hour (ùê∂ùë§), the average number of product in queue (ùêøùë†), the 
cost of robot/hour (ùê∂ùëù ), the average number of product 
arriving from the machine per unit time (ùúÜùëñ), packaging rate 
which represented the service rate per unit time measured 
per hour ( ¬µ ), utility factor of the server which is the 
robot(ùúåùëõ). 
The queuing mathematical theory was then used in 
analyzing 
the 
classical 
models, 
and 
the 
queuing 
mathematical theory was used in analyzing the classical 
models. The models that were used in representing the 
packaging stage is summarized below: 
 
 
The products arrival rate was presented as 
‚àë
ùúÜùëñ
ùëõ
ùëñ=1
(t) =  ùëõùúÜ(ùë°) 
(7) 
A discrete value was assumed for the total number of 
products arriving during the packaging stage and was 
expressed as: 
ùëÅ = ùëõùúÜùë°x t                       (8) 
Total product packed by available robots was expressed as: 
ùúáùëó(ùë°) √ó ùë° √ó ùëö                        (9) 
During the packaging phase, the utility factor of robots was 
expressed as:                                         
ùúåùëõ(ùë°) = 
ùúÜùëñ(t)
ùúáùëó(ùë°) 
 
(10) 
The mean queue time required by each robot and the 
production rate of each robot was expressed as: 
ùëùùëó(ùë°) = (ùúÜùëñ + ùúáùëó)ùúåùëõ(ùë°) + ùúÜùëñùúåùëõ‚àí1 (ùë°) + ùúåùëõ+1 (ùë°) (11) 
 
The overall productivity rate of the system ùúåùëõ(ùë°)  was 
modeled as: 
ùúåùëõ(ùë°) = (‚àë
ùúÜùëñ
ùëõ
ùëñ=1
+ ‚àë
ùúÜùëñ

ùëö
ùëó=1
 (12) 
 
 
For a discrete value of time t; 
ùúåùëõ(ùë°) = ùúåùëõ(t) +  ùúÜùëõùúåùëõ‚àí1 (ùë°) + ¬µ(ùë°)ùúåùëõ+1 (ùë°)      (13) 
The waiting time denoted by W is expressed in 14: 
ùëä = ‚àë
ùúáùëó
ùëö
ùëó=1

Waiting time (unit/hour) expressed as: 
ùêøùë† =

nùúÜùë°‚àímùúáùëó
                                    (15) 
The cost of production T is given in (16) 
  ùëá = ùëöùëêùëùùúáùëó + ùëêùë§ùúåùëõùë§ùêøùë†                                  (16)                      
 
After substituting the parameters into (16), the production 
cost gives: 
ùëá =  ùëöùê∂ùëùùúáùëó + ùê∂ùë§ (
ùúÜùëñ

(ùúáùëó(mùúáùëó‚àínùúÜùëñ)2)                    (17)               
The system's performance was optimized using the waiting 
time model expressed in (15). The optimization process was 
achieved by differentiating the model to the service rate of 
each robot. 
ùê∂ùëù +
ùúÜ2[(ùúá‚àíùúÜ)2+2ùúá(ùúá‚àíùúÜ)]
ùúá2(ùúá‚àíùúÜ)4
= 0   (18) 
The model for optimal service was modeled as: 
ùê∂ùëùùúá5‚àí 3ùê∂ùëùùúá4ùúÜ+ 3ùê∂ùëùùúá3ùúÜ2‚àíùê∂ùëùùúá2ùúÜ3 +  3ùúáùúÜ2ùê∂ùë§ ‚àí
ùê∂ùë§ùúÜ3  = 0  (19) 
 
C. Simulation Using Newton-Raphson Method.  
    The Newton-Rap son Iteration method determined the 
approximate values used in the simulation of the models 
presented in the thesis. Newton-Rap son iteration method 
based its strategy on finding an approximate value for the 
root of a valued function of x [25]. Using the Newton-Rap 
son equation reduced the errors that were likely to set in 
when calculating the roots of functions. The efficiency of 
the Newton-Rap son method was the advantage it has over 
other methods. This method converges fast when compared 
with the Gauss Seidel, and other methods used in finding 
roots of quadratic equations. If it converges we get root 
(answer) in less number of steps. It requires only one guess.

Formulation of this method is simple. The Newton-Rap son 
iteration method was used to find the zeros of the arbitrary 
equations that were implemented during the manufacturing 
scenario; here, the specific root of a function depended on 
the initial value. The Newton-Rap son‚Äôs iteration strategy 
was utilized in the research as follows: 
 
    Given that the root of the derived equation was ùëü, let ùë•0 
be the estimated value of ùëü, ‚Ñé represents a measure of the 
approximate value of ùë•0 from the exact value. 
Where 
ùëü = ùë•0 + ‚Ñé, ‚Ñé = ùëü ‚àí ùë•0 
 
 
 (20) 
‚Ñé was very small and its linear approximation was 
represented as:  
0 = ùëì(ùëü) = ùëì(ùë•0 + ‚Ñé) ‚âà ùëì(ùë•0) + ‚Ñéùëì‚Ä≤(ùë•0)       (21) 
 
The mathematical model was valid if, ùëì‚Ä≤(ùë•0) was 
approximately equals to zero. 
‚Ñé ‚âà
ùëì(ùë•0)
ùëì‚Ä≤(ùë•0) 
 
 
(22) 
ùëü = ùë•0 + ‚Ñé ‚âà ùë•0 ‚àí
ùëì(ùë•0)
ùëì‚Ä≤(ùë•0)  
(23) 
Therefore, the estimated value ùë•1 of r yielded:  
ùë•1 = ùë•0 ‚àí
ùëì(ùë•0)
ùëì‚Ä≤(ùë•0)  
 
 
(24) 
Similarly, ùë•2 was derived as a function of  ùë•1 
ùë•2 = ùë•1 ‚àí
ùëì(ùë•1)
ùëì‚Ä≤(ùë•1)  
 
 
(25) 
For a required number of ùë•, ùë•ùëõ  is the next approximate 
value. 
Therefore, ùë•ùëõ+1 was modelled as: 
ùë•ùëõ+1 = ùë•ùëõ ‚àí
ùëì(ùë•ùëõ)
ùëì‚Ä≤(ùë•ùëõ) 
 
 
(26) 
The Newton Rap son Iteration was used for analyzing the 
service rate (¬µ),  and modeled as: 
ùúáùëõ+1 = ùúáùëõ ‚àí
ùëì(ùúáùëõ)
ùëì‚Ä≤(ùúáùëõ) 
 
 
(27) 
 
Equations (28) and (29) represented the first and second-
order of the Newton-Rap son iteration model of a 
production system [1].  
ùëì(ùúá) = ùê∂ùëùùúá5‚àí 3ùê∂ùëùùúá4ùúÜ+ 3ùê∂ùëùùúá3ùúÜ2‚àíùê∂ùëùùúá2ùúÜ3 + 3ùúáùúÜ2ùê∂ùë§ ‚àí

ùëì‚Ä≤(ùúá) = 5ùê∂ùëùùúá4‚àí 12ùê∂ùëùùúá3ùúÜ+ 9ùê∂ùëùùúá2ùúÜ2‚àí 2ùê∂ùëùùúáùúÜ3 +
 3ùúÜ2ùê∂ùë§(29) 
 
     The assumed values for the manufacturing scenario were 
(ùê∂ùëù = R2/hour, ùê∂ùë§ = R0.1/hour, ùúÜùëñ = 5 units/hour for 10 
machines, ¬µ  = 2 units per hour). The values were 
implemented into the general equation, solved, and the 
mathematical models were analyzed. Outcomes were 
simulated using the Newton-Rap son iteration expression. 
Close approximates values obtained were varied against 
each other to obtain the presented results graphically.  
D. Variation of the Robotic Arm for an Optimal 
Throughput. 
During the complex pick and place task, the robotic arm 
motion was manipulated to determine the best operating 
angle that gave an optimal throughput. Three different grasps 
were involved: the pre-grasp, the grasp, and the post grasp. 
The pre-grasp provided the suitable positioning of the end-
effectors away from the object position and coordinated the 
trajectory motion to avoid the occurrence of collision during 
service. Grasping involved positioning the end-effectors with 
their fingers ready to grip the object for the designated task, 
while the post-grasp involved moving away of the end-
effectors from the point where the object was grasped. The 
operation was controlled by computing the desired action for 
the end-effectors to perform the placing down task [25]. 
Arriving parts from the conveyor were picked up 
randomly by the manipulator following the first-in, first-out 
order (FIFO). The vision camera determines the object's 
position at the robot workspace for immediate pickup. The 
average operating time was studied and presented in Table 
1.

An operational variation of the manipulator motion was 
achieved by varying the angle between 81 degrees and 96 
degrees. The effects of varying the angle and other 
operating parameters were studied to determine its impacts 
on the throughput rate of the manipulator.  
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The performance of the robots was examined to study its 
effects on the throughput rate during a pick and place task. 
The result in Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the 
packaging stages of manufacturing against the arrival rate of 
the products. Fig. 1 indicates that the packaging rates 
increased as the arrival rate also increased. The result shown 
in Fig. 1 implied that the number of robots assumed in the 
decision-making for the proposed model was suitable to 
solve the waiting line model.

Figure 2. Average Waiting Time Against the Numbers of Robots Used. 
    During the packaging stage of manufacturing, the average 
waiting time gradually reduces as the number of robots used 
to perform the packaging task increases. If more robots were 
introduced to replace human labor, the lead time would be 
minimized an efficient production system can be obtained. 
This is illustrated in Fig 2. 
 
Figure 3. Products Arrival Rate Rb Against the Throughput Tr Rate 
(Parts/Secs). 
    The result in Fig. 3 shows an increasing throughput rate 
in correlation with the product arrival rate. The result shown 
in Figure 3 implies that the selected design parameters for 
the conveyor system were efficient. 
. 
Figure 4. The Average Time Spent for Pick-Place-Task 
    The robotic arm was varied during the pick and place task 
to determine the best angle of operation that could produce 
the highest throughput rate. Result obtained is presented in 
Fig. 4. This showed that the operational variables of the 
robotic arm gave an optimal throughput rate at an angle of 
88 degrees.  
 
Figure 5. Probability That Work is Being Cleared From the Conveyor 
Against the Throughput Rates. 
    The graph in Fig. 5 indicates that the work's probability 
has been cleared from the conveyor system when measured 
against the throughput rate. The result showed a closed-
looped graph which indicated that as the products arrived, 
the robots were efficient in picking up from the conveyor 
faster before it moved past it. The results confirm that the 
modeled design parameters selected for the conveyor system 
were efficient for optimal productivity.

speed that gave optimal throughput during a complex pick 
and place task was achieved. This was successfully carried 
out by developing some mathematical models to study the 
effect of varying the loads below and above the rated speed 
of the electric motor. Standard equations were further 
developed and analyzed. MATLAB was used to simulate 
and analyze the mathematical models and solved using the 
engineering equation solver (EES). Results were simulated 
to obtain and select relevant results that gave optimal 
throughput at an operating speed of 390m/secs, using time 
at 0.4secs, and at a power consumption of 12700W.  
    The average waiting time of the robots during the 
packaging process was studied using the analytical queuing 
theory. The average queuing time was further differentiated 
to optimize the performance of each robot with its 
corresponding queue. A general equation was developed 
and further analyzed using the Newton-Raphson iteration 
method. The results confirmed that the suggested model 
could be suitable for use when the queuing time needs to be 
controlled during the packaging stage in a real-life 
manufacturing scenario.  
Furthermore, the robotic arm motion was manipulated 
during the pick and place task to determine the best 
operating angle for an efficient production system. An 
optimal throughput rate during the pick and place task was 
achieved when the robotic arm was positioned at an angle of 
88 degrees. This research outcome can be useful among 
manufacturers in the competitive market. The research is 
still in progress whereby further studies will be carried out 
to determine how effective the derived angle will be when 
the manipulator is slated for heavy task.
