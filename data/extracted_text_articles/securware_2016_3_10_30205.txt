Abstract— This article is focused on a complex analysis of a 
direct punch. The direct punch is only one technique in a 
complex system – a professional defence. The professional 
defence is a necessary part of a physical protection, which is a 
basis in every security system. During this research, several 
methods were used for the measurement of velocity, force, body 
movement, etc., during a punch. The main goal was to find out 
the most significant characteristics of a direct punch. The 
second goal was to find some dependencies among groups of 
people with different training level in professional defence. 
Some parts of these experiments were published in the past, but 
this article contains the results of all the methods used. 
Keywords- direct punch; professional defence; complex 
analysis; velocity; force 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The direct punch is one of the basic elements of the 
majority of martial arts, sports and systems [1][2]. In 
professional defence, the direct punch is used to stop an 
attacker and to increase the distance between the defender 
and the attacker.  
The direct punch (Figure 1) is delivered by the arm 
following a direct line. The hitting area is a closed fist [4]. In 
the following experiment, the punch was delivered by the 
back hand. 
 
 
Figure 1. Direct punch [3] 
 
The professional defence [5] is a field which is primarily 
focused on the legal protection of personal interests against 
an attack. It covers various areas - the theory and the practice 
of defence, attack and prevention, scientific disciplines such 
as the tactics (e.g., skill in the counter attack), the strategy 
(the precautionary action) and the operation (the behaviour 
after a conflict situation). Moreover, it includes the 
knowledge of somatology and the chosen parts of crisis 
management, especially the phases of the conflict and 
solutions to conflict situations [5]. The professional defence 
is a necessary part of a physical protection, which is a basis 
in every security system. Without good quality physical 
protection, we cannot have effective security technologies 
and whole security system. The professional defence is the 
protection of client’s interests against the attack. The 
motivation is a salary, because it is a full-time job. On the 
other hand, a self-defense is the protection of our own 
interests against the attack. We can help other person too but 
our motivation is not the salary but a justice and a willingness 
of the help.  
 
The aim of this article is to describe the complex analysis 
of the direct punch. This study took five years and, during 
this time, five methods of measurement were used – the 
measurement of the velocity (camera Olympus i-Speed 2) [6-
8], the measurement of the force (strain gauge type SRK-3/V 
and strain gauge L6E-C3-300kg) [3][9][10][11], the 
measurement of the body movement (system VICON) and 
the measurement of the local muscle load (EMG = 
Electromyography). The second aim is to find some 
dependencies among groups of people with different training 
level. All results from each experiment are published together 
in this article in separate sections.  
 
During our study, the strain gauge type SRK-3/V suffered 
from many errors [12]. That was the reason why it was 
replaced by strain gauge L6E-C3-300kg. The results for the 
first strain gauge are not presented in this article because the 
data was corrupted, therefore irrelevant.  
 
In Section 2, the measurement of the velocity is described. 
Section 3 presents the measurement of the force. Next, in 
Section 4, we describe the measurement of the movement 
during the direct punch. In Section 5, we divided people into 
four groups according to their training level. In Section 6, the 
results and the most important graphs and tables are 
presented. We conclude in Section 7.  
 
Our motivation is a lack of research in this area. In Czech 
Republic, prof. Straus [13] did the similar research with less 
people and with help only one method of the measurement. 
In the world, this area has less quality research and articles.

II. 
MEASUREMENT OF VELOCITY 
 
A high-speed camera Olympus i-Speed 2 [14] was used 
for measuring of velocity. This camera had a CMOS 800x600 
sensor, full resolution recordings to 1000 fps (fps = frames 
per second) and 33000 fps maximum recording speed [15]. 
We used a recording speed of 1000 fps [8].  
The measuring station (Figure 2) consists of a punching 
bag and a construction of its suspension. A paper with two 
perpendicular lines was stuck on the right of the punching 
bag. The horizontal line was for leading the hand during 
movement. The aim of the vertical line was to determine the 
beginning of data analysis. The result was that all direct 
punches were measured in the same distance from punching 
bag. This distance was 60mm. The end of the measuring was 
at the moment when the movement of the hand stopped on 
axis “x” – the deformation of punching bag was at the 
maximum [6][7][8]. 
 
Figure 2. Measuring station with camera [8] 
A total of 61 participants took part in the experiment; 48 
men and 13 women. 
During the experiment, each person made one, two or 
three strikes. During the measurement, the target was 
positioned in such manner that the center of the punching bag 
was in line with the striking person´s shoulder. That way the 
punches have the maximum velocity and force (as there is no 
decomposition of force or velocity into the other axes). The 
person was made to stay in the same place for the whole 
experiment. Any unnecessary movement (e. g. lunge etc.) 
would lead to data distortion [8]. 
 
III. 
MEASUREMENT OF FORCE 
The strain gauge sensor L6E-C3-300kg (Figure 3) works 
as unilaterally cantilever bending beam [10]. During force 
delivery, the biggest deformation of sensor is in places with 
the thinnest walls – there are metal film strain gauges which 
change their electrical resistance depending on deformation. 
Strain gauges are plugged in Wheatstone bridge and this way 
it is possible to convert the difference of resistance to an 
electrical signal which we can processed [10]. 
 
  
 
Figure 3. Strain gauge sensor L6E-C3-300kg [10] 
The sensor is connected to the computer, which is used 
for data storage, through the strain gauge. The strain gauge 
type TENZ2334 is an electronic appliance that converts the 
signals to data that is stored in memory. The core of the 
appliance is a single-chip microcomputer that controls all of 
the activities. The strain gauge sensor is connected to this 
appliance via four-pole connector XLR by four conductors. 
The number of values measured by the sensor averages 
around 600 measurements per second while the data is 
immediately stored in the memory of a device with a capacity 
of 512 kB [5].  
The strain gauge sensor mentioned above was placed on 
the measuring station according to the following schematic 
(Figure 4):

A total of 220 participants took part in the experiment; 192 
men and 28 women. All participants were between 19 and 25 
years of age. During the experiment, each person made ten 
strikes. 
IV. 
MEASUREMENT OF MOVEMENT DURING MAKING OF 
DIRECT PUNCH 
The aim of this experiment was to visualize body 
movement during making of the direct punch. The system 
VICON, which is located in University Hospital in Brno 
(Figure 5), was used for this experiment. The laboratory is 
equipped with 8 video cameras (in height 1,4 m – 2,5 m) and 
illuminated by rings radiating infrared light with wavelength 
of 780nm. Retro-reflexive markers and infrared light allow

scanning of the whole trajectory of motion with accuracy of 
few hundredths of a millimeter. The type of cameras used was 
MX20+ with the resolution of 1600 x 1280 pixels and the 
frequency of 120 fps (frames per second). 
 
Figure 5. Preview of VICON laboratory 
Special markers (retro-reflexive markers) were placed on 
selected body parts (Figure 6). 
 
Figure 6. Marker placement 
During this experiment, a local muscle load was also 
measured with the help of EMG. The main hypothesis is that 
the level of training affects the utilization of individual 
muscles. The better trained person uses more muscles and 
makes the technique more effective. EMG is used in 
medicine, but it can also be used for measuring a local muscle 
load. An eight-channel EMG (3000 Hz) was used and it was 
connected to great muscles via electrodes. The monitored 
muscles were (Figure 7): 
- 
M. palmaris brevis (1) 
- 
M. biceps brachii  (2)

The experiment was performed with 21 participants: 15 
men and 6 women in age of 19 – 30 years. Each direct punch 
was performed 10 times in a row. 
 
V. 
GROUPS OF PEOPLE 
These experiments were done at Tomas Bata University in 
Zlin and in University Hospital in Brno. Most people who 
participated in the experiment were students from 19 to 30 
years of age. 
Based on previous training and experience, the 
participants were divided into the following categories 
[3][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]: 
 
Untrained – These people have never done any 
combat sport, martial art or combat system.  They 
had no theoretical knowledge of the striking 
technique. The technique was presented to these 
people before the experiment for safety reasons. 
Noted further as UTM (for men) and UTW (for 
women). 
 
Mid-trained - These people had the theoretical 
knowledge of striking techniques and did attend the 
Special physical training course for at least six 
months. The course was focused on self-defence and 
professional defence. Noted further as MTM (for 
men) and MTW (for women).  
 
Trained – These people have attended the Special 
physical training course for two or more years or 
practiced a combat sport or martial art for the same 
time period. Noted further as TM (for men) and TW 
(for women). 
 
Self-trained - These people did practice or still do 
practice (for less than 2 years) some combat sport, 
martial art or combat system. As there is no

separated into their own category. Noted further as 
STM (for men) and STW (for women).

RESULTS 
In this section, the results will be presented with the help 
of graphs and tables. The aim was to show the most important 
and interesting results.  
During the data analysis, two pieces of software were used 
– MINITAB and Microsoft Office Excel.  
A. Results from the measurement of the velocity 
Figures 8 to 10 depict the dependencies of mean velocity 
as a function of time. It is expected that trained men have the 
highest velocity and untrained women the lowest velocity. 
But these big differences are very interesting, together with 
differences among each group according to training level.   
 
Figure 8. Dependence of mean velocity on time [8] 
 
Figure 9. Dependence of mean velocity on time for men 
 
Figure 10. Dependence of mean velocity on time for women 
Clear differences among groups according to training 
level are evident from Figure 8 to 10. There are not only 
differences in maximum velocity, but also in time of direct 
punch. Very interesting is the fall of velocity. There is a very 
sharp fall in groups of trained men and women. Other groups 
have a less sharp fall.  
Table 2 presents the statistical data from the measurement 
of the velocity.

C. Results from VICON system and EMG 
For this experiment, the participants were a trained and an 
untrained woman, with the scanned marker placed on the 
back of the hand and in one case on the elbow. The process 
of direct punch was compared. As it is depicted in Figure 15, 
38
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2016.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-493-0
SECURWARE 2016 : The Tenth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

there is a difference in arm trajectory. It is clear that 
trajectories for direct punch of the untrained woman are 
absolutely different. Also, the marker on the elbow shows a 
visible round motion. The trained woman has both 
trajectories almost the same and direct. 
 
 
Figure 15. Untrained woman (left) and trained woman (right) – direct 
punch 
Figure 16 and 17 show that the EMG diagram for both 
women are very similar. The most visible difference is in 
utilization of abdominal muscles and triceps.  
 
 
Figure 16. EMG diagram for the untrained woman – direct punch 
 
Figure 17. EMG diagram for the trained woman – direct punch 
The trained woman (Figure 17) used these muscles more 
intensely than the untrained woman. A smaller difference is 
in the time of utilization of biceps that is shorter for the 
untrained woman (Figure 16).  
 
VII. 
CONCLUSION 
During a long term study, five methods were used for the 
analysis of the direct punch.  
The first method was to measure the velocity of the direct 
punch. Very interesting results are in the column Maximum, 
because we can see that differences between trained men and 
trained women are not too big. The difference is only 0.53 
m/s (6.73%). In the case of force, the difference is bigger, 
197.7 N (32.27%). 
The fall of velocity and force is also very interesting. There 
is a very sharp fall in the group of trained men and women. 
Other groups have a less sharp fall. 
The body movement was visualized very precisely with 
the help of the system VICON. We can see significant 
differences between the two groups of people divided 
according to their training level.  
This complex analysis showed that is possible to measure 
significant differences among people with different training 
level. In the future, the data analysis will be continued and 
the aim will be to find other dependencies.
