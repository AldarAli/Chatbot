scheme 
using 
jamming-free 
subspaces is presented to overcome the jamming attack. It is 
based on the adaptive beamforming using array antennas. The 
eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of the covariance matrix is 
used for separation between the jamming subspaces and the 
others. The proposed scheme determines the array weights by 
the jamming-free subspaces, which are composed of all 
subspaces except all jamming subspaces. The simulation 
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme nulls the 
jamming signal and receives all Global Position System (GPS) 
signal under the jamming environment.

 INTRODUCTION 
Even though GNSS is most widely used in many 
applications for position, velocity, and precise time (PNT), it 
is easily vulnerable to the jamming. As GPS jammers are 
purchased for about $30 over the online, GPS jamming 
events could be more often happened. It is known that a 1 
watt jammer can disturb GPS coarse/acquisition (C/A) code 
acquisition up to 63 km and C/A code tracking up to 32 km 
[1]. North Korea has repeatedly jammed GPS signals in 
South Korea during 6 days from March 31, 2016 to April 5. 
It was reported that 1,786 base stations for mobile 
telecommunication, 962 airplanes and 694 ships in South 
Korea experienced GPS disruptions. As many critical 
applications are still being dependent on absolute and 
accurate position or time by GNSS receiver, the GNSS 
jamming making the GNSS receiver malfunctioned is very 
critical threat to those applications using GNSS system. In 
order to overcome the jamming attack, the anti-jamming 
technique is needed. The spatial nulling scheme using array 
antennas has been considered as an effective technique. So, 
in this paper, the GNSS jamming nulling scheme based on 
array antennas is presented using jamming-free subspaces, 
which are composed of all subspaces except all jamming 
subspaces. The eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of 
covariance matrix is used for separation between the 
jamming subspaces and the others. The simulation results 
demonstrate that the proposed scheme nulls the jamming 
signal and receives GPS signal under the jamming 
environment. Sect. II describes the proposed scheme based 
on the signal model. In Sect. III, we present the simulation 
results of GNSS jamming nulling scheme. Finally, the 
conclusion is drawn in Sect. IV.

GNSS JAMMING NULLING SCHEME 
A. Signal model 
Firstly, we consider the signal model including GNSS 
signals, jamming signals, and noise. Assuming that M-
element array antenna with half-wavelength spacing, the 
samples vector x(n) after down-conversion and analog-to-
digital conversion can be expressed as

            (1) 
where s(n) and J(n) denotes the GNSS signal vector and 
the jamming signal vector respectively and v(n) is the 
additive white Gaussian noise vector. 
Let z(n) = wHx(n) be the output data of the beamformer 
where w is beamforming weight vector. Then, covariance is 
given by

B. Proposed scheme 
Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of the proposed scheme. 
As GNSS signals use the spread spectrum scheme, they 
have a spreading gain against jamming. Therefore, the 
power of jamming, which is vulnerable to GNSS signals is 
considerably higher than that of GNSS signal. Accordingly, 
after performing the EVD of the covariance matrix R, we 
can collect the jammer-free subspaces. The EVD of the 
covariance matrix R yields

where UJ and UJF denotes the eigenvector of the 
jamming subspaces with  equivalent power of J  and the 
jamming-free subspaces with equivalent power of JF  
The number of the jamming subspaces is determined by 
the minimum description length (MDL) or Akaike 
Information Criterion (AIC) [2]. Lastly, the beamforming 
array weighting vector w is calculated by the Linearly 
Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamformer [3]

SIMULATION RESULTS 
The uniform circular array (UCA) consisting of M=10 
sensors with half-wavelength spacing is used. A GPS 
satellite (PRN#12) and a jammer are located at (elevation 30º, 
azimuth 100º) and (elevation 50º, azimuth 200º). The 2046 
samples are used in one millisecond. The signal type and the 
power of jamming are used as the continuous wave (CW) in 
GPS L1 frequency with JSR=30dB. Fig. 2 shows that the 
proposed scheme is able to null the jamming signals.

CONCULSION 
The GNSS jamming nulling scheme based on array 
antennas was proposed using jamming-free subspaces. The 
EVD of covariance matrix is used for separation between the 
jamming subspaces and the others. The simulation results 
showed that the proposed scheme nulls the jamming signal 
and receives GPS signal under the jamming environment 
(JSR=30dB). Also, it was demonstrated that GPS signal 
(PRN 12) was successfully acquired after the proposed 
nulling scheme.
