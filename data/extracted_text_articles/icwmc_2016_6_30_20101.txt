Abstract—The minimum average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
per bit required for error-free transmission over a fading channel
is derived, and is shown to be equal to that of the additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, which is –1.6 dB. Discrete-time
algorithms are presented for timing and carrier synchronization,
as well as channel estimation, for multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM)
systems. The algorithms can be implemented on programmable
hardware and there is a large scope for parallel processing.

I. INTRODUCTION
As the world prepares for 5G [1]–[3] with its capabilities
like gigabits per second peak data rate for each user, smart
antennas, massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
transmitters and receivers [4]–[6] and millimeter wave fre-
quencies [7]–[10], the question remains [11]: What is the
operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per bit of the present
day mobile phones? The mobile phones indicate a typical
received signal strength of −100 dBm (10−10 mW), however
this is not the SNR per bit. It appears that the research in
telecommunications engineering is primarily driven by two
groups namely the RF (radio frequency) and microelectronics.
It also appears that advancement of technology implies asking
for more: more data rate, more bandwidth, more antennas and
ﬁnally more transistors on a single chip. However, there is
yet another group in telecommunications, which asks for less.
This is the algorithms group (perhaps this group has been too
busy writing too many complicated equations) for the physical
layer of telecommunication systems. The task of this group is
to develop discrete-time algorithms that would minimize the
bite-error-rate, by consuming the minimum possible transmit
power. This aspect of telecommunications is expected to
assume signiﬁcance in future.
The main contribution of this paper is to develop discrete-
time algorithms for coherently detecting multiple input, mul-
tiple output (MIMO), orthogonal frequency division multi-
plexed (OFDM) signals, transmitted over frequency selective
Rayleigh fading channels. Carrier frequency offset and addi-
tive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) are the other impairments
considered in this work. The minimum SNR per bit required
for error-free transmission over MIMO channels is derived.
The capacity of single-user MIMO systems under different
assumptions about the channel impulse response (also called
the channel state information or CSI) and the statistics of
the channel impulse response (also called channel distribution
information or CDI) is discussed in [12]. The capacity of
MIMO Rayleigh fading channels in the presence of interfer-
ence and receive correlation is discussed in [13]. The low SNR
capacity of MIMO fading channels with imperfect channel
state information is presented in [14]. To the best of our
knowledge, other than the work in [15], which deals with
turbo coded single input single output (SISO) OFDM, and [11]
[16], which deal with turbo coded single input multiple output
(SIMO) OFDM, discrete-time algorithms for the coherent
detection of turbo coded MIMO OFDM systems have not been
discussed earlier in the literature. Simulations results for a
2 × 2 turbo coded MIMO OFDM system indicate that a BER
of 10−5, is obtained at an SNR per bit of just 5.5 dB, which
is a 2.5 dB improvement over the performance given in [11].
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the
system model. The discrete-time algorithms for the coherent
receiver are given in Section III. The simulation results are
presented in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes the
paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We assume a MIMO-OFDM system with Nt transmit and
Nr receive antennas, with QPSK modulation. The data from
each transmit antenna is organized into frames, as shown in
Fig. 1(a), similar to [11] [15] [16]. Note the presence of
the cyclic sufﬁx, whose purpose will be explained later. In
Fig. 1(b), we observe that only the data and postamble QPSK
symbols are interleaved. The buffer QPSK symbols (B) are
sent to the IFFT without interleaving. In Fig. 1, the subscript
k refers to the kth frame, n denotes the time index in a frame
and 1 ≤ nt ≤ Nt is the index to the transmit antenna. The
total length of the frame is
L = Lp + Lcs + Lcp + Ld.
(1)
Let us assume a channel span equal to Lh. The channel span
assumed by the receiver is [15] [16]
Lhr = 2Lh − 1
(2)
Note that Lh depends on the delay spread of the channel, and
is measured in terms of the number of symbols. Recall that,
the delay spread is a measure of the time difference between

the arrival of the ﬁrst and the last multipath signal, as seen by
the receiver. Typically
Lh = d0/(cTs)
(3)
where d0 is the distance between the longest and shortest
multipath, c is the velocity of light and Ts is the symbol
duration. We have assumed a situation where the mobile is
close to the base station and the longest path is reﬂected from
the cell edge, which is approximately equal to the cell diameter
d0, as shown in Fig. 3. For Lh = 10, 1/Ts = 107 bauds and
c = 3×108 meters per sec, we get d0 = 300 meters. Similarly
with Lh = 10 and 1/Ts = 108 bauds we obtain d0 = 30
meters. In other words, as the baud rate increases, the cell
size needs to decrease, and consequently the transmit power
decreases, for the same channel span Lh. The length of the
cyclic preﬁx and sufﬁx is [17]:
Lcp = Lcs = Lhr − 1.

Throughout the manuscript, we use tilde to denote complex
quantities. However, complex QPSK symbols will be denoted
without a tilde e.g., S1, n, nt. Boldface letters denote vectors or
matrices. The channel coefﬁcients ˜hk, n, nr, nt associated with
the receive antenna nr (1 ≤ nr ≤ Nr) and transmit antenna
nt (1 ≤ nt ≤ Nt) for the kth frame are C N (0, 2σ2
f) and

(5)
where “*” denotes complex conjugate and δK(·) is the Kro-
necker delta function. This implies a uniform power delay
proﬁle. Note that a uniform power delay proﬁle is the worst
case channel model, since all the multipath components have
the same power. The channel is assumed to be quasi-static,
that is ˜hk, n, nr, nt is time-invariant over one frame and varies
independently from frame-to-frame. The AWGN noise sam-
ples ˜wk, n, nr for the kth frame at time n and receive antenna
nr are C N (0, 2σ2
w). The frequency offset ωk for the kth
frame is uniformly distributed over [−0.04, 0.04] radian [18].
We assume that ωk is ﬁxed for a frame and varies randomly
from frame-to-frame. The block diagram of the transmitter is
given in Fig. 2.

From (6), it is clear that the preamble is independent of the
frame k. However, each transmit antenna has its own preamble,
for the purpose of synchronization and channel estimation at
the receiver.
The preamble in the frequency domain, for each transmit
antenna is generated as follows. Let πp(i), for 0 ≤ i ≤ Lp−1,
denote the interleaver map for the preamble. Let

Next, we substitute

inclusive, and
i4

i4 + Lp/Nt − 1.
(10)
Note that the preamble in the frequency domain for each
transmit antenna has only Lp/Nt non-zero elements, the rest
of the elements are zero. Moreover, due to πp(·), the Lp/Nt
non-zero elements are randomly interspersed over the Lp
subcarriers in the frequency domain, for each transmit antenna.
By virtue of the preamble construction in (8), (9) and (10),
the preambles in the frequency and time domains correspond-
ing to transmit antennas nt and mt satisfy the relation (using
Parseval’s energy theorem):

where “⊙Lp” denotes the Lp-point circular convolution. In
other words, the preambles corresponding to distinct transmit
antennas are orthogonal over Lp samples. Moreover, the au-
tocorrelation of the preambles in frequency and time domain,
can be approximated by a weighted Kronecker delta function
(this condition is usually satisﬁed by random sequences having
zero-mean; the approximation gets better as Lp increases).
We assume Sk, 3, i, nt ∈ {±1 ± j}. Since we require:

we must have S1, i, nt ∈

the average power of the preamble part must be equal to the
average power of the data part, in the time domain.
Due to the presence of the cyclic sufﬁx in Fig. 1 and (6),

The system block diagram is depicted in Fig. 3. The base
stations are interconnected by a high data-rate backhaul. Note
that d1 < d0. In order to obtain symmetry, the backhaul forms
an equilateral triangle of length d1. The base station is at the
center of each cell, whose diameter is d0. The uplink and
downlink transmissions between the mobiles and base station
could be carried out using time division duplex (TDD) or
frequency division duplex (FDD). Time division (TDMA), fre-
quency division (FDMA), code division (CDMA), orthogonal
frequency division (OFDMA), for downlink transmissions and
ﬁlterbank multicarrier (FBMC), for uplink transmissions [19],
are the possible choices for multiple access (MA) techniques.

In this section, we discuss the discrete-time receiver algo-
rithms.

A. Start of Frame (SoF) and Coarse Frequency Offset Esti-
mate
The start of frame (SoF) detection and coarse frequency
offset estimation is performed for each receive antenna 1 ≤
nr ≤ Nr and transmit antenna 1 ≤ nt ≤ Nt, as given by
the following rule (similar to (22) in [15] and (24) in [16]):
choose that value of m and νk which maximizes


Therefore, the variance of the ML channel estimate (σ2
u) tends
to zero as Lp → ∞ and Ld is kept ﬁxed. Conversely, when
Ld is increased keeping Lp ﬁxed, there is noise enhancement
[11] [16].
C. Fine Frequency Offset Estimation
The ﬁne frequency offset estimate is obtained using the
following rule: choose that value of time instant m and
frequency offset νk, f which maximizes:

where
L2
=
Lhr + Lp − 1
ˆy1, k, m, nr, nt
=
˜s1, m, nt ⋆ ˆhk, m, nr, nt
(32)
where ˆhk, m, nr, nt is obtained from (26). The ﬁne frequency
offset estimate (ˆνk, f(nr, nt)) is obtained by dividing the
interval [ˆωk − 0.005, ˆωk + 0.005] radian (ˆωk is given in (19))
into B2 = 64 frequency bins [21]. The reason for choosing
0.005 radian can be traced to Fig. 5 of [16]. We ﬁnd that
the maximum error in the coarse estimate of the frequency
offset is approximately 0.004 radian over 104 frames. Thus
the probability that the maximum error exceeds 0.005 radian
is less than 10−4. However, from Table V in this paper, we note
that the maximum error in the frequency offset is 2.4 × 10−2
radians for Lp = 512, and 1.1 × 10−2 for Lp = 1024, both of
which are larger than 0.005 radian. By observing this trend,
we expect that for larger values of Lp, say Lp = 4096, the
maximum error in the coarse frequency offset estimate would
be less than 0.005 radians. Increasing Lp would also imply
an increase in Ld, for the same throughput (see (51)). The
average value of the ﬁne frequency offset estimate is given
by:
ˆωk, f =
PNr
nr=1
PNt
nt=1 ˆνk, f(nr, nt)
NrNt
.
(33)
D. Super Fine Frequency Offset Estimation
The ﬁne frequency offset estimate in (33) is still inadequate
for turbo decoding and data detection when Ld ≫ Lp [15].
Note that the residual frequency offset is equal to:
ωk − ˆωk − ˆωk, f.
(34)
This residual frequency offset is estimated by interpolating the
FFT output and performing postamble matched ﬁltering at the
receiver [11] [16]. If the interpolation factor is I, then the FFT
size is ILd (interpolation in the frequency domain is achieved
by zero-padding the FFT input in the time domain, and then
taking the ILd-point FFT). Let
m2, k = m1, k + Lp + Lcs
(35)
where m1, k is deﬁned in (21). Once again, we drop the
subscript k from m2, k and refer to it as m2. Deﬁne the FFT
input in the time domain as:
˜rk, m2, nr =

˜rk, m2, nr
. . .
˜rk, m2+Ld−1, nr
T
(36)
which is the data part of the received signal in (14) for the kth
frame and receive antenna nr, assumed to have the residual
frequency offset given by (34). The output of the ILd-point
FFT of ˜rk, m2, nr in (36) is denoted by
˜Rk, i, nr =
Ld−1
X
n=0
˜rk, m2+n, nre−j 2πin/(ILd)
(37)
for 0 ≤ i ≤ ILd − 1.
The coefﬁcients of the postamble matched ﬁlter is obtained
as follows [11] [16]. Deﬁne

in (26), and

(39)
where π(·) is the data interleaver map, B, Ld2 and Lo are
the lengths of the buffer, data and postamble respectively, as
shown in Fig. 1(b). Let
˜G′
k, i3, nr =

k, i, nr

(40)
where 0 ≤ i3 ≤ Ld −1, the relation between i3 and i is given
in (39). Next, we perform interpolation:
˜Gk, i4, nr =
 ˜G′
k, i, nr
for 0 ≤ i ≤ Ld − 1
0
otherwise
(41)
where 0 ≤ i4 ≤ ILd − 1 and i4 = iI. Finally, the postamble
matched ﬁlter is ˜G∗
k, ILd−1−i, nr, which is convolved with
˜Rk, i, nr in (37). Note that due to the presence of the cyclic
preﬁx, any residual frequency offset in the time domain,
manifests as a circular shift in the frequency domain. The
purpose of the postamble matched ﬁlter is to capture this
shift. The role of the buffer symbols is explained in [11]
[16]. Assume that the peak of the postamble matched ﬁlter
output occurs at m3, k(nr). Ideally, in the absence of noise
and frequency offset
m3, k(nr) = ILd − 1.
(42)
In the presence of the frequency offset, the peak occurs to the
left or right of ILd − 1. The average superﬁne estimate of the
residual frequency offset is given by:
ˆωk, sf = 2π/(ILdNr)
Nr

F. Turbo Decoding
In this section, we assume that the frequency offset has
been perfectly canceled, that is, ˜rk, m2, nr in (36) contains no
frequency offset. The output of the Ld-point FFT of ˜rk, m2, nr
for the kth frame is given by:
˜Rk, i, nr =

˜Hk, i, nr, ntSk, 3, i, nt + ˜Wk, i, nr
(45)
for 0 ≤ i ≤ Ld − 1, where ˜Hk, i, nr, nt is the Ld-point FFT
of ˜hk, n, nr, nt and ˜Wk, i, nr is the Ld-point FFT of ˜wk, n, nr.
It can be shown that [15] [16]

The generating matrix of each of the constituent encoders is

consider the case where Nr = Nt = 2. The details of turbo
decoding can be found in [16], and will not be discussed here.

the variance of the channel estimation error with Lp = 512
is twice that of Lp = 1024 (see (30)). This difference in
the variance of the channel estimation error affects the turbo
decoding process. Moreover, the practical receiver in Fig. 4
with Lp = 1024, Lo = 512 is 2.5 dB better than the practical
receiver with one transmit and two receive antennas in Fig. 10
of [11]. The probability of frame erasure (this happens when

V. CONCLUSIONS
Discrete-time algorithms for the coherent detection of turbo
coded MIMO OFDM system are presented. Simulations results
for a 2 × 2 turbo coded MIMO OFDM system indicate that a
BER of 10−5, is obtained at an SNR per bit of just 5.5 dB,
which is a 2.5 dB improvement over the performance given in
the literature. The minimum average SNR per bit for error-free
transmission over fading channels is derived and shown to be
equal to −1.6 dB, which is the same as that for the AWGN
channel.
Future work could address the issues of peak-to-average
power ratio (PAPR) and extension of the proposed concepts
to massive MIMO systems.
APPENDIX
A. The Minimum Average SNR per bit for Error-free Trans-
mission over Fading Channels
In this appendix, we derive the minimum average SNR per
bit for error-free transmission over MIMO fading channels.
Consider the signal
˜rn = ˜xn + ˜wn
for 0 ≤ n < N
(52)
where ˜xn is the transmitted signal (message) and ˜wn denotes
samples of zero-mean noise, not necessarily Gaussian. All
the terms in (52) are complex-valued or two-dimensional
and are transmitted over one complex dimension. Here the
term dimension refers to a communication link between the
transmitter and the receiver carrying only real-valued signals.
We also assume that ˜xn and ˜wn are ergodic random processes,
that is, the time average statistics is equal to the ensemble
average. The time-averaged signal power over two-dimensions
is given by, for large values of N:
1

N−1

n=0
|˜xn|2 = P ′

where we have assumed independence between ˜xn and ˜wn
and the fact that ˜wn has zero-mean. Note that in (55) it is
necessary that either ˜xn or ˜wn or both, have zero-mean.
Next, we observe that (54) is the expression for a 2N-
dimensional noise hypersphere with radius σ′
w
√
2N. Similarly,
(55) is the expression for a 2N-dimensional received signal
hypersphere with radius
q
N(P ′av + 2σ′2
w).
Now, the problem statement is: how many noise hyper-
spheres (messages) can ﬁt into the received signal hypersphere,
such that the noise hyperspheres do not overlap (reliable
decoding), for a given N, P ′
av and σ′2
w? The solution lies in the
volume of the two hyperspheres. Note that a 2N-dimensional
hypersphere of radius R has a volume proportional to R2N.
Therefore, the number of possible messages is
