Abstract— Social supermarkets are a form of non-profit 
organizations, which use the workforce of volunteers and 
generated income (if there is any) is used for charitable 
activities. Their main purpose is to serve to customers which 
are in material deprivation. By definition, their operational 
activities include: (1) collecting donations in money, (2) 
organization of acceptance of donations in form of food and 
toiletries from traditional supply chains, (3) acquiring food and 
other stuff from other sources and (4) distribution of food, 
toiletries and other stuff for free and/or (5) selling goods at 
extremely discounted prices to socially endangered people. In 
their operational activities, there are numerous possibilities of 
social networks implementation in various stages of their 
everyday business. The aim of this paper is to analyze 
application of social networks in communication with donors, 
volunteers, end users and general public in case of social 
supermarkets. In the paper, we will analyze some real 
examples of application of social networks in active social 
supermarkets.

 INTRODUCTION  
Social supermarkets emerged as the answer to the recent 
economic crisis across Europe. Their main purpose is to 
serve those groups of customers which have low income or 
which are in severe material deprivation. The purpose of 
social supermarket is twofold: (1) the poverty reduction 
trough distribution of food and toiletries to needy people and 
(2) reduction of inefficiency in traditional (dominantly food) 
supply chains trough removal of surpluses of produced food 
(and other goods). Intensive communication with end users, 
volunteers and donors increases operational efficiency of 
social supermarkets.  
The penetration rate of Internet and mobile phones within 
population of EU-28 exceeded 60% of inhabitants. 
Therefore, digital communications already play a significant 
role in promotional activities of social supermarkets. 
However, in literature, the scope and role of digital 
communication usage in social supermarkets is not 
adequately analyzed and described.  
The aim of this paper is to show how social supermarkets 
use social networks as a communication tool for interaction 
with interested publics.  
Paper is divided into three sections. In Section 2, we are 
going to define social supermarkets, in Section 3, we will 
explain what social networks are and what is the level of 
their development and in Section 4, based on a primary 
research we are going to explain good practices of social 
network usage in everyday operation of social supermarkets. 
The primary research is done by case study method on three 
practical examples in Croatia. 
II. 
DEFINITION OF SOCIAL SUPERMARKETS 
Across Europe there are many different types of social 
supermarkets but their level of existence and development is 
very different from country to country. Level of existence 
and development of social supermarkets is influenced by the 
economic situation of the country and countries level of 
development. According to previously mentioned issues, 
there is no common definition of social supermarkets 
because it should be broad enough to integrate all the 
variations which are developed and existing on different 
markets. 
As 
a 
relatively 
new 
phenomenon, 
social 
supermarkets are not sufficiently analyzed in the literature, 
but still we can find a lot of different definitions and 
determinations of a term social supermarkets.  
A social supermarket is defined [1] as “a small, non-
profit oriented retailing operation offering a limited 
assortment of products at symbolic prices primary in self-
service manner. Authorized for shopping are needy people 
only. The products are donated by food production and retail 
companies free of charge as they are edible but not 
marketable due to small blemishes. Achieved profit is 
reinvested into social projects”. Another definition [2] states 
that “social supermarkets are organizations, which provide

food that is no longer useful for the common trade cheaply to 
people who are in situations of poverty”. 
According to [3], social supermarkets is a new retail 
format that fosters positive social change by fulfilling 
material needs of the socially disadvantaged groups and 
giving them an opportunity to preserve their dignity in an 
environment where they can choose various kinds of goods 
at extremely low prices. 
All definitions of social supermarkets put the emphasis 
on selling or distributing goods to people in severe material 
deprivation. In addition, according to analyzed definitions, 
social supermarkets can be viewed as a new type of 
intermediaries within the food distribution chain because 
they have been developed in order to transfer surpluses of 
food or products to people in need.  
When analyzing social supermarkets, some benefits 
should be pointed out [4] emphasize three types of benefits 
of social supermarkets: (1) social benefits such as: reduction 
of food insecurity and life quality improvement of socially 
endangered citizens, improvement of their social inclusion, 
growth of self-confidence in communication with others and 
fostering feeling of belonging to a certain community by 
treating their users as  clients rather than charity users, what 
strengthens their sense of dignity, (2) environmental benefits 
which are related with food waste reduction throughout 
distribution of food surplus from companies and individuals 
to final users, and (3) economic benefits which are related 
with better reallocation of scarce budget because users can 
make by purchasing products at lower prices in social 
supermarkets and then to use those assets to acquire other 
necessities. 
As initially is emphasized, there are different models of 
social supermarkets. Main distinctive characteristics are: (a) 
workforce organization because some social supermarkets 
have paid employees, while others function only trough 
usage volunteers as a workforce. (b) type and layout of shops 
(c) assortment offered, (d) sourcing and fundraising 
activities, (f) availability and implementation of various 
technologies starting from distribution organization to 
communication with users. 
Social supermarkets mostly rely on volunteers as the key 
part of the workforce of volunteers, but some of them have 
paid employees as well. Even though, social supermarkets 
are trying to develop stores to be as similar as possible to 
regular supermarkets, due to the lack of resources, some of 
them are very simple and unpresentable in layout and interior 
design. Mostly their assortment contains food, as well as 
other basic products like hygiene products, cleaning 
detergents or clothes. But, it is necessary to point out that 
assortment in social supermarkets heavily depends on 
success of donations and fundraising activities. Mostly the 
products are donated, but in some cases surpluses are bought 
directly from producers at discount prices. Usually, they rely 
on public subsidies or support from other charities in their 
operations, but there are some examples of private initiatives 
in Switzerland and United Kingdom, which aim to develop 
total commercial sustainability (see [4]). 
Some authors claim that role of social supermarkets can 
be beyond the redistribution because they can offer some 
complementary activities to their users in order to improve 
public recognition and to foster involvement of end users in 
their everyday operation. For instance it is known that some 
social supermarket in France organize skills workshops for 
their users, while some social supermarkets in Austria 
provide lunch offer within the coffee area of their store.  
However, Klindzic et al. [5] point to some characteristics 
which are specific for social supermarkets as an emerging 
retail format: (a) number of stock keeping units (SKUs) in 
their assortment depends on donations, while food accounts 
for approximately 90% of their assortment; (b) goods are 
usually distributed to the most vulnerable social groups for 
free; in some cases, if goods are not given for free, then 
every day low price policy (EDLP) is applied with prices 
lower by more than 30% compared to other stores; (c) 
service is provided by volunteers and/or previously 
unemployed persons, (d) opening hours are limited, (e) 
promotional activities are scarce and are done via welfare 
centers, citizen associations and religious organizations, (f) 
more intensive promotional activities are done for the benefit 
of donors through various activities of citizen associations, 
religious organizations and supporting media. 
 
III. 
 SOCIAL NETWORKS AS A TOOL FOR EFFECTIVE 
COMMUNICATION  
Business processes changed in the XXI century, and one 
of causes is the Internet, which has become a necessary 
business communication tool. Development of social 
networks goes in line with development of Information and 
Communication technologies (ICT) and Internet. Social 
networks extremely useful as consumers are deeply involved 
in creating information and using it in various situations, 
such as buying decisions making, leisure and entertainment, 
advertising, etc. [6]. Hubspot reports that 70% of business-
to-consumer marketers have acquired customers through 
Facebook [7].  Research of social networks are focused and 
run in different areas such as B2C communication [8]–[12], 
B2B communication [13][14], role of social networks in e-
marketing, e-commerce [7][15][16]. Cultural differences in 
social networking site use were presented in the study of 
Jackson and Wang [17], the peculiarities in China and the 
US were presented. The study of the impact of social media 
on consumers was presented by Hajli [18] where he 
examined the role of social media in the adoption of e-
commerce and social commerce. Al sources confirms the 
importance of social networks, so nowadays attention to 
trends and market peculiarities should be emphasized.  
Social networks could be classified according to the main 
purpose and target audience: personal (e.g. AsianAve, 
Badoo, Facebook, Google+, Hi5, Highlight, Instagram, 
Myspace, Odnoklassniki) and professional (e.g. Brainly, 
LinkedIn, ResearchGate, Sciencescape) [6].  
It should be emphasized that specialized categories, such 
as vertical social networks and linked to portals networks 
were declined in this research, as all types of business 
organizations were decided to be included in the research, 
and such networks are more likely to be related to one or

The dominance of Facebook was observed all over the 
globe, and of course new social media sites were becoming 
popular and competing for consumers such as QZone, 
SnapChart,QQ, etc. [19]. Of course, Facebook should be 
treated as the leader since it is still the most powerful social 
media channel. More than 1.5 million local businesses have 
active pages on Facebook. An average user of Facebook 
spends there more than 55 minutes per day. 22% of teenagers 
connect to Facebook at least 10 times per day; 48% of users 
in the age group of 18–34 years connect in the morning (just 
waked up), and 28% connect before going to sleep [20].  
The point is that it is not enough to know the types and 
possibilities of various social networks, the understanding of 
peculiarities and consumer perception of each is necessary as 
well. This is a challenge because of dynamics of the sector, 
and organizations should still consider the field of activities, 
potential consumers’ habits and follow novelties in social 
networks. 
Therefore, in advance we will focus to application of 
social networks, especially Facebook, in operation of a 
specific type of organization, i.e., in social supermarkets. 
 
IV. 
EXPERIENCE OF ACTIVE SOCIAL NETWORK USE IN 
SOCIAL SUPERMARKETS IN CROATIA  
Upon conducted in-field research and deep interviews 
with social entrepreneurs in social supermarkets in Croatia, 
which were done from June 2017 till nowadays, there are 
more than 15 social supermarkets located in various cities 
dominantly they are run by non-profit organizations. In this 
paper, we will analyze case of social supermarkets in Rijeka, 
Osijek and Varaždin as examples of good practice for active 
and effective usage of social networks in communication 
with various types of users. Firstly, we will give a profile of 
each social supermarket. Profiles are done according to in-
field visits and interviews with social entrepreneurs who are 
responsible for social supermarket’s operation and upon 
information available in public sources where available. 
Secondly, we will analyze how they implement social 
networks as a mean of communication with their 
stakeholders. 
A. The profile of the social supermarket in Rijeka 
Social supermarket „”Kruh sv. Elizabete” (in English: St 
Elisabeth’s bread) in Rijeka is the first social supermarket 
opened in Croatia. It was established in 2001. Even though it 
is conceived by the Franciscan Order and their volunteer, it 
is a separate non-profit organization which consists of three 
coordinated departments dealing with [21]: (1) end users and 
donors, (2) clothing/footwear and finance and (3) food, 
volunteers and media.  
The Rijeka social supermarket has more than 50 regular 
volunteers and around 400 occasional volunteers who 
distribute approximately 800 packages each month to the 
500 most socially endangered families in the local 
community, i.e., it has around 2000 users.  
The most important donors are individual citizens and 
fundraising actions are organized at three levels [21]: (1) the 
annual “Young against hunger“ initiative (2) Saturday 
fundraisers at traditional retail chains stores, and (3) 
participation in local city events. “Young against hunger“ is 
the key fundraiser and it is organized in cooperation with 
regional elementary schools where children are asked to 
voluntarily give one product in order to learn how to 
practically show solidary with citizens in need. In addition, 
“orange” volunteers of the social supermarket Rijeka are 
present in one of the shopping malls each and every Saturday

during the whole day. Occasionally, the Futsal tournament is 
organized. It takes place in the Hall of youth on Trsat under 
the moto: "entertainment for us, rescue to others” because 
each registered futsal team, instead of paying the registration 
fee in cash, is “paying” in food donations to the social 
supermarket. Also, the anniversary celebration of Social 
Supermarket Rijeka is an important and open door event for 
all stakeholders in the local community. At the event a joint 
lunch is served bringing journalists and citizens together with 
volunteers and homeless people of Rijeka.  
Due to numerous events and fundraising activities, the 
social supermarket Rijeka is very exposed to traditional and 
electronic media. For instance, newspaper Novi list, 
magazine JaTrgovac and numerous portals are covering their 
activities in positive manner on regular basis.. Therefore, this 
social supermarket is very well known both on local and on 
national level. 
B. The profile of the social supermarket in Osijek 
Social supermarket in Osijek is operated by Civil 
Association “River of Love” (in Croatian: Udruga Rijeka 
ljubavi). It has regular working hours during the week. 
Additionally, each month to each household a “package of 
life” containing 14 food products sufficient for 10 days is 
prepared and distributed to households in need [22]. 
Dependable on quantity of donation special distribution 
events are organized, for instance donations for kids during 
the Christmas or Easter period. The social supermarket 
serves to approximately 1000 households, i.e., around 4000 
end users (persons). Approximately 15 volunteers are fully 
engaged in everyday activities.  
Data on end users are kept in database and are updated 
regularly upon data on financial census collected from the 
City Government welfare office and local employment 
service. Operation space is donated by the Osijek City 
Government and there is an occasional cooperation with 
Croatian Army for hosting large donation events.  
The donation structure includes: 80% of individual 
donations, 10% donations by local companies and 10% 
donations collected throughout cooperation with schools and 
universities. Social supermarket forces active interaction 
with local public, actively promotes its operation through 
national traditional and electronic media, but also intensively 
uses all sorts of digital communication including social 
networks.  
C. The profile of the social supermarket in Varaždin 
According to the interview done with the managerial 
team, social supermarket “Kruh Sv. Antuna” (in English: St 
Anthony’s bread) in Varaždin is founded by Franciscan 
Order and their volunteers. It functions as a project within 
the Roman Chatolic Church and it is not registered as a 
separate non-profit organization. It serves to approximately 
1100 households, i.e., 3000 users. The social supermarket in 
Varaždin operates in space donated by the local government. 
Dominantly foodstuff and toiletries are distributed to 
households on a monthly basis and occasionally wheen some 
large donation of perishable goods is received (such as milk 
products or diaries). Users have to come to pick up goods 
and no delivery is organized. Data on users are kept in 
database according to legal rules for non-profit organization 
in field of social services and each user has to renew the 
status each six months.  
There is defined dynamics of donation collection that is 
organized each Saturday in local Churches. Operation is 
supported by local companies in donations and in discount 
rates or transport organization when foodstuff and toiletries 
are purchased from traditional supply chains (producers, 
wholesales companies and retailers).  
However, individual donations are dominant (almost 
80%). On monthly basis, around 50 volunteers are actively 
involved in social supermarket’s operation. This social 
supermarket 
actively 
uses 
all 
means 
of 
public 
communication such as leaflets, traditional and electronic 
media reporting (newspapers, journals, TV, radio etc.), 
organization of events in local churches, schools and 
Universities. In addition, they organize open-door day in 
order to promote their activities within the local community. 
 
D. Usage of Social Networks in Chosen Social 
Supermarkets 
Social supermarkets in Rijeka, Osijek and Varaždin 
intensively use social networks, especially Facebook, as the 
vital communication channel in their everyday operation. 
Therefore, we analyzed their Facebook pages in order to 
explain the means of use of this social network and its 
suitability in operation of social supermarkets. Results of 
analysis are shown in Table 2. 
All analyzed Facebook pages are in Croatian language 
only, but this is expected as social supermarkets, per se, are 
oriented towards narrow, local geographic area such as city 
or county. Social supermarket Osijek is the most active 
according to number of followers, number of published 
pictures and video materials, but also according to 
interactivity level with the community (because there are 
between 5 and 10 comments given by followers per one 
published status). Besides Facebook page, only Rijeka has 
active YouTube channel at which activities are promoted. 
However, video materials published directly at Facebook 
page are more frequently viewed in Osijek’s case.  
In social supermarkets, there are three groups which can 
be communicated via social networks, those are: (1) end 
users, (2) volunteers and donors, (3) general public. In Table 
3, ways of communication with all groups is shown. Even 
though, end users are people in severe material deprivation, 
social supermarket Osijek uses Facebook to reach them and 
to share information on package distribution and distribution 
of unplanned large donations of perishable goods. Also, 
social network is used to communicate events being 
organized for end users as well. In addition, during the in-
field interview we asked manager of social supermarket 
Osijek does it make sense to use social networks in 
communication with end users in case of social supermarkets 
and she responded: “If the end user does not possess a cell 
phone or a computer to see the announcement on his or her 
own, some of their neighbors will pass them information. 
After all, Osijek is, known for its solidarity and information

sharing culture. And this way of information sharing 
functions 
perfectly”. 
Regarding 
communication 
with 
volunteers and donors the most active is social supermarket 
Rijeka, but this is due to their wide base of volunteers (50 
regular and 400 occasional volunteers). However, Osijek is 
striving to give online individual appraisal for each donation 
and for each donation they publish the report and 
acknowledgement with the clear “thank you” notice for the 
donor. The reports are always illustrated by numerous 
photos.

Also, Facebook is recognized as a tool for communication 
with the general public. All analyzed social supermarkets 
publish announcements on events and/or reports on 
organized events. But, usually, events notifications are done 
via Facebook status publication and, therefore, the 
functionality is not at the same level as it would be if the 
event is announced by entering Facebook event. If the event 
information is published as a status, followers cannot easily 
invite participants, nor export event to their personal 
calendars. Therefore, there is a place to improve this segment 
in the future. Regarding information sharing, we found that 
links to other Facebook pages are shared only in case of 
Rijeka social supermarkets, links to other portals (such as 
newspapers and magazines) are done at all social 
supermarkets, especially to articles regarding operation of 
the certain social supermarket.

CONCLUSIONS

efficiently distribute surpluses of products from traditional 
supply chains to people in severe material deprivation. As 
good examples, we analyzed the usage of social networks in 
three social supermarkets in Croatia, particularly Rijeka, 
Osijek and Varaždin. All three analyzed social supermarkets 
use Facebook as the social network suitable for public 
relations. Upon given examples we isolated 3 groups of 
social supermarkets’ stakeholders addressed through social 
networks, those are: (1) end users, who search information 
on time, place and means of distribution of necessary goods 
within the supermarket (2) volunteers and donors to whom 
we can place various calls and requests, but also to whom we 
can make public appraisal via social networks, and (3) 
general public to whom we can share information on events, 
fundraising activities, give report on previously organized 
events, share links to other media and other social networks 
etc. All social supermarkets analyzed in the case foster active 
communication and share multimedia via social networks. 
They promote their activities and events on regularly basis, 
but relation to donors, volunteers and end users could be 
more improved in a near future. However, in order to explain 
the real efficiency of social network in everyday operation 
further research have to be done, this research could consist 
of survey within social network users population and further 
interviews with social supermarkets’ managers. In addition, 
there are some raising questions to be addressed in the future 
papers and discussed both on national and international level. 
One of them is protection of privacy of individuals, 
especially end users, who, as socially endangered group of 
people, attend donation events and without their expressed 
will their pictures appears at social network pages of the 
social supermarket. The question of privacy protection is 
even more problematic if we know that some events are 
organized for children. Therefore, in the near future, in-field 
interviews and focus group research could be applied to 
address those questions.
