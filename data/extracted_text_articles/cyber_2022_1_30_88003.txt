Abstract— In response to the growing maritime cyber threat 
landscape, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) 
developed guidelines on maritime cyber risk management, part 
of resolution MSC.428 (98). One of the guidelines’ functional 
requirements calls for the development and implementation of 
activities necessary for the timely detection of a cyber event. 
This has seen the development of Maritime Security Operation 
Centers (M-SOCs), which give maritime operators and service 
providers better cyber visibility of vessel systems. In line with 
the conference theme on situational awareness, the position 
paper will explore this from the perspective of cyber threat 
information sharing and its necessity when it comes to 
enhancing awareness in multi-stakeholder domains. We 
propose a model that could form as a basis for future maritime 
cyber threat sharing from an M-SOC analyst’s point of view. 
Gaps that could undermine the effectiveness of this structure 
are subsequently underscored and form the basis of future 
research to be conducted in this area.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The maritime sector is a complex ecosystem, bringing 
together stakeholders and organizations of varied sizes, 
maturity, complexity, and operational scope. With its 
increasing rate of digitization, and increased levels of 
connectivity in the near future, the threat environment is 
steadily becoming more hostile. Cyber-attacks are becoming 
more frequent with all actors in the digital value chain being 
targeted by criminal networks and hostile networks [1][2]. 
Against this backdrop, the IMO, in 2017 adopted resolution 
MSC.428(98)-maritime cyber risk management in safety 
management systems and MSC-Fal.1-guidelines on maritime 
cyber risk management. Recognizing the multi-stakeholder 
nature of the domain, the resolution called for administrators, 
classification societies, ship owners, operators, agents, 
equipment manufacturers, service providers, ports, port 
facilities and other stakeholders to work towards protecting 
shipping from current and emerging cyber threats [3] [4]. 
These regulations highlight that cyber security in the 
maritime domain is indeed a shared responsibility.  
A benefit of stakeholder identification is that it helps in 
the clear defining of cyber threat information sharing 
structures and their participating entities [5]. One way of 
gaining increased cyber situational awareness necessary for 
the timely resolution of cyber threats is to exchange 
information with others [6]. It is within this context that we 
propose cyber threat information sharing as a discussion that 
needs to be had within the maritime domain.  
As a build-up towards this, the position paper will take 
on the following structure: Section II gives a background on 
information sharing; Section III looks at legislation and 
guidelines that have steered information sharing in other 
multi-stakeholder domains; Section IV discusses information 
sharing initiatives within the maritime domain; Section V 
looks into M-SOCs; Section VI discusses the proposed 
model and the motivation behind its development; Section 
VII highlights key takeaways from the proposed work with 
identified implementation challenges framed as directions for 
future work; Section VIII concludes the paper. 
II. 
INFORMATION SHARING 
Information sharing has previously been defined as the 
act of voluntarily making information possessed by one 
entity available to another [7]. Within the context of this 
paper, the type of information we are most interested in is 
cyber threat information defined as any information that can 
help an organization recognize, assess, monitor, and respond 
to cyber threats. Examples of this include indicators of 
compromise, which are technical artifacts or observables that 
suggest an attack is imminent or is currently underway; 
tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors; 
security alerts; threat intelligence reports; situational 
awareness data; best practices; and strategic analysis. Vessel 
mobility makes situational context information particularly 
important. Information sharing as used within this paper is 
the exchange of cyber threat information with trusted 
entities/stakeholders [8]–[10].  
The choice of an information sharing model or structure 
can influence the effectiveness of information sharing 
between 
various 
stakeholders. 
Subsequently, 
various 
information sharing models have been proposed [5] [11].

One notable and highly adopted structure was established by 
the MITRE Corporation during the development of The 
Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information 
(TAXII) [12]. TAXII defines a set of services, messages and 
protocols that aid in timely and efficient exchange of cyber 
threat information. As part of the work, three main 
information sharing models were defined namely hub and 
spoke, peer-to-peer and source-subscriber. Figure 1 below is 
reproduced from the work done by [12] and highlights these 
models. 
In a hub and spoke model, a spoke shares information 
with the hub, which then re-shares this information with all 
other spokes. A peer-to-peer model is structured in such a 
way that any number of organizations can function as both 
producers 
and 
consumers 
of 
information. 
A 
source/subscriber model is one where an organization acts as 
a sole source of information for all subscribers. Respondents 
in a 2021 survey by [13] revealed that 58% of their threat 
intelligence came from peers.  
III. 
MULTI-SECTOR INFORMATION SHARING 
INITIATIVES 
The pivotal role played by information sharing when it 
comes to enhancing cyber resilience cannot be understated as 
is evidenced by multiple cross-sector initiatives related to 
this [14]–[16]. From a regulatory perspective, the United 
States of America (USA) passed the Cybersecurity 
Information Sharing Act (2015). This calls for concerned 
parties to develop procedures for sharing cyber threat 
information between different stakeholders. The European 
Union (EU) Network and Information Security (NIS) 
Directive calls for information exchange and cooperation 
among operators of essential services within sectors 
identified as critical. These include energy, transport, 
banking financial market infrastructures, health, drinking 
water supply and digital infrastructure. 
Aviation regulation, such as European Civil Aviation 
Conference (ECAC) Doc 30-Part II [16] maps out 
information sharing relationships from the perspectives of 
 
 
Figure 1: TAXII Information Sharing Model 
various stakeholders, such as the nation-state, aircraft 
operators and software/system developers.  
The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams 
(FIRST) recently released an updated version of the Traffic 
Light Protocol (TLP) that facilitates information sharing 
based on color categories. Information in the TLP: RED 
category can only be shared with individual recipients with 
no additional disclosure permitted. TLP: AMBER category 
authorizes limited information disclosure on a need-to-know 
basis 
within 
organizations 
and 
their 
clients. 
TLP: 
AMBER+STRICT 
restricts 
sharing 
to 
within 
the 
organization only. TLP: GREEN category enables limited 
disclosure within the recipient’s community while TLP: 
WHITE has no limitation on sharing [17]. 
Of the sector-specific information sharing initiatives, one 
that has had considerable effort put in involves the 
development of Information Sharing and Analysis Centers 
(ISACs) and Information Exchanges [18][19]. Within their 
specific domains, these are intended to be trusted entities that 
promote information sharing and good practices related to 
cyber and physical threats and their mitigation. The United 
Kingdom (UK) Center for the Protection of National 
Infrastructure (CPNI) mapped out information exchanges for 
various sectors including transport, finance, water security, 
pharmaceuticals, and aerospace among others [20]. In 
compliance with the US Presidential Decision Directive-63 
[21], the National Council of ISACS was established with 
various sector-specific ISACS, such as Automotive, 
communications, elections infrastructure, electricity, and 
financial services [22]. Likewise, the EU sees ISACs as a 
way of building a European cybershield [19]. 
IV. 
MARITIME INFORMATION SHARING 
INITIATIVES 
Information sharing initiatives within the maritime 
domain have taken root in the form of legislation, regulatory 
guidelines, public and private sector collaborations, and 
funded 
research 
projects. 
These 
are 
subsequently 
highlighted: 
A. Legislation 
Within the EU, the maritime domain, an identified critical 
infrastructure sector, is required to adhere to the EU NIS 
directive [15], which calls for information exchange and 
cooperation 
among 
operators 
of 
essential 
services. 
Specifically related to the maritime domain, this directive 
requires incident reporting requirements to be met by 
identified stakeholders, such as companies, ships, port 
facilities, ports, and vessel traffic services. Additionally, the 
directive calls for a coherent approach in the satisfaction of 
reporting requirements by considering international codes 
and guidelines prepared by entities, such as the IMO. 
B. ISACS 
In compliance with the US Presidential Decision 
Directive-63 [21], which required the creation of sector-
specific ISACS, the maritime domain has two established 
ISACs namely Maritime ISAC [23], and Maritime

Transportation System (MTS) ISAC [24]. The ever 
increasing cybersecurity concerns along the lower Columbia 
river prompted the Port of Vancouver (USA) and MTS-
ISAC to launch the Lower Columbia River Maritime 
Information Exchange (LCR-MIX) to facilitate ease of 
communication, 
collaboration 
and 
cyber 
situational 
awareness among stakeholders [25]. Information sharing 
partnerships have been actualized by private sector entities, 
such as the Norwegian Maritime Cyber Resilience Center 
(NORMA Cyber) and MTS-ISAC who recently signed an 
agreement that will see both entities exchange maritime 
cyber threat intelligence information [26]. 
C. EU ECHO Project (2019) 
As part of the EU funded ECHO project [27], the study 
by [28] adapted the user communities established by the 
Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) [29]. It 
highlighted them as shareholders of sensitive cyber 
information sharing within the maritime domain. These user 
communities and their systems are Maritime safety and 
security; Fisheries control; Marine pollution preparedness 
and response in Marine environment; Customs; Border 
control; General law enforcement; and Defense. 
D. Danish Maritime Cybersecurity Unit (2019) 
The Danish Maritime Cybersecurity Unit developed the 
cyber and information security strategy [30] in which the 
Danish Maritime Authority (DMA) will serve as an 
exchange point between the Center for Cyber Security 
(CFCS) and various maritime sector stakeholders. The 
primary responsibilities of the DMA in this information 
sharing arrangement will be to communicate, procure, create, 
and validate IT security-related information between the 
parties, 
coordination 
tasks, 
organizing 
professional 
workshops and conferences related to specific IT security 
issues in the maritime sector. 
The strategy [30] also recommends establishing the 
Maritime Cyber and Information Security Forum, which is 
coordinated by the DMA, and includes IT security 
representatives from Danish authorities who are directly 
involved in maritime activities. The forum is structured to 
serve as a platform for discussing how various security 
incidents have been managed by the parties involved and 
their experiences in managing the various situations. Long 
term goals of the forum will include identifying and 
addressing the possibilities of developing a digital hub where 
information security knowledge is made easily accessible 
and searchable by, maritime sector authorities and 
stakeholders. 
E. International Association of Classification Societies-
IACS (2022) 
Recommendation 166 [31], UR E26 [32] and E27 [33] 
(cyber resilience of systems, for product suppliers) clearly 
define key vessel cybersecurity stakeholders and their 
responsibilities. The key stakeholders represented are the 
shipowner/company, 
ship 
designer/shipyard, 
system 
integrator, supplier, and classification society. One of the 
strengths of these regulations is that E26 and E27 become 
mandatory for new vessels commissioned after 1st January 
2024 while remaining non-mandatory guidance tools for 
existing vessels. Additionally, the 2020 world merchant fleet 
statistics by Equasis [34] showed that 78% of vessels of a 
gross tonnage of more than 500 tonnes are classified under 
the IACS umbrella. An interpretation of the regulations 
yields 
TABLE 
1, 
which 
highlights 
stakeholder 
communication instances identified in the IACS regulations.  
In certain instances, there was no identified communication 
between certain stakeholders. For example, there is no direct 
communication between the ship and classification society. 
The ship owner has traditionally been responsible for 
ensuring the vessel complies with regulations and so it is 
assumed that the authors of this regulation factored that in 
and created communication between the classification 
society and ship owner instead. 
While these regulations are designed for regulatory 
compliance, the communication pathways that they mandate 
between the various stakeholders can be exploited to 
establish dependable vessel threat information sharing 
structures.  
V. 
M-SOCS 
Entities in the maritime cyber resilience ecosystem that 
would benefit from increased information sharing are 
Security Operation Centers (SOCs). A SOC is a team 
primarily composed of security analysts organized to detect, 
analyze, respond to, and report on cybersecurity incidents. 
An internal SOC functions as part of the organization it is 
defending while an external one is contracted as a service 
provider [35]. An M-SOC is SOC that operates within the 
maritime domain. There has been a steady increase in the 
number of maritime operators who have either setup or 
contracted third party M-SOCs to enable them to have better 
visibility and cyber awareness of their vessels.

Examples of these include Norma Cyber [36], Marlink 
[37], Port-IT [38], Cyber-Owl [39], Port of LA [40], and Port 
of Singapore [41] among others. 
These real-time monitoring units play a vital role in not 
only producing cyber threat information but also consuming 
the same when it comes from entities, such as equipment 
vendors and suppliers. It is, therefore, pivotal for M-SOC 
analysts to have complete domain awareness of the vessel 
cybersecurity 
ecosystem 
and 
information 
sharing 
complexities that exist between all the stakeholders within 
this ecosystem so that they can tailor their communication 
appropriately. 
VI. 
PROPOSED VESSEL THREAT INFORMATION 
SHARING MODEL 
Work on the proposed model was inspired by a similar  
outcome in the aviation domain and highlighted in the ECAC 
Doc 30-Part II regulation, which is currently active and 
enforceable [16]. In the case of this regulation, the authors 
developed three information sharing models from the 
perspectives of three critical stakeholders namely, nation 
state, operator, and software/system developer. Figure 2 
shows the outcome of the process from the software/system 
developer perspective. The recommended actions of the 
software/system developer with regards to information 
sharing were then highlighted, which included identifying 
external stakeholders, information they would want to 
receive, communication channels to be used, vulnerability 
response/disclosure process, and finally assessing all the 
above with the identified stakeholders and regulators. 
Additionally, Figure 3 shows the outcomes of a similar 
process but from the perspective of the operator. 
 
 
Figure 2: Aviation Information Sharing-Software/System Developer 
Perspective 
 
 
Figure 3:Aviation Information Sharing-Operator Perspective 
Development of the proposed vessel threat information 
sharing model, shown in Figure 4, began by identifying the 
key stakeholders highlighted in the three IACS documents 
that focus on vessel cyber resilience, Recommendation 166 
[31], UR E26 [32] and E27 [33] (cyber resilience of systems, 
for product suppliers). These were identified to be the 
classification 
society, 
shipowner, 
supplier, 
ship 
designer/shipyards and system integrator. The ship is the 
primary asset of focus and so has also been included. The 
next 
step 
involved 
establishing 
any 
instances 
of 
communication that are highlighted in each of the 
documents. As shown in TABLE 1, there are instances of 
communication between all stakeholders. Examples of 
statements in the regulations that guided this process include: 
• 
E26: The Supplier shall design and document 
testing 
procedures 
suitable 
to 
verify 
the 
performance of measures adopted to fulfil relevant 
requirements (Test Plan) 
• 
E26: The Shipyard or System Integrator shall 
incorporate the documentation provided by the 
Supplier into an overall Test Plan for the CBSs 
• 
E26: The final Test Plans updated according to the 
actual CBSs configuration and implementation 
onboard 
shall 
be 
made 
available 
to 
the 
Classification Society. 
• 
E26: The Shipowner shall retain onboard a copy of 
results of execution of tests and an updated Test 
Plan and make them available to the Classification 
Society. 
The examples above, while only representing a small 
portion of the regulations, already highlight how the 
development and maintenance of a test plan involves all 
stakeholders. The directional arrows in the model are a direct 
interpretation 
of 
the 
stakeholder 
communication 
responsibilities. Because the model has not been evaluated, 
we opted to leave them as is to act as a guide. Testing of the 
model will determine the actual cyber threat information 
sharing responsibilities between stakeholders, which may 
lead to a variation in the direction of communication. 
The increased adoption of M-SOCs as highlighted in 
Section V means that that they will be a key source of real-
time vessel threat information. Interviews we have 
conducted with a few M-SOC vendors, part of on-going 
work to be published in future, reveals that most are 
currently operating as a service provided to ship operators to 
help them increase asset visibility from a cyber security 
perspective. The service level agreement between them 
would therefore mean that any cyber threat information that 
the M-SOC gathers from the vessel would be shared with 
both the operators and the vessel. We therefore position them 
in the model between the operator and the vessel. The M-
SOC is highlighted in a different shade because they are not 
one of the key stakeholders identified in the IACS guidelines 
used above. However, from a threat information perspective, 
they are a primary stakeholder. Additionally, the green 
dotted outline encompassing the M-SOC, ship owner and 
ship shows the current limited scope of information sharing 
due to the limiting nature of service agreements.

Figure 4: Proposed Vessel Threat Information Sharing Model 
 
It is important to highlight the assumptions made when 
developing this model. The first assumption is that all the 
vessel resilience stakeholders identified in the guidelines are 
also key when it comes to sharing of threat information. It is 
possible that some stakeholders may have been left out of the 
model or some have been included who are not critical in the 
process. As an example, we added M-SOCs in the model 
because they are a key producer of real-time vessel cyber 
threat information. Closely related to this is also the fact that 
stakeholder cyber resilience responsibilities vary during the 
lifecycle of a vessel from design, commissioning, 
construction, and operation [32]. However, as the model is 
yet to be tested, the assumption made is that there is uniform 
responsibility, something that we anticipate will change once 
validation of the model begins.   
The second assumption made is that pre-existing 
mandated communication between stakeholders, albeit 
currently for regulatory compliance, would make it easier to 
establish threat information communication pathways. It is 
assumed that it is easier to build upon a pre-existing 
relationship rather than proposing an entirely new one where 
none existed before. It is for this reason that the connections 
between stakeholders are made this way. However, we 
acknowledge that this could change once testing the viability 
of the model begins. 
While the guidelines identify the stakeholders as distinct 
separate entities, it is assumed that the same happens in 
actual operation where it may not always be the case. There 
are examples of shipyards also providing system integration 
services to their clients, which would therefore lead to a 
merging of those two entities in the model presented [42]. 
However, we have opted to maintain all stakeholders as 
distinct separate entities as highlighted in the guidelines.  
VII. KEY TAKEAWAYS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
DIRECTIONS 
The key contribution of this position paper is the 
proposal of a maritime vessel cyber threat information 
sharing model. This model differs from previous maritime 
information sharing initiatives highlighted in Section IV in 
that this is more specific to vessel cyber resilience and 
focuses on the stakeholders considered critical to the secure 
posture of the same. Its development was motivated by 
similar work done in the aviation domain as highlighted in 
Figure 2 and Figure 3 contained in the presently active 
ECAC Doc 30-Part II regulation [16].  
Having the information sharing model allows us to be 
more targeted in what we want to uncover with regards to the 
state of maritime information sharing because we now have 
well defined stakeholders to start with and hypothesized 
relationships which testing will help us refine. Additionally, 
we also aim to explore the following implementation 
challenges that we feel would impede the successful 
adoption of such a model: 
A. Identifying Information Sharing Stakeholder gaps 
While the stakeholders involved in vessel cyber 
resilience have been identified, research on their roles with 
respect to threat information sharing is still a significantly 
under researched area with the potential of revealing glaring 
gaps that could undermine the information sharing process. 
For example, a 2021 study [43] conducted by the US 
transport department identified gaps in vulnerability and 
exploit information sharing between various transportation 
stakeholder groups, such as: 
• 
Indirect 
communication 
between 
equipment 
manufacturers and Infrastructure Owner Operators 
(IOOs), which occurs mostly through contractors, 
distributors, and intermediate agents 
90

CYBER 2022 : The Seventh International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems

• 
Equipment manufacturers lacking procedures to 
manage 
unsolicited 
reports 
from 
security 
researchers; manufacturers reporting of the long 
time taken to disseminate patches to all devices 
• 
IOOs believing vulnerabilities are a problem that 
equipment manufacturers should take ownership of 
and address in case any problem arises.  
 
In order to overcome this challenge and optimize cyber 
information sharing within the maritime sector, future 
research will focus on understanding communication gaps, 
and variations in information sharing perceptions between 
the stakeholders presented in the model. This will also help 
determine the validity of one of the assumptions made during 
development of the model whereby it is easier to build threat 
information pathways on top of pre-existing stakeholder 
communication. 
B. Stakeholder Specific Actionable Cyber Threat 
Information Needs 
Actionable cyber threat information has previously been 
defined by multiple researchers as constituting multiple 
dimensions. Research by [44] established that actionable 
information is determined by correctness, relevance, 
timeliness, usefulness, and uniqueness. [45] defined 
actionable 
threat 
intelligence 
based 
on 
timeliness, 
prioritization, 
implementation, 
resolution, 
relevance, 
integration, automation, trustworthiness, and context. The 
European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) [46] 
highlighted that actionable information has to be Relevant, 
Ingestible, Accurate, Complete, and Timely within the 
context 
of 
the 
particular 
recipient 
organization 
or 
stakeholder. 
An 
acknowledged 
consequence 
of 
the 
highlighted dimensions is that different stakeholders will 
have varying perspectives on what constitutes actionable 
threat information. Indeed, this is reflected in surveys 
conducted by [13] who established that less than 50% of 
respondents considered the intelligence they received as 
being accurate and actionable with timeliness being the worst 
rated by only 29% of respondents. In the same study, only 
33% of respondents acknowledged having effective 
processes for handling actionable threat intelligence from 
external sources. Actionability of threat intelligence was also 
ranked, at 61%, as the most essential element during 
calculation of risk scores. 
Overcoming this challenge will require further research 
into how the various stakeholders define what constitutes 
actionable cyber threat information and exploring how the 
same fosters their participation in the information sharing 
ecosystem. It also ensures that everyone contributes in the 
information sharing process to reduce the problem of free-
riding [5][44].  
VIII. CONCLUSION  
This position paper began by introducing information 
sharing and its role in enhancing cyber resilience in multi-
stakeholder domains. Specific to the maritime domain, 
various information sharing initiatives were highlighted 
through articles of legislation, funded projects, and 
regulatory authority guidelines. The IACS regulations [31]–
[33] are the closest that the maritime sector has in terms of a 
communication structure between the various vessel cyber 
resilience stakeholders. However, these were tailored 
towards compliance with regulatory requirements rather 
than to be used as cyber threat information sharing 
structures. 
Nevertheless, the increasing adoption of SOCs in the 
multi-stakeholder maritime domain necessitates the need to 
have efficient cyber threat information sharing structures, 
which are critical to vessel safety, security, and timely 
resolution of cyber incidents. We believe that the 
communication pathways proposed by the new IACS 
regulations, enforceable for newly contracted vessels as 
from January 1st, 2024, provide an excellent starting point as 
a stable structure. Further research therefore needs to be 
done to ascertain their usability and applicability for cyber 
threat information sharing within the vessel cyber resilience 
domain.
