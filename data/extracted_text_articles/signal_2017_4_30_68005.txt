Abstract—This paper presents a resource allocation algorithm
for multi-user wireless networks affected by co-channel interfer-
ence. The analysis considers a network with one base station
(BS) that uses a multiple antenna transmitter (beamformer) to
schedule (in a time-division manner) transmissions towards a
set of J one-antenna terminals in the presence of K persistent
interferers. The transmitter is assumed to employ Maximum-
Ratio Combining (MRC) beamforming with spatially-correlated
branches and channel envelopes modelled as Rayleigh-distributed
processes. The BS has access to an imperfect (outdated) copy
of the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) of each
terminal. Based on this CSI at the transmitter side (CSIT), the BS
proceeds to select (at each time interval or time-slot) the terminal
with the highest channel strength for purposes of transmission.
This imperfect CSIT is also used to calculate the coefﬁcients of the
beamformer that will be used to transmit information towards the
scheduled terminal, as well as for selecting the most appropriate
modulation format (threshold-based decision). In addition, the
transmission towards each scheduled terminal is assumed to
experience persistent co-channel interference that will degrade
the quality of the information reception process. The main merits
of this work are the following: 1) joint analysis of MRC-based
beamforming, terminal scheduling based on maximum channel
strength, and modulation assignment, and 2) joint modelling
of the effects of spatial correlation, co-channel interference
and imperfect CSIT. Results suggest that scheduling helps in
rejecting co-channel interference and the degrading effects of
imperfect CSIT. Spatial correlation could some times lead to
better performance than the uncorrelated case, particularly in the
low SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) regime. Conversely, uncorrelated
branches always outperform the correlated case in the high SNR
regime. The use of higher numbers of antennas also improve
performance of the system. However, spatial correlation tends
to accumulate over the antenna array thus leading to a more
noticeable performance degradation and more allocation errors
due to the outdated CSIT assumption.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple antenna systems (also known as MIMO or
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output systems) are expected to pro-
liferate in the coming years, particularly in the context of
5G or ﬁfth generation of mobile systems [1]. The growing
demand for wireless connectivity, the limited transmission
resources, and the outdated spectrum allocation paradigm
have created the need for more efﬁcient and higher capacity
transmission systems. MIMO technology offers considerable
capacity growth that escalates with the number of transmit-
receive antenna pairs. In addition to this, MIMO also offers
improved energetic efﬁciency and reduced interference with
minimum spectrum expenditure [2].
From the many different types of multiple antenna sys-
tems, perhaps beamforming technology represents the option
with higher potential for commercial solutions, mainly due to
its maturity, ﬂexible implementation, and low computational
costs. Beamforming refers to the ability to dynamically steer
the phases of an antenna array and change the directionality
properties of the resulting radiation beams. This enables a wide
set of applications in multi-user settings, such as: interference
rejection/management [3], spatial multiplexing [4], and more
recently (with a few modiﬁcations) 3D beamforming with mas-
sive MIMO in 5G [5], beam-division multiple access [6], and
interference alignment [7]. In future networks, beamforming
will be key for efﬁciently organizing spectrum resources in
dense small cells, as well as minimizing energy expenditure,
reducing leakage and/or interference to adjacent cells or termi-
nals, and also for improving security against potential attacks
of signal jamming or eavesdropping in the network.
All these recent advances in the physical layer of mul-
tiple antenna systems need to be integrated with upper layer
algorithms. This has opened several issues regarding the cross-
layer design and optimization of beamforming and in general
multiple-antenna systems. One particularly important topic in
this ﬁeld is the modelling of the underlying multiple antenna
signal processing tools to be used in resource allocation and
system-level evaluation frameworks. In large network set ups
with tens or hundreds of BSs and hundreds or thousands
of terminals, all the details of the PHYsical (PHY) layer
cannot be usually included in full detail in the analysis or
simulation loop. Therefore, a trade-off must be found between
the accuracy of the model that represents the underlying PHY-
layer and its ﬂexibility for purposes of resource allocation and
optimisation at the system-level.
This paper attempts to partially ﬁll these gaps by ad-
dressing the link-layer interface modelling in Rayleigh fading
correlated channels of an adaptive wireless multi-user network
using Maximum-Ratio Combining (MRC) beamforming and
terminal scheduling based on limited (outdated) feedback.
The transmitter selects the most adequate Modulation and
Coding Schemes (MCSs) and beamforming vectors based on
an estimated Channel State Information (CSI). This imperfect
CSI at the transmitter side (i.e., CSIT) is assumed to have
been initially collected by the receiver (perfect estimation), and
subsequently reported back to the transmitter via a feedback
channel affected by delay. This paper presents the analysis
of the statistics of correct reception process conditional on the
decision made by the transmitter (modulation format selection,
beamforming and scheduling) based on the inaccurate CSIT.

model based on an instantaneous Signal-to-Interference-plus-
Noise Ratio (SINR) adaptive switching threshold scheme
for modulation assignment. This model aims to provide an
accurate but ﬂexible representation of the underlying PHY-
layer suitable for upper-layer design. In the proposed model,
a packet transmission using a given MCS is considered as
correctly received with given values of BLock-Error Rate
(BLER) and spectral efﬁciency whenever the instantaneous
SINR exceeds the reception threshold of the selected MCS.
The reception parameters of each MCS are obtained from
Look-Up-Tables (LUTs) previously calculated via off-line
PHY-layer simulation. The main contribution of this work is
the joint analysis of spatial correlation, imperfect CSIT and co-
channel interference in link adaptation and terminal scheduling
for MRC-based multiple antenna beamforming systems.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
previous works and the achievements of this paper with respect
to the state of the art. Section III describes the system model
and the assumptions of the paper. Section IV presents the link-
layer interface model. Section V deals with the statistics of
the estimated SNR and the instantaneous SINR. Section VI
presents analytic results and sketches of the statistics of packet
reception using different network assumptions. Finally, Section
VII presents the conclusions of this paper.

PREVIOUS WORKS
The
simplest
multiple
antenna
system
is
the
MRC
transceiver, which provides a relatively ﬂexible framework for
statistical analysis and interface modelling. The literature of
MRC transceivers has focused on the derivation of outage
and bit error probability distributions (see [18]-[26]). The
effects of imperfect channel knowledge on the performance of
MRC receivers in Rayleigh fading correlated channels can be
found in [18]-[19] following the analysis with perfect channel
estimation presented in [20]. A series expansion of the statistics
of MRC systems with correlated Rician channels is given
in [21]. A uniﬁed approach for analysis of two-stage MRC
systems with hybrid selection in generalized Rice correlated
channels was proposed in [22]. Extensions to the case of co-
channel interference are given in [23]-[26].
The present work considers the extension of outage prob-
ability analysis of MRC transmitters (beamformers) to the
study of Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) in Rayleigh
fading correlated channels with imperfect/outdated CSIT and
co-channel interference. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst attempt in the literature that addresses these issues
under the same framework. This work attempts to extend the
analysis of MRC systems towards including resource allocation
aspects which are typical of upper layer design (radio resource
management). In addition, network design and in particular
resource allocation for multiple antenna systems is usually
conducted under the assumption perfect CSIT. Imperfect CSIT
has been addressed in [27] for distributed systems and in [28]
for energy efﬁcient MIMO link adaptation. In comparison with
these works, which are focused on numerical evaluation of
imperfect CSIT, this work provides an analytic framework
for obtaining the statistics of errors in MCS assignment for
correlated MRC transmitters.
A related topic is the analysis of the effects of limited
feedback in adaptive modulation for beam-forming and mul-
tiple antenna systems. The work in [29] provides a review
of the state of the art of limited feedback in adaptation
schemes for MIMO systems. The work in [30] presents the
analysis of adaptive modulation for two-antenna beam-formers
considering mean CSI at the transmitter side. The work in [31]
addressed the impact of outdated feedback on AMC and user
selection diversity systems for MIMO systems in Rayleigh
uncorrelated channels. Other works with limited feedback
for different types of system can be found in [33]-[35]. All
these previous works consider uncorrelated MIMO channels.
This work goes beyond this assumption searching for a joint
analysis of limited feedback and spatial correlation for adaptive
MRC transmitters with co-channel interference.

SYSTEM MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
Consider the network depicted in Figure 1 with one Base
Station (BS) scheduling transmissions towards J terminals (in
a time-division fashion), each one with one receiving antenna,
and a set of K persistent single-antenna interferers. The BS
uses an N-antenna Maximum-Ratio Combining (MRC) beam-
former that is used to transmit information to a given terminal
at speciﬁc time slots. The channel vector between the BS and
the jth terminal is denoted by hj = [hj(1), hj(2), . . . hj(N)]T .
All instantaneous channel variables will be modelled as zero-
mean complex circular Gaussian random variables with vari-
ance γ: hj(n) ∼ CN(0N, γIN) . The estimated channel
variable available at the transmitter side is given by ˆhj =
[ˆhj(1), ˆhj(2), . . . ˆhj(N)]T . This information is used by the BS
for purposes of beamforming, terminal scheduling and resource
allocation (modulation format assignment). The channel be-
tween the interferer k towards terminal j is denoted by hk,j
and is modelled as a zero-mean complex circular Gaussian
random variable with variance λ: hk,j ∼ CN(0, λ).
The transmitter selects one of M modulation formats,
which are arranged in increasing order according to their
target Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR). The
target SINR of the mth MCS will be denoted by βm. The
variables θm and ηm will denote, respectively, the BLER and
spectral efﬁciency (in bps/Hz) considering operation at the
target SINR of the mth MCS. It is assumed that the receiver
monitors the quality of the channel and reports it back to the
transmitter. Based on this collected Channel State Information
(CSI), the transmitter selects the most appropriate MCS using
a correction for the decision thresholds denoted here by ˆβm.
This paper considers perfect channel estimation at the receiver
side and imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
side (CSIT). Imperfect CSIT is assumed to be mainly due to a

Note that in this paper it is assumed that an estimate of
interference Ij = PK
k=1 hk,jˇsk in (1) is not available at
the transmitter. Therefore, all decisions will be based on an
estimate of the SNR in (2). The estimated channels will be
generated using the following linear correlation model:

p
1 − ρZj(n) + √ρGj,

where ρ is the spatial correlation coefﬁcient and the terms
Zj(n) and Gj are the zero-mean complex circular Gaus-
sian variables with variance γ. Note that this correlation
model complies with E[ˆhj(n)∗ˆhj(˜n)] = ργ, n ̸= ˜n, and
E[ˆhj(n)∗ˆhj(n)] = γ. This correlation model constitutes an ap-
proximation of real-life settings by assuming that all elements
experience the same correlation with each other. In real-life
systems, antennas farther apart from each other experience less
correlation than contiguous elements. The correlation model
for imperfect CSIT is given by:

LINK LAYER MODEL
The probability of selection of a modulation format m is
given by the probability that the estimated SNR ˆXj at the
transmitter side lies within the interval [ˆβm, ˆβm+1]:
Pr{ˆβm ≤ ˆXj < ˆβm+1}
(6)
Link-layer throughput (denoted by T) will be expressed as a
linear contribution of all possible MCSs with their respective
selection probabilities from (6) and conditional reception prob-
abilities, each one weighted by their conditional throughput
performance (Tm):

ˆXj},
(7)
where Tm(Γj) indicates of the link-layer throughput of termi-
nal j when using the mth MCS conditional on a given value
of the operational SINR Γj in (5) of the selected terminal. In
this paper, we consider a simpliﬁcation of this expression, by

assuming that the term Tm(Γ) in (7) is a step function deﬁned
by a switching SINR threshold βm above which all packet
transmissions are assumed to be correctly received with a given
BLER θm and spectral efﬁciency ηm. The simpliﬁcation can
be expressed as follows:
T =
M
X
m=1
∆BWηm(1−θm)Pr{Γj∗ ≥ βm|ˆβm ≤ ˆXj∗ < ˆβm+1}
Pr{ˆβm ≤ ˆXj∗ < ˆβm+1}Pr{j∗ = arg max
j
ˆXj}
(8)
where ∆BW is the operational bandwidth in Hz, Pr{j∗ =
arg maxj( ˆXj)} is the probability of terminal to experience
the highest estimated SNR and therefore being scheduled for
transmission by the BS, and Pr{Γj∗ ≥ βm|ˆβm ≤
ˆXj∗ <
ˆβm+1} is the probability of the instantaneous SINR Γj∗ to
surpass the threshold βm provided the estimated SNR ˆXj∗
(used for MCS selection and terminal scheduling) lies in the
range [ˆβm, ˆβm+1].
Note that this last conditional probability term captures
the effects of imperfect CSIT on the performance of the
beamforming, scheduling and adaptation scheme. In the case
of perfect CSIT (ρc → 0), correct reception occurs with proba-
bility one. Also, note that the link-layer throughput expression
in (8) represents only an approximation (compression) of the
real performance of the system. The simpliﬁed model in (8)
assumes packets are erroneous when the instantaneous SINR
drops below the reception threshold βm, when in practice there
might be some cases where correct reception can still occur.
Conversely, some cases with higher instantaneous SNR than
the reception threshold could also lead to erroneous packet
transmissions. This type of compression/abstraction model as
in (8) has been proved accurate for system-level simulation
of networks with considerable excursions of path-loss values,
which are typical of cellular systems where terminals lie at
different distances from the access point.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The following subsections present the derivation of analytic
expressions of the different terms of the link-layer throughput
model in (8) . For convenience, it is useful to derive the
statistics of the estimated SNR (presented in Section V-A)
and then deal with the statistics of the instantaneous SINR
(presented in Section V-B) conditional on the MCS selection,
terminal scheduling, and beamforming processes.
A. Statistics of estimated SNR
Let us now substitute the correlation model described by
(3) in the expression of the estimated SNR in (2), which yields:

The statistics of the estimated SNR have been investigated
in our previous work in [36]. The sub-index j is dropped
in subsequent derivations due to the symmetrical network
assumption. The probability density function (PDF) and com-
plementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) are given,
respectively, by [36]:

(4) into the expression of the instantaneous SINR in (5):

Since we are interested in the reception probability term
Pr{Γj > βm} we can use (21) to express the term Pr{Γj >
βm}as follows:
Pr{Γj > βm} =
Pr
(
PρcˆhH

Pr{Γj > βm} =
Pr{PρcˆhH

v}.
The characteristic function of ψj conditionally on a particular
value of ˆhj is the addition of two random variables: a Gaussian
process with mean PρcXj and variance P
p
(1 − ρ2c)Xj/2 and
a chi-square random variable with K degrees of freedom and
parameter −βλ. This can be mathematically written as follows:
Ψψj|hj(iω) = ejP ρcXj+ω2P√
(1−ρ2c)Xj/2
(1 + iωβmλ)K
.
The CF conditional on the decision made by the transmitter
can be obtained as follows:
Ψψj|βm<Xj<βm+1(iω) =
Z
βm
Ψψj|Xj(iω)f(Xj)dXj.
This term will be evaluated numerically and then transformed
into the PDF domain to obtain the statistics of instantaneous
SINR conditional on the decion made by the transmitter.

RESULTS
This section presents graphical results of the statistics of
the MRC beamformer with adaptive modulation, scheduling
and co-channel interference with imperfect CSIT. Figure 2
displays the results of the Cumulative Distribution Function
(CDF) of the SNR of the scheduler conditional on the decision
made by the transmitter based on imperfect CSIT using a
hypothetical MCS selection threshold equal to (ˆβ = 2). The
results in Figure 2 have been obtained using ﬁxed transmit
power settings (Pγ/σ2
v = 1) assuming no interference with
different numbers of antennas (N = 2, N = 4) and different
values of correlation coefﬁcients (ρ = 0.2, ρ = 0.95, ρc = 0.2
and ρc = 0.95).
Figure 3 shows the results for the CDF of the SNR using
the same settings as in the previous example, except for the
transmit power which is now set to Pγ/σ2
v = 5. The objective
of investigating the conditional CDF is to observe the effects
of imperfect CSIT on the instantaneous SNR experienced by
the scheduled terminals. The results show the heavy inﬂuence
of imperfect CSIT on the characteristics of the CDF. Low
values of the correlation coefﬁcient ρ → 0, see a considerable
degradation on the probability of correct reception. Note that
all curves of the CDF depart from the hypothetical decision
threshold set to ˆβ = 2. This departure to the left-hand side
of the ﬁgure is a measure of the incorrect reception due to
imperfect CSIT. All the curves at the top left of the ﬁgure are
indeed the curves with worse CSIT conditions. It is observed

that spatial correlation degrades performance at high values
of SNR, but it could be beneﬁcial in the low SNR regime.
In some cases, spatial diversity provided by higher numbers
of antennas can even compensate for the effects of imperfect
CSIT, particularly at with low values of spatial correlation. In
all cases in both ﬁgures, it is observed that the performance of
the CDF is superior with higher numbers of terminals in the
scheduler, but this gain is more noticeable in channels with low
spatial correlation. It can be also observed that user scheduling
reduces the effects of spatial correlation. Spatial correlation
reduces the diversity gains of the combining beamformer, and
it can be accumulated over the several antennas resulting in a
more noticeable performance reduction. User scheduling pro-
vides extra diversity gains that can compensate this reduction.
The results presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4 have been
obtained using the same settings used in the previous two
examples, except for the interference assumption. The channel
power settings of the K = 2 persistent interferers were all set
to λ/γ = 0.1. The results show the CDF of the instantaneous
SINR instead of the SNR. The CDF results show how affected
the system becomes by the presence of interference. It becomes
evident that the presence of interference affects also how
the spatial correlation plays a role on the performance of
the system. This will become more evident in the results of
throughput presented in the following ﬁgures.

transmission system with different modulation formats, we
have used the settings of the WiMAX standard and its different
modulation schemes (see Table II). The results in Figure 4 and
Figure 5 present the overall throughput for a network with
different numbers of users included in the scheduler versus
different values of transmit average SNR. Figure 4 shows the
results with no interference, while Figure 5 shows the results
with K = 2 interferers using set to λ/γ = 0.1. The results
with interference show several changing patterns due to the
complex relation between interference and the received signal
by the terminals. Surprisingly at high values of transmit SNR
some of the curves with low spatial correlation tend to perform
worse that the correlated cases, which can only be explained
by the increased importance of the interference term and the
parameters of the modulation formats used in the simulation.

CONCLUSIONS
This paper has presented an analytical framework for the
study of joint MRC beamforming, terminal scheduling and
resource allocation (modulation assignment) algorithms for
multiuser networks in the presence of persistent co-channel

interference. The results show that co-channel interference can
considerably affect the performance of beamforming, being
counteracted by the effects of scheduling and higher degree
of accuracy of channel state information at the transmitter
side. The number of antennas tends to reduce the effects of
imperfect CSIT and interference. However, channel correlation
can affect these gains, particularly in the high SNR regime.
Conversely, in the low SNR regime it seems that channel
correlation can outperform the case on uncorrelated channels.
Spatial correlation effects tend to be accumulated when the
number of antennas increases and therefore its effects will be
more clearly observed in the high SNR regime.

APPENDIX
Derivation of order statistics of estimated SNR in (2)
Using the multinomial theorem, it is possible to obtain a
formula for the term F ˆ
X(y)J−1 considering the expression in
(11):
F ˆ
X(y)J−1 =
X
l0,l1,...lN=J−1

J − 1

(−A)lN−1e−

where lt is the exponent index of the t-th element of the
multinomial expression(x0 + x1 + x2 + xt + xN)J−1 , con-
sidering that xt = e−y˜γ yt
˜γtt!
PN−1−t
u=1
−Bu, 0 ≤ t ≤ N − 2,
xN−1 = −Ae− y
ˇγ , xN = 1. The previous expression can be
reorganized as follows:
F ˆ
X(y)J−1 =
X
l0+l1+lN=J−1

J − 1

By substituting the previous expression back in (12) we
then obtain:

A further modiﬁcation of this expression leads to:
