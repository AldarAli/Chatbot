Abstract—A separation problem of acoustic signals and noise
by using the independent component analysis (ICA) with band-
pass ﬁlters is proposed. The frequency distribution of a recorded
acoustic signal of the operating mechanical device can be divided
into three ﬁelds, the low-frequency ﬁeld, which corresponds to the
frequency characteristics of the gear, the medium-frequency ﬁeld,
which is mixed with the frequency characteristics of the gear and
the motor, and the high-frequency ﬁeld, which corresponds to the
frequency characteristics of the motor. Since only the medium-
frequency components are the mixture of acoustic signals of gears
and motors, the ICA with band-pass ﬁlters is expected to separate
the acoustic signals of motors and gears more accurately than
the conventional ICA. The simulation and experimental results
show that the proposed method can separate the acoustic signals
of motors and gears of mechanical devices successfully.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the quality evaluation of mechanical devices, it is im-
portant to separate the acoustic signals of motors and gears in
order to identify the causes of failures. The ICA method, which
is developed to solve the cocktail-party problem, can separate
two independent acoustic signals from their mixtures by using
the information measure of statistically independent properties
[1],[2], and [3]. However, many applications in practice denote
that the ICA does not perform well in separation by using the
observed acoustic signals directly [4]-[5]. In order to separate
the independent acoustic signals correctly, additional data pro-
cessing is necessary before applying the ICA. By applying the
fast Fourier transform (FFT) to a recorded acoustic signal of
the operating mechanical device, we observe that its frequency
distribution can be divided into three ﬁelds, the low-frequency
ﬁeld, which corresponds to the frequency characteristics of
the gear, the medium-frequency ﬁeld, which is mixed with
the frequency characteristics of the gear and the motor, and
the high-frequency ﬁeld, which corresponds to the frequency
characteristics of the motor. Since the frequencies of a motor
may be harmonics of the fundamental frequencies of a gear,
which causes the independence assumption of the sources
to fail and affects the separation accuracy. Therefore, the
mixed acoustic signals with less frequency components are
expected to be separated more accurately. In this paper, the
ICA with band-pass ﬁlters is used to separate the acoustic
signals of gears and motors. We ﬁrst record the acoustic
signals of the operating mechanical devices. By applying the
band-pass ﬁlters, the respective components of low- frequency,
medium-frequency and high-frequency can be obtained. Then
the medium-frequency components are given to the ICA.
After separation, the acoustic signals of gears and motors are
recovered by adding the low-frequency and high-frequency
components to the separated results, respectively. In this paper,
the mixtures of two independent signals are also designed to
simulate the separation process of acoustic signals of a gear
and a motor. Both the simulation results and the experimental
results show that the better separation results can be obtained
by using the mixed medium-frequency ﬁeld than using the
whole frequency ﬁeld.
II. PRINCIPLE OF ICA
Let us summarize the principle of the ICA and state some
problem when we use the ICA directly. For simplicity, we
assume two source signals denoted by s1 and s1 which are
statistically independent each other. Furthermore, we assume
that those signals are observed by two microphones and
denoted by x1 and x2. The relation is given by the following
equations:
x1 = a11s1 + a12s2x2 = a21s1 + a22s2
(1)
where aij, i, j = 1, 2 are unknown constant. Using the vector
notation, we have
x = As,
x = (y1, y2)t, s = (s1, s2)t
(2)
where an unknown matrix A is given by
A =
(
a11
a12
a21
a22
)
.
From the observed vector x, we estimate the original signal
vector s by the following linear transform
ˆs = wx
(3)
where
w =
(
w11
w12
w21
w22
)
such that the following J can be minimized
J =
∫
p(ˆs)log
p(ˆs)
p( ˆs1)p( ˆs2)dˆs.
(4)
There are some algorithms to minimize J, we adopt the fast
ICA developed by Hyvarinen A. et al [1]

III. SIMULATION RESULTS
We have tried the signal separation using the fast ICA
algorithm in case of f1 = 20Hz,f2 = 140Hz,f3 = 100Hz, and
f4 = 240Hz and a11 = 2, a12 = 1.2, a21 = 1, and a22 = 1.3.
The spectra of two independent signals x1(t) and x2(t) are
illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The corresponding
spectra of recovered signals are illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4.
From these results, signal separations for these data are
not good since frequencies except for the original signals are
remained.
However, if we select several frequencies, some combina-
tions of them could recover the original signals perfectly. To
see this effect, we have tried the following simulation in case
where f1, f2 and f4 are ﬁxed and f3 is changed.
If we use two microphones to record the acoustic signals,
we have two observed signals given by
x1(t) = a11s1(t) + a12s2(t)
x2(t) = a21s1(t) + a22s2(t).
We use the ICA to separate the two independent acoustic
signals s1(t) and s2(t) from the observed signals x1(t) and
x2(t). Table I shows the separation results where ”Y” denotes
that the independent signals s1(t) and s2(t) can be separated
correctly and ”N” denotes that they cannot be separated

correctly. From Table I, it can be seen that sometimes we
fail in separating the acoustic signals s1(t) and s2(t) by using
the observed signals x1(t) and x2(t) directly.
However, after ﬁltering the frequency components f1 and
f4 with a band-pass ﬁlter, the frequency components f2 and
f3 can be separated successfully by using the ICA. Thus, the
original acoustic signals s1(t) and s2(t) can be obtained by
adding the frequency components f1 and f4 to the separation
results of the ICA, respectively. As an example, Figs. 7 and 8
show the frequency characteristics of separated signals ˆs1(t)
and ˆs2(t) by using the ICA with band-pass ﬁlters, respectively
where f1 = 100Hz. From these ﬁgures, it can be seen that the
two acoustic signals of s1(t) and s2(t) are recovered correctly.
Similarly, other unsuccessful separation experiments of Ta-
ble I are redone by using the ICA with band-pass ﬁlters. The
simulation results show that all the signals are separated suc-
cessfully. And the separation experiments of mixed acoustic
signals with multi-frequencies also show that the ICA with
band-pass ﬁlters performs better than the conventional ICA in
acoustic signals separation.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
According to the above simulation results, we separate the
acoustic signals of motors and gears of mechanical devices
by using the ICA with band-pass ﬁlters. The acoustic signals
recording system is shown in Fig.5. Two microphones, which
are held in different locations, are used to record the acoustic
signals of operating mechanical devices. By applying the band-
pass ﬁlters, we obtain the respective components of low-
frequency, medium-frequency and high-frequency. Since only
the medium-frequency components are the mixture of acoustic
signals of gears and motors, we input the medium-frequency
components to the ICA. Then the acoustic signals of gears
and motors can be recovered by adding the low-frequency
and high-frequency components to the separation results of
the ICA, respectively.
An example of acoustic signals recorded by microphones
L and R are shown in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively where
the sampling rate is 8,000. Their frequency characteristics are
shown in Figs. 12 and 13. Since the rotational speed of the
motor is 3600 rpm and the rotor has 12 poles, the fundamental
frequency of the motor is about 360 Hz. Similarly, since the
gear ratio is 30:1, the fundamental frequency of the gear is
about 12 Hz. Thus, it can be considered that the medium-
frequency is the range of 300 to 2,000 Hz and the relevant
band-pass ﬁlters are designed.
In Figs. 14 and 15, the medium-frequency ﬁelds of acoustic
signals of left and right microphones with the band-pass ﬁlter
are given respectively. The ﬁltered signals are used as the input
of the ICA. The spectra of the separated acoustic signals are

of the motor, can be observed in Fig. 12, it is regarded that
Figs. 16 and 17 show the medium-frequency ﬁelds of acoustic

To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we
also give the separation results by applying the recorded
acoustic signals of mechanical devices to the ICA directly.

The frequency characteristics of the separated acoustic signal
are shown in Figs. 18 and 20, and the medium-frequency
characteristics are shown in Figs. 19 and 21. Comparing
with Figs. 12 and 13, it can be concluded that Figs. 18-20
show the frequency characteristics of the motor and the gear,
respectively.
From the above ﬁgures, it can be seen that the ICA with
band-pass ﬁlters performs better than the conventional ICA in
acoustic signals separation. The spectrum of Fig. 19 is similar
with the one of Fig. 21, especially the peaks of amplitudes
appeared in both ﬁgures, which are located in the multiple of
fundamental frequency of the motor, denote that the separation
results of acoustic signals of the motor and the gear are not
good.
The acoustic signals of the gear and the motor are recovered
by adding the low-frequency and high- frequency components
to the separation results of Figs. 16 and 17, respectively. The
spectra of recovered acoustic signals of the gear and the motor
are shown in Figs. 22 and 23 where the amplitudes of medium-
frequency are adjusted according to the amplitudes of low-
frequency and high-frequency, respectively. Comparing with
the above ﬁgures, it can be concluded that the separation
results are reasonable. The separated acoustic signals of the

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a method of separating the acoustic signals of
gears and motors of mechanical devices by using the ICA with
band-pass ﬁlter is proposed. The simulation results denote that
the mixed acoustic signals with less frequency components
can achieve better separation performance by using the ICA.
Therefore, for those independent signals which are mixed only
in medium-frequency ﬁeld, the ICA with band-pass ﬁlters can
separate the independent original signals more accurately than
the conventional ICA. Using the proposed method, we have
solved the acoustic signals separation problem of gears and
motors of mechanical devices successfully.
