Abstract—Body temperature is an important homeothermic
autoregulation
of
humans.
Body
temperature
is
usually
controlled by autonomic nervous system (ANS). When a
person has suffered a virus or bacterial infection, it causes
fever. The ANS rises the body temperature by tachycardia and
cutaneous vasomotion. The common non-invasive indication
for ANS is based on heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse
rate variability (PRV). However, these two methods are limited
by the timescale of time series. Instantaneous PRV (iPRV) was
proposed as a surrogate of HRV in frequency domain and
breaks the restriction of timescale. In this paper, thirty
subjects were recruited for the study; the body temperature
and the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal were acquired in
supine position for ten minutes. Fifteen fever subjects, whose
body temperature was higher than 37.9 °C, are in Group Fev.,
the others are in Group Ctr. The results show that the power
of iPRV in normalized low frequency (nLF) in Group
Fev.(0.63±0.13, p<0.05) was significantly higher than that in
Group Ctr.(0.47±0.16). And the power of iPRV in normalized
high frequency (nHF) in Group Fev.(0.38 ±0.13, p<0.05) was
significantly lower than that in Group Ctr.(0.54±0.16). Besides,
the nVHF might have a potential for indicating the peripheral
circulation and providing
more information about
body
regulation.

INTRODUCTION
Body temperature, which usually refers to the rectal
temperature in animals, is an important homeothermic
autoregulation of humans. In many mammals, the preoptic
area (POA), a region of hypothalamus, is considered as the
thermoregulatory center. The normal body temperature is
about 36.5°C~37.5 °C and it is affected by the environmental
temperature. When the receptor receives an environment
temperature change, POA controls some organs activities or
reaction to regulate the body temperature, and then the body
temperature also sends feedback to POA for maintaining the
body temperature. Sometimes, an abnormal rise in body
temperature occurs, which is higher than normal body
temperature, and we call it fever. It is usually caused by
infection of bacterium or virus. When a person gets fever, the
hypothalamus changes the set point to the higher temperature
and
it makes the body feel cold because the body
temperature is lower than the set point. Therefore, POA tries
to rise the body temperature [1].
There are many mechanisms to regulate the body
temperature like cutaneous vasomotion, tachycardia, etc.
Most of them are controlled by the autonomic nervous
system (ANS), which is dominated by POA. So, the body
temperature regulation can be observed by ANS activities [2].
Heart rate variability (HRV) [3], a common assessment
for cardiovascular circulation in clinic, has been widely used
as an ANS activities observation. It is measured by a non-
invasion
instrument,
electrocardiogram
(ECG),
and
calculated by beat-to-beat interval (RRI, which is the interval
between R peaks in ECG.) series to get time domain or
frequency domain index. However, the study of HRV is
limited by timescale because of RRI (Fig 1(a)).
Pulse
rate
variability
(PRV),
another
non-invasive
method, was proposed for replacing HRV to provide not
only ANS activities but also the information of peripheral
circulation (Fig. 1(b)). PRV is measured by photoplethysm-
ography (PPG) and calculated by peak-to-peak interval (PPI)
instead of ECG and RRI. Previous studies have determined
that PRV acts as a surrogate of HRV during non-stationary
conditions [4][5].
Nevertheless,
timescale of PPI
still
restricted the study of PRV.

Because both HRV and PRV have timescale restrictions,
a
new
measurement
named
instantaneous
pulse
rate
variability (iPRV) was proposed [6]. iPRV adopts the PRV
technique and the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [7] for
breaking the timescale limitation. However, there is a
problem called mode-mixing problem that occurs during the
process of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in the
HHT. For solving this problem, ensemble EMD, a noise-
assisted technique, was proposed [8]. Previous studies have
determined that iPRV is reliable by using PPG during non-
stationary condition [9][10], and iPRV can not only observe
ANS activities like HRV and PRV, but also provide higher
frequency band information [6]. Nevertheless, the meaning
of this frequency band still is undetermined.
Body temperature is part of a mechanism of body
regulation. We can assess the health status of a person by
observing the variety of body reactions, such as ANS
activities and peripheral circulation, when body temperature
change. Peripheral blood vessels constrict when a person
gets fever. It is possible to observe the regulation of
peripheral blood vessels in VHF. This paper applied the
iPRV method to compare the difference between fever
patients and others and to find out the meaning of the index
calculated by iPRV.

METHOD
A.
Subjects and data collection
The experiment was carried out in Yo-Yo Clinic,
Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The body temperature was measured by
ear thermometer (Radiant TH889, Radiant Innovation Inc.)
and the signal was acquired by PPG (Nonin 8500, Nonin
Medical Inc.) with 200 Hz sampling rate.
Thirty subjects (19 males; age 10.5±2.9), whose ages
were 7 to 18 years old, were recruited in this study. Fifteen
subjects (10 males; age 10.1±2.4) with fever, whose body
temperature was higher than 37.9 °C, served as Group Fev.
and the others served as Group Ctr. We measured the body
temperature of all recruited subjects before the experiment.
Then participants wore the PPG sensor on the right index
finger and rested quietly in supine position for 10 minutes.
This experiment was approved by the institutional review
board of the National Chiao Tung University. Informed
consent
was
obtained
from
all
subjects
before
the
experiment.
B.
iPRV procedure
iPRV applies the frequency extension method based on
HHT [7] to PRV for the continuous-time heart rate rhythm.
There is an important process during HHT called EMD. The
steps of EMD are shown in Fig. 2. First, find the local
maximum and local minimum, compute upper envelope and
lower envelope by cubic spline and calculate the mean of
these two envelopes. Then use the input data to subtract the
average envelope. The above steps make up what is called
the sifting process. After the sifting process, use the input
data to subtract the average envelope and determine if the
result is intrinsic mode functions (IMF) or not. It is IMF if
the data satisfies by following two requirements: one is that
the number of local extrema must be equal to the number of
zero-crossings or differ at most by one, and two, is that, at
any
point,
the
value
of
the
average
envelope
must
approximately equal to zero. If it is not IMF, replace the
input data by the result and redo the sifting process. Else,
output the IMF and subtract the input data by this IMF to get
the residue. Determine if the residue is a monotonic function
or not. If it is not monotonic function, let residue be the input

data and redo the above steps. Otherwise, the EMD finishes,
and there are many IMFs decomposed by EMD.
However, there is a problem called the mode-mixing
problem that may occur during the EMD process. For
solving it, the ensemble EMD method (EEMD) was
proposed [8]. EEMD is similar to EMD, but it adds white
noise before the sifting process to solve the mode-mixing
problem. In addition, EEMD does many times the EMD
and averages the output IMFs and average the output IMFs
to reduce the effect of white noise (Fig. 3).
After the EEMD process, one of the IMFs which is
sinusoid-like is considered as the heartbeats component and
is used for calculating the instantaneous frequency (IF) by
normalized direct quadrature (NDQ) [11].
The steps of iPRV are shown in Fig 4. One of the IMFs
extracted from the input PPG data by using EEMD is used as
continuous-time heart rate rhythm. The IF is computed by
NDQ and gets the instantaneous period (iPeriod) estimated
by the inversion of IF of IMF. The Fast Fourier transform
(FFT) is applied for power spectral analysis to estimate each
frequency band including low frequency (LF, 0.04 to 0.15
Hz), high frequency (HF, 0.15 to 0.4 Hz) and very high
frequency (VHF, 0.4 to 0.9 Hz) [3][6]. Besides, the iPRV
spectrum can find the heartbeats peak in much higher
frequency band (Fig. 5). The spectral analysis programs in
this study were developed by using a commercial software
platform (LabVIEW version 2013, National Instruments
Corp., Austin, USA).
The normalized LF power (nLF) and normalized HF
power (nHF) without VHF is calculated as in
nLF = LF / (TP – VHF)
(1)
 
nHF = HF / (TP - VHF) 
(2) 
where TP means total power and is computed as
TP = LF + HF + VHF
(3)
And, if we calculate the normalized power including the
VHF, the representation is as follow
nLF (including VHF) = LF / TP

RESULTS
The results of the body temperature, heartbeats per
second and power spectral analysis between the two groups
are shown in Table 1. The processing of the iPRV analysis
between Group Fev. and Group Ctr. is illustrated in Fig. 6.
The
body
temperatures
in
Group
Fev.(38.41±0.46,
p<0.05) are significantly higher than those in Group
Ctr.(36.33±0.32). The heart rates in Group Fev.(1.92±0.18,
p<0.05) are also significantly higher than those in Group Ctr.
(1.5±0.22).
In frequency domain analysis, the nLF values in Group
Fev.(0.63±0.13, p<0.05) are significantly higher than those
in Group Ctr.(0.47±0.16) . The LF-HF ratios in Group
Fev.(2.08 ±1.36, p<0.05) are also significantly higher than
those in Group Ctr.(1.1±0.87). On the other hand, nHF
values in Group Fev.(0.38 ±0.13, p<0.05) are significantly
lower than those in Group Ctr.(0.54±0.16). If we calculate
the normalized power including VHF, nHF values (including
VHF) in Group Fev.(0.19±0.07, p<0.05) are significantly
lower than those in Group Ctr.(0.31±0.12). In the nLF values
(including VHF) and nVHF values (including VHF) can be
observed a trend, and that trend is that the mean values of
nLF (including VHF) in Group Fev.(0.33±0.12) are higher
than those in Group Ctr.(0.26±0.11) and the mean of nVHF
values (including VHF) in Group Fev.(0.49±0.14) are lower
than those in Group Ctr.(0.43 ±0.1).
IV.
DISCUSSION
This study compares the difference between Group Fev.
and Group Ctr. by iPRV analysis. The result shows that the
person whose body temperature is higher usually had higher
number of heartbeats. The relationship between body
temperature and heartbeats per second is drawn in Fig 7.
However, it is not absolute because the heart rate is not only
influenced by body temperature. It is also influenced by the
environment temperature, others diseases, age and gender.
Nonetheless, the body temperature is still an important factor
to affect the heart rate.
Heart activities are usually dominated by ANS. It is
considered
that
the
heart
rate
increases
because
the
sympathetic system is more excited than the parasympathetic
system, and, on the contrary, the heart rate decrease because
the parasympathetic system is more excited than the
sympathetic system. The conventional HRV analysis in
frequency domain is usually used for the ANS activity
observation. The nLF is the percentage of LF in the sum of
LF and HF is usually thought as the activities of sympathetic,
and the nHF is the percentage of HF in the sum of LF and
HF is usually considered as the activities of parasympathetic.
The ratio of LF to HF is considered as the regulation of
sympathetic [3]. The correlation of iPRV and HRV in the
frequency domain analysis during non-stationary conditions
has been examined in LF and HF [6][9]. HRV analysis in
frequency domain rarely uses VHF because of the timescale
problem, but iPRV breaks the restriction and provides more
information in VHF.
The ANS rises the body temperature when someone has
fever [1][2]. Therefore, the sympathetic is more excited than
the parasympathetic. Regarding the results in Table 1., the

value of nLF and LF-HF ratio in Group Fev. is significantly
higher than Group Ctr. This means that the sympathetic is
actually more excited in fever patients. This result is the
same as the hypothesis.
If calculating the normalized power including VHF, only
the nHF values (including VHF) in Group Fev. are
significantly lower than those in Group Ctr. There is a trend,
and that trend is that the mean value of the nLF (including
VHF) and nVHF (including VHF) are larger in Group Fev.,
though this is not significant. Maybe the nLF values
(including VHF) and the nHF values (including VHF) do not
only
represent
the
activities
of
sympathetic
and
parasympathetic, but have more regulation mixed in them.
For VHF, maybe there is too much information to indicate
the difference between the two groups. The meaning of these
normalized powers need further research to examine.
For the new frequency band, VHF proposed by iPRV,
previous studies have assumed that VHF has possible
meaning
of
cardiac
output
or
peripheral
circulation
[6][12][13]. In this study, the fever patients have the
constriction of peripheral blood vessels, and it increases
blood pressure. These situations cannot be observed in LF
and HF by conventional HRV analysis. So, the VHF band
might also contain information of regulation between the
peripheral blood vessels and blood pressure, and the
normalized power calculated including VHF might contain
the regulation of ANS and peripheral circulation. The VHF
bandwidth is very wide (0.4 to 0.9 Hz), it is possible to find
more useful information by separating the band into more
numbers of narrow bandwidth. It needs further research and
investigation for verification.
V.
CONCLUSION
This study compares the difference between the fever
patients and people without fever by iPRV analysis and the
results showed that iPRV can explore ANS function as
conventional HRV analysis and, furthermore, provides more
information owing to the new frequency band (VHF). The
VHF has a possibility to indicate the regulation between the
peripheral
blood
vessel
and
blood
pressure
or
more
regulation
among
ANS
activities,
heart
activities
and
peripheral circulation. Nevertheless, it still needs further
work to verify its feasibility. Even so, it still has the potential
to be a useful indicator for healthcare by iPRV analysis.
