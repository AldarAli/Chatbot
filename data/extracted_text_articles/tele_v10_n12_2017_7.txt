Abstract—Timing estimation has been one of the major
research issue in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) systems. In the literature there are mainly two types
of preamble (data) aided timing estimation methods have been
proposed. One type of timing estimation methods that depend
on the speciﬁc structure of the preamble and the other type of
timing estimation methods that work independent of the structure
of the preamble. Performance of most of the timing estima-
tion methods, which work independent of the structure of the
preamble is severely affected in the presence of carrier frequency
offset (CFO). The challenge is to design a preamble structure
independent timing metric that should be robust to CFO. In this
paper, a data aided coarse (initial) timing estimation scheme for
OFDM system is proposed. Proposed timing estimation method is
independent of the structure of the preamble and it works better
than the other existing methods in the presence of CFO. The
algorithm is also capable of using multiple preambles for coarse
timing estimation. The performance is compared in terms of
probability of erasure, probability of correct estimation and mean
square error (MSE) with the existing timing synchronization
methods for OFDM systems.
Keywords—Timing synchronization; OFDM; Preamble; carrier
frequency offset; Timing metric; MSE; Probability of erasure;
Probability of correct estimation.

INTRODUCTION
A part of this work was presented at ICWMC 2016
conference [1]. The main impairments in a wireless commu-
nication system are multipath fading and noise [2]. Multipath
fading introduces inter symbol interference (ISI). The major
requirements of a digital communication system is to maximize
the bit rate, minimize bit error rate, minimize transmit power
and minimize transmission bandwidth [2] [3]. Orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has emerged as a
powerful technique which meets the above requirements in
multipath fading channels [4]. However, OFDM is known to be
very sensitive to timing and carrier frequency synchronization
errors [5].
Timing and frequency synchronization in OFDM systems
can be achieved by either data aided (DA) or non data aided
(NDA) method. In data aided method preamble or pilot is
transmitted along with data through multipath fading channel
for synchronization. It is assumed that preamble or pilot is
known to the receiver. Preamble is transmitted separately along
with the data in the time domain whereas pilots are inserted
within OFDM data in frequency domain. Preamble is used
for both timing and frequency synchronization as well as
channel estimation, whereas pilots are mainly used for carrier
frequency synchronization and channel estimation. In non data
aided method [6] [7], cyclic preﬁx is used for synchronization,
it is bandwidth efﬁcient because there is no need of additional
information (preamble). The drawback of this method is that
it is less accurate because CP is the part of OFDM data
and it (CP) is distorted by multipath fading (ISI) [8]. On
the other hand, DA method requires additional preambles for
synchronization; hence, it is less bandwidth efﬁcient than the
NDA method but accuracy is better than the NDA method. In
this paper, we focus on the data aided (DA) timing estimation
methods. Data aided timing estimation methods proposed in
the literature can be broadly classiﬁed into two categories:
1)
Approaches that depend on the special structure of
the preamble [5] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]
[16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]
[27].
2)
Approaches that work independent of the structure of
the preamble [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34].
Approaches that depend on the special structure of the pream-
ble can be categorized as
1)
Approaches that utilize repeated structure of the
preamble [5] [9] [10] [12] [15] [18] [20] [22] [26].
2)
Approaches that utilize symmetrical correlation of the
preamble [11] [13] [16] [17] [21].
3)
Approaches that utilize weighted structure of the
preamble [14] [23] [24] [25].
4)
Approaches that utilize both symmetrical correlation
as well as the weighted structure of the preamble [19]
[27].
The ﬁrst data aided timing estimation technique is proposed
in the literature by Schmidl et al. [5]. In [5], a preamble with
two identical halves is used for timing estimation. However, the
variance of the timing estimation is large due to timing metric
plateau. To reduce the variance of timing estimate a modiﬁed
preamble structure and new timing metric are proposed by
Minn et al. [9] [10]. In [9] [10], a preamble with four
identical halves with speciﬁc sign pattern is used to improve
the performance. However, the variance of Minn’s method is
still high in ISI channel. The performance is further improved
by Shi et al. [12]. Unlike Minn’s method a preamble with
four identical halves with speciﬁc sign pattern is used in [12].
In Minn’s method correlations between the adjacent blocks of
the preamble are utilized, whereas Shi’s method is capable of
utilizing correlations between the adjacent blocks as well as
correlations between the non adjacent blocks of the preamble.

Differential cross correlation is used in the methods proposed
by Awoseyila et al. [18] [22], to estimate the timing offset. A
preamble with two identical halves is utilized in the methods
proposed in [18] [22]. The methods proposed in [5] [9] [10]
[12] [15] [18] [22] utilize time domain repeated preamble to
estimate the timing offset. The method proposed by Pushpa
et al. [20] utilize frequency domain repeated preamble to
estimate the timing offset. Park et al. [11] propose the idea of
utilizing symmetrical correlation of the preamble for timing
synchronization. Later, the methods proposed by Kim et al.
[13], Seung et al. [16], Guo et al. [17], utilize symmetrical
correlation with their own preamble structure to estimate the
timing offset. Timing metrics proposed in [11] [13] [16] [17]
have impulsive shape at the correct timing point, so they give
better performance in multipath Rayleigh fading scenario but
the drawback of these metrics is they have sub peaks apart
from the correct timing point. In order to solve this problem
a new timing metric is proposed by Sajadi et al. [21]. Ren et
al. [14] propose the technique of utilizing weighted structure
of the preamble for timing synchronization. Later, the methods
proposed by Wang et al. [23], Fang et al. [24], Silva et al. [25]
utilize different weighted structure of the preamble to estimate
the timing offset. Zhou et al. [19] propose the idea of utilizing
both symmetrical correlation as well as weighted structure of
the preamble to estimate the timing offset. Later, a similar type
of technique is used in the method proposed by Shao et al.
[27].
All these methods are dependent on the special structure of
the preamble; hence, they cannot work with other preambles
and moreover the variance of the timing estimation of these
methods is high in multipath fading scenario. Kang et al.
[28] propose a technique to estimate timing offset that work
independent of the preamble structure. In [28], a delayed corre-
lation of the preamble is used for timing synchronization. The
performance is further improved by Hamed et al. [29] [30]. In
[29] [30], all correlation points are utilized without repetition.
In [32] [33] [34], a new timing estimation method using a
matched ﬁlter is proposed, which gives better performance
than [28] [29]. All these methods proposed in the literature
[28] [29] [30] [32] [33] [34], which work independent of
the structure of the preamble, utilize only one preamble for
timing synchronization. Hamed et al. [31] propose a timing
estimation method by utilizing more than one preamble. The
main drawback of these methods [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33]
is that the coarse timing estimation is severely degraded in the
presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO). CFO arises due to
two reasons, ﬁrst one is due to frequency mismatch between
the local oscillators used in the transmitter and receiver and
the another one is due to Doppler shift. CFO causes phase
rotation in the samples of the received signal. The phase
rotation affects timing synchronization. Here, we propose a
new timing estimation method using multiple preambles and
we also propose a modiﬁed timing estimation method, which
is robust to CFO.
This paper is organized as follows. The system model is
presented in Section II. The existing timing estimation methods
are discussed in Section III. The proposed method is presented
in Section IV. The simulation results are given in Section V
and ﬁnally, the conclusions in Section VI.

SYSTEM MODEL
Fig. 1 shows the typical structure of a OFDM frame in
the time domain. An OFDM frame contains preamble, cyclic
preﬁx (CP) and data. The preamble is used for synchronization.
Figure 1. OFDM frame structure in the time domain
The mth preamble in the frequency domain can be represented
in vector form as follows.
Xm = [Xm (0) Xm (1) ... Xm (N − 1)]
(1)
where 0 ≤ m ≤ M − 1. The IFFT of the mth preamble is
given by
xm (n) = 1

(2)
The mth preamble in the time domain can be represented in
vector form as follows
xm = [xm (0) xm (1) ... xm (N − 1)]
(3)
where 0 ≤ k, n ≤ N − 1. Let Xd denotes the frequency
domain data of the OFDM frame. Xd can be represented in
vector form as follows:
Xd = [Xd (0) Xd (1) ... Xd (Nd − 1)] .
(4)
The IFFT of the frequency domain data Xd is given by
xd (n) = 1

(5)
The time domain data xd (see Fig. 1) of the OFDM frame can
be represented in vector form as follows
xd = [xd (0) xd (1) ... xd (Nd − 1)]
(6)
where 0 ≤ k, n ≤ Nd − 1. A cyclic preﬁx xcp of length Ng is
introduced in front of time domain data xd. The value of the
Ng is L − 1, where L is the number of channel taps. xcp is
given by
xcp = [xd (Nd − Ng) ... xd (Nd − 1)] .
(7)
Let x0 to xM−1 are the preambles of the frame in the time
domain. Let the transmitted frame is given by (see Fig. 1)
x
=
[x0 .. xM−1 xcp xd]
=
[x(0) x(1) ... x(MN + Nd + Ng − 1)] .
(8)
Now, x is transmitted through the frequency selective channel.
The channel is assumed to be quasi static and it is ﬁxed for
one frame and varies independently from frame to frame. Its
impulse response for a given frame can be expressed as:
h = [h(0) h(1) h(2) ..... h(L − 1)]
(9)
where L is the number of channel taps. The received signal r
in the time domain is given by:
r (n) = y (n) ej2πnϵ/N + w (n)

EXISTING TIMING SYNCHRONIZATION METHODS
In this section we describe some of the existing data
(preamble) aided timing synchronization methods. In general,
the timing metric, which is used for OFDM timing synchro-
nization, is given by
G (d) = |T (d)|2
R2 (d) .
(13)
Some authors use another timing metric given by
G (d) = T (d)
R (d)
(14)
where T (d) is the correlation function, R (d) is the energy of
the received signal used for normalization, d is the index of
the correlation, where 0 ≤ d ≤ N − 1. The start of the frame
can be estimated by ﬁnding the peak of the timing metric (13)
or (14).

The advantages of the proposed method in (62) using one
preamble (M = 1) over the matched ﬁltering approach in (56)
are:
1)
Use of exponential term in (62) to compensate the
phase rotation caused by CFO. The phase rotation
caused by CFO destroys the correlation peak in match
ﬁltering operation given in (56).
2)
Averaging the cross correlation over the interval
[−I, I] improves the performance of the proposed
timing metric (62) in the presence of CFO.
A. Probability of erasure
If the estimated start of the frame ˆθt satisﬁes the condition
1 ≤ ˆθt ≤ L then the frame is processed further, otherwise
frame is discarded and considered as an erasure. Let F1 be
the total number of frames that is considered as erasure and
F2 be the total number of frames that is transmitted. The
Probability of erasure (PE) is given by
PE = F1
F2.

B. Mean square error
Let the number of detected frames be given by
F = F2 − F1.

where θtf is the time index corresponding to the maximum
absolute value of the channel impulse response for the f th
detected frame given by
θtf = arg max (abs (hf))
(66)
where hf is the channel impulse response for the f th detected
frame and ˆθtf is the estimated start of the f th detected frame.
C. Probability of correct estimation
Let F3 be the total number of frames for which ˆθt = θt,
then the probability of correct estimation P(ˆθt = θt) is given
by
P(ˆθt = θt) = F3

(67)
where θt is the time index corresponding to the maximum
absolute value of the channel impulse response for a given
frame, given by
θt = arg max (abs (h))

where h is the channel impulse response for a given frame
and ˆθt is the estimated start of that frame.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, the performance of the proposed method
is compared with the major existing timing synchronization
methods [28] [29] [30] [31] [32], which work independent of
the structure of the preamble. Matlab simulation is performed
for performance comparison. We have assumed N=64 and
performed the simulations over 5×105 frames. QPSK signaling
is assumed. A frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel is
assumed with L = 5 path taps and path delays µl = l for
l = 0, 1, ..., 4. The channel has an exponential power delay
proﬁle (PDP) with an average power of exp (−µl/L). The
CFO takes random value within the range [−I, I] and it varies
independently from frame to frame. For the methods presented
in [29] [30], we have considered all the available correlation
points without repetition, i.e., N(N − 1)/2=2016 and for the
method presented in [31], we have considered all the available

In order to compare with [28] [29] [30] [32], we consider
M=1 and to compare with [31], we consider M=2. Methods
proposed in [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] give satisfactory results
when the range of CFO is within ±0.5, i.e., I = 0.5, beyond
that the performance starts degrading. So, for performance
comparison, we consider the value of I is 0.5 another value
of I is considered as 32 for simulation because the whole
range of CFO of the OFDM system is within ±N/2, i.e.,
I = N/2 = 32.

in [28] [29] [30] [32] and the proposed method and two
randomly generated preambles (M=2) are used for the method
in [31] and the proposed method. Figs. 2, 4 and 6 show the
performance comparison considering I = 0.5. Figs. 3, 5 and 7
show the performance comparison considering I = N/2 = 32.
It is observed that there is a major performance degradation
of the methods proposed in [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] using
random preamble when the CFO increases (large value of I).
It is also observed that the proposed method performs better
than the existing methods in the presence of large range of
CFO. Note that in the presence of CFO (I ̸= 0) with M = 1
in the proposed method, there is a signiﬁcant improvement
in the performance as compared to method presented in [32].
It is also observed that the proposed method performs better
especially in high SNR per bit. Fig. 8 shows the probability of
erasure of the proposed estimator considering different values
of I (different range of CFO). It is observed that the proposed

method gives satisfactory result even when the range of CFO
increases.
In order to compare with the timing estimation methods
that depend on the speciﬁc structure of the preamble, Schmidl’s
preamble [5] is considered. In Figs. 9 to 14, probability of
erasure, probability of correct estimation and timing MSE of
the proposed method are compared with the major existing
timing synchronization methods using Schmidl’s preamble [5]
considering M = 1. Figs. 9, 11 and 13 show the performance
comparison with I = 0.5. Figs. 10, 12 and 14 show the
performance comparison with I = N/2 = 32. Like random
preamble case, it is also observed that there is a major
performance degradation of the methods proposed in [28] [29]
[30] [32] using Schmidl’s preamble when the CFO increases
(large value of I). Hence, from the simulation results (as shown
in Figs. 9 to 14), it is clear that the timing metrics proposed in
[28] [29] [30] [32] are affected by the CFO whereas the timing

metric propsed in [5] is not affected by the CFO. It is again
concluded that the proposed timing metric is more robust to
CFO as compared to methods in [28] [29] [30] [32].
In Figs. 15 to 22, probability of erasure and timing MSE
of the proposed method are compared with the major existing
timing synchronization methods using other preambles. In
Figs. 15 to 16, Minn’s preamble [9] is used with M = 1.
In Figs. 17 to 18, Park’s preamble [11] is used with M = 1.
In Figs. 19 to 20, Ren’s preamble [14] is used with M = 1.
In Figs. 21 to 22, Sajadi’s preamble [21] is used with M = 1.
We assume I = 32. From simulation results it is observed
that the proposed method gives better performance using other
preambles. Figs. 23 to 24 show the performance comparison
by using both Schmidl’s and Minn’s preamble with M = 2.
Figs. 25 to 26 show the performance comparison by using
both Park’s and Ren’s preamble with M = 2. We assume
I = 32. From Figs. 23 to 26, we ﬁnd that the proposed
method gives the best performance. In Table 1, computational

complexity of the proposed estimator along with existing esti-
mators are given. Computational complexity mainly consists
of complex calculations and real calculations. Most of the
preamble structure independent methods require both complex
and real calculations while the proposed method only require
complex calculations, which is high as compared to other
methods but the proposed method gives better performance.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, different data aided timing estimation meth-
ods are explained and compared. Both preamble structure
dependent as well as preamble structure independent timing
estimation methods are discussed. It is concluded that pream-
ble structure dependent timing estimation methods perform
better than preamble structure independent methods in the

presence of CFO. A new timing estimation method, which
is independent of the structure of the preamble, is proposed.
A timing estimation method using multiple preambles is also
proposed. The performance of the proposed method along with
existing methods are investigated in the presence of CFO.
Performance is investigated in the presence of different range
of CFO. It is observed that the proposed method is robust
to CFO. Computational complexity of different estimators
are also explained. It is observed that the proposed method
performs better than the existing methods in the presence of
CFO at the cost of increased computational complexity.
