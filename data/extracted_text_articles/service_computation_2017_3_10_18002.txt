Abstract— Applications provided in the Internet of Things can 
generally be divided into three categories: audio, video and 
data. This has given rise to the popular term Triple Play 
Services. The most important audio applications are Voice 
over IP (VoIP) and audio streaming. The most notable video 
applications are Video Telephony over IP (VToIP), Television 
over IP (IPTV), and video streaming, and the service World 
Wide Web (WWW) is the most prominent example of data-
type services. This paper elaborates on the most important 
techniques for measuring Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality 
of Experience (QoE) in Triple Play Services. 
Keywords-Triple Play Service; QoS; QoE; VoIP; IPTV. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Quality of Service (QoS) is of crucial importance to 
modern digital networks, not least in the Internet, which is 
increasingly going under the name Internet of Things (IoT). 
The term QoS is becoming a household phrase, and has long 
been anchored in the definition of Next-Generation 
Networks in ITU-T Standard Y.2001 [1]. The International 
Telecommunication Union defines QoE as "The overall 
acceptability of an application or service, as perceived 
subjectively by the end-user" [2]. In November 2009, the 
European Parliament and the European Commission adopted 
the so-called Communications Packet, their directives 
2009/136/EC [3] and 2009/140/EC [4] underlining the 
importance of QoS. Both QoS and QoE are to be monitored 
continually, and preferably automatically, in modern 
networks, and that means in the Internet of Things (IoT) too. 
EU research projects, such as Leone [5] and mPlane [6] and 
standardisation 
organisations, 
such 
as 
the 
Internet 
Engineering Task Force (IETF) [7], have been hard at work 
to achieve this. Monitoring the quality of service throughout 
the EU is, however, proving to be an especial challenge, 
given the dynamic structure of the Internet. New services are 
forever being introduced and older ones restructured. The 
IETF seeks to meet these challenges with the all-embracing 
Framework for Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband 
Performance (LMAP [7]) and, in keeping with the EU 
research project mPlane [6], promotes a flexible all-purpose 
solution. 
Whilst these frameworks do contain fundamental 
concepts and specifications for the diverse areas of a 
distributed measuring system, such as the exchange and 
storage of acquired measurement data, by no means are they 
intended as complete systems. First of all, the suitable 
measuring equipment, storage units and results analysis 
software of various providers must be pieced together. In 
keeping with the trend of shifting more and more services 
into the cloud [8], the individual components of big-data sys-
tems have been designed to work flexibly in the cloud. 
Alongside these large-scale, complex yet adaptable systems 
there is a demand for specific, complete quality-assessment 
solutions that are easy to implement and use. Existing 
systems for monitoring Triple Play Services might benefit 
from the new possibilities of cloud computing. Since cloud-
based solutions can usually be implemented without compli-
cated precommissioning at the user’s end, and the costs 
incurred through on-demand solutions are lower than long-
term investments, the entry threshold will fall, and the use of 
indispensable measuring technology will become more 
appealing. For, despite the unequivocal recommendations, 
continuous measurement of quality of service is still not a 
universal practice, owing to the lack of suitable QoS/QoE 
measurement techniques for measuring environments. 
Section II begins with an overview of QoS and QoE 
measurement techniques; then in Section III the QoS/QoE in 
the VoIP service will be described. Section IV provides 
information about QoS/QoE in the VToIP/IPTV service. 
Following that, Section V discusses QoS/QoE in the WWW 
service. The paper concludes with a summary and an outlook 
on future work. 
II. 
OVERVIEW OF QOS AND QOE MEASUREMENT 
TECHNIQUES 
In order to determine the QoS/QoE in a network, two 
models are generally used: a) dual-ended model and b) 
single-ended model; cf. Figure 1 [9]. In the case of the dual-
ended model, two signals are used: a) the original signal and 
b) the degraded signal. These two signals are available 
uncompressed. For this reason, measurements can be carried 
out for both Quality of Experience (a subjective evaluation) 
and Quality of Service (an objective evaluation). In the case 
of the single-ended model, only the impaired signal (com-
pressed) is available. This allows only an objective 
evaluation of QoS to be made. QoS measurement is referred 
to as “intrusive measurement” (offline) in the case of the 
28

dual-ended model, and as “non-intrusive measurement” 
(online) in the case of the single-ended model. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Overview of QoS and QoE measurement techniques. 
Two measurement techniques can be used in the two 
models cited: a) signal-based and b) parameter-based 
measurement. The dual-ended model uses specialised 
algorithms to compare the input and output signals of signal-
based measurements. In the case of the single-ended model, 
this comparison is made by using a reference signal. In both 
cases, the system to be assessed is treated as a “black box”. 
When carrying out parameter-based measurements, a 
distinction is made between two types: a) “glass-box” and b) 
“black-box”. In the first case, both the structure of the system 
to be assessed and the reaction of the individual system 
components to the reference signal are known. This 
knowledge is then taken into consideration in a suitable 
model. Additionally, the network parameters measured can 
be included in the calculation of the QoS. In the second case, 
not all details of the system to be assessed are known, so 
only the network parameters measured and the characteristic 
parameters for the respective service are taken into account. 
The paper and the oral presentation at the Conference 
will review and discuss the application of common QoS/QoE 
measuring 
methods 
to 
Triple 
Play 
Services 
(audio/video/data).  
III. 
QOS/QOE IN THE VOIP SERVICE 
Figure 2 represents current QoS/QoE measurement 
techniques for the VoIP service. It is noticeable that several 
international standards touch on this area. The signal-based 
QoE measurement techniques PESQ [10] and POLQA [11] 
are very accurate; they are, however, time-consuming and 
can often only be implemented with a licence. That is why 
parameter-based QoS measuring methods are usually 
preferred in practice. The E Model [12], which was 
originally 
developed 
for 
circuit-switched 
telephone 
networks, has recently been adapted for use in IP networks to 
produce the modified E(IP) Model, released as a patent [13] 
in 2014.

VoIP service. 
The modification in the E(IP) Model represents a 
restructuring of the two parameters Ie (Equipment 
Impairment Factor) and Blp (Packet-Loss Robustness Factor) 
to take account of impairment factors on the IP transport 
platform. 
IV. 
QOS/QOE IN THE VTOIP/IPTV SERVICE 
Figure 3 shows established methods for measuring the 
QoS/QoE of the video component of the VToIP/IPTV 
service.  
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Overview of QoS and QoE measurement techniques for the 
VToIP/IPTV service. 
Alongside several signal-based international standards 
there are also a few parametrised measurement techniques 
that work without a reference signal, not the least of these 
being the parametrised VSoIP Model [14], that is to be 
classified as a dual-ended model. Its make-up and mode of 
operation correspond to those of the E(IP) Model for the 
speech service. The parametrised QoS models are quick and 
easy to use, which is of great benefit in practice. In contrast, 
it takes minutes to measure the QoE of a HD video file 
using, say, the PEVQ [15] and the J.341 [16] method. 
Besides, they belong to the group of active (intrusive) 
methods of measuring QoE, which means that a connection

must first be established in an IP environment, and a 
reference signal must be sent and mirrored at the receiver’s 
end. That is very time-consuming. 
V. 
QOS/QOE IN THE WWW SERVICE 
Figure 4 shows the most widely known techniques 
currently used to measure QoS/QoE in the WWW service. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  Overview of QoS and QoE measurement techniques for the 
WWW service. 
It is immediately clear that there is only one standardised 
technique for measuring QoE in the WWW service: G.1030 
[17]. There are two other QoS techniques in the single-ended 
model — Apdex Index [18] and Power Metric [19] — but 
they have not been standardised, meaning that there is an 
enormous need for further developments in this area, 
especially in view of the fact that the WWW service is one of 
the most widely used applications in the modern Internet of 
Things and accounts for the lion's share of traffic. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper has reviewed and discussed briefly the 
application of common QoS/QoE measuring methods in 
Triple Play Services (audio/video/data). The strengths and 
weakness 
of 
the 
individual 
QoS/QoE 
measurement 
techniques have been spelt out. In practice it is highly 
beneficial to work with parametrised QoS models. 
In the course of the related presentation in the track 
SERVQUAL [20], it will be demonstrated how the QoS 
measuring techniques that were described in the previous 
section are applied to the Triple Play Services. The results 
that were obtained from multiple series of QoS tests are 
presented in the form of graphs and then interpreted.  
To summarise: a great deal of development work and 
practical implementation remain to be done in the field of 
QoS/QoE. 
New 
scientific 
concepts 
for 
QoS/QoE 
measurement techniques and systems are needed. Designers 
and engineers are faced with a mighty challenge!
