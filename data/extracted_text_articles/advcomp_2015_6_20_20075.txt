Abstract—In this paper we design a Supervisory Control 
and Data Acquisition system, which includes newly 
designed feeding device, programmable logic controller, 
a graphical human machine interface programmed with 
Visual Basic, plus, the Internet communication module. 
By using our system, the users only need a computer or a 
hand-held device that can connect to the Internet to 
achieve the goal of remote controlling and monitoring 
the feeding device.

 INTRODUCTION 
According to Taiwan Taipei Rabbit Society Associations 
statistics, the number of people who keep a rabbit is up to 
420,000 in 2010 in Taiwan [1]. The ranking of the most 
popular pets are led by dogs followed by cats and rabbits at 
the third place. The number of rabbit owners has increased 
rapidly around the world in the last few years. Since 2005, 
people begin to celebrate the “Worldwide Rabbit Love and 
Appreciation Day” in August [2]. However, Taipei Rabbit 
Society Associations warns whomever keeps a rabbit, need 
to take good care of it, since they are not as strong as cats or 
dogs.  
Based on the statistics, the quantity of rabbits dying from 
abandoning and bad care is up to 17,000 per year. That is to 
say, nearly 67 percent of total death is caused by  
misconception [1]. Most of the abandoned rabbits die of 
heart paralysis or shock, due to their timid nature. However, 
holding a rabbit as a pet is not too difficult, since they only 
need to be fed twice a day. This also includes the supply 
with a sufficient amount of water. The purpose of the 
automatic feeder we proposed in this paper is to support 
people to maintain the basic needs of their pet.  
The remote control and monitor system of this feeder 
is established by using Internet, Global System for Mobile 
Communication (GSM) and integrated Programmable Logic 
Controller (PLC). The whole system contains two parts, a 
remote control subsystem and a supervisory subsystem. 
Within the GSM covering range, complex logical actions 
can be controlled, instead of just operating an electrical 
switch. 
In our study, a traditional PLC is used to control the 
hardware, and a simple Supervisory Control and Data 
Acquisition (SCADA) application software which can be 
used on mobile device and PC. Eventually, with the four 
wireless data transmission’s major systems (Wideband Code 
Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) [8], Code Division 
Multiple Access (CDMA) [9], General Packet Radio 
Service (GPRS) [10] and Personal Handy-phone System 
(PHS) [11]) cooperating and taking action, will turn the 
network transmit protocol (TCP/IP) into wireless operation. 
We will introduce the hardware we use in Section 2 and the 
prototype machine in Section 3. 
II. 
MATERIALS 
A. PLC 
PLC is an electronic device with digital movement, its 
hardware design can be basically divided into two kinds, 
medium-large sized and miniature sized. Instead of 
mechanical equipment, the control function is reached by 
using integrated circuits and digital and analogy I\O 
modules [3]. PLC possesses order, timing, counting, 
computing, data process and communication, etc. The 
commands are stored in EPROMs. With the scientific and 
technological progress, the enhancement of CPU and single 
chip function, also improve PLC’s abilities, functions and 
attachments can be offered by it thereupon increase.

1) Mitsubishi’s PLC Communication Protacal 
 
The PLC device we chose is one of the Mitsubishi 
FX2N series which is shown in Figure 1. It is built as a 
master-slave-system. The PLC device is the slave, other 
device connected to the PLC is the master, for instance, the 
server that receive command from the client. In a master-
slave-system the master sends commands to the slave 
systems. These slaves only send feedbacks only if receiving 
a request from the master. Hence data collisions are avoided. 
PLC device set up link through RS232, and PLC’s Wi-Fi 
attachment, so we can let users control and manage the 
system in a browser or software by using a personal 
computer or mobile device. All functions can be controlled 
remotely like set up, daily arrange, food fall/stop, etc. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Fatek’s PLC communication message format 
2) Mitsubishi’s PLC Communication Message Format 
For possible kinds of messages, commands or 
feedbacks, the message can be split into 5 - 7 fields due to 
its command. All of these fields uses ASCII 16 bit code. In 
all cases the beginning letter is STX (02H). Field CMD are 
used to classify the command type (Table 1.), for example 
read/write, forced ON/OFF, etc. After asking data from 
Y0~Y7 (0A-00) and Y10~Y17(0A-01), which is shown in 
Figure 6. The slave system will pass the message back along 
with the data to the master system as shown in Figure 7.

The Device address is divided into two fields, and need to 
be read from the back, for example, Figure 10 is a command 
of forcing node Y1 (0501) to turn on, so the device address 
will be 0105. If the command is asking for data writing the 
fifth field will be the data that needs to be written, as shown 
in Figure 9, which is trying to write a value 3586. Next to it 
is the end-message code ETX (03H), let the system know 
the where the command ended. The last field SUM CHEK = 
CMD + DEVICE ADDRESS + BYTES + ETX, and only 
use 
the 
last 
two 
words, 
for 
example 
30H+30H+30H+41H+30H+30H+32H+03H=’166’H, so the 
check sum will be ‘66’H. For writing and force function 
command, the PLC will answer YES (06H) or NO (15H). 
 
B. Stepper Motor And Motor Driver 
Stepper motor is divided by the steps they need to 
complete a full rotation. The motor we use is a simplest 
two-phase stepper motor, it rotates 1.8 degree (±5%) every 
step. So, there will be 360/1.8 = 200 steps per full rotation. 
That is why the motor can finish simple but high accurate 
rotate/stop positioning. Advantages of stepper motors are 
low cost, high reliability, high torque at low speeds and a 
simple, rugged construction that operates in almost any 
environment. 
After triggered by users, PLC will send the operate 
command with demanded motor speed and rotate quantity to 
the motor driver. The driver will converts the PLC 
command signals into electric pulse, which is provided by 
external power source, to energize the motor windings. The 
stepper motor then converts digital pulses into mechanical 
shaft rotation.

METHOD 
A. Prototype Machine 
The prototype machine is consists of PLC, motor 
driver, stepper motor, 50W external power source and 
home-made feeder shell. The PLC will send the signal to 
motor driver, the driver will then control the stepper motor 
to rotate the component which is attach on it. After stepping 
a few times, the pet food will fall into the bowl. The 
quantity of the food can be controlled by counting the 
motor’s steps or timing the rotation. 
Considering rabbits chewing habit, especially when 
they are hungry and it contains tempting smell of the food 
inside, the material of feeder’s shell should avoid using 
plastic or anything that they should not been eating, so we 
decided to use wood. For the function of regular feeding,

PLC’s timer can easily finish the job, and for the quantity 
control, it is mentioned before. Beside our first prototype 
machine, we are considering using graphical user interface 
attachment for the ease of use. Therefore, after finishing our 
first prototype machine, we will take user survey into 
account and add new attachments in the future work. 
B. Combining Network 
For a typical industrial control system, the network 
fieldbus should be able to transmit real-time control 
messages 
and 
non-real-time 
maintenance 
messages. 
Nowadays, with the advantages of IEEE 802.15.4 standard’s 
diversified network architectures, high reliability [5] and the 
advancement of wireless technology, a wireless network can 
be integrated into an existing fieldbus system. Due to this 
development, there are improvements in terms of mobility 
and flexibility and consequently in the ability to support 
applications [6] [7]. 
Moreover, considering the requirement of remote control, 
besides using normal RJ45 to connect self-home network 
station, we use Wi-Fi attachment (Figure 4) to control and 
monitor PLC from PC without virtual line. Other like WSN 
(Wireless Sensor Network) [4], can also achieve the same 
goal. 
 
Figure 4.  PLC Wi-Fi attachments (upper one for PLC, other one for PC) 
C. System Working Process 
The working process of our device is shown in Figure 5. 
After complete the start-up diagnose, users can connect to 
the system through virtual IP address, which is provided by 
the Wi-Fi attachment, to monitor and control. When the 
commands are sent, user-side will be waiting for the system 
to reply. Meanwhile, if the connection is good, the system 
will start process the command and send back a message 
whether it is success or not. After comparing the Checksum, 
the message will be displayed on user’s device. Otherwise, 
the system will report error or timeout. 
 
Figure 5.  PLC’s working process 
D. Webpage Graphical Human Machine Interface 
Graphical Human Machine Interface focus on using 
words, numbers, and pictures to transmit or reveal the 
relevant joint state and the value in data register. To control 
the device from far side, the simplest way is to write a 
server end program, then through a third-party software to 
achieve remote controlling, but people will need to pay for 
the software. With the advance of mobile devices and the 
wireless data transmission, a simple webpage or software 
can achieve the same goal, also, the computers have various 
types of browsers, it is much far more convenient than using 
other commercial software. To browse from web, 
programmers must build a server station which can connects 
to the Wi-Fi attachment first, it can control and process all 
PLC required function in the server, then sent the data back 
and shown in the webpage.  
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORKS 
In this paper, we have finished the build of our first 
prototype, the basic mechanism device. And our future 
work is to achieve the goals we mentioned earlier. We plan 
to find volunteered users to test the system’s practicability 
and ease of use in our future work for system improvement. 
The final goal is to combine it with normal feeder and grass 
feeder. Once the system has been developed, it will be 
possible to lower the rate of pet abandoning and increase pet 
owners’ willingness to actively take care of their new 
friends by knowing that : “Pets are our friends, not burdens”.  
After it’s finished, we hope our research provides a good 
inspiration and make our idea fit for any other pets. If this 
idea can spread, by lowering the manufacture cost, every 
pet owners can enjoy the convenience of our system.
