Abstract—This paper proposes a new flying gauge change 
(FGC) scheme for a continuous cold strip mill to achieve 
thickness reduction in a specified section including a welding 
point. Because this section is often processed as scrap, 
thickness reduction is desired as a means of reducing scrap 
weight. However, this is not possible with conventional FGC, 
which considers only one thickness change point, because two 
thickness change points exist simultaneously in the mill due to 
the short length of the specified section. The proposed scheme 
utilizes the transition pattern of the position of the two 
thickness change points during FGC to calculate the set values 
of the roll gap and roll speed. Thickness reduction is achieved 
by applying these set values to the rolling mill according to the 
tracking signals of the two thickness change points. The 
validity of the proposed method was verified by simulation and 
experiments. Application of this technology has improved cold 
strip yield.

 INTRODUCTION 
In a continuous cold strip mill, as shown in Figure 1, a 
coil is uncoiled by the pay-off reel, and its lead end is welded 
to the tail end of the preceding strip. Here, the two strips 
differ in hardness and dimensions, such as thickness and 
width, and the specified thickness after rolling also differs. 
Hence, the rolling mill must change the thickness of the strip 
at the welding point. After rolling, the strips are cut at the 
welds and coiled separately by the tension reel. Flying Gauge 
Change (FGC) was developed in order to achieve the 
necessary thickness change [1][2][3]. Although the most 
important issue in FGC is obviously thickness accuracy, it is 
also necessary to minimize strip tension deviations in order 
to prevent rolling trouble such as strip breakage. In 
Yamashita et al. [1], the responses of the actuators, which 
consist of the roll gap and roll speed, are synchronized 
during FGC, thereby minimizing strip tension deviations. In 
[2], the set values of the roll gap and speed are also 
synchronized. Furthermore, a dynamic setup model based on 
the measured value of strip thickness is proposed to 
compensate for setup model error. Hol et al. [3] explicitly 
introduces strip tension and thickness to the controller 
objective function and directly optimizes the time-domain 
response, and the inherent variation of the forward slip and 
friction conditions is mentioned. 
On the other hand, a specified section including a 
welding point is often processed as scrap due to the 
mechanical properties of the strip or constraints of the 
downstream manufacturing processes. Therefore, as shown 
in Figure 2, thickness reduction in that section is desired as a 
means of reducing scrap weight, and thereby, improving 
yield. FGC must be applied in order to achieve this thickness 
reduction in a cold rolling mill. However, thickness 
reduction is not possible with the conventional FGC method, 
which considers only one thickness change point, because 
two thickness change points exist simultaneously in the mill 
due to the short length of the specified section. Figure 3 
shows this situation. 
This paper presents a new FGC method which makes it 
possible to achieve the prescribed two thickness changes. To 
simplify the problem, the size and hardness of the welded 
preceding and succeeding strips are the same. While this 
situation often occurs in actual operation, this can also be 
eliminated by a few modifications to the technology 
presented in this paper.

In these models, rolling force and forward slip can be 
calculated according to the models in [4][5]. The strip 
tension between the th
i  stand and 
th
i
+1
 stand is represented 
as (1). This model means that strip tension fluctuates when 
the velocity of the entry strip at the 
th
i
+1
stand differs from 
that of the exit strip at the  th
i
 stand. This is an important 
characteristic for FGC. In the thickness model shown in (2), 
thickness is determined by the roll gap 
iS  and elastic 
deformation of a work roll, which is represented as 
i Mi
P /
. 
The actuators of the mill are electric motors and hydraulic 
cylinders. The former are for controlling the roll speed, and 
the latter for controlling the roll gap position. These actuators 
can be modeled as first order transfer functions like (3) and 
(4). The transport time delay is variable, depending on the 
strip velocity, and is modeled as (5). The conservation law of 
mass flow is described as (6).

B. Conventional FGC method 
The conventional FGC method is explained here. Figure 
4 shows an example of the time chart of the action of the 
actuators during FGC. The roll gap is being closed when the 
thickness change point passes each of the stands. On the 
other hand, the roll speed of the th
i
 stand does not decrease 
when the point passes the th
i  stand, but decreases when the 
point passes the 
th
i
+1
 stand. The reason for this can be 
explained by (1) and (6). From (6), we obtain

Because

 becomes smaller by closing the roll gap, 
iV +1
 in (7) also becomes smaller. To minimize the deviation 
of strip tension,

 is required from (1). For this, it is 
necessary to decrease the speed of the 
ith
stand. 
Synchronization of the responses of the roll gap and speed to 
minimize the imbalance of the mass flow during the 
transition period is described in [1]. 
In order to calculate the strip velocity during FGC, 
information on the thickness and initial strip velocity are 
required. The reference thickness after FGC is determined by 
the setup calculation of the mill, and the initial strip velocity 
is usually estimated by

(
VRi fi +
. Finally, the roll speed 
during FGC is calculated by using the prescribed strip 
velocity and forward slip after FGC based on the forward 
slip model. The roll gap is calculated by (2).

FGC is achieved by applying these set values to the 
rolling mill according to the tracking signal of the thickness 
change point. This situation is shown in Figure 5. The above 
is the outline of the conventional method. 
III. 
THICKNESS REDUCTION CONTROLLER DESIGN 
The thickness reduction controller design is presented in 
this section. The proposed method consists of three steps. 
The 1st step is to classify the transition pattern of the position 
of the two thickness change points during the FGC. The 2nd 
step is to calculate the set values of the roll gap and the roll 
speed based on the results of the 1st step. The 3rd step is to 
apply these set values to the rolling mill according to the 
tracking signals of the two thickness change points. 
A. Classification of the transition pattern 
The volume of the specified section between two 
thickness change points is invariant. Based on this fact, the 
transition pattern of the position of the two thickness points 
can be classified under several cases. Here, A  denotes the 
first thickness change point, B  denotes the second thickness 
change point, M  is the volume of the specified section and 
ihII
 is the reference of the exit thickness of the th
i  stand of 
the specified section. 
Let us consider the pattern shown in Figure 6. Firstly, A  
exists between No. 1 stand and No. 2 stand in state-1. Then, 
A  moves to between No. 2 stand and No. 3 stand in the 
following state-2. Because M  is larger than 
hII × L
1
, B  
cannot enter between No. 1 stand and No. 2 stand at that time. 
In the following state-3, B  enters between No. 1 stand and 
No. 2 stand because M  is smaller than 
L

(

State-4 shows that A  moves to between No. 3 stand and No. 
4 stand. The reason for this is explained as follows: When 
state-1 exists, the inequality 
M

 is 
obtained. Thus, B  cannot enter between No. 2 stand and No. 
3 stand in this state. In the following state-5, B  enters 
between No. 2 stand and No. 3 stand since M  is smaller 
than 
L
h

(

. The following state-6, state-7, and state-
8 are obvious. Thus, the transition pattern is classified based 
on the volume of the specified section. 
A summary of the transition pattern is shown in Figure 7. 
The transition pattern is classified under four cases. The 
subscripts to A  and B  indicate that the thickness change 
point passes the stand indicated by the numbers.

B. Calculation of the set values of the roll gaps and the 
roll speed 
The set values of the roll gap and the roll speed must be 
changed to achieve thickness reduction when the thickness 
change points pass each stand. As is described in Section II, 
the roll gap can be obtained by (1) and the roll speed can be 
calculated from the thickness information and the forward 
slip and initial roll speed. Classification of the pattern is 
performed in order to obtain the thickness information when 
the thickness change points pass each stand.  
An example of a state for roll speed calculation is shown 
in Figure 8. Here, 
I
ih denotes the initial exit thickness of the 
ith
 stand and 
ihII
 means the reduced exit thickness of the 
ith
 stand. The roll speed of the final stand, described as 
I
R
V 4 , 
is fixed. The variables,

*
VR2
and 
*
VR3
 must be calculated. 
if I
 is the forward slip of the th
i
 stand in the initial rolling 
condition, and 
if II
 is the forward slip of the th
i
 stand in the 
reduced thickness rolling condition. The calculation is 
executed as follows.

C. Applying the set values to the mill 
Thickness reduction is achieved by applying the set 
values to the rolling mill according to the tracking signals of 
the two thickness change points. The control system is 
shown in Figure 9. The state can be judged by the tracking 
signals, and the appropriate set values are selected. The set 
values are then sent to the mill controller, and the roll gap 
and roll speed are controlled.

SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTS 
The results of a simulation and experiments are presented 
here. In the chart graph of the simulation and experiments, 
the value on the vertical axis is normalized by the initial 
value, which is the value before applying thickness reduction 
control. 
A. Simulation 
Figures 10 and 11 show the actions of the roll gap and 
roll speed, respectively. In Figure 10, the roll gap is being 
closed when the first thickness change point passes each 
stand, and it is being opened when the second thickness 
change point passes each stand. Thus, the action of the roll 
gap is simple and the existence of the two thickness change 
points in the mill is confirmed by the graph. The action of 
the roll speed, especially at No. 1 stand in Figure 11, is 
somewhat complex. It was found that the effect of the two 
thickness change points appears in the upstream stand speed. 
The strip tension will deviate unless the roll speed is set 
appropriately. 
Figure 12 shows the strip tension deviations. In order to 
maintain unit tension, which is the tension per cross sectional 
area of the strip, the set value of tension is decreased. Strip 
deviation is within 20% in this graph. In actual operation, 
strip tension deviation within 30% is desired in order to 
prevent rolling trouble. Hence, this method achieves tension 
deviation within the reference value. 
Figure 13 is a thickness chart. A thickness reduction of 
nearly 50% is achieved by using the proposed method. 
Thus, these simulation results verify the validity of the 
proposed method from the viewpoints of thickness and strip 
tension deviations. 
B. Experimental results 
The experimental results are shown in Figure 14 and 
Figure 15. In this control method, the reference of thickness 
reduction is 11% compared to the thickness before 
application. Strip tension deviation within 10% was obtained 
in this experiment. Hence, this method satisfies the condition 
for actual operation. Thickness fluctuated at the welding 
point at 19 [sec] due to the difference of the deformation 
resistance of the welded strips.

However, in total, thickness accuracy is controlled to 
within 1%, demonstrating accurate thickness control. Thus, 
the validity of this method was also verified experimentally.

CONCLUSIONS 
In a continuous cold strip mill, a specified section 
including a welding point is often processed as scrap. In 
order to reduce scrap weight and improve product yield, 
reduction of the thickness of this section is desired. 
A new FGC method which achieves two thickness 
changes is proposed in this paper. The proposed method 
classifies the transition pattern of the two thickness change 
points in the mill and calculates the set values of the roll gap 
and the roll speed, thereby simultaneously achieving the 
desired thickness reduction and reducing tension deviations. 
In a simulation, a thickness reduction of nearly 50% and 
strip deviation within 20% were obtained. Experimental 
results also showed that thickness reduction and low tension 
deviation are achieved by this FGC method. 
Thus, the validity of the proposed method was verified 
by both simulation and experiments. Application of this 
technology has resulted in improved cold strip yield.
