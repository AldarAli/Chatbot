Abstract— Laser acupuncture is a modality of low-level 
light therapy used as an alternative to needling for the 
past three decades. The ST36 (Zusanli) acupoint is used 
to 
treat 
inflammatory 
processes, 
pain 
and 
gastrointestinal disturbs. For this reason, the aim of the 
present study was to evaluate the antinociceptive effect 
of Laser acupuncture (830 nm, 3 J/cm2) on ST36 
acupoint model of acute nociception. To contribute to 
this understanding was investigated the involvement of 
adrenergic 
and 
adenosinergic 
systems 
in 
the 
antinociceptive effect of ST36 acupoint stimulation in 
mice model of acute nociception induced by glutamate 
(20 µmol per paw). Our results demonstrate that ST36 
laser acupuncture inhibited the glutamate-induced 
nociceptive 
behavior 
in 
44%. 
Moreover, 
the 
antinociceptive activity of laser irradiation in the 
glutamate test was significantly reversed by pre-
treatment of yohimbine (0.15 mg/kg, i.p.) and caffeine (3 
mg/kg, i.p.) but not by prazosin (0.15 mg/kg, i.p). 
Collectively, these results demonstrated that ST36 
photonic stimulus showed antinociceptive effect in acute 
model of nociception in mice, and that this effect is 
mediated by activation of the α2 adrenergic and 
adenosinergic systems.

 INTRODUCTION  
Laser acupuncture is a type of low-level laser therapy 
(LLLT) and consists of a non-invasive stimulation of the 
traditional acupuncture points. Its clinical application is 
becoming widespread being used to treat pain and 
inflammation, especially with regard to the control of 
chronic pain states, avoiding the use of analgesics and anti-
inflammatory (NSAIDs) [1-2]. This form of phototherapy 
has been shown to modulate various biological processes 
and may be used as a supplementary or alternative treatment 
of several symptoms [3]. The ST36 (Zusanli) acupoint has 
been used to treat inflammatory processes, pain and 
gastrointestinal disturbs [4]. Previous pre-clinical data 
showed that ST36 stimulation with LLLT, during 2, 6 and 
10 min, inhibited the nociception induced by formalin in 
mice [5]. Besides, a clinical study with LLLT set to 830 nm 
and 30 mW, applied on ST36 and IG4 acupoints in children 
reduced the migraine [6]. However, there are few evidences 
about its efficacy and mechanisms of action. For this reason, 
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
antinociceptive effect of LLLT on ST36 acupoint and its 
mechanism of action using models of acute nociception in 
mice. Although the work is in a preliminary phase, several 
conclusions can be longer designed specially involving the 
mechanisms of action of LLLT. The paper was divided into 
four parts: (I) Introduction, in which we present the 
scientific fundaments involved in the antinociceptive effect 
of Laser acupuncture  and the goal of the experimental study 
proposed  (II) Material and methods performed on this 
research, as well as the main experimental models involved; 
(III) Results related to the application of the experimental 
protocols and discussion about the main results; (IV) 
Conclusion, where we highlight the most important findings 
of the developed study. 
II. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
A. Animals 
 
Experiments were conducted using female Swiss mice 
(25–35 g), housed at 22 ± 2 °C under a 12/12 h light/dark 
cycle (lights on at 06:00 h) and with free access to food and 
water. All experimental protocols were performed after 
approved by the Committee of Animal Experimentation of 
the Federal University of Paraná (CEUA/BIO - UFPR, 
protocol 514) and were carried out in accordance with the 
ethical guidelines for investigations of experimental pain in 
conscious animals [7]. The number of animals and 
intensities of noxious stimuli set were the minimum value 
necessary to demonstrate the consistent effects of the 
treatment. 
 
B. LLLT treatment procedures 
 
For the experiments, a low-intensity AsGaAI laser 
equipment was used. Its main parameters were: wavelenght 
of 830 nm (in continuous-mode), fluence of 3 J/cm², power 
of 30 mW, irradiation area reached 6 mm², duration of 6 s 
on the acupoint. The animals were randomly divided in 
three groups (n=8): (1) Control group, which was not

treated; (2) Laser group, which was treated with unilateral 
ST36 laser acupuncture; and (3) Off group, in which laser 
device was turned off but holding the probe in contact with 
ST36 acupoint. ST36 (Zusanli) acupoint is located between 
the tibia and the fibula, approximately 5 mm lateral to the 
anterior tubercle of the tibia [8]. 
 
C.. Nociception induced by glutamate 
 
The procedure used was similar to that described 
previously [9]. A volume of 20µl of glutamate (20 mol per 
paw) prepared in isotonic saline solution, with pH adjusted 
to 7.4 by the addition of NaOH, according to Meotti et al. 
(2006) [10], was injected intraplantarly (i.pl.) in the ventral 
surface of the right hindpaw. Animals were observed 
individually for 15 min following glutamate injection. The 
amount of time they spent licking the injected paw was 
recorded with a chronometer and considered as indicative of 
nociception as Fig. 1. Animals were treated with unilateral 
ST36 laser acupuncture 30 min before glutamate injection. 
 
D. Involvement of 1-adrenergic system 
 
To investigate the participation of the 1-adrenergic 
system in the antinociceptive effect of ST36 laser 
acupuncture, mice were pre-treated with prazosin (0.15 
mg/kg, i.p, a nonselective 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) 
30 min before application of unilateral ST36 laser 
acupuncture, phenylephrine (10 mg/kg, i.p., 1-adrenergic 
receptor agonist) or vehicle (0.1 ml/10 g, i.p.). Another 
group of mice was pre-treated with vehicle and after 30 min, 
received unilateral ST36 laser acupuncture, phenylephrine 
or vehicle, 30 min before the glutamate injection. The 
nociceptive response was evaluated as previously reported. 
 
E. Involvement of 2-adrenergic system 
 
To assess the possible participation of the 2-adrenergic 
system, mice were pretreated with yohimbine (0.15 mg/kg, 
i.p, a nonselective 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) 30 min 
before application of unilateral ST36 laser acupuncture, 
clonidine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p., 2-adrenergic receptor agonist) or 
vehicle (0.1 ml/10 g, i.p.). Another group of mice was pre-
treated with vehicle and after 30 min, received unilateral 
ST36 laser acupuncture, clonidine or vehicle, 30 min before 
the glutamate injection. The nociceptive response was 
evaluated as previously reported. 
 
F. Involvement of adenosinergic system 
 
To investigate the involvement of adenosinergic system 
in the antinociception caused by ST36 laser acupuncture, 
mice were pre-treated with caffeine (3 mg/kg, i.p., a 
nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist) 30 min before 
application of unilateral ST36 laser acupuncture or vehicle  
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. (A) Application intraplantar (ipl.) the glutamate in ventral surface 
of the right hind paw and (B)  observation in the mice glutamate injection. 
 
(0.1 ml/10 g, i.p.). After 30 min, the nociceptive response to 
the glutamate intraplantar injection was recorded as 
previously reported. 
 
G. Statistical analyses 
 
Data are presented as means ± standard error of the 
mean (S.E.M.). Comparisons between experimental and 
control groups were performed by one-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman Keul’s test when 
appropriate. P values less than 0.05 were considered as 
indicative of significance.  
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The results presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that ST36 
laser 
acupuncture 
significantly 
inhibited 
nociception 
induced by glutamate in mice, with inhibition values of 
44%. The treatment with laser device turned off was not 
able to reduce nociception induced by glutamate injection 
when compared with control group. 
In order to identify mechanisms by which it promotes its 
antinociceptive 
acupoint, 
alpha-adrenergic 
and 
adenosinergic systems were tested using pre-treatments 
antagonists of such systems, to evaluate whether some of 
them would modified the results found in the model of 
nociception induced by glutamate. 
Involved with antinociception, α-adrenergic pathways 
descendants are recruited from stimuli in brain structures 
such as Periaqueductal Gray substance (PAG) [11]. The 
antinociceptive properties of agonists of α2-adrenergic 
receptors modulation reflect the influence of excitatory 
neurons in primary afferents projection [10]. Evidence also 
suggests that α1-adrenergic receptors modulate nociceptive 
processing in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord [11]. 
The 
involvement of 
adrenergic 
system 
on 
the 
antinociceptive action of Laser was demonstrated through 
the pre-treatment of animals with the non-selective 
adrenergic receptor. 
Next, the involvement of the α1 and α2 adrenergic 
systems on ST36 laser acupuncture was investigated.

Results presented in Fig. 3A show that prazosin pre-
treatment completely reverted the antinociceptive effect of  
both  phenylefrina and the effect antinociceptive of ST36 
laser irradiation was not reverted that prazosin  group in the 
glutamate test. 
Although the results in Fig. 3B show the effect 
antinociceptive of ST36 laser irradiation was reverted that 
Yomhibine. Using bee venom injection in acupoint CV12 
(Zhongwan), 
Kwon 
and 
colleagues 
(2001) 
[12] 
demonstrated the involvement of this receptor α2-adrenergic 
antinociception. Park et. al. (2012) [13] observed that α2-
adrenoceptor antagonist and β-adrenoceptor antagonist 
inhibited the analgesic effect of eletroacupuncture (EA) on 
the inflammatory pain in a rat model of collagen-induced 
arthritis, but α1-adrenoceptor did not inhibit the analgesic 
effect of EA, as in our results [13]. 
Despite being an ancient technique in the east, 
acupuncture is still a relatively recent scientific study in the 
west. In fact, there are few studies showing the mechanisms 
of action and the difference among acupoints in the 
scientific literature. Another important factor to evaluate is 
the technique used, since most of the researches employs 
electroacupuncture, while few of them use photonic 
stimulation (known as laserpuncture). 
Laser light is a good alternative to metal needles for 
stimulation of acupuncture points, and it has been used 
successfully for several decades. However, there are only 
few studies proving the effectiveness of this kind of 
acupuncture. Most publications focus on red or infrared 
laser stimulation, and there are several relevant studies [14–
17]. 
The systemic pre-treatment of mice with caffeine in Fig. 4 
did significantly reverse the antinociception caused by Laser 
and against  glutamate induced nociception. The findings of 
Goldman et al. (2010) [18] indicate that adenosine is central 
to the mechanical actions of acupuncture, as the results 
demonstrated in our experiments in laser acupuncture.

comparing to control group; ##p<0.01 and #p<0.05 when comparing

followed by Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test). 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
LLLT, one of the most recent and promising treatment 
therapies in the acupuncture, has been shown to reduce to 
relieve pain significantly. In summary, the present study 
demonstrated that stimulation of the acupoint E36 shows 
antinociceptive activity in nociception model with glutamate 
and that this action seems to be involved in the activation of 
α2 adrenergic and adenosinergic systems.
