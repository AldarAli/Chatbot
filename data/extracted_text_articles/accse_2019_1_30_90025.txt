Abstract—This work aims to develop a system capable of
aligning
different
Information
and
Communication
Technology
(ICT)
training
programs
(degrees,
masters,
courses, etc.) with the main European competence frameworks
that are beginning to be implemented in Europe and the rest of
the world. This alignment will be carried out through
competence maps, which directly relate the contents taught in
each training program with the competences included in the
European standards.
Keywords- training; competence; European; framework.

INTRODUCTION
It is a fact that today's education systems must be
modernized to ensure that young people have the right skills
and are prepared for the jobs of the digital economy.
Employers need access to more accurate and up-to-date
information on skills and qualifications to better manage
their workforce, and employment services should incorporate
digital technologies to more efficiently assign job-seekers
with job vacancies and improve their job opportunities. This
is particularly important in a context of digital skills gaps,
which
are
both
a
barrier
to
people's
employment
opportunities and a risk to economic growth. Despite the
high levels of unemployment in Europe, especially among
young people, 40% of employers do not find people with the
right skills to fill their vacancies [1]. Guaranteeing a fair
labor market and allowing citizens to adapt to the changes of
an increasingly digital world are key priorities of the
European Commission (EC), as established in the European
Pillar of Social Rights [2].
European frameworks based on competences have been
conceived as a tool to help mutual understanding and to
provide a common language to articulate the competences
required and acquired by ICT professionals. Through this
semantic interoperability, an attempt is made to alleviate the
communication gap that exists between different countries
and between different sectors of employment, education and
training. Transparency in these areas is also enhanced by
agreeing on the definition of work profiles, qualifications,
skills or abilities, and learning outcomes.
The e-Competence Framework (e-CF) [3], described in
European standard EN16234-1:2016, and the European
Skills,
Competences,
Qualifications
and
Occupations
(ESCO) [4] have been primarily discussed and from their
study and the analysis of their possible convergences, the
competences maps of each training program have been
developed. It is important to point out that the European job
classification ESCO, which was published in 2017, will be a
mandatory reference for public employment services of the
member states of the European Union (EU) in 2020,
establishing
a
multi-language
reference
terminology
reflecting the realities of both the labor market as well as the
education and training sector.
In parallel, and given the need to adapt curricula, job
offers, candidate profiles, etc., to the European competence
frameworks, a training course on these standards has also
been developed by the authors to make these frameworks
known in the field of education as well as in the labor
market. The training program shows the practical aspects of
e-CF and ESCO through concrete examples in which its use
can be seen in real cases. The audience to which this course
is addressed would be formed by:

ICT professionals who wish to assess and visualize
their skills / abilities, identify their possible learning
paths, or improve their ICT knowledge and correct
their deficiencies.

Managers
and
human
resources
departments
involved in the administration of human resources.

Organizations that provide ICT services, ICT users
and ICT providers.

Educational institutions and training organizations,
including higher education, interested in promoting
courses that are linked to digital skills and ICT
work profiles.

Certification providers, interested in certifying the
digital skills of ICT professionals.

Social agents, professional entities and accreditation
bodies.

Market analysts and regulators.

Other organizations and stakeholders from the
public and private sectors.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
the related work. Section III lists the benefits of the maps and
finally, the concluding remarks are included in Section IV.

RELATED WORK
The authors have previously worked with the e-CF and
ESCO standards in the European projects e-Skills Match [5]-
[7] and e-CF Council [8]. The first was co-financed by the
European Commission (EC) (The Directorate-General for
Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG
CONNECT)) under the pilot program "Open Knowledge
Technologies: Mapping and Validating Knowledge" related
to the H2020 program [9]. The project began in September
2015, lasted 24 months and had a total budget of 1,112,787
euros. Among the project participants were partners from
four European countries: Sweden, Italy, Spain and Greece.
The objective of the project was to create a system for
learning digital professional and user skills with dynamic
adaptation to changes in job classification systems as part of
the European Area of Skills and Qualifications (EASQ). The
platform developed in the e-Skills Match project allows the
self-assessment of competencies for specific positions, the
connection with training modules that allow acquiring the
skills of a given position and a qualification system for each
competence. The system takes as reference the European
models e-CF, ESCO and the European digital competence
framework also known as DIGCOMP [10]. Regarding the e-
CF Council project, included in the Erasmus + Skills
Alliance program [11], it started in 2015 and had a funding
of 871,000 euros. The members of the consortium, which
was financed by the EC until 2018, were organizations that
represent the reference groups in ICT professionalism in four
member states of the EU: Italy, Spain, Bulgaria and the
Netherlands. In addition, the e-CF Council had central
associations recognized by the EU, such as Digital Europe,
European Digital Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
Alliance, e-Skills Association, etc. This project aimed to
create an alliance of management of qualifications and
certifications based on the e-CF standard to promote the
professionalism of ICT at a European and international level.
Its objective was to increase employability in order to reduce
the gap of ICT competences in Europe by developing unified
programs and certifications of professional training in ICT.
On the other hand, since January 2018 the authors have been
working on the European project "Support services for the
development
of
version
4.0
of
the
e-Competence
Framework", which lasts two years. The objective of this
project is the development of the new version of the e-CF
standard to update it and adapt it to the new changes
introduced in the ICT sector.
In addition, European authorities continue to promote
projects similar to those mentioned above due to the high
unemployment rates among young people and the growing
employability in the ICT sector in Europe. One of these
initiatives has been "Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs" [12],
which was launched on March 4, 2013 in Brussels. The
theme of the conference was "e-Skills and Education for
Digital Jobs" and its main objective was to facilitate the
adoption of measures to improve digital capabilities in the
EU countries. The objectives of the EU for the period 2014-
2020 are the promotion of the professionalization of ICT and
the generation of a greater group of talents of entrepreneurs,
business leaders, managers and advanced users focused on
the strategic use of new technologies of the information and
communication. The EC is aware of the need to develop
initiatives to ensure sufficient supply of adequately qualified
ICT professionals and the need to encourage the younger
population to pursue careers related to ICT. This fact is not
unique to Europe, since the shortage of ICT vocations has
also been identified in the United States and other developed
countries. A report funded by the EC [13] estimates that up
to 756,000 job vacancies by 2020 will not be filled due to the
lack of qualified ICT professionals. This estimation, together
with previous analyzes, has led the EU to launch specific
initiatives related to eSkills and digital competences ("eSkills
for Jobs", "Digital Agenda for Europe", "ICT Certification in
Europe", "e-Leadership Digital Skills" for SMEs ", etc.) to
help more people get jobs related to ICT throughout Europe.
On the other hand, the current analysis has shown that the
level of interoperability of professional Web portals in
Europe is very low. Although there is coverage for the
development of e-Skills and professional support, individual
portals provide only partial information. Users have to
change from one service to another to find an integrated path
for their professional development.
As it can be seen, the dynamics of the labor market both
nationally and internationally depend entirely on the good
communication of information related to profiles, skills,
competences and knowledge. In the EU, having 24 official
languages, everything points to the fact that common
terminology should be used to guarantee the exchange of
information between job-seekers and employers. However,
despite local and global efforts, many stakeholders (job-
seekers,
employers,
employment
services,
employment
portals, educational institutions and training centers) do not
know the European frameworks and standards and do not
recognize them when they are asked about them. For this
reason, we conducted a survey of 97 experts to analyze the
perception
of
e-CF
and
other
European
initiatives.
Surprisingly, more than half thought they lacked information
and 77% admitted not knowing any curriculum mapped with
e-CF or with ESCO. The survey also found that there are
important differences between supply and demand in certain
areas, such as software (30.3%), management (29.2%),
cybersecurity (15.7%) or cloud computing (14.6%). These
gaps give an idea of the need to apply the standards both in
the field of training to detect those competences on which the
new training courses should be based and also so that
candidates who have a certain profile can self-assess their
competences and verify if they meet the requirements of a
certain job.
Although e-CF was confirmed as a European standard by
the European Committee for Standardization in 2016, the
Council of European Professional Informatics Societies
(CEPIS) identified that there was a lack of information
provided to employers and other potential users of e-CF. The
promotion,
provision
of
information
and
employment
assistance to understand how e-CF can be used is a need that
has not been identified either by the EC or by the European
Standards Organization. As an organization whose mission is
to improve and promote a high level among information and

technology professionals in recognition of the impact that
information technology has on employment, business and
society,
CEPIS
also
advocates
that
e-CF
should
be
established progressively in member states to promote the
professionalization of ICT in Europe.
The present work aims to contribute to supply the
deficiencies mentioned above through the implementation of
competence maps of training courses that try to link the
academic world with the labor world. This union constitutes
a novel approach never before treated and represents the first
step for a pioneering attempt to publicize European standards
and adapt them definitively to the Spanish educational
system.
III.
BENEFITS OF THE MAPS
Considering the previous contributions to the scope of
the present work, its innovative effect could be broken down
into the following points:
- Understand the basic characteristics of the main
European competence frameworks to subsequently be able to
identify their relationship with the labor market and with the
field of education.
- Provide a common European language for the ICT job
market in terms of competences, skills and proficiency levels
required by professionals in the sector. In this way, all
stakeholders could have a common shared reference.
- Help to define:

Jobs,
offers
and
hiring
needs,
and
other
competence specifications.

Training courses, qualifications, certifications
and higher education programs.

Career plans and professional development
needs.

Plans for formal and non-formal education.

Analysis of competence improvements and
training needs at an individual or global level.
- Allow mobility through the European job mobility
service, improving the transparency and comparability of
qualifications across Europe, as differences between the
education systems of member states make it difficult for
employers to identify the skills and qualifications that a
person has obtained in another EU country.
- Help the training centers by describing the learning
outcomes, as these are defined in terms of knowledge, skills
and
competences.
This
shared
terminology
facilitates
dialogue between the labor market and stakeholders through
different sectors and borders. In addition, it allows to
understand the development of emerging skills in an
international context, and to be able to communicate in the
same language as employers:

Employers will verify the suitability of a
candidate for a job based on their qualifications.

Educational systems will be able to obtain
feedback on the needs of the labor market,
identify skills gaps and adapt their qualifications
accordingly to meet employment needs.
-
Improve
the
efficiency
of
human
resources
departments, providing a connection between jobs, skills and
qualifications:

The competences can be used to describe jobs,
competence specifications and descriptions of
professional development needs.

Competence levels can be used to provide
detailed profile specifications.

The competences are related to jobs, which
allows to focus efficiently on the selection of
personnel, hiring, and collaborations.

It makes it possible to measure the skills deficit
and
the
short
and
long-term
planning,
to
evaluate and budget the educational and training
needs of the staff.
- Help employers to:

Understand
the
knowledge,
skills
and
competencies that people have to obtain through
education, training or work experience.

Express what they expect from their employees
with
knowledge,
skills,
competences
and
qualifications.

Find the right person for a job.
- Help job seekers to:

Understand what employers need.

Understand how they can develop their careers
through lifelong learning.

Describe
their
knowledge,
skills
and
competences in order to find the right job.

Self-evaluate to know what competencies have
been acquired and which have not.
- Help employment services to:

Provide better online services to their users by
improving the mapping of job seekers with jobs.

Communicate
with
their
users
in
several
languages.

Partner
with
other
service
providers
and
exchange information with them, to strengthen
cooperation
between
public
and
private
employment
services,
as
well
as
training
centers.
Table I shows an example of a competence map. The
training course that has been analyzed is called “Master in
software engineering for the Web”. It is offered by the
University of Alcalá (Spain) and its duration is one year. The
80% of the course can be studied online. According to the
table, the e-CF competences covered with the course are
listed together with their correspondent proficiency level
(from 1 to 5). If the competences from the ICT profiles are
considered, we can see that the certificate covers different
competences with different levels. Finally, the related ESCO
occupations are also included at the bottom of the map. Note
that sometimes the names of the e-CF job profiles are
different from the names of the ESCO occupations.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
It is expected that this work will have a significant impact
in its field, due to the development of competence maps,
starting
with
higher
education,
and
due
to
the
implementation of the training course that will reveal the
main
competence
European
frameworks
to
the
main
stakeholders. The use of these standards will improve the
relevance
of
the
mapped
training
programs
at
the
international level, since they will follow the same reference
that is beginning to be established in the rest of the world.
The results of the project will make possible to address
technological
transfer
actions
towards
companies
and
external entities in which work connections already exist in
the following areas:

Competence
analysis
guide
for
personnel,
adaptation
to
the
professional
profile
and
organization of support for the internal career plan
and training in human resources related to ICT:
collaboration and contacts with Exin Consulting
[14],
Human
Resources
Department
of
MadridDigital [15], etc.

Specialized training for consulting services, public
entities and training centers, with existing contacts
with the computer services department of the
University of Seville (Spain).
The proposed work will implement a social innovation
process to engage people in the learning activities. In this
regard,
the
authors
will
devote
significant
effort
in
engagement and dissemination activities, consulting with all
relevant
EU
stakeholders
in
the
research
community,
institutional actors in the member states, the industry, and
public employment services, businesses and job-seekers
representing end users.
The communication and dissemination strategy includes
the following items:

Developing courses

Developing promotional materials: presentations,
press releases, factsheets, posters, brochures, etc.

Disseminating the results via online and offline
communication channels.

Feeding updates of the results on social networks

Developing a website.
A possible future line of research deals with the
development of certification competence maps. There are
currently 2313 ICT certifications [16] from 161 different
entities. This mapping would represent a very novel
contribution because it would connect another fundamental
pillar of the ICT sector with the European reference
frameworks.
