Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the performance of an
indoor wireless optical communication system by taking into
account emitter mobility. We consider the two typical optical link
conﬁgurations, which are Line of Sight (LOS) and diffuse ones.
Mobility is described by using Gaussian statistical model of the
emitter location. In order to determine the maximal rate, which
can be obtained for each conﬁguration, we ﬁrst determine the
outage probability of the link because of emitter mobility. From
this, we also estimate the outage capacity, which corresponds
to the maximal information rate for a given outage probability
value. We analyze the different conﬁguration performance and
we point out the trade-off between emitted power and LOS and
diffuse schemes constraints (tracking and blocking effect). We
ﬁnally present the performance of two error control mechanisms,
which are Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Luby Transform
(LT) codes and we compare the obtained rates to the outage
capacity. We show that LT codes outperform ARQ mechanism
for high outage probability values and provide a robust solution
for indoor optical channel when mobility is considered.

I. INTRODUCTION
This article constitutes an extended version of [1] and
enhances the results about outage capacity of optical links
by presenting the performance of Luby Transform (LT) codes
and Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ). The results permit
evaluating the gap between practical error control mechanisms
and the bound.
Nowadays, Wireless Optical Communications (WOC) based
on Infrared (IR) transmissions are popular indoor technolo-
gies, which offer many advantages such as low complexity
implementation and high secured transmissions [2]. Besides,
WOC are considered as powerful alternative or complementary
solutions to radio frequency ones for many indoor and home
applications [3], [4]. Actually, IR systems intrinsically offer
several beneﬁts over radio frequency systems due to unregu-
lated and quasi-unlimited bandwidth, the absence of multipath
fading and the robustness to electromagnetic interferences,
which is important in health concerned environments such as
hospitals for example [5], [6].
To establish a WOC link, two main transmission conﬁgu-
rations are commonly used: Line of Sight (LOS) scheme and
diffuse one. Many works have already been published on the
LOS and diffuse WOC system design especially considering
the wireless optical channel as a stationary one [7]–[12]. The
LOS propagation system has been studied for point-to-point
communications. Based on a direct propagation, this is the
most basic technology and the most commonly investigated
one for IR short-range transmissions [7] because guaranteeing
high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). However, misalignments
between emitter and receiver have a strong impact on the
path loss and can severely degrade LOS performance. On the
contrary, for diffuse conﬁguration, the optical emitter projects
wide-beams on reﬂecting surfaces of the indoor environment
and the diffuse reﬂections are used to establish the link with
the receiver. In such a scheme, it is not necessary to ensure a
perfect aligned path. This permits obtaining higher coverage
area but at the cost of a reduction of the optical received power
(lower SNR) [8], [9].
By considering emitter mobility in the indoor environment,
the received power for both LOS and diffuse schemes can
signiﬁcantly decrease because of random distance variations
between emitter and receiver. In this case, the mobile WOC
channel is non-stationary and performance is based on link
outage analysis. To guarantee a high Quality of Service (QoS)
and an efﬁcient link, it is thus important to assess the impact of
mobility in the design of the communicating system. For this
purpose, from the outage probability evaluation, we determine
the outage capacity of the wireless optical link in the two
conﬁgurations and we establish the maximal rate that can be
achieved by ARQ and LT codes.
In this paper, our ﬁrst contribution is the determination of
the WOC performance for a mobile emitter in a rectangular
shaped room where the receiver is ﬁxed and located in the
middle of the ceiling. We introduce a statistical model of the
non stationary optical channel to evaluate the performance in
terms of outage probability for the two conﬁgurations LOS
and diffuse. Moreover, to establish the maximal data rate
that can be achieved we then estimate the channel capacity
considering outage events in the case of indoor LOS and
diffuse transmissions because of emitter mobility.
In addition, over such non-stationary channel, reliable trans-
missions cannot be achieved by using a ﬁxed rate code and is
classically obtained using Hybrid Automatic Repeat-reQuest
(H-ARQ) [13] combining error correcting code and error
control mechanism. Another interesting and original method
introduced by Luby consists in using fountain codes or LT
codes [14], [15] instead of ARQ. A second contribution of
the study is to provide the performance of two error control
mechanisms, which are ARQ and LT codes for the investigated

mobile WOC. We ﬁnally compare the results to the maximal
theoretical rate corresponding to outage capacity.
The paper is organized as follows: after presenting related
works in Section II, the optical transmission system is de-
scribed in Section III. We then evaluate the outage probability
in Section IV in LOS and diffuse conﬁgurations using a
statistical approach. In Section V, we determine the outage
capacity for both conﬁgurations considering the non-stationary
channel. We ﬁnally present ARQ and LT mechanisms in
part VI and analyze the attainable rates before concluding.
II. RELATED WORK
Optical channel capacity has already been studied in the
case of Free Space Optical (FSO) transmissions over at-
mospheric channel subject to scintillation effect [16], [17],
respectively with and without Channel Side Information (CSI).
Capacities of outdoor optical channel have also been explored
in [18] where the authors analyze the effect of pointing errors
between emitter and receiver. Besides, in [19] and [20], the ca-
pacity considering multiple receivers is established. However,
to the best of our knowledge, capacity of indoor mobile optical
channel has not been yet investigated. Considering a statistical
model of the mobile indoor optical channel, our work can be
used to determine outage probability and outage capacity for
LOS and diffuse transmissions. Since performance of LOS
transmission greatly depends on the alignment between the
emitter and the receiver, we provide results for a full-tracked
and a non-tracked LOS systems.
To estimate system reliability, we also investigate the use of
error control mechanism above the physical layer. Recently, it
has been shown that LT codes have many advantages over a
large range of applications [21]. LT codes use an encoder to
produce an inﬁnite packet stream from a ﬁnite length message.
The LT decoder simply collects the received packets and can
decode the message once enough packets have been received.
LT codes provide an efﬁcient way to achieve reliable commu-
nication for very difﬁcult channels conditions since they do
not require feedback channel. Few researchers have applied
fountain codes over wireless optical channel [22]–[24]. In [22],

authors investigate raptor codes obtained by concatenation of
an LT code with an high rate error correcting code such as a
Low-Density Parity-Check code (LDPC), in order to improve
performance on FSO links affected by scintillation effect and
tracking errors. The authors in [23] study the performance of
fountain codes to maximize data rate on hybrid RF/FSO links.
In [24] we have investigated LT codes performance over indoor
mobile wireless optical channel for a ﬁxed data rate.
In this paper, we investigate the maximal data rate that can
be achieved by using LT codes and we compare the results to
ARQ ones and to outage capacity.
III. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
We consider an indoor environment and a communication
link between a mobile emitter in the environment and a base
station placed on the ceiling.
A. Studied Scenarios Description
The emitter is at (x1, y1, z1) in a room supposed to be free
of any obstacles and represented by a box of dimensions (3m,
4m, 2.5m). The receiver is supposed to be placed in the middle
of the ceiling at (x2 = 1.5m, y2 = 2m, z2 = 2.5m) and is
pointed toward the ﬂoor. We consider here an empty room to
provide general results and for simplicity.
We deﬁne two scenarios in order to investigate the emitter
mobility impact on the performance. The ﬁrst one considers
that the emitter is oriented toward the ceiling such as a direct
path can be established with the receiver. This corresponds to
LOS transmission. Since LOS performance greatly depends
on the alignment of both emitter and receiver, we consider
two cases. In full-tracked case, both emitter and receiver are
perfectly aligned and in non-tracked case the emitter maintains
a ﬁxed vertical orientation (see Figure 1).
In the second scenario, the emitter is pointed toward the
ﬂoor and the transmission is based on reﬂected paths. This cor-
responds to diffuse transmission conﬁguration (see Figure 2).

B. Optical Transmission Model
Data are sent by using an IR communication system based
on Intensity Modulation and Direct Detection (IM/DD). The
transmitted signal is thus an optical power and at the reception,
the photodetector current is proportional to the received optical
signal intensity. Consequently, the WOC link can be modeled
by a linear system and the photocurrent Y (t) at the receiver
can be written as [7]:
Y (t) = RX(t) ⊗ h(t) + N(t)
(1)
where X(t) is the instantaneous optical power, R is the photo-
diode responsivity, and h(t) represents the impulse response of
the optical channel. N(t) represents the additive noise present
over the wireless link.
In addition, for LOS case, we consider that the directivity
of both optical emitter and receiver does not allow multipath
propagation. For diffuse case, delay spread D is typically equal
to 10 ns [7] and is supposed to be negligible compared to low
rate transmission (D << 1/Rb). For higher rates, intersymbol
interference can be compensated by an equalization module.
Thus the impulse response is only characterized by its static
gain H such as:
h(t) = Hδ(t).
(2)
On Off Keying (OOK) modulation is used to transmit
symbols over the optical channel [25]. At the reception, the
electrical SNR is proportional to the received optical power
squared due to photo-diode detection [7]:
SNR = 2R2P 2
t H2
N0Rb
(3)
where Pt is the average transmitted power, N0, the noise
power-spectral density and Rb the transmission data rate.
In this study, we have chosen R = 0.55 A/W. N0 is deter-
mined considering that shot noise is the dominant noise source,
which can be considered as Gaussian noise [8]: N0 = 2Ibq
with mean current Ib = 200 µA and q = 1.6 × 10−19 C thus
N0 = 6.4 × 10−23 W/Hz.
For LOS transmission, the path loss H can be expressed as
a function of the distance and the orientation of the emitter
and receiver (see Figure 3) [7]:
H =
(
A
πd cos φ cos θ
0 ≤ θ ≤ θc
0
θ > θc
(4)
where A is the photo-detector physical surface, d is the
distance between emitter and receiver, and φ and θ are the
angles of incidence with respect to the emitter and receiver
axis respectively. The angle θc is the Field Of View (FOV) of
the receiver.

Considering the ﬁrst LOS scenario, we can thus write the
path loss expression corresponding to each case as:
Hft =

(5)
Hnt =

(6)
where Hft and Hnt correspond to the static gains of respec-
tively full-tracked and non-tracked cases. and dz is the vertical
distance between emitter and receiver (see Figure 3).
In the second scenario, for the diffuse conﬁguration the
channel gain expression is obtained using ceiling bounce
model [26]. The received power is computed by summing all
the contributions of tiny elements of the reﬂective surface (the
ﬂoor). The static gain can be thus expressed by:

(7)
where ρ is the ﬂoor reﬂectivity and is set to 0.8 in this study.
For both LOS and diffuse conﬁgurations, we consider in the
following that the photodetector has a physical surface A = 1
cm2 and FOV set to 70◦. Considering that the optical sources
have Lambertian patterns, the optical emitted power Pt is lim-
ited to 300 mW in order to respect eye safety regulations [7].
In this study, for LOS cases, we consider two different Pt
values 300 mW and 20 mW. The latter corresponds to the
typical indoor transmitted power value [27]. For diffuse case,
we have set the optical power to 300 mW [27].
In order to represent the emitter mobility, we model its
location within the room by Gaussian distributions for sim-
plicity, in x axis from 0 to 3m, in y axis from 0 to 4m and
in z axis from 0 to 1.5m. The mobility volume dimensions
are represented in Figure 1 and Figure 2. We suppose that

the emitter presence is more probable in the middle of the
room. Thus, the means of the position distributions along x
and y axis are chosen equal to respectively 1.5 m and 2 m. In
addition, the mean of the distribution along z axis is chosen
equal to 1.2 m. This corresponds for example to an emitter
placed at the belt level of a person. The variances of the x, y, z
distributions are deﬁned so that to include 98% of distribution
data inside the room. Consequently, the emitter mobility is
described along x y z axis by respectively N(1.5, 0.25) and
N(2, 0.36) and N(1.2, 0.09) distributions. In addition, the
tails of the distributions have been removed to respect the
deﬁned dimensions. Figure 4 shows the probability density
function (pdf) of the emitter location in two dimensions.
By considering mobility, H varies due to the distance vari-
ations between the emitter and the receiver. Note that, taking
into account obstacles or another mobility scenario would
modify the emitter position pdf, but the analysis presented
in the following remains the same.
IV. OUTAGE PROBABILITY
In the studied context, H variations are slow compared to
bit duration even for the lowest considered data rate. Optical
channel can be thus considered as a slow fading channel [7].
Consequently, average Bit Error Rate (BER) does not represent
a good metric to describe transmission performance since
each transmission experiments a different path loss. Instead,
the outage probability is used to estimate the performance.
The outage probability is deﬁned as the probability that the
capacity C of the channel does not support the rate R0 of the
transmission [28]. Since the capacity is a monotonic function
of SNR, the outage probability can be expressed as a function
of a SNR threshold (SNR0) and corresponds to the probability
that the SNR value at a given time drops below SNR0:
Pout = Pr[C(SNR) < R0] = Pr[SNR < SNR0]
(8)
Assuming the mobility scenario we have deﬁned, it is
possible to determine the value of the outage probability for a

given SNR0 using Monte Carlo (MC) method. This method is
proceeded according to the emitter position Gaussian distribu-
tion. For each point, the SNR is computed from (3) and from
H expressions (5), (6) or (7) depending on the conﬁguration
(LOS or diffuse).
SNR distributions for LOS conﬁguration are presented
in Figure 5 for full-tracked and non-tracked cases and for
different data rates of 5, 10 and 20 Mbps.
We can note that the SNR distribution in LOS conﬁguration
admits a minimum value corresponding to a case where the
emitter is placed on the ﬂoor, in a corner (d = dmax.)
Maximum SNR value is obtained when the emitter is placed
beneath the receiver at a maximum height of 1.5m (because of
mobility scenario). For example, for full-tracked system and a
data rate of 10 Mbps, we can see in Figure 5 that the minimum
and maximum SNR values correspond respectively to 5.8 dB
and 25.82 dB.
Moreover, if we compare the SNR distributions in full-
tracked and non-tracked cases, we observe as expected that,
for the same data rates the SNR distributions of non-tracked
systems admit lower average values and greater spreading.
Figure 6 presents the SNR distributions for diffuse conﬁg-
uration, with Pt = 300 mW and for different data rates.
First, we can see that the SNR distributions of diffuse
conﬁguration for the same data rates than previously, admit a
greater spreading than in the LOS cases. Moreover, we remark
for example that for Rb = 10 Mbps, the average SNR value
(SNR = 17.4 dB) is lower than in the full-tracked LOS case
(SNR = 19.1 dB) and is slightly lower than in the non-tracked
LOS case (SNR = 17.6 dB). This shows that diffuse channel
is more penalizing than LOS cases in our deﬁned mobility
scenario. This is due to the greater distance between emitter
and receiver in diffuse conﬁguration than in LOS cases.
These SNR distributions represent the non-stationnarity due
to the mobility scenario we study for the indoor optical

From these distributions, we can now estimate the outage
probability, which is equal to the fraction of points whose
SNR is below the threshold SNR0.
Figures 7 and 8 present outage probability Pout versus
SNR0, estimated with MC method for LOS scenario with
full-tracked and non-tracked systems and for two different Pt
values of 300 mW and 20 mW. The results have been plotted
for different data rates Rb.
As expected, we can see that, for both LOS cases, out-
age probability increases when the SNR0 threshold value
increases. Moreover, for a given Quality of Service (QoS)
i.e., for a given SNR0, this performance degradation also
depends on the data rate of the transmission and becomes

more signiﬁcant when Rb increases. In addition, we can see
that for the same SNR0, the outage probability can be reduced
at the cost of an increase of the optical transmitted power.
For example if a non-tracked system experiments an outage
probability of 10−3 at 5 Mbps with Pt = 20 mW, the results
reported in Figure 8 show that the outage probability can drop
below 10−6 if the optical power is increased up to 300mW.
Also, if a system with Pt = 20 mW requires a SNR0 of
13.6dB (to ensure a BER below 10−6 when the system is not
in outage), and if the targeted outage probability is 10−3, the
results reported in Figures 7 and 8 show that the data rate has
to be chosen below 5 Mbps for full-tracked system and below
1 Mbps for non-tracked system.
As expected, the maximal data rate for a given QoS, is
obtained for full-tracked LOS system. However it can be
noted that maintaining perfect tracking is a hard task. We now
investigate diffuse transmission performance, which does not
need tracking system and is intrinsically robust to blocking
effect. Figure 9 presents the outage probability as a function
of the SNR0 in diffuse conﬁguration.
As a ﬁrst remark, we can see that the outage probability vari-
ations exhibit the same behavior as in LOS cases. Moreover for
a given QoS, the rate that can be achieved by diffuse systems
is lower than LOS cases. For example if we consider the same
outage probability of 10−3 and the same SNR0 of 13.6 dB
as previously, we observe in Figure 9 that the rate of diffuse
link has to be lower than 600 Kbps whereas it was of 5 Mbps
(respectively 1 Mbps) for full-tracked LOS case (respectively
non-tracked LOS). However, diffuse system is more robust
than non-tracked LOS case against blocking effect. Besides
diffuse systems do not require any tracking device as for full-
tracked LOS case, and thus simplify the implementation. Thus
there is a trade-off between performance and complexity.
In order to estimate the maximum theoretical rate that can

is considered, we now introduce the outage capacity, which
provides the maximal information rate for a given outage
probability.
V. OUTAGE CAPACITY
We consider a binary input (due to the OOK modula-
tion) and continuous output Additive White Gaussian Noise
(AWGN) channel due to the noise present over the optical
channel.
For stationary channel, the capacity of binary input continu-
ous output AWGN channel does not admit a close form. Thus,
this capacity has to be evaluated by using [29]:

i=0
p(y|xi)p(xi) log
 
p(y|xi)

k=0 p(y|xk)p(xk)
!
dy
(9)
where p(y|x) are the conditional probabilities of the received
signal and follow Gaussian distributions N(RHX, RbN0).
p(x) corresponds to the probability of the binary symbol x.
Since the channel is symmetric, equation (9) is maximized
when p(x = 0) and p(x = 1) are equal to 0.5. Moreover, the
capacity is bounded between 0 and 1 due to the binary input.
For non-stationary (ﬂat fading) channel, the capacity de-
pends on the information available at the receiver [28]. In
this paper, we assume that the receiver has full and perfect
knowledge of the Channel State Information (CSI). This can
be obtained by inserting pilot symbols during the transmission.
At the receiver, these pilot symbols are used to evaluate
instantaneous SNR (or equivalently, instantaneous H).
The outage capacity, which well describes the performance
of quasi-static channel, is deﬁned as the average information
rate that can be received with a given outage probability.
The emitter ﬁxes a rate a priori and sends data over the

probability, the average information rate correctly received
is [28]:
Cout = (1 − Pout(SNR0)) C(SNR0)

Note that Cout is proportional to (1−Pout), which corresponds
to the absence of transmitted information (i.e., a null capacity)
during outage events.
Figures 10 and 11 present outage capacity versus outage
probability for LOS system in full-tracked and non-tracked
conﬁgurations for a typical emitted power value of 20 mW
and different data rate Rb. In both cases, outage capacity is
computed with (9) and (10). The outage probability has been
estimated using previously described MC method.
We can see that when the outage probability decreases, the

Capacity of diffuse wireless indoor channel
outage capacity increases and then slowly decreases for very
low outage probabilities. Outage capacity below 1 means that,
by using Forward Error Correction (FEC) at the physical layer
and error control mechanism at the application one, reliable
transmission over the channel can be achieved. Capacity equal
to 1 means that there is no need to use FEC to achieve the
maximal information rate.
When Pout tends to 1, the receiver is always in outage and
the maximum information rate that can be transmitted between
emitter and receiver tends to 0 (Cout = 0). On the other side,
when Pout tends to zero, Cout attempts a minimal value equal
to C(SNRmin) where SNRmin is the lower SNR that can be
received in the room.
Between these two values of Pout, we can see that there is a
given value of the outage probability maximizing the channel
capacity. This value depends on the data rate, and increases
when data rate decreases. This permits designing an efﬁcient
link with maximal achievable rate.
From results reported in Figure 10 and 11 we can see that
for LOS conﬁgurations, the maximal capacity is obtained for
Pout belonging in [5 × 10−2, 10−1] for data rates Rb between
5 and 40 Mbps for both full-tracked and non-tracked cases.
Moreover in full-tracked case (respectively in non-tracked
case), we can note that the maximal capacity varies from 1 to
0.8 bit/channel use (respectively 0.95 to 0.6 bit/channel use)
for data rates between 5Mbps and 40Mbps. Thus, this shows
that information rate in full-tracked LOS case is higher than in
non-tracked case but at the cost of a complex implementation
because of tracking devices.
Figure 12 presents outage capacity versus outage probability
for diffuse conﬁguration and with an optical power of Pt =
300 mW. The results have been plotted for different data rate
values between 500 kbps and 20 Mbps. The outage probability
has been estimated using previously described MC method.
In diffuse conﬁguration same remarks than in LOS cases
can be done. The outage probability, which maximizes the
capacity is obtained in the interval [10−3, 10−1] for data rates
between 500 kbps and 20 Mbps. The corresponding outage
capacity is included in the interval [1, 0.85].
To compare the different conﬁgurations, we consider a
data rate of 20 Mbps. The maximal capacity values and
corresponding outage probability ones in full-tracked, non-
tracked and diffuse cases are reported in Table I.
As expected we can see that the full-tracked LOS perfor-
mance outperforms the other ones but at the cost of a more
complex implementation. Moreover we can note that non-
tracked LOS and diffuse cases permit obtaining quite same
information rate even though the optical emitted power in non-
tracked case (20 mW) is lower than in the diffuse case (300
mW). This illustrates the trade-off between optical emitted
power and robustness to blocking effects that is the main
advantage of diffuse systems.
Outage capacity provides the maximal theoretical infor-
mation rate that we can obtain over the optical channel
considering mobility. Unfortunately, real systems operate at
a lower rate, which depends among other on the error control
mechanism. In the following, we illustrate the performance
that can be achieved at the application layer.
VI. PERFORMANCE OF LT CODES
We consider two error control mechanisms: stop-and-wait
ARQ [13], which is the simplest technique for short range
application, and LT codes [14].
ARQ mechanism uses feedback channel in order to ac-
knowledge each received packet and is penalized by timeouts
when packets are lost. Assuming a perfect feedback channel
(no loss of acknowledgement), the average information rate
that can be achieved by stop-and-wait ARQ can be expressed
as a function of the outage probability and the outage capacity:
RARQ = (1 − Pout)C(SNR0)
(1 − Pout) + aPout
(11)
where a, the ratio between the ARQ timeout and the trans-
mission time has been set to a = 5.
For LT codes, performance is characterized by the code
overhead ǫ, which corresponds to the additional information
required to decode the received packets. In order to satisfy
memory requirements of both emitter and receiver we consider
very short length LT codes with K = 100. This means that
the original message has been divided into K = 100 packets.

The key parameter for LT codes is the degree distribution
ρ, which is a probability distribution deﬁning the number of
blocks combined in a packet.
The code overhead value and the computational cost of the
decoding process are linked to the degree distribution and it is
important to optimize this value. In order to design an efﬁcient
degree distribution for short length LT codes, we deﬁne the
cost function as the average overhead and we optimize the
degree distribution ρ in order to minimize the overhead. Since
the cost function is noisy (it can produce different results for
the same parameters) and not differentiable, classical optimiza-
tion methods cannot be applied. We have chosen Differential
Evolution method [30], which is based on a genetic algorithm,
in order to minimize the cost function. The resulting degree
distribution we have obtained is presented in Table II. This
corresponds to an average overhead ǫ = 23%.
Finally, the information rate that can be achieved by LT
code depends on the overhead and is equal to:
RLT =
1
1 + ǫ(1 − Pout)C(SNR0).
(12)
Figure 13 presents the information rate that can be achieved by
using ARQ mechanism and LT codes as a function of the out-
age probability for LOS transmissions considering the different
cases (full-tracked and non-tracked cases) and for a data rate
Rb of 20 Mbps. Outage capacity we have previously obtained
and corresponding to the maximal theoretical information rate
is also plotted.
We can see that for low Pout values, ARQ mechanism
is well suited in all cases. However, for high Pout values
the information rate obtained with ARQ does not achieve
the outage capacity since the transmission is stopped during
timeouts. However, LT codes are not an efﬁcient mechanism
for low Pout values because of code overhead but permit
providing an higher rate than ARQ for high Pout values.
To illustrate the performance, we compare in Table III the
information rates obtained by ARQ and LT codes for the
optimal outage probability in the two LOS cases i.e., 4×10−2
in the full-tracked case and 2 × 10−1 in the non-tracked case.
We can see that for full-tracked case, ARQ mechanism is
the best solution since tracking system ensures high QoS.
However, for the non-tracked case, it is worth using LT codes
due to channel state degradations linked to misalignments.
In addition, from results in Figure 13, we can remark that
a non-tracked system designed with LT codes can provide an

Information rate of ARQ and LT codes in LOS cases for 20 Mbps
higher rate than full-tracked case. This means that mechanical
complexity can be reduced while maintaining identical rate if
LT codes are used instead of ARQ. For example, we consider
a full-tracked system using ARQ with an outage probability of
0.1 (see Figure13). The effective data rate is equal to Reﬀ =
R × Rb = 12.2 Mbps where R is the information rate. This
result is the same as for a non-tracked system with the same
Pout but using LT codes. This means than LT codes can reduce
the mechanical complexity of LOS system while maintaining
the achievable rate.
Figure 14 presents the available rate that can be obtained
with ARQ and LT codes for the diffuse conﬁguration consid-
ering an average transmitted power of 300 mW and different
data rates of 5 Mbps, 20 Mbps and 50 Mbps.
The curves present the same behavior as for the LOS
conﬁgurations. ARQ mechanism constitutes an efﬁcient so-
lution for low Pout values but is penalized when the outage
probability increases. However, LT codes are well suited for
high Pout values. Moreover, for Pout corresponding to the
maximal outage probability, we can see that, as the data rate
increases, the performance of LT codes become higher than
ARQ. For example, with Rb = 5 Mbps and for the optimal
Pout value, ARQ outperforms LT codes with an information
rate of 0.9 bit/channel use compared to 0.81 bit/channel use.
On the contrary, for 50 Mbps, LT code performance (0.53
bit/channel) overcomes ARQ one (0.35 bit/channel use).

Information rate of ARQ and LT codes in diffuse conﬁguration for
Rb = 5, 20 and 50 Mbps
Table III also compares the information rate for the optimal
Pout of LOS and diffuse conﬁgurations for Rb = 20 Mbps.
We can see that, as in the non-tracked LOS case, LT codes
can provide higher rate than ARQ mechanism for diffuse case.
Moreover, the gain provided by LT codes for diffuse case is
more signiﬁcant than for non-tracked LOS case. Thus, we
have illustrated that LT codes can be a robust error control
mechanism especially when channel conditions are degraded.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have investigated the performance of
indoor wireless optical channel. Our goal was to determine
the maximal rate, which can be obtained by taking into
account emitter mobility. For this purpose, we have ﬁrst
studied the outage probability considering two kinds of optical
transmissions that is Line Of Sight conﬁguration with full-
tracked and non-tracked schemes and diffuse one, which is
a more robust solution against blocking effect. From outage
analysis, we have then estimated the maximal theoretical rate
corresponding to the outage capacity. We have seen that outage
capacity can be maximized for high outage probability values.
As expected, the best performance has been obtained with full-
tracked LOS cases. However this solution requires a complex
implementation because of tracking devices. On the other side,
we have noted that non-tracked schemes and diffuse one had
quite the same performance even though the optical emitted
power was different. This has shown the trade-off between
emitted power, tracking complexity and robustness to blocking
effect.
To complete the theoretical results, performance of ARQ
and LT codes has also been investigated and compared to
the outage capacity. For LOS and diffuse conﬁgurations and
considering the optimal outage probability values, we have
shown that the maximal rate using LT codes was higher than
the rate using ARQ. Besides, we have illustrated that by using
LT codes instead of ARQ in LOS conﬁguration, it was possible
to achieve the same performance as in full-tracked LOS but
without any tracking system. For diffuse conﬁguration, we
have shown that the use of LT codes was more efﬁcient
than ARQ when channel conditions are degraded because
of data rate increase. Thus, LT codes can provide a more
robust error control mechanism than ARQ for indoor wireless
optical channel especially when mobility and misalignment
have a signiﬁcant impact. Numerous perspectives can be
investigated to enhance this work, among which comparison
with experimental results and cross-layer design to improve
error control mechanism performance.
