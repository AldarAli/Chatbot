Abstract— The Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is one of the most 
efficient algorithms used in various studies, which aims at 
segmenting the masses in mammogram images, thus to build a 
Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system capable of helping 
the physicians for an early diagnosis of the breast cancer. In 
this paper, we will introduce a new approach using FCM 
algorithm, in order to extract the mass from Region-of-
Interested (ROI). The proposed method aims at avoiding the 
limitations of cluster number estimation in FCM by selecting 
as input data, the set of pixels, which are able to provide us the 
information required to perform the mass segmentation by 
fixing two clusters only. The Gray Level Occurrence Matrix 
(GLCM) is used to extract the texture features for getting the 
optimal threshold, which separate between selected set and the 
other sets of the pixels that influence on the mass boundary 
accuracy. The performance of the proposed method is 
evaluated by specificity, sensitivity, accuracy and overlap. The 
results obtained from experiments show a good efficiency at 
the different measures used in this study.

 INTRODUCTION  
Breast cancer is one of the most common dangerous 
diseases in women. According to the World Health 
Organization, every year, breast cancer kills more than 
500,000 women around the world [1]. Although several 
imaging techniques, such as sonography and magnetic 
resonance imaging plays important role in breast cancer 
diagnosis, X-ray mammography is still the most effective 
screening technique for the early detection of breast cancer 
[2]. 
In the last few decades a large amount of researches has 
been conducted to detect and segment breast cancer in 
mammograms images. Soares et al. [3] used taxonomic 
indexes to describe the texture of the regions of interest. 
Then, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was proposed to 
classify the regions as mass and non-mass. Younesi and al. 
[4] developed a segmentation method for detection of masses 
in mammogram images using adaptive thresholding method 
and fuzzy entropy feature. Anitha et al. [5] proposed an 
automatic method to identify the suspicious mass region by 
using a Dual Stage Adaptive Thresholding (DuSAT).  
Cordeiro and al. [4] proposed an adaptive semi-supervised 
version 
of 
the 
Grow-Cut 
algorithm 
to 
perform 
mammographic image segmentation. This method is 
achieved based on automatic selection of internal points 
using the differential evolution optimization algorithm and 
modification of cellular automata evolution rules by 
introducing Gaussian fuzzy membership functions. Nija et al. 
[5] investigated combining several image enhancement 
algorithms in order to enhance the performance of masses 
segmentation. The results of this investigation showed that a 
particular combination of image enhancing algorithms that 
includes 
Contrast 
- 
Limited 
Adaptive 
Histogram 
Equalization (CLAHE) and Median Filtering is an effective 
way to enhance the appearance of the breast region in 
mammogram images to be further segmented and classified. 
Extracting the mass from Region of Interest (ROI) is a 
difficult task in mammography Computer-Aided Diagnosis 
(CAD) due to several factors, such as low contrast, density, 
indistinct borders and ill-defined shapes of the mass. Fuzzy 
clustering is more efficient than traditional techniques to 
handle the fuzziness of mammograms. On the other hand, 
choosing an optimal number of clusters is a big challenge for 
automating segmentation of masses by clustering. 
In this paper, we aim to develop an automated system for 
mass segmentation in mammograms using FCM algorithm 
setting two cluster only (C=2). In order to achieve this goal, 
we select as FCM-input the set of pixels that enable us to get 
meaningful information from Region of Interest (ROI).  This 
set of pixels is limited by maximum intensity of ROI and an 
optimal threshold given by a decrement operator, we get this 
optimal threshold when big changes happen in texture 
features. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows : 
Section 2 presents the materials and methods used in this 
work. Section 3 describes the experimental results obtained 
from the evaluation of the proposed methods. Finally, 
Section 4 presents the conclusion.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
The proposed method consists of three main stages: 
Firstly, median filter and contrast limited adaptive histogram 
equalization are applied for enhancing the contrast and 
quality of images. Secondly, a decrement operator L is used 
to find an appropriate threshold by increasing the number of 
pixels (FCM-input). At every decrement process, we monitor

the changes in texture features levels on the area of mass 
cluster after applying fuzzy c-means clustering with a fixed 
number of clusters c = 2, where, the set of input data that is 
subjected to process of clustering should be within a range 
limited by maximum of intensity M and a threshold test Ti 
initialized by T0 = M – L. Finally, we choose the value of 
threshold test, which makes big changes in texture features 
levels on the mass area as a suitable threshold Top. Figure 1 
describes the evolution of input-data and texture features 
selection in each step of threshold test decrementation.

A. Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization 
The Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization 
(CLAHE) technique [6] is a special case of Adaptive 
Histogram Equalization (AHE) [7]. This technique operates 
on regional areas of pixels in the image called tiles rather 
than on the entire image. Histograms are calculated from 
these tiles, producing local histograms. These local 
histograms are then equalized for getting a uniform 
distribution. Then, the neighboring tiles are combined based 
on bilinear interpolation to remove artificially induced 
boundaries. In this study, we use CLAHE technique to 
enhance the contrast of image and reduce edge-shadowing 
effects 
produced 
in 
homogeneous 
regions 
and, 
consequently, improve the accuracy of texture features 
results. 
B. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) 
The Fuzzy C-means algorithm was first introduced by 
Dunn [8] and improved by Bezdek [9]. This algorithm 
partitions a set of object data X = { 𝑥1, 𝑥2, ….., 𝑥3} into a 
number of c classes so that items in the same class are as 
similar as possible, based on minimizing the following 
quadratic objective function :

where the fuzzy index m>1 determines the amount of 
fuzziness of the resulting classification, the membership uik 
represents the degree of pixel 𝑥k belonging to cluster k (1≤ i 
≤ n), and dik =‖xk - ci‖ is the distance between pixel 𝑥k and 
the centroid 𝑣i.

C. Texture features 
Statistical texture features have been proven to be useful 
in classifying masses and normal breast tissues [10][11]. In 
this work, we examined a set of three texture features 
(energy, contrast, and homogeneity) from mass area 
(cluster_1) to identify the most suitable threshold that 
enables us to extract the boundaries of mass by clustering. 
The process of texture features selection is achieved using 
Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). 
D. Gray-level co-occurrence matrix 
The Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is a 
tabulation of how often different combinations of pixel 
brightness values (grey levels) occur in an image with the 
change of distance d (distance to the neighbor pixel: 1, 2, ..

etc) and by varying directions (rotation angle of an offset: 
0º, 45º, 90º, 135º) [12]. A number of studies have compared 
texture feature extraction schemes based on the second-
order gray-level statistics, the co-occurrence statistics, gray-
level run-length statistics, and Fourier power spectrum. The 
co-occurrence features were found to be the best of these 
methods. [13]. In our approach,  the GLCM is computed at a 
distance of d = 1 and for the direction of θ = 0°, 45°, 90 °, 
135 ° on cluster_1 area. Based on the authors’ database, the 
smallest masses area is within a 8x8 window. For this 
reason we use a tile of size 8x8. 
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
For the experiments, the MiniMIAS database was used. It 
contains 322 mammographic images from left and right 
breast of 161 patients. The mammograms are digitized at a 
resolution of 1024 X 1024 pixels and at 8-bit grey scale 
level. 
 After many tests, it was found that the best features for 
distinguishing between masses and normal breast tissues are 
the features of GLCM constructed at the direction of 0°. At 
this direction, the GLCM gives a homogeneity value for the 
masses area in the range [0.9–1], contrast in [0–0.2], and 
energy in [0.6–1]. Similarly, for normal breast tissue area, 
the GLCM gives the homogeneity in the range [0.61–0.8], 
contrast in [0.26–0.71], and energy in [0.14–0.39]. It is 
observed that the texture features for normal breast tissues 
and masses area are highly discriminated. In this study, we 
examined the texture features after the process of clustering 
in order to find a threshold that allows us to extract the 
boundaries of tumor with high accuracy. Figure 2 shows the 
values of texture features during the process of threshold 
decrementing for image Mdb10. 
 
Figure 3.  Contrast, Energy and homogeneity values using block size 8 × 8 
To evaluate the performance of segmentation all masses 
are manually marked by radiologist based on the visual 
criteria. 
Assuming that A is the area marked by radiologist and B 
is the area marked by the system, the area overlap metric 
(AOM) is given by: 
 
                 AOM(A, B) = Area(A∩B) / Area(A∪B)            (5) 
 
  In this work, the test by the measure of overlap (AOM) 
yielded a mean of 81% for the segmented images. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we developed a novel method for 
automated detection of masses in mammogram images. The 
proposed work utilizes fuzzy c-means algorithm to extract 
the tumor from region of interest, where the FCM input data 
are verified by using the GLCM feature texture in order to 
automate the process of segmentation.
