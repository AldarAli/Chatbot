Abstract— 
Due 
to 
the 
general, 
worldwide 
need 
for 
communication, Visible Light Communication (VLC) has 
become a research topic today. In comparison to other wireless 
technologies (such as Wi-Fi), this technology combines lighting 
and communication, enabling high data rates and reliability. In 
this paper VLC is used to establish different optical 
communication links for bidirectional communication between 
infrastructures and vehicles, namely Infrastructure-To-Vehicle 
(I2V) and Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I). VLC is used to 
provide guidance and management services for autonomous 
robot navigation inside an automated warehouse. Specific 
coding schemes are used in each optical link. The I2V link uses 
RGB white LEDs to simultaneously modulate the emitters 
embedded in each LED, allowing wavelength division 
multiplexing of optical signals transmitted via this link. The 
detection is based on an a-SiC:H pin-pin photodetector with 
tunable sensitivity in the visible range. The impact of parity 
check bits on bit error rate is discussed for different indoor 
communication scenarios.

INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extension of work originally presented in 
ALLSENSORS 2022 [1] that provided preliminary results of 
the use of footprint maps to support positioning and guidance 
under visible light communication technology. This work 
discusses the use of the footprint maps for this purpose and 
the importance of proper decoding methods. 
Indoor positioning can be addressed by several 
techniques, such as Wi-Fi, Assisted GPS (A-GPS), Infrared, 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and many other 
technologies [2][3]. Visible Light communication (VLC) is 
also an alternative, enhanced accuracy technology. VLC 
operates with visible light extending from 400 nm up to 750 
nm [4][5]. VLC systems use modulated LEDs to transmit 
information [6]. Due to its characteristics, LEDs [7] can be 
switched very fast to produce modulated light in high 
frequencies, allowing data transmission in high speed. For 
lighting purposes, energy saving demands the use of white 
LEDs [8][9], either based on blue emitter coated with a 
phosphor layer or based on polychromatic emitters. 
Phosphor-based LEDs usually consist of a blue LED chip 
covered in a yellow phosphor layer. Due to the long 
relaxation time of the phosphor, when this LED is used for 
VLC, the modulation bandwidth is limited, thereby limiting 
the transmission capacity. Using a blue filter before the 
receiver unit can increase the LED modulation bandwidth by 
eliminating the slow response of the yellow light component 
[10][11]. Although tri-chromatic LEDs are more expensive, 
they provide more bandwidth due to the independent 
modulation of each chip of a monolithic device. 
The receiver unit of VLC systems usually includes 
silicon-based photodiodes, as these devices operate in the 
visible region of the spectrum, or CMOS image sensors 
[12][13]. 
In this paper we propose the use of a multilayered a-SiC:H 
[14] [15] device to perform the photodetection of the optical 
signals generated by white trichromatic RGB LEDs [16], 
[17]. The system was designed for positioning and guidance 
[18 ][19 ], and the transmitters of each white LED were 
specifically modulated at precise frequencies and coding bit 
sequences [20][21].  
The optical VLC channel is characterized through the 
prediction of the channel gain, taking into consideration 
emitter characteristics, optical channel features and receiver 
properties. The Lambertian model is used for LED light 
distribution and MatLab simulations are used to infer the 
signal coverage of the LED in the illuminated indoor space 
[22][23]. The decoding strategy of the multiplexed signals 
demands system calibration for accurate regulation of each 
photocurrent level [24][25] and preferably the use of bit error 
control strategies, which are also discussed. For each link, 
different codification schemes are proposed using On-Off 
keying modulation.  
The proposed lighting and positioning/guidance system 
involves 
wireless 
communication, 
computer-based 
algorithms, smart sensor, and optical sources network, which 
constitutes a transdisciplinary approach framed in cyber-
physical systems. 
The paper is organized as follows. After the introduction 
(Section I), the general description of the system is presented 
in Section II. In Section III, the communication protocol and 
the encoding/decoding techniques are analyzed and 
discussed. At last, conclusions are addressed in Section IV.

II. 
VLC SYSTEM GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The VLC system is composed by the transmitter and the 
receiver modules, located at the infra-structure and at the 
mobile vehicle. Two optical links are established between the 
lamps and the vehicles, for I2V and V2I transmission. The 
optical source of the transmitter at infrastructure consists of 
four white RGB LEDs, while at a vehicle it is a multicolor 
LED or a single-color LED placed at the top. The sensor 
device used for the detection of the optical signals is a 
monolithic heterojunction composed of two pin structures 
[26]. As a result of its narrow thickness (200 nm) and higher 
bandgap (2.1 eV), the front pin a-SiC:H photodiode is 
responsible for the device's sensitivity to short wavelengths 
of the visible range (400 - 550 nm). The back pin a-Si:H 
structure operates in the complementary past of the visible 
range, collecting the long wavelengths (520 nm - 700 nm) 
[27]. The illumination window is established on the front 
photodiode. The use of steady state light as background light 
provides an enhancement of the electrical field of the front 
pin photodiode and the amplification of the generated 
photocurrent signal due to long wavelength light.  
A. Transmitter configuration 
For every channel of the I2V and V2I links, synchronous 
transmission based on a 64 bits data frame was used. In 
Figure 1 a) it is displayed the configuration of the LED lamp 
with four RGB white LEDs used in the I2V link. A uniform 
white light is provided in the indoor area by all three emitters 
(red, green, and blue). However, only specific emitters are 
modulated at a frequency imperceptible to the human eye. 
Each of these lamps illuminates an area with full radial 
coverage as shown Figure 1 b). 
 
a) 
b) 
Figure 1. Configuration of the VLC emitter: a) 4 RGB white LEDs; b) 
coverage area of each modulated emitter. 
The illuminated area corresponds to the coverage area of 
each lamp, defining a unit cell for the vehicle navigation 
along the space. The modulated emitters are the red junctions 
of the LEDs placed at the left side and the blue junctions of 
the LEDs at the right side.  
For the proposed system, the commercial white LEDs 
were designed for illumination purposes, exhibiting a wide 
half intensity angle (1/2 ) of 120º. Thus, the Lambertian 
order m is 1. The coverage range and radiation pattern of the 
LED light is affected by the half intensity angle, such that 
narrower 1/2 increases the illumination range. In Figure 2 it 
is displayed the luminous intensity of the red, green, and blue 
optical emitters of the white RGB commercial LEDs used in 
this system.  
 
Figure 2. Distribution of luminous intensity for the red, green, and blue 
emitters. 
For the maximum luminous intensity in the axial direction 
(IN) it was considered the average values stated in the 
datasheet specifications [28]. As it is shown in Figure 2, the 
luminous intensity varies with the direction, presenting a 
maximum at the axial direction (0º) and half of the maximum 
at 1/2=  60º. 
In Figure 3 it is plotted the normalized output spectra of 
the RGB white LEDs driven with a biasing current of 3 mA. 
 
Figure 3. Output normalized spectrum of the RGB white LED. 
The output spectra cover the wavelengths assigned to the 
blue, green and red regions, with wavelengths centered, 
respectively at 470 nm, 535 nm and 630 nm. The full width 
half height of each peak (FWHH) is 22 nm for the blue chip, 
nearly 48 nm for the green and 13 nm for the red chip. 
Usually, the FWHH of LED devices increases with the 
wavelength. However, as this is a white LED, the magnitude 
and width of each RGB peaks are optimized for the white. 
The green component is the lowest because the human eye 
has a maximum sensitivity at 530 nm. 
Table I summarizes the main optical characteristics of the 
optical sources of the VLC transmitter.

B. Channel characterization 
LEDs are modeled as Lambertian sources with uniform 
distribution of luminance in all directions, and luminous 
intensity dependent on the direction. The luminous intensity 
for a Lambertian source is given by the following equation 
[29]: 
 
where m is the order derived from a Lambertian pattern, IN is 
the maximum luminous intensity in the axial direction and  
is the angle of irradiance. The Lambertian order m is given 
by: 
 
The Lambertian order m indicates the LED's half-power 
angle. The semi-angle represents the area illuminated by the 
LED radiation pattern. Generally, a small m (around 1) 
indicates a wide illumination region, whereas a high m relates 
to a highly focused illumination region. Thus, m is a measure 
of light source spatial directivity. In this case, as the half 
intensity angle (1/2) is of 60º, the Lambertian order m is 1. 
The light signal is received by the photodetector, 
generates a binary sequence of the received signals and 
converts data into the original format. It is assumed Line of 
Sight (LoS) conditions, which consider that the signal 
propagation occurs in a direct path from the source to the 
receiver. 
 
Figure 4. Transmitter and receiver relative position. 
Figure 4 shows the relative position of the transmitter and 
receiver units with specification of the geometrical 
parameters needed to infer the signal coverage of the LED in 
the illuminated indoor space [30]. 
The channel gain (G) of the VLC link is given by equation 
[31]:  
 
      (3) 
 
where A is the area of the photodetector, d is the distance 
between the emitter and the receiver, and FOV is the field of 
view of the detector (angular extension for signal detection). 
In Figure 5 it is displayed the predicted received power of 
the emitters of the white RGB LED transmitter. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Received power (dBm) the red and blue emitters of the 
white RGB LED transmitter. 
C. Footprint maps 
Figure 6 illustrates the coverage map produced when only 
the red and blue emitters of each LED are used for data 
transmission. This region allows the definition of the unit 
navigation cell related to each luminaire of the illuminated 
space. 
 
 
Figure 6. Coverage map of the fine-grain footprint inside the 
navigation cell, considering as VLC optical sources the top red and 
bottom blue emitters. 
In each unit navigation cell, any receiver will be able to 
identify the emission lamp and make a correspondence to the 
spatial position inside the warehouse. By modulating the red 
and blue emitters of each lamp, the optical pattern created 
within each navigation cell can enhance position accuracy. 
Inside the navigation cell, top emitters (labelled R and B) 
point north, bottom emitters (R' and B') point south and left 
(R and R') and right (B and B') emitters point west and east, 
respectively.

Based on this assumption, the RB’ optical pattern 
corresponds to the north direction, R’B’ to the south, RR’ to 
the west and BB’ to the east. The intercardinal directions 
inside the navigation cell correspond to RR’B (northwest), 
RBB’ (northeast), RR’B’ (southwest) and R’BB’ (southeast). 
In this coverage map the optical signal produced by each 
modulated LED confers a maximum of delivered power 
signal at the central region of the cell, that receives 
contribution from four modulated channels. The regions at 
the corners contain optical signals from three LEDs, 
exhibiting a decrease on the received power signal, while the 
side regions correspond to the lowest values of received 
power. Each of these regions constitute footprints of the 
delivered power. Each footprint region labelled as #1, #2, …, 
#9 is assigned to the correspondent optical excitation 
illustrated on the right side of Figure 6. Using adjacent LED 
lamps to light the indoor space, different navigation cells are 
enabled by each lamp. The identification of each lamp is 
provided by a specific code. 
D. Coding 
In Figure 7 it is displayed the data frame structure the bi-
directional communication I2V and V2I. 
a) 
b)  
Figure 7. Data frame structure the communication: a) I2V and b) V2I 
channels. 
Data frames are words of 64 bits composed each of six 
blocks. First and last blocks, labelled respectively as SoT 
(Start of Text) and EoT (End of Text) are used to trigger 
synchronization of the transmitter and receptor in each link.  
In the I2V link, there are also the blocks CELL ID, 
POSITION, RACK and MESSAGE. Identification of the unit 
cell is given by the block CELL ID. The format of the word 
code is 0XXXX00YYYY0, where XXXX addresses the line 
and YYYY the column of the unit navigation cell. Block 
POSITION provides information about which emitters are 
being detected by the mobile vehicle and thereby enables the 
vehicle to know its relative position within the navigation 
cell. The block RACK contains information about the stock 
stored inside the rack, addressing different sections. The 
MESSAGE block (32 bits) enables the possibility of 
transmitting a random message to the vehicle. 
In the V2I link a single LED is used to transmit 
information from the vehicle to the infrastructure, namely 
information about items being removed from the rack within 
the navigation cell to the shipping station. The code word 
contains the blocks ROBOT ID, CELL ID, RACK and 
MESSAGE, besides SoT and EoT blocks. The blocks 
ROBOT ID and CELL ID encode the identification of the 
transmitting vehicle and of the receiver infrastructure. The 
RACK block identifies the specific rack from where items are 
being removed and the MESSAGE block encodes the item 
and quantity being removed. 
E. Receiver configuration 
The VLC receiver device of the system is a photodiode 
able to measure both pulsed and steady light sources, by 
converting the optical power to an electrical current, which 
depends on incident light power and wavelength. The 
photodiode is a dual sandwich pin photodetector with an a-
Si:H pin structure mounted above an a-SiC:H pin structure, 
allowing the device to be used over the full a-Si:H and a-
SiC:H wavelength ranges (Figure 8).  
 
Figure 8. VLC sensor device: based on two stacked pin photodiodes 
based on a-SiC:H and a-Si:H. 
It operates in the full range of the visible spectrum, with a 
spectral sensitivity that can be controlled externally using 
steady state light [32]. The device is housed on a glass 
substrate with one anode and one cathode connections. It is 
operated under reverse bias to improve collection efficiency. 
It is a large area device with a sensitive area of 1 cm2 which 
contributes to the collection efficiency of light, and at the 
same time induces capacitive effects prone to limit speed 
operation. 
The intrinsic layer materials used in each pin photodiode 
of the device and the thickness of each absorption layer 
provide different absorption mechanisms due to the specific 
material bandgaps. The used configuration delivers high 
absorption of short wavelength light in the front photodiode 
(a-SiC:H) and high absorption of the long wavelengths in the 
back photodiode (a-Si:H). Intermediate wavelengths are 
absorbed by both photodiodes. The use of steady state light 
as background light enhances the electrical field of the front 
a-SiC:H photodiode and amplifies the generated photocurrent 
signal produced under long wavelength light incidence. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In the V2I link a single emitter is used to transmit 
information from the mobile robot to the LED infrastructure. 
In Figure 9 it is displayed the output signal due to the optical 
signal transmitted by the mobile robot after removing items 
49

from a specific rack. On the top it is displayed the optical 
signal with the transmitted bit sequence. As this V2I link uses 
a single emitter, the photocurrent signal, when under line-of-
sight condition, follows the pattern of the single transmitted 
optical signal. Thus, decoding is a simple process, limited 
only by the photodiode sensitivity at low illumination 
conditions.

Figure 9.  Output signal transmitted by the robot to the infrastructure 
after removal of items from the rack. On the top it displayed the 
transmitted optical signal. 
As shown in the figure, bits in red color, either set to 1 or 
to 0, cannot be changed in this channel. Bits in black color 
are those that define the specific communication conditions. 
In this case, the blocks of the coded 64-bits word can be easily 
decoded. Bits of the ROBOT ID are 01100110, 
corresponding to the identification code 118 (decimal 
representation). The CELL ID provides for the decoded bits, 
the number 001010000100, which corresponds to line 5 and 
column 2. Bits of the RACK block are 1011, representing that 
items from the first and third racks were removed when the 
vehicle moved in the forward lane. 
In the I2V link, the use of four emitters to transmit the 
coded information generates 16 photocurrents levels, 
assigned to 16 different optical excitations. These levels are 
dependent on the optical intensity at the reception end, 
however, its relative position is assumed to be constant. This 
supports the use of a calibration curve to demultiplex the 
signal, decodes the transmitted bits and enables identification 
of the input optical signals. In Figure 10 it is displayed the 
calibration curve, showing the 16 output levels assigned to 
each input optical state. The driving current of each LED 
emitter was adjusted to provide different levels of photo 
excitation.  
On the right side of the picture, it is shown the label of the 
modulated emitters that correspond to each photocurrent 
level. The decoding methodology based on the calibration 
curve may result in some error mismatch when the 
photocurrent levels are too close. It is important to mention 
that only 9 of these 16 levels are used to infer the position 
using the footprint maps. Thus, the correct decoding of these 
levels is crucial to support positioning.

To increase the accuracy of the decoding task, bit error 
detection with parity check bits can be used. Parity bits (P1, 
P2, P3) assigned to the 4 transmission channels (R, R’, B, B’) 
are evaluated using a simple algorithm that sums up the bits 
transmitted by 3 of the channels: 
P1 = R + R’ + B’ 
P2 = R’ + B + B’ 
P3 = R + B + B’ 
(4) 
In Figure 11 it is displayed the parity check bits evaluated 
by equation (1) for the transmission of the bit sequences 
plotted in Figure 10. The parity check bits sequences (P1, P2 
and P3) are transmitted, respectively, by the R, R’ and B 
emitters.

Results show that the error control signal can be used to 
help on the decode process when photocurrent levels are very 
close. Under these circumstances, the use of parity check bits 
can detect and correct errors without the need to discard the 
transmitted data from the specific error bit and re-transmit it 
again.

Figure 12. Photocurrent signal acquired along the forward path at cell 
central position under the coverage of RR’BB’.  
The comparison of the output signal with the calibration 
curve allows the decode of the signal and identification of the 
receiver’s position. Bit decoding of the multiplexed signal 
resulted for the CELL ID block the word 001010000100 
(every 4 transmitters), corresponding to line 5 and column 2, 
for the POSITION block to the word 111111000000 from R 
and B transmitters and word 111000111000 from R’ and B’ 
transmitters, which indicates that the vehicle is at the center 
of the navigation cell. For the RACK block it is decoded the 
words 1110 from R and B transmitters and 1011 from R’ and 
B’ transmitters, which means that all racks of the cell are 
available with exception to the second rack in forward 
direction.  
In Figure 13a) it is displayed the error control signal 
obtained with parity check bits of the transmitted signal of 
the I2V link shown in Figure 12. 
The use of the calibration curve for decoding the 
multiplexed signal, demands a periodic transmission of the 
16 possible combinations of the 4 optical signals to provide 
update of the calibration data and ensure correct output signal 
assignment. In this application, speed is not a critical issue, 
and this procedure does not overload the transmission 
efficiency. However, it can be discarded or done with less 
frequency when the accuracy of the decoding is increased 
using parity check bits. 
The system is also feasible to be enhanced using feedback 
control for adjustment of the LED driving currents when the 
output photocurrent levels generated by the photodiode 
become too close. This procedure would minimize decoding 
errors due to parasitic effects such as optical intensity 
variations caused by to multiple reflections, light dispersion, 
or other light sources. Thus, the ambient light would not 
affect the proposed methodology.

In addition to this bit error control strategy that improves 
the communication robustness, other coding schemes can be 
implemented, such as Manchester. OOK is a valuable 
modulation scheme in VLC due to its low complexity and 
ease of implementation. However, it may include flickering 
effects, which disturb the illumination distribution and even 
the communication under low dimming conditions.  
The use of Manchester codes demands the use of two bits 
to transmit each symbol, which halves the data rate. 
However, it is prone to cause less hysteresis effects ensuring 
a stable calibration curve in better agreement with the level 
of each optical excitation. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS  
Bi-directional communication using VLC in both 
downlink and uplink channels has been addressed in a 
autonomous vehicle guidance system. The proposed indoor 
application deals with infrastructure to vehicle (I2V) and 
vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication in a 
warehouse. The vehicle moves autonomously through the 
warehouse transporting goods from the carts to the packaging 
station. The transmitted data is encoded in a 64 bits word, 
defined using specific data frames in communication 
channel. Codification of the optical signals ensured 
synchronization between frames. The code word of each 
channel was designed to ensure synchronization between

frames, to transmit information of the transmitter 
identification and of spatial location. 
Experimental 
evaluation demonstrated that the decoding solution can 
provide robust communications, especially if automatic bit 
error control is implemented in the optical domain. The 
optical sources using trichromatic LEDs were fully 
characterized by the Lambertian model adapted to the 
specifications of each LED. This provided the definition of 
footprint maps, necessary to enhance the accuracy of the 
position inside each navigation cell. 
In addition, to the mentioned above relating the decoding 
process, other coding schemes may be implemented in future 
developments of the proposed system, namely Manchester 
codes.
