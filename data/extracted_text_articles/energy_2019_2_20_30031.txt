Abstract—The U.S. electric power infrastructure is in urgent
need of renovation. Recent major power outages in California,
New York, Texas, and Florida have drawn attention to the
unreliability of the U.S. electric power system. The media
discussed America’s aging power infrastructure and the Public
Utilities Commission called for a comprehensive review of the
causes of recent power outages. This study explores geographic
information
systems
to
identify
a
correlation
between
population
density and power outages in Georgia.
Initial
investigation using ArcMap software as a visualization tool
revealed areas where this association emerged.

I. INTRODUCTION & PROBLEM DEFINITION
In a short time, electrical power has become a necessity
of modern life. Our work, healthcare, leisure, economy, and
livelihood depend on the constant supply of electrical power.
Even a temporary power outage can lead to relative chaos,
financial setbacks, and possible loss of life. U.S. cities
dangle on electricity and without the constant supply from
the power grid, pandemonium would ensue. Power outages
can be especially tragic when they endanger life-support
systems in hospitals and nursing homes or systems in
synchronization facilities such as in airports, train stations,
and traffic control. In 2004, the economic cost of power
interruptions to U.S. electricity consumers was $79 billion
annually in damages and lost economic activity [1]. In 2017,
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimated power-
interruption costs had increased more than 68% per year
since their 2004 study [2].
Many reasons underlie current power failures. Among
these reasons are severe weather, damage to electric transmission
lines, shortage of circuits, and the aging of the power-grid
infrastructure. Severe weather is the leading cause of power
outages in the United States [3]. In 2018, weather events as
a whole cost U.S. utilities $306 billion: the highest figure
ever recorded by the federal government [4].
The
aging
of
the
grid
infrastructure
is
another
noteworthy
reason
for
power
failures.
In
2008,
the
American Society of Civil Engineers gave the U.S. power-
grid infrastructure an unsatisfactory grade [5]. They stated
in a report that the power-transmission system in the United
States required immediate attention. Furthermore, the report
mentioned that the U.S. electric-power grid is similar to
those of third-world countries. According to the Electric
Power Research Institute, equipment such as transformers
controlling power transmission need to be replaced, as they
have exceeded their expected lifespan considering the
materials’ original design [6].
Electrical outages have three main causes: (1) hardware
and technical failures, (2) the environment, and (3) human
error [7]. Hardware and technical failures are due to equipment
overload, short circuits, brownouts, and blackouts, to name
a few [8]–[10]. These failures are often attributed to unmet
peak usage, outdated equipment, and malfunctioning back-
up power systems. Environment-related causes for power
outages comprise weather, wildlife, and trees that come into
contact with power lines. Lightning, high winds, and ice are
common weather-related power interruptions. Also, squirrels,
snakes, and birds that come in contact with equipment such
as
transformers
and
fuses
can
cause
equipment
to
momentarily fail or shut down completely [8]. As for the
third main cause for electrical outages, human error, the
Uptime Institute estimated that human error causes roughly
70% of the problems that plague data centers. Hacking can
be included in the human-error category [11].
Analytics have been a popular topic in research and
practice, particularly in the energy field. The use of
analytics can help advance Smart Grid reliability by, for
example, elucidating a root cause of power failure, defining
a solution for a blackout through data, or implementing a
solution with continuous monitoring and management. In
this research paper, we aim to unveil the novel use of
location analytics to investigate power-failure events and
their association with population density. In this manuscript,
we use ArcMap software to investigate U.S. power concerns
and to answer the research question, “Is power outage
associated with population density?” The rest of this paper
is organized as follows. Section II presents the literature
review and the research importance. Section III describes
the process of data selection and acquisition. Section IV
addresses research tools and methodology. In Section V, we
discuss our findings.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
The economic cost of power interruptions to U.S.
electricity is $79 billion annually [1]. The year 2018 was
particularly onerous for outages with wildfires in California
and a number of hurricanes that plagued Texas, the
Southeast, and Puerto Rico [12]. When Hurricane Harvey
struck the Gulf Coast in August 2017, about 280,000 people
were without electricity at one point [13]. The report

ENERGY 2019 : The Ninth International Conference on Smart Grids, Green Communications and IT Energy-aware Technologies

specified that the storm took out six transmission lines, 91
circuits, and about 10,000 MW of generation.
When Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017, it impacted
about 5 million customers in districts where Florida Power
& Light operates [14]. Commenting on Hurricane Irma,
energy
journalist
Peter
Maloney
stated,
“Miami-Dade
County was hit hardest. At one point, more than 815,000
people, or 80% of [Florida Power & Light] accounts in the
county, were without power” [15]. According to Maloney,
other jurisdictions in Florida, such as Palm Beach and
Broward County, also lost power in 68–70% of their
accounts due to the hurricane [15]. Figure 1 sketches the
yearly total number of outages in the United States and
people affected since February 16, 2008 [16, p. 3].
Figure 1. Total U.S. Annual Outages and People Affected 2008–2017
In addition, the report offered the pie chart shown in
Figure 2 to break down the 2017 reported power-outage
incidents by cause [16]. In the annual report, power-outage
incidents were grouped into one of eight possible causes.
The number next to each pie piece in Figure 2 is the number
of outages associated with that cause.
Figure 2. U.S. Reported Power Outages by Cause in 2017 [16]
Based on Eaton’s Blackout Tracker [16] and similar
reports that investigate power-outage incidents, key factors
behind these outages can be summarized as shown in Figure
3. In our framework (Figure 3), electrical outages have three
main causes: (1) hardware and technical failures, (2)
environment-related outages, and (3) operation-related failures.
Environment-related incidents comprise the largest
portion
of
power-outage
causes.
Environment-related
incidents can be classified into three distinct categories:
weather, wildlife, and trees. In 2017, Wisconsin Public
Service delineated the weather-related causes of power
outages; a 2005 study by Davies Consulting for the Edison
Electric Institute stated that 70% of power outages in the
United States are weather related [17][18]. In 2014,
Kenward and Raja analyzed power-outage data over a 28-
year period; between 2003 and 2012, 80% of all outages
were caused by weather [19]. Similarly, in 2012, Campbell
highlighted the damage to the electrical grid caused by
seasonal storms, rain, and high winds [20].
Severe weather is the leading cause of power outages in the
United States: “Between 2003 and 2012, an estimated 679
widespread power outages occurred due to severe weather” [3,
p. 3]. Likewise, researchers showed that annual costs changed
significantly and were increasingly greater due to major
storms such as Hurricane Ike in 2008. “Data from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration show that weather-related
outages have increased significantly since 1992” [14, p. 7].
In addition to weather, other external forces create
power outages. Falling tree branches, for example, are
another important cause of power disruption [21]. Animals
coming into contact with power lines, such as large birds,
are also important culprits in power outages in the United
States [16]. Furthermore, human-error incidents cause
power outages. Training is essential for technicians and staff
to battle outages with proper maintenance procedures [7].

a

inconvenience. As the duration and spatial extent of
electricity-system outages increase, costs and inconvenience
grow. Critical social services—such as medical care, police
and other emergency services, and communications systems—
depend on electricity functioning at a minimum. Such
failures can bring about catastrophic outcomes; lives can be
lost. Grid reliability is an area of research that will help to
better explain the causes of outages and aid in prescribing
interventions to improve the reliability of the Smart Grid.
This report explores Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
to correlate population density and power outages in
Georgia. This study aims to address whether power outages
align with population density.
III. DATA SELECTION AND ACQUISITION
A. Power-Outage Data
The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) data
repository includes the primary datasets we used to conduct
this analysis [22]. The data sets include data from advanced
19
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2019.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-713-9
ENERGY 2019 : The Ninth International Conference on Smart Grids, Green Communications and IT Energy-aware Technologies

metering systems, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA)
systems,
GIS,
Outage-Management
Systems
(OMS), Distribution Management Systems (DMS), asset-
management
systems,
work-management
systems,
customer-information systems, and intelligent electronic
device databases. Access to datasets was provided as part of
EPRI’s data-mining initiative, an initiative that provides a
test bed for data exploration and innovation and seeks to
solve major challenges faced by the utility industry [22].
When combined with clever analytic techniques, data
provide the potential to transition to a smarter world, where
the prevention of power outages may become a true reality,
not merely a prediction. The SCADA/OMS/DMS archives
at a power utility offer the required data to identify parts of
the system that contribute most to overall system downtime.
An OMS, for example, provides the data needed to calculate
measurements of system reliability. OMS also provides
historical data that can be mined to find common causes,
failures, and damage. Because OMS has become more
integrated with other operational systems such as GIS on the
utility side, analysis has become more feasible, allowing
researchers to aim to improve grid reliability.
B. Population Data
The U.S. Census Bureau’s 2010 Decennial Census data at
census-block geography is the population data source. The
Research and Analytics Division of the Atlanta Regional
Commission using U.S. Census Bureau Topology Integrated
Geographic Encoding and Referencing/Line files developed
this layer. Polygon features in Census_2010_Blocks_GA are
subsets of Census_Blockgroups and Census_Tracts. A link
to this data source is available here [23].
IV. TOOLS AND METHODOLOGY
We used the following tools to analyze and process data
and explore trends and patterns.
1. ArcGIS, a scalable and secure software-as-a-service program
hosted by the Environmental Systems Research Institute
(ESRI), can process data and visualize the results. The
ArcGIS Spatial Statistics toolbox provides predesigned
statistical tools to analyze spatial distributions and identify
patterns, processes, and relationships [24]. Specifically,
we used the following tools on the ArcGIS platform.
• ArcMap ModelBuilder: Provided by ArcGIS to create,
edit, and manage models. ModelBuilder (Figure 4) can be
viewed as a visual programming language for building
workflows that string together sequences of geoprocessing
tools [25]. We designed three models with ArcMap
ModelBuilder to spatially join the 48 map layers of
weather data from GaSDI and the Georgia GIS
Clearinghouse website with the outage map layer [26].
• Optimized Hot Spot Analysis Tool: Provided by ArcGIS,
the optimized hotspot analysis tool can be useful to
identify statistically significant hot and cold spots of
outages using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, which returns
a z-score for each feature in the dataset. For statistically
significant positive z-scores, a larger z-score implies
more intense clustering of high values (i.e., a hot spot).
For statistically significant negative z-scores, a smaller
z-score implies more intense clustering of low values
(i.e., a cold spot). The Hot Spot Analysis tool calculates
the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic for each feature in a dataset.
The resultant z-score tells where features with either
high or low values cluster spatially. This tool works by
looking at each feature in the context of neighboring
features. A feature with a high value is interesting, but
may not be a statistically significant hot spot. To be a
statistically significant hot spot, a feature has a high
value and is surrounded by other high-value features.
The local sum for a feature and its neighbors is
compared proportionally to the sum of all features; when
the local sum is much different from the expected local
sum, and that difference is too large to be the result of
random chance, a statistically significant z-score results
[27]. Because hot-spot areas are statistically significant,
the end visualization is less subjective [27] (Figure 5).
Figure 4. ArcMap ModelBuilder: Spatially Join Outages With Weather
2. GeoDa: a free software package that conducts spatial
data analysis, geovisualization, spatial autocorrelation,
and spatial modeling. GeoDa has powerful capabilities to
perform spatial analysis, multivariate exploratory data
analysis, and global and local spatial autocorrelation. It
also performs basic linear regression [28].
The project methodology can be divided into seven steps:
1. Load data files from EPRI’s Data Repository [22] to ArcGIS.
• Created a folder (geodata set) and set up local projection
to use Georgia’s projection system.
• Imported the data files from EPRI’s data repository
into the geodata set.
• Imported basemaps (layers, maps, counties, tracks,
roads, etc.) into the geodata set. Sources for Georgia
shapefiles follow:

• Considering the enormous volume of data, a geodatabase
to run more efficiently.
Figure 5. Emerging Hot Spot Analysis Tool [29]
2. Changed the projection of all maps to the World
Geodetic System 1984 projection system. This step was
necessary to perform calculations using ESRI or Google
Earth tools.
• Used Arc toolbox project (data management tools:
Projection & Transformation) to change the projection.
3. Cleaned the outage-events map layer to exclude records
that do not have a location (longitude and latitude).
4. Defined and created a study area for the project. Study
areas are geographic boundaries to define the extent of
analysis. They are typically created when starting a
project to ensure the data are confined to a specified area.
Only layers in the study area are considered in an
analysis, so a study area can enhance processing time.
Researchers use two methods or tools to create a smaller
subset of data from a larger data set.
• One way is to select a portion of an existing shape file and
create a new layer file from it (or export that to a new
shape file) using the ArcGIS select-by-location tool.
• The other way is to clip an existing shape file using
another polygon-shaped file (like using a cookie cutter)
to create a new clipped version of the original shape
file—ArcGIS Clip (analysis) tool (Figures 6 and 7).
Figure 6. Clip Tool [30]
5. Selected data by block where population and power
outage events intersect. This step ensures elimination of
the impact of missing data.
6. Ran optimized hot-spot analysis to generate a map
(Figure 8) of statistically noteworthy hot and cold spots
of population using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic.

7. The final step is to investigate where population hot
spots fall compared to the locations of optimized hot
spots of power outage (Figure 9) and draw a conclusion.

V. RESULTS & DISCUSSION
From a visual comparison of the two maps, the majority
of population hot spots fall in one big area of hot spots in
Clayton and Fulton Counties where power outages are
statistically significant. The only exception is the population
hot spot in Henry County and south Clayton County where
no statistically significant outages occurred (Figure 10).
Figure 10. Population Hot Spots Outside Statistically Significant Outage Areas
It appears that, due to the Underground (UG) structures
used there, these population hot spots do not show
statistically
significant
outages.
UGs
contributed
to
lessening the number of power-outage events so this high-
population area is not an outage hot spot (Figure 11).
Figure 11. Underground Structures in Henry and South Clayton Counties
The GIS data has a field (CONSTRUCTION_TYPE)
that helps identify UG versus Overhead (OH) assets in the
DMI data. Also, the OMS of work-management data contains
a field (srv loc) that specifies if the location is OH or UG.
VI. CONCLUSION
This study aimed to address how location analytics enhance
understanding of power outages. To answer the research question,
we explored GIS and aimed to identify a correlation between
population density and power outages in Georgia. Initial
investigation, using ArcMap software as a visualization tool,
revealed areas where an association emerged between
power-outage events and population density.
The GIS model presented in this study can help advance
smart-grid reliability by, for example, revealing a root cause
of power failure, defining a solution for a blackout through
data, or implementing a solution with continuous monitoring
and management. In this study, we show the novel use of
location analytics to enhance power-outage understanding.
Future research should include analysis in ArcGIS Pro,
which is ESRI’s next-generation desktop GIS product that
provides professional 2D and 3D mapping and added tools
to advanced visualization, analytics, and imaging.
From this research, we conclude that GIS offers a
solution to analyze the electric-grid distribution system. Our
model provides evidence that GIS can perform the analysis
to investigate power-failure events and their causes. If
additional funds and data become available, researchers can
expand on this analysis, build on ArcMap source code, and
create a custom solution for the utility industry to control
and forecast power outages. GIS can be a main resource to
assist electronic inspection systems, to lower the duration of
customer outages, to improve crew-response time, and to
reduce labor and overtime costs.
