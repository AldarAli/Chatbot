Abstract—In agriculture, image mosaics of forest and crop areas
help different applications in precision farming that need to
answer quickly. This work aims to show a different idea about
image mosaic construction using heterogeneous computing in
order to decrease the computational cost and giving a faster
answer to the farmer about his crop.

INTRODUCTION
Tarallo et al. [1] describe that by using mosaics in agriculture
is possible to perform direct ﬁeld inspections either during the
growing cycle or days after the harvest, providing an accurate
diagnosis of the growing area. From there, it is possible to
draw recommendation maps: decompression, fertility and input
application at variable rate.
The main problem for any image mosaic construction is
associated with the images features. Scale Invariant Features
Transform (SIFT) algorithm [2][3] is used to extract features
from an image that it will be matching with features extracted
form another image. This process has a higher computational
effort in image mosaic construction. Heterogeneous computing
can contribute to the mosaic construction by reducing the
computational effort.
Advanced Micro Devices [4] deﬁnes heterogeneous com-
puting as a system that is composed by one or more kind
of processor, including Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), besides conventional
Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Digital Signal Processors
(DSP). According to Kauer et al. [5], heterogeneous architec-
ture has gained much space in the high performance computing
area. This is due to the popularization of increasingly efﬁcient
graphics processors, that are every day more present in Single
Board Computer (SBC). An SBC [6] is a computer where all
necessary electronics components for its operation are on the
same board. It is very useful in robotics applications, control
system, automation and others.
This paper aims to introduce a new idea about image
mosaic construction using heterogeneous computing, where
SIFT algorithm will be implemented in GPU in order to reduce
the computational effort. The paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, it is described the Inforce 6540 SBC architecture
and the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform. In Section III, the

initial results are presented, and the conclusion and future
works are described in Section IV.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
A. Inforce 6540 SBC (IFC6540)
IFC6540 is an SBC manufactured by Inforce Computing [7].
It is based on the ﬁrst commercial processor with support for
4k Ultra HD technology, the Snapdragon 805 (APQ8084).
Figure 1 shows all the electronic components that IFC6540
provides for user.
Snapdragon 805 (APQ8084) is a processor developed by
Qualcomm [8] in order to work with the technology 4K Ultra
HD with capture, reproduction and video output 4K on mobile
devices. This chip integrates connectivity and heterogeneous
computing. In heterogeneous computing encapsulated in this
chip, stands out:
•
Quad core Krait 450 CPU 2.7GHz per core
•
Adreno 420 GPU @4.8 Pixels/second
•
Hexagon DSP v50 @600MHz
Figure 2 shows the Snapdragon 805 processor and its main
components.
B. Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)
SIFT [2][3] is a method for extracting distinctive invariant
features from images that can be used to perform reliable
matching between different views of an object or scene. The

features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are
shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range
of afﬁne distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise,
and change in illumination.
Lowe [2] describes four main steps used to generate the
features in images. They are:
1) Scale-space extrema detection: This step aims to identify
keyponts candidates that are invariant to scale and orientation.
This is the most expensive process of all SIFT algorithm,
because the original image is progressively blurred using Gaus-
sian Blur and then the difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) function
is applied.
2) Keypoint localization: By measuring the stability of key-
point, it is possible to determine the scale and location.
3) Orientation assignment: In this step, for each keypoint is
assigned one or more orientation data based on local image
gradient direction. This step aims to achieve invariance to
rotation as the keypoint descriptor can be represented relative
to this orientation.
4) Keypoint descriptor: Local gradients are measured around
each keypoint to allow signiﬁcant bright changes.
In this work, this method is used to attach different images
where the keypoints are the same.
For this paper, there were two steps implemented based on
Lowe’s deﬁnition [2] as described early: step 1 (Scale-space
extrema detection) and step 2 (Keypoint localization).
The partial implementation is shown in next section.
III.
INITIAL RESULTS
C++ programing language together with an open source
computer vision library called OpenCV [9] were used for SIFT
algorithm implementation. This library provides some ready
image functions like Gaussian ﬁlter (image convolution) and
others functions.
Figure 3a shows an agriculture aerial image, registered using
an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and Figure 3b shows the
partial SIFT algorithm implemented where it is possible see
the keypoint candidates after execution using processor Quad
core Krait 450 CPU 2.7GHz of the SBC IFC6540.
IV.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
This work is at the beginning. The ﬁrst two SIFT steps, based
on Lowes deﬁnition [2], were implemented and tested on a
SBC IFC6540 board. The partial results are promising and it
was possible to determine the scale and location of keypoints
candidates, as shown in Figure 3b.
Figure 3. a) Original Image b) Keypoints Candidates.
All the steps will be implemented using the language
OpenCL [10] to explore heterogeneous computing, transferring
some functions to be processed on Adreno 420 GPU. The
algorithm will also be optimized to improve performance,
since the SIFT has higher computational cost in image mosaic
construction, making it possible to obtain mosaic images on
the ﬂy.
