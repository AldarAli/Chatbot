Abstract—There is an increase in use of reference architectures 
to support software development activities for building 
distributed systems. Reference architectures are helpful tools 
to understand and specify functionalizes of a distributed system 
at a higher abstraction level. From a security standpoint, a 
distributed system’s reference architecture is one of the 
potential starting point to study security threats and their 
characteristics. Both academia and industry have proposed a 
number of Security Reference Architectures (SRAs), which are 
reference architectures specifying a conceptual model of 
security for a system and they provide a mechanism to specify 
security requirements. The main objective of this work is to 
investigate and better understand how security reference 
architecture support building secure distributed software 
applications. In order to meet our goal, we conducted a 
systematic mapping study to identify the primary studies 
related to SRA for distributed software development. We used 
customized search terms, derived from our research question, 
to identify literature on SRA for distributed systems. We 
identified that a significant number of SRAs have been 
developed first for defense against one or few specific types of 
security attacks. There is also a focus on developing SRAs to 
satisfy a security objective during development of distributed 
systems. Based on the systematic mapping study results, we 
suggest that there is a need to develop SRAs that help system 
developers simultaneously enumerate different types of 
security threats and systematically help to decide where we 
should add corresponding security patterns to mitigate them.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The past several years have seen tremendous changes in 
distributed software development due to introduction of web 
2.0 technologies [14], service oriented architectures [15] and 
cloud computing systems [16]. These distributed system 
development technologies have brought with them several 
new and complex security threats and challenges. To 
holistically study security of these large and complex 
distributed systems, we need to start our security analysis 
from their security reference architectures [1].  
A security reference architecture is a reference 
architecture where security mechanisms have been added in 
appropriate places to provide some degree of security [1]. 
Furthermore, a reference architecture is an abstract system 
architecture that describes system functionalities without any 
implementation details [1]. Reference architectures are useful 
to specify main features of a system. 
A number of SRAs have been proposed by both academia 
and industry vendors. For example, Chonka et al. [2] report a 
technique that is used to observe and discover denial of 
service attacks against cloud systems. Okuhara et al. [3] 
report Fujitsu’s security architecture, which logically 
separates computational environments, authentication and 
identify management. Similarly, Oracle developed a SRA 
[4], which addresses data security, fraud detection and 
compliance with reference to their products.  
The literature on SRAs provides a wealth of information 
on how to analyze security of a system for individual attacks, 
model system for a security objective(s) or how to help 
systems meet security compliance requirements of a 
government organization. For example, Bahmani et al. [5] 
compared 
different 
enterprise 
information 
security 
architecture frameworks with reference to interoperability 
feature.  Lately, Modi et al. [6] presented a survey of intrusion 
detection techniques in cloud computing systems.   
However, there is a lack of systematic investigation of the 
literature covering SRA in distributed systems. The aim of 
this systematic mapping study is to collate knowledge to 
better understand how SRAs have supported system security 
and identify in what ways it has been applied in the industry.  
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section II presents the related work. The research 
methodology is outlined in Section III. In Section IV, we 
present and discuss the initial results. Section V discusses the 
limitation of our study. Finally, the conclusion is presented in 
Section VI. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Security is a fundamental concern in any distributed 
system and a number of security reference architectures have 
been proposed by industry and researchers’ community. 
Majority of security reference architectures have been 
proposed for a particular attack type. There has been 
significant focus on developing SRAs to mitigate attacks 
such as denial of service [22], Internet protocol spoofing and 
denial of service [23].   
On the other hand, researchers have also focused on 
developing security objective specific SRA. For example, 
Hafner et al. [10] have used enterprise patterns to develop 
secure services for cloud computing systems. Lombardi and 
Pietro [11] used virtualization to propose an architecture for 
cloud protection that monitors middleware integrity. 
Even though extensive research has been carried out in 
the security reference architecture domain, it is necessary to

assess the current state of research and practice, and provide 
practitioners with evidence that enables fostering future 
research directions. To the best of our knowledge, there is a 
lack of systematic investigation of the literature covering 
SRA in distributed systems. 
III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
In order to address the research question, we applied 
Systematic mapping study and literature review [7] approach. 
A systematic mapping study and literature review is a 
technique to identify, analyze and interpret relevant 
published primary studies with reference to a specific 
research 
question. 
Systematic 
mapping 
studies 
are 
recommended as a review methodology [7] because they 
allow the researchers to systematically summarize existing 
evidence from literature, identify research gaps and provide 
a framework to position future research activities [13].  
A systematic mapping study protocol consists of five 
main phases, as shown in Figure 1. In the first phase of our 
study, we formulated a research question as follows: 
 
RQ1: How is security reference architecture supporting 
development of distributed systems? 
 
Next, we constructed the search strategy in line with our 
research question and performed the search for relevant 
publications. In the third phase, the identified relevant 
publications were scrutinized to ensure their relevance. In the 
fourth phase, the selected studies were evaluated based on the 
quality assessment criteria. In the last phase, data was 
extracted from selected studies for further analysis and 
assessment. 
A. Search Strategy 
The search strategy for the systematic mapping study is 
based on the steps as follows: 
 
Derive 
the 
search 
terms 
from 
population, 
intervention and outcomes.  
 
Identify alternative spellings and synonyms for 
major terms.  
 
Use Boolean ‘OR’ and ‘AND’ operators. 
 
Verify the derived search term in major academic 
repositories. 
 
 
Figure 1. Systematic Mapping Study Major Process Phases. 
 
We constructed the following search terms based on our 
search strategy: 
 
POPULATION: 
Distributed 
systems, 
Cloud 
systems, Service-oriented Architecture. 
 
INTERVENTION: Security Methodology. 
 
OUTCOME 
OF 
RELEVANCE: 
Different 
techniques to mitigate security in reference 
architecture, classification of SRAs. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Systematic literature 
reviews and empirical studies. 
 
We validated our search terms in major academic 
databases in a scoping study.  The following search terms 
show potential relevance to the research question as follows: 
 
 
SECURITY 
REFERENCE 
ARCHITECTURE: 
Security Architecture OR Security Reference 
Architecture OR Security Design OR Security 
Architecture Design, Security Patterns; AND 
 
DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM: Distributed Systems OR 
Cloud Systems OR Service-oriented Architecture 
OR Grid Systems; AND 
 
TECHNIQUE: Technique OR Method OR Model 
OR Design. 
 
The relevant studies retrieved through the initial search 
string were used as a guide for the development and 
validation of the final search string. In the scoping study, we 
used some relevant publications, which we had previously 
identified to cross check the validity of the search terms. A 
broad search was conducted between February 2015 and May 
2015 to identify relevant articles published (or available on-
line) up to May 2015.  
 
B. Publication Selection 
The following inclusion criteria were used: 
 
 
Peer-reviewed studies. 
 
Papers focus on answering our research question. 
 
Papers published in English. 
 
We applied the exclusion criteria as follows:  
 
 
Papers that are not published in English.  
 
Papers with no link with the research question. 
 
Grey 
publications, 
that 
is, 
papers 
without 
bibliographic information.  
 
In the case of duplicate papers, the most complete 
version published. 
 
Next, each paper was evaluated against the quality 
assessment criteria shown in Table 1. Each quality 
assessment criterion has two answers: ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ with 
scores of ‘1’ and ‘0’, respectively. The sum of the quality 
criteria resulted in the quality score for a particular paper. In 
this study, we only consider publications with a quality score 
greater than 75%. As a result, 58 papers were finally selected, 
which met the inclusion and quality assessment criteria.

The total number of results retrieved using the search 
terms in the electronic databases are shown in Table 2. After 
the initial round of screening by reading the title and abstract, 
seventy one studies belonging to different electronic research 
databases were selected. After full text readings in the second 
screening and quality assessment, 58 primary studies were 
finally selected. Figure 2 shows temporal view of the selected 
articles from the systematic review, sorted by year of 
publication. Appendix A presents the primary studies in the 
review.

To answer the research question, the data was carefully 
extracted and synthesized from the 58 finally selected 
primary studies. We classified SRAs into four main 
categories as shown in Table 3.   
In our study, the most highly cited category is ‘attack 
specific SRA’ (60%). Distributed system infrastructure uses 
virtualization techniques and provide their services through 
standard internet protocols [6]. Distributed systems are 
vulnerable to traditional security attacks such as Internet 
protocol spoofing, routing information protocol attacks, 
denial of service attacks, etc. Hence, there has been a 
significant focus on developing SRAs to incorporate specific 
attack detection and prevention mechanisms in distributed 
system infrastructure to mitigate security attacks. Table 4 
shows a list of popular types of attacks addressed by 
researchers and industry practitioners.  
 
 
Figure 2. Temporal view of studies 
‘Security objective specific SRA’ is the second highly 
cited category (reported by 34 % of the articles selected from 
the systematic mapping study and review). Researchers have 
also considered developing SRAs oriented to some specific 
security objectives. For example, Hafner et al. [10] have used 
enterprise patterns to develop secure services for cloud 
computing systems. Lombardi and Pietro [11] used 
virtualization to propose an architecture for cloud protection 
that monitors middleware integrity. Lately, Fernandez et al. 
[1] presented a method to build a SRA for cloud systems 
using security patterns and misuse patterns.

It is important to note that over the years, a significant 
number of SRAs have been developed by industry vendors. 
All major industrial vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, 
Cisco, VMware and Amazon have developed SRAs for their 
product range. However, in our study, we have not included 
them as primary studies because most of vendor specific 
SRAs are available in form of white papers, which do not 
satisfy our inclusion criteria, as mentioned in Section 2. 
Hence, we have included only on primary study regarding 
Fujistu’s SRA reported by Okuhara et al. [3].  
V. LIMITATIONS 
Similarly to any systematic mapping study and literature 
review, our results also depend on the used keywords and the 
limitations of the search engines. In order to limit the risk of 
incompleteness in keywords lists, we used alternative 
spellings and synonyms to build the search terms.  
Application of inclusion, exclusion criteria and primary 
study selection process are also subject to threats to validity 
of the study. In order to mitigate this threat, all systematic 
mapping study phases were carried out iteratively with 
continuous feedback from authors of the paper.    
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we conducted a systematic mapping study 
to investigate the use of SRA to support development of 
distributed systems. Fifty eight studies were finally included, 
which were further classified into four categories, namely, 
‘attack specific SRA’, ‘security objective specific SRA’, 
‘industry specific SRA’ and ‘vendor specific SRA’.  
Through this systematic mapping study, we identified that 
researchers have mainly focused on developing SRAs for one 
or group of individual security attacks. There also has been a 
focus on developing SRAs oriented to security objectives 
such as monitoring data and using security patterns to add 
security mechanisms at appropriate components of a system.  
We believe that the results presented in our systematic 
mapping study and review can be useful for software 
engineering community as it provides an initial body of 
knowledge regarding SRAs. In the future, we intend to 
expand this systematic review to further analyze individual 
categories and discuss highly cited types of attacks and 
security objectives in the literature. Another area for future 
work is to empirically study different industry vendor SRAs 
and their impact on improving security of distributed 
systems.
