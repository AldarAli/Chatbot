Abstract—Perception of biological movements is integral to 
one’s ability to interpret actions of others. In the present study, 
we conducted a comparative analysis of neural responses in a 
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) setting during 
visual perception of biological movement within a social 
context (which has not been studied yet) as opposed to a non-
biological baseline stimulus. Our results demonstrate right 
lateralization of superior temporal Region Of Interest (ROI), 
likely 
reflecting 
the 
underlying 
differences 
in 
social 
characteristics of each given stimulus.  
Keywords - functional magnetic resonance imaging; 
movement perception; biological movement; social movement. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The movements of living beings provide rich and 
meaningful information that facilitates social interaction. 
Despite improved understanding of the brain regions 
involved in social behavior and its perception, the details of 
neural representations require further experimental and 
theoretical work. The neurofunctional differences between 
different types of biological movement may serve for 
interpretation of one’s immediate intentions. This study 
comprised a comparative analysis of neural responses in an 
fMRI setting during visual perception of different types of 
biological movement with and without social context. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 
II, we present the methods. In Section III, we show the 
results. In Section IV, we discuss the outcomes. Finally, 
Section V concludes the work. 
II. 
METHODS 
20 healthy subjects aged 21 to 31, IQ > 85, were scanned 
on a 3-T Prisma scanner at the National Institute of Mental 
Health in Klecany, Czech Republic. The study was 
approved by the local ethical committee. The fMRI block 
design paradigm included two sessions with all stimuli 
presented twice; the order of stimuli was counterbalanced 
across subjects. All participants observed three types of 
biological movement within different social contexts (single 
hand, fist, and a handshake) and a control stimulus (a 
stationary cross).  
Data analysis was executed in the Statistical Parametric 
Mapping (SPM) software [1]. Whole brain analysis as well 
as ROI analysis were applied to address brain activations 
under each condition. The areas selected for the ROI analysis 
(precentral, superior, and inferior temporal and parietal gyrus 
bilaterally) were based on predefined brain structures that are 
involved in movement processing as well as social 
perception [2][3]. 
III. 
RESULTS 
A. Whole Brain Analysis 
The observation of all stimuli elicited activation in the 
frontal, parietal, and occipital-temporal regions involved in 
visual movement perception (see Table 1). Bigger cluster 
size and a higher Z-score correspond to increased activity in 
the peak area. 
B. ROI analysis 
ROI-based analysis highlighted cluster differences. 
Figures 1-3 depict the activation pattern overlap upon 
presenting the biological stimuli. The inferior parietal (Fig.2) 
and the precentral gyrus (Fig.1) were more active in the left 
hemisphere, while the superior temporal gyrus (Fig.3) 
showed right lateralization. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The current study compared neural responses of three 
types 
of 
biological 
movement. 
Right 
hemisphere 
lateralization was previously documented [4], and the brain

areas that elicited higher activity go in line with several 
studies [4][5]. However, Sokolov et al. [6] did not find 
substantial activation in the inferior parietal gyrus, contrary 
to our findings, likely due to the difference between 
presented stimuli. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Our results showed that the right-lateralized superior 
temporal ROIs were more selective in response to the 
presented visual cues, likely reflecting the underlying 
differences in social characteristics of each given stimulus. 
This provides further insight into the neurobiology of social 
movement perception and may serve as a baseline for future 
studies.
