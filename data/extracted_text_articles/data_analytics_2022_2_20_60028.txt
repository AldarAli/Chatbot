Abstract – Data driven manufacturing quality management 
using machine learning for error detection can leverage 
predictive models for error analysis. Quality engineer experts 
evaluate the models input and interpret important features in 
the context of the specific manufacturing domain. In this paper, 
we propose three heuristics to determine the importance of 
features leading to actionable insights for error analysis. All 
proposed metrics are illustrated on synthetic data and evaluated 
on a real-world dataset.  
Keywords – manufacturing quality management; error 
analysis; feature importance; Shapley Values; xAI; machine

INTRODUCTION  
 
Quality management in modern manufacturing processes 
involves extensive testing and collection of detailed 
measurements along production lines. This provides the basis 
for data driven error analysis. However, quality managers 
struggle with finding error causes in large sets of quality data 
[1]. Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods can help to analyze 
such data and predict errors [2]. In combination with 
eXplainable AI (xAI), predictive models can further put 
quality engineers on the right track for finding causes of 
production errors. That is, feature importance metrics can 
reveal features that hint at error causes [3]. However, well 
known feature importance measures are not tailored to this 
task. In this paper, we expand our earlier work [4] and 
introduce new feature importance measures which are 
designed to reveal features of interest for quality management 
in manufacturing. 
 
Our work is rooted in a research project with a German 
manufacturer [5]. Here, we found that combining human 
expertise with AI-based data analysis is desirable for error 
analysis in production lines. This is because (a) quality 
managers seek to understand the error causes and may not 
blindly trust AI-based results and (b) human experts have 
background knowledge and a deep understanding of the 
production process, that the AI does not have access to. Hence, 
this work explicitly keeps the human experts in the loop and 
focuses on using AI models for providing input to human 
analysts. 
 
This work targets typical manufacturing setups, where 
production lines comprise a sequence of production steps and 
several test stations along the production line. Test stations 
perform measurements on each product at different steps of 
the production. This leads to detailed records of individual 
product instances that can include hundreds of thousands of 
measurements per product [6]. However, the high number of 
different measurements poses challenges for finding causes of 
errors in the data. Another challenge in error cause analysis is 
that errors are rare [7]. Modern manufacturing processes are 
usually highly optimized and quality management is often 
about driving down rare – but still costly – errors. Yet, existing 
applications have successfully used such high dimensional 
and imbalanced data to build AI models for predicting 
production errors [6][8]. The aim of such models is to take 
measurements from test stations early in the production 
sequence and predict errors that occur downstream in the 
production line. If errors can be predicted early with sufficient 
reliability, products can be removed early in the process and 
costs for downstream production steps can be avoided [2].  
 
Furthermore, such AI models can be analyzed to hint at the 
cause of errors. We leverage this to provide insights to human 
experts in quality management. Existing works use feature 
importance measures to identify quality measurements that 
are relevant in predicting and explaining errors. For example, 
if a heat measurement of an oven is important in predicting 
errors, then errors may be avoided by adjusting the 
temperature 
setting. 
Identifying 
such 
interesting 
measurements amongst the thousands of data points can help 
quality managers to find error causes and improve production 
[9]. However, existing importance measures are not tailored 
to find features that are interesting for inspection in error cause 
analysis. Instead, they take a global view and capture how 
much a model relies on a given feature on average. As we 
show in this paper, such a global view is often not useful when 
it comes to spotting rare but strong relations that lead to 
actionable insight in error analysis.  
 
In contrast to global importance measures, xAI methods 
like Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) [10] and LIME 
[12] provide local explanations for the impact of features on a 
prediction. That is, the impact of features can be estimated for 
individual data instances. However, analyzing a data instance 
in isolation is of little use for quality management in 
manufacturing. That is, a single data instance is not enough to 
draw conclusions for actionable insights. 
 
With this work, we provide feature importance measures 
that are conceptually in between global and local feature 
importance. We refer to this as regional feature importance. 
With this concept we setup on and expand our earlier work 
[4]. That is, we analyze sets of local feature importance values 
for interesting effects. The result of this analysis is captured in 
new importance measures that capture different interesting 
aspects. In this paper, we mathematically define our applied 
notion of interestingness. Intuitively, we consider a feature

interesting if it hints at actionable insight for quality managers. 
Such an action could be setting a threshold in a quality check 
or adjusting the process to avoid certain value ranges. 
Intuitively, drastic changes in error rates and high error rates 
in well-defined parts of a value range make features 
interesting. In this paper, we provide importance measures 
that formally capture such notions of interestingness and map 
them to an importance score. In summary, we make the 
following key contributions: 
1) 
We introduce and formally define novel feature 
importance measures that are tailored to find relevant 
features in manufacturing quality management.  
2) 
We test and illustrate the benefits of our proposed 
measures with synthetic data. 
3) 
We evaluate the proposed measures on real-world 
data and compare them with established importance 
measures. 
 
With these contributions, we help human experts in quality 
management better leverage results from AI models for 
driving their analysis. 
 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In 
Section II, we briefly summarize the corresponding 
background. In Section III, approaches to derive the regional 
feature importance are proposed which then are evaluated in a 
real-world dataset in Section IV. In Section V, we discuss 
related work and conclude in Section VI. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
 
When using Machine Learning (ML) support for error 
analysis 
in 
quality 
management 
processes, 
feature 
importance metrics can become a tool to rank and identify 
features that are suitable to guide Quality Engineers (QE) in 
finding error causes in production. Such a process inspired 
the present work is carried out in the production of an 
industry partner in the research project [4]. ML-driven quality 
management processes here focus on QEs as primary actors. 
Using ML support, QEs are intended to analyze production 
and take corrective maintenance steps in production. 
However, the development and deployment of models for the 
ML support system are embedded in automated pipelines and 
maintained by data scientists. The automated ML pipeline 
includes several steps like data preprocessing, i.e., feature 
selection or evaluation of model performances through cost-
sensitive metrics [2]. As such, the system is designed to 
enable QEs to use ML support for error causes analysis, but 
not to be engaged with the technical depth of the ML system. 
 
A reference process focusing on QEs intended to 
investigate errors in production is laid out in [1]. Key steps 
include the selection of production data for the automated ML 
pipeline. Later steps involve error identification and 
correction in production using ML support. To identify error 
causes the QE is intended to use feature importance to find 
features that suits as explanations for error causes. 
 
SHAP is one of the more recent advancements in the field 
of xAI, focusing on the interpretability of ML models. SHAP 
targets instance-based as opposed to global model 
explanation. By aggregating explanations of instances, it is 
possible to evaluate the importance of features incorporating 
aspects of interest to guide QEs in error cause analysis [3]. 
SHAP evaluates the marginal contribution a feature has on its 
model output. The contribution 𝜙𝑓 ∈ ℝ for a feature 𝑓 with 
model 𝑚  is attributed using Shapley Values from game 
theory: 
𝜙𝑓 =
∑
|𝑆|! (𝑀 − |𝑆| − 1)!
𝑀!
𝑆⊆𝑁\{𝑓}
[𝑚𝑥(𝑆 ∪ {𝑓}) − 𝑚𝑥(𝑆)], 
where 𝑀 is the number of all features, S is the set of input 
values, and |S| is the magnitude of S (for example, 𝑆 =
 𝑥1, 𝑥2, … , 𝑥𝑓−1, 𝑥𝑓+1, 𝑥𝑛 and |𝑆| = 𝑛 − 1 ). To compute the 
feature contribution usually the explanation model 𝑒(𝑧′) =
𝜙0 + ∑
𝜙𝑓𝑧𝑓
′
𝑀
𝑓=1
 where 𝑧′ ∈ {0,1}𝑀  is used. This is the 
weighted average over all feature contributions. The 
explanation model is computed using the mapping 𝑚𝑥(𝑆) =
𝑚(𝑒𝑥(𝑧′)) which maps all input values 𝑆  to whether the 
feature is being used (𝑧′ = 1) or not known (𝑧′ = 0).  
 
In an earlier work [4], we already picked up the idea of 
Shapley Value based heuristics to determine importance 
measures leading to helpful insights for quality engineering. 
For completeness, the main ideas are briefly summarized 
below. 
 
Max-SHAP: The Max-SHAP heuristic focuses on the 
maximal SHAP values and ranks the features according to 
their maximum SHAP value. The intuition behind this metric 
is that a feature showing a high SHAP value for an error 
instance is a good explanation. Formally, Max-SHAP is 
defined as: 
𝑀𝑎𝑥 𝑆𝐻𝐴𝑃𝑓(𝑚, 𝑆) = max {𝜙𝑓(𝑚, 𝑥)|𝑥 ∈ 𝑆} 
 
Max-Main: This metric focuses similarly to the Max-
SHAP on maximal values but in contrast, the maximum of 
the SHAP main effects is assessed. The intuition is that a 
feature with high main effects is considered a good 
explanation. SHAP main effects do not include interactions 
between features and therefore are the single most simple 
explanation for an error case. The Max-Main metric is 
defined as: 
𝑀𝑎𝑥 𝑀𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑓(𝑚, 𝑆) = 
max {𝜙𝑓(𝑚, 𝑥) − ∑
𝜙𝑓,𝑗(𝑚, 𝑥)|
𝑗≠𝑓
|𝑥 ∈ 𝑆} 
 
Range-SHAP: Considering a change in SHAP values over 
the feature value range, the feature with a bigger change is 
considered more interesting. The intuition is that features 
with varying contributions are more likely to indicate error 
cases. The Range-SHAP metric is defined as: 
𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 𝑆𝐻𝐴𝑃𝑓(𝑚, 𝑆) = 
max {𝜙𝑓(𝑚, 𝑥)|𝑥 ∈ 𝑆} − min {𝜙𝑓(𝑚, 𝑥)|𝑥 ∈ 𝑆} 
III. 
AGGREGATIONS OF SHAP VALUES TO ASSESS REGIONAL 
FEATURE IMPORTANCE 
 
We aim to identify features that are helpful in finding 
error causes in production. Production errors are rare events 
because of the optimized production process. Many error 
occurrences are of random nature. However, some have a 
clear cause which is captured in the data. Features that reflect 
these error events are hints to causes and therefore should be 
rewarded with high importance scores. The fundamental idea 
is a scoring-function g: g(f, X, …)→ ℝ that aggregates SHAP 
values and scores „interesting“ features high. Here, we refer 
20

to f  as the target feature used in the analysis with the dataset 
𝑋, and … represents the use of additional parameters which 
are unique to each approach later proposed. We further refer 
to 𝜙𝑓(𝑥) as SHAP values of the feature 𝑓 computed on the 
data instance 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and define 𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋) =
1
|𝑋| ∑
𝑥∈𝑋 𝜙(𝑥)
 as the 
SHAP value mean. 
 
In the following, three approaches to assess the 
importance score 𝑔 are proposed. For each approach first, the 
basic concept is described and then the idea is illustrated 
using synthetic sample data where the ground truth is known. 
In all illustrations, the error cause can be attributed to features 
A, B or random occurrences affecting 1% of the data. We then 
train an XGBoost classifier [12] for error prediction on the 
110,000 data points and compare the importance metrics 𝑔 
with the classic state-of-the-art importance measures 
implemented in the XGBoost library (v1.3.3). All illustration 
results are listed in Tables 1 to 3 and reported as the rank of 
the feature with mean score and standard deviations 
(mean/standard deviation) in brackets. Mean and standard 
deviations are based on the 15 repetitions the illustrations 
were conducted. 
A) Outlier-Approach 
 
The intuition behind this approach is that features with 
abnormal SHAP values are potentially interesting. Therefore, 
we perform anomaly detection on the distribution of SHAP 
values and assess the SHAP values for abnormal data points. 
For simplicity, we assume that the SHAP values 
approximately form a normal distribution. The outliers then 
can be detected using mean and standard deviation where the 
less interesting SHAP values are around the expectation 
value. However, other anomaly detection methods may be 
used as alternatives. Assuming a normal distribution, we 
detect increased SHAP values by determining the SHAP 
values outside of the normal distribution with at least 𝜆 
standard deviations 𝜎(𝜙𝑓(𝑋)) above the SHAP value mean 
𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋). The importance score 𝑔 is formally defined as the 
sum 
over 
all 
outliers outl(λ, X) = { 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 |𝜙𝑓(𝑥) ≥
𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋) + 𝜆 𝜎(𝜙𝑓(𝑋))} as: 
𝑔(𝑓, 𝑋, 𝜆 ) =
∑
𝜙𝑓(𝑥′)
𝑥′∈ outl(λ,X)
 
Note, 𝜙𝑓(𝑥′)  refers to the SHAP values for feature 𝑓 
computed on data instances 𝑥’ where the set outl(λ, X) only 
includes outliers λ standard deviations above the SHAP value 
mean. The concept is that we consider high SHAP values as 
interesting because high SHAP values provide a strong 
indication for errors and therefore hint at error causes. 
 
To illustrate the Outlier-Approach, we now compare the 
approach with state-of-the-art feature importance measures 
implemented in the XGBoost library using synthetic data. 
Metric 𝑔 is computed with 𝜆 = 2 considering SHAP values 
2𝜎  above the features SHAP value mean. As data, we 
consider the following dataset: Feature A causes a small 
number of errors within a small value range, i.e., an 8% error 
rate within a 0.025 quantile range. Feature B causes a 
decreasing error rate from 4% to 3% over the feature value in 
a 0.8 quantile range. Thus, feature B has a lower error rate but 
within a much broader range than feature A. In this situation, 
we consider feature A with its strong (albeit rare) relation to 
error events- as more interesting.  
 
The illustration result listed in Table 1 shows the proposed 
approach Outlier Shap ranks feature A as more important 
while the classic importance measures do not. That is, all 
measures except Weight rank feature B higher than A. Note, 
Weight scores feature A and B very similar. Both features 
show a difference in mean scores of 19.8 and considering the 
standard deviations of more than 33.6 both scores of feature 
A and B are almost equal. Therefore, Weight does not rank 
feature A clearly higher. Thus, only the proposed Outlier 
Shap is reliable and detects the more important feature A 
correctly.

B) Micro-Average Approach 
 
The intuition behind this approach is that features are of 
interest if they show high SHAP values within a small feature 
value range. Therefore, we divide the feature value range into 
equally sized partitions and determine the average SHAP 
value of each interval. The importance score 𝑔  is then 
determined as the maximum average SHAP value of all 
intervals belonging to the given feature. Formally the 
importance score is defined as the maximal average SHAP 
value max{𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋𝑖)} where 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋𝑖 of interval 𝑖 comprises the 
datapoints 𝑋i  = {𝑥 ∈ 𝑋| (𝑖 ∗ 𝑑) ≤ 𝑥 < (𝑖 ∗ 𝑑) + 𝑑} over the 
equally sized feature range 𝑑 =
1
𝑛 ∗ 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒(𝑋𝑓) for the set of 
feature values 𝑋𝑓 and given number of intervals 𝑛: 
𝑔(𝑓, 𝑋, 𝑛) = max{𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋𝑖) | 𝑖 = 0, … , 𝑛 − 1}  
 
Note, 𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋𝑖) refers here to the mean SHAP value of 
interval 𝑖  for given number of intervals 𝑛 . We consider 
intervals with higher SHAP values as more important. The 
concept is that the higher the average SHAP value within an 
interval, the more important this interval is for the 
contribution to error events. 
 
An illustration of this approach is an increased error ratio 
in a tail of a normal distributed feature. Consider the normally 
distributed 𝑁(0,1) features A and B. Feature A causes a 10% 
error rate in the upper tail of the feature range. Feature B 
causes a slightly decreasing error rate of 4% to 3% from the 
0.3 to the 0.7 feature value quantile. We argue that feature A 
– even though it explains fewer errors - is more interesting 
because it leads to more actionable insights. This type of error 
events is often caused by exceeding a threshold that could be 
checked in production without much effort.  
 
For this illustration, metric 𝑔 is computed with a number 
of intervals 𝑛 = 100. The results listed in Table 2 show that 
21

the classical feature importance ranks the less interesting 
feature B as more important, whereas metric 𝑔 the Micro-avg 
Shap correctly ranks feature A as more important. 
Considering the results for Weight with an absolute 
difference in scores of A and B of 25 and a standard deviation 
of 53 for B, both features A and B are attributed with similar 
importance, with B being ranked slightly higher.

C) Slope-Approach 
 
The intuition behind this approach is that rapid changes in 
SHAP values are of interest. A rapid change of SHAP values 
within a small interval of feature values indicates a clear 
threshold at which interpretation as the cause of error events 
is possible. The rate of SHAP value change can be 
represented by a slope. Like the former approach equally 
sized intervals of a feature are constructed but then regression 
slopes on the means of SHAP values over multiple intervals 
are computed. To make the approach more precise, further 
conditions are imposed to accept the slope as admissible 
solution or the computed slope is not considered for the 
importance score. Formally, the importance score 𝑔  is 
defined: 
𝑔(𝑓, 𝑋, 𝑛, 𝑤, 𝑡) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥{|𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒(𝑤𝑗)|| 𝑗 = 0, … , 𝑛 − 1} 
 
The slope 𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒(𝑤𝑗) = 𝛽 is computed over the rolling 
window  𝑤𝑗 = {𝜙̅𝑓(Xj), … , 𝜙̅𝑓(Xj+w)}  of size 𝑤  where 𝛽 
minimizes 𝜖 =  𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋𝑖) − 𝑖 ∗ 𝛽  for 𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋𝑖) ∈ 𝑤𝑗 . Here 𝛽 
represents the slope over the averaged shap values of multiple 
windows 𝑤𝑗. To compute 𝛽 we used simple OLS regression. 
Also note that 𝑋𝑖  for interval 𝑖  is similar defined to the 
previous micro-average approach. The slopes 𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒(𝑤𝑗) is 
considered or discarded, i.e., set to zero, for some threshold 𝑡 
if either condition is fulfilled: 
∃ 𝑖 = 𝑗, … , 𝑗 + 𝑤: 𝑞75( {𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋𝑖) ∈ 𝑤𝑗})
− 𝑞25({𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋𝑖) ∈ 𝑤𝑗}) ≥ 𝑡  
(1) 
max({𝜙̅𝑓(𝑋𝑖) ∈ 𝑤𝑗| 𝑖 = 𝑗, … , 𝑗 + 𝑤}) ≥ 𝑡  
(2) 
 
Condition (1), called Interquartile (IQR) shap variation, is 
chosen such that the mean shap values in the window 𝑤𝑗 in 
between the 0.75 quantile 𝑞75 and the 0.25 quantile 𝑞25 has 
to be greater than or equal to given threshold 𝑡. For condition 
(2) the Max Shap variation the maximal mean shap value in 
the window 𝑤𝑗 has to be greater than or equal to a threshold 
𝑡. If the corresponding condition is fulfilled, the 𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒(𝑤𝑗) 
is accepted. Both conditions suppress steep local slopes 
covering a too small value range. 
 
To illustrate this metric on a sample case, we consider a 
change in error rate within a small feature range. We assume 
two uniform distributed features A and B. Feature A causes 
an error rate of 15% in a 0.01 feature value quantile range. 
Feature B causes a decreasing error rate from 10% to 2% over 
the entire feature value range. Although feature B may be 
more important globally, we consider feature A as more 
important to identify actionable insights. To compute the 
importance score 𝑔, we set the numbers of intervals to 𝑛 =
300 and the rolling window of size 𝑤 = 10. The thresholds 
𝑡 are chosen for the IQR variation (1) as 𝑡 = 0.1 and to 𝑡 =
0.4 for the Max Shap variation (2). As such, the interquartile 
range or the maximum value respectively of the mean SHAP 
values over the intervals in window 𝑤𝑗 has to be greater than 
or equal to 𝑡.  
 
The illustration results listed in Table 3 show the classic 
importance measures rank feature B as more important. In 
contrast, both proposed Slope variations correctly rank 
feature A as more important. Observing Weight with an 
absolute difference in scores of 2 feature B is slightly ranked 
better than feature A. However, the values are very similar, 
given a standard deviation of about 37.

EXPERIMENTS 
With the aim to identify features that are interesting in 
error cause analysis, we conduct an experiment with the 
Secom dataset [13]. The real-world dataset originates from a 
semiconductor manufacturing process containing 591 
features and 1667 instances of which 106 are error instances.  
 
The learning problem is formulated as a binary 
classification task and a XGB gradient boosting model with 
default parameters used for training. For model training and 
the evaluation of importance metrics, we used the whole 
dataset. This may resemble an idealized case where the 
training data perfectly meets the data distribution during 
prediction but also prevents uncertainty being induced by the 
model for the evaluation of the importance metrics. The 
model achieved a perfect training score according to the f1 
score (f1=1.0). The SHAP values are computed using the 
SHAP package (v0.40.0) [14]. The proposed importance 
metrics were computed using the same parameters described 
in the illustrations on the synthetic datasets for each proposed 
approach.  
 
We use the experiments to compare existing and our 
proposed importance metrics and discuss exemplary features 
in detail along with their SHAP plots. Figures 1 to 4 show the 
22

discussed SHAP plots. However, because of the limited 
space, not all SHAP plots of every feature can be shown. The 
SHAP plots have the feature values on the x-axes and the 
corresponding SHAP value on the y-axes. Visually 
distinguishable are error instances colored red and non-errors 
colored blue. Colored grey in the background are histograms 
of the corresponding feature values. 
 
For the following discussion of the results, the metrics are 
grouped into (1) Classic, (2) SHAP-based and (3) our 
proposed importance metrics. Table 4 shows the resulting 
rankings. Highlighted in grey are the agreements of the 
corresponding group with the proposed metrics. At the first 
sight, the metrics Gain and Cover have the least overlapping 
results with the proposed metrics. Since both metrics are 
commonly used as importance measures this is surprising. On 
the other hand, the metric Weight has quite a lot in common 
with the proposed metrics but the previous illustrations on 
synthetic data already showed that Weight is not a reliable 
measure. In the following, agreements and disagreements 
over the grouped rankings of the top three features are 
discussed in more detail.  
A)  Agreements of importance 
Across all groups of metrics, some features have identical 
importance. All groups assign similar importance to the 
features F59, F64, F333 and F103.  
Features F59, F64 and 103 are shown in Figure 1 and are 
examples of interesting features. F59 has increased SHAP 
values on the right-hand side. A point of interest is the 
threshold of about 10 of the feature value where the SHAP 
values are increasing. This hints at a threshold that can be 
useful for error cause analysis and error explanation. An 
advanced understanding of such thresholds enables 
correction in production, like adjustment of parameters or 
setting machinery alarms. Further assessing the right-hand 
side of F59 shows high SHAP values, which is an indicator 
for a cause explanation. Note, this area of increased SHAP 
values also shows an increased error rate, rendering this an 
interesting feature. F64 shows these interesting properties 
too: A distinguishable threshold at which SHAP values are 
increasing, strong effects, i.e., high SHAP values, and a 
higher error ratio in the area of increased SHAP values.  
 
Ranked as equally important across all groups – with 
minor differences – are F103 and F333. Both features are of 
interest and show equivalent properties as described above. 
Due to space limitations, just F333 is shown in Figure 1.  
 
Out of the Classic feature importance, F429 (Figure 2) is 
interesting. It is ranked second by Cover and in the top 3 of 
the proposed metrics. It shows a moderate effect (more than 
0.8) and a clear threshold at which the SHAP values are 
increasing. This threshold defines the area of an increased 
error ratio, rendering the feature interesting. 
F40 (Figure 2) is ranked as identically important both by 
the SHAP-based and by the proposed metrics. It has high 
effects and a good error ratio in an area of increased SHAP 
values. Note that the feature comprises only a few instances 
with high effects. It depends on the cost structures and 
specifics of the production process whether the amount 
justifies the considerations for a deeper error cause analysis. 
However, we argue that the observation hints at an interesting 
phenomenon.  
B) Disagreements of importance 
 
Besides commonalities, there are also differences in 
rankings which are discussed next. Comparing the Classic 
with the proposed metrics, major differences are revealed by 
Gain and Cover. Here, we focus on the features F210 and 
F539 shown in Figure 3 at the bottom of the next page, and 
F29 as well. Gain ranks all three features high, but we argue 
that these features are of less interest to determining cause

importance measures and show interesting patterns for cause anlysis – errors-instances (red) and non-errors (blue).

explanations. F210 has an overall weak effect, i.e., the 
maximal SHAP value is around 0.1. It is also not possible to 
determine a clear threshold at which SHAP values are 
increasing, nor to specify a clear threshold of higher error 
rates. F539 shows a few instances with increased error rate 
but also with weak effect, i.e., a SHAP value of 0.3 and 
therefore is not interesting enough for further investigations. 
Feature F29 is not shown here due to the space limitations but 
has a similar appearance as both features described above and 
thus is of less interest.  
 
F168 is shown in Figure 3 and ranked first by Cover, but 
not ranked in the top 5 by any of the other groups. It shows 
an area of increased SHAP values with a suitable error ratio 
but the effect, i.e., of 0.35 is quite low and therefore we argue 
that this feature also is of low interest. 
 
Feature F426, shown in Figure 2, has interesting 
properties and ranked as important by the Classic importance 
but is not ranked in the top five using the proposed metrics. 
F426 shows a step increase in SHAP values on the left-hand 
side with a maximal effect of 1.2 which looks sufficient at 
first glance. Further examinations showed that F426 was 
ranked seventh by the proposed Slope Max Shap approach. 
Investigating the region of increased SHAP values revealed 
also that F426 has a few high effects but the average effect 
for this region is quite low. This indicates over plotting of the 
SHAP plot and relativizes the interestingness of F426.  
 
Comparing SHAP-based and the proposed metrics, 
feature F21 stands out as it ranked as important in the group 
of SHAP-based measures but neither by the Classic nor by 
the proposed metrics. F21 (not shown) has a decent effect of 
0.6 and a steep increase in SHAP values. Yet, it does not have 
an area with a high error rate and falls behind in the proposed 
metrics. 
C) Highlights of proposed metrics 
F423, F475 and F130, as shown in Figure 4, are only 
ranked as important by the proposed metrics. F423 has strong 
positive effects, clear threshold upon which SHAP values 
increase and a relatively high error ratio in in a specific area. 
We therefore argue that the feature is interesting. F475 has 
strong effects, a clear threshold where effects increase, and a 
good error ratio. Therefore, we argue that it is also interesting 
for further investigations. F130 shows negative SHAP values 
in the bottom left corner which indicates a value range where 
the error rate is much lower. It is also possible to determine a 
threshold at which SHAP values decrease to a zero effect. 
This might hint at means to prevent errors and we argue that 
the feature is therefore interesting. 
Overall, the experiments support the usefulness of the 
proposed metrics. They show that high ranked features have 
properties that are interesting for a cause analysis of 
production errors. Furthermore, we have shown that 
established metrics may rank features high, that do not have 
such interesting properties. In contrast, the proposed metrics 
rank features high that are interesting but considered not 
important by existing metrics. This demonstrates that cause 
analysis in manufacturing can benefit from the proposed 
metrics.

interpretability through xAI have been reported [16]. 
However, we argue that the proposed metrics are more related 
to feature importance measures. The metrics may be used in 
root cause analysis to incorporate expert knowledge. Applied 
xAI in the manufacturing domain is used to extract 
explanations from a machine learning model to, e.g., enhance 
trust in the model, used for model optimization or to assist 
domain experts taking actions according to the model 
insights. In [17], saliency maps and class activation maps are 
extracted from a deep learning model. In [3], the authors use 
an isolation forest as model to determine normal production 
line behavior and feature importance to explain the model. 
Mehdiyev and Fettke apply local and global explanations to 
examine the impact of different views on the generated 
insights [18]. However, neither work addresses the problem 
of which feature provides the most promising insights given 
the possible tremendous feature space and the corresponding 
effort required to examine all explanations. To the best of our 
knowledge, we are the first to provide SHAP-based 
importance measures tailored to the task for quality 
management. Lundberg et al., introduced the idea of SHAP-
based feature importance [14]. To determine a feature’s 
overall effect, the absolute SHAP value across all considered 
instances is averaged and thus a global importance measure. 
In contrast, our proposed measures just consider instances 
that possibly encompass interesting properties for quality 
management. Other global importance measures used in the 
domain have a broad history. A detailed description of the 
following global importance measures is laid out by Molnar 
[19]. In [20], Permutation Feature Importance is introduced. 
A global measure of where the features are perturbated and 
the resulting performance loss of the model is taken as a 
measure of the features importance. Mehdiyev and Fettke 
[18] used Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) [21] as 
the global importance. Also possibly used are Partial 
Dependence Plots (PDP) [22]. However, neither ICE nor PDP 
accumulates a single importance score. Both are used as 
visualizations of global model behavior. Overall, one of the 
most influential global importance measures is the Gini index 
[23]. According to Lundberg [24], the Gini index is 
equivalent to the in XGBoost [12] implemented importance 
measure Gain which uses the average training loss reduction 
gained when using a feature for splitting. Lundberg [24] also 
describes Weight as the number of times a feature is used to 
split the data across all trees and Cover as the number of 
times a feature is used to split the data across all trees 
weighted by the number of training data points that go 
through those splits. Both the total importance scores used for 
comparison are described in the XGBoost documentation 
[25] for Total Gain as the total gain across all splits the 
feature is used in and Total Cover as the total coverage 
across all splits the feature is used in. For local feature 
importance, LIME [11] could also be considered. However, 
to compute explanations LIME uses sampling which is not 
restricted to solely interesting areas. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
 
In this paper, we have introduced regional feature 
importance measures that aim at identifying interesting 
features for quality management in manufacturing. We 
discussed the underlying notion of interest and provided 
corresponding 
formal 
definitions. 
Conceptually, 
our 
importance measures are between established global and 
local feature importance measures and highlight regional 
effects which are helpful in finding production error causes. 
We illustrate the usefulness of the new measures through 
experiments using synthetic and real-world data. 
 
Our experiments show that the prosed measures 
successfully elicit features that – based on our experience [5] 
– are interesting, but are missed by established methods. 
Therefore, we conclude that quality managers benefit from 
adding our proposed importance measures to the pool of xAI 
methods. We thereby improve xAI for error prediction 
models in manufacturing. With the help of our importance 
measures, quality managers get hints about interesting 
relations that are reflected in the prediction model and drive 
deeper analysis accordingly. 
 
Subject to future work are questions about the integration 
of the importance measure in the machine learning pipeline. 
In this work, we assume that the measures are applied at the 
end of the pipeline, potentially after automated feature 
engineering, and model optimization. However, the proposed 
measures may drive the analysis of features earlier in the 
pipeline as well. Furthermore, future work may expand on the 
idea of providing importance measures between global and 
local measures. With our work, we have presented several 
heuristics which follow this concept for capturing interesting 
patterns in features.
