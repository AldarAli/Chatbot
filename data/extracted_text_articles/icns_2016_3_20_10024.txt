Abstract— 
Telecommunication 
Market 
evolution 
poses 
challenges for future mobile networks. On one side, pressure 
on network operators regarding technology investments and 
decreasing revenue; while on the other side, changes in 
customer behavior and perception give rise to the quest for 
structural re-organization and for new business strategies in 
the telecommunications business. This paper gives attention to 
the telecommunication market from the microeconomic 
perspective and describes a solution for a near perfect 
telecommunications market where the market innovation and 
the efficiency of underlying telecommunication system are 
optimized by forces of demand and supply. The author 
envisions a pervasive telecommunication market based on the 
marketplace concept proven over 200 years’ combined with 
advanced wireless network architecture.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The 
telecommunication 
market 
evolution 
poses 
challenges to future mobile networks. There is an enormous 
pressure on the network operators to reverse the trend of 
decreasing revenues, to adopt new cloud infrastructure, to 
provide broadband, delay and reliability stringent services, 
as described in [1] and to ensure necessary technological 
investments as discussed in [2] and [3]. On one hand, higher 
transmission peak capacity is required and on the other, 
networks are highly underutilized, as stated in [4]. From the 
user perspective, rapid changes in customer behavior (and 
perception) set special requirements for network and new 
service categories force redefinition of the provider-to-
customer relationship [5]. 
A promising approach towards network cost reduction is 
sharing of radio resource. The pure infrastructure sharing 
can be realized, but at the expense of suboptimal profits. In 
contrast, radio resource sharing between “equal” partners is 
very challenging - interoperability and responsibility in 
management decisions are the main problems to solve. The 
literature proposes a lot of strategies for sharing of physical 
radio resources, e.g. game theoretical approaches, but the 
strategies deal with some potential sharing ideals and 
concern mostly single aspects reduced to one specific 
problem, which do not help to solve short term realistic 
multi-dimensional situation in radio resource sharing, as 
discussed in [6] and [7]. There is also a well known concept 
concerning “non-equal” cooperating partners, on one side 
the Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) and on the 
other the Mobile Network Operator (MNO). MVNO does 
not dispose of own radio infrastructure and has to cooperate 
with an incumbent network operator by leasing radio 
resources within the condition of a service level agreement 
(SLA). Since the SLA contrasts are long-lasting contracts, 
they are not adaptable to changing situation during the 
contract time. So, they are not dynamic to readjust for real 
capacity need in terms of location and time needed and not 
flexible for fast reaction to global market changes. 
Furthermore, the MNO dominance makes impossible for 
upcoming 3rd parties to enter the telecommunication market. 
With other words, the telecommunication market does not 
meet all conditions for flexibility, business dynamicity and 
price discrimination. Therefore we propose Wireless Ticket 
Exchange (WTE) a solution which makes possible, that the 
telecommunication market will be:  
• Open for and transparent to all market players, 
• Flexible and dynamic, 
• Can quickly respond to rapid market changes, 
• Guarantees easy entry to the market for newcomers, 
• Decision freedom and independence of network and 
service providers will retain, 
• Service providers have the possibility to address targeted 
consumer groups rapidly, and 
• Contracts between providers as well as between 
providers and users are flexible with regard to contract 
subject, price, and duration. 
Our approach does not focus only on technology as such, 
but also on integration of economic and user aspects into a 
holistic framework realized by the WTE approach.  
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
provides economic background and introduces basics of 
market mechanisms in user–provider interaction. Section III 
addresses 
necessary 
changes 
towards 
a 
future 
telecommunication market. Section IV goes into details of 
the idea of the Wireless Ticket Exchange. Section V 
addresses the user integration into the upcoming pervasive 
telecommunications market. Section VI concludes the 
paper.

II. 
MARKET MECHANISMS 
To understand the issues arising in telecommunication 
network economics, we focus first on some basic 
microeconomics market mechanisms. 
Due to market mechanisms, demand and supply balances 
towards an optimum. The higher the price of a product the 
more the supplier is willing to produce and sell. As seen in 
Figure 1, product demand follows the inverse of the product 
price. The market clears at the equilibrium price p* and the 
quantity q*. The variation of the price and quantity over 
time depends on the way in which supply and demand 
respond to economic variables such as demander’s income, 
production costs, etc. If the price p* is regulated to p1, the 
quantity supplied decreases and a demand shortage develops 
[8]. 
Above mentioned mechanisms show the native market 
feedback balancing demand and supply to the optimum. 
Any external influence violates market forces [9]. 
 
          
 
Figure 1.  Market mechanisms. 
As shown in Figure 2 the number of potential customer base 
C, as given in (1) depends on users’ affordability A, defined 
as the relationship between the disposable incomes I and 
price p, as shown in (2), where k is a constant.

Price changes of a product affect the affordability and so 
the number of potential customers in such way that the 
higher the product’s affordability the higher the market size.  
Also, the lower the product price, the more price-sensitive 
users will be attracted [10]. Besides the price, user’s non-
monetary preferences must be taken into account in strategic 
decisions of a provider. 
A. Users utility 
The preferences of a user i using a telecommunication 
service can be therefore represented by a utility function Ui 
which is an abstract concept in economy and which 
represents the satisfaction or benefit that a user gains from 
consuming a given amount of resources. The utility maps 
the set of outcomes q, e.g., Quality of Service (QoS), access 
time to the network, etc., to the set of real values, as e.g. 
proposed in [11]. Usually, the utility function strictly 
decreases in price pi, which means, the user prefers to pay as 
little as possible. The reference utility we can define as 
Ui(q0,0), i.e., a utility without monetary outcome, and then 
the valuation function for the outcome q is the maximum 
price the user is willing to pay for the preferred outcome 
over the reference utility:

Now we assume, the user would like to stream a video with 
a high quality ϱ and his utility function Ui(ϱ,pi) is increasing 
in ϱ. Additionally, we suppose that the user is willing to pay 
an additional fee β for a higher streaming quality and will 
not pay for  the service with a lower quality than defined as 
ϱmin even if the service is for free. In this case for all

can be used by the operator to compute an equivalent price 
for a service with quality ϱ. The above model indicates the 
importance of the effects of user preferences on product, in 
this case, on service design. Operator has the opportunity to 
create an extensive service portfolio to measure the demand 
structure, and to calibrate the service parameters according 
to users’ valuation. The wider the service portfolio, the 
higher the probability that certain services comply with 
users’ requirements and the faster an operator can optimize 
services and the revenue. 
B. Operators revenue 
 Building on the above observation we construct a 
business valuation function representing operator’s revenue 
from transactions at the time services are sold. In general, 
the revenue R is the quantity of the sold product times the 
selling price p.  
The number of sold products results from the number of 
customers C who bought a number N of the product. The 
number of sold products results from the number of 
customers C who bought a number N of the product snd so 
the revenue R can be defined

In summary, a telecommunication market model, as 
shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 can be characterized by a 
number of potential customers interested in a specific 
telecommunication product and by a number of units of this 
product, the potential customer efforts in dependence on 
product embodiment. 
As shown in Figure 2 the higher the product affordability 
the more customers will probably buy this product. It is 
advantageous to have cheap products due to higher 
customer base. Furthermore cheap product have better profit 
margin. Figure 3 shows, that the better product’s 
embodiment fulfills customer demand the more product 
units will be sold per customer. Services (see Figure 3) 
described by the service depiction value considering 
affordability, price, QoS, duration time, target group, etc. 
have to be carefully designed in order to attract users and to 
maximize the demand. 
The telecommunication market today does not have a 
mechanism which guarantees that a general demand/supply 
balance can be maintained on the market. This entails a need 
for information on market conditions and its capacities. 
         
 
Figure 3.  Different services and their normalized demand 
on the market. 
Conventional distribution channels such as shops or 
provider’s own internet platform are cost intensive and 
address to low customer base. Therefore, the provider is 
forced to maximize products volume, e.g., to create complex 
and expensive product packages and/or to force the 
customer to accept a long-term contract. This is in turn 
contradictive to above findings. As a result, the provider 
cannot exhaust the market potential and let business 
opportunities unexploited. If the provider would get the 
opportunity to reduce distribution costs and to adopt 
contract volume and duration to customers’ needs more 
closely he would increase its revenues significantly.  
A remedy can be a marketplace that integrates all 
customers having demand for telecommunication products. 
Such marketplace is provided online and so marketing and 
customer assistance in dedicated shops is not needed. 
Purposive provider’s internet pages are superfluous too. In 
addition, contrary to provider’s web pages, offers provided 
on a marketplace are transparent and help customers to 
understand the presented service and price plan. An online 
marketplace provides the product presentation and the 
trading for every provider and will therefore reduce the unit 
costs.  
To enable the telecommunication market fulfilling the 
mentioned requirements in Section I we propose a 
telecommunication marketplace empowering natural market 
forces. Such a marketplace can be represented by an auction 
or an exchange.  
C. Auction and Exchange 
Economics know different embodiments of competitive 
markets, depending on traded artifacts and trading rules. 
Auction and exchange are examples of marketplaces. For 
example, Google proposed recently a concept, where a user 
pings service providers for their best offers while placing a 
call [12]. Then, either the user or an appropriate application 
evaluates the bids and completes the call. In a traditional 
auction there are usually many prospective buyers and one 
auctioneer conducting the auction process which lasts for a 
defined time period. Auctions are in general appropriate for

unique objects and in telecommunication markets often used 
to trade licensed radio spectrum [13]. Unlike auctions, an 
exchange is a marketplace with many sellers and many 
prospective buyers, where the prices are posted [14]. Trades 
are made directly between the buyers and the sellers and the 
clearing process is conducted immediately if there is a call. 
Sellers compete by submitting offers to the exchange or, in a 
simplified way, directly to the user.  
Therefore, in order to decide whether auction or exchange 
is 
more 
preferable 
as 
a 
trading 
concept 
for 
telecommunication products by considering criteria, inter 
alia, transaction duration, dynamicity, openness and 
transactions simplicity, we decided that an exchange is 
better suited as a platform for trading of telecommunication 
artifacts than the auction. 
III. 
NEW ARCHITECTURAL AND BUSINESS MODEL 
The above theoretical analysis shows that mentioned 
requirements on the telecommunication sector can be 
fulfilled by creation of a flexible operating platform, the 
marketplace. Marketplace architecture implies multitenancy 
and network virtualization, as claimed in [13]. This opens 
the value-chain of the telecommunication sector and so 
leads to separation of telecommunication provider roles. As 
a consequence, previously closed proprietary interfaces are 
turned into non-proprietary interfaces and thus offer 
infrastructure facilities to upcoming 3rd parties.  
Therefore, in the next generation wireless network a 
possible business model can be based on increased 
specialization of the market players towards: 
• 
Mobile Network Infrastructure Providers (MNIP). 
• 
Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO).  
• 
Service Providers (SP), Content Providers (CP), etc.  
• 
Marketplace Operator.  
 
Mobile Network Infrastructure Provider offers network 
infrastructure and technologies as well as connectivity 
service. To make physical resources multi-tenant scalable, a 
MNIP transforms its network resources into logical 
resources by virtualization and wraps them to telco artifacts 
targeted to different customers. Telco artifacts are described 
by a number of parameters as QoS, traffic volume, location, 
radio access technology, contract duration, price, etc. The 
MNIP is obligated to guarantee the complete performance 
of the telecommunication artifacts. 
Networks created and managed by Mobile Virtual 
Network Operator are based on virtual resources purchased 
from MNIPs on a marketplace. Note that the proposed 
MVNO differs from the today’s defined MVNO. Since the 
MVNO does not own its own network, no customers can 
roam to that operator. However, all the customers of the 
MVNO have roamed to the networks of the MNOs. This 
makes the situation asymmetric, and this is not the case in 
our concept. MVNO can purchase connectivity services to 
expand its virtual network by additional area. Thanks to the 
flexibility given by the marketplace, MVNO can freely 
design spacial extend of its network and dynamically adopt 
resource volume to predicted traffic load. The calculation of 
needed resource in respect of amount, contract duration time 
and price is in its own responsibility. 
Service Provider cooperates with MVNOs and offers 
services targeting current customer needs. Depending on the 
business model the services can be either integrated into 
existing virtual network or can be offered to the customer 
separately. 
Marketplace Operator provides marketplace platform where 
the MNIPs, MVNOs, and other players offer their products 
and make business.  
 
Besides providers and operators also users will play an 
important role on the changing telecommunication market. 
Users will have the possibility to adopt contracts to their 
needs, preferences and actual location and ask for means 
supporting the creation of individual service bundles. 
Furthermore users expect also to have access to networks of 
different operators in order to get the specified service. 
IV. 
WIRELESS TICKET EXCHANGE – THE MARKETPLACE 
The envisioned telecommunication market is based on well 
defined and straight trading rules and creates a trading 
environment transparent to all parties. Each bidder knows 
the offerings by competitors and the asked prices. The 
proposed telecommunication market comprises the platform 
WTE, the WTE Operator, various telco artifact providers 
and users.  
On the WTE market players meet one another and conduct 
transactions by trading telco artifacts. Telco artifacts can be 
any 
telecommunication 
object 
provided 
by 
telecommunication players. This can be hardware such as a 
Base Station, Small Cells, Backhaul as well as spectrum, 
bandwidth, service, etc. The telco artifacts are described in a 
form of standardized Telco Tickets whereby the structure of 
Telco Ticket can differ for commercial and private users. In 
general, Telco Tickets describe details of the offer  
As already indicated, the WTE is provided by the WTE 
Operator. He has a broker role and provides an exchange 
infrastructure supporting the execution and fulfilling of 
transactions.  The broker role comprises in getting Telco 
Tickets from the telco artifacts provider and managing the 
transaction process. A transaction is executed in real-time. 
Since demand and supply interact in a closed-loop, the price 
level and service characteristics have important effect on 
quantity demanded and inversely, the demand influences 
supply.  We would like to emphasize, that the future 
networks will be definitely dominated by solutions allowing 
m:n customer to provider relationships. Assuming so, 
customers are not necessarily bound to long term contracts 
and can choose between multiple providers according to 
user’s specific demand. This will be an opportunity for 
providers to create innovative products and so to 
differentiate from each other. Broad base services in terms 
of technology, service type, service quality and price will in 
turn generate positive stimuli for the market success of the

market players. The WTE is separated into the Commercial 
Ticket Exchange and the End User Ticket Exchange. The 
Commercial Ticket Exchange covers trading between 
business companies trading with business addressed 
artifacts, i.e., Business-to-Business (B2B) market. They 
have the possibility to sell and to buy network resources, 
different services, network nodes, etc. Furthermore, the 
companies offer services to the users. Their offers are traded 
on the End User Ticket Exchange serving users demand i.e., 
a 
Business-to-Customer 
(B2C) 
market. 
Furthermore, 
services such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) are also 
provided at the WTE.  
A. WTE functions 
The WTE has to perform three tasks: 
• 
Admission as a trader. 
• 
Telco Ticket presentation.  
• 
Transaction processing and fulfilling. 
Admission as a trader is performed in a registration 
procedure where the applicant data is collected. The 
application procedure is different for commercial and for end 
user applicants.  
Telco Tickets will be exposed by a WTE service 
application presenting submitted bids and asks to the 
customers and allowing the customers to purchase selected 
artifacts. The WTE provides exchange facilities with 
interfaces for human interaction and machine type 
communication. 
B. WTE functional architecture 
The main functional entities of the WTE architecture 
are the Trading Facility, the Communication Facility, the 
Service Register, the Root Home Register, the Trader 
Register, the Subscriber Name Server (SNS), and the 
Authentication Center (AuC) (see Figure 4). 
 
      
 
Figure 4.  WTE functional architecture. 
The Trading Facility allows users to access the WTE as a 
visitor or as a subscriber. Rights a granted to a visitor to see 
the offered bids and asks, but without the privilege to close 
transactions. The WTE subscriber may be the end user as 
well as a commercial user, a commercial company. After the 
registration as a WTE subscriber, the End User gets a 
Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card authorizing to trade 
on the WTE. Registration data of both, commercial as well 
as non-commercial users’ are stored in the Trader Register. 
The Service Register stores Telco artifacts to be traded.   The 
content of the Service Register, bids and asks uploaded from 
the contractors, is presented in a human readable form to 
allow traders to choose and to select services they need, and 
to buy corresponding tickets. The Communication facility 
supports internal communication between the Registers, 
between the Registers and Trading Facility, and external 
communication between the Wireless Ticket Exchange and 
subsystems of the network. The Root Home Register (RHR) 
receives data from the Trading Facility and stores the data 
and sends it to the Home Service Server of the involved 
network. The Subscriber Name Server (SNS) guaranties that 
the call is routed directly to user’s current location. 
C. Integration of marketplayers infrastructure into WTE 
Trading of products on the WTE requires an integration 
of the infrastructure belonging to market players into the 
WTE functionality, as shown in Figure 5. 
 
       
 
Figure 5.  WTE extensions to the network. 
This can be achieved by means of a specialized gateway, 
the WTE-Gateway, which is able to translate heterogeneous 
interfaces into WTE standard. The WTE-Gateway is 
moreover connected to other specialized nodes on the MNIP, 
MVNO or SP side. Figure 5 depicts an example of MNIP 
and MVNO. MNIP is equipped with a logical entity called 
Heterogeneous Atomic Resource Manager (HAReM) and a 
customer database. HAReM combines Atomic Resource 
Entities (ARE) collected by Atomic Resource Manager  
(ARM) to larger data transport entities, and creates Telco 
Tickets that will be delivering to the WTE in order to sell. 
Additional architectural entities on the MVNO side are 
Heterogeneous Network Manager (HNM) and Customer & 
Supplier database. HNM is responsible for virtual network 
creation, management of the virtual network, forecasting the 
network capacity due to subscriber’s requirements, and 
foreseen traffic load in respect of considered user demands 
on throughput. The HNM includes also creation and 
management of Telco Tickets. 
V. 
USERS CENTRIC APPROACH 
To enjoy the benefits of the WTE user has to register to 
WTE service as a trader. After the registration procedure the 
user becomes a trader who can benefit from different offers 
of various MVNOs and Service Providers. The user can 
purchase telco services on the WTE and (in exceptional case)

the user can sell acquired Telco Tickets back.  Every WTE 
subscriber is equipped with a SIM card identifying him as a 
trader. The SIM card storing user’s identification number 
(WTE identifier) allows him to access the network of 
MVNOs registered on the WTE. It is quite evident, that the 
trader has to possess Telco Tickets from one or more 
MVNOs before he can do calls in corresponding network. 
When a subscriber buys a service on the WTE, the 
subscriber’s data is automatically transferred to MVNOs 
Home Subscriber Server or corresponding facility in such a 
way that the buyer becomes the status of native subscriber of 
the seller for the time covered by closed transaction. If 
required, transaction procedure can be repeated by any 
number of times with different network operators. As a result 
a user has access to networks belonging to those MVNOs.  
In case off Telco Tickets containing combine services, as for 
example content service and corresponding streaming 
service, both providers are informed about conducted 
transaction. 
At the time the user enters a network of a MVNO that has an 
agreement with the user the MVNO provides the user with a 
MVNO local identifier. The telecommunication system uses 
the local identifier to route the call to the destination address.  
The user gets the status of a native subscriber of the seller for 
the time covered by the closed transaction. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We conclude that separation of telecommunication 
players’ roles is necessary to fulfill actual and future market 
requirements. By opening the value chain more business 
opportunities for traditional and new players will be 
available. The results will be welfare in maximizing market 
equilibrium by the forces of supply and demand. From this 
point of view we did not restrict our research to pure 
engineering on technological solution but we integrate 
economic and user perspectives, as well. As a consequence 
we draw the idea of WTE where various telecommunication 
providers, network operators, business customers and end 
users trade telecommunication artifacts in a free, dynamic, 
transparent environment with associated functional network 
and marketplace architecture. The many-to-many customer 
to provider relationship forces competitive advantage and 
boost performance in product differentiation and innovation. 
In opposite to known business models, we propose that 
providers retain their independence and freedom of decision 
in issues: which, with whom and how much resource to 
share. Due to flexible and dynamic contracts the WTE 
operators can cope with rapid changes in customers’ 
behavior, attitude and requirements. Again, due to market 
transparency users will generate immense dynamics and 
leverage expected assets.  
From the regulation point of view, WTE allows an easily 
entering the market for upcoming 3rd parties.  However, 
putting such an approach into practice reduces dominancy of 
today players in the mobile radio communication. Since the 
market offers new possibilities too, they can expect 
additional value by developing their commercial creativity. 
To this end, we are confident, trading of telecommunication 
artifacts addressed to commercial companies, as well as to 
private consumers opens new streams of revenue, brings 
opportunity for network monetization, radically improves 
cost structure and increases users’ satisfaction. 
In future works we will provide numerical methods and SON 
market driven algorithms applied to WTE service.
