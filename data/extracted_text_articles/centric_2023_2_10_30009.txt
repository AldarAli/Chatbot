Abstract—Accessible and readable contrast of text and 
graphical elements is a key requirement of the universal design 
of digital interfaces for people with and without disabilities. 
Many manual and automatic tools have been developed to help 
designers and developers measure color contrasts, but these 
tools are limited when it comes to assessing the contrast of three 
or more colors, the contrast of non-textual elements, as 
introduced by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
(WCAG) 2.1, and contrasts for people with visual deficiencies, 
including Color Vision Deficiencies (CVDs). This paper 
proposes an open-source, worldwide accessible, and universally 
designed web-based tool called Multi-Color Contrast Checker 
(M3C). Our tool provides three novel main functions: (1) A 
multi-color contrast checker that assesses two or more colors 
according to their compliance with WCAG 2.1. (2) A color 
contrast example area that visualizes the effects of the chosen 
colors on concrete visual example elements typically found in 
digital interfaces. (3) A CVD simulator for three common types 
of CVDs. The tool has been assessed for correctness, 
accessibility, and user experience in both expert and user 
evaluations, which have confirmed the tool’s usefulness in 
increasing awareness and knowledge of good color contrasts.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Luminance and color contrast significantly impact the 
readability and accessibility of visual information in digital 
interfaces [1][2]. Insufficient contrast affects many user 
groups, including people with visual impairments, such as 
people with Color Vision Deficiencies (CVDs) [3][4][5], as 
well as many elderly [3]. CVDs may prevent users from 
extracting visual information from a digital interface [5]. 
Recommendations for accessible contrasts have been 
integrated into international standards for accessibility, such 
as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 
[6][7][8][9]. WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 have become part of national 
and international laws and regulations by requiring 
compliance with websites, apps, and other ICT solutions 
[10][11][12]. WCAG defines minimum requirements for the 
contrast between text and background colors (Guidelines 
1.4.3 and 1.4.6 in WCAG 2.0 and later [8][9]) and in non-text 
elements necessary to understand the content including icons, 
buttons, parts of a map, charts, etc. (Guideline 1.4.11 in 
WCAG 2.1 and later [8][9]). 
These guidelines aim to make text and graphical elements 
easy to perceive, ensuring that the content of an application 
is readable and accessible to individuals with visual 
impairments. There are numerous application possibilities for 
WCAG: WCAG can guide designers and developers to 
choose color combinations with good contrast during 
development. 
Likewise, 
WCAG 
enables 
supervisory 
authorities and interest organizations to assess if colors in an 
interface 
are 
accessible. 
However, 
many 
relevant 
stakeholders lack awareness and knowledge of WCAG 
[13][14][15][16]. Moreover, existing color contrast checkers 
based on WCAG 2.0 [17][18] analyze contrast between two 
colors (mostly text and background), but lack support for 
complex multi-colored graphical elements like information 
graphics, as required by the introduction of non-text content 
in WCAG 2.1. Existing tools require all relevant color 
combinations of a multi-colored palette to be checked 
manually one-by-one. Additionally, there is a lack of 
example visualization tools that demonstrate how color 
contrast in complex graphical elements impacts an 
individual’s visual experience of the digital interface. As a 
result, the success criteria in WCAG can remain somewhat 
theoretical, leading to developers and designers not 
adequately considering individuals with visual variations 
during the design and development process. Last, the needs 
of individuals with CVDs are often overlooked, even though 
research shows that CVD simulations can enhance 
understanding of the experience of people with CVDs among 
individuals with normal color vision [19][20].  
We aim to enhance the accessibility of visual information 
in digital interfaces by facilitating compliance with the color 
contrast success criteria defined in WCAG 2.1. We present a 
web-based tool to support developers, designers, decision-
makers, authorities, and civil society organizations in 
analyzing and visualizing accessible contrasts for simple and 
complex color combinations that meet the WCAG 2.1 
requirements. Additionally, the tool increases awareness of 
the most common types of CVD. Compared to other tools our 
solution supports combinations of more than two colors, 
provides typical UI examples, and simulates the most 
common CVDs for the chosen colors.  
In this paper, we discuss in Section II related color 
checkers. 
Section 
III 
presents 
the 
concept 
and 
implementation of the Multi-Color Contrast Checker (M3C). 
Section IV introduces methods to assess the universal design 
of the developed tool. In Section V, we discuss their results 
including some suggestions for future research and 
development before concluding the article in Section VI.

II. 
RELATED SOLUTIONS 
The W3C maintains a list of tools that can measure color 
contrasts in digital interfaces [21] that possess some notable 
limitations. Only a few tools compute contrast between 
multiple colors like, for example, Accessible Brand Colors 
[22]. Many color checkers only calculate contrast between 
two colors like, for example, Color Check [23], Clapperton’s 
Colour Contrast Checker [24], Monsido’s Color Contrast 
Checker [25], Color Contrast Checker by UserWay [26], 
Colors Tester [27], ColorTester [28], Rumoroso’s WCAG 
Contrast Checker [29], WCAG Contrast Checker by Acart 
Communications [30], contrast finder [31], Contrasts - 
WCAG Farbkontraste [32], Color Contrast Accessibility 
Validator [33], Visual Contrast Checker and Colorblind 
Simulator [34]. In addition, most of these contrast checkers 
support only textual elements and their backgrounds 
[22][23][24][27][28][30][31]. A few color checkers provide 
CVD simulation [24][32], while others can only be used for 
CVD simulation [35][36]. Some tools do not have an explicit 
connection to the success criteria of WCAG [23][30][31], 
while some have only limited free functions [27][34] or are 
limited to specific operative systems or apps [29][32]. 
Popular tools not on the W3C list include WebAIM’s 
Contrast Checker [18], Colour Contrast Analyser [37], Color 
Contrast Checker & Analyzer [38], and Firefox’ native 
Accessibility Inspector [39]. Three of them check for both 
text and non-textual elements [18][37][39], and only one 
includes a simulation of different CVD types [39]. 
Many existing tools calibrated for calculating contrast, 
specifically between text and background colors per WCAG 
2.0 guidelines, fall short of accommodating the expanded 
color usage for non-text elements in user interfaces 
introduced by WCAG 2.1. The current tools largely neglect 
practical visualization of color combinations in various 
graphical interface elements and lack consideration for color-
deficient users. Additionally, tools offering broader 
functionalities are generally neither universally available nor 
commercially free. Hence, there is a notable absence of an 
open-source tool that effectively enables computation and 
practical demonstration of multiple color contrasts, while 
also providing CVD simulations. Moreover, there is a 
necessity for scientific research on strategies to ensure that 
such a tool is universally designed. 
III. 
THE MULTI-COLOR CONTRAST CHECKER (M3C) 
To facilitate and increase compliance with WCAG 2.1, 
we propose a web-based tool, called Multi-Color Contrast 
Checker 
(M3C), 
which 
is 
openly 
available 
at 
https://norskregnesentral.github.io/m3c/, easy to understand 
and use, accessible, and universally designed for people with 
and without disabilities. The tool consists of a multi-color 
contrast checker, a color contrast example area, and a CVD 
simulator. 
A. The Multi-Color Contrast Checker 
The multi-color contrast checker (cf. Figure 1) calculates 
contrasts between multiple colors. The user can make a color 
palette by choosing colors found in a text, background, non-
textual element, or graphics manually from a color wheel (in 
RGB or HSV), by entering a hex color value, or by using a 
pipette on a graphical element visible on the screen. The 
contrast checker enlists all possible combinations of the 
chosen colors and assesses whether each combination meets 
the success criteria 1.4.3, 1.4.6, and 1.4.11, as defined in 
WCAG 2.1 for texts (both minimum and enhanced), as well 
as non-textual elements [8]. Information about WCAG 2.1 
and color contrast according to WCAG 2.1 is included in the 
tool. The numerical results of the contrast computations are 
presented in a matrix, along with indicators for whether the 
success criteria are met on level AA or AAA (cf. Figure 1). 
Contrast computations are defined in WCAG 2.1 [8]:  
 
(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05) 
(1) 
Where L1 and L2 represent the relative luminance of the 
lighter and darker colors respectively according to the sRGB 
standard [40][41]. The tool also includes a “Get started” 
section that offers accessible example color palettes inspired 
by Color Brewer 2.0 and Color Hunt [42][43][44]. 
B. The Color Contrast Example Area 
The color contrast example area (cf. Figure 2) 
demonstrates the practical implications of contrast and 
readability of the chosen colors. It provides concrete 
examples of typical UI elements and visualizes how distinct 
color combinations affect these elements’ readability. The 
example area uses vector graphics that can individually adapt 
the colors of the various parts of the graphic. In the current 
implementation, we included four UI elements: text on 
background, a calendar graphic, a pie chart, and a button. 
C. The Color Vision Deficiency Simulator 
The Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) simulator (cf. Figure 
1) replicates the three most common types of CVDs, 
protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia, based on the 
formulas provided by Brettel et al. [45][46]. The CVD 
simulator automatically adjusts the colors of the palette and 
in the example area to mirror perceptions of a person with 
CVD. Concurrently, all contrast calculations are updated to 
reflect the simulated colors, enhancing the understanding of 
contrast perception for a person with CVD.  
D. Implementation 
The code of the application is hosted on and deployed by 
GitHub [47][48]. The tool has been programmed in the 
JavaScript library React [49] including the libraries i18next 
for internationalization [50], color-contrast-checker for 
contrast calculations [51], and adaptations of libDaltonLens 
for CVD simulations [52][53]. The CSS libraries flexbox and 
grid enabled a responsive user interface for variable screen 
sizes. The tool has been evaluated on computer screens, 
mobile phones, and tablets [54]. The tool has been developed 
in an agile process with several iterations consisting of 
planning, execution, review, and retrospective [55] including 
a review by other developers during each cycle. We 
conducted a round of user evaluation aimed at accessibility 
and user experience on the first prototype in January 2023.

IV. 
ACCESSIBILITY AND USER EXPERIENCE 
EVALUATIONS WITH EXPERTS AND USERS 
A. Methods and Participants 
We used tools, checklists, and user evaluations to assess 
the accessibility and user experience of the web tool. To 
begin with, the code was periodically tested concerning 
rudimentary technical accessibility using the Chrome and 
Firefox extensions of the WAVE Web Accessibility 
Evaluation tools [56]. Next, we conducted an expert 
evaluation according to the WCAG 2.2, including screen 
reader testing. We chose evaluation using WCAG 2.2 to 
make the tool more robust for the future, due to WCAG’s 
backward compatibility with previous versions. 
We conducted user evaluations of our first prototype in 
January 2023. This prototype contained all functions on a 
single page, requiring the user to scroll up and down to each 
section. The prototype also lacked the CVD simulation and 
internationalization modules. The evaluations were inspired 
by inclusive-design approaches and strategies for the 
assessment 
of 
digital 
artifacts’ 
user 
experience 
[57][58][59][60]. The evaluations employed a think-aloud 
strategy to identify bugs and other issues [57][60], and we 
defined a set of tasks that the participants had to complete in 
the presence of the test leader. Practical, technical, and 
content-related tasks were included, aiming at the 
functionality, accessibility, usability, and user-friendliness of 
the tool. The test leader encouraged the participants to 
comment while completing the tasks. Where necessary, the 
test leader asked clarifying questions. Additionally, we 
interviewed the participants about their expectations, their 
first impressions, and impressions after testing, including 
grades for satisfaction, the tool’s easy-to-use factor, and 
perceived usefulness. 
User evaluations were conducted with one female and 
seven male developers, both locally (5) and remotely (3) 
using our experience from previous remote evaluations [61].  
Seven of the participants did not mention any disabilities, 
while one reported some degree of low vision. Some of the 
participants had corrected-to-normal vision otherwise. The 
average level of experience with universal design among the 
participants was low (2.4 on a 5-point Likert scale). We 
evaluated multiple operating systems including Windows (6), 
Linux (1), and macOS (1), as well as different browsers 
including Chrome (4), Firefox (3), and Edge (1).  
B. Results 
The WCAG testing resulted in the discovery of 12 
accessibility issues. The expert and automated testing 
resulted in the detection of 61 issues in total, of which 41 
were usability issues, 13 were accessibility issues, and 7 were 
other issues. The issues were then triaged together with the 
accessibility issues and mostly implemented.  
The participants reported a medium satisfaction grade 
(3.25 on a 5-point Likert scale). They reported that the first 
version of the prototype was neither / nor easy-to-use (3 on a 
5-Point Likert scale). Finally, participants gave the tool a high 
usefulness rating (4.25 on a 5-point Likert scale). 
Participants found the prototype of the tool lacking in 
essential information about its purpose, funding, and creators, 
and criticized the absence of guidance and tutorials making it 
non-intuitive and difficult to comprehend. The front page was 
deemed cluttered and overwhelming with numerous 
elements, and the interface’s bright, sharp colors made it 
appear unrefined. 
Participants praised the interface for its clean, spacious 
design, clear hierarchy, and color categorization of the 
sections, appreciating the immediate, universal color changes 
and well-categorized sections. The color contrast calculations 
matrix and interactivity of the example area were valued for 
providing 
clear 
overviews 
and 
hands-on 
visual 
manipulations, 
respectively. 
The 
summary 
feature 
highlighting good and bad color contrasts and the 
presentation of WCAG requirements were deemed useful, 
with both the matrix and summary commended for showing 
all possible color combinations. 
Participants recommended making the system more 
logical by utilizing unused space, emphasizing essential 
elements, and refining icon usage. Suggestions included 
implementing tabs to minimize scrolling and optionally 
presenting WCAG guidelines alongside the contrast ratio 
table. The need for multi-language support and a feedback 
mechanism 
for 
reporting 
issues 
and 
suggesting 
improvements was emphasized. Additionally, participants 
desired a “dark mode” and increased interactivity in the 
example area with more than two colors, as well as guidance 
for choosing accessible color combinations from the start. 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
The tool’s accessibility and user experience have 
considerably improved for the current version. Tabs have 
been added to make the app’s structure clearer by avoiding 
empty space, giving clear headers, and putting focus on a 
single section at a time while hiding others. We updated the 
WCAG explanation and placed it in a separate tab for clarity. 
We integrated internationalization and translations in 
English. We added background information about the project 
and its contributors and added the possibility to submit 
feedback through GitHub’s issue feature. Last, we 
implemented the CVD simulation feature. 
User feedback generally indicated a positive reception, 
with users gaining familiarity with WCAG and appreciating 
the insights offered by the new CVD feature in understanding 
the needs of individuals with CVDs. 
The proposed tool targets developers, designers, decision-
makers, 
regulatory 
authorities, 
and 
civil 
society 
organizations. The tool can support these stakeholders' work 
by assessing if a chosen palette for a digital user interface 
conforms with the WCAG 2.1 success criteria. In practice, 
the tool can be utilized for all digital interfaces with visual 
information such as websites, web applications, digital 
learning materials, and self-service machines, as well as 
computer games, XR apps, or IoT devices, but this list is non-
exhaustive. The tool also promotes knowledge and awareness 
of the universal design of ICT applications by providing 
information about good color contrasts and WCAG. The 
application is built modularly, allowing for easy expansion,

and adding new features, such as support for additional 
languages, simulations, or more graphical examples. 
The tool underwent user experience and accessibility 
evaluations including WCAG checks and user testing to 
ensure that it is universally designed. It can, for example, be 
operated by only using the keyboard or using a screen reader. 
We also utilized the tool to assess the accessibility of the 
colors employed on the website itself. The application is 
deployed and freely available on GitHub, enabling all users 
worldwide to benefit from the tool. Also, the source code may 
be downloaded and extended as desired. Users can provide 
feedback and report issues or requests for future features. At 
the same time, the current research has its limitations related 
to the lack of quantitative performance comparisons with 
other tools, as well as demonstrating real-world impact by 
including user studies or metrics quantifying improvements 
in accessibility and WCAG compliance.  
We aim to enhance our website's accessibility and user 
guidance by implementing several upgrades: translating it 
into additional languages, including German, Chinese, 
Nynorsk, and Sámi, to appeal to a global audience; refreshing 
and augmenting examples; and introducing a tutorial through 
a succinct video demonstration. Additionally, we plan to 
incorporate a color palette picker, designed to facilitate 
accessible color selection in compliance with WCAG 2.1 
while adhering to other functional and aesthetic needs—
ensuring it meets user expectations related to, for instance, 
corporate design, and allowing user control over parameters 
such as hue, saturation, and brightness. Furthermore, we will 
assess the tool's efficacy and its contribution to increasing 
WCAG knowledge and awareness through questionnaires 
and 
head-to-head 
comparative 
evaluations, 
thereby 
establishing its innovations and added value compared to 
existing tools. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
We introduced the Multi-Color Contrast Checker (M3C), 
a novel tool designed to enhance the accessibility and 
readability of visual information in adherence to WCAG 2.1 
contrast success criteria. M3C, which is openly available and 
free-to-use (1) enables multi-color contrast checking, (2) 
visualizes color contrast effects on graphical interface 
elements, and (3) simulates various types of Color Vision 
Deficiency (CVD). Besides aiding developers and designers 
in making informed color selections, it also facilitates 
assessments of color palettes against WCAG 2.1 criteria.  
We employed diverse evaluation methods, including user 
experience and accessibility testing, to ensure that the tool 
itself is universally designed. Future developments will 
incorporate additional languages and a color palette chooser, 
guiding users toward accessible color selections within 
existing aesthetic, functional, or corporate design constraints.
