Abstract— Modern human society relies on different critical 
service systems. One important feature of these systems is that 
they work in a network manner. Thus, they could also be 
called networked service systems. Resilience is a necessary 
property of systems; in particular, the networked service 
systems should meet customers' demands facing various 
uncertainties. However, the understanding of resilience, 
especially in the context of service system, is still not very clear; 
the concept of resilience was confused with other similar safety 
concepts, such as reliability and robustness in the current 
literature. In this paper, we present a definition of resilience in 
the context of networked service system. Furthermore, some 
criteria of resilience measurement following this definition are 
also proposed. Two particular measurement models focusing 
on the different measurement criteria are presented with two 
simple examples to show how the proposed models work.

 INTRODUCTION 
Modern human society relies on different critical service 
systems, such as transportation system, power grid system, 
communication system and so on. One important feature of 
these system is that they work in a networked manner. Thus, 
they could also be called networked service systems. The 
networked service systems are complex socio-tech systems. 
It is unfortunate that today's networked service systems face 
serious safety issues. Here are two very recent examples. The 
breakdown of the power supply system in the north India 
happened in July 2012 led one-half of the country into 
serious trouble, which further caused the failure of other 
critical service systems, such as transportation system, 
financial system, water supply system, and hospital system 
[1]. Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012 killed at least 199 
people in seven countries and half of  New York lost the 
functions of almost all the service systems [2]. To address 
such safety challenges, the concept of resilience was 
introduced into safety engineering and used to describe the 
system's safety property [3]. 
From the safety engineering perspective, the resilience 
concept has been investigated by different researchers [3]-[6]; 
particularly, there are three categories of understanding of 
resilience. The first category mixed up resilience with other 
safety concepts, such as reliability and robustness [7], [8]. 
The second category focused on the system's recovery ability 
from partially damage [5]. The third category viewed 
resilience as in intrinsic ability to adjust its functioning prior 
to, during, or following changes and disturbances under both 
expected and unexpected conditions [12].  The three 
categories of definitions can not well reflect the features of 
the service systems. Therefore, the objectives of this paper 
are to (1) clarify the concept of resilience by giving a 
definition of resilience in the context of networked service 
systems, and (2) propose resilience measures based on the 
definition.  
The organization of the remainder of this paper is as 
follows. Section II proposes a new definition of resilience 
concept. Section III presents the criteria of the resilience 
measurement and two particular measurement models, as 
well as simple examples. Section IV discusses the 
conclusions and future work. 
II. 
RESILIENCE DEFINITION FOR SERVICE SYSTEMS 
A. 
 Resilience Definitions in the Literature 
Resilience is a popular term in material science [9], 
medicine [10] and ecology [11]. This concept was introduced 
into engineering field to understand safety as the ability to 
succeed under varying conditions [3], [12]. Two typical 
definitions of resilience from engineering perspective are 
given here. Zhang defined resilience as the ability of a 
system to recover to meet the demand from a partial damage 
[5]. Another well-known definition viewed resilience as the 
intrinsic ability of a system to adjust its functioning prior to, 
during, or following changes and disturbances so that the 
system can sustain required operations under both expected 
and unexpected conditions [12]. This definition actually 
covers the traditional concepts of safety, reliability and 
robustness, and makes further extension; in particular, 
resilience concept deals with the damaged situation – a point 
of resilience stressed by Zhang [5]. However, these 
definitions and understandings do not well describe the 
safety features of the networked service systems. 
B. 
Definition of Service System  
To facilitate the further discussion, the concepts of 
service and service system we proposed elsewhere [13] are 
given below.

"A service is a function that is achieved by an interaction 
between a human and an entity under a protocol [13]."   
"A service system consists of three subsystems: (i) an 
infrastructure, (ii) a substance, and (iii) a management to 
directly meet demands of humans who are defined as 
consumers. The infrastructure is of network, and substance 
“flows” over the infrastructure. The management plays the 
roles such as coordinating, leading, planning and controlling, 
which are applied to both the infrastructure and substance 
systems [13]."  
The substance in a service system may refer to: material, 
human or animal, energy, data or signal [13]. It is noted that 
a service system, in this paper, is also called a networked 
service system, as it has networked feature as mentioned in 
Introduction. 
Following the definitions above, we may have two 
important understandings: (1) a service system has different 
functions to meet human's different demands; in particular, a 
service system with only one function could be viewed as a 
special case, and (2) relationships between the multiple 
demands and the multiple supplies determine the safety 
performance of a service system; furthermore, the 
relationships are dynamic. 
C. 
Definitions of Resilience  
From the perspective of functions, the output of a service 
system are different functions, which are defined as supply 
functions, which are represented as 
iFS ,1
i
m
 
D
i
 where m is 
the number of supply functions. The demands from the 
customers are also expressed as functions, which are defined 
as demand functions, which are represented as 
F ,1
i
  m
. 
The relationships between the supply functions and demand 
functions, balance and imbalance, are defined as follows. 
Balance between the supply functions and the demand 
functions is defined as the relationship between the supply 
functions and demand functions which satisfies the 
conditions: 
,1
S
D
i
i
F
F
i

 
,
,1
i
m
 
m . Imbalance between the 
supply functions and the demand functions is defined as the 
relationship between the supply functions and demand 
functions 
which 
satisfies 
the 
conditions: 
. The situations of balance and 
imbalance may be transferable; a service system may be 
rebalanced. Rebalance is defined a process that a service 
system transfers from an imbalance situation to a balance 
situation. Thus, safety of a service system is defined as the 
dynamic balance between the multiple supply functions and 
the multiple demand functions. Such a definition of safety is 
quite different from traditional definition of safety. The 
traditional understanding of safety implies that if a system is 
not safe, there must be something wrong. However, the 
proposed definition above indicates that even there is nothing 
wrong in the system, it may be still not safe, as it may not 
meet the customers' demands. For example, a large athletic 
meeting leads to the demand of wireless communication in a 
particular area much larger than the supply provided by the 
regular wireless communication system. There are no 
damages in such a situation; however, the wireless 
communication system is not safe, as it could not meet the 
customers' demand.


The definition of safety above has shown that an unsafe 
service system is not necessarily damaged. Thus, the 
resilience definitions discussed in Section II do not well 
reflect the features of a service system, as they are related 
with partial damage situations. Our definition is given below. 
The resilience of a service system is defined as a 
property that allows the system rebalance the supply 
functions and demand functions from imbalance situations. 
Four remarks are given below for further explanation on this 
definition. 
Remark 1: According to the definition of safety above, 
imbalance situation means unsafe situation. 
Remark 2: A service could be examined through different 
perspectives, such as state, structure, functions and so on. 
The proposed definition of resilience implies that the 
resilience property should be examined from the perspective 
of function. 
Remark 3: Resilience does not aim at returning to the 
original states, or structure or functions of the system; it aims 
at making the supply functions meet the demand functions. 
Remark 4: The imbalance situation implies that the 
supply functions are less than the demand functions. 
Therefore, the key ability of resilience is to respond to the 
imbalance situation and to improve the supply functions to 
meet the demand functions.  
The proposed definition of resilience is different from 
other three categories of definitions of resilience introduced 
in Section I. According to the new definition of safety in this 
paper, category I is related to the balance situation of a 
service system. Category II could be viewed as a special case 
of the new definition, as it focuses on the imbalance 
situations of partially damage. Category III is an all-inclusive 
definition and  covers the scope of the new definition. 
III. 
RESILIENCE MEASUREMENT FOR SERVICE SYSTEM 
A. 
Criteria of Resilience Measurement 
Following the proposed definition in Section II, the 
resilience can be measured through the maximization of 
imbalance situation, which can be rebalanced with the 
bounded time and cost (or resources). Four important 
corollaries could be derived from the definition as the criteria 
of resilience measurement. 
Criterion 1: The resilience of a system is only measured 
in terms of particular imbalance situations. 
Criterion 2: A system which can rebalance the supply 
functions and demand functions from larger imbalance 
situation is more resilient. 
Criterion 3: A system which can rebalance the supply 
functions and demand functions from the imbalance situation 
with less time is more resilient. 
Criterion 4: A system which can rebalance the supply 
functions and demand functions from the imbalance situation 
with less cost (or resources) is more resilient. 
Based on these measurement criteria, it is obvious that 
there are three important factors affecting resilience 
performance: (1) rebalance solutions, (2) rebalance time, and 
96

(3) rebalance cost. For a networked service system under a 
particular imbalance situation, there may be different 
rebalance solutions and the best solution will determine the 
resilience performance of the system. The rebalance 
solutions certainly depend on the available rebalance time 
and resources. The criteria actually imply that given different 
conditions, there may be different measurements. For 
example, given rebalance time and cost, the measurement is 
maximization of imbalance situation. Given imbalance 
situation and available rebalance cost, the measurement is 
minimization of rebalance time. Next, two measures 
following Criterion 2 and Criterion 3 are expressed 
respectively. 
B. 
Resilience measurement following Criterion 2 
Criterion 2 is the main concern of resilience 
measurement. Based on Criterion 2, the following model is 
proposed to measure the resilience of a service system.

In the above, formula (1) represents the imbalance 
situation at beginning; formula (2) represents the constraint 
of rebalance time for different functions; formula (3) 
represents the resource constraints. 
3)A Simple Example of Transportation System: A very 
simple transportation system example is given to show how 
the model work. In this example, we only consider the 
maximum imbalance situation that the system can rebalance 
and the rebalance time and cost are ignored. Fig. 1 is an 
original transportation system with only two nodes. Two 
edges link the two nodes. The travel time and edge capacity 
are as shown in the figure. Suppose that the unit of travel 
time is minute. In this example, we consider the imbalance 
situation is that the transportation demand from A to B is 
increased to 15 per 2 minutes due to some reason. The 
rebalance solution is contraflow approach, namely reverse 
and edge from B to A, as shown in Fig. 2.  
 
Figure 1.  Original transportation system with only two nodes. 
 
Figure 2.  Rebalance solution. 
With the rebalance solution in Fig.2, the maximum 
transportation ability from A to B is 20 per minutes. 
Therefore, the largest imbalance situation that can be 
rebalanced is that the transportation demand from A to B 
increased to 20 and the imbalance degree is (20-10)/20=50%. 
Thus, the resilience of this transportation system facing the 
particular imbalance situation of increased transportation 
demand from A to B is 50%. 
C. 
Resilience measurement following Criterion 3 
Criterion 3 implies that given the same imbalance 
situation that could be rebalanced, the minimization of the 
rebalance time could be used to measure the resilience of a 
service system.

In the above, formula (4) represents the resilience of the 
system; formula (5) represents the resource constraints; 
formula (6) represents the constraint of rebalance time. 
3)An Example of Enterprise Information System: A 
simple example of enterprise information system is 
employed to show how the model works. An enterprise 
information system is a very special service system in that 
such a system usually has backup and could be rebalanced 
from even 100% lost of functions. We consider a scenario 
that an enterprise information system is fully damaged. 
There are two functions in this system, which are totally lost. 
There are two categories of resources. The total number of 
resource 1 is 2; the total number of resource 2 is 4. All the 
functions are treated with the same importance and the 
weight for each function is 0.5. Due to the limitation of 
resources, the two functions can not be rebalanced 
synchronously. This implies that a rebalance solution needs 
to choose a particular order among a set of rebalance tasks.

Obviously, the optimum solution for this problem is with the 
order of [1,2]. The fitness value is 0.857, which implies that 
the system could be rebalanced a little earlier than the 
demand recovery time.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper proposes a new definition of resilience for the 
networked service system by considering its important safety 
features. Furthermore, the measurement criteria of resilience 
are discussed. Following these criteria, two particular 
measures are presented with two simple examples to show 
how the measures work.  
This work describes only very preliminary results with 
the two models. As future work, realistic examples of 
networked service systems will be adopted to validate the 
proposed measures.
