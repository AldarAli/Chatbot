Abstract— This paper presents the design of a 77 GHz 4 × 4 
Butler matrix on a High Purity Fused Silica (HPFS) glass 
substrate for automotive radar applications. The design and 
3D Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of the 4 × 4 
Butler matrix beamformer has been conducted using an 
industry-standard CAD tool Advanced Design System (ADS) 
from Keysight™ Technologies. The 4 × 4 Butler matrix having 
a footprint area of 9.5 mm × 8.3 mm with 0.8-micrometer 
copper cladding thickness has been designed using a 0.2 mm 
thick HPFS glass as the microstrip dielectric substrate. The 
simulated insertion loss is –8 ± 2 dB. The return loss and 
isolation of the input ports are both below –20 dB respectively. 
This 4 × 4 Butler matrix can generate beam patterns at an 
elevation angle of –42˚, –15˚, 0˚, 15˚, and 42˚ when a 
corresponding port is excited. The maximum and minimum 
main lobe gain achieved are 20.322 dB and 16.763 dB 
respectively. These characteristics make the designed Butler 
matrix suitable for automotive radar applications, such as 
Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Collision Mitigation (CM), 
blind-spot detection, vehicle tracking, and pre-crash warning 
system.  
Keywords-  Butler matrix; microstrip beamformer; antenna 
array; beam steering; 3D FEM simulations. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The automotive radars have become the key enabling 
technology for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), autonomous 
driving, and Collision Mitigation (CM) applications for 
vehicles. Early automotive radars were designed to operate at 
24 GHz center frequency. However, the narrow bandwidth 
of such radars was not suitable to achieve necessary range 
and velocity accuracies. Their large size made the system 
bulkier as well. Consequently, the automotive manufacturers 
focused on developing automotive radars operating at 76 
GHz – 81 GHz frequency range to improve the range and 
velocity accuracies at a lower cost and smaller form factor 
following the regulations and recommendations of European 
Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI) and Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) [1], [2]. Additionally, 
as the millimeter waves at high frequencies undergo very 
less absorption in human tissues due to their lower 
penetration through the human skin [3], the 76 GHz – 81 
GHz is safer compared to 24 GHz. 
In any communication system, it is necessary to adjust 
the antenna beams in appropriate directions so that the 
electromagnetic signals are transmitted and received between 
the end users with minimum signal loss. Modern 
communication systems consist of multibeam array antennas 
which are typically backed by Radio Frequency (RF) 
beamformers to achieve the target of beam steering with 
wide angle coverage [4]. There are several RF beamformers, 
such as Butler matrix [5], Rotman lens [6], [7], Blass matrix 
[8] and Nolen matrix [9], [10]. Out of all these, the 
advantages of Butler matrix forces to be an ideal candidate in 
terms of size, manufacturing costs, bandwidth, reliability, 
and reciprocity; therefore, it is widely used in several 
applications such as Internet of Things (IoT), Wi-Fi, base 
station, satellite communications as well as automotive 
radars [11]–[19].  
The authors in [4] presented an excellent comprehensive 
analysis of available Butler matrices to conclude that a 
bilayer Butler matrix designed using meta-material substrate-
based transmission lines is more suitable for 5G applications. 
However, the design and fabrication of transmission lines 
with meta-material substrates for each component of the 
Butler matrix is complex and demand further technological 
advances.  
In [19], the design and fabrication of a 77 GHz planar 
Butler matrix implemented using a Substrate Integrated 
Waveguide (SIW) technology has been presented.  However, 
the fabrication of the device is complex as the 
implementation requires several metal vias to direct the 
propagation of electromagnetic signals to realize the 
beamforming and beam steering capability.  
Investigation by the authors of this paper show that as the 
microstrip transmission lines are comparatively easier to 
design and fabricate, the design and fabrication complexity 
of SIW based Butler matrix can be minimized by realizing 
an appropriate geometry microstrip Butler matrix with 
necessary input and output ports to achieve desired spatial 
resolutions.  Due to easier small form factor fabrication of 
such microstrip Butler matrices, they can be easily integrated 
to realize small form factor simpler but superior functionality 
automotive radars.  
Microstrip technology involves use of an appropriate 
substrate sandwiched between a conducting layer and a 
ground layer. The authors in [20], [21] recommended that 
glass substrates are better suited for W-band applications due 
to their superior performance compared to organic and 
ceramic substrates in terms of reliability, surface roughness,

loss tangent, thickness, dimensional and thermal stability. 
Accordingly, a HPFS glass substrate from Corning™ has 
been selected as the substrate material to design the target 77 
GHz center frequency 4 × 4 microstrip Butler matrix. The 
selected substrate has a low loss tangent (tan δ) of 0.0005, 
surface roughness < 10 Å, and a dielectric constant (εr) of 
3.82 at 77 GHz [22], [23]. 
In this context, this paper presents the design and 
simulation results of a HPFS glass substrate-based 77 GHz 4 
× 4 microstrip Butler matrix. The rest of the paper has been 
organized in the following manner: Section 1 describes the 
state-of-the-art of available Butler matrices and its need to be 
used in automotive radars. In Section 2, the theory and 
working principle of Butler matrix is described followed by 
the design and results of microstrip components and 
complete 4 × 4 Butler matrix. The beamforming capability of 
the designed 4 × 4 Butler matrix is also displayed. Section 3 
and 4 describes the conclusion and acknowledgement 
followed by references section. 
II. 
MICROSTRIP BUTLER MATRIX DESIGN 
The Butler matrix is a passive beamforming network 
having N input ports (beam ports) and N output ports, where 
N = 2n and n is a positive non-zero integer. Each input port is 
connected to all output ports with high isolation between 
input ports. During operation, an RF signal is fed at one of 
the input ports. The corresponding signals received at the 
output ports are fed to an antenna array such that the phase 
difference among the antenna array elements remains the 
same. The block diagram of a 4 × 4 Butler matrix composed 
of 90˚ hybrid couplers, crossovers, and 45˚ phase shifters is 
shown in Figure 1.  
  
 
Figure 1. Beamforming by 4 × 4 Butler matrix. 
 
In Figure 1, the Butler matrix is feeding a four-element 
linear antenna array. The detailed theories of operation a 
Butler matrix are available in [4], [5], [11]–[18]. 
     The operational phase parameters of the 4 × 4 Butler 
matrix in Figure 1 are provided in Table I. The radiation 
patterns are observed at a constant azimuthal angle (φ) = 
90˚. The equations to determine values of phase difference 
(∆ɸ) and beam angle (θ) are available in [18].  
The design challenge is to determine the optimized 
dimensions of the HPFS glass substrate-based 77 GHz 
microstrip transmissions lines to realize the 90˚ hybrid 
couplers, crossovers, and 45˚ phase shifters.

It was found through simulation studies by the authors 
that the microstrip width at the port terminals must be 
between 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm to excite the 77 GHz RF 
signals into the Butler matrix network with minimum return 
loss. The characteristic impedance of microstrip lines in the 
Butler matrix needs to be within 70 Ω and 100 Ω.  
A. 90˚ Hybrid Coupler 
The 90˚ hybrid coupler is a four-port directional coupler 
which is used to divide the input power equally at respective 
output ports and provide 90˚ phase difference across the 
output ports. Figure 2 shows the layout of the designed 90˚ 
hybrid coupler at 77 GHz in ADS. The corresponding 
widths and lengths are found by repetitive parametric 
optimization techniques in ADS and are listed in Table II.

The 3D FEM simulation results of the 90˚ hybrid 
coupler at 77 GHz frequency are shown in Figure 3. The 
phase shift between the output signals at port 2 and 3 of the 
90˚ hybrid coupler is 89.812 degrees. The simulated 
insertion loss between port 1 and port 2 is –3.412 dB and 
that between port 1 and port 3 is –3.57 dB. The return loss is 
–34.274 dB and isolation of port 1 and port 4 or port 2 and 
port 3 is –33.281 dB. 
B. Crossover  
A crossover is also a directional coupler used to spatially 
switch a signal in a planar geometry without any coupling. 
The typical design of a microstrip crossover involves the 
cascading two 90° hybrid couplers. However, as per the 
design requirements of 4 × 4 Butler matrix, the design of 0 
dB crossover was modified by connection of 90˚ curved 
bends at each port and optimized in ADS using 3D FEM 
simulations to get ideally 0 dB crossover. Figure 4 shows 
the layout of the designed microstrip crossover.

The performance values of the designed crossover 
shown in Figure 5 are optimum at frequency of 77 GHz. 
The isolation of port 1 and port 4 is –33.87 dB and that for 
port 1 and port 2 is –25.137 dB. The corresponding return 
loss is –39.614 dB. The insertion loss and phase shift 
between port 1 and port 3 is –1.081 dB and –0.181˚. 
C. 45˚ Phase Shifter 
The implemented phase shifter is a microstrip 
transmission line that is used to adjust the phases of the 
output signals of the various components in the Butler 
matrix. To obtain the phase distribution as listed in Table I, it 
is necessary to design 45˚ phase shifters.  
The 45˚ phase shifter as shown in Figure 6 was designed 
by optimizing the distance between the ports P1 and P2 and 
then tuning the length L2. The corresponding values of 
width and lengths are given in Table IV.

D. 4 × 4 Butler Matrix S-parameter Simulation 
After successfully optimizing the designs of 90° hybrid 
coupler, crossover, and 45° phase shifter, the components 
were then integrated as per the block diagram shown in 
Figure 1 to realize the complete 4 × 4 Butler matrix as 
shown in Figure 8. The beam ports 1L, 2R, 2L, and 1R are 
the same as P1, P2, P3, and P4 respectively. The total 
footprint area of the completed 4 × 4 Butler matrix is 9.5 
mm × 8.3 mm. Figure 9 shows the S-parameters of the

between port 2 or 3 and ports 5, 6, 7, and 8 are between –7.4 
dB and –10 dB. The return losses at respective ports are 
below –20 dB and isolation of adjacent input ports is below 
–20 dB.

15˚, respectively for azimuth angle (φ) = 90˚ as shown in 
Figure 11 and Figure 12. The beam angle phase error is ±7˚ 
from the expected beam angle phase given in Table 1. The 
maximum gain of 20.322 dB is observed on excitation of 
port 4. The minimum gain of 16.763 dB is observed on 
excitation of port 2. The difference between main lobe level 
and side lobe levels is higher than 14 dB when port 1 (or 
1L) and port 4 (or 1R) is excited but lower than 10 dB when 
port 2 (or 2R) and port 3 (or 2L) are excited.

     When all the input ports are excited, the signal is

pattern is observed at θ = 0˚ as shown in Figure 13 and 
Figure 14. The respective gain of the main lobe is 17.357 
dB. The difference between main lobe level and side lobe 
levels is significantly more than 11 dB.

CONCLUSION 
The designed 77 GHz microstrip 4 × 4 Butler matrix on a 
0.2 mm thick HPFS glass substrate has the potential to 
provide superior performance at a lower cost, smaller size, 
and thickness to realize compact radars to improve road 
safety and driving comfort for vehicles with advanced driver-
assistance system (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. It was 
observed that the glass substrate from Corning™ has 
superior loss characteristics to minimize insertion loss at 
high frequencies. However, optimization of the phase 
characteristics and insertion losses in a 3D FEM simulation 
environment requires more than 500 GB of memory. The 
time taken by ADS solvers to run one simulation is 
computationally extensive. Further optimization is necessary 
to improve the insertion loss and the phase error. Initial 
investigation shows that the device can be fabricated using a 
standard microfabrication technique, such as the lift-off 
process available in any standard microfabrication facility. 
The device will be fabricated and tested once the 
optimization process is completed.
