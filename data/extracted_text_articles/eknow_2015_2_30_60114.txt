Abstract— In this study, we surveyed correlation of website
access
by
user
environment.
Correlations
can
help
us
understand differences in user behavior that vary by time by
place, or by user environment. We also found the user
behavior tracking like visit numbers or page dwell time
categorized by user segmentation is effective. For example,
mobile device usage rate is higher in non-working hours than
working hours and viewed pages are different. We confirmed
user environment segments with a correlation approach can be
used for web analytics for user navigation studies or even
marketing use.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Business-to-Business (B to B) manufacturer websites
have changed in role and responsibility since use of the
Internet has become widespread even among hardware
engineers. The purpose of visiting a website has changed
from searching for technical documents into searching for
solutions or products without any face-to-face contact. In B
to B manufacturer industry, traditionally sales related activity
or even marketing related activity was tied to face-to-face
salespersons’ activity. In this period, the website’s role was
for searching and for providing technical documents or
technical
software
resources.
With
the
growth
of
e-
commerce, users have become hesitant to meet salespeople
and at the same time the manufacturer wants to track user
behavior on the web and utilize analytic data for marketing
and improving sales figures.
According to “The End of Solution Sales,” Harvard
Business Review, July-August 2012, a recent Corporate
Executive Board study of more than 1,400 B to B customers
found that those customers completed, on average, nearly
60% of a typical purchasing decision—researching solutions,
ranking options, setting requirements, benchmarking pricing,
and so on—before even having a conversation with a
supplier.“
This means many B to B customers select
products/solutions and even buy them without intervention
from salespeople. This means the website is becoming more
important than before even from a business point of view
even though it was used only for information delivery in the
past. That is why we need study on dedicated B to B web site
analytics.
We have been studying web metrics methodology and
actual user behaviors just dedicated to B to B manufacturer
websites. In our past survey, there were two purposes for
Business to Business (B to B) web analytics: (1) Improve
and optimize the site for users by path analysis; and (2) Use
in marketing activities. Compared to B to C web analytics, B
to B web analytics have the following three characteristics:
(a) In many cases, the buyer is not the same person as the
web user. So it is important to analyze all the users from the
same company or organization as a single unit. That can be
stated as B to B to C web analytics, not simply B to B.
(b) The goal of visitors to the website is often not only to
make a purchase. Main conversions can be downloading a
file, making an e-mail subscription or inquiring online.
(c) It is rare for a user to complete their goal within a
single session. In most cases, users require multiple sessions
spread out over a long period of time to complete their goal.
In past studies, we came up with proposals for B to B
website analytics and also we studied the effectiveness of
web analytics by user segmentation and especially the
importance of page dwell time.
In this study, we try to
examine web analytics by user environment and see the
effectiveness from this point of view.
User environment
means user access hours (time of day), connection type, and
device type, etc. This study’s data is based on web access
data for a Japanese website from 2014 January 1st to
September 30th from a global B to B manufacturing company.
Section II presents previous work. Section III shows user
segmentation and focus metrics. Section IV is a study on
visit times and dwell time by hours and connection type.
Section V is web analysis findings by segmentation by
content directory. Section VI shows analytics by web
connected devices. Section VII is about major findings and
we have conclusion in Section VIII.
II.
PREVIOUS STUDIES
In our previous studies, we came up with a web analytics
scheme for B to B websites and we defined B to B site
conversion types and the importance of user registration on
web. This is the first study of B to B type conversion related
[16]. In another study, we checked effectiveness of page
dwell time as well as traditional metrics like page views,
unique users, visits and conversion rate. [15].
We
found
the
importance
of
registered
versus
unregistered user segmentation and confirmed user behavior
is different in each segment [17]. There are many studies on
web metrics for e-commerce behavior [2] and a study on

personalization metrics on web [11], and studies on web
metrics related to the B to B market [8].There have also been
general web analytic studies. [1][3]-[7][9][10][12]-[14].

USER SEGMENTATION AND FOCUS METRICS IN THIS
STUDY
We categorized potential segmentation as shown in Table
I.
In
the
previous
study,
we
saw
content
category
segmentation and some others. In this study, we focus on
connection type and the time period in which users are
accessing the manufacturer’s website. We wanted to see the
difference in behavior by user environment (Time and Place).

IV.
VISIT TIMES AND DWELL TIME BY HOURS AND
CONNECTION TYPE
As a quick reference, for a B to B web site there is much
difference in traffic between weekdays and weekends.
However, the trends of traffic by time of day show almost
the same peaks across all days. Figure 1 shows general trend
in web visit number by hours.
Figure 1.
General trend in web visit number by hours
According to the statistics provided by the Japan Institute
for Labor Policy and Training shown in [18], "hours of work
per week, manufacturing" is 42.2 per week. Also, “9:00 AM
to 7:00 PM” are typical working hours in Japan. We defined
three time periods as “1. Home and commuting”, “2. Work”,
and “3. Commuting and home”. Firstly, we tracked user
accesses by time period with consideration to company size.
Normally small-sized companies or individual engineers
tend to use normal internet providers and middle or large-
scale companies use their own domains. We tracked them by
time of day distinguishing the users who came through
normal domains and users who came through internet
providers (called “Providers”).
Figure 2 shows a visit
numbers trend.
Figure 2.
Visit numbers by time of day through providers and company
domain
As a result the total coefficient of correlation of company
and provider users is 0.59 and middle level of correlation
(Similar trends) but if we omit the times from 1:00 AM to
9:00 AM, there is a strong correlation of 0.78. This means
trends are similar throughout the day except for one time
period. Only the time period between 1:00 AM and 9:00 AM
shows some difference in numbers between “via providers”
and “via company domain”. To illustrate this in more detail,
Figure 3 shows visit numbers between 1:00 AM and 9:00
AM by hour. From late night to morning we assume some
engineers work at home or work at small companies which
use connections through providers.
This kind of data is useful for deciding which content
should be shown or targeted to customers accessing the
website at each time of day. Also, it can be assumed that
provider users are made up of not just customers but also a
general audience who are looking for IR information,
company information or even some news through the sites.
In fact during this time period numbers for these contents are
relatively higher than during business hours. The proportion
of IR/press release visits are 33% higher compared to normal
working hours.

Figure 3.
Visit numbers by time of day through providers and company
domain from 1:00 AM to 9:00 AM
Next we looked at the page dwell time. Please refer to
Figure 4. This is average of page dwell time by each hour
for providers and company domain.The total coefficient of
correlation is 0.68 for access via providers and via company
domains. However, if we calculate the correlation for
outside working hours, i.e. 7:00 PM to 1:00 AM, the
correlation is 0.94. We can see some difference between the
connection types for this hours. This shows the possibility
of differences in usage between provider users and company
users. The types of pages that are actually viewed are
different.
Generally,
company
users
view
purchasing
information more and provider users view more press
releases or IR information.
We will investigate which
information is accessed more in our next study.
Figure 4.
Page dwell time by time of day through providers and company
domain
Please refer to Figure 5 for page dwell time by time of
day by connection type. Page dwell time for small-sized
customers who use providers peak at 10:00 PM and they
probably work from home or on trains while commuting in
Japan. This can be related to the fact that trains are the most
common way of commuting in Japan. Also, for company
domain users this could indicate engineers working on
development overnight.

domain from 7:00 PM to 1:00 AM
Figure 6.
Correlation of visits from 19:00 to 1:00
Figure 6 shows correlation of visits from 19:00 to 1:00.
Visit number is correlated between them and not su much
difference.
V.
ANALYSIS BY DIRECTORY
We surveyed the correlation between provider users and
company users in terms of several segments. Firstly, we
looked at correlation by content category (directory). There
is a strong correlation for dwell time between providers and
companies shown in TABLE II. TABLE II shows correlation
coefficient in page dwell time for each hour and connection
type. However, there is some different correlation just for
some directories. Referring to TABLE III, the search
function is one area of differentiation, especially in the 1:00
45

eKNOW 2015 : The Seventh International Conference on Information, Process, and Knowledge Management

to 9:00 zone. Correlation here is lower than other periods.
The number of searches performed by provider users is
lower than those performed by company users. It is assumed
that normally mobile access is through providers and these
users are viewing websites during their train commute and
do not search for any solutions or products but do view press
releases or events during this time.

Actually the company in this study tries to provide a
different user interface to different customers depending on
the time period. For 19:00 to 1:00, some navigation
elements are changed with A/B testing, and the conversion
rate for downloads is 125 times higher for time targeting.
This type of analysis can be used for marketing purposes.
For this purpose we will keep studying for further details.
VI.
ANALYSIS BY DEVICE
We also looked at the relationship by device. We cannot
see the actual device that a user owns but we can see
information on OS (Operating System). There is much less
correlation between providers and company trends in the
time periods “1:00 AM to 9:00 AM” and “7:00 PM to 1:00
PM”. Most likely the mobile device usage rate is higher in
non-working hours than working hours as shown in TABLE
IV and TABLE V. Both table show correlation coefficient in
page dwell time for each hour and connection type.
Currently, unlike B to C sites the layout of most B to B sites
is not mobile device compliant. However, B to B sites need
to think about mobile device compliance especially for users
who access through providers.

There is much difference between time and connection
type and there is possibility navigation can be further
optimized according to time of day or connection type.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
We found the user behavior tracking like visit numbers
or page dwell time categorized by user segmentation is
effective. Especially the accesses like time and place (or
connection type) have different trend by each segments. For
example the time period between 1:00 AM and 9:00 AM
shows some level of difference in numbers between “via
providers” and “via company domain”. Also, for page dwell
time 7:00 PM to 1:00 AM time period has differentiations
between providers and companies. Also, depending on
content type we found some difference. For example in the
1:00 to 9:00 zone user behavior is different and the number
of searches performed by provider users is lower than those
performed by company users. It is assumed that normally
mobile access is through providers and these users are
viewing websites during their train commute and do not
search for any solutions or products but do view press
releases or events during this time. We also looked at the
relationship by device. We found that mobile device usage
rate is higher in non-working hours than working hours and
also viewed pages are different between them.
VIII.
CONCLUSIONS
We have been trying to study the effectiveness of web
analytics for a B to B manufacturer site with several studies.
We defined some of the segment models and examined web
access using some segments.
In this study, we surveyed
correlation of access by user environment. There are
correlations between time of day or correlation between
connection types such as connecting through a provider or
through a company network. We used some key web metrics
such as visits and page dwell time for our correlation survey.
We noticed user environment segments with a correlation
approach can be used for web analytics for user navigation
studies or even marketing use. With the results of this study
we will keep testing and doing analytics for targeted pages or
targeted navigation by user environment as our next study.
