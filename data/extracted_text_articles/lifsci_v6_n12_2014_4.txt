Abstract—This paper considers connected strands of thinking 
in the area of socio info techno systems emerging from Sydney 
University, Complex Civil Systems Group, the Advanced 
Research and Assessment Group (ARAG), Cambridge 
University, Engineering Design Centre, the Information 
Management Division at the University of Hong Kong and the 
School of Business, Leadership and Enterprise at University 
Campus Suffolk.  The paper is divided into six sections. First, 
it examines the synthesis of the machine and the organization 
in what has been termed mechorganics; then, it identifies the 
Lodestone concept as a means for instrumenting social 
awareness; before considering the role variety plays in 
collaboratively influencing complex systems, over time, and 
coordinating and controlling them, in time. Having established 
the bases, the paper then develops a lifecycle model applied, in 
this instance, to the health sector. Finally, it examines the needs 
for assaying information and data as a means of providing the 
social transparencies needed for real time verification and 
validation. From this, it posits the needs for simple empirical 
standards and setting/vetting organizations that encourage 
good behavior and discourage bad. These standards’ 
organizations provide for the governance and assurances 
necessary for packet-markets to form where transactions / 
prices can be assured, products verified, exchanges made and 
fees / taxes abstracted.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
This paper is developed from a paper presented at 
SOTICS 2013 entitled The Need for Synthetic Standards in 
Managing Cyber Relationships [1]. In this paper, we 
consider Cyber may consist of two sub-systems identified 
and classified as being “Coordination Rule and Control 
(CRC)” and “Collaboration and Social Influence (CSI)” [2, 
3]. These system attributes provide the necessary and 
“requisite variety” [4] to enable both control, “in time”, and 
influence [5]-[9], “over time”. In this regard, Cyber may 
consist of two poles:    
 A technologically bounded, largely immeasurable, 
strongly scientific, stochastic coordination, rule and 
control space; comprising virtual-media and the display of 
data dealing with the real communication of facts; and the 
conceptualization of alternative possibilities, themselves 
capable of generating hard physical and soft more social 
effects and collaboratively influencing them [10]. 
“Mechorganics” is postulated to have 1) a thematic 
systems identity (defined by its networked disciplines) and 2) 
a critical and functional education base [11,12]. It is not seen 
either as ‘a reversion of digital data back to an analogue 
form’ [13] or some form of ‘Golem’ warned of by Wiener 
[14]. Mechorganics is based on “designing humanity back 
into the loop” [15,16] and: ‘the synergistic combination of 
civil mechanical systems engineering, social network 
dynamics, ICT and the management of interconnected 
knowledge, information (and data) infrastructures in the 
designing and composing of adaptive (resilient and 
sustainable) organizations’ [15].  
The “Lodestone” concept arose from a concern that the 
“Cyber-pole” applying Coordination, Rule and Control 
(CRC) was being emphasized at the expense of the whole 
and specifically the pole dealing with collaboration and 
social influence. The result, it was conjectured, was twofold: 
first, that government was becoming irrelevant to many 
social-media users and, secondly, that this was creating a 
vacuum in which less benign influences might flourish. For 
example, studies of social networking and identity have 
shown that there is a strong tendency to connect like-to-like 
[17]. This narrowing focus potentially reduces societal 
variety and makes people less tolerant to alternative ideas

and ontologies than their ‘non-digital forebears’. They may, 
in actual fact, become non-democratic, xenonetworks (from 
xenophobia, xenonetworks are ‘social networks with a strong 
dislike or fear of other networks or ideas that appears foreign 
or strange to them’) [3], extremely hostile to alternative ideas 
(and that they might be wrong). Discussion at the time was 
focused (as it remains largely today) on finding information 
‘keystones’, ‘architectures’, ‘protocols’ or ‘gateways’ not so 
much to assist people identify good information from bad but 
to control. A problem with each of these concepts is that they 
obtrusively and exclusively focus on the stable, static (hence 
keystone) and ergodic, as opposed to the dynamic and non-
ergodic. The “Information Lodestone” concept recalled the 
semi-mythical lodestones of antiquity that enabled ancient 
mariners both to determine / ‘fix’ their position and 
simultaneously steer a safe course. The objective is to design 
a non-obtrusive, dynamic instrument. In this respect, we are 
commencing work with Health and manufacturers of 
sensitive materials, to model and identify data / information 
flows and the potential for leaks along complicated, sensitive 
lines-of-communication in which knowledge assurances, 
e.g., for operating on patients, are essential. Other work is 
being undertaken to teach life systems management skills to 
young people, with an emphasis on either metamatics (the 
mathematics of cyber-social and cyber-physical systems) or 
metadetics, as defined in this paper. We consider this to be 
exciting work, on the cutting edge of our science, essential to 
enabling the emerging Knowledge Enterprise Economies of 
the 21st Century. 
This paper is divided into six sections. In Section II, the 
cyber-system is considered as it relates to the individual and 
at the social level. In the next section, means for 
instrumenting the Cyber are posited from which we then 
posit the types of setting and standards that might apply. This 
is then used as the bases for modeling a health life system as 
applied to the Australian Radiologist profession. Finally, 
inclusive designs and standards to enable people to 
sensemake within new and emerging cyber and synthetic 
ecologies are posited. 
II. 
CYBER AS A SOCIAL BEING 
The informal motto of the Lodestone Project was 
suggested as ‘conscius in res’ or “sense-in-being”, relating to 
Badiou’s [18] understanding of “being”, when he states: 
‘what happens in art, in science, in true (rare) politics, and in 
love (if it exists), is the coming to light of an indiscernible of 
the times, which, as such, is neither a known or recognized 
multiple, nor an ineffable singularity, but that which detains 
in its multiple-being all the common traits of the collective in 
question: in this sense, it is the truth of the collective’s 
being’. The idea of multiple-beings holds within it the traits 
of the social being at the heart of most systems and 
organizations. It is their truths and trusts that “detain the 
common traits of the collective in question”. When these 
trusts dissipate or are allowed to wither, the organization 
may remain as a physical entity (when a building becomes 
statue) but its essence and being – its “ineffable singularity” 
– is no longer [19]. It is conjectured that, by dealing with 
cyber exclusively as an info-techno construct, many 
organizations lost sight of their “social being”. 
Considering the Cyber as two poles, it is suggested that 
one has more info/techno-socio traits; the other more socio-
info/techno, in which, building on work by Harmaakorpi et 
al. [20], [17], it is posited that: ‘Info-Techno-Socio systems 
seek to program (as opposed to programme) the relationship 
between technical processes and humans by digitizing 
performance fidelity and coding for repeatable risk free 
procedures in computer-control-spaces so that data and 
communication do not [temporally] contradict each other ’ 
[21]. By contrast: ‘Socio-Info-Techno systems stress the 
reciprocal interrelationship between humans and computers 
to foster improved shared awareness for agilely shaping the 
social programmes of work, in such a way that humanity and 
ICT [control] programs do not contradict each other ’[21]. 
The two systems are also considered in terms of their 
signatures, where I-T-S systems are considered as strong-
signal systems [22]-[25], in which: ‘Control (through 
switching) of Information, Data and Communication are the 
key variables’ after, Castells [26] and Sokol [27]. And weak-
signal S-I-T systems [22]-[25], in which: ‘Influence (through 
shared awareness) of Information and abstracted social 
Knowledge are the key variables’, after Castells [26]. 
Most of us intuitively know the type of organization we 
would wish to be working for. Warren and Warren (1977) 
considered this in terms of “organizational health” and 
concluded that ‘healthy organizations’ have ‘a critical 
capacity for solving problems’, [28]. They identified three 
dimensions of connectedness (see also Thibaut and Kelley 
[29]): identification with the organization (they referred to as 
neighborhood); 
interstitial 
interaction 
within 
the 
organization 
and 
existential 
linkages 
outside 
the 
organization.  
Considerations of health apply equally to organizations 
working with/in the Cyber and their capacity for “problem 
solving” and so controlling, in time, and influencing, over 
time. This research is developed further in Section V. It is 
contended that successful companies are constantly 
“balancing” between the exploitative (delivered in time by 
coordination, rule and control) and the explorative (delivered 
over time through collaborative social influence). The 
capacity for balancing between coordination & control (the 
exploitative) 
and 
collaboration 
and 
influence 
(the 
explorative) to keep an organization “in kilter” is known as 
“ambidexterity” [30]. It is suggested that this ability to 
dynamically balance between the exploitative and the 
explorative is indicative of a systems ability to “problem 
solve” and, therefore, of its health.

As humans learn, it is thought that they develop a critical 
capacity for problem solving based upon their individual 
social system model. This capacity for systems and critical 
thinking can be taught and is seen as a necessary pre-
requisite for understanding and dealing with complexity. In 
this regard, from Lever et al. [31], it is considered that:  
Systems Thinking may be the ability to determine 
appropriate options for leading, managing, designing, 
engineering and modeling complex systems, taking 
adequate empirical account of different system types, 
configurations, dynamics and constraints, and 
Critical Thinking may be the ability to ask the right 
questions and make useful sense of information that is 
technically 
complex, 
incomplete, 
contradictory, 
uncertain, 
changing, 
non-ergodic 
and 
subject 
to 
competing claims and interests. 
After Dreyfus & Dreyfus [32], it is suggested we all have 
an individual ‘meta-datum’ that reference what is posited as 
our “metadetic spheroid” [32]-[34]. This gives rise to 
concepts of “metadetic-datum”, with similarities to a 
geodetic datum used to “reference” the spheroidal model of 
the earth being applied, e.g., World Geodetic System (WGS) 
84. Individual metadetic spheroids may be broadly similar. 
How they are referenced – in other words their datum – is 
seen to affect how humans’ process information and what 
they perceive. A metadetic-spheroid is an individual’s model 
(no matter how incomplete) of the sociodetic-spheroidal 
“beings” / organizations they inhabit; see Fig. 1. The meta-
datum achieves the best “fit” of an individual’s metadetic-
spheroid to what may be thought of as its “sociodetic-
spheroid” describing the overall model of the related social 
system. 
 
Figure 1.  Sociodetic / Metadetic Spheroids and Datums 
Bunge [35] maintains that ‘perception is personal; whereas 
knowledge is social’. An individual’s perception of their 
“sociodetic spheroidal system” is incomplete. Only by 
“collaboratively 
connecting” 
with 
“others” 
metadetic 
spheroids may an individual begin to “map” the sociodetic 
spheroidal whole. It is this process of “collaborative 
sensemaking” that moves what is effectively static, 
positional information and data to the social and dynamical 
knowledge of “being”.  
Markov chains applied within Bayesian Belief Networks 
[36] were considered by Logan and Moreno [37] in terms of 
‘Meta-State-Vectors’ referenced to ‘Meta-Data’ [32]-[34]. 
Meta-State-Vectors (MSVs) relate to the idea of some 
information containing “indicators” that will be identified 
immediately against an individual’s metadetic-datum without 
the need for preamble / additional processing. MSVs are 
therefore distinguishable from serial information; from 
which ‘expert’ human processors ‘can form diagnostic 
hypotheses and draw rational conclusions from system 
patterns [and] critical reflection of their own meta-datum’ 
[32]. In terms of collaboration and shared awareness, this 
should enable individuals to ‘make better use of one 
another’s expertise’ [39], particularly if ‘authenticated’ [39], 
validated and verified. 
In a social system, there also exists the risk of knowledge 
blindness or “blind knowledge” [40,41]. Models of 
“info/techno-socio 
exchange” 
and 
“socio-info/techno 
knowledge capture” therefore need to differentiate ‘between 
the active physical and technological capture of data and 
information’ [42, 43] and the socio-info/techno exchange of 
knowledge [44]-[49]. To understand how the best “fit” is to 
be achieved between the info/techno-socio “machine” and 
the socio-info/techno organizational “being”, it is necessary 
to identify the system’s ecology and its purpose / role within 
it. If an organization’s purpose is to problem solve, then how 
it maps its sociodetic spheroid and positions its datum will 
determine its health and future fitness judged by its ability to 
‘test for both success and failure’ [50].     
III. 
INSTRUMENTING THE CYBER 
At the turn of the millennium, the old UK Defence 
Research Agency (DERA) was undertaking trials of 
networked soldiers at the British Army Training Unit in 
Suffield (BATUS), Canada. Soldiers had all been issued with 
GPS. As reported to the first author, the result was “digital” 
in terms of the troops’ movement, which was recorded as 
being “stop and go”. Troops would stop, find out where they 
were, report their position and then move. The researcher 
removed GPS from the soldiers and caused them to return to 
map and compass. The result was dramatic. Soldiers began 
to interpret their datum against the map and to use their 
senses to determine progress. They used the compass to 
provide analogue direction and their bearing to dynamically 
align their datum. 
After the Heisenberg principle, Price [51] suggests that ‘it 
is impossible to determine simultaneously both the position 
and momentum of a particle with any great degree of 
accuracy or certainty’. This led the first author to surmise a 
potential metaphor for the modern age: ‘that we know 

44
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 6 no 1 & 2, year 2014, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/
2014, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
precisely where we are but we no longer know where we are 
going’. Although causality is hard to attribute [52], it may be 
possible to apply the Heisenberg principle as a useful rule-
of-thumb when designing dynamic (non-ergodic) systems by 
suggesting that: 
‘the more precisely one measures a position, the less 
able one may identify change, over time, and vice versa’ 
[19]. 
This has specific implications for system designs noting 
the predilection in recent years to emphasize metrication and 
the setting of targets / goals etc. for managing organizations. 
Reported separately [19],[53], instead of improving shared 
awareness, the excess of information and targets required as 
a form of control can detract from work [54] and so 
collaboration and shared awareness. This suggested that 
reducing collaborative and shared awareness impacts 
negatively an organization’s ability to problem solve. Ipso 
facto, 
these 
exploitative 
type 
organizations 
become 
unhealthy and potentially, even, risky places to be. 
 
Figure 2.  Three Needs Model (3NM) 
In addressing the failures of government and collective 
(collegial) intelligence prior to 9/11 and the Iraq War, the US 
9/11 Commission [55] and the (Lord) Butler Enquiry [56] in 
the UK identified the failure of governance specifically in 
terms of the digital ecologies, then in existence. What they 
saw was that essential information existed, but that it was 
being 
missed, 
mislaid 
and, 
critically, 
not 
shared. 
Furthermore, they saw confusion between data, information 
and communication networks (essentially ICT) and what was 
being identified and abstracted in terms of knowledge and 
actionable intelligence that could be appropriately shared 
and used across government, in real time. Busy Secretary’s 
of State, Ministers, government officials / business / industry 
/ financial leaders and project / programme directors, 
managers, administrators, users, agents and other consumers 
of actionable intelligence were being overwhelmed in a 
deluge of data and information technology, process and 
methodology that was quite literally blinding them to what 
was vital; what was strategic; what was operational; what 
was routine; what was base level knowledge (against which 
change and perturbations might ‘show up’ (be envisioned)) 
and what was simply background noise. Organizational 
structures had not simply atrophied but had become ‘tuned 
out’ – no longer able to select between the vital weak-signals 
of innovation, adaptation and change (as threat or 
opportunity) and the strong-signals of method and process 
[22]-[24],[57],[58]. Recommendations arising from 9/11 
[55,56] and the Global Financial Crisis were three fold: 
firstly has been to require greater transparency, e.g., between 
the banks, investors, borrowers and governments; secondly, 
has been to demand greater regulation and thirdly, to move 
away from the need to know control model towards what has 
been described as the three needs model – need to know; 
need-to-share; need-to-use (3NM) [43].  
Knowledge blindness [41] was also seen in the run-up to 
the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), when public and private 
organizations / individuals capable of identifying alternative 
futures were no longer able to communicate / be listened to: 
‘It is remarkable that the advanced research and assessment 
group…put the danger of a global financial collapse into the 
[UK] draft national security strategy [in 2005/6], but were 
told to take it out, presumably for political reasons, before it 
occurred’ [59]. 
In this respect, Szilard’s warning that ‘information is 
expensive to acquire and use’ [60] and Bunge’s recognition 
that ‘knowledge is social’ [35] had been potentially lost in 
the noise of new IT, methods and processes. The Lodestone 
project was conceived from this confusion and a recognition 
that ‘today’s economy and society is totally reliant on 
technology as an enabling force for all economic and societal 
activities’ [61]. It identified the potential of societal cascades 
in which ‘a failure of a very small fraction of nodes in one 
network may lead to the complete fragmentation of a system 
of several interdependent networks’ [62].  
 
Figure 3.  Multiple Meshed Sociodetic / Organisational System Model

The series of cascades considered at the time (2009/10) 
included UK strategic failure in Iraq and Afghanistan [63] 
and the global financial crisis. Significantly, an undermining 
in binding societal trusts and assurances were seen 
simultaneously to be occurring / had the potential to occur, 
such as the UK MPs honors and expenses scandals; 
connecting to the phone hacking scandal that implicated 
media, police and politicians; to the failure of the BBC to 
protect young and vulnerable people; to the 2010 UK student 
riots and the 2011 “London” riots.  Each of these cascades 
began / was exacerbated in the Cyber as, potentially, they 
will also be resolved. Consequently, it was seen as being 
necessary 
‘to 
protect…information 
infrastructure 
technologies…a strategic core [of] which must be 
maintained, i.e., the Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) / 
Critical Information Infrastructure (CII)’.  
It was recognized that ‘small incremental changes and / or 
large-scale modifications can drastically shape and reshape 
both the economy and its society with known and often 
unknown 
consequences, 
due 
to 
ever-increasing 
interconnectivities and growing complexities … especially, 
the information technologies that have come to pervade 
virtually all aspects of life’ [64] – hence “societal cascades”. 
This led to the development of an ‘Assurance Case Approach 
methodology for individual CII assets to input into the larger 
Business Information Environment’, ‘the development of a 
Mesh case that can be visualized as the 3-D atomic structure 
of a molecule’ and which ‘provides a lateral approach for 
interdependencies between individual assurance cases’ [61]. 
The “multiple” mesh envisioned represents the sociodetic 
spheroidal “being” described by Fig. 3 and relates to both 
interdependencies and assurances to provide overarching 
confidence in the system whole. Protecting the system whole 
and providing for resilience and responsiveness required a 
flexible, adaptive and ambidextrous CSI ‘approach over time 
and real-time’, CRC mechanisms for interacting directly 
with ‘dynamic information ecosystems’ [61], in time. 
IV. 
SETTING CYBER STANDARDS 
Regulations and controls can be antithetical to creating a 
shared aware and collaborative ecology and enabling the 
necessary transparencies for encouraging good behavior and 
discouraging bad [53]. The three needs model aims to create 
an information assurance / business security layer between 
the user (pull) and the knowledge (push) custodian [43], see 
Fig. 2. There are significant challenges to the managing of 
information and data allowing for successful, inclusive 
means for identifying / testing when information and data 
has been tampered with, changed, added to or where leakage 
points may occur. Examples include the loss (probably 
through accounting errors and multiple packet switching) of 
sensitive materials, e.g., in the explosives industry for 
products that have to be accounted for to the milligram. 
Similarly, limited information and data tracking (including 
asset tracking), e.g., in the health service, means that safety 
critical equipment can become mislaid or misapplied; so 
placing patients at risk. During the recent Europe-wide meat 
scandal an inability to track information and data and test / 
verify it for validity at key stages of the supply chain, 
enabled graft and fraud to take place across the whole. 
Throughout history, successful economies have been 
based upon the accurate and reliable “assaying” of materials, 
such as metals (gold) and food. These social transfer points 
also became the opportunity for reliable trade and pricing 
moments and so taxation. Scales and weights were regularly 
tested and subject to daily public scrutiny – they created 
transparencies 
for 
encouraging 
good 
behavior 
and 
identifying bad. Similar open-social “assaying standards” 
that can be used to assess information and data in terms of its 
goodness, purity and proof are harder to find. And there is 
not a simple and readily available instrument such as a “scale 
and weights” or “map and compass” that can be applied 
unobtrusively at different stages of often complex supply 
chains to verify and validate information & data flows and 
leakages. This does four things: it limits transparencies; so 
encouraging graft / crime; consequently reducing the 
opportunities for legitimate business / taxation and 
discouraging good behavior.  
In his theory of the firm, Coase [65] argues that the reason 
for firms forming is to enable ‘employer and employee 
relations with regard to cost’, which ‘were necessary to 
understanding the working of firms and organizations’. He 
suggested that ‘governance is chosen in a cost effective 
degree to infuse order, thereby to mitigate conflict and 
realize mutual gain’ [65]. It follows that regulations and 
controls that fail to ‘mitigate conflict and realize mutual 
[collaborative] gain’ create unhealthy ecologies by limiting 
organizational problem solving capacities [53]. In his Law of 
Requisite Variety, Ashby [4] maintains that ‘only variety can 
control variety’ and that ‘for every control one needs a 
controller’. 
Reported 
separately 
[19],[53],[66], 
‘organizations under control, may never be more shared 
aware than the sum of their links’. By contrast, organizations 
that enable collaborative social influence can ‘generate, on 
average, 12.5% more [linkages] than formally specified’ 
[19]. Furthermore, these organizations can adapt, over time, 
to different levels of control. In other words, these ‘new’ 
linkages also provide the ‘variety necessary to control 
variety’ – so meeting Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety.  
V. 
A SOCIODETIC HEALTH LIFE-SYSTEM 
Law & Callon state that ‘the technical thus is social’ 
[67]. Not only may the technological be social but, as 
previously noted, Bunge [35] attests, ‘knowledge is social’ 
also. A key conclusion to be drawn from this is that 
mechorganic designs that consider the social as technical and 
remove from the technical its social knowledge, strip from an 

46

organization its heart and very ‘being’ [18],[68] – hence 
knowledge stripping [21].  
Given its highly socialized technical setting, the 
Radiology specialization was identified as being an early 
indicator – a canary – for the “health” of the medical 
profession [69]-[71]. Representing approximately 6% of 
graduating medical students in Australia, the 12 year 
education programme (from commencing medical studies) is 
one of the longest specialist professional pipelines [72]. 
Compared to a graduate employee, radiologists spend three 
times as long in Higher Education, Table I, and for every 
year in education; 1.2 years working. Given these 
constraints, the profession may be highly susceptible to 
minor changes in recruiting and retention flows. It is also 
possible that a 6% radiologist-extraction rate (from medical 
schools / universities) represents a long term constant. In 
which case, based on US Figures [73], for every extra 
radiologist an additional 20 medical students (allowing for 
drop-outs) would need to start at Medical School – but such 
a simple measure may not reflect those medical students 
actually wanting / desiring to become radiologists. 
TABLE I.  
HIGHER EDUCATION WORKING PARAMETERS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A question asked of the profession was that of its 
sociodetic ‘face’ in terms of its profile and age. In other 
words, ‘what is the face of the Australian Radiology 
profession today and what does the profession think it 
should be?’ Noting the sensitivity of the profession to 
changes in its supply pipeline, another question may be 
‘what is a sustainable professional age profile?’ From the 
RANZCR Radiology Workforce Report [72], it was 
possible to model the Radiologist Age Profiles for 2000, 
when the 35-44 year age group was the largest, compared to 
45-54 years in 2010, when the average age was 50.7 
(median, 48 years) [72]. 
Figure 4 considers three faces: the 2010 profile (average 
age 50); the 2021 population allowing for the ageing of the 
Baby Boomer / X Generations (~ 1945-1959 / 1960-1974 
[74]) with the same numbers as 2010 and, thirdly, allowing 
for population growth to two thousand (2062) active 
radiologists based on the same profile.  In the first instance, 
the 2021 profiles show the radiologist ‘face’ continuing to 
grey – from 50 to 53. The impact of an ageing tail on 
opportunities at the start-of-career is significant, which may 
act unintentionally as a position / job blocker in later years. 
New positions reduce from about 90 in 2000; to 80 in 2010 
and 70 in 2021. Only by growing and changing the 
population profile  to two thousand in 2021 (through a 
targeted 
re-aggregation 
program), 
do 
start-of-career 
opportunities increase significantly (to ~125 places 
compared to between 75 today and 100 in 2021, based on 
ageing the current population), while the average age or face 
of the profession reduces to 45 [72].  
Figure 4.  Radiologist New Age / Face Profiles 2010 & 2021 
A complex system necessarily manages both growth and 
decline and ‘hunts’ for its equilibria positions. Nevertheless, 
it cannot always grow in order to sustain vacancies and 
opportunities at start-of-career. This may indicate that the 
current sociodetic model may be inherently unstable and 
potentially 
unsustainable 
(either 
interstitially 
or 
existentially) over the longer term.  
 
Figure 5.  Demand for Radiologists in Working Hours, 2050 
Based upon changing Australian demographics to 2050, a 
sociodetic study was undertaken and a synthetic ecology 
model of the profession developed [19],[71]. In this respect, 
we humbly propose a Synthetic Ecology to be:

‘A system (being or entity) that adapts, over time, by 
combining, through design and by natural processes, two 
or more dynamically interacting networks, including 
organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-
living 
(physical 
and 
technological) 
mechanical 
components of their environment’. 
Continuing with the sociodetic examination of the 
Radiologist workforce, a number of factors were considered, 
including feminization linked to increases in part-time 
working (more notably amongst female practitioners); 
reducing working ages and population growth and ageing 
[72]. On feminization, much research over the last decade 
[75]-[79] has examined this significant trend in medicine. In 
this regard, after Douglas [80], Ferguson [81] and Fondas 
[82], Feminization is considered to be:  
‘the spread of socio traits or qualities that are 
traditionally associated with females to things (e.g., 
technologies) or people (professions) not usually [/ 
previously] described that way; including the shift in 
gender roles towards a focus upon the feminine, as 
opposed to the pre-modern cultural focus on 
masculinity’ [71].  
Figure 6.  Supply of Radiologists in Working Hours, 2050 
Feminization of the medical workforce appears to be a 
global trend [83]. The 2010 RANZCR Radiology 
Workforce Report [72] shows that females were 17.1% of 
radiologists in 1998; 23.6% in 2010 and anticipated to be 
34% in 2020. Based on historical data, a function of the 
sociodetic model was designed to consider the future growth 
of female radiologists reaching a maximum of 65% female 
by 2050, based upon current European trends. This may 
have a significant impact on the system impacting, as it 
does, on the face and age of the population. On average, the 
working life of a female doctor may be 60% that of male 
doctors [84]. We hasten to add that we see feminization as a 
good  - and one that we need to understand if we are to 
better fit our people to the sociodetic systems they work 
within. There is also an impact upon part time working, in 
that – quite unexceptionally – 17.3% of Australian female 
radiologists may be working part-time; compared with 6.7% 
of male employees [72].  
The trend toward reduced working hours is also 
increasing among Australian radiologists. Studies show in 
2010, 34 per cent (c.f. 20 per cent in 2000) planned to 
decrease their working hours, while only 8.7 per cent (16 
per cent in 2000) planned to increase their hours [72]. The 
function in the sociodetic model expects the working hours 
in the future to be based on a dynamic full-time working 
profile (that assesses 37 hours per week as a minimum full-
time equivalent).  
Population growth and ageing is also likely to place 
potentially extraordinary demands on health services 
[71]. Changes to the workforce may also have the same 
demographic impact. The Australian Bureau of Statistics 
quoted by RANZCR [72] estimates that the ‘Australia’s 
civilian labor force aged 15 and over [will] grow to 10.8 
million in 2016, an increase of 1.5 million or 16% from the 
1998 labor force of 9.3 million’. Yet, the ‘average annual 
growth rate of 0.8% between 1998 and 2016’ is less than 
half that for 1979 to 1998. 
Figure 7.  Radiologists Working Hours Demand and Supply (2010-2050) 
Figure 7 shows the demand and supply of radiologists in 
a dynamic model over 40 years between 2010 and 2050. It 
appears that even if the radiology training programme grows 
at a higher rate (above the medical training growth rate) than 
its historical growth rate, the system would never be able to 
meet demand. It suggests that the 6% intake rate of first year 
registrars is insufficient and industry absorption will need to 
grow at a higher rate than the radiology specialist training 
programme. If the system is not able to increase the intake 
rate faster than the new radiologists supply rate (coming 
from the national training programmes and immigration) the 
profession may face two crises. First, supply and demand at 
current rates will never balance, Figure 7. Secondly, the 
number of trained, qualified radiologists who fail to enter the 
profession through the supply pipeline (un-employment in 
the occupation) may account for more than 3500 specialists 
over 40 years. Figure 7 indicates that the difference between

demand and supply in active working hours is not simply 
about increasing the numbers of radiologists. The effects of 
factors such as feminization and lifestyle changes become 
more evident. A side-effect (pressure on active radiologists 
to become more efficient (more for less)) of this imbalance 
may result in the reduction of imaging services quality – a 
potential ‘third crisis’. 
Technological advances in medical imaging have been 
one of the key factors in the expansion of radiological 
examinations and procedures since the 1970s. Recent 
research [71] has shown that rather than necessarily acting as 
an aid to knowledge transfer between GPs, Radiographers 
and Radiologists that, while the amount of information 
transfer (20 times as many digitized images compared to old 
‘films’) has increased, the all-important opportunities for 
collaboration between practitioners and patients (necessary 
for social knowledge transfer) has potentially reduced. 
Indeed, radiologists, nurses and radiographers meet to 
transfer notes, today, far less frequently – and the weak 
signals of ‘influence and abstracted social Knowledge’ are 
often lost / drowned out by strong-signals of information / 
data transfers. It was concluded that ‘new technologies can 
result in more efficient productivity (measured by 
information transfer) but that they can also carry risk if 
incorrectly applied’ [71].  
Research identified that Australia, like many other 
developed countries, e.g., the US and Germany, is facing a 
dénouement: traditional models of health care, specifically in 
radiology, are unsustainable based on growing demand for 
health care services [72]. As a result of unique, interstitial 
demands on the Australian health system, it is suggested that 
the existing radiology provisions model needs to consider the 
sociodetic development of patient care, patient safety and 
quality of service in addition to increasing the number of 
radiologists and radiographers and changing information 
communication technologies – the socio-info-techno and the 
info-techno-socio [71]. 
Conventional responses in Australia and many developed 
countries have been to increase the number of radiologists. 
Since 2007, medical radiation science programs expanded 
and offered more places at universities. Although students 
with high entrance scores enter the Australian undergraduate 
medical imaging programs, it appears that significant 
numbers retire / leave the profession soon after graduation. 
This leakage may be partly due to the lack of clinically-
oriented career development opportunities [85]. The other 
reason for leakage might be the oversupply of radiographers 
into the current employment model and its inability to use 
them 
appropriately, 
see 
Figure 
4. 
The 
successful 
implementation of this concept – authorizing diagnostic 
radiographers to take new practice roles beyond traditional 
ones – was noted. Caution was also suggested – at the unit 
and operational level this may offer potentially attractive 
opportunities for optimization and fractionation as a way of 
reducing costs by reducing skill contribution and, thereby, 
investment in the individual [86]. At the system level, this 
type of ‘Just-in-Time’ [87] approach can cause problems to 
the development of skill sets ‘over-time’ – particularly in a 
tightly coupled system such as exists between radiographers 
and radiologists [72]. 
The appropriate application of part time workers, if 
managed at the system level, could enable the necessary 
flows into and out of the profession, while maintaining on-
entry positions and the generation of expertise and experts 
later in the profession. Fragmented and fractionated [88] as 
the profession may have been managed to date, the projected 
increase in Part Time workers may negatively impact these 
positions through ‘job-blocking’ and reducing the all-
important flows into, out of and through the profession [72]. 
Another tightly coupled relationship is that between the 
private and the public sectors. By and large, the private 
sector is interested in recruiting with established proficiency 
[89], such as radiologists with ten or more years’ experience 
in the field. This can put pressure on employed numbers in 
the public sector – so creating a vicious circle of reducing 
numbers; increasing costs to the private sector and reducing 
levels of in-house expertise. 
To increase sociodetic / system level performance in 
various clinical departments, ecological identification and 
classification of ‘patients’ characteristics’ and available 
technologies may as well be necessary, specifically in 
‘redesigning scheduling schemes’ [90]-[92]. After Walter 
[93] and Huang and Marcak [94], it is suggested that patient 
classification in a hospital radiology department may help to 
improve patient access to care. This may then enable the 
optimizing of medical resource utilization of socio-info-
techno applications by better balancing the time of available  
doctors and specialists with patients [71].  
VI. 
A NEW METADETIC 
In this paper, we undertook an ecological identification (as 
opposed to system identification) of the Radiologist 
Profession. We did this in order to develop the synthetic 
ecology in which the highly socialized, technical setting of 
the radiology profession exists, today. To undertake the 
ecological modelling, we constructed a sociodetic model of 
the profession based upon the age of the profession and the 
factors affecting its previous, current and future supply and 
demand. We then used these ‘dynamically interacting 
networks’ to construct and test models of the profession as it 
may vary (depending on supply and demand inputs), over 
time. In undertaking this research, we suggested what a 
Synthetic Ecology might ‘be’. Given its early application of 
ICT 
imaging 
and 
data 
/ 
information 
management 
technologies, we saw the Radiologist profession as 
increasingly operating within the Cyber. This poses 
challenges if the profession is to: retain knowledge; learn, 
over time; respond to relatively rapid changes in supply and

demand; while preserving quality of health care provision. 
We identified that the current model was failing and that, 
unless change was addressed at the socio-info-techno system 
level, the profession would fail to meet projected population 
demands. We concluded that new inclusive standards were 
required in managing health care provision and relationships 
– specifically between specialists, practitioners, patients and 
new technologies – that will, increasingly occur, exclusively 
within the Cyber. 
In setting Cyber Standards, the issue appears two fold. 
First, to create inclusive standards through ‘the synergistic 
combination 
of 
civil 
mechanical 
systems 
and 
the 
management of interconnected knowledge, information (and 
data) infrastructures in the designing and composing of 
adaptive (resilient and sustainable) organizations’ [15], that 
readily encourage openness and transparencies and can be 
easily assayed. Secondly, is for these standards to encourage 
collaborative shared awareness, from which new controls 
and pricing opportunities and markets may emerge. Thus, 
inclusive standards for information / data “packet-switching” 
may create opportunities for “packet-marketing” and so for 
pricing and taxation. This returns to standards acting as 
social instruments that, through their very “being”, can 
synthesize the info-techno and socio to create opportunities 
both for collaborative exploration and exploitative control – 
or ambidexterity. It is posited that creating socially inclusive 
and acceptable standards for assaying the goodness of 
information and data enables this synthesis. This leads 
potentially into a third area to do with the synthesizing of 
Cyber Standards, introduced in Section III and by Figs. 1 and 
3 and to a concept for Synthetic Ecologies introduced in 
Section V. Finally, applying the sociodetic model developed 
for the Australian Radiologist profession, it is suggested that 
how social reference-standards are designed to be inclusive 
of the machine and the organization and are best “fitted” to 
their organizational (sociodetic) systems, may potentially be 
considered as the subject of “metadetics”.
