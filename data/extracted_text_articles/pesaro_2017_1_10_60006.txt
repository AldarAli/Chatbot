Abstract—Falling of the elderly has become an important issue
in today's aging society. As a result, active protecting devices
are being developed to protect the fallers’ body from severe
injuries. The key task of the protecting devices is the exact
detection of a falling event in Activities of Daily Living (ADL).
In this study, a methodology for detecting the fall event is
proposed using the accelerometer and the gyro-sensor of an
active protecting device. The results of fall detection using the
methodology proposed in this study were detected before
impact and are accurate more than 99.9 % for ADL.

I.
INTRODUCTION
More than 30% of the elderly over the age of 65 years
have experienced at least one fall per year [1]-[2], which
significantly
deteriorates
quality
of
life.
Furthermore,
approximately 15,800 adults over 65 years of age died from
injuries related to unintentional falls in the USA. Also,
about 1.8 million people over 65 years of age who had non-
fatal injuries visited the emergency departments and spent
$19 billion in the year 2000 in the USA [3]. Falls of the
elderly while doing different activities occur in the bath
room (26%), in the living room or bed room (26%), on the
stairs (10%), in the hall way (8%), and outside of the house
(20%) [4].
Based on movements, the elderly fall during
level walking (43 %), going in-and-out of a bathroom
(30%), sitting down and standing up from a seating position
(13%), and in ascending and descending stairs (15%) [4].
The postural imbalance in activities and movements is
caused
by
tripping
or
slipping
(27.4%);
surrounding
hazards, for example,
wet
or uneven
floor (21.8%);
misjudging, overbalancing, or over-reaching (17.8%); and
fainting, dizziness, illness, or legs giving way (17.7%) [5],
which are part of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL).
Many of these falls may be avoided if fall risk assessment
and prevention tools where available as an integral part of
ADL. However, the fall risk assessment is still not
completed at this moment. Currently, active protecting
devices for people falling are being developed to protect the
person's body from severe injuries as an alternative or for a
practical
purpose.
For
these
developments,
the
exact
detection of the fall is important for active control of the
protecting devices. Since the falls involve very complex
body movements, a precise detection of the fall events is a
very challenging task, particularly for industrial applications.
In this study, a methodology for detecting the fall events is
proposed using an accelerometer and a gyro-sensor for an
active protecting device from the fall injuries.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, the fall experimental method in ADL to obtain data and
the fall detection algorithm are explained. In Section 3, the
results of fall detection using proposed algorithm are
explained and a conclusion is given.
II.MATERIALS AND METHODS
A.
The fall experiments in ADL
21 male subjects participated in the experiment to obtain
fall data. The 3D accelerometer (LIS3DSH, ± 16 g, 0.73
mg/digit), gyro-sensor (L3G4200D, ± 2000 Deg/sec, 70
mdps/digit), and compass (HMC5883L, ± 8 Gauss, 5 milli-
gauss) were put on the sacrum of the subjects for the fall
experiments during level walking, sitting down, ascending
and descending stairs. In addition, the 3D kinematics of the
lower limbs and upper body during the locomotion or
movements were measured using a stereo photogrammetric
system, which consisted of seven infrared emitting Charge
Coupled Device (CCD) cameras (Motion Analysis System,
USA). The data from the sensors was transmitted in a
wireless manner using Radio Frequency (RF) (nRF2401+,
2.4GHz). Fig. 1 shows the experimental setups and an
example of the fall experiments. A slider was used to induce
a fall perturbation.
B.
The fall detection algorithm
In order to be applied to active protecting devices, fall
detection must be precisely performed just after the start of
the fall event, which is, when the falling person cannot return
to the balanced posture. For fall detection, the accelerations,
angular velocities, and angle at the sacrum, thus pelvis, were
used. Based on the resulting acceleration (see Figure 2) a fall
event could be classified as Fall 1- the period from the start
of the fall to the lowest peak, and Fall 2- the period from the
lowest peak to the impact. For perfect protection of the
falling persons' body, the detection should be accomplished
within Fall 1. At the same time, the detection must be
capable of discerning real fall from movements in ADL. In

this study, the experimental data collected from ADL, such
as the level, slope, and stair gait, as well as the sit down and
up motions, were statistically analyzed to obtain the fall
criteria. The fall criteria were determined based on the
superior-inferior and resultant accelerations, pelvic tilt and
obliquity angles, and resultant angular velocity. The signals
from the sensors were processed for the reduction of moving
artifacts and random noises using the Savitzky-Golay filter
[6]. Then, the onset of the fall using the criteria was detected
after applying the double threshold algorithm [7].

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
After analyzing the data collected from movements in
ADL, the summation of acceleration at the sacrum could
detect almost all movements of the fall, such as for level
walking, stairs, slope, sit up and down, except the falls
happening during running. The pelvic tilt, superior-inferior
acceleration, and resultant angular velocity could discern real
falls from all movements in ADL, except in sit up and down,
and lay down cases.
Fig. 3 shows the flow for detecting a fall. In the case of
level walking, the fall onset time after applying the
perturbation by the slider was faster than the lowest peak
point by as much as 0.105 sec. In addition, the fall onset time
by the bump trap was earlier than the lowest peak point by as
much as 0.329 sec. In general, the fall onsets by applying all
perturbations were detected before the lowest peak points for
all movements in ADL situations. Table 1 shows threshold
ranges and detecting capabilities of the fall criteria. STS
means motions in the sit down and up. The detections were
accurate more than 99.9 % for 5 categories in ADL, as
indicated in Table 1, based on the field experiments, which
were performed for the elderly in a retirement home. Further
research is required for the detecting capabilities in case of
non-ADL situations.
