Abstract—The MAC (Medium Access Control) protocol has an 
important influence on network performance, especially in 
home health monitoring which constrains delivery of time-
sensitive message and power consumption. In this paper, a 
multi-hop mesh sensor network is proposed based on a novel 
MAC protocol ADCF (Adaptive and Distributed Collision-
Free). ADCF uses CFBS (Collision-Free Beacon Slot) and 
CFDS (Collision-Free Data Slot) mechanisms to guarantee QoS 
(Quality of Service) while reducing energy consumption in a 
mesh 
topology. 
The 
simulation 
results 
show 
better 
performances of ADCF compared with IEEE 802.15.4 MAC 
protocol in terms of energy and guaranteed medium access 
with the flexibility of mesh topology. 
Keywords-IEEE 802.15.4; mesh topology; QoS; energy 
saving, health monitoring application 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Our application scenario is focused on the monitoring of 
the elderly at home via a WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). 
ADCF sensor nodes are put on the ceiling, wall, furniture 
and the body of the person. For example, when the 
accelerometer detects a fall of the person, an alarm should be 
sent with some guaranties in terms of delay. In addition, the 
network should be self-organizing and could tolerate a link 
failure or a link establishment. Therefore, all ADCF nodes 
are expected to have the same role (both sensor and router) 
in a mesh topology. 
Several projects have been investigated on the habitat 
monitoring [1-3]. There are generally two main constraints 
for this WSN: time-sensitive delivery of some urgent 
messages and power consumption. Many technologies exist 
at different layers to improve these two constraints [4]. Our 
work focuses on MAC layer. As the largest energy 
consumption of the nodes is due to the time spent in the idle 
state [5], so time slot allocation is an important task. The 
avoidance of collisions between 2-hop neighbors is another 
goal because there is scarcely interference at distance of 
more than 2 hops [6].  
This paper aims to present a novel MAC protocol based 
on IEEE 802.15.4 to build a scalable and robust WSN for 
home health monitoring. The paper is organized as follows: 
section 2 investigates the current MAC protocol for this 
application. The proposed ADCF MAC is described 
gradually in section 3. Section 4 provides simulation results 
while the last section concludes the paper. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
MAC protocols for WSN could be classified into two 
categories. The first category is based on conventional 
wireless protocols, especially IEEE 802.11(a/b/g/n/ac). 
These protocols typically provide a general mechanism that 
works reasonably well for a large set of traffic load. 
Therefore, these protocols don’t meet our goals and will not 
be discussed in this paper. IEEE 802.11ah is an on-going 
work about energy efficient MAC for low traffic sensor 
network. However, some issues such as frame header 
compression are still open and there are now no available 
products for our future work. The second category based on 
IEEE 802.15.4 is being considered as a promising way for 
low-cost low-power WSN. In part A, IEEE 802.15.4 
standard is briefly presented. Recent works based on this 
standard have been fully studied in part B. 
A. IEEE 802.15.4 Standard 
IEEE 802.15.4 [7] protocol supports beacon and non-
beacon mode. More precisely, in beacon mode, it is possible 
to achieve variable duty cycles (from 100% down to 
0.006%), which is particularly interesting for our application 
where energy constraint and network lifetime are main 
concerns. In addition, beacon mode has an attractive feature 
for time-sensitive applications as QoS properties are 
available with GTS (Guaranteed Time Slot) mechanism. On 
the other side, non-beacon mode, which has the advantage of 
lower complexity and more scalability as compared with 
beacon mode, does not provide any of those features.  
Therefore, we focus on beacon mode which seems to be a 
promising way. However, several issues in the standard are 
still open. One of those issues is how to build a synchronized 
multi-hop mesh network for power efficient, scalable and 
robust networking. In fact, while the current standard 
supports multi-hop networking using peer-to-peer topology, 
it restricts its use to non-beacon mode. This contradiction 
makes urgent requirement of novel MAC protocols.

B. MAC Protocols Based on IEEE 802.15.4 
ZigBee specifications [8] clear the ambiguities of IEEE 
802.15.4 in a cluster-tree topology. The centralized PAN 
(Personal Area Network) coordinator assigns a beacon 
transmission offset for each node when it wants to associate 
the PAN. Therefore, the communication range and the 
requirements of time-sensitive are both limited.  
Anis Koubâa [9-10] continues the work in the domain of 
cluster-tree topology. However, the requirement of different 
BI (Beacon Interval) and SD (Superframe Duration) for each 
node is calculated in advance. These weaken the flexibility 
and robustness as well as restrict the scalability of network.  
Another example has been proposed in OCARI project 
[11-12]. A PAN coordinator which receives all the 
association requests decides beacon slot for each node. The 
main drawback of this solution is the lack of flexibility, 
especially regarding the changing topology and the 
inconstancy of wireless medium. 
P. S. Muthukumaran presented MeshMAC protocol [13]. 
This protocol enables mesh networking over beacon mode 
through a distributed SDS (Superframe Duration Scheduling) 
strategy in which each node calculates its schedule to 
transmit beacons based only on locally available information. 
The limitations of MeshMAC are: it imposes very low duty 
cycles; the beacon transmission offset is difficult to choose 
for the changing topology.  
B. Carballido Villaverde proposed DBOP MAC protocol 
[14]. It creates a BOP (Beacon Only Period) where beacons 
are transmitted at different time slots among neighbors and 
neighbors’ neighbors. However, DBOP introduces an 
overhead into the network. Another drawback is the 
inefficient management of BOP length. In addition, how to 
offer QoS for different application traffic is not discussed.

ADCF MAC PROTOCOL 
The objective of ADCF is to build a beacon-enabled 
WSN over an IEEE 802.15.4 PHY which supports mesh 
topology and enables better energy efficiency. While a 
previous paper [15] only focused on beacon scheduling and 
network construction, in this paper we detail the mechanism 
of Collision-Free Data Slot (CFDS) in the mesh topology. 
Additionally, corresponding simulation results and the 
operation of ADCF are first presented. 
Before showing the characteristics of ADCF, some 
assumptions should be highlighted: all the considered nodes 
have the capacity to be both sensor and router; nodes 
addresses have been preliminary set. 
   
A. Overview of ADCF 
As shown in Fig. 1, the superframe of ADCF is 
organized in three parts: BOP, active period and inactive 
period. BOP is organized by CFBS (Collision Free Beacon 
Slot). Each node has a 2-hop collision-free beacon slot in 
BOP. Similarly, ADCF nodes can access the medium by 
slotted CSMA or guaranteed mechanism CFDS (Collision 
Free Data Slot) in the active period. Inactive period is 
optional for energy saving.

B. Operation of ADCF 
ADCF includes several slight protocols: BEP (Beacon 
Exchange Protocol), ISP (Initiator Selection Protocol), 
BSAP (Beacon Slot Allocation Protocol), DSAP (Data Slot 
Allocation Protocol) and SRP (Smart Repair Protocol). In 
addition, SPA (Simple Priority Algorithm) is used repeatedly 
in ISP and BSAP.

Each ADCF node has a NT (Neighbor Table) and 
executes the following as shown in Fig. 2. SRP allows

ADCF nodes to switch between initialization stage and 
working stage depending on the changing topology of 
network. The beginning and core of ADCF is BEP which 
sets up NT and updates NT in both stages. BEP runs 
periodically according to the preset parameters such as BO. 
With the information of NT, ISP is executed. Then BSAP is 
triggered and so the node could synchronize with the 
initiator. DSAP will work when there are application 
requests from the higher layer. 
 
BEP: the main concern for BEP is collection of 
interesting information in a 2-hop neighborhood. 
Each new node will firstly listen to the channel for a 
fixed period when it is powered-up. Depending on 
the received beacons during listen, the new node will 
send its own beacon by different mechanisms. Each 
node broadcasts its beacon within 1-hop and records 
direct neighbors’ in its NT. Therefore, all the 2-hop 
neighbors’ information is obtained by this new node. 
The interesting information in a beacon includes NA 
(Neighbor Address), NE (Neighbor Energy) and ND 
(Neighbor Density). Here, ND is defined as the 
number of neighbors within 2-hop (including itself). 
The overhead incurred by BEP is studied and 
simulated in [15]. 
 
SPA: SPA is implemented by comparing 3 
parameters of the nodes. The comparison order is 
ND, NE and NA. At first, the node with maximum 
ND is selected. If the nodes have the same ND, SPA 
chooses the one with maximum NE. Finally, the 
node with minimum address has the highest priority 
if two other parameters are the same.  
 
ISP: the objective of this protocol is to select an 
initiator which has two functions: it specifies the 
beginning of BOP and measures the length of BOP 
in order to realize the network synchronization. This 
length is defined as the initiator ND. Each node 
selects an initiator candidate locally by SPA from its 
NT. If one initiator candidate is different from the 
neighbors’, SPA is repeatedly used to decide a 
unique initiator. This initiator’s information will be 
added to NT and be sent in the next beacon. 
Therefore, there may be several initiator candidates 
in the initialization stage but a unique initiator in the 
working stage. 
 
BSAP: this protocol makes each node choose a 
CFBS in BOP. The nodes execute SPA locally and 
the one has higher priority first to choose its beacon 
slot. It takes a slot which is not used by its 2-hop 
neighbors and stores the slot number in its NT. At 
last, the node which has its chosen slot will be 
deleted from SPA list and the other nodes in this list 
continue BSAP.  
 
DSAP: in the original IEEE 802.15.4, GTSs are 
requested via a GTS request command sent in Best-
effort mode using CSMA/CA. In ADCF, each node 
can request CFDS using its beacon to all its 
neighbors without the need to send a dedicated 
frame. A bi-direction communication is possible. 
When a node receives neighbor’s beacon and finds 
its address as CFDS destination, it checks it NT, 
allocates the first available data slot to the requesting 
node and announces this allocation in the next 
beacon. When the requesting node receives this 
beacon containing the slot number, it may use it to 
send the application traffic in the CFDS. CFDS 
request and CFDS indication subfields take only 2 
bytes in the beacons. 
 
SRP: this protocol reduces the impact of changing 
topology as much as possible. For example, if link 
failure is detected, neighbors will simply delete this 
failure node from their NT. If the initiator fails, 
others re-select an initiator but keep their BOP with 
the original beacon slots. Therefore, the network will 
still work without disruption. As there are free slots 
in BOP, a new node may choose its beacon slot 
directly after a period of listening. If BOP length is 
not enough, a new node may send its beacon by 
CSMA until a new initiator is designed with updated 
ND.  
In conclusion, seldom MAC protocols for low-cost low-
power network are in a mesh topology which has the 
advantages of scalability and robustness. ADCF aims to 
enable the efficient mechanisms and eliminate the difficulties, 
such as beacon collision, QoS and synchronization in a 
changing multi-hop mesh-link network. 
IV. 
SIMULATION STUDY 
To study the scope of our contribution, we use OPNET to 
establish a simulation model which implements the entire 
proposal. Two experiment examples are presented in this 
paper. The first one is the comparison of ADCF with IEEE 
802.15.4. The second experiment is the ADCF performance 
with large scale and high neighbor density. The basic 
parameters are shown in the Table 1. We are now 
implementing ADCF on 13192-SARD board which has a 
total of 4Kb RAM for application data, variables, buffers etc. 
Therefore, the buffer for CSMA and CFDS could not be 
more than 2Kb in reality. This parameter configuration is 
useful for comparing the simulation results with prototype.

A. Comparison of ADCF with IEEE 802.15.4 
To our knowledge, there are two versions of IEEE 
802.15.4 in OPNET. The version developed by Anis Koubâa 
[9-10] includes the GTS implementation and a fixed beacon

scheduling mechanism. It is used in this experiment. 14 
nodes join the network gradually in this experiment. A static 
routing mechanism is added above ADCF in order to 
simulate real traffics over the network. IEEE 802.15.4 
applies ZigBee routing.

Figure 3.  Energy consumption comparison. 
In the energy consumption comparison, only beacons are 
delivered in order to compare the protocol cost.  In addition, 
a more practical energy model [16] is used in our experiment. 
As shown in Fig. 3, ADCF consumes less energy, about 37%, 
than IEEE 802.15.4 as time goes by. This is because IEEE 
802.15.4 nodes spend more time for idle listening.

Figure 4.  Delay comparison. 
As shown in Fig. 4, there are 7 sources with 1-hop traffic 
or 3 sources with multi-hop traffic. When Packet Interarrival 
Time decreases from 1.0 to 0.1, the traffic load will increase. 
Therefore, End to End Delay becomes larger. When Packet 
Interarrival Time is about 0.4 s, there are radical changes 
caused by buffer overflow.  
As the configured BO and SO, a superframe cycle is 
about 2 s. For 1-hop traffic, the difference between ADCF 
and IEEE 802.15.4 is tiny. This End to End Delay, about 1 s, 
includes the time from packet generation to the scheduled 
data slot. It also can be seen that ADCF saves about 25% 
End to End Delay for multi-hop traffic. Some multi-hop 
traffic may be transmitted in one superframe as the same 
active period in a mesh topology. IEEE 802.15.4 works in a 
cluster-tree topology which may take several superframes 
from the source to the final destination. The average hop 
count is 3, so this End to End Delay is about 2.7 s for ADCF 
and 3.5 s for IEEE 802.15.4.  
The Packet Success Ratios always keep 100% for both 
protocols when the CFDS buffers are available. 
B. ADCF Performance in Large Scale and High Density 
In this experiment, we focus on Packet Success Ratio of 
ADCF in large scale and high density in order to study the 
protocol performance in a variety of scenarios.  
Firstly 14, 30 and 50 nodes are configured in the 
network. Then the 50 nodes with different neighbor density 
are simulated. For all the scenarios, there are 7 sources with 
QoS traffic and 7 sources with best-effort traffic at the same 
time. All traffics are generated for a 1-hop destination.  
 
Figure 5.  Packet success ratio for different scale. 
As shown in Fig. 5, it can be seen that Packet Success 
Ratios always keep 100% for QoS traffic when the CFDS 
buffers are available. Packet Success Ratios become higher 
with the larger network scale for Best-Effort traffic. This is 
because of the risks of collisions are lower. When Packet 
Interarrival Time is 0.1, this traffic load is relatively light for 
the network of 30 and 50 nodes. However, the contention for 
Best-Effort traffic is intense in the network of 14 nodes.  
Neighbor densities are average values obtained by 
simulations. As shown in Fig. 6, network density also has no 
much influence on QoS traffic. While for Best-Effort traffic, 
Packet Success Ratio is higher with the lower density as 
there is less collisions. When neighbor density is 8.76, the 
risk of collision is low. Therefore, the difference between 
8.76 and 5.13 is tiny. When neighbor density is 15.24, there 
are a lot of nodes in the communication range of neighbors. 
Thus its Packet Success Ratio is the lowest of these 3 
scenarios.

CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES 
This paper presents an original MAC protocol named as 
ADCF, which is based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard to build a 
mesh WSN. The 2-hop CFBS and CFDS mechanisms were 
described and implemented by a set of protocols which are 
explained. The simulation results show that ADCF consumes 
less energy (about 37%) while End to End Delay and Packet 
Success Ratio perform no much worse than IEEE 802.15.4. 
The simulation results also confirm that ADCF works well in 
the condition of large scale and high density. Therefore, 
ADCF satisfies the application request of delivering QoS 
message with low energy consumption. In addition, when a 
new node joins the network or a key node fails in the process 
of surveillance, the own functioning of other nodes is quite 
important for home health monitoring. Fortunately, the mesh 
topology of ADCF strengthens network flexibility to the 
changing link states. A perspective is the re-exploitation of 
the information gathered by ADCF in order to make them 
available for upper layers, such as routing layer, to reduce 
upper protocol overhead. 
Now, the current work is focused on ADCF hardware 
implementation. The next step is its deployment in real 
conditions in “Smart Home” of Blagnac University 
Technological Institute.
