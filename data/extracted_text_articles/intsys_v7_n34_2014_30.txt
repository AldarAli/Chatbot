Abstract—One of the main reasons of the hesitant expansion
of ﬁber optic communication networks is the large ﬁnancial
expense for the excavation work. While the cost for (passive)
hardware components and the ﬁber optics cable itself have fallen
during the last decade, the cable layout work is still the cost
driver of network construction projects. The most promising
approach for a valid cost estimation is to use state-of-the-art
network simulation and optimization techniques in the ﬁeld of
operations research. This study examines an automated process of
generating a network graph that closes the missing link between
the real-world and mathematical optimization of a communica-
tion network. The constructed graph is based on heterogeneous
spatial data and weighted with real-world construction costs.
It is then used to solve the minimum Steiner tree problem as
typical optimization problem for the modeling and optimization
of communication networks. While the applied mathematical
model is studied in detail, the quality of the result as well as the
runtime performance of the optimization algorithm is heavily
dependent on the complexity and validity of the input graph.
Based on a general format, the normalized geobasisdata, an initial
graph, is constructed. This graph is then used as input into our
rule-based system to select and weight the edges to be in the
ﬁnal graph. The optimization results of the experiments on real-
world data, prove the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the proposed
approach.
Keywords—geographic information; spatial data; communica-
tion network optimization; normalized geobasisdata.
I. INTRODUCTION
This study is an extension of [1] and examines the genera-
tion of network graphs, weighted with real-world construction
costs to allow a valid optimization of communication net-
works. A typical network optimization problem is to connect
a given number of customers by a wired network at a minimal
expense. This state-of-the-art optimization problem is known
as the Steiner tree problem (STP) that searches a cost min-
imal tree connecting terminals in a weighted network graph
described in [2] and [3].
The generation of graphs, representing road networks, is
subject of different approaches (e.g., the extraction of road
networks from satellite images as described in [4] or the
extraction of road intersections from raster maps described
in [5]). The generation of real-world graphs, allowing the
optimization of communication networks, is understudied.
To enable the mathematical simulation and optimization of
a wired telecommunication network, the spatial data has to be
converted into a weighted network graph, which is the missing
link between the real world and the mathematical modeling.
This graph is consisting of vertices (i.e., points-of-interest)
and pair wise joining edges (representing network construction
costs) between them. It is generated using spatial polygon data
describing the land use on the one hand, and spatial line- and
point-objects, describing existing infrastructure on the other
hand. Based on this spatial data originating from a number of
hybrid sources, a rule-based expert system is used to construct
a network graph as vital input in subsequent mathematical
models.
We focus on generating a weighted graph that can be
used in different optimization models within the scope of
wired telecommunication network construction. An instance
of such a model using weighted graphs is the simulation and
optimization engine of ﬁber optic communication networks
described in [6]. Here, the land use polygons are divided into
a grid, called cost raster. Each cell in this grid is representing
the averaged underground construction costs determined by
network constructors. While using a cost raster is a feasi-
ble way to generate a network graph representing network
construction costs, a more sophisticated approach is needed
to generate graphs by taking into consideration all kinds of
real world information and being able to be computed in a
reasonable time.
The present paper is divided into a preliminaries section,
the section dedicated to the deﬁnition and origin of normalized
geobasisdata, details and quality of our approach followed by
experimental results and the conclusion.
II. PRELIMINARIES
The subsequent simulation and optimization algorithms
require undirected graphs as the fundamental data structure.
The graph G = (V, E, d) consists of n = |V | vertices and
m = |E| edges. The distance of an edge eij ∈ E connecting
the two vertices i ∈ V and j ∈ V is given as a cost function
dij : E → R, where R is the set of all real numbers. When
calculating the shortest path or the minimum Steiner Tree as

typical routing problems, the distance d can be the Euclidean
distance. The more sophisticated algorithms use travel time
as the distance between two vertices. In case of scenarios
considering the cable layout of wired networks, the distances
have to be construction costs, such as underground work or
the costs for building cable poles.
The goal of optimizing the cable layout of a communication
network is to ﬁnd a connected sub graph S = (Vs, Es) in G,
connecting the terminals (i.e., access objects) T ⊆ V such that
the sum of edge weights P
e∈Es de is minimal. Verticals from
the set V \ T are called Steiner nodes.
The two-dimensional geographic data originate from hybrid
sources, thus these data need to be prepared to serve as the
basis for the construction of network graphs. There are three
main sources for the geographical data:
(a)
The geographic information system (GIS).
(b)
The network information system (NIS).
(c)
The digital cadastral map (DKM).
Each of the above listed items is needed for the construction
of a consistent data source.
A. GIS
In our case, the geographic information system includes
typical information used in marketing scenarios and strategic
decisions. It is important to know where the potential cus-
tomers are located. The data showing the population density or
the number of households collected in a population census are
incorporated in the GIS as well. The GIS contains statistical
data aggregated from public sources together with information
gathered by the prosecuting company itself. The most impor-
tant information for a network construction company is the
information about the location of potential, private or public
customers as well as the expected beneﬁt.
The network operator knows the exact location and the
return on investment of the current customers, but not for po-
tential customers. The marketing division uses market surveys
and other statistical data to predict the location of potential
customers and the likely yearly sales.
B. NIS
The network information system contains the information
regarding all hardware components of the communication
network as well as all logical links between these components.
Typically, the NIS contains the most important business secrets
of a network operating company. The following gives a list of
the typical content of a NIS:
• Current and former customers.
• Network components.
• Physical cabling plan.
• Logical interconnection plan.
C. DKM
The Digital Cadastral Map is part of the ofﬁcial boundaries
cadastre, which is the binding evidence of all parcel’s bound-
aries. The DKM contains all public and private property and is
typically available nationwide. Furthermore, it documents the
type of land use of each parcel as well as buildings. Similar
information is held in layers and together they form the DKM
(a comprehensive interface description can be found in [7]):
• Boundaries.
• Parcel numbers.
• Types of land use (building land, forest, running water,
standing water, etc.).
• Buildings.
• Control and Boundary points.
Formerly available only as an analog hard copy, the DKM
was not only digitized but also enhanced using other ofﬁcial
sources like Orthophotos and partition plans. Due to this
reason, the quality of the digital map exceeds the quality of
the analog version but it may include historical failures as
well. There is a list of papers describing the aspects of spatial
data quality [8], [9], [10], [11] as well as an ISO Standard
regarding the quality of spatial data [12].
While the spatial accuracy is acceptable in most of mathe-
matical simulation and optimization scenarios, the topological
quality of the input data has to be ensured. There is some
work proposed to identify spatial inconsistencies and incorrect
object classiﬁcations using either manually deﬁned spatial
integrity constraints [13], [14], [15] or an automatic and
incremental approach using decision trees proposed in [16]
and improved in [17].
The DKM is used as one of the basic input into our approach
and has to be normalized together with the other spatial input
data.
III. NORMALIZED GEOBASISDATA
The subsequent graph generation is designed as a com-
pletely automated process without the need of any user interac-
tion. Due to this fact, the input data are stored in a predeﬁned
digital map format and the spatial objects must meet a set of
conditions. In our approach, we have decided to use the ESRI
Shapeﬁle [18] as the digital map format. This open format
is widely used and supported and stores spatial geometry and
attributes as elements representing points, lines, and polygons.
The Normalized Geobasisdata (NGB) format [19] is an add-
on to the ESRI Shapeﬁle specifying the minimum qualitative
and logical requirements of the spatial objects. It was devel-
oped in order to allow the automated generation of weighted
network graphs based on any two-dimensional spatial data that
represent surface data (i.e., land uses) in form of polygons at
least. If the hybrid spatial data fulﬁll the speciﬁed NGB format,
they qualify as input into the graph generation process.
The NGB format was originally developed for a simulation
model dealing with the layout planning of a ﬁber-optics
communication network in the year 2009. Since then it has

been continuously adapted to the speciﬁc requirements of
individual projects.
The majority of mathematical simulation and optimization
models dealing with cable infrastructure planning or routing in
general rely on spatial data as the main input source to stay real
world compatible. Table I represents the spatial information to
be covered in the NGB format.

The polygon describing the project area (a) as well as each
polygon describing the land use (b) must show the follow-
ing characteristics (in addition to some mandatory attributes
described below):
• Valid and closed polygon.
• No crossing edges.
• Degree-two vertices only.
• No overlapping or equality with other polygons (see
Figure 1).
Fig. 1.
All existing relations between pairwise polygons. EQ (equal) and
PO (partly overlapping) relations are not allowed in NGB; Based on Region
Connection Calculus (RCC-8) [20].
A polyline referred to as usable infrastructure (c) can be
associated with own infrastructure (e.g., the copper cabling in
the access domain) or third-party infrastructure (e.g., leased
lines). The spatial object must be a valid polyline. In case
of any attributive restriction in the accessibility, there must
be at least two infrastructure points assigned; hence the
infrastructure can only be accessed via one of the two points
(an open line infrastructure can be accessed at the masts only).
The infrastructure points (d) are attributive assigned to
exactly one polyline of the usable infrastructure and represent
any type of infrastructure objects that can be localized on
exactly one position (e.g., shafts to access pipes, masts,
hardware like splitters or routers, etc.).
The last object class is the class of access points (e).
These are points representing the terminals in a following
optimization. We distinguish between existing access points
that are currently supplied by one or a group of connected
usable infrastructure polylines, and potential access points that
are not yet connected.
The presented approach of the graph generation makes
use of geometric algorithms and algorithms from operations
research. Thus, ambiguous relations or even gaps between
spatial objects cannot be allowed. This distinguishes between
common geodatabase systems and spatial data in the NGB
format, because there are no tolerances allowed.
Two points meant to be on the same position have to
share the same coordinates. Furthermore, there are general
speciﬁcations, which cover the notation, the coordinate system,
the locale, default attribute values, and a list of common
abbreviations.
The next section describes our graph generation approach,
that is based on spatial input data in NGB format.
IV. GRAPH GENERATION
The process that we follow to generate a weighted network
graph consists of three consecutive stages (see Figure 4 for
the individual results):
• NGB preprocessing and enhancement.
• Generation of the candidate graph.
• Running the rule-based system.
In the following section, further details to the stages will be
given.
A. NGB preprocessing and enhancement
The preprocessing and enhancement of the input data are
fully automated processes. As long as the input data fulﬁll the
requirements in the NGB format, the generation of a weighted
network graph will succeed. Moreover, the quality and usabil-
ity of the generated graph are crucial in terms of topological
errors within the spatial data. Furthermore, the succeeding
process of assigning the correct weights to all edges in the
graph is sensitive to the correct spatial classiﬁcation.
To ensure a valid real-world graph, the input data are vali-
dated running the decision tree approaches described in [16]
and [17]. Based on error free spatial data covering provincial,
rural, suburban, and urban areas, a representative decision tree
was constructed. Both approaches use this decision tree to val-
idate the input data. The process will output warnings in case

of topological errors and reclassify spatial objects according
to the decision tree. An example of an automatically identiﬁed
error can be seen in Figure 2. The missing information about
the thoroughfare can lead to a poor solution or even to an
insoluble routing problem in consequence of the isolated street.
The validation is followed by the enhancement of the input
data. Since underground work in crossroads areas and the sub-
sequent obstruction in trafﬁc should be avoided, the roadways
are supplemented by polygons representing crossroads areas.
Each crossing of at least two center lines of street polygons is
identiﬁed and replaced by a polygon classiﬁed as crossroad
area. The process runs automatically and produces results
(see Figure 3), eminently suitable in the generation of valid
candidate graphs.
B. Generation of the candidate graph
The goal of any graph-based mathematical optimization is
to connect the access points to a given or new access network.
As a result of the graph generation, each spatial object will
be connected with other objects in the candidate graph. In the
approach we follow three consecutive steps:
• Construction of the initial candidate graph.
• Classiﬁcation of the graph edges.
• Assign real-world construction and activation costs.
Algorithm 1 describes the construction of the initial candi-
date graph that is used as an input into the rule-based system.
Starting with the polygons representing the land use objects,
the outer border and hole edges are collected and added to the
graph. It is extended by the edges representing existing infras-
tructure considering restrictions in the accessibility. Additional
projections originating from access points as well as artiﬁcial
polygon crossings ensure a connected graph. The edges are
classiﬁed with the corresponding land use and infrastructure
running Algorithm 2.
Subsequently the classiﬁed edges are weighted with real-
world construction and activation costs running Algorithm

use classiﬁcations and averaged activation costs of existing

communication infrastructure are shown in Tables II and
III, respectively. The values are representing typical costs of
underground work including the surface reconstruction, with
the tendency to avoid airport and buildings as well as the
crossing of railways, rivers, and lakes. Since the network
constructing companies have their own empirical values, the
construction and activation costs can be speciﬁed individually.
The rule-based system is applied to the generated and
weighted candidate graph to signiﬁcantly reduce the dimension
(i.e., number of vertices and edges).
C. Running the rule-based system
The rule-based system is based on the expert knowledge of
network constructors. It is applied to the generated candidate
graph to test for qualiﬁed edges. Each of the following
questions will be answered with yes or no and determine the
appearance of the edge in the ﬁnal graph (edge is rejected, if
all answered with no):

While for the ﬁrst three questions the answer is quite easy
to ﬁnd, the last question requires running Algorithm 4 to
be answered. The idea is to keep edges that allow the cost-
efﬁcient connection of spatial point objects regardless of the
direction. Crossing edges will be discarded, if following the
border is cheaper.
After identifying all edges that are members in the ﬁnal
graph, it can be used in the mathematical optimization of a

generated graph. The main factors determining the quality of
the generated network graph are:

757
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 7 no 3 & 4, year 2014, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
2014, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
(a)
The usability.
(b)
The real-world correlation.
(c)
The correct cost assignment.
The (a) usability is primarily determined by the subsequent
optimization algorithm. The dimension of the weighted graph
(i.e., the number of vertices and edges) must be small enough
to allow the application of heuristics or optimal algorithms
but at the same time it also must be large enough to be non-
restrictive. So a crossing of a river is a potentially unwanted
scenario (due to the expense) but has to be made possible to
reach isolated areas.
The (b) real-world correlation of the generated graph is
equal to the correlation of the spatial data, if:
• all boundaries of parcels and buildings,
• all infrastructure, and
• all customers are contained and accessible.
To ensure the (c) correct weighting of the edges, the system
is supplied with average network construction costs, broken
down to activation/usage costs for infrastructure and exca-
vation costs for each available land use. For the latter the
granularity of excavation costs can be chosen freely, depending
on the spatial information available. Due to the costs for
a surface reconstruction or applying for ofﬁcial permits the
crossing of a bitumenized street can be more expensive than
to dig up a horizontal shaft along the boundary.
In the next section, we will describe the outcome of exper-
iments we ran using real-world spatial data.
VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A series of experiments was run to evaluate the perfor-
mance of the described graph generating approach as well
as determining the quality of the weighted network graph.
The algorithms were implemented using the object-oriented
programming language C# (respectively the functional pro-
gramming language F# implementing the rule-based system)
from the .NET Framework version 4.5.1. All experiments were
executed on a standard personal computer with Intel Core i5-
2400 CPU, 8GB RAM, and 64-bit architecture.
A. Performance
To analyze the performance of the graph generation ap-
proach, we selected spatial data from four different classiﬁ-
cation areas:
• Urban;
• Suburban;
• Rural, and
• Provincial.
Table IV provides the classiﬁcation of the exemplary se-
lected input data together with the dimensions.
The dimension and runtime of the generated and weighted
network graphs can be seen in Table V.
As expected, the runtime of the approach corresponds to the
number of spatial objects enclosed in the area. For the simple
reason that the graph needs to be generated only once, the
duration is reasonable and acceptable.

B. Quality
The spatial input data selected for the quality experiments
originates from the Austrian Digital Cadastral Map and covers
a suburban area of about 6km2. It represents sparsely as well
as densely populated areas to provide the most signiﬁcant
quality evaluation. To allow a self-sufﬁcient comparison of
the generated graphs, there is no existing infrastructure given.
So the cabled communication network has to be build from
scratch. The 42 points objects to be connected (i.e., Access
points) are randomly selected centroids of buildings. Figure 6
shows the preprocessed and enhanced NGB of the area.
The generated graphs used in the experiments have been
veriﬁed to contain all polygon boundaries (no ﬁltering or
aggregation of edges) and that there are no isolated parts. The
weighting of the edges was done using average excavation
costs per meter with respect to the underlying land use.
A fully connected graph (fully mesh all vertices) represents
the best possible real-world correlation (because nearly every
path is present) but the least quality with respect to the
applicability. Considering only the polygon boundary, the
number of vertices is about 13, 300 in our example. A fully
connected graph would have 886 edges and therefore is not
applicable.
We choose the best approximation as benchmark reference:
a graph containing all polygon boundaries enhanced by edges
building a fully connected subgraph of all access objects.
Next to this we have generated three more graphs using our
proposed approach.
The following list of network graphs were generated to
allow an estimation of the quality:
• Benchmark ...Polygon boundaries and fully connected
access objects - Figure 7(a).
• Fix150 ...Generated graph with additional street cross-
ings each 150m - Figure 7(b).
• Fix5 ...Generated graph with additional street crossings
each 5m - Figure 7(c).
• Adaptive ...Generated graph with adaptive crossings.
The distance between two crossings is dependent on
the construction costs of the underlying land use parcel.

Table VI is listing the dimension of the graphs. In case
of the graph Adaptive, the number of edges and vertices is
varying with the applied cost-set in the weighting process.

We used the deﬁned graphs to approximate the minimal
Steiner tree using the famous minimum spanning tree heuris-
tics described in [21]. It has a worst case time complexity of
O(|T||V |2) and guarantees a optimization result of no more
than 2(1 − 1
l ) times the result of the optimal Steiner tree (l
represents the number of leaves in the optimal tree).
The following three different artiﬁcial scenarios (cost-
triggered due to different cost-sets used in the weighting) have
been applied:
(a)
Each type of land use has its own cost value per
meter. Edges on the boundary of a parcel and edges
crossing a parcel show equal costs per meter.
(b)
Avoid crossings of parcels. The costs per meter
doubles for crossing edges.
(c)
Force minimal usage of edges representing street
crossings and avoid crossings of other land use
parcels. The costs per meter doubles for crossing
edges. The costs for edges crossing the street are
multiplied by ten.
Table VII shows the optimized construction costs of a wired
telecommunication network build from scratch. The costs of
all edges in the Steiner tree are summarized in the third
column. The last column is giving the deviation from the
generated benchmark graph that is set as reference. In case
of scenario (c) the deviation of graph Fix5 and Adaptive is
even negative. Hence, both the graphs are better suited for
the optimization of a wired communication network than the
complex benchmark graph.
Figure 8 is visualizing the optimized trees.
As shown in the experimental results, the proposed graph
generation approach can be applied to generate weighted
network graphs that are usable in mathematical optimization
of network construction costs. The construction and activation
costs are subject to change and should be updated prior to
the edge weighting, to ensure a correct overall cost assign-
ment. The real-world correlation is validated comparing the
optimization results with a nearly fully connected graph.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, an approach for the generation and weighting
of a network graph has been proposed. Introducing a nor-

malization format called NGB to support a fully automated
process of generating graphs using a wide range of hybrid
spatial data as the input. The process of generating a candidate
graph followed by the classiﬁcation and weighting of the edges
produces a valid and computable real-world graph.
The experiments show that the approach is effective and
efﬁcient and that the weighted graph can be used as basic
input into mathematical optimization algorithms. As a future
investigation, we intend to explore ways to improve the
adaptivity of the approach to further reduce the dimension
of the generated graphs.
