Abstract— Color is one of the most important and widely used 
cues in content analysis and retrieval. However, most 
promising color descriptors consume massive amounts of 
computation and storage, which is a serious drawback. One of 
these promising color techniques in image retrieval is the color 
correlogram, but the technique also suffers from the 
aforementioned drawbacks. In this paper, we present two 
compact representations of the color correlogram. The first 
representation is the compact-generalized correlogram, which 
compresses colors and generalizes the distances of the original 
correlogram descriptor. The second representation is the 
dominant color-based correlogram, which is also a compact 
and conceptual correlogram descriptor. This representation 
computes the spatial correlations of the dominant colors of a 
few images instead of a large number of quantized colors used 
by the original descriptor. The two representations are 
integrated. 
The 
experimental 
results 
prove 
the 
high 
effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed descriptors 
through two large image databases (i.e., Corel-10K and 
Cartoon-11K) using ARR, ANMRR, P(10), and MAP metrics.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Color descriptors play an important role in reducing the 
gap between low-level features, such as color, texture, and 
shape, and high-level semantic concepts, such as emotions, 
events, or scenes [1][2]. Color is considered a powerful cue 
for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) [3][4] and is also 
an effective feature in image analysis because color is robust 
with noise, image orientation, and resolution [2][4–6]. 
Therefore, various color descriptors have been proposed in 
previous studies [7–9]. The color histogram [7] and its 
enhancements [10–12] are good attempts at creating color 
descriptors because of their ability to solve translation and 
rotation invariant problems. However, the color histogram 
and its enhancements lack the spatial correlation of colors 
that allows different images to be considered similar. 
One of the most promising approaches in solving the 
problem is color correlogram [13][14], which preserves the 
spatial correlations of color information for accurate image 
retrieval. The color correlogram approach demonstrates high 
effectiveness compared with the color histogram and an 
earlier spatial–color approach called the color coherence 
vector (CCV) [9]. The color correlogram is a table indexed 
by color pairs (Ci, Cj), where the kth entry specifies the 
probability of finding a color Ci at a distance k from a color 
Cj in the image; i, j are the indexes of colors within a range 
of m quantized colors; and k is a distance within the range of 
a maximum distance d.  
The problem of the correlogram lies in the expensive cost 
of memory space and computation time, with the 
correlogram requiring O(m2d) complexity. This cost is an 
infeasibility problem for use in a huge database, especially 
regarding memory space. Several gigabytes are required for 
a large database, which may not be available in the main 
memory of a computer. Therefore, the Autocorrelogram [13] 
is proposed to reduce the time and space complexity into 
O(md) by finding the spatial correlation of each color with 
only itself. The accuracy of the Autocorrelogram is certainly 
lower than the original correlogram because the correlations 
of a particular color with other colors are ignored, and the 
only correlation with the same color is kept.  
In this paper, a compact and generalized representation of 
the color correlogram is proposed, which reduces the 
complexity 
of 
the 
correlogram 
from 
O(m2d) 
to 
O(m2/2 + m/2). The proposed representation is slightly more 
complex than the Autocorrelogram (or less complex than the 
Autocorrelogram in some cases when d is large). The 
proposed method outperforms the Autocorrelogram and 
achieves the same (or slightly lower) accuracy than the 
original correlogram. The satisfactory performance is caused 
by the preservation of the spatial correlations among all the 
colors in the image, which reduces the memory space of the 
colors (m2) to approximately half (m2/2+m/2). The proposed 
representation also generalizes all d distances into one 
distance value by taking the average of all distances. In this 
case, keeping many distances that refer to separate spatial 
correlations becomes expensive. Instead, averaging the 
distance significantly reduces the complexity of the 
descriptor with very little degradation in accuracy.  
Color descriptors, including the color correlogram, are 
weak in image recognition or discrimination because the 
naive rules that the color descriptors are based on do not 
simulate the human visual system [3][4]. Therefore, more 
improvements can be done in this field. Much research has 
been conducted on human color perception (e.g., [15][16]), 
which show that humans use only a few of the prominent or 
dominant colors of the image to judge similarity. Two rules 
on the model human visual and color perception exist. The 
first rule states that two images are considered similar if the 
images have the same dominant colors (DCs). The second 
rule indicates that the two images are perceived to be similar 
if the images have the same distribution of DCs irrespective

of content [4]. Humans consider the DCs and the spatial 
distributions of images to judge color similarity. Therefore, 
dominant color descriptors have been introduced in many 
studies (e.g., [17–20]) instead of descriptors that use a large 
number of colors, such as the color histogram and color 
moments [7][10][12].  
The color correlogram has perceptual and infeasibility 
problems in large databases. Thus, a perceptual correlogram 
was introduced [4], which applies ColGrm concepts on a few 
DCs instead of a large number of colors. However, the 
perceptual correlogram has some deficiencies in simulating 
the original correlogram through the imperfect similarity 
measure, which will be explained in Section IV. In the 
present paper, an adaptation of the perceptual correlogram 
[4] is proposed. The adapted descriptor is called a DC-based 
color correlogram (DCBC), which adapts the dissimilarity 
measure of the perceptual correlogram by correctly 
simulating the original correlogram on a few dominant 
colors. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
presents the related works on the color-based CBIR. Section 
III introduces the compact-generalized correlogram (CGC), 
and Section IV presents the adapted perceptual DC-based 
correlogram. The experimental results of the proposed and 
adapted descriptors and their integration are compared with 
some candidate descriptors in Section V. Section VI 
concludes the paper.  
II. RELATED WORK 
Many studies have been conducted on content-based 
image retrieval (CBIR), such as Visual-SEEk [21], QBIC 
[22], Photobook [23], and Image-Rover [24]. In these 
studies, several visual (low-level) features, such as color, 
texture, and shape, were used. Color is one of the most 
commonly used features in CBIR [3][4]. Therefore, this 
study focuses solely on color to retrieve images in the CBIR 
domain.  
Previous studies vary in their usage of color descriptors 
[3]. Some use global color descriptors (GCDs), and others 
used spatial color descriptors (SCDs). The former is used to 
measure the similarity between two images by taking the 
colors and their percentages in the images into account, such 
as the color histogram [7][10] and the dominant colors [17–
19][28]. The latter measures the similarity between the two 
images by considering the existing colors and their 
distributions or arrangements in the image, such as in the 
CCV [9] and color correlogram [13][14].  
The color histogram in GCDs proposed in [7] has been 
extensively used as a GCD to solve translation and rotation 
invariant problems. This color histogram is characterized by 
easy implementation and accuracy particularly in small 
databases. 
Many 
enhancements 
in 
histogram-based 
approaches have been achieved, as reported in [10][11][25]. 
The original representation of the RGB color is 24-bits 16-
million colors that are assigned to each pixel in the image, 
leading to an infeasibility problem for both time and memory 
space. Therefore, static quantization [39] is used to reduce 
color space to make storage and time more reasonable. 
However, 
histogram-based 
approaches 
have 
several 
drawbacks. The first one is the dependence on a static 
quantization method, which suffers from low discrimination 
power. The lack of discrimination is caused by a large 
number of similar colors set to different bins, making the 
similarity measure (i.e., L1, L2 or histogram intersection) 
between the two histograms inefficient. The second 
drawback is the mismatch of the methods with human color 
perception [19][26][28]. Humans cannot perceive more than 
eight colors [27] or can only perceive a few prominent colors 
in an image [4][15][16]. Therefore, extracting DCs from the 
image becomes the best solution because DCs require less 
time and storage consumption.  
Although DCs are not that effective in color-based image 
retrieval, it is still considered a GCD. The basic problem of 
these descriptors is the lack of spatial correlations of colors 
within the image. This absence leads to considering different 
images in terms of color distribution as similar because of 
the same color percentages. The complement part (spatial 
relationship of colors) of the similarity of images is “where 
the colors are located” [3][4]. GCDs work without the 
complement part; thus, the results are not satisfactorily 
presented in the CBIR field. Many methods have been 
proposed to include the complement part, such as the CCV 
[9]. A pixel is considered coherent if its color is similar to 
the color of the region to which it belongs; otherwise, the 
pixel is considered incoherent. Many approaches have also 
been proposed to prove the high effectiveness of the spatial 
relationship among image colors such as [29], which used 
the concept of color boundaries, and [5][8], which used the 
color adjacency concept. These approaches lead to a simple 
conclusion that the relative distance (inter-distance) of the 
colors of an image can capture the true or real composition 
of the colors in the image.  
These SCDs have two important properties: translation 
and rotation invariant. One of the most active approaches 
among all the SCDs is the color correlogram (ColGrm) 
[13][14]. The ColGrm is a table indexed by color pairs (Ci, 
Cj), where the kth entry specifies the probability of finding a 
color Ci at a distance k from a color Cj in the image; i, j are 
indexes of the colors within the range of m quantized colors; 
and k is the distance within the maximum distance d. 
The ColGrm complexity is O(m2d), which consumes high 
CPU time and memory space, especially in a large database. 
For example, the image of width (W = 500) and height 
(H = 400) is assumed. In such dimensions, a suitable value 
for d would be 40–200, corresponding to the following 
formula: d ≈ 10% to 50% of the smaller dimensions in the 
image [2][3]. Any value of d less than this range will not be 
suitable in capturing the true spatial color distributions of the 
image because only colors within a small range will be 
described. The complexity of correlogram algorithm remains 
too high and requires several processing hours per image on 
a computer even with a lower bound selection of the range of 
distance d (d = 40). Moreover, an infeasible memory space 
for the feature vector will be required even for a small image 
database. Several possible solutions can be applied to solve 
this infeasibility problem. The first solution is the reduction 
of the range of distance d (e.g., let d ≈ 10), which will reduce 
the complexity by only fourfold (an insignificant reduction) 
53

and will be unable to precisely identify the true spatial color 
distribution. Another solution is the reduction of the color 
space using the quantization algorithm. The typical 
quantization for RGB color space is 8 partitions for each 
band (8 × 8 × 8), which will equal to 512 colors and will 
speed up the ColGrm by about 30-fold. However, immense 
memory space (about 80 megabytes (MB) per image) will 
still be required, making the ColGrm applicable for only 
small databases. Therefore, a simplified version of the 
ColGrm called AutoCorrelogram is introduced [13]. The 
Autocorrelogram only characterizes the spatial color 
distribution of the same colors, i.e., each color with itself 
without identifying correlations with other colors. The latter 
case may cause the degradation of the color descriptor, 
which actually occurred in many studies [1–4][13][14] that 
reported the ColGrm to be better in retrieval accuracy than 
the Autocorrelogram.  
Ma and Zhang [30] and recently [31][32] show (using 
extensive 
experiments) 
that 
the 
ColGrm 
and 
Autocorrelogram can achieve better performance than those 
of other global and spatial color descriptors, such as the color 
histogram, color moments, and CCV, despite the limitations 
of correlograms. Some extensions were made to both, such 
as the Markov Stationary Features [33], which is an 
extension of the Autocorrelogram, Wavelet Correlogram 
[34], and Gabor wavelet correlogram [35]. All these 
approaches perform only slightly better than the original 
ColGrm descriptor, which has more time complexity [4]. A 
recent method reduces the time complexity of ColGrm by the 
approximation of a descriptor [36], depending on the 
randomization of selecting the neighbors of the pixels. The 
method certainly decreases the accuracy compared with the 
original ColGrm but decreases time complexity to half. The 
drawbacks of this method are that the complexity of the 
memory space remains O(m2d) and that the accuracy of such 
an algorithm is not fixed because of the dependence on the 
randomization of selecting the candidate pixels to build the 
ColGrm feature vector. Therefore, the proposed method 
depends on the original ColGrm in adaptation and 
comparison. A compact representation of the ColGrm is 
proposed in this paper to solve the problem of infeasibility. 
The details of the proposed method are presented in Section 
III. 
DC-based methods can be used to solve the perceptual 
and infeasibility problems of the color histogram. However, 
the DC-based methods remain as GCDs and lack spatial 
color correlations. Therefore, the DC concept can be 
integrated with the ColGrm to obtain better performance 
than when each is applied separately. A satisfactory attempt 
was recently conducted to integrate the two in [4], which 
used a penalty trio model to find the dissimilarity between 
the two images by joining the global (from DCs) and the 
spatial (from ColGrm) information. Kiranyaz et al. [4] 
changed the dissimilarity equation of ColGrm, which is 
claimed to be inefficient, but such change would lead to 
serious performance degradation. This problem will be 
discussed in more detail in Section IV. A duo-model instead 
of a trio-model is proposed to solve the problem of the later 
model.  
III. THE PROPOSED CGC DESCRIPTOR 
The color correlogram offers the best performance 
among the GCDs and SCDs, as mentioned in Section II. 
However, the massive consumption of time and memory 
space remains its major drawback. Some reduction can be 
achieved for its time and feature vector space through a 
critical analysis of the process of the correlogram.

is a table of probabilities for finding the 
spatial correlation of a certain color with the other colors 
within an image from a specific distance. The table is 
indexed by the triple (Ci, Cj, k), where Ci and Cj represent 
the colors their neighboring probabilities need to know in a 
distance k. The indexes’ values i, j are within the m 
quantized colors, and the k value is within the maximum 
distance d. The ColGrm maintains spatial correlation among 
the colors in the image. The ColGrm table is depicted in 
Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1.  Original color correlogram feature vector representation with a 
complexity of O(m2d). 
Figure 1 shows that the massive storage space of this 
representation lies in the colors and distances. Therefore, our 
proposed method is focused on the reduction of these two 
factors without a significant degradation of the performance 
of the original ColGrm. 
A. Color Reduction 
In the first factor (colors), the square matrix of colors in 
Figure 1 contains the probabilities of finding color i at the 
distance k from color j. A repetition of information is 
noticeable through a proper logical analysis of this color 
representation. The probability of finding color i with a 
specific distance from color j is located in the two positions 
in the matrix: locations (i, j) and (j, i). Intuitively, the 
existence of a white color beside a black one, for example, 
has the same meaning as a black color being beside a white 
one. Black is on the right of white; thus, we can find white 
on the left of black. The co-occurrence matrix of the colors 
in the original representation increases in the two locations 
co-occurrence (black, white) and co-occurrence (white, 
black), as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2.  An example of computing the ColGrm table in the image 
window in a simple setting (direction = 0 and distance = 1), which shows 
the similarity of the lower rectangular matrix with the upper one. 
Figure 2 is an example of the image window that has 
three colors, namely, white (w), gray (g), and black (b). A 
simple setting (direction = 0 and distance = 1) is considered 
as a simple explanation to the reader. The direction equal to 
zero and the distance equal to one indicate that only the 
horizontal (left and right) neighbors of the pixels are 
considered during the extraction of the ColGrm table. The 
elements of the co-occurrence matrix are shown in Figure 2. 
For example, the co-occurrence (white, black) = 9 means that 
9 horizontal black neighbors to the white color exist. The 
ColGrm table holds the probability instead of the number of 
the occurrence of colors; thus, the co-occurrence matrix is 
simply divided by the number of all neighbors in the 10 × 10 
window, which is 180. The ColGrm table shows that 
ColGrm (w, g) = ColGrm (g, w) and all the other elements in 
the lower triangular matrix are similar to the elements of the 
upper matrix. Therefore, repeating these elements is useless 
because one element is sufficient for each of the two colors 
instead of two elements. Keeping the upper triangular matrix 
with the main diagonal is enough to maintain the whole 
matrix. The upper triangular matrix in the new proposed 
representation is duplicated to substitute the absence of the 
lower matrix. The ColGrm complexity can be reduced to 
approximately half, i.e., O(m2/2+m/2) instead of O(m2), as 
shown in the shaded cells of Figure 3. Therefore, only the 
upper triangular matrix and the main diagonal must be 
computed and saved. 
The dissimilarity measure equation remains the same as 
the original correlogram, as depicted in (1) [13][14].

B. Distance Reduction 
Distance is the second specified factor in reducing the 
complexity of the ColGrm feature vector. The number of 
distances required for the ColGrm to capture the true spatial 
correlations of the colors ranges from 10% to 50% of the 
smaller dimension in the image. This process consumes CPU 
time and memory space, as depicted in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 3.  New ColGrm matrix representations. The shaded cells represent 
the actual required storage space for the colors (approximately half the size 
of the colors in the ColGrm). 
The reduction of time and space is required to apply the 
ColGrm in a large database. The proposed solution to reduce 
these 
distances 
is 
generalization. 
The 
proposed 
generalization scheme that can be applied for distances is to 
average all distances. Distances are very important in 
measuring how many pixels exist between a certain color 
and other colors. For example, the image with three colors in 
Figure 2, where d = 1 and ColGrm (white, gray, d) = 0.15, 
indicates that the probability of finding a white color far 
from a gray color by one pixel is 0.15. When d = 2 and 
ColGrm (white, gray, d) = 0.149, the probability of finding a 
white color from a gray color by two pixels is 0.149. This 
pixel-based structure is unfortunately one of the main 
drawbacks of the ColGrm [3][4] because the color vicinity is 
characterized at a pixel level, which is unfeasible (in terms of 
time and space) in high resolution images and has no 
meaning with regard to the human visual system. The 
individual pixels cannot be perceived by the human eye. The 
average of all distances can be computed to eliminate this 
effect from the ColGrm and generalize the distance. The 
layers of the distance shown in Figure 1 can be abbreviated 
to one layer that contains the probabilities of generally 
finding the colors in the image l. In Figure 1, the size of the 
image is 10 × 10; thus, a distance = 5 is selected as 50% of 
the smaller dimension in the image. When distance = 5 and 
the generalization of ColGrm is applied, one layer is 
produced. For example, ColGrm (white, gray) = 0.145 means 
that the probability of finding the white color far from the 
gray color by 3 pixels (average of 5 distances is 3) is 
generally 0.145. This process ensures the generality of the 
descriptor and eliminates pixel-level dependency (especially 
in high-resolution images). The spatial correlations of the 
55

colors in general for all the images in the database are also 
described. A general vision of the image contents (colors) is 
drawn instead of depending on the individual distances of the 
colors that lack feasibility and human perception. The 
complexity of the distance becomes 1 (instead of d in 
original ColGrm). The total complexity of the proposed 
ColGrm after color and distance reduction becomes 
O(m2/2+m/2) instead of O(m2d), as shown in Figure 3. The 
complexity 
of 
the 
proposed 
compact 
ColGrm 
is 
O(m2/2+m/2) during the image retrieval process and storage 
space but is O(m2d) during the feature extraction process 
because all distances must first be computed prior to the 
average. Feature extraction is an offline process, which 
means that extraction is performed once and the feature 
vectors can be saved in a database ready for the online 
retrieval process. Therefore, the speed of the interactive 
process with the user is not significantly affected. 
IV. 
THE ADAPTED DC-BASED CORRELOGRAM 
DESCRIPTOR 
DC-based approaches are introduced to solve the 
perceptual problem of the conventional color-based 
approaches by simulating human color perception. One of 
the most promising DC-based approaches is the method 
proposed by S. Kiranyaz et al. [4], which integrates DCs 
with ColGrm to solve the problems of both methods. These 
problems include the lack of the spatial colors information 
problem of the DC-based approaches and the infeasibility 
problem of the original ColGrm descriptor, especially in 
large 
databases. 
The 
method 
is 
called 
perceptual 
correlogram. The DCs are extracted from an image through a 
method similar to [18], which simulates human color 
perception. Then, these DCs are back-projected on the image 
to extract the color correlogram that depends on the DCs. 
This method proposes a trio-model to measure the dis-
similarity of the two images, as depicted in (2) [4].  
 
Ptrio(Q, I) = P∅ (Q,I)+ (α PG(Q, I)+(1- α)PCorr(Q, I)).    (2) 
 
The trio-model has three measuring metrics: P∅, PG, and 
PCorr. The first metric (P∅) measures the mismatching colors 
and their percentages in the two compared images, as 
depicted in (3) [4]. Wi and Ci represent the percentages and 
the colors values in the mismatching color list (S∅). The other 
two metrics (PG and PCorr) measure the difference between 
the matched colors of the two images. PG measures the 
global difference between the two images, as expressed in 
(4) [4]. Nm represents the number of matching colors of the 
two images; Ts represents color similarity threshold, and β is 
the value between 0 and 1, which represents the adjustment 
between the two terms of (4). PCorr measures the spatial (or 
ColGrm) difference between the two images, as shown in (5) 
[4], where MC represents a list of similar (matched) colors 
between the two images Q and I.

In other words, P∅ and PG measure the global 
differences, and PCorr measures the spatial differences 
between the compared images. A proper critical analysis of 
the trio-model reveals serious drawbacks. The first 
drawback occurs in computing the ColGrm dissimilarity 
metric (PCorr), and the second drawback lies in existence of 
the PG and P∅ that compute general dissimilarity and 
represent a different perspective from ColGrm dis-
similarity. The limitation of PCorr in (5) is identified through 
a comparison with the dissimilarity measure of the original 
ColGrm, as shown in (2). The results of both dissimilarity 
measures are compared in Table I. 
The similarity measure of the method proposed [4] has 
a serious problem, which is the lack of discrimination of the 
dissimilarity measure between large and small differences of 
the probability values because the dissimilarity values of 
large differences are equal to those of small differences (as 
depicted in the fourth column of Table I). This matter is 
contrary to human visual perception because the human eye 
cannot recognize small differences. The original ColGrm 
dissimilarity keeps these differences linear. If the difference 
is large, the dissimilar value is also large; and if it is small, 
the result is also small.

The dissimilar value of the perceptual descriptor is 
illogical because even a small difference obtains a large 
dissimilar value (reaching to 1), and an image may have 
many small colors. The other metrics (i.e., P∅ and PG) in the 
dissimilarity measure also have values based on the 
percentages of colors (from 0 to 1), which conflicts with PCorr 
that has a value fixed in both the large and small percentages

of color. Therefore, the dissimilarity measure of the original 
ColGrm is better than that of the perceptual ColGrm [4]. The 
original ColGrm has a fixed color space, whereas the 
perceptual ColGrm has a dynamic and variable number of 
colors.  
In other words, computing P∅ and PG (global differences) 
with PCorr (spatial difference) is unsuitable because of the 
difference in values and perspective. In the perceptual 
ColGrm, Kiranyaz et al. was forced to use the two together 
because the PCorr metric computes the dissimilarity of the 
matched colors only, whereas the original ColGrm 
dissimilarity measure equation computes the dissimilar 
values for matched and mismatched colors together. 
Therefore, the concept of original ColGrm can be applied to 
the adapted DC-based ColGrm, which computes the matched 
and mismatched colors in the same metric. The probability 
values of the matched colors between the two images in the 
adapted method will be directly compared because the 
mismatched colors for each of the two images will be 
compared with zeros, as in (8). 
The corresponding probability values of the mismatching 
colors in the adapted ColGrm can be considered as zeros 
similar to those in the original ColGrm. The original ColGrm 
is simulated and can be considered the second term aside 
from PCorr. The proposed duo-model of the adapted DCBC is 
expressed as follows:

  MC represents the list of the matched colors between the

Moreover, ai, j represents the similarity ratio between the

The color threshold Tc represents the maximum distance, 
in which the two colors are considered similar, and is set to 
20, and dmax = αTc, α = 1, or 1.2. In (7), ai,j is multiplied to 
the ColGrm dissimilarity values when d ≤ 5. The reasons 
behind multiplying only the main diagonal of the ColGrm 
array by the color similarity ratio (ai,j) is that the main 
diagonal values often represent the percentages of the colors 
in the image (especially when d is small) because it contains 
the probability of finding each color with itself, except for 
the colors that are too scattered in the image, and is rarely 
used in images that are converted into images of 8 DCs as 
the maximum. The other values in the ColGrm matrix 
represent the probabilities of finding a certain color with 
other colors (spatial correlations). Therefore, multiplying the 
color similarity ratio with the percentages of the DCs 
simulates the DC-based approaches to alleviate the problem 
of non-identical matched colors. 
In sum, the differences between the adapted DC-based 
ColGrm descriptor and the perceptual ColGrm descriptor lie 
in two positions. The first difference is that the perceptual 
descriptor depends on the dissimilarity measure from the 
different perspectives, with the three metrics measuring the 
dissimilarity between two images. P∅ and PG are used to 
measure the global differences of colors. These metrics are 
produced from the approach perspective of DC. PCorr 
measures the spatial correlations of the matched colors only 
between the two images. This metric represents the ColGrm 
perspective. Combining different perspective metrics may 
lead to the inconsistency of these metrics, which may 
produce an inaccurate dissimilarity value. Nevertheless, the 
adapted DC-based ColGrm depends on the ColGrm 
perspective only, which can measure global and spatial color 
differences together efficiently, making accuracy better than 
that of the perceptual descriptor (as shown in the 
experimental results in Section V). The second difference is 
the dissimilarity measure of the perceptual ColGrm 
descriptor (PCorr), which is different from the original metric. 
The new metric has a serious limitation of being unable to 
differentiate between large and small probabilities of the 
correlations of color in the image, as shown in Table I.  
V. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  
The evaluation of the proposed compact-generalized 
ColGrm descriptor, adapted DC-based ColGrm descriptor, 
and the integration of both is conducted on two datasets: 1) 
the well-known Corel-10K dataset that contains 80 classes 
and 10,800 images, with 100 images existing for each class 
in the dataset; and 2) the Cartoon-11K dataset that contains 
11,120 images collected from the web, with 146 classes 
(cartoon characters) existing, with each one having at least 
35 images. The two datasets are used to show the superiority 
of the proposed color-based descriptors in large databases. 
The descriptors selected to be compared with the 
proposed CGC, adapted DCBC, and the integration of the 
two are the original ColGrm [13][14] (whenever applicable), 
AutoCorrelogram [13], MPEG-7 Dominant Color Descriptor 
(DCD) [17], and Perceptual ColGrm [4]. The rationale for 
this selection is the representation of the first two descriptors 
of the original ColGrm descriptor, which are considered the 
base of the proposed descriptors. The third descriptor (DCD) 
is the base of any DC-based approach, which is used in 
DCBC. The last descriptor represents the original descriptor, 
which has been adapted to produce the DCBC descriptor.

A. Performance Measure Metrics 
A quantitative performance measure metrics is utilized to 
measure the accuracy of the proposed descriptors with the 
other ColGrm descriptors chosen for comparison. Two of the 
metrics are the average retrieval rate (ARR) [37] and the 
average normalized modified retrieval rank (ANMRR) 
[17][37]. These metrics are used by the MPEG-7 committee 
to evaluate its work and are considered two of the most 
widely used metrics. These metrics combine many 
conventional metrics, including hit–miss counters, precision-
recall, and ranking information, and they represent all-in-one 
value. The third metric is the mean average precision (MAP), 
which is one of the most widely used metrics in CBIR and is 
a compromise between precision and recall in a single metric 
[32][38]. This metric has become one of the leading 
performance evaluation metrics in ad hoc retrieval systems 
[38]. The fourth metric is P(10), which is a precision value of 
the first 10 retrieved images by a specific query. This metric 
is the most widely used metric for web-based image retrieval 
[32], as the user tends to see the result of his query in the first 
page or prefer to reformulate the query instead of checking 
the second page. The best value for the metrics ARR, P(10), 
and MAP is close to 1, indicating that the relevant images are 
retrieved in good standing. The best value of ANMRR is 
close to 0. MAP differs from ANMRR in that MAP 
measures the retrieval accuracy to all relevant images in the 
database to a particular query, whereas ANMRR measures 
the retrieval accuracy within a specific window (W) size. 
The window size is normally equal to twofold of the ground 
truth size of a specific image query. 
The complexity of the proposed descriptors, in terms of 
time and memory space, is also urgently computed as the 
fifth metric to prove their applicability in large databases. 
The applicability of the proposed descriptors in large 
databases is the main aim of this study. The accuracy metrics 
are used to prove that the compactness of the proposed 
descriptors does not significantly degrade performance. 
B. Retrieval Performance 
The retrieval performance of the competing descriptors in 
the specified datasets can be measured using the accuracy 
and complexity metrics. The complexity metrics represent 
the computing time and memory space needed for the 
comparison of the proposed descriptors with the competing 
descriptors. Time is divided into feature extraction time 
(offline) and image retrieval time (online). Memory space is 
referred to as the main memory or disk space required by 
the descriptors. The diversity of queries is also important in 
ensuring fair and honest results [38]; thus, the evaluation 
queries are selected from all classes of the databases. 
1) Retrieval performance of the Corel-10K dataset 
An experiment is conducted on the Corel-10K dataset 
[40] with 111 queries. The results of the four evaluation 
metrics and the complexity of the memory space are given 
in Tables II and III, respectively, to show the accuracy and 
efficiency of the proposed methods compared with other 
descriptors. A single value in the “MPEG7 DCD” column in 
Table II indicates that this descriptor does not have a 
different setting of distances to compute unlike other 
descriptors. The percentages of colors are depended upon 
rather than the distances among colors, which are used in 
spatial ColGrm methods. The left part of Table II (i.e., the 
first three columns) shows that the best accuracy values are 
those of the original ColGrm, which are better than 
proposed CGC. However, the values are applicable only for 
minimum settings (3 × 3 × 3 colors of each band and 
distances equal to 5 and 10), as shown in Tables II and V. 
The slight degradation of the accuracy of the proposed 
descriptor is caused by the generalization of the distances 
that loses the values of the accurate distances. A comparison 
is then made by increasing the setting, such as 4 × 4 × 4 
colors 
and 
5, 
10, 
and 
40 
distances. 
Only 
the 
Autocorrelogram and the proposed CGC can be applied in 
this case. The proposed descriptor also outperforms the 
Autocorrelogram because of the preservation of the spatial 
correlation of each image color with other colors, whereas 
the Autocorrelogram has a spatial correlation of each color 
with itself and ignores the others. In the ColGrm 
descriptors, the accuracy is decreased when the number of 
distances is increased because the unsuitable distances will 
have an effect on the suitable distances, which is a certain 
distance indicating that the actual distance between the 
specific color and the other colors in the image exists. The 
memory 
space 
and 
image 
retrieval 
time 
remain 
O(m2/2+m/2), which are online processes (performed when 
comparing the query image ColGrm with all database 
images of the ColGrms), despite the increase in the 
distances of the proposed descriptor. This increase in 
distances only affects the feature extraction process, which 
is an offline process (performed once only when creating the 
database away from an interaction with users), and the 
extraction query image ColGrm, in which the complexity of 
its computation and memory space is O(m2d) and is equal to 
the original correlogram.  
The middle part of Table II (i.e., second three columns) 
shows that the adapted DCBC outperforms the three original 
descriptors (i.e., DCD, ColGrm, and the perceptual ColGr). 
The adapted descriptor is more accurate than the original 
version [4] because the latter has many drawbacks, as 
mentioned in Section IV. The complexity of the perceptual 
and proposed DCBC descriptors is O(82d) as the maximum, 
where 8 represents the maximum DCs that can be extracted 
from the image. The significant degradation accuracy of the 
perceptual descriptor when increasing the distance is also 
noticeable because the incompatibility between the spatial 
dissimilarity (PCorr) and global dissimilarity (P∅ and PG,) 
when increasing the distance leads to the significant change 
in the PCorr. The global dissimilarity values (i.e., P∅ and PG) 
remain unchanged. The dissimilarity measure of the 
perceptual ColGrm descriptor has a serious limitation. The 
integration of the proposed methods is achieved by applying 
the compactness and generalization concepts of the CGC 
(first proposed descriptor) on the DC-based ColGrm 
(second adapted descriptor). The combination outperforms 
58

all three original descriptors (i.e., MPEG-7 DCD, ColGrm, 
and Perceptual ColGrm), with a maximum complexity of 
O(82/2+8/2) = O(36). 
The single value in an entire row in Table III indicates 
that either the descriptor does not have different distances in 
its computations (e.g., MPEG7 DCD) or that the descriptor 
produces the same memory space for all distances (e.g., the 
proposed CGC and the integration of CGC and DCBC). 
Tables II and III show that the integration of CGC and 
DCBC is a promising approach to the minimal consumption 
not only of memory space but also of image retrieval time. 
Increasing the setting of ColGrm to four colors for each 
band (4 × 4 × 4 = 64 colors) leads to the proposed CGC 
outperforming 
all 
the 
other 
competing 
DC-based 
descriptors. This result is caused by the variety of colors (64 
in CGC) being higher than that of the DC-based ColGrm 
approaches (8 colors maximum). 
Table V clearly shows that the original color 
correlogram is inapplicable in a setting with 64 (4 × 4 × 4) 
colors. The original color correlogram has serious 
limitations, such as high computational complexity and 
memory storage (Table IV). Only the Autocorrelogram and 
all the compact descriptors can be applied. The proposed 
descriptors and their integration also outperform the 
Autocorrelogram 
and 
the 
perceptual 
ColGrm. 
The 
perceptual ColGrm appears worse than the Autocorrelogram 
because of the aforementioned limitations shown in Tables 
II and V. The key contribution of this paper is solving the 
feasibility problems (in computations and memory space) of 
the original ColGrm. Increasing the setting to more than 
four colors in each band is not shown in this paper because 
the results are similar to those of the setting of four colors.  
2) Retrieval performance of the Cartoon-11K dataset 
The four evaluation metrics are computed for the 158 
queries on the Cartoon-11K dataset (this database is 
collected from Google and will be published soon) in Tables 
VI and VII, respectively, to show the accuracy of the 
proposed methods compared with other descriptors.  
Table VI shows that the adapted DCBC descriptor 
outperforms all competing descriptors, including the 
perceptual descriptor. The proposed descriptor CGC shows 
the same accuracy as the original ColGrm but with a 
significant reduction in complexity O(m2d) to O(m2/2+m/2).  
Table VII, with a setting of four colors, shows that the 
proposed CGC outperforms the adapted DCBC because the 
abundance of the colors can be expressed on the image 
content more efficiently than DCs. The storage space 
required for the Cartoon database is approximately equal to 
that in the Corel database, as depicted in Tables III and IV. 
These tables show that the compactness of the proposed, 
adapted, and integrated descriptors increases the speed of 
the image retrieval process. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, two compact correlogram descriptors are 
proposed for large databases. The first descriptor, CGC, 
solves the inapplicability problems of the color correlogram 
in large databases. CGC reduces the colors of ColGrm 
approximately by half and performs a generalization of all 
the distances into a single representative distance. This 
descriptor also has less degradation accuracy than the 
original ColGrm, but the latter cannot be applied in a large 
setting with increased colors, distances, or database sizes. 
CGC also outperforms the Autocorrelogram, which can be 
applied in large settings, because the proposed method 
keeps the correlations of each color in the image with other 
colors, whereas the Autocorrelogram keeps the correlations 
of each color only with itself and ignores the relations with 
other colors. The second descriptor is the DC-based ColGrm 
adapted from the perceptual ColGrm [4], which suffers from 
serious limitations in its dissimilarity measure. DCs offer 
both perceptual and compact descriptions of colors. 
Therefore, the combination of DCs with ColGrm surpasses 
all the competing descriptors in terms of accuracy, time, and 
storage space. Integrating the proposed descriptors also 
shows 
promising 
results 
in 
significantly 
reducing 
complexity.
