Abstract—In this paper, we propose a novel unambiguous 
acquisition scheme for binary offset carrier (BOC) signals. 
Specifically, we first find out that the side-peaks arise due to 
the fact that the BOC autocorrelation is made up of the sum of 
the irregularly shaped sub-correlations, and then, propose an 
unambiguous acquisition scheme by recombining the sub-
correlations. The proposed scheme is shown to remove the 
side-peaks completely for any type of BOC signal and to 
provide a better performance than the conventional scheme in 
terms of the incorrect acquisition probability and mean 
acquisition time.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, new global navigation satellite systems 
(GNSSs) such as Galileo and global positioning system 
(GPS) modernization are being developed to satisfy the 
increasing demand for GNSS-based services such as 
location-based service (LBS) and emergency rescue service 
(ERS) and complement the existing GNSSs such as GPS [1]-
[2]. Currently, new GNSSs are designed to use the same 
frequency band of the existing GNSSs: for example, the E1 
and E5 bands of Galileo are overlapped with the L1 and L5 
bands of GPS, respectively [1], [3]. Thus, if a Galileo signal 
is modulated by a conventional scheme such as phase shift 
keying (PSK) used in GPS, it would suffer from co-channel 
interference. To overcome these problems, binary offset 
carrier (BOC) modulation has been proposed, where a high 
degree of spectral separation between the BOC-modulated 
signals and the others is achieved by shifting the signal 
energy from the band center [4]. The BOC signal is 
generated through the product of a spreading pseudo random 
noise (PRN) code and a sine-phased or cosine-phased square 
wave sub-carrier, and denoted by 
BOCsin
(
, )
kn n
 or 
BOCcos
(
, )
kn n  depending on which of the sine-phased or 
cosine-phased sub-carriers are used, where k  and n  are the 
ratios of the PRN code chip period to the sub-carrier period 
and the PRN code chip rate to 1.023 MHz, respectively [3], 
[5]. For larger values of ,k  more separated spectrums are 
obtained, reducing the co-channel interference more 
effectively. 
However, the BOC signal has multiple side-peaks on 
both sides of the main-peak of its autocorrelation function. 
Moreover, the number of side-peaks increases as the value of 
k
 becomes 
larger. 
Thus, 
the 
correlation-based 
synchronization schemes [6]-[11] originally proposed for 
PRN code synchronization would suffer from the ambiguous 
problem in the BOC signal synchronization due to the side-
peaks in the BOC autocorrelation. 
Several unambiguous acquisition schemes [12]-[16] have 
been proposed in order to tackle the problem. In [12]-[14], 
sideband filtering was used to deal with the ambiguous 
problem in the BOC signal acquisition; however, these 
schemes destroy the sharpness of the main-peak of the BOC 
autocorrelation function, degrading the BOC signal tracking 
performance severely. In [15], an interesting unambiguous 
acquisition scheme that maintains the sharp main-peak of the 
BOC autocorrelation function was proposed combining the 
correlation between the BOC and PRN signals with the BOC 
autocorrelation; however, this scheme is applicable to only 
BOCsin
( , )
n n  signals. In [16], a generalized unambiguous 
acquisition scheme including the scheme in [15] as a special 
case was proposed. This scheme is applicable to generic 
BOCsin
(
, )
kn n  signals; however, its extension to generic 
BOCcos
(
, )
kn n  signals is not straightforward. In addition, in 
[17], an unambiguous scheme applicable to both sine- 
phased and cosine-phased BOC signals was proposed by the 
authors preliminarily; however, the performance of the 
scheme becomes worse as the value of k  increases. 
In this paper, a novel unambiguous acquisition scheme 
applicable to both 
BOCsin
(
, )
kn n  and 
BOCcos
(
, )
kn n  signals 
is proposed based on a recombination of the sub-correlations 
making up the BOC autocorrelation. The scheme is found to 
remove the side-peaks of the BOC autocorrelation 
completely, while keeping the sharp shape of the main-peak. 
Moreover, it is demonstrated that the scheme offers a 
performance improvement over the scheme in [16] in terms 
of the incorrect acquisition probability and mean acquisition 
time (MAT). 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II analyzes the sub-correlations making up the BOC 
autocorrelation. In Section III, an unambiguous acquisition 
scheme with no side-peak is proposed by recombining the

finally, Section V concludes this paper.

correlations, thus forming the sharp main-peak of the BOC 
autocorrelation, and on the other hand, the sub-peaks of the 
sub-correlations are irregularly spread around the main-peaks, 
and thus, the summation of the sub-correlations results in the 
multiple side-peaks of the BOC autocorrelation. In the next 
section, we propose a novel unambiguous acquisition 
scheme, removing the side-peaks completely through a 
recombination of the sub-correlations. 
III. 
PROPOSED SCHEME 
Fig. 2 shows the unambiguous correlation functions of 
the proposed scheme for 
BOCsin
( , )
n n  and 
BOCcos
( , )
n n  as 
an example. From the figure, we can observe that

 are symmetric 
with respect to

 and have only a single overlapped peak 
at 
τ = 0
 for 
BOCsin
(
, )
kn n  and 
BOCcos
(
, ),
kn n
 respectively. 
Thus, if the two sub-correlations are summed, a main-peak 
with a larger magnitude (than that of the main-peak of a sub-
correlation) is obtained without increasing the magnitudes of 
the side-peaks, and on the other hand, the difference between 
the two sub-correlations yields side-peaks only, whose 
magnitudes and positions are the same as those of the side-
peaks in the sum of the two sub-correlations. Thus, the 
difference between the two sub-correlations might be used to 
remove the side-peaks in the sum of the two sub-correlations, 
leaving only the main-peak. This observation is the key 
motivation of the proposed scheme. 
Since the side-peaks in the sum and difference of the two 
sub-correlations are out-of-phase and in-phase at 
τ < 0
 and 
τ > 0,
 respectively, however, we cannot remove the side-
peaks in the sum of the two sub-correlations completely 
through the subtraction between the sum and difference of 
the two sub-correlations. To align the phases of the side-
peaks in the sum and difference of the two sub-correlations, 
thus, we use the sum of the absolute values of the two sub-
correlations, obtaining the side-peaks with the same slopes as 
those of the side-peaks in the absolute difference of the two 
sub-correlations. Fig. 2 shows that the subtraction of the 
absolute difference of the two sub-correlations from the sum 
of the absolute values of the two sub-correlations yields an 
unambiguous correlation function with a single main-peak 
and no side-peak. 
Since the unambiguous correlation function is generated 
by using only two sub-correlations out of

 Considering 
that each sub-correlation has only a small portion of the total 
energy, we multiply the unambiguous correlation function 
with the BOC autocorrelation to obtain an unambiguous 
correlation function with higher main-peak, allowing it 
possible to make use of more signal energy. 
From the above discussions, the proposed unambiguous 
correlation function can be expressed as

IV. 
NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, the proposed unambiguous acquisition 
scheme is compared with the unambiguous acquisition 
scheme in [16] called the general removing ambiguity via 
side-peak suppression (GRASS) in terms of the incorrect 
acquisition probability and MAT. In the comparisons, we 
assume the following parameters: a PRN code of 
T = 127
 
chips, a correlation length of 
N = 127
 chips, and a search 
step size of 
sT  and 
sT /2
 for the sine-phased and cosine-
phased BOC signals, respectively. For the MAT simulation, 
the penalty time and probability of false alarm are set to 4T  
and 10-3, respectively. 
Fig. 3 shows the incorrect acquisition probabilities for the 
proposed, GRASS, and traditional BOC schemes as a 
function 
of 
the 
carrier-to-noise 
ratio 
(CNR) 
for 
BOCsin
(
, )
kn n  and 
BOCcos
(
, )
kn n  when 
k = 1
 and 2,  where 
the incorrect acquisition probability is defined as the 
probability that any one of correlation values at 
τ ≠ 0
 
exceeds the main-peak magnitude of the correlation function,  
and the CNR is defined as 
/ 0
P N  (dB-Hz). The performance 
of the GRASS scheme is not shown for 
BOCcos
(
, )
kn n  since 
it is dedicated to the sine-phased BOC signals only. As 
shown in the figure, the proposed scheme yields an 
improvement over the GRASS scheme, and the improvement 
becomes larger as the value of k  increases. On the other 
hand, the performance of the proposed scheme is slightly 
inferior to that of the traditional BOC scheme at relatively 
low CNRs (less than about 35 dB-Hz and 38 dB-Hz for

 respectively), which can  
be explained as follows. A noise enhancement arises due to 
several absolute operations involved in the proposed scheme 
and its effect becomes more pronounced at relatively low 
CNRs, and eventually, overwhelms that of the side-peak 
removal of the proposed scheme, thus degrading the 
performance of the proposed scheme at relatively low CNRs. 
However, as the value of CNR increases, the side-peak 
removal effect would become predominant over the noise 
enhancement effect, thus resulting in a performance 
improvement of the proposed scheme over the traditional 
ambiguous BOC scheme. Furthermore, the improvement 
increases as the value of k  increases.

As shown in the figure, the proposed scheme outperforms 
the GRASS scheme in terms of MAT. Although the 
traditional BOC scheme has a slightly better performance 
than that of the proposed scheme at high CNR, the 
performances of the proposed and traditional BOC schemes 
are both good at high CNR, and thus, the small performance 
difference between the two schemes is insignificant at high 
CNR. 
In addition, let us add a brief discussion on the 
computational complexity of the proposed and traditional 
schemes. From Fig. 2, we can see that the proposed scheme 
additionally requires three addition, one multiplication, and 
three absolute operations compared with the traditional 
scheme. It also can be seen from (10) and (11) that the sub-
correlations can be obtained by collecting the correlations 
between the received and local BOC signals over the sub-

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have proposed a novel unambiguous 
acquisition scheme for BOC signals in global navigation 
satellite systems. We have first analyzed the BOC 
autocorrelation function, showing the fact that it is made up 
of the sum of several sub-correlations shaped irregularly and 
which causes the multiple side-peaks of the BOC 
autocorrelation function. Then, we have proposed the 
unambiguous acquisition scheme based on a recombination 
of the sub-correlations. The proposed scheme is applicable to 
generic 
BOCsin
(

kn n  and 
BOCcos
(

kn n  signals, since it 
exploits 
the 
sub-correlations 
inherent 
in 
the 
BOC 
autocorrelation, regardless of the type of the BOC signal (i.e., 
regardless of the value of k ). Finally, it has been observed 
that the proposed scheme removes the side-peaks completely 
for any sine-phased or cosine-phased BOC signal, and that it 
offers a performance improvement over the GRASS and 
traditional BOC schemes in terms of the incorrect acquisition 
probability and MAT.
