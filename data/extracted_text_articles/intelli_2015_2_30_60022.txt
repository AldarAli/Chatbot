INTRODUCTION
Disaster management has become an important task for
every country. For example, in 2012 (an average year in
terms of disasters) we have the following statistics [1]:
•
There were 905 natural catastrophes worldwide,
93% of which were weather-related disasters.
•
Overall costs were US$170 billion and insured
losses $70 billion.
•
45%
were
meteorological
(storms),
36%
were
hydrological (floods),12% were climatological (heat
waves, cold waves, droughts, wildfires) and 7 %
were geophysical events (earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions).
•
Between
1980
and
2011
geophysical
events
accounted for 14% of all natural catastrophes
Figures 1 – 3 [2] show us the trends:
Figure 1. Number of disasters reported between the years 1900-2015.
Figure 2. Number of people (in millions) reported affected by natural
disasters between the years 1900-2015.
Figure 3. Estimated damages (in $US billions) caused by reported
natural disasters between the years 1900-2015.
This problem is a focus for international (The United
Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination - UNDAC
[18]),
regional
(for
example,
Emergency
Response
Coordination Centre European Commission - ERCC [19]),
and national organizations (the majority of countries have a
Ministry of Emergency Situations, or similar).
Information and communications technologies can help
disaster managers quickly access, contextualize, and apply
near
real-time
information,
improving
the
speed
and
effectiveness
of
critical
actions
such
as
warning
the
population at risk – examples of such information and
communications technologies can be found on the web sites

mentioned
above.
In
this
article,
we
focus
on
the
intellectualization of this type of systems.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
exposes the main features of disaster management systems
and the main characteristics of the available information.
Section III provides a description of the technology used for
evaluation and monitoring of complex processes. This
technology allows us to process information that is uncertain,
fragmentary, and variable over time. In conclusion, we
collect pro and contra arguments for the applicability of the
technology for disaster management.
II.
DISASTER MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES
In recent years, the field of disaster studies has emerged
as a new academic field [3] [4] [5]. Specialization in disaster
management includes all three stages (before, during and
after) – risk analysis and contingency planning, management
and coordination during the event, and a disaster recovery
plan. The most important and dangerous type of disasters is
Large
Scale
Sudden
Disasters
(LSSD)
[3].
LSSD
management stages are presented in Figure 4.
Figure 4. LSSD management stages.
The
Remediation
and
Reconstruction
stages
are
controllable
enough,
and
modern
information
and
communications technologies are capable to support these
stages. The Urgent assistance stage is the main challenge
from this point of view. The Urgent Assistance Phase has
maximal uncertainty and maximal importance. We can
single out the following top-5 characteristics for the Urgent
Assistance Phase:
•
Poor forecast – unexpectedness or short time for
preparation
•
Lack of information about the situation – huge
uncertainty
•
Lack of information about the available forces and
resources – huge uncertainty
•
The situation changes very fast – very short time for
decision making
•
High cost for wrong decisions
Based on this characterization, we can assert that the
current status of decision support systems does not allow us
to develop such a system for the Urgent Assistance Phase.
The challenges are:
•
Rationalize
decision
making
for
disaster
preparedness
•
Provide a base for vulnerability assessment and
priority setting
•
Provide monitoring and control for the Urgent
Assistance Phase
o
Time pressure
o
Uncertainty
o
Fast changes
III.
TECHNOLOGY FOR EVALUATION AND MONITORING
OF COMPLEX PROCESSES
Systems for Evaluation and Monitoring of Complex
Processes (SEM) relate to a class of hierarchical fuzzy
discrete dynamic systems. The theoretical base of such class
of systems is made by the fuzzy sets theory, discrete
mathematics, methods of the analysis of hierarchies which
was developed by Zadeh [16] [17], Messarovich [7], Saaty
[15] and others. SEM process uniformly diverse, multi-level,
fragmentary, unreliable, and varying in time information
about complex processes. Based on this type of information,
SEM monitor the process’ evolution and work out strategic
plans of process development. These capabilities open a
broad
area
of
applications
in
business
(marketing,
management, strategic planning), socio-political problems
(elections, control of bilateral and multilateral agreements,
terrorism), etc. One of such applications is a system for
monitoring
and
evaluating
a
state’s
nuclear
activities
(department of safeguards, International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA)) [8]. This application is briefly described in
this article.
A.
Basic elements of SEM and their characteristics
The basic elements of SEM at the top level are the
information space, in which information about the state of
the process circulates, and the expert(s) who are working
with this information and making conclusions about the state
of the process and forecasts of its development (Figure 5).
Figure 5. Basic elements of SEM.
The information space represents a set of various
information elements, which can be characterized as follows:
•
Diversity
of
the
information
carriers,
i.e.,
presentation of the information in the articles,
newspapers, computer
kind, audio- and
video-
information, etc.;
•
Fragmentary. The information most often related to
any fragment of a problem, and the different
fragments may be differently "covered" with the
information;

INTELLI 2015 : he Fourth International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Applications

•
Multi-levels of the information. The information can
concern the whole problem, some of its parts, or a
particular element of the process;
•
Various degree of reliability. The information can
contain the particular data which has a various
degree
of
reliability,
indirect
data,
results
of
conclusions on the basis of the reliable information
or indirect conclusions;
•
Possible discrepancy. The information from various
sources
can
coincide,
differ
slightly
or
be
contradictory;
•
Varying in time. The process develops over time,
therefore, the information about the same element
can be different between two different moments in
time;
•
Possible
bias.
The
information
reflects
certain
interests of the source of the information; therefore it
can have tendentious character.
The experts are an active element of the monitoring
system and, observing
and
studying
elements
of the
information space, they draw conclusions about the state of
the process and prospects of its development taking into
account the properties listed above about the information
space.
B.
Basic principles of technology for evaluation and
monitoring of complex processes
Systems for evaluation and monitoring of complex
processes allow:
•
to
process
uniformly
diverse,
multi-level,
fragmentary, unreliable, information varying in time;
•
to receive evaluations of status of the whole process
and/or its particular aspects;
•
to simulate various situations in the subject area;
•
to reveal "critical ways" of the development of the
process. This means to reveal those elements of the
problem, the small changes that may qualitatively
change the status of the process as a whole.
Taking into account the given features of the information
and specific methods of its processing, it is possible to
declare the main features of the technology as follows:
•
The system provides the facility for taking into
account data conveyed by different information
vehicles
(journals,
video
clips,
newspapers,
documents in electronic form, etc.). Such a facility is
provided by means of storage in a database of a
system of references to an evaluated piece of
information, if it is not a document in electronic
form. If the information is a document in electronic
form, then both the evaluated information (or part
thereof) and a reference thereto are stored in the
system. Thus, the system makes it possible to take
into account and use in an analysis all pieces of
information, which have a relationship to the subject
area irrespective of the information vehicle.
•
The system makes it possible to process fragmentary
information. For this purpose, a considerable part of
the model is represented in the form of a tree/graph
(Figure 6).
Figure 6. Structure of process model.
•
Information with different degrees of reliability,
some of it possibly tendentious, can be processed in
the system. This is achieved by assessing the
influence of a particular piece of information on the
status of the elements of the model using fuzzy
linguistic values.
•
Time is one of the parameters of the system. This
makes it possible to have a complete picture of the
variation of the status of the model with time.
The summary of the information processing in SEM is
presented in Figure 7.
Figure 7. SEM workflow.
Thus, the systems constructed on the basis of this
technology
allow
having
the
model
of
the
process
developing in time. It is supported by the references to all
information materials, chosen by the analysts, with general
and separate evaluations of the status of the process. Using
the time as one of the parameters of the system allows to
conduct the retrospective analysis and to build the forecasts
of development of the process. There is the opportunity of
allocation "of critical points", i.e., which are element(s) of
the model for which a small change can cause significant
changes in the status of the whole process. The knowledge of
such elements has large practical significance and allows to
reveal "critical points" of the process, to work out the
measures on blocking out undesirable situations or work
towards
the
achievement
of
desirable
situations,
i.e.,
somewhat operate the development of the process in time in
the desirable direction.

C.
Theoretical Basis
For effective practical application of the proposed
technological solution, it is necessary to tackle a series of
theoretical problems, the results of which are given below.
It is assumed that the expert describes the degree of
inconsistency of the obtained information (for example, the
readiness or potential for readiness of certain processes in a
country [8]) in the form of linguistic values. The subjective
degree of convenience of such a description depends on the
selection and the composition of such linguistic values. Let
us explain this on a model example.
Example [8]. Let it be required to evaluate the quantity
of plutonium. Let us consider two extreme situations.
Situation 1.
It is permitted to use only two values:
“small” and “considerable quantity”.
Situation 2.
It is permitted to use many values: “very
small”, “not very considerable quantity”, ..., “not small and
not considerable quantity”, ..., “considerable quantity”.
Situation 1 is inconvenient. In fact, for many situations
both the permitted values may be unsuitable and, in
describing them, we select between two “bad” values.
Situation 2 is also inconvenient. In fact, in describing a
specific quantity of nuclear material, several of the permitted
values may be suitable. We again experience a problem but
now due to the fact that we are forced to select between two
or more “good” values. Could a set of linguistic values be
optimal in this case?
It is assumed that the system tracks the development of
the problem, i.e., its variation with time. It is also assumed
that it integrates the evaluations of different experts. This
means that one object may be described by different experts.
Therefore it is desirable to have assurances that the different
experts describe one and the same object in the most
“uniform” way.
On the basis of the above, we may formulate the first
problem as follows:
Problem 1.
Is it possible, taking into account certain
features of the man’s perception of objects of the real world
and their description, to formulate a rule for selection of the
optimum set of values of characteristics on the basis of
which these objects may be described? Two optimality
criteria are possible:
Criterion 1.
We regard as optimum those sets of values
through
whose
use
man
experiences
the
minimum
uncertainty in describing objects.
Criterion 2.
If the object is described by a certain
number of experts, then we regard as optimum those sets of
values which provide the minimum degree of divergence of
the descriptions.
It is shown that we can formulate a method of selecting
the
optimum
set
of
values
of
qualitative
indications
(collection of granules [10]). Moreover, it is shown that such
a method is stable, i.e., the natural small errors that may
occur in constructing the membership functions do not have
a significant influence on the selection of the optimum set of
values. The sets which are optimal according to criteria 1 and
2 coincide. The results obtained are described in [12].
Following this method, we may describe objects with
minimum possible uncertainty, i.e., guarantee optimum
operation of the SEM from this point of view.
Technology for evaluation and monitoring of complex
processes assumes the storage of information material (or
references to it) and their linguistic evaluations in the system
database. In this connection the following problem arises.
Problem 2.
Is it possible to define the indices of
quality
of
information
retrieval
in
fuzzy
(linguistic)
databases and to formulate a rule for the selection of such a
set of linguistic values, the use of which would provide the
maximum indices of quality of information retrieval?
In [12] was shown that it is possible to introduce indices
of the quality of information retrieval in fuzzy (linguistic)
databases and to formalize them. In [13] was shown that it is
possible to formulate a method of selecting the optimum set
of values of qualitative indications (collection of granules
[13]) which provides the maximum quality indices of
information retrieval. Moreover, in [12] [13] was shown that
such a method is stable, i.e., the natural small errors in the
construction of the membership functions do not have a
significant effect on the selection of the optimum set of
values. This proves that the offered methods can be used in
practical tasks and can guarantee optimum work of SEMs.
Because the model of the process has a hierarchical
structure, the choice and selection (tuning) of aggregation
operators for the nodes of the model is one more important
issue in the development of SEM. We may formulate this
problem as follows:
Problem 3. Is it possible to propose the procedures of
information aggregation in fuzzy hierarchical dynamic
systems which allow us to minimize inconsistency in the
model of process in SEM?
It is shown that it is possible to propose the following
approaches based on different interpretations of aggregation
operators: geometrical, logical, and learning-based. The last
one includes leaning based on genetic algorithms and
learning based on neural networks. These approaches are
described in detail in [11].
D.
Application’s features
Some applied information monitoring systems based on
the technology described above has been developed. Based
on this experience, we can formulate the following necessary
stages of the development process:
•
conceptual design;
•
development of the demonstration prototype;
•
development of a prototype of the system and its
operational testing;
•
development of the final system.
The most difficult point in the development process is the
elaboration of the structure of the process model. In some
well-developed
areas
(marketing,
medicine),
we
used
descriptions of the process from professional books and
references (like [6]) as a draft of the model. We then
coordinated
this
draft
with
the
professional
experts
(conceptual design and development of the demonstration
prototype stages), and “tuned” this improved draft during
testing of the system (development of a prototype stage).
Sometimes the process for monitoring is formalized enough
29

for application of information monitoring technology. An
example of this situation is a state nuclear program
evaluation procedure in IAEA [8]. The previously developed
physical model of the nuclear fuel cycle was a good base for
the model of the process in SEM. Based on this model, a
prototype of the information monitoring system has been
developed.
In order to develop a SEM for disaster management
purposes, we need to develop the model of the process. The
current status of the model is a result of the Mitigation
Preparedness stage (Figure 4). We can understand the level
of our readiness for disasters and our weak points (critical
paths) for any time (in particular, for disaster momentum).
Using critical paths, we can “calculate” the impact of
different actions to the level of our readiness for disasters.
After LSSD starts (urgent assistance stage) we can organize
our work in the most effective and efficient manner because
we have the actual status of our preparedness (from the
previous stage). We can easily input changes into the
situation, and see the result of those actions as a new
situation.
The application of the technology for evaluation and
monitoring of complex processes for one of the task in
disaster management is presented in [14] (Case Study Risk-
based evaluation Bridge under Flooding).
IV.
CONCLUSION
Effective disaster management is an important task for all
countries, regions, and the planet as a whole. The most
dangerous disasters are large scale sudden disasters. For
LSSD, the most important stage is the urgent assistance
phase. Due to huge uncertainty and time pressure we cannot
use
standard
information
technologies
for
effectively
supporting the analysts and decision makers during this
stage. In this article, we have discussed an idea to use
technology for evaluation and monitoring of complex
processes for this stage. We have presented examples of
successful applications of technology in similar areas (in
terms of features of the available information).
SEMs are solving evaluation and monitoring task, allow
user input of all available information in a “natural manner”
and capable of:
•
saving the history of process development,
•
evaluating current status,
•
modeling the future of process development.
SEMs are effective when:
•
we do not have (cannot develop) a mathematical
model of the process in the form of equations,
automatas, etc.
•
we have experts who are performing monitoring
task.
We can develop SEM with minimal requirements for the
task, when:
•
it is possible to develop “semantic model” of the
process in the form of set of concepts and their inter-
dependencies
•
we work with real information (we can learn or tune
the system)
We can develop an optimal system in terms of:
•
how easy it is for the user to input information
(expert, analyst)
•
co-ordination
of
estimations
of
users
(experts,
analysts)
•
information
support
of
processes
of
input
information and modeling.
The capabilities described in this article represent useful
information for disasters management centers.
