Abstract— Spot-welding is widely used to assemble parts, 
such as those of vehicle bodies. To control the quality, 
safety and productivity of industrial products, a quick 
and accurate method of inspecting spot-weld is required.  
In our previous research, we reported an analysis 
method of examining the strength of spot welded parts 
by eddy current test (ETC) using a wide range of 
frequencies from high to low. In this paper, we report a 
method of analyzing the internal structure of a spot-weld. 
Magnetic field change showed a good correlation with 
the destructive shear test to check joint strength. The 
depth profile of the welded part was obtained by 
changing the skin depth using a wide range of 
frequencies. As the magnetic field strength at each 
frequency was not constant, they were normalized to 
create the depth profile. The two-dimensional depth 
profile was obtained by line scanning, and the three-
dimensional depth profile was obtained by surface 
scanning. The three-dimensional internal structure of 
the 
welded 
part, 
which 
is 
nugget-shaped, 
was 
constructed from the volume rendering of the three-
dimensional map, and it correlated with the shape 
obtained by cross-sectional observation.

 INTRODUCTION  
Spot-welding is widely used to assemble parts, such as 
vehicle bodies, where thin metal sheets are joined by 
thousands of spot-welds. In general, the quality of the spot-
welds is evaluated by destructive testing of a selected sample. 
The correlation between weld strength and nugget size has 
already been established. To confirm nugget size, 
observation of a cross section is effective [1] [2] [3]. 
However, destructive testing methods are not applied to all 
products, and are costly and time consuming. To ensure that 
all spot-welded products are high quality, a nondestructive 
testing method is desired. The eddy current test (ETC) of the 
magnetic method is a convenient, low-cost nondestructive 
test. However, its application is limited to surface inspection 
because its high frequency has shallow skin depth 
penetration [4] [5] [6]. Recently, our group reported two 
methods: an eddy current test (ECT) using a wide range of 
frequencies and a magnetic flux leakage test (MFL) using 
detection of the magnetic flux leakage from the surface of 
the sample when a low frequency magnetic flux was induced 
[7] [8]. In this paper, we report a method of analyzing 
welded parts by ETC using a wide range of frequencies. A 
spot-welded three-layer steel sheet, which is the same as that 
used in a real automobile body, was used as the test sample.  
Section II describes structure of sample and experimental 
procedure. Section III describes the result and discussion. 
Finally, Section IV addresses the conclusion.

EXPERIMENTAL 
As shown in Figure 1, the measurement system using 
ETC developed in this study consists of an oscillator, a 
current source for the induction coil, an induction coil and 
detection coil with ferrite core, a lock-in amplifier, X-Y 
stage, and a PC. These coils are composed of a ferrite core of 
4.8 mm in diameter, a detection coil of 200 turns, and an 
induction coil of 50 turns. The pair of induction coil and 
detection coil with ferrite core is located near the sample 
surface. The induction coils are operated at 0.3 A (peak-to-
peak) sine waveform generated from the current source with 
frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 10 kHz.  
The measurement method in this study is shown below. 
The sine waveform that is generated by the oscillator is 
applied to the current source. An AC current of 0.3 A (peak-
to-peak) was applied to the induction coil generating a 
magnetic field. The secondary magnetic field that occurred 
on the surface of the sample was measured using the 
detection coil. Then, the signal was detected as the magnetic 
field intensity and phase component by a lock-in amplifier. 
To obtain the magnetic field distribution above the spot weld, 
the detection coil scans two-dimensionally. Scanning is 
performed by a XY stage.  
The samples used in this study were three spot-welded 
steel plates of Strength Steel (SS) (40 mm × 200 mm × 0.7 
mm), High Tensile Strength Steel (HTSS) (40 mm x 120 mm 
x 1.2 mm), and High Tensile Strength Steel (HTSS) (40 mm 
x 120 mm x 1.2 mm), as shown in Figure 2. Several samples 
with different spot-weld conditions were prepared by 
changing the number of cycles (5，10，15，20) for the 
total weld time. One cycle time is the inverse of the 
commercial power source frequency. Samples were 
classified as good quality products when the weld time was 
long. However, samples were classified as defective products 
when the weld time was insufficient. To observe the weld 
nugget structure, samples were cut by a cutting machine, and 
the cross section of the spot-weld part was observed by an 
optical microscope. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
First, we measured the magnetic field at the centerline of 
the welded part. Scanning was performed at 1-mm intervals 
by moving the induction and detection coil with ferrite core. 
Figure 3 illustrates the relation between the total weld time 
and the magnetic field strength measured at 10 kHz. 
According to the increments of cycle time, which means the 
increment of welding time, the magnetic field strength 
change around the weld position increased. The magnetic 
field change was considered to be caused by the difference in 
the nugget size leading to different permeability. 
Next, the depth profile was imaged by the line scanned 
magnetic field change measured at several frequencies. The 
induction coils are operated in the frequency range from 10 
Hz to 10 kHz. The results are shown in Figure 4. The 
magnetic field intensity at each frequency is not equal as 
explained by Faraday’s law; therefore, the values obtained at 
each frequency was normalized. The value of the color scale 
in Figure 4 shows the normalized value that was the ratio of 
the magnetic field strength at each point and that at the non-
weld position which is the average at both ends of measured 
area (position of 0 and 9 mm). Although the Y-axis in Figure 
4 is frequency, this indicate the depth information. This is 
because the skin depth δ is defined as follows.

where μ is the permeability of the specimen and σ is the 
conductivity of the specimen. The δ is inversely proportional 
to the square root of the frequency f. This equation means 
that the magnetic field obtained by applying high frequency 
indicates the information near the surface and that obtained 
by applying low frequency indicates that information not 
only the surface but also inside in the specimen. The amount 
of change is low in the surface area which corresponds to the 
top of the image; the amount of change is large in the deep 
area which is at the bottom of the image. It indicates that a 
nugget with different permeability was generated inside the 
plates. In addition, as the cycle time and weld time decreased, 
the amount of change and size decreased. Therefore, the two 
dimensional mappings shown in Figure 4 represent the 
internal structure of spot weld. 
To create a three-dimensional mapping of internal 
structure, we measured the magnetic field at the area of 
10×10 mm around the weld in the frequency range from 10 
Hz to 10 kHz. Surface scanning was performed at 1-mm 
intervals. To obtain volume rendering of the nugget, an 
arbitrary threshold of normalized value was set at 0.94 and 
this threshold was adopted for each two-dimensional image. 
The measured result of three-dimensional image is shown in 
Figure 5. The measurement positions are x and y axis and z 
axis shows the frequency. The three-dimensional depth 
profile denotes the shape of the welds and its size depended 
on the cycle time. Thus, this three-dimensional image 
reflects the shape change inside the spot weld caused by 
different cycle times and non-destructive evaluation of 
internal structure for spot weld is proposed. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
We developed an analysis and visualization method for 
the internal structure of a spot-weld by ECT. The depth 
profile of the welded part was obtained by usage of multiple 
frequencies. Furthermore, a three-dimensional nugget shape 
was constructed by volume rendering of the three-
dimensional depth profile. The magnetically measured data 
is correlated with the optically observed structure.
