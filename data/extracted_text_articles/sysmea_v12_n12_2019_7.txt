Abstract—In the last years, the risk to become a victim of a gun 
fight or to be involved into an amok situation increased. This 
leads to a higher demand for ballistic protection of civilians. 
Therefore, another capability profile for ballistic armor is 
necessary, compared to the military or police sector. The focal 
point of civil ballistic armor is wearing comfort, weight and 
invisibility. This paper provides information about the 
development of flexible and lightweight ballistic body armor. 
The manufacturing process is showed, heat- and sag test are 
presented. Different ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene 
(UHMWPE) composites, in this case made by Dyneema®, are 
compared by using ballistic tests and will be discussed below. In 
this test series Dyneema® hard ballistic (HB) 26, HB50 and soft 
ballistic (SB) 115 is used. Aim of the project is to create a 
ballistic body armor, which is flexible, and body fit enough to be 
worn under a sweater or suit. Furthermore, the body armor 
should meet the fourth level of ballistic protection of the 
"Association of test laboratories for bullet resistant materials 
and constructions" (VPAM 4) as well as the requirements of the 
VPAM ballistic protection vests (BSW). The idea can be realized 
by using an UHMWPE composite. A material with well-
balanced properties to fulfill the ballistic and mechanical 
requirements, simultaneously providing the necessary wearing 
comfort.  
Keywords - defense engineering; ballistic body armor; fiber-
reinforced plastics; ballistic trials; material processing. 
I. INTRODUCTION  
Based on the findings in [1] this article provides further 
ballistic trials. These trails are evaluated and first series 
relevant findings are achieved. 
Personal integrity is a basic need. Nowadays, this need is 
endangered by increased incidents relating to gun violence. 
Especially in the USA, the number of incidents rises from 
about 50,000 to over 60,000 between 2014 and 2017 [2]. This 
leads to a higher need for personal ballistic protection at the 
civilian markets. Included are products like soft-ballistic 
sweater inlays or discrete ballistic vest, which are suitable for 
everyday life. In this area of use weight, wearing comfort and 
invisibility are focal points. The ballistic protection up to the 
fourth level of ballistic protection of the "Association of test 
laboratories for bullet resistant materials and constructions" 
(VPAM 4) has to be ensured. These requirements make it 
necessary to use a material, which combines high tensile 
strength for a high ballistic performance and low density for 
a suitable weight balance. These attributes are combined in 
many fiber reinforced composite materials, especially ultra-
high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is well 
suited for the mentioned application. Already existing 
analyses of the ballistic behavior of UHMWPE, like in [3] or 
[4] described, are often on a theoretical level. This paper aims 
for an analysis on an applied level, with a concrete connection 
to a product development. Existing theoretical results are 
applied to the development of an actual ballistic vest. This 
leads to the overall aim of the project to create a flexible and 
lightweight ballistic vest, which meet the VPAM 4 
regulations and can be worn under everyday clothes. 
Therefore, the project is divided into five sections: 
1. Material processing  
(Section IV); 
2. Material pre-testing  
(Section V); 
3. Pre-ballistic testing  
(Section VI); 
4. Ballistic testing   
(Section VII); 
5. Finalization 
  
(future work). 
This paper aims to provide data to derive a decision about the 
material composition, which is used for the finalization. The 
decision should be especially based on the results of the 
ballistic testing, mentioned in Section VII. 
The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, 
preliminary considerations are introduced regarding material, 
processing and shape of the test objects. Section III gives a 
brief information about the different used UHMWPE prepreg 
materials and the second matrix material. Section IV is about 
the processing of ballistic plates namely cutting and 
lamination process. In Section V, heat resistance test and sag 
test are presented and discussed. In Section VI, the pre-
ballistic test, which includes VPAM 3 (third level of ballistic 
protection of the "Association of test laboratories for bullet 
resistant materials and constructions") and VPAM 4 testing, 
is described and evaluated. Section VII is about the ballistic 
test. It includes the basic testing of the newly used materials 
and further, a comparative ballistic test to show the 
differences (in contrast) to the pre-ballistic test. The final 
section, Section VIII, merges all results and, these results are 
discussed, leading to the constructive design of the plates. 
II. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS 
In the beginning of the project two questions occur: 
• 
Which material is suitable for the project (ballistic 
performance and weight)? 
• 
How can it be processed to become a flexible ballistic 
plate?  
First thoughts about the material leads to the UHMWPE in 
detail Dyneema® HB26. This material, in shape of hard-

63

ballistic-plates, was successfully tested in previous ballistic 
trails. The plates were made of multiple layer of pre-
impregnated fiber (prepreg) material, which are fused under 
a certain pressure and temperature to become a solid ballistic 
plate. These ballistic trails have already been reported in [4]. 
This type of HB26 plates have an inflexible structure, 
making them unsuitable for this project of soft-ballistic-
plates. On the other hand, the material shows a good ratio 
between weight and ballistic performance. In detail, areal 
density of the material is between 257 – 271 g/m² [5] and has 
an energy absorption per areal density of ~35 J∙m2/kg [5].  
Nowadays, newer materials are available, like the 
improved Dyneema® HB50 or the Dyneema® SB115. The 
HB50 is an enhanced HB26. The basic design is consistent, 
but the areal density is lower (226 – 240 g/m²) and the 
ballistic properties of the material have to be checked and 
compared in Section VII [6]. SB115 is a prepreg material, 
consisting of UHMWPE fibers. This material is especially 
produced for flexible and lightweight body armor 
applications, due to the very low areal density (75 – 84 g/m²) 
and notably flexible matrix material [7]. In Section III the 
mechanical properties of these materials are explained in 
detail to enhance the awareness for the material. 
Relating to the second initial question, Dyneema® HB26 
provides a promising starting point, because this basic 
prepreg already offers a flexible structure. Therefore, the 
prepreg material only needs a second flexible matrix material 
to hold the prepreg layers together. Due to this, a lamination 
process by hand is selected, which makes it possible to use a 
flexible cast resin. This leads to the question, which kind of 
cast resin has to be used as a second matrix material. It has to 
be considered that, firstly, the cast resin does not destroy the 
chemical basic structure of the prepreg material and secondly, 
the cast resin remains flexible. To ensure this chemical 
compatibility of the second matrix material the same matrix 
material, like it is used for the prepreg, is chosen. For that 
reason, a polyurethane (PUR) determines the second matrix 
material. This is selected out of the group of thermoplastic 
elastomers (TPE) [5]. Under the aspect of flexibility, a cast 
resin out of PUR with special flexible properties is chosen. A 
further description of the second matrix material is given in 
Section IIID. 
Beside the material, also the shape of the plates is 
important for the ballistic performance. This is, because of 
the anisotropic properties, which are described in Section 
IIIA. In this case, the shape was predetermined, because the 
plates have to fit into already existing structures. Relating to 
the standard size of a plate carrier inlay, plates were produced 
in a size of 300 mm x 250 mm. Furthermore, patterns for a 
sweatshirt inlay were used to evaluate the behavior of the 
different shapes in a ballistic trail. The main body pattern has 
a width of 435 mm and a total height of 415 mm (Figure 1). 
The side body pattern is narrower and has a width of 150 mm 
and a height of 205 mm (Figure 2) [1]. 
III. USED MATERIALS 
The basic material for the development of the flexible 
plates is UHMWPE prepreg material. A prepreg material is 
fiber composite material where the fibers are already 
combined with the matrix material. Various numbers of 
sublayers are implemented into a prepreg. 
 
Figure 1. Main body pattern out of Dyneema® HB26. Width of 435 mm 
and a total height of 415 mm. 
 
Figure 2. Side body pattern out of Dyneema® HB26. Width of 150 mm and 
a total height of 205 mm. 
In this case Dyneema® HB26, HB50 and SB115 is used 
as a main material. As mentioned in Section II, the second 
matrix material is a flexible PUR. 
A. Dyneema® HB26 
It is shipped in a shape of a tape and as such, the matrix 
and fiber have already combined to a prepreg. The fibers are 
out of UHMWPE and the matrix out of PUR. The prepreg 
material consists of four sublayers of UHMWPE fibers, 
which are bidirectional orientated. The fiber direction per 
sublayer is turned by 90°, compared with the previous layer. 
This achieves an equal force dissipation in the prepreg 
material. Resulting from this structure, different geometric 
shapes of the material have anisotropic tensile properties, 
because of unequal fiber length.  
The prepreg material has a density of approximately 0.85 
g/cm3, due to a martial thickness of 0.3mm. UHMWPE fibers 
have a high molecular weight. Commonly they have an 
Intrinsic Viscosity (IV) from 8 IV up to 30 IV. The fiber

achieves high tensile strength (between 3.21 GPa and 5.99 
GPa) and initial modulus (between 113GPa and 171 GPa) 
through long molecular chains out of methylene groups 
(CH2). A characteristic of UHMWPE is that the intra 
molecular bounds are relative weak Van der Waals bounds. 
Though, the extreme long molecule chains leading to a 
significant overlap between the molecule chains. This results 
in many inter molecular Van der Waals bounds, which 
strengthen the overall intermolecular stability. Further 
developments have to consider that the fiber length is one of 
the most important constructional attributes, because of the 
link to the tensile strength of the material [8]. 
The matrix material of the prepreg has multiple tasks. 
Firstly, to protect the fiber against environmental conditions, 
pressure and kinks. Secondly, to hold the fibers in their 
position and direction. Finally, the matrix leads the forces 
into the fibers. Matrix material is often chosen from the group 
of thermoplastic elastomers, because of moldability and high 
elongation at break. These are good properties to support the 
fibers and the construction [1].  
B. Dyneema® HB50 
This UHMWPE material is an improved HB26 with the 
same basic physics. Also, the mechanical properties, 
especially the tensile strength (between 3.21 GPa and 5.99 
GPa) and initial modulus (between 113GPa and 171 GPa), 
are the in same range as HB26. Section VII shows that these 
two mechanical properties of HB50 are (slightly) better than 
those of HB26, due to the improved ballistic results. It is quite 
possible that the tensile strength and initial modulus of HB50 
is located in the upper area of the mentioned range. With 
0.753 g/cm3 HB50 has also a lower density compared to 
HB26 [6]. 
C. Dyneema® SB115 
Dyneema® SB 115 is also a UHMWPE based fiber 
reinforced composite material. It is specially designed for soft 
armor applications, due to its flexible and soft matrix material 
and low areal density of 75 – 84 g/m². The prepreg material 
consist of two sublayers which are bidirectional orientated 
(0°, 90°), thus it is a cross ply. Additionally, the whole 
prepreg is covered with a coating, to protect the prepreg 
material against environmental damages, like chemicals and 
water [7]. Overall, one layer of the material has a thickness 
of 0.2 mm. This leads to a density of approximately 0.375 
g/cm3. The SB 115 consists of the fiber SK99. This fiber has 
a tensile stretch of 3.5 % and a tensile strength of 3.92 GPa. 
This high strength is based on the so called “Dyneema® 
Force Multiplier Technology” [9]. 
D. Cast Resin System - Second Matrix Material 
The most important requirement for second matrix 
material is to preserve the flexibility of the prepreg. 
Therefore, the second matrix material has also to be flexible. 
As mentioned in Section II, the flexible PUR called R15GB-
flex was selected. This material is a two-components cast 
resin system, consisting out of resin and hardener. With a 
mixing ratio of 100 parts resin and 25 parts hardener a Shore 
hardness (A) of ~40 is achievable. Compared with normal 
PUR cast resin systems, which have a Shore hardness (D) of 
~65 (comparable to a Shore hardness (A) of ~105), the used 
PUR has a softer texture [10]. Another important property is 
the density of the second matrix material to keep a low overall 
weight. The material R15GB-flex has a density of 1.1 g/cm3, 
comparable with the density of the prepreg material. The 
material has in mixed condition a medium viscosity and a 
processing time of approximately 15 min (100 g at 20 °C). 
These properties make the material suitable for the 
lamination process by hand. The maximum usage 
temperature is around 50 °C [8]. This fact will further be 
discussed in Section V [1]. 
IV. PROCESSING 
The processing of the ballistic plates is divided into two 
stages: 
• 
Cutting process for semi-finished parts;  
• 
Lamination process for the finished composite 
material. 
This will only be presented in detail for the plates, which 
were constructed for pre-tests and pre-ballistic test (Table I). 
The processing procedure for the plates used in the ballistic 
test are the same and can be abstracted. An overview of these 
plates is given in Table II. 
A. Cutting Process 
This project stage needs two patterns. First of all, the 
standard plate carrier inlay with rectangular, plane shape and 
dimensions of 300 mm x 250 mm. For the testing procedures 
one 5-layer, two 10-layer, one 15-layer and two 20-layer 
plates are produced (Table I). Overall, 80 layers of prepreg 
material in this shape are necessary. 
Furthermore, patterns for a sweatshirt inlay, with a main 
body part (Figure 1) and side part (Figure 2) are used. On the 
whole, 30 main body part layers and 15 side part layers are 
produced (Table I). 
The lamination process by hand makes it necessary to 
laminate every single layer. In this particular case, a fast-
laser-cutting-process is unsuitable, because the individual 
layers would melt together. A single layer cut with the laser 
cutter is as well inefficient, due to the rectangular shape. For 
that reason, every layer has to be cut out by a special scissor 
for reinforced fibers. 
To achieve a high precision, the more complex shapes of 
the sweatshirt patterns are cut by the laser. The patterns are 
replicated in a computer-aided design (CAD) program and 
saved as drawing exchange format (DXF) file. Lastly, the file 
is exported into the laser cutter program and executed 
(parameters: Power 120 W, frequency 1000 Hz, velocity 
0.036 m/s). Due to the four-sublayer structure of the prepreg 
material, a homogeneous sublayer structure is achievable 
even without rotation between the prepreg layers [1]. 
B. Lamination Process 
The hand lamination process requires following stages:  
• 
Mixing; 
• 
Coating; 
• 
Hardening process.

In the mixing process, the mixing ratio is adjusted by the 
proportion of weight. For a low Shore hardness (A) the 
manufacturer recommends a mixing ratio of 100 parts resin 
and 25 parts of hardener. Proportion of weight of the two 
components, which is necessary for the different plate sizes, 
are shown in Table III. The two components are mixed with 
a wooden stick to a homogenous mixture. This mixture is 
equal spread over the prepreg layer with a lamination brush. 
For the coating, a slight film is sufficient. Pressure from the 
inside to the outside is applied to get a compact compound.

Finally, surplus material is removed, and the plates are 
laid into a warm place for 24 h for hardening. After the 
hardening process, the plates are inherently stable [1]. 
V. HEAT AND SAG TEST 
Besides the ballistic performance, further two primary 
material attributes of the new composite material have to be 
tested. Firstly, the heat stability in a heat test, because of 
possible high surface temperatures in area of use. Secondly, 
the flexibility of the material, as key functionality in a sag 
test. 
Because of the nearly equal mechanical properties of 
HB26 and HB50, these tests were skipped for HB50 and will 
be done in future work. Based on the ballistic results, these 
tests will not be conducted for SB115. 
A. Heat Test 
Heat is a weak point of the second matrix material, due to 
its thermoplastic properties. Maximum temperature of usage 
is around 50 °C according to the manufacturer. Analyses of 
the possible area of use show that the average temperatures 
are moderate temperatures between 10 °C and 30 °C, which 

66

are unproblematic for the composite material. Nevertheless, 
in desert areas, which are possible areas of use, surface 
temperatures can reach a maximum around 70 °C and daily 
surface temperatures around 60 °C [11]. To test the heat 
resistance of the composite material, one plate is faced a heat 
test. 
The heat test proceeds as follows: an oven is preheated to 
a temperature of 30 °C. This 30 °C stage is used as a reference 
result. Every 30 min the temperature is set to a new value, 
first 50 °C, then 60 °C and finally 70 °C. The plate is left in 
the oven for 30 min. After 15 min and 30 min the plate is 
taken out and checked regarding: degeneration, flexibility, 
slip of layers and defects. A 5-layer plate (Plate No. 6) is 
chosen to ensure an even temperature distribution in material. 
Results are displayed in Table IV. 
The results show that the composite material, and 
especially the second matrix material withstand temperatures 
up to 50 °C without any property changes. At higher 
temperatures above 50 °C an increased flexibility is 
recognizable. After 30 min at 70 °C the layers of prepreg are 
movable 3 mm against each other. After this movement, the 
layers go back to their initial state. At all temperature stages 
the plate shows no degeneration and defects. Following a 
cooling phase, the second matrix material solidified again. 
Summing up, the higher temperatures are uncritical to the 
composite material [1]. 
B. Sag Test  
Flexibility is a key attribute of the used type of ballistic 
protection. Comparative values of the plate flexibility can be 
generated through a sag test. The aim of this test is to measure 
the sag of the plate under a certain load. 
Therefore, a test procedure is created. The test setup is 
shown in Figure 3. The plates are laid onto two bars with a 
contact area of 10 mm x 250 mm on both sides. Moreover, 
the basic test setup consists of two rulers and a wooden 
baseplate (35 mm x 145mm), which are arranged as in Figure 
3 shown. The sag test was conducted at 22 °C. 
As a result of this arrangement, a basic load of 72.8 g lays 
up on the plate. Additionally, a 500 g block is used as a test 
weight. The center of the wooden baseplate is positioned in 
the middle of the plate at 150 mm x 125 mm.

Figure 3. Sag test basic test setup with test weight. 
One ruler is placed for measurements and the other as an 
indicator for it. The zero height is 120 mm. 
First, the initial height of the plate is measured. In this 
phase the plate has an additional load of 72.8 g. After 30 sec 
under these conditions, the height is measured.  
Subsequently, the plate is loaded with test weight. After 
10 sec under these conditions, the height is measured again. 
Results are displayed in Table V. The results show that 20-
layer plates have deficits in their sag values and thus in the 
overall flexibility.  
They may be too inflexible for this particular application 
area. The 15-layer plate has a good ratio between number of 
layers and flexibility, compared with the 10-layer plate [1]. 
VI. PRE-BALLISTIC TEST  
The pre-ballistic test is performed on the basis of the 
VPAM ("Association of test laboratories for bullet resistant 
materials 
and 
constructions") 
regulations. 
Especially 
following regulations are regarded: general basis for ballistic 
material, construction and product testing (APR) [12], 
ballistic protective vests (BSW) [13] and bullet resistant plate 
materials (PM) [14]. 
The aim of this project is to meet the regulations of 
VPAM 4. This level requires that the plate withstand a 
penetration of a .357 Mag. fired with a projectile velocity of 
430 ± 10 m/s from 5 m distance [12]. A ballistic placement 
test provides an overview of the ballistic performance of the 
composite material. Therefore, a modified VPAM 3 (9 mm, 
415 ± 10 m/s, 5m) and VPAM 4 level is tested.

The shooting distance is increased to 10 m. Penetration and 
back face deformation are evaluated. Based on VPAM BSW 
No. 4.2 a maximal transmitted energy of 70 J is acceptable 
[13]. 
A. Preparation and Test Setup 
Two components are necessary for the test setup: 
shooting-box and plasticine (Figure 4). The shooting box is 
built in consideration of the VPAM BSW [13]. The inner 
dimensions of the shooting-box are 300 mm width, 250 mm 
height and 150 mm depth. Especially the characteristic depth 
is important, because of compression effects with the rear 
panel. Based on the VPAM PM contact areas of 30 mm on 
three sides are built in [14]. The used plasticine is 
recommended by VPAM (VPAM BSW No. 5.2) [13]. The 
ballistic test is conducted at an ambient temperature of 21 °C. 
A measurement of the plasticity is conducted as described 
in VPAM BSW No. 5.2.1. The mean imprint depth (dm) of 
the plasticine is 19.8 mm. With this value and the maximal 
transmitted energy (Emax) of 70 J, the maximal volume (Vmax) 
of the back-face deformation is calculated as shown in (1) 
[12]. 
 
Vmax = (0.134 ∙  dm −  1.13) ∙  Emax 
() 
Using the values of the mean imprint (19.8 mm) and maximal 
transmitted energy (70 J) in (1) leads to (2). 
 
Vmax = (0.134 ∙ 19.8 − 1.13) ∙ 70 = 106  
() 
This leads to a maximal back-face deformation volume of 
106 cm3.  
The gun, which is used for VPAM 3 testing is a SIG Sauer 
X-Five® with a 9 mm Luger 124 Gr. projectile. For the 
VPAM 4 testing an S&W 686 European Match® with a .357 
Mag 158 Gr. projectile is used (Figure 5).

All shots are fired into the middle of the plates. The only 
exception is test number B5R, which get shot into the edge 
area. This edge shot has to hit the material in a distance of 30 
± 5 mm from an edge [13]. Test number B8 and B9 were shot 
without the shooting-box to check the penetration level of the 
loose layers [1]. 
B. Evaluation 
After every shot the diameter (d) and the depth of the 
imprint (t) of the back-face deformation is measured (Table 
VI). With these values, and the volume equation of a circular 
cone the volume of the back-face deformation (V) is 
calculated (3).  
 
V =

Additionally, the transmitted energy (E) is calculated 
backwards with following equation [8]: 
 
E = V (0.134 ∙  dm  −  1.13).

() 
The results show that test number 1, 3, 4, 5M, and 7 meet 
the requirement that the transmitted energy is lower than 70 
J. Especially test number three (15 layers) (Figure 6) shows a 
good average transmitted energy, comparing to test number 1 
(10-layers) and 5M (20 layers). Figure 7 shows the back-face-
deformation in the clay after shot three. The deformation is 
wider and not as deep as in the other tests. This is a good 
result, because deeper back-face-deformation can more likely 
lead to internal injuries. For that reason, a flatter and wider 
imprint is strived. Test number 5R failed, because the 
projectile left the plate before it gets stuck in the plate. As 
expected, test number 2 got perforated by the .357 Mag 
projectile. This test was conducted to see the penetration 
behavior of the material and projectile, like layer and 
projectile movement, deformation of the projectile and 
damage to the plate. At test number 8 and nine the projectile 
got stuck in the fourth layer of the loose layers. The back-face 
deformation of these test numbers is negligible [1].

BALLISTIC TEST  
The ballistic test is performed on the base of the VPAM 
APR [12] and VPAM BSW [13]. The aim of this test is to 
verify the shirt patterns for VPAM 3. This level is chosen, 
because there were no initial experiences with these 
materials. VPAM 3 requires that the plate withstand a 
penetration of a 9 mm Luger fired with a projectile velocity 
of 415 ± 10 m/s from 5 m distance [12]. Additionally, based 
on VPAM BSW, it has to withstand two additional shoots 
with a spacing of 75 mm arranged like an equilateral triangle 
[13]. 
A. Preparation and Test Setup 
To get an idea of the back-face deformation while using 
the shirt patterns, a new test set up was constructed (Figure 
8). This is necessary, because they do not fit into the shooting 
box, which was used in the pre-ballistic test. This time it is 
constructed completely based on VPAM BSW 5.1. The inner 
dimensions of the shooting-box are 400 mm width, 350 mm 
high and 150 mm depth. The shirt patterns are fix with Velcro 
fastener to the shooting-box. The used plasticine is 
recommended by VPAM (VPAM BSW No. 5.2) [13]. The 
ballistic test is conducted at an ambient temperature of 19 °C. 
A measurement of the plasticity is conducted as described 
in VPAM BSW No. 5.2.1. The mean imprint depth (dm) of 
the plasticine is 20.2 mm. Equation (1) is used to calculated 
the admitted maximal back-face deformation volume.

Vmax = (0.134 ∙ 20.2 − 1.13) ∙ 70 = 110.376  
() 
This leads to a maximal back-face deformation volume of 
110.376 cm3.  
The gun, which is used, is a H&K® MP5 with a 9 mm 
Luger 124 Gr. projectile. The velocities are measured with a 
light barrier measurement system. The average projectile 
velocity is 410.7 m/s, thus in the allowed range of the VPAM 
APR. The first shoot is fired into the middle of the of the plate 
(12M, 13M). The second shot is fired onto the left side of the 
first shoot, with a spacing of 75 mm (12L, 13L). The third 
shot is fired onto the right side of the second shoot, with a 
spacing of 75 mm, to get an equilateral triangle (12R, 13R).  
B. Evaluation 
After every shoot depth and diameter of the imprint is 
measured. With these values, the volume of the imprint with 
(3) and then the transmitted energy with (4) is calculated. The 
results are displayed in Table VII. 
The results show that all shoots of test number 12 and the 
first shoot of test number 13 (13M) meet the requirements of 
VPAM BSW, because the transmitted energy is lower than 
70 J. At test numbers 13R and 13L the projectile perforated 
the material, thus they do not meet the requirements of 
VPAM BSW. The front and the back side of test number 12 
is shown in Figure 9, test number 13 in Figure 10. In the 
penetration process the kinetic energy of the projectile is 
partially dissipated into the deformation of the projectile 
(Figure 11). A flat deformed projectile shows an acceptable 
energy dissipation duo to the mechanical properties of the 
fiber. A nearly intact projectile shows that the fibers absorb 
none of the projectile energy.

DISCUSSION 
The pre-testing and pre-ballistic test resulted in following 
findings. The heat-resistance-test shows that the composite 
plates are durable up to 70 °C. At higher temperatures a slip 
of layers is highly possible. Up to 60 °C no degeneration or 
melting is detectable (Table IV). Thus, the second matrix 
material and main material are suitable for the estimated 
conditions. 
To examine the flexibility, a sag test is conducted. It 
shows that 20-layer plates are too stiff for this area of use. 10- 
and 15-layers plates show good values of flexibility and 
weight compared to other soft ballistic plates (Table V).  
The ballistic plate has to meet the requirements of VPAM 
3 and VPAM 4. This requirement allows a maximal 
transmitted energy of 70 J. In a first placement test all 
expected plates meets this requirement by far (Table VI). 
Also, the sweatshirt inlays were tested successfully. It seems 
that the extensive shape, which leads to longer fibers, 
increases the ballistic performance.  
To summarize, the 15-layer plate is the best performing 
plate, because of the ratio between flexibility, weight and 
ballistic performance. 10-layer plates will not meet the 
VPAM 4 regulations, and 20-layer plates are too stiff and 
heavy for the area of use. These results will put the 15-layer 
plate into the focus of the studies. It has to be considered that 
these ballistic results are from a pre-testing series. They are 
just indicators for a relative rating between our ballistic plats. 
In further ballistic tests they have to be verified for the VPAM 
4 level. 
The ballistic test with the new materials confirms that the 
15-layer Dyneema® HB solution meets the VPAM 3 and 
BSW regulations. In fact, the average amount of transmitted 
energy is 29.6 J. This is only 40 % of the allowed value and 
12 % less transmitted energy compared to the HB26 plates. 
Thus, HB50 shows a promising ballistic performance to meet 
VPAM 4 regulations, which have to be tested in future work. 
Moreover, because of the lower density, the shirt patterns out 
of HB50 are 11.4 % lighter, compared to the predecessor 
material. 
The SB115 solution showed good first-shoot-capabilities, 
with the lowest transmitted energy of the ballistic test but a 
perforation after the second and third shoot. Thus, SB115 
missed the requirements of VPAM BSW and will no longer 
be considerate in the project. 
IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
All in all, the aim of this project is to create lightweight 
and flexible ballistic body armor for the civilian market. 
Therefore, a UHMWPE prepreg as main material and a two- 
component flexible resin as second matrix material is used. 
Through a lamination by hand procedure, ballistic composite 
plates are produced. Because of this method, the flexible 
properties of the main material are sustained. Moreover, a 
temperature resistance of the composite material up to 60 °C 
is identified. The conducted pre-tests (heat and sag test) show 
that the 15-layer plate meet our expectations the best, in the 
area of flexibility and durability. This leaded to further 
ballistic tests with 15-layer thick plates. Especially, the 
ballistic results of the plate are promising. The patterns out of 
this material already meet the requirements of VPAM 3 and 
VPAM BSW. Furthermore, compared to other available

products on the market, the new plate has a reduced weight 
of ~150 g, is 1.2 mm slimmer and full flexible.  
Further scientific work, will be focused on the HB50. This 
includes that 15-layer sweatshirt patterns made of HB50 will 
be extensive ballistic tested. Especially, VPAM 4 and VPAM 
BSW testing will be focused. A flatter and wider back-face-
deformation imprint is strived. Moreover, the heat and sag 
test for this material will be done, in order to get sure about 
the material properties relating durability and flexibility. For 
all these tests, 15-layer sweatshirt patterns will be produced 
with the lamination process by hand. Afterwards, the 
finalization process will be begun. This process includes 
investigations of coatings and edge support, to protect the 
ballistic plates against environmental conditions and make 
them ready for mission.
