Abstract— Universities in developing countries face greater 
challenges in implementing Learning Management Systems 
(LMSs) due to resource-poor settings, characterized by: low 
levels 
of ICT 
infrastructure; 
electricity 
outages; 
few 
computers; and limited and expensive Internet bandwidth, 
among other constraints. It is anticipated that if mobile phones 
are carefully integrated into the ecologies of LMSs, the impact 
of some of the above challenges in implementing LMSs would 
be reduced. This paper presents a user-centered design process 
of mobile LMS interfaces for accessing selected LMS services 
on mobile phones, and a user experience evaluation for a 
mobile LMS application implementation. From the design and 
implementation processes of the mLMS (mobile LMS), and the 
user experience evaluation of a working mLMS prototype, we 
conclude that: the ideas presented in the mLMS are technically 
feasible; the application is useful to the students and the 
students are encouraged to use their mobile phones to access 
LMS services more often, thereby reducing the over-reliance 
and pressure on the constrained institutional ICT resources.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
As universities strive to satisfy their students and the 
students’ needs, they are facing competition at different 
levels ranging from local to global [1][2]. In a globally-
competitive educational system, innovative universities that 
promote a culture of change and are willing to adopt new 
technologies 
for 
enhancing 
the 
students’ 
learning 
experiences stand a better chance of staying relevant and 
thriving in the new knowledge age [3][4]. Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) has proved to be an 
essential component of the educational system. It has 
positively impacted the educational system and has played 
an important role in meeting challenges ranging from 
educational and administrative to supportive [5].  
The application of ICT to support (or enhance) teaching and 
learning is commonly referred to as electronic learning or e-
learning. E-learning covers a spectrum of activities from 
supported learning to blended learning and to learning that 
is delivered entirely online. According to Akeroyd [6] and 
Kakasevski [7], among the various ICT tools that can be 
used to implement e-learning, Learning Management 
Systems (LMSs) are the most widely used tools for the 
support of blended learning and learning that is entirely 
delivered online. Paulsen [8] also argues that much of the 
success of e-learning can be attributed to the availability of 
learning management systems. He further states that the 
majority 
of 
European 
institutions 
have 
extensively 
implemented and benefited from e-learning via LMSs. The 
success of LMSs in European institutions has been 
attributed to Internet penetration as well as a well- 
developed ICT infrastructure.  
In developing countries, however, the potential of LMSs 
has not been fully exploited, mainly due to resource-poor 
settings characterized by low levels of ICT infrastructure, 
among other constraints [9].  
Current literature reveals that although universities in 
developing countries have continued to increasingly invest 
in the LMSs [10][11], the LMSs have not been fully 
exploited by the majority of the universities implementing 
them. To a larger extent, most LMS-supported e-learning 
initiatives, particularly in developing countries, have not 
fulfilled their potential. Prior work by the authors [9] and 
Sife [12] identified various factors that are responsible for 
the limited success of e-learning initiatives in general, and 
LMSs in particular, in developing countries. These included: 
limited ICT infrastructure such as LANs; few computers; 
limited and expensive Internet bandwidth; power outages; 
high ICT-illiteracy rates and low comfort levels using ICT–
solutions among the students; LMS usability issues; 
ineffective maintenance and inefficient user support 
strategies; high expectations from the institutions and their 
clients, the students;  and poor marketing strategies . The 
studies [9][12]   conclude that if learning management 
systems were to be implemented more effectively in 
developing countries to support students’ learning and to 
justify the high investment costs incurred by the universities 
in setting them up and maintaining them, further research 
and development efforts should be aimed at identifying 
strategies of reducing (or overcoming) the impact of the 
above challenges. 
In a related study [13], which was carried out to identify 
possible intervention(s) that could be instigated to reduce 
the impact of some of the challenges identified, it was noted 
that the proliferation of mobile phones among university 
students in the developing countries presents an opportunity 
to think of alternative ways of making LMS services 
effectively available to the students via their mobile phones. 
If this is achieved, it would reduce the over-reliance and the 
pressure on the institutional ICT resources for accessing the 
LMS services all the time by the students. After all, Minovic 
[14] noted that mobile devices have the potential to be 
integrated into the classroom because they contain unique 
characteristics such as: portability, social interactivity, 
context sensitivity, connectivity and individuality.  The 
study [13] revealed that the majority (over 99%) of the 
92

students in the surveyed universities possessed mobile 
phones, of which over 70% were Internet (feature) phones 
and 58% were smart phones. However, the students never 
used their mobile phones to access the LMS services. They 
reported that mobile phones presented usability and 
compatibility problems in trying to use them to access the 
LMS services. The constraints of using mobile phones to 
access full websites meant for desktop and laptop computers 
has also been clearly documented in the literature 
[15][16][17]. 
Thus, if mobile phones are to be effectively integrated 
into the LMS ecology to support students in accessing LMS 
services, directed/tailored mobile LMS interfaces have to be 
designed, and here is where the work of this paper seeks to 
make a contribution. The paper presents: a user-centered 
design process of mobile LMS interfaces for accessing 
selected LMS services on mobile phones; the technologies 
for 
developing 
the 
mLMS 
application; 
and 
the 
implementation and user-experience evaluation of the 
mLMS application.  
The next section of this paper presents the literature 
associated with the increased adoption and use of LMSs by 
Universities and the accessibility of LMS services by the 
students. The need to enhance accessibility of LMSs for the 
users (the students) who are constrained by poor ICT 
infrastructure is also presented in literature review. Then, 
the design of the LMS mobile interface is presented, 
followed by the development of the mVula application. 
Next, we present the evaluation of the mVula application 
through standard usability evaluation procedures that 
included: expert evaluation; focus group evaluation and user 
experience evaluation, followed by a presentation and 
analysis of the evaluation results. Finally, we conclude with 
the major findings of this research on optimizing LMS 
interfaces for mobile access, and the future work.  
 
II. RELATED LITERATURE 
A. 
LMS Adoption  
Learning management systems, sometimes referred to as 
Virtual Learning Environments (VLE), Course Management 
Systems (CMSs), Learning Content Management Systems 
(LCMSs), 
Managed 
Learning 
Environment 
(MLE), 
Learning Support Systems (LSSs) or Learning Platforms 
(LPs), can be defined as Web-based software application 
platforms that use Web technologies and Internet services to 
support: online course creation, maintenance and delivery; 
student 
enrolment 
and 
management; 
education 
administration and student performance reporting [18][19]. 
The LMSs and related technologies such as the Internet 
have provided new directions in teaching and learning, and 
have had a significant impact on the ways in which 
universities and teachers interact with students. For 
example, LMSs allow learners to use interactive features 
such as threaded discussions, chatrooms, discussion fora 
and other methods of communication among them, with the 
teachers, and with the university. As a result, LMSs have 
been widely adopted by universities. In fact, it is difficult to 
identify many universities that do not use a learning 
management system of some sort [10]. 
The increased adoption of learning management systems 
by universities is premised on the fact that the LMSs are: 
domain independent; have better administration capabilities; 
integrated authoring tools; and support the design and 
publication of reusable learning resources [7][10]. They are 
thus regarded as the most basic and reliable e-learning tools 
in blended learning environments, and they are often viewed 
as the starting point of any Web-based learning program 
[10]. Furthermore, the emergence of open source platforms 
such as Moodle and Sakai has encouraged universities, 
particularly those working with limited budgets, to adopt the 
LMSs [20], mainly for two reasons: scalability, because the 
open source platforms allow the universities to have as 
many users as they like without incurring bigger license 
fees, given that they are operating under tight budget 
constraints; and flexibility, because the universities can 
choose to develop/tailor the open source platforms to meet 
their particular needs [21]. 
B. 
Accessibility of LMS Services 
Accessibility can be defined as the ability of the 
Learning Objects (LO) to be accessed by learners in any 
location regardless of the learner experience, device or the 
type of platform the learner uses [22][23]. Learning Objects 
are units of instructional content that can be used and reused 
on Web-based e-learning systems In LMSs, Learning 
Objects are presented in the various service components 
such as: announcements, assignments, resources, forums, 
chat rooms, course outlines and wikis [24]. According to 
Ardito [25], Costabile [26] and Wong [27], accessibility of 
the learning objects plays a significant role towards the 
success of any online learning programme.  Yet Leal and 
Queiros [24] contend that despite the success in the 
promotion of the standardization of e-learning systems, 
usability and accessibility are still a major user concern with 
the existing systems. 
Earlier work by Leal [24] and Dagger [18] claims that 
adapting Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) to e-
learning systems so as to provide flexible learning 
environments for learners could improve the usability and 
accessibility of the services. After all, the current generation 
of LMSs embraced the “services” principle, exposing 
certain aspects of their functionality externally [11][18]. 
This means that as designs became more modularized, it is 
easier for platforms to integrate new functionality as it arises 
[13]. Furthermore, Dagger [26] argues that the LMS 
community has made an increased move towards separating 
content from tools, and the learner information has become 
more distinguished. However, these systems aren’t entirely 
learner-centric; they still focus strongly on learning 
administration (course management) rather than on the 
learner [18]. 
The work presented in this paper, however, distinct from 
prior research, in that the main goal was to enhance 
accessibility from the point of view of LMS users (the 
students) who are constrained by poor ICT infrastructure, 
rather than improving or extending the functionality of 
LMSs. Similar studies on LMS accessibility were carried 
93

out within the framework of the European Commission 
Web-edu project by Paulsen [8] on the accessibility and 
satisfaction of LMSs in 113 institutions across 17 European 
countries. The studies revealed no major technical problems 
with LMSs, and the users rated accessibility to the LMS 
services as satisfactory. The studies also noted that in the 
European Nordic region and North Western Europe where 
Internet penetration was high, it is not easy to find a 
university without experiences of LMSs, compared to the 
Southern European region, where Internet penetration was 
low. The study concludes that Internet penetration 
determines the level of use of LMSs. 
In developing countries, besides the low Internet 
penetration, there are other constraints such as power 
outages and the physical infrastructure such as the local area 
networks and the lack of enough computers for the learner 
community. These constraints make it harder for the 
students to access the LMS services. However, the 
proliferation of mobile phones in the developing countries 
has to some extent made up for the generally poor physical 
ICT infrastructure. In this study, mobile phone were 
integrated into the LMS ecology by designing and 
developing streamlined mobile LMS interfaces to enhance 
the accessibility of LMS services through the mobile phones 
and increase the LMS usage by the students. 
III.  DESIGN OF THE MOBILE LMS 
Overall, a User-Centred Design (UCD) approach was 
taken. Winograd [28] defines user-centred design as an 
approach to software design that grounds the process in 
information about the users of the software product. It 
focuses 
on 
users 
through 
the 
analysis, 
design, 
implementation and evaluation of the product. Its aim is to 
develop applications and systems that are usable and meet 
the requirements of the users in their context of use [19]. 
The approach incorporates three principles: involve users 
and gives them high priority; use rapid prototyping in the 
design phase to produce a number of prototypes that can be 
revised through user feedback [29]; and, thirdly, the 
approach is incremental throughout the whole process, 
because a number of revisions are necessary to improve the 
quality of the application through a continuous cycle of 
gradual refinement [19]. 
The design of the mobile LMS interfaces was done 
through a participatory design process [16] with students at 
the University of Cape Town. At the University of Cape 
Town, the Sakai LMS is used, and it is locally branded 
‘Vula’. During the design process, the term mobile Vula 
(mVula) was used, instead of mobile LMS. 
The students who participated in the design process of 
mVula were randomly selected and, meetings with them 
were organised in focus groups of 2s and 3s. A total of 13 
students participated. The idea of optimising Vula for 
mobile access by providing access to a few selected Vula 
services was introduced to the students (in focus groups). To 
some students, it was a completely novel idea, while others 
were aware of the presence of a mobile version of the Vula 
site but had not accessed it.  Some had accessed the mobile 
version of Vula, which they said was not very different from 
the full desktop Vula site and was not so appealing on the 
small phone screen. During the discussions (semi-structured 
interviews) with the students (which lasted 10-15 minutes) 
some interesting ideas about their expectations for mobile 
Vula came up, and these were noted by the investigator. The 
students were then engaged in a co-design session. They 
were provided with pencil and paper and asked to draw 
storyboard sketches of what they wanted the mVula 
interfaces for the selected services to look like. At first, this 
did not work out well, as most students did not know how to 
represent mobile phone interfaces on paper, and those who 
had an idea also wasted a lot of time drawing pictures of full 
mobile phones (screen, buttons, keypads etc) other than 
sketching the interfaces. 
To provide a hint to novices, and to avoid wasting time 
in drawing mobile phone pictures, familiar mobile phone 
screen templates (Figure 1) were printed and given to the 
participants instead of the plain paper, such that they could 
now draw the interfaces within the templates.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
This improved the process greatly and meaningful 
storyboard sketches were drawn by the students.   
From the storyboard interface sketches drawn by the 
students using the templates in Figure 1 above, the 
investigator created the first paper prototypes of mVula 
interfaces, with two distinct ideas: (i) course-based (Figure 
2) and (ii) service-based (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Paper Prototype 1b: Service-based interface 
 
Both of the prototypes (Figures 2 and 3) were given to 
students to be validated and to choose the most appropriate 
and appealing prototype to them. Ten students participated 
in this validation exercise. Eight out of the ten students 
selected the service-based prototype (Figure 3) and, in 
addition, they suggested that the services be block-based 
instead of the tabs.     Then, the final paper prototype of 
mVula (Figure 4) was generated.  
The main features presented in mobile Vula include: the 
application should be service-based (as opposed to course-
based); to provide a few services with only the necessary 
details for each service (defer access to more details through 
more appropriate devices like PCs); the services to be block-
based (as opposed to tabs); services like announcements to 
be populated with information from across the various 
courses, and presented according to date. 
The most needed/required LMS services to be provided 
for access on the mobile phones have to be identified and, 
these may differ from university to university. In the 
surveyed universities, the most needed/required LMS 
services included: announcements, assignments, resources, 
course outlines and chat rooms [13].

IV.  DEVELOPMENT OF MVULA APPLICATION 
After generating the final paper prototype of mVula 
through the participatory design process, the next step was 
then to develop a working prototype of mVula, bearing in 
mind that the users (students) possessed different mobile 
handsets with differing operating systems/platforms such as 
Android, iOS, Nokia Symbian, BlackBerry and Windows 
OS.  
As literature on mobile application development 
highlights [17], there were two ways to develop the mVula 
application: either (i) to develop mVula for a single mobile 
platform (native application) and test the ideas on that one 
platform; or (ii) develop a cross-platform application [30] 
and test the ideas across all the major platforms.  
While the native application option would be easier and 
more straight-forward in terms of development [31], such an 
application would be restrictive. Only students with mobile 
phones with a particular platform would be able to use it. To 
obtain feedback (about the ideas presented in mVula) from 
as many users as possible using a wide range of mobile 
phones, possibly with different platforms, would require 
development of mVula as a native application for each 
platform separately. This would require a lot of time; also, it 
would be difficult to implement and maintain several native 
applications.  
mVula was thus developed as a cross-platform 
application so as to capture as many users as possible across 
the major platforms. However, this also presented a 
different set of challenges, such as the limited number of 
technologies 
available 
to 
develop 
cross-platform 
applications, and the fact that such an application would not 
be able to utilise some smart phone features that could 
possibly be required.  
In the recent past, the smart phone industry has 
experienced a major development that has seen most of the 
current generation of smart phones built with a compatible 
underlying browser engine, called Webkit [15]. Webkit is an 
open source library that renders HTML. It eliminates the 
incompatibilities among mobile browsers, making it easier 
to develop cross-platform Web applications. This means 
that any WebApp developed with Webkit support would 
easily be rendered by the native browsers of most smart 
phones.  
Additionally, there   are Cross-platform Mobile 
Development tools (XMTs) (examples in Table1), that can 
be used to create apps for different smart phone platforms 
from the same code base [32][30]. This development does 
not only reduce the coding load, but also ensures that the 
services provided through such an application would reach a 
wider audience of potential users [33].  
However, although mobile Web applications do not make 
any explicit assumptions about features of the delivery 
context, best practices assume devices with support for 
standard 
Extensible 
HyperText 
Markup 
Language  
(XHTML), JavaScript  and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
capability 
(W3C n.d). 
Thus, cross-platform mobile

applications are typically Web applications. The World 
Wide Web Consortium has defined Web application as a 
term that refers to a Web page (XHTML or a variant thereof 
+ CSS) or collection of Web pages delivered over Hypertext 
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that use server-side or client-side 
processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" 
experience 
within 
a 
Web 
browser.                                   
Table 1 below shows some of the cross-platform mobile 
application development tools, and the mobile platforms 
each supports, as of April 2013; the situation is dynamic, 
and could change (or have changed).

 Although Table 1 does not show an exhaustive list of 
cross-platform mobile application development tools, all the 
tools presented support Android and iOS, while BlackBerry, 
Symbian and WinMob are also well supported. 
In this case, the tools that support most or all of the 
major mobile platforms were considered for selection for 
the development of mVula. However, as already noted, 
HTML and JavaScript are a prerequisite for Webkit-based 
applications. Therefore, choice of the final XMT for the 
development of mVula also depended on the tool’s 
supporting programming languages (Table 2).  
From Tables 1 and 2, it is clear that Application Craft 
and jQuery were the strongest candidates for choice. 
Finally, as Ohrt [34] argues that the option of using a 
familiar tool can be a strong incentive to select a certain 
XMT, jQuery was chosen for the development of mVula. 
V. 
EVALUATION OF MVULA   
The first working prototype of mVula was evaluated for 
usability through standard usability evaluation procedures, 
complemented with case-specific measures. According to 
Ardito [25], the ISO 9241 [35] defines usability as the 
extent to which a product can be used by specified users to 
achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and 
satisfaction in a specified context of use. The application 
96

eLmL 2014 : The Sixth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

was evaluated for usability at three levels: expert evaluation; 
focus group evaluation and user experience evaluation.  
The expert (heuristic) evaluation [36] was aimed at 
evaluating the application for: simplicity; errors; efficiency 
and comprehensibility as well as identifying any Human 
Computer Interaction (HCI) related concerns and interface 
flaws to improve user interaction. This was achieved with 
five HCI practitioners who interacted with the application in 
a laboratory setting and provided feedback to the developer. 
The feedback was then used to improve the application 
before the focus group evaluation. 
The focus groups were made up of students who were 
randomly recruited through a research assistant. The 
research assistant was asked to identify any students who 
had smart phones and introduced them to the investigator 
for further briefing about the exercise.  This evaluation was 
aimed at measuring learnability (ease of use) of the 
application as well as identifying any functional errors and 
flaws within the application. Learnability was assessed with 
two measurements: (i) the ability to use the application 
without instructions/guidance on the first try, and (ii) task 
completion without errors or getting frustrated. Feedback 
was obtained through observations and verbal feedback, as 
well as a structured questionnaire that the students were 
requested to fill at the end of the exercise. 
With feedback from the experts and focus group 
evaluations, the application was improved to generate a 
second prototype (Screenshots in Figure 5).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The second prototype of the application was then rolled 
out to students for a user experience evaluation. ISO FDIS 
9241-210 defines user experience as: “A person's 
perceptions and responses that result from the use and/or 
anticipated use of a product, system or service”, and can be 
measured during or after use of the product, system or 
service [37] 
The user experience evaluation of the mVula application 
was done with students from the Department of Computer 
Science, University of Cape Town. Through mVula, the 
students could access the selected Vula services through 
their mobile phones, upon login using their University login 
credentials.  The application was hosted on a publically-
accessible server, and its address was given to the students. 
Following a call for participation in this, seventy (70) 
students volunteered to participate. The students were asked 
to voluntarily use the application in accessing Vula services 
for about 2-3 weeks and thereafter provide feedback about 
the ideas presented in the application, its usability and 
usefulness.  Within the application, there was a link to an 
online questionnaire (survey tool) that the students had to 
use for evaluating the application.  
VI. 
EVALUATION RESULTS 
Feedback from the user experience evaluation was 
obtained through an online questionnaire. The questionnaire 
had two sections. Section one required the users to evaluate 
the application in terms of ease of use, perceived usefulness 
and overall satisfaction with the ideas presented in the 
application. These were probed through Likert-type 
questions. Section two was the narrative section, which 
required the users to comment on the application as well as 
define/mention any other requirements that would make the 
application more useful to them. Out of seventy (70) 
evaluation requests that were sent out to the participants, 
thirty (30) valid responses were obtained, representing a 
response rate of 44%.  
The analysis of the collected data has been divided into 
two: the Likert–type responses that have been analyzed as 
ordinal data, and the narrative section that has been 
organized thematically.   
A. 
Analysis of the Likert-type Responses  
Likert data can either be of Likert-type or Likert-scale. 
Clason and Dormody [38] described Likert-type items as the 
form of the original Likert (Likert 1932) response 
alternatives that are considered and analysed as individual 
questions (not summated). In the Likert-type, multiple 
questions may be used in a research instrument, but the 
responses from the items may not be combined into a 
composite scale [39]. That is, Likert-type questions are 
unique and stand-alone. 
In this study, Likert-type questions with five response 
alternatives (e.g., strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree and 
strongly disagree) were used to assess the students’ level of 
satisfaction with the ideas presented in the application as 
well as to evaluate the application in terms of ease of use

and perceived usefulness. Several similar mobile application 
studies have deployed this evaluation technique [40][41]. 
However, because Likert-type responses express “a greater 
than” relationship without indicating by how much, the 
analysis of such data is often limited to ordinal procedures 
[39].  
Methodological and statistical texts recommend that, for 
ordinal data, one should employ the median or mode as the 
measure of 
central 
tendency, 
and 
frequencies 
(or 
percentages) as the measure of variability [39][42][43][44]. 
This is because the arithmetic manipulations required for 
calculating the mean, standard deviation and some 
parametric tests are inappropriate for ordinal data, where the 
numbers generally represent verbal statements [42].  
1) 
Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness of mVula 
To assess the ease of use and perceived usefulness of the 
mVula application, seven questions were asked. Table 3 
below presents the responses from the students.

From Table 3, question one was intended to find out 
whether the ideas presented in the mVula application were 
clear to the students. The question was well understood by 
the respondents and 70% affirmed the clarity of the ideas. 
Question two evaluated four usability aspects of the 
application. The responses indicated that although over 80% 
of students agree that the application is navigable and easy 
to use, 60% indicated that the attractiveness of the 
application can be improved. Over 90% of the respondents 
indicated that the idea of accessing Vula services through 
streamlined mobile interfaces was very useful. The students 
were able to get the information they needed from Vula via 
mVula without the need for full desktop interfaces.  
Question four was intended to evaluate the perceptions 
of the students about some of the ideas presented in the 
mVula application. While over 60% of the respondents 
agreed that the features of mVula make Vula services easier 
to access on the mobile phone, they also suggested more 
features. 
The question about the effectiveness of the mVula 
application registered the highest percentage of neutral 
responses. This was probably because the respondents were 
not in position to judge the effectiveness of the intervention 
within a period of three weeks. This attribute of the study 
will be assessed further in a longitudinal impact evaluation 
that will be carried out in subsequent studies. 
2) 
Overall Satisfaction  
The overall satisfaction with the ideas presented in the 
mVula application was probed through a five-point Likert-
scale (Table 4).

Although none of the respondents was “not satisfied”, 
almost a third of the respondents (30%) were partially 
satisfied. Therefore, this means that more work had to be 
done on mVula to create greater satisfaction.  By 
incorporating some of the comments provided by the 
respondents, it is hoped that the satisfaction level will 
increase. 
B. 
Comment Analysis 
The feedback from the narrative section of the 
questionnaire was analysed with the following as guiding 
questions: 
• 
What additional requirements are defined by the 
users? 
• 
What improvements in the prototype should be 
made 
to 
enhance 
user 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
application? 
o 
What is the problem with the prototype 
and what is the scope and severity of the 
problem? 
o 
What solutions can be implemented across 
the platforms and which ones require 
native applications?  
1) 
Additional requirements defined by the users 
a) 
More services, such as Tutorial signups, Grade 
book and Tests & Quizzes, were requested for in the 
application by some students. However, the original idea of 
the application was to provide a few services, given the 
limitation of the mobile phone.  Eight services were 
provided, and these had been identified as the most 
needed/required services. These services can differ from 
university to university and can easily be changed from time 
to time. In this case, however, the chosen services will be 
maintained. 
b) 
Enable assignment submission using the phone. 
Some students requested that the application should allow 
them to make submissions, especially assignments. This can 
possibly be implemented across the platforms. However, the 
students will still be advised that the use of the mobile 
phones to access LMS services cannot be used as a 
surrogate for computers, so to perform some tasks such as 
attaching and sending files would better be done using more 
appropriate devices, such as PCs and laptop computers. 
c) 
Notifications 
for 
new 
announcements 
and 
reminders for assignment deadlines. The notification 
function could not be implemented across platforms. It 
required the use of smart phone features that are supported 
differently for each platform. To test the feasibility of this 
ideal, however, an Android notification service was  
 
 
developed and has been integrated into the mVula 
application.  
The service connects to the LMS server and runs in the 
background of the phone and notifies the user of any new 
announcement posted.  
2) 
Required Improvements  
a) 
Given 
that 
the 
application 
pulled 
all 
the 
announcements from across all the courses and presented 
them according to date, the students said that it was difficult 
for them to determine which announcement is for which 
course by simply looking at the announcement caption. So, 
they required that the source of the announcement be 
indicated as part of the announcement caption. The same 
also applied to the assignments. This has been implemented 
and works across all platforms. The captions of the 
announcements and assignments are displayed with title and 
source (course), and are arranged according to date. 
b) 
Most current courses should be displayed first (or 
courses should be ranked on the screen according to the 
users’ preference.). This has been implemented. The priority 
in course listing is according to the date of course 
registration. That is, the current semester courses are listed 
first, and then the older/previously registered courses 
follow. 
c) 
Some students felt that the colours used and the 
overall visual appeal of the interfaces was quite dull, and 
buttons seemed too big to fit on some screens. Best 
practices of visual presentations have been consulted and 
the colour scheme improved. 
Overall, there were no major problems with the 
prototype. There were more positive comments from the 
students, most of whom seemed happy to use the application 
in the current state. 
Most of the additional requirements raised by the 
students could be implemented on Webkit (across the major 
mobile platforms), except one: the notification service 
which required native services for each platform. The 
additional requirements that could be implemented on 
Webkit have been implemented, and a native service to pop 
up notifications of new postings in Vula has been created 
for the Android platform and integrated into mVula. 
VII. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Understanding students’ expectations for a mobile LMS, 
and involving the students in the design process of the 
mobile LMS interfaces is key to designing and developing 
usable mobile interfaces for accessing LMS services. The 
students prefer: to go through less “clicks” before they can 
be able to access the desired LMS information; that access

of LMS through the mobile phones should be service-based, 
as opposed to course-based; that the mobile LMS 
application should be made as simple as possible and non-
crowded, that is, fewer LMS services (the most 
needed/desired services) should be made accessible through 
mobile phones. 
Some of the students who participated in this study (and 
possibly the majority of students in developing country 
universities) exhibited behaviors that we had not seen 
previously reported in the literature in the use (and ability) 
of their smart mobile phones. This may be symptomatic of 
technology “leap frogging,” where the new internet users 
among the students are obtaining access by mobile devices 
and are skipping the traditional means of access. This has to 
be taken into consideration when involving such users in the 
design 
process 
of 
streamlined 
(directed/customized) 
interfaces. For instance, in our case, some students did not 
know what to expect in streamlined mobile interfaces for an 
LMS, and how different such interfaces could be from the 
full LMS interfaces meant for computer access. The fact 
that we had to prepare and use mobile screens templates 
instead of plain paper during the co-design sessions with the 
students to generate paper prototypes may also indicate a 
lack of clarity in the difference in the roles between mutable 
software and immutable hardware. 
Through the participatory design process with the 
students, we created a paper prototype, and then a working 
Webkit-based prototype for mobile Vula (mVula) to test the 
ideas 
of 
a 
mobile 
LMS. 
From 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
processes 
of 
mVula, 
it 
has 
been 
demonstrated that mobile interfaces for LMSs can be made 
more usable and useful by selecting an appropriate subset of 
services. The user experience evaluation of the application 
also indicated that the idea of accessing Vula services 
through streamlined mobile interfaces was very useful to the 
students. Actually, the streamlined mobile interface 
encourages greater use of LMSs and allows students to get 
the information they need without the need for a full 
desktop interface.  
However, during the user experience evaluation, the 
students also defined additional requirements, most of 
which have been implemented to further better the usability 
and usefulness of the application. In future, we will deploy 
the application for a longitudinal user experience evaluation 
to assess its overall value–impact evaluation.
