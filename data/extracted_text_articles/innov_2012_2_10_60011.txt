Abstract—Broadband power line communication (BPLC) is
a promising medium for network access technology by which
broadband services can be offered, such as smart grid, broadband
Internet access, digital entertainment, and home networking
services. This paper presents a modiﬁed multipath channel
model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and
analyzes the channel capacity and bit-error-rate performance
of MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-
OFDM) based BPLC over that channel model. The widely-
used single-input single-output (SISO) channel model (also called
Zimmermann’s model) is extended to the MIMO channel model
considering coupling effects among conductors.
Keywords-MIMO; OFDM; crosstalk; channel capacity; broad-
band power line communication.
I. INTRODUCTION
The greatest advantage of power line communication (PLC)
is that there is no need for new infrastructure, which is cost
efﬁcient in the implementation. The other merits of PLC are
as follows: it contributes to low power consumption; it can
be applied for the use of energy control and monitoring;
it reduces the wiring and lightens the transportation system
(vehicles, aircrafts, etc.). In other words, PLC is more “green”.
Deﬁnitely, PLC provides a green ubiquitous concept, eco-
nomical realization and installation. Furthermore, Broadband
PLC (BPLC) can provide high-rate or high performance data
services through power line channels. Hence, it can be sufﬁ-
ciently capable of serving as a means of communication able
to support future green-energy based smart grid applications.
Since the BPLC standard (IEEE 1901) is recently adopted [1],
there has been growing interest to BPLC.
Several techniques to model channel transfer characteristic
of PLC networks have been presented in various literatures [2]
– [4]. Zimmermann and Dostert in [3] state the variety of loads
connected to the network terminals and the presence of several
cable branches which cause impedance mismatches. Due to
these impedance mismatches, many reﬂections of signal ap-
pear during its transfer along the cable. This is called multipath
fading or frequency selective fading. The signal distortion
experience as a result of frequency-selective fading can be
signiﬁcantly reduced, even if not completely eliminated, by the
introduction of efﬁcient multicarrier modulation techniques.
One of these efﬁcient multicarrier modulation techniques is or-
thogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [5]. OFDM
is a smart technique for reliable broadband communications
over a wireless channel, which reduces inter-symbol interfer-
ence and can be applied in PLC [6]. Multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) communication is a well-known technique to
improve data capacity in radio transmission system and can be
similarly applied to PLC by substituting transmit and receive
antennas with signal feed and receive ports as well as the
wireless channel with the existing electrical wiring [7], [8]. In
order to investigate the performance of the MIMO power line
network, a reliable MIMO multipath channel model needs to
be exploited. However, until now, there is no generally estab-
lished PLC channel model for MIMO based BPLC systems.
The objective of this paper is to design a multipath channel
model that could be reliable in analyzing MIMO BPLC
systems. We modiﬁed the widely used single-input single-
output (SISO) channel model [3] into MIMO channel model
which deﬁnes multi-antenna channel characteristics including
coupling effects among conductors. The contributions of this
paper include: (a) MIMO multipath channel characterization
based from multi-conductor transmission line (MTL) theory
[9]; (b) analytical model which considers crosstalk caused by
coupling effects between conductors; (c) bit error rate (BER)
and channel capacity analysis for a suggested MIMO-OFDM
BPLC system.
For MIMO BPLC, a pair of conductors forms a single
antenna path (even there has no real antenna). Thus the
coupling effect among conductors should not be avoidable
[9]. However, existing MIMO systems [7], [8], which have
been introduced until now, do not consider crosstalk between
conductors forming MIMO channels such that their simulation
results are too optimistic. In this paper, the widely used
multipath channel model proposed in [3], which is intended
for SISO systems, is modiﬁed into a multipath channel model
for MIMO systems with coupling effects.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
transmission line analysis and MIMO channel modeling are
presented in Section II. Section III shows the coding scheme
and MIMO-OFDM implementation. Section IV shows the
simulation results. Concluding remarks are drawn in Section
V.

II. TRANSMISSION LINE ANALYSIS AND MIMO CHANNEL
MODELING
In this section, we will discuss how the channel model
of power cable is derived. MIMO is well-suited for BPLC
because of its great advantages. One of its advantages is very
high capacity and spectral efﬁciency achieved by simultane-
ously employing space, time, and frequency domains. A key
component of MIMO BPLC is the improved communications
reliability, i.e., reduced bit error rate (BER) and improved data
capacity, which can be achieved with reasonable computational
complexity. However, for the implementation of MIMO BPLC,
coupling effects between conductors should be considered.
A. Modiﬁed MIMO Power Line Channel Model
In this paper, the widely used channel model [3] for SISO
system is modiﬁed into MIMO system which considers the
coupling effects among conductors. Zimmermann and Dostert
in [3] state that PLC channel can be regarded as multipath
scenario with frequency selective fading. They also state the
variety of loads connected to the network terminals and the
presence of several cable branches which cause impedance
mismatches. These impedance mismatches produce multipath
propagation of the signal in the BPLC environment. Due
to impedance mismatches, many reﬂections of signal appear
during its transfer along the cable. Summing up multi-path
propagation, signal attenuation and delay leads to the channel
transfer function (CTF) [3]:
H(f) =
Np
∑
p=1
gp
|{z}
weighting factor
A(f, dp)
|
{z
}
attenuation portion
e−j2πfdp/Vd
|
{z
}
delay portion
,
(1)
where Np is the total number of fading paths, gp is the pth
path weighting factor, dp/Vd = τp is the pth path propagation
delay, dp is the pth path length and Vd is the phase velocity.
As depicted in (1), the propagation signal is affected by
attenuation, A(f, dp) increasing with the pth path distance
dp and frequency f. The cable loss derivation further gives
the formula of attenuation factor, which is mainly affected by
primary cable parameters, in the form of complex propagation
constant [3]:
γ =
√
(R′ + jωL′)(G′ + jωC′) = α + jβ,
(2)
where the real part of the propagation constant γ is the
attenuation constant α, while β is the phase constant. Since we
are only interested in the attenuation constant, β is negligible.
The primary cable parameters L′ and C′ (inductance and ca-
pacitance per unit length, respectively) can be estimated by the
geometric dimensions and the material properties while R′ and
G′ (resistance and conductance per unit length, respectively)
depend on frequency. Tonello, D’Alessandro, and Lampe in
[5] also state that the attenuation of a power line cable can be
characterized by
A(f, dp) = e−α(f)dp,

where α can be extracted from (2). Therefore, by substituting
(3) to (1), the frequency response can be simply given as
H(f) =
Np
∑
p=1
gpe−α(f)dpe−j2πfdp/Vd.
(4)
We will enhance this SISO channel model into the MIMO
channel model. If we are going to transform SISO system
into MIMO system for channel capacity improvement, the
parallel conductors deﬁnitely affects the other conductors due
to coupling effects. This coupling effect is commonly present
even on different types of multiconductor conﬁguration: low
voltage (LV) overhead, LV underground, medium voltage
(MV) overhead, and MV underground. Throughout this paper,
for simplicity, we mainly focus on MV overhead power lines
to construct a MIMO channel, as depicted in Fig. 1.
In MIMO system, the channel transfer function (CTF) for
the ith transmit antenna to the jth receive antenna path (where
i = 1, 2, · · · , I and j = 1, 2, · · · , J) can be written as
Hi,j(f) =
Np
∑
p=1
gpe−αi,j(f)dpe−j2πfτp.

For outdoor network with three-phase conductors conﬁgura-
tion, as shown in Fig. 1, 3×3 MIMO system can be obtained
by simply pairing Wire 1 to Wire G (ground), Wire 2 to ground
and Wire 3 to ground to form antenna 1, 2 and 3 respectively,
as shown in Fig. 2.
For this MIMO system consisting of three transmitter and
receiver ports, the channel matrix can be written as
H(MIMO) =

where diagonal terms of H(MIMO) indicate co-channels and
its anti-diagonal terms indicate cross channels. Since MIMO
system is considered, the coupling effect should be considered
such that the anti-diagonal terms Hi,j (where i ̸= j) might not
be zero.
The attenuation constant αi,j in the attenuation portion of
Hi,j in (5) can be extracted from
αi,j = Real

, (8)
where the operator .∗ indicates the element-wise matrix
multiplication. This element-wise operation of (8) allows us
to derive αi,j for a speciﬁc antenna channel, Hi,j, while
assuming all other channel inputs except i are zero (by
MTL theory [9], it implies that we can derive αi,j while
assuming all other circuit inputs except i are zero , i.e.,
Vm = 0 & Im = 0 for ∀m, m ̸= i). R′′, L′′, C′′ and G′′
correspond to transmission line matrices [9], which represent
the mutual interactions between conductors. The equivalent

and [10].
III. CODING SCHEME AND MIMO-OFDM
Fig. 4 shows the block diagram of a MIMO-OFDM system.
In the transmitter side, input signal is fed to the QPSK
encoder/modulator block. Accordingly, the modulated symbols
are mapped in space frequency (SF) encoder [12]. Then,
inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and cyclic preﬁx (CP)
insertion for each antenna path are performed sequentially.
The symbols are then transmitted to the receiver via a
MIMO BPLC channel, as shown in Fig. 2. Multiple antennas
are applied in order to achieve many desirable objectives for
wireless communications, such as capacity increase without
bandwidth expansion, transmission reliability enhancement,
and co-channel interference suppression for multi-user trans-
mission. The receiver performs the reverse operation of the
transmitter. The received signal is carried out by cyclic preﬁx
removal, FFT operation, space frequency decoding, QPSK
demodulation and channel decoding. Especially, through the
demodulation process, maximum ratio combining (MRC) can
be executed to combat the damaging effects of channel fading
and effectively combine multiple antenna and multipath fading
signals [13]. In this paper, the antenna and fading MRC
(AFMRC) scheme [13] is implemented in order to achieve
improved bit-error-rate (BER), which is a combining technique
of multiple antenna MRC (AMRC) and multipath fading MRC
(FMRC).

IV. DATA AND RESULTS
The MIMO channel capacity via power line channels has
been simulated using the water ﬁlling algorithm [11]. In that
algorithm, the optimum power to the parallel subchannels,
represented by the diagonal elements of the MIMO channel
matrix H(MIMO), is obtained by performing the singular value
decomposition on that matrix. In Fig. 5, the channel capacity
for a SISO system, a 2 × 2 MIMO system (which can be
obtained for indoor case with three conductors [14]) and a
3 × 3 MIMO system over MV overhead power lines has been
plotted. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the channel capacity of
3 × 3 MIMO system is 2.15 times greater than SISO. Fig. 5
also depicts the comparison of MIMO without crosstalk and
with crosstalk. It is observable that crosstalk damages the data
capacity of 3 × 3 MIMO system up to 20%.
For the BER performance evaluation, the MIMO-OFDM
system presented in Section III is simulated with the param-
eters listed on Table I. For practical simulation, power line
impulse noise [15] is also added to the simulated channel.
The performance of MIMO-OFDM is also compared with
Fig. 6.
BER performance comparison of SISO and MIMO with and without
crosstalk
SISO-OFDM over the power line channel. The BER perfor-
mance of the proposed model is evaluated both in SISO and
MIMO systems and plots are provided in Fig. 6. It can be
depicted that the proposed MIMO systems show performance
improvement over the conventional SISO system. At the BER
of 10-4, for example, MIMO-OFDM has a performance gain
of about 8dB (in energy per bit to noise power spectral
density ratio (Eb/N0)) over SISO-OFDM. Fig. 6 also shows
the BER results of MIMO with crosstalk consideration, where
a performance degradation of 0.7dB can be noticed for both
2 × 2 and 3 × 3 MIMO at the BER of 10-4.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper has developed a modiﬁed multipath model for
MIMO BPLC systems, where the overall channel transfer
function taking into account the crosstalk between conductors
forming antenna channels has been derived. This paper has
also analyzed channel capacity and BER performance of a
MIMO-OFDM BPLC system over MV overhead power line
channels.
