Abstract— The Giant Magneto-Impedance (GMI) effect is one
of the most promising phenomena for creation of miniaturized
magnetic sensors and magnetometers. We propose a route for
development of cost-effective magnetically soft microwires for
GMI applications. Stress-annealing of the Fe-rich glass-coated
microwire
allows
considerable
improvement
of
magnetic
softness
and
giant
Magneto-Impedance
effect.
Observed
experimental dependencies are discussed considering various
factors affecting the magnetic properties of the studied
microwire upon stress-annealing: induced magnetic anisotropy
and internal stresses relaxation.
Keywords-

effect;
magnetic
microwires; magnetic softness.

INTRODUCTION
Studies of Giant Magneto-Impedance (GMI) effect have
attracted considerable attention of the scientific community
and industries over the past two decades owing to a number
of technological applications such as magnetic sensors,
memories and devices, smart composites for remote stress
and temperature monitoring, health monitoring, etc. [1]-[5].
Usually, magnetic field dependences of impedance, Z, is
expressed through the GMI ratio [6][7], ΔZ/Z, defined as:

∆ܼ/ܼ
= [ܼ (ܪ) − ܼ(ܪ݉ܽݔ)]/ܼ(ܪ݉ܽݔ),(1)
where Hmax is the maximum applied DC magnetic field.
The GMI effect is one of the most promising phenomena
for creation of sensitive and inexpensive magnetic sensors
and magnetometers. The main interest in GMI effect is
related to one of the largest magnetic field sensitivities (up
to 10 %/A/m) among non-cryogenic effects [1]-[5][8][9].
The development of magnetic materials presenting the
highest
GMI
effect
is
essentially
relevant
for
aforementioned applications of the GMI effect in magnetic
sensors and devices [1]-[5]. The highest GMI effect is
reported for Co-rich magnetic wires where Z/Z -values of
about 600% are achieved [8][9]. But, for most industrial
applications, the use of Co-based alloys might be an
obstacle since Co belongs to critical materials, being
therefore at risk of supply constraints, financially costly and
price volatile [10].
On the other hand, for most of emerging applications,
the miniaturized magnetic sensors are requested [3]-[5].
Therefore, the development of cost-effective magnetically
soft
microwires
without
Co
is
highly
demanded
for
prospective applications [1][6].
Less expensive Fe-rich glass-coated microwires are good
candidates. However, usually highly magnetostrictive as-
prepared
Fe-rich
amorphous
glass-coated
microwires
present rectangular hysteresis loop characterized by low
circumferential magnetic permeability and therefore present
low GMI effect [3][5][9]. Experimentally, it was confirmed
that the domain structure of Fe-rich microwires consists of a
large axially magnetized single domain surrounded by the
outer domains with radial magnetization orientation [11].
Such domain structure is related to a magnetoelastic
anisotropy, i.e., high internal stresses with preferentially
axial component and high and positive magnetostriction
coefficient.
One of the possibilities is the diminishing of the
magnetostriction coefficient by devitrification of amorphous
precursor after appropriate annealing [12]-[14]. However,
Finemet-type nanocrystalline materials are rather brittle.
Recently, an alternative method has been reported,
allowing magnetic softening of Fe-rich microwires through
the induced magnetic [15][16]. One of the main advantages
of this method is that excellent mechanical properties of
amorphous microwires are maintained.
Consequently, in this paper, we present our recent
experimental
results
on
effect
of
stress-annealing
on
magnetic properties and high frequency GMI effect of Fe-
rich glass-coated microwires.

In the section Experimental details, we present the

of

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
We studied the influence of stress-annealing on magnetic
properties and GMI effect of Fe75B9Si12C4 amorphous glass-
coated microwires (total diameter, D = 26.6 m, metallic
nucleus diameter, d = 25.6 m) prepared by Taylor-
Ulitovsky method described elsewhere [5][9].
The samples have been annealed using a conventional
furnace. In the case of stress-annealing, the mechanical load
has been attached to the end of the sample during the
anneling.
The values of stresses applied during the annealing have
been calculated as previously described elsewhere [16]:
ߪ௠=
௄.௉
௄ ௌ೘ାௌ೒೗ ;ߪ௚௟=

(2)
where k =E2/E1, E2 is the Young modulus of the metal, E1
is the Young modulus of the glass at room temperature, P is
the mechanical load applied during the annealing, and Sm
and Sgl are the cross sections of the metallic nucleus and
glass coating respectively. The estimated values of applied
stress are calculated using (2) is σm ≈ 900 MPa. 
The hysteresis loops were measured by the fluxmetric
method as described in previous publications on magnetic
microwires [5]. We represent the hysteresis loops as the
dependence of normalized magnetization, M/MHmax (where M
is the sample´s magnetic moment at given magnetic field, H,
and MHmax is the sample´s magnetic moment at the maximum
magnetic field amplitude, Hm ) versus magnetic field, H.
The microwire impedance, Z, was evaluated from the
reflection coefficient S11 measured by the vector network
analyzer using the micro-strip sample holder as previously
described [16][17]. This technique allows to extend the
frequency range for GMI characterization up to GHz range.
The GMI ratio, ΔZ/Z, is defined using (1).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As expected from previous knowledge on magnetic
properties
of
Fe-rich
microwires
[16],
as-prepared
Fe75B9Si12C4
microwires
present
perfectly
rectangular
hysteresis loops (Figure 1).
Conventional annealing (without stress) does not affect
the overall hysteresis loop shape, although some decrease of
coercivity after annealing is appreciated (Figure 1).
However, after stress-annealing, we observed drastic
changes of hysteresis loops and hence magnetic properties
of studied Fe75B9Si12C4 microwires. The hysteresis loops
change from perfectly rectangular to linear with quite low
coercivity (see Figures 2a-2c). The coercivity, Hc, and
remanent magnetization decrease with increasing of the
annealing temperature, Tann.

The observed modification of the hysteresis loops
reflects change of magnetic anisotropy from axial to
transverse. Consequently, the hysteresis loops of stress-
annealed Fe-rich microwires are quite similar those of Co-
rich microwires in which the remagnetization process in
axial direction is associated to the magnetization rotation
[16].
It is worth mentioning that the transversal magnetic
anisotropy in stress-annealed Fe-rich microwires can be
tuned by the temperature of stress-annealing (see Figure 1).
As reported elsewhere, magnetic field dependence of
GMI ratio is intrinsically related to the type of magnetic
anisotropy [18][19]. Therefore, as expected, the GMI ratio
value
and
the
magnetic
field
dependence
of
studied
microwires are rather different. Drastic increasing of GMI
ratio after stress-annealing can be appreciated from Figure 3.
Moreover, the Z/Z(H) dependencies of as-prepared and
stress-annealed samples are essentially different. Stress-
annealed
samples
present
double-peak
Z/Z(H)
dependencies predicted for the samples with transverse
magnetic anisotropy, while decay of Z/Z versus H typical
for axial magnetic anisotropy is observed in as-prepared
sample.
As previously reported elsewhere, for each particular
magnetic material, there is an optimal frequency range
where
the
GMI
effect
presents
the
highest
values
[16][17][20]. The optimal frequency is related to the sample
dimensions
(diameter),
as
well
as
to
the
magnetic
anisotropy. The observed improvement of GMI ratio is
present in a wide frequency range. For comparison,
frequency
dependencies
of
maximum
GMI
ratio
on
measured frequency are presented in Figure 4.
As can be appreciated from Figure 4, GMI ratio in
Fe75B9Si12C4 microwires
stress-annealed
at
all
studied
conditions (Tann) is almost one order of magnitude higher
than in as-prepared Fe75B9Si12C4 microwires. The most
noticeable is the enhancement of ΔZ/Zm -values observed
for the frequency band of about 300 MHz, where more than
one order increasing of the GMI ratio (up to ΔZ/Zm  ≈ 125%) 
by stress-annealing is achieved (Figure 4). In the sample
stress-annealed at Tann = 300 oC for tann = 60 min the GMI
ratio values of about 100% are observed in a wide frequency
band from 200 MHz up to 1 GHz (Figure 4).
Considerable enhancement of GMI ratio observed in
stress-annealed Fe-rich microwires must be attributed to
transverse magnetic anisotropy evidenced from comparison
of hysteresis loops of as-prepared and stress –annealed
microwires and Z/Z(H) dependencies (Figures 2, 3).
The rectangular hysteresis loop observed in as-prepared
Fe-rich
microwires
(Figures
1,
2a)
with
positive
magnetostriction coefficient is commonly attributed to the
axial magnetic anisotropy related to the magnetoelastic
anisotropy [21]-[23]. From provided simulation [23][24], as
well as from indirect experimental studies involving change
of magnetic properties upon chemical etching [5][25] of
glass-coating or stress relaxation by annealing [5][26], it is
confirmed that the axial internal stresses in glass-coated
microwires arising during the preparation process are the
highest within the most part of the metallic nucleus.
From previous studies, it is known that stresses and/or
magnetic field annealing considerably affects the magnetic
properties
of
amorphous
materials
originated
by
a
macroscopic induced magnetic anisotropy [27]-[29].
The origin of induced magnetic anisotropy of amorphous
materials has been discussed in terms of the directional
ordering of atomic pairs or compositional short- range
ordering [27]-[31], as well as the compositional and
topological short range ordering [30][31]. The mentioned
pair ordering is commonly considered for amorphous alloys
containing
at
least
two
magnetic
elements
[27]-[29].
However, topological short range ordering (also known as
structural anisotropy) involves the angular distribution of
the
atomic
bonds
and
small
anisotropic
structural
rearrangements at temperatures near the glass transition
temperature [30].
For
the
present
case
of
Fe75B9Si12C4 amorphous
microwires containing only one magnetic element (Fe) the
pair ordering and the compositional short- range ordering
mechanisms of stress- induced magnetic anisotropy are not
very likely. Therefore, the contribution of topological short
range ordering looks more likely. Additionally, in the case
of glass-coated microwires, the presence of the glass-
coating associated to strong internal stresses [21]-[23] is
relevant
for
formation
of
the
macroscopic
magnetic
anisotropy. Consequently, previously the origin of stress-
induced anisotropy in Fe-rich (Fe74B13Si11C2) amorphous
microwires has been discussed considering “back stresses”
giving rise to the redistribution of the internal stresses after
stress-annealing [32].
Consequently,
the
observed
transversal
magnetic
anisotropy induced by stress annealing can be explained
considering
either
increasing
to
back
stresses
or
aforementioned topological short range ordering.

The advantage of above described effective approach
allowing improvement of magnetic softness and high
frequency GMI effect of Fe-rich microwires is that the
proposed
stress-annealing
allows
to
retain
superior
mechanical
properties
of
amorphous
materials,
i.e.,
plasticity and flexibility.
It is worth mentioning that the observed stress-induced
anisotropy
is
rather
stable
and
cannot
be
removed
completely
by
the
subsequent
annealing:
as
recently
described [16], only a portion of such stress-annealing
induced
anisotropy
can
be
eliminated
by
subsequent
annealing without stress.
IV.
CONCLUSION
In this work, we present studies of magnetic properties
and GMI effect of Fe o-rich microwires.
Considerable enhancement of magnetic softness and
GMI effect of Fe-rich microwires has been observed after
stress- annealing. For the interpretation of the observed
effect of stress annealing, we considered internal stresses
relaxation after annealing and interplay of compressive
stresses and axial internal stresses after stress annealing.
Consequently, appropriate annealing is the effective method
for
improvement
of
magnetic
softness,
domain
wall
dynamics and GMI effect of glass-coated microwire.
