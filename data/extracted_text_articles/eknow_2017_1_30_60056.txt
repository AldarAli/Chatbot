Abstract—Predictability of returns is one of the most 
important concerns in bond investment. In this study, we 
analyze the predictability of corporate bond prices after 
company announcements of financial results using a support 
vector machine (SVM). This paper will discuss (1) the 
highest hit ratio found when predicting the movement of 
corporate bond prices using the four variables of current net 
earnings, management earnings forecasts, ratings, and a 
leading composite index, and (2) the highest hit ratio found 
while using a Gaussian kernel function with a parameter of 
0.6 and a slack coefficient of 1.0. In addition to offering 
captivating insights from the results of this study regarding 
the mechanism by which financial reports impact prices in 
the bond market, our results also deepen our understanding 
of excess returns in asset management.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In the management of corporate bonds, ensuring stable 
generation of excess profits, identifying sources of excess 
returns, and predicting credit risk are all critical concerns 
[1][2][3][4][5].  
Research on sources of excess profits is closely related 
to discussions of market efficiency, and numerous studies 
focusing primarily on stocks, have been conducted on this 
topic [6][7]. Among these, the relationship between 
company financial reports and the stock market is one of 
the areas where research is most extensive [8][9][10]. 
Several studies have been conducted on the impact of 
financial statements on the stock market, but there are few 
studies that focus on the bond market. Reference [3] 
focuses on information disclosed in company financial 
reports in Japan and conducts an event study analysis 
using the cumulative excess return (CER) to analyze the 
impact of disclosure information on corporate bond prices. 
As a result, it found that corporate bond prices tend to 
exhibit (1) no change in CER if current net earnings are 
higher than the previous term, while CER tends to become 
negative if current net earnings are less than the previous 
term, and (2) CER becomes increasingly negative when 
current net earnings decrease, management earnings 
forecasts for the next term are less optimistic, and bond 
ratings are low. This shows that current net earnings 
impact bond prices more than management earnings 
forecasts.  
Research regarding price predictability is also a critical 
stream, and numerous studies have been conducted mainly 
focusing on stocks. Traditional prediction methods include 
regression models and auto regression models, but more 
recently, studies using learning models have also become 
popular. References [11][12] have predicted stock prices 
using support vector machines (SVM) and have reported 
that the accuracy of such predictions is higher compared 
with traditional models. However, these studies were 
conducted outside of the Japanese market, and studies 
regarding the predictability of corporate bond prices in 
Japan are particularly rare. 
To address this gap, this study analyzes the 
predictability of Japanese corporate bond prices following 
announcements of financial results using a SVM. 
The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows. The 
analytical methods used are explained in Section II, and 
the study results are discussed in Section III. A summary 
of our study is presented in Section IV. 
II. 
ANALYTICAL METHOD 
After first characterizing the samples used in the 
analysis and the corporate bond CER, we describe the four 
factors used as explanatory variables: current net earnings, 
management earnings forecasts, the index of business 
conditions, and ratings. 
A. Sample 
The sample data used in this study are comprised of 
reported corporate financial results disclosed between 
2002 and 2010. The data used comes from 1,441 
companies that satisfied the following five conditions: (1) 
from company annual reports that had at least two 
reporting periods between 2002 and 2010, (2) from 
companies that disclose current earnings and earnings 
forecasts per share on a consolidated basis (or non-

consolidated basis if unavailable), (3) from companies 
whose rate of change in the number of shares in 
comparison to the previous fiscal year was 20% or lower,   
(4) from the companies which issued one or more bonds 
with one year or more remaining maturity, and 5) from 
companies that have been rated (R&I standard).

B. Corporate bond CERs 
In this section, we define the annual reporting date as 
daily 0 (t=0) and then analyze the return on bond j issued 
by company i. The belief is that information around 
financial results affects the corporate bond spread, 
representing corporate credit risk.  
Therefore, we focus on bond returns as a function of 
changes in corporate bond spreads. Corporate bond 
spreads are calculated based on the difference between the 
corporate bond yield and the government bond yield 
whose maturity is the same as the corporate bond and can 
be converted into returns by multiplying the change in the 
spread by the price sensitivity (Mdur) against the yield. 
However, in order to focus on changes in the corporate 
bond spread resulting from information disclosed by 
individual companies, it is necessary to calculate the return 
on bonds (hereafter “excess return”) by deducting the 
effect of changes in the overall market spread. References 
[13][14] defined excess return as the difference between 
the total return on corporate bonds and the total return on 
bond indices with the same rating and maturity as the 
corporate bonds. Because Japanese bond indices are 
separated by rating and maturity and therefore have 
different spreads, in this study, we decided to determine 
excess returns based on corporate bond spreads with 
reference to the method described by [13][14]. 
Equation (1) is used to calculate excess returns on 
corporate bonds. The excess return on corporate bond j 
issued by company i is obtained by subtracting the index 
spread total return (ISR) from the spread total return (SR) 
of issuer i. 
er(i, j, t)SR(i, j, t)-ISR(i, j, t)
Equation (2) is used to calculate the SR of corporate 
bonds used in (1) above. The first variable in (2) represents 
the capital return coming from the spread, and the second 
variable represents the income return from the spread. 
Mdur represents the modified duration.    
 
 
 
SR(i,j,t) =dSR x Mdur+Spd x days/365.           (2) 
 
Equation (3) is used to calculate the ISR of the index 
used in (1). In this analysis, NOMURA-BPI data are used 
as index data. The R&I standard rating (AA, A, BBB, BB), 
the maturity (short term(less than 1-3 years), middle term 
(>3, <7 years), or long term  (>7 years)) can be obtained as 
index attribute information by spread. We calculated the 
returns for each category based on information from these 
12 types of spreads. 
 
         ISR =dSpd x Mdur+Spd x days/365.                (3) 
 
Additionally, if company i is issuing J bonds, the 
excess return on individual bond j issued by the same 
company is weighted based on market value of bond j at 
time t, and the excess return on the bond issued by 
company i is then calculated. W represents the weighted 
market value of the bond j. 
 
              Er(i, t) =w(i, j, t)  x er(i, j, t).                     (4) 
 
 
The average excess return at time t (at time of 
reporting: t = 0) is as follows. 
 
 
              ER(t) =Er(i, t)  / N.                     (5) 
 
 
CER is defined as the cumulative return of ER(t) 
obtained in this manner on a daily basis. 
 
C. Corporate bond CERs on a yearly basis 
During the sample period 2002 to 2010, the economic 
situation varied depending on the year. Thus, there is a 
possibility that reactions in the corporate bond market 
differ depending on economic conditions. For example, 
based on the economic cycle announced by the Cabinet 
Office in Japan, it is possible to divide the cycle into two 
segments: an expansion phase and a recession phase. 
Based on this schema, 2002 was the bottom of the 
recession phase and the economy exhibited growth until 
2008. However, after the Lehman shock that occurred in 
2008, the economy went into a decline. The recession 
phase continued until 2009, and the economy then entered 
an expansion phase in 2010.  
In this section, we will analyze the CER trend for 
making predictions of corporate bond CER. Specifically, 
we divide CERs by fiscal year, and further divide these 
based on movement in current net earnings (increase, 
decrease) and management earnings forecasts (increase, 
decrease). We assume here that investments are made the 
day following the announcement of financial results, and 
the cumulative excess return is CER (+1, +30).  
We look at these results in the context of management 
next term earnings forecasts based on an increase in 
current net earnings. During the economic expansion 
phase, CERs tend to be positive regardless of the increase 
or decrease in the next term earnings forecast, but the CER

may be negative during a recession phase. Next, we 
looked at the results in the context of management next 
term earnings forecasts based on a decrease in current net 
earnings. When compared on an annual basis, the tendency 
is that no change in CER is observed, or the CER may be 
negative. Particularly in 2002 and 2009, during the 
economic recession, we can see that the CER is strongly 
negative in the case when the management earnings 
forecast decreased. This indicates that corporate bond 
prices may be affected by economic conditions as well as 
current net earnings and earnings forecasts.

D. Support vector machines  
In this study, we use a SVM, which is one of various 
types of learning models commonly used for predicting 
prices. SVMs use a Gaussian kernel function [15]. The 
Gaussian function has two settings, parameter σ2 and slack 
coefficients, which are important factors in measuring the 
superiority of SVMs. We also present our analysis of these 
parameters here. 
 
              y =  y K(x(i), x).                     (6) 
 
E. Analytical data 
In this section, we summarize the results of our 
analysis of corporate bond price predictability in the 
Japanese market. As was confirmed in the previous section, 
when assessing CERs, fluctuations in corporate bond 
excess returns are generally small. Therefore, it is more 
important to be able to predict a large negative excess 
return as seen in 2009, rather than predicting a positive 
excess return. 
Therefore, in this section, we will focus on predicting 
the negative excess returns on corporate bonds seen in 
2009 by designating the training sample as the period from 
2002 to 2008, and the prediction sample as 2009. 
When predicting abnormal negative excess returns 
using a SVM, the CER needs to be classified into two 
types. Specifically, it is assumed that CERs (+1, +30) are 
divided into two types with -0.01% as a threshold value, 
where CERs exceeding -0.01% are defined as normal 
returns, and CERs of -0.01% or less are defined as 
abnormal negative returns. 
 
 
    R(i) = Normal return if CER(+1,+30)> -0.01%, 
     Otherwise, abnormal negative return.           (7) 
 
F. Explanatory variables 
1) Current net earnings 
 One representative data point disclosed in a financial 
report is current net earnings. Reference [3] states that of 
the various types of data disclosed in financial reports, 
current net earnings may possibly affect bond prices. Thus, 
in predicting bond prices, we conducted our analysis using 
current net earnings as an explanatory variable. Equation 
(8) shows the rate of change in current net earnings per 
share (A) from the previous term (T-1) to the current term 
(T). Net earnings per share are treated as current net 
earnings. If ΔA is positive, current term net earnings 
increase in comparison to the previous term. If ΔA is 
negative, current net earnings decline over the previous 
term. 
 
              dA(T) = .                     (8) 
 
2) Management net earnings forecasts 
Management forecasts of subsequent terms’ earnings 
are announced at the same time as current net earnings in 
financial results. In research studies using stock prices, it 
has also been reported that the influence of the manager 
next term earnings forecast is greater than the impact of 
current net earnings. In this study, it is assumed that the 
management earnings forecast is an explanatory variable 
and analyzed as such [9]. In our analysis, we focus on net 
earnings forecast per share and investigate its impact on 
bond prices. Equation (9) shows the rate of change in net 
earnings per share (A) during a specific period (T) and the 
net earnings forecast by management (F) for the 
subsequent term (T+1). If ΔF is positive, earnings are 
expected to increase during the T+1 period compared with 
net earnings during term T. Conversely, if ΔF is negative, 
earnings during the T+1 period are expected to be lower 
than net earnings during term T. 
 
dF(T+1) = F.                (9) 
 
3) Index of business conditions 
Reference [3] states that bond price responses may 
differ depending on the business conditions during the 
fiscal year that financial results are announced. This study 
uses two indices, a composite index (CI) and a diffusion 
index (DI), as indicators capturing the economic trends in 
this study’s sample period 2002 to 2010. The CI measures 
the magnitude of economic fluctuations and their tempo by 
compiling the movements of component indicators, while 
the DI calculates the proportion of these indicators that 
have exhibited improvement in order to measure diffusion 
to each component of the economy. There are three types 
of indices that make up the CI and DI: the leading index 
that precedes the economic condition, the coincident index 
that moves in concert with the economy, and the lagging 
index that moves after (lags) the economic condition. We 
15

use the coincident index to understand the current 
condition of the economy, and because the leading index 
generally precedes the coincident index by several months, 
we use this to predict the future movement in the economy. 
In general, the lagging index lags the coincident index by 
about a half year, so it is used for ex post factual 
confirmation.  
4) Ratings 
Ratings are commonly used as indicators of the 
financial condition of a company. Reference [3] found that 
in addition to the impact of financial report data on bond 
prices, bond prices could also be impacted by ratings and 
decline significantly when these ratings are low. 
While there are five rating agencies, R&I, the Japan 
Credit Rating Agency (JCR), Standard & Poor’s (S&P), 
Moody’s, and Fitch, for this analysis, we adopted R&I, 
which has the highest coverage rate for our samples.  
 
III. 
ANALYSIS RESULTS  
In this section, we describe how we modeled corporate 
bond price predictions using a SVM. We analyze the 
differences between the explanatory variables, then 
analyze the adjusted parameters, the impact of different 
models on the kernel functions, and the cross-validation. 
A. Analysis of differences between explanatory variables 
In this section, we analyze the effects of differences 
between explanatory variables, which are the current net 
earnings, management earnings forecasts, ratings, and 
index of business conditions, as explained in Section II 
above. Reference [3] indicates that it is possible that 
corporate bond prices may have a particular impact on 
current net earnings. Therefore, we add other variables 
under the assumption that current net earnings were 
already added.  
Using the training data, we look into the suitability of 
our model based on differences in the explanatory power 
of the variables for bond prices. First, by combining 
current net earnings, ratings, and the index of business 
conditions (six patterns) and looking at the fit for the 
training model, we can see that a high hit ratio is achieved 
for all combinations. In particular, the highest hit ratio is 
for the combination of current net earnings, ratings, and 
coincident CI at 84.66%. In considering the six trends in 
the index of business conditions, we can conclude that the 
CI is more suitable than the DI. Because the CI represents 
the magnitude and tempo of economic fluctuations and the 
DI represents the degree of economic diffusion, there is a 
possibility that corporate bond prices are affected by both 
the magnitude of economic fluctuations as well as their 
tempo.  
Next, by combining the three variables of management 
earnings forecasts, ratings, and the index of business 
conditions (six patterns) and observing the fit for the 
training model, we can also find that a high hit ratio can be 
achieved for all combinations of these variables as well. In 
particular, the hit ratio generated increased to 83.82% 
when a coincident CI was used. In addition, by comparing 
the fitness of the six patterns of the index of business 
conditions, it can be concluded that the CI is more suitable 
than the DI. The same trend can be observed when using 
current net earnings and ratings as explanatory variables.  
Next, we can find that the hit ratio can reach as high as 
78.64% when observing the degree of fitness for the 
training model exhibited by the three variables of current 
net earnings, management earnings forecasts, and ratings. 
This indicates that a certain frequency of correct responses 
can be obtained only by using the combination of current 
net earnings, management earnings forecasts, and ratings, 
even when the index of business conditions is not included 
in the explanatory variables.  
Last, when combining the four variables of current net 
earnings, management earnings forecasts, ratings, and 
index of business conditions (six patterns), we found that a 
high hit ratio is achieved for all combinations. Specifically, 
we found that the hit ratio was highest when using a 
coincident CI, at 84.66%.

Next, we look at the prediction performance for 
holdout data. First, when looking at the prediction results 
when the three variables of current net earnings, ratings, 
and index of business conditions (six patterns) are 
combined, the hit ratio when using a leading CI or a 
coincident CI is very high at 97.86% for abnormal 
negative returns, and very low for normal returns, at 
5.41%. In contrast, when using other indices of business 
conditions, we find that the hit ratio for normal returns is 
high and the hit ratio for abnormal negative returns is very 
low. This suggests that the training model may be 
overfitting.  
Next, looking at the prediction results when using a 
combination of the three variables of management 
16
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2017.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-542-5

earnings forecasts, ratings, and the index of business 
conditions (six patterns), use of the leading CI and the 
coincident CI resulted in a high hit ratio for abnormal 
negative returns of 80.61% and 97.96%, respectively, but 
the hit ratio for normal returns was low. In contrast, when 
using other indices of business conditions, we find that the 
hit ratio for normal returns is high and the hit ratio for 
abnormal negative returns is very low. This suggests the 
possibility that the training model may be overfitting, 
similar to what occurs using current net earnings.  
Next, when assessing the prediction results when using 
the three variables of current net earnings, management 
earnings forecasts, and ratings, the hit ratio for abnormal 
negative returns is 0, and the hit ratio for normal returns is 
94.59%. There is a possibility that the training model is 
overfitting in this case as well.  
Finally, in assessing prediction results when using a 
combination of the four variables of current net earnings, 
management earnings forecasts, ratings, and the index of 
business conditions (six patterns), the hit ratio when using 
a leading CI is 89.13% for abnormal negative returns, and 
29.73% for normal returns. Although the hit ratio for 
normal returns is not high, there is a possibility that the hit 
ratio could be improved by adjusting parameters. Results 
from using other indices of business conditions appear to 
be strongly biased towards either abnormal negative 
returns or normal returns, suggesting the possibility of 
overfitting by the training model. 
In this section, we analyze the effects of the differences 
in the explanatory variables used, and as a result, we find 
that the highest predictability for corporate bond prices is 
achieved when using the four explanatory variables of 
current net earnings, management earnings forecasts, 
ratings, and the leading CI.

B. Analysis of parameter differences 
In the previous section, we analyzed the differences 
between variables, and as a result, found that the best case 
arises when making corporate bond price predictions using 
the four variables of current net earnings, management 
earnings forecasts, ratings, and the leading CI. We then 
determined the most suitable parameters assuming these 
four variables.  
The SVM has two parameters: one the variance σ2 of 
the kernel function (Gaussian) and the other the slack 
coefficient representing the degree of relaxation of the 
constraining condition when the discrimination is not 
possible. By adjusting these two parameters, we are able to 
look at the suitability for our model. 
First, we analyze the hit ratio from the training data 
and the holdout data after fixing the slack coefficients and 
the kernel function parameters adjusted from 0.6 to 1. The 
hit ratio for the training data exceeded 80% in all cases, 
resulting in a high hit ratio. On the other hand, for the hit 
ratio for the holdout data, utilized a lower kernel function 
parameter, as the hit ratio for abnormal negative returns 
tended to decrease, the hit ratio for normal returns tended 
to increase. Overall, the hit ratios of abnormal negative 
returns and normal returns both exceeded 60% when the 
parameter of the kernel function was set to 0.6.  
We next looked at the hit ratio for the training and 
holdout data after adjusting the kernel function parameter 
to 0.6 and changing the slack coefficient from 0.5 to 2. 
The difference in the hit ratio for the training data was not 
much despite adjusting the slack coefficient, and exceeded 
80% in all cases. In contrast, for the hit ratio for the 
holdout data, which utilized a lower slack coefficient, as 
the hit ratio for abnormal negative returns tended to 
decrease, the hit ratio for the normal return tended to 
increase. In particular, correct responses for both abnormal 
negative returns and the normal returns exceeded 60% 
when the slack coefficient was 1.0.

In this section, we analyze differences in parameters 
and predict the movement of corporate bond prices using 
the four variables of current net earnings, management 
earnings forecasts, ratings, and the leading CI. We find 
that the model fits best when using a kernel function 
(Gaussian) with a parameter of 0.6 and a slack coefficient 
of 1.0. 
 
C. Analysis using different Kernel functions 
In this analysis, we use the Gaussian function as a 
general SVM kernel function. In this section, we 
summarize the results of our analysis of each of three 
different kernel functions; the linear, polynomial, and 
sigmoid, other than the Gaussian function, fit with our 
model.  
First, we set the parameters of each kernel function to 1, 
and then observed the hit ratio for the training data. 
However, as the hit ratio was low, we changed the 
parameters and checked the hit ratio again. As a result of 
the changes, the hit ratio for the training data achieved a 
70% range for all kernel functions, lower than the 80% 
level achieved using the Gaussian function.  
The parameters for each Kernel function were adjusted 
and we looked into the prediction performance for holdout 
data. As a result, the hit ratio for normal returns increased 
with all kernel functions, while the hit ratio for abnormal 
negative returns was as low as the 30% range. Based on 
these results, we concluded that the Gaussian function is 
the most suitable for predicting abnormal negative returns.  
In this section, by checking the hit ratio for corporate 
bond prices due to the differences in the SVM kernel 
functions, we found that the Gaussian function is the most 
suitable function among the Gaussian, linear, polynomial, 
and sigmoid functions tested.

D. Analysis of cross-validation 
The issue of model overlearning has been highlighted 
in regard to constructive learning models. Therefore, in 
this section, we summarize our findings when checking for 
overfitting in our training model using k-fold cross-
validation. 
Here, we analyze the cross-validation under the 
conditions tested among the various analyses conducted 
previously that resulted in the highest rates of correct 
responses by the training model and prediction model. 
Specifically, when we predict the movements of corporate 
bond prices using the four variables of current net earnings, 
management earnings forecasts, ratings, and the leading CI, 
we used the Gaussian kernel function with a parameter of 
0.6 and a slack coefficient of 1.0. The division method 
used consisted of separating the data into 10 groups during 
the 2002 to 2008 training period. 
In viewing the results, the hit ratio on cross validation 
is as high as 80.1%. From this, it seems that such a result 
indicates that it is highly likely that the model in this study 
is not overfitting. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study, we analyze the predictability of corporate 
bond prices following company announcements of 
financial results using a SVM. 
From our analysis, we find that we are able to obtain 
(1) the highest prediction performance when using the four 
variables of current net earnings, management earnings 
forecasts, ratings, and the leading CI, and (2) the highest 
prediction performance when using a Gaussian kernel 
function with a parameter of 0.6 and a slack coefficient of 
1.0 as model conditions.  
These results offer captivating insights regarding the 
predictability of prices in the corporate bond market using 
a SVM. 
In terms of future work, we plan to expand the data to 
current year and to apply the same structure to other bond 
markets outside of Japan.
