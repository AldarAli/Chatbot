Abstract—Fourth Generation (4G) cellular networks present a 
number of improvements in the overall network performance. 
However, and despite the advanced technologies that are being 
employed, Inter Cell Interference (ICI) remains a constraining 
factor. ICI Coordination techniques target the minimization of 
ICI and have gained ground in the literature. The introduction 
of dynamicity in these schemes results in even better 
bandwidth utilization and enhances the overall performance. 
In this work, we propose a distributed algorithm that performs 
dynamic channel allocation to mitigate the ICI in cellular 
scenarios applying Partial Frequency Reuse (PFR). In 
particular, the algorithm is based on a Gibbs Sampler 
mechanism that allows achieving an optimized performance. 
Simulation results have shown that the proposed solution 
reduces the network interference up to 13 dB with respect to 
classical PFR. In addition, benefits have also been observed in 
the user capacity, where our scheme achieves improvements of 
up to 43% in terms of average user capacity and up to 17% for 
the users located at the cell edge. 
Keywords—Dynamic Frequency Allocation; Partial Frequency 
Reuse; Gibbs Sampler 
I. INTRODUCTION  
The new era of mobile communications is dictated by the 
usage of smartphones, tablets and laptops and their demand 
for high data rate applications and seamless connections. The 
introduction of the fourth generation (4G) cellular systems 
has been a crucial point in the history of mobile 
communications evolution, targeting improved coverage, 
enhanced capacity and robust, high speed data transfer. Third 
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has adopted 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) 
as radio access technology in 4G networks, resulting in better 
spectral efficiency and in the reduction of the Intra-Cell 
Interference, due to the orthogonality of the users. However, 
despite its significant contribution to the overall network 
performance, Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) can degrade the 
achievable capacity. Especially for the edge users, which are 
located close to the cell borders, ICI becomes a constraining 
factor resulting in a considerable capacity reduction for these 
users.  
In order to cope with the above mentioned problem, 4G 
systems make use of ICI coordination (ICIC) techniques. 
These schemes allow the allocation of the available resources 
to the edge users with higher reuse factors, mitigating in this 
way the network interference [1]. ICIC techniques usually 
follow the general concept of Fractional Frequency Reuse 
(FFR) [2], where the cell is divided in two areas, the inner 
and the outer, and the same strategy is applied to the 
available bandwidth. 
Different schemes have been proposed for FFR, such as 
Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) [3] and Partial Frequency 
Reuse (PFR) [4][5]. This work focuses on the PFR scheme 
that splits the cell in two regions, the inner and the outer, as 
illustrated in Figure 1. In the same way, the bandwidth is 
divided into the inner band, assigned with a reuse-1 factor 
(Full Reuse) so that it is common to all the cells, and the 
outer band, which is assigned with a higher reuse factor 
(Partial Reuse), e.g., reuse-3, as it can be seen in the right 
part of Figure 1, where the frequency bands assigned to each 
inner/outer cell are presented. In addition, PFR allows the 
possibility for different powers to be used for the downlink 
(DL) transmissions in the inner/outer parts of the cell. 
However, despite of the advantages of the classical PFR 
schemes, the allocation of the resources follows a static 
principle. As a result, since the network traffic conditions 
vary over time, a static allocation will not be able to adapt to 
these changes [6]. Moreover, these schemes may not be 
optimal in irregular deployments. As such, research has been 
focused on the optimization of the ICIC schemes though the 
introduction 
of 
dynamicity. 
A 
Dynamic 
Fractional 
Frequency Reuse scheme has been presented in [7] making 
use of a graph-based framework to re-allocate resources 
depending on cell load variations. In [8], the authors 
presented a Dynamic Frequency Reuse scheme that mainly 
deals with uneven traffic loads. Two algorithms are used, 
one for resource allocation and another one for power 
control, which significantly improved the network capacity 
and the energy efficiency. In [9], an adaptive PFR scheme 
has been developed based on an off-line genetic algorithm 
enhancing the performance in terms of edge user throughput. 
Recently the FFR concept has also been proposed for 
interference 
management 
in 
heterogeneous 
networks 
involving both macro and femtocells as for example in [10]. 
Under the above presented framework, in this work we 
propose a novel dynamic allocation scheme based on the 
Gibbs Sampler [11][12] concept as optimization tool. The

proposed solution is applied in tri-sectorial PFR deployments 
targeting the minimization of the downlink ICI. The rationale 
behind this selection is that this mechanism accomplishes 
such an interference minimization in a natural way and it is 
an efficient tool for distributed optimization. In particular, 
this paper investigates how to optimally assign a set of 
frequencies in the inner and the outer parts of the different 
cells in the scenario. The proposed mechanism is suitable for 
4G systems with special focus on 3GPP LTE since the 
partitioning of the available bandwidth in sub-bands and the 
X2 interface used for coordination purposes constitute it an 
ideal candidate. 
Gibbs 
sampler-based 
algorithms 
for 
optimization 
purposes have been widely used in the literature under a 
variety of situations. Two fully distributed algorithms that 
follow the concept of Gibbs Sampler have been used in [13] 
in order to perform channel selection and user association in 
unmanaged WiFi networks. In [14], the authors have 
adopted this methodology to improve the performance of 
homogeneous cellular networks. The optimization targets 
the power control and the user association. Finally, in [15] a 
Gibbs sampler-based mechanism has been applied to 
perform joint optimization in heterogeneous networks.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, a description of the system model and the definition of the 
notation used throughout the text are given. The optimization 
model and the algorithm formulation are presented in 
Section III. In Section IV, the simulation model along with 
the evaluation of the algorithm performance are presented. 
Finally, important conclusions and the future work are given 
in Section V.  
II. SYSTEM MODEL  
The system model of this work consists of a cellular 
network where 𝑁 Base Stations are spatially divided in three 
sectors (cells) with the use of directional antennas, resulting 
in a set of cells 𝑋.  
Users are randomly distributed in the scenario and each 
user is associated with the cell with which experiences the 
minimum Path Loss described by the following equation:

where 𝜙𝑢,𝑥 and 𝜃𝑢,𝑥 are the azimuth and elevation angles, 
respectively, between user u and cell x. Moreover, Φ and Θ 
are the azimuth and downtilt orientations of the antennas, 
respectively,  Δ𝜙 is the horizontal antenna beam width, Δ𝜃 is 
the vertical antenna beam width and 𝐵𝑜  is the backward 
attenuation.  
The set of users that is associated with cell 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 is 
denoted as 𝑈𝑥 . Each user is classified as inner or outer 
according to a Path Loss Threshold 𝐿𝑡ℎ that is related to the 
inner cell range Rin as follows:

                   (4) 
Specifically, a user u associated to cell x belongs to the 
inner part of the cell if its path loss Lu,x is lower than Lth . 
Otherwise, it belongs to the outer part of the cell. Note that 
𝐿𝑡ℎ is the average path loss that it would be observed by a 
user located at distance Rin in the direction of maximum 
radiated power by the antenna  𝜙𝑢,𝑥 = Φ and 𝜃𝑢,𝑥 =  Θ. As 
such, the set of users is further split into the inner set 𝑈𝑥,𝑖𝑛 
and the outer set 𝑈𝑥,𝑜𝑢𝑡. Since the calculation of each users 
Path Loss includes also the Shadowing, the consideration of 
a user being inner or outer is not only related to its distance 
from the base station, but it also accounts for the randomness 
in the propagation that is inherent to practical wireless 
scenarios. 
Let us consider a set of 𝐶 frequency channels or sub-
bands to be shared among the set of  𝑋 cells. The bandwidth 
of each channel c∈C is Bc. For simplicity reasons we assume 
that each cell can be assigned only one channel for the inner 
and another one for the outer part; however this work can be 
easily extended to assign a group of frequencies to each cell. 
Then, at a given point of time each cell 𝑥 is characterized by 
its state 𝑐𝑥 = (𝑐𝑥,𝑖𝑛, 𝑐𝑥,𝑜𝑢𝑡)  that is given by the channel 
𝑐𝑥,𝑖𝑛 ∈ 𝐶 assigned to the inner part and the channel 𝑐𝑥,𝑜𝑢𝑡 ∈
𝐶 assigned to the outer part. In order to avoid that the same 
channel is shared by inner and outer users the allocation will 
ensure that different channels are assigned to the inner and 
the outer parts, that is 𝑐𝑥,𝑖𝑛 ≠ 𝑐𝑥,𝑜𝑢𝑡 . 
Moreover, we consider that the transmit power of a 
given cell x in channel 𝑐  is:

where 𝑃𝑥,𝑖𝑛 and  𝑃𝑥,𝑜𝑢𝑡 are the transmit power (in W) of cell 
𝑥 for the inner and the outer parts, respectively.  
Based on the above, the Signal to Interference and Noise 
Ratio (SINR) for an inner user 𝑢𝑥,𝑖𝑛 ∈ 𝑈𝑥,𝑖𝑛  of cell 𝑥 is then 
expressed by the following equation:

Loss (in linear units) of user 𝑢𝑥 with its serving cell 𝑥 and 
with the interfering cell 𝑘. 
We assume that the bandwidth of one channel in the 
inner/outer part is equally shared between all users of the 
inner/outer part. This would correspond to, e.g., a round 
robin scheduling. In that case, the total capacity (b/s) seen 
by an inner user of cell 𝑥 (using Shannon capacity) is:

The target of this work is to find the optimal allocation of 
frequencies to the inner and the outer parts of the cells (i.e. 
the optimal cell states cx) that results in the minimization of 
the network inter-cell interference and thus, it enhances the 
capacity. 
For 
this 
purpose 
a 
Gibbs 
sampler-based 
methodology is proposed. In the following Section, a 
thorough description of the optimization model is given. 
III. GIBBS SAMPLER FOR CHANNEL ALLOCATION 
The Gibbs Sampler uses the notion of energy function 
which is the optimization target and thus it should be 
defined in accordance with each specific problem [12]. 
Therefore, 
the 
following 
sub-sections 
present 
the 
formulation of the energy function considered in this paper 
for minimizing the ICI in accordance with the system model 
defined in previous section, and the distributed Gibbs-
sampler based algorithm to achieve the minimization.  
A. Optimization Model  
The target of the proposed optimization approach is to 
find the states 𝑐𝑥 (i.e. the channel allocation) for each cell 
that minimize the overall inter-cell interference. For that 
purpose, we define the global energy to be minimized as the 
total interference of the network which will be the sum of 
the total noise and the interference measured by all the cells:

The local energy function actually includes the

experience from the other cells if cell 𝑥 state is 𝑐𝑥 (second

will cause to the neighboring cells (third term of the 
equation).

The minimization of the energy function given by (9) is 
achieved by means of the execution of the procedure 
indicated in the algorithm presented in Figure 2 at each cell.

Assuming that the system starting time is t=0, each cell is 
assigned with an exponentially distributed timer with mean 
𝑡𝑎. When a cell’s timer expires, the algorithm is executed 
and the state 𝑐𝑥  selection (i.e. the set of channels 
(𝑐𝑥,𝑖𝑛, 𝑐𝑥,𝑜𝑢𝑡)) is carried out by sampling a random variable 
λ using the probability distribution of (16). The latter 
represents the probability of selecting state cx among the set 
of all possible states denoted as CS. The set CS includes all 
the combinations  ൫𝑐𝑥,𝑖𝑛, 𝑐𝑥,𝑜𝑢𝑡൯ composed by 𝑐𝑥,𝑖𝑛 ∈ 𝐶 and 
𝑐𝑥,𝑜𝑢𝑡 ∈ 𝐶 with 𝑐𝑥,𝑖𝑛 ≠ 𝑐𝑥,𝑜𝑢𝑡.

above favors the lower energy states and with 𝑇 → 0 it will 
converge to a steady state that minimizes the global 
interference.  
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
The performance of the proposed algorithm has been 
evaluated by means of system level simulations. In this 
section we present the simulation model and the parameters 
used, as well as the most important results.  
A. Simulation scenario and parameters 
The cellular network deployment consists of 4 tri-
sectorial base stations, thus having a total of 12 cells, as 
depicted in Figure 3. The set of channels that can be assigned 
are C ={f0,f1,f2,f3} with the restriction that 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑡 ≠ 𝑐𝑖𝑛 . As 
such, there is a total of 12 possible states to be selected for 
each cell. Figure 3 depicts the classical PFR scheme that is 
used as reference for the comparison and evaluation of the 
results. Moreover, for the Gibbs sampler-based algorithm it 
is assumed that the initial allocation considered in the 
beginning of each simulation is also the one shown in Figure 
3. 
Each cell serves 10 users uniformly distributed in a 
circular area with range R=1 km. The total simulation time is 
12000·ta and the simulation step is ta/24. T0 is set to 0.7 and 
the energy values in (15) are given in dBW. Simulations are 
performed for different values of the inner cell range Rin. 
 
Figure 3: System Topology and frequency assignment for the reference 
case 
 The outer transmit power (𝑃𝑥,𝑜𝑢𝑡) is kept constant to 43 
dBm in all the simulations, while the inner transmit power 
(𝑃𝑥,𝑖𝑛) is set according to the inner cell range (equivalently 
Lth) as follows:

The rationality of this expression is to have the same average 
received power level for an outer user located at a distance 
equal to the cell range R and for an inner user located at a 
distance equal to the inner cell range Rin. 
The rest of simulation parameters are indicated in Table I.

B. Numerical Results 
We evaluate our scenario under two different criteria. In 
the first part, an analysis of the performance of the algorithm 
is given according to the energy reduction (interference 
minimization) it provides. Similarly, in the second part, we 
analyze the effect of the proposed algorithm to the network 
and edge user capacity. Additional information will be 
presented related to the performance of the algorithm in 
terms of convergence and feasibility for real time execution.  
It has to be noted that for each inner cell range the result 
is the average of 500 experiments with different random user

distributions. For the comparison of the results we use as 
reference the PFR scheme presented in Figure 2. 
1. Global Energy Reduction: Figure 4 shows the 
comparison of the global energy (in dBW) between the 
proposed solution and the reference scheme of Figure 3, 
where the Gibbs Sampler is not applied.  
 
Figure 4: Global Energy 
By studying the behavior of the energy, one can notice 
that there is a significant benefit from the execution of the 
algorithm, especially when considering inner cell ranges 
from 400 m and above. The highest gain of 13.43 dB is 
observed for the range of 900 m, while the average gain for 
all the inner cell ranges is 8.47 dB. If we focus on the 
reference scheme, it can be seen that the inner parts of all the 
cells of the network are assigned the same frequency (f0). As 
such, the amount of the interference that these users 
experience, especially for high inner cell ranges, is quite 
high. This justifies the increasing behavior of the global 
energy when increasing the inner cell range. However, after 
the execution of the algorithm, the inner parts are assigned 
different frequencies resulting in this way in a significant 
interference reduction. It can also be observed that the global 
energy level for inner cell ranges above approximately 500m 
is kept at a very similar level. 
2. Capacity Improvement: The benefits of the proposed 
PFR algorithm in ICI reduction are also reflected in terms of 
capacity improvement. This can be observed in Figure 5 that 
shows the average capacity for the users located at the cell 
edge, which are those more sensitive to ICI. For this 
computation, users are considered to be at the cell edge if 
they are located at a distance above 0.9R (note that edge 
users can be outer or inner users depending on the considered 
inner cell range in each simulation and also depending on 
shadowing conditions). As it is reflected from the figure, the 
edge user capacity is significantly improved compared to the 
classic PFR scheme. The maximum gain is observed for the 
inner cell range of 900 m, which reaches a capacity increase 
of 17%, and the average gain for all the inner cell ranges is 
11.64%. 
Furthermore, Figure 6 shows the comparison in terms of 
average capacity per user taking into consideration all the 
users in the cell. Similarly to the edge users, the highest gain 
is observed for the inner cell range of 900 m and reaches the 
value of 42.67%. The average gain in this case is 22.53%. 
It can also be observed in Figure 5 and Figure 6 that, 
while the maximum average user capacity occurs for an 
inner cell range of 400m, when considering cell edge users, 
the maximum occurs for larger values. This is due to the fact 
that, for large inner cell ranges, in addition to the ICI 
reduction brought by the algorithm, the edge users share the 
available capacity with fewer users, since the outer area is 
reduced. Then, the optimal setting of the inner cell range 
would result from the trade-off between average and cell-
edge capacity, in accordance with network operator policies.

3. Convergence of the algorithm: In order to analyze the 
convergence of the algorithm, in this work we consider that 
the algorithm is executed either until a convergence criterion 
or the total simulation time (12000·ta) is reached. The 
convergence criterion in this paper is that all the cells have 
reached a selection probability according to (16) above 0.99 
for one of the possible states (then this state determines the 
assigned frequencies).  
In Figure 7, we present the average number of the 
experiments that have met the convergence criterion of this 
paper as a result from the execution of 500 experiments for 
each inner cell range. It can be noticed that above the 400 m 
a significant amount of experiments has met the criterion. 
For smaller inner ranges however, it can be seen that this 
number very small. This was expected, since for these ranges 
the number of inner users is very small and in some cases 
there are cells with no inner users. Correspondingly, there 
exist actually multiple solutions that are optimal (e.g., for a 
cell without inner users the allocation of the inner channel 
does not affect the received inter-cell interference). In these 
situations, it has been observed that the algorithm does not 
converge towards a high probability for a given state but it 
keeps similar probability levels for all the optimum states. A 
similar effect is also observed for the larger cell ranges in the

particular cases that the convergence criterion is not met. The 
algorithm keeps similar probabilities for some states that 
exhibit the lowest energy. This behavior reflects the good 
operation of the algorithm.

Figure 8: Global Energy Evolution 
Another important aspect to evaluate the performance of 
the algorithm is the required number of executions in order 
to reach convergence. In that respect, Figure 8 presents the 
time evolution of the global energy of a random experiment, 
until the convergence criterion was met. In this particular 
experiment the algorithm reached convergence after 19 
executions. Moreover, as it can be seen from the figure, the 
reduction of the energy is carried out continuously during 
the simulation time, suggesting this way the possibility of 
the online implementation of the algorithm. 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper we have proposed a new distributed 
algorithm based on Gibbs sampling that performs dynamic 
channel allocation in a PFR cellular deployment. Through 
simulations it has been proved that the proposed solution 
outperforms the classical PFR scheme in terms of 
interference and capacity. Results have shown the reduction 
of the network interference of up to 13 dB. Moreover, the 
proposed 
scheme 
provides 
a 
significant 
capacity 
improvement for the edge users with gains up to 17%, and 
up to 42.67% when considering the average capacity of all 
the users in the cell. 
Further details about the specific implementation are 
envisaged as part of our future work, including the 
measurements involved and the information exchange 
between cells. Moreover, future work is envisaged to include 
the capacity optimization explicitly in the formulation, as 
well as the extension of the algorithm to adjust the transmit 
power of the cell. Finally, heterogeneous networks will be 
investigated, including macro and small cells.
