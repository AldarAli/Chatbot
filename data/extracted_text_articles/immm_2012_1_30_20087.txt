Abstract—Computer networks augment in heterogeneity so 
that defining a normal behavior to the network becomes a 
severe challenge. Particularly, such a normal network behavior 
is essential for security issues. In addition, this behavior 
consolidates the intrusion detection system to significantly 
detect zero-day-attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce 
a novel dependability model based on the correlation matrix of 
network features.  Moreover, only strongly correlated features 
are involved in the model such that the normal connections are 
recognized into the online traffic in advance. The recognition is 
based on the distance of the incoming traffic to the linear 
association between the correlated features. Furthermore, the 
distance is compared to a threshold value to ensure correct 
recognition. These steps have been evaluated by the 
benchmark dataset NSL-KDD.  The goal of this model is to 
build an adaptive normal network behavior that represents the 
intended network continuously, reduces the overhead on the 
classification, and supports by detecting unknown attacks 
respectively. The results show that the idea of dependability 
model in intrusion detection system promises more accuracy 
and preciseness in anomaly detection.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) approaches can be 
classified into misuse detection and anomaly detection [1], 
misuse detection systems are using signatures to detect 
known attack patterns. However, they are suffering under the 
constantly growing number of signatures and incapability of 
detecting unknown attacks as well. In contrast, anomaly 
based intrusion detection systems are able to detect known 
and even unknown attacks by recognizing the deviation from 
the normal network behavior. Accordingly, there are two 
main approaches to characterize normal network behavior 
presented in [2], which are studying the inference of the 
overall network behavior through the use of network probes 
and the understanding of the behavior of the individual 
entities or nodes. Principally, IDS analyzes and studies the 
network traffic to establish a profile that defines a normal 
network behavior (NNB). Upon this profile, the IDS can 
detect any deviation as an anomaly and consider it most 
likely an attack. Presenting a significant and heuristic model 
that defines the normal behavior is imperative the area of 
networking. Therefore, we present a novel model that 
defines a NNB by building a dependability model from the 
strength of features correlations. The main idea is to capture 
the online traffic in the real time and match the traffic to the 
dependability model to investigate its normality. Moreover, 
for the positive strong correlations between two features a 
linear association is defined to the best fit of the concerned 
features. This is to imply that, when two feature vectors are 
strongly correlated there is significant of determination that 
ensures a linear association between these features. Thus, 
such relation can be exploited to determine the normality in 
the incoming traffic based on the linearity of correlated 
features. The dependability model can then be updated with 
the new normal traffic. This paper is structured as following; 
in section II, a motivation about the proposed methods in 
normal network behavior is discussed. On the hand, section 
III presents our novel methodology. Section IV describes the 
preparation of dataset. Section V illustrates our results and 
discussion. Finally, section VI concludes our work.      
II. 
MOTIVATION 
Intrusion detection system steps are summarized into 
feature 
selection, 
discretization, 
normalization, 
and 
classification. Regarding classification the IDS builds a 
normal profile of the network and detect the deviation from 
this profile.  
A real time visualization platform in [3] presents a 
multiple visualization techniques that provide a situational 
understanding of real time network activity. Such platform 
can visualize million of records and report the network 
current status. However, it may not feasible in IDS research 
area. On the other hand, [4] proposed a modeling approach 
where failures and repairs of network components as well as 
routing and traffic handling are described by a set of 
stochastic activity networks (SAN). The proposed model 
approach serves more in the area of network routing and 
availability of end-to-end network components. However, it 
could be exploited to build a normal network behavior.  
A significant work [5] explained a correlated node 
behavior model based on Markov process [19] for dynamic 
topology network. Thus, the latter classified the nodes into 
four categories and show that the effect from correlated 
failure nodes on network survivability is much severer than

other misbehaviors. However, this approach is investigating 
network nodes and builds a behavioral model accordingly.  
A reasonably network behavior tool in [6] exploits only the 
internal network traffic to monitor the internal activities on 
network so that a deviation from a predefined pattern model 
is detected as abnormal behavior. This model aims to detect 
anomaly indeed but it examines only the internal traffic.  
A structural model in [7] utilizes web logs to analyze 
user behavior based on the web-context and situation-
awareness. Obviously, this model focused only on the user 
activities and ignores the network ones. More sufficient 
proposals regarding analysis of system behavior are 
proposed in [8],[9], and [10].  
So, defining a novel model for normal network behavior 
is needed. Therefore, we principally focus on the network 
traffic to build such a model and express it as linear 
relations.    
III. 
PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 
In this research work, we concentrate on the definition of 
a normal network behavior, based on its traffic, which 
represents the network. In contrast to [14], we build a 
dependability model graph based on the correlation matrix to 
define a normal network behavior and to predict the normal 
connection in real time. Thus, the proposed idea in this work 
exploits network traffic statistics to build a dependability 
model from the feature correlations; that is, from correlation 
matrix. In addition, the model will be able to detect normal 
connections based on the linear association between the 
correlated features. However, selecting the most valuable 
features out of hundreds of network features is a provocation 
step. Hence we declare the proposed idea in three steps: 
A. Significant Network Features 
 Selection of the valuable features in the area of IDS is a 
negotiable point in data mining research. Thus, we used the 
improved feature selection method proposed in [11]. It 
presented a novel method that abstracted the valuable 
features in the network based on the sequential backward 
search and information gain. The difference between both 
feature sets is that features in the most valuable feature set 
affect definitely the detection rate, whereas features in the 
most valuable and relevant feature set affect definitely the 
detection rate and enhance it, i.e. 
MVF  MVRF
. Moreover, 
the model has been evaluated on the benchmark dataset 
NSL-KDD [18]. The exploited features are summarized in 
Table I.

 In principal, we build the dependability model from the 
strongly correlated features of these feature sets and hence 
define a normal behavior for the network.  
B. Correlation and  Dependability Model 
Network traffic has several features, which are somehow 
sharing an association. One of the most known methods to 
infer these associations is the correlation between features; 
that is, the correlation is used to determine the degree of 
association between two features [12]. Hence, let us define 
two network features (vectors) X and Y, which are normally 
distributed, such that X={x1,..., xn} and Y={y1,…,yn} where 
nN, xi, yi   . Then the Pearson’s correlation coefficient is

 are the mean values of feature X and feature Y, 
respectively.  The correlation value between two features 
falls between [-1,+1], so that the more positive the value, the 
more significant the linear association. Thus, the correlation 
matrix established for m network features F1,..,Fm can be 
built as 
Corr F1,..,Fm =

The correlation matrix is a symmetrical one, and the 
correlation value of the same feature is always  +1. Other 
values of  rij could be positive or negative, e.g. 0.8 means 
that 80% of the changes in one feature are related to the 
other. On the other hand, the coefficient of determination R2 
(or 
2
ijr ) of the two features Fi and Fj means that the 
percentage of variability in one feature related to variability 
to the other feature. In addition, R2 gives the proportion of 
the variance of one feature explained by the other [13], e.g., 
if the value of the coefficient determination is 0.8 that 
indicates about 80% of the variance of one variable is 
explained by the other. Furthermore, it ensures about the 
prediction of the feature y  (predicted y) from the linear 
association instead of the mean value. Therefore, we 
consider the value of coefficient of determination to assure 
linear association between features. Consequently, only the 
strongly correlated features, which reject the null hypothesis 
0

, are considered in this research work. The Greek 
symbol rho is the parameter used for nonlinear correlation. 
However, the null hypothesis is the most common used with 
Pearson’s correlation coefficient [20] such that the 
16

correlation coefficient is zero and there is no linear 
association between the two variables. In this regard, we use 
the critical P-value with 0.05 of making error type 1 to check 
whether the correlation value between two features rejects 
the null hypothesis and have a linear association as well or 
not. Accordingly, we abstract precisely only the significant 
linear association between the strong correlated features.  
C. Linear Association and Prediction 
If two network features are strongly correlated, then they 
have a linear association that describes their correlation. The 
linear association between two strongly correlated features 
X={x1,..., xn} and Y={y1,…,yn} can be defined as

where 
0
 is the intercept and 
1
 is the slope. The idea of least 
squares is exploited to find the choice of slope and intercept 
that give the best fit among the data points. In addition, the 
parameter 
i is the normally distributed random error. In this 
research paper we abstract the linear line to the best fitting of 
the scatter data, i.e., the association is definitely not 100% 
linear, so that a percentage of error in the linearity and 
prediction is expected as well. Hence, suppose we have a 
pair (xi,yi) that is not fitting exactly on the linear line, so we 
can determine the distance of the point to the line as in [17], 
such that

The distance from the linear line will be used to check if 
the incoming online traffic belongs to the linearity between 
the correlated two features or not based on a certain 
threshold, mainly the maximum distance dmax.  
 In brief, we select the valuable and significant network 
features, infer the correlation values between them, establish 
a correlation matrix, indicate the strong positive correlation 
values via rejecting the null hypothesis, find out the best 
fitting linear line between each two correlated features, and 
then detect, for the online traffic, the normal connections 
based on the distance from the linear line. Finally, detected 
normal connections will be used to rebuild the model. 
For example, suppose we have three network features 
namely F1, F2, and F3 and the values belonging to these 
features are shown in Table II.

 Both matrices are symmetric so that the lower region 
with (…) is the same as the upper region. Obviously, the 
correlation between F1 and F2 has a P-value with 0.009, i.e., 
the P-value<0.05 so that the null hypothesis is rejected at 5% 
significant level. Whereas, other correlation values have P-
values greater than 0.05 which imply that no linear 
association is existed between them. Therefore, only one 
linear association is existed with an intercept of 0.0058 and a 
slope value of 0.095. Moreover, the maximum distance from 
the pairs to the line is 0.0053. Figure 1 shows the plot of this 
example.  
 
Figure 1.  Linear Association between the features in the example. 
Accordingly, if we receive a new feature instance in real 
time such that the values of F1, F2, and F3 are {0.2, 0.1, 0.1} 
respectively then we need to calculate the distance between 
the pair (0.2,0.1) and the linear line then compare it to dmax 
value.   
IV. 
DATASET PREPARATION 
To evaluate our proposed method, we build a test 
computer network, so that only clean traffic will be 
aggregated. Hence, no external connections are allowed and 
no any USB devices will be plugged. We aggregate the 
traffic based on the feature set MVRF in Table I. On the 
other hand, a dataset with only the normal traffic from NSL-
KDD is generated to establish a correlation matrix from the 
positively correlated features and those have linear 
association. Furthermore, from the correlated features a 
dependability model will be designed so that only features 
with linear association are conducted. According to the test 
network, we could abstract up to 15 features from the MVRF 
and still struggling to achieve the rest ones. Therefore, we 
will first test and evaluate our proposal with the normal 
traffic from NSL-KDD and discuss our results. 
Generally, we cannot just filter a dataset out from NSL-
KDD and calculate a Pearson’s correlation coefficient, but 
we should digitize it and then normalize it. To achieve such 
numeric and normalized dataset we exploit the hybrid 
normalization method in [15] to map the nominal values into 
numeric and then normalize the dataset using minimum 
maximum normalization.  Thus, a minimum maximum 
normalization is defined as

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
To evaluate the novelty of the proposed method, we 
exploited the NSL-KDD, so that only normal traffic is 
abstracted and then the dataset is normalized. The selected 
features in our evaluation are the MVRF. Hence, a dataset 
with 65555 normal instances is initialized for testing and 
evaluation.  In the following table these features are 
numbered to ease the explanation of our results.

 According to the evaluated dataset MVRF, we calculate 
the correlation between 19 features, see Table III. Then 
determine the coefficient of determination, so that only the 
best linear association between features is considered. Table 
IV shows the positive correlated features from the correlation 
matrix, so that the correlation rejects the null hypothesis, 
(also, the linear equation associated between these features).

In addition, these equations represent the network traffic 
when the network is in its normal behavior. Of course, one of 
the drawbacks of NSL-KDD is that there is no 100% 
linearity between the correlated features. Therefore, we 
expect an error (false positive) when detecting the incoming 
online traffic based on these equations. Figure 2 shows a 
linear relation between two features. Based on this figure, 
most of the data fit on the linear line and other are on the 
area around, so we can consider the points on the line or 
nearby are only the related ones to this equation. To do so, a 
maximum distance must be determined and an error value 
must be defined such as dmax ≤ 0.5   and 
i  ≈ 0.0005 where 
dmax  is determined from {(Pointmax –Pointmin)/2} and because 
the dataset is normalized then Pointmax = 1 and Pointmin = 0. 
We found after testing several cases that the maximum 
distance is the average between the minimum point and 
maximum point from the normalized dataset. On the other 
hand, the error is selected manually to a small value to avoid 
incorrect distance calculation.

In contrast, Figure 3 shows more stable linear association 
between the feature protocol_type and logged_in so that a 
better detection is expected.

The figure shows few points because the value of the 
feature logged_in is mostly 1 or 0, so that several points are 
overwritten. Maximum distance is calculated from the 
longest distance to the line.  
Moreover, although some correlated features have a high 
value of coefficient of determination, they could have no 
adequate linear association. Therefore, we prune the 
association with a small value of error and ignore the point 
on the border to achieve better linearity. So, we have derived 
various linear equations from the correlated features. 
Therefore, we present a dependability model that shows the 
correlated features and hence their dependencies (correlation 
coefficient values). Intuitively, the concerned pairs from 
online traffic will be matched to the related linear line. 
Figure 4 depicts a general dependability model of the MVRF 
that represents the normal network behavior based on the 
offline dataset NSL-KDD.  
 
Figure 4.  Dependability model of MVRF. 
This model implies that, these features are strongly 
correlated when the network traffic is normal. That means, 
based on the benchmark dataset NSL-KDD and the selected 
feature set MVRF, this model can be used to analyze the 
online traffic directly and detect the normal connections or 
the abnormal ones. Generally, the online traffic is prepared 
so that firstly the distance from the pair (rerror_rate, 
srv_rerror_rate) and the linear line

is calculated and 
compared to the value of dmax. In the last step, distances must 
be evaluated so that all must fulfill the condition d ≤ dmax. 
Finally, if the online traffic is detected as normal it will be 
considered in the dataset to adjust the linearity accordingly, 
such that the dependability model stays adaptive. 
To test this model and the proposed idea of detecting the 
normal traffic in real time, we selected arbitrary instances 
from the NSL-KDD dataset so that two instances are normal 
and the third is anomaly. We calculated the distances as 
defined before. Moreover, the error value is fixed to 0.0005 
for all linear lines just to ease the calculation of all distances.  
The instances are shown in Table V, instances values are 
sorted the same way as in Table III. Moreover, Table VI 
depicts the detection result for the test instances. It proved 
that the proposed idea could detect all instances significantly 
based on the distance from the linear line.

the linear line between the correlated features; they are 
sorted according to the strong linearity in descending order. 
Moreover, dmax is the maximum distance for each linear line 
between features, d means in the table the distance of this 
instance from the linear line, as mentioned before, the 
concerned pair from each instance is selected for the suitable

Obviously, the distances of instance1 are all minimum 
than the maximum distance of each linear association, so it is 
a normal traffic. In contrast, instance3 has two distances (in 
bold) greater than the maximum distance in the linear line for 
the intended correlated features, which is lead to predict this 
traffic as anomaly. Therefore, the new detected normal 
instances will be added to the normal dataset so that a new 
linear line and dependability model with a roughly modified 
correlation values will be enhanced.  
Principally, we focus in this paper on the idea of 
dependability model and how it represents the normal 
network behavior. Hence, to declare this idea we have 
introduced a test and evaluation example from an offline 
dataset. But we have explained how to use this idea to 
predict online normal traffic using the distance threshold.  
Another main discussion point is the linearity between 
features. We notice that when the dataset increases the 
features are not more correlated and they lose the linearity. 
The association between these features becomes nonlinear. 
Therefore, in the incoming research work we will exploit the 
idea in [16], so that a nonlinear association between features

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Defining a normal network behavior is a necessary step 
in intrusion detection system. However, it is a challenge 
under research in the data mining area. In this research work, 
we present a novel dependability model from the positive 
correlations between network features. In addition, we 
abstract the linear associations between these correlated 
features and exploit them to predict the normal connection 
from the online traffic in the real time. The prediction is 
examined so that each features pair from the online traffic 
instance is exploited to calculate their distance from the 
linear line related to these pair exclusively. Furthermore, all 
distances of all feature pairs in the online traffic must be 
greater than the threshold distance (dmax) to consider it a 
linear connection. Our test results show that the model could 
detect the normal connection and anomaly as well from test 
dataset NSL-KDD. In addition, we looked to enhance the 
model by examine the nonlinear association in large dataset. 
Finally, we proved that the dependability model can 
represents the normal network behavior and can support the 
IDS to detect the attacks in online traffic. Therefore, it 
promises more accuracy, less overhead in classification, and 
enhancement in network performance.
