Abstract - This article presents a subject to debate the question 
of the role of learner-interface interaction in distance 
education. This role is considered in the aspect of possibilities 
of distance learning in the three main areas of human 
perception: cognitive, psychophysical and emotional. The 
results are of the first phase of a study conducted by the 
authors on the impact of learner-interface interaction in web-
based training on the result achieved, including training 
courses in ICT students at the University of Forestry - Sofia. 
Keywords - web-based distance education; learner-interface 
interaction; interactive communication

INTRODUCTION 
Traditional forms of education meet the needs of young 
people at a time when it was possible to envisage with 
relative security the knowledge and skills that they would 
need in their adult lives. Today this is not so. Young people 
can no longer expect to spend their entire lives in the same 
economic sector or even on the same place; their career paths 
will change in a way that cannot be foreseen and they will 
need a wide range of generic skills that will allow them to 
adapt. In a more increasingly complex and globalized world, 
creativity, the ability to think versatile, skills into different 
areas and adaptability as a trend are valued more than 
specific knowledge. This led to the development of the 
concept of education and becoming more widely available 
web-based 
distance 
learning 
courses 
in 
educational 
institutions. Offering e-learning courses is important for the 
survival of the modern educational institution [8]. 
Web-based distance education cannot be implemented 
without the use of the capabilities of modern information and 
communication technologies. This is reflected in the 
adoption in 2010 by the European Council Strategy "Europe 
2020" [5], which focuses on active and effective use of the 
opportunities of modern information and communication 
technologies for the realization of the idea of widely 
available, tailored to individual needs, continuing lifelong 
quality education, which all are given equal opportunities to 
acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for successful 
social and professional realization. 
The purpose of this paper is to suggest the issue of 
discussion about the role of learner-interface interaction in 
distance education. In our opinion, this interaction is 
important for the improvement of personal achievements in 
the training of individuals, and hence becomes significant for 
the quality of the education received. The article presents a 
theoretical framework, a methodology of research and a 
discussion on the submitted results. 
II. 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND 
METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH 
The analysis is based on the adoption of the following 
theoretical framework: 
• Keegan [2] defines distance education as a system 
characterized by: 1) the separation of the teacher from 
the learner through a large part of the learning 
process, 2) the impact of the educational organization, 
3) provide an opportunity to assess and self-assess of 
the learners, 4) the use of educational media for the 
presentation of course content, and 5) two-way 
communication between teacher and student [2]. 
• Hillman, Willis and Gunawardena [1] added learner-
interface interaction as an integral part of the concept 
of distance learning. This is the interaction that occurs 
between the learner and the technology used to 
provide educational content. They claim that the skills 
of the learner to handle with communication 
environment is a necessary condition to participate in 
distance learning course and is positively correlated 
with success in this course. To acquire knowledge of 
the course content, the student must be proficient in 
the technological environment for communication 
and interaction [1]. 
• According to Belanger and Jordan [3] learning 
objectives relate to three main areas of human 
perception: cognitive, psychophysical and emotional. 
• We 
considered 
Gestalt 
psychology 
(meaning 
integrity, 
shape, 
configuration, 
connectivity 
components, closeness, etc.), established in the early 
decades of the 20th century by Max Wertheimer [9], 
who studies perception as a single image and the 
characteristics of the education. 
Web-based distance education is learning that takes place 
via the Internet or Intranet. A Web-browser is mostly used in 
this type of training, such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. 
Each training program that uses the Internet as a technology 
for 
delivering 
learning 
materials, 
even 
e-mail 
correspondence and transfer of files belonging to this type of 
distance education [11]. 
Let us consider in more detail the possibilities of distance 
learning in the three main areas of human perception. 
The cognitive domain is divided into six main 
categories 
of 
learning 
objectives: 
knowledge, 
307

comprehension, 
application, 
analysis, 
synthesis 
and 
evaluation. Each category is based on the requirements and 
characteristics of the category before it, and each category 
consists of sub categories. Tasks in the cognitive domain can 
be achieved relatively easily, using technology and distance 
education through interaction student-learning content. 
Psychophysical area focuses on physical skills, 
manipulation of objects or other physical activities that 
require muscle coordination. This area is best expressed for 
example in speech, physical condition, operating machinery 
or technical courses, which require a physical activity. 
Multimedia technologies are successfully used to train 
physical skills - such as aircraft simulators make people learn 
from their mistakes, which in a real environment may cause 
a lot. 
Emotional domain is focused on individual preferences 
for perception and processing of information. As Confucius 
said, "I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I 
understand". Here is the key role of the interactions between 
the participants in the educational process - teachers, 
learners, learning content and interface. 
Today, the majority of platforms for web-based distance 
education 
for 
communication, 
assessment 
and 
self-
assessment are set tools that are widely used in social 
networking as "Blogs", "Journal", "discussion board" and 
others. This is in order to facilitate perception of the interface 
by the learner. However, it must be taken into account that 
the social networks, although popular, are used by less than 
half of the population. 
Interactive communication, which is basically a web-
based distance education involves the creation of a dynamic 
area, changing space, specific navigation, depending on the 
preferences of the learner, dynamic design, use of specific 
computer code into high level language, mobile technologies 
and constant innovations [10]. Things at each visit of the 
user are different, depending on his skills gathered 
information on the system and knowledge of the interests 
and orientation. Three categories of interactivity are 
distinguished: 
• The first category is a navigation interactivity that 
allows the student to move through the pages of 
learning content using the appropriate hyperlinks. 
• The second category of functional interactivity allows 
the student to interact with other users, and receive 
news, are used especially discussion forums, blog and 
e-mail. 
• Third 
category 
adapted 
interactivity 
allows 
customization of the site and the browser, depending 
on the specific consumer preferences. 
If the difficulty in interaction student-interface loses the 
benefits 
of 
interactive 
communication 
- 
generating 
knowledge through exchange of ideas and use of a number 
of modern, digital media and technologies for data 
transmission and combination of electronic processes [7]. 
Interactive communication ensures active participation of 
those students who do not normally express their ideas 
openly [6]. 
The learner should understand and be able to work with 
the technologies used in the training course. When there is 
incomprehension of the technological realization of a web-
based distance education and the inability of the student to 
work in such an environment, learner-interface interaction is 
difficult. As a result, only navigation interactivity is most 
often used. When the interface impedes the learner achieves 
the best case, only learner-content interaction. 
According to the Gestalt psychology in the field of 
consciousness there are two contexts - figure and 
background, and the figure is always clearer, cleaner, more 
detached, more obvious are its limits. The background looks 
like continuation of the figure but is darker, more distant, 
less supportive the figure. Under the law for centering the 
mind is centered on a figure work with it and focused on it. It 
is not possible for the entire contents of consciousness, to 
accept the role of figure. 
When the interface impedes the learner, he assumes the 
role of the figure, the training itself becomes background. 
Essential educational elements of distance learning as 
interaction with all members of the school community 
(student-teacher among themselves students), initiating 
creative activity manifestation of the student, the active 
construction 
of 
knowledge 
by 
means 
of 
two-way 
communication student and teacher are lost. A portion of set 
in the syllabi of the courses skills and habits cannot be 
developed by the learner. In this case, a small portion of the 
planned learning key skills and habits are acquired. 
 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The research was conducted for the student interaction 
interface in web-based distance learning on the result 
achieved, among training courses in ICT students in 
University of Forestry – Sofia, during the period October 
2013 - February 2014; the web-based platform Blackboard 
Learn [4] was used for the training. Both training courses 
include 
tools 
for 
interactive 
communication 
and 
conditionally display the following topics in the structure. 
The study was conducted in two target groups: students 
first course degree “Bachelor” and “Master degree” students.  
Activity of students in the "Master degree" is shown in 
Fig. 1 and activity of students in "Bachelor degree" in Fig. 2.

Students in "Bachelor degree" browsed educational 
content significantly longer than students in "Master degree". 
This can be explained by the fact that they are 1-st course 
and most of them do not have a system for the utilization of 
web-based interactive learning content presented. At the end 
of the course students responded to the questionnaire survey 
for the work with the system Blackboard Learn. The 
following section presents the questions and the results.

Respondents are 25% of the students first  degree 
"Bachelor’s degree and "Master’s" (a representative sample 
of the students in the UF). The results allow the following 
conclusions: 
• Students in degree "Master" encountered significantly 
less 
difficulty 
in 
learner-interface 
interaction, 
regardless of the type of learning resources. This 
allowed them to concentrate on learning of content 
and to achieve the final result with less time working 
in the system; 
• Both target groups haven't encountered serious 
difficulties in customizing their system accounts, the 
system in general, the access to the learning content 
type - file, URL, video, receiving news and updated 
information for the scores; 
• Significant differences for the difficulties encountered 
when working with assessment tools and interaction 
with other users; 
• The reason for the difficulties encountered and the 
two target groups mainly indicate the platform 
interface, only then insufficient skills to work with 
ICT; 
• Both target groups assess the impact of the use of the 
platform on the end result of the training and the 
knowledge obtained as a very strong and highly. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
In deciding on which technology to use for the realization 
of distance web-based training, must be given to the ease of 
use of this technology, i.e., whether users will be able to deal 
with it. 
Time of use of the platform for web-based education is 
not proportional to the achieved learning outcomes.  
The lack of difficulty in learner-interface interaction 
plays an important role in improving personal achievements 
in teaching individual learners. Achieved learning outcomes 
in this case affected only by the personal characteristics of 
the learner.

When properly structured and built, web-based learning  
content interaction learner-interface strongly influences the 
outcome of the training and quality of education. 
The study will continue by including students trained in 
the summer semester of the academic 2013/2014 year and 
will be repeated in the same target groups during the next 
two academic years. We hope that after its completion, we 
will be able to outline clear and definite trends, and the 
impact of learner-interface interaction in web-based distance 
learning on the outcome of the training and quality of 
education.
