Abstract—A
wideband
switching-mode
power
ampliﬁer
(SMPA) provides an optimum solution to cover multiple wireless
standards with high efﬁciency and a high level of integration
in a low-cost CMOS process. In this paper, a single-ended two-
stage PA operating at 2.5 GHz in 130 nm CMOS technology is
presented. The main-stage comprises a class-E PA based on ﬁnite
DC-feed inductance, which provides high output resistance and
can, therefore, cover a wide frequency range. A class-E driver
with interstage matching is used to drive the main-stage PA in
order to obtain large overall power gain with an optimum PA
performance. The main and the driver stages are operated at
3.3 V and 1.3 V, respectively. Simulations indicate that the PA
provides peak output power of 23.0 dBm and peak power added
efﬁciency (PAE) of 64.0 %. From 2.15 GHz to 3.1 GHz, an output
power of more than 20.5 dBm with a gain of 16.5 dB and PAE
of more than 50.0 % are simulated.

I. INTRODUCTION
The upcoming wireless technology is in motion to provide
high data rate with wider coverage capabilities. From mobile
equipment manufacturers perspective, this development brings
several challenges since these advancements are linked to high
power dissipation and high costs of the mobiles. Hence, it
demands the design of high performance circuits with high
efﬁciency to increase the battery life in a low cost CMOS
process. The power ampliﬁer (PA) is one of the most critical
components of the RF front-end as it is the most power hungry
element and deﬁnes the overall efﬁciency of a transceiver.
Improving PA efﬁciency signiﬁcantly impacts battery life and
thus a comprehensive effort is being made to implement highly
efﬁcient CMOS PAs [1].
Switching-mode power ampliﬁers (SMPAs) are nonlinear
class of PAs and have the capability to obtain high efﬁciency,
ideally 100 % at RF and microwave frequencies. The active
device is used as an ON/OFF switch such that for any time in-
stant, a nonoverlapping voltage and current exist at the device
output. Each class of SMPA, namely class-D [2], E [3], F [4]
and F−1 [5] requires speciﬁc harmonic impedance termination
at the output of the active device in order to prevent power
dissipation. This eventually limits the operational bandwidth
of a SMPA.
Introduction of next generation wireless communication
standards increases the demand on both mobile equipments
and base stations. A mobile terminal is required to cover
the existing and also the upcoming standards to reduce the
form factor and fabrication cost with minimum hardware
effort. Several approaches for multiple band coverage have
been proposed in literature. One solution is a multiband
multiharmonic LTN using transmission-lines and/or multiple
tuned LC circuits [6]- [7]. But, these are not feasible for
mobile terminals due to their huge chip area requirements and
the high associated cost.
The broadband design seems to be the most suitable ap-
proach to cover multiple bands which employs one active
device as a switch and a wideband LTN [8]. It does not require
any tuning element which results in an area efﬁcient LTN
and the PA can be fully integrated on-chip with a reasonable
amount of die area.
A class-E PA based on ﬁnite DC-feed inductance instead
of a conventional RF choke (RFC) provides wider bandwidth
because it offers a higher optimum resistance, RE, for the
same output power and supply voltage [9]. In this paper, a two
stage class-E PA using ﬁnite DC-feed inductance in 130 nm
CMOS technology is presented. The main-stage is driven with
a class-E PA to enhance the overall gain and PA efﬁciency. In
simulation, the circuit provides 23.0 dBm peak output power
with 64.0 % peak PAE. For a frequency range from 2.15 GHz
to 3.1 GHz, the ampliﬁer delivers an output power of 20.5 dBm
and PAE of more than 50.0 %.
II. CLASS-E POWER AMPLIFIER
The class-E PA exploits the soft-switching property to
provide high efﬁciency at high frequencies. It incorporates the
drain-source capacitance, CDS of the transistor in the LTN to
eliminate the power losses associated with its discharging over
the transistor in every RF cycle. This results in zero-voltage
switching (ZVS) and zero-derivative switching (ZDS) which
means at device turn on, there is no capacitor charge and no
capacitor current at the device output [3].

A. Load transformation network based on ﬁnite DC-feed in-
ductance
The equivalent circuit of a class-E LTN using ﬁnite DC-feed
inductance is shown in Fig. 1. The ZVS and ZDS conditions
can be fulﬁlled by using only the LCDS tank, whose resonant
frequency is 1.41 times the operating frequency, f0. The
operation principle along with the equations for RE, L and
CDS for a given output power, Pout, are detailed in [9]. The
load phase angle, Φ, at the device drain at f0 is given by:
Φ = tan−1
 RE
ω0L − ω0RECDS

= 34.24o ,
(1)
where impedances at all other harmonic frequencies are as-
sumed to be capacitive. The LCDS tank gives the accurate
load angle and, thus, one can obtain the nominal class-E output
waveforms at the transistor output. Since there is no imaginary
part in the LTN as compared to the typical class-E conditions
with an RFC, the optimum impedance can be written as:
ZE(nf0) =

RE (1 + j0) ,
if n = 1
∞,
if n = 2, 3, ..
(2)
A class-E PA using ﬁnite DC-feed inductance results in a
relatively high RE, which relaxes the impedance transforma-
tion ratio at f0 and, therefore, also allows wider bandwidth.
Secondly, the ﬁnite DC-feed inductor has a high self-resonance
frequency (fSR), which permits the designer to implement
PAs for high frequency applications. In addition, the inductors
can be integrated on-chip and, therefore, the total cost of the
PA may be reduced.
B. Optimised second harmonic load circuit
The inﬂuence of harmonic termination on ampliﬁer efﬁ-
ciency decrease with increasing order, whereas, second har-
monic theoretically has the highest impact on efﬁciency. In
order to ﬁlter out the second harmonic content, the parallel
tank, L2C2, resonating at 2f0 is added to the circuit in Fig. 1.
This leads to an optimised second harmonic load circuit for a
class-E PA [10], as shown in Fig. 2.
The parallel tank L2C2 is inductive at f0 and can be sized
using LCDS in combination with C1 to get the nominal
class-E conditions at f0. As L2C2 resonates at 2f0, the
value of L2 is smaller than the series inductance used in a
conventional class-E LTN. This is not only good for integration

III. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
Using the concept discussed in Section II, a two-stage
class-E PA was implemented. The design starts with a class-E
PA as a main-stage ampliﬁer followed by a class-E driver and
an interstage matching network.
A. Main-stage class-E PA
A class-E LTN with ﬁnite DC-feed inductance was designed
using Fig. 2 for an output power, Pout = 0.7 W at 2.5 GHz. The
transistor was biased at VDD1 = 3.3 V and VGS1 = 400 mV.
This leads to an RE of 21.5 Ω, L of 0.93 nH and CDS of
2.17 pF. The transistor was scaled to 2.3 mm for this design.
The output capacitance of this transistor is smaller than the
desired value, therefore, an external capacitance is added to
provide nominal class-E conditions.
The fundamental impedance at the transistor drain is sim-
ulated to be (27.0 + j 14.5) Ω, which corresponds to a load
angle, Φ = tan−1( 14.5
27.0) ≈ 28.2o, while other harmonics are
capacitive. The achieved impedances at the fundamental and
harmonic frequencies are in good comparison with the class-E
switching conditions as depicted in Fig. 3.
Peak PAE of 64.8 % and peak output power of 23.6 dBm are
simulated as shown in Fig. 4. The second and third harmonic
frequencies are suppressed by 26.8 dBc and 36.6 dBc, respec-
tively. Fig. 5 illustrates the simulated time-domain voltage and
current waveforms at the device output, which approximate
ideal class-E characteristics. In Fig. 6, ampliﬁer performance

against input frequency is highlighted. The main-stage PA
attains more than 50.0 % PAE, more than 19 dBm of output
power with an associated power gain greater than 8.0 dB from
2.15 GHz to 3.15 GHz.
B. Class-E driver stage
The driver stage consists of a class-E ampliﬁer with an
interstage matching network cascaded to the previously de-
signed main-stage ampliﬁer, as shown in Fig. 7. The class-E
driver fulﬁlls the class-E conditions as the tank L3C3 is tuned
to 1.41f0. Secondly, the gate-source capacitance, CGS, of
the main-stage transistor is resonated out with L4 at 2f0. It
results in an approximately half-sinusoidal voltage waveform
to operate the main transistor as a switch. Due to this, the PA
operates only in the active region and the large negative swing
of the input voltage is eliminated. Fig. 8 shows the simulated
time-domain voltage waveforms at the output and input of the
main transistor and also at the output of the class-E driver.
Simulated PAE and output power of the two-stage class-E
PA are shown in Fig. 9. Peak PAE of 64 % and peak output
power of approximately 23.0 dBm is obtained. One can clearly
see that due to the driver and inter stage matching network,
the ampliﬁer performance is basically unchanged over a wide

range of input powers. Fig. 10 illustrates the PA performance
against input frequency. The designed ampliﬁer provides PAE
greater than 50 %, output power of more than 20.5 dBm and
a power gain of more than 16.5 dB over a relative bandwidth
of more than 36.2 %, i.e. from 2.15 GHz - 3.1 GHz.
Simulated performance of the SMPA is summarised in Ta-
ble I. Following ﬁgure-of-merits (FOMs) are used to compare
the performance of designed ampliﬁer with other published
two-stage CMOS SMPA designs:
FOM1 = PAE · Freq [Hz]0.25Pout ,
(6)
FOM2 = PAE · Freq [Hz]0.25BW ,
(7)
where BW is the relative bandwidth. In [12], inductors
have large values which consume signiﬁcant chip area. For
this work, all the biasing inductors can be realised by bond
wires, whereas an on-chip inductor, L2 = 1.18 nH. Hence, the
implemented two-stage ampliﬁer has an area-efﬁcient design.

IV. CONCLUSION
An efﬁcient and wideband two-stage class-E PA in CMOS
130 nm process has been designed. The main-stage ampliﬁer
is based on class-E load network using ﬁnite DC-feed in-
ductance. This approach leads to high optimum resistance,
which facilitates wideband operation. Secondly, the use of
ﬁnite DC-feed inductance has less resistive losses, high fSR
and, therefore, high efﬁciency. A class-E driver also using
ﬁnite DC-feed inductance with interstage matching feeds the

main-stage class-E PA with a waveform approaching a half
sinusoidal voltage. The beneﬁt of the circuit is an improvement
in the overall PA performance since there is no negative
voltage swing.
Simulation results show that the ampliﬁer can deliver
23.0 dBm peak output power at peak PAE of 64.0 % to a
50 Ω load at 2.5 GHz from 3.3 V supply. The two-stage PA
obtains an optimum wideband performance with output power
and PAE more than 20.5 dBm and 50.0 %, respectively, for a
power gain greater than 16.5 dB, within a frequency range
from 2.15 GHz to 3.1 GHz. The mentioned bandwidth covers
WLAN, Bluetooth and LTE applications.
