Abstract—Previously, we proposed an efficient algorithm using 
vector 
quantization (VQ) 
histogram 
for facial image 
recognition in low-frequency DCT domains. In this paper, we 
newly utilize Local Binary Pattern (LBP) histogram in spatial 
domain. These two histograms, which contain both spatial and 
frequency domain information of a facial image, are utilized as 
a very effective personal feature. Publicly available AT&T 
database is used for the evaluation of our proposed algorithm, 
which is consisted of 40 subjects with 10 images per subject 
containing variations in lighting, posing, and expressions. It is 
demonstrated that face recognition using combined histogram-
based features can achieve much higher recognition rate.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, face recognition has been hot research 
topic due to its potential applications in many fields, such as 
law enforcement applications, security applications and 
video indexing, etc. Many algorithms have been proposed 
for solving face recognition problem [1]-[11].  
These algorithms can be roughly divided into two 
categories, namely, statistics-based and structure-based 
approaches. Statistics-based approaches [5], [6], [7] attempt 
to capture and define the face as a whole. The face is treated 
as a two dimensional pattern of intensity variation. Under 
this approach, the face is matched through finding its 
underlying statistical regularities. Based on the use of the 
Karhunen-Loeve transform, PCA [5] is used to represent a 
face in terms of an optimal coordinate system which contains 
the most significant eigenfaces and the mean square error is 
minimal. 
However, 
it 
is 
highly 
complicated 
and 
computational-power 
hungry, 
making 
it 
difficult 
to 
implement them into real-time face recognition applications. 
Structure-based approach [3], [4] uses the relationship 
between facial features, such as the locations of eye, mouth 
and nose. It can implement very fast, but recognition rate 
usually depends on the location accuracy of facial features, 
so it cannot give a satisfied recognition result.    
There are many other algorithms have been used for face 
recognition, such as Local Feature Analysis (LFA) [11], 
neural network [1], local autocorrelations and multi-scale 
integration technique [2], and other techniques have been 
proposed. 
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is not only widely 
used in many image and video compression standards [12], 
but also for pattern recognition as a means of feature 
extraction [13]-[21]. The main merit of the DCT is its 
relationship to the KLT [18]. It has been demonstrated that 
DCT best approach KLT [23], but DCT can be 
computationally more efficient than the KLT depending on 
the size of the KLT basis set. 
In our previous work [27], we present a simple, yet 
highly reliable face recognition algorithm using vector 
quantization (VQ) method for facial image recognition in 
compressed DCT domain. Feature vectors of facial image are 
firstly generated by using DCT coefficients in low frequency 
domains. Then, the codevector referred count histogram, 
which is utilized as a very effective facial feature value, is 
obtained by VQ processing.  
This algorithm can be considered utilizing the phase 
information of DCT coefficients by applying binary 
quantization on the DCT coefficient blocks. If we could 
combine spatial information of the facial image, the 
composite features of face are expected to be more robust 
and effective. In this paper, we utilize Local Binary Patterns 
(LBP) to represent facial features in spatial domain. These 
two histograms, which contain spatial and frequency domain 
information of a facial image, are utilized as a very effective 
personal value. Recognition results with different type of 
histogram features are first obtained separately and then 
combined by weighted averaging. 
This paper is organized as follows. A brief introduction 
to DCT as well as LBP histogram is given in Section II. Our 
proposed face recognition method will be described in detail 
in Section III. Experimental results will be discussed in 
Section IV.  Finally, we make a conclusion in Section V.

B. Face recognition using Binary vector quantization in 
low-frequency DCT domains 
In our previous work [27], we proposed a feature 
extraction algorithm for face recognition using binary vector 
quantization (VQ) to generate feature vectors of facial 
image from DCT (Discrete Cosine transform) coefficients in 
low frequency domains. 
First, low-pass filtering is carried out using 2-D moving 
filter.  Block segmentation step, in which facial image is 
divided into small image blocks with an overlap, namely, by 
sliding dividing-partition one pixel by one pixel, is the 
following. Then the pixels in the image blocks (typical size 
is 8x8) are transformed using DCT according to the 
equation (1).  
A typical sample of transformed block is shown in 
Figure 1. The DCT coefficients of the image block are then 
used to form a feature vector. From left to right and top to 
bottom, the frequency of coefficients changes from low to 
high as shown in Figure 1. Because low frequency 
component is more effective for recognition, we only use 
the coefficients on the left and above to extract features. The 
equation for calculation is shown below. 
 
 
a[0] = AC01; 
 
a[1] = AC11; 
 
a[2] = AC10; 
 
 
 
     (4) 
 
a[3] = (AC02 + AC03 + AC12 + AC13) / 4; 
 
a[4] = (AC22 + AC23 + AC32 + AC33) / 4; 
 
a[5] = (AC20 + AC21 + AC30 + AC31) / 4 
 
where a[i] is the element of extracted feature vector, and 
d[i][j] is the coefficient value at point (i, j), respectively. 
After that, quantization of the feature vectors is 
implemented. There are only 2 types of value for each a[i], 
so the number of combination of 6-dimensional vector is 64, 
which is very easy and fast to be determined. The number of 
vectors with same index number is counted and feature 
vector histogram is easily generated, and it is used as 
histogram feature of the facial image. In the registration 
procedure, this histogram is saved in a database as personal 
identification information.  In the recognition procedure, the 
histogram made from an input facial image is compared 
with registered individual histograms and the best match is 
output as recognition result.  
 
C. Local Binary Patterns (LBP) histogram 
The original LBP operator proposed by Ojala et al. [28], 
is used for robust texture description. The operator labels 
the pixels of an image by thresholding the 3x3-
neighbourhood of each pixel with the center value and 
considering the result as a binary number. Then the 
histogram of the labels can be used as a texture descriptor. 
Figure 2 shows an illustration of the basic LBP operator. 
The limitation of the fundamental LBP operator is its 
small 3x3 neighborhood which can not capture dominant 
features with large scale structures. Hence, the operator later 
is extended to use neighborhood of different sizes. As 
shown in Figure 3, LBP(P, R) means P sampling points on a 
circle of radius of R to get LBP features. For instance, 
LBP(8, 2) means comparing a neighborhood of 8 on the 
circle of radius of 2 to get LBP features. 
After labeling an image with the LBP operator, the 
histogram of the labeled image p(x,y) can be defined as

A LBP histogram can effectively describe the 
distribution of the local micro-patterns over a whole face 
image without any indication about their locations. For 
efficient face representation, one should also retain spatial 
information. Thus, a face image can be equally divided into 
small regions. And then, the LBP features extracted from 
each sub-region are concatenated into a single histogram as

PROPOSED METHOD 
As described in Section II (B), we have proposed a face 
recognition algorithm by applying binary quantization on the 
low-frequency 
DCT 
coefficient 
blocks, 
which 
was 
demonstrated to be effective for face recognition by 
experimental results. Actually, it can be thought that phase 
information of low-frequency DCT coefficients is extracted 
by this algorithm. If we could combine spatial information of 
the facial image, the composite features of face are expected 
to be more robust and effective. 
 We utilize LBP to represent facial features in spatial 
domain.  In this paper, we propose an improved face 
recognition algorithm using combined histogram-based 
features. Figure 4 shows proposed face recognition process 
steps. First, low-pass filtering is carried out using 2-D 
moving filter. This low-pass filtering is essential for reducing 
high-frequency noise and extracting most effective low 
frequency component for recognition.   
Block segmentation step, in which facial image is divided 
into small image blocks with an overlap, namely, by sliding 
dividing-partition one pixel by one pixel, is the following. 
Then the pixels in the image blocks (typical size is 8x8) are 
transformed using DCT according to the equation (1). After 
generations of low-frequency DCT coefficients, binary 
quantization of the feature vectors is implemented as 
described in Section II (B), and then VQ histogram of low-
frequency DCT coefficients is created.  
On the other hand, LBP histogram of facial image in 
spatial domain is generated after filtering processing. Once 
the features have been selected, LBP histogram is created by 
using formula (7) as described in Section II(C). 
These two histograms, which contain both spatial and 
frequency domain information of a facial image, are utilized 
as a very effective personal feature. Recognition results with 
different type of histogram features are first obtained 
separately and then combined by weighted averaging.

 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. ORL database 
Face database of AT&T Laboratories Cambridge [25], 
[26] is used for recognition experiments.  In the database, 10 
facial images for each of 40 persons (totally 400 images) 
with variations in face angles, face sizes, facial expressions, 
and lighting conditions are included.  Each image has a 
resolution of 92x112.   Five images were selected from each 
person’s 10 images as probe images and remaining five 
images are registered as album images.  Recognition 
experiment is carried out for 252 (10C5) probe-album 
combinations by rotation method. The algorithm is 
programmed by ANSI C and run on PC (Pentium(R)D 
processor 840 3.2GHz). 
 
B. Results and discussions 
Figure 5 shows the comparison of the recognition results 
with different features. The average recognition rates 
obtained by each case with block size of 8x8 are shown here.

Recognition success rates are shown as a function of filter 
size. Recognition results only using LBP histogram 
(“LBP_hist”) achieved 95.8% at the filter size of 9x9,  
average recognition rate increases combined with VQ 
histogram 
of 
low-frequency 
DCT 
coefficients 
(“Combined_hist”). The maximum of the average rate 
97.5% is achieved, which is 3.8% higher than that only 
using VQ histogram in our previous work (“N8_VQ_hist”, 
the maximum of the average rate is 93.7%) [27].  
Figure 6 shows recognition results using combined 
features with the same weighting coefficient of two 
histogram features. Recognition success rates are shown as a 
function of filter size.  “Max,” “Min” and “Ave” stand for 
the best case, worst case, and average results in 252 (10C5) 
probe-album combinations, respectively. The highest 
average recognition rate of 97.5% is obtained at the filter 
size of 5x5.  Low pass filter is effective for eliminating 
noise component and extracting important frequency 
component for recognition.   
By combining these two different features, namely 
spatial and frequency domain information of a facial image, 
the most important information for face recognition can 
effectively be extracted.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
We have developed a very simple yet highly reliable face 
recognition method using features extracted from low-
frequency DCT domain and spatial domain of a facial image, 
which is combined with VQ histogram and LBP histogram. 
Excellent face recognition performance has been verified by 
using publicly available ORL database.  The effect of the 
image block size will be discussed in our future work, as 
well as the performance evaluation of the face recognition 
using larger face database.
