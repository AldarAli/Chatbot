Abstract—This paper uses a large amount of data, which, in
turn, will interpret a broad spectrum of information. It applies
the graph theory to map relationships among words using
network science in order to analyze the reports of important
telecommunication companies and to study the syntactic
structure of their language. The following properties are
analyzed in the word network of these companies, such as the
words’ co-occurrence, density, betweenness, distance between
words (length, average diameter) and structures (presence of
clusters, existence of motifs). We conclude that the company
language shows characteristics of complex systems and that
some features are common among organizations.
Keywords-words network; mean distance; communities; motif;
robustness.
I. INTRODUCTION
A language is a set of signs that allow human communi-
cation by means of their meaning and their relationships.
It is different in creativity, form and content for several
cultural groups because they do not use the same sounds, or
grammatical structure [1]. Many tools for natural language
processing have been developed due to language analysis,
which is useful in different areas;
• The Internet has created many electronic documents,
which are widely available. In order to recover the most
relevant data, it is necessary to check these documents
by means of language processing, a keyword-match
based on data recovery, which supplies quick access
to documents containing important information.
• In social marketing, understanding what the community
is saying is a key issue. A study about abbreviations or
variants of expression usage (small or capital letters,
letter repetition or missing letters, orthographical vari-
ations, or non-alpha symbols) would be interesting.
• In medicine, the linguistic analysis may be useful
in the investigation of mental illnesses. For instance,
some studies have conﬁrmed that schizophrenics have
a syntactically less complex speech, which means that
linguistic variable usage in a discriminant function
analysis may help to predict diagnoses in many cases.
The objective of this paper is to study the syntactical
structure
of
the
language
in
information
technology
companies by means of network science. In [5], network
science is deﬁned as ”the study of networks which contrasts,
compares,
and
integrates
techniques
and
algorithms
developed
in
disciplines
as
diverse
as
mathematics,
statistics, physics, social network analysis, information
science and computer science”.
This investigation studies more than 30 company reports
with more than 6,000,000 words to interpret a broad
spectrum of information. Speciﬁcally, the annual reports
(in Spanish) of ﬁve companies are analyzed in: AMPER
[23], JAZZTEL [24], VODAFONE [25], INDRA [26] and
TELEF ´ONICA [27].
We transform each company’s annual report into a words
network where some metrics such as: shortest distance
between nodes, betweenness, detection of clusters and
motifs are studied. These measures have also been used
to analyze the structural properties of others natural and
artiﬁcial complex systems [2] [3] [4]. Typical language
properties are identiﬁed and the obtained results are
compared among the analyzed companies.
We apply the method described in [6] to detect motifs
and the Walktrap Algorithm [7] [22] to calculate clusters in
the networks.
We develop several tools in C and phyton languages to
analyze the language structure syntactically in the annual
reports.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section
2 shows the related work, Section 3 describes the method
of analysis and results, and Section 4 establishes the main
conclusions and the future work.
II. RELATED WORK
There are no previous works on applications about
communication pattern analysis of information technology
companies. Nevertheless, there are several works about the
language characteristics.
Ferrer i Cancho and Sole [8] show that language
organization, described in terms of a graph, displays two
important features found in a disparate number of complex
systems: (i) The so-called small-world effect. In particular,
the average distance between two words, < l >, is shown

as < l >≃ 23. (ii) A scale-free distribution of degrees and
the fact that disconnecting the most connected nodes in
such networks can be identiﬁed in some language disorders.
The authors claim that these observations indicate some
unexpected features of language organization that might
reﬂect the evolution and social history of lexicons and the
origins of their ﬂexibility and combinatorial nature.
Steyversa and Tenenbaumb [9] present statistical analysis
of the large-scale structure of 3 types of semantic networks:
word associations, wordnet, and rogets thesaurus. This
research shows that they have a small-world structure,
characterized by sparse connectivity, short average path
lengths between words, and strong local clustering. . The
authors describe a simple model for semantic growth, in
which each new word or concept is connected to an existing
network by differentiating the connectivity pattern of an
existing node. This model generates appropriate small-world
statistics and power-law connectivity distributions, and also
suggests one possible fundamental basis for the effects of
learning history variables on behavioral performance in
semantic processing tasks.
Markosova[10] revises recent studies of syntactical word
web. He presents a model of growing network in which
processes such as node addition, link rewiring and new link
creation are taken into account. The author argues that this
model is a satisfactory minimal model explaining measured
data.

to

which
characteristics of the language are used in the written
messages

company of medical equipment. Authors of the framework

Coronges [12] uses a network analysis approach to
provide
information
that
helps
to
compare
structural
indexes of associative organization of two populations
varying in age and city location; associative connections
between words reveal the organization of concepts in these
populations.
Brasethvik and Atle [13] present an approach to semantic
document classiﬁcation and retrieval based on natural
language analysis and conceptual modeling. A conceptual
domain model is used in combination with linguistic tools
to deﬁne a controlled vocabulary for document collection.
Our research studies the structure of the company
language by means of the network science and gets
interesting conclusions. The investigation shows that some
features are common among organizations.
III. ANALYSIS METHOD
We analyze chairman’s letters of annual reports for
the
following
companies
and
periods:
TELEF ´ONICA
(2009, 2008, 2007, 2006), AMPER (2009, 2008, 2007,
2006), INDRA (2009, 2008, 2007, 2006), VODAFONE
(2009,2008, 2007, 2006) and JAZZTEL (2009, 2008, 2005,
2004). Chairman’s letters are written in Spanish.
A. Design of word network
A text can be plotted as a graph G = (U, L) ; where
U = {i} (i=1,... ,N) is the set of N words and L = {i, j}
is the set of connections between them. Adjacent words are
deﬁned as a couple i, j, which pertains to G , and where a
binary relation or link exists.
There are several assumptions made, including: repeated
words correspond to the same node i, word network is not
case sensitive, and the words before and after a score are
not neighbours in the network.
B. Words’ co-ocurrence
Table 1 shows the words with a percentage of co-
occurrence bigger than 1 % for the ﬁve companies studied.
It should be noted that words in English are written
in italics, different words in Spanish can be translated
to the same word in English, and those words in bold
are
repeated.
Prepositions,
conjunctions,
articles
and
adjectives have the higher percentage. One can notice that
some words appear in more than one company’s reports,
for instance ”millones” (”millions”) in JAZZTEL and
TELEF ´ONICA;
”compa˜n´ıa”
(”company”)
in
AMPER
and TELEF ´ONICA , ”desarrollo” (”development”); in
INDRA and VODAFONE. The company’s own name
appears in letters from AMPER, INDRA, JAZZTEL and
TELEF ´ONICA.
A matrix B of 5x5 dimension can be built as a
representation
of
the
coincidence
of
words
between
companies. The element Btq is the coincidence percentage
(%) in the texts between t and q companies. t, q = 1 for
TELEF ´ONICA; t, q = 2 for AMPER; t, q = 3 for INDRA;
t, q = 4 for JAZZTEL; and t, q = 5 for VODAFONE. We
show below that the main similarities are: TELEF ´ONICA
and AMPER in 60.71%, AMPER and INDRA in 86.36 %,
and JAZZTEL and VODAFONE in 77.78 %.

C. Structural parameters calculation
1) General characteristics: We have calculated the av-
erage distances between nodes (< l >), average degree
(< k >) and the most distant vertices (d) in the word
networks. These parameters are similar to those of other
complex technological networks ([11], [14], [15]) and close
to the value obtained in random networks, where the small
world property has been likewise reported [15]. We show
these characteristics in Table 2 and Table 3.

2) Betweenness: The betweenness bi of a node i in a
network is related to the number of times that such node
is a member of the set of shortest paths, which connect all
the pairs of nodes in the network. If gnl is the total number
of possible paths from n to l nodes, and gnil is the number
of paths from n
to l passing through i, then gnil/gnl is
the proportion of paths from n to l that pass through i. The
betweenness for a node i is deﬁned as: bi = gnil/gnl .
The functional relevance of the betweenness centrality bi
of a node is based on the observation that a node located
on the shortest path between two other nodes has a greater
inﬂuence over the information transfer between them. The
highly connected nodes (hubs) must have high-betweenness
values because there are many nodes directly and exclusively
connected to these hubs and the shortest path between these

nodes goes through these hubs.
In all studied networks, values for betweenness b are
ranged over several orders of magnitude and there are
low-connectivity and high-connectivity nodes, which ex-
hibited a wide range of betweenness values. It is shown
in Figure 1 for TELEFONICA and AMPER company in
2009, where betweenness, b, is plotted as a function of
connectivity (degree), k. This result indicates the existence
of a large number of nodes with high betweenness but
low connectivity. Although the low connectivity of these
words would imply that they are unimportant, their high
betweenness suggests that these words may have a global
impact. From a topological point of view, these words are
positioned to connect regions of high clustering (containing
hubs), even though they have low local connectivity. The
existence of such words points to the presence of modularity
in the network, and therefore suggests that these words may
represent important connectors that link these modules. This
behaviour was also found in the yeast protein interaction
network [16].
Articles, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs
and adjectives appear in the highest positions in the ranking
and these words are similar in all texts. The ﬁrst appearance
of verbs and sustantives is lower in the ranking for all
reports.
Depending on the year, in TELEF ´ONICA and AMPER
companies, the ﬁrst ranked verb is ”ser” (”to be”) or
”haber” (”to have”), in JAZZTEL company the verb ”du-
dar”, (”to hesitate”) also appears in that position; the
ﬁrst verb is ”haber” (”to have”) in INDRA company and
in VODAFONE company is ”suponer” (”to suppose”),
”contribuir” ( ”to contribute”), ”haber” (”to have”) and
”descargar” (”to download” ). The ﬁrst substantive in
TELEF ´ONICA company is TELEF ´ONICA; in AMPER com-
pany the ﬁrst nouns are ”mercado” (”market”), AMPER
and ”a˜no” (”year”); whereas in JAZZTEL company is

ket”); in INDRA company the ﬁrst sustantive is ”fu-
turo” (”future”), ”fruto” (”to bear fruit”), ”conﬁanza”
(”conﬁdence”), ”soluziona” (without translation, project
name); and in VODAFONE company the ﬁrst noun is ”ac-
tuaciones” (”actions”), ”desarrollo” (”development”)and
”servicios” (”services”). We show these results in Table 4.
It should be emphasized that words in English are written
in italics and different words in Spanish can be translated to
the same word in English.
3) Communities: Different methods have been developed
in order to ﬁnd communities in networks. Basically, these
methods can be grouped as spectral methods (e.g., [18]),
divisive meth-ods (e.g., [19]), agglomerative methods (e.g.,
[20]), and local methods (e.g., [21]). The choice of the best
method depends of the speciﬁc application, including the
network size and number of connections.
We have carried out a study of the community structure
in the word networks by measuring the similarities between
nodes by means of Walktrap Algorithm [7] [22]. Walktrap
algorithm is an agglomerative approach to detect communi-
ties, which starts with a community for each node such that
the number of partitions |ρ| = n and build communities by
amalgamation.
Walktrap method uses random walks on G to identify
communities. At each step in the random walk, the walker
is at a node and moves to another node chosen at random
yet uniformly from its neighbors. The sequence of visited
nodes is a Markov chain where the states are the nodes of
G. An N x N dimension adjacency matrix A(G) can be
built as a bidimensional representation of the relationships
between words, where Aij = 1 when a connection between
the nodes i and j exists and Aij = 0 otherwise. At each step
the transition probability from node i to node j is Pij = Aij
ki ,
which is an element of the transition matrix P for the random
walk. We can also write D−1A, where D is the diagonal
matrix of the degrees (∀i, Dii = ki and Dij = 0 where
i ̸= j. The random walk process is driven by powers of P:
the probability of going from i to j
in a random walk of
length t is (P t)ij , which we will denote simply as P t
ij . All
of the transition probabilities related to node i are contained
in the ith row of Pt denoted as P t
i• . Then we deﬁne an
inter-node distance measure as:
sij =
v
u
u
t
n
X
q=1
(P t
iq − P t
jq)2
kq
=∥ D1/2P t
i• − D1/2P t
j• ∥
(1)
where ∥ • ∥ is the Euclidean norm of Rn . This distance
can also be generalized as a distance between communities:
sCiCj or as a distance between a community and a node:
sCij
We then use this distance measure in our algorithm. The
algorithm uses an agglomerative approach, beginning with
one partition for each node (|ρ| = n ) . We ﬁrst compute the
distances for all adjacent communities (or nodes in the ﬁrst
step). In each step α , two communities are chosen based on
the minimization of the mean σα of the squared distances
between each node and its community.
σα = 1
nΣCi∈ραΣi∈Cis2
iCi
(2)
Instead of directly calculating this quantity, we ﬁrst cal-
culate the variations ∆σα. Due to the fact that the algorithm
uses a Euclidean distance, we can efﬁciently calculate these
variations as
∆σ(C1, C2) = 1

The community merges when the lowest △σ is performed.
The transition probability matrix is then updated accord-
ingly.

and the process is repeated again, updating the values of s
and ∆σ and then performing the next merge. After n − 1
steps, we get one partition that includes all the nodes of
the network ρn = {N} . The algorithm creates a sequence
of partitions (ρα)1≤α≤n. Finally, we use modularity to
select the best partition of the network, calculating Qρα
for each partition and selecting the partition that maximizes
modularity.
We deﬁne modularity Q as the fraction of links within
communities minus the expected value of the same quantity
for a random network. Let Aij be an element of the networks
adjacency matrix and suppose the nodes are divided into
communities such that node i belongs to community Ci.
Then Q can be calculated as follows:
Q =
1
2mσij{Aij − kikj
2m }δCiCj
(5)
where the δCiCj function is 1 if Ci = Cj and 0 otherwise.
m is the number of links in the graph, and ki is the degree
of a node i. The sum of the term kikj
2m over all pair nodes
in a community represents the expected fraction of links
within that community in an equivalent random network
where node degree values are preserved.
All word networks have several main communities, which
have high connected nodes but with few connections to the
rest of the network. These so clearly deﬁned communities
suggest a network structure. The community rank by
percentage of words is shown in Table 6. In Figure 2,
we plot the community rank for TELEF ´ONICA’s reports
in 2006 and 2007. We detected 88 communities in 2006
and 42 communities in 2007 within this company. In
Figure 3, we display the community rank for INDRA’s
reports in 2008 and 2009; 33 communities in 2008 and 39
communities in 2009 were found.
In each community, we also detected that the higher
probability of appearance according to the type of word
occurs among nouns, verbs and adjectives. In Figure 4,
we show the percentage by the type of word in rank 1
community and in rank 2 community for INDRA’s report
in 2007.
4) Motifs: Network motifs are connectivity-patterns (sub-
graphs) that occur frequently in the networks. Most networks
studied in biology, ecology, communication and others ﬁelds
have been found to show a small set of network motifs;
in most cases these motifs are repeated. In [22] a network
motif is deﬁned as ”patterns of interconnections occurring
in complex networks at numbers that are signiﬁcantly higher
than those in randomized networks”

The procedure used to detect network motifs in all word
networks is described in [22]. This method samples the sub-
graphs of the size n and estimates the appearances of them
in the whole graph based on the frecuencies obtained in the
samples. A sub-graph is sampled using a simple iterative
procedure by selecting connected links until a set of n nodes
is reached. The process is as follows:
LS is the set of picked links.
NS is the set of all nodes that are touched by the
links in LS.
LS and NS are inited to be empty sets.
1) Pick a random edge l1 = (h, i). Update LS =
{l1}, NS = {h, i}.
2) Make a list L of all neighboring links of LS.
Omit from L all links between two members
of NS. If L is empty return to 1.
3) Pick with a probability P edge l = {j, k}
from L.
4) Update LS = LS ∪ {l}, NS = NS ∪ {j, k}.
5) Repeat steps 2 − 3 until completing n-node
sub-graph S.
6) Calculate the probability P to sample S.
A sub-graph of size n-node can be represented as an adja-
cency matrix of n x n dimension M, where Mij = 1 when
a connection between nodes i and j exists and Mij = 0
otherwise. For simplicity, in this study, we have symbolized
this adjacency matrix as a long binary integer extracted by
concatenation of its rows. This number is named Identity
(Id).
We applied the method described above in all corporations
and their different reports to look up 3-node and 4-node
connected sub-graphs (n = 3 and n = 4). We detected two
kinds of 3-node sub-graphs and six types of 4-node sub-
graphs. These graphs are Id = 78, Id = 238, Id = 4, 382,
Id = 4, 698, Id = 4, 958, Id = 13, 260, Id = 13, 278 and
Id = 31, 710; in all company reports. In Table 6, we show
the relationship between Id and M for them.

In the Figures 5 and 6, we show sub-graphs that
have been found and their appearances for all analyzed
companies
in
2009.
For
instance,
in
TELEF ´ONICA
company the following appearances of 3-node graphs were
detected: 40, 393 with Id = 78; 308 with Id = 238 and
the following identiﬁers for 4-node graphs were found:
1, 541, 382 with Id = 4, 382; 255, 232 with Id = 4, 698;
45, 702 with Id = 4, 958; 2, 079 with Id = 13, 260; 1, 404
with Id = 13, 278; 23 with Id = 31, 710
Uniqueness in a graph is the number of times it appears
with completely disjoint groups of nodes. For all companies
in their different reports, we have also calculated the
graph’s uniqueness percentage over its total appearances
and this parameter is higher in the graphs with Id = 238,
for AMPER, JAZZTEL and VODAFONE companies, and
in the graph with Id = 31, 710 for TELEF ´ONICA and
INDRA companies. In Figures 7 and 8, we show the
percentage uniqueness in each sub-graph of the reports for
all corporations in 2009. So, for Id = 238 in AMPER
this uniqueness percentage is 29,17% , in JAZZTEL it’s
34,78% and in VODAFONE it’s 12,20%; for Id = 31, 710
in TELEF ´ONICA it’s 8,70% and in INDRA it’s 50,00%.
We observe that the percentage uniqueness is greater in the
sub-graphs with smaller appearances.
These
results
suggest
common
communication
characteristics in business language.
We also estimate that the average appearances in random
networks are 1,000 nodes. The method used to generate

random networks is the switching mechanism where we
switch between links while keeping the number of incoming
links of each node of the real network. The number of
switches is a random number within the range of 100-200
times that the number of links appear in the network. In
random networks the obtained results are also in good
agreement with the real networks. If we consider the
number of average appearances, the most frequent 3-node
sub-graph is also: Id = 78 and the 4-node sub-graph with
most appearances is also: Id = 4, 382 and Id = 4, 698, as
it is shown in Figures 9 and 10 for reports in 2009.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, through the use of a large amount of data,
we have been able to examine the syntactical language
structure used by several information technology companies
theoretically. We have checked their annual reports and
measured various properties: average degree, main shortest
path and betweenness. Additionally, we detected commu-
nities and motifs. There are common properties but other
characteristics appear in some corporations only.
All company reports show a small world property which is
a characteristic of complex systems. The parameters average
degree (< k >) and the most distant vertices (d) are also
similar.
Furthermore, TELEFONICA and AMPER, AMPER and
INDRA show high coincidence in words. JAZZTEL and
VODAFONE also have many common words. This result
can suggest a common essence in the companies.
All word networks also have main communities which
shows a high hierarchy among each network. In each com-

munity, the probability of appearance according to the type
of word is higher for nouns, verbs and adjectives.
In all corporation reports there are a large number of
nodes with high betweenness but low connectivity; although
the low connectivity of these words would imply that they
are unimportant, their high betweenness suggests that these
words have a global impact.
From a structural point of view, all companies have 3-
node and 4-node common connected sub-graphs. The more
frequent graph types are those with Id. 78, 4382, 4698 and
4958.

This study about the syntactic structure of the language
in the organization reports, can help to identify speciﬁc and
common properties in the companies. In future works, we
improve this research by means of a semantic analysis.
