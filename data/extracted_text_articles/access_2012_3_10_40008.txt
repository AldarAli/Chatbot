Abstract—This paper proposes the design of an efficient 
Optical-Electrical-Optical (OEO)-based Remote Terminal 
(RT) that can provide the higher power budget required for a 
long-reach transmission in an asymmetric 10 Gbit/s Ethernet 
Passive Optical Network (10/1G-EPON). The current 10/1G-
EPON specification supports a maximum physical distance of 
only 20km in a 32-way split due to a power budget limitation. 
However, many service providers prefer a transmission reach 
of over 40km in a 64-way split for an efficient access network 
design. In this paper, the proposed OEO-based RT provides 
quad-port architecture for a cost-effective design, supports a 
high power budget of 58 dB through 3R signal regeneration, 
and offers over a 50 km reach and 128-way split per port with 
no modification of a legacy 10/1G-EPON system. In addition, it 
can satisfy a Packet Loss Rate (PLR) of 10^-10 in the 
downstream and upstream paths.

 INTRODUCTION 
A 10 Gbit/s Ethernet Passive Optical Network (10G-
EPON) is one of the fastest access technologies for providing 
next-generation ultra-broadband services to subscribers. In 
the current Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) optical access system, 
1 Gbit/s EPON (1G-EPON) is being extensively utilized, 
particularly in Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, and 
China. However, with the recent growth of user traffic, a 
10G-EPON is expected to provide end users with a more 
comfortable online environment in the near future [1]. 
The 10G-EPON specification was ratified as the IEEE 
802.3av standard in 2009, and supports two configuration 
modes: symmetric mode, operating at a 10 Gbit/s data rate in 
both directions; and asymmetric mode, operating at a 10 
Gbit/s in the downstream direction and 1 Gbit/s in the 
upstream direction [2]. Additionally, to reduce the costs for 
laying fibers and equipment, 1G-EPON and 10G-EPON use 
the same outside plant. In particular, an asymmetric 10G-
EPON (i.e., 10/1G-EPON) can be easily applied to the 
Single Family Unit (SFU) market as a cost-effective next-
generation solution, as its upstream transmission is identical 
to that of 1G-EPON, and its downstream transmission relies 
on the maturity of 10Gbit/s Ethernet devices. 
The current 10/1G-EPON is defined into three classes of 
power 
budget: 
PRX10, 
PRX20, 
and 
PRX30. 
For 
compatibility with the PX10 and PX20 power budgets 
defined for a 1G-EPON, a 10/1G-EPON should mainly use 
the PRX10 and PRX20 power budgets [2][3][4]. These 
power budgets support channel insertion losses of 20 and 24 
dB, respectively. Therefore, a legacy 10/1G-EPON can 
support a physical distance of only 20 km for Single Mode 
Fiber (SMF) in a 1:32 split ratio [5]. 
However, many network operators worldwide have 
placed an increased emphasis on combining an optical access 
network with a metro network by consolidating their central 
offices (COs) through a long-distance EPON solution. This 
combination results in a considerable reduction in Capital 
Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditure (OPEX) 
budgets. In particular, EPON service providers require the 
high power budget to support long distances and a high split 
ratio such as 1:64@40 km. In addition, they hope to discover 
a solution satisfying the following key questions [5]: how to 
leverage the EPON architecture in rural areas, how to further 
increase subscriber density in their COs, how to decrease the 
connection cost per subscriber, and how to serve more 
people at a larger distance from the COs using IEEE802.3 
EPON equipment. 
To satisfy these requirements, we suggest the cost-
effective 3R-type Optical-Electrical-Optical (OEO)-based 
Remote Terminal (RT) that can provide a higher power 
budget of 58 dB in a legacy 10/1G-EPON without 
modification. We also demonstrate the performance of the 
OEO-based RT using a commercialized 1G-EPON system. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, we briefly review related work, while in section 
III we describe the detailed structure and design scheme of 
the proposed OEO-based RT. In Section IV, we show 
experimental results proving the effectiveness of our method 
and provide an analysis of its performance. Finally, we 
present a brief summary of our work in Section V.

RELATED WORK 
A long-distance 10/1G-EPON helps with network 
evolution, and reduces network levels and nodes from an 
increased high power budget. It can also provide significant 
cost savings by reducing the amount of electronic equipment 
and real estate required at a local exchange. Moreover, it can 
support service to small towns, suburbs, and rural areas [6]. 
To achieve these purposes, the IEEE802.3 extended 
EPON study group is standardizing a new definition of the

power budgets or reach extender solutions that can support a 
higher power budget [5]. Recently, several methods were 
suggested by the extended EPON study group. The first 
method is to define new power budget classes (i.e., PRX40 
and PRX50) through an increase in the receiver sensitivity 
and launch power of the transmitter. The second method is to 
use an extender box providing optical amplification (OA) or 
OEO for passing data streams. The final method is to 
decrease Optical Distribution Network (ODN) loss through 
an improved splitter design [7][8].  
As a first option, the current extended EPON study group 
is focusing mainly on the Physical Media Dependent (PMD) 
development of new power budget classes for application in 
the Multiple Dwelling Unit (MDU) market, as many 
operators would prefer a completely passive solution. 
However, much of the market demand for high split ratios of 
over 1:64 also requires a 40 km reach through a high power 
budget of over 35 dB. Among the methods described above, 
only the use of an extender box can easily satisfy this 
requirement. In an extended EPON study group, the line cost 
and power consumption per subscriber are also primary 
considerations when designing a high power budget solution 
for a 10G-EPON [9].  
 Figure 1 shows the 10G-EPON link structure ratified by 
the IEEE802.3av, and suggested by the extended EPON 
study group. This 10G-EPON can support a maximum 
transmission reach of 20 km in a 1:64 split ratio when using 
a PR(X)30 with a high power budget of 29 dB, as shown in 
Figure 1-(a). An extended PMD solution is provided through 
the insertion of an optical amplifier within the transceiver, 
and can support a power budget of 35 dB using the newly 
defined PR(X)50 PMD, as shown in Figure 1-(b). A 10G-
EPON using a PR(X)50 PMD can support a long distance of 
up to 40 km in a 1:32 split ratio without an extender box in 
the remote node, and can also support a high split ratio of 
1:128@20 km and  a very high split ratio of 1:256 within a 
very short distance of 2 km [10].  
However, an efficient 10/1G-EPON extender box 
solution supporting a cost-effective design, low power 
consumption, and a power budget of about 58 dB using the 
already developed PRX30 PMD has yet to be reported. 
Therefore, to support a physical distance of over 40 km and a 
greater than 1:64 split ratio under the worst-case ODN 
design scenarios without any problems, a 10/1G-EPON must 
apply a remote terminal as an extender box utilizing an 
active device. Active in-field components are also acceptable 
to many operators. 
In this paper, our proposed OEO-based 10/1G-EPON RT 
can efficiently provide a high power budget of 58 dB using 
the following functions: 3R signal retiming, remote 
management through a Simple Network Management 
Protocol (SNMP) agent and an embedded Optical Network 
Unit (ONT), and upstream burst-to-continuous signal 
conversion.

PROPOSED OEO-BASED REMOTE TERMINAL FOR 
LONG-DISTANCE ASYMMETRIC 10G-EPON 
 Figure 2 illustrates the 10/1G-EPON link structure 
applied to the proposed OEO-based 10/1G-EPON RT in the 
remote node to support a long distance and high split ratio. A 
10/1G-EPON system utilizing the 10/1G-EPON RT can 
provide a physical reach of over 60 km using an existing 
PX20 or PRX30 PMD in the trunk fiber, and can support a 
1:256 or 1:64 high split ratio for a 5 or 10 km reach, 
respectively, using standardized 10/1G-EPON PMDs under 
the worst-case ODN design scenarios without any problems. 
That is, when considering an optical fiber loss of 0.4 dB/km, 
the 10/1G-EPON applied to our 10/1G-EPON RT can easily 
support a high split ratio of 1:256@ over 60 km from a 
central office to end users. This makes a flexible access 
network configuration possible. 
The 10/1G-EPON RT mainly provides wavelength 
conversion and a signal retiming function based on 3R signal 
regeneration between a 10/1G-EPON OLT and 10/1G-EPON 
ONTs or 1G-EPON ONTs. In addition, it provides an 
optional upstream burst-to-continuous signal conversion to 
support WDM multiplexing in the trunk fiber. In particular, 
because the 10/1G-EPON RT is necessary for electrical 
power, it requires a remote management function and low-
cost, low-power design.

Figure 3 shows the design architecture and prototype of 
the developed 10/1G-EPON RT. The 10/1G-EPON RT is 
composed of a 3-port edge WDM filter for interconnection 
with the 10/1G-EPON OLT, a single FPGA for retiming of a 
1 Gbit/s downstream signal, an embedded ONT for SNMP 
packet transmission to the 10/1G-EPON OLT, a CPU 
processor providing SNMP for remote management, a Burst-
mode Clock & Data Recovery (BCDR) device for retiming 
of the burst-mode upstream signal, a Crosspoint Switch (CS) 
device for electrical signal division, a 1G-EPON ONU 
transceiver for receiving and transmitting a 1 Gbit/s optical 
signal, a 10/1G-EPON ONU transceiver for receiving a 10 
Gbit/s downstream optical signal, and a 10/1G-EPON OLT 
optical transceiver for inter-connection with the ODN. 
The 10/1G-EPON RT divides a 10 Gbit/s wavelength 
signal into 1 Gbit/s wavelength signals using a 3-port edge 
WDM filter. These wavelength signals are then inserted into 
each EPON ONU transceiver, and an optical signal is then 
converted into an electrical signal. These electrical signals 
are retimed by an FPGA and 10Gbit/s CDR in the electrical 
domain. The retimed signals then are retransmitted to the 
optical domain using a 10/1G-EPON OLT transceiver. In 
contrast, the signal retiming for a 1 Gbit/s signal in the 
upstream is performed using a BCDR device, which then 
converts the retimed upstream burst-mode signal into a 
continuous-mode signal through the FPGA. 
The 10/1G-EPON RT is designed using a quad-port 
architecture, and provides a signal retiming function through 
a Virtex-5 FPGA (XC5VLX-30T) for lower design costs and 
power consumption. However, the signal retiming function 
for a 10 Gbit/s downstream signal is performed using a 
commercialized low-cost 10 Gbit/s CDR device. Each port 
of the 10/1G-EPON RT was also designed as a plug-and-
play type. 
To provide remote management of the 10/1G-EPON RT, 
an embedded ONT is activated using a 10/1G-EPON OLT 
system with a CS device, BCDR device, and FPGA. An 
embedded ONT is provided using a compact-type of 
commercialized 1G-EPON ONU MAC as shown in Figure 3. 
That is, the 10/1G-EPON RT is connected with a 1 Gbit/s 
data channel of the 10/1G-EPON OLT, and only port 0 of 
the 10/1G-EPON RT is supported.  
An embedded ONT receives a downstream signal 
through a CS device, and transmits an upstream signal to the 
10/1G-EPON OLT using a BCDR device and FPGA, as 
shown in Figure 3. This upstream signal is merged with the 
upstream signal of port 0. The CPU processor gathers and 
manages the status of the installed optical transceivers based 
on the SFF-8472 and FPGA through a local CPU interface. 
The CPU processor is also connected directly with a User 
Network Interface (UNI) port of an embedded ONT at the 
electronic domain using a CS device without an external 
optical tap (e.g., an optical splitter), which is unlikely to have 
been used in previous methods. The 10/1G-EPON RT can 
use as a hybrid-type remote terminal by replacing the 10/1G-
EPON and 1G-EPON ONU optical modules with 10 Gbit/s 
and 1 Gbit/s Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing 
(CWDM) optical modules. 
Figure 4 illustrates the internal architecture of the signal 
retiming logic in the FPGA used to recover the 1G-EPON 
signals. Because the 10/1G-EPON OLT transceiver does not 
require a burst-mode reset signal, the 10/1G-EPON RT can 
easily provide a signal retiming function using the CDR 
within the FPGA for a downstream signal and the BCDR 
device for an upstream signal. 
In the downstream direction, the FPGA provides a 3R 
signal retiming using a recovery clock extracted from the 
CDR, which is included in the dual Gigabit Transfer 
Protocol (GTP). The dual GTP extracts a 156.25 MHz 
recovery clock and 8-bit data from a 1.25 Gbit/s continuous-
mode downstream signal using an external 156.25 MHz 
reference clock. This recovery clock is then used as a 
reference clock source necessary for an external BCDR 
device. On the other hand, in the upstream direction, the 
10/1G-EPON RT performs a signal recovery using the 
BCDR device and transmits this recovered signal to an Input 
Serializer/Deserializer (ISERDES) as shown in Figure 4.  
Also, a burst-mode reset signal for a BCDR device is 
generated by a Loss of Signal (LOS) output from the 10/1G-
EPON OLT transceiver. The BCDR device aligns with the 
input data within the 12-bit start of the preamble, and 
changes a 1-bit serial signal into a 4-bit parallel signal to 
provide the lower clock speed at the data transmission to the 
FPGA. The burst-to-continuous convertor in the FPGA 
optionally changes a burst-mode signal into a continuous-

mode signal through the insertion of a particular pattern (e.g., 
h’55) during the guard time. 
In this paper, our proposed OEO-type 10/1G-EPON RT 
can provide low-power consumption and a cost-efficient 
design through a quad-port structure using a single FPGA 
and generalized low-cost EPON optical transceivers. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND PERFORMANCE RESULTS 
The experimental setup for a performance measurement 
of the proposed OEO-based 10/1G-EPON RT is shown in 
Figure 5. As there is no commercialized 10/1G-EPON 
systems at present, we used the existing 1G-EPON system 
and a 10 Gbit/s jig board for the performance test of the 
10/1G-EPON RT. The legacy 1G-EPON system generates 
downstream and upstream signals with a line rate of 1.25 
Gbit/s, while the 10 Gbit/s jig board transmits a downstream 
signal with a line rate of 10.3125 Gbit/s using a Pulse Pattern 
Generator (PPG). 
For the 1 Gbit/s path link configuration, we used a single 
legacy 1G-EPON OLT and two 1G-EPON ONTs, and 
connected the trunk fiber using a 50 km SMF between the 
1G-EPON OLT and 10/1G-EPON RT. In addition, we 
configured a fixed 5 dB attenuator and 128-way split as the 
drop fiber between the 10/1G-EPON RT and 1G-EPON 
ONUs. For the 10 Gbit/s path link configuration, we also 
connected the trunk fiber using a 20 km SMF between the 10 
Gbit/s jig board and 10/1G-EPON RT, as the 10/1G-EPON 
PMDs used in this experimental setup are unable to provide 
a transmission reach of 40 km owing to a dispersion problem.  
The 1G-EPON used optical modules supporting both the 
IEEE 802.3ahTM-2004-PX20 and PX10 [3][4], while the 
10/1G-EPON RT used a 1G-EPON ONU optical module 
supporting an IEEE 802.3ahTM-2008-PX20, a 10/1G-EPON 
OLT, and an ONU optical module compliant with an 
IEEE802.3avTM-10/1GBASE-PRX30 [2]. The 1.25 Gbit/s 
and 10.3125 Gbit/s optical signals generated were merged 
using a 3-port edge WDM filter, and then separated again 
into 1.25 Gbit/s and 10.3125 Gbit/s optical signals using a 3-
port edge WDM filter in the 10/1G-EPON RT. The 10/1G-
EPON RT transmits the retimed 1.25 Gbit/s and 10.3125 
Gbit/s optical signals to the optical splitter via the 10/1G-
EPON OLT optical module. The optical power budget in the 
trunk fiber is adjusted using a Variable Attenuator (VA) 
value. In this experimental setup, the insertion losses in the 
trunk and drop fibers are about -12.8 dB and -26.8 dB, 
respectively. 
Figure 6 shows the optical eye diagrams of each Measure 
Point (MP) in the experimental setup for the proposed 
10/1G-EPON RT. Our 10/1G-EPON RT performs signal 
retiming using a recovery clock extracted through a 1 Gbit/s 
CDR within the FPGA and 10 Gbit/s CDR device, and this 
re-timed signal is recovered by the 1G-EPON ONUs. In a 
1.25 Gbit/s path, the downstream optical signal measured at 
MP1 is received by the 1G-EPON ONU optical module 
installed in the 10/1G-EPON RT through a 50 km SMF and 
two 3-port edge WDM filters. In an optical eye diagram 
measured at MP2 and MP3, shown in Figure 6-(a), we can 
see a clear eye-pattern satisfying the optical eye mask

adapted from the IEEE Gigabit Ethernet standard through 3R 
signal regeneration. We can confirm that a jitter of about 31 
ps is added by the signal recovery. In a 10.3125 Gbit/s path, 
MP5 shows the results of a transmission dispersion caused 
by the 20 km SMF. We can also confirm that the output 
optical signal measured at MP6 satisfies the optical eye mask 
adapted from the IEEE 10.3125 Gbit/s Ethernet standard by 
the 3R signal retiming, as shown in Figure 6-(b), although a 
slight amount of jitter is added. This means that is possible to 
support a transmission reach of over 20 km through our 
proposed 10/1G-EPON RT, including a legacy 10G-EPON 
PMD in a 10 Gbit/s channel. 
Using a commercially available router tester (Agilent 
N2X), the performance of the proposed 10/1G-EPON RT 
was evaluated in terms of packet loss rate (PLR) through 
Ethernet frames with random lengths ranging from 64 to 
1518 bytes. We transmitted 10^10 frames for the PLR test. 
Figure 7 shows the PLR results measured at the 1.25 
Gbit/s path of the proposed 10/1G-EPON RT using a legacy 
1G-EPON system according to the VA value. Because a 1G-
EPON OLT uses a continuous-mode transmitter with a 
Distributed Feedback Laser Diode (DFB-LD) and a burst-
mode receiver with an Avalanche Photodiode (APD), we can 
be certain that the upstream optical link budget increases by 
about 3 dB more than that of the downstream. Our 
experimental results confirm that the 1G-EPON system 
supports a physical distance of 50 km in a 1:128 split ratio 
using the proposed OEO-based 10/1G-EPON RT, and 
satisfies a PLR of 10^-10 for up to -29 dBm in a downstream 
path, and -32 dBm in an upstream path. This means that the 
10/1G-EPON RT is able to provide transmission service at a 
distance of about 70 km with a 128-way split, when we take 
into account a budget loss of a 0.4 dB/km in an optical fiber. 
Figure 8 shows the results of a packet transmission test of 
a legacy 1G-EPON system using our proposed 10/1G-EPON 
RT during a 66-hour period. During this test, we transmitted 
a 100 Mbit/s packet from a 1G-EPON OLT to each 1G-
EPON ONU, while assigning a 98 Mbit/s packet at each 1G-
EPON ONU for measurement of the upstream PLRs. From 
Figure 8, we can confirm the possibility of loss-free service 
in the downstream and upstream paths. 
Table 1 shows the results of a technology comparison of 
10/1G-EPON using the proposed OEO-based 10/1G-EPON 
RT, a 10G-EPON standardized by IEEE802.3av-2009, and 
an Extended 10/1G-EPON suggested by IEEE802.3 
extended EPON study group [2][5]. As the table shows, with 
the exception of an active component used in a remote node, 
our proposed 10/1G-EPON RT can provide greater 
efficiency with respect to power budget, distance and user 
accommodation, cost per subscriber, and long-distance trunk 
fiber costs. However, to make up for the weak point above, 
we adopted quad-port architecture at the proposed 10/1G-
EPON-RT. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
We proposed and experimentally demonstrated an 
efficient OEO-based 10/1G-EPON RT based on quad-port 
architecture to overcome the physical limitations of a legacy 
10/1G-EPON system. We also confirmed that our proposed 
10/1G-EPON RT can achieve a high power budget of 58 dB 
through 3R signal retiming using a legacy 10/1G-EPON 
PMD, and can be a cost-effective solution for a long-distance 
10/1G-EPON system.  
Our experimental results verified that the proposed RT 
can provide a distance of more than 40 km in a 1:64 split 
ratio, which many service providers desire. If 10/1G-EPON 
PMDs use the PRX30 power budget class, the 10/1G-EPON

RT can be expected to support a reach of over 80 km in a 
1:128 split ratio with no modifications of the legacy 10/1G-
EPON standard. 
In our future work, we will perform a feasibility test with 
either a commercialized 10/1G-EPON system or an 
evaluation system, and apply CWDM multiplexing to a trunk 
fiber with a 10/1G-EPON Central Office Terminal (COT) 
performing wavelength conversion between the EPON and 
CWDM.
