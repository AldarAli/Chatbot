Abstract—This paper simulates and characterizes the 60 
GHz band wireless channels for typical indoor. The Radio 
wave Propagation Simulator (RPS) is used to simulate the 
model characteristics. Simulations performed on the three 
rooms at Telematics Laboratory of Bandung Institute of 
Technology (ITB) those are Residency room, Computer 
Laboratory (size 1013 cm x 589.5 cm x 289.8 cm), and 
Undergraduate/Final Project room (size 900 cm x 1013 cm x 
289.8 cm). The rooms were built with concrete walls in the left 
and right side with a thickness 14 cm, 0.5 cm for ceiling 
thickness, and the combination of walls and glasses at the front 
and backside of the rooms. The model characteristics were 
measured based on three classifications of distance between 
transmitter and receiver, i.e., CM1 (0 - 4 m), CM2 (4 - 10 m), 
and CM3 (> 10 m). We then obtain the model characteristics in 
terms of RDS value at 0.26 to 7.74 ns for the receivers at 
Residency room, 1.02 to 8.76 ns at Computer Lab and 2.07 to 
15.65 ns at Final Project room. The system performances 
shown the coherence bandwidth is 1.2778 to 76.9492 MHz for 
frequency correlation above 90% and therefore the maximum 
bit rate that can be achieved with 1.25 spectrum efficiency is 60 
Mbps.  
 
Keywords—60 GHz, RPS, rms delay spread, coherence 
bandwidth. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Wireless network is no longer an exclusive technology. 
The utilization of this wireless network can served as an 
alternative for computer network communication system 
whether in large scale or small scale that can be choose by 
someone who preferred practical non-wire-communication. 
This service can be found for private area (WPAN-Wireless 
Personal Area Network), local area (WLAN-Wireless Local 
Area 
Network), 
and 
public 
area 
(WMAN-Wireless 
Metropolitan Area Network), i.e., office buildings, school or 
campus, supermarket and residential home.  
In wireless network realization, problems will occur that 
consist of data rates, coverage area, network size and power 
consumption, however, this can be fixed using WPAN 
(Bluetooth) or WLAN (Wi-Fi) which has different data 
rates. WPAN has lower data rate characteristics compared to 
WLAN, therefore WLAN application is more developed. 
Bandwidth which being used at present is 2.4 GHz (ISM-
Industrial, Scientific and Medical), unfortunately, this 
bandwidth is jam-packed with many applications that runs 
in short and long distance transmission, while the demand 
on higher data rates are increasing. Therefore, frequency 
around 60 GHz (millimeter waveband), which is unlicensed 
frequency, is becoming more interesting. The new 
technologies are designed to develop the gigabyte wireless 
connection although there are many challenges ahead [5][7]. 
The most important issue in this frequency applications 
are the channel modeling and characteristics. Reference [2] 
shows measure and characterization of wireless channel 
using S-V Model. However, this analytical research is not 
sufficient enough, not to mention the frequency integration 
of 2.4/5 GHz to 60 GHz [7].  
Concerned with the model that being used and to respond 
with the future challenges, this research are based on the 
wireless indoor channel characterization at 60 GHz through 
computer simulation so that we can identify the channel 
behavior. 
To limit the scope of this work, we focus our research on 
the delay spread value including mean excess and rms delay 
to obtain the main wireless indoor parameters. The rest of 
the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the 
wireless channel, propagation and channel modeling. 
Section 3 describes the simulation procedure and the model. 
Section 4 shows simulation results in terms of the main 
parameters. We draw conclusions in Section 5. 
 
II. CHANNEL MODELING 
In wireless communication systems, the propagation 
characteristics are having influence on the system design, 
both for outdoor or indoor. For 60 GHz, characteristics 
indoor system have significant differences (very unique) 
compared to outdoor system, are mainly caused by 
obstacles, i.e., walls, floor, ceilings and many objects which 
cause the radio signals will experience the reflection, 
diffraction and scattering effect. In addition to the basic 
mechanisms of propagation that associated with the fading 
and multipath, there is also attenuation due to absorption of 
oxygen in the amount of 10-15 dB/km which makes the 
frequency is not suitable for long distance (> 2 km). 
Therefore, applications for 60 GHz dedicated to indoor, so 
that characteristic of indoor communication systems should 
be considered especially the delay spread as multipath 
effects. 
To predict the delay spread, modeling based on 
deterministic propagation model that is ray tracing model 
with a computational model (optical ray technique). 
Propagation described by the wave propagation of different 
signals from transmitter to receiver antenna with respect to 
reflection, diffraction, and scattering objects in buildings 
and other obstructions. For computational process, is based

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Based on simulation results and analysis at three 
simulation area we can conclude that the indoor channel 
characteristics are influenced by the objects and the object 
materials inside the area itself. The wavelength will 
affecting the reflection, if the frequency higher therefore the 
reflection effect will be larger. The model characteristics for 
60 GHz, maximum RDS value achieved at 15.65 ns in Final 
Project room while minimum value achieved at 0.26 ns in 
Residency room. Using frequency correlation function 
above 90%, the coherence bandwidth is 1.2778 – 76.9492 
MHz therefore the maximum bitrate that can be achieved 
with 1.25 spectrum efficiency is 60 Mbps. 
This contribution is limited to an experimental ray-
tracing simulation for indoor 60 GHz transmission. The 
measurement is required to validate the simulated channel 
model. Our future work will be focused to validate the 
model by using experimental measurement.
