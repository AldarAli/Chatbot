Abstract—Twitter is widely used as a tool for disseminating 
and collecting information related to security incidents. The 
quality of information provided by Twitter, however, has not 
been studied in detail so far, where quality in this paper refers 
to the detailedness, real-time performance, and reliability of 
the information. This paper evaluates the quality of Twitter 
information by comparing with that of information provided 
by a news site that publishes a large number of security-related 
articles as a baseline. Our analysis showed that Twitter was 
significantly better in terms of detailedness and real-time 
performance. On the other hand, a news site was slightly better 
in terms of reliability.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Social Networking Services (SNS) and cybersecurity-
focused news sites are two media for investigating ongoing 
security attacks on the Internet. SNSs can provide a large 
amount of fresh security information because information is 
transmitted in real time from a variety of sources [1]. On the 
other hand, news sites publish daily articles on security 
incidents and new vulnerabilities, with coverage by trusted 
security experts. In order to clarify the differences in the 
quality of security information provided by these two media, 
this study collected data on Emotet attacks in Japan provided 
by Twitter and Security NEXT as a case study. 
Emotet is a Trojan horse that spreads primarily through 
spam e-mails and is raging worldwide. The most common 
Emotet attack method is to infect computer systems with 
various types of malware using malicious files attached to 
spam e-mails. Japan has been a major target for Emotet since 
2019 [2]. Twitter includes links to external sites in its tweets 
and disseminates Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from a 
variety of sources, including malware sandboxes, security 
vendor blogs, etc. It has been reported that Twitter captures 
ongoing malware threats, such as Emotet variants and 
malware distribution sites, better than other public threat 
intelligence [1]. Security NEXT, on the other hand, is a news 
site specializing in information related to security incidents 
in Japan, with a large number of postings and free access to 
all articles. 
This 
study 
compared 
the 
detailedness, 
real-time 
performance, and reliability of information provided by 
Twitter and Security NEXT. We found that Twitter excelled 
in terms of detailedness and real-time performance of 
information about Emotet. The rest of the paper is structured 
as follows. In Section II, we present the process of collecting 
and analyzing Emotet data. In Section III, we discuss the 
visualized results. Finally, we conclude the work in Section 
IV. 
II. 
PROGRAM STRUCTURE 
We created a program that visualizes information on 
Emotet provided by Twitter and Security NEXT in Japanese 
for the period from January 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020. The 
following describes the program execution sequence. 
1. Collect URLs posted on Twitter and Security NEXT 
as follows.  In the case of Twitter, collect all 
shortened 
URLs 
(http://t.co/) 
in 
every 
tweet 
containing the term "emotet", and then convert all the 
shortened URLs to the original URLs. Next, check all 
duplicate sites (the same URL, same title, or same 
text) to exclude them. In the case of Security NEXT, 
collect all URLs contained in all of the articles of the 
news site. 
2. Collect text areas (the areas enclosed by tag <p>) of 
Japanese websites of the URLs obtained above if their 
titles include "emotet."  
3. Extract words (nouns and compound nouns) from the 
texts collected above using a morphological analysis 
library janome [3].  
4. Group all collected words into several categories 
because they contained a variety of words including 
synonyms. 
5. Create a histogram representing the frequency of the 
classified categories. 
III. 
CALCULATION RESULTS 
Table I shows the number of web sites from which 
information was retrieved, the total number of words, and the 
program execution time. Much of the program execution 
time is spent on the program execution sequence 1-2 in 
Section II. Table I shows that Twitter has more than 20 times 
more words than Security NEXT and that the program 
execution time for Twitter is more than 10 times longer. In 
other words, while Twitter has more detailed information 
than Security NEXT, it takes longer to retrieve the 
information. 
Emotet distributes malware through spam e-mails with 
malicious file attachments. Therefore, we visualize the 
previous and current trends in Emotet's attack strategy by 
focusing on malware types, extensions of attachments, and 
subject lines of spam e-mails. Figures 1 and 2 show yearly 
frequencies of malware distributed by Emotet [4]-[6]. These

figures show that fewer types of malware appear in Security 
NEXT articles than in Twitter.  Figures 3 and 4 show the 
yearly frequencies of malicious file extensions. These figures 
demonstrate similar result in that the ZIP format has the 
highest percentage in 2020, followed by the DOC format 
(including the DOCM format), and then the PDF format. 
However, in Figure 4, data for 2019 and 2021 are missing. 
Figures 5 and 6 show the yearly frequencies of spam e-mail 
subject lines. Figure 5 shows that five to six categories 
appear in every year, while Figure 6 shows six categories 
appearing only in 2020. Accordingly, Twitter tends to 
provide detail Emotet attack characteristics (malware, 
extension, subject) every year. On the contrary, Security 
NEXT may provide no information during the periods when 
Emotet attacks are less frequent.  
Table II compared the dates when Twitter and Security 
NEXT reported the Emotet malware names for the first time. 
As shown in the table, Twitter reported at least 220 days 
earlier for all malware types. Although not mentioned in this 
paper, Twitter also provided quicker reports on malicious file 
extensions and spam e-mail subject lines. 
Table III compares Twitter and Security NEXT on eight 
reliability measures of 20 randomly sampled websites. Here 
we measure the reliability of information on Twitter and 
Security NEXT based on website reliability. The table shows 
that Security NEXT is slightly better. Twitter is dependable 
in that it mostly has links to information sources, but the 
probability of link errors is not negligible. Twitter sometimes 
does not include writers' contact information and privacy 
policy statements.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Today, security experts significantly depend on Twitter 
information. This paper quantitatively evaluated the quality 
of Twitter information in terms of detailedness, real-time 
performance, and reliability. Our results showed that the 
quality of Twitter information was excellent in terms of 
detailedness and real-time performance. On the other hand, a 
news site was slightly better when measured based on 
reliability. In the future, we will evaluate the reliability of 
Twitter information using other methods such as language-
based and knowledge-based approaches.
