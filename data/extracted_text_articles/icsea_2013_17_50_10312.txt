Abstract— In case of R&D (Research and Development) 
organization, the 
problems of SPI (Software Process 
Improvement) are focused on how to tailor the process 
properly because researchers always ask to take the least time 
and the most benefits for implementing established processes. 
Process tailoring strategy is a key to attract the researchers for 
applying the processes.  It is a challenge for EPG (Engineering 
Process Group) to find out the best solution for the 
organization.   EPG has to prove if the software development 
processes are suitable for the research.  Measurable CSF 
(Critical Success Factors) and how to tailor appropriately 
influences the quality of the process.

 INTRODUCTION  
 Referring to Process Maturity Profile 2012 by SEI [1],  
many organizations have been struck at CMMI (Capability 
Maturity Model Integration) Maturity Level 3 because of 
missing quantitative project data; this is valid especially for 
government organizations, which tend to apply international 
standards for AEC (ASEAN Economic Community) 
opportunity.  MA (Measurement and Analysis) is an 
important process area from all the 22 process areas which 
CMMI has specified and it affects to upgrade SPI in the 
organization. The problem is that there is no experience in 
this process.  NECTEC tries to do research about it and 
expects to make the SMEs to understand better in MA. 
Each software development project can have different 
SDLCs (Software Development Lifecycles) depending on its 
constraints that can be size, cost, effort, time, customer 
requirement, business/project goal, capability, culture, etc.  
There are various SDLCs including Waterfall Model, V-
shaped SDLC, Structured Evolutionary Prototyping Model, 
RAD (Rapid Application Model), Incremental SDLC, Spiral 
SDLC, Agile SDLC, etc. Each SDLC has strengths and 
weaknesses which collect from past implementation [4].   
But, each organization can adapt them to align with its 
optimizing processes like NECTEC where tailors Agile 
SDLC to be own SDLC called “Adaptive SDLC”. Currently, 
agile methodology [18] is capturing more, especially the 
extreme method and a survey indicates percentage of 
companies which get better responses in main aspects such 
as 93% productivity, 88% quality, 49% cost and 83% 
business satisfaction [2]. Positive and Negative features from 
implementing agile methodology are identified in Figure 1.

Some perspectives for the organizational requirement of 
a metrics program have been classified [10].  Three main 
factors, which affect the SPI program, include senior 
management commitment, clear and relevant SPI goals, and 
staff involvement, as shown Figure 2.

Seven advantages of Measurement are identified in 
Rational Edge article. They include 1) Improve visibility,      
2) Communicate effectively, 3)  Identify and correct 
problems early, 4) Make key trade-off, 5) Track specific

project objectives, 6) Manage risks, and 7) Defend and 
justify decisions and plan future projects.   However, it is 
hard to establish measures because of no having certain set 
for all organizations. It depends on their strategy, 
technology, and the route of competition. 
First an overview of measurement-based methodology is 
provided. Then the paper presents a result of implementing 
measurement in R&D organization and how to work with 
MA process. The CSF for the MA implementation is 
identified.  Finally, an effort to find out the better measure 
for R&D work is proposed. 
 
II. 
METHODOLOGY 
A. Measurement and Analysis Process based on CMMI  
Measurement and Analysis (MA) process area is grouped 
in support category. Its objective is to develop and maintain 
measurement 
capability 
for 
supporting 
management 
information needs.  There are 2 specific goals; each goal 
consists of 4 practices to fulfill the goal.  The goals are to 
align measurement and analysis activities and to provide 
measurement results. CMMI just guide what to do so each 
organization has to find out how to do the best.  Each 
organization can have different MA process depending on its 
goal. The process can be changed periodically because the 
organization can change its goal.  Figure 3 shows the 
relationship between MA process and other processes. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. The relationship between MA process and others [14] 
 
B. MA Process Evaluation Approach 
The measurement management in organization has 
several methodologies. The Software Engineering Institute 
(SEI) published an interesting method called “Measurement 
and Analysis Infrastructure Diagnostic Method (MAID)”. 
MAID 
guides 
the 
organizations 
to 
evaluate 
key 
characteristics of their measurement programs [15]. This 
method is based on criterion. A set of criteria for evaluating 
each MA process has been introduced in [15]. The MAID 
method has four phases comprising (1) Measurement 
Planning, (2) Data Collection and Storage, (3) Data Analysis, 
and 
(4) 
Measurement 
Reporting. 
The 
criteria 
are 
implemented by evaluation team in the 2nd and 3rd phase. We 
tried to apply MAID method to appraise the CMMI-based 
MA process. Some activities have been selected to be 
implemented, such as Review MA documents, Conduct 
interviews and examinations, etc. However, the criteria cover 
various issues including data analysis, reporting, process 
documentation, etc. Another interesting approach is called 
“Standard 
CMMI 
Appraisal 
Method 
for 
Process 
Improvement (SCAMPI)”, which supports evaluation of 
CMMI-based 
process 
in 
term 
of 
opportunity 
for 
improvement (OFI).  There are A, B and C types; SCAMPI 
A is the official appraisal and others will reduce strictness, 
respectively.  Figure 4 presents an appraisal direction [16]. 
 
 
 
Figure. 4. An example of appraisal method [17] 
 
C. Goal-Question-Metric Paradigm (GQM) 
Goal-Question-Metric Paradigm is invented Basili [19] 
from the University of Maryland College Park and Software 
Engineering Laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight 
Center. This approach is based on the idea of goal-oriented 
measurement. In Figure 8, we apply GQM approach to 
analyze the measures. We started with analyzing the 
organizational goals, which came from the executive policy 
and found out related measures leading to achieve those 
goals via a set of questions.  GQM approach can divided into 
three levels, as shown in the Figure 5: 
 
Conceptual Level (Goal): We set up Business Goals 
that is the goal in the measurement goals. 
 
Operational Level (Question): We define a set of 
questions to achieve the goal. 
 
Quantitative Level  (Metric): We formulate the 
measure to answer the question in Operational 
Level.

MEASUREMENT IMPLEMENTATION 
A. A Set of Measures for R&D Organization 
Primary quality attributes, which impact achievement of 
the SPI program, are summarized in 5 categories involving 
performance, 
stability, 
compliance, 
capability, 
and 
improvement [7].  Organizational Metrics are aligned with 
these categories to specify their values. For Project Level,   
there are different quality attributes categories and 
supporting metrics. An example of metrics in each category 
is shown in Table I.

The appropriate measures depend on the organization’s 
strategy, technology, and economic situation [7].  From a 
survey, top 10 project measures consist of ROI (Return on 
Investment), Productivity, Cost of Quality, Cost of 
Performance, Schedule Performance, Customer Satisfaction, 
Cycle 
Time, 
Requirements 
Performance, 
Employee 
Satisfaction and Alignment to Strategic Business Goals [7].

works leading to different measures.

It is impossible to record all data to respond the related 
measurement. Thus, the organization should consider the 
measures from the needs of the executive. How to get data 
supporting all measures for R&D works has many channels 
such as GQM, MAID, CMMI, Lesson learned, etc.     
Figure 7 presents three types of indicators including 
success indicators, progress indicators, and analysis 
indicators [11]. EPG can apply this idea to find out the 
measures.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7. Types of indicators [11] 
B. Implementation in R&D Unit 
Generally, many organizations including NECTEC start 
to follow Specific Goals and Practices of Measurement 
Process Area.  NECTEC’s EPG established a lot of data for 
achieving measurement goals but finally users could not 
record all established inputs because they needed a lot of 
effort (to understand, to record, to attend, etc.).  Moreover, 
the recorded data was not correct because they usually 
recorded after related activities had occurred although there 
were templates to support them completely.  Finally, the 
process 
improvement 
program 
could 
not 
achieve 
measurement activities.   
Figure 8 presents mapping the organizational needs to 
related MA processes and established analysis methods. 
Table III shows the lesson learned from NECTEC’s CMMI 
implementation (2010-2011) including its strengths and 
weaknesses. Each role in a project has to record data for 
supporting the measurement process. There are 10 different 
templates for project manager to input the data which 
depends on applied processes. Figure 9 shows an example 
of MA templates and Table IV proposes the new 
information needs and how to obtain the best measures for 
NECTEC or R&D organization comparing strategy from 
CMMI and GQM.

D. Tailoring the Process 
There 
are 
two 
levels 
for 
tailoring 
software 
development 
process. 
 
Firstly, 
it 
focuses 
on 
organizational process which NECTEC’s EPG tries to 
optimize Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) 
models from brainstorming of stakeholders.  There are 
other related processes, such as training process, 
improvement process, etc. They have to be consistent 
with organizational policies and goals. Another level is 
to tailor processes and products in each project. How 
can one know that each tailoring can respond the 
information needs completely?  A product tailoring 
template should be established for stakeholder who 
requests to do other products instead.  What is the best 
criterion for tailoring the process and the product 
responding to organizational goals?  Currently, EPG has 
to examine each tailoring in each project. If you want to 
focus on quality of process improvement works, you 
also have to realize appropriate conditions for tailoring 
the 
product. 
However, 
alternatives 
should 
be 
considered.  
 
IV. 
OPTIMIZING MEASURES FOR R&D ORGANIZATION 
A. Measures in R&D Organization 
This paper presents NECTEC to be representative of 
R&D organization.  We start from current business goals as 
follows. The measures which come from GQM and survey 
result are identified as follows: 
 
Tracking of the project: Milestone completion, 
Resource utilization, Risk impact and reduction, 
Project Completions per year, Number of active/on –
hold/closed projects, periodically.  
 
Quality of the project: Product defects, Defects by 
activity, Deviation from standard. 
 
Error/fault/failure rates, Product failures, Customer 
complaints. 
 
Return on Investment (ROI): Investment in 
R&D/Project Cost, Evaluated benefits from applying 
related products periodically, Comparison between 
cost and evaluated benefits, Customer satisfaction/ 
dissatisfaction, Customer Retention. 
 
Engineering 
Excellence: 
Depth 
width 
and 
knowledge, 
Skills 
and 
productivity, 
Building 
character to perform within moral and ethical 
framework.

measures in the project level can use some measures from 
the organizational level and add some measures which 
impacts to achieve the project goals such as measures 
proposed to the 1st-2nd   business goals.  Besides the tailoring 
the process also has to support the established measures 
especially in project aspect. Figure 11 shows an example of 
duplicated measures in different aspects [6]. 
 
 
Figure 11. An example of duplicated measures in different aspects 
 
B. Tailoring Criteria for R&D Organization 
Another important activity which needs measures 
properly for implementing the project is SW development 
Process Tailoring. Five main causes enforce EPG to tailor 
the 
process 
including 
resource, 
communication,   
requirement management, political and technical [8]. The 
process includes all related documentation such as SDLC, 
template, guideline, etc.  Concerning the lesson learned, EPG 
should tailor the SDLC covering all types of the R&D 
projects. Currently, NECTEC has tailored the SDLC into 3 
types involving waterfall, rapid prototyping, and adaptive 
models.  Each model has different documents that authorized 
person can request to tailor the documents with his/her 
reasons.  EPG will consider the requests in 2 aspects, which 
cover related standard goals and established measures.   
     Another challenge issue needed is to find criteria for 
choosing the appropriate process (global process model and 
methods and tools supporting those models), evaluating its 
suitability and improving it continuously [9]. Referring to the 
characteristics of R&D works, the measures should be 
established to evaluate its consistency with the information 
needs.   There are two tailoring level including organization 
and project levels. The tailoring approach is one of the 
improvement methodologies.  Purpose of tailoring the 
process in a project is data collection to indicate all 
candidates of process and work product in R&D work.  
Error, fault and failure analysis are selected to respond the 
tailoring purpose.  Furthermore, measures which should be 
also realized for tailoring the process effectively include 
coverage attribute following the standard process and 
established measures. EPG has to consider quality in 
coverage for tailoring both process and work products.  The 
criteria supporting EPG to validate the tailored process is 
proposed as follows:  
 
Measures, which respond the organization/project 
goals from tailoring processes, are still recorded. 
 
Measures, which respond the organization/project 
goals from tailoring products are still recorded. 
 
Tailoring 
Processes 
still 
respond 
to 
organization/project goals comparing with default 
processes. 
 
Tailoring 
Products 
still 
respond 
to 
organization/project goals comparing with default 
products. 
 
The process (including related products) still 
responds to established requirements. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presented how to implement MA process in 
R&D organization and proposes an idea to improve it 
including measure analysis and tailoring conditions.   To 
apply international frameworks can make officers work 
professionally. The R&D organization has specific business 
goal which impacts to establish the measures for indicating 
quantified improvement level.  Tailoring the process is a 
measure which supports flexible process.  How to tailor the 
process effectively needs to be analyzed systematically. 
 A set of measures has to adjust in parallel with changed 
business goals.  Moreover, supporting data should be 
recorded automatically and should not be operated 
repeatedly by project team.  It is a challenge for the next 
research to refine better processes and measures by analyzing 
actual result continuously and make them more generic and 
systematic for distributing their advantages to others.
