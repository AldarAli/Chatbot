Abstract—In this paper, a channel model on transport layer 
over Ka-band links is proposed, which apparently reflects the 
characteristics of rain attenuation and equivalent noise 
temperature from the earth’s atmosphere. The proposed model 
is built on a four-state Markov chain, which considered the 
different features of various packet types during CCSDS File 
Delivery Protocol (CFDP) transactions. We provide the exact 
criterion on how to divide different weather conditions at each 
state, and give the analytical results on transition probability 
matrix. In particular, we take Guangzhou in China as an 
example to find the probability distribution function of rain 
attenuation, and thus the transition matrix between different 
states, based on ITU-R rain attenuation model. The simulation 
results show that, compared with two state channel model, the 
proposed 
model 
could 
efficiently 
describe 
the 
error 
characteristics of different packet types during the file delivery, 
which leads to obvious degradations on CFDP performance.

INTRODUCTION  
Ka-band with largely available frequency bandwidth will 
greatly increase the capabilities and capacity of the future 
space networks. Although Ka-band links can bring obvious 
gains for communication system, it is highly vulnerable to 
ﬂuctuating weather condition, such as the rainfall. Rainfall 
not only attenuates the signal power level of the signal at the 
receiver, but also makes the system noise temperature 
increased. These two aspects further worsen the signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) and make BERs of the system over long 
distance increased. On the other hand, high BERs will 
degrade the reliable delivery on the scientific data, due to 
frequent retransmissions on the missing data packets.  
For file-based scientific data return, CCSDS puts forward 
CCSDS File Delivery Protocol  (CFDP), instead of  its 
terrestrial counterpart (File Transfer Protocol, FTP), which is 
designed to provide file-based data storage management, 
store-and-forward relay, and reliable data transfer over space 
links characterized by large propagation delay and 
intermittent availability[1]. The CFDP employs Automatic 
Repeat reQuest (ARQ) retransmission mechanism to file 
reliable delivery, which is significantly affected by the 
earth’s weather over Ka-band links. In [2], the latency of 
CFDP over Ka-band is analyzed theoretically, based on a 
two-state Markov chain channel. This two-state model, 
denoted by Gilbert-Elliot channel model [3], divides simply 
the different weather conditions over Ka-band link into two 
states of ―good‖ and ―bad‖ respectively. Especially, it 
exploits a large number of atmospheric noise temperature 
data sampled by DSNs of NASA, from which a threshold is 
determined to separate two weather states. In [4], a new 
statistical approach for deep-space communications links 
design was formulated and optimal link design strategies 
over Ka-band has been presented by using the atmospheric 
noise temperature statistics and the ground antenna 
characteristics to optimize the average data return on the link. 
A wide-area environment two-state channel model including 
―ideal state‖ and ―non-ideal state‖ was proposed in [5], 
model parameters under three kinds of typical channel 
environments were fitted by using the statistics method of 
experimental data. Maruddani et al. [6] evaluated the 
performance of Ka-band wireless communication system in 
tropical area by comparing several channel coding schemes. 
In the CFDP, PDUs are divided into different types due 
to their specified roles in the file transfer, with different 
length. Weather impairments on different types of PDUs 
over Ka-band links could produce unequal performance 
degradation, since the PDUs with different length could be 
lost or received independently at the same BER. Therefore, it 
is necessary to take the diversified influence of different 
types of PDUs into account when we model the channel 
characteristics over Ka-band weather dependent links. In this 
paper, we attempt to solve this problem by constructing 
multi-state channel model, in which each state reflects on the 
individual effects of the different PDUs. This paper has two 
following novel contributions: a) we built a four-state 
Markov channel model on transport layer over Ka-band links 
constructed with rain attenuation and system noise 
temperature together, which is not considered in the original 
two-state Gilbert-Elliot channel model. Thus combine the 
physical characteristics over Ka-band links on transport layer; 
b) In the model given, we determined the different states of 
channel by considering specified functions of PDU types of 
the CFDP, which could exactly characterize the influence on 
file delivery performance over Ka-band channel. 
In Section II, we describe the CFDP file transfer process, 
and Gilbert-Elliot channel model has been introduced. In 
Section III, we divide the weather state into several types 
based on different types of PDUs in the CFDP, and give the 
derivation of the theoretical formulas, then some simulations 
is shown to find out the weather-related parameters in this 
model. The simulation of the delay performance of CFDP 
under this model with Monte Carlo algorithm, indicating the 
validity of the model by comparing the channel with others, 
have been shown in Section IV, followed by conclusions in 
Section V.

II. CFDP AND GILBERT-ELLIOT CHANNEL MODEL 
A. Process of CFDP deferred NAK mode transmission 
CFDP has four error control modes to handle the link 
disruptions and outages frequently encountered in space. In 
this study, we used the CFDP deferred NAK mode since it is 
the most generally used form of CFDP for space link [1]. 
For the CFDP file transfer, each file is divided into 
multiple protocol data units (PDUs). The sender will send 
Metadata PDU (MPDU) first, and then send PDUs to the 
receiver. The end of file PDU (EOF-PDU) is sent at the end 
of the initial transmission attempt. The receiving entity saves 
all information about missing data until the EOF is received. 
It then issues a NAK listing all the PDUs that were not 
successfully received. Upon the reception of this NAK 
message, the sender side retransmits the PDUs and the 
receiver will again responds with NAK messages until all 
PDUs are received correctly; then, the receiver will send 
finished message (FIN) to the sender and close the file 
transmission [7], as shown in Fig. 1.

B. Gilbert-Elliot Channel 
We define the weather-dependent transport layer channel 
of CFDP as an erasure channel, which is generally described 
by Gilbert-Elliot model. There are two weather states in 
Gilbert-Elliot channel model, ―good‖ and ―bad‖ weather 
conditions. If it is good weather state, most of the transmitted 
packets will be received successfully. If not, however, most 
of the transmitted packets will experience errors due to bad 
weather condition. Therefore, two different BERs are 
applying to two different weather conditions. The weather 
state undergoes stochastic transitions, as shown in Fig. 2, and 
the transition from one state to another is defined by the 
transition matrix P.

We attempt to give the fact that, the performance of the 
CFDP over two-state weather channel model is worse than 
that of single-state AWGN channel model, through the 
comparison between them by Monte-Carlo simulations. The 
simulation parameters are shown in Table I.

Fig. 3 shows that the average transmission number of the 
CFDP over two-state weather model is slightly more than 
that of the single-state model, as a result of taking the bad 
weather into account. It is indicated that the two-state model 
could reflect the characteristic of the real weather dependent 
channel to a small extent. Also, the result of simulation with 
different combinations of good and bad weather BER pairs: 
(1e-5, 1e-3), (1e-6, 1e-3), (1e-7, 1e-3), and (1e-8, 1e-3) in 
two-state model, shows that different pairs produce different 
average retransmission numbers. It means that, the division 
criterion of the weather state have a nontrivial effect on the 
performance of the CFDP.

III. FOUR-STATE WEATHER CHANNEL MODEL 
A. The method of modeling 
We determined the different states of channel by 
considering specified functions of PDU types of the CFDP. 
In the CFDP, different types of PDUs have different lengths 
and functions [8]. We group the PDUs into three types 
according to the different lengths. The first type includes

Prompt PDU, ACK PDU, and EOF PDU with the length of 
approximate 30Bytes; the second type contains Metadata 
PDU, File data PDU, and Finished PDU with the length of 
approximate 1024Bytes; another type of PDU is NAK PDU 
with the variable length, which changes as the number of the 
lost PDUs during the process of file transport, as shown in 
Table II. 
TABLE II.  
THE TYPES OF PDUS IN THE CFDP                                 
 
We attempt to include respective possibility of errors 
occurred in different types of PDUs into the channel model, 
since the lengths of different types of PDUs (Lpdu) have 
obvious disparity. In this section, we design a multi-state 
channel model to distinguish the error rate of different types 
of PDUs, which could combine better with CFDP 
characteristics than the traditional two-state model. Our 
proposed weather dependent channel has four state divided 
by different BERs. The method of modeling is presented in 
the following way: 
We know the relationship between packet error rates P 
and bit error rates:

                          
The error probability of the first PDU type is very small 
for its length is very short, and the second PDU type is the 
longest one, so it will lost when the environment of 
transmission is bad. We assume that the receive message is 
right when packet error rates is under 0.01, and the links 
break off when the packet error rates is above 0.5. So, we 
take 0.01 and 0.5 as two threshold values. We calculate the 
upper boundry BERs γ of different PDUs shown in Table III.

The proposed model contains a good state and three bad 
ones. Given a good weather state we predetermined, we 
divided three rainfall states by two BERs threshold in the 
case of packet error rates is 0.01, We use the BER 
corresponding to packet error rates is 0.5 as the upper 
boundary of the BERs. By doing this, we obtain a four 
weather states of channel model. 
In this model, we assume that the transition occurs only 
between neighboring states since the changing of weather 
conditions could conforms better to the characteristic of the 
first order Markov process, as shown in Fig. 4. Let T be the 
state transmission matrix as shown below, the channel could 
be represented from a state transmission matrix:

Above formulas give a specific relationship between

thresholds to divide weather conditions. 
We take Guangzhou in China (typical subtropical 
monsoon climate) as an example in this section, in order to  
find the PDF of the rain attenuate by using a set of rain data 
(ARi ,Pi), i=1,…,N, which are sampled from the ITU_R rain 
attenuate model[11,12]. In particular, ARi is the value of the 
rain attenuation being exceeded in Pi time in every statistics

To obtain the state transmission matrix (4), we firstly 
need to calculate Nk, which is the number of times that 
attenuation crossed a given threshold lk in single direction 
per second. The fade slope fk is a measure of the time rate of 
change of attenuation at a given threshold lk in units of 
(dB/sec) as defined in [14]. Then, we can calculate Nk 
approximatively by the multiplication of fk and the value of 
PDF at a given threshold lk in [15]:

IV. SIMULATION  AND DISCUSSION 
In this section, we evaluate the performance of CFDP 
under the four-state weather channel model by Monte Carlo 
simulations.  
First, CFDP is evaluated over various BERs with 
different sizes of files as 1MB, 5MB and 10MB separately in 
single-state channel. Fig. 8 shows that with the BERs 
increases, the average retransmission number of PDUs 
increase significantly. Under the same BER, the average 
retransmission number of PDUs increases with the size of 
files. In Fig. 9, the loss of NAK message occurs in the case 
that BER is more than 1e-5, which indicates the performance 
of the CFDP is seriously affected by weather conditions, 
especially bad weather. Therefore, weather effect must be 
considered in analyzing of the CFDP performance.

We can find that the results of the CFDP performance 
under the four-state weather model are between that under 
the two-state model and single-state model. The results have 
evident decrease on the base of two-state model due to the 
further revision of weather conditions. It means that the 
channel we modeled characterizes better the dynamic 
process of weather conditions.

From the channel model, we can get the detailed NAK 
message which is vital to the whole link. Fig. 11 (a) shows 
the average transmission number of NAK. And the average 
number of missing NAK is shown in Fig. 11 (b). Similarly, 
The result of the four-state weather model has an evident 
decrease compared with the two-state model. The model 
could approach to the real channel characteristics more 
efficiently as a result of the careful revision of weather 
conditions change.

As a result, the four-state weather channel model gives a 
accurate description of the detailed dynamic process of 
weather states, and reflects more efficiently on the impact of 
weather conditions change on channel performance. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study, we established the four-state weather 
channel model on transport layer of CFDP considering the 
propagation characteristics, including rain attenuation and 
equivalent noise temperature over Ka-band links. The 
proposed model could evaluate the performance of CFDP 
over Ka-band channel model efficiently, by reflecting on the 
impact of weather conditions into modeling channel. In

particular, we design a elaborated-designed division criterion 
to the weather conditions and divided the weather states by 
the BERs from the transport layer. The results indicated that 
the proposed model is more reasonable as it gives realistic 
results. Moreover, the four-state weather model give a 
accurate description of the detailed dynamic process of 
weather states, thus reflects more efficiently on the impact of 
weather conditions on channel. 
Future work should take an emphasis on validation the 
results with actual measurements, meanwhile, using a high-
order Markov chain model in order to accurately simulate 
weather processes.
