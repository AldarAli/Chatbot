Abstract—The present article is aiming at presenting different 
Operations, 
Administration 
and 
Maintenance 
(OAM) 
procedures that are used for Multiprotocol Label Switching 
(MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  We start by giving a 
quick review of what is MPLS-TP, and what makes it the 
solution for the Next Generation Network (NGN). This paper 
exposes the problem of having two standards on the MPLS-TP 
OAM Toolset. We highlight the difference between the two 
approaches and why they are not interoperable. We propose, 
as future work, to use a layered model solution in order to by-
pass this issue.

 INTRODUCTION 
While 
Time 
Division 
Multiplexing 
(TDM)-based 
technologies 
[1] 
ex. 
Synchronous 
Optical 
Network 
(SONET), and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) has 
been for a long time a major player for transport, it shows 
weakness in the case of traffic burst such as packetized voice 
and video. This happens because of the fast growth of the 
demand for service sophistication and expansion (Triple 
Play, 3G / Long Term Evolution LTE, Cloud Virtualization). 
Carriers need to migrate from Time-Division Multiplexing 
(TDM) to packet in order to meet Packet Transport Network 
(PTN) requirements and to make efforts to minimize the cost 
for providing these services. 
A Joint Working Team created by ITU-T and IETF is 
actually developing a new packet transport technology 
(MPLS-TP) taking benefits from existing MPLS networking 
infrastructure [2].  
MPLS-TP is intended to provide all the advantages of the 
packet-based transport approach, while delivering at the 
same time, the reliability, availability, OAM capabilities and 
manageability features associated with traditional TDM 
transport networks.  It is a subset of IP/MPLS protocol suite 
with new extensions which allow addressing transport 
network requirements. These extensions consists of adapting 
current MPLS to make it more “Transport like” by inheriting 
OAM , reliability and operational simplicity from 
SONET/SDH networks.  
There are two approaches for MPLS-TP OAM at the 
standardization organizations and no industry agreement on 
that. The solutions are based on IETF and ITU-T 
recommendations. Both of OAM proposed solutions are in-
band. The IETF solution is based on the existing MPLS 
OAM tool [3], while the ITU-T solution is based on Ethernet 
OAM (Y.1731) [4]. 
In order to best understand the impact of having two 
distinct standards for MPLS-TP OAM, we need to know if 
both of them are meeting requirements and how Carriers 
should take in consideration during implementation. 
This paper starts by presenting fundamentals of MPLS-
TP. Then we will give the actual picture of the MPLS-TP 
OAM toolset status and how it can be an issue. Finally, we 
propose a solution to overcome the problem. 
II. 
WHAT IS MPLS-TP ? 
MPLS-TP is aimed to be based on the same architectural 
concepts of layered network that are already used in legacy 
SONET/SDH [5]. IP/MPLS [6] and MPLS-TP [7] are 
willing to be the main packet technologies deployed in 
Ethernet Backhaul Access’s and Aggregation’s Network for 
the next five years. Figure 1 illustrates how MPLS-TP takes 
the best of two worlds: OAM performance and maturity of 
TDM (SONET/SDH), and Control/Data Plane efficiency of 
IP/MPLS. 
MPLS-TP has the following key characteristics:

- Connection oriented: Equal cost Multi-Path ECMP and 
Multi-point to Point (MP2P) are excluded to ensure that, 
Penultimate Hop Popping PHP is disabled by default; 
- L2/L3’s client agnosticism; 
- Control Plane: static or dynamic Generalized MPLS 
(GMPLS); 
- Physical layer agnostic: allowing MPLS packets to be 
delivered over a variety of physical infra-structures including 
Ethernet, SONET/SDH and Optical Transport Network 
(OTN) 
using 
Generic 
Framing 
Procedure 
(GFP), 
Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM), etc; 
• 
Strong OAM functions similar to those available in 
legacy 
optical 
transport 
networks 
(e.g., 
SONET/SDH, OTN);  
• 
Path protection mechanisms and control plane-based 
mechanism; 
• 
Use of Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) to 
support 
Fault, 
Configuration, 
Accounting, 
Performance and Security (FCAPS) functions; 
• 
Network provisioning via a centralized Network 
management system (NMS) and/or a distributed 
control plane. 
Based on the relative standards and recommendations, 
MPLS-TP is a solution based on existing Pseudo-wire (PW) 
and Label Switched Path (LSP). MPLS-TP supports two 
native service adaptation mechanisms via:  
• 
A PW to emulate certain services, for example, 
Ethernet,  Frame Relay, or Point-to-Point Protocol 
(PPP) / High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC). 
These 
adaptation 
functions 
are 
the 
payload 
encapsulation; see Figure 2. 
• 
An LSP, to provide adaptation for any native service 
traffic type like IP packets and MPLS-labeled 
packets (i.e., PW over LSP, or IP over LSP). The 
adaptation function uses the MPLS encapsulation 
format; see Figure 3. 
The major attributes of MPLS-TP protocol’s suite are: 
• 
Data Plane: remains exactly the same as MPLS to 
facilitate interoperability with MPLS; 
• 
Control Plane: optional, dynamic via IP based 
protocols or static via management platform NMS; 
• 
OAM: transport-like OAM; 
• 
 Protection and Resiliency: SDH-like; 
In this paper, we focus on the OAM attribute in order to 
demystify their role and which will be the impact of having 
two standards options. 
III. 
OAM TOOLSET 
MPLS-TP has a robust and a transport-like operations 
and management (OAM) capabilities. Carriers use OAM to 
provide reliable services with guaranteed service level 
agreements (SLA), while minimizing troubleshooting time 
and reducing operational expenses.  
The general MPLS-TP OAM requirements are: 
• 
Proactive 
(continuous) 
monitoring 
features, 
including 
continuity 
supervision, 
connectivity 
supervision, signal quality supervision (packet loss, 
frame 
delay, 
frame 
delay 
variation), 
alarm 
suppression, remote quality and continuity indication 
• 
Proactive monitoring applications, including Fault 
management, 
Performance/SLA 
monitoring, 
Protection switching 
• 
Re-active/on-demand monitoring, including fault 
localization, 
signal 
quality 
measurement 
(throughput, ordering and error measurement, 
transfer 
delay, 
delay 
variation 
and 
jitter 
measurement) 
• 
Communication 
channels, 
including 
protection 
switching 
head/tail-end 
coordination, 
network 
management, remote node management, service 
management [8]: 
There is three kind of OAM: Hop-by-hop (e.g., control 
plane based), Out-of-band OAM (e.g., User Datagram 
Protocol UDP return path) and In-band OAM (e.g., PW 
Associated Channel ACh). Within the MPLS, the ACh is 
known as technique for in-band Virtual Circuit Connectivity 
Verification (VCCV) applicable only for PW, while LSPs 
have no mechanism to differentiate user packets from OAM 
packets [9]. MPLS-TP extended the ACh to the Generic 
Associated Channel (G-ACh) and introduced a new label G
‐ACh Alert Label (GAL) to identify packets on the G-Ach. 
It is an in-band management channel on a PW or LSP that 
does not rely on routing, user traffic, or dynamic control 
plane functions. The OAM packets can then share the same 
path of user traffic, operate on a per-domain basis and/or 
across multiple domains, and are able to be configured in the

absence of a control plane. This constitutes an important 
toolbox which allows carriers to run OAM at each network 
level: LSP, PW and Section [10]. 
The network model of MPLS-TP OAM consists of: 
• 
Different OAM Level (administrative domains). 
Each Level can be independently monitored by its 
own Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management 
(CFM) frames. The scope of OAM frames is limited 
to the domain in which the carried information is 
significant. 
• 
Two plans; see Figure 4:  
o 
A “vertical plan” (red) that represents the 
OAM 
entities 
across 
different 
administrative domains,  
o 
An “horizontal plan” (blue) that represents 
the 
OAM 
entities 
within 
a 
single 
administrative domain. 
The Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) is the portion of 
the transport path that is being monitored or maintained. 
MEG endpoints are referred as management end points 
(MEPs) and intermediated nodes are referred as management 
intermediate points (MIPs). OAM message can be 
exchanged between MEPs, or from one MEP to other MIP. 
MEP handle OAM packet when it arrives at Label Edge 
Router (LER) because the label is popped and then the GAL 
is exposed which allow MEP to start processing by the 
corresponding OAM function. MIP can handle OAM packet 
using Time To Leave (TTL) mechanism. The TTL expiration 
causes the packet to be processed, and the existence of the 
GAL under the label for which the TTL expired causes the 
packet to be processed. MIPs cannot initiate OAM message, 
but may send an answer.   
There are two proposed standards for MPLS-TP OAM 
and no industry agreement on that. They are based on IETF 
(G.8113.2) and ITU-T (G.8113.1) recommendations [11].  
A. ITU-T OAM Tools G.8113.1 
 
ITU-T suggests reuse the same OAM Protocol Data 
Units (PDUs) and procedures defined in Ethernet OAM ITU-
T Y.1731 [12]. The presence of Y.1731 OAM PDU is 
identified by a single ACH channel Type (0xXXXX). Within 
the OAM PDU, the OpCode field allows identifying the type 
of OAM frame. 
 
The ITU-T OAMs provide a set of mechanisms that 
meets the MPLS-TP OAM requirements. The methods and 
procedure supported are listed in Table. 1:

 This OAM toolset claims to be mature and widely 
deployed. It is still under consensus of standardization. 
However G.8113.1 requires a G-Ach codepoint to be 
assigned by IANA (IETF). 
B. IETF OAM Tools G.8113.2 
The IETF solution is based on the existing MPLS OAM 
toolset and provides the following functions: CC for 
proactive monitoring, CV for End-point verification, PM, 
FM and Diagnostics. This solution needs specifics 
extensions of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) and 
LSP Ping and needs also to introduce new mechanisms for 
the function that are not available in MPLS such as loss and 
delay measurement. BFD and LSP should be able to run 
without IP (IP less). The methods and procedure supported 
are listed in Table. 2:

IETF has overcome to luck of MPLS OAM by extending 
BFD and LSP Ping, and also by creating new tools in order 
to satisfy Transport-like OAM expectations. 
 
Since both of solutions are meeting MPLS-TP OAM 
requirements, the selection criteria depend on each scenario: 
• 
Different operators have different network scenarios  
• 
Different vendors have different implementations. 
G.8113.1 is supported by Alcatel-Lucent and Huawei 
Technologies Co. Ltd. and by carriers China Mobile 
Communications Corp. and Telecom Italia SpA. The 
G.8113.2 camp, meanwhile, counts Cisco Systems Inc. and 
Ericsson AB among its supporters. 
IV. 
INTEROPERABILITY OR INTERWORKING : ISSUES 
ITU-T continues to standardize its Y.1731 based OAM 
solution, and is currently using an “experimental” MPLS 
OAM. IETF, on their side, published about many RFCs last 
year in order to complete their MPLS based OAM solution. 
Both of proposed standards claim to satisfy MPLS-TP OAM 
requirements. The biggest difference is the PDU format and 
how to identify 
an OAM function which makes 
interoperability impossible. When both solutions are present 
in the same network, or when interconnecting two different 
networks using different OAM solution, delivering end-to-
end OAM become an issue. 
The first option to resolve this issue is by implementing 
Interworking Function (IWF) at edge router to secure the 
mapping of different OAM message. This is also the most 
expensive option, since vendors have to develop IWF on 
their equipments. 
The second one is to choose a network model in such a 
way to use the layered characteristics of MPLS-TP OAM: 
Section OAM (Link OAM), PW OAM, and LSP OAM. We 
suggest here, when possible, to run MPLS-TP OAM 
independently within each segment; see 
Figure 5. 
Maintenance Entity (ME) that exchange OAM inside the 
same Maintenance Domain has to use same OAM toolset. So 
“Operator Network 1” and “Operator Network 2” can run 
different OAM Toolset. Layered architecture can be based 
on peer or overlay model, or a mixture (hybrid). 
We need to study the layered architecture to figure out 
how it is resolving MPLS-TP OAM interoperability issues 
with respect to standard requirements. An OAM discovery 
mechanism can be a solution where each MEP inside a 
maintenance domain will discover other MEPs and then 
exchange their capabilities. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
It is sufficient to have only one OAM solution for MPLS-
TP, however there is two standard or pre-standard toolset and 
both of them are supported by industry. Consequently, 
equipment and network deployments will be more complex 
and interoperability issues are becoming reality. Introduction 
of new interworking functions can present a solution but are 
cost effective and software/hardware update will be more 
complex. We propose to use layering model which can avoid 
developing IWF in a lot of cases. We suggest creating new 
capabilities on border Node (at layer level) which allow 
dynamic exchange of OAM information: Type of toolset, 
MEs, MEPs, MIPs, etc. the associated Channel ACh would 
be a good starting point of this vision.
