Abstract—This paper presents a resource allocation algorithm
for multi-user wireless networks with non-persistent co-channel
interference. The analysis considers a network with one base
station (BS) that employs an N multiple antenna transmitter
(beamformer) to schedule (in a time-division format) a set of
J one-antenna terminals in the presence of K non-persistent
interferers. The transmitter is assumed to employ Maximum-
Ratio Combining (MRC) beamforming with spatially-correlated
branches and channel envelopes modelled as Rice-distributed pro-
cesses. The BS has access to an imperfect (outdated) copy of the
instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) of each terminal.
Based on this CSI at the transmitter side (CSIT), the BS proceeds
to select (at each time interval or time-slot) the terminal with the
highest measured channel strength. This imperfect CSIT is also
used to calculate the coefﬁcients of the beamformer that will be
used to transmit information towards the scheduled terminal, as
well as for selecting the most appropriate modulation format (via
threshold-based decision). The main merits of this work are the
following: 1) joint analysis of MRC-based beamforming, terminal
scheduling based on maximum channel strength, and modulation
assignment, and 2) impact analysis of spatial correlation, line-
of-sight (LOS), co-channel interference, and imperfect CSIT.
Results suggest that maximum channel strength scheduling helps
in rejecting co-channel interference and the degrading effects
of imperfect CSIT (due to multi-user diversity gains). Spatial
correlation could some times lead to better performance than
the uncorrelated case, particularly in the low SNR (Signal-to-
Noise Ratio) regime. Conversely, uncorrelated branches always
outperform the correlated case in the high SNR regime. Spatial
correlation tends to accumulate over the antenna array thus
leading to a more noticeable performance degradation and more
allocation errors due to the outdated CSIT assumption. The LOS
channel component is found to contribute to a better reception in
general, but it also reduces the ability to counteract the degrading
effects of imperfect CSIT due to the lack of diversity combining
gains.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple antenna systems (also known as MIMO or
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output systems) are expected to pro-
liferate in the coming years, particularly in the context of 5G
or ﬁfth-generation of wireless systems [1][2]. The growing
demand for wireless connectivity, the limited transmission
resources, and the outdated spectrum allocation paradigm
have created the need for more efﬁcient, scalable and higher
capacity transmission systems. MIMO technology offers con-
siderable capacity growth that escalates with the number of
transmit-receive antenna pairs (see [3] for an overview of
capacity in MIMO channels). MIMO also offers improved
energetic efﬁciency and reduced interference with minimum
spectrum expenditure.
From the many different types of multiple antenna systems,
perhaps beamforming technology represents the option with
higher potential for commercial implementation, mainly due
to its maturity, ﬂexible implementation, and low computational
costs (in comparison with other MIMO solutions). Beam-
forming refers to the ability to dynamically steer the phases
of an antenna array and change the directionality properties
of the resulting radiation beams. This enables a wide set
of applications in multi-user settings, such as: interference
rejection/management [4], spatial multiplexing [5], and more
recently (with a few modiﬁcations) 3D beamforming with
massive MIMO in 5G [6], beam-division multiple access [7],
and interference alignment [8]. Other works in beamforming
can be found in [9]-[11]. In future networks, beamforming
will be key for efﬁciently organizing spectrum resources in
dense cooperative small cells, as well as minimizing energy
expenditure, reducing leakage and/or interference to adjacent
cells or terminals, and also for improving security against
potential attacks of signal jamming or eavesdropping in the
network.
All these advances in the PHYsical (PHY) layer of multiple
antenna systems need to be integrated/optimised with upper-
layer algorithms, particularly with radio resource management
(see [12]-[18]). This has opened several issues regarding the
cross-layer design and optimization of beamforming and in
general multiple-antenna systems. One particularly important
topic in this ﬁeld is the modelling of the underlying multi-
ple antenna signal processing tools to be used in resource
allocation and system-level evaluation frameworks. In large
network set ups with tens or hundreds of BSs and hundreds
or thousands of terminals, all the parameters of the PHY-
layer cannot be usually included in full detail in the analysis
or system-level simulation loop. Therefore, a trade-off must
be found between the accuracy of the model that represents
the underlying PHY-layer and its ﬂexibility for purposes of
resource allocation and optimisation at the system-level.
This paper attempts to partially ﬁll these gaps by ad-
dressing the link-layer interface modelling in Rice fading
correlated channels of an adaptive wireless multi-user network
using Maximum-Ratio Combining (MRC) beamforming and
terminal scheduling based on limited (outdated) feedback.
The transmitter selects the most adequate Modulation and
Coding Schemes (MCSs) and beamforming vectors based on
an estimated Channel State Information (CSI). This imperfect
CSI at the transmitter side (i.e., CSIT) is assumed to have
been initially collected by the receiver (perfect estimation), and

subsequently reported back to the transmitter via a feedback
channel affected by delay (outdated information). This paper
presents the analysis of the statistics of correct reception
process conditional on the decision made by the transmitter
(modulation format selection, beamforming and scheduling)
based on the inaccurate CSIT. Link-layer throughput is eval-
uated by means of an interface model based on an instanta-
neous Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) adaptive
switching threshold scheme for modulation assignment. This
model aims to provide an accurate but ﬂexible representation
of the underlying PHY-layer suitable for upper-layer design.
In the proposed model, a packet transmission using a given
MCS is considered as correctly received with given values of
BLock-Error Rate (BLER) and spectral efﬁciency whenever
the instantaneous SINR exceeds the reception threshold of the
selected MCS. The reception parameters of each MCS are ob-
tained from Look-Up-Tables (LUTs) previously calculated via
off-line PHY-layer simulation. The main contribution of this
work is the joint analysis of spatial correlation, imperfect CSIT
and non-persistent co-channel interference in link adaptation
and terminal scheduling for MRC-based multiple antenna
beamforming systems. This paper constitutes an extension of
the work in the conference paper in [1] from Rayleigh channel
to include a line-of-sight (LOS) channel component, i.e., Rice
channel assumption. This paper also extends the conference
paper from persistent channel interferers to non-persistent
ones, which matches better real life settings where co-channel
systems operate under randomized trafﬁc distributions.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
previous works and the achievements of this paper with respect
to the state of the art. Section III describes the system model
and the assumptions of the paper. Section IV presents the link-
layer interface model. Section V deals with the statistics of
the estimated SNR and the instantaneous SINR. Section VI
presents analytic results and sketches of the statistics of packet
reception using different network assumptions. Finally, Section
VII presents the conclusions of this paper.

PREVIOUS WORKS
In theory, the simplest multiple antenna system is the MRC
transceiver, which provides a relatively ﬂexible framework
for statistical analysis, interface modelling, and resource man-
agement. The literature of MRC transceivers has focused on
the derivation of outage and bit error probability distributions
(see [19]-[27]). The effects of imperfect channel knowledge
on the performance of MRC receivers in Rayleigh fading
correlated channels can be found in [19]-[20] following the
analysis with perfect channel estimation presented in [21].
A series expansion of the statistics of MRC systems with
correlated Rician channels is given in [22]. A uniﬁed approach
for analysis of two-stage MRC systems with hybrid selection
in generalized Rice correlated channels was proposed in [23].
Extensions to the case of co-channel interference are given in
[24]-[27].
The present work considers the extension of outage prob-
ability analysis of MRC transmitters (beamformers) to the
study of Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) in Rice
fading correlated channels with imperfect/outdated CSIT and
no-persistent co-channel interference. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst attempt in the literature that addresses
these issues under the same framework. This work attempts
to extend the analysis of MRC systems towards including
resource allocation aspects which are typical of upper layer
design (radio resource management). In addition, network
design and in particular resource allocation for multiple an-
tenna systems is usually conducted under the assumption
perfect CSIT. Imperfect CSIT has been addressed in [28] for
distributed systems and in [29] for energy efﬁcient MIMO link
adaptation. In comparison with these works, which are focused
on numerical evaluation of imperfect CSIT, this work provides
an analytic framework for obtaining the statistics of errors in
MCS assignment for correlated MRC transmitters.
The work in [30] provides a review of the state of the
art of limited feedback in adaptation schemes for MIMO
systems. The work in [31] presents the analysis of adaptive
modulation for two-antenna beam-formers considering mean
CSI at the transmitter side. The work in [32] addressed the
impact of outdated feedback on AMC and user selection
diversity systems for MIMO systems in Rayleigh uncorrelated
channels. Other works with limited feedback for different
types of system can be found in [34]-[36]. All these previous
works consider uncorrelated MIMO channels. This work goes
beyond this assumption searching for a joint analysis of limited
feedback and spatial correlation for adaptive MRC transmitters
with non-persistent co-channel interference.

SYSTEM MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
Consider the network depicted in Figure 1 with one Base
Station (BS) scheduling transmissions (in a time-division
fashion) towards J terminals , each one with one receiving
antenna, and a set of K non-persistent single-antenna interfer-
ers. The BS uses an N-antenna Maximum-Ratio Combining
(MRC) beamformer that is used to transmit information to
a given terminal at speciﬁc time slots. The channel vector
between the BS and the jth terminal is denoted by hj =
[hj(1), hj(2), . . . hj(N)]T . All instantaneous channel variables
will be modelled as non-zero-mean complex circular Gaussian
random variables with variance γ and mean ν: hj(n) ∼
CN(ν, γ). The estimated channel variable available at the
transmitter side is given by ˆhj = [ˆhj(1), ˆhj(2), . . . ˆhj(N)]T .
This information is used by the BS for purposes of beamform-
ing, terminal scheduling and resource allocation (modulation
format assignment). The channel between the interferer k
towards terminal j is denoted by hk,j and is also modelled as
a non-zero-mean complex circular Gaussian random variable
with variance λ: hk,j ∼ CN(ξ, λ). It is assumed that the
transmissions of the interferers are controlled by a binary
Bernoulli random process δk described by the parameter p:
p = Pr{δk = 1}.

Figure 1. Wireless network with one transmitter using imperfect CSIT for
scheduling, modulation assignment and beamforming information to a set of
terminals in the presence of co-channel interference.
For each terminal, the BS selects one of M modulation
formats, which are arranged in increasing order according to
their target Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR).
The target SINR of the mth MCS will be denoted by βm.
The variables θm and ηm will denote, respectively, the BLER
and spectral efﬁciency (in bps/Hz) considering operation at the
target SINR of the mth MCS. It is assumed that the receiver
monitors the quality of the channel and reports it back to the
transmitter. Based on this collected Channel State Information
(CSI), the transmitter selects the most appropriate MCS using
a correction for the decision thresholds denoted here by ˆβm.
This paper considers perfect channel estimation at the receiver
side and imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
side (CSIT). Imperfect CSIT is assumed to be mainly due to a
feedback channel affected by delay. The beamforming vector
is denoted by wj = [wj(1), wj(2), . . . , wj(N)]T , which using
the MRC criterion is given by wj = h∗
j. Therefore, the signal
received by the scheduled terminal can be mathematically
written as follows

k=1
δkhk,jˇsk + vj,
(1)
where sj is the information symbol transmitted towards ter-
minal j, ˇsk is the symbol transmitted by interferer k, δk is
the binary random variable that controls the transmissions of
the non-persistent interferers (p = Pr{δk = 1}), and vj is
the additive white Gaussian noise experienced by terminal j
with variance σ2
v: vj ∼ CN(0, σ2
v). Considering the symbol
transmit power constraint E[s∗

the transmitter side from (1) is given by:

(3)
where ρ is the spatial correlation coefﬁcient and the terms
Zj(n) and Gj are the zero-mean complex circular Gaussian
variables with variance γ. Considering that hj(n) = νj +
φj(n), the correlation model complies with E[ˆφj(n)∗ ˆφj(˜n)] =
ργ, n ̸= ˜n, and E[ˆφj(n)∗ ˆφj(n)] = γ. This correlation model
constitutes an approximation of real-life settings by assuming
that all elements experience the same correlation with each
other. In real-life systems, antennas farther apart from each
other experience less correlation than contiguous elements. The
correlation model for imperfect CSIT is given by:
hj(n) = ν + φj(n) = ν + ρc ˆφj(n) +
p
1 − ρ2cYj(n),
(4)
where ρc is the temporal correlation coefﬁcient that describes

IV.
LINK LAYER MODEL
The probability of selection of a modulation format m is
given by the probability that the estimated SNR ˆXj at the
transmitter side lies within the interval [ˆβm, ˆβm+1]:
Pr{ˆβm ≤ ˆXj < ˆβm+1}.
(6)
Link-layer throughput (denoted by T) will be expressed as a
linear contribution of all possible MCSs with their respective
selection probabilities from (6) and conditional reception prob-
abilities, each one weighted by their conditional throughput
performance (Tm):
T =
M
X
m=1
EΓj∗ [Tm(Γj∗)|ˆβm ≤ ˆXj∗ < ˆβm+1]
Pr{ˆβm ≤ ˆXj∗ < ˆβm+1}Pr{j∗ = arg max
j
ˆXj},
(7)
where Tm(Γj) indicates of the link-layer throughput of termi-
nal j when using the mth MCS conditional on a given value
of the operational SINR Γj in (5) of the selected terminal. In
this paper, we consider a simpliﬁcation of this expression, by
assuming that the term Tm(Γ) in (7) is a step function deﬁned
by a switching SINR threshold βm above which all packet
transmissions are assumed to be correctly received with a given
BLER θm and spectral efﬁciency ηm. The simpliﬁcation can
be expressed as follows:
T =
M
X
m=1
∆BWηm(1−θm)Pr{Γj∗ ≥ βm|ˆβm ≤ ˆXj∗ < ˆβm+1}
Pr{ˆβm ≤ ˆXj∗ < ˆβm+1}Pr{j∗ = arg max
j
ˆXj}
(8)
where ∆BW is the operational bandwidth in Hz, Pr{j∗ =
arg maxj( ˆXj)} is the probability of terminal to experience
the highest estimated SNR and therefore being scheduled for
transmission by the BS, and Pr{Γj∗ ≥ βm|ˆβm ≤
ˆXj∗ <
ˆβm+1} is the probability of the instantaneous SINR Γj∗ to
surpass the threshold βm provided the estimated SNR ˆXj∗
(used for MCS selection and terminal scheduling) lies in the
range [ˆβm, ˆβm+1].
Note that this last conditional probability term captures
the effects of imperfect CSIT on the performance of the
beamforming, scheduling and adaptation scheme. In the case
of perfect CSIT (ρc → 0), correct reception occurs with proba-
bility one. Also, note that the link-layer throughput expression
in (8) represents only an approximation (compression) of the
real performance of the system. The simpliﬁed model in (8)
assumes packets are erroneous when the instantaneous SINR
drops below the reception threshold βm, when in practice there
might be some cases where correct reception can still occur.
Conversely, some cases with higher instantaneous SNR than
the reception threshold could also lead to erroneous packet
transmissions. This type of compression/abstraction model as
in (8) has been proved accurate for system-level simulation
of networks with considerable excursions of path-loss values,
which are typical of cellular systems where terminals lie at
different distances from the access point.
V.
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The following subsections present the derivation of analytic
expressions of the different terms of the link-layer throughput
model in (8). For convenience, it is useful to derive the
statistics of the estimated SNR (presented in Section V-A)
and then deal with the statistics of the instantaneous SINR
(presented in Section V-C) conditional on the MCS selection,
terminal scheduling, and beamforming processes.
A. Statistics of estimated SNR
Let us now substitute the correlation model described by
(3) in the expression of the estimated SNR in (2), which yields:
ˆXj =
PN
n=1 P|ˆhj(n)|2
σ2v

X
n=1
P|ν + √1 − ρZj(n) + √ρGj|2

(9)
The statistics of the estimated SNR have been investigated
in our previous work in [37]. The sub-index j is dropped
in subsequent derivations due to the symmetrical network
assumption. The conditional characteristic function (CF) of ˆX
can be thus written as [39]:
Ψ ˆ
X|G(iω) = (1 − iω˜γ)−Ne
iωα|˜ν+G|2
1−iω˜γ
,
(10)
where ˜γ =
P (1−ρ)γ
σ2v
, i = √−1, ω is the frequency domain
variable, ˜ν = ν/√ρ, α =
P Nρ
σ2v , and ΨX|Y denotes the CF
of random variable X conditional on an instance of random
variable Y , for any X and Y random variables. By using the
following change of variable x = |˜ν + G|2, the expression in
(10) becomes:
Ψ ˆ
X|x(iω) = (1 − iω˜γ)−Ne
iωαx
1−iω˜γ .
(11)
The unconditional CF of the estimated SNR can be now
obtained by averaging the previous expression over the proba-
bility density function (PDF) of x, which under the Rice fading
assumption is given by fx(x) = P∞
q=0 Cqxqe− x
γ , where
Cq =
κq
γq+1(q!)2 e−κ κ =

is the Rice factor. Therefore,
the unconditional CF of the estimated SNR can be obtained
as follows:

B. Order statistics of estimated SNR
The effects of terminal scheduling on the statistics of
the estimated SNR will be obtained via the theory of order
statistics. The statistics of the random variable with maximum
value are given by the following formula [38]:
f ˆ
Xmax(y) = Jf ˆ
X(y)F ˆ
X(y)J−1.

By substituting the expressions for the PDF and CDF of ˆX∗ in

C. Statistics of instantaneous SINR
Let us now substitute the correlation model described by
(4) into the expression of the instantaneous SINR in (5):
Γj = PρcˆhH
j ˆhj + Re[P PN
n=1 ˆhj(n)∗Φj(n)]
Ij + σ2v

(32)
where Φj(n) = ν(1 − ρc) +

1 − ρ2cYj(n). Since we are
interested in the reception probability term Pr{Γj > βm} we
can use (32) to express the term Pr{Γj > βm}as follows:
Pr{Γj > βm} =
Pr
(
PρcˆhH
j ˆhj + Re[P PN
n=1 ˆhj(n)∗Φj(n)]
Ij + σ2v
> βm
)
.
By rearranging the terms of the inequality we obtain:
Pr{Γj > βm} =
Pr{PρcˆhH
j ˆhj + Re[P

ˆhj(n)∗Φj(n)] − βmIj

v}.
The characteristic function of ψj conditionally on a particular
value of ˆhj is the addition of two random variables: a Gaussian
process with mean PρcXj + ν(1 − ρc) and variance P(1 −
ρc)Xj = ˇγXj and a non-central chi-square random variable
with K degrees of freedom, and parameters −βmλ and ξ. This
can be mathematically written as follows:

RESULTS
This section presents graphical results of the statistics of
the MRC beamformer with adaptive modulation, scheduling
and co-channel interference with imperfect CSIT. Figure 2
displays the results of the Cumulative Distribution Function
(CDF) of the SNR of the scheduler conditional on the decision
made by the transmitter based on imperfect CSIT using a
hypothetical MCS selection threshold equal to (ˆβ = 2). The
results in Figure 2 have been obtained using ﬁxed transmit
power settings (Pγ/σ2
v = 1) assuming no interference with
different numbers of antennas (N = 2, N = 4), Rice factor
κ = −10 dB, persistent factor p = 0.7, and different values
of correlation coefﬁcients (ρ = 0.2, ρ = 0.95, ρc = 0.2 and
ρc = 0.95).
Figure 3 shows the results for the CDF of the SNR using
the same settings as in the previous example, except for the
transmit power which is now set to Pγ/σ2
v = 5. The objective
of investigating the conditional CDF is to observe the effects
of imperfect CSIT on the instantaneous SNR experienced by
the scheduled terminals. The results show the heavy inﬂuence
of imperfect CSIT on the characteristics of the CDF. Low
values of the correlation coefﬁcient ρ → 0, see a considerable
degradation on the probability of correct reception. Note that
all curves of the CDF depart from the hypothetical decision
threshold set to ˆβ = 2. This departure to the left-hand side
of the ﬁgure is a measure of the incorrect reception due to
imperfect CSIT. All the curves at the top left of the ﬁgure are
indeed the curves with worse CSIT conditions. It is observed
that spatial correlation degrades performance at high values
of SNR, but it could be beneﬁcial in the low SNR regime.
In some cases, spatial diversity provided by higher numbers
of antennas can even compensate for the effects of imperfect
CSIT, particularly at with low values of spatial correlation. In
all cases in both ﬁgures, it is observed that the performance of
the CDF is superior with higher numbers of terminals in the
scheduler, but this gain is more noticeable in channels with low
spatial correlation. It can be also observed that user scheduling
reduces the effects of spatial correlation. Spatial correlation
reduces the diversity gains of the combining beamformer, and

it can be accumulated over the several antennas resulting in
a more noticeable performance reduction. User scheduling
provides extra diversity gains that can compensate this re-
duction. The results can also be compared to the Rayleigh
fading case presented in our previous conference publication
in [1]. All the curves seem to be more straight in the vertical
direction, which is an indication of the effect of line of
sight.This ”straightening” effect has consequences in different
aspects of the protocol. First of all, it helps to reduce the
likelihood of missing the SINR threshold for values near the
threshold. However, it can also contribute to having difﬁculties
in achieving such threshold, particularly with low values of the
temporal correlation coefﬁcient.
The results presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4 have been
obtained using the same settings used in the previous two
examples, except for the interference assumption. The channel
power settings of the K = 2 persistent interferers were all set
to λ/γ = 0.1. The results show the CDF of the instantaneous
SINR instead of the SNR. The CDF results show how affected
the system becomes by the presence of interference. It becomes
evident that the presence of interference affects also how
the spatial correlation plays a role on the performance of
the system. This will become more evident in the results of
throughput presented in the following ﬁgures.
To test the performance of the algorithm in a full wireless
transmission system with different modulation formats, we
have used the settings of the WiMAX standard and its different
modulation schemes (see Table II). The results in Figure 4 and
Figure 5 present the overall throughput for a network with
different numbers of users included in the scheduler versus
different values of transmit average SNR. Figure 4 shows the
results with no interference, while Figure 5 shows the results
with K = 2 interferers using set to λ/γ = 0.1. The results
with interference show several changing patterns due to the
complex relation between interference and the received signal
by the terminals. Surprisingly at high values of transmit SNR
some of the curves with low spatial correlation tend to perform
worse that the correlated cases, which can only be explained
by the increased importance of the interference term and the
parameters of the modulation formats used in the simulation.

CONCLUSIONS
This paper has presented an analytical framework for the
study of joint MRC beamforming, terminal scheduling and
resource allocation (modulation assignment) algorithms for
multiuser networks in the presence of persistent co-channel
interference. The results show that co-channel interference can

considerably affect the performance of beamforming, being
counteracted by the effects of scheduling and higher degree
of accuracy of channel state information at the transmitter
side. The number of antennas tends to reduce the effects of
imperfect CSIT and interference. However, channel correlation
can affect these gains, particularly in the high SNR regime.
Conversely, in the low SNR regime it seems that channel
correlation can outperform the case on uncorrelated channels.
Spatial correlation effects tend to be accumulated when the
number of antennas increases and, therefore, its effects will
be more clearly observed in the high SNR regime. The line-
of-sight component analyzed in this paper tends to improve
reception for high values of temporal correlation, but it seems
