Abstract— Modern vehicles include a large number of Electronic
Control Units interconnected by different bus systems. Attacks on
these critical infrastructure elements have increased signiﬁcantly
over the last years, particularly since remote exploitation is
possible due to increased wireless connectivity from the cars to the
outside world. Many of these attacks exploit available standard
communication protocols and diagnostic services implemented in
cars that are often mandatory. Such services allow, for example,
the activation of headlights or the turning of the steering wheel via
the parking assist functionality. These services must be sufﬁciently
secure, such that they can only be triggered when it is safe to
do so, e. g., when the car is parked or driving at low speed.
The validation mechanisms to determine a safe state are mainly
plausibility checks, which currently often only utilize the vehicle
speed, reported via the Controller Area Network bus, as an input
parameter. In this paper, we motivate the need to base plausibility
checks on other input values, which may be more authentic and
reliable. Speciﬁcally, we propose the use of immanent signals for
plausibility checks, i. e., signals derived from hard-wired sensors,
which are harder to manipulate. In this paper, we propose some
speciﬁc implementations of plausibility checks with immanent
signals and argue how they would protect from current attacks
on cars found in literature, we also discuss how the same idea may
be applied to other areas, such as Industrial Control Systems.

INTRODUCTION
Modern cars can be regarded as highly complex cyber
physical systems. These systems are composed of up to 100
microprocessors (called Electronic Control Units (ECUs)) with
up to 100 million lines of code [2]–[4]. Failures of such
systems can have catastrophic consequences and come in two
ﬂavors, safety failures can be induced by a systematic or
random malfunction, while security failures are induced by a
malicious entitiy. These failures make the automotive systems
prone to attacks. Since the introduction of bus systems to cars
they were vulnerable to attacks, but these required a physical
connection (e. g., car theft). With the recent introduction of
ever more wireless interfaces, these attacks and many more
can now be performed by remote hackers [5]. Remote attacks
alone typically have little to no direct effects on the safety of
cars, as they target communication units. Only combined with
ﬂaws in the internal networks can safety risks arise. Joe Weiss
and the NIST share this viewpoint in that for Industrial Control
Systems (ICSs) and critical infrastructures at large the principle
of CIA should be replaced by AIC, thus making attacks on the
availability of a system the most critical attacks, followed by
attacks on its integrity and lastly its conﬁdentiality [6]. Miller
and Valasek come to the conclusion that multi stage attacks
are now a realistic problem in the automotive world and argue
that their work “shows that simply protecting vehicles from
remote attacks isn’t the only layer of defense that automakers
need” [7]. A defense in depth security approach is required.
One signiﬁcant part of such an approach are plausibility
checks, which we proposed in an earlier paper [1] and that we
want to amend in this publication. In earlier publications [5],
[7]–[10], most critical attacks able to compromise the safety
of a car were limited to low speeds. These limitations stem
from existing plausibility checks in ECUs that try to prevent
the execution of the requested service in an unsafe state, like
at higher speeds. However, these plausibility checks only rely
on the speed of the vehicle as reported to ECUs via internal
networks which can, again, be attacked. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach for enhanced validity checks that
does not suffer from attackers that have inﬁltrated internal
networks.
In the following, we will ﬁrst give an introduction to
plausibility checks and outline the requirements for the used
signals, followed in Section II-B by an extensive overview
of vulnerabilities found in cars till today. Section III then
describes our approach for advanced plausibility checks and
the assessment process to determine suitable functions to
safeguard. Next, Section IV discusses the security of our
approach and its applicability to cars and other domains like
ICSs, and ﬁnally, Section V concludes this paper with an
outlook.
II.
STATE OF THE ART
A. Plausibility Checks
As researchers noticed in their attempts to compromise
cars, most of the time the last barrier to safety critical functions
is a plausibility check. These are simple checks that verify
whether all prerequisites to safely execute a function are met.
All checks discovered so far use the speed of the car as
a signal to check against [7], [11]. All but one ECU (the
Antilock Brake System (ABS) / Electronic Stability Control
(ESC)-ECU) obtain this information from an internal bus

system. The check only determines if the speed is below
a predetermined threshold. This threshold is usually 5 mph
or 8 kph depending on whether the country uses imperial
or metrical units, respectively. Above these thresholds, ECUs
change their internal state to one with very limited triggerable
functions. The problem with this mechanism is not the general
approach, but rather that it relies only on the speed of the car,
which is received by spoofable bus messages that can be sent
by any host with access to the network segment in most current
automobiles. If no network separation is present, the signal can
basically be sent by any node in the network, even by ones
plugged in externally.
In order to provide the necessary protection, the signals
used for plausibility checks have to be authentic and integrity
protected. The modern approach [12] applies cryptographic
protection, e. g., with Keyed-Hash Message Authentication
Codes (HMACs), to achieve these goals. However, this type
of message protection is hardly found in current production
vehicles. The maximum security offered is the use of alive
counters and simple checksums.
B. Attacks on Automobiles
In order to efﬁciently implement security measures, it is
necessary to understand the problem in detail. For this reason,
we conducted an extensive literature research that resulted in
22 published sources describing attacks on automobiles [5],
[7]–[9], [11], [13]–[29]. In these 22 sources, a total of 87
attacks were found and classiﬁed according to CVSS v. 3 [30].
In the following, we present our results from an analysis and
categorization of these attacks. The detailed analysis can be
found in [31].
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is
widely accepted as the standard taxonomy to rate software
vulnerabilities and is used, e.g., in the Common Vulnerabili-
ties and Exposures (CVE) database. We classiﬁed all attacks
according to the CVSS v. 3, limiting classiﬁcation to the Base
Metrics. These metrics reﬂect the vulnerabilities of the tested
systems. The CVSS offers ﬁve severity ratings represented in
Table I with their associated CVSS scores. Additional metrics
are Temporal Metrics and Environmental Metrics. A Temporal
Metric is used to classify the maturity of the available exploits,
ranging from no available proof of concept to publicly avail-
able scripts ready to be used. Environmental Metrics are used
to measure the impact to a shareholder if a vulnerable item is
failing / compromised.
Figure 1 depicts the severity ratings of all examined attacks.
Probably most noticeable is the fact that only one attack has a
low severity. This is the attack on the WiFi pre-shared key
(PSK) in a Mitsubishi [20]. This attack only compromises
the conﬁdentiality of the system. 28% of all attacks have a
medium, 40% a high and 31% a critical severity rating.

Figure 2 gives an overview of the combinations of affected
protection goals. The bar on the left shows all attacks that
compromise a single protection goal, either conﬁdentiality,
integrity or availability (combined 26.4%). The middle bar
represents the attacks that compromise a combination of two
safety goals (combined 49.5%), while the right side bar
represents the percentage of vulnerabilities that compromise
all three protection goals (24.1%). 28% of the found vulner-
abilities have a severity rating of medium, and all combina-
tions of compromised protection goals can be found in this
class. A high severity rating is determined for 40% of the
found vulnerabilities. In this severity class, no attacks on the
integrity of the system or the combination of conﬁdentiality
and integrity are included. 31% of all found vulnerabilities
are critical, the highest severity class according to CVSS v. 3.
In this class, the vulnerabilities are a combination that affect
either all three protection goals (8% of all vulnerabilities)
or the combination of integrity and availability (23% of all
vulnerabilities). Another interesting fact is that no attack that
required user interaction resulted in a critical vulnerability.
Finally, we want to investigate the attack vectors used in
these attacks. The CVSS offers a distinction between four
attack vectors: network, adjacent, local and physical. If a
vulnerability is exploitable by network it is often referred to as
remotely exploitable, the vulnerable component thus needs a
network access and the attacker attacks through OSI layer 3. A
component exploitable over an adjacent network has a network
connection, but the connection only has a short range, e. g.,
WiFi or Bluetooth. Is a vulnerability exploitable only by local
access, then the attack uses local read/write/execute commands
or utilizes the user. If the vulnerability is exploitable through
a physical connection, then this connection can be only brief,
e. g., evil maid attack, or it can be a persistent connection [30].
Figure 3 shows the distribution of attack vectors for attacks
on automobiles. Most vulnerabilities can be exploited by an
adjacent network, for example by having access to the local
Controller Area Network (CAN) network. If a malicious host
is part of the local network, other hosts can be exploited.
Another example is the attack on the Bluetooth implementation
described in [9]. Network exploitable vulnerabilities make
up 5.7 % of all possible attack vectors, an example is the
exploitation of the 3G network stack described in [9] or the
remote unlocking and start of cars described in [27]. Local ex-
ploitable vulnerabilities account for 15 % of all vulnerabilities.

Examples for locally exploitable vulnerabilities are, e. g., the
attacks on keyless access systems described in [17], [21], [29].
Physical access was only necessary in 5.7% of all attacks,
examples for such attacks are, e. g., the attack on the acceler-
ator message in a Toyota or the dumps of the ROM of Ford
ECUs in [8].
In conclusion, many of the attacks found during our litera-
ture survey rely on spooﬁng of messages and manipulating
safety critical state (64.4%). Some attacks could only be
conducted at low speeds due to simple plausibility checks
being in place. However, [7] has already highlighted that such
simple plausibility checks could be rendered ineffective and
can be bypassed by spooﬁng messages that simulate a safe
state, e.g., low speed. We thus conclude that more advanced
and more secure plausibility checks would be required to
provide better protection from such attacks. In the next section
we want to present such plausibility checks.
III.
ADVANCED PLAUSIBILITY CHECKS
As stated before, advanced plausibility checks can be
applied as part of a defense in depth concept to prevent
attacks on safety critical functions. The main idea is that
plausibility checks need to be based on more tamper-resistant
input, because CAN messages are too easy to manipulate.
In the absence of strong cryptographic protection of CAN
networks in most cars, we can still resort to directly attached
sensors, even if these only provide indirect evidence of the
vehicles state. If, e. g., an ECU controls the steering aid
and automatic steering, steering angle and forces allow it to
determine whether the vehicle is driving at high speed or not,
without relying on potentially spoofed remote information.
In order to allow a systematic development of such ad-
vanced plausibility checks, we have designed a systematic
methodology that is shown in Figure 4 and allows to determine
if our proposed approach is applicable for certain applications.
Figure 4. Methodology for applying plausibility checks
Before this assessment, a hazard and risk analysis has
to be conducted. This analysis is part of every automotive
development lifecycle and demanded by the functional safety
standard ISO 26262 [32]. The objective of this analysis is the
identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of the hazards of an item (“a
system that implements a function at a vehicle level” [32]).
Such an item could, e. g., be the airbag. In addition, safety
goals related to the prevention and mitigation of the found
hazards have to be drafted. For each hazard, an Automotive
Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) has to be calculated. The inputs
for this calculation are the expected loss in case of an acci-
dent (severity) and the probability of the accident occurring
128

(exposure and controllability). For this contemplation only the
severity as the consequences of a malfunction are considered.
With levels from S 0 to S 3, functions with a severity equal or
above S 1 (light to moderate injuries) are deemed meaningful.
These considerations are embodied by the ﬁrst decision in the
design structure chart pictured in Figure 4. The next necessary
decision is to determine whether the function in question
depends on the state of the vehicle.
In addition to a Hazard and Risk Analysis for the iden-
tiﬁcation of safety risks, the overall evaluation of security
risks is performed in a Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment
(TARA) at the beginning of an automotive project [33]. Several
approaches can be taken into account in order to conduct
existing vulnerabilities and attacker models, e. g., starting from
the entry points of possible attacks into a system. Figure 5
shows a high-level description of possible entry points for an
individual ECU.
Figure 5. Possible entry Points to an ECU
The implementation of a simple plausibility check with
speed evaluation is attractive to attacks, which are launched
by the use of a counterfeit speed value on the on-board
bus system, combined with an issuing of an (authenticated)
diagnostics service request from an off-board tester unit or a
wireless connection endpoint in case of diagnostics-over-the-
air service possibilities. Hard-wired sensor values of an ECU
are by nature resistant to protocol attacks. Thus, their use in an
overall ECU security concept can be seen as complementary
approach in order to derive a reliable decision on a safe state.
When the requirements as described above and pictured
in Figure 4 are met, advanced plausibility checks should and
can be used to safeguard functions. As mentioned before,
inputs to these plausibility checks have to be authentic and
their integrity should be guaranteed. These protection goals
can be met by applying cryptographic functions, e. g., using
HMAC [12]. This type of cryptographic measure ensures the
desired protection goals with an acceptable demand for com-
putational performance. Nevertheless, there also exist a few
drawbacks using HMACs. In particular, the key management
and reduced bandwidth on the bus by attaching an HMAC to
each message are problematic, unless the network was planned
with security in mind. If security was not a priority, or even
considered during development, the necessary computational
power and secure storage could be absent. This absence of
relevant hardware could make a complete overhaul of the
network necessary to improve security. Another point against
cryptographic measures is that it is still possible to circumvent
these functions by attacking other components, which is not
possible when using hard-wired sensors for plausibility checks.
In the next paragraphs we want to present a possible solution
with a practical example based on the attacks by Miller and
Valasek [7].
Figure 6. Sub-architecture of a Jeep Cherokee 2014 [5]
Figure 6 represents a part of a Jeep Cherokee 2014 network
architecture, which was the target of the latest attacks of Miller
and Valasek on a car [5], [7]. The ﬁgure shows different ECUs
and gateways that are interconnected by bus systems. Further-
more, some hard-wired sensors are present, delivering relevant
information about the state of the vehicle. This information
can be used to derive ECU immanent signals for plausibility
checks without the need for cryptographic protection.
ECU immanent signals should be used for plausibility
checks whenever possible. These signals can be signals pro-
duced in the ECU, like the regulated torque in the engine
ECU that is calculated by adding up all the torque demands
of the engine auxiliaries and the driver requirement. The other
possibility for such signals are hard-wired sensor signals, such
as the rotational speed sensors for the ABS / ESC ECU. With
the help of Figure 7 we want to show how an immanent signal
of an ECU can be used to make a plausibility check for a
requested function. This example is based on the latest hacks
of Miller and Valasek. On their Jeep Cherokee [7] they spoofed
the speed signal of the ABS-ECU that normally would have
been used by the Steering Control Module (SCM) to make
a plausibility check. In this case, the plausibility check would
verify whether the car is in reverse and slower than 5 mph. The
check for the driving direction is not easily possible, but we can
check for the speed constraint. We can assume a known level
of hydraulic pressure in the steering system, because we have
a hard-wired sensor for this signal to the SCM. This module
also evaluates the signal of the torque sensor. With the help
of the information in Figure 7 it is possible to determine the
speed of a car within small limits.

Figure 7. Plot of steering moment dependent on hydraulic pressure and
vehicular speed [34]
As an example, we will show how to determine the
threshold for the steering torque up to which a safe execution
of safety critical functions is permissible. For easier visual
evaluation we suppose a threshold of 20 kph for the safe state
of the Jeep and an assumption of 20 bar for the hydraulic
pressure brings us to the conclusion that a steering moment of
more than 2.9 Nm is equivalent to a speed above the deﬁned
threshold and thus the execution of the requested function has
to be refused.
A plausibility check like described here would have easily
prevented the attack on the steering system as described in [7].
Our analysis indicates that such immanent signals can be found
and utilized in almost any safety critical ECU in a car. We
argue that signals from other ECUs should only be used, if
local sensor signals are not available and if remote information
is cryptographically protected. As mentioned before, input to
plausibility checks has to fulﬁll some preconditions, namely
being integrous and authentic. Only if these prerequisites are
fulﬁlled, such bus messages can be used for plausibility checks
of functions with a severity value of S 1 or above.
To conclude this section we want to present some limits
for this method and ways to prevent them. The other attacks
on the Jeep Cherokee [7] are more problematic, as they use
legitimate messages to request certain functions. The slamming
on the car’s brakes is a standard function that is executed
when the driver presses the switch for the electronic parking
brake. While pressing the switch the pump for the ABS / ESC
system is activated and provides the pressure to engage the
brakes of the car. Such a brake maneuver is comparable with
emergency braking. As Miller and Valasek were able to request
and execute this function, it is reasonable to assume that the
switch for the electronic parking brake is directly connected
to the bus system of the car. The same can be concluded
for their last attack, the unintended acceleration of the car.
They used the standard function to enable the Apdative Cruise
Control (ACC) and then increase the target speed of the cruise
control. This is possible by replaying messages of the switches
embedded in the steering wheel. We were able to observe the
same situation in an electric vehicle produced by a German
manufacturer. Therefore, safety critical functions with an ASIL
of D should not be able to be activated by bus messages. For
all requests of such functions direct connections should be
used (peer-to-peer); although these connections can be network
connections, like CAN or Ethernet, they should not be routed
over gateways.
IV.
DISCUSSION
A. Automotive Systems
To demonstrate the broad applicability of our proposed
method, we now discuss other examples of instances where
plausibility checks with immanent signals can be used. First,
we further evaluate the examples in Section III. After these
examples, other published attacks on safety critical functions
(lighting, engine, gearbox, brakes and suspensions [5], [8],
[10], [16]) and the possibility to apply plausibility checks with
ECU immanent signals are evaluated. Finally, we provide a
discussion of how a our approach can also be applied to other
ﬁelds, like ICSs.
We start with the engine example. There are multiple
attacks published on the engine of a car [8]–[10], [16]. Most
attacks completely disable the engine and shut it down. To
achieve this result, standard services were used to reset the
ECU, deactivate fuel injectors or initiate a ﬂash session. Every
such service should use a plausibility check as the safety of
its execution is widely dependent on the vehicles state. There
are multiple immanent sensor values or processed signals that
could be used for these plausibility checks. An extensive
overview is presented in Figure 8. The easiest signal to use
is the rpm-signal of the engine. If this signal is non-zero, no
service that compromises the operation of the engine should be
able to execute. Services that help mechanics with diagnostics
of the engine in a workshop, like reading out live data, may
still be allowed. Besides the aforementioned rpm-signal, there
are a lot of other sensor signals, which could be used, like
the readout of the air mass sensor, exhaust temperature sensor,
fuel pressure sensor and more. A processed signal that could
be used is the calculated torque of the engine. This torque
is calculated by adding the demands of all auxiliaries of the
engine, like the AC compressor, the alternator or the hydraulic
steering pump, as well as the driver demand. If this signal is
unequal zero, it can be concluded that the car is in use and
any execution of services that compromises the operation of
the engine should be considered unsafe.
The second and probably most critical point of attack is
the braking system, which was also the target of multiple
attacks [5], [7], [8], [16]. The executed attacks include wheel
selective braking as well as disabling the braking system
all together. Here, it is also possible to use ECU immanent
signals. All wheel speed sensors are hard-wired to the ECU.
Modern wheel speed sensors can determine speeds as low as
0.1 kph [36]. As soon as a non-zero speed is detected, all
safety critical services should stop their execution. However,
the speed signal is not the only one that can be used, as
an alternative the hard-wired three-axis acceleration sensor
can be evaluated. As soon as these sensors signals show any
acceleration, the car is not in a safe state to execute safety
critical functions.

Our research also identiﬁed vulnerabilities in active sus-
pension systems. The ECUs controlling such systems also use
a vast amount of sensors and signals to control the ride of a
vehicle. Two possible immanent signals of such a system are
acceleration sensors or sensors for the level of each wheel.
If the signals of the level sensors of the car change or an
acceleration unequal to zero is detected it can be concluded that
the car is in motion and thus safety critical functions should
not be able to perform their task of, e. g., resetting the ECU.
A way to utilize advanced plausibility checking to ensure
the safe state of the car with immanent signals of the steering
system was presented in Section III. This shows that these
systems could be safeguarded in their current implementation
with our method. In conclusion, the presented examples show
that this method allows to safeguard every ECU responsible
for lateral or longitudinal behavior of a vehicle.
This method is not limited to safeguarding the movement
of the car: other safety critical aspects can be secured, like the
state of the lights, this is an instance where an odd sensor signal
could be used [8], [10]. Attacks on the lights of a car spoofed
messages of the light sensor or used diagnostic messages to
deactivate the headlights of a car. The sensor signal of the
light sensor is evaluated in the vehicle supply system control
device. This device also powers the electric fuel pump, see,
e. g., the schematic in [37]. This pump is only active when
the engine is running and during a short time after unlocking
the car or switching on the ignition. The signal is thus also
a good indicator if it is safe to execute the inquired function.
As the sensor is in the mentioned schematic hard-wired to the
executing ECU it can determine if the message was spoofed
or issued by the correct sender.
B. Advanced Plausibility Checks in other Domains
We claim that a similar approach for plausibility checking
can be applied to many cyber-physical systems. The security
problem in such systems is often the same. Control systems
rely on insecure input to trigger actions that may be put
the system in danger if executed in some situations. Often,
plausibility checks are applied to prevent the system from
entering unsafe states, but if attackers manage to manipulate
the input to the plausibility check, there is no security gain.
So, our approach on rating the trustworthiness of all input
to plausibility checks and then relying only on authentic and
integrity-protected input should also be applied in such sys-
tems. Examples include ICSs or Building Automation Systems
(BASs).
A simple example in a BAS may be a local controller that
manages the blinds of a room depending on the instructions
of a central control system. Depending on weather conditions
like sun or wind, the blinds may be moved up or down.
Communication can use protocols like BACnet or KNX that
often provide no security features.
An attacker may now inject control messages to move
blinds down during strong wind, resulting in damage to the
building. While the local control may also receive wind speed
via the network and thus apply plausibility checks to ignore
the central controller’s command in case it is unsafe to lower
the blinds due to strong wind, an attacker may of course also
inject false wind sensor information into the network.
Our approach would now search for local sensors data that
may be used for advanced plausibility checks. For example,
one may add a force-sensor to the blinds, to determine whether
there is a strong wind drag and then decide to move the blinds
in a safe state, i. e., up.
While researchers have studied intrusion detection and
prevention for ICSs [38] and BASs [39], advanced plausibility
checking and the consideration of reliability of input is not
well studied so far, and should be considered as a ﬁeld for
future research.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have discussed the need for advanced
plausibility checks to secure automotive systems from ad-
vanced attacks that have been recently demonstrated. While
basic checks are already implemented in existing vehicles,
they rely on bus messages of the vehicle speed, which may
be forged, e. g., by the use of jamming or spooﬁng techniques.
As these validations are one crucial part of a defense in depth
approach, a more secure implementation is crucial.
With the use of immanent signals derived from hard-wired
sensors a more secure way for plausibility checks can be
found. We have discussed how this approach can be used in
various functions of modern cars without any need to change
the ECU or communication architecture; all changes depend
on improved software realizations of the plausibility check
and rely only on already available sensor input. We have
shown that many of the recently published attacks could have
been prevented by the presented approach. As discussed with

building automation, similar approaches can be found in many
other cyber-physical-systems.
For future work, we see a big potential in integrating
remote and local input for plausibility checks. One should
provide a trust rating for input to plausibility checks and
determine plausibility of a system state based on these trust
ratings. Furthermore, prospective future networks [40] are
planned based on virtual servers, with this approach the hard
wired sensor signals are not as easy to use as shown in this
paper and has to be adapted.
