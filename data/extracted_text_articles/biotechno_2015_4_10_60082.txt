Abstract—Bacillus subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens and other 
related strains isolated from rhizosphere are widely used in 
biotechnology as Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria 
(PGPR) showing variable activity in different soils and on 
different plants.  Despite diverse bioactivity, they are almost 
indistinguishable by phenotype and by 16S rRNA that makes it 
problematic to trace them down in nature. Spores of these 
microorganisms are abundant in many habitats, but it remains 
unclear whether these organisms thrive in these habitats or 
simply contaminated the samples? In this work, several new 
computational 
approaches 
were 
proposed 
for 
design, 
evaluation and application of multilocus genetic barcodes for 
identification and monitoring of biotechnological strains. The 
barcodes containing 150 marker genes were designed for 35 
strains of the B. subtilis group and tested on publically 
available metagenomic datasets. Clear habitat preferences 
were observed for different subspecies and even individual 
strains. Also, an approach of evaluation and improving of 
sensibility and sensitivity of barcodes was proposed.   
Keywords-genetic barcoding; plant growth promoting; 
Bacillus; metagenomics. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Bacillus subtilis was one of the first known bacterial 
species described in 1835 by Ehrenberg as Vibrio subtilis 
and then renamed to Bacillus subtilis in 1872 by Cohn [1]. 
This spore-forming bacterium caught eye because of its 
abundance and ease of isolation. From then on B. subtilis has 
become one of the most popular model organism used in 
bacteriological and genetic laboratories. At dawn of the 
genomic era it became obvious that B. subtilis in fact is a 
conglomerate of several closely related taxa vernacularly 
termed the B. subtilis / B. amyloliquefaciens group. Many of 
these organisms found a wide application in biotechnology 
as biopesticides and plant growth promoters [2], lytic 
enzyme producers [3] and in decontamination tests [4]. 
Activities of a biotechnological interest often are associated 
with genetically isolated groups of these organisms [5]. For 
example, many commercial plant growth promoters belong 
to B. amyloliquefaciens ssp. plantarum [2]; however, several 
strains of B. subtilis and B. atrophaeus also were introduced 
as successful biopesticides [6].  
Surprisingly, despite this long history of study of this 
group of microorganisms, ecology and preferable habitats of 
species and subspecies of this group remain unclear. This is a 
back side of the abundance of these microorganisms. Their 
spores may tolerate even several minutes of boiling and they 
easily can be spread by water and wind to any environment. 
This is why these organisms are the most frequent 
contaminants in microbiological laboratories and an isolation 
of B. subtilis related organisms from any eco-niche cannot a 
proof of preferable inhabiting this biotope. Our ignorance of 
habitat preferences of these biotechnologically important 
microorganisms limits their application and may be an 
explanation why Bacillus based plant growth promoters and 
biopesticides sometimes show an unstable efficacy in field 
conditions and on different plants [8]. Strains for new 
biopesticides often are selected based on their antagonistic 
activity against pathogens, but it was shown that the bacteria 
with extraordinary antagonistic activities not always were 
able to survive in rhizosphere and to colonize plants [10].  
Next generation sequencing and metagenomics allowed 
studying complex microbial populations without isolation of 
individual strains. The most common approach is 
amplification of fragments of 16S rRNA from the whole 
DNA sample using the universal primers followed by 
massive parallel sequencing of the amplified fragments. 
Application of this approach is limited in our case as these 
bacteria are almost indistinguishable by 16S rRNA [5]. 
Another metagenomic approach consists in sequencing of 
randomly generated genomic fragments. As there are plenty 
of bacterial species in complex habitats, any single marker 
gene for a species of interest may be absent in the generated 
metagenomic set of reads. To avoid overlooking of species 
of interest, the genetic barcode sequence should contain 
multiple marker genes. The aim of this study was to develop 
computational approaches for a standardized selecting of 
marker genes and evaluation of the barcode efficacy. An 
approach of identification of suitable marker genes by whole 
genome comparison was proposed in our previous 
publication [11]. Here, the prepared barcodes were used for 
identification of closely related Bacillus species in publically 
available metagenomic datasets. Then, an in-house Python 
script was used for evaluation of performance of different 
loci in the barcode sequences for further improvement of the 
barcodes. In Section III.A, the results of identification of 
barcoded strains of Bacillus in plant and rhizosphere 
associated habitats were presented that followed by the 
analysis of several gut microbiomes (Section III.B) and

estuarine habitats (Section III.C). The approaches of 
improving of multi-locus barcode sequences to achieve a 
higher sensitivity and specificity were discussed in the 
Section III.D. The paper ends up with conclusive remarks.

Barcodes were designed as it was explained in our 
previous publication [11]. Shortly: complete genome 
comparison revealed a set of 150 rather conserved core 
genes, which have accumulated amino acid substitution with 
a relatively higher rate than other genes. It implied an 
evolutionary positive selection of amino acid substitutions 
leading to adaptation of organisms to specific habitat 
conditions. 
Metagenome datasets representing different eco-niches 
were obtained from NCBI and MG-RAST databases [12]

where b_score – blastn score of a read; r_length – length of 
the read; G – number of barcodes in the set, in our case – 34; 
Ng – number of barcodes with which the read gives reliable 
blast hits. The logic of this score is that the reads aligned 
through its whole length contribute more to the score than 
those aligned partially; and the reads with specific hits 
against one single barcode sequence contribute more than 
those with multiple hits against many barcodes. An 
assumption was that the strain specific barcodes with higher 
scores would indicate presence of similar organisms in the 
habitat specific metagenome. 
Local blast search and statistics were implemented in 
Python 2.5 scripts. 
C. Phylogenomic tree inferring. 
Phylogenomic tree was inferred by the maximum 
likelihood algorithm based on a super-alignment of amino 
acid sequences of 2,318 identified core genes common for all 
tested Bacillus genomes. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Analysis of the rhizosphere and phyllosphere associated 
barcodes 
Results of the blast search of reads of 5 metagenomic 
datasets associated with rhizosphere, soil and plants are 
shown in Figure 1. 
In Figure 1 and in the following figures of mapping of 
the metagenomic reads, the barcodes are numbered in the 
same order as in Table 1. 
The profiles of strains were quite similar in the 
rhizosphere associated biotopes with a general predominance 
of B. amyloliquefaciens over B. subtilis and other species 
except for the strain B. subtilis ssp. spizizenii At3. The latter 
one was frequent in all metagenomic datasets and in two of 
them it was the most abundant strain. The bacillary 
microflora of rice phyllosphere was quite similar to those of 
rhizosphere samples, but an interesting observation was that 
B. amyloliquefaciens ssp. amyloliquefaciens were more 
frequent in the phyllosphere sample, while their closest 
relatives of the subspecies plantarum were more common in 
the rhizosphere samples.  
 Bacillus species profile in the oak forest rhizosphere was 
quite different with B. subtilis ssp. subtilis and B. mojavensis 
to be the dominant organisms. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Scores calculated for the barcodes by BLASTN mapping of 
DNA reads are shown in histograms. Phylogenomic tree of tested strains is 
shown below. 
B. amyloliquefaciens ssp. plantarum are widely used in 
many commercial biopesticides and as plant growth 
promoting agents. The observation of distribution of Bacillus 
species shown in Figure 1 suggests that strains of 
B. amyloliquefaciens ssp. amyloliquefaciens may be a better 
choice for applying biocontrol agents on leaves; and 
B. subtilis based biopesticides may be more effective in 
forestry. 
 
B. Analysis of metagenomes of gut microflora 
It was interesting to investigate whether the microflora of 
herbivorous organisms would resemble that one of plants 
and would there be differences in microbiota of herbivorous 
and carnivorous organisms. In this study, the metagenomes 
of gut microflora of cow, human, dog and termite were 
analysed (Figure 2). 
In termite gut, B. amyloliquefaciens and B. atrophaeus 
were absolutely dominants. These species were abundant 
also in guts of cow, but B. subtilis ssp. spizizenii was also 
frequent in this microbiota, especially the linage At3 that was 
although frequent in the rhizosphere (Figure 1). Bacillus 
species were more or less equally distributed in human 
intestines with minority in B. subtilis ssp. spizizenii and 
B. mojavensis. Contrary, in canine guts B. mojavensis and 
organisms similar to B. subtilis ssp. spizizenii W23 were the 
only present Bacillus.

Figure 2.  Bacillus species profiles in metagenomes of cow, human, canine 
and termite gut microflora. 
Strains of the B. subtilis group are used in several 
medicinal probiotics to prevent gastro-intestinal diseases and 
dysbacteriosis; however, it has been never reported was there 
any difference between the strains used for plant protection 
and those used in probiotics, as they all belonged to the same 
species [13]. The hypothesis was that although species of 
Bacillus did not belong to human and animals’ resident 
microflora, they constantly had been arriving with the food 
and might interfere with pathogenic bacteria and the immune 
system of the higher organism. This research confirmed that 
Bacillus are common in the gut microflora of herbivorous 
and omnivorous organisms including the human gut 
microflora. However, a significant difference in species 
profiles was observed suggesting that human probiotics may 
not necessary be effective for domestic and farm animals. 
 
C. Analysis of other metagenomes 
To check how specific the profiles of species of the 
B. subtilis group are in the habitats observed above, several 
other metagenomic datasets were analysed. In Figure 3, the 
results of analysis of metagenomes of natural and 
anthropogenic estuarine mud are shown. 
In the natural estuarine mud the species of B. subtilis / 
B. amyloliquefaciens were poorer represented than it was in 
the rhizosphere associated habitats. There were more 
representatives of Bacillus in the estuarine affected by 
industrial pollution with B. atrophaeus became the most 
abundant species comparing to other species of this group. 
Several more metagenomic datasets not mentioned in 
Table 2 were tried in this study: cliff soil, acid mine 
drainage, rock biofilm, activated sludge and hydrothermal 
vent. There were no hits against Bacillus specific barcodes 
indicating that these habitats were not occupied by 
representatives of the B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens 
lineages.

D. Further improvement of barcode specificity 
In addition to getting information regarding distribution 
of B. subtilis related species in different habitats, the 
conducted study aided in identification of loci in the barcode 
sequences, which contributed to species distinguishing and 
those which created noise of were silent. A developed 
Python script returned a graphical representation of efficacy 
of different barcode loci as shown in Figure 4. In this figure 
red to brown areas were the most effective in separating even 
closely related strains. Green areas were species and 
subspecies specific. Blue areas were not specific and created 
informative noise, and the white areas never have been hit by 
any read in this study. 
Figure 4.  Per locus analysis of discriminative power of several selected 
barcode sequences.  
The barcodes may be improved by removal non-specific 
loci (in Figure 4 shown in blue) and replacing them with 
other marker sequences. Than the blastn mapping may be 
repeated to check whether the specificity of barcodes had 
been improved.   
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The secret of success of a biotechnological culture is not 
in its species name but in the strain-specific biological 
activities. Recent advance in sequencing technologies made 
it affordable to sequence and compare whole genomes of 
closely related organism in infancy of clonal segregation and 
speciation. The most popular next generation sequencing 
techniques are Roche 454, Illumina and Ion Torrent. They

produce short DNA reads of several hundred nucleotides 
depending on the used technology, which are randomly 
generate from genome sequences in a sample. There is an 
urgent need in new computational techniques for mining of 
huge amounts of sequence data generated by the next 
generation sequencers to identify and highlight marker 
sequences suitable for barcoding of strains of interests and 
their biological activities. Multilocus barcoding seems to be 
a promising approach for a reliable identification of strains 
of closely related bacteria in environmental samples. Prior to 
this study the genomes of 34 organisms of the B. subtilis / 
B. amyloliquefaciens group were compared and 150 core 
genes with traces of positive selection were chosen for 
genetic barcode design [11]. The aim of the current research 
was to evaluate the prepared barcodes on publically available 
metagenomic datasets and to develop an approach of 
estimation of efficacy of barcode sequences per individual 
loci for further improvement of the selectivity and specificity 
of the method.  
Finding of this research was that the species and 
subspecies of the B. subtilis / B. amyloliquefaciens group, 
and even several individual strains of this group, have had 
preferences in distribution among different biotopes. 
Rhizosphere 
biotopes 
were 
populated 
mostly 
with 
B. amyloliquefaciens 
ssp. 
plantarum 
(Figure 1). 
Representatives of this taxonomic unit are promising 
biotechnological strains used as components of plant growth 
promoting preparations and biopesticides. Interestingly, that 
the strains of B. amyloliquefaciens ssp. amyloliquefaciens, 
which are characterized by a stronger enzymatic activity, 
were more dominant in rice phyllosphere and in the gut 
microbiota of termites (Figure 2), where they might 
contribute to enzymatic digestion of complex hydrocarbons 
[14]. Unexpectedly, the microflora of the oak forest 
rhizosphere was quite different from that of the grassland 
and tropical soils with dominance of B. subtilis ssp. subtilis 
strains in the former one. This observation may explain why 
several biotechnological formulations for plant growth 
promoting and protection not always were equally efficient 
in laboratory applications and in different field conditions.  
One serious problem with multilocus barcode application 
is that the barcodes comprising different sets of marker 
sequences may return incomparable results. A Python script 
was introduced in this work that may be used for evaluation 
of efficacy of different barcodes and even individual loci in 
their 
sequences. 
This 
algorithm 
allows 
a 
critical 
consideration of results of barcode based identification and 
makes it possible to determine the loci causing noise or false 
signals. Sensitivity and specificity of barcodes may be 
improved by removal of these fragments. An ultimate goal of 
further research on this project will consist in development 
of a standardized computer based system for a recurrent 
design, evaluation and improving of barcode sequences for 
identification and monitoring of biotechnological and 
pathogenic microorganisms in nature on the level of 
subspecies or individual strains.
