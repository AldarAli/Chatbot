Abstract - The realization that single channel MAC protocols do not
offer adequate end-to-end throughput has prompted researchers to
explore more scalable approaches such as multi-channel MAC
protocols. Multi-channel MAC protocols implementing a dedicated
control channel offer promising solutions. However, it has been
suggested that the use of a single control channel may lead to
saturation
problems.
The
saturation
problem
needs
to
be
investigated. The paper proposes a cyclic scheduling algorithm,
which schedules data transmission in phases. The scheme reduces
the signalling overhead of the control channel and improves its
capacity by reducing the effects of the channel switching delay and
the idleness of the control channel. The scheme is connection
oriented and implements the services of a network support systems,
which provides the network with the required intelligence for data
channels
reservation.
The
scheme
takes
advantage
of
the
integration of mesh routers and mesh clients in an overlaid wireless
mesh networks (WMN). Mesh routers are also deployed in the ad
hoc network of mesh clients to act as a network support backbone.
The mesh routers forming the network support backbone are
assumed to be within the communication range. We first analyze
the control bottleneck problem of the proposed scheme as a channel
selection and coordination problem requiring an effective channel
scheduling
technique.
The
scheduling
techniques
should
be
designed to minimize the effects of channel switching penalty on the
control channel. The techniques should also increase the scheduling
capacity of control channel. A single dedicated channel with at least
two data channels and one transceiver system was considered in the
analyses. The capacity of a single control channel is investigated as
the number of data channels is increased from two to fourteen.
Channel saturation is observed on data channels. Analytical results
show that a single dedicated control channel causes no bottlenecks.
Its capacity is affected by the saturation of data channels. The
proposed scheme was also evaluated through NS 2 simulations. The
numerical results show that the scheme is effective in reducing the
signalling overhead.

INTRODUCTION
The paper analyzes multi-channel MAC protocols, which
implement a dedicated control channel. The motivation is to
establish the effects of channel saturation on the performance of
the network and the causes of the saturation problem. The choice
of multichannel schemes, which employ a dedicated control
channel as a single signalling channel was motivated by the
ability of these schemes in ensuring total network connectivity.
The schemes under this category do not segment a network into
logical segments.
A scheme, which implements one transceiver, a dedicated
control channel, and at least two data channels is proposed. The
proposed scheme facilitates network connectivity and is designed
to use network resources efficiently. The saturation levels of
channels are first investigated including the capacity of the
control channel. The study seeks to establish through analytical
means whether a dedicated control channel is a bottleneck in
multi-channel
systems.
It
also
investigates
how
channel
switching penalty can be employed effectively in improving the
capacity of a control channel. The proposed scheme also attempts
to reduce the idle periods of the control channel with a view of
increasing its scheduling capacity.
The proposed a multi-channel scheme schedules flows on
data channels in cycles. The scheme incorporates channel
switching delay. Thereafter, through analytical means, the paper
studies the effect of the saturation problem on both control and
data channels. Key to the analysis is the capacity of the control
channel as the number of data channels is increased steadily from
two to fourteen. The paper tries to establish the soundness of this
approach through analytical and simulations.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the need for a
new multi-channel MAC scheme is discussed in Section II and
related works are highlighted in Section III. The model is
presented in Section IV and Section V presents the analytical
results. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated in
Section VI. The simulation model and the numerical results are
presented and discussed in Section VII. Section VIII then
concludes the paper.

MOTIVATION
Multi-channel MAC schemes have a potential of increasing
the capacity of current wireless access technologies. A number of
multi-channel MAC protocols show that this increase in capacity

is possible. However, channel selection and coordination needs to
be addressed if the full potential of multi-channel schemes is to
be realized. The multi-channel MAC protocols, which implement
a dedicated control channel architecture, are promising as they
facilitate total network connectivity.
Furthermore, a single transceiver system employing two data
channels and one dedicated control channel has been investigated
elsewhere. The saturation of the control channel did not impact
severely on the performance. It was established that the control
channel can support a reasonable number of data channels.
However, channel switching penalty has not been adequately
considered
in
channel
coordination
and
in
multi-channel
selection. Its effect has not been considered in the context of data
channels degradation and how it increases the scheduling
capacity of a dedicated control channel. When data transmission
is scheduled in cycles, it is possible to minimize the effect of
channel switching delay and to improve the capacity of the
control channel.

RELATED WORK
In this Section, multi-channel MAC protocols, which employ
either a temporary or a dedicated common control channel, are
reviewed. The evaluation focuses on the efficiency of MAC
protocols in reducing the signalling overhead of the control
channel and how they improve the scheduling capacity of the
control channel.
In [1] a temporary signalling channel called a default channel
is implemented. Nodes reserve data channels during the ATIM
window through the default channel. The reservation of the data
channels is done through a data structure called the Preferable
Channel
List
(PCL).
Nodes
exchange
the
ATIM/ATIM-
RES/ATIM-ACK packets during the ATIM window and then the
RTS/CTS packets during the data window to reserve one of the
data channels. The signalling duration is long and its overhead
cost is too high. All the signalling packets have been increased in
size. These challenges impact negatively on the efficiency of the
control channel and its scheduling capacity is reduced. During
the ATIM window, only the default channel is used while all the
data channels lie idle. The bandwidth of the data channels is
therefore, wasted during the ATIM window.
In
[2]
a
temporary
common
signalling
channel
is
implemented during the control window. One data channel is
selected by a number of pairs thereby increasing the probability
of data collisions. The sizes of all the control packets have been
increased, which degrades the performance of the control channel
and reduce its capacity to support many data channels. There is
also an additional signalling packet called the reserve (RES)
packet, which increases the signalling payload of the scheme.
The protocol is similar to [1] and it suffers from similar
constraints. The bandwidth of data channels is also wasted during
the control window.
A multi-channel MAC scheme employing a dedicated control
channel is proposed in [3]. The reservation of data channels is
done through the control channel with an aid of the local channel
tables. If a pair fails to reserve a data channel, they are given a
second chance to reserve a free data channel. Assuming that all
pairs succeed in their second attempts, a significant control
channel overhead will be incurred. The nodes also defer for a
DIFS and for the multi-channel switching durations, which
erodes the capacity of the control channel.
The reservation of
data channels is done when the current transmissions have ended.
Unfortunately, the control channel lies idle for fairly long
durations, which can be reduced to improve its capacity. The
bandwidth of the control channel is wasted when data frames are
being transmitted on the data channels. On the other hand, the
bandwidth of data channels is wasted as they are queued at the
control channel waiting for their next transmissions.
The feasibility and functionality of the scheme is challenged
in newly deployed networks and by the joining terminals. Joining
nodes have to first set all the channels unavailable until they have
updated their local channel tables. With inadequate network
information,
nodes
will
defer
indefinitely
their
next
transmissions. Nodes returning to the control channel are also
equally affected as they have to set all the channels unavailable
except the ones they have just visited. Nodes have to defer their
transmission until they have acquired adequate information about
the status of the network. This is not possible with a newly
deployed network where all nodes have no knowledge of the
network. In such a situation nodes will defer indefinitely their
transmission resulting in a blocked network state. There will be
no transmission that will take place, until nodes acquire adequate
network information.
CTS packets reserves a data channel, unfortunately they fail
to calm hidden nodes, which are in the sender neighbourhood.
The probability of collisions and destroyed packets will increase
forcing the scheme to retransmit a substantial amount of packets,
which will further degrade the capacity of the control channel.
Furthermore, nodes have limited processing power and storage
capability and cannot process efficiently the local node tables and
store the processed information.
The Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) [4] uses two
transceivers,
the
control
channel
and
the
data
channels
transceivers. The use of two transceivers is expensive in terms of
hardware costs. It also comes with increased design complexity.
There is also a signal linkage problem where signals from the
adjacent transceivers interfere with each other.
Each node keeps two data structures called the channel usage
list (CUL) and the free channel list (FUL). Their use is similar to
the three schemes above. The introduction of the RES packet also
causes further delays. The control channel and the control
channel
transceiver
will
be
idle
when
all
data
channel
transceivers are busy on the data channels. The capacity of the
control channel is therefore degraded. The bandwidth of the data
channels is equally wasted when they lie idle waiting for the
control channel to schedule data transmissions.
The scheme proposed in [5] also exploits the common control
channel approach. Nodes listen on the common channel to

synchronize their hopping sequences. Long signalling durations
are experienced by nodes when they negotiate and share hoping
sequences. Furthermore, nodes send RTR packets without
sensing channels, which may results in RTR collisions. Frequent
hopping involves a sizeable amount of channel switching delays,
which may significantly degrade the performance of the proposed
scheme.
In [6] a dedicated signalling channel is employed. The
dedicated channel is also used as a data channel after the
contention period. The protocol is divided into contention
reservation interval (CRI) and the contention free interval (CFI).
Nodes contend for network resources and data channels during
the CRI and they all defer their transmissions until the beginning
of the CFI. The deferment wastes resources and degrades the
capacity of the signalling channel. The protocol requires global
synchronization a challenge in wireless networks.
In [7] a system employing busy signals is proposed. A single
channel is divided into a control and a data channel. Busy signals
are sent on the control channel while data frames are being
transmitted on the data channels. The scheme assumes that a
node can send and listen at the same time. It also assumes that a
node can transmit on two channels simultaneously. The major
shortcoming of this scheme is the wastage of bandwidth of the
control channel â the busy signal channel.
Nodes in [8] [9] randomly select independent home channels
to listen on when they are idle. This approach segments a
network and does not facilitate network connectivity for effective
communication. The idea of data structures is also employed.
To address the problem of synchronization a guard time is
implemented
unfortunately
the
guard
time
degrades
the
performance of the protocol. On the other hand every packet sent
should include a 32 bit current time and seed. The time stamp
increases the payload of the protocol.
A new node, which has just joined a network, has to first wait
for ten seconds before it establishes and follows its own hoping
sequence. This waiting time increases the signaling overhead
cost. Courtesy HELLO packets are also sent to newly discovered
neighbours. The HELLO messages do degrade the performance
of the protocol and may fail to reach all the nodes on different
channels.
A scheme implementing a separate control channel and N
traffic channels is proposed in [10] and in [11]. A CTS selects the
clearest channel, unfortunately a CTS based data channel
selection scheme fails to calm hidden nodes at the senderâs
neighbourhood
as
a
result
there
will
be
numerous
retransmissions, which will degrade the control channel.
The
size of the control packets has been increased. The enlarged
packets will further degrade the capacity of the control channel.
The protocol assumes that nodes can sense all the channels
and receive on all the channels simultaneously. Nodes can sense
only one channel at a time and thereafter can switch to the next
channel incurring very high overhead costs in both channel
switching and channel sensing.
A multi-channel MAC protocol called dynamic channel
assignment with power control (DCA-PC) is proposed [12].
However, it uses the same channel access and reservation
mechanisms discussed in [4]. The proposed protocol therefore
suffers from the same challenges.
The paper in [13] proposed a Distributed Queue Dual
Channel (DQDC) scheme, which seeks to increase the utilization
of the data channels and to increase the achieved throughput. The
scheme implements the notion of a control channel however; the
DQDC introduces a four way packet handshake negotiation
scheme. The following packets are exchanged before a data
channel is reserved: Mesh Transmission Opportunity Request
(MTXOP REQ), Mesh Transmission Opportunity Response
(MTXOP
RSP),
Mesh
Transmission
Opportunity
Acknowledgment (MTXOP ACK) and Agreement Indicator
(AID). A three way handshake is also possible when the receiver
accepts the MTXOP REQ.
When the channel has been reserved, neighbouring nodes are
notified through the AID, which is sent by the node receiving the
MTXOP ACK. The AID is a broadcast message, which fails to
reach nodes, which are currently transmitting on data channels
and those, which are hidden from the AID broadcasting node.
Returning nodes assume that the data channels are busy until they
receive the reservation messages or after the expiry of a set
threshold. This delays the next transmissions of the returning
nodes and forces the control channel to be idle for longer time
frames. Furthermore the signaling overhead is significant and it
degrades the performance of the control channel. Nodes have to
update their DQ each time they receive an AID or MTXOP ACK
message. The DQ processing requires a node with unlimited
processing power and storage capacity.
The signalling delay should be reduced further. As noted
above, most multi-channel protocols suffer from high control
channel overhead and wastage of bandwidth of both the control
and data channels. These should be reduced to improve the
scheduling power of the control channel and to increase its
capacity. The idle durations of the control channel should also be
reduced
for
improved
control
channel
performance.
The
processing and storage constraints of mobile nodes should also
be considered. A number of other multi-channel MAC protocols
are discussed in [14] to [22]. The scheme proposed in [26] seeks
to address these and other challenges of multi-channel MAC
protocols, which employ the services of a control channel. A
common control channel is presented as a driver that can increase
the capacity of multi-channel MAC protocols.
IV.
THE MODEL
A Cyclic Scheduling algorithm (CSA), which is equipped
with network support infrastructure, is proposed. The network
infrastructure is designed to provide terminals with adequate
network information, which is required for the reservation of data
channels through the control channel. The main objective is to
31

reduce the signalling overhead of the control channel and
increase
its
scheduling
capacity.
The
network
support
infrastructure is made up of a network of mesh routers overlaid in
the ad hoc network of mesh clients. The mesh routers forming a
network support infrastructure are called the NST nodes. Every
NST node is within the communication range of the next NST
node. The mesh routers are powerful and intelligent. Their
communication ranges are wider and do cover as many mesh
clients as possible.
The proposed scheme requires the services of a single
transceiver and it divides the channels into one dedicated control
channel and n data channels. The number of data channels should
be at least two. The control packets, the Request To Send (RTS)
and the Clear To Send (CTS) will be transmitted on the control
channels. The data frames and the Acknowledgement (ACK)
packets will the transmitted on the data channels.
Data transmission on data channels is scheduled in cycles
when data channels are about to be free to improve the
scheduling capacity of the control channel. The sending nodes
will start contending for the control channel when the first
channel is about to be free. A communicating pair reserves the
next available data channel through the control channel. However
the reservation and the handshake of control packets will be done
before the data channel to be reserved becomes idle. Data
channel reservation starts when the remaining transmission time
of the current transmission on the data channel is exactly equal to
the duration of the control channel handshake. The data channel
will only become free as the new pair is switching onto the
reserved data channel. The switching will be completed when the
data channel is free. To ensure that the timing is perfect, an inter-
cycle duration, which is a function of the number of data
channels, is designed.
The switching penalty is considered in the design of our
scheme. The nodes switch to the reserved data channel after the
exchange of RTS/CTS. They do not defer for the summation of
DIFS
and
the
channel
switching
duration.
When
the
acknowledgement has been sent, the nodes will switch back onto
the control channel. Given this double effect of switching delay
on data channels, a control channel is unlikely to result in a
bottleneck. The scheduling capacity of the control channel is
likely to improve as nodes take longer to return to it. The control
channel will have more capacity to service the sender-receiver
pairs, which are currently in the queue. The data channels may
instead create a bottleneck in the system. The scheme takes
advantage of switching penalty to improve scheduling capacity of
a control channel. Carrier sensing and channel contention are
limited to the control channel to improve the capacity of the
protocol. Data channels are reserved thorough the network
support infrastructure.
The inter-cycle duration will separate data transmission
cycles and indicate when control channel reservation should start.
Given the inter-cycle duration, the next pair will initiate
communication
on
the
control
channel,
exchange
control
packages and then switch onto the data channel while it is still
busy sending data. The inter-cycle duration is the duration that
separate two consecutive cycles. Its value varies with the number
of data channels. It is an inter-cycle hold off duration whose
value is determined by (3). The busy data channel will be
expected to be free just before the next pair arrives on the data
channel.
The
implementation
of
the
network
support
infrastructure ensures that there are no retransmissions on the
data channels. Retransmissions are possible on the control
channel which implements the IEEE 802.11 channel reservation
mechanisms.
In a given cycle the first pair to reserve the control channel
will automatically reserve the first data channel; the second pair
will reserve the next data channel while the last pair in a cycle by
default will reserve the last data channel. There will be no
contention required for the data channels however; the nodes
have to contend for the access of the control channel. The
cyclical scheduling algorithm will tie access to data channels to
phases in a cycle to reduce the reservation duration and signalling
overheard. Access to data channels will be linked to the
reservation of the control channel. The access to data channels
will be in phases within a cycle.
The pair, which wins the control channel in phase one will
access the first data channel and in the Nth phase the Nth data
channel will be reserved by the Nth pair. The cyclic scheduling
algorithm will be memory based (network support) keeping track
of all the activities of the data channels, cycles and phases within
cycles. These details will be stored on the network support
infrastructure of multitasking mesh routers in a hybrid Mesh
network.
To explain further the concept behind the cyclic scheduling
algorithm Figure 1 is employed. The diagram though not in scale
is based on the length of control packets, channel switching
duration of 224Âµs and the length of data packets as stipulated in
the standard. The durations however, were changed to make them
more manageable and easy to work with. For example short
durations were scaled up while longer ones were scaled down.
This manipulation of the durations only reduces the duration of
the inter-cycle hold off time. However, the idea the paper
conveys can still be appreciated.

Channel 0 denotes the control channel, while channels 1 and
2 are the two data channels. The red arrow depicts the channel
switching delay. Lastly, the blue arrows represent data and
control packets durations.
In Figure 1 the two communicating pairs (ij) and (xy) will
automatically reserve data channels one and two respectively
during the first cycle. After the first cycle terminals will back off
for an inter-cycle duration to accommodate the switching delay
and to properly mark the beginning of the next cycle. For a three
channel system, the inter-cycle duration will be equal to the total
transmission duration of a data packet plus two switching
durations
minus
the
summation
of
three
control
packets
handshakes. The inter-cycle is computed using equation (3).
During the inter-cycle duration, the control channel lies idle until
the onset of the next cycle. The inter-cycle duration will reduce
as more data channels are implemented, which improves the
capacity of the control channel.
In the next cycle, the next pairs (st) and (uv) will reserve the
two data channels while the previous two pairs are still
communicating on the same two data channels. As the next pairs
are switching to data channels, the first pairs will complete their
transmission. The first pairs will then switch back to the control
channel to wait for the next cycle if they still have data to send.
The first pair in each cycle must reserve the first data channel.
This rule ensures a collision free data exchange on data channels.
The design of the hold off duration and the channel
coordination scheme is fundamental to the success of this
scheme. In Figure 1 only channel switching delay to a data
channel is depicted. The reverse channel switching delay is not
shown in the diagram.
In Figure 2, RTS, CTS, DATA and ACK packets are
presented in a form of a block diagram. It can be seen that this
approach waste bandwidth in the data channels during the first
cycle. This is caused by the switching delay and the use of
multiple channels. We call this bandwidth wastage; the multi-
channel
scheduling
cost
(MSC).
This
degradation
is
not
avoidable, but can be limited to the first cycle like in our case.
The MSC has been eliminated in the subsequent cycles by our
scheme. In the existing protocols, this cost is periodic and
repetitive. The switching cost and the multi-channel scheduling
cost are not evident in the subsequent phases as our cyclic
scheduling
protocol
takes advantage
of
switching
penalty
coupled with the inter-cycle duration to schedule concurrent
transmissions
in
a
proactive
manner.
The
multi-channel
scheduling cost is first identified in [26] and is common with
protocols implementing a common control channel.

Packet scheduling block diagram.
To calculate the amount of wasted bandwidth caused by the
multi-channel scheduling cost in our scheme, the following for
loop can be implemented:
This cost is limited to the first cycle in our scheme and its
value depends on the number of data channels N. As the number
of data channels is increased, the multi-channel scheduling cost
will increase as well. In the earlier protocols discussed in the

To evaluate the proposed scheme an analytical model was
designed to model channel occupancy and investigate the
capacities of control and data channels. The model examines the
saturation of data channels and the capacity of the control
channel to schedule successful data transmission onto the
available data channels. To test the efficiency and the scalability
of the control channel, the number of data channels was increased
from two to fourteen.
To investigate the capacity of the channels the following
equations based on our proposed idea were employed. The
equations capture the essence of our proposed scheme; they
emulate the allotment of bandwidth. The variables used in the
equations are explained in Table 1. The equations are based on

We now describe the functionality of the network support and
its significance in reducing the signalling overhead. We also
show how it facilitates communication in a newly deployed
network. The network support is also designed to provide joining
and returning nodes with information
initiate their next transmission immediately instead of deferring
them to a later stage. The network support takes advantage of the
composition of the WMN and its different nodes
different capabilities. Of interest is a hybrid WMN
addition to a backhaul of mesh routers and an Ad hoc network of
mesh clients, it has a backbone of fully connected mesh routers
within the ad hoc network of mesh clients.
Each node, which is part of the network
data structure called a Network Status Table (NST). These nodes
are referred to as the NST nodes. The NST nodes will store
information about the availability of data channels, list of data
channels, which are currently in use and when
available. The data channel will be said to be available when the
remaining transmission time is equal to the amount of time
required for the next pair to reserve it. This remaining time is
determined by the inter-cycle duration
earlier. The inter-cycle duration is stored in the NST as the
duration of the data transmission duration of a given data
channel. The network support nodes will also maintain a
sequence of data channels to ensure that data transmission is
scheduled in a round robin bases. The information maintained in
the status tables is made available to any node
NST node.
When a node wishes to send data and does not have a
complete understanding of the network status, it first probes the
nearest NST node.
Upon receiving this information it will be
able to exchange the control packets (RTS/CTS) on the control
channel and reserve a data channel,
The reservation is done before it becomes idle after the inter
cycle duration.
The network support system is of paramount importance for a
network, which has just been deployed. In such a scenario nodes
would not have a complete picture of the network status. Instead
of waiting indefinitely in attempt to gather information f
overheard control packets, nodes will simple probe the nearest
NST node. All the nodes current on the control channel and
within the coverage of the NST node will receive the probe
response. The responses will be used by a number of nodes to
update their own local tables. The local tables are expected to be
small and limited in size. This will help nodes with limited
processing
power
to
store
and
update
their
local
tables
effectively.
The NST information will also be helpful to joining and
returning nodes. A node, which has just been

data structure called a Network Status Table (NST). These nodes
are referred to as the NST nodes. The NST nodes will store
information about the availability of data channels, list of data
which are currently in use and when they will become
available. The data channel will be said to be available when the
remaining transmission time is equal to the amount of time
required for the next pair to reserve it. This remaining time is

cycle duration is stored in the NST as the
duration of the data transmission duration of a given data
channel. The network support nodes will also maintain a
sequence of data channels to ensure that data transmission is

the status tables is made available to any node, which probes the

adjacent networks when they have been handed over to the next
network. On the other hand, a node is said to be returning if it
was busy transmitting or receiving on a data channel. Upon the

ANALYTICAL RESULTS
In this section, the channel saturation problem is investigated
analytical. Both control and data channels are investigated. The
number of data channels was increased from two to fourteen to
investigate how increased capacity and congestion affects the
capacity of the control channel. All the channels were assumed to
have a bandwidth of 1Mbs. The channels were assumed to be
orthogonal for testing purposes. The three equations discussed in
the previous section were used in the analysis of the cyclic
scheduling algorithm.
It was noted that data channels transmit long packets as
compared to the control channel. Data channels are also
by channel switching delays. These two observations do affect
negatively the capacity of the data channels. On the o
short packets provide the control channel with more capacity to
drive many data channels.
In Figure 3 a system with one control channel and two data
channels was considered. The general topology had a total of
thirty nodes.
It was noted that the capacity of the two data
channels caused a bottleneck in the system. Their combined
capacity could support up to fourteen nodes. This translates to
seven nodes per a data channel. On the other hand the control
channel had enough capacity for the thirty nodes.

In Figure 9 similar observations were made. In this case a
total of fourteen data channels were considered. The general
topology had 210 nodes. The combined capacity of data channels
was only enough for ninety-eight nodes. The control channel
could support 182 nodes instead of 210. The control channel
began saturating after the 182nd node mark. This was t
general topology, which was investigated. The network provided
the shortest inter-cycle duration in our experimentation. The
inter-cycle reduces with every increase in the data channels as
more capacity is required by the control channel to sche
more transmission and drive more data channels. The control
channel becomes busier servicing an increasing load of data
channels. Furthermore, the multi-channel scheduling cost had its
biggest impact on the network with fourteen data channels.
Figure 10. Analysis of the saturation levels of data channels
A snap shot of the seven different data channels systems
ranging from the two data channels to the fourteen data channels
system shows a similar pattern in performances of the networks.
The performances of these seven networks are depicted in
10. All the data channels in each case saturated after the seventh
node. Therefore the average performance of data channels does
not increase as the number of the data channels is increased.
However the overall increase in capacity can be observed as data
channels are increased, though the performance remains the
same. It can be concluded that an increase in data rates will also
improve system capacity while the performance will remain
unchanged. The performance is therefore not expected to
improve though network capacity may show an increase in the
end to end throughput.
The analysis of the control channel for the seven different
cases reveals an interesting development in
performance and the capacity of the control channel is affected
by the number of data channels. Its performance reduces with

Following this
observation, we can conclude that the number of data channels
do degrade the performance of a control channel. It should be

ANALYZING THE CYCLIC
Multichannel MAC protocols implementing a single control
channel can be modeled as a queuing network. The network has
three distinct service points. The service points are depicted in
Figure12. These are the nodes marked Ns1 to Nsn, the control
channel identified as Cc1 and then the data channels marked as
Dc1 to Dcn. In the queuing model it can be seen that the control
channel can slow down the speed of the network as a single
service station fed by multiple servers and in turn sending its
output to multiple servers. The capacity of the control channel
therefore needs to be improved substantially. The control channel
server should have reasonable capacity to offer well balanced
service so that it can provide an efficient and a very fast link to
multiple servers at its input and output ends.

Figure 13. A multiple senerio in multichannel systems with a single signalling
channel
Figure 13 shows how the implementation of the
control channel as a single signaling channel results in the
formation of multiple queues. Data packets are first queued when
the nodes wait for the control channel to be free and contend for
it. In our analysis, we consider these packets as data flows
queued at the control channel and are denoted as DF1 to DFn.
When the data flow is de-queued from the control channel
then queued in the data channel queue. Thereafter the data flows
are served by the data channels. These two models clearly show
the significance of the control channel in
performance of multichannel networks, which implement the
notion of a signaling channel.
In the following three figures we evaluate four multichan
MAC protocols, which employ the idea of a control channel as a
single signaling channel. We assume a Markovian packet arrival
with an exponential inter arrival times. The arrival rate was
assumed to vary between 0.1 and 2.9. The control channel
service rate is based on the amount of time the control channel
will service a pair, which wants to reserve one of the available
data channels. The service rates were based on the payload of the

means that the capacity of the control channel has been improved

largest possible network. As can be seen in the figure, the
performance of the proposed scheme was very good. Its
performance did improve remarkable in a large network. The
performance gains can be attributed to the improved performance
of the inter-cycle duration in large networks. Secondly, the
achieved throughput remained the same as in Figure. 18 largely
due to spatial reuse. These results also show that an interfering
data flow causes a significant degradation as compared to the size
of the network.
The network in Figure 20 was three times larger than the one
in Figure 19. However, its achieved throughput is better despite
its size, which would have otherwise degraded its performance.
This confirms the argument that the CSA is more scalable and
that its performance does improve with network size.

CONCLUSION
The paper proposed a cyclic scheduling algorithm, which
incorporates channel switching delay in channel scheduling and
coordination. The scheme has been analyzed through analytical
means and through numerical simulations. The analysis shows
that the control channelâs capacity does not degrade the system.
The data channels on average saturate after the seventh node
degrading the performance of the system. To improve the
capacity of the data channels higher data rates can be considered.
They should not be increased to levels that degrade the
performance of the control channel.
The numerical results show that the proposed scheme reduces
the signaling delay of the control channel. The capacity of the
control channel and its scheduling capacity was show to improve
with the addition of more data channel. The implementation of
the inter-cycle duration is therefore very effective in large
networks. The inter-cycle ensures that a data channel is reserved
before the current transmission is completed, and that the multi-
channel scheduling cost is not repetitive but limited to the first
cycle.
The new multi-channel interference problem referred to as the
multi-channel scheduling cost in this project, is associated with
multi-channel MAC protocols implementing a single control
channel as a signaling channel. The analysis shows that the multi-
channel scheduling cost can be limited to the first cycle when the
cyclic scheduling algorithm is implemented. In the subsequent
cycles it can be eliminated by varying the size of the inter-cycle
duration and allowing data channels to be reserved when the
ongoing transmissions are about to end.
It is envisaged that this protocol provides a platform through,
which interference challenges such as the missing receiver
problem; the hidden terminal problem and the exposed terminal
problem can be addressed. These interference problems can be
reduced and cannot be eliminated.
