Abstract—This article is focused on the principles of the 
magnetic susceptibility measurement of the non-ferromagnetic 
substances using NMR tomography. Magnetic susceptibility is 
calculated from changes of the magnetic field close to the 
cylinder shaped specimen. Changes of the magnetic field in the 
3D vicinity of the specimen were integrated. Before integrating 
of the magnetic field changes it was necessary to filter, unwrap 
and detect the accurate position of the specimen. Magnetic 
susceptibility calculated from measured data is in comparison 
to theoretical value, as well as model value, only slightly 
different.

 INTRODUCTION 
An inhomogeneous static magnetic field (B0 filed) 
generates distortion in magnetic resonance images. 
Measuring the spatial variation of B0 is essential for 
automatic shimming. The domain 
source of 
field 
inhomogeneity in many MRI experiment is the variation of 
magnetic susceptibility of both the tissues of the human 
body and the implant materials. 
 
Magnetic susceptibility provides information on the 
tissue relative iron concentration that is useful for diagnosis 
and treatment of a number of diseases such as sickle cell 
disease, aplastic anaemia, thalassemia, haemochromatosis 
and Parkinson´s disease. In magnetic resonance imaging, the 
susceptibility effects have Essentials relevance for imaging 
contrast and artifact correction, functional brain imaging, 
molecular imaging and the measurement of blood 
oxygenation. Thus, it is highly significant to develop 
methods 
that 
can 
measure 
arbitratry 
susceptibility 
distributions.  
 
The knowledge of the magnetic susceptibility of tissues 
or various implants can help us to minimize the effect of 
magnetic susceptibility in MRI images via modification of 
pulse sequences, i.e. to correct artifacts in MRI images. 
These artifacts are manifested by the loss of signal, and new 
artifacts appear in the vicinity. For example, functional 
brain imaging using the gradient-echo planar imaging is 
based on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) 
susceptibility effects, which are believed to be dependent on 
neuronal activity in specific regions of the brain, as a result 
of cognitive tasks of human subjects (as well as animals) [1, 
2]. Depending on the location of the cortical areas that are 
involved in an fMRI study, the BOLD effect is strongly 
influenced by local field inhomogeneities created by 
differences in magnetic susceptibility – between air and 
tissue for example, and results in severe image distortion 
and signal loss. Signal loss is a major problem in fMRI 
studies [3, 4]. The measurement of magnetic susceptibility 
of magnetically compatible materials (the NMR measuring 
method enables obtaining a signal even inside the specimen) 
has been the subject of study undertaken by Lin, who 
calculates susceptibility using a delineated area inside the 
specimen [5, 6].  
 
In this paper, we deal with magnetic susceptibility 
measurement of non ferromagnetic materials in macroscopic 
view. For calculating of magnetic susceptibility we used 3D 
(three dimensional) mapped reaction filed in the vicinity of 
specimen. Chapter II and III the basis of method of 
magnetic susceptibility measurement is described. Our 
experimental measurements and signal processing are 
mentioned in chapter IV. The conclusions and discussions 
about our results are presented in chapter V. 
II. 
METHODS 
This method of susceptibility measurement is based on the 
assumption of constant magnetic flux in the working space 
of superconducting magnet. Inserting a specimen with 
magnetic susceptibility s causes local deformation of 
previously homogeneous magnetic field – for illustration see 
Fig. 1. 
 
The magnitude of these deformations depends on the 
difference of magnetic susceptibility of the specimen χs and 
of its vicinity v, on the volume and shape of the specimen, 
and on the magnitude of basic field B0.

THEORETICAL ANALYSIS 
The method was verified via an experiment with a number 
of specimens on a 4.7 T/76 mm MR tomograph in ISI AS 
Brno (1H ≈ 200 MHz). The specimens to be measured were 
of different materials in the shape of cylinders 3 mm in 
diameter and 10 mm in length (No. 2 in Fig. 2). They were 
placed in a glass container in the shape of a 40 x 40 x 40 
mm cube (No. 1 in Fig. 2) filled with a solution of water 
with this concentration: 1 liter deionized water, 1.2 gram 
NiSO4 and 2.6 gram NaCl in order to shorten the relaxation 
times to T1 = T2 = 130 ms. Magnetic susceptibility of this 
solution was χv = –13.0·10-6. When measuring materials 
with nearly the same susceptibility, the reaction field will 
not be induced.

One of the MR measurement methods – the Gradient echo 
(GE) method is very sensitive to inhomogeneities of the 
static magnetic field and this can be useful for susceptibility 
measurement [5]. Because the reaction field is generated 
proportionally to material susceptibility, it is possible to use 
the GE method for its measurement. The GE sequence 
depicted in Fig. 3 with the parameters: echo time TE =17 ms, 
repetition time TR = 5 s, was used to obtain an MR image of 
the reaction field in the vicinity of the measured specimen.

The MR image obtained using the GE technique is 
phase-modulated by the magnetic induction change and, on 
condition of proper experiment arrangement we can obtain 
the image of magnetic field distribution in the specimen 
vicinity. For the calculation of the reaction field ΔB we can 
give the following relation:

a magnetization which is more sensitive to the reaction 
field, but due to relaxation time T2

signal-to-noise ratio.

IV. 
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
From 
magnetic 
resonance 
system 
we 
obtain 
two 
dimensional data (image matrix 128 x 128 px). An example 
of 1 slice you can see in Fig. 2 point 3. The measurement 
was made for 64 slices. These data were further processed in 
the Marevisi and Matlab programs. To remove the effect of 
the inhomogeneities of magnetic field background we used 
two measurements – with embedded specimen and blind 
measurement (without specimen). The procedure of 
processing data from the two measurements is indicated in 
Fig. 4. Both data matrices were transformed using FFT in 
the Marevisi program. Marevisi is a program for data 
processing and visualization for MRI [9]. The program was 
developed by Jana and Zenon Starcuk and Piotr Kozlowski. 
Further processing continues in the Matlab program, using 
the algorithm created. From the complex 3D data points, 
only the phase component was further used. Because the 
phase image was periodically wrapped (this means 
discontinuities in the phase change between – and ), the 
next operation was unwrapping. To map the reaction field, 
measuring with the GE pulse sequence for two echo times 
TE can be employed [10,11]. The blind phase image was 
subsequently subtracted from the one with specimen to 
eliminate the inhomogeneity of the basic tomograph field. 
The differential phase image was converted to the reaction 
field magnetic flux density using (3). Inside the specimen 
are any hydrogen atoms. Therefore we obtain any inside the 
specimen any useful signal, but only noise. For calculation 
of magnetic susceptibility we use only vicinity of the 
specimen and we replace the measured data inside in 
specimen with zeros.

Fig. 5 is the graphical representation of the distribution 
of reaction magnetic field ΔB in a section through the 
aluminum specimen measured (the section corresponds to 
point 3 in Fig. 2). The picture was created in Matlab 
program from the measured values of reaction field in the 
vicinity of measured specimen. In the picture you can see 
the zeros place, there was measurement. Magnetic 
susceptibility was calculated from 3D distribution of the 
reaction magnetic field by relation (4).

The last step is susceptibility calculation. For discrete 
processing of the data measured will lead to equation (4). 
This equation will be used to calculate differential magnetic 
susceptibility . To obtain magnetic susceptibility of the 
specimen s we substitute the value into equation (5).

CONCLUSION 
The calculation of magnetic susceptibility by relations 
(4) and (5) was verified experimentally on an MR 
tomography system and via processing the data 
measured as shown in Fig. 4. The specimens were a 
copper and an aluminium cylinder, of known magnetic 
susceptibility and purity (see Table I). In comparison 
with the known magnetic susceptibility values the 
measuring error is in both cases less than 3.23 %.  
However, there are some limitations to the proposed 
method. A disadvantage of the proposed method 
consists in that the accuracy of magnetic susceptibility 
calculation depends on the shape of specimen (have to 
be cylinder or block). In the future, the measuring 
method can be used to establish the susceptibility of 
tissues or implants in the human body and, thanks to 
this knowledge; it will be possible to attenuate the 
artifacts in MRI images produced by these materials.
