Abstract—Privacy engineering has recently attracted attention
from professionals;
therefore,
current
literature
includes
methodologies to support privacy modelling and system design.
However, in order to ensure appropriate and successful
implementation of these methodologies, it is important to
develop business and system analyses focusing on privacy and
security issues. The paper aims to identify privacy engineering
requirements and conditions and model them for further
holistic system architecture development in the eHealthcare
context. The results show the demand to strongly focus on
business architecture development for further mapping the
privacy requirements into security systems.
Keywords-Privacy; Security; Privacy by Design; Business
Architecture; System Architecture; ArchiMate.

INTRODUCTION
Protection of data privacy is becoming a key challenge
for most business entities. The discussions are now very
intensive, particularly because of the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) [1] introduced in 2016 in European
Union (EU) member countries. However, due to the big data
and information, the GDPR recommendations are becoming
popular in the digital space. Therefore, identifying key
indicators for patient configured privacy policy in relation to
eHealthcare personalized services is also very important and
valid. Taking into account the existing literature, it is
necessary to mention that information privacy refers mostly
to the right to exercise control over the use of personal
information. However, in this paper, we emphasize the need
to develop a holistic approach for privacy requirements
specification
and
modelling.
The
privacy
by
design
approach, as well as Information Boundary Theory (IBT),
and Communications Privacy Management Theory are used
in discussion for this development. The privacy paradox is
explained
and
the
business
architecture
and
system
architecture models are presented. The paper is organized as
follows. Firstly, background information regarding the
privacy concepts is provided. Next, in Section 2, the
literature review on Privacy by Design (PbD) approach is
discussed. Further, in Section 3, the eHealthcare issues are
presented as a certain context of privacy issues. Then,
models of business architecture and system architecture in
ArchiMate language are considered. This is followed by the
discussion of results of the models' analysis. The conclusions
cover implications and limitations of the work presented.

PRIVACY VS. SECURITY
Any information about an individual maintained and
processed by an agency, including data on the individual's
identity,
i.e., names, social security number, personal
identification number, parents' names, or biometric records is
personal information and as such is usually linked to other
medical,
educational,
financial,
and
employment
information. In this context, privacy is an ability to control
this information, because individuals are interested in
keeping some of their personal information hidden from
others.
According to de Souza et al. [2] privacy is a fundamental
right guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly.
Reference [3] includes a classification of different types of
privacy:

Personal privacy concerning the privacy of personal
attributes.

Informational privacy involving the protection of
unauthorized access to information.

Institutional privacy referring to the administration of
organizational private data as well as strategic
business information.
Burgoon et al. [4] assume a multidimensional approach
and define privacy as the ability to control and limit physical,
interactional, psychological, and informational access to a
social group or just to its entity. For Solove [5], privacy is
valued contextually, and it includes practices of information
collecting,
processing,
dissemination
and
invasion.
Information Boundary Theory (IBT) was formulated to
explain the psychological processes individuals use to
control the flows of private information. The theory proposes
that consumers form physical or virtual informational spaces
around them. The boundaries around the spaces play
important roles in their willingness to
reveal private
information or not. Any attempt by an external party to cross
these boundaries is perceived as an invasion. According to
Communications Privacy Management Theory (CPMT),
disclosure of private information renders people vulnerable
to opportunistic exploitation, because the disclosed private
information becomes
co-owned
by
other parties. The
boundary management mechanisms are developed to help
people
maximize
the
benefits
of
revealing
private
information
while
simultaneously
reduce
the
risks
of
opportunistic behavior resulting from intrusive access.

In general, privacy is determined by the context, i.e.,
business environment, the individual value system and
confidence awareness, which may encourage people to
reveal their personal information.
The value system
constructs
social
patterns
of
all
aspects
of
human
interactions. Sherif et al. [6] argue that shared patterns of
behaviours
and
interactions,
cognitive
constructs,
and
affective understandings are learned through a process of
socialization. Privacy culture and security culture are defined
as ideas, customs, habits, and social behaviours that help
individuals to survive as a community. Cavoukian and
Chibba [7] argue that while information security concerns
protecting personal data through confidentiality, integrity,
and availability control, privacy is about unlinkability,
transparency, and intervenability assurance. Security is about
how information is protected, but privacy is on how it is
maintained and used.
Literature review reveals principles of data privacy
assurance. The principles are hidden in theories, standards,
and various regulations. Particularly important standards are
as follows:

The ISO 9241-210:2010 Ergonomics of human-
system interaction Part 210: Human-centered design
for interactive systems, which, as a framework for
human-centered design processes, integrates different
designs and developments appropriate in a particular
context [8].

The ISO/IEC 25010:2011 SQuaRE Systems and
Software
Quality
Requirements
and
Evaluation,
which is a standard that defines the system and
software quality, which is highly focused on system's
quality of use [8].

The ISO/IEC 27034-3:2018 Information Technology
- Application Security- Part 3: Application security
management process, which is a part of standard
series assisting organization in integrating security
into the life cycle of their applications by providing
frameworks and processes at the organization [10].

The ISO/IEC 29100:2011 Information Technology -
Security Techniques - Privacy Framework, applicable
to individuals and organizations involved in the
specification, procurement, architecturing, designing,
developing, testing, maintaining, administering, and
operating information and communication technology
systems and services, where privacy controls are
required for the processing of Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) [11].

The ISO/IEC 29147 - Information Technology -
Security
Techniques
-
Vulnerability
Disclosure,
which is a standard providing requirements and
recommendations to vendors on the disclosure of
vulnerabilities in products and services [12].
According to the last standard, privacy preferences are to
be confronted with privacy safeguarding controls. The
privacy principles included there concern data subject's
consent and choice, purpose legitimacy and specification,
collection limitation, data minimization, data use, retention
and disclosure limitation, data accuracy and quality, data
openness, transparency and notice, data subject's individual
participation and access, accountability, information security,
and privacy compliance. In May 25, 2018 the GDPR came in
effect
mandating
data
controllers
and
processors
to
emphasize transparency, security, and accountability of
processed data. The GDPR specifies seven data protection
principles that business organizations are to follow when
collecting, processing, transferring, and storing individuals'
personal data (Table 1). The Organization for Economic Co-
operation
and
Development
(OECD)
[13]
provided
principles similar to the GDPR work (Table I). The
regulations discussed above do not concern Privacy by
Design (PbD) approach.

In 2011, Cavoukian published her Privacy by Design
principles [14], which for years have been treated as the de
facto standard in privacy protection (Table I). In Article 29,
Data Protection Working Party, the proposed principles that
should be respected in PbD approach are as follows:

Choice and consent principle defining that data
controllers and processors should describe choices
suitable to the data subjects to obtain appropriate
consents.

Legitimate data use purpose specification and use
limitations.

Personal
information
and
sensitive
information
lifecycle management to ensure minimization of data
collection and all its use, just to the strictly specified,
documented purposes.

Accuracy and quality of data that is processed and
utilized.

Providing clear, accessible, transparent and accurate
details
about
business
organization
privacy
management
program
on
how
information
is
processed.

Development of procedures to allow data subjects to
withdraw the consent to use their personal data at any
time.

Establishing the requirements for data protection
officers' responsibilities and actions.


Development of security policies and supporting
procedures.

Implementation
of
monitoring,
measuring
and
reporting procedures to provide sufficient regular
privacy and security control.

Preventing harms, reducing risk, and protecting vital
interests of data subjects.

Documenting the management policies and control
cooperation with third party vendors and security
outsourcing companies.

Elaboration of documented personal data breach
policies and
supporting procedures that
include
requirements
for
notifications
of
appropriate
supervisory authorities.

Development
of
procedures
concerning
implementation technologies and PbD protection.

Maintaining the policies and procedures to contact the
appropriate supervisory authorities.
Nowadays,
the
PbD
issue
seems
to
be
increasingly
important,
particularly
because
people
commonly
use
Internet of Things (IoT) applications. An exemplary list of
devices includes baby monitors, smart home assistants,
connected safety-relevant products such as smoke detectors
and door locks, smart cameras, TVs and speakers, wearable
health trackers, connected home automation and alarm
systems. The devices should be safe and secured. Safety is
assumed to be a situation, in which people are protected from
injury, but security is identified with a condition, where
individuals are protected
against the consequences of
malicious acts. Taking into account the IoT common usage,
security and privacy should be embedded in the IoT software
application development. Privacy and security by design
mean that basic security features are to be built into products
and the consumer should learn how to secure their devices.
The
PbD
and
security
by
design
ideas
require
methodological approaches and good practices guidelines.
The Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security [15] covers
the
following
guidelines:
password
idiosyncrasy,
vulnerability disclosure policy implementation, software
updating, credentials protection, remote control, software
integrity,
personal
data
protection,
system
resilience,
monitoring telemetry data, and making personal data easy to
delete. So, the suggested PbD methodological approach is
expected to emphasize the principles of response to customer
needs, monitoring, learning and anticipation.
III.
PRIVACY BY DESIGN - LITERATURE REVIEW
At first glance, the idea of PbD can be recognized as an
approach
that
promotes
privacy
and
data
protection
compliance from the start of data collecting and processing
and maintains such protection in the whole information
system lifecycle. Beyond that, it is expected to increase the
awareness of privacy and decrease human vulnerabilities.
Literature review confirms this attitude. The fundamental
reviews have been done using the following tools: 1)
IEEEXplore Digital Library [16], 2) AIS (Association of
Information Systems) eLibrary [17], 3) ScienceDirect.com
[18], 4) Google Scholar [19], 5) Sage Journals [20], 6)
Scopus [21], and 7) Web of Science (WoS) research paper
repository [22]. The numbers of publications found in these
repositories
were
impressive,
but
incomparable.
The
maximum
number
of
publications
were
presented
in
GoogleScholar, i.e., 3 340 200 papers, and the smallest on
IEEEXplore Digital Libery, i.e., 2791 papers. The reviewed
papers include considerations on combining the Privacy by
Design
concept
with
information
system
development
methodologies. According to information from the surveyed
repositories, lately, authors are working on privacy issues in
big data methodologies, as well as in Internet of Things (IoT)
application design and implementation. However, in years
2009-2019 , the volume of publications in Google Scholar is
going down. Evident increase of growth rates happened in
2012-2014 for WoS publications. The literature review has
been done at the beginning of 2019, therefore the minor
volume of publications for this year has been registered.
However, taking into account further research work on PbD
approach in eHealthcare system modelling, this huge volume
of papers was reduced to the list of publications in Table II.

protecting personal information. The reviewed research

many
questions
for
further
investigation, particularly in social networks.
IV.
EHEALTHCARE ARCHITECTURE MODELS INCLUDING
PRIVACY BY DESIGN
Information
Communication
Technology
(ICT)
is
incorporated into healthcare management programs enabling
care personalization to an individual's needs. The patient-
physician relationship system with more virtual interactions
is possible to better coordinate care. The relationship systems
are developed as formal support of the medical services, as
well as informal communication in social networks. The
European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies
(EGE) [33] published an opinion on the ethical implications
of new health technologies and individual participation.
Therein, they have identified a set of risks. Patients’ group
focusing on particular diseases take greater responsibility for
their health. They are voluntary involved and openly
manifest using the online forums their private problems and
data.
They
share
symptoms,
advices,
opinions,
and
diagnoses. They use social media and internet forums to
verify the quality of the professional healthcare as well as for
ranking
services
and
physicians.
Internet
and
mobile
applications
enable them
to
avoid
traditional
medical
services and develop self-diagnosing and self-treatment. This
behavior implies that in some contexts, like medication
assistance and monitoring, specific health parameters are
revealed and individuals lose control on them. Although in
the technical design professionals think about privacy in the
aspect of problems of data collecting and security, the social
networks
people
consider
the
privacy
effects
of
communication on humans and they are open to exchange
views in their own individual interests. The need to help
themselves and to help others strongly stimulates them to
reveal private data. According to Yoo et al. [34], privacy
paradox is a phenomenon whereby individuals present strong
privacy
concerns,
but
they
disclose
their
personal
information. Within an individual’s borders, people want to
be free to self-determine what they want to reveal. On the
other hand, society also has impact on defining these borders
by accepting, supporting, tolerating, mocking or punishing.
Unfortunately, some people see only the informational
aspect without perceiving the consequences of privacy
revealing for social relationship development. eHealthcare
architecture modelling with respect to the PbD approach can
be considered as a privacy engineering issue. The system
architecture models proposed below are embedded in a
specific healthcare context, particularly they concern the
eHealthcare self-treatment, which as such is strongly based
on the use of wearable devices, human behaviour monitors
and smart assistants. In this paper, system architecture
models are presented in the ArchiMate language [35].
Therefore, as it is in The Open Group Architecture
Framework (TOGAF) [36] four architecture layers are
defined. In the aspect of privacy management, the motivation
layer is the most important. Here, perceived privacy risks,
principles,
constraints,
stakeholders,
their
requirements,
goals and values are to be identified and considered (Fig. 1).
Privacy risk is defined as a loss resulting from the negative
outcomes and the possibility of an opportunistic behaviour of
other parties. Privacy risk includes the misuse of private
personal information or unauthorized access and theft [37].
In literature, privacy is perceived from the point of view of
reputation
loss
and
identity
theft
[38].
However,
in
opposition to that interpretation, private personal data is
perceived as necessary to self-promotion. Privacy revealing
actions are considered as good investments for individual
and organizational development. In Fig. 1, the fundamental
concepts of TOGAF motivation layer for eHealthcare self-
management are presented.
Figure 1.
eHealthcare Self-Treatment Architecture Model: Motivation
Layer in ArchiMate.
The next TOGAF layer is Archimate Business Layer,
which includes the specification of fundamental business
concepts,
i.e.,
business
partners,
processes,
services,
functions, and objects (Fig. 2). Particularly, the process of
control is to be embedded in most privacy regulations, so it is
used to operationalize privacy.
Figure 2.
eHealthcare Self-Treatment Architecture Model: Business Layer
in ArchiMate.
The eHealthcare consultation process comprises on the
one side actions to reveal data, on the other side to hide and
protect them. Therefore, basically, to prevent a privacy
breach event the following activities are required [39]:

Monitor of the event trigger generation.

Notice of event triggers to privacy stakeholders.

INFOCOMP 2019 : The Ninth International Conference on Advanced Communications and Computation


Blocking leakages to avoid personal data flows to the
wrong hands.

Security of delivery channel - encryption.
Anonymity,
pseudonymization,
unlinkability,
and
confidentiality prevent individual privacy from revealing i.e.,
breach of confidentiality. That process decomposition is
presented
in
Fig.
3.
Although
in
some
cases
"less
identification
means
more
privacy"
[40],
however,
sometimes less data, but discovering critical data can lead to
violation of privacy.
Figure 3.
eHealthcare Self-Treatment Architecture Model: Recipient
Private Data Security Process in ArchiMate.
The Data Governance process emphasized in Fig. 4 is
assumed to include activities to appropriate data provenance,
accuracy, lawfulness, fairness, transparency, integrity, and
accountability. Implementation of all these processes is not
common, however, it should be considered as obligatory.
Even the knowledge broker’s role is difficult, but in the
interests of patients and their life protection, this role is
needed. In the TOGAF framework, the next two layers cover
software and hardware architecture modelling (Fig. 4).
Figure 4.
eHealthcare Self-Treatment Architecture Model: Software and
Hardware Layers in ArchiMate.
Technologies like firewalls and access control filters are
implemented to ensure the security of information assets,
but they cannot provide enforcement of acceptable use
policies, because of the users, who make decisions on the
usage of confidential data and documents.
V.
CONCLUSION
The Privacy by Design approach makes the application
or information system more reliable from the personal data
management point of view. Following literature review, we
conclude that the PbD approach is implemented in software
development methodologies. However, in this paper, the
holistic approach to privacy management is proposed.
Therefore, the system architecture modelling is presented.
The TOGAF architecture models for motivation, business,
software and hardware layers are included in Figures. The
ArchiMate language and modelling tool were used. In this
paper, privacy is discussed as a social category and issue,
which is determined by personal data subjects. Beyond that,
there are solutions developed for personal data protection.
The
fundamental
processes of data
security
are
also
presented
in
ArchiMate
language
in
this
paper.
The
architecture modelling can be further considered as an
introduction to application development. The limitation of
the presented analysis results from the weaknesses of the
applied tool, i.e., ArchiMate. On the one hand, it is suitable
for modelling motivation and explaining preferences, but, on
the other hand ArchiMate is not integrated with other
software engineering tools.
