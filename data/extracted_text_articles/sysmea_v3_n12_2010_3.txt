Abstract—
In
this
paper
we
propose
and
assess
the
performance of relay-assisted schemes designed for both the
uplink and downlink OFDM based systems, using efficient
distributed
space-frequency
block
coding
protocols.
We
consider the use of an antenna array at the base station and a
single antenna at the user terminal. At the relay node we
consider either single antenna or an antenna array. We assume
that some of the user terminals deployed in a certain area
could act as relaying-able terminals for the communication of
other
users.
Two
types
of
relay-assisted
protocols
are
considered: equalize-and-forward and decode-and-forward.
The optimal maximum ratio combining coefficients are derived
for the proposed relay-assisted schemes. The performance of
these
cooperative
schemes
is
evaluated
under
realistic
scenarios, considering typical pedestrian scenarios based on
WiMAX specifications and using channel convolutional turbo
code. The proposed schemes are also compared against the
non-cooperative OFDM based systems. Numerical results show
that
the
availability
of
antenna
arrays
at
the
relays
significantly improves the cooperative systems performance,
which outperform the non-cooperative ones in most studied
scenarios.
Keywords - OFDM, relay, multiple antennas, cooperation,
downlink and uplink.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Wireless systems are one of the key components for
enabling the information society. To meet the service
requirements of future multimedia applications, Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is being adopted
in various kinds of broadband wireless systems [2][3].
Cooperative
communications
is
one of
the
fastest
growing areas of research, and it is likely to be a key
enabling technology for efficient spectrum use in the years to
come. The key idea in user-cooperation is that of resource
sharing among multiple nodes in a network [4][5]. It is
commonly agreed that the provision of the broadband
wireless component of the future wireless systems will
probably
rely
on
the
use
of
multiple
antennas
at
transmitter/receiver
side.
Multiple-input,
multiple-output
(MIMO) wireless communications are effective at mitigating
the channel fading and thus improving the cellular system
capacity. By configuring multiple antennas at both the base
station (BS) and user terminal (UT), the channel capacity
may be improved proportionally to the minimum number of
the antennas at the transmitter and receiver [6]. However,
considering a conventional cellular architecture with co-
located antennas there is significant correlation between
channels in some environments.
Cooperative diversity is a promising solution for wireless
systems to increase capacity, extend coverage and provide
fairness, namely for the scenarios where the direct link is in
outage and the inter-user channel has good quality [4]. It can
be achieved through cooperation of users, which share their
antennas and thereby create a virtual antenna array (VAA)
system. It is well known that the wireless channel is quite
bursty, i.e., when a channel is in a severe fading state, it is
likely to stay in the sate for a while. Thus, when a source
cannot reach its destination due to severe fading, it will not
be of much help trying by leveraging repeating-transmission
protocols. However, if a third terminal that receives the data
from the source could help via a channel that is independent
from source to destination link, the chance for a successful
transmission would increase, thus improving the overall
system performance [7].
Research on cooperative diversity can be traced back to
the pioneering papers of van der Meulen [8] and Cover [9]
on the information theoretic properties of the relay channel.
Explicit cooperation of neighbouring nodes was considered
in [10][11]. Considering various degrees of knowledge of
channel state information (CSI), they show that significant
gains
can
be
achieved
over
non-cooperative
direct
transmission. In [12] the authors have resorted, to solve the
half duplex constraint, to a two-stage protocol and have
shown in several papers that the use of cooperation provides
a spatial diversity gain.
The concept of VAA or virtual MIMO has been
introduced in [13], derived from the principles of relaying
channel. Recently, the use of space-time block coding
(STBC) implemented in a distributed fashion providing user
cooperation has been proposed [14][15][16]. However,
despite the extensive literature on cooperative relaying
diversity, most of the work only considers single antenna
relays. Studies and practical schemes with relays equipped
with an antenna array are relatively scarce. Furthermore,
most of the proposed schemes are not targeting OFDM based
systems
and/or
have
been
assessed
under
unrealistic
scenarios.
In [17] a theoretical diversity-multiplexing trade-off
study is presented for a cooperative system with 1 and 2
antennas in a single relay scheme. In [18], a multiple
antenna
half-duplex
relay–assisted
maximum
ratio
combining (MRC) transmission scheme, that uses the
decode-and-forward protocol has been proposed to increase

coverage. However, this scheme requires the knowledge of
the instantaneous CSI prior to the transmission at the relays.
Furthermore, in [19] the Rayleigh performance of a single-
relay cooperative scenario with multiple-antenna nodes has
been investigated, and pairwise error probability expressions
were derived. Recently, a robust MIMO relay for multipoint-
to-multipoint communication in wireless networks, and
based on amplify and forward (AF) protocol, has been
proposed [20].
In this paper we provide a detailed description of the
work that we have started and presented at [1], on
single/multiple antenna relay-assisted cooperative schemes
designed for the uplink (UL) OFDM systems, and at [21], on
single antenna relay-assisted cooperative schemes designed
for the downlink (DL) OFDM systems. Moreover, we extend
the latter scheme from single antenna relay to multiple
antenna relay. We consider that some of the user terminals
deployed in a certain area could act as relaying-able
terminals for the communications of other users. We also
assume
that
these
terminals
are
available
idle
users
connected to the network. The considered relay-assisted
(RA) protocols are: equalize-and-forward (EF) and decode-
and-forward (DF). Their performance is evaluated under
realistic scenarios, considering typical pedestrian scenarios
based on WiMAX specifications and channel turbo coding.
These schemes are also compared against either SIMO or
MISO OFDM non-cooperative uplink or downlink systems,
respectively.
Simulations
reveal
that
the
proposed
cooperative schemes outperform the non-cooperative ones in
most of the studied scenarios and that the availability of two-
antenna arrays at the relay nodes dramatically increases the
cooperative systems performance. Cooperating is especially
advantageous when the source-to-relay link is better than the
source-to-destination link, so that the relay receives data
correctly and can have a considerable impact on the final
performance.
The remaining paper is organized as follows: in section II
we present a general description of the proposed multiple
antenna relay-assisted for uplink and downlink systems. In
sections III and IV, we derive and analyze the link equations
for those relay-assisted schemes for uplink and downlink,
respectively. The optimal relay-assisted MRC coefficients
are derived. In section V, we assess the performance, in
terms of BER, in several communication scenarios. The first
part is devoted to discuss the uplink results while second one
is for downlink. Finally, the main conclusions are pointed
out in section VI.

SYSTEM MODEL
Figs. 1 and 2 depict the proposed multiple antenna relay-
assisted scheme for both the uplink and downlink OFDM
based systems, which consist of a user terminal equipped
with a single antenna, a base station equipped with an
antenna array and a relay node which can have either one or
two antennas.
Figure 1. Single/double antenna relay-assisted system model for uplink.
Fig. 1 shows the system model for the uplink. We
consider that Nc subcarriers are assigned to the UT. From this
scenario, three main links can be identified: the direct UT-to-
BS link, represented by

1,2

channels; the UT-to-
RN link, formed by channels

where index p denotes the pth subcarrier. If the RN has a

links are represented by channels

respectively.
Fig. 2 is analogous to Fig. 1, but for the downlink. Since
the BS is equipped with 2 transmit antennas (M=2), the non-
cooperative link is a 2×1 MISO channel. It is represented by
the

If the RN has a single antenna, the BS-to-RN and RN-to-
UT links are represented by channels
,
,
1,2
m p

, and
p

, respectively. Since we assume the relay is half-duplex,
the
communication
cycle
for
both
aforementioned
cooperative schemes requires two phases:

In the first one, the source, UT or BS depending on
whether
UL or DL systems are considered,
broadcasts its own data at full power to its
destination (BS or UT), and also to the relay node,
which does not transmit data during this stage. For
the downlink systems, the data are space-frequency
encoded before transmission.

During the second phase, the relay node can help
the source by forwarding the information, also at
full power, to the destination node (BS or UT),
whereas the source is idle. If the RN is equipped
with a 2-antenna array, the data to be transmitted to
the BS or UT must also
be space-frequency
encoded.
The mapping scheme with two transmit antennas used in
this work is shown in Table I [23] , where sp is either the soft
or hard decoded data estimated at the relay node on the pth
subcarrier for equalize-and-forward or decode-and-forward,
respectively. Factor 1/ 2 is included in order to constrain
the transmitted energy to one and (.)* denotes complex
conjugation.

UPLINK RELAY-ASSISTED SCHEMES
We analyze two half-duplex multiple antenna relay-
assisted schemes: equalize-and-forward and decode-and-
forward. Throughout this paper, we shall refer to these
schemes as 1×L×M RA EF and 1×L×M RA DF, depending
on the number of antennas at the relay node (L) and BS (M).
Without loss of generality, hereinafter the mathematical
formulation refers to a generic subcarrier p .
A.
Relay-Assisted Equalize-and-Forward
In this work we consider that the RN node is either
equipped with a single antenna or a 2-antenna array. For the
first case, the amplify-and-forward protocol studied in [22] is
equivalent to the RA EF protocol proposed here. However, if
the signal at the relay is collected by two antennas, doing just
a simple amplify-and-forward it is not the best strategy. We
need to perform some kind of equalization to combine the
received signals before re-transmission.
According to the communication cycle adopted in this
paper, the received signal during the first communication
phase at the BS antenna m , is found to be

Relay-Assisted Decode and Forward
In contrast to RA EF, in the RA DF scheme, the relay
hard decodes the incoming signals before forwarding them.
The communication cycle for RA DF is as follows.
Firstly, the UT transmits at full power for Ts of the time.
The expressions for the signals at the receiving antennas of
the BS and RN for the first phase are the same as presented
in (1) and (2), respectively.
During the second phase, the RN demodulates, decodes
and forwards the received signals. Thus, the received signals
at the RN at instant t are combined using MRC, and the soft
decision in the RN,
p
s , is also given by (3). Now, if
p
s is
successfully detected, then the data to be retransmitted by
the RN, here represented by
ps , is the correct data

obtained from (9) replacing

As it can be seen from (15) and (17), in the outage case
when the relay fails to decode the data correctly, it cannot
help the UT for the current cooperation round. In such case,
the BS will get interference from the cooperative path and
cooperation will not be beneficial. For the particular case
where
p
p
s
 d
, i.e., the data sent by UT is successful
decoded at the RN, (17) reduces to (18). In practical systems
this can be achieved when the link UT-to-RN has high
quality.

Note that for this particular scenario, this RA scheme can
achieve a diversity order of 6 (4 by RN-to-BS link and 2 by
the direct one), and an antenna gain of approximately 6 dB.
IV.
DOWNLINK RELAY-ASSISTED SCHEMES
Similarly to the previous section, we analyze the two
relay-assisted schemes for downlink system, presented in
Fig. 2, using also EF and DF relay protocols. These schemes
are referred as M×L×1 RA EF and M×L×1 RA DF,
depending on the number of antennas at the relay node and
BS, L and M respectively. As for the uplink schemes, we
consider the cases with 1 and 2 antennas at the relay. The
formulation for single antenna RN was first derived in [21].
The main contribution of this section is to extend the
formulation for 2 antennas at the RN.
A.
Relay-Assisted Equalize-and-Forward
In the single-antenna relay-assisted scheme, the amplify-
and-forward protocol is equivalent to the RA EF protocol
proposed in [21]. For the relay case with 2 antennas, we
need to equalize and estimate the received data at the relay
and only after that retransmit the coded data. However, no
hard decision is made at the RN.
During the first phase the BS transmits at full power for
Ts of the time. Thus, the received signal at the UT, at instant
t , is given by

During the second phase, the RN comprises several tasks
over the received signals, which include: equalization plus
space-frequency
decoding,
power
normalization
and
forwarding. Since the mathematical formulation for RA EF
depends on the availability of a 2-antenna array at the relay
node, we treat these cases separately, deriving the final
decision variables for both schemes, with L=1 and L=2.

Relay-Assisted Decode-and-Forward
In this scheme, during the second phase, the relay first
demodulates and hard decodes the incoming signals before
forwarding it. Mathematical expressions for the estimated
symbols for schemes
with
L=1
and
L=2, are made
separately.

the decoding expressions for the relay received signals, in
the first phase, is expressed as (31) with the equalization
coefficients defined as (32). After that, the RN hard
decodes and then re-encodes the data and forwards it to
the UT. If the decoded data at the RNs is correct, the data
to be retransmitted by the RN antenna l, i.e.,
p

data

NUMERICAL RESULTS
In order to evaluate the performance of the presented
relay-assisted schemes we considered a typical pedestrian
scenario, based on WiMAX specifications. The main
simulation settings are summarized in Table II.
With the aim of having the same spectral efficiency
between both cooperative and non-cooperative schemes, we
used 2 different modulation and coding modes: for the
relay-assisted schemes we used QPSK and a CTC, with a

we used BPSK and a CTC with block a size of (3600,
1800). For both cases, the code rate was set to 1/2 and a
Max Log MAP algorithm with 8 iterations was used.
Concerning the MIMO model and for the uplink system,
we extended the ITU time model to space-time, assuming
that the distance between antenna elements is far apart
enough to assume LM independent channels, i.e, we assume
independent fading processes. We consider that the UT has
just one antenna, the BS has 2 receiving antennas (M =2)
and the relay can have either 1 or 2 antennas (L=1 or 2). We
further assume perfect channel state information at both RN
and UT and the overall transmitted power is normalized to
1. For the downlink system, we use spatial transmitter
correlation matrix with an average angle of departure (AoD)
of 50º, the standard deviation of AoD set to 8º, and a spatial
receiver matrix (at RN and UT when equipped with an
antenna array) with an average angle of arrival (AoA) of
67.5º, standard deviation of AoA set to 68º, and antenna
spacing

both

The results of the relay-assisted and non-cooperative
schemes are presented in terms of the average BER as
function of Eb/N0, where Eb is the received energy per bit

and N0/2 the bilateral power spectral density of the noise
added at the BS in the direct link. Since the aim is to
compare the performance using single or multiple antenna
relay in scenarios with different link qualities, we present
results considering different values of Eb/N0 for each links:
direct link Source-to-Destination (Eb/N0); Source-to-RN
(Eb/NR), and RN-to-Destination (Eb/N2), as shown in Table
IV. We define and focus our simulation efforts on three
scenarios, which will be referred to as scenarios I (all links
with similar quality), II (RN has a good connection to the
source) and III (RN have a good connection to the source
and destination). These scenarios definitions hold for UL
and DL communications as presented in Table III.
Relay
assignment algorithms were not considered in this work,
i.e., algorithms to select the best terminals to cooperate.
However, some relay assignment algorithms can be found in
[26].
We
compare
the
proposed
relay-assisted
schemes
against the
non-cooperative or co-located
uplink and
downlink systems. In the former, the non-cooperative
system is represented by the SISO and 1×M MRC point-to-
point communication systems, i.e., cellular systems with a
single antenna at the UT and a BS with M antennas, where
the signals of each antenna are MRC combined.
In the latter, the non-cooperative systems used as
reference are the 2×1 and 2×2 MRC SFBC Alamouti point-
to-point communication systems. Moreover, we compare the
single antenna relay-assisted schemes against the multiple
antenna ones. For the sake of simplicity, the numerical
results used for assessing the performance of the RA
schemes in the UL and DL communication will be presented
in two separate sections.

Uplink Relay-Assisted Schemes
In order to assess RA schemes in UL communication, we
consider the different scenarios presented in Table III. The
first one assumes that all links have the same quality
(scenario I), i.e., Eb/N0= Eb/NR= Eb/N2. In the second one, the
quality of the UT-to-RN link is made 10 dB higher than the
direct link, i.e., Eb/NR= Eb/N0+10dB. This second scenario is
more realistic, since the RN is assumed to be near the UT. In
practical cellular systems the cooperative mode is only
activated if an active UT can see an idle one with a high link
quality. In the third scenario, the quality of the UT-to-RN
and RN-to-BS links is made 10 dB higher than the direct
link, i.e., Eb/NR= Eb/N2=Eb/N0+10 dB.
Fig. 3 shows results for the case at which all links have
similar quality. It suggests that the systems whose relay is
equipped with an antenna array outperform the ones that use
single antenna relays. In fact, the existence of an antenna
array at the RN dramatically improves the UT-to-RN link,
because it turns this channel into 1×2 SIMO, which provide
both 2-order diversity and antenna gain of approximately
3dB. Also, Fig. 3 shows that 1×1×2 RA DF is not working
properly, since the information that is erroneously hard
decoded at the relay will be seen as interference at the BS
and will not improve the system behavior. In this scenario,
EF schemes are preferable, as the relay only takes a soft
decision over the incoming data and the hard-decision is left
for the BS (after combining both signals received from direct
and cooperative links).For a BER target of 10-4, the 1×2×2
RA EF scheme yields about 3.6 dB of increase in Eb/N0, over
the non cooperative 1×2 MRC system.
Fig. 4 shows the performance of cooperative schemes for
scenarios where the UT-to-RN link is significantly better
than
the
other
links.
We
consider
the
case
where
ER/N0=Eb/N0+10dB and Eb/N0=Eb2/N0. Since the UT-to-RN
link is improved with respect to the previous scenario, all RA
systems reveal relative performance improvements.

Figure 4. Performance comparison of RA schemes for the uplink: when
Eb/NR= Eb/N0+10dB (Scenario II).
In the 1×1×2 RA schemes, we observe that, for
increasingly higher Eb/N0 values (above 0 dB), 1×1×2 RA EF
outperforms 1×1×2 RA DF. The explanation for the 1×1×2
RA DF malfunction is the fact that the UT-to-RN SISO
channel is still not good enough to allow for proper hard
decoding at the RN. In the cases where the relay has a 2-
antenna array, the UT-to-RN link is not the performance
bottleneck anymore. The RA schemes are once again
improved by the use of 2 antennas at the relay and are now
better than non cooperative 1×2 MRC systems.
The performance of the 1×2×2 EF non cooperative is
similar to the one obtained with the 1×4 MRC systems.
Moreover, the 1×2×2 DF is even slightly better than 1×4
MRC in the studied range. This non cooperative system can
achieve a diversity order of 4 and an antenna gain of 6dB,
while the 1×2×2 DF can achieve a diversity order of 6 and an
antenna gain of 6 dB for the case where the data is
successfully decoded at RN. For a BER target of 10-4, 1×2×2
RA DF yields a gain of 6 dB and 0.7 dB with respect to non
cooperative 1×2 MRC and 1×4 MRC, respectively.
Fig. 5 summarizes results for the scenario when Eb/N2
and Eb/NR are equal to Eb/N0+10 dB (scenario III). It
evidences the fact that the proposed 1×2×2 RA schemes are
clearly better than the 1×1×2 RA ones, clearly showing the
benefit of using a 2-antenna array at the RN. It also confirms
that RA DF outperforms RA EF for low Eb/N0 values and the
opposite situation occurs as Eb/N0 increases. For a BER
target of 10-4, 1×2×2 RA schemes offer a gain of about 4 dB
with respect to non cooperative 1×4 MRC.

(scenario III).
Fig. 6 shows performance results for RA and non-
cooperative schemes for scenario I. From this figure we can
see that both RA schemes have a performance that is
between non cooperative 2×1 and 2×2 MRC SFBC systems.
For L=1, RA EF is preferable, whereas for L=2, RA DF is
better
and
also
outperforms
2×1
MRC
SFBC.
The
explanation for the DF improvement relates to its high
sensitivity to the cooperative link. As its reliability improves
(as happens when the BS-to-RN link becomes MIMO 2×2
instead of MISO 2×1), the hard-decoding process that takes
place at the relay is more effective and less likely to produce
decoding errors, which will be regarded as interference noise
at the UT side. RA DF with L=2 yields a performance
improvement greater than 6 dB with respect to SISO, for a
BER target of 10-4.
In Fig. 7 we show the schemes performance under the
definitions of scenario II. The choice of this scenario for
downlink derives from the fact that, in most real situations,
the
cooperative
link
has
higher
transmission
quality
conditions than the direct link. From this figure we can
observe that the performance of both RA schemes is
improved in comparison with the previous scenario and that
all schemes also outperform non cooperative 2×1 MRC
SFBC. This is due to the fact that in the case that the links
between BS and RNs are highly reliable, most information is
successfully detected at the RN.
We also observe that cooperative systems perform almost
the same. Note that in the RN-to-UT link, where most of the
errors occur, the schemes behave as a SISO for 1 relay
scheme and as a MISO for 2-antenna relay scheme, which
have similar performances for low SNRs.
It is interesting to observe that the cooperative schemes
outperform the co-located MIMO system, already expected
for this scenario.

Despite
almost
all
information
being
successfully
detected at the relay node, we particularly note that in the
reference MIMO case the channels of the two receiver
antennas are strongly correlated, while for the relay based
systems the channels between RN-to-UT and BS-to-UT links
are uncorrelated, increasing the diversity order and thus the
overall system performance. Note that for the downlink
scenario uncorrelated channels between both receiver and
transmitter antennas are not assumed.
Further performance improvements are verified when the
whole cooperative link is now 10 dB better than the direct
link, as is illustrated in Fig. 8, where the results for scenario
III are summed up.
In contrast with Fig. 7, Fig. 8 exhibits a slight
performance improvement of RA DF with respect to RA
EF. This is due to the fact that DF is decoding properly and

effectively eliminating the RN thermal noise, whereas the EF
scheme is being limited by the impact of that noise. We also
observe that, due to the antennas correlation and the high
quality of the cooperative links (BS-to-RN and RN-to-UT
are MIMO 2×L and L×1 channels, respectively), the gains of
RA systems with L=2 with respect to L=1 are smaller in
scenario III than in scenario I.
The aforementioned results suggest that the RA schemes
are severely limited by the relative quality of the cooperative
links, specially the BS-to-RN link. Thus, the success of the
cooperative schemes lies upon the choice of the relay in the
network. Ideally, it should be chosen so that the BS-to-RN
link is highly reliable.
V. CONCLUSION
We proposed and evaluated single and multiple antenna
relay-assisted schemes designed for both the UL and DL
OFDM based systems. For each configuration, two types of
relay-assisted protocols were analyzed: equalize and forward
and decode and forward. These schemes were evaluated
under realistic scenarios based on WIMAX specifications
and compared against the non-cooperative/co-located SISO,
MISO, SIMO and MIMO systems.
Concerning UL systems, results have shown that all the
proposed relay-assisted schemes have better performances
than the non-cooperative ones in the studied scenarios.
Furthermore, it was shown that RA DF schemes outperform
RA EF when Eb/N0 is low and the quality of the UT-to-RN
link is of good quality. Otherwise, RA EF based relays are
preferable.
For DL systems, results have also shown that all the
proposed relay-assisted schemes perform better than the non-
cooperative ones. In scenarios where all the links have
approximately the same quality the RA EF outperforms the
RA DF. However, when the BS-to-RN link has good quality
is preferable to implement RA DF instead. In short, the UL

and DL results have shown that it is possible to achieve
dramatic improvements in systems performance if the
proposed cooperative schemes are implemented, especially if
the relays are equipped with two-antenna arrays.
It is clear from the presented results that the proposed
cooperative schemes can be used to increase the coverage
and provide fairness, especially in scenarios where the
quality of the direct link is poor, as in urban environments
cluttered with buildings. Also, it is crucial to select the best
terminal to cooperate, i.e., the one with the higher source-
relay link quality in order to achieve better performances.
Thus, efficient algorithms to select the best terminal are
absolutely fundamental in practical cellular systems.
