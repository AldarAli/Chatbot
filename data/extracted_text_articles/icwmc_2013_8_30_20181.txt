Abstract— This paper deals with the effect of the presence of 
people sitting in an indoor Line-of-Sight (LOS) environment 
on a Ultra-Wideband (UWB) channel. To assess this, we 
selected four scenarios with no people, 5, 10, and 20 people in 
the room. We created two regions in the room, one near two 
side walls and the other in the center aisle. In each scenario, we 
measured the channel at 24 receiving points from a fixed 
transmitting point in the room. At each receiving point, the 
receiver was moved around to 9 local positions to obtain a local 
average. In this paper, the considered UWB channel 
parameters are a frequency-independent pathloss model and a 
frequency-dependent pathloss model. We find that the pathloss 
exponent for the region of the center aisle decreases as more 
people are in the room, while the pathloss exponent for the 
region near the side walls increases when there are more 
people in the room. We also study the effect of the frequency 
on the pathloss characteristic. The results suggest that the 
effect of the presence of people on UWB channels should be 
considered when assessing the performance of UWB systems.

 INTRODUCTION 
UWB systems are commonly defined as systems that 
have either more than 20% relative bandwidth or more than 
500MHz absolute bandwidth. It is well known for UWB 
systems to have many advantages, such as low complexity, a 
low cost, resistance to severe multipath fading, and the 
capability of a fine time resolution. There are numerous 
applications of UWB systems, such as personal area 
networks (PANs), sensor networks, geo-location sensors, and 
emergency communications. UWB systems using a 
relatively large bandwidth have to use low power so as not to 
cause interference in the neighboring communication 
systems. This feature makes UWB systems deployable in 
LOS and weak non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments in 
which the signal undergoes less attenuation. A classroom is 
an example of a LOS environment, and furniture (e.g., desks 
and chairs) as well as the people in the classroom are factors 
that change the UWB channel. In previous work, there were 
three types of channel variation by people: 1) the depth and 
duration of shadow fading due to pedestrians moving in the 
vicinity of such links [1-3], 2) the effect of the presence of 
humans on wireless personal area networks (WPANs) in 
which one end of the link is located either close to or on a 
person [4-7], and 3) the effect of the presence of a human on 
wireless body area networks (WBANs) in which both ends 
of the link are located either close to or on a person [8-10]. 
The above-mentioned papers deal with channel variation by 
only a person. Another recent paper [11] assesses the channel 
variation depending on how many seats are occupied by 
passengers in airplane, but this environment, which 
commonly involves metal material, is different from an 
indoor environment in a building. 
This paper addresses UWB channel variation depending 
on the presence of people sitting in an indoor LOS 
environment. From the measurement data, we obtain a 
frequency-independent pathloss model and a frequency-
dependent pathloss model. The paper introduces a 
frequency-dependent pathloss model, which includes the 
effect of the frequency on the pathloss characteristic. This 
can be useful for multiband orthogonal frequency-division 
multiplexing (MB-OFDM), as it divides the entire frequency 
band into several sub-bands with a bandwidth of 528 MHz. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the 
channel measurement system and the measurement scenario. 
In Section III, we describe the channel parameters, i.e., the 
frequency-independent pathloss and frequency-dependent 
pathloss. Finally, the paper is ended with a summary and 
conclusion in Section IV.

MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY 
A. Measurement System 
 
Figure 1.  Block diagram of the measurement system. 
In this paper, we measured the UWB channel using a 
frequency-domain channel sounding method for channel 
characterization with a vector network analyzer (VNA). The 
VNA (Agilent 8719ES [12]) transmits 801 discrete tones that 
are uniformly spaced from 3.1 to 4.7 GHz with a frequency 
interval of 2 MHz, requiring 400 ms for one sweep. This

frequency interval allows us to measure a multipath with a 
maximum excess delay of 500 ns, and the bandwidth of 1.6 
GHz gives a time resolution of less than 0.01 ns. The 
measurement system is described in Fig. 1. The same dipole 
antennas with a gain of 2 dBi are used on both the 
transmitting and receiving sides and are located on 1.5-m-
high tripods. A power amplifier (PA) with a gain of 25 dB 
and a low-noise amplifier (LNA) with a gain of 27 dB are 
used on the transmitting and receiving sides, respectively. To 
eliminate the effect of the antennas, the PA, the LNA and the 
cables, all measured data are calibrated in an anechoic 
chamber. 
B. Measurement Scenario 
To analyze the effect of the presence of people on a 
UWB channel, we use four scenarios: 1) a room with desks 
and chairs, 2) a room with desks, chairs and five people, 3) a 
room with desks, chairs and 10 people, 4) a room with desks, 
chairs and 20 people. We divide a room into two regions, the 
first near both side walls, Region A, and the second in the 
center aisle, Region B, as described in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, 
'Occupied' denotes people sit on the chair; otherwise this is 
'Unoccupied' and the signs of the desk and chair is given. All 
scenarios are carried out in the same room of which the wall 
material is commonly concrete and where there are two large 
glass windows on one side wall. The locations of the 
transmitting and receiving antennas are identical in all 
scenarios, as illustrated in Fig. 2. At each of 24 locations in 
the room for each scenario, the channel responses are 
measured at nine local points arranged in a 3x3 square grid, 
as shown in Fig. 2 (a). 100 frequency responses were 
collected at each local position. 
III. 
PATH LOSS MODEL 
A. Frequency-independent Pathloss Model 
In the conventional narrowband system, the pathloss 
model needs to calculate the link budget of the system and to 
minimize the interference in the neighboring systems. 
However, the UWB system is expected to require a pathloss 
model that accounts for the frequency component due to its 
much wider bandwidth than a conventional system, as 
discussed in Section III.B. First, in this section, we utilize the 
frequency-independent pathloss model using equation (1) to 
show the effect of the presence of people on the pathloss 
calculated with only the distance,

n  is computed using the minimum mean square error 
algorithm. Fig. 3 shows the path loss and their linear 
regression model in Region A and Region B. The parameters 
of the regression model are summarized in Table I.

Figure 3.  Path loss model of (a) Region A (Near wall) and (b) Region B 
(Center aisle) 
Table I shows the variations of the pathloss exponent 
with the different scenarios in Region A and Region B. 
Before analyzing the effect of people on the pathloss 
exponent, for two regions with no people, Region A in which 
the desks and chairs are located, has a smaller pathloss 
exponent than Region B, which corresponds to the center 
aisle. This difference is due to the desks and chairs. For 
Region A, corresponding to the area near both of the side 
walls, the pathloss exponent increases when there are more 
people in the room. However, it decreases for Region B in 
the middle of the room. This difference is caused by the 
difference in the main propagation mechanism of the 
received signal: In Region A, as the number of people 
increases, the number of positions in which the direct path is 
blocked increases. In addition, some reflected paths through 
both side walls and the ceiling are affected by the existing 
people, and some diffraction paths exist around them [14]. In 
contrast, in Region B, the direct path is not affected by 
people because there are LOS paths in all positions, but some 
reflected paths are blocked or attenuated by people. This 
different propagation mechanism results in different 
tendencies of the pathloss exponent in Region A and Region 
B. 
B. Frequency-dependent Pathloss Model 
In the conventional narrowband system, it is sufficient to 
represent the pathloss model in formula (1) in section A, but 
the UWB system requires the pathloss model considering the 
frequency dependency due to its wide bandwidth. For this 
reason, the frequency-dependent pathloss property has been 
discussed in many studies [15-19]. In this paper, we analyze 
the frequency-dependent pathloss property through the 
frequency-dependent 
pathloss 
model 
as 
introduced 
by Jinwon Choi et al. [15]. The frequency-dependent 
pathloss is expressed using the following modified

 is the frequency-dependent pathloss exponent.   
The other components are identical to those in (1). 
For UWB systems in particular, the MB-OFDM scheme 
proposes that the assigned frequency bands should be 
divided into sub-bands having bandwidths of 528 MHz [20]. 
  
Figure 4.  Twelve sub-bands with bandwidths of 500 MHz 
To design an efficient MB-OFDM system, the effect of 
the frequency on UWB signals with different frequency 
bands should be characterized. For this, we obtained a 
practical pathloss exponent formula to express the loss as a 
function of the frequency. The pathloss exponent variation 
with the frequency is characterized by taking the average of 
the pathloss exponent over a 500-MHz overlapped window

bandwidth whose center frequency is incremented from 3.35 
to 4.45 GHz in steps of 100 MHz, as shown in Fig. 4. In this 
model, the pathloss exponent averaged over each sub-band is 
denoted as 
k
ns  at the k th sub-band for k = 1, 2, . . . , 12. 
The variation of 
k
ns  is expressed as a function of the center 
frequency of each sub-band.

The measured 
k
ns ' values are illustrated in Fig. 5. In 
Region A near the side walls, 
k
ns ' values of the scenario 
with 5 people are similar to those of the scenario with no 
people, but 
k
ns increases in the scenarios with 10 and 20 
people. This is because the blocked multipath increases as 
more people are in the region. In Region B which is the 
center aisle of the room, 
k
ns ' values of the scenario with 5 
people are larger than those of the scenario with no people. 
This situation arises because the locations which are near to 
the transmitter have less blocked multipath by people, but 
the locations far from the transmitter have more blocked 
multipath. But 
k
ns ' values of the scenarios with 10 and 20 
people are smaller than the other scenarios because the 
difference of the path loss with the distance.  As shown in 
Fig. 5, 
k
ns increases with the center frequency of the sub-
band and it can be regressed as a linear  function. A linear 
regression model of the pathloss exponent with the 
frequency is obtained as follows:

                                 (3) 
where 
cf  is the center frequency of the sub-band (in 
gigahertz). 
The statistical representatives of 
k
ns 'values and the 
linear regression coefficients a  and b of (3) are shown in 
Table II. In both regions, the pathloss exponents increase as 
the frequency increases, but Region B shows faster growth 
of the pathloss exponents than Region A for the same 
scenario. These differences between Region A and Region B 
are the result of different main propagation mechanisms, of 
which the main difference is that the direct path is blocked 
by the people in Region A, whereas this is not the case in 
Region B. In addition, the slope of the pathloss exponents, 
a , increases as more people are in the room in the two 
regions. This means that the frequency response is affected 
by the presence of people in the room. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
To show how presence of people affects on a UWB 
channel in an indoor LOS environment, we selected four 
scenarios in the same room. The frequency-domain channel 
sounding method was used for channel characterization from 
3.1 to 4.7 GHz. From the results, the presence of people 
causes channel variation. For the frequency-independent 
pathloss model, the pathloss exponent for the region of the 
center aisle decreases as more people are in the room, while 
the pathloss exponent for the region near both side walls 
increases as the number of people in the room increases. For 
the frequency-dependent pathloss model that is useful for the

MB-OFMD scheme in which the entire frequency band is 
divided into several sub-bands with a bandwidth of 528 MHz, 
the pathloss exponent increases as the frequency increases, 
but the region of the center aisle in the room experiences 
faster growth than the region near both side walls. In 
summary, this paper shows that the presence of people 
substantially affects radio-wave propagation in an indoor 
LOS environment and should be considered when 
characterizing the performance of UWB systems. This 
finding will be helpful to those who want to validate the 
results of software simulations of radio-wave propagation in 
an indoor LOS environment.
