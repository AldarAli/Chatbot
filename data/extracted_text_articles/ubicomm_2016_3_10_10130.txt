Abstract-Context-aware applications are intended to facilitate 
the adaptation of services in a pervasive computing system. 
The semantic similarity between contexts and the application 
of a semantic similarity measure as a mechanism for service 
adaptation are topics that have yet to be thoroughly explored 
in the literature. The most developed semantic similarity 
measures are those applied to the ontological / taxonomic 
representation of the context. The Wu and Palmer semantic 
similarity measure is one of these measures that is 
characterized by its simplicity and high performance, but it 
can give inaccurate results because two concepts in the same 
hierarchy of an ontology may show a lower similarity than two 
concepts belonging to different hierarchies. In this work, we 
present a modification to improve the accuracy of this 
measure.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Semantic similarity measures are used in various fields 
with different types of applications. In pervasive computing, 
the application of these measures is linked to the concept of 
“context” and its impact on the adaptation of services 
provided to the user. Several studies apply these measures to 
service recommendation systems [10], in which context is 
represented by the user’s profile-related preferences. K. Ning  
and D. O'Sullivan [11] developed the similarity measure 
between ontological concepts of [3] by including context and 
allocating the weight of relations between concepts. 
Mention should be given to applications of similarity 
measures in other domains that can be used in the field of 
pervasive computing, such as data mining [8], or the research 
of Slimani et al. [19], which improved the semantic 
similarity measure of Z. Wu and M. Palmer [22] by taking 
into account the context of the measure.  
A pervasive computing system is designed to provide 
services to a user by minimizing his direct involvement, and 
to this end, the few studies applying semantic similarity 
measures have each given a particular definition to the 
context and its specific purpose. Examples include M. 
Kirsch-Pinheiro et al. [7], who proposed a dynamic 
adaptation of services to solve the problem of incomplete 
information in the process of choosing the adequate service 
in a particular context. Y. Benazzouz [1] used the same type 
of similarity measures for clustering data in order to 
determine the particular situations triggering a particular 
service. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 introduces some applications of the semantic 
similarity between contexts in pervasive computing, while 
Section 3 introduces the semantic similarity measures and 
context variables. In Section 4, semantic similarity measures 
applied to ontologies are shown and finally, in Section 5 we 
introduce our proposed modification of the Wu Palmer 
measure. The conclusion is presented in Section 6. 
II.  RELATED WORK 
The identification of the current context is defined by the 
contextual information related to the triggering of a service 
as well as a situation or “current context” in the set of current 
contextual information, similar to a known situation or 
context [1], with each identified situation being linked to one 
or more of the services to be provided. This identification 
forms the basis of the rule-based adaptation mechanism, 
which is a set of conditional rules with the form: if 
(contextual information I) then (service S).  
Identifying a context is based on data mining techniques. 
Once identified, semantic similarity measures are applied in 
order to compare it with contexts with known services. P.Y 
Gicquel [4] modeled the spatio-temporal context of a 
museum visitor in an ontological form, with the semantic 
similarity measures being used to recommend artwork 
similar to the interests of the user by comparing the 
properties of two concepts in the knowledge base. The 
similarity measure is a modified version of the similarity 
proposed by G. Pirró, and J. Euzenat [12], which combines 
the similarity calculation based on Tversky’s model with that 
of informational content.  
Y. Benazzouz [1] and F. Ramparany et al. [14] applied 
semantic similarity measures to group data and “pure” 
contexts based on the measures of [13] [23].

A similar approach was proposed by M. Kirsch-Pinheiro 
et al. [6] for the adaptation of content found in an intelligent 
device with a Pervasive Computing System (PCS). The 
authors used semantic similarity measures to assess the 
degree of matching between the predefined profiles of 
situations and the current context of the user with the aim of 
prioritizing them, using a graph-modeled context [25]. 
Semantic similarities between contexts in a PCS are thus 
based on the collection of one or several elements of 
contextual data that are relevant to one or several services. 
The description and semantic relations of these services are 
described in an ontological form, thus allowing the 
application of known semantic similarity measures. 
Many variations of the Wu and Palmer measure are 
present in the literature. We will mention the work of 
Slimani et al. [19] in which a penalty function is integrated in 
the measure to penalize concepts belonging to different 
hierarchies and the measures of C. Leacock, and M. 
Chodorow [8] and Y. Li et al. [9], where each trying to make 
adjustments on a particular aspect of the measure of Wu and 
Palmer. All these measures are difficult to implement and 
add an extra computational load to the original measure. 
 
III.    SEMANTIC SIMILARITY MEASURES AND 
CONTEXT VARIABLES 
The most frequently cited definition of context is that of 
A. K. Dey [2] who defines context in the following manner: 
“any information that can be used to characterize the 
situation of an entity (person, object or physical computing.” 
This definition clearly resembles that of B. Schilit et al. [20] 
since the context is conceived as a set of information 
collected from a user environment (person), physical 
environment (physical object), or system environment, with 
the purpose of data collection being the characterization of 
these environments. 
The data set that characterizes a context is collected from 
several sources of information, for example, physical sensors 
in the environment, intelligent devices, virtual sensors, 
Internet 
access, 
or 
even 
telecommunication 
service 
providers; this information is thus very heterogeneous. In 
accordance with several previous studies [5][10], The 
contextual information  can be categorized in 3 classes, as 
shown below:   
 
1. Quantitative variables are expressed in scalar or vector 
form (i.e., temperature, latitude, longitude, altitude). 
2. Quantifiable variables are expressed in qualitative or 
ordinal form (i.e., large, small, first, second).  
3. Categorical variables are not quantifiable. Variables of 
this type are described as a set of characteristics (e.g., 
standing, sitting). 
 
The global approach to measuring the similarity between 
contexts is primarily based on calculating local similarities 
between attributes or context variables [16]. The global 
similarity (1) can then be calculated based on these local 
similarities by weighting each attribute: 
𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑤, 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑜𝑙𝑑) =
                       
 ∑
𝑤𝑖
𝑛
𝑖=1
×𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎𝑖
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑤,𝑎𝑖
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑜𝑙𝑑)
∑
𝑤𝑖
𝑛
𝑖=1
                  (1) 
 
    where wi is the weight of the attribute ai, ai
Contextnew is 
the attribute i of the new context, and ai
Contextold is the 
attribute i of the existing context.  
IV.  NOTION OF SEMANTIC SIMILARITY 
In pervasive computing, where the notion of context 
plays a very important role, the semantic similarity measure 
is a tool to evaluate the resemblance between instances of a 
context. It allows services to be chosen and classified 
according to their relevance to a given query, and a user’s 
profile and preferences  
A.   Semantic similarity measures applied to ontologies 
The most developed semantic similarity measures in 
recent years, based on the ontological representation of 
knowledge and especially in its taxonomic form, were 
described by D. Sánchez et al. [17]. The authors categorised 
the semantic similarity measures on the counting of arcs, 
characteristics of concepts, and information content. 
Semantic similarity measures based on the counting of 
arcs were introduced by R. Rada et al. [13]. The basic notion 
for these measures was the fewer the number of arcs 
separating two concepts, the greater their similarity.  
Among the studies using this approach we find: 
 
 
Rada measure 
It is based on the fact that we can calculate the semantic 
similarity between two concepts in a hierarchical structure 
(ontology) with links, such as "is-a" by calculating the 
shortest path between these concepts. 
 
 
Wu and Palmer measure 
Several variants based on the Rada measure have been 
proposed to improve some aspects, such as Z. Wu, and M. 
Palmer [22] applied to an ontology O (Fig. 1), who 
considered the depth of ontology in the measure, because 
two concepts in lower levels of ontology are more specific 
and are more similar. This measure is given by: 
 
                           𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑊𝑃(𝑋, 𝑌) =
2×𝑁
𝑁1+𝑁2                             (2) 
 
where 𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑊𝑃 is Wu and Palmer similarity, N1 and N2 
are the number of arcs between the concepts X , Y and the 
ontology root R and N is the number of arcs between the 
LCS and the ontology root  R.  
We chose to modify the semantic similarity measure 
proposed by Z. Wu, and M. Palmer [22] (2) because it is 
simple to implement in a pervasive computing system where 
the context is modeled using an ontology and gives realistic 
similarity results.  Nevertheless, we modified the Wu and 
Palmer measure to eliminate an inherent disadvantage, in 
which two concepts in the same hierarchy may show a lower

Several other measures were subsequently introduced by 
C. Leacock, and M. Chodorow [8] and Y. Li et al. [9], as the 
authors attempted to make adjustments for a particular aspect 
of Wu and Palmer’s measure. 
 
Semantic similarity measures based on the characteristics 
of concepts derive from the similarity model of [21], in 
which two concepts are more similar if 1) they share more 
common 
characteristics 
and 
2) 
less 
non-common 
characteristics. However, the determination of the weighting 
parameters represents a major challenge for this type of 
measures. 
Finally, semantic similarity measures based on the 
information content of a common concept involving two 
concepts to be compared were first introduced by P. Resnik 
[15]. Their dependency on the design of the ontology and 
their lack of consideration for the context are some of their 
limitations.  
 
V.   MODIFIED WU AND PALMER SIMILARITY 
MEASURE  
As it was shown from the disadvantages of the Wu and 
Palmer semantic similarity measure, is that with this 
measurement one can obtain inaccurate results [16] [18] 
[19]. See the following example  (Fig. 2): 
 
𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑊𝑃(𝑐1, 𝑐2) =
2∗1
(1+4) = 0.4   (LCS=Person, N=1, N1=1, 
N2=4) 
𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑊𝑃(𝑐2, 𝑐3) =
2∗2
(4+3) = 0.57  (LCS=Employee,  N=2, 
N1=4, N2=3) 
 
It is clear that the semantic similarity measures applied to 
the UnivBench ontology (Ontology from the educational 
field, used to describe data on universities and their 
departments [19] [24], 𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑊𝑃(𝑐1, 𝑐2) < 𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑊𝑃(𝑐2, 𝑐3)  , 
despite the fact that the concepts c1 and c2 belong to the 
same hierarchy.

The following modification is proposed to remedy this 
disadvantage (Fig. 3): 
 
𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑐1, 𝑐2)
=
{
 
 
 
𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑊𝑃(𝑐1, 𝑐2) =

2𝑁
𝑁2 − 𝑁   𝑖𝑓 (𝑁1 = 𝑁)  𝑎𝑛𝑑 
2𝑁
𝑁1 − 𝑁  𝑖𝑓 (𝑁2 = 𝑁)  
 
  
1- Two concepts belong to different hierarchies if :  𝑁1 ≠
N 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑁2 ≠ N   𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑐1, 𝑐2) = 𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑊𝑃(𝑐1, 𝑐2) 
2- Two concepts belong to the same hierarchy if : N1=N or 
N2 =N,

Sim(Ci,Cj)> Sim(Ci,CC)  ∀ i,j=1,...n 
 
Where:  Ci,Cj are two concepts of the same hierarcy 
and  CC is a different hierarchy concept. 
 
1- If N1=N,   
2𝑁
𝑁2−𝑁 >
2𝑁
𝑁1+𝑁2 ↔ 𝑁2 − 𝑁 < 𝑁1 + 𝑁2 
2- If N2=N,   
2𝑁
𝑁1−𝑁 >
2𝑁
𝑁1+𝑁2 ↔ 𝑁1 − 𝑁 < 𝑁1 + 𝑁2 
 
The proposed modification meets the four criteria of 
similarity measures: non-negativity, identity, symmetry, and 
uniqueness, as defined below: 
1) non-negativity: Sim(A, B)≥0, 
2) identity : Sim (A, A) = Sim (B,B)=1 
3) symmetry: Sim (A, B) = Sim (B, A) 
4) uniqueness : Sim (A, B)=1 → A=B 
 
It is also clear that the semantic similarity between two 
concepts that belong to the same hierarchy is inversely 
proportional to the distance between these two concepts (N2-
N or N1-N) and is always greater than the semantic 
similarity between a concept of that hierarchy and another 
concept from another hierarchy.   It has all the advantages of 
the Wu and Palmer measure, namely its implementation 
simplicity and expressiveness. 
 
This modified Wu and Palmer measure applied to the 
example of Fig. 2 gives the following results: 
 
𝑆𝑖𝑚 (𝑐1, 𝑐2) =
2∗1
(4−1) = 0.66   
 (LCS=Person, N=1, N1=1, N2=4) 
𝑆𝑖𝑚 (𝑐2, 𝑐3) =
2∗2
(4+3) = 0.57  
 (LCS=Employee,  N=2, N1=4, N2=3)  
 
 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
 
The proposed modification of the Wu and Palmer 
semantic similarity measure retains all the benefits of this 
measure namely its implementation simplicity and power to 
give close similarities to the reality unlike several other 
changes proposed in the literature. It also meets the criteria 
of semantic similarity measures namely the non-negativity, 
the identity, the symmetry and uniqueness. Its advantage is 
the fact that all the concepts in the same hierarchy must be 
more similar to each other than other concepts of a different 
hierarchy and the similarity between the concepts in the 
same hierarchy also depends on the distance between these 
concepts.
