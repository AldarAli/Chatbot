Abstract—Social networks shape today’s Web with modern
communication capabilities and the ability to share heterogeneous
media. The various networks have different focuses and reach
different user groups so that users are often registered and active
on multiple networks to take advantage of the respective benefits.
In the ADRIAN project, we study threats to users on the Web,
focusing on the creation of Digital Twins of real users. Here, we
investigate the interlinking of user profiles on Social Networks
and derive insights that help us model Digital Twins. We discuss
the possibilities of using links to find additional profiles and assign
them to users. To do this, both the links and the information in the
profiles are examined. Only with high-quality data, it is possible
to warn users reliably about the dangers of disclosing data.

I. INTRODUCTION
People share their opinions and daily experiences on Online
Social Networks (OSNs) [1]. However, platforms differ in
terms of functionality and user experience. For this reason,
users share their posts on the same topic on different OSNs
(so-called cross-platform content sharing) [2]. On average, a
Web user is expected to have 7.5 social media accounts in
2022 [3]. Moreover, the various OSNs often have different
audiences, as well as different rules, therefore the posts are
adapted accordingly by the users, especially in language
style [2]. Significant differences were identified between the
platforms in terms of usage and posting behavior. For example,
Twitter is primarily used for information purposes, Twitter and
Instagram for social sharing, and Instagram for entertainment
purposes [4].
As a result, the available information of individual users
also differs from one social network to another. By interlinking
users across OSNs, very comprehensive user profiles can be
obtained so that, on the one hand, their entire profile and
behavior and, on the other hand, their preferences, activities,
and friend network can be reconstructed. In the area of
cybercrime the digital footprint can be used to track and
target such users and create Digital Twins (DTs) [5]. To
more effectively combat cyberbullying and identity theft, it
is necessary to develop preventive methods that uncover the
digital footprints, reveal the links across social media profiles,
and thus point out the associated individual exposures.
The research project ADRIAN (Authority-Dependent Risk
Identification and Analysis in online Networks) focuses on
the disclosure of information by individuals in Web 2.0 [5].
This is not a new topic, but has been researched for some
time now [6]. With the rise of modern OSNs, the threat
to the author through published information became more
concrete [7]. One form of this threat is doxing, which is
the collection and publication of information about a person.
Cyberbullying such as doxing is increasing [8], so automated
solutions are being worked on to detect and prevent it [9].
From the user’s point of view, it is often difficult to understand
that information distributed across different “places on the
Web” can, in combination, pose a threat. We attempt to
make this threat visible to users by merging the information
and modeling it as DT. However, merging information across
OSNs (i.e., profile interlinking) is a data processing challenge
and is the subject of current research [10].
In this short paper, we look at the underlying data available
for creating link profiles and initializing DTs. For this purpose,
we look at sample data from Twitter, YouTube, Facebook,
and Instagram and highlight challenges that arise from a
data science perspective. In this context, we focus on the
possibilities of reliable profile merging and data quality. The
structure of this paper is as follows: In Section II, related work
is outlined. Building on this, Section III presents our data set.
The results and implications for the ADRIAN research project
are discussed in Section IV before we conclude our work.
II. RELATED WORK
In the following, we review relevant work on profile inter-
linking (cf. Section II-A) and DTs (cf. Section II-B).
A. Profile Interlinking
The fundamental problem of profile interlinking is not new.
The problem of identity matching was first mentioned by
Newcombe in the late 1950s [11], long before the emergence
of Web 2.0 and Internet use by the general public. The
mathematical foundations for this followed ten years later by
Fellegi and Sunter [12]. Since then, research has addressed
this topic in the areas of databases, statistics, natural language
processing, and data mining [13], among others.
Users systematically adapt their profile to the platform-
specific standards with regard to language and wording in
the profile. In doing so, they distinguish between formal
and informal platforms, and even age- and gender-specific
differences can be observed [2]. Even posts from the same
18

PATTERNS 2022 : The Fourteenth International Conference on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

person on different OSNs have linguistic variations. This is
because users adapt their language style to the platform-
specific norms [2]. Not only in terms of language, but also in
terms of behavior, differences can be observed among users.
Recently, deep learning have also been applied to enable
profile interlinking. Xu et al. [10] proposed an anchor node
embedding method based on dual domain adaptation to learn
the anchor node representation considering the attributes,
topological structure and difference between domains. Users
in different OSNs are called anchor nodes, and edges between
users are called anchor links. In addition, they developed a
node adaptation method based on a domain adaptation by
backpropagation to learn the appropriate adaptation function
using a backpropagation neural network. Moreover, Wang et
al. [14] introduced a system called Fusion Embedding for
User Identification (FEUI), in which user-pair graphs were
interactively integrated by network structure, node attribute
information, and node label. Thereby, the FEUI framework
exploited a single-input and dual-output deep neural network
to represent complex correlation from different information
sources. Furthermore, Guo et al. [15] set up a deep neural
tensor network-based model to represent the interactions be-
tween entities and extract the relationships between users from
a higher dimension.
B. Digital Twin
The term DT is used in several areas of research and in
practice. Among others, it appears in mechanical engineering,
medicine, and computer science [16]. In artificial intelligence,
the term has gained broader usage. In general, “DTs can be
defined as (physical and/or virtual) machines or computer-
based models that are simulating, emulating, mirroring, or
‘twinning’ the life of a physical entity, which may be an
object, a process, a human, or a human-related feature” [16].
Here, we refer to the term as the digital representation of a
human being that is created by personal information available
on the Web [5]. The DT can never reflect the whole complexity
of a real person, but represents characteristics that, alone or
in combination with other characteristics, may pose a risk
to the real person. Modeling DTs is based on established
and freely available standards of the semantic web, such as
Schema.org and FOAF (Friend of a Friend). At the same time,
the overwhelming number of possible sources of information,
the quality of the data, and a multitude of contradictory data
make modeling challenging. However, studies [17] show that
a large amount of relevant information is knowingly and
unknowingly disclosed by users themselves [18].
III. LINK RECORD & PROFILE DATA
For the analysis of user behavior when posting cross-
platform links (cf. Section III-A), data from YouTube was
obtained as a starting point. In addition, Twitter data was
collected based on the links included in YouTube videos to
facilitate comparison. This allows us to determine which OSNs
are interlinked and which OSNs are suitable entry points for
data collection to create DTs. However, the relevance of the
OSNs also comes from the trackable information. Again, what
information can be found on multiple OSNs is crucial to ensure
data quality through data matching. We therefore compare the
different data points provided by the OSNs in Section III-B.
A. Link Record Analysis
The first goal is to analyze the collected data from YouTube
and Twitter (cf. Table I).

We have collected a total of 4,605 videos belonging to 2,841
channels. On average, a video contains 6.94 links, a tweet has
significantly fewer links than that, with 1.35 on average. The
Twitter dataset has significantly more links with 607.58 links
per user compared to 11.43 links per channel. This is obviously
due to the fact that we have more tweets per user than videos
per channel. Building on this, we turn to a deeper analysis of
the links to better understand the link structure. We focus here
on YouTube’s video descriptions, which allow users to insert
a large number of links.

Table II shows the domain distribution for links from
YouTube videos and tweets. Most of the links in the YouTube
videos lead to Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. This corre-
lates with the social media platforms relevant to our use case.
For this reason, we analyze these three OSNs in more detail.
In this context, it is important to determine how many links
to the various platforms are contained in all videos or per
channel.

As shown in Table III, Instagram has the most links within
embedded videos from YouTube in the descriptions, followed
by Twitter and Facebook. Also, for any number between 2
and 10 links, Instagram achieves the highest number. It is also
important to determine how many links overlap. A YouTube
channel that contains links to all three OSNs (cf. Figure 1) is
particularly relevant for creating a cross-platform profile.
B. Profile Data Overview
We divide the data into the following categories: Chan-
nel/User Identity, Channel/User Information, Content Infor-
mation, Links to Images or Videos, External Links, Loca-
tion Information, and Channel/User Metrics. The categories
represent different aspects of user profiles, which generally
require separate methods for correlation. The first category is
used to establish the identity of a person. For this purpose,
the name and username provided by the OSNs are used. The
channel title or username appears in all OSNs, while the real
name only appears on Instagram and Twitter. The challenge
here is to determine, first, whether the user has provided the
real name, and second, whether the username includes, for
example, the user’s first or last name. The next category is
mainly about textual information for the channel/user. From
the description of a profile in connection with the identity,
it can be derived whether it is a person or an organization.
In the case of persons, for example, the profession, interests,
or further external links are revealed. The next category
represents the content published by the channel or user. Tweets
and Facebook posts are textual content enriched with images
or videos, while YouTube and Instagram are images or videos
with a description. The tags can provide initial information
about the content and then form the basis for analyses over
a period of time that provide insights into the behavior of
the channel/user. The next two categories can provide very
strong evidence for correlation. Images are suitable for a
direct comparison of user profiles in different OSNs. The same
applies to external links, e.g., when the profiles link to each
other. Location data is available in all OSNs. Usually, except
for Twitter, only the country or city is given as text. In the case
of Twitter, many other types of representation are available,
such as latitude and longitude coordinates, a bounding box, or
even automatic extraction of locations from published content.
Finally, the reach of a channel/user is also important. The
number of followers or following can be used to determine
user activity. In the case of Twitter, followers can be retrieved
directly and direct connections between users can be analyzed.

IV. DISCUSSION
With limited resources and time, it is not possible for
attackers to monitor OSNs live or to compare all existing
profiles and keep the findings up to date. For this reason, in
the ADRIAN project, we rely on OSN users to leave digital
traces that point us to additional profiles and information that
can be used to create DTs. However, this is not a disadvantage,
but exactly the goal of the project. The point is not to create
DTs on a daily basis, but to show that traces on the Web make
this possible to some extent and enable threats like doxing. In
this short paper, we were interested in finding out what traces
can be found based on links and whether there are actually
enough links to jump from one user profile to another to gather
information and the intersections are significant.
Out of 2,841 profiles we identified using YouTube videos,
we were able to infer three other OSNs in 507 cases using the
links in the video descriptions (cf. Figure 1).

Fig. 1. Profile distribution across different OSNs
In 2,145 cases, we were able to find links to at least one
other profile. The link behaviour of users is already a first data
point used for identification. Beyond that, however, the large
amount of different information about the respective OSNs is
also worth mentioning (cf. Table IV). Not all information is
available on all OSNs and in the same format, but it is often
possible to merge them. In particular, user names, locations,
geospatial information, and names or parts of names are often
very good clues that help to interlink profiles.

Fig. 2. Different profiles of a user in OSNs
We would like to discuss this with a real-world example
– a random YouTube user who maintains multiple links in
his video descriptions (cf. Figure 2): The YouTube channel
contains a link to Facebook and Twitter profiles. For example,
on Facebook, we can determine whether the profile belongs to
an individual or an organization. This is important because the
creation of the DT initially focuses on individuals. Moreover,
the user is active on Twitter and posts, for example, sports
activities that lead directly to Strava, an OSN for tracking
physical activities that also includes social networking fea-
tures. Since the source of his tweets is Instagram, the user
also indicates another social media account that he uses.
On Instagram, he posts photos that contain a lot of private
information. As this example shows, the consolidation of the
different profiles in OSNs is of considerable importance for
the creation of a DT. On the one hand, it enables the validation
of information and, on the other hand, information gaps can be
closed. As the number of profiles in different OSNs increases,
it can be assumed that a higher overall quality of the DT can
be achieved.
V. CONCLUSION
We highlighted here that it is possible to infer from user
profiles to other profiles. We showed that YouTube is particu-
larly well suited as an entry portal for data acquisition, since it
is possible to include many links to other OSNs in descriptions
and this is also done regularly by users. In future work, we will
match information from different profiles to initialize DTs.
