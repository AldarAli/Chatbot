Abstract—With the increasing popularity of digital media and 
the ubiquitous availability of media editing software, 
innocuous multimedia are easily tampered for malicious 
purposes. Copy-move forgery is one important category of 
image forgery, in which a part of an image is duplicated, and 
substitutes another part of the same image at a different 
location. Therefore, it is necessary to have reliable and efficient 
methods to detect copy-move forgery for applications in law 
enforcement, forensics, etc. In this paper, based on multi-
resolution and multi-orientation curvelet transform, we 
propose a blind forensics approach for the detection of copy-
move forgery. In detail, the input image is segmented into 
overlapping blocks, and then curvelet transform is applied to 
each block. Statistics of curvelet sub-bands are extracted and 
sorted. Finally, duplicated blocks are identified by comparing 
their similarity. The proposed approach intends to reduce the 
complexity, improve the accuracy of the detection, and 
potentially resist shifting manipulation.

 INTRODUCTION 
With the development of high-definition acquisition 
equipment, large capacity storage device, and high speed 
network, multimedia applications have become increasingly 
popular in our daily life. At the same time, the imperceptible 
manipulation of digital media for malicious purpose has been 
simplified by the pervasive availability of media editing 
software. While we are undoubtedly exposed to huge volume 
of digital media, our traditional confidence in the integrity of 
these media has also been eroded since doctored pictures, 
video clips, and voices are appearing with a growing 
frequency and sophistication in mainstream media outlets, 
scientific journals, political campaigns, and courtrooms [1].  
In order to protect the integrity and reveal the 
manipulation of digital media, two types of countermeasures, 
proactive approach and reactive approach, are extensively 
investigated in previous studies. Proactive approach, 
including digital signature, watermarking, and etc., relies on 
preprocessing before distribution, which requires additional 
and shared information. However, there is no universally 
recognized standard, and the complexity greatly restricts its 
application. On the other hand, the reactive approach only 
requires digital media without any supplemental information. 
Due to the variety of manipulations and the diversity of 
individual characteristics of media, reactive approach usually 
faces difficulties at a larger scope, and suffers from 
complicated and time-consuming problems. 
Copy-move forgery is conducted by duplicating a part of 
targeted image and substituting another part of the same 
image to increase the occurrences of certain objects, or 
conceal an important region. As one of the major categories 
of image forgery, copy-move manipulation has its unique 
characteristic – the source and the destination of the 
duplicated parts are in the same image, so the noise patterns 
are similar to those from surrounding regions. This important 
characteristic invalids the application of methods for 
detecting other types of tampering, such as splicing, double 
compression, etc. [2, 3, 4, 5]. Figure 1 illustrates an example 
of copy-move forgery, where the original image (a) has four 
different original pictures and the tampered one (b) contains 
an additional picture.

In recent years, multiple detection methods have been 
proposed to address copy-move forgery. As one of the 
common analysis of image forensics, moment statistics has 
been successfully applied for detecting a variety of 
tampering, 
including 
splicing, 
double 
compression, 
steganography, and etc. Mahdian and Saic proposed blur-
invariant moments as features for detection [6]. Wang et al. 
presented first four Hu-moments for detection [7]. To reduce 
the dimensionality and improve efficiency, principal 
component analysis (PCA) [8] and singular value 
decomposition (SVD) [9] were applied to obtain reduced 
feature space. Features from other transform domains, such 
as discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [10] and Fourier-
Mellin transform (FMT) [11] were proposed as alternative 
detectors. 
To detect copy-move forgery, in this paper, we propose 
an approach based on multi-resolution and multi-orientation 
curvelet transform. Statistical features are extracted from 
curvelet sub-bands of overlapping blocks, and reduced

features are generated for similarity measure. Restrictive 
criteria are defined to suppress false-positive. Compared to 
exhaustive search in spatial domain, the proposed approach 
intends to reduce the complexity, improve the accuracy of 
the detection, and potentially resist shifting manipulation. 
The remainder of this paper is organized in this way: Section 
II introduces the curvelet transform, while Section III 
presents the proposed approach for detecting copy-move 
forgery. The experiments and results are described in Section 
IV. Conclusions are made in Section V.

INTRODUCTION TO CURVELET TRANSFORM 
The concept of wavelet transform was developed to 
represent both location and spatial frequency in 1D signal. 
For 2D signal, like digital image, curvelet transform provides 
directional information at different scales. The definition of 
curvelet transform is derived from 2D ridgelet transform at 
multiple scales. If an image is denoted as f(x,y), then the 
continuous ridgelet coefficients are described as [12]:

In curvelet transform, an input image is decomposed into 
a set of sub-bands, and each sub-band is then partitioned into 
several blocks for ridgelet analysis. The ridgelet transform is 
applied by combining the Radon transform and the 1-D 
wavelet transform [12]. To achieve higher level of 
efficiency, curvelet transform is usually implemented in the 
frequency domain.  
Figure 2 shows an overview of discrete curvelet 
transform, which generates a group of coefficient matrices in 
different scales and orientations [12].

Since 
complex 
ridgelet 
transform 
has 
higher 
computational complexity, fast discrete curvelet transform is 
implemented by wrapping of Fourier samples [13]. The 
pyramid structure of curvelet transform generates multiple 
orientations at various scales, which greatly benefits the 
identification of duplicated regions in both accuracy and 
robustness. Multi-directional decomposition provides a more 
precise approximation of the relation between adjacent 
orientations, and further supports the tolerance of rotation 
and shifting manipulations. Figure 3 shows the curvelet 
transform of original (a) and 90 degree rotated (b) images, 
which are generated by using Curvelab-2.1.2 [14]. It is 
clearly illustrated that all curvelet coefficients rotate with the 
rotation of the image simultaneously. Therefore, the pattern

of individual orientation is preserved, and the transitions of 
adjacent orientations remain. This important property leaves 
us clue to improve copy-move forgery detection. 
III. 
DETECTION METHOD 
Inspired by the observation of multi-directional curvelet 
transform, we design an analytical approach to detect 
duplicated regions based on statistics of curvelet coefficients.  
A. Structure of Approach 
The proposed approach consists of two phases. In the 
first phase, the overlapping blocks of a source image are 
sorted according to statistics of multiple curvelet sub-bands. 
The detailed procedure of the first phase is described in 
Figure 4.  
 
Figure 4.  The structure of the first phase. 
 
Figure 5.  The structure of the second phase. 
In the second phase, the number of candidate block pairs 
has been dramatically reduced, and the spatial distance 
between each pair of blocks is considered to reduce the false-
positive of similar blocks from same object or texture. 
Orientation related block features are extracted for pattern 
matching. 
Considering 
relation 
between 
adjacent 
orientations, the rotation or shifting effects could be 
minimized. The procedure of the second phase is illustrated 
in Figure 5. 
B. Curvelet Sub-Band Feature Extraction 
In order to extract statistical features, the gray scale 
image is segmented into a series of overlapping blocks. 
Then, we apply fast curvelet transform to individual blocks. 
Given a block B[i,j] of dimension N by N, the curvelet 
transform could be obtained from:

ψ

×
(3) 
According to the setting of block size N, each block is 
decomposed into 3 or 4 levels of scales. Different scales 
consist of various numbers of sub-bands. For 3 levels 
decomposition, the level 1, 2 and 3 include 1, 16, and 1 sub-
bands respectively. We define the sub-band of curvelet 
transform as ct, so the 3 levels curvelet coefficients are 
denoted as: 
(

        (4) 
In order to reduce the feature dimension and resist 
rotation manipulation, we compute the mean values of each 
sub-band, and sort those in same level of scale. In 3 levels 
decomposition, the level 1 and 3 contain only one sub-band, 
so there is no further processing. Level 2 consists of 16 sub-
bands, and the mean values of those are denoted as follows: 
{ }

obtained as

MCT will be used for lexicographic sorting. Then adjacent 
pairs of blocks in the rank could be provided to the second 
phase as candidate blocks. 
C. Adjacent Sub-band Transition 
In the rotation manipulation, all the sub-bands of 
ordinations shift at the same degree, thus the relation 
between adjacent sub-bands basically remains. Although the 
absolute values might vary, the distributions of transitions 
are very similar to the original ones regardless of shifting. 
Therefore, we obtain the differences between each adjacent 
pair of sub-bands in level 2 by:

blocks, we sort the difference vector and use the sorted 
vector as a rotation invariant descriptor of each candidate

block. For each similar pair of blocks, we compute Euclidean 
distance between their descriptors as similarity measure. For 
3 levels decomposition, the descriptor of level 2 sub-bands is 
used for similarity measure. The similarity between a pair of 
blocks p and q is obtained from:

Considering small distortion introduced by rotation, 
compression, or noise adding, a selected threshold is set to 
determine duplicated blocks. For different resolutions of 
image and different levels of decomposition, the threshold 
should be adjusted accordingly.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
The original 100 raw images were obtained in never 
compressed format used in our previous study of 
steganalysis [15]. We created copy-move forgery with 
various sizes of duplicated regions. Then the doctored 
images were compressed into JPEG format at quality factor 
of 90. Different parameter settings, which include block size 
and similarity threshold value, were tested to enhance the 
detection performance.   
Figure 6 illustrates two copy-move forgery images and 
their identified masks with the duplicated regions. Table I 
shows the statistics of the detection results, which indicates 
good detection accuracy and stable detection performance.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, based on multi-resolution and multi-
orientation curvelet transform, we presented an approach for 
detecting copy-move forgery of duplicated regions within 
same image. Curvelet sub-band features effectively represent 
properties of individual region, and efficiently identify 
duplicated blocks. Experimental results show that the 
proposed approach obtains good performance in detecting 
duplicated regions even after JPEG compression. Moreover, 
this approach also preserves good potential in identifying 
rotation and scale manipulations in addition to the basic 
copy-move forgery.
