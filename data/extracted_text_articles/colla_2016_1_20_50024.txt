Abstract—Retweeting is the main propagation mechanism in
microblog platform. The information often spreads wider
through some engine nodes. The paper proposes a new
engine node mining algorithm. Firstly, the cascade (session
tree) is built according to the retweeting of a microblog.
Secondly the pruning strategy is used according to the
timestamp. Thirdly, the cascade set (session forest) is
clustered by topical relevance. Finally, the engine node with
different precision can be extracted through computing the
integrated diffusion capacity. We conduct an experiment to
show the effective of the proposed algorithm.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the microblog platform has developed
rapidly; Sina microblog has more than 600 million users,
among which the number of monthly active users reached
129.1 million[1][2]. The microblog platform has many
characteristics
such
as
the
immediate
information
dissemination, the high propagation speed, the large
transmission range. Since a user can share feelings and
information at any time, so the information dissemination
of microblog has more incomparable advantages than that
of traditional media. The convenient way, however, makes
the information more difficult to track and control.
Many researchers have studied microblogs, such as the
microblog topic extraction and analysis, sentiment analysis,
information
retrieval
and
recommendation,
the
user
relationship mining, information dissemination evolution
and user influence analysis. The user influence analysis
mainly mines the different types of nodes from different
angles, such as high-impact nodes, active nodes, the nodes
with high confidence, the core nodes, the source nodes and
engines nodes, etc. Traditional researches of individual
influence
technologies
include
degree,
closeness,
betweenness, HITS, PageRank and extension methods.
These studies are generally for a snapshot of the network
topology, and no analysis of the specific topic. The other
microblog information dissemination process is often due
to the high influence of users and the rapid spread of
retweeting.The
basic
idea
is
that
these
nodes
will
disseminate information more widely[3][4]. This paper
proposes an engine node mining method based on topic.
Engine node is the node with larger diffusion force. The
mining method first builds a cascade according to the
retweeting of a microblog, after which the pruning strategy
is used according to the timestamp. The remainder of this
paper is structured as follows. In Section II we review the
related work
and
propose the
engine
node mining
algorithm. In Section III, we conduct an experiment on
real data. Section IV concludes the whole paper.
II. RELATED WORK
The microblog information dissemination mechanism
and retweeting in microblog are introduced in this section,
and then the engine node mining algorithm is proposed in
detail.
A.
Microblog Information Dissemination Mechanism
In
recent
years,
lots
of
information
diffusion
algorithms on social network have been proposed. Among
them, quite a number of algorithms extract information
network from a group of most influential nodes. Their
basic idea is that these nodes will make the information
disseminate
more
widely,
including
information
dissemination
prediction
by
analyzing
the
blog
information cascade [5][6].

Information dissemination speed on the microblog
platform is much faster than that on the blog platform, and
their propagate model are also different. Dabeer [7],
analyzed the factors affecting the microblog information
dissemination, including information characteristics and
the activity, response and out-degree of fans nodes. He
proposed a decision-making framework based on Markov
to measure the effectiveness of information dissemination.
Lehmann et al. [8] tracked the HashTag diffusion process
in Twitter network, and discovered that the epidemic
spread model played an important role. Yang et al. [9]
predicted the microblog information dissemination speed,
size and scope. Tsur et al. [10] employed a linear
regression model to predict the diffusion of information
within a given time according to the content and network
topology. Wang [11] provided a network-traffic based web
traffic computing technology for hot topic discovery,
incident
detection,
real-time
tracking
and
other
applications. The “fission” engine node mining algorithms
are rare, and these nodes which make the information
“Second outbreak” or even “N times outbreak” have a
great potential for application. On the one hand, grasping
the engine node is helpful for the information control. On
the other hand, seeking out the engine nodes is significant
in
the
field
of
advertising
and
other
commercial
applications.)
B.
Retweeting in microblog
Retweeting in microblog is the main object of data
mining, because it is the base of information dissemination,
influence analysis, sentiment analysis, topic discovery and
evolution etc. Therefore, the study of microblog retweeting
contributes to
the
understanding
of the
information
diffusion mechanism. Macskassy et al. [12] showed that
the majority of users do not necessarily retweet their
familiar topic. Pal and Counts [13] assessed and sorted the
user’s authority using the number of the original tweeting,
participated in the session and retweeting as primary index.
They used a Gaussian mixture model to calculate the
user’s influence. Since the computation complexity of the
model is very high, it is not suitable for traceability
research. In addition, the user influence assessment based
on information needs to deal with
many
insoluble
problems, such as languages, dialects, pictures and videos.
Therefore, we must use a simple way to get information as
accurate as possible, such as only the cascade and the
topology are used to study traceability research without
semantic mining, and only the positive and negative
emotions to assess the influence while ignoring the impact
of information in different formats.
The microblog information propagation model can be
described as G= (V, E), where V is a user and E is the
retweeting or comment relationships. An information
cascade is also known as a session tree, and the out-degree
of its initiator is 0, the others link to the initiator or
participators to form the information cascade through
retweeting, sharing or commenting etc. So the influence is
opposite to the direct edge. The information cascade may
contain loops, and there are following relationships in
microblog, so strictly speaking it is not a tree structure.
The timestamps have been concerned to pruning and
generating the cascade tree, and then the engine nodes can
be digged out through attribute measuring.
C.
The Engine node Mining Algorithm
Engine node mining algorithms are designed to extract
nodes with high information diffusion ability. Firstly, the
information is built according to the retweeting. Secondly
the pruning strategy is used according to the timestamp.
Thirdly, the cascade set is clustered by topical relevance.
Finally, the engine node with different precision can be
extracted through computing the integrated diffusion
capacity. Algorithm 1 shows the main steps.

The GeneratingStrategy and PruningStrategy are used to
amend
the
cascades
to
the
tree
structure.
The
PruningStrategy
will
delete
certain
retweeting
edges
according to the timestamp to remove the circle structure,
and the GeneratingStrategy will add certain retweeting
edges according to the timestamp and following factor to
form a larger cascade tree. The PruningStrategy is shown
in Figure 1.

GeneratingStrategy while t1>t2
Figure 1.
PruningStrategy Schematic Diagram
PruningStrategy eliminates loops based on the first
retweeting. User b forwards the same message from a and
c to form a loop, then the PruningStrategy is used
according to the time stamp, such as the edge b to c will
be cut off while t1<t2, and vice versa.
At the same time, GeneratingStrategy adds virtual
edges combine scattered information to cascade into
larger information cascade tree. The GeneratingStrategy
is shown in Figure 2.

GeneratingStrategy Schematic Diagram
The basic principle of GeneratingStrategy regards the
user who post the same message later than ones’ friends,
and then adds virtual edges. Specific steps are as
following: (1) for the root node, look for its friends with
the earliest timestamp within the cascade; (2) regarding
the root node as children of the friend with earliest
timestamp by adding virtual edges, which will increase
the size of the cascade; (3) if the GeneratingStrategy
brings in some loops, the PruningStrategy should be used.
Diffusion coefficient α in formula (1) is used to
measure the information diffusion force of the node. For
example, each node of information cascade tree in Figure
3. has a different diffusion coefficient.
(1)
Figure 3.
The diffusion coefficient of an information cascade tree
Where,
diffusion
coefficient
α
denotes
the
information diffusion force of node i, Oi is the outdegree
of node i, and Ni1 is the number of the one-hop non-leaf
of node i. The denominator of the diffusion coefficient is
equal to the number of the leaf nodes. For example, the
diffusion coefficient of node a, b and c respectively are
3/15, 3/13 and 10/11, and the node c is the maximum one.
So the diffusion coefficient can be applied to mine the
engine node.
III. EXPERIMENTS
The data set is taken from a well-known China
microblog site - Sina microblog, which was opened to the
public in Oct. 2009. It has nearly 600 million registered
users, among which nearly 100 million are daily active
users. Microblog information has strong timeliness, and
most topics will fade in a short time. The experiment data
take partial data in Oct. 2014(including 75,526,147 posts)
for analysis. The proposed algorithm is mainly to extract
the engine node in the information propagation.
A.
Cascade extraction
Cascade can be divided into two categories, namely
chain and star. The chain has only one node in each layer,
focusing on depth propagation, and the star has multiple
nodes in a layer, focusing on breadth propagation. In the
database, the frequency of the star is higher than that of the
chain under the same cascade size. According to the
definition of engine node, namely the “nuclear fission”
central node, these nodes are more likely to exist in the
star cascade. In fact, most of the cascades are between the
two cases, for the complex shape of chain and star. In
addition, due to the special nature of microblog retweeting,
it will not appear in the case of multiple initiators, namely
there is only one root in the topology. And a user can
forward the message many times, so there may be a loop
in a cascade. Figure 4 shows six basic high frequency
cascade topology structures, and it can be seen that most
cascades are too short to mine the engine node, so the
GeneratingStrategy
and
PruningStrategy
are
used
to
amend the cascades to the tree structure.
Figure 4.
The basic high frequency cascade topology structure
B. Engine node mining
To calculate the diffusion coefficient of all nodes in
all topics is not necessary, and the computation complexity
is high, so the algorithm analyzes the diffusion capacity of
nodes in a certain topic. The keyword matching algorithm
is used to extract the sub graph based on topic, and the
core idea is to put the cascades with same keywords into a
collection. The topic T has the keyword {k1, k2, k3}, and
GT is the cascade set with same keywords of topic T. The
GeneratingStrategy
and
PruningStrategy
are
used
to
amend the cascades to cascade sets based on topics, and

then the largest connected component is the main data for
analysis. The largest connected component may contain
more engine nodes. Assuming that the branch contains n
nodes, n-1 retweeting edges and m leaf nodes, according to
the definition of diffusion coefficient, we can get α= 0 on
the leaf nodes and α= 1 on the nodes whose one-hop nodes
are leaf nodes. Diffusion capacity of these two nodes is
limited. But the diffusion coefficient of other nodes in
cascade tree is between 0 and 1. Taking the “Lanxiang”
event with duration of 11 days and “persistent haze” event
with duration of 12 days as an example, in the topic-based
cascade, the diffusion capacity of three largest branches
are analyzed respectively. TABLE I shows the nodes
analysis of each cascade branch. A high engine node
percent means topology structure is closer to the star
topology.

The node diffusion coefficient in each branch is
calculated, and the nodes with α> 0.9 should be labeled as
engine node. The distribution is shown in Figure 5.The
red section represents the nodes size with α> 0.9, whose
proportion is small in each branch. The highest proportion
is 16% in No.4, and the lowest proportion is 10% in No.2.
It is obvious that the proportion of high coefficient
diffusion nodes is low. The result set is beneficial for the
network public opinion analysis, and the engine nodes are
very important for the advertising and other applications.
Figure 5.
The nodes with α > 0.9 in the diffusion nodes
Determining the engine node in different network
topology according to the nodes (α > 0.9) is unreasonable.
In order to control the number of engine nodes, our
experiment usually chooses a certain percentage. As there
are 8065 nodes in No.1 cascade branch, if 2% nodes are
required to be advertised, the engine node is 161 with α>
0.937, which is far less than the red section of 477 nodes
in Figure 5. Therefore, the engine node set is a variable
data
field
based
on
actual
demands.
By
manual
verification, the resulting engine node has many fans and
retweeting. They are always celebrities or grassroots
heroes.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
The paper proposes an algorithm to extract the
engine node with high information diffusion capacity on
the microblog data. The algorithm combines knowledge
of information cascade, the time factor, the topic factors
and graph theory, and the engine node set is variably
based on the actual demands. On one hand, these nodes
have reasonable size to be used for public opinion
analysis and early warning. On the other hand, the
advertising has broad prospects. Therefore the research of
marketing strategy based on engine nodes computation
will be our future work.
