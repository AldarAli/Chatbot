Abstract-There are many fuel quality standards introduced by 
national organizations and fuel producers. Usual techniques 
for measuring fuel parameters like viscosity, density, cetane 
index, fraction composition and flash point, require relatively 
complex and expensive laboratory equipment. On the fuel user 
side, fast and low cost sensing of useful state of biodiesel fuel is 
important. The main parameters of diesel fuel compatibility 
are: density and viscosity. Diesel fuel surface tension is one of 
the main properties for characterization of the quality of the 
fuel atomization process that affect fuel quality. The present 
paper concentrates on the construction of the sensor which 
enables the examination of the mentioned parameters in one 
arrangement. Results of development of a capillary photonic 
sensor working on the principle of multipoint monitoring of 
capillary rise of fuel in inclined capillary are presented. We 
discuss the principle of the sensor’s operation, the construction 
of the head, and the experimental results of testing biodiesel 
fuels for their parameters. We conclude that the proposed 
construction may be in future the base of low cost 
commercially marketable instruments. 
Keywords-biodiesel fuel; diesel fuel quality; surface tension 
of diesel fuel; multiparametric sensor; capillary sensor.  
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The paper consists of 5 sections. First section was the 
introduction where the diesel fuel, diesel engine properties as 
well as known sensors for diesel fuel testing were discussed 
and the aim of work is presented. Second section describes 
the proposed idea of multiparametric sensor for diesel fuel 
testing. Developed sensor construction presented in section 
three. In the section four the discussion of obtained results of 
characterized diesel fuels examination in developed sensor is 
presented. The method of fuels classification is proposed. 
The short conclusion is gathered in section five.  
Classical diesel fuels are made from distillated products 
of crude oil with addition of improvers. Biodiesel fuel is a 
mixture of classical diesel fuel and bio-components. 
One of the most important diesel fuel quality parameters 
is ignition quality. The ignition quality depends on the 
molecular composition of the fuel and is characterized by the 
ignition delay time, which is the time between the start of 
injection and the start of combustion. For standardization 
reasons, measurements of ignition quality of fuel (CN) have 
to be carried out in the Cooperative Fuel Research engine 
(CFR-5) or ignition quality tester (IQT™). The basic 
disadvantage of such approach to fuel quality measurements 
is the high cost of the measurement device and the 
complexity of the procedure.  
Nowadays, producers define the useful state of diesel fuel 
by several parameters: cetane number, density, and 
distillation parameters, kinematic viscosity. Other diesel fuel 
parameters characterize its operability: amount of carbon 
residue, water and sediment, cloud point, conductivity, 
oxidation stability, acidity, copper corrosion, flashpoint, 
lubricity, appearance, and color [1]. For the ordinary fuel 
user, such collection of parameters is often too complex. In 
this situation the user requires the simplest possible answer 
to a question: is that fuel useful for my engine?  
A. Diesel fuel and engine 
The challenge for diesel engine designers is to match the 
combustion chamber size with the diesel fuel injection 
characteristics [2]. The diesel fuel must be introduced into 
the combustion chamber, vaporize and react with oxygen at 
an assumed speed. The fuel properties that have greatest 
effect on injection process are viscosity, density and surface 
tension. If the injection is made at a constant pressure, the 
viscosity affects the fuel spray formation by limiting the 
speed of fuel flow. If the injection system is designed to

meter the volume of injected fuel, the density of fuel defines 
the fuel injected mass that is linked with the useable portion 
of energy. The surface tension is the one of main factors that 
describes the fuel tendency to form drops, known also as the 
fuel atomization process or spray forming.  
It was postulated that the surface tension of most liquid 
hydrocarbons is very similar. For example, for HydroCal 300 
- a hydrotreated naphthenic medium grade lubricant oil and 
IFO-120, an intermediate fuel oil, the measured surface 
tensions at 25°C are the same and equal 31.8 mN/m, while 
their viscosities differ significantly: 162mPa·for HydroCal 
and 487mPa for IFO-120 [3]. It should be noted that 
contemporary diesel fuels components are not only pure 
hydrocarbons. Present-day diesel fuel may include some 
biodiesel which is obtained from vegetal oils or the bio-mass, 
and other additives. These supplements may significantly 
change surface tension and other diesel fuel parameters [4].  
In a European study, it was observed that using the 
biodiesel fuel at low environment temperatures can lead to 
the degeneration of engine [5]. Therefore, production 
standards for biodiesel fuel were introduced: density at 15°C 
(ISO3675) and low-temperature fluidity for the transitional 
seasonal periods and winter (DIN EN 116). Important 
disadvantages of biodiesel fuel can be overcome by fuel 
processing. A new generation of biodiesel fuel can be made 
with bio-component isomerization or hydrogenation [6].  
It has been proven that surface tension is one of the most 
important of inhomogeneous fluid properties. It reflects the 
range of interactions in a fluid more directly than the bulk 
properties do [7]. The relationship between the surface 
tensions of different real vegetable oils and their fatty acid 
composition was postulated in [8]. Predicting the surface 
tension of biodiesel fuels from their fatty acid composition 
showed that the differences in surface tension between 
biodiesel types are not the only cause of the reported 
differences in engine tests [9]. 
There are few basic methods of surface tension 
measurements: the capillary rise method, the drop weight 
method, the ring or plate method, the maximum bubble 
pressure method, the method of analyzing the shape of the 
hanging liquid drop, and the dynamic methods [10]. 
The capillary rise method is the oldest method used for 
surface tension determination. For the surface tension 
measurement a capillary is dipped into the tested liquid. If 
the interaction forces of the liquid with the capillary walls 
are stronger than those between the liquid molecules, the 
liquid wets the walls and rises in the capillary to a defined 
level. If the cross-section area of the capillary is circular and 
its radius is sufficiently small, then the meniscus is 
semispherical. When the capillary is filled in the vertical 
position the surface tension may be calculated with following 
equation: 
 
γ ≅
1
2cos(θ) r ∙ g ∙ ൫h + r
3൯ ∙ (ρl − ρv), 
(1) 
where: γ is the surface tension, θ is the contact angle, r is the 
inner radius of capillary tube, g is the gravity constant, h is 
the height of meniscus, ρl is the density of liquids, and ρv is 
the density of vapor [11]. For standard temperatures, the 
density of liquid is much greater than of the density of vapor, 
therefore presence of the vapor phase is ignored. The contact 
angle may have different values in the static or dynamic 
situations. Such situations for a capillary being filled are 
presented in Figure 1.  
 
Figure 1.  Static and advancing contact angle in capillary flow. 
Since a film of oil remains on the inner surface of the 
capillary after the receding phase, representing complete 
wetting, the static contact angle was considered to be equal 
to 0° [12].  
Advancing contact angles between a glass slide and 
different hydrocarbon oils differ significantly depending on 
the temperature, the speed of liquid creep and the type of 
liquid hydrocarbon. For example, measured at 25°C and 
264µm/s the advancing angle of HydroCal 300 is 36° while 
of IFO-120 is 54° [3]. 
The simplest technique for measuring the capillary rise is 
using a ruler with an optical reading, but its automation 
requires a camera, a mechanical device as lift or a liquid 
injector coupled with an additional light source to improve 
the optical reading of the meniscus position.  
Because of its relative simplicity, the drop weight 
method, is one of the most common methods used for 
surface tension automated measurements. In this method 
drops formed at the tip of the glass capillary are weighted 
and counted. The pendant drop at the tip starts to detach 
when its weight reaches the value balancing the surface 
tension of the liquid. The advantage of the method is the 
possibility to measure surface tensions between liquids and 
other than optically transparent materials [13]. The 
disadvantage of this method is the necessity to calculate the 
corrections for the capillary tip parameters and the volume of 
the drop, which are characteristic of a given device. 
The ring method and the Wilhelmy plate method are 
similar. In these methods an object is moved perpendicularly 
into or out of the liquid. The plate is moved towards the 
surface until the meniscus connects with it, or the submerged 
ring is pulled out of the liquid. The additional force acting on 
the plate or ring due to its wetting by liquid is measured. 
In the maximum bubble pressure method an air or gas 
bubble is blown at constant rate through a capillary 
submerged in the tested liquid. The maximum measured

pressure that is required to insert the bubble of gas into the 
liquid may be used for surface tension determination. 
The shape analyzing methods of liquid drop is based on 
the effect of the liquid’s deformation caused by the 
gravitation force action. The surface area of a drop is 
proportional to its squared radius and the gravitational 
deformation depends on its volume, which is proportional to 
the third power of the radius [14]. 
One 
of 
dynamic 
methods 
for 
surface 
tension 
determination is based on the analysis of the shape of an 
oscillating liquid jet. The jet flows out from an elliptic orifice 
and therefore it oscillates. Mathematical analysis of such a 
jet was given for the first time by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. 
One can conclude from these considerations that the surface 
tension may directly affect fuel injection characteristics. 
B. Sensors for diesel fuel testing 
Nowadays, optical sensors are introduced into the fuel 
testing market. Some known optical sensors enable the 
examination of a set of fuel parameters, but the possibility of 
easy measurement comes with a high price of the devices 
[15]. On the other hand, some proposed multiparametric 
sensors may be low cost, but using them requires trained 
operating personnel. The possibility of diesel fuel quality 
testing using an optoelectronic set-up implementing a multi-
parametric method was shown in [16] [17]. 
II. IDEA OF MULTIPARAMETRIC SENSOR FOR DIESEL 
FUEL TESTING  
The idea of the sensor was inspired by the need to come 
up with a measurement method of a set of diesel fuel 
parameters in one system that would require the minimum of 
automated mechanical elements. The aimed at set of diesel 
fuel parameters includes: density, viscosity, surface tension 
and wetting represented by the contact angle between fuel 
and glass. Such a set of parameters may be observed using 
the classical capillary rise method (Figure 1) with three 
capillaries of different inner diameters. The data obtained in 
the measurement enable solving of a three equation system 
derived from (1). To obtain the additional viscosity 
measurement data one needs to measure the capillary rise 
speed. An increase of the liquid movement distance in the 
capillary to improve the precision of the measurement is 
possible by the inclination of the capillary. When capillary’s 
axis is inclined at the α angle to the horizontal, a liquid is 
drawn in by capillary forces according to equation (2).

inner radius of the capillary tube, g is the gravity constant, l 
is the length coordinate of meniscus at capillary axis, t is the 
time of measurement, α is the angle of inclination, ρl is the 
density of liquid, and η is its viscosity. Eq. 2 may be solved 
for the sensor application in two ways.  
The first solution is for local speed measurement at a set

SENSOR CONSTRUCTION 
A. Sensor head 
The sensor’s head consists of two functional blocks: the base 
and the optrode, shown on Figure 4.

The base is used to integrate the removable vessel for the 
examined liquid, the three optical paths of the source and the 
receiver, as well as for positioning the optrode at one of the 
three possible inclination angles. 
 
Figure 5.  Optical path geometry. 
 
Figure 6.  Ramp geometry 
The replaceable optrode is made from 15cm sections cut 
from the TSP 700-850 capillary from Polymicro Inc. In the 
optical paths large core optical fibers BFH 37-800 from 
Thorlabs were used. They are characterized by the core 
radius of 800µm and the hard clad outer diameter of 830µm, 
which is similar to the capillary’s outer diameter. The tips of 
the fibers are positioned at the distance of 1mm, where in the 
middle of the distance between the tips is positioned the 
capillary (Figure 5). The geometry of the optical path 
provides the value of ∆ls, required in equation (3). As the 
optical paths are the same, ∆ls=∆l1=∆l2=∆l3≈1.2mm, the 
experiment ramp geometry may be presented as in Figure 6. 
B. Optoelectronic signal processing 
As light source, three fiber coupled LEDs with three 
different emission wavelengths were used. The lowest-power 
LEDs were selected from Thorlabs list of high power 
devices: M490F2, blue with the 490 nm wavelength; 
M565F1, green/yellow - 565 nm wavelength; and M625F1, 
red - 625 nm wavelength. The diodes were connected to 
DC2100 controllers operating in the light modulation mode. 
The receiving fibers were inserted into the optoelectronic 
detection unit of our own design, presented previously in 
[18]. The optoelectronic unit was connected to a PC by an 
analog input of IOtech Personal daq 3000 data acquisition 
system. That system was also used to monitor the ambient 
temperature with two LM35DT circuits and control it with a 
radiant heater at 25°C.  
To operate the system, at the 0.1s sampling rate, a script 
in DasyLab 10 was designed [19]. The raw data collected for 
acetone is presented in shown on Figure 7. The initial values 
of signals for different paths are off set on Figure 7 for 
clarity of visualization. Moreover, the differences of the 
initial values do not matter, as the sensor operation is based 
on the differences of the measured time values. The time 
differences presented for acetone are in agreement with (3) 
∆t1<∆t2<∆t3, and time intervals are in agreement with (4) 
[(t2-t1)=0.9s]<[(t3-t2)=2.6s]. The t1 measurement value is 
uncertain, as the filling of the vessel may not be repeatable 
when a hand held pipetor is used.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In this section are presented the experimental procedure 
and the results of examination of different diesel and 
biodiesel fuels. 
A. Diesel and biodiesel fuels used for examination 
The operation of the sensor was examined with fuels that 
are mixtures prepared from components according to the 
European Union standards. The fuels were fresh or stored in 
room condition for two years. 
Base oil (BO) was prepared from crude oil distillation 
products. The petrodiesel (PD) was prepared with additives 
according to the EN-590 norm. Biodiesel fuels (BDx – x is 
the volume ratio of the biocomponent) were prepared from 
PD with addition of fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) and 
other additives according to the EU standard. The results of 
classical laboratory examination of prepared fuels are 
presented in Tab. 1. Density measurement accuracy was 
±2.0 kg/m3 while resolution was ±0.1 kg/m3. Viscosity 
measurement accuracy was ±1 %.

The fuels BO, BD30 BD50, BD70 and BD100 do not 
meet the standards of density, viscosity and FAME ratio, but 
meet the quality test of CN.  
 
Figure 8.  Viscosity and density of examined fresh fuels. ± 0.01 lb/ft3 
The densities and the viscosities of the examined fuels 
change almost monotonically with their content of FAMEs, 
as presented in Figure 8. 
B. Examination of biodiesel fuels using the developed 
sensor 
We examined at least 3 times samples of each fuel, and 
on the following figures we present representative 
measurement signals. The results of measurement of fresh 
PD presented in Figure 9 show that, contrary to acetone, the 
∆ts are measurable in each optical patch ∆t1=0.2s, ∆t2=0.3s, 
∆t3=0.7s, and that the time intervals (t2-t1)=6.5s and (t3-
t2)=13s are greater than for acetone, as fuel viscosity is much 
greater than that of acetone. 
 
Figure 9.   Measurement signals of fresh premium quality petrodiesel PD. 
From our experimental results we saw that fresh BO, 
BD70 and BD100 fuels differ significantly from other fuels 
when the t3-t2 parameter is considered, as is shown on 
Figure 10. The difference in (t3-t2) times from one fuel to 
another varies much greater than the fuels densities or 
viscosities. Calculated values of surface tension of fuels, 
with the assumption that contact angle is 0°, are presented in 
Figure 11. These results show that the values of surface 
tensions are probable and that the advancing contact angles 
differ significantly for the analyzed fuels.  
The next test performs the analysis of time interval 
values of fuels stored in a closed tank for two years in dark 
room conditions. The volumes of fuels seem to be constant, 
no presence of resins was observed, but the fuels seem to be 
more transparent. The results presented in Figure 12 in 
comparison to the results seen in Figure 10 indicate that the 
measured times intervals increase for stored fuels, but not 
monotonically.

The results of examination of time differences ∆t3 for 
fresh and stored fuels are presented in Figure 13. The 
summarized results of the experiments led us to the 
conclusion that ∆t3 time measurement data differences and 
t3-t2 time intervals relate more clearly to the acceptable 
quality fuels than the set of surface tension, contact angle, 
viscosity and density data. On the base of data collected in 
the experiments we can set the parameters determining the 
useful state of biodiesel fuel as the limits of the time 
intervals t3-t2 and the limits of time differences ∆t3. 
 
Figure 13.  Measured time differences ∆t3 for fresh and stored fuels. 
The analysis of data showed that in the presented method 
the useful state of diesel biodiesel fuel was not determined as 
precisely as presented in [20], but the construction of the 
head is much simpler and its use is easier. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
We proposed a sensor working on the principle of optical 
examination of diesel fuel with capillary rise. The presented 
device has been tested with ground truth data and it shows 
great promise.  
The analysis of the measured signals of diesel and 
biodiesel fuels showed the relationship of the times of fuel 
flow in the capillary with the useful state of diesel fuels. We 
showed that the information on useful state of diesel fuel 
could be presented in the form of recommended ranges of 
times of the fuel crossing sections of an inclined capillary 
during the capillary fill. It is not as accurate as other methods 
yet, but its intrinsic advantages of simplicity of design and 
cheap manufacture could make the technology viable in the 
near future.  
The future work will consist of integration of the LEDs 
and photodiodes in a common unit with the ramp.
