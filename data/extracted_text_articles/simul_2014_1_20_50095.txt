Abstract—This article aims to highlight the results of an
analysis of
the traffic
management
carried out
by
the
Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Palermo,
through traffic microsimulation model and mathematical
calculations. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of a
coordinated traffic light cycle in an area of Palermo with high
traffic flow. To achieve this, we used microsimulation for
planning traffic lights, we calculated mathematically the
phases in traffic lights and we made changes in the geometry of
the intersection. Although this approach is not new, we would
like to emphasize the importance of the use of microsimulation
models in urban planning of medium-size cities, such as
Palermo, characterized by a high rate of traffic congestion.
Keywords- microsimulation model; traffic lights.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Mobility is one of the most important elements of a
modern society [1] and traffic congestion has been causing
many critical problems [2].
Palermo, as many cities and towns in the world, is
subject to high traffic flows and their corresponding
consequences in terms of air pollution, congestion, and
decreased levels of safety.
A proper planning of traffic-light cycle could reduce this
kind of problems, improving vehicles flow. Some of the
advantages
of
intersection
traffic
lights
include:
homogeneous traffic flows, orderly movement of vehicular
currents,
reduction
of
the
frequency
of
accidents
[3][4][5][6].
The
traffic
lights
planning
cycle
is
a
task often
complicated by the number of traffic lights installed in the
urban road network: when the nearby traffic lights operate
independently, vehicles have a bumpy ride because of the
ongoing stops and starts, resulting in degraded performance
and increased pollution. To synchronize and coordinate
systems means to link them together so as to achieve a
constant rate in turning green [7]. It is therefore essential to
have a proper synchronization of intersections, whose
programming is most often preceded by simulations carried
out by the use of microsimulation models. These are a source
of immediate and continuous information on the traffic flow
[8][9][10][11].
Thanks to the development of innovative software,
models capable of representing the dynamic of flow
conditions, which actually occurs on road infrastructure,
have been created.
Depending on the level of aggregation, there are three
main types of models: macroscopic models, mesoscopic
models, and microscopic models.
In macroscopic models, traffic flow is defined by the
rules of conduct that are a function of the interaction of
vehicles with each other and with the infrastructure, and the
main variables that are taken into consideration are flows,
velocity and density [13]. In this type of model, the current
traffic as a whole is analyzed, and not the individual vehicles
in
the
network;
therefore,
these
models
are
called
"continuous". Mesoscopic models differ from macroscopic
models by the fact that they consider the current traffic by
dividing it into groups of vehicles, which can be, for
example, the platoons that move in response to a traffic light
stop. Microscopic models, or microsimulation models, differ
from the two first mentioned as the smallest unit analyzed is
represented by the single vehicle, which moves on the road
network and interacts with the other vehicles and with the
infrastructure, according to a series of parameters that
depend on instantaneous velocity, acceleration, drivers
behavior,
and
mutual
distances
between
the
vehicles
themselves [13]; these models are then "discrete".
In this paper, we present a microsimulation application
related to the area between piazza Don Bosco and piazza
Leoni in Palermo (Figure 11), classified in the urban traffic
plan as interdistrict roads because of the connection between
the city center with Mondello.
Using
microsimulation
models,
two
scenarios
are
analyzed:
•
The current scenario (with uncoordinated traffic lights
cycles);
•
The project scenario (with coordinated traffic light
cycles).
In the following section, we describe the current scenario
by providing an overview of the intersection arrangement.
We also describe the scheme used for the construction of the
microsimulation model: matrix origin/destination and the
other variables useful for the analysis (e.g., travel times,
traffic signal cycle times, etc.).
In the third section, the project scenario is described. In
this scenario, differently from the present scenario, the traffic
light synchronization is implemented, and we hypothesize a
change at the intersection of piazza Leoni. In addition, we
provide useful calculations for analysis scenario and in
comparison to the present scenario (e.g., saturation flux, load
index, equivalent courses, cycle traffic lights, etc.).

In the last section, we show the study results, indicating
in particular the benefits in terms of travel time.
II.
THE CURRENT SCENARIO
Palermo
is
the
capital
of
Sicily.
With
678,412
inhabitants, this city is one of the most congested in Europe,
with critical areas such as intersections, where there are
frequent traffic jams. Following an increase in demand for
transport, due to the high number of vehicles on the
infrastructure, there is a consequent deterioration of the
circulation. Therefore, a reorganization of the road network
is essential. The reasons for the increase in transport demand
are several, such as the increase in the number of cars and
the deficiencies is public transport. This leads to overloaded
road networks. It is, therefore, necessary to take action and
perform analysis to understand what interventions can
improve the transport.
To control vehicle movement in intersections, Palermo,
as any other city, uses traffic lights in order to minimize
interference between moving vehicles.
The area under consideration in this paper includes two
intersections in the city of Palermo, piazza Don Bosco and
piazza Leoni (Figure 12). This area is congested due to the
presence of sport centers in Viale del Fante (such as the
stadium, the swimming pool and the race course) and the
connection with Mondello; no less important is the presence
of numerous lorries that cross the two intersections from via
Imperatore Federico to reach highway A29 Palermo-Mazara
del Vallo.
The two studied intersections are located at a distance of
about 300 meters and a coordinated traffic lights system is
currently
absent:
the
two
traffic
light
cycles
are
uncoordinated for duration and stage numbers.
The traffic light cycle of piazza Don Bosco has three
phases articulated (Figures 1, 2 and 3) in 142 seconds (Table
I), while the current traffic-light cycle in piazza Leoni has
two phases (Figures 4 and 5) lasting a total of 86 seconds
(Table II).

From the survey of the traffic flow in each intersection,
which
was
done
in
December
2013
at
8:00/9:00,
13:00/14:00, 18:00/19:00, we were able to obtain the origin-
destination matrix of the whole network for each class of
traffic (cars, buses, motorcycles and heavy vehicles). In
addition to the vehicles, we have also considered pedestrian
flows.
The comparison between the measurements in different
bands showed that the traffic flows do not undergo
significant changes during the day and it is therefore justified
to use a fixed-cycle.
For the analysis through microsimulation models, we
consider the time slot 8:00/ 9:00 am.
The maximum traveling speed was estimated through a
survey with GPS in a car, carried out over a period of the day
with low traffic flows, with data logging interval of 5
seconds. The GPS survey was carried out along 24 routes,
connecting each source to each destination. We used a GPS
with accuracy of 5 meters and data storage interval equal to 1
second.
The collected data were processed with the aid of the
QuantumGIS [14]. Knowing the time of storage of each
point we obtain, by the difference, the travel time.
The travel times calculated thanks to the GPS survey
were
compared
to
the
minimum,
average
and
maximum time values obtained from the simulations,
verifying the condition (1).

PROJECT SCENARIO
The synchronization of the plant was carried out
considering as a priority the traffic coming from the access
of viale del Fante and that along the stretch between the two
junctions.
We decided to set up a three cycle phases in piazza Leoni
(Figures 6, 7 and 8), so we removed two traffic lights
currently
present
in
the
central
island
of
the
same
intersection. We retained only the traffic lights that control
the left-turn vehicles from viale del Fante, allowing thus in
one step the left turn for users coming from viale Diana and
via dell'Artigliere and preventing access from piazza Leoni.
The origin-destination matrix of the project scenario was
then modified with respect to the real scenario only with
respect to the vehicle coming from the intersection of Piazza
Don Bosco with destination via dell'Artigliere.
In the phase plane of piazza Don Bosco (Figures 9, 10
and 11), we considered a different sequence of the three
phases, giving the green light the same time to the current
traffic with similar index in both intersections.

It was also useful to add an additional lane to the crossing
of via Imperatore Federico, whereby the load index of the
lane group coming from access lanes in question has
decreased. This change was possible because via Di Giorgio
is large enough to accommodate two lanes, allowing for an
increased capacity of the arc in question.
Regarding the traffic lights of piazza Leoni, we adopted,
as
a
first
step,
the
crossing
from
viale
del
Fante,
synchronized with the first phase of piazza Don Bosco,
which involves crossing and turning from the access piazza
Leoni in order to get the green wave.
For the calculation of the traffic-light cycle, we identified
the groups of critical lanes and the respective load indices,
and we proceeded to the calculation of the minimum cycle.
Load indices, defined as the ratio between the flow rate
and the saturation flow, were calculated after determining
these two quantities.
The saturation flow was calculated using the relation
proposed from HCM (Highway Capacity Manual) [12] as in
(2).
ܨܵ=ܨܵ଴∗ܰ∗݂௕∗݂௧௣ ∗ ݂௜ ∗ ݂௣ ∗ ݂஻ ∗ ݂௔ ∗ ݂௨ ∗ ݂஽ ∗ ݂ௌ ∗
݂௉஽ ∗ ݂௉ௌ
(2)
where:
•ܨܵ଴ is saturation flux under optimal conditions;
•
N is the lanes number;
•
݂௕is coefficient of the lane width;
•
݂௧௣ is coefficient of heavy vehicles;
•
f୧ is slope coefficient;
•
݂௣ is social activities coefficient;
•
݂஻
is a coefficient that take into account the
presence of bus stops;
•
݂௔ is area coefficient;
•
݂௨ is lane use coefficient;
•
݂஽ is right turns coefficient;
•
݂ௌ is left turns coefficient;
•
݂௉஽e ݂௉ௌ are pedestrian coefficients.
The course equivalents have been deduced from the
values of different traffic flows for the four categories of
vehicles, by multiplying the coefficients relating to the type
in question. The coefficients are:
•
1 for passenger cars;
•
1.75 for heavy vehicles;
•
2.25 for buses;
•
2.5 tram;
•
0.33 for motorcycles;
•
0.2 for bicycles.
This way, we obtained all the load indices for each group
of lanes and, for the purposes of calculating the traffic-light
cycle, we considered the highest values for each of the three
phases, having determined the plane of the stages shown in
the previous figures.
The cycle (3) then applies:

where:
•
i is traffic-light phase;
•
P is total time waster;
•
TR is actual red light duration;
•
γi is equal load capacity index, with the highest
value in the i-th stage.
We calculated TR (4) for each of the three phases based
on the length of the trajectory of the restrictive vehicular
current:

where:
•ݐ௣௥ is perception and reaction time;
•
ܵ௙ is braking distance;
•
D is trajectory length;
•
d is average length of vehicles;
•ݒ௩ is speed vehicles.
The time yellow G is assumed to be equal to 4 seconds,
as in urban areas. The braking distance was calculated
considering the arrival rate imposed by the limits of the law.
We obtained a minimum cycle of 133 seconds. We
decided not to calculate the optimal cycle because it would
lead to even higher values. Then, deciding to adopt a three-
phase cycle of 133 seconds, we determined green times (5)
effective for each phase:
ܸܧ௜= ቀ
ொ೔
ிௌ೔ቁ ∗ܥ(5)
where:
•
Q is the incoming flow;
•
C is the entire cycle length
The time thus obtained are:
•
VE1 = 40 seconds;
•
VE2 = 42 seconds;
•
VE3 = 30 seconds.
The times for green (6) and red (7) were found using the
following two relations:
ܸ௜ = ܸܧ௜+ܲ௜−ܩ௜(6)
ܴ௜=ܥ−(ܸ௜+ܩ௜)(7)
Table III shows the schematic of the traffic-light cycle of
the project. As can be seen from the table, some maneuvers
are permitted in stages, not presenting points of conflict with
other simultaneous operations. Specifically, it is allowed to
turn right on Viale del Fante in the first and in the third
phase, as well as the right turn from via Imperatore Federico.
The crossing and turning right from the access of piazza Don
Bosco have been retained in the second and third stages.

Finally, we determined the offset time between the cycles
of the two intersections, so that the vehicles of the current
priority can continue beyond the first traffic lights avoiding
further stops. Knowing that the distance between the stop
lines of the current priority is equal to 350 meters, advising
the maintenance of a constant speed equal to 40 km/h, we
calculated an offset of 32 seconds, in this way we favored the
current flowing in the path from viale del Fante at the
intersection of piazza Don Bosco.
We completed the changes to the project network via
Cube Dynasim and we carried out simulations by collecting
data from Data Collector always placed in the same sections,
in order to make a comparison between the current situation
and that of the project. The data were compared for the
minimum,
average,
and
maximum
travel
time,
with
particular attention to the average time relative to both
scenarios.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
The
changes
made
to
the
current
scenario
were
geometric and logical, having changed the origin-destination
matrix, the distribution of the lanes, especially, the traffic-
light cycle. These variations have been applied on the
microsimulation models, in order to verify an improvement
in the conditions of the current outflow with propriety and
without having an excessive deterioration of the secondary
flows.
The geometric changes have therefore provided the
addition of a lane of accumulation for the crossing from via
Imperatore Federico, whose length has been set equal to 80
meters, with consequent removal of the area for stopping; the
elimination of left turn onto via dell'Artigliere for vehicles
coming from piazza Leoni.
When comparing the simulated times with the current
scenario, there was a reduction of throughput times for all
destinations with origin viale del Fante, via Imperatore
Federico, piazza Don Bosco, which are the paths along the
streets of interdistrict.
Variation Journey Times = (Time of Scenario Current /
Time of Project Scenario) -1
(8)
In particular, the paths via Imperatore Federico, via del
Fante, and via Sampolo (Table IV) we obtained, as in (8).
We also obtained a reduction in average travel times by 20%
and 10% to viale del Fante and via Di Giorgio, and via
Artigliere and via Diana by just over 7 %. This confirms that
coordination reduces the average travel times and, as you can
see, the largest decreases for access viale del Fante take
place for couples origin-destination connecting the two
intersections.
For paths with origin piazza Don Bosco, there were
reductions in the average travel time varying from 8 to 38% ,
with the major reduction happening for maneuvers and left
turn crossing into the intersection itself.
The greatest reduction was for the crossing of via
Imperatore Federico, where the addition of an extra lane
produced a reduction in the average travel time by 55 %,
from 134 seconds to just 60 seconds.

In order to demonstrate the utility of using a traffic-light
cycle coordinated by microsimulation to reduce the problem
of congestion in Palermo, we studied an alternative scenario
than the current one. In particular, we have changed the
distribution of the lanes and we have determined a traffic-
light cycle common to both intersections.
We have temporally spaced so that the traffic-light cycle
vehicles of current priority, surpassing the first stop line and
maintaining a constant predetermined speed, can continue
along the route without making further stops.
By performing the simulation scenario of the project we
have observed an improvement in terms of average travel
times along the routes identified as a priority, which leads us
to confirm the validity of the instrument microsimulation
which supports the design of alternative solutions.
