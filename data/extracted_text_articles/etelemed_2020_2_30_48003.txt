Abstract—Though increasing physical activity level is essential 
for health promotion, inpatients are known to experience a 
drop 
in 
physical 
activity. 
However, 
even 
short-term 
rehabilitation treatment is expected to improve Activities of 
Daily Living (ADL), but accompanying changes in physical 
activity levels are unknown. This study evaluated change over 
one week in the Barthel Index (BI) and physical activity level 
in 
inpatients 
undergoing 
rehabilitation 
treatment 
and 
investigated the correlations between variability in these 
factors. The BI and physical activity levels were measured 
twice with a one-week interval between measurements for eight 
inpatients undergoing rehabilitation treatment at Iwate 
Medical University Hospital, Japan. The number of steps and 
time spent walking increased significantly from the first 
measurement to the second. On the other hand, there was no 
significant difference in BI score between initial measurement 
and after one week. However, 4 out of 8 inpatients showed the 
BI improved, and there was no inpatient showed worsened BI. 
Also, there were no significant correlations between the BI 
score variability and variability in the number of steps or time 
spent walking. The results suggested that rehabilitation 
treatment improved ADL ability and increased physical 
activity level among inpatients, but that variability in these 
factors is not correlated. A future study with an increased 
sample size divided by medical conditions is necessary.

 INTRODUCTION 
The Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for 
Health published by the World Health Organization in 2010 
identified physical inactivity as the fourth leading risk factor 
for global mortality, and lack of activity is known to be 
involved in the recurrence or exacerbation of various 
illnesses [1]. Thus, increasing physical activity is essential 
for maintaining and promoting health (maintaining physical 
and cognitive functioning, preventing the development of 
new diseases, etc.) and prolonging lifespan [2][3]. 
The Japanese Association of Rehabilitation Medicine 
proposes that “rehabilitation treatment works to return 
function, overcome disability, and cultivate activity” [4]. In 
other words, providing rehabilitation treatment (physical 
therapy, occupational therapy, etc.) to patients with physical 
disabilities can improve physical functioning, Activities of 
Daily Living (ADL), and increase the quality of life. 
However, many inpatients were found to have low physical 
activity [5]. Therefore, even if the ADL temporarily improve 
during 
hospitalization 
for 
inpatients 
undergoing 
rehabilitation treatment and their physical activity does not 
simultaneously improve, patients may return to physical 
inactivity after discharge leading to decreased motor and 
cognitive functioning, falls, and the development or 
exacerbation of other illnesses. 
Generally, physical activity is evaluated using the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire or a similar 
survey or an activity monitor with an internal triaxial 
accelerometer [6][7]. Activity monitors are a particularly 
simple way to measure steps, activity calories, and activity 
type and are, therefore, used by many researchers and 
clinicians. The Barthel Index (BI) is one of the most 
common methods used in clinical settings to evaluate ADL.  
In Japan, it is both medically and financially optimal for 
acute phase hospitals to discharge or transfer patients as 
quickly as possible. In fact, the average hospital stay at our 
facility is less than two weeks; however, inpatient care may 
be continued for patients for whom intensive rehabilitation 
treatment is found to be effective. In this system, evaluating 
the short-term ADL and physical activity level is vital to 
determine the efficacy of rehabilitation treatment. Therefore, 
this study evaluated the changes over one week in the BI and 
physical activity level of inpatients undergoing rehabilitation 
treatment and investigated the correlations between these 
factors.  
In Section II, the method in this study is explained. The 
results are outlined and discussed in Section III. Conclusion 
and future work are described in Section IV.

METHODS 
A. Participants 
Participants were eight inpatients undergoing intensive 
rehabilitation treatment at Iwate Medical University 
Hospital, Japan. Table I presents the participants’ physical 
characteristics. The main causes of hospitalization were 
cerebral hemorrhage (n=2), surgery for osteoarthritis of the 
hip (n=3), surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee (n=2), or 
surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (n=1). All

participants underwent at least two hours of rehabilitation 
treatment daily, including at least one hour of both physical 
therapy and occupational therapy. The main exercise 
therapies conducted in physical and occupational therapy 
were muscle strengthening exercises, aerobic exercise, joint 
range of motion exercises, and ADL training. The Ethical 
Review Board of the Iwate Medical University approved 
this study. Participants signed a consent form after receiving 
an oral and written explanation of the research. 
B. Measurement 
Physical activity levels were measured for all 
participants using small activity monitors with internal 
triaxial accelerometers (KSN-200, KISSEI COMTEC) two 
times with an interval of one week between the 
measurements. Physical activity was measured continuously 
for twelve hours from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Activity 
monitors were placed on the anterior surface of the sternum, 
right thigh, left thigh, right shin, and left shin (Figure 1). 
Activity monitors were fixed in place with a transparent 
adhesive film to prevent chafing. The attending physical 
therapist evaluated the current BI on measurement days of 
physical activity. The number of steps, activity calories, and 
activity type as calculated from the activity monitor were 
used as indicators of physical activity level. Concerning 
activity type, the eleven activities configured in the activity 
monitor were classified into walking, standing, sitting, or 
lying down, and the duration was calculated for each. 
C. Statistical analysis 
Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. The 
differences in BI score, steps, activity calories and duration 
for each activity between the initial measurement and after 
one week was evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 
Also, correlations between the variability (the difference 
between initial measurement and measurement after one 
week) in physical activity and BI were analyzed by using the 
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. A p-value of less 
than 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was 
performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 
software, version 23.0, for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
IL).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Comparison of the BI, steps, and activity calories 
The steps increased significantly after one week 
compared to the initial measurement (P = .012). However, 
there was no significant difference after one week for BI 
score and activity calories (BI score: P = .063; activity 
calories: P = .208). Figure 2 shows a comparison of the BI, 
steps, and activity calories at the initial measurement and 
after one week. 
B. Comparison of activity durations 
Table II summarizes durations for each activity. 
Walking time increased significantly after one week 
compared to the initial measurement (P = .036). However, 
time spent standing, sitting, and lying down was not 
significantly different after one week (standing: P = .208; 
sitting: P = .779; lying down: P = .575). 
C. Correlation between BI variability and variability in 
steps and walking time 
There was no significant correlation between BI 
variability and variability in steps and walking time (Figure 
3).

for Barthel Index, steps, and activity calories. Values are mean ± standard 
deviation; *p < .05. 
 
This study found that both the number of steps and 
walking time increased over one week in inpatients 
undergoing intensive rehabilitation treatment. On the other 
hand, there was no significant difference in BI score 
between initial measurement and after one week. The best 
possible score of BI is 100 points, and all inpatients had got 
relatively high BI score at initial measurement. However, 4 
out of 8 inpatients showed the BI improved, and no 
inpatient who showed a worsened BI. Also, the p value of 
BI between initial measurement and after one week was 
.063 in spite of small sample size. Therefore, we assume 
that to increase sample size will significantly improves BI. 
Health Japan 21, a strategy for health promotion from the 
Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, proposed an 
increase in average steps per day. The National Health and

Index improvement. Values are mean ± standard deviation. 
 
Nutrition Survey conducted with community residents in 
2010 found that men aged 65 and older took an average of 
5628 steps/day while women aged 65 or older took 4585 
steps/day. Thus, an increase of approximately 1500 
steps/day is the goal for both men and women aged 65 or 
older [8]. Past research has found that inpatients are inactive 
[5], and although ADL ability improved and both steps and 
walking time increased over one week for inpatients in this 
study, BI variability and variability in steps and walking 
time were not correlated. This result suggests that improved 
ADL does not necessarily mean that the physical activity 
level will increase. In other words, rehabilitation treatment 
for inpatients should not focus solely on improving physical 
functioning and ADL, but must increase physical activity 
level for patients to lead a healthy and fulfilling life in the 
long-term after discharge. Specifically, besides medically 
controlling symptoms such as pain that inhibits physical 
activity, strengthening muscles and cardiopulmonary 
function, patient education, and environmental adjustments 
are essential approaches. Further, there are patients for 
whom ADL improves during hospitalization, but who 
become inactive after discharge, which leads to a decrease 
in ADL. Recognizing patients at risk for this and addressing 
it preemptively, is necessary. However, to the best of our 
knowledge, there are no studies that report such risk factors.

In our previous work, we presented a data collection system 
in which movements are analyzed using Google Firebase 
service and a wearable device equipped with a gyrosensor 
[9][10]. Popularizing this system will lead to big data, 
which could potentially establish evidence of many issues 
from physical activity levels during hospitalization and after 
discharge. Further, existing activity monitors require 
professional staff and time to put on and can interfere with 
inpatient tests and bathing. As such, we believe there is a 
demand for a device capable of easily measuring physical 
activity levels.  
This study has certain limitations. First, the number of 
subjects was relatively small. Second, physical activity was 
measured only once at each measurement, however, the 
reliability of data is unclear. Therefore, to further improve 
this study, it is important to measure physical activity 
several times a week for many patients who are divided 
according to their medical conditions. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we evaluated change over one week in BI 
and physical activity levels in inpatients undergoing 
rehabilitation treatment and investigated the correlations 
between variability in these factors. One week of inpatient 
intensive rehabilitation treatment increased both steps and 
walking time. However, BI variability and variability in steps 
and walking time were not correlated. A future study with an 
increased sample size divided by medical conditions is 
necessary.
