Abstract—There is already a large body of literature on the 
e-learning (electronically supported learning and teaching). 
However, the incentive to encourage university teachers to 
involve in e-learning is still need to be studied earnestly. 
This study aims to discover the incentive problems that 
hinder university teachers developing and using the 
e-learning systems. E-learning is promoted in most countries 
prosperously now. However, it is still hard to find schools 
that can use e-learning effectively in helping their teachers 
uses. Therefore, there are various perspectives of incentive 
that need to be studied. For example, what are the 
motivating factors that can encourage teachers to use this 
new method of teaching? What techniques can help teachers 
develop an e-learning system? What policies can facilitate 
the process of e-learning? Based on a pilot study, we employ 
a depth interview to find out the answers of the questions 
mentioned above. In general, it is not easy for teachers to 
implement e-learning courses by themselves. School 
administrators and governments need to set policies, build 
facilities, and find motivators to help teachers use e-learning 
techniques to improve their teaching methods, and hence 
help students learn in an easy and convenient way.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) 
established the open course ware (OCW) in 2001. All the 
courses in MIT can be accessed on the web for the public 
to learn free in 2010. This new initiative reflects MIT’s 
institutional commitment to disseminate knowledge across 
the globe. Nowadays, a growing number of universities 
promote e-learning. According to Elliott Masie’s (The 
Masie Center) definition, e-learning is the use of 
information and network technology (IT) to design, 
deliver, 
select, 
administer, 
and 
extend 
learning. 
Furthermore, Cisco Systems defines e-learning as 
“internet enabled learning, components can include 
content delivery in multiple formats, management of the 
learning experience, and a networked community of 
learners, content developers and experts. E-learning 
provides faster learning at reduced costs, increases access 
to learning, and clear accountability for all participants in 
the learning process.” In general, e-learning takes place 
over the internet rather than in a physical classroom. 
Moreover, some e-learning may combine a portion of 
traditional classroom teaching. The development of 
e-learning in higher education is now a hot topic for most 
of the universities. However, there are many problems that 
still hinder teachers to implement e-learning courses in 
their colleges. 
Despite the wealth of studies on technology and 
education, questions about the incentives for teachers to 
use e-learning remain unaddressed. In one much-cited 
research commentary, Alavi and Leidner call for increased 
research on technology-mediated learning (TML). They 
recommend that researchers explore “the explicit 
relationships among technology capabilities, instructional 
strategy, psychological processes, and contextual factors 
involved in learning” [1]. How to encourage the teachers 
to use the e-learning smartly is an urgent question. 
E-learning has also been usually included in the lists of 
school evaluation items. Therefore, school administrators 
believe that e-learning is a trend that can not be ignored. 
Currently, a lot of universities have distance-learning 
centers. However, only a few of them have successful 
e-learning programs. People may ask is it difficult to 
implement e-learning programs? We argue that it depends 
on how it is done. At first, let us consider the problems 
that hinder most colleges. Based on our pilot interview 
with several school administrators, e-learning is still 
focused on the few teachers who have the necessary 
computer skills to develop their own e-learning courses. 
For most teachers, this is a difficult process even though 
the IT is friendlier than ever. Secondly, although it seems

Survey of questionnaire: We invited several experts 
and designed such factors to generate motivation. We 
have also carried out a pilot test in a selected institute to 
testify its consistency and validity. However, the 
questionnaire response rate is only 21% in the pilot study. 
We use the in-depth interview in this study. Based on 
the result of the pilot study, we selected dozens of teachers 
to our non-structured in-depth interview. Moreover, we 
performed a semi-structured in-depth interview of chiefs 
from two colleges in the northern district of Taiwan. By 
doing so, we have a deep understanding of the relevant 
problems in developing and using e-learning system,  
 
IV. RESULTS 
In the in-depth interview, we aim to compare the 
survey of experienced and inexperienced as depicted in 
Table 1. The results from the questionnaire survey are: 
To those whom are experienced in e-learning, they still 
have doubt about the performance of e-learning. Both 
‘willingness’ and ‘role consciousness’ were ranked low 
even though teachers are capable of developing and using 
e-learning systems. They expect the outer payments much, 
additionally, they are willing to develop and use e-learning 
systems due to their self expectations. So the incentives 
required by experienced teachers are that they are given 
more self-direction and enhancements. 
To those whom are not experienced in e-learning, they 
also have doubts about its effectiveness. Due to the reason 
of 
‘willingness’, 
‘role 
consciousness’, 
and 
‘self-expectations’ being ranked low, these results show 
that they are not ready to develop and use e-learning 
systems. So the incentive needed by inexperienced 
teachers is the role of “helper”. That is they should be 
given encouragement and help but not only focusing on 
the financial incentives. In other words, through the 
various incentive mechanisms, if the teachers know their 
own limitations and abilities, then the development and 
use of e-learning systems may improve.

In the in-depth interview, we discuss each factor 
concerning by the teachers. Here, we discuss these factors 
divided into the following aspects. 
In policy aspect: The results show that the policy is 
very important in the development and use of e-learning 
systems. E-learning curricula can be successfully 
completed only with strong policy. Once the policy is 
determined, further coordination will become easier. Take 
one of the interviewed colleges for example. Its policy for 
the e-learning of all general curricula in the first two years 
of college is determined. Hence other factors like salary, 
work load and evaluation are also formed. The obvious 
effect is that almost all teachers are urged to develop and 
use e-learning systems. This is quite different from the 
past. 
In quality aspect: The results show that students 
benefit from those aspects such as schedules, times and 
ways of learning. Both complementary learning and 
enhancement learning are benefited. One of the 
interviewed 
colleges 
designed 
a 
new 
style 
of 
instruction—either style A (1/3 traditional instruction plus 
2/3 e-learning) or B (2/3 traditional instruction plus 1/3 
e-learning) depending on the information literacy of the 
teacher. 
In motivation aspect: The results show that possible 
incentives are as follows: (1) Salary: rewards are 
developing fee, bonus, or over-time pay, while penalties 
are in the form of over-time works. (2) Work load: the 
common style is to adjust the teaching style or reduce the 
teaching hours of those who developed the e-learning 
system. (3) e-learning techniques: assistants or some 
orientation training may aid the teachers’ willingness to 
develop and use e-learning systems. (4) Job: the 
accomplishment of the development of e-learning itself is 
a reinforcement of teaching. Some promotion may follow. 
(5) Rights or honor: more using rights or granting honor 
for those who develop and use e-learning systems would 
be a great encouragement. 
V. SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING E-LEARNING 
SYSTEM 
Current studies noted valuable suggestions from 
various perspectives: student perspective in the teacher–
student 
dynamics, 
teaching 
paradigm 
[10], 
and 
institutional environment [9], etc. This study echoes the 
84

requirements of information literacy [2, 4]. Based on this 
study and the experiences that we have accumulated in 
implementing e-learning systems at schools, some 
suggestions are listed below: 
1. Setting e-learning policies: In order to create 
appropriate policies to support e-learning systems, schools 
should have the policies to distinguish the differences 
between teachers who have developed learning courses 
and those who have not. For example, the differences 
could be seen as financial award, job security, recognition, 
and annual evaluation. 
2. Finding motivating factors: As we all know, 
someone is willing to do something that attracts him/her. 
Currently, most schools use financial means to motivate 
teachers. We can not deny that this is a motivating factor. 
However, it depends on how we use it. As we have 
mentioned, some colleges provide US $1,000 dollars as a 
cash award to motivate teachers. This is a one time cash 
award. However, there is another way that can provide a 
much more attractive reward for teachers. For example, 
when schools embrace e-learning as one of their teaching 
methods, this new technology can reduce their costs by 
lowering their teacher numbers. If the school can take part 
of the savings from every semester and give it to the 
teachers as their long term cash rewards, this will be a 
huge motivation for teachers to participate. Moreover, a 
lot of teachers are concerned about promotion. All 
teachers are climbing the ladder (from instructor, assistant 
professor, associate professor to professor). Therefore, 
there should be policies that can help these teachers climb 
higher. In general, there are many things that need to be 
done before teachers can really implement an e-learning 
system. Teachers, therefore, need to be motivated. 
3. Building e-learning facilities: Most schools fail to 
implement e-learning systems because they are short of 
the relevant facilities for teachers to use in a simple and 
convenient way. Currently, most schools provide 
e-learning systems that allow teachers to use their 
computer to record and edit their materials. It seems to be 
the right way to do it because every school uses the same 
method. However, this is also the reason that most schools 
have the same problems when implementing their 
e-learning systems. As mentioned above, if schools use 
this method, then only the teachers who have the required 
techniques can produce e-learning materials. Under this 
situation, e-learning courses will be restricted and fail. 
However, there is another method that can solve this 
problem. One college has built studio rooms to help 
teachers produce their e-learning courses. In these studio 
rooms, college provides the entire editing (Pre and Post 
authoring) services from the time teachers work in the 
studio until the courses are uploaded to the system. This 
kind of service gives every teacher the opportunity to 
produce their e-learning courses. When all teachers have 
the ability to produce their e-learning, it can increase the 
chance of the e-learning process. 
4. Providing training courses: Basically, when schools 
want to implement any program, relevant training is 
required for successful implementation of the program. 
For example, teachers need to know what specific skills, 
knowledge, and system requirements are needed. If 
schools do not have studio rooms to help teachers, then the 
training will focus on how to help teachers use their 
computers to put together e-learning courses. E-learning 
system is usually composed of two parts. One is to 
produce the courses; the other is to management the 
courses. Training classes should also include these two 
parts and beheld every semester since schools will have 
new teachers needing to be trained. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
 The development of an e-learning system is an 
important policy in Taiwan’s higher education. Most 
schools are trying to make it. However, most of schools 
are facing the problem that only a few of the teachers have 
the ability to produce e-learning courses resulting in the 
fact that the quality of these courses is not as good as 
expected. Therefore, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan 
(MOE) has urged universities to unite their resources 
(equipments, courses, techniques, etc.) and figure out a 
better solution for this situation. Much research and many 
projects have been conducted and focused on this area. 
Our research found that if schools want to implement an 
e-learning system, they need to give all the teachers the 
ability to produce e-learning courses. If schools just 
provide an e-learning system and expect teachers to 
automatically pick up the system, the miracle of e-learning 
will not bear fruit. Therefore, as far as schools are 
concerned, policies, facilities, training, and the motivating 
of teachers are the key issues for implementing the 
system.
