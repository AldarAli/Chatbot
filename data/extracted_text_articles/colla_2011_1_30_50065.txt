Abstract—Electronic Collaboration Systems support employees 
in communication, coordination and collaboration tasks to 
work together to a common purpose to achieve business 
benefit. However, the marketplace of E-Collaboration systems 
is multifaceted and is made up of various types of systems with 
differing emphasis. E-Collaboration systems may be well suited 
for 
communication 
tasks 
or 
coordination 
tasks 
(e.g., 
collaboration systems with focus on project management), but 
lack support of collaborative tasks – and vice versa. To identify 
the extent of the support of “real” collaboration of 
E-Collaboration systems, an analysis of collaboration features 
is applied to a number of E-Collaboration systems. Although 
we focus entirely on collaboration features and present results 
on a number of E-Collaboration systems with above-average 
collaboration emphasis, significant differences in extent and 
quality of collaboration support can be detected. 
Keywords-electronic collaboration; electronic collaboration 
systems; Enterprise 2.0; social software; social interaction 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Social software and social media, like Facebook, Xing, 
LinkedIn, Twitter, Flickr, Wikipedia and many more, are 
highly accepted in private use, and modern life became 
almost unthinkable without these tools – at least for the 
increasing communities of digital natives. The transfer of the 
highly accepted utilization of social software and social 
media from private use into companies is called Enterprise 
2.0. Besides using weblogs, wikis and social networks to 
communicate with customers, these emergent social software 
platforms are used within enterprises, or between enterprises 
and their partners or customers [1]. Software solutions we 
used to call groupware and Computer Supported Cooperative 
Work (CSCW) software for decades incorporated these tools 
and got a significant development stimulus. 
Team collaboration and willingness to share knowledge 
are 
increasingly 
claimed 
by 
companies 
as 
central 
requirements for their employees. Working in teams requires 
the ability to communicate, coordinate and cooperate. 
Employees have to share their individual knowledge and 
collectively manage the corporate knowledge. Team and 
community building activities and organizational measures 
affecting the social environment of the collaborating 
individuals can be supported by information systems 
supporting these collaborative tasks. Electronic collaboration 
systems (E-Collaboration systems) assist and support 
employees in different phases of social interaction within 
teams: 
communication, 
coordination, 
cooperation/ 
collaboration and networking. 
Complete E-Collaboration systems have to provide high-
quality support in all four phases of social interaction. The 
marketplace of E-Collaboration systems is multifaceted and 
is made up of various kinds of systems and tools with 
varying complexity. But do they really support all types of 
social interaction sufficiently? To be able to collaborate we 
have to be able to communicate and coordinate. Thus, 
communication and coordination features are actually 
preconditions of “real” collaboration. 
In this paper we want to figure out whether and how well 
E-Collaboration systems really support core collaboration 
features. We will examine typical E-Collaboration systems 
for their ability to support collaborative activities among 
users. A feature-based evaluation approach is presented that 
identifies the degree of coverage of typical collaboration 
requirements. Therefore we will focus only on features that 
support the phase collaboration of social interaction. 
Features 
enabling 
communication, 
coordination 
and 
connection/networking will not be covered in this paper and 
are taken for granted. 
In Section II we discuss the four types of social 
interaction and narrow down the term collaboration as the 
interaction type in focus. Section III briefly describes the 
marketplace of E-Collaboration systems we will analyze. 
The features of collaboration that are supported by 
E-Collaboration systems are introduced in Section IV. In 
Section V we present the results of evaluating a number of 
E-Collaboration systems whether they effectively support 
these features and discuss findings in Section VI. Section VII 
concludes this paper. 
II. 
TYPES OF SOCIAL INTERACTION IN ELECTRONIC 
COLLABORATION 
Riemer [2] describes E-Collaboration systems as 
“software for supporting communication, coordination and 
cooperation between people processes in groups”. Riemer’s 
definition is based on the basic types of social interaction 
that can be found in Computer Supported Cooperative Work 
(CSCW) systems and groupware: communication – 
coordination – cooperation [3]. In a similar way Cook [4] 
16

uses four primary functions to classify social software: 
communication – cooperation – collaboration – connection. 
Communication allows people to converse with others 
and exchange information with the help of synchronous (e.g., 
chat, conferencing tools) and asynchronous (email, weblog, 
microblogging) communication tools [2][4]. 
Coordination allows a temporal or issue-related matching 
and agreement on tasks and resources. Typical operations of 
coordination support team members in coordinating 
appointments, processes and tasks in projects, plus surveys 
and workflow management. 
Collaboration encourages people to work with each other 
on particular problems, with shared commitment and goals 
[4]. Collaborative activities involve working on some kind of 
content in a team. Creating and editing of the content can 
occur in an asynchronous or synchronous way. The content 
could, for example, comprise some kind of document or 
graphics, or collecting or creating information and ideas on a 
topic with the help of a wiki or a virtual whiteboard. Another 
kind of support for collaborative activities is provided by 
shared 
applications 
or 
shared 
desktops 
that 
offer 
synchronous 
working 
using 
the 
same 
applications 
simultaneously. Collaboration and cooperation use the 
services of communication and coordination. 
Connection refers to networking technologies that enable 
people to make connections with and between both content 
and other people [4]. Social networking is the most 
prevailing technology for connection, but there are also a 
number of enabling technologies like people profiling and 
people search. 
In terms of this work E-Collaboration systems are 
defined 
as 
software 
for 
supporting 
and 
enabling 
communication, coordination and collaboration between 
people in shared projects, processes and teams within 
organizations and for cross-organizational use (following 
Riemer [2]). Thus complete E-Collaboration systems have to 
support all four types of social interaction – the 4Cs: 
 
Communication 
 
Coordination 
 
Collaboration 
 
Connection 
 
Even though complete E-Collaboration systems have to 
support all of these types of social interaction, the focus of 
this paper is on the provision of features for the core 
collaboration activities. The reason for this emphasis on 
collaboration is that the evaluation of a number of 
E-Collaboration systems according to these 4C categories 
showed, that some systems provide a variety of coordination 
or communication features, but fall short when it comes to 
supporting real collaboration [5]. 
In a narrow definition to collaborate means to work with 
others on a non-routine cognitive task – that is, working 
together [6]. Enterprise collaboration is a working practice 
whereby individuals work together to a common purpose to 
achieve business benefit [7]. Electronic collaboration 
(e-collaboration) is operationally defined in [8] as 
collaboration using electronic technologies among different 
individuals to accomplish a common task. Working together 
in a collaborative way is identified by cooperation, shared 
commitment and common goals. Examples of collaboration 
are working together on shared objects, or conjointly 
creating and modifying electronic documents (synchronous 
or asynchronous) [2]. Therefore we perceive collaboration as 
a special case of ICT-based cooperation where the main 
criteria are a collective goal-oriented behavior and collective 
responsibility for the result that are subjectively experienced 
by the participants. This definition presupposes types of 
personal work organization that assume high autonomy and 
intrinsic motivation of the participants (i.e., team members). 
III. 
E-COLLABORATION MARKETPLACE 
The marketplace of E-Collaboration systems consists of 
various heterogeneous system classes. There exists a large 
variety of open source and commercially available tools for 
team cooperation and collaboration. Some tools were 
developed out of former project management or content 
management systems, others put an emphasis on supporting 
communication with conferencing tools or originate from 
groupware solutions. 
Several scientific and commercial market studies on 
E-Collaboration systems aim at structuring and organizing 
available software packages into system classes and 
categories and set up descriptive criteria, refer, e.g., to [2][9] 
[10][11][12]. 
According to our definition of E-Collaboration systems, 
only those systems will be part of a detailed analysis that 
support all four basic types of social interaction (full support 
or partial support per interaction process, but all types have 
to be supported). Applying this limitation means that the vast 
number of single function tools, e.g., all those wikis, 
weblogs, 
chats, 
video 
conferencing 
tools, 
project 
management tools, content management tools, tagging or 
bookmarking solutions, etc., that offer only a limited number 
of features according to their system class, but do not cover 
the entire spectrum of functions for team collaboration, are 
excluded from the evaluation.  
Based on a detailed market analysis in which we 
analyzed the functional range of candidates, we set up a list 
of about 50 tools to be included in our study. The entire 
evaluation process is described in [5]. 
IV. 
COLLABORATION FEATURES 
Based on a literature study (e.g., [2][13]), an analysis of 
various studies and reports on the evaluation of 
E-Collaboration systems, CSCW software and groupware 
tools [9][12][14][15], as well as a number of interviews with 
experts in the field of CSCW and electronic collaboration, a 
set of typical functionalities of E-Collaboration systems that 
especially support collaborative activities was identified 
(Table I). These core functionalities or features of electronic 
collaboration are arranged in six subgroups. They provide 
the basis of a feature-based analysis of a representative 
number of E-Collaboration systems presented in the next 
section. They cover features regarding shared content and 
document creation (asynchronous and synchronous) as a core 
functionality including supportive content management 
features as well as social software and connection.

Most of the activities in electronic collaboration involve 
creating or editing some kind of document jointly by several 
persons. E-Collaboration systems should thus offer features 
for asynchronous and even synchronous editing of 
documents. Concerning the asynchronous way of sharing 
documents or other kinds of files like multimedia content, 
the systems provide various kinds of libraries that support 
the collaborative editing of content by functionalities like 
check in/check out. The synchronous editing of documents 
allows for several team members to work on the same 
document at the same time. Thus, for synchronous 
collaboration the systems have to support functionalities for 
displaying who is editing which part of the document, 
highlighting the changes and locking parts of the document. 
Brainstorming and creating ideas together is supported by 
virtual whiteboards that can be edited simultaneously and 
often are complemented by some kind of chat or instant 
messaging system to communicate while collaborating. 
Versioning 
and 
access 
control 
are 
crucial 
for 
synchronous as well as asynchronous collaboration on 
documents or content. 
Another important aspect concerning the collaboration on 
documents is, whether files can only be up- and downloaded 
to the platform or whether it is possible to create various 
kinds of documents directly out of the shared workspace. 
Our evaluation distinguishes between text documents, 
spreadsheets as well as graphics and presentation.  Creating 
and editing documents out of the shared workspace explicitly 
focuses on documents and goes beyond just creating a 
webpage with the help of an online editor. 
The possibility to create and edit Microsoft Office 
documents within the workspace qualifies E-Collaboration 
systems for collaboration of standard teams as these are the 
prevailing 
document 
formats. 
Creating 
and 
editing 
documents within the shared workspace without having to 
up- and download the files, showed to be a significant 
feature for E-Collaboration systems to be integrated into 
daily 
work 
routines. 
Workspaces 
supporting 
this 
functionality have got higher chances to replace the desktop 
and to be used as the standard workplace that supports all 
daily 
collaborative 
working 
routines. 
Whereas 
E-Collaboration systems, that provide only up- and 
download of documents, risk being used as a repository for 
documents instead of supporting active collaboration. Such 
systems are often not used like a standard workplace, but the 
users enter the E-Collaboration system in order to get 
documents to be edited locally and afterwards the documents 
are stored within the platform again.  
Among the social software tools, wikis have turned out to 
be a very flexible and suitable tool for collecting and 
structuring ideas and information on a topic together in a 
team. With the help of weblogs, news can be published and 
commented or discussed by other users. Social tagging, 
social bookmarking and social cataloguing refer to 
organizing content conjointly and to provide information for 
the other team members in a structured way. Thus, team 
members should get easy access to the collected information 
on selected topics. 
Social presence provides information of the team 
members´ state and can reveal where people are, whether 
they are available for communication or concurrent content 
editing, and which is the best way to contact them. Thus, 
social presence serves as a basis for synchronous 
collaboration. Tracking refers to following the activities or 
tasks of other team members or the status of a document and 
thus provides transparency. Rating content is a very common 
feature for blog posts, but systems also provide rating for 
other kinds of content. The team can evaluate content 
together and thus gain a common understanding of the state 
of the art concerning a certain topic. 
Finally, a very important aspect of E-Collaboration is 
connection. Features for connecting people, but also for 
establishing a connection between content and the team 
members who create the content, are a distinguishing 
characteristic for systems that really support collaboration. 
These features comprise people profiling, people search, 
people tagging and the support of social networking. Profiles 
provide information about the team members, their expertise 
and contact details as well as their organizational integration. 
Profile sites, that also provide space for personal details, 
18

support social networking activities. For example, the 
connection between content and the people creating the 
content is achieved by showing a picture of the author next 
to the documents, comments, blog posts etc. of this person. 
Clicking on or moving over this picture provides the basic 
profile information of the author and also the contact details. 
Some E-Collaboration systems combine the brief profile 
with instant messaging and presence information. These 
features support searching for experts and easy locating of 
the right contact person even if the users do not know each 
other in person. 
In order to assess E-Collaboration products and to 
calculate an overall measurement of collaboration coverage 
we perform a value of benefit analysis. Each feature is 
assigned an individual weight (Table I) indicating 
dependencies and relevance in an overall weighted sum. 
Those weights refer to a standard scenario of team 
collaboration. In case of choosing an E-Collaboration system 
for a specific collaboration scenario these weights have to be 
adapted to the particular situation. 
V. 
EVALUATION OF E-COLLABORATION SYSTEMS 
The evaluation of E-Collaboration systems is based on the 
above described features (Table I) that were found to be 
relevant for providing an environment where electronic 
collaboration is supported at the best. Out of the list of 50 
systems 
that 
support 
communication, 
coordination, 
collaboration and connection, 10 were chosen to be analyzed 
with a focus on how well they are suited for core 
collaboration activities: 
 
Alfresco Share, Community v3.4.0 
 
Collanos Workplace 1.4.0.2 
 
Jive SBS 4.5 
 
Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 
 
Socialtext 4.0 
 
Liferay Portal, Community Edition v6.0.5 CE 
 
PBWorks, Basic Edition 
 
Huddle 
 
EGroupware, v1.4 
 
Simple Groupware, v0.701 
 
Table II presents the results of evaluating these 
E-Collaboration systems whether they implement the 
features introduced in Section IV. For the sake of simplicity 
each score in Table II is marked by  if it is implemented 
and  if it is not available. Of course an assessment based 
on Boolean decisions is not sufficient for a detailed analysis 
and will be replaced by a graduation of the scale (e.g., on a 
scale from 0 to 4) for a more finely grained evaluation.  
Alfresco provides very well supported and integrated 
document and content management features by offering all 
supporting functionalities that are needed in order to achieve 
efficient collaboration on documents in a team. With the help 
of activity feeds it is possible to track who added, edited or 
commented on which parts of the content. The social aspect 
is not the focus of Alfresco and thus there are no features for 
social networking activities.

Collanos offers a well integrated standard set of features 
for document management. The organization of not only 
documents, but all sorts of content in a folder structure, 
appears to be the dominating part of the system. However the 
synchronous editing of documents is not supported. In 
Collanos team members can be informed about changes or 
tasks via instant messages and the status of the team 
members is displayed in the workspace. Nevertheless, the 
support of social software features like wikis or blogs is 
somewhat limited. Looking at connection features, Collanos 
provides profiles of the team members, search for experts on 
certain topics and some social networking services. 
Jive´s strength is connection. It offers many features for 
building employee communities using social networking 
19

concepts. Personal information about authors can be found 
throughout the entire collaborative content environment. 
Jive is a technologically mature platform rated by Gartner 
[12] as one of the market leaders. 
Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 provides a wide 
range of features for content sharing and management. In 
combination with Microsoft Office 2010 the editing of any 
office document by several users at the same time is 
possible. While editing the document together, one can see 
which user is editing which part of the content. If two users 
try to edit the same piece of text, the user who started editing 
later gets a warning that this part of the document is 
currently edited by another user. In combination with the 
social presence feature, an image as well as contact details of 
the other user are displayed and it is possible to contact this 
user via instant messaging. Thus, SharePoint 2010 is the only 
E-Collaboration system that offers real integration of 
synchronous collaborative working on content. Another 
feature of SharePoint 2010 is that Microsoft Office 
documents can be created directly out of the shared 
workspace. While many platforms only support up- and 
download of documents but no editing on the platform, 
some, like Liferay, provide editing of Microsoft Office 
documents, which were initially uploaded to the platform. As 
all analyzed E-Collaboration systems are web-based, 
creating some wiki like webpage out of the workspace is 
offered by all systems. However, we wanted to focus on 
creating and editing various kinds of documents and not only 
web pages using an editor. Even though SharePoint 2010 
supports almost all features that were identified to be 
relevant for core collaboration, the effort to set up the system 
and integrate all functionalities must not be underestimated. 
Socialtext offers an intuitive user interface combined 
with a lot of functionality that is highly integrated into the 
features offered by the system. The main focus of Socialtext 
is on the social aspect by transparently connecting people 
with the corresponding content. It offers new features like 
microblogging via so called Socialtext signals, which also 
allows for following the colleagues´ activities like using 
Twitter. With the help of an activity stream it is possible to 
see what the other team members are doing at the moment, 
like the status on Facebook. Groups can be created for 
projects, functional groups or communities of interest. 
Liferay offers social tagging for web content, documents, 
messages, board topics etc. in order to organize and share 
content with other team members. Activities on, e.g., blogs, 
message boards, wikis can be tracked via a recent activity 
portlet on a Facebook-like activity wall. 
PBWorks allows for sharing activities and tasks via the 
personal profiles of the team members and to follow users to 
see what they are doing. PBWorks offers a smooth 
integration of comments, microblogs, messages and 
information on the authors with the content. The 
synchronous editing of pages is provided by inviting the 
users who are allowed to contribute via chat. Thus, it is 
possible to edit the content of pages together and 
communicate about the changes via instant messages. 
Huddle is a simple and easy to use E-Collaboration 
system that offers well supported content sharing and 
management with integration of Microsoft Office. The set-
up of Huddle is fast and easy, the user interface intuitive. 
Huddle can be recommended for small teams that want to 
start 
collaborating 
right 
away, 
having 
no 
special 
requirements. A shortcoming of Huddle are social aspects 
and features for connecting people and content.  
EGroupware supports many project management features 
and also offers special functionalities for software 
development projects. However, when it comes to the 
support of core collaboration EGroupware offers only parts 
of the crucial collaboration features. The social aspect is not 
a strength of EGroupware and the connection between 
content and people is not as transparent as in Liferay for 
example. Even though EGroupware seems to have been 
developed for the collaboration in software development 
projects, it is easy to use and provides some other 
collaborative features apart from project management. 
Simple Groupware is another open source groupware 
and 
content 
management 
software 
with 
distinct 
collaboration features. Simple Groupware provides many 
features for asynchronous content handling, including 
content creation and editing within the workspace. Content 
can be collaboratively managed in enterprise, project and 
personal spaces. However, Simple Groupware lacks some 
social 
software 
elements 
(especially 
tagging) 
and 
networking features and has shortcomings in usability. 
VI. 
DISCUSSION 
The presented results in Table II are derived from a 
number of E-Collaboration systems with above-average 
collaboration emphasis. However, significant differences in 
extent and quality of collaboration support can be detected.  
As Table II shows, most E-Collaboration systems support 
collaboratively creating and managing content (especially 
documents or text, tags, bookmarks, people) in an 
asynchronous way. Asynchronous document handling for 
different kinds of documents – including versioning, check-
in/check out, etc. – is well supported by all products (without 
going into details on the grade and quality of the 
implementation). 
However, synchronous features, i.e. synchronous real-
time editing, is provided only in rare cases, although 
nameable authors especially in the CSCW community regard 
synchronous functionality or concurrency as core aspects of 
electronic 
collaboration 
[13][16]. 
Only 
one 
system 
(Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010) provides real-time 
synchronous editing facilities in certain setups. Another 
product offers a virtual whiteboard (PBWorks), but the 
others do not include synchronous editing at all. 
E-Collaboration systems have benefited a lot due to the 
widespread use of social software and gained significant 
momentum throughout the last years. They introduce new 
options and functions to electronic collaboration and help to

distinguish E-Collaboration systems from related CSCW 
systems and groupware. Modern E-Collaboration systems 
include typical elements of social software, like wiki, 
weblog, social tagging and social bookmarking, and these 
elements can be found in many E-Collaboration products. 
Nevertheless, significant differences can be identified in the 
utilization of social software elements. 8 out of 10 
E-Collaboration systems implement a wiki, but only 5 
systems include a weblog. Social tagging is provided by 5 
E-Collaboration systems and social bookmarking is offered 
only by 4 out of 10 systems. Remark: These numbers are not 
representative for the entire group of E-Collaboration 
systems as defined in Section III and a percentage of social 
software utilization cannot be derived from these numbers. 
Social presence and connectivity features have been 
included in the evaluation, although they actually make up a 
separate type of social interaction according to the 4Cs 
model (derived from the classical 3Cs of CSCW, extended 
by Connection), as they are highly important for modern E-
Collaboration approaches. The reviewed systems provide 
sufficient support of connection features: 9 out of 10 systems 
possess social presence functionality and all offer personal 
profiles and people pages. Complex social networking 
services, as they are well-known from specialized social 
networking sites, are provided by 6 of 10 products. People 
tagging features are offered only by 4 products. 
Substantial differences can be found in creating 
documents out of the shared workspace. Only a small 
number, 3 respectively 5 E-Collaboration systems offer this 
functionality for multiple kinds of documents (i.e., files) 
besides creating integrated, web page-based content. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We can identify quite differing degrees of collaboration 
support among the reviewed E-Collaboration systems. All 
reviewed products offer considerable support of core 
collaboration functionality. However, the focus of the  
systems is on asynchronous collaboration and the 
E-Collaboration systems marketplace lacks support of 
synchronous collaboration tasks in teams – notably 
synchronous real-time editing tools. To cover the entire 
spectrum of possible needs in E-Collaboration (i.e., core 
collaboration requirements) more options for synchronous 
cooperation should be provided. The evaluation of the 
reviewed systems educes that several systems might benefit 
by more complete offerings of social software technologies. 
The presented features are used to compare E-
Collaboration systems according to their true coverage of 
collaboration activities in a standard team collaboration 
scenario. These features and corresponding weights can be 
used as a basis of decision-making when selecting an E-
Collaboration system but have to be refined for a specific 
collaboration situation. The results presented in Section V 
and VI can be broken down to provide more precise results. 
The evaluation in Table II included only ratings on a binary 
scale based on Boolean values (implemented  or not ). 
Future work will provide more detailed ratings on a scale of 
0 to 4 and the accumulated criteria presented in Table II will 
be specified in more detail to be able to differentiate between 
products. Due to space restrictions we presented the 
evaluation of only 10 products of the 50 identified complete 
E-Collaboration systems.
