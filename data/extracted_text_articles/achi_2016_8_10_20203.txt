Abstract— This paper presents the design, development and 
evaluation of the interfaces of the CAPTAIN MEMO memory 
prosthesis that target mainly individuals who are showing 
early/moderate signs of Alzheimer’s disease. One of the major 
barriers that hinder Alzheimer’s disease patients using 
software application is its complex interface. In this paper, we 
present a set of design guidelines for accommodating changes 
which accompany the Alzheimer’s disease. Based on these 
guidelines, we develop the interfaces of the CAPTAIN MEMO 
memory prosthesis that meet the special needs of Alzheimer’s 
disease patients. The developed interfaces present the 
advantages that they are user-friendly, multimodal, enjoyable 
and configurable. The objective of this work is to promote 
accessibility to the target user. The evaluation of the interfaces’ 
accessibility is carried out with 24 Alzheimer’s disease patients 
who are living in an assisted living environment in Sfax- 
Tunisia. The primary results show that the majority of the 
users are almost satisfied with the developed interfaces.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This paper presents user-friendly, multimodal, enjoyable 
and configurable interfaces that are developed for the 
CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis [1]. 
In the VIVA project [2] (“Vivre à Paris avec Alzheimer 
en 2030 grâce aux nouvelles technologies”), we are 
proposing a memory aid, called CAPTAIN MEMO, to help 
users to palliate mnesic problems. It target mainly 
individuals who are showing early/moderate signs of AD 
(Alzheimer’s Disease).This prosthesis aims to enhance the 
well being of AD patients’ lives. 
AD patients present own characteristics that differ from 
other user groups, parts of them are related to AD and the 
other parts are related to the normal effects of aging. These 
characteristics impair AD patients to use standard user 
interface. Thus, the design of the user interfaces of the 
CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis should suit AD 
patients’ specific needs to be accessible and easily used; 
becoming user-friendly interfaces. The CAPTAIN MEMO 
memory prosthesis tends to follow the “design-for-all” 
philosophy [1] that means considering not only intelligent 
healthy users who master technologies, but everybody of all 
ages and abilities, including the elderly suffering from AD. 
The CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis provides 
multimodal interfaces. Indeed, the interfaces’ interactions are 
not restricted to traditional modalities. We add other 
modalities: audio, speech recognition and touch. 
We add humor and fun to the interfaces in order to make 
it attractive and seduce more AD patients to use the 
CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis frequently. 
The interfaces are adjustable since the user can adjust 
text size and volume themselves. They can be adapted to the 
user’s visual and auditory abilities. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
Section II gives an overview of the CAPTAIN MEMO 
memory 
prosthesis. 
Section 
III 
reviews 
the 
main 
characteristics of AD patients, including the changes related 
to AD and the changes related to the normal effects of aging. 
Section IV proposes a set of design guidelines which should 
be taken into account for designing interfaces dedicated to 
AD patients. Section V describes the implemented interfaces. 
In Section VI, we present the evaluation of the interfaces that 
it is conducted on 24 AD patients. In Section VII, we discuss 
some related work and describe how our work differs from 
the existing ones. Finally, in Section VIII, we conclude and 
we give some perspectives. 
II. 
OVERVIEW OF THE ONGOING CAPTAIN MEMO 
MEMORY PROSTHESIS  
This section gives an overview of the ongoing CAPTAIN 
MEMO memory prosthesis for persons who are showing 
early/moderate sign of AD.  
A. Basic Functionalities 
The CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis supplies a set 
of services indoor and outdoor. We categorize these services 
into two categories: “Life Enhancing Services” and 
“Memory Refresh/Exercising Service”. 
1) Life Enhancing Services 
Life enhancing services can be categorised into the 
following 
four 
services: 
“Family/Entourage 
Show”, 
“Calendaring”, “Diary” and “Event Show”. 
The first module is called “Family/Entourage Show”. It 
reminds AD patients of their family members and their 
surroundings. It is also devoted to “remember things about 
people”, i.e., retrieving a person by navigation in the 
family/entourage tree, retrieving a person according to 
criteria, retrieving a person facing the camera, retrieving 
164

ACHI 2016 : The Ninth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

information about a person (name, family or conviviality 
relationship, age, preferences, gifts exchanged, favourite 
meals, recent events, shared events, etc.). 
The second service is called “Calendaring”. It reminds 
AD patients of all daily activities that should be performed. 
The events can refer to information stored in the prosthesis 
such as photos to help the patient recognize the person he 
needs to talk to or the place he needs to go to. The reminder / 
alarm can be set to be passive or active. 
Another service is called “Diary”. It allows AD patients 
to document their important events and personal details (an 
electronic memory). The stored data may be selectively 
updated, retrieved and displayed at the convenience of the 
user. AD patients may interrogate this electronic diary and 
read what they have written before to refresh memory. 
The last service is called “Event Show”. It allows AD 
patients to take photo and video e.g., photo and video of 
people, places and events. The user is then given a chance to 
tag the photo or video with phrases that reminds them of the 
subject. AD patients can go back to the stored information as 
frequently as needed. 
2) Memory Refresh/Exercising Service 
This service is called “Biographical Quiz”. It aims to 
refresh the AD patients’ memory by quizzing the patient 
about information related to their family, surrounding, event 
and so on, e.g., What is the favourite meal of John? What’s 
your son’s favourite animal? Is Alice black-haired? Does 
Robert wear clothes (Adding humor)? What does your 
mother work?  After each question, the patient is asked to 
give the correct answer. The highlight of this service is that 
each patient has his/her own collection of questions linked to 
his/her private life. 
B. System Architecture and Used Technologies  
In this section, we present the system architecture and the 
technologies used to implement the CAPTAIN MEMO 
memory prosthesis.  
The CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis is a semantic 
web application based on RDF ontologies and implemented 
in J2EE platform. We use the Jena API [3] and the SPARQL 
language [4].  
The CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis is a 
distributed multitiered application, based on MVC [5] in 
J2EE platform.  Figure 1 shows the architecture of the 
ongoing system.  
 
Figure 1. System architecture. 
The CAPTAIN MEMO prosthesis consists of three tiers 
as it is distributed over three different locations: the client 
machines, the J2EE server machine and the data machine. 
We use Glassfish [6] as J2EE server and Apache [7] as 
HTTP server. 
The CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis follows the 
MVC design pattern. The Model components represent the 
business logic (EJB). The View components (JSP) represent 
the interface that displays the processing results of the model 
components. 
The 
Controller 
(Servlet) 
manages 
the 
coordination between the Model and the View.  
III. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS 
In this section, we discuss expected changes which 
accompany the AD. In fact, interfaces devoted to AD 
patients are not that common [8]. The difficulty in using 
interfaces is one of the reasons why AD patients are not 
comfortable to use computer or software [8]. The design of 
the interfaces should suit the user’s needs [8][9] to be 
accessible and easily used. To adapt the interface to their 
needs; we first have to know their main problems. Compared 
to young healthy people AD patients suffer from AD-related 
changes and age-related changes, as shown in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2. Characteristics of AD patients. 
A. Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Changes 
Disabilities related to AD can be grouped into four 
groups: memory impairments, cognitive impairments, 
personality changes and declining language abilities. 
Memory impairments - One of the most common 
symptoms of AD is memory loss [8][10][12][14], especially 
short-term 
memory 
or 
forgetting 
recently 
learned 
information. The semantic information is normally preserved 
in long-term memory [15], e.g., history and languages. 
Cognitive impairments - The cognitive ability is one of 
the functions to decline due to AD [8][12]. Cognitive is the 
ability to generate ideas, to think, to remember and to focus 
on. AD causes a decrease in cognitive abilities such as the 
level of intelligence, speed of information processing, ability 
to learn, reasoning, judgment, attention ability [16], ability to 
solve problem and concentration ability [16]. 
Personality changes - AD patients experience changes in 
personality. The National Alzheimer’s Association estimates 
that up to 40% of patients experience depression. They are 
anxious about technology [17] and may refuse to learn [18]. 
Declining language abilities - AD patients exhibit 
declining language abilities [14]. Indeed, early stage AD 
patients may substitute words that have similar meaning.  
165

ACHI 2016 : The Ninth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

Moderate stage AD patients have increased difficulty in 
naming things.  
B. Age-Related Changes 
Most AD patients are elderly and thus have the usual 
limitations associated with aging [15]. Disabilities related to 
age can be grouped into six groups: visual impairments, 
hearing impairments, mobility impairments, decent/no 
computers skills, decent/no of literacy skills and declining 
speech abilities. 
Visual impairments - Old people experience a decline in 
their vision [10][16][19]. Aging is accompanied by a loss in 
visual acuity [8][10][20], decline in peripheral vision [19], 
decrease in dark adaptation [22], impairment of near-focus 
[15] including a computer screen [19], and decline in color 
sensitivity [17][19][22]. The Alzheimer’s association reports 
that over 60% of AD patients experience a decline in at least 
one visual capacity [14].  
Hearing impairments - Aging is related to declines in 
auditory acuity [15][16][19][20][21][22]. At the age of 65 
years, about 50% of men and 30% of women experience 
hearing loss [24]. Old people may suffer from another 
complaint that they can hear people talking, but they can’t 
make out the words [15]. They may also find it hard to 
understand synthetic speech [22].  
Mobility impairments - The mobility decline with aging 
[10][16][17][19][20][21][22]. Seniors with manual dexterity 
impairments have difficulties to operate with the mouse and 
keyboard. It is difficult for them to position the cursor if the 
target is small, and they have problems with control of fine 
movements. Because of the reduced motor functions, more 
errors occur during fine movements [16]. 
Decent/no computers skills - The elderly are not 
proficient in computer use and related technologies [17][20]. 
Decent/no literacy skills - The illiteracy rate of seniors 
aged 65 years and above are important. Besides, many 
seniors are literate; however they have basic literacy skills. 
They may not fully understand text-based information. Most 
seniors have difficulties with typing; they may forget how to 
write words.  
Declining speech abilities - Speech ability declines with 
aging [16]. Old people have problem in pronouncing 
complex words. Therefore, the speech input can be limited 
by voice tremors.  
Based on these changes, we strongly believe that AD 
patients will face difficulties if we adopt standard interfaces 
into the CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis. Thus, in the 
next section, we propose a set of design guidelines for 
accommodating these changes. 
IV. 
DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING INTERFACES 
FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT 
In this section, we propose a set of design guidelines 
which should be taken into account for designing interfaces 
dedicated to AD patients. The guidelines are grouped 
according to changes identified in the previous section. Ten 
groups of accessibility guidelines are created. They are 
categorised into AD-related guidelines and age-related 
guidelines. 
A. Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Design Guidelines 
This section proposes some practical design guidelines to 
accommodate the AD-related changes identified before. 
Memory impairments - The interface should give a 
feedback after every action [10], use short messages 
[10][20], support users in their interaction e.g., through a 
speaking front end [20] and use consistent navigation 
throughout the website. 
Cognitive impairments - The information should be 
summarised and categorised semantically into short 
categories. The headlines should be displayed on the top of 
the interface [18]. Image and icon should be simple, 
meaningful and easy to understand [18]. Text should be clear 
and avoid abbreviation [19][20]. Links should be underlined 
to make them identifiable. The design should be simple [15] 
and only main information should be displayed [21][22]. The 
interface’s distracting elements should be avoided [18][21]. 
Multimodal solutions improve the accessibility and facilitate 
the comprehension [10][11][22].  
Personality changes - It is recommended to add fun and 
humour to the interface [23]. The wordings should suit the 
adults’ semantic field [13]. Error feedback messages should 
make it clear that the user is not the cause of the error [18]. 
Declining language abilities - We recommend reducing 
the need for keyboarding or entire text input. 
B. Age-Related Design Guidelines 
Some practical design guidelines are mentioned in this 
section, according to age-related changes. 
Visual impairments - the  interface should have an 
appropriate size of design elements and text [11], use at least 
12-points to 14-points type size [16][21] and 16-points for 
headings, avoid large blocks of bold or underlined text [19], 
use a left aligned text [18], put the ability of zoom in the 
interface [15][18][22], use a sans-serif font type [19] and a 
medium face type [18], use soft colors [19], avoid decorative 
fonts [10][15], maximize the contrast between foreground 
and background colors [10][18][19][21] and write main body 
in lower cases. 
Hearing impairments - It is recommended to use, by 
default, higher sound [18], increase the duration of sound 
signal [18] and place a volume control in an easy to find spot 
[10][18]. The auditory information should be spoken slowly 
[10], pause slightly after each statement [15], use male voice 
[18][21] and use natural speech [15][22]. 
Mobility impairments - The design should contain large 
targets for accurate selections [13], use an audio supported 
menu [11], avoid the use of scrolling [18][19] and pull-down 
menus [19] and use touch screens [16][18][21]. 
Decent/no computers skills - Special assistance in terms 
of navigation should be given [9] e.g., providing 
previous/next links [19], showing the current location and 
providing a web site map. It is important to have an easy way 
of inserting special characters [11] e.g., the “@” character. 
Decent/no literacy skills - It is recommended to use 
graphical metaphors or sounding when users cannot read 
easily [10][22], identify buttons by icons and labels [13], 
minimize the use of keyboard [13] and use the speech-to-text 
mode for typing.

Declining speech abilities - Acoustic models specialized 
for elderly should be used for the speech-to-text mode [21].  
Based on these design guidelines, we develop the 
interfaces of the CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis. 
V. 
THE DEVELOPED  INTERFACES OF THE CAPTAIN MEMO 
MEMORY PROSTHESIS 
In this section, we present the developed interfaces of 
CAPTAIN MEMO prosthesis for persons who are showing 
early/moderate sign of AD. The developed interfaces are 
user-friendly, multimodal, enjoyable and configurable. 
We use a sans-serif font type (Arial), a medium face type 
and by default, 12 pt to 15 pt type size for displayed texts 
and 25 pt for headings. We use a black font on orange 
background to maximize the contrast between foreground 
and background. The main body is written in lower cases. 
We provide large buttons and images. Graphical metaphors 
or images are used to facilitate understanding text-based 
information, e.g., the use of the key metaphor associated to 
connection step in Figure 3.  
 
Figure 3. Graphical metaphors to facilitate understanding text information. 
We put the ability of zoom in the family tree. We provide 
large nodes identified by using pictures and labels, as shown 
in Figure 4. To ensure the simplicity of the design, we 
display details only on demand. We display the details of the 
node which is selected. Clicking on a node allows it to be 
bigger and distinguishable from the others. 
 
Figure 4. Identifying nodes of the family tree by using pictures and labels. 
Different modalities are employed. The input modalities 
include speech-to-text, touch and pointing device + 
keyboard. The output modalities include vision and 
voice/audio.   
We provide two modalities for typing: the traditional 
mode and the dictation or speech-to-text mode. We give the 
possibility of alternating between modalities. We reduce the 
need for keyboarding or entire text input. We provide 
choices to select from a dropdown list as possible. 
We provide feedback after every action. We use two 
modalities of feedback: vocal and textual. The text and audio 
feedback have the same message. We use easy to understand 
and short messages. We use different tones for errors and 
successful entries.  
We add an old parrot to the interfaces, which is known 
for intelligence, fun and especially for the ability to imitate 
human voices. We resort to funny sentence for both textual 
and vocal message. We use droll emoticons. 
We add an auditory background to the interfaces in order 
to support the users in their interactions. We use a male voice 
and natural speech. We use, by default, higher sound for 
delivering 
the 
auditory 
information. 
The 
auditory 
background can turn on or off. 
The interfaces are adjustable. We let the users adjust text 
size and the volume themselves. 
The interfaces are implemented in three languages: 
French, English and Arabic. Figure 5 shows an interface 
presented in Arabic language. 
 
Figure 5. An interface presented in Arabic language. 
Finally, we have to evaluate the developed interfaces 
with AD patients. The next section elaborates the results. 
VI. 
TESTS AND EVALUATION 
The evaluation of the interfaces’ accessibility and ease to 
use is carried out with 24 AD patients who are living in an 
assisted living environment in Sfax- Tunisia (Street Manzel 
Chaker km. 8). The participants have an average age of 64 
years – the youngest is 55 years old and the oldest is 78. 
Most patients have AD in early/moderate stage. Their 
profiles are summarized in terms of age, stage of AD, 
difficulties in vision/hearing, computer skills and literacy 
skills.

This study was performed from July 2015 for about two 
months. Tasks were performed on tablet PC. A stylus pen is 
used to input commands to the touch-screen. The 
questionnaire covers five dimensions which include: 
“Overall 
Reaction”, 
“Visibility”, 
“Speech-to-text”, 
“Terminology” and “Auditory Background”. A five point 
scales are used: strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neutral 
(3), agree (4) and strongly agree (5). Table 1 summarizes the 
results and the mean score for each dimension.

Only 20 participants fully complete all tasks. The others 
just start the first test. They say that they are too old and have 
no motivation in learning a new technology. Those 
participants are the oldest with AD in moderate /late stage. 
They have no computer skills. We call them “patient-
restricted users”. 
The overall mean score of the 5 dimension is between 3, 
8 and 4, 74. Overall, the results indicate that the users are 
almost agreed that the developed interfaces are accessible 
and easy to use. 
55% of all participants are strongly satisfied with the 
system. They say that they will use the CAPTAIN MEMO 
memory prosthesis frequently. Those participants suffer from 
AD in early stage, familiar with computers and have good 
literacy skills. 
25% of all participants say that it is easier for them to 
type with a virtual keyboard; since their voice volume is not 
enough to be captured by the device’s microphone. Thus, in 
the next iteration, we will use acoustic models specialized for 
elderly persons for the speech recognizer. Illiterate 
participants are very satisfied with the dictation modality. 
30% of all participants ignore totally the speaking front 
end since they don’t understand words. Thereafter, in the 
next version, we will use slower voice speed. 
VII. 
RELATED WORK 
In this section, we review some software application 
developed to support AD patients such as COGKNOW [25], 
AP@LZ [26], BACKUP MEMORY [27] and ARCUS [28]. 
COGKNOW and AP@LZ provide reminders to do specific 
activities according to a schedule. BACKUP MEMORY 
helps AD patients remember their families and/or 
surrounding. ARCUS is a virtual name directory that allows 
searching for names using cues. Table 2 gives a general 
comparison between the user interfaces of the cited 
applications.

Compared to related work, the developed interfaces of 
the CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis provide more 
features than the other applications. In fact, only 
COGKNOW and CAPTAIN MEMO provide a good 
management of the screen’s elements. Second, the 
developed interfaces provide more modalities, which can 
increase the chances of comprehension. Finally, only our 
work allow user setting the volume and the size of the font 
and add fun to seduce AD patient to use frequently our 
memory prosthesis.  
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
This paper presented the developed interfaces of the 
ongoing CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis, which is 
developed to assist individuals who are showing early/ 
moderate signs of AD to palliate mnesic problems. So, at 
the beginning, we discuss the expected changes related to 
the AD and the aging process. Based on these changes, we

believe that the interface plays a big role to ensure that AD 
patients can use the CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis 
easily. To accommodate those changes, we propose a set of 
design guidelines for interfaces dedicated to AD patients. 
This set of design guidelines covers the main AD-related 
changes and age-related changes that might affect the 
accessibility of the interfaces. Based on these design 
guidelines, we develop the interfaces of the Captain Memo 
memory prosthesis. The developed interfaces present the 
advantages that they are user-friendly, multimodal, 
enjoyable and configurable. Afterward, a user satisfaction 
evaluation of the interfaces is carried out with 24 AD 
patients. The results confirm that the developed interfaces 
are easy to use and funny to use. The majority of the 
participants say that they will use our prosthesis frequently. 
Finally, we review some related work and demonstrate how 
our work differs from the existing ones. 
 
Future works will be mainly devoted:  
 
To integrate acoustic model specialized for elderly 
persons for the speech recognizer; 
 
To use slower voice speed for the auditory 
background; 
 
To add the haptic modality in order to offer a 
tactile feedback for the user ,which is a vibration 
that occurs when the user selects a button with 
his/her finger; 
 
To add an audio supported menu. Speech should 
work not only for dictation when writing a 
message, but also for command; 
 
To authenticate the users using the facial 
recognition modality; 
 
To evaluate the CAPTAIN MEMO memory 
prosthesis with memorizing test.
