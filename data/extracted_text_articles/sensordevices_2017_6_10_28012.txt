Abstract— Blind people have been, over time, a reason for
motivation in the development of solutions to improve their
quality of life. The aim of this work is to propose a solution for
one of such problems, namely, the selection and combination of
clothing for the blind. Thus, this article describes the whole
project
developed,
in
agreement
with
the
Portuguese
Association of the Blind and Amblyopic of Portugal (ACAPO),
for the creation of a Web platform to aid the blind in selecting
combinations of clothing. Near Field Communication (NFC)
technology is the basis of this project in the identification of
garments. The features of the garments are inserted manually,
and a combination of features is possible. There is also the
possibility to automatically identify the color of the garment.
The system has been tested by the ACAPO organization and
preliminary feedback is positive, which are a good starting
point for the future. This solution helps promote an increased
autonomy for blind people.

INTRODUCTION
The definition of being human leads us to certain
questions: to what extent are we different? Will our society
be able to define our species without aesthetic questions? Is
our
society
with
its
capabilities,
whether
social,
psychological,
technological,
to
help
citizens
with
disabilities? Is there enough technology to minimize the
obstacles faced by these people in their daily lives?
Certainly, the technology in this field has evolved a lot, but
there are still some gaps to be filled.
People with visual impairment face difficulties at various
levels, since they are limited in their functional capacity to
carry out daily activities, such as different domestic tasks,
the choice of clothing, and in all the tasks that are easy for
people with visual capacity.
Vision is a sense that dominates human life. It allows us
to know and have a perception of the world around us, while
giving
us
meaning
for
objects,
concepts
and ideas. Vision is the primary human because it is the
dominant sensory channel in the acquisition of information
from the outside. Vision accounts for about 80% of our
sensory inputs [1][2].
With the advancement of technology, it is important to
evolve to minimize all the limitations of a blind person. One
issue that remains to be explored is the case of blind people
is the selection and combination of garments. Sometimes,
even if we do not have any type of disability, we have
difficulty choosing what to wear; we can imagine the
difficulty of a visually impaired person in this aspect. Not
knowing the colors, the type of pattern, or even the place
where the garments are found makes this a daily battle in
which resources are not the best. Therefore, we proposed this
project to address the issue of combining clothing for the
blind.
This paper is organized in 5 sections. Section 2 presents
some available solutions to help in the autonomy of blind
people. Section 3 describes the various components of the
solution presented, including system architecture, hardware,
software, database as well as Web and windows applications.
Section 4 describes the tests performed with blind people to
validate the solution presented and finally, Section 5 draws
the conclusions and suggests further developments.

RELATED WORK
Currently, there is no solution on the market to help blind
people with their clothes combination. Indirectly, but not
focused on this purpose, we can find applications for mobile
devices that can provide, even if far from what is wanted,
some help. Some applications already developed in that
sense include: Be my eyes, Color Detector, Ibeacons and
Colorino.
‘By my eyes’ [3] is a mobile application considering a
video call via the internet to get help from a visually capable
person. The color detector is an application of the app store
for iOs that uses a screenshot to calculate the average color
of a chosen area. The Beacons are small devices that use
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. This technology
has an incalculable practical effect. With the beacons, it is
possible to identify, for example, landmarks, bathrooms,
stairs, shops and many other things. The Colorino is
particularly suitable for people who have a reduced vision
and even for the blind, as it assists in the choice of clothes,
the washing procedure and the color combination.
The research project Context Extraction for the Blind
Using Computer Vision (CE4BLIND) is a mobile digital
68

platform that results in a computer application that can be
used on a computer, mobile phone or tablet. This project
aims to increase the perception of reality to those who cannot
use their vision as stated by those responsible for the project,
that is, to facilitate and give these people greater autonomy
in tasks such as reading a newspaper, a restaurant menu or
identifying a route [4].
Another project described in literature is "Assistive
Clothing Pattern Recognition for Visually Impaired People"
which consists of recognizing patterns of clothing being able
to identify 11 clothing colors and recognize 4 categories of
clothing
patterns
[5]-[7].
The
paper
"Rotation
and
Illumination Invariant Texture Analysis" suggests a form of
clothing combinations of complex patterns for visually
impaired people [8][9]. Also, the project described in the
paper "Recognizing clothes patterns and colors for blind
people using neural network" allows to classify the type of
pattern of garments through extracting their characteristics
by a camera [10]-[12].
As described, although there are some projects that can
be used to help the blind, none of them contains the idea
presented in this project. Thus, the development of an
application
for
combinations
of
clothing
pieces
was
elaborated.
III.
DEVELOPED APPLICATION
In this section, the entire system developed is presented,
including all the hardware and software.
A.
System Architecture
First, to develop this project, it was proposed to develop
a
Representational
State
Transfer
(REST)
system
architecture (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Rest Architecture.
For this, the system is composed of an Application
Programming Interface (API) and a front-end application
that is all that the user "can see". The API is responsible to
process all requests of the user, coming from the front-end
interface,
such
as
image
acquisition
and
processing,
automatic combinations, among other features.
B.
Hardware
The hardware platform focuses on the Arduino Uno,
equipped with an Atmel AVR microcontroller and a C++
programming environment (Figure 2).
Since, the technology used for this project is the NFC
(Near Field Communication), it requires an NFC shield to
Arduino. The reading module is the ITEAD PN532. It has
SPI
(Serial
Peripheral
Interface),
I2C
(Inter-Integrated
Circuit)
and
UART
(Universal
Asynchronous
Receiver/Transmitter) communication interfaces. However,
the mode of communication used is the SPI. In this way, the
Arduino is connected to a PC and allows the interface with
the Web platform.
Figure 2. Hardware Developed.
The TAG chosen to place in the clothes is the NTAG216
tag minimally invasive (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Clothes with TAG.
The tag used has the following characteristics:
•
Chip - NTAG216;
•
Frequency - 13.56MHz;
•
Memory - 888 bytes;
•
Data transfer: 106 kbit/s;
•
Maximum number of characters (URL) – 854.

SENSORDEVICES 2017 : The Eighth International Conference on Sensor Device Technologies and Applications

The NXP NTAG®216 chip offers excellent memory
capacity, ideal for storing more information, however, in this
project we will not make use of it once it is identified by its
UID (Unique Identifier) [13][14].
C.
Software
The application development uses Laravel, which is a
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) Framework that uses the
MVC (model-view-controller) architecture [15].
This architecture allows simplifying the application in 3
layers, namely user interaction (view), data manipulation
layer (model), responsible for reading and writing, and the
controller layer, responsible for all user requests that controls
the model to be used and the display to be shown to the user.
The database used by default in Laravel is MySQL.
D.
Database
The database was developed to respond to a set of
challenges posed by the system that results in the following
key requirements:
1. A user can perform more than one function;
2. Each role is associated with a set of permissions,
regardless of which user executes it;
3. Each clothing item (with a unique identifier) is
associated with a set of parameterized characteristics:
•
Size;
•
Washing;
•
Printed;
•
Season;
•
Type;
•
Color;
•
Style.
The
database
created
was
based
on
the
Entity-
Relationship (ER) Model. In the database management
system, a set of tables will also be considered, which will
assist in the decision making. The application also has an
administrator level that is composed of the following tables:
•
Users;
•
Profiles;
•
Permissions.
This way, we guarantee privileged access to certain areas
of the application and a level of administration.
E.
Web Application
To understand the structure of the Web application,
Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the organization
considered.
Considering Figure 4, it is possible to verify that there are
four main elements, the "Menu", "About", "Contact" and
"Administrator", and, to be able to access them, a user
authentication is necessary.
For this purpose, it is necessary to access the "Register"
to create the user.
Figure 4. Block Diagram of MyEyes.
With the login done, it is possible to access the "Menu",
where there are 6 topics, “My profile”, “My Clothes”,
“Combination”,
“History
Data”,
“Color
Palettes
and
Camera” (Figure 5):
Figure 5. Menu MyEyes.
•
My
Profile:
is
where
all
user's
personal
management
is
done,
where
all
the
user's
authenticated fields can be seen, such as name,
email and password. This data can be edited at any
time.

•
My Clothes: serves to manage the clothes that the
user owns. The clothes can be listed by their
attributes, such as: style, type, pattern, size, colors
and season. During the listing, the user can edit and
delete the part, thus allowing stock management
(Figure 6).
Figure 6. My Clothes Details.
•
Combination:
The
whole
combination
of
clothes is implemented here. The user can see
their combinations, edit and delete them in
"view details" (blue boxes), referring to each
piece of clothing (Figure 7).
Figure 7. Part of Combination Layout.
•
History Data: It allows the user to consult the
registry of the last pieces of clothing added, as
well as the clothes unavailable. That is, if it is
necessary to put a garment in this state, and in
case it may be for washing, a quick perception
about the state of it is presented.
•
Color
Palettes:
This
mode
is
like
the
combination, but has an automatic mode in
which the application makes a filter through the
seasons (Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer),
suggesting only parts from the same station or
that can be used in both. In this way, we
guarantee that all the possible combinations
agree with the season of the time, eliminating
numerous pieces that would generate confusion
to the user.
•
Camera: Here, it is possible to obtain the
predominant color of a garment. There are two
ways to do this, one is to upload an image of a
garment, and another is to take a photo of the
garment with the webcam. After choosing one
of the two modes, the predominant color of the
garment is shown.
F.
Windows Apllication
To allow the interface with the NFC reader, a computer
application was developed a computer application (Windows
operating system) in C # language, capable of performing the
readings of NFC tags (Figure 8).
Figure 8. Desktop Application.

In this case, the algorithm has been thought in a way in
which the application detects the device automatically, at
the time of its connection, autonomously establishing a
communication.
IV.
VALIDATION
This
project
was
submitted
for
validation
at
the
Association of the Blind and Amblyopic of Portugal
(ACAPO) in Braga, Portugal. Application testing focuses on
accessibility and usability (Figure 9).
Figure 9. Blind people reading clothes.
During the validation, there were added pieces of
clothing and for each one was attached its NFC tag. After,
recognize of each clothing was performed with NFC reader.
The feedback was very positive. However, some remarks
were discussed to improve the application, like:
•
Include more info in social networks (Facebook,
YouTube and so on);
•
In the windows application, implement a beep
sound when detecting a new TAG;
•
Create a “back button” at the end of each page to
improve usability;
•
Invert the order the clothes are shown in when an
additional clothing item is added. This means that
the last record needs to appear in the first row;
•
Exchange the TAG number by Description field
when the Clothe is displayed, since that TAG
number is insignificant to remember the clothe;
•
Remove the confirmation button when attempting
to
see
more
details
or
edit,
and
keep
the
confirmation only in case of deleting.
Afterwards, all topics above were considered and a new
version of the application was validated again; it means that
the second validation was tested without any other additional
changes.
Considering the preliminary usability tests performed by
the
ACAPO
member,
the
blind
people
community
considered that this project will be very useful for the blind
population because it could fill a major gap that affects this
population, which is related to the identification and
characterization of clothing. This solves an obvious difficulty
in
the
task
of
making
combinations
at
the
time
of choosing the pieces of clothing that they are going to
wear.
These obstacles go so far as to prevent a blind person
from being able to choose their daily clothes in a completely
autonomous way, forcing them to ask for help from others to
describe the pieces that they have, and to organize their
wardrobe in order to not be confused by the colors, shades,
fabric types and other characteristics of the garment.
Moreover, they consider that as there are many blind citizens
who live alone and several couples consisting only of blind
people, the usefulness of such a tool will increase their
autonomy and promote a better inclusion in society. It would
be extraordinary if, with this platform, people no longer had
the need to ask for help from others regarding clothing
combinations. It is true that video calls today make this kind
of task much easier, but we must clearly aim for autonomy
and independence, and My eyes can offer blind people this
legitimate desire to be able to choose in an informed and
conscious way the clothes they wear every day.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presented a system able to allow visually
impaired people to combine cloths based on their taste and
options.
The introduction of NFC technology in clothing allows
the creation of an autonomous clothing management for a
blind person. Being a Web application, it is accessible to all.
This application will make possible to contribute to the lack
in the existing technology in relation to the aesthetics and
visual image of a blind person. The user interface is intuitive
and of great usability.
The tests performed with the Portuguese Association of
the Blind and Amblyopic of Portugal (ACAPO) validated the
proposed solution.
As future work, we intend to implement machine learning
in combinations of garments, as well as the insertion of
garments automatically using a camera and image processing
algorithms in the extraction of characteristics. The multi-
language capability needs to be implemented also to increase
the number of potential users. Moreover, we intend to use
NFC from mobile devices to incorporate this project.
