Abstract—The use of cellular technology is overwhelming our 
lives these days. GSM waves - the basis of cellular technology - 
are high frequency, high energy electromagnetic waves that 
may pause as a threat to man.  The current work studies the 
effect of such waves on two types of skeletal muscles, the slow 
and fast twitching muscles. The activity, morphology, and 
structure of the affected muscles are studied and analyzed 
against control. Our results shows that in both muscles, there 
were changes in the distribution of muscles proteins and in the 
percentage of MHC isoforms suggesting that the GSM antenna 
relay affects the plasticity of skeletal muscle fiber by 
transforming slow type to faster one. 
 
Keywords-GSM electromagnetic waves; skeletal muscles; 
proteins content; testosterone level; MHC isoforms. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Striated muscle myofibrils are composed of repeating 
units called sarcomeres that are arranged in series. 
Sarcomeres in turn are composed of contractile filaments 
termed myofilaments that are of two major types, actin (thin 
filament) and myosin (thick filament), which interact 
together to generate 
force and contraction. These 
myofilaments 
are 
large 
polymers 
of 
noncovalently 
associated contractile proteins, actin and myosin, that 
comprise 70% of myofibrillar proteins in skeletal muscles 
[1]. The isomers of Myosin Heavy Chains (MHC) are often 
used to distinguish the types of skeletal muscle fibers: slow-
twitch – or type I – muscle fibers, where MHC I isoform is 
abundantly expressed; and fast-twitch – or type II – muscle 
fibers (types IIa, IIb, and IId/x), where MHC IIa, IIb, IIx/d 
predominate respectively [2-4]. Slow-twitch fibers are 
adapted for continuous activity, and they are rich in 
myoglobin and oxidative enzymes. A typical example is the 
soleus muscle. Fast-twitch fibers are adapted for rapid 
activity, and they produce energy through glycolytic 
metabolism. A typical example is the extensor digitorum 
longus (edl) muscle [5]. 
A remarkable characteristic of striated muscles is 
plasticity. This term refers to the ability of these muscles to 
remodel and thus change their contractile and metabolic 
makeup, and – hence –  their type from slow to fast, or vice 
versa, in response to specific environmental challenges, 
such as exercise, temperature, or gravitational loading,  or 
internal challenges such as nutritional conditions as well as 
neuronal, mechanical, metabolic or hormonal stimuli [6]. 
This may be attributed to a reversible change in the muscle 
gene expression that leads to reversible structural and 
functional modifications [7]. 
One of the important challenges that have developed in 
the last decade and is thought to have an effect on health is 
the 
population 
exposure 
to 
electromagnetic 
waves, 
particularly the Global System of Mobile communication 
signals (GSM) signals. These signals are emitted from 
diverse sources particularly from cell phones and base 
station antennas. Also, they may come from industrial 
processes where workers in broadcasting, transport, and 
communication industries are highly exposed. They are also 
emitted from medical devices like electrosurgical devices 
and diagnosis equipment. Thus, concerns from the risk of 
GSM signals on health arise from long term exposure as 
well as from the cumulative effect of these waves. The 
major mechanism by which such waves can induce an effect 
on biological systems is the thermal mechanism by which 
the Electromagnetic Field (EMF) at high intensities can 
increase the tissue or body temperatures above the normal

value. 
Non-thermal 
mechanisms 
are 
under 
wide 
investigation in recent studies [8-11]. 
Few 
studies 
have 
investigated 
the 
effect 
of 
electromagnetic waves on skeletal muscles. In fact, 
Radicheva et al. in 2002 has shown that a 2.45 GHz 
microwave field could possess a stimulating effect on 
muscle fiber activity, which is in part due to its specific non-
thermal properties [12]. Moreover, our previous study has 
shown that one hour of exposure to electromagnetic field at 
900 MHz modulated by human voice could have an effect 
on the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism of 
mammalian fast- twitch skeletal muscles [13]. However, no 
study to date has investigated the effect of electromagnetic 
waves emitted by GSM relay antenna on muscle 
composition. Consequently, this study is designed to 
investigate the effect of 25V/m of electromagnetic waves 
emitted by GSM relay antenna on animal body weight, 
muscle mass, proteins and water content, total RNA 
expression, serum testosterone level and myosin heavy 
chain isoforms expression in the two types of skeletal 
muscle fibers, slow and fast- twitches. 
This paper studies the effect of GSM waves on skeletal 
muscles.  A background of the study is given in Section I.  
The materials and methods used in the study are mentioned 
in Section II. The results are presented in Section III, and 
discussed in Section IV. 
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Experimental Design  
All procedures in this study were performed in 
accordance 
with 
the 
stipulations 
of 
the 
Helsinki 
Declarations, and with the current Lebanese laws for animal 
experimentation. Twenty adult Sprague-Dawley male rats 
with an average weight of 190 ± 5 g were divided equally 
into 2 groups. One group was subjected for 6 weeks to 
whole continuous (24 hours/day) body exposure to EMW 
(900 MHz, Eeff= 25V/m). The other group was considered 
as control and maintained in the same environmental 
conditions under the turned off antenna. Both exposed and 
control animals were housed in a temperature-controlled 
room (22ºC) on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. They were daily 
supplied with the same kind of food and water.  
B. Dissection  
After the exposure period, the rats were gently sacrificed 
and trunk blood was collected. Soleus and edl muscles were 
rapidly excised from the hind limbs of each rat. The muscles 
are weighted and preserved at - 80ºC for later analysis.  
C. Total RNA extraction 
 
Total RNA was extracted from muscle samples using 
RiboZol™ RNA Extraction Reagent from AMRESCO, 
according to the vender’s instructions (American Research 
Products, 30175 Solon Industrial Parkway, Solon, OH 
44139-9827 USA).  
D. Serum testosterone level determination 
Collected blood was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 
minutes. Serum of each rat was preserved at -20°C. Serum 
Testosterone levels in control and exposed groups were 
measured by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay 
(ELISA) technique based on the principle of competitive 
binding, according to instructions supplied by the vender.  
E. Proteins dosage  
Protein dosage was performed according to Bradford 
Technique 
[14]. 
Pieces 
of 
frozen 
muscles 
were 
mechanically disrupted and spliced in 5 volumes of washing 
buffer containing 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA (pH 6.4), and 
5 mM PO4. After 5 minutes of centrifugation at a high 
speed (12000 rpm), the supernatant is collected and the 
quantity of the protein is determined with the Bradford 
method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), where the results were 
expressed as a ratio of milligrams of proteins to 100 
milligrams of muscles. The pellet was then washed with 3 
volumes of extraction buffer containing 5 mM EGTA, 1mM 
dithiothreitol (pH 8.5), and 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 
and incubated in cold overnight. The next day, the mixture 
was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes and the 
supernatant – which contained the protein myosin – was 
collected and the amount of myofibrillar proteins was 
determined. Small volumes (50μL) of the supernatant were 
diluted twice with glycerol and stored at -20°C for 
electrophoresis. 
F. SDS-PAGE electrophoretic separation of Myosin 
Heavy Chain isoforms 
To analyze the content of MHC I, MHC IIa, IIb, IId/x 
isoforms in the extracts, we used simple vertical migration 
of SDS-PAGE electrophoretic separation. The separating 
gel was prepared from 99.5% glycerol, 30% acrylamide, 
0.6% bis acrylamide, 1.5 M Tris (pH 8.8), 1 M glycine, 10% 
SDS, 10% ammonium persulfate, and TEMED. The staking 
gel was prepared from 99.5% glycerol, 30% acrylamide, 
0.6% bis acrylamide, 0.5 M Tris (pH 6.8), 10% SDS, 0.1 M 
EDTA (pH 7), 10% ammonium persulfate, and TEMED. 
For best quantification, 2-3 μg of myosin were loaded in 
each well. Electrophoresis was performed using a Cleavage, 
Scientific ltd, system. Gels were run at constant voltage 
(70V) for 24 h and then stained with silver reagent that 
allowed the detection of the MHC bands corresponding to I, 
IIa, IIb, and IId/x isoforms. The stained gels were scanned 
using a Canon digital imaging system and the density of 
bands was estimated using the UN-Scan-IT software [15]. 
G. Statistical analysis 
All values are expressed as means ± SE for n 
observations. Data were analyzed by One-Way ANOVA 
(StatView; Alsyd, Meylan, France) statistical test. A level of 
p< 0.05 indicated statistical significance.

RESULTS  
A. Effect of GSM waves exposure on Body mass 
As shown in Fig. 1, all animals steadily gained weight 
and there was no difference observed between the control 
and exposed animals after 6 weeks of GSM waves exposure 
(Control: 283 ± 8 g; Exposed:  295 ± 7 g, n=10)

Each value displays mean ±SE. 
 
B. Effect of GSM waves exposure on muscles mass 
Although body weight was not affected by the exposure, 
six weeks of exposure resulted in a significant decrease in 
edl mass by 16% (Control; 133.56 ± 3.69 mg; Exposed: 
112.19 ± 2.57 mg, n=20, p<0.05). However, no significant 
effect was observed in soleus muscle mass (Control; 120.06 
± 2.89 mg; Exposed: 117.49 ± 3.11 mg, n=20) (Fig. 2).  
Such a decrease in muscle mass observed in edl muscle 
could be related to modification in water content and/or in 
the proteins content. Consequently the water content and the 
soluble and myofibrillar proteins content were estimated. 
C. Effect of GSM waves exposure on muscles water 
content 
In control group, water content expressed as percentage 
is estimated to 37.5 ± 0.7% in soleus muscles and 26.9 ± 
0.6% in edl muscles. After 6 weeks of continuous 
electromagnetic 
waves 
exposure, 
and 
although 
no 
significant effect was observed in soleus muscle mass, an 
increase by 17% in percentage of water content was 
observed (43.9 ± 1.2%, n=12, p<0.05). However, no 
significant effect was observed in edl muscles (28.1 ± 0.6%, 
n=12) (Fig. 3) 
D. Effect of GSM waves exposure on proteins content 
In soleus control muscles, soluble and myofibrillar 
proteins content were 2.71±0.13 and 3.42 ±0.26 mg/g of 
muscle, respectively. The six weeks of continuous 
electromagnetic waves exposure induced an increase by 
23% of soluble proteins (3.34±0.16 mg/g, n=24, p<0.05); 
however, a decrease by 32% of myofibrillar proteins was 
observed (2.33±0.29 mg/g, n=24, p<0.05) (Fig. 4). 
In edl control muscles, soluble and myofibrillar proteins 
content were 3.56±0.18 and 3.83 ±0.11 mg/g of muscle, 
respectively. Six weeks of continuous GSM waves exposure 
induced a decrease by 28% and 24% of soluble and 
myofibrillar proteins, respectively (Soluble proteins content: 
2.78±0.19 mg/g; Myofibrillar proteins content: 2.91±0.22 
mg/g of muscle, n=24, p<0.05) (see Fig. 4). 
These modifications in proteins content in both soleus 
and edl muscles should be correlated to total RNA level 
expression. 
Fig. 2. Effect of GSM waves exposure on muscles mass of the edl and 
soleus muscles. Each histogram displays mean ±SE. * p < 0.05 
E. Effect of GSM waves exposure on total RNA 
In control condition, the total RNA values were 755.21± 
16.72 g/l and 548.32± 14.98g/l in edl and soleus 
muscles, respectively. After 6 weeks of GSM exposure, a 
decrease by 29% and 25% were shown in both edl and 
soleus muscles, respectively (n=10; p<0.05).   
This decrease in the amount of total RNA expression 
could be related to the modification in the serum 
testosterone level.

F. Effect of GSM waves exposure on serum testosterone 
level 
In 
control 
condition, 
the 
Enzyme-Linked 
ImmunoSorbent Assay showed that serum testosterone level 
was 82.12 ± 4.39 ng/ml. Six weeks of GSM waves exposure 
induced a decrease by 50% in serum testosterone level 
(40.91 ± 5.71 ng/ml, n=10, p<0.05). 
G. Effect of GSM waves exposure on Myosin Heavy Chain 
Isoforms expression 
Separation and analysis of MHC isoforms by SDS-
PAGE allowed the estimation of the density of the bands 
corresponding to each of the MHC isoforms (MHC I, IIa, 
IIb, and IIx) using the UN-Scan-IT software. These isoforms 
are differentially expressed in the different muscle fiber 
types.  In control conditions, the edl muscle expresses 34.6 
± 0.2 % of MHC IIx and 66.4±2.8 % of MHC IIb, while the 
soleus muscle expresses 5.1 ± 1.7% of MHC IIa and 94.6 ± 
1.5% of MHC I.  
The 6 weeks of GSM waves exposure induced, in edl 
muscle, a significant increase by 63% in the expression of 
MHC IIx isoforms (56.3±4.2%) and a significant decrease 
by 33% in MHC IIb isoforms expression (44.9±3.4%, n=24, 
p<0.05). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moreover, in soleus muscle, the exposure induced a 
significant increase in the expression of MHC IIa isoforms 
(16.1 ± 1.7%) with a significant decrease in the expression 
of MHC I isoforms (84.3±1.5%, n=24, p<0.05). (Fig. 5)

DISCUSSION 
Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in animals 
representing up to 50% of body mass in some athletic 
species such as dogs and horses. Muscle fibers are 
composed of myofibrils arranged in parallel which 
constitute the major compartment in muscle cells, 
comprising from 73.2% of muscle fiber volume in horses to 
83.3% of muscle fiber volume in goats. Also, total 
myofibrillar volume is directly proportional to muscle mass 
with a scaling factor of 0.98 [16].  
This study aims to examine the effect of electromagnetic 
waves emitted from GSM antenna relay, at 900 MHz 
frequency, on body weight, muscle mass, protein content 
and the expression of the isoforms of the myosin heavy 
chain (MHC) in 2 types of muscle fiber types. One is slow 
oxidative fiber and the other is fast glycolytic fiber.  
Many questions were raised about the possibility that 
exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile 
phones or their base stations could affect the health of users. 
If there is a health impact, there will be a global impact 
because the number of active cell phones is estimated to 
reach 7.3 billion by 2014. For this, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) established the International EMF 
Project in 1996 to assess the science, and recommended 
research to fill gaps in the knowledge of risks arising from 
exposure to electromagnetic fields on health [7]. 
Human skeletal muscle is a highly heterogeneous tissue, 
able to adapt to environmental challenges to which it is 
subjected. This process is governed by a set of mechanical, 
hormonal and nutritional signals [17-19]. Phenotypic 
plasticity of muscle tissue allows it to be modified in order 
to meet the specific demands faced by an animal during its 
life [13]. This critical property leads to a conversion of 
muscle fibers from slow to fast or vice versa [2, 20]. A wide 
range of contractile properties are mainly attributed to the 
diversity of the isoforms of MHC, which can exist in 
different muscle fibers. Four MHC isoforms (I, IIa, IIx and 
IIb), each encoded by a separate gene can be expressed in 
adult skeletal muscle. The intrinsic differences in the 
properties of the ATPase of MJHC isoforms led to the 
classification of fiber muscle as slow or fast fibers [18]. 
Generally, the fast-type genes appear to be expressed at 
birth, while the slow-type genes are expressed in response to 
changes in activity during development [17].  
Actually, only two studies have examined the effect of 
electromagnetic waves on the skeletal muscle. The first 
study was conducted in vivo and showed that the field of 
microwave of 2.45 GHz has a stimulating effect on the 
activity of the muscle fibers, which is in part due to its non-
thermal specific properties [12]. The second study was 
conducted in vitro, and showed that one hour of exposure to 
900 MHz of electromagnetic field modulated by the human 
voice could have an effect on the mechanism of excitation-
contraction coupling of skeletal muscle fast-twitch [13].  
The 
results 
of 
our 
present 
work 
show 
that 
electromagnetic waves do not affect the body weight of rat 
males. In addition, the exposure period results in a decrease 
in absolute edl muscle mass, while that of soleus is kept 
unchanged. The myofibrillar protein content is directly 
proportional to muscle mass. A decrease in the mass of the 
edl was translated by decrease of both myofibrillar protein 
content and soluble protein. The increase in soluble protein 
content in soleus muscle was compensated by the decrease 
of myofibrillar proteins content resulting in the maintenance 
of muscle mass of soleus. This can be explained by the 
compensatory mechanisms at the translational and post-
translational levels as suggested by Nikolova et al. [22]. In 
addition, synthetic modification in myofibrillar and soluble 
proteins in edl and soleus may be the consequence of the 
changes of level of transcription of genes encoding these 
proteins or due to perturbation in the stability of their 
corresponding mRNAs [20]. Therefore, the quantification of 
the mRNA encoding the soluble and myofibrillar and 
measurement of protein half-life is necessary to detect the 
level at which the change has led to modify the level of 
myofibrillar proteins and other proteins expressed in these 
two types of skeletal muscles. Our results provide new 
information by showing a decrease in the total RNA values 
in both edl and soleus muscles after 6 weeks of exposure to 
GSM.    
On the other hand, the effect of electromagnetic waves 
is specific and can be attributed to a modification in the 
activity of different hormones. In 2010, Meo et al. [23] 
showed that exposure to radiation emitted by mobile phone 
for 60 minutes / day for a period of 3 months significantly 
decreased the level of serum testosterone in albino rats 
Wistar. In 2008, Al-Akhras showed that exposure for 6 
weeks in a sinusoidal electromagnetic field of 50 Hz 
resulted in a significant reduction in levels of gonadotropins 
(FSH and LH) in female rats [24]. These results are similar 
to our results, where we showed a decrease in the level of 
testosterone after 6 weeks of exposure to GSM waves. This 
decrease can explain the decrease in total RNA values in 
both muscles since it is known that testosterone binds with 
androgen receptors inside the nucleus of different target 
cells and turn on the synthesis of mRNA which are then 
translated into specified proteins. Thus, the decrease of the 
a 
b

level of testosterone may explain the decrease of the RNA 
levels.     
  
The change in the percentage of MHC isoforms was 
also detected. The results show an increase of the MHC IIa 
isoform, but a decrease in the MCH I isoform in the soleus 
muscle. In the edl muscle, a significant increase in MHC IIx 
and a significant decrease of MHC IIb isoforms were 
observed. These results suggest that the GSM antenna relay 
affects the plasticity of skeletal muscle fiber by 
transforming slow type to faster one.
