Abstract—In this paper, two models, one is called the 
probabilistic model and the other is known as the model of 2-
tuple fuzzy linguistic representations, are applied to solve 
multi-expert decision making issues (MEDM). A MEDM 
problem is considered, in which a group of physicians are 
independently asked about assessing the effectiveness of a set 
of treatment therapies for a prostate cancer patient. The 
objective of this paper is to find the most common judgment by 
means of these two models. Moreover, fuzzy linguistic terms 
are used to express the experts’ opinions and s-parametric 
membership functions are designed to depict the fuzzy 
linguistic terms.

 INTRODUCTION 
Multidisciplinary team conferences or multidisciplinary 
cancer conferences play a very important role in decision-
making process in modern treatment of cancer patients. In 
the Urology Department of Blekinge County Hospital, 
Karlskrona, the Multidisciplinary Team Conference (MDT) 
is a forum of health care providers including medical 
oncologists, urologists, urology sub-specialized nurses, 
radiologists and pathologists. The aim of the conference is to 
establish assessments and treatment decisions for particular 
patients with a spectrum of problematic urological conditions 
that cannot be easily solved by the means of available 
resources. Our long term aim is also to discuss the best and 
available treatment modalities of all newly diagnosed cases 
of prostate cancer. Quite often the decision making process is 
very clear and straight forward, but some cases lay outside 
the frames of guidelines and recommendations. Obviously 
the final choice of a treatment is also on discretion of the 
patient. This approach has two pitfalls. One of them is when 
there is a discrepancy between forum members and the other 
one is when the patient is not interested in the treatment 
modality chosen by the panel. The best solution is to obtain a 
method for solving discrepancy and simultaneously to find a 
method that shows the panel’s results as a treatment 
recommendation 
grade 
range 
between 
strongly 
recommended and contraindicated. Such approach should be 
very helpful in such diseases as a prostate cancer, which has 
a broad spectrum of treatment methods that can be tailored to 
the particular patient’s needs and requirements. 
 
In real life, we often are in such situations that we need to 
evaluate some information by means of numerical values. 
But when the numerical values are no longer available, then 
the linguistic approach [1] can be seen as a good alternative. 
Especially, in medical community, the information often is 
characterized vaguely and imprecisely, which makes it hard 
to be evaluated by numerical values. For example, the 
expressions such as “very painful”, “slightly painful”, 
“medium” and “not very painful” are just some examples of 
the linguistic evaluations of ache degrees of postoperative 
pain. Also in group decision making cases, when the experts 
assess the effectiveness of treatment therapies for prostate 
cancer 
patients, 
the 
semantic 
terms 
such 
as 
“contraindicated”, “doubtful”, “acceptable”, “possible”, 
“suitable”, “recommended” and “strongly recommended” 
can be used. Comparing to the numerical quantity, the 
linguistic approach is regarded by [2-3] as a more realistic, 
intuitionistic and natural method. Due to the advantages of 
the linguistic approach, an extensive application has been 
presented in the references [4-6]. 
 
By applying two models, namely, the probabilistic model 
and the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representations [7] we wish 
to select the most consensual treatment therapy for a prostate 
cancer patient in a multi-expert decision making (MEDM) 
problem. Thus, the entire process will be defined in the 
linguistic framework. 
 
The construction of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II the preliminaries are presented. In Section III a 
practical study about how these methods are applied for a 
prostate cancer patient is provided and the results are 
presented. Finally, conclusions and discussion are given in 
Section IV and V, respectively.

II. 
PRELIMINARIES 
In this section, some preliminary items are presented. 
We start with the detailed description of the probabilistic 
model. 
In reference [7], a general property of a MEDM problem 
is considered as the introduction of a finite set of experts 
denoted by   {       } who are asked for selecting 
assessments stated in another finite set of alternatives   
{       }. The assessments are expressed by semantic 
words in an order structured linguistic term set   
{       }, such that       if and only if k < l. An 
example of the ordered structured linguistic term set S is 
given below. 
 
Example 1: Suppose that we determine a linguistic term set 
  {                    } 
consisting 
of 
s0 
= 
“contraindicated” = CI,   =“doubtful”= D,   = “acceptable” 
= A,   = “possible” = P,    = “suitable” = S,    = 
“recommended” = R and   = “strongly recommended” = 
SR. 
A. The Probabilistic Model 
According to [7], the probability model mainly contains 
four steps: 
 
 
In the first step all the assessments are collected in a 
judgment table as shown in TABLE I. Here each 
judgment 
            
and 
        
is 
expressed by the linguistic term selected from the 
linguistic term set S.  
We should emphasize that each linguistic term is 
associated with a general s-parametric membership 
function [8-10] given by 
 
   ( )   
{
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  (  ((       )    )
  
)
 
    
(       )        (       
 )      
   (  (        )
  
)
 
    
(       
 )                
   (  (        )
  
)
 
    
           (       
 )      
 (  ((       )    )
  
)
 
    
(       
 )        (       )       
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) 
 
where   [   ] is a symbolic reference set of 
effectiveness,         and    is defined as the 
distance of the peaks between two adjacent fuzzy 
sets. If we set       and    as fixed values when

choosing        , then we will obtain the 
membership functions for        . 
 
 
    is assumed as a random preference value for 
each alternative           , with associated 
probablility distribution P defined by [11] as 
 
 (      )    ({    |      })  
 
(2) 
It is worth highlighting that the statement of random 
preference     is a crucial procedure in the approach 
of probability. Since each     is stochastically 
independent of each other, it will make the 
comparisons of any two random preferences to be 
possible.  
 
 
The choice value  (  ) for each alternative      
       is computed by the choice function 
implemented by 
 
 (  )  ∑  (       )
   
 
 ∑ ∑
[
 
 
 
 
 (      ) ∑  (       )
     
      
]
 
 
 
 
 
    
   
 
(3) 
 
where the quantity 
 (       ) could be 
interpreted as the probability of “the performance of 
   is as least as good as that of   ”.  
 
Finally, by ranking the choice values obtained by the 
former step, we can select the optimal one by (4)  
 
                ( (  )).

B. The Model of 2-tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Representation 
In this model, the physicians’ judgments of the 
treatments are represented by 2-tuples of the form of (    ), 
where      is a fuzzy semantic term and   [        ) 
is defined as a numerical value. 
A 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation 
model 
presented in [11] composes the following steps: 
 
 
Each judgment which is expressed by a fuzzy 
semantic word in TABLE I is changed into a 2-tuple 
fuzzy linguistic representation as (    ). If     , 
then (    ) will reflect   . Next,     {(    )} is 
defined as a finite set that consists of judgments of 
the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representations for each 
alternative           . 
 
 
Two transformations are used in this model.  
 
The 
first 
transform 
   
maps 
a 
2-tuple 
fuzzy 
representation (    )  which belongs to the space of 
  [        )  into a numerical value   [   ]. Here    
has the closest index label to  , and [   ] represents the 
interval consisting of the semantic label indices in the 
linguistic term set   {  }        . The action of    is 
formalized by 
 
             [        )    [   ] 
                               (    )         
 
Example 2: Let   {       } and   [   ]. In 
TABLE II the assessment of   , given by expert     is 
expressed by the fuzzy semantic term    = “acceptable” =A. 
By the 2-tuple fuzzy representation we can employ the 
judgment (A, 0) for    = “acceptable” =A and    .   
Due to the first transformation, the 2-tuple fuzzy 
representation of (A, 0) can be performed as a numerical 
value             , which belongs to the interval 
[0, 6].

The second transformation    can be regarded as an 
inverse of the first one, i.e., it maps a numerical value 
  [   ] into a 2-tuple (    ) by  
 
             [   ]    [        )

Example 3: Let   {       } and   [   ]. Suppose that 
       [   ]. Since 1.75 is closer to    than to   , then 
we choose    as the semantic word. The difference between 
1.75 and 2 is 0.25, and 1.75 lies to the left of 2. Therefore, 
we choose –0.25 to be the value of  . By means of the 
second transformation,   (    )  (        ), which is 
depicted in Fig 1. 
 
 
The third step contains the computation of the 
arithmetic mean of  ̅  
  of 2-tuples for each 
alternative           . This 
is based on 
transformations ∆1 and ∆2 involved in 
 
 ̅  
    (∑  
 
 
   
  (    ))  
(5) 
 
Since the arithmetic means, supplied from the previous 
step, are presented by 2-tuples, a computational technique to 
compare the arithmetic mean for each alternative proposed in 
[11] is given as follows. 
 
 
Let (     ) and (     ) be two 2-tuples fuzzy 
linguistic representations, with each one representing 
a counting of information as follows: 
 
1) if    , then (     ) is smaller than (     ). 
2) if    , then 
if      , 
then 
(     ) 
and 
(     ) 
represents the same information. 
if      , then (     ) is smaller than 
(     )  
if      , then (     ) is greater than 
(     )  
 
 
At last, by comparing the arithmetic values with 
each other and ranking the alternatives, the optimal 
alternative(s) will be obtained. 
III. 
A PRACTICAL STUDY 
In this section we want to present a practical study in 
medical group decision making task. The members of a 
physician group are asked for providing the opinions on 
some treatment schemes for a prostate cancer patient. The 
methods of probabilistic model and the 2-tuple fuzzy 
linguistic model are applied and the results are presented. 
A. The Probabilistic Model 
Let us suppose that   {           }  denotes a 
collection consisting of four physicians. And another set

  {                 } contains sex types of treatment 
schemes for a prostate cancer patient, where   = “wait and 
see”,   = “active monitoring”,   = “symptom based 
treatment”,    = “brachytherapy”,    = “external beam 
radiation therapy” and   = “radical prostatectomy”. Also, 
  {                     } includes seven linguistic terms, 
in which   = “contraindicated”,   = “doubtful”,   = 
“acceptable”,   = “possible”,    = “suitable”,   = 
“recommended” and   = “strongly recommended”.  
By inserting       ,          and l = 0 in (1), we 
obtain the function for     “contraindicated” expanded by

The value of 5 indicates the choice value of    to be 
maximal. This means that the second therapy alternative is 
the most efficacious. 
We want to confirm the result by applying the model of 
2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representations. 
B. The Model of 2-tuple Linguistic Representation 
According to the algorithm for the model of 2-tuple 
fuzzy representation, the judgment which is transformed 
into 2-tuples is given in TABLE VI.

We calculate the arithmetic mean for the first alternative 
   by means of (5). 
    {(    ) (    ) (    ) (    )} 
is 
a 
finite 
set 
consisting of four 2-tuple linguistic representations for the 
alternative   . By adopting (5), the arithmetic means value 
for    is calculated as: 
 ̅  
    ( 
 (       ))    ( )  (      )  
 
For the second alternative the arithmetic means value is 
given as follows: 
 ̅  
    ( 
 (       ))    (   )  (      )  
 
By the same reasoning, when setting i = 3,4,5,6 in (5), 
we implement

According to the computational technique presented 
earlier, we compare the above 2-tuples which represent the 
arithmetic values for all the alternatives. We obtain the 
result presented as                  , which 
shows that alternative    is the most efficacious treatment 
scheme. This result converges to the previous result from 
“the probabilistic model”. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper two models, like the probabilistic model 
and the model of 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representations, 
have been applied in a MEDM problem to find the most 
consensual treatment scheme for a prostate cancer patient. 
The convergence results from both of the approaches verify 
the high reliability of adopting the linguistic approach in 
solving group decision making problems. Moreover, the 
independent assumed preferences of each alternative make 
the computation of comparing the probabilities easy to be 
performed. Especially, the use of the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic 
representation model prevents the loss of information and 
makes the result more precise. At last but not at least, the 
use of s-parametric membership functions not only makes 
the fuzzy sets intuitionistic, but also increases the accuracy 
rate of the comparative analysis. Having discovered the 
hierarchy of therapies we also wish to utilize the formulas of 
membership functions to assign the group decision efficacy 
of each treatment to an expression from the list suggested. 
We treat this query as a challenge in our future research. 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
From the medical point of view, we found both methods 
very interesting in decision-making process when panelists 
were not unanimous. The results seem to be reasonable. The 
process of sampling the data by filling the questionnaires 
was easy and quickly accomplished. We hope to introduce 
one of the models in our clinical practice to assess the 
method in a real life conditions. Hopefully, this approach 
can allow us to find better treatment strategies and to give 
prostate cancer patients more flexibility concerning the 
treatment options. This should be a great complement to the 
current guidelines and scientific society recommendations.
