Abstract—Business 
leads 
generation 
is 
a 
crucial 
and 
challenging task for online business to attract customers and 
improve their services.  This paper presents a case study of an 
online real estate service company which provides potential 
home 
buyers 
useful 
neighborhood 
information, 
and 
accordingly offers them business leads to real estate 
companies. The company’s current business lead generation is 
based on a “brute-force” method which requires tedious 
manual efforts. We developed an automatic business lead 
generation system which includes data integration as well as 
data mining tasks of classification and association rule mining. 
We demonstrated through experiments that this system can 
empower online real estate service companies to quickly and 
effectively generate targeted business leads.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Over the past three decades, there has been a significant 
change in which information was collected, disseminated, 
and used. Form the customers' point of view, the information 
overload that they experience on a daily basis can hinder 
their decisions when selecting products and services to 
purchase. From the business organizations' point of view, the 
vast array of products and services being offered has made 
data mining a critical competitive advantage. Data mining 
techniques allow business organizations to improve their 
services and attract more customers. This paper presents a 
case study of business lead generation for an on-line real 
estate service company through data integration and data 
mining. A business lead, also referred to as a lead for 
simplicity, is defined as a potential sales contact, i.e., a 
potential customer who expresses an interest in the 
company’s products or services [2]. 
In the real estate research literature, a recent study shows 
that almost 80% of home buyers start a home search online 
[8]. There are many online real estate service companies that 
provide potential home buyers useful neighborhood 
information, and accordingly provide them business leads to 
real estate companies. We conducted a study on a Canadian 
based online real estate service company. Currently, the lead 
products being offered by the company are based on a 
“brute-force” method which requires tedious manual efforts. 
There is no automatic lead generation system available on 
the market that could empower the company to quickly and 
effectively generate leads. 
This paper proposes a business lead generation system 
which is capable of identifying effective landing pages on 
the websites of online real estate service companies. A 
landing page, also referred to as a lead capture page, is a web 
page to be displayed in response to clicking on an online 
advertisement which is posted on the Internet, either on the 
website of an online real estate service company or on a 
third-party website. For an online real estate service 
company, these landing pages may generate leads as 
potential home buyers may leave contact information on 
them. Data mining techniques such as classification and 
association rule mining are employed for lead generation. 
The proposed automatic lead generation system can help 
the online real estate service company to increase revenue by 
selling more leads to real estate companies. It will also equip 
the real estate service company with a platform to reduce the 
cost of generating leads. Fig. 1 shows the business model of 
a typical online real estate service company:

company. 
 
Most of the users visit the online real estate service 
company’s site through search engines or third-party 
websites where the company’s advertisements are posted. 
While visiting the company’s website, the users are exposed 
to a landing page. If a user visits the landing page and  leaves 
his/her contact information then, the user is considered as a 
lead. On the other hand, if a user leaves the site at any point 
during their visit, the user is considered as non-lead. 
To attract users, landing pages are designed carefully by 
considering the text size, style, color and contain various 
business offers and rewards. Generally, more than one 
landing pages are used to attract various user groups. The 
biggest challenge is how to provide the right landing page to 
the right user so that the user can become a lead.

RELATED WORK 
Currently, there are no lead generation tools available on 
the market. One of the main difficulties is due to large 
volume of data, which are distributed into several sources. 
This large volume of distributed data needs to be integrated 
into a single source before conducting any analysis. The data 
also needs to be transformed into a suitable format for data 
mining tasks to discover leads and non-leads. 
In the research literature, automatic lead generation has 
been studied in a few cases for typical B2B and B2C types of 
e-commerce. [7] studied automatic sales lead generation 
based on online customers’ survey, and [5][11] studied lead 
generation based on online customers’ purchasing patterns.  
An online real estate service company differs from typical 
B2B or B2C e-commerce companies because it acts like a 
broker between the real estate companies and potential home 
buyers.  To our best knowledge, there is no previous research 
on business lead generation for online real estate service 
companies. 
 
III. 
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
For lead generation two major data mining tasks are 
involved in this system: Association rules mining and 
Classification. Association rule generation is a method for 
discovering interesting relationships among various item sets 
in a dataset and classification is the task of discovering a 
model first and applying it to predicate a new data object into 
one of the several classes of a predetermined target. 
The system architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2. At first, 
the proposed system will gather all available data from the 
application.  The primary data sources are the server log 
files, which include web server access logs and application 
server logs. Some additional data are also essential for both 
data preparation and pattern discovery, including the site 
files and meta-data, operational databases, application 
templates, and domain knowledge.  
After gathering data from all the required sources, the 
web data will go through a pre-processing phase to clean the 
data by removing irrelevant or redundant entries from the 
data sets. Following the pre-processing phase, the data will 
be formatted appropriately according to the application 
business model. After formatting, the log data will be 
converted into a form suitable for data-mining task. The 
transformation will be accomplished according to the 
transaction model for that particular task (i.e., classification 
or association rule mining). Finally, after discovering   the 
hidden statistics patterns from the data, the new discovered 
knowledge will be evaluated and filtered to only keep those 
which are statistically sound and novel to the business.

DATA MODEL DESIGN AND DATA INTEGRATION 
Data model design is a critical step for data warehousing 
and data mining. It mainly involves four steps: identifying 
relevant datasets, feature selection, data integration and data 
transformation. 
The current data repository setup, for our study of the 
online real estate service company, contains 3 datasets, 
which hold information for the period of January to June 
2011. The “Dataset 1” contains the data pertaining to what 
users’ actions were while browsing the website. This dataset 
also contains information about landing page visits where 
users’ preferences about home buying/selling were 
recorded. The “Dataset 2” and “Dataset 3” contain search 
type information such as whether a user searched for 
schools, banks, and other retailers while searching for a 
home or neighborhood, as well as which ads were served. 
The “Dataset 2” also contains more detailed information 
about each search (e.g., search strings, referrer pages, user 
agent or browser used). A summary of these datasets is 
shown in Table 1.

“Dataset 1” is dynamically generated in such a way that a 
new data instance is created for every different action 
performed by an user and the properties of a particular 
instance depends on the action of the user (i.e., submitting 
form, searching etc). In other words, the dataset contains 
many data instances for one user if the user performs more 
than one action. Therefore, this dataset is a semi-structured 
table in which one field may contain different types of 
information, and for one user there might be various 
numbers of rows associated with them.  For data mining 
purposes, we 
normalized this table, combined all 
information related to one user into one single row, and then   
selected a fixed number of representative fields, which 
contain useful information for data mining. 
Based on our analysis on user activity flows, we have 
divided the users into two groups and created a separate data 
model for each group.  The two groups are “General User 
Data Model” and “Landing Page User Data Model”.  
Landing page users are important and treated specially since 
they are more likely to become leads and they have more 
information recorded in the dataset. 
A. General User Data Model 
The general user data model covers all users including 
both the leads users and the non-leads users. The purpose of 
this data model is to form a single integrated dataset, which 
contains all activities of all users, i.e., including who did not 
reach any landing pages, as well as the activities of the users 
prior to reaching any landing pages. Table 2 shows the 
features for the general user data model. 
Furthermore, to facilitate data mining tasks such as 
classification, we artificially created a new field “landing 
page related” to indicate whether the user eventually reached 
landing page and whether the user eventually became a lead. 
This new field is for the purpose of differentiating landing-
page-users from non-landing-page-users, and differentiating 
leads from non-leads. Specifically, we use an integer value 
for the “landing page related” field. We assign the value “-1” 
for users who did not reach the landing page, “0” for non-
leads users who reached the landing page, and “1” for leads.

We selected 19 features for the landing page user data 
model, which belong to 6 categories: activities before 
reaching website, activities on website (before landing page), 
landing page information, user information, lead or not, and 
additional information. 
As shown in Table 3, most of the features are landing 
page related features, which do not exist for users who did 
not reach a landing page. Having separate data models can 
facilitate data mining tasks such as classification and 
association rule mining. 
C. Data Integration Design and Implementation 
     We integrated the data from different sources into a 
single dataset for data mining. For each of the data models, 
we need to generate the integrated dataset. The data 
integration consists of two steps: 
1.  Integrate features from different tables into one table. 
2.  Integrate multiple rows which are related to one user into 
one row.

     For Step 1, because the three original datasets (i.e., 
Dataset 1, Dataset 2 and Dataset 3) share a common id, we 
used that common id to join all tables.  In Step 2, users’ 
sessions were identified and all the activities during a single 
session were integrated into a single instance. The detailed 
algorithm is as follows and the corresponding flow chart is 
depicted in Fig. 3.  
 
Algorithm: 
Step 1: All Landing Page visits are identified. 
Step 2: For each Landing Page visit, attributes are checked 
to identify whether this user has activities on the website’s 
search page or not. If the user has search activities on the 
website’s search page, all search related attributes are 
extracted for this user, if there is no search activity 
performed by the user, the program move to next step. 
Step 3: User session is identified from “Dataset 1”. 
Step 4: All required attributes, for data model, are extracted 
from each row within the session. 
Step 5: All extracted attributes, from a session, are stored in 
a new table within a single row where each single row hold 
data for only one session. 
At the end, if all sessions are identified and data extraction 
is completed then the integrated file is generated for data 
mining purposes.

DATA MINING AND EXPERIMENTS 
We carried out data mining tasks of classification and 
association rule mining on the integrated datasets to identify 
effective landing pages and generate rules for leads. 
A. 
Classification 
The goal of classification is to find out whether a user 
profile belongs to lead user group, or non-lead user group. 
The output of our classification rule mining algorithm is a 
decision tree, in which the user models are represented as 
sets of rules for lead users and non-lead users. These rules 
can then be used to analyze the behavior patterns of the two 
groups of users. In this research, the classification algorithm 
C4.5 is applied to generate decision trees [9][6]. 
Fig. 4 shows an example of the decision tree generated by 
the C4.5 algorithm. We use the landing page version to 
show how decision tree can help to select the right landing 
page for right user. For example, landing page “lp11” has 
100% lead turn out for the users who visit the site using 
advertisement named “X” and contain home buying price 
range for 200-400k. On the other hand, 90% of users who 
visit landing page “lp11”, using advertisement for “Z” with 
the same price range, become non-leads. Clearly, for this 
category of users, “lp11” is not working well in terms of 
generating lead. 
Using the decision tree, the company can analyze which 
landing page is working well for a specific category of users   
instead of choosing landing page randomly. In addition, the 
landing page can also be preselected based on the 
performance rate in converting users to leads.

Association rule mining 
    In data mining, association rule generation [10] is used 
94

for discovering interesting relationships among various item 
sets of a dataset. We used association rule mining to find 
useful relationships among the user activities, landing pages 
and advertisements information of the company. 
    Association rules can be expressed in the form X => Y 
where X and Y are two disjoint subsets of all available 
items. We used the Apriori algorithm [1] to generate 
association rules.  The algorithm can generate large quantities 
of patterns from the data, however most of which are of no 
interest. To remove the uninteresting rules, interestingness 
measurements techniques are applied to the result sets.  Two 
commonly used measures are support rate (supp) and 
confidence rate (conf), which are defined as the following: 
• Support rate of X  => Y:  The percentage of transactions in 
dataset containing both X and Y. Support(X,Y) = P(XY). 
• Confidence rate of X => Y: The percentage of transactions 
containing  X and also containing Y. Confidence(X,Y) = 
P(Y|X). 
    However, the combination of support and confidence 
measurements 
are insufficient 
at 
filtering 
out 
the 
uninteresting association rules [4]. As a result, another 
measurement technique, “Lift” [3], is applied. Lift value is 
equivalent to the ratio of the confidence of the rule and the 
expected confidence of the rule. The formula for measuring 
the lift can be expressed as : Lift (X, Y) = P(Y) / 
P(X)*P(Y). 
    The value of Lift can be from 0 to infinity and can be 
interpret in the following way: 
 
If the value is greater than 1 then the rule (X=>Y) 
occurs more often than expected, which means that 
the occurrence of the rule body(Y) has a positive 
impact on the occurrence of the rule head(X). 
 
If  the value is smaller than 1 then the  rule  
(X=>Y) occurs less often together than expected, 
which means that the occurrence of the rule 
body(Y) has a negative impact on the occurrence 
of the rule head(X). 
 
If  the value is near 1 then the rule (X=>Y) occurs 
almost as often together as expected, which means 
that the occurrence of the rule body(Y) has almost 
no effect on the occurrence of the rule head(X). 
     In our experiment, we set the support threshold to be 
0.10 and Lift threshold to be greater than 1 to filter all 
positively correlated rules. To compare the effectiveness of 
the rules in terms of interestingness measures, both Lift and 
Confidence values are calculated for each rule. Some 
examples of the association rules are shown in Fig. 5.   
The first rule shows that the users from “ON” (ip 
location, ON means Ontario, which is a province in 
Canada), who visited the site through advertisement “X” are 
more attracted to landing page version 10 and website page 
“page3”. Therefore, the landing page “lp10” proved to be a 
high lead conversion page for users with iplocation “ON” 
and who visit the site through advertisement “X”.

Figure 5. Association rules generated from landing page data set 
 
Rule number 7 shows that users whose referrer is “search 
engine x” and visit website’s “page 3” are more attracted to 
landing page “lp0”. 
This knowledge can be used by the online real estate 
service company to increase the sales lead from different 
interest of users. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presented a framework for business lead 
generation in the area of online real estate services via a 
business case study. The framework includes data model 
design, data integration from multiple sources, data mining, 
and lead pattern evaluation. The results of classification rules 
can tell which groups of users are more likely to become 
leads, so that the corresponding pages/ads on the website 
may be emphasized for attracting those users. The 
association rules provide useful information for web 
designers, in that the togetherness of certain association 
patterns are important and the correlations among attributes 
in terms of desired target analysis. The knowledge base of 
lead generation should be updated periodically in order to 
best support business practices. In future research, the web 
page content data may be combined with web click stream 
data together form  improving the lead generation results. 
This system may also be extended to build a real time lead 
generation system, which can select the most effective 
landing page by matching the user’s request and the existing 
knowledge base.  In addition, more rigorous experiments can 
be conducted to compare different data mining approaches
