Abstract—The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing is 
one of the widely used modulation techniques in the present 
broadband wireless technology. The opportunities and 
challenges of this modulation technique are derived from its 
native advantages and disadvantages. One of the main 
problems is the high peak-to-average power ratio of 
transmission signal due to the superposition of many 
subcarriers. This paper presents a new hybrid peak-to-average 
power ratio reduction technique, which combines an active 
constellation extension method with a tone reservation method.  
The paper presents the performance and advantages of the 
mixed technique and compares it with other existing methods. 
The simulations shown that the proposed technique realizes an 
increased peak-to-average power ratio reduction compared to 
component methods with similar parameters.

 INTRODUCTION 
The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing 
(OFDM) is one of the most efficient and popular modulation 
techniques used in broadband wireless communication 
systems like Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave 
Access (WiMAX), Terrestrial Digital Video Broadcast 
(DVB-T), or wireline systems like Asymmetric Digital 
Subscriber Line (ADSL). One of the main practical issues of 
the OFDM is the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of 
the transmitted signal. This high PAPR occurs because of the 
time-domain superposition of the many data subcarriers 
which compose the OFDM signal. Due to the large number 
of subcarriers, the resulting time-domain signal exhibits 
Rayleigh-like 
characteristics 
and 
large 
time-domain 
amplitude variations. These large signal peaks require the 
high power amplifiers (HPA) to support wide linear dynamic 
range. 
Higher signal level causes non-linear distortions leading 
to an inefficient operation of HPA causing intermodulation 
products resulting unwanted out-of-band power. In order to 
reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals, many solutions have 
been proposed and analyzed. The efficiency of these 
methods can be evaluated considering their characteristics of 
non-linearity, amount of processing and size of side 
information needed to be sent to receiver. 
The class of linear methods is represented by approaches 
like partial transmit sequence (PTS) [2], selective mapping 
(SLM) [1], and tone reservation (TR) [5]. 
In the SLM method, based on a set of predefined phase 
arrays, several vector rotations of the original frequency 
domain OFDM signal are performed. For each variant 
obtained by rotations, the corresponding PAPR is evaluated. 
The variant with the lowest PAPR is chosen for the 
transmission. 
A similar approach is applied in case of PTS method, 
where the N complex values representing the OFDM signal 
symbols are grouped into K sub-blocks of N/K symbols. The 
case of blocks with contiguous carriers has the advantage of 
simplicity and it is more suitable for detection systems. The 
case of non-contiguous carrier blocks offers better peak 
factor (PF) reduction capability at the cost of extra 
complexity. The method generates a set of signal derivates 
by rotating the symbols from each block with one phase 
from a given set of K phases with values from a given finite 
set. Then, after calculation of the corresponding PAPR of 
each signal variant, the one with minimal PAPR is chosen 
for the transmission. 
Both methods provide efficient PAPR reduction, having 
the drawback of additional side information required to be 
sent to receiver. Another disadvantage of these methods is 
that the complexity of computation is increasing with the 
number of phase set and block number. 
Optimizations of these methods have been proposed in 
several papers [3][4]. 
Another PAPR reduction method is tone reservation 
(TR), which uses a set of reserved set of subcarriers (tones) 
to generate signals with lower PAPR level. Besides the 
advantage of no additional distortion, this method also 
doesn’t need to transmit additional information to the 
receiver. Because not all subcarriers are used to transmit 
useful information, this method is considered to lower the 
data rate of the OFDM-based systems. 
Since the development of the original tone reservation 
method, in order to reduce the computation complexity and 
to improve the performance, several derivate techniques have

been proposed: selective mapping of partial tones (SMOPT) 
[6], One-Tone One-Peak (OTOP) [7] and one-by-one 
iteration [8]. 
Another optimized variant of this method proposes to 
generate tones for the K largest peaks of the signal. The 
phases of these tones are chosen to be opposite to φj+nπ/2, 
where φj is the phase of the identified peaks, j=1, 2, …, K 
and n=0, 1, 2, 3. The procedure is iterated until convergence 
reaches the expected threshold [5]. 
The class of non-linear methods is represented by 
approaches like active constellation extension (ACE), 
clipping, partial clipping, and signal compression. 
The ACE method change the original OFDM signal by 
modifying amplitude and phase of tones whose base band 
modulation symbol is an outer point of the constellation. 
Those 
outer 
signaling 
points 
of 
the 
conventional 
constellation are dynamically moved toward outside of the 
original constellation in order to reduce the PAPR level of 
the transmitted signal. The domain for allowed alternative 
points is chosen so that the signal processing does not reduce 
the constellation’s minimum-distance but lowers the PAPR 
level [15][17]. 
For additional PAPR reduction, some proposed derivate 
methods consider outers points projection onto squares or 
circles around all the QAM constellation points and 
intentional distortion within the allowed bounds. The 
tradeoff between level of the constellation distortion and 
PAPR level is analyzed and optimized as well [16]. 
The clipping method is another well known non-linear 
PAPR reduction technique, where the amplitude of the signal 
is limited to a given threshold. Taking in consideration the 
fact that the signal must be interpolated before A/D 
conversion, a variety of clipping methods has been proposed. 
Some methods suggest the clipping before interpolation, 
having the disadvantage of the peaks regrowth. Other 
methods suggest the clipping after interpolation, having the 
disadvantage of out-of-band power production. In order to 
overcome this problem different filtering techniques have 
been proposed. Filtering can also cause peak regrowth, but 
less than the clipping before interpolation [9].  
Another 
clipping 
technique 
supposes 
that 
only 
subcarriers having the highest phase difference between the 
original signal and its clipped variant will be changed. This 
is the case of the partial clipping (PC) method [10]. 
For additional PAPR reduction, some papers proposed µ-
law/A-law 
companding 
functions 
[13], 
exponential 
companding function [12], piecewise-scales [11] 
or 
polynomial ratio functions [14] after the clipping. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second 
section describes the OFDM signal, some of its properties, 
and some aspects of the high power amplifier. The third 
section describes the proposed hybrid PAPR reduction 
scheme. In the fourth section is described the clipping 
method as PAPR reduction method of reference. Next, the 
numerical results highlighted by the computer simulation are 
presented and discussed in the fifth section. Based on the 
obtained results, some conclusions are presented in the sixth 
section. 
 
II. 
THE OFDM SIGNAL 
In an OFDM-based system, the signal samples are 
grouped in blocks of N symbols, {Xn, n=0,1,…,N-1}, which 
are modulating a set of N subcarriers, with frequencies {fn, 
n=0,1,…,N-1}. These subcarriers are chosen to be 
orthogonal, that is fn=n∆f, where ∆f=1/T, and T is the OFDM 
symbol period. The resulting signal can be written as:

=
=

X e

. 
(1) 
In order to avoid the intersymbol interference (ISI) 
generated by the multipath channels, each signal period is 
extended with a fraction from itself, corresponding to a guard 
interval. After Digital-to-Analogue (D/A) conversion, the 
signal is applied to the modulator. Next, the resulted signal is 
applied to a high-power amplifier (HPA) which drives the 
antenna load. 
At the receiver, after demodulation, the guard will be 
removed, the symbols being evaluated for a time interval of 
[0,T]. 
Time domain samples of the low-pass OFDM signals in 
the complex domain are appreciatively Gaussian distributed 
due to statistical independence of subcarriers. Due to this 
fact, sporadically, the signal presents peaks, which cause the 
PAPR problem. The expression of the PAPR for a given 
OFDM signal block is given by:

Another quality measure refers to the non-linearity of the 
transmitted signal which is produced by the HPA. This is the

been proposed. One of the well known models is the Saleh 
Model, which is described by the following input-output 
equations:

The optimal solution for PAPR problem may not be the 
best solution for the SDR problem and vice versa. Because 
these two problems are correlated, in practice a suboptimal 
solution may be chosen [15]. 
III. 
THE HYBRID METHOD 
The proposed hybrid PAPR reduction technique is 
obtained by serialization of active constellation extension 
method and sequential tone reservation method. 
The main idea for combining the two methods is relying 
on the observation that the cumulative signal processing for 
PAPR reduction will increase the overall performance. 
Furthermore, the idea is based on the fact that each of the 
considered methods is based on a different principle. One 
performs a controlled signal distortion and the other realizes 
different changes of the non-data subcarriers. 
The block diagram of the proposed method is presented 
in Figure 2. The performance of the proposed PAPR 
reduction technique is analyzed with a MATLAB simulator 
as presented in Figure 3. Within this simulator, the samples 
from the generated signal are mapped from binary 
representation to the M-QAM or M-PSK constellation 
points. The obtained complex values are grouped in blocks 
of N elements each, forming the OFDM symbols. 
The obtained OFDM frames are applied to the PAPR 
reduction blocks. For a better performance comparison, 
besides the proposed ACE-TR method, additionally the 
clipping method [9] is taken into consideration.

The PAPR reduction blocks alter the original signal. Due 
to this fact, for evaluation of communication’s performance 
and efficiency, the simulator estimates the bit error rate 
(BER) and power spectral density (PSD) for the signal 
obtained after processing for PAPR reduction.

The ACE method requires both time-domain and 
frequency-domain signal processing. As already mentioned, 
the main idea of this method is to shift the outer 
constellation points toward exterior of original constellation 
generating an alternative representation of the same symbol. 
The allowed domains for these outer points are presented in 
Figure 4, when 16-QAM is used as base band modulation. 
The boundaries of these domains are constrained by the 
constellation’s minimum-distance. The reason for this 
limitation is to prevent a decrease of BER performance at 
the receiver. 
In the present work, the ACE was implemented according 
with the following algorithm [15]: 
1) Starting with a block of N data symbols Xo, representing a 
frequency domain OFDM frame; 
2) Apply IFFT to get the corresponding time-domain signal 
representation x[n]. 
3) Clip any sample which satisfies the condition: [ ]

4) Apply FFT to obtain the frequency-domain representation 
X~ of the previous time-domain clipped signal x~ ; 
5) Enforce all ACE constraints on X~  by restoring the 
original values for all inner points and limit the values for 
all outer points to reside within their corresponding 
extended domains as already mentioned; 
6) Return to step 2 and iterate the algorithm until the 
maximum number of iterations is reached or the PAPR level 
decreased until a given threshold. 
 
 
Figure 5.  ACE outer point enforcing. Exemplification for 16-QAM. 
In order to apply the ACE constraints for the outer points 
of the constellation, their corresponding vectors must be 
changed. Depending on their relative location versus the 
location of the original point and on the allowed extended 
domain, the algorithm may change vector’s amplitude or 
phase or both. 
A solution would be to rotate the vector until the outer point 
enters back into corresponding extended domain. When this 
operation is not enough, the vector’s amplitude can be 
increased accordingly. 
In the present work, in order to reduce the computation 
complexity, the ACE constraints are applied by checking 
and changing the Cartesian coordinates separately. The 
present algorithm considers the constellation’s minimum-
distance dmin, the distance between two adjacent extended 
domains dspa, the coordinate of the original outer point, and 
the coordinate of the actual point obtained after clipping. 
When the in-phase or quadrature value is under the 
threshold indicated by the corresponding domain border, the 
difference dext is added to shift the point back into its 
domain. This approach is presented in Figure 5. For the case 
of the M-PSK modulation, the ACE constraint is applied 
using a similar approach. The difference is that for the M-
PSK case, all constellation points can be used to lower the 
PAPR, and their corresponding extended domains are 
represented by radial sectors with the angular size of 
2π/ M
radians.  
Next, the obtained frequency-domain signal is applied to 
the tone reservation method, which is presented in Figure 6. 
It selects T pilot tones positions from a complete set of Q 
no-data carrier positions and a set of M complex values, 
forming a set of MT possible combinations. 
This search space may lead to an increased amount of 
data computation. The chosen tone reservation algorithm 
decreases the computation complexity by attempting a 
reduced search space by trying all M values on the first pilot 
P[0], while the other pilots, P[1],…,P[T-1], have a 
“randomized” or zero initial state. Once an optimal value is 
found, a similar procedure is repeated on the other pilot 
positions. For further computation complexity reduction, the 
time-domain signals equivalent for all pilot tones can be 
computed and stored initially into memory. In this case, 
more operations are done in time-domain, fact which 
determines a decreased number of FFT operations [5].

Because the TR method operates on some subcarriers 
from the frequency-domain signal, the displacement of these 
non-data subcarriers may impact the method’s performance. 
Depending by position, the allocation of the reserved 
subcarriers may be symmetrical or lateral occupying the 
lower or higher part of the signal’s spectrum. The 
considered variants are presented in Figures 7 and 8.  
When the TR block follows after the ACE block, as 
Figure 2 indicates, the interfacing of these blocks has to be 
properly adapted. 
Both PAPR reduction blocks have to operate on the same 
signal. Therefore, in order to have same frequency spectrum, 
the non-data subcarriers used within TR block has to be 
available at the ACE block’s input.  
The ACE block performs a nonlinear signal processing, 
which will affect the non-data subcarriers as well. Because 
these subcarriers are not carrying any information, they have 
no ACE constraints as method requires for the constellation 
points of the data subcarriers. From the ACE perspective 
these non-data subcarriers have the optimal value for 
lowering PAPR. 
Contrary, the TR block will change the values of these 
non-data subcarriers in order to search an OFDM alternative 
signal with a decreased PAPR. Because some of these 
subcarriers will provide no improvement from the PAPR 
reduction point of view, the initial value set of the ACE 
block has to be considered. 
In order to make the proper adaptation, the TR 
constellation point set of each non-data subcarrier has to 
include the initial value obtained after previous signal 
processing performed by the ACE block. 
IV. 
THE CLIPPING METHOD 
 For analysis of the efficiency of the proposed hybrid 
technique, also a pure nonlinear method has been 
considered. This is the clipping method with frequency-
domain filtering as presented in [9]. The block diagram of 
this method is presented in Figure 10. It consists in a zero 
padding block, an IFFT block, an effective clipping block, 
and a frequency domain block. For a frequency-domain 
input signal represented by a vector Ain with N elements 
[a0,…,aN-1] and an oversampling factor p, the zero padding 
inserts N(p-1) zeros in the middle of this vector, forming the 
new vector Azp. The clipping block limits the amplitude of 
the time-domain signal to a given threshold. The resulted 
signal aclp is then applied to the frequency domain filter 
where the output signal aout is obtained.

The clipping ratio (CR) applied in this method is defined as 
ratio of the clipping level A to the root-mean-square power σ 
of the unclipped baseband signal,

The filtering block is composed by an FFT block, another 
zero padding block and an IFFT block. It is designated to 
reduce the out-of-band noise without distorting the in-band 
discrete signal. 
V. 
NUMERICAL RESULTS 
The MATLAB simulations have been performed for 
base-band signals with N=128 subcarriers using M-QAM 
and M-PSK modulations. The frequency-domain signal is 
extended with additional Q=24 no-data subcarriers. From 
this set, T=12 subcarriers are used for PAPR reduction by 
the TR method. The corresponding constellation consists in 
sets of M=16 points. For the reference clipping method, the 
simulation considers the clipping rate CR having some 
values in the range of 6-14 and the oversampling factor p set 
to 2.  
For the OFDM signal spectrum computation, it was 
considered that the distance between two adjacent 
subcarriers is 0.2 MHz.

The results presented in this paper are obtained for OFDM 
frames with the repartition of non-data subcarriers as 
previously indicated in Figures 7, 8, and 9, with 
constellations of the pilot search space points identically with 
the constellations of the constellation used for data carriers.  
The numerical results show that the proposed scheme 
improves the PAPR reduction in comparison with the use of 
only one of the component methods. This improvement is 
highlighted in this section with three cases. 
In the first case, Figures 11 and 14 indicate the PAPR 
reduction and signal’s frequency spectrum when the OFDM 
frame has the non-data subcarriers configuration as 
presented in Figure 7. 
In Figure 11, it can be observed that the ACE method 
performs a better PAPR reduction while the applied TR 
method obtains a lower PAPR reduction than the clipping at 
a ratio of CR=12. A slight difference can be observed 
between the ACE applied on the initial OFDM frame and 
the extended OFDM frame containing the reserved non-data 
subcarriers. The hybrid ACE-TR provides better PAPR 
reduction since it accumulates the effects from the two 
methods. 
Due to the insertion of the additional non-data subcarriers 
on the both sides of the original spectrum, the obtained 
signal presents an increased bandwidth as indicated in 
Figure 14.  
In the second case, Figures 12 and 15 indicate the PAPR 
reduction and signal’s frequency spectrum for the 
configuration shown in Figure 8.  
Due to a different displacement of the non-data 
subcarriers; the TR method has a different efficiency for the 
PAPR reduction. Even if this method has smaller PAPR 
reduction, with the hybrid method still higher PAPR 
reduction is obtained. Also, this case presents a smaller 
increase of the bandwidth for the resulted OFDM signal than 
the one from the previous one. 
In the third case, similarly, Figures 13 and 16 indicate the 
same signal parameters when the non-data subcarriers are 
located as is shown in Figure 9.  
For the PAPR reduction, this case is quite similar with the 
first one. The difference consists on the spectrum of the 
resulted signal, which has a slightly asymmetrical shape. 
Figure 17 shows that the BER performance is slightly 
influenced by the proposed PAPR reduction technique, being 
better than in case of simple clipping.  
For a better evaluation of the performance of the 
proposed method, the PAPR reduction and corresponding 
BER characteristic of the clipping method are presented in 
Figure 18 and Figure 19, respectively. 
The simulations shown that, if smaller values for the 
clipping ratio are considered, the clipping method obtains 
comparable PAPR reduction as the hybrid method do. 
The drawback of this case is that the smaller CR values 
imply an increased signal distortion, and so a worst BER 
performance. 
Therefore the presented numerical results shown that, in 
all cases, the hybrid ACE-TR method provides better PAPR

reduction than in case of use of only one component 
method. 
Additionally, 
compared 
with 
clipping, 
the 
combined technique presents no degradation of the BER 
performance. 
The computational complexity of the algorithm of the 
hybrid technique is given by the sum of the computational 
complexity of the component methods. 
The ACE block performs one IFFT, one clip, one FFT and 
one vector shift per iteration. For the present simulations, we 
have limited the number of iterations in the ACE block to 
one, therefore the amount of operations for this block 
is

The TR block performs one change for a pilot subcarrier

In practice, the amount of operations can be reduced if the 
time-domain signal corresponding to each single non-data 
subcarrier is pre-computed and stored in a nonvolatile 
memory. In this case the amount of operations is reduced to

Based on these expressions, it can be observed that the 
amount of operations required by the hybrid method is 
bigger than the number of operations required by other 
PAPR reduction techniques and depends by number of data 
subcarriers and the size of the search space used by the TR 
block.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we proposed a new PAPR reduction 
technique based on the combination of an active 
constellation extension method with a tone reservation 
method. 
The paper presents the ACE and TR algorithms used within 
the hybrid technique. The interfacing of the two PAPR 
reduction blocks is also explained. 
The simulation results show that the hybrid scheme 
realizes higher PAPR reduction for various OFDM frame 
formats. Similar results for PAPR reduction have been 
obtained for the case when TR block precedes the ACE 
block.  
The two methods considered have various derivates, 
bringing different efficiency and performance. The ACE 
method may be implemented using different constellation 
restrictions, obtaining different PAPR reduction levels and 
BER performances. The TR method may use different set of 
values for the non-data subcarriers. Depending on this set, its 
computation complexity and PAPR reduction strength may 
significantly vary. 
In future work, we will consider different ACE 
constraints and TR schemes with different numbers and 
various sets of values for the non-data carriers.
