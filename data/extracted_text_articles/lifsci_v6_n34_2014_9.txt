Abstract—A Personal Health Record is a promising technology 
for improving the quality of chronic disease management. 
Despite the efforts that have been made in a research project to 
develop a Personal Health Record for patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus in primary care (e-Vita), considerable 
differences have been reported between the number of 
registered users in the participating primary practices. 
Interviews among practice nurses indicated that a lack of 
infrastructure (integration in daily care processes), the ability 
to try the Personal Health Record with minimal investments 
and without commitment (trialability) and the relative 
advantage of using a Personal Health Record in comparison 
with other methods were important factors for the diffusion of 
the Personal Health Record in primary care.  
Keywords - Personal Health Record; type 2 diabetes mellitus; 
implementation; diffusion of innovation; interviews; contextual 
inquiry; value specification; summative evaluation. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
In this paper, we provide an extended version of our 
paper as presented at eTelemed 2014, the sixth International 
Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine and Social Medicine 
[1]. We present the results of an interview study to identify 
factors perceived as important in the diffusion of a personal 
health record (PHR) for patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) in primary care, from the perspective of 
health care workers.  
A. Personal Health Records 
The aging population and the increasing need for chronic 
care requires an integral approach to disease management 
that is well coordinated and consistent with (inter)national 
care standards in order to support a shift from 
institutionalized care to home care [2]-[4]. Disease 
management may be viewed as a set of interrelated services 
that spans from prevention and self-management to 
intramural care for patients with chronic diseases [5]-[7]. 
Information- and communication technology (eHealth) will 
play an important role in disease management, e.g., in 
providing online support for self-management, in improving 
information exchange among professionals and with 
patients, as well as in monitoring the performance of the 
disease management program [8][9]. 
The electronic PHR is a promising technology for 
improving the quality of chronic disease management [10] 
[11]. A PHR can be defined as “an electronic application 
through which individuals can access, manage, and share 
their health information and that of others for whom they 
are authorized, in a private, secure and confidential 
environment” [12], a definition that is adopted by many 
researchers over the years (e.g., [13]-[15]). 
However, PHRs are becoming more complex and 
potential functions of current PHRs may not only include 
sharing clinical and personal data (e.g., history, test results, 
treatment, appointments), but may also include self- 
management support (patient-provider communication, 
information about the illness, peer support or monitoring 
health behavior data) [14].  
Potential benefits of a PHR include empowering patients 
in managing their diseases and the reduction of geographical 
and communication barriers. This may, in turn, lead to a 
transition from episodic to continuous care, which has the 
potential to shorten the time to address disease-related 
complaints that may arise [13][14]. 
Despite these benefits, the use of such systems in diabetes 
care has only led to small improvements in diabetes quality 
measures that were of marginal clinical relevance [10], and 
up to now, evaluations have only provided little insight into 
why a particular outcome did occur [16][17]. Consequently, 
the added value of the existing evidence is often limited for 
decision making in relation to the strategic direction of 
implementation efforts [18]. To gain insight into factors that 
contribute to a successful implementation of eHealth 
technologies in daily health care processes, it is therefore

necessary to look for methodological approaches that go 
beyond a baseline and follow-up measurement of health 
outcomes.  
B. e-Vita 
The PHR e-Vita is an initiative of the Dutch foundation 
Care Within Reach (in Dutch: Zorg Binnen Bereik), a 
partnership between Philips and Achmea, a Dutch health 
insurance company. Currently, e-Vita is deployed in in the 
Netherlands via three trials to study the effects of the PHR 
for patients with T2DM, chronic heart failure or COPD. In 
this paper, we will focus on results from the T2DM study. 
For patients with T2DM, the main content of e-Vita consists 
of insight into personal health data (e.g., lab values, blood 
pressure), self-monitoring health values (e.g., weight), 
education and a coach for reaching personal health-related 
goals.  
The T2DM research project consists of two parts. First, a 
prospective observational cohort study (a benchmarking 
study) is being conducted to assess clinical parameters and, 
on the long term, quality of life and disease-related 
complications. Within this study, questionnaires among 
participants are administered periodically and health data 
and blood samples are collected. 
When patients agreed to participate in this benchmarking 
study, they are invited to participate in the PHR trial. Main 
goal of this trial is to study the effects of using a PHR in 
primary care for patients with T2DM (ClinicalTrials.gov 
number NCT01570140) [19]. In total, 44 primary care 
practices participate in this trial. 
C. Diffusion of Innovations 
Despite the efforts that have been made to develop a 
technology that has added value in the treatment of patients 
with T2DM in primary care, differences in the diffusion of  
the PHR are signaled between the primary practices that 
participate in the research project.  
The pace at which new innovations in health care diffuse 
through the system, depends on several factors. In Table I, 
an overview of critical factors for the diffusion of 
innovations according to Cain & Mittman [20] is given.  To 
gain insight into the factors that influence the diffusion of a 
PHR in a primary care practices, an evaluation via 
interviews has been conducted. The main research question 
was: 
 
What factors influenced the diffusion of a PHR for patients 
with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in primary health care, 
according to primary health care workers? 
 
The sub-questions were: 
1. What were the reasons and incentives of primary 
health care workers to participate in research 
project regarding the use of a PHR? 
2. What training did the primary health care workers 
receive at the start of the research project?  
 
CRITICAL DYNAMICS FOR THE DIFFUSION OF 
TABLE I. 
INNOVATIONS [19] 
Critical Dynamic 
Explanation 
1. Relative advantage 
The higher the potential of the technology in 
comparison to current practice, the more 
rapidly it will diffuse.  
2. Trialability 
The ability to try out an innovation without 
total 
commitment 
and 
with 
minimal 
investment.  
3. Observability 
The extent to which potential users follow 
the adoption of an innovation by others.   
4. Communication 
channels 
The communication channels through which 
others communicate about the innovation. 
5. Homophilous groups 
Innovations diffuse faster among groups 
with similar characteristics.  
6. Pace of innovation 
The extent to which innovations evolve and 
are being altered by its users.  
7. Norms, roles and 
social networks 
Innovations are shaped by the rules, formal 
hierarchies, and informal mechanisms of 
communication operative in  the social 
systems in which they diffuse.  
8. Opinion leaders 
Individuals whose opinions are respected by 
others in a population affect the pace of 
diffusion.  
9. Compatibility 
The ability of an innovation to coexist with 
technology and social patterns already in 
place.  
10. Infrastructure 
The presence of some form of infrastructure 
that cluster with the innovation.  
 
3. How did the primary health care workers embed 
the PHR in their daily care routines?  
4. What were the perceived and expected barriers and 
facilitators for embedding a PHR in daily care 
routines, according to primary health care workers? 
5. What are the expectations of primary health care 
workers regarding the use of PHRs in the future?   
The outcome of the interviews provides critical factors 
for the improvement of the diffusion and implementation 
process of a PHR in primary care. 
This paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we will 
describe how the interviews were conducted. In Section III, 
the results of the interviews are described. In Section IV, the 
results and directions for future research are discussed. 
Finally, in Section V, the conclusions of this paper are 
given.  
 
II. 
METHODS 
In this section, we will present the framework for the 
interview study, the participants, the design and procedure 
of the interviews and how the data was analyzed.  
A. The Center for eHealth Research (CeHRes) Roadmap 
The CeHRes roadmap [21] is a framework that is used to 
develop new and to evaluate and improve existing eHealth 
technologies. The roadmap states that eHealth development 
is a participatory process and that development is 
intertwined with implementation into daily health care 
processes. The roadmap consists of five different phases 
(Fig. 1): 
178

1. Contextual inquiry: First, the needs and problems of 
the stakeholders (e.g., patients, caregivers, health 
insurers) are described, in order to gain insight into 
the context and whether or how technology can 
contribute to minimizing problems.  
2. Value specification: Second, information about the 
added values that key-stakeholders attribute to the 
eHealth intervention is gathered. Together with the 
contextual inquiry, the value specification provides  
the functional requirements for the design of the 
technology.  
3. Design: On the basis of these requirements, 
prototypes of the technology are developed and 
tested. 
4. Operationalization: The final version of the eHealth 
technology is launched. 
5. Summative evaluation: Finally, the uptake, effects 
and impact of the eHealth intervention is evaluated.  
According to the roadmap, the development of eHealth 
technology also requires continuous evaluation cycles after 
every step, in order to create eHealth technologies that have 
the potential to diffuse among its end-users.  
For this study, the interviews serve as both a forward 
evaluation (contextual inquiry and value specification) and a 
backward (summative) evaluation to gain insight into the 
uptake and impact of e-Vita as well as into the possibilities 
to improve the content of e-Vita according to health care 
providers. 
B. Participants 
For the interview study, primary care nurses (PNs) of 
general practices in Drenthe, a province in the north of the 
Netherlands, were invited to participate in the interview 
study. In the Netherlands, PNs are the main responsible 
caregivers for educating patients about their (chronic) 
disease, advising patients regarding medication use and 
lifestyle changes and performing health checks. In the  
current trial, all selected PNs are responsible for 
explaining the purpose of the PHR to the participants in the 
study and administering questionnaires regarding the effects 
of the PHR. No guidelines for intended use of the PHR are 
defined.  
To reveal the differences between the diffusion 
processes of practices with high and low numbers of 
participants, potential practices for the interview study were 
selected by the means of an inclusion percentage (high, 
middle, low). The inclusion percentage was calculated as 
follows:  
 
Inclusion percentage = 
(number of included patients for the benchmarking study / 
total number of patients with T2DM in the practice)*100. 
 
Our aim was to conduct five interviews in every group, 
15 interviews in total. We therefore invited the five primary 
practices with the highest and lowest percentages. Also, five 
primary practices with an average inclusion percentage were 
invited to participate. When primary practices had indicated 
on beforehand that the inclusion of participants was 
postponed due to explainable circumstances (e.g., long-term 
diseases among the staff), practices were not contacted to 
participate in the interview study.  
All PNs who met the criteria for the interview study 
received an e-mail with information about the purpose and 
the topics of the interview. When PNs agreed to participate, 
they were contacted to make an appointment for the 
interview.  
C. Design and Procedure 
Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted.  
During the interviews, questions were asked regarding the 
following themes: reasons and incentives to use and 
implement a PHR in their primary practice, the use and 
users of the PHR so far, bottlenecks and barriers that are 
encountered or expected, the (positive) results so far and the 
expected changes a PHR will make in the primary health 
care for patients with T2DM. The duration of the interviews 
was 45-60 minutes (non-stop). All participating PNs 
received a gift voucher of 50 euros. 
Ethical approval for this interview  study was obtained 
by the ethics committee of the University of Twente.  
D. Data Analysis 
All interviews were transcribed verbatim and themes and 
categories were subsequently coded via open coding, axial 
coding and selective coding [22]. In this way, recurring

themes and items of interest regarding the implementation 
and use of eHealth technologies in primary health care 
practice were identified. Occurring themes were categorized 
using the critical dynamics for the diffusion of innovations, 
according to Cain & Mittman [20]

RESULTS 
In this section, we will present the results of the interview 
study.   
A. General Results 
After receiving the invitation, 11 PNs agreed to 
participate in the interview study. An overview of the 
number of potential and included participants for the 
primary care practice of every PN at the start of the 
interviews (August 2013)  is given in Table II.

In total, 5 PNs of practices with high inclusion 
percentages, 4 PNs of practices with average inclusion 
percentages and 2 PNs of practices with low inclusion 
percentages participated in the interview study.  
B. Reasons and Incentives to Participate 
In total, 5 PNs (interview numbers 2, 4, 7, 8 and 11) 
indicated that they participate in the trial because they find it 
important to stimulate the development of self-management 
skills of their patients:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two PNs indicated that they want to keep abreast of the 
times (interview numbers 1 and 2), that they are curious 
about the added value of a PHR in primary practice 
(interview numbers 1 and 6), and that they want to offer 
their patients something extra during their treatment, for 
example information about T2DM (interview numbers 7 and 
8).  
Also, one PN indicated that the primary care practice 
wanted to participate because of their (relatively young) 
patient population (interview number 3) or to participate in a 
research project besides the daily working routines 
(interview number 9).  
Two PNs (interview numbers 6 and 11) indicated that 
they were curious about the results of the benchmarking 
study: how do their practices perform in comparison with 
other practices and how satisfied are their patients about the 
care they receive? 
C. Training 
Regarding the training the PNs received before the start 
of the project, 6 PNs indicated that they attended a plenary 
information meeting (interview numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9). 
During this meeting, information was given about the 
purpose and the course of the research project and 
instructions were given regarding the inclusion of 
participants and administering the questionnaires for the 
benchmarking study. One PN (interview number 4) 
indicated that there was a short explanation about the 
purpose and the functions of the PHR during that meeting.  
Eight PNs indicated that they were not trained in using 
the PHR and how to integrate the PHR in daily care routines 
(interview numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). One PN received 
some instructions for using the PHR (interview number 6) 
and another PN logged in once with one of the researchers 
(interview number 2).  
D. Integrating the PHR in Daily Care Routines 
In total, 8 PNs indicated that they did not integrate the 
PHR with consultations with their patients. The remaining 3 
PNs occasionally ask their patients if they visited the PHR 
and if they have questions regarding the information on the 
PHR.  
E. Perceived Barriers for Using a PHR 
All PNs indicated that there is a lack of time to use the 
PHR in the treatment of their patients. According to 7 PNs 
(interview numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8), this is due to a 
lack of integration of the PHR in daily work routines:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Also, 9 PNs (interview numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 
11) indicated that they did not have access to the PHR. They 
were not able to see what patients see, and find it therefore 
difficult to promote and explain the PHR among their 
patients:   
 
 
 
 
 
“For me, it [the PHR, red.] is quite difficult to fit 
in the 20 minutes that I have for every patient. I 
need that time for the health checks. How do you 
start a dialogue about the PHR, then?” 
“If we can offer patients tools to learn about their 
own disease and to take their own responsibilities, 
we must not miss this opportunity.” 
“I was not able to see 
what patients see for a 
long time. I have to 
recommend something I 
don’t know.” 
“It is quite difficult. You 
don’t know e-Vita, and 
you have to explain it to 
the patients. That doesn’t 
work.”

When they were able to log in to the PHR via their 
patients, 4 PNs (interview numbers 1, 5, 6 and 9) 
experienced usability problems: 
 
 
 
 
 
Also, 4 PNs (interview numbers 2, 8, 9 and 11) indicated 
that they have easy accessible alternatives:   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding their patients, 5 PNs indicated that many of 
their patients do not have Internet access (interview 
numbers 1, 6, 7, 8 and 10) or experience usability problems 
(interview numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6).  
Furthermore, according to 5 PNs, the PHR does not meet 
the needs of their patients (interview numbers 1, 4, 5, 6 and 
7), and patients are afraid that the usual care will become 
less personal (n=4, interview numbers 1, 6, 8 and 10).  
F. Perceived Facilitators for Using a PHR 
Although the PHR is not yet used in daily care routines, 
some potential factors for the successful implementation of 
a PHR were mentioned during the interviews.  
All PNs indicated that they could easily contact a help 
desk when they experienced technical problems with the 
PHR or when they have questions regarding the 
benchmarking study:  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Second, 5 PNs (interview numbers 1, 3, 4, 7 and 10) 
indicated that they were able to fit the activities necessary 
for the benchmarking study into their own workflow: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third, 4 PNs (interview numbers 4, 5, 7 and 9) indicated 
that triggers for using the PHR are probably important, for 
example, via news letters or via (financial) incentives: 
 
 
 
G. The Future of PHRs in Primary Care 
Finally, PNs were asked about their opinion regarding 
the future of PHRs in primary health care. In total, 5 PNs 
(interview numbers 1, 2, 4, 5 and 11) indicated that they 
find it hard to predict whether there is a future for PHRs in 
health care, and how PHRs will be used in the future.  
On the other hand, 5 PNs (interview numbers 2, 4, 6, 9 
and 
11) 
expect 
better-informed 
patients 
during 
consultations, but they also believe that their own role is not 
likely to change.  
Three PNs (interview numbers 3, 5 and 6) believe that a 
PHR in primary care will mainly be used for communication 
purposes between patients and health care providers.  
 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The interviews indicated that, despite the participants’ 
enthusiasm and understanding of the importance of 
stimulating self-management skills of patients with chronic 
conditions, the diffusion of the PHR for patients with T2DM 
in primary care is still rather low. The goal of this study was 
to identify the factors that influenced the diffusion. We 
signaled differences in the inclusion percentages between 
the participating primary practices in the research project, 
and therefore we wanted to gain insight into the factors that 
influenced the diffusion from the view of primary health 
care workers. 
Because we believe that the development of eHealth 
technologies is an ongoing process that requires continuous 
evaluation cycles [21], we conducted both a forward and a 
backward evaluation. With this evaluation, we tried not only 
to gain insight into the factors that influenced the uptake and 
impact of a PHR, but also to identify possibilities for 
improving the PHR in the future.  
Although we aimed to identify differences between the 
factors that influenced the diffusion of the PHR experienced 
by PNs from primary practices with high, medium and low 
inclusion percentages, the experiences of all PNs were fairly 
similar, which indicates that a high inclusion of participants 
in the study does not necessarily lead to using the system in 
daily practice. This finding made it difficult to identify 
factors that contributed to the use of the PHR. However, we 
did find some important factors that influenced the diffusion 
of the PHR.  
First, a lack of infrastructure that is necessary for the 
implementation of an innovation in health care [20][23] 
played an important role. Most PNs indicated that at the 
start of the research project, little attention has gone towards 
education and guidance regarding the integration of the 
PHR with daily practice, and thus, with national guidelines 
for the treatment of chronic diseases in primary care. Most 
PNs indicated that they were mainly trained to administer 
the questionnaires for the benchmarking study, and during 
that training, only little attention has gone to the content and 
the functions of the PHR and the integration of the system 
with daily practice.  
“When you want to visit e-Vita, you have to take 
the hurdle of logging in first.” 
“One patient was quite motivated, so I printed the 
health data and gave it to him. That is a much 
shorter way.” 
“Nothing is too much. 
It is really important 
that it is never 
inconvenient to have 
contact.” 
“A strong point is that they 
are easy to reach. When I 
have a problem, I send an 
email and the next day, I have 
an answer.” 
“I think you should give a 
financial incentive, for 
example, a bonus from the 
health insurance company.” 
“Maybe a newsletter, 
a stimulus to let 
patients think, ‘let’s 
visit e-Vita  again’.” 
“I made a Word file with a 
list of participants, this 
gives me an overview of the 
procedure.” 
“Every time I realize 
that I have to establish 
a system to create a 
routine.”

As a result, the awareness of PNs regarding the added 
value of the PHR is low, which can reduce its diffusion and 
subsequent use [24]. PNs indicated that they do not use the 
PHR in the treatment of their patients. They have a certain 
amount of time for every patient during the consultations, 
and in this time, PNs have to finish the health checkups 
(blood pressure, control of the feet, et cetera), talk with the 
patient about how they are doing and administer the 
questionnaires for the benchmarking study. Because no 
guidelines were given regarding the use of the PHR, asking 
patients about their experiences is not on top of the minds of 
the PNs. Also, PNs indicated that there is often no time to 
ask their patients about the experiences and the use of the 
PHR.  
A first study of log data of the PHR showed that the use 
by patients is suboptimal. After an invitation to visit the 
renewed PHR, 28% of all registered users visited the PHR 
at least once, with a mean of 1.5 visits in the first six weeks 
[25]. It is well possible that creating a routine in using a 
PHR during consultations will lead to an increased use of 
the PHR by patients at home. After all, it is likely that 
patients will use a system that is being promoted by their 
health care providers, who are often in a relationship of trust 
with their patients and are therefore seen as opinion leaders 
[20]. 
An another finding of the interview study is that the 
trialability [20] of the PHR played an important role in the 
diffusion of the technology. Due to technical problems, PNs 
were not able to log on to the PHR with test accounts and 
could 
therefore 
not 
see 
what 
their 
patients 
see. 
Subsequently, PNs reported that they find it difficult to use 
and promote a technology they hardly know.   
At the time of the interviews, test accounts were available 
for PNs, which enhanced the trialability of the system [20]. 
However, because of the reported work pressure and 
established 
working 
routines 
for 
administering 
the 
questionnaires regarding the benchmarking study, it often 
had no priority anymore to visit the PHR.  
Also, 4 PNs indicated that they have easy accessible 
alternative tools and resources available for the PHR, for 
example by providing patients with lab values on paper, 
instead of viewing them on the PHR. In other words, the 
relative advantage [20][23] of the PHR is rather low, which 
is probably another important factor for the slow diffusion 
of the PHR [23].  
To increase the diffusion of the PHR in the future, it is 
therefore useful to guide health care providers in integrating 
the system in daily routines. By creating an infrastructure 
for the use of the PHR, new working routines are being 
established. Also, it might be of added value to appoint 
ambassadors: 
health 
care 
providers 
who 
already 
successfully use the PHR in daily practice. By increasing 
the observability of the PHR, other health care providers are 
able to see how others use the PHR and can acknowledge 
that the use of the PHR is safe and beneficial [20].  
However, the results also showed that the PHR is mostly 
illness-driven instead of user-centered (with little attention 
for the needs of the end-users), indicating that involving the 
end-users (via a contextual inquiry and value specification 
[21]) is valuable in the development of new technologies 
[24]. By involving the end-users and having an eye for their 
needs, the added value of the new technology is already 
evident in the first stages of the developmental cycle [26], 
which may in turn lead to a better diffusion of the 
technology.  
The interviews not only served as a backward evaluation, 
but also as an forward evaluation to gain insight into the 
possibilities to improve the PHR in the future. However, 
because of the lack of insight into the system, PNs found it 
rather hard to give directions for the improvement of the 
PHR. Also, they find it hard to indicate how PHRs will be 
used in the future. In general, PNs expect better informed 
patients during consultations, but they also believe that their 
own role in the treatment of patients is not likely to change.  
In the future, we are planning to conduct a further process 
analysis of the implementation of the PHR using a mixed-
methods approach via interviews and usability tests among 
both patients and health care providers. Also, we are 
planning to conduct advanced log file analyses, containing 
real-time data about the actual use of the PHR, collected by 
the web server. With this data, we will analyze who the 
actual users of the PHR are, how they use the system and 
how the PHR supports the users in reaching their health 
related goals in order to gain insight in how a PHR can be of 
added value in primary care.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The results of the interviews indicate that PNs understand 
the importance of stimulating self-management skills of 
patients with chronic diseases via a PHR. However, the 
diffusion of the PHR is still rather low, mostly due to a lack 
of training in using the PHR and a lack of guidance in 
integrating the system in daily care routines. Also, the 
trialability and the relative advantage of the PHR played an 
important role in the uptake and impact of the new system.  
In the future, we will involve end-users (both patients and 
health care providers) in our research, in order to create a 
PHR that is of added value for patients with chronic 
diseases in primary care.
