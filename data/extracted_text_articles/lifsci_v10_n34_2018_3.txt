Abstract— The Croatian Agency for Medicinal Products and 
Medical Devices is currently implementing the OPeN project. 
Once complete, the project will automate the acquisition of 
pharmacovigilance data from various clinical Information 
Technology (IT) systems and provide data syndication in the 
Croatian National Adverse Reactions Database. It will provide 
a significant contribution to the public health system in 
Croatia. This paper presents the workings of the OPeN project 
in the context of the Croatian eHealth system.  
Keywords— adverse drug reactions; eHealth system;

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
The paper “OPeN: Linking the National Adverse 
Reactions Database with Clinical IT Systems in Croatia,” 
presented at the Tenth International Conference on eHealth, 
Telemedicine, and Social Medicine (eTELEMED) in March 
2018 in Rome, describes the OPeN system, its mechanisms 
and expected benefits for the public health system in Croatia 
[1]. (Figures 2, 3 and 5 in this article were presented for the 
first time in our eTELEMED conference paper.) “OPeN” is a 
shortened form of the phrase “online platform for adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) electronic reporting” (Online 
Platforma za elektroničku prijavu Nuspojava, in the Croatian 
language). The same authors will present an extended 
version 
of 
the 
subject 
matter, 
further 
addressing 
implementation of the OPeN project throughout the entire 
Croatian eHealth system. It is also an update of the work 
presented at the eTELEMED conference given that OPeN 
has already been set up on a production environment. 
The direct beneficiary of the project is the Croatian 
Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices 
(HALMED) [2] and is the national competent authority 
(NCA) in charge of regulating medicinal products and 
medical devices in the country. HALMED conducts drug-
related pre-approval and post-approval processes; the later 
comprising pharmacovigilance activities for the detection, 
analysis, evaluation, interpretation, and deterrence of 
noxious and unintended drug reactions (i.e., ADRs) [3] [4].  
Pharmacovigilance (PhV) is a data-driven discipline 
where analysis of ADRs relies on multiple data sources such 
as spontaneous reporting [5], data mining [6] [7], as well as 
the direct reporting from healthcare professionals (HCPs) 
working in clinical IT systems. Although spontaneous 
reporting is a valuable pharmacovigilance source [5], a 
noticeable problem of underreporting exists [8]. Hence, the 
European [9]–[11] and global community has standardised 
pharmacovigilance practices by issuing general guides [12] 
and data-related specifications [13] [14], as well as 
introducing standards for the field [15]–[17]. Therefore, the 
latter two data-gathering techniques and related data sources 
are advancements in pharmacovigilance over the last decade. 
Data mining, as well as direct relevant [18] input from HCPs 
working in clinical IT systems, have mitigated the issue of 
underreporting [19]. The contribution by HCPs also 
increases the data quality because the data is interpreted 
correctly and communicated by professionals.  
This paper systematises and expands the work presented 
at the eTELEMED conference which described the 
development of the OPeN system and points out the specific 
circumstances and its broader ecosystem. OPeN is a system 
based on the Croatian National Adverse Reactions Database 
which is maintained by HALMED. Since the interoperability 
of eHealth components is a significant aspect of “efficiency 
in the healthcare sector” [20], OPeN aims to achieve 
integration with the Croatian eHealth environment. The 
environment, specifically the Croatian Central Health 
Information System (CEZIH), consists of: the Healthcare 
Networking Information System (HNIS) operating as an 
exchange platform, Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR), 
patient register, register of HCPs, messaging subsystem 
based on Health Level Seven International (HL7v3 and 
HL7v2) messages, online patient healthcare website, 
implemented through the eCitizen website, and specialised 
services related to e-prescriptions, e-laboratory referrals, e-
booking hospital admittance, and numerous other functions 
[21]. CEZIH was established in 2002 [22]. It started as a 
primary healthcare IT system, but underwent continual 
expansion – and in 2010 included the ePrescription service, 
and later in 2016 incorporated EHR and the patient 
healthcare website or portal [22]. It operates using other 
additional client applications for paediatric healthcare, 
gynaecology, dental healthcare, laboratory diagnostics, 
pharmacies, hospital and clinical IT systems. The Croatian 
Health Insurance Fund is responsible for maintaining 
CEZIH.    
In Section II of this article, we will briefly touch upon 
European projects that have led to the development of the 
OPeN project and will subsequently describe its goal and 
main phases. Section III describes the system modules, 
technical characteristics and mechanisms, and use by internal 
HALMED users and external HCPs. Further on, Section IV 
discusses efforts to increase the number and quality of ADRs 
in Croatia, as well as direct reporting as advancement in 
Croatian 
pharmacovigilance, 
and 
briefly 
compares 
pharmacovigilance systems with direct reporting capabilities.

We will discuss why and how specific pharmacovigilance 
mechanisms were included in other European systems led by 
other NCAs and we will compare them to OPeN and efforts 
taken by HALMED in recent years. Examples from similar 
European systems were studied as they use direct ADR 
reporting sourced from clinical systems, which was the 
primary mechanism for achieving the OPeN project. Finally, 
in the same section, we discuss the Croatian eHealth 
environment and the role of OPeN. Section V provides a 
conclusion, while Section VI outlines future work on the 
project as well as feasible and desirable advancements in the 
entire ecosystem.  
II. 
HALMED’S PARTICIPATION IN IT PROJECTS IN 
PHARMACOVIGILANCE AND THE LIFECYCLE OF THE OPEN 
PROJECT 
HALMED is responsible for maintaining the national 
ADR database called VigiBase which is provided by the 
Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) and the World Health 
Organization (WHO). To increase capacity in acquiring 
ADR data from multiple sources, HALMED has participated 
in two respected and well connected European IT projects in 
pharmacovigilance– European Commission (EC) Joint 
Action SCOPE (Strengthening Collaboration for Operating 
Pharmacovigilance), 
and 
Recognising 
Adverse 
Drug 
Reactions (WEB-RADR). SCOPE is a joint action project at 
the EU level focusing on developing ADR reporting 
mechanisms [23]. It has produced recommendations for 
facilitating data collection, data syndication and data disposal 
to other systems for further processing. WEB-RADR was 
started in late 2014 and deals with mobile technology, data 
mining and social media in pharmacovigilance. The project 
was financed by an initiative that included the 7th 
Framework Programme means and private contribution, so it 
represented a private-public partnership between the EU and 
the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and 
Associations (EFPIA). Croatian (HALMED), the Dutch 
MEB (Medicines Evaluation Board), and British MHRA 
(Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) 
were NCAs that developed mobile apps for reporting ADRs 
under WEB-RADR in 2015 and 2016 [24] (see Figure 1). 
Generally speaking, the projects were well supported by 
pharmacovigilance practitioners and HCPs in Europe. 
 
Figure 1: HALMED’s mobile app QR code for ADR reporting  
 
HALMED 
has 
gained 
experience 
from 
these 
international projects and subsequently initiated a new 
project called OPeN. [25] OPeN conforms entirely to the 
SCOPE project recommendation for NCAs who should 
“integrate suspected ADR reporting into clinical IT systems” 
[26]. The goal of the OPeN project is to increase both the 
number and quality of ADR reports and facilitate 
communication between HCPs and NCAs through connected 
clinical IT systems and national ADR databases. The project 
includes some risks, as all compound projects usually do. 
Establishing a system as complex as OPeN involves many 
different institutions and stakeholders (Croatian Ministry of 
Health, Croatian Health Insurance Fund, Croatian National 
Institute of Public Health, and IT companies providing 
solutions and services to the healthcare industry). The most 
significant risks in this entire process were and still are 
ensuring 
necessary 
funding 
and 
providing 
timely 
coordination of activities between various stakeholders. The 
initial plan was to connect OPeN to CEZIH [27] and 
different hospital IT systems. However, this has not yet been 
done, with the HALMED staff actively working on it. A 
possible risk in implementing such integration is the fact that 
the maintaining of CEZIH is not HALMED’s responsibility. 
Another risk is that there are five clinical hospital centres, 
three clinical hospitals, five clinics, 20 general hospitals and 
24 specialized hospitals in Croatia [28], as well as other 
participating institutions. Each has various levels of 
computerisation, and HCPs in these various hospitals use 
different IT solutions. HALMED has developed the OPeN 
system to a level where it is now functionally ready; 
however, other main Croatian stakeholders are required to 
incorporate the system into the national healthcare 
ecosystem. The ideal path that should be taken is to enforce 
providers to incorporate ADR reporting elements into their 
clinical software products, with various approaches for 
solving communication issues between systems. 
Regarding the project lifecycle, HALMED has finished 
the first phase of system development, and the project is 
entering the second phase (see Figure 2). The first phase 
dealt with facilitating HALMED’s internal ADR processing 
and development of web reporting forms, smart PDF forms 
and web services to be integrated into the respective clinical 
IT systems. The result of the first phase is a functional web-
based ADR reporting form and completed OPeN ingest 
functionality. The OPeN system interface is user-friendly to 
simplify data entry and decrease the time required for data 
entry. During ADR reporting, an individual HCP selects 
field values from various lists of medicinal products, 
institutions, units, and measurements. Users can also choose 
from one of the existing templates for new reports. 
Although the web-based application OPeN is fully 
functional and it can be used for data transmission, 
HALMED is aiming to sign the protocol with the Croatian 
National Institute of Public Health. This protocol is essential 
for data exchange between the institute and HALMED and 
the future use of OPeN in the entire Croatian eHealth 
ecosystem. This is the goal of the second phase. The OPeN 
system will be fully operational nationally only after 
strengthening such cooperation. This procedure turned out 
to be a complicated legal and administrative matter in 
Croatia, but the institute has received permission from the 
Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency to share the data, 
acting as the national data-protection authority. Moreover,

the Croatian Ministry of Health has adopted certain 
activities for OPeN as one of their strategic goals for 2019. 
HALMED has also declared OPeN as one of its general 
goals in its official 2019-2021 Strategic Plan. In parallel 
with the signing of the data protocol and preparation of the 
second phase, HALMED has begun planning the third phase 
(see Figure 2), i.e., upgrading the system with an additional 
module that informs HCPs and facilitates their ongoing 
training in the form of online courses. 
Phase 1: 
Build HALMED’s 
and reporters’ 
basic modules
Phase 2: 
Exchange data 
with clinical 
systems
Phase 3:
 Upgrade the system 
with inform-and- 
educate function

III. 
OPEN – DEVELOPMENT, MECHANISMS AND RESULTS 
 
HALMED's goal in this project is to automate direct 
reporting of adverse drug reactions by HCPs, using existing 
workplace IT systems.  
OPeN has been developed as a web-based application 
that consists of a database, a web interface, and web 
services for integration with other IT systems (external 
clinical IT systems and other IT systems at HALMED). 
OPeN is based on Windows technology and developed 
using the .NET Framework, whereas the data is stored in the 
as Microsoft’s Structured Query Language on a server 
database (MS SQL). The database is organized in multiple 
schemes and contains data and procedures for system 
operation, such as configuration data, user data, data on 
healthcare facilities, and all data on adverse drug reactions 
including their logging and processing. Wherever possible, 
the data is structured into more than 40 data lists, a part of 
which is accessible to users via a web service. 
A firewall and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol 
protects the entire system. Access and data protection are 
established through domain admin policies for internal users 
(Windows Active Directory) and for external users. Backup 
procedures are performed regularly.  
The scenario is as follows: an individual HCP submits a 
report and transfer it to HALMED, where assigned staff 
processes the report (see Figure 3).  
There are three possible ways of sending data on side 
effects to OPeN; via the Internet and web application, 
sending the prefilled smart PDF document via e-mail or 
directly via the IT systems HCPs use at their workplace (if 
the system is connected to OPeN, as predicted by the phase 
2 result). 
The web layer of OPeN consists of two modules: a 
module for HALMED employees and a module for external 
users (HCPs). HALMED employees use the system to 
register and validate received reports, detect duplicates, 
assign them to assessors, and track further processing and 
steps, such as forwarding them to the EudraVigilance 
system [29], as well as other tasks. The module for 
HALMED employees is also connected to the HALMED 
Enterprise Content Management System (ECMS) via web 
services, where all the digital records are stored. These 
digital records are available for reading and editing in the 
OPeN system throughout the entire process.  
 
Figure 3. The OPeN workflow  
 
Registered HCPs use the module assigned for external 
users to report adverse drug reactions. In the form for 
entering the drug or vaccine data, users enter one or more 
drugs (one or more vaccines which are suspected) or 
concomitant substances (see Figure 4). The fields in Figure 
4 are as follows: Drug (medicinal product), Active

(MAH), 
Dosage, the checkbox for Vaccines, the checkbox for 
Suspected drug, Drug Consumption Start Date, Drug 
Consumption End Date, its Duration, Batch Number for the 
drug, and Single Dosage. The drugs are selected from the 
list and then other drug data, such as the active substance, 
dosage and MAH, are completed automatically. The user 
can also specify the name of the drug. 
 
Figure 4. Form for entering one or more suspected drugs 
 
OPeN users can enter optional information for any drug 
such as start date of drug consumption, end date of drug 
consumption, duration of treatment, dose interval, amount 
of administered doses in a selected interval, single dosage, 
batch number, indication, and administration route. Also, 
users can enter information about whether adverse reactions 
ceased after completing therapy or whether adverse 
reactions reappeared upon re-administering the drug. In the 
application dashboard, the reporter can view all entered 
adverse drug reactions and a status report. Views include an 
overview of unrecorded side effects, received side effects, 
side effects awaiting acceptance, side effects assigned to 
somebody, side effects approaching the processing deadline, 
side effects awaiting a severity rating, side effects assigned 
to the current user, side effects awaiting entry, as well as 
side effects assigned to the current user and awaiting a 
severity rating. The system alerts the user if data concerning 
an applicant or patient is missing, or if an error has occurred 
such as an upload error or check-in error, and it shows the 
status of the application. Figure 5 shows the OPeN 
interface; with the example indicating creation dates and 
statuses “Received in OPeN” and “Task accepted” in the 
last row.

All institutions that participate in data exchange use the 
same list of HCP authentication data. This facilitates 
exchanging data without additional authentication when 
sending the data to HALMED. A common list provides data 
traceability. Data exchanged between internal and external 
systems is in XML data format, and XML structures adhere 
to E2B-R2 and E2B-R3 formats [13] [14]. ADR reporting is 
carried out via an HTTP POST request to the endpoint: 
http://open.halmed.hr/client/#/login. All required lists can be 
downloaded via the web service available on the following 
website: 
http://open.halmed.hr/CodeBookService/CodeBookService.
svc. The site provides the following lists: Doubt, 
Consequence, Age Unit, Gender, Medication, Outcome, 
Duration Unit, Time from Consumption to Reaction Unit, 
Side Effect Medicine Correlation, Measurement Unit, 
Dosing Interval Unit, Application Type, Drug Consumption 
Change, Drug Reapplication Status, Drug Discontinuation, 
Application Location, Profession, Vocation, County, and 
Country. 
In the first phase of the project, HALMED also 
developed a smart PDF form containing embedded lists. 
The form is available on the HALMED and OPeN websites

[25]. Anyone can access the form, complete it and send it 
via e-mail. OPeN automatically loads data from the form 
into the OPeN database, eliminating the need to enter data 
manually. HALMED has provided instructions on various 
reporting tasks for the general public, patients and HCPs on 
the 
PhV 
section 
of 
its 
website 
(http://www.halmed.hr/en/Farmakovigilancija/Kako-

IV. 
DISCUSSION ON THE OPEN AND EHEALTH SYSTEMS 
IN CROATIA 
Due to their significant contribution to an efficient 
eHealth ecosystem, we will highlight some of the OPeN 
possibilities, such as integration and communication with 
other systems, as well as current coding and data mapping 
abilities. To grasp the importance of direct reporting and 
main points of the OPeN system, we will provide a 
historical development of reporting in Croatia, benefits of 
the reporting function, direct reporting trends in other 
countries, and the national eHealth system as a broader field 
in the direct reporting. 
A. Efforts to increase the number and quality of ADRs in 
Croatia over the last decade 
Spontaneous ADR reporting is the keystone of 
pharmacovigilance. A sufficient number of high-quality 
ADR reports are directly correlated to the effectiveness of 
ADR system capacity in detecting drug safety issues. ADR 
systems rely on the goodwill of HCPs and patients, not only 
on identifying suspected ADR reports but also reporting 
them. ADR reporting schemes are recognised as being 
underreported [8] [30] [31]. Directive 2010/84/EU, which 
came into force in 2013, identified this issue and stated that 
NCAs need to encourage and improve reporting of ADRs. 
According to Article 102 of the Directive, NCAs shall “take 
all appropriate measures to encourage patients, doctors, 
pharmacists and other healthcare professionals to report 
suspected adverse reactions to the national competent 
authority” [32]. Heads of medicines agencies (HMA) 
incorporated the aim of the Directive into their 2011-2015 
Strategy [33]. HMA aims to support the strengthening of 
spontaneous ADR reporting systems, indicating four main 
complementary approaches as a means of improving ADR 
reporting 
and 
achieving 
a 
more 
robust 
national 
pharmacovigilance system: (1) education, (2) motivation, 
(3) promotion, and (4) facilitation of ADR reporting, all of 
which are mainly directed to HCPs and patients. 
Throughout the last decade, HALMED has joined in 
numerous activities to increase the number and quality of 
reported ADRs in Croatia. The number of spontaneous 
ADR reports increased from 856 in 2007 to 3486 in 2016, 
ranking Croatia in the top ten countries in the world for a 
number of ADRs per million inhabitants [34]. Education, 
motivation, and promotion have been extensively used and 
combined with different ways of making reporting easier. 
This was done by introducing novel methods for capturing 
ADRs: an online reporting form for patients to complete as 
well as a mobile app for patients and HCPs. The online 
reporting form was launched in 2012, and by 2016 a total of 
20% of all ADRs were received through this channel. 
Although HALMED intended the online reporting form to 
be for patients, it was also widely used by HCPs. The PhV 
mobile app was introduced in 2016 (through the project 
WEB-RADR) and accounted for the 2% of ADR received in 
2016. The focus was on activities aimed at making reporting 
easier. HALMED started introducing electronic reporting 
which 
encouraged 
rationalisation 
of 
internal 
ADR 
processing. The main reasoning behind this was to decrease 
manual entries into the national ADR database. This issue 
has gained in importance as an increasing number of 
received ADRs begins to have a real impact on resources 
available 
to 
other 
pharmacovigilance 
processes 
at 
HALMED (e.g., assessments of risk management plans, 
periodic update of safety reports).  
B. Direct reporting from clinical systems - an 
advancement in pharmacovigilance  
Although the regulatory workload at HALMED has 
increased substantially since 2013, there remains an active 
commitment to improving the national PhV system, as well 
as opening up possibilities for detecting signals and safety 
issues. This was the reason for planning and starting the 
OPeN project. OPeN aims to automate the internal handling 
of reported ADRs and to further increase both the number 
and quality of ADR reports transmitted to HALMED. 
Capturing ADR reports from online reporting forms and 
clinical systems should ensure this. The idea behind OPeN 
is to build a system that will allow communication between 
clinical IT systems and the national ADR database. 
HALMED considers the capturing of ADR reports from 
clinical systems in electronic form to be the most 
challenging part of the project. Direct reporting from 
clinical systems, however, has many advantages. It 
improves the efficacy of reporting of HCPs by making the 
completion of forms easier as it uses data from patient 
records and automates data entry methods. HALMED 
considers it to be a way of promoting ADR reporting in 
general. Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis 
published by I. Ribeiro-Vaz et al. [35], projects that aim to 
promote ADR reporting by harnessing IT solutions are an 
increasing trend. According to their aggregate analysis, 
these solutions have doubled the number of captured ADR 
reports. 
Reporting from the clinical system helps in acquiring 
comprehensive information on ADRs. It facilitates case 
assessment by providing the surrounding circumstances for 
ADRs. An added value is the ability to prompt reporters to 
complete a report in the system once specific tasks are 
completed, e.g., withdrawing a drug from administered 
therapy. It can also prompt a reporter to enter more specific 
report data (e.g., the batch number if ADR comes from 
vaccines and biologicals). This ADR information is rarely 

152
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 10 no 3 & 4, year 2018, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/
2018, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
captured in paper form; however, it can be crucial in 
understanding ADR causes.  
An additional benefit of an automatic data entry method 
in direct ADR reporting from a clinical system is the use of 
controlled data entries. Where applicable, ADR reporters 
may use data registries (e.g., medicinal product registry) to 
facilitate the data entry method. Another benefit of using IT 
solutions is using data validation rules and making it easier 
to receive accurate and valid reports. Consequently, national 
ADR databases are becoming more accurate. It reduces the 
need to contact a reporter in case of non-valid ADRs. Rules 
of reporting should meet the applicable ICH E2B standards 
[13] [14], and minimum required data. Additional validation 
rules should also be incorporated to meet business or 
regulatory requirements. Also, the use of dictionaries, 
including the mapping of dictionaries, helps establish 
standardised terminology and coding terms for assessors. 
The use of dictionaries represents a significant benefit for 
any pharmacovigilance system. The second phase of OPeN 
addresses these very issues. 
C. A brief comparison of pharmacovigilance systems with 
mechanisms for capturing ADRs from clinical systems 
According to the SCOPE results, there are only 3 NCAs 
or regulatory agencies that utilize the possibility of 
capturing ADRs from clinical systems: the Spanish AEMPS 
(Agencia 
Española 
de 
Medicamentos 
y 
Productos 
Sanitarios), the British MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare 
products 
Regulatory 
Agency) 
and 
the 
Netherlands 
Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb [36] - [38]. Their systems 
mainly aim to retrieve ADRs from general practitioners 
(GPs). This is a logical decision given that GPs have access 
to most of a patient’s health information.  
Although systems differ, their experiences indicate that 
the integration of ADR reporting into electronic health 
records, primary healthcare, and e-prescription systems 
correlates positively with an increased number of received 
ADR reports and quality of received information. Spain 
integrated its ADR reporting system with HER, the primary 
healthcare and e-prescription solution back in 2010. The 
Spanish use a ‘Nomenclator’ dictionary maintained by 
AEMPs. The use of the International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD) is also recommended.  
In the UK, for example, during the pilot phase of the 
system in 2011, automatic ADR reporting feature was added 
to a primary care system (SystemOne) for GPs. Analysis of 
received Yellow Cards showed an increase for GP ADR 
reports of almost 50% compared to 2010. Specific 
information, the standard for electronic Yellow Card 
reporting, was developed for the English National Health 
Service (NHS) in 2012 [39]. It was based on the ICH 
E2B(R2) standard [13] and prescribed use of the electronic 
Yellow Card message.  
In the Netherlands, professional bodies and GPs have 
implemented an electronic reporting module linked to the 
GPs medical records. The Netherlands PhV Centre Lareb 
integrated the reporting of suspected ADRs in healthcare 
systems using a specific method. Once a physician enters an 
ADR in patient records, an alert pops up to prompt reporting 
of ADRs. It opens a partly completed reporting form on the 
GP’s computer screen for further completion. The second 
method is to send reported ADRs which are recorded in 
registries automatically to Lareb. The initiative commenced 
in 2014, and the first reports from the registry began 
arriving in December 2015. Both initiatives were in the pilot 
phase during the SCOPE report, with a few sites sending the 
reports. From mid-March 2016, plans focused on 
developing reporting forms for the GP information system. 
With regards to education, there has been no special 
education for reporting ADRs using these two new methods. 
The UK and Spanish systems follow a similar concept. 
There are some differences between the systems. ADRs 
received from clinical systems in Spain are not 
automatically uploaded into the national database at 
Farmacovigilancia Española, Datos de Reacciones Adversas 
(FEDRA), but pass through regional PhV centers. Also, the 
ADR description is authored by the HCP, while the UK 
system codes the ADRs in compliance with the dictionary 
called 
the 
Systematized 
Nomenclature 
of 
Medicine 
(SNOMED) [40]. The MHRA has implemented a mapping 
between the SNOMED terms and the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) [41] which is standard 
terminology used for coding ADRs worldwide. It enables 
ADR reports to be automatically loaded into the PhV 
database at MHRA without coding ADRs.  
In comparison, OPeN allows direct upload of ADR 
reports to the national database. However, coding of ADRs 
by the reporter will not be possible. Also, the Croatian 
eHealth system does not use SNOMED, but coding lists are 
agreed upon at a national level to ensure interoperability 
[20]. HCPs in Croatia use the International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 
(ICD 10) terminology for coding medical terms [42], and 
there is no mapping to MedDRA.  
Also, OPeN provides two-way communication with 
reporters, mainly for retrieving follow-up information. We 
believe this is the benefit our system offers, although details 
on the communication possibilities within the UK or 
Spanish systems are not widely available. There is limited 
published information on particular data elements of both 
systems. We were able to compare our systems solely by 
actively participating in the SCOPE project. However, 
information on the systems may be outdated, given that 
SCOPE includes data only before 2013. Moreover, it is a 
challenge in finding information about publication activities 
from other countries when implementing ADR reporting 
from clinical systems. Previous research of the systems 
outlined above has enabled the HALMED team to avoid 
some problems in developing, implementing, and fine-
tuning of the OPeN system. The primary challenge in this 
type of projects in other countries was the integration of the 
reporting form into the particular system logically and

without seeking too much or too little additional 
information. Ensuring patient privacy was also important. 
HALMED’s team members have used these valuable 
lessons during the development of the OPeN system. 
D. OPeN - vital to the Croatian eHealth ecosystem    
In general, eHealth systems consist of electronic medical 
records (EMR) produced by particular HCPs, EHR 
(generated by all HCPs), as well as personal healthcare 
records (PHR) verified by patients [20]. 
The eHealth system in Croatia provides two functions: an 
integration platform for local information systems used in 
GP practices, pharmacies, laboratories, hospitals, and a 
centralised national application accessible via a web 
interface. Generally, the business process runs in the 
following manner: nurses and GPs use client applications 
for processing patient information. Client applications 
utilize captured information, transforming it into patient 
summaries, prescriptions, referrals for hospitalization or 
specialist reports, referrals to laboratory analyses, and the 
like. These messages are sent to the central core of CEZIH 
which is available to other healthcare participants. For 
example, a pharmacist retrieves a prescription from his 
client-side application, dispenses the particular medication 
and sends the relevant information back to the CEZIH 
centre, which is also accessible to the prescriber. An 
Analogous process exists with referrals and which are 
retrieved by hospital or laboratory personnel, after which the 
discharge letters and laboratory results are sent back to 
CEZIH, and subsequently to the referring party [22]. 
Additional available services are infectious disease 
reporting, malignant disease reporting, sick leave reports, 
adverse 
effects 
during 
immunization, 
retrieval 
of 
administrative information from insurance perspectives and 
other types of reports. Authentication is supported with 
smart cards for HCPs, and information security is supported 
with CEZIH and client applications such as VPN, firewall, 
SSL/TLS and encryption. [22]. Messages are stored by the 
system and have a non-repudiation quality [22]. Some of the 
most relevant information that originates from mechanisms 
such as patient visit summaries, ePrescription and eReferral 
are transformed and provided to healthcare professionals via 
the 
EHR 
application 
after 
establishing 
appropriate 
authorization and in line with patient consent. The limited 
scope of medical information is also available for review via 
dedicated patient websites where consent for accessing EHR 
can also be given and revoked, and information on access to 
a patient’s EHR can be reviewed. 
The design enables OPeN to anticipate connections 
between the actual system and the Croatian eHealth 
environment (CEZIH) as well as related physician, 
pharmacy and hospital IT systems. Most of the data required 
for reporting ADRs is already contained in the IT systems of 
HCPs, hence filling out the forms takes less time, and it also 
simplifies the process of sending data to HALMED. The 
outcome is an increase in the quality of transmitted data, 
less chance of errors during data entry and preventing the 
submission of incorrect or incomplete forms. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND EXPECTED BENEFITS  
Submissions of timely and properly completed ADR 
reports increases the data available to NCAs and their 
capacity to raise public health. It improves the ability NCAs 
to detect, identify, investigate and act on potential drug 
safety issues.  
Pharmacovigilance professionals consider the integration 
of clinical IT systems and ADR databases as a bleeding edge 
tool for increasing both the number and quality of captured 
ADRs. HALMED has established OPeN for this very reason. 
As the Croatian NCA for drugs, HALMED has started an 
initiative that has aimed to integrate the national ADR 
database, CEZIH, and various hospitals IT systems. The 
expected benefits include:  
• 
Facilitation and promotion of ADR reporting, 
• 
A higher number and better quality of reports, 
• 
Less manual data entry and data processing time per 
the report, 
• 
Standardisation, clarification of professional terms, 
dictionaries, 
• 
The introduction of analytics, advancement in 
tracking key performance indicators (KPI) and 
signals, planning for BI features, 
• 
Improving guidance on drug prescriptions, 
• 
Sophisticated and proactive protection of public 
healthcare based on interpretation of complex drug 
reaction reports provided by modern IT solutions. 
The last benefit stems from the result of integrating 
OPeN and CEZIH, and this will be possible once data 
between the Croatian Health Insurance Fund and HALMED, 
or their CEZIH and OPeN systems is exchanged. 
VI. 
FURTHER WORK 
 
An efficient and connected healthcare system facilitates 
the protection of patients, efforts by HCPs and has benefits 
for all other stakeholders in the national healthcare industry. 
The OPeN system is an excellent example of utilizing 
important pharmacovigilance mechanisms and convenient 
technological elements in the national health system. 
HALMED will upgrade it with additional functions in the 
future, and we firmly believe that the sustainability of the 
project is ensured.
