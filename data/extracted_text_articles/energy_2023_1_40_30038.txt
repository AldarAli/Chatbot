Abstract—For the target of energy demand estimation of 
residential buildings in urban scale, occupants’ behavior model 
has been paid much attention. In this paper, a new model for 
simulating occupants’ behavior schedules in urban scale has 
been proposed using only public stochastic data (national 
lifetime survey) combined with Dynamic Time Warping and 
Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms. We use this proposed 
model to simulate the working-male’s behavior schedules with 
5-mintues interval in resting day as an example. The simulated 
results - percentages of occupants adopt the given behavior at 
specific moments are calculated and compared with public 
stochastic data to verify the accuracy. Compared with existing 
models, the proposed model is more efficient and accurate. We 
believe this model could be useful for building energy demand 
estimation in urban scale combined with appliance operation 
possibility based on occupants’ behaviors. 
Keywords-occupants’ behavior model; energy demand of 
residential buildings; public stochastic data; particle swarm 
optimization; dynamic time warping. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
A. Background 
To get the target of decarbonized society in 2050 [1], the 
Japanese government is promoting the introduction of 
decentralized renewable energy devices in urban area to 
reduce carbon emissions. But without a suitable introduction 
plan, the surplus electricity generated from excessive devices 
would disturb the balance between the supply and demand of 
power system or failing to get decarbonization target because 
of insufficient devices. Therefore, in building sector, it is 
essential to develop the decentralized energy introduction 
plan based on the energy demand of buildings in urban area.  
The renewable energy is limited to natural condition (e.g., 
solar energy) and outpower changes dramatically over time. 
Therefore, the energy demand of buildings should be 
estimated with high temporal resolution. Non-residential 
buildings (e.g., office) have temporal characteristics of 
energy demand because of fixed schedule of users. However, 
the energy demand of residential building is decided by 
appliances’ operation, which is influenced by the behavior of 
the occupants with significantly personal characteristics. In 
previous studies about energy demand estimation for 
residential buildings, the behavior schedules of occupants 
had been set to several cases. This assumption would 
significantly affect the accuracy of results. The reason is that 
even the same type occupants in urban scale would have 
numerous kind behaviors at the same time, but there are only 
a few cases in these few schedules that would overlay the 
peak or trough energy demand amount. Thereby, the demand 
results and the amount of renewable energy devices need to 
be introduced would be a departure from reality. Thus, a 
method to simulate the occupants’ behavior schedules in 
urban scale is very essential for the plan of introduction of 
decentralized renewable energy in urban scale.  
B. Related Work  
There is much previous research about the occupants’ 
behavior model in urban scale [2]. The models could be 
divided into two types based on whether to use dataset called 
Time Use Data (TUD), which describe occupants’ behavior 
by time.  
For the first type without TUD, in [3], a model was 
developed using only public stochastic data of TUD include 
mean and standard deviation of behaviors’ duration time in a 
day and percentages of occupants adopt the behavior at special 
moments by 15-mintues interval of a day. They firstly selected 
the behaviors according to probabilities and arranged their 
total duration time into 24 hours. Next, they placed the first 
behavior into the slot in timeline according to random number 
and placed the next behavior into the end of previous behavior 
one by one. As one merit, this method could generate the 
occupants’ behavior schedules with only public stochastic 
data. But the accuracy of the simulation results was greatly 
influenced by the first behavior’s inserted slot, which was 
decided randomly. Also, the results had not been validated.  
For the type of models using TUD, in [4], they developed 
a model using the Markov Chain, which is a stochastic model 
to determine the transition of behavior from another only 
depend on the condition at the previous time step. They 
collected the TUD from a great number of households and 
analysis the transition probability between behaviors. But the 
behavior items were limited in at room or not.  
In [5], they proposed a Markov Chain model and expanded 
analysis of the number of behavior items. They simulated the

household’s members independently. These Markov Chain 
models considered and simulated the transitions probability 
between the behaviors precisely, but the accuracy of behavior 
duration time was dependent on the timing and number of 
behavior transitions. This could be a weakness for simulating 
the occupants’ behavior schedules. In [6], they developed a 
occupants’ behavior model dealing with above problems. 
They divided behaviors into routine and non-routine and 
considered them separately. The behaviors’ duration time and 
transition probabilities between them were acquired by 
analyzing the TUD from the national time-use survey 
conducted by Statistics Japan in 2006 and been utilized for 
placing the behaviors into the timeline. They firstly placed the 
routine behaviors (including sleeping, commuting to work & 
school, dining and bathing) into timeline, then selected the 
non-routine behaviors according to the probabilities and 
placed them in the gap between the routine behaviors until all 
gaps had been filled. They improved the model in [7] 
considering the interaction among household members (e.g., 
household members always have dining together at one time 
and bathing one by one) and time-dependent characteristics of 
the specific behaviors (e.g., for a single person, the personal 
washing often happens immediately after waking up or 
breakfast, but it’s not shown in TUD because it was originated 
from a wide range of people.). In [8], they explored several 
machine learning methods to pre-process the TUD to improve 
the accuracy of behavior model. Although the duration time 
and transition probabilities of behaviors were detailed 
considered in their model, predetermining the number of 
behavior occurrences with a subjective assumption was made. 
(e.g., three meals over a day, one sleeping in the evening with 
long period), but according to the public stochastic data, there 
are also sleeping at the daytime for many type people), this 
might be a weakness of their model for ignoring this specifical 
cases. On the other hand, raw TUD are required to make this 
kind of model while only public stochastic data are available 
in many countries. 
As mentioned above, until now there are many developed 
occupants’ behavior models in urban scale with own strengths 
and weaknesses. But there is still no precise occupants’ 
behavior model that do not require prior analysis of large 
amount of raw TUD, pre-classification of behaviors according 
to routinely or not and predetermined number of occurrences 
with subjective assumption. 
C. Purpose of the paper 
In this paper, a new occupants’ behavior model using 
only public stochastic data without raw TUD has been 
proposed. Compared with existing models in previous 
research, this model could ensure the accuracy and efficiency.  
Section Ⅱ introduces the detailed procedures of the 
proposed model. Section Ⅲ corrects the simulation processes 
based on the simulation results. In Section Ⅳ, the final 
simulation result of working-male in resting day is shown. In 
Section Ⅴ, the conclusions about model’s features and 
weaknesses are introduced. Based on that, the directions of 
improving model in future are also introduced.  
II. PROPOSED BEHAVIOR MODEL  
A. Parameters of purposed occupants’ behavior model  
The proposed model simulates the occupants’ behavior 
schedules with 5-min interval based on the public stochastic 
data called National Lifetime Survey in 2020 from Japan 
Broadcast Institution (NHK) [9]. It should be noted that target 
of simulating behavior schedules is to estimate energy 
demand of residential building, so the behaviors that have no 
relationship with energy demand in residential building (e.g., 
working outside, commuting to work, school) have not been 
simulated in this paper. This assumption, which is one of the 
differences between the previous studies, can greatly simplify 
the model. Table Ⅰ shows the classification result of behaviors 
on public stochastic data. These behaviors have been 
simplified into 24 types and divided into interior and exterior. 
According to whether using appliances, the interior behaviors 
are further divided into two categories.  
To make the model, the public stochastic data would be 
utilized include: 
• 
PM: probabilities of adopting given behavior by 15-
minutes interval (the data has been processed into 5-
minutes interval by liner interpolation). 
• 
PA: probabilities of adopting given behavior over a 
day.  
• 
MTB: average duration time of adopting given 
behavior.  
• 
SDTB: standard deviation of duration time of given 
behavior.  
Some samples of public stochastic data are shown in Table 
Ⅱ. 
During the process of simulation,  a blank timeline with 
288 time slots (time of a day with 5-minutes interval) is 
generated firstly and prepares for filling up with behaviors

separately. The given behavior’s occurrences will span 
corresponding time slots in the timeline depend on its duration 
time length. The detail steps are explained as: 
1) 
Iterates over all given behaviors in order of the PA’s 
values and determines whether to adopt based on its 
PA. 
2) 
Once the given behavior has been adopted, the 
duration time (TB) is determined according to the 
Gaussian Distribution defined by MTB and SDTB. 
3) 
To insert these given behaviors into the timeline, it is 
critical to decide several parameters’ solution of the 
given behavior including: 
a) 
n: number of behavior occurrences.  
(n =1~4 randomly) 
b) 
sm: start moment of each behavior occurrence.

B. Start moments of behavior occurances 
  It is necessary to decide SMN ’s solution to determine the 
positions of timeline where the behavior occurrences are 
going to be inserted. 
Figure 2 shows the process of deciding the start moment of 
each behavior occurrence by the cumulative distribution of 
PM. In detail, one day is divided into n time regions, which 
have the same sum of PM.  The start moment of splitting time 
region is generated randomly (e.g., 6:30).  It is assumed that 
object behavior occurs once in each time region. Based on that 
assumption, the cumulative distribution function of PM in 
each time region has been calculated to determine the start 
moment of each occurrence.  
C. Dynamic Time Warping 
Different from SMN, it is impossible to get PNN&PTN 
solution based on the existing public stochastic data merely. 
It is necessary to introduce parameter optimization method to 
obtain the optimal PNN&PTN solution. 
To verify the fitness of PNN&PTN candidate solution, 
we introduce the objective function to compare PM and 
probability of adopting given behavior at 5-min interval, 
which is calculated by schedules generated using PNN&PTN 
candidate solution (PM’). For PM and PM’ are both time 
series data, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) introduced in [10] 
is used as objective function to measure their similarity.  
DTW of PM and PM’ is calculated by (1):   
      DTW(PM, PM’) = min

PNN&PTN solution would be decided with the minimal 
DTW.  
D. Patricle Swarm Optimization 
As mentioned above, the best PNN&PTN solution can be 
found by finding the minimal DTW. In this paper, we use 
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to find the 
minimal DTW. PSO is an evolutionary algorithm introduced 
in [11] that could optimize a problem by iteratively trying to 
improve a candidate parameters’ solution to get the better 
position in a D-dimensional space (D is the number of 
parameters).  
In the process of the PSO algorithm, firstly, a large 
number of particles have been generated and each particle is a 
candidate solution of PNN&PTN with different DTW result. 
At 1st iteration, particle’ initial position (p1) and velocity (v1) 
are randomly generated.  p1 means PNN&PTN solution and v1 
means the distance between p1 and p2 (position at 2nd iteration) 
as showed in (6). These particles make up a cloud that covers 
the entire space, then the DTW of all particles are calculated 
to decide their fitness. Based on fitness values, the globally 
best particle position（pg1）and  locally best particle position 
(pl1) are determined. As showed in (7), according to pg1, pl1 
and p1, v1 would be updated to v2, which would continue to 
update p2 to p3. With the iteration advancing, the cloud 
contracts gradually and performs the exploration for best 
PNN&PTN solution with minimal DTW.

 E. Process of proposed model  
     Figure 3 shows the proposed model’s all processes for 
simulating the behavior schedules. Using this model, 1000 
behavior schedules have been generated and evaluated.  
III. CORRECTION OF SIMULATION PROCESS 
According to the schedule results, there are two significant 
errors include: 
1) 
Figure 4 shows the results of sleeping are 
inaccurate thoroughly. 
2) 
Figure 5 shows the delaying of start moments of 
PM’ compared with PM.  
The above errors would be dealt with as follows: 
A. Correction of sleep simulation process 
The error 1) can be attributed to the inaccurate 
determination of start moments of sleeping. Different from 
other behaviors, people always have a long period sleeping in 
the evening and add a short period sleeping during the daytime. 
For this type of behavior with a clear temporal characteristic,

the method deciding behavior start moments based on sum of 
PM is not suitable any longer. To solve this problem, we 
revise the model to simulate sleeping behavior in the 
following process: 
a) 
The number of sleeping occurrence (n) is set to 
1~2. If sleeping occurs once, it occurs at night; if 
sleep occurs twice, the first and longer sleeping 
occurs in the evening and second one occurs at 
daytime.  
b) 
For sleeping in the evening, people wake up at a 
more concentrated time than when they fall asleep. 
Therefore, we use the moments of waking up 
(ending of sleeping) to decide the position of 
sleeping in timeline where being inserted into.  
c) 
The range of end moments of first sleeping in the 
evening is set as 0:00-12:00, the range of start 
moments of second sleep is set as 12:00-18:00. 
The specific moments in the range are searched by 
PSO method too.  
To sum up, the parameters of sleeping for PSO method 
are reset showed as (8):

     After the calculation by PSO, Figure 6 shows the results of 
sleeping’s PM and PM’ by this revised process, which is 
better than original one.  
B. Correction of start moment  
For the error 2), the reason being considered is that the 
decision of start moment based on cumulative distribution 
function of PM always drop behind actual situation. To solve 
this issue, the new parameter ad is introduced to adjust the 
SMN:

. The decision of ad 
is also calculated by PSO method. Therefore, the solution of

Figure 7 shows the simulation results of PM and PM’ after the 
adjustment of behavior start moments and it demonstrates 
higher accuracy than before.

Table Ⅲ shows the calculation results of behavior 
washing’s parameter solutions by PSO algorithm of working-

all target behaviors is shown.  The result shows that PM’

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper proposes a model based on public stochastic 
data to generate occupants’ behavior schedules at home. It 
could be used in energy demand estimation of residential 
buildings in urban scale. More than just simulation for 
behavior schedules based on past public stochastic data, it 
might be useful for assuming the future people behavior 
change by altering the inputting public stochastic data (e.g., 
the working time at home increased because of covid-19).  
Compared with existing behavior model’s research, the 
proposed model has the following features: 
• 
Generating occupants’ behavior schedules based on 
public stochastic data only. Without statistical 
analysis of large amounts of raw TUD, which is not 
available in many countries, making the behavior 
model simpler and more efficient.  
• 
No classifying the behaviors or setting the specific 
number and duration time of behavior occurrences. 
This feature could exclude the errors from subjective 
assumptions.   
• 
Utilizing the PSO and DTW algorithm to search the 
suitable number of behavior occurrences and 
percentages of occurrences’ duration time. It would 
make the simulation results match the public 
stochastic data as closely as possible.  
• 
Deciding the start moments of behavior based on 
cumulative distribution of public stochastic data. As 
the simulation results do not agree with the public 
stochastic data, the start moments calculated by the 
above method have been corrected using PSO 
algorithm.  
It should be noted that by PSO algorithm merely, the SMN 
could be determined without using cumulative distribution of 
PM. But with the assistance of cumulative distribution, the 
PSO algorithm could narrow the search range and get solution 
quickly. Using this revised model, the working-male’s 
behavior schedules in resting day have been generated. The 
result shows that our model has a good accuracy. But there are 
also several drawbacks: 
a) 
During some time interval s (e.g., at 12:00~12:30 and 
22:00~22:30, the public stochastic data - PM of eating, 
sleeping increase rapidly, but the simulation results - 
PM’ fail to reflect such phenomenon. 
b) 
No consideration of interaction between behaviors 
(e.g., people are likely to wash themselves when they 
wake up, but behavior transition between sleeping and 
washing can’t be simulated in a single schedule). 
c) 
Fail to consider the interaction between the family 
members (e.g., having a meal together). This 
interaction is import for residential building energy 
demand estimation.  
In future, we are going to deal with these drawbacks to 
improve the behavior model. About drawback a), more in 
depth analysis of public stochastic data especially in specific 
time interval will be done so that different weights will be 
given during these time intervals in simulation process. For b), 
which had been raised in much previous research, analysis the 
raw TUD to get the results of behavior transition probabilities 
is a feasible option. And about last c) as mentioned in [7], 
when several kinds of schedules from different people in a 
family are required for residential building’s electricity 
demand estimation, it could be a solution to choose schedules 
from generated schedule database, which have meals at the 
same time and bathing in sequence. Also, it should be noted 
that the behavior schedules could not be used directly in the 
energy demand estimation model without appliance operation 
possibility based on behaviors. More work about the 
relationship between behavior and appliance operation is also 
necessary in future.
