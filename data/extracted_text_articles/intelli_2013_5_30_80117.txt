Abstract—Realization of step climbing or descending for a
heavy cart or a wheelchair using human-friendly robot with ma-
nipulators is a technical issue. This paper describes cooperative
step climbing and descending tactics for a manual wheelchair
and a partner robot that is equipped with manipulators driven
by small direct current motors. When the wheelchair and robot
climb or descend a step, these vehicles are linked together by
the robot hands, and some of the manipulator joints are allowed
to move passively. Thus, the manipulators motors do not need
to exert major torque to support the vehicles. The velocity
differences between the two vehicles is used to pass over the step.
When the wheelchair is climbing or descending, the upper links of
the manipulators are pressed against the robot’s chest to stabilize
the wheelchair’s movements. In addition, the forearm links of the
robot are pressed against, or ﬁxed to, the back of the wheelchair.
The robot equipped with manipulators driven by small motors
allows the wheelchair to overcome a step, and then the robot
itself is able to overcome the step by using the wheelchair. In an
experiment, we connected a teleoperation system for the robot
through an intranet and conﬁrmed that these vehicles could
cooperatively climb and descend steps.

INTRODUCTION
Without a human assistant, most wheelchair users are not
able to enter an area that has steps. Thus, they need a spe-
cial wheelchair equipped with a step climbing or descending
mechanism. Wheelchairs with such special mechanisms have
been widely researched and include, for example, a wheelchair
with additional legs [1], a wheelchair with multiple wheels [2]
[3], a wheelchair with multiple wheels connected by active
linkages [4], a wheelchair with an adjustable center of gravity
[5], a wheelchair with a combination of an adjustable center
of gravity and multiple wheels [6], a wheelchair with special
wheels [7], and a tracked vehicle [8]. These mechanisms can
provide the wheelchair with the ability to climb stairs or sur-
mount other obstacles. The research group of the present report
achieved cooperative step climbing of a wheelchair connected
to a wheeled robot by passive links [9] and, separately, of a
wheelchair and a wheeled robot with manipulators [10]. This
report presents the step climbing and descending method for
a wheelchair and a care robot having dual manipulators that
allow the wheelchair user to overcome many of the obstacles
encountered in daily life. Because most of the human-friendly
robots that are used in homes or ofﬁces have small motors
due to their limited body size, it is difﬁcult for such robots to
lift heavy vehicles. In addition, precisely controlling the axes’
angles of the manipulators according to the processes related
to pushing and pulling, and in relation to the vehicle’s incline
is very difﬁcult. In such cases slippage of driving wheels can
occur or the vehicles can tip over. Thus, mobile robots with
manipulators have not previously been used to assist heavy
carts or wheelchairs in step climbing and descending. In the
method used in this study, some of manipulator joints and the
upper links or forearm links of manipulators press passively
against the robot or wheelchair when these vehicles climb or
descend a step. Thus, the motors do not need to exert major
torque to support with vehicles.
The wheelchair users considered in the present study were
assumed to have the upper-body capability of an able-bodied
person. Based on preliminary measurements, the friction coef-
ﬁcients of the vehicles and the ground surface in this research
were assumed to be in the range of 0.6 to 0.9, and the target
step height was set at a maximum of 0.12 [m] (More than 80%
of the observed step heights were lower than 0.12 [m]) .
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the
cooperative step-climbing system and Section III describes the
step climbing and descending procedures. Section IV provides
the theoretical analysis. Section V describes an experiment
and presents the experimental results, and Section VI is the
conclusion.

ROBOT AND WHEELCHAIR
The robot used in this research is the wheeled “Tateyama”
developed in this laboratory (Figure 1). TABLE I lists the
speciﬁcations. When passing over a step, the wheelchair and
robot are deployed in a forward-and-aft conﬁguration (Figure
2). This robot has three sets of wheels consisting of front,
middle, and rear pairs on the left and right sides. The front and
rear pairs are casters whose positions can be shifted, while the
middle pair are the driving wheels. The robot has manipulators
attached to the left and right sides of its upper half: each arm
has 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) and each hand has 1 DOF for
a total of 6 DOF (Figs. 1 and 3). In this study, the length from
Joint 2 (shoulder) to Joint 4 (elbow) is called “Link 2” (length
l2), from Joint 4 (elbow) to Joint 5 (wrist) is called “Link 4”
(length l4), and from Joint 5 (wrist) to the tip of the hand is
called “Link 6” (length l6). The length from Joint 4 (elbow) to
Joint 6 (the location of the connection between the wheelchair
and the robot) is designated l4C. The manipulator joint angles
are -90 [deg] ≤ φ2 ≤ +90 [deg] and 0 [deg] ≤ φ4 ≤ +100

[deg]. The hands consist of two ﬁngers that open and close
in order to grasp items (Figure 3). These axes and the hands
are driven by small direct current (DC) motors (Joints 1, 2: 20
[W], Joints 3, 4: 6 [W], Joint 5: 2.5 [W], 1.5 [W]). The robot
also has a stopper mounted on the front part of its body (Figs.
4 (a) and 5 (a)). The stopper limits the passive rotational travel
of the robot manipulators and thus enables the robot to imitate
the operation of a human pushing an object by limiting the
passive rotation about the shoulder joint as the upper arm is
pushed into the chest of the robot when the wheelchair climbs
(Figure 5 (a)) and descends a step (Figure 5 (b)).
The wheelchair (NOVA Integral-ME) has a shape typical
of wheelchairs currently available in the market (Figure 1).
TABLE II provides the speciﬁcations. This is a manually
operated chair to which an electric drive unit was added. In

this study, the wheelchair is operated manually by the user,
but it is also equipped a push handle mechanism on the back
that is held by the robot hands (Figure 3). This system needs
2.07 [m] step length. The push handle mechanism is composed
of a rotary shaft that allows passive rotation and a stopper
for use when the robot is climbing or descending. The hand
mechanism grasps the shaft to connect the two vehicles. The
angle φ6 is formed by the wheelchair with Link 4 (Figure 2).
The stopper of the wheelchair is composed of front and rear
bars (Figs. 6 (a) and (b)), and is mounted on the rear side.
When the robot is climbing or descending, the sides of the
robot are opened, and the two manipulators are inserted into
the stopper (Figure 6 (a)). The robot pushes the front bars to lift
its front wheels (Figure 6 (a)). The rear bars are used to prevent
it from tipping over backward when the robot’s mass position
shifts behind the contact point between the center wheels and
the ground (Figure 6 (b)).

Figure 7 is a diagram of the system conﬁguration. The
motors mounted on the robot are connected to Faulhaber
motion controllers (Faulhaber MCDC3006-S, MCDC3003-S).
In turn, these are connected to a notebook PC mounted on the
robot. The motors are controlled via commands issued using
the Faulhaber Motion Manager 4 software package. The robot
employs a camera built into the PC, and the moving images
from that camera and the Motion Manager 4 operating window
are displayed on the notebook PC mounted on the robot.
This notebook PC uses RealVNC remote access and control
software and data is transmitted over the intranet as-is to the
display of the PC used by the caregiver in a different location.
The caregiver and the wheelchair user both wear headsets
and use Skype telecommunication software to communicate
verbally. The caregiver’s headset is connected to the caregiver’s
PC, and the wheelchair user’s headset is connected to the PC
on the robot. The caregiver controls the robot by operating
Motion Manager 4 from his PC. The keyboard commands
for Motion Manager 4, which are issued using JoyToKey
software, correspond to the manipulation by the caregiver to
operate the robot. The robot has internal and external sensors
(encoders and touch sensors ). Thus, the robot is moved by
the information integrated in the sensors’ signals with the
commands from the caregiver.
III.
PROCESS OF MOVING OVER A STEP
When encountering a step, the robot hands grasp the rotary
shaft of the wheelchair push handle mechanism, thus linking
itself to the wheelchair. The chair is then controlled to raise
ﬁrst its front wheels, and then its back wheels, onto the
upper level of the step. The ascent and descent processes are
described below. The stages shown in Figs. 8–11 correspond
to (1)–(32) below; “Forward” or “Backward” and signiﬁes the
robot or the wheelchair’s motion ahead or behind, respectively.

“Free” is the state in which the vehicle does not do anything.
“Stop” is the state in which the vehicle does not move.
[Stage 1]
(1) The robot hand grasps the wheelchair push handle to
link the two vehicles. Joints 2, 4, and 6 are allowed to rotate
passively until the ascent of the wheelchair has been com-
pleted. (2) The robot controller stops the robot. The wheelchair
user manipulates the handrims as if to move forward, lifting the
front wheels. (3) As the wheelchair tilt increases, if the location
of the wheelchair’s center of mass shifts behind the contact
point between the back wheels and the ground, the chair exerts
forces on the manipulators, causing passive rotation about Joint
2 (Figure 5 (b)). In this case, the bottom part of the manipulator
upper-arm link comes into contact with the stopper and limits
the extent of the rotation (Figure 5 (b)). Thus, the robot
supports the wheelchair from behind to prevent the wheelchair
from tipping over backward. (4) The robot moves forward and
the wheelchair user manipulates the handrims to adjust the
difference between the speeds of the two vehicles, so that the
front wheels of the wheelchair are placed on the upper level
of the step. After completion of stage 1, the wheelchair user
does not perform any operations until the end of stage 2.
[Stage 2]
(5) The robot continues to move forward while pushing the
wheelchair from behind. (6) The back wheels of the wheelchair
then come into contact with the step. (7) The robot continues
to push on the wheelchair so that the rear wheels of the
wheelchair climb up onto the step. The robot supports the
wheelchair during this process to prevent the wheelchair from
tipping over backward. (8) Once the wheelchair rear wheels
have reached the upper level of the step, the robot stops.

(9) After stage 2, the rear wheels of the robot are folded
upward. The sides of the robot are opened, and the two
manipulators are inserted into the stopper (Figure 6 (a)). The
wheelchair user holds the handrims and maintains the position
of the wheelchair. The robot moves forward, the manipulator
forearm link comes into contact with the stopper of the
wheelchair (Figure 6 (a)). (10) The robot continues to push on
the wheelchair and the front wheels of the robot are lifted. (11)
As the robot tilt increases, if the location of the center of mass
of the robot shifts behind the contact point between its middle
wheels and the ground, the robot begins to tip over backward,
but part of the manipulator forearm link comes into contact
with the stopper of the wheelchair and limits the extent of
rotation (Figure 6 (b)). Thus, the wheelchair supports the robot
and prevents it from tipping over backward. (12) The robot
then moves forward and the wheelchair user manipulates the
handrims, thereby adjusting the difference between the speeds
of the two vehicles so that the front wheels of the robot are
placed on the upper level of the step.
[Stage 4]
(13) Both vehicles move forward. (14) The middle wheels
of the robot come into contact with the step. The wheelchair
pulls the robot, and the value of the normal reaction from the
step on the robot middle wheels (driving wheels) is increased.
Consequently, the force of the manipulators prevent the robot
from falling down. The middle wheels of the robot then start to
climb the step. (15) Both vehicles continue to move forward.
(16) The center wheels of the robot are able to climb the step.
Once the robot middle wheels have reached the upper level of
the step, both vehicles are stopped.

(17) The robot hand grasps the wheelchair push handle to
link the two vehicles. The sides of the robot are opened, and
the two manipulators are inserted into the wheelchair stopper
(Figure 6 (a)). Joint 1 is ﬁxed. Joints 2 to 6 are allowed to rotate
passively until the descent of the robot has been completed.
In the robot descending process (stages 5, 6), the front wheels
of the robot are closed and the rear wheels are folded upward.
Both vehicles move backward. (18) After the rear wheel axes
of the robot reach the corner of the step, the robot tilt increases
and the robot begins to tip over backward. However, at this
stage the forearm link comes into contact with the wheelchair
stopper and limits the extent of rotation (Figure 6 (b)). (19)
Thus, the wheelchair supports the robot and prevents it from
tipping over backward. (20) As a result, the middle wheels of
the robot are able to descend the step.
[Stage 6]
(21) Both vehicles continue to move backward. (22) The
wheelchair moves faster than the robot, and thus the wheelchair
front stopper pushes on the manipulator forearm link. The front
wheel axes of the robot reach the corner of the step. (23) The
wheelchair stops, and the robot continues to move. (24) As a
result, the front wheels of the robot are able to descend the
step.
[Stage 7]
(25) In the wheelchair descent process (stages 7, 8), the
front wheels of the robot are opened and the rear wheels are
lowered. The sides of the robot are closed (Figure 3). Joints
2, 4, and 6 are allowed to rotate passively until the descent of

the wheelchair has been completed. (26) As the robot moves
backward, the wheelchair user does not perform any operations
until the end of stage 7, and the wheelchair is pulled by the
robot. The rear wheels of the wheelchair begin to descend
the step. (27) The upper arm pushes against the chest (robot
stopper) to limit the passive rotation about the shoulder axes.
Thus, the robot supports the wheelchair during this process to
prevent the wheelchair from tipping over backward. (28) The
rear wheels of the wheelchair descend the step.
[Stage 8]
(29) Both vehicles continue to move backward. (30) After
the front wheel axes of the wheelchair reach the corner of
the step, the wheelchair user manipulates the handrims as if
to lift the front wheels. (31) The wheelchair user increases
the wheelchair speed with both hands, and the incline of the
wheelchair begin to decrease. (32) As a result, the rear wheels
of the wheelchair are able to descend the step.

THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
The requirements of preventing slippage in stage 1 are
listed below. Figs. 12, 13 show f1x, f2z, ··· , f6z.
(i)
µ > |f5x|/f6z (φ2 +φ4 +φ6 = 0)
(ii)
µ > |f1x|/f2z (φ2 +φ4 +φ6 = 0)
(iii)
µ > |f5x|/f6z (φ2 +φ4 +φ6 = 24.54 [deg])
(iv)
µ > |f1x|/f2z (φ2 +φ4 +φ6 = 24.54 [deg])
(i) and (ii) are the requirements to lift the front wheels of the
wheelchair from the ground (Figure 8 (1)–(2)). (iii) and (iv) are
the requirements to prevent the wheelchair from tipping over
backward (Figure 8 (3)–(4)). Here, 24.54 [deg] is the maximum
incline of the wheelchair when the wheelchair operator climbs
a step, and the height between the lowest point on the front
wheel tread surface and the ground surface below the step is
ht = 0.200 [m] (Figure 12). It was observed that people tend
to raise the front wheels higher than the step they intend to
traverse when actually operating a wheelchair. Thus, ht was
measured for ﬁve participants and the results were used when
specifying a maximum tilt angle.
Figure 12 shows the stage 1 state in which the wheelchair
center of mass is forward of the contact point between the
rear wheels and the ground (Figure 8 (1)–(2)). At this time
point, the robot is stopped, the wheelchair is propelled, and the
robot exerts a backward force by pulling on the wheelchair.
Figure 13 shows the state when the tilt of the wheelchair is
increasing, and the wheelchair center of mass is behind the
contact point between the rear wheel and the ground (Figure
8 (3)–(4)). When the situation shown in Figure 12 changes
to that shown in Figure 13, the manipulators rotate passively.
In this procedure, the stoppers limit the amount of passive
rotation about the robot shoulder joint (Figure 5 (b)).
ΣB is the basic coordinate system for the robot, where
contact point B is between the robot middle (driving) wheels
and the ground is the origin (Figure 13). Joints 2 (shoulder),
4 (elbow), and 6 (location where the hands hold the push
handle) are controlled passively. The position vectors for
these joints in system ΣB are expressed as Bp2i = [x2i z2i]T
(i = 1 ∼ 3), where Bp2 = [x2 z2]T = [lLB
RB + hLB]T, Bp4 =
[x4 z4]T = [lLB + l2 cosφ2
RB + hLB + l2 sinφ2]T, and Bp6 =
[x6 z6]T = [lLB + l2 cosφ2 + l4c cos(φ2 + φ4)
RB + hLB +
l2 sinφ2 +l4c sin(φ2 +φ4)]T (Figure 2).
In the same way, the position vectors for the contact points
between the robot front and rear wheels and the ground are

expressed as Bpfwb = [WB f 0]T and BprwB = [−WBr 0]T, re-
spectively. The body of the robot, neglecting the manipulators,
is Link 0 with mass m0. If the centers of mass of the robot body
and each manipulator link (Links 2, 4, and 6) are denoted by
Bpg j = [xg2 j zg2 j]T (where j = 0–3), then the center of mass
of the entire robot BpGB = [xGB zGB]T is given by BpGB =
(Σ3
j=0mB
2 jpg2 j)/Σ3
j=0m2 j. The driving force vector for the robot
middle wheels is f1 = [f1x 0]T, and the resistance force from
the ground surface is f2 = [0 f2z]T. Additionally, the resistance
force at the robot front wheels is f3 = [0 f3z]T, and that at the
rear wheels is f4 = [0 f4z]T . The reaction force from the linked
wheelchair is given by fL = [fl cos(φ2 +φ4)
fl sin(φ2 +φ4)]T.
ΣA for the wheelchair is the coordinate system ﬁxed at the
point of contact between the wheelchair rear wheels and the
ground, A. In ΣA, the wheelchair center of mass is located at
ApGA = [xGA zGA]T = [lr cos(φ2 + φ4 + φ6) − hmsin(φ2 + φ4 +
φ6)
lr sin(φ2 +φ4 +φ6)+hm cos(φ2 +φ4 +φ6)+RA]T, and the
push handle location (where it is held by the robot hand) Pc
is Apc = [xc zc]T = [−lLA cos(φ2 +φ4 +φ6)−hLA sin(φ2 +φ4 +
φ6)
−lLA sin(φ2 +φ4 +φ6)+hLA cos(φ2 +φ4 +φ6)+RA]T.
The driving force at the wheelchair rear wheels is f5 =
[f5x 0]T, and the resistance force felt at the ground surface is
f6 = [0 f6z]T. Furthermore, the reaction force from the linked
robot is given by f ′
L = [−fl cos(φ2 +φ4)
− fl sin(φ2 +φ4)]T.
Summing the total forces on the wheelchair exerted by
the ground surface (resistance) and by the linked robot for
fΣA ∈ R2, we ﬁnd that fΣA = [f5x − fl cos(φ2 + φ4)
f6z −
fl sin(φ2+φ4)]T. When the linked vehicles are moving together
in static equilibrium, the equilibrium for both the x and z axes
yields (1), while the equilibrium of moments about the point
of contact between the wheelchair rear wheels and the ground
yields (2). Here, g = [0 −g]T is gravitational acceleration.

where z6 = RB + hLB + l2 sinφ2 + l4c sin(φ2 + φ4)). When the
robot acts statically in stage 1, (7) holds, and the equilibrium
in the x and z axes gives us
fΣB +MBg = 0
(7)
Here, fΣB ∈ R2 is the sum of forces on the robot due to re-
sistance at the ground surface and from the linked wheelchair,
and fΣB = [f1x + fl cos(φ2 +φ4)

k=2 fkz + fl sin(φ2 +φ4)]T.
From (7), we obtain (8) and (9).
f1x = −fl cos(φ2 +φ4)

f2z = MBg− fl sin(φ2 +φ4)− f3z − f4z
(9)
During the process of moving over a step, while the
manipulators are pulling the robot wheelchair (Figure 12), the
manipulators and stoppers do not come into contact. By the
equilibrium of moments about the contact point between the
robot driving wheel and the ground during this time, we obtain
BpGB ×MBg + Bp2 ×fL +B pfwB ×f3 +B prwB ×f4 = 0 (10)
from which is obtained
xGBMBg− fl{x2sin(φ2 +φ4)−z2 cos(φ2 +φ4)}

(11)
When the robot is supporting the wheelchair from behind
(Figure 13), passive rotation about Joint 2 (shoulder) is limited
by the stopper. At such times, Link 2 (the upper arm of the
manipulator) can be treated as a part of the robot body and
the equilibrium of moments about the contact point between
the robot driving wheels is represented as
BpGB ×MBg + Bp4 ×fL +B pfwB ×f3 +B prwB ×f4 = 0 (12)

We obtain f3z and f4z from (10) and (12). In addition,
µ > |f1x|/f2z or µ > |f5x|/f6z can be calculated from (3)–(6),

EXPERIMENT
An experiment was carried out using this system under an
environment of step height 0.12 [m] and friction coefﬁcient
µ = 0.72 (Figure 14). The wheelchair user and robot operator
were both able-bodied adult males. The wheelchair user and
the robot were placed on one ﬂoor of the Toyama National
College of Technology, and the robot operator was on another
ﬂoor of the same building. The robot operator performed his
task over the intranet while observing the situation via a
camera and communicating with the wheelchair user over a
voice link.
If the wheelchair was too close to the step in stage 1,
the front wheels bumped into the vertical riser of the step.
However, following instructions from the wheelchair user, the
robot controller was able to back up the two linked vehicles
together and re-start the ascent. It was then possible for the
front wheels of the wheelchair to climb the step with ease.
Subsequently, during stage 2, the user never needed to push
the wheels. More speciﬁcally, it was possible to lift the chair
onto the upper level of the step by following the procedure
proposed above and using only the forward operation of the
robot. Stages 3 and 4 were then executed.
Stages 5–8 were performed similarly. In these processes,
the wheelchair user twisted his upper body to visually verify
the position of the step behind the wheelchair. It should be
noted that this system is intended for wheelchair users who
can freely move their upper bodies, and one can anticipate

that this movement and posture would be difﬁcult for users
with certain physical limitations.
In the climbing or descending processes, both vehicles
incline in turn. However, because this system only has one
camera installed on the robot, the visual information provided
was limited and the robot operator experienced some difﬁculty
controlling the robot. Thus, it is clear that the construction
of a system to support the robot operator and the wheelchair
operator based on exterior and perhaps other sensors would be
required in the future.

CONCLUSION
This report describes the tactics of cooperative step climb-
ing and descending for a manual wheelchair using a robot that
imitates the motion of the upper arms of a human pushing
his/her chest against a heavy object to move it. We constructed
the robot system and an experiment was carried out that
incorporated teleoperation of the robot over an intranet. The
effectiveness of the handling method for a heavy object was
demonstrated by using a robot with manipulators driven by
small motors. During the climbing or descending processes,
these vehicles incline in turn. However, because this system
only has one camera installed on the robot, the visual infor-
mation supplied to the robot operator was limited. Thus, it is
clear that the robot operator will need an enhanced support
system that can indicate the distance from the step and show
other situations related to the vehicle. It is also clear that the
construction of a system to support the wheelchair operator
based on exterior and perhaps other sensors would be required
in the future.
Despite the above observation, it is worthwhile to demon-
strate that mobile manipulators, which are driven by the small
motors, are capable of handling a heavy cart (wheelchair)
by the method of pressing the manipulator links against the
vehicles in addition to the robot hands. In the future, we will
verify the force necessary to operate the wheelchair using

this method and an autonomous control system to assist the
wheelchair user and robot operator will be built.
