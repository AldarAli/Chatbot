Abstract—The benefits of mobile-learning (m-learning)
have been widely publicised. Research on m-learning is
predominantly from developed nations, with a paucity of
empirical studies on the adoption and implementation of
m-learning in the tertiary institutions of developing
nations.
Although
there
are
numerous
m-learning
projects in developing countries, few research projects
have investigated the feasibility of implementing m-
learning in tertiary institutions in these developing
countries including Zimbabwe. This study attempts to
determine the feasibility of implementing m-learning in
Zimbabwe by investigating factors that influence m-
learning
implementation
and
adoption,
discovering
students’ and lecturers’ attitudes towards m-learning,
and discussing the potentials and challenges of m-
learning. This study will develop a new model for m-
learning, especially for Zimbabwean universities and
other
tertiary
institutions
in
similar
developing
countries, thereby providing a conceptual foundation for
future related research.
Keywords-Mobile-learning;
m-learning;
developing
countries; universities.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The proliferation of mobile devices, particularly mobile
phones, in developing nations, such as Namibia, Kuwait,
India and
Zimbabwe [1]-[4] has
given
hope to
the
integration of mobile technology into education practices.
Studies from developing countries [5]-[9] have shown
positive results
for
m-learning projects in supporting
education in remote locations. In order for m-learning to
succeed in higher education in the developing countries, it is
necessary to understand the factors that influence m-
learning implementation and adoption in such countries. To
this end, this study addresses three research questions:
(1) What
are
the
factors
that
influence
the
implementation of mobile learning in Zimbabwe?
(2) What are students’ perceptions toward the mobile
learning model?
(3) What are the academic staff perceptions toward the
mobile learning model?
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces
related studies followed by discussions on the importance of
m-learning
in
Zimbabwe,
m-learning
potentials
and
challenges and the research gap. Section 3 discusses the
research methodology.
Section 4 presents the research
outcomes. In Section 5, the proposed m-learning model is
presented. Section 6 concludes the study.
II.
BACKGROUND
A.
M-learning definition
There is not yet a consensus on the definition of m-
learning from an academic or professional standpoint which
could be attributed to the rapidly evolving nature of the
field. Literature shows varied definitions of m-learning
revolving around the ambiguity of “mobile” in mobile
learning [10]-[13]. Most studies focus on the mobility of the
technology or the mobility of the learner, with one study
highlighting the mobility of the content [14]. Earlier
definitions of m-learning took a techno-centric perspective,
defining m-learning as learning using mobile devices with
an emphasis on the mobility of technologies [15]-[18]. The
focus has shifted from the mobility of the devices to the
mobility of the users [19]-[21]. There is a general consensus
that m-learning involves the use of ubiquitous mobile
devices for learning and teaching. This study focuses on
learner-centred
mobility,
since
learners
use
various
technologies such as mobile devices, their own or other
people’s computers, as they move between settings.
B.
Why M-learning in Zimbabwe
Education is widely accepted as a major factor in
economic development [22]-[24]. Although educational
indicators suggest that there have been improvements in
Zimbabwe, such as increased enrolment across the different
levels of education, the quality of education still faces
noteworthy challenges.
Lack of access to quality education continues to be a
major impediment to economic growth in developing
countries. In Zimbabwe, universities are responsible for
producing highly skilled manpower and are therefore central
to the development of the country. There is a need to
improve access to quality, cost-effective education in
Zimbabwe. M-learning presents an opportunity to improve
the quality of education in Zimbabwe given the availability
of cheaper mobile devices, and that Zimbabwe can by-pass
the fixed telephony network and increase mobile phone
networks. Hence, m-learning has the potential to reach a
wider segment of the population, facilitating the expansion
of educational projects.

Zimbabwe has sixteen universities and eight polytechnic
colleges, these institutions are yet to fully embrace m-
learning. The information and communication technologies
(ICT)
infrastructure
in
some
of
these
institutions
is
underutilised. In teaching and learning, ICT is largely used
for placement of course outlines, notes, assignments and
website
links
[25][26]. The
integration
of ICT
with
education is not uniform in Zimbabwe tertiary institutions.
C.
M-learning potentials
M-learning provides a relatively cheaper means of
integrating education with technology. Mobile devices are
less expensive than personal computers (PCs) or laptops.
The mobile phone density in Zimbabwe is above 100% [2].
Hence, m-learning has the potential to provide more access
to information.
Three important benefits of integrating
education
with
technology
are
access,
support
and
communication [27][28].
The mobile learning research community has proved that
m-learning can enhance, extend and enrich the concept and
activity of learning itself, beyond earlier conceptions of
learning [29]. Some of the possibilities of m-learning
include
situated
learning,
context-aware
learning,
and
personalised learning. M-learning enables learners to have
access to a variety of resources and communities that share
the same interests even in different locations, which
produces a dynamic educational experience [30].
M-learning enables interaction between learners and
lecturers and amongst learners themselves. M-learning
fosters collaboration opportunities for learners [7] [30] [31].
There
is
evidence
that
collaboration
produces
better
understanding [32]. Learners can now benefit from a range
of user-generated content that can be accessed through
various mobiles such as podcasts, which is native to
mobiles; Wikipedia, that can be accessed on low-end
mobiles and YouTube, which is accessed on high-end
mobiles.
Most learners own and love mobile technologies and use
them regularly in their personal lives [33][34].
It seems
likely that these same learners would want to use their
mobile devices to personalize their education and make it
more engaging.
There are a number of m-learning pilot projects that
have been carried out in developing countries, such as m-
learning curriculum framework in South Africa [19],
smartphone-based m-learning with physician trainees in
Botswana [35], using mobile phone cameras for science
learning and teaching in Sri-Lanka [36]. The pilot projects
in developing countries have yielded positive results, which
is encouraging so far. All countries need to educate the next
generation’s workforce. For developing countries, there is a
need to provide education of an acceptable standard in order
to produce a workforce that is effective and can support
economic growth.
D.
M-learning challenges
M-learning initiatives are infeasible in some developing
nations because of a
myriad
of obstacles.
A major
impediment
to
m-learning
adoption
is
inadequate
infrastructure in the form of unreliable electricity supplies
[37][38] and poor Internet connectivity [29][ 39][40].
Another major barrier to m-learning adoption is the high
initial investment costs. There are high costs associated with
equipment, connectivity, technical support, training and
maintenance [31][41].
Some developing countries have educational policies
restricting the use of mobile devices for learning, and some
have government officials who are unaware of the potential
of mobile phones to enhance education [27][ 38].
Academics have raised curriculum issues associated
with m-learning from both pedagogical and practical
perspectives
[30].
Lecturers
also
expressed
concerns
regarding privacy and security [42]. There are fears that
confidential information could be potentially exposed to
students and that quality of content could be compromised
when
transferred
to
mobile
learning
activities
[42].
Educators’ concerns about security and privacy can prevent
the effective penetration of mobile technology in the
educational realm [43]. It is important to acknowledge the
concerns raised by the lecturers as downplaying these
concerns
may
prevent
these
key
stakeholders
from
capitalizing on the benefits of mobile technologies in
education.
Technological
constraints
such
as
size
of
device,
multiple standards, numerous operating systems, and low
battery life should also be considered when implementing
m-learning
[20][39][44][45]. It is difficult to address all
barriers to m-learning as the obstacles are wide-ranging
because of the diversity of developing nations.
E.
Research Gap
There is a lack of m-learning models and frameworks
grounded in empirical research in the context of developing
countries. Literature [16][41] attributes this gap in research
to lack of resources, in sharp contrast to developed countries
where m-learning was facilitated by adequate resources and
infrastructure.
Previous researchers have examined the
various combinations of aspects which influence m-learning
implementation [45]-[50]. There are suggestions that models
from developed countries can be applied to developing
nations [41]. However, [38] argues that in developing
countries various factors need to be considered. These
include different levels of infrastructure, the needs and
challenges due to unique cultures, as well as the various
views of what constitutes learning if learners are to benefit
from m-learning.
A review of the available m-learning frameworks from
both developing and developed countries shows that the
existing m-learning frameworks cannot be adopted as there
are
gaps
in
these
conceptual
models,
making
them
inadequate for implementation in the Zimbabwean context

with respect to (1) factors influencing m-learning adoption
(2) challenges to m-learning (3) m-learning characteristics
and (4) pedagogy. There is a need to conduct research which
includes the various aspects as in the proposed conceptual
model to examine how they collectively influence m-
learning implementation.
III. RESEARCH METHODS
The mixed-methods approach will be employed for this
study. Participants for this study will be drawn from m-
learning stakeholders in tertiary institutions comprising
students,
lecturers,
administrators,
librarians
and
information technology (IT) personnel and the relevant
government ministries in Zimbabwe.
The study will adopt an exploratory design because of
the scant previous research on m-learning in tertiary
education
in
Zimbabwe,
starting
with
the
in-depth
interviews followed by focus groups.
In-depth interviews will be used to collect data from the
lecturers, library staff, administrative staff, university IT
staff, mobile service providers, the Ministry of Higher
Education, and the Ministry of ICT. Based on the proposed
conceptual model, the themes to be discussed will include
connectivity,
educational
policies,
themes
based
on
characteristics of m-learning and expectations of lecturers. It
is anticipated that other themes will surface during the
interviews.
Focus groups will be used to elicit learners’ attitudes,
experiences, beliefs and reactions which cannot easily be
obtained by other methods. Purposeful sampling will be
used to select focus groups. The pre-defined themes based
on the proposed model will include usability, Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI), cheaper mobile phones, culture
and learners’ expectations.
It is anticipated that other
themes will emerge from the focus group discussions.
IV. RESEARCH OUTCOMES
It is anticipated that this study will contribute to
theoretical knowledge about various aspects underlying the
successful implementation of m-learning in universities,
both generally, and more specifically in relation to the
mainstream higher education context of Zimbabwe. The
latter
poses a set of challenges that require careful
investigation prior to the introduction of widespread m-
learning in university pedagogy. This study will make a
theoretical contribution in that it will show how each aspect
of
the
proposed
conceptual
model
is
interacting
(moderation/mediating) with others, and how all aspects
will synergistically influence m-learning implementation.
Furthermore, the study seeks to contribute to theoretical
knowledge by offering recommendations regarding m-
learning in developing countries. Students, researchers and
academics will be able to use this model as a reference in
future related studies.
From a practical perspective, the research aims to
introduce an m-learning model for tertiary institutions in
Zimbabwe, to facilitate the integration of technology in their
teaching and learning approaches. It is anticipated that the
m-learning model will encourage m-learning adoption and
implementation in Zimbabwe and will be adopted by this
country’s other educational institutions. The m-learning
model will provide guidelines for instructional designers
and lecturers when designing m-learning activities, blending
these with existing teaching and learning practices. Also, the
universities, the education department of the Zimbabwean
government and other stakeholders will benefit from this
model. This model will enable students to experience
dynamic learning anywhere anytime.
V.
PROPOSED MODEL
The initial proposed m-learning model for Zimbabwe
higher education will be drawn from existing frameworks in
developing countries similar to Zimbabwe [5]-[9] and other
m-learning studies [41][49][51].When reviewing m-learning
studies, some studies emphasis on technical design and
development of technologies. Some studies do not include
challenges to m-learning implementation and do not explain
the importance of learning theories in supporting m-
learning.
Although there are varied characteristics of m-
learning and different factors that influence m-learning
adoption, it is essential to examine the factors that influence
m-learning adoption and the characteristics of m-learning.
The
factors
and
characteristics
impact
m-learning
implementation and adoption especially where m-learning is
in its infancy.
The proposed model depicted in Figure 1
comprises
the
challenges
of
m-learning,
factors
that
influence m-learning adoption, the key characteristics of m-
learning, and pedagogy.
Figure 1. Proposed M-learning Model
A.
Factors influencing m-learning adoption
There are a number of factors that influence m-learning
implementation and adoption. Previous research has shown
that m-learning has become attractive because of cheaper
costs
of
mobile
devices
coupled
with
the
increased
capabilities of these devices [51]. There is a suggestion that
the key factor in adopting m-learning in developing

countries hinges on socio-cultural factors [52]. The study
will investigate the various factors that affect m-learning
adoption and implementation in developing countries, and
seek to find how these factors interact with each other in
influencing m-learning implementation and adoption.
B.
Challenges to m-learning
In the proposed research model, the researcher has taken
into account the challenges associated with m-learning. The
researcher understands that these challenges can impede the
effective design and implementation of m-learning in
Zimbabwe. Literature shows that infrastructure is a major
obstacle when implementing m-learning.
This study will
seek to identify and address challenges that can hinder m-
learning implementation in Zimbabwe.
C.
Characteristics of m-learning
The characteristics of m-learning will be identified in
terms of tertiary institutions in Zimbabwe in order to
produce an m-learning model for this country. Some key
characteristics for m-learning from extant literature are:
ubiquity, mobility, training and support, collaboration,
blending, context, and communication [5]-[9] [48] [53].
D.
Pedagogy
A study by P. Ramsden [54] indicates that there is a
relationship between students’ perceptions of their learning
environment and their approach to learning. M-learning
implementation should therefore take into consideration the
learners’ perceptions of their learning environments as they
can potentially influence m-learning adoption. Early m-
learning research was not explicitly grounded in learning
theories [55]. It is likely that effective integration of mobile
technologies with education will depend on whether m-
learning has been based on sound learning theories.
VI. CONCLUSION
Although the benefits of m-learning have been widely
publicised, there is a scarcity of empirical research on m-
learning for tertiary institutions from developing countries,
particularly
in
Africa.
M-learning
adoption
and
implementation by universities is technically complex given
that the learning involves students, instructors, content and
institutions. In developing countries like Zimbabwe, the
implementation of m-learning is a complex process, made
increasingly so by considerations of infrastructure and
culture. It is anticipated that the proposed model will
capture the various aspects of m-learning in the context of a
developing country and that this model will serve as a
conceptual foundation for future research in m-learning in
Zimbabwe universities and tertiary institutions in other
developing countries.
