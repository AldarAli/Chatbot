Abstract— In this paper, we explore the use of online social
networking (OSN) software as ad-hoc project management
(PM) software. Through the adaptation of specialized OSN
software, project teams can facilitate group collaboration as
they work towards completing project milestones. This study
aims to showcase the importance of sustained engagement
throughout the lifecycle of the project, across both meta-level
engagement with the external community and micro-level
engagement within and among the project team members.
More specifically, this work identifies how OSN technologies
cultivate online community which can be shown to augment
project motivation and participation resulting in project
success. Under the lens of an existing theoretical model, one
which
highlights
individual
collaboration
within
online
community spaces, we measure perceptions of the customized
OSN software before and after its implementation. A content
analysis highlights how successful project teams maximized
features of the system, which is supported by a social network
analysis
(SNA),
which
highlights
levels
of
individual
engagement across the project lifecycle as they relate to online
interaction
and
project
results.
Survey
data
identifies
individual perceptions across various aspects of the system as it
fosters

INTRODUCTION
This
research
builds
atop
preliminary
research
highlighting how online social networking (OSN) software
can facilitate success in project teams [1]. More specifically,
this study measures the adoption of OSN software across
information technology (IT) capstone courses.
When the New Year rang in on January 1, 2016 the
estimated human population on earth was around 7.45 billion
[2]. Of this population, 324 million currently live in the U.S.,
where it is estimated that 87% of the population have access
to the Internet and 73% are using social technologies to
collaborate and communicate online [3]. For digital natives,
or individuals having grown up with internet technologies, it
is estimated that 86% of digital natives participate in some
form of OSN, with some estimates as high as 98% [4] [5] [6]
[7].
Within academic environments, OSN software has found
tremendous success, as grade schools, high-schools and
colleges incorporate various types of social media into the
classroom. In [8], Thoms et al. introduced a shift in modality
away from traditional learning management systems, or
LMS, towards more student-centric OSN software to support
classroom
activities.
In
this
paradigm,
OSN
software
provides users with a common set of tools that focus on
course engagement through higher levels of peer-to-peer
interactions. This research was extended in [9] to show how
OSN software can yield greater levels of interaction and
overall course satisfaction when compared against LMS
software.
This research suggests that OSN software is uniquely
suited to facilitate capstone courses, by providing an
environment that supports intra-group, or project team
communication via wiki and messaging and inter-group, or
course
communication
including
blogs
and
discussion
boards. Grounded in theories of constructivism, engagement
and social presence, the software design was measured using
a content analysis, social network analysis (SNA) and survey
data. Results showcase the beneficial nature of OSN
software as a means for fostering project-level activities as
individuals work towards the completion of their final IT
artifact.
In
the
process,
OSN
software
also
fosters
engagement and interaction.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section
II we introduce background for project-based communities
of practice and identify the role capstone courses play in
higher
education.
Section
III
establishes
a
theoretical
framework that considers constructivism, engagement theory
and social presence theory as integral components of OSN
software used within the academic space. Section IV focuses
on the OSN system design. Section V highlights the research
methodology. Section VI details the results across two
interventions.
Section
VII
provides
a
comprehensive
discussion and analysis of the results section. Section VIII
identifies the limitations of this study. Section IX presents
the conclusion followed by references in Section X.

BACKGROUND
A.
Project-based Communities of Practice
As identified in [10], college courses can be classified as
niche communities of practice, which facilitate, among other
things,
shared
understanding
and
identify
among
participants. In more successful communities of practice,
sustained
engagement and collaboration exist whereby

knowledge-building becomes an intrinsic function of the
community itself [11]. Although not all college courses
mirror these ideals, capstone project courses strive to.
B.
Capstone Courses
This paper focuses primarily on capstone project courses,
which are typically milestone courses for college students
and required for graduation. A popular mechanism adopted
by many colleges and universities is requiring students to
complete a year-long or semester-long capstone project in
their junior or senior year of study in hopes of better
preparing these students for similar activities they would
encounter in the workforce. More so, as identified in [12],
capstone courses aim to provide students with little, to no
industry exposure, with a valuable experience prior to
completing their degree.
Capstone project-based courses are also highly regarded
and
recommended
as
a core
component of effective
undergraduate
education
[13]
[14].
Consequently,
the
inclusion of these projects into the undergraduate experience
has been largely influenced by expectations from industry
that graduates exhibit high-levels of problem solving, oral
and
written
communication,
teamwork
and
project
management
skills
[15]
[16].
These
projects
become
especially important for students who are unable to attain
industry experience prior to graduating, thus making project-
based courses a bare minimum qualification for graduating
students.
Often times, IT capstone courses are team-based, where
groups of students work towards some end-goal.
Where
capstone projects are collaborative in nature, students are
afforded greater opportunities to develop team-based skills
and learn pivotal techniques in cooperation as individuals
coordinate around a central IT artifact. Essentially, team-
based projects help to prepare students to work effectively in
teams [17]. The underlying mechanisms of team-based
capstone projects in IT education and team-based projects in
professional settings are similar because both methods
involve expressing and discussing ideas in order to construct
mutually acceptable explanations. Lainez et al. [18] suggest
that capstone projects deliver skills that consider various
business processes, product development, artifact design,
implementation and also involve teamwork and problem
solving. Problem solving, as identified further in Ayas and
Zeniuk
[19]
can
be
instrumental
in
building
healthy
communities of practitioners.
Students value these experiences as well and capstone
projects offer students a chance to begin developing a
working
portfolio
prior
to
graduation.
Dunlap
[20]
discovered that engaging students in learning and problem-
solving activities reflects the true nature and requirements of
workplace
communities
and
help
students
feel
better
prepared to work effectively in their profession; a viewpoint
supported by students as well [15]. Furthermore, Clarke [21]
identified that industry-aligned projects increased student
confidence and allowed students to explore areas of the IT
field not covered in the academic curriculum.
Ultimately, within IT capstone courses, students are
presented
with
opportunities
to
consolidate
their
understandings of “systems analysis, software development
lifecycles, specific software design support tools, entity
relationship modelling, entity life histories, database design,
web
site
design,
or
web
server
programming”
[22].
Furthermore, when students engage in experiential learning,
they become active participants in the learning process,
constructing their own internal knowledge through both
personal and environmental experiences [22, 23]. Lynch et
al. [24] found that IT capstone projects provide students the
opportunity to build, not only technical skills of the
discipline, but the social aspects of systems development as
well.
III.
THEORY
Human computer interaction (HCI) is an interdisciplinary
field that encompasses concepts from numerous fields
including computer and behavioral science. The theoretical
model adopted in this research is one first proposed [25] and
extended in [7] [8] and considers three primary constructs for
fostering interaction within collaborative environments. The
first construct focuses attention on the individual and their
perceptions of their role within the project space. The second
construct is engagement theory, which represents how
individuals work collaboratively within the project space. A
third construct, social presence theory, represents the project
space as a thriving community.
A.
Constructivism
Constructivism grounds a community to the individual
and considers the interactions and experiences of the
individual as crucial components of cooperation and goal
achievement [26] [27]. Such interactions and experiences
also consider a participant’s
engagement
with
certain
technologies. Largely linked to the work of Piaget [28], who
first theorized that learning can be based on the interaction
and experiences of the learner within a specific context,
constructivism provides a holistic view of individual learning
and
how
individuals
interact
within
larger
groups.
Additionally, Squires [29] states that constructivism focuses
on individual control, with individuals making decisions that
match their own needs. Thus, within a project space,
individuals should be able to control how they interact with
other team members and in a manner they feel most
comfortable. Using the simplistic functionality of social
software, instead of more complex PM software, individuals
are provided with more flexibility and control.
B.
Engagement Theory
In many capstone projects, teamwork is required, which
requires
communication
and
cooperation.
Engagement
theory states that individuals must be meaningfully engaged
in project activities through interaction with others, which
can be facilitated and enabled through specialized software
[30]. Project software is not known for their exciting and
group-oriented features, but OSN software is. OSN software
provides environments that embrace interaction. Therefore
by leveraging the popularity of OSN software, we hope to
create an environment that promotes dialogue among team
members.

Dalsgaard [31], whose research is supported in Waycott
et al. [32] argues that social software can be used to support
the constructivist approach set forth in the previous section.
Social
software
engenders
a
cooperative
approach
to
learning, where individuals work towards establishing a
cohesive unit. In this respect, social software can refer to any
loosely connected application where individuals are able to
communicate with one another, and track discussions across
the internet [33]. Consequently, the development of OSN
software must consider the individual’s point of view in such
a manner that they are presented with a certain level of
control and autonomy within the larger community. Once
again, social software supports these philosophies and makes
participants the locus of control within a larger self-
governing environment.
C.
Social Presence Theory
We introduce Social Presence Theory to understand the
manifestation of our OSN as a dynamic and vibrant
collaborative
project
space.
Social
Presence
Theory
considers the degree to which an individual’s perception of
the online community, affects his or her participation in the
community [34] [35]. When individuals believe that others
are interacting and exchanging information, individuals may
be more inclined to engage themselves or not. As discussed
in Garrison et al. [36], alternative methods for enhancing
social presence must be explored to help substitute for the
lack of visual cues individuals receive in face-to-face
settings. Research by Richardson and Swan [37] identified
that a student’s perceived level of social presence directly
relates to their perceived learning. From the lens of social
presence theory, we consider students’ ideas as knowledge
objects that are improved continually through collaboration
by discussing inconsistencies and resolving doubts [38]. In
fact, the essence of social presence is that collaboration can
promote conscious development of cohesive ideas that no
single
individual
could
have
developed
alone.
Thus,
pedagogically, we can view students as active constructors of
knowledge who capitalize on each other’s reasoning to
gradually
refine
ambiguous,
figurative,
and
partial
understandings of important concepts. This suggests that
increasing levels of community can yield higher levels of
learning. OSN technologies work well in this regard and
have successfully helped enhance social presence through
peer feedback [39] and individual profiles and avatars [40],
both of which are implemented within the OSN designs we
investigated. Additionally, Thoms et al. [41] discovered that
OSN technologies can foster higher levels of course learning
through openness and collaboration and can align very well
with course learning objectives.
Together, these three theories provide a holistic model
that considers course community, individual learning styles
and how each can be influenced and enhanced with
technology.
IV.
SYSTEM DESIGN
A.
Project Management Software
The field of project management (PM) is quite mature
and with this maturity comes a seasoned array of PM
software to support project-based activities. Intrinsically, PM
software looks to provide project teams with the ability to
manage project activities including scheduling and planning.
Scheduling typically refers to resource management and
accounting and planning typically centers on organizing
different phases of the project. Wikipedia alone compares
over 300 PM platforms, from desktop platforms such as
Microsoft Project to web-based platforms such as Basecamp.
While PM software may be a necessity for large-scale
projects,
for
small-scale
and
short-term
projects,
sophisticated and complex PM software can be time-
consuming. Additionally, adopting and learning to use PM
software can be a daunting feat for nascent users, especially
when the duration of a project is less than a year. Therefore,
this study introduces OSN software as ad-hoc PM software;
one supported by underlying theories that mirror students’
underlying learning experiences.
B.
OSN Software as PM Software
Prior to Web 2.0 and the explosion of social software,
Preece [42] highlighted the difficulty that social software
designers have in controlling interaction. To date, OSN
designers still struggle to develop software that is both easy
to use and useful. In this research, we extend existing OSN
software, Elgg v1.8.2, which has already shown success in
supporting our theoretical constructs [7] [8] [25] [51]. Elgg
was founded in 2004 and is an open source OSN engine
offering individuals and organizations with many of the
components
required
to
implement
an
online
social
environment.
Elgg provides an extensible platform for constructing a
project-based OSN due to its large number of developer
plugins. Identifying planning and scheduling as important
criteria for project management Elgg provides support for the
following features:

Individual profiles to allow users to customize their
online profile.

Communities and community profiles for unique and
isolated project spaces.

Instant
Messenger
for real-time
communication
when team members are working synchronously but
in remote locations.

Group and individual blogs for sharing information
and providing project updates.

Wikis for collaborative writing and documentation.

Calendars and notifications to create events and
reminders for project milestones.

File uploads with version control to support project
documentation.

Discussion boards for asynchronous conversational
threads on project topics and activities.

can be customized with specific modules, by default, users
are presented with active content from across the site, which
can be filtered by user or date.

C.
Collaborative Writing Software
A significant artifact within a project-based OSN centers
on the analysis and design of project objectives. As a shared
artifact,
collaborative
writing
software
functions
as
a
mechanism to
support information sharing and
group
knowledge construction. A specific subset of collaborative
writing, wiki software utilizes Internet-based technologies to
facilitate the collaborative writing process by keeping track
of page creation and page edits. Wikis provide unique
opportunities
for
obtaining
and
managing
user-driven
content
and
are
also
effective
for
facilitating
virtual
collaboration and tracking the evolution of user-driven
content, which aids in coordination and synchronization of
group information. Wikis also provide for a shared dialogue
and centralize information among project collaborators.
Additionally, wikis allow members to engage in group
learning and share in knowledge construction within a virtual
community [43]. These notions are important for project
teams working towards shared goals and shared meaning.
When wiki technology was first introduced, prior to the
Web 2.0 explosion, collaborative writing was limited to early
HTML-style markup [44]. Current wiki-technologies provide
collaborators
with
a
wide
range
of
tools
and
share
commonalities with other OSN software [45]. Illustrated in
Figure 3, today’s wikis are no longer syntax-based, with
difficult
HTML-style
markup
notation.
Today’s
wikis
incorporate rich-text editors, allowing even novice web users
to contribute, a notion that is particularly important for
student users, many of whom have limited experience
constructing wikis. Recent research by Xu [46] implemented
wiki-technology in project-based computer science courses,
highlighting how wiki technology helped to centralize and
capture all project activities through wiki pages created by
both the instructor and students. Additionally, Popescu [47]
discovered that wikis also helped students to find interesting
information; by reading other teams' wiki pages, students
could check their progress, see how they compare with
others teams, look for inspiration and models and discover
different ideas and approaches. A limitation identified in He
and Yang [48] is that a wiki should not be a tool that aims to
supplant communication channels and works best when
additional modes exist. This limitation is accounted for in
our OSN since the wiki comprises only one component.

content, link to existing content and control who has access
to edit or view a document.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
This research aims to measure the proposed design and is
best categorized as a proof-of-concept case study. Our
population of users consisted of 11 teams across two IT
capstone courses. To measure how OSN software can be
used as ad-hoc PM software, we measure how well the
software
facilitated
team
collaboration,
peer-to-peer
interaction, learning and course community. Each team
worked together over a seventeen-week period and each
team’s goal was to construct a fully-functional IT artifact by
the seventeenth week. The IT artifact comprised 40% of the
project
grade.
Project
documentation
and
weekly
collaborative assignments constituted 30% and a course-
wide discussion board also constituted 30%.
Project teams were comprised of three to four students
and were formulated by the instructor prior to the start of the
course. Due to a late-semester change, one project team
consisted of two members.
In addition to the course-wide community, each team was
assigned a designated OSN community, which consisted of
file repository, blog and wiki space, with pre-defined
templates for each of the project development phases. At the
end of the semester, all teams were expected to present their
final artifact to the class.
It was highly suggested that project teams utilize the wiki
templates, as outlined by the instructor, but it was not
required. As illustrated in Figure 3, predefined templates
were constructed for each community space and included
pages for: 1) Project Initiation, 2) Project Analysis, 3)
Project 4) Design, 5) Project Construction, 6) Project
Implementation, 7) Final Project Documentation, 8) Phase II
and 9) Project Support. Students participating in the capstone
course would already have taken a course on formal software
methods and be familiar with the systems development
lifecycle. The wiki aimed to realize knowledge acquired in
this course.
Data was captured from each capstone course, over a
period of six months.
VI.
RESULTS
To explore how specialized OSN software can support
project-based courses and enhance classroom learning, we
collected data from multiple sources. Our first point of data
collection is through survey research, which measures
perceived levels of learning, community and interaction. To
support survey findings, we perform a social network
analysis and look at in-bound and out-bound interactions
among OSN participants.
A.
Population & Demographics
Demographic information was captured through pretest
surveys
conducted
across
two
classes.
Including
the
instructor, the total user population was 45. 15% of
participants were female and 85% were male. 52% of
participants were aged 18 to 25, 34% were aged 26 to 35,
12% were aged 36-50 and 2% were aged 50 and above. All
participants were members of the IT capstone course, an
upper-division course required for graduation.
B.
Content Generation
Detailed in Table 1 is a breakdown of wiki contributions
between Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 consisted of 22
students, of which 16 played an active role in editing the
project wiki resulting in 401 page edits across 114 unique
pages. Group 2 consisted of 18 students, of which 16 played
an active role in editing the project wiki resulting in 222
page edits across 108 unique pages.

Wiki Perceptions on Project Management
Detailed in Table 5 are factors relating to the wikis ability
to facilitate project management. In pretest results 83% of
individuals agreed or strongly agreed that a wiki could help
facilitate project management. Levels of agreement rose to
86% in posttest responses. Similarly, pretest results show
that 83% of individuals agreed or strongly agreed that a wiki
could help organize project information, which rose to 91%
in posttest responses. Additionally, 79% of individuals
agreed or strongly agreed that the wiki would foster content
creation and posttest results showed that 85% of individuals
agreed or strongly agreed. Finally, 80% of individuals agreed
or strongly agreed that the wiki would be an excellent way to
showcase the capstone project. Levels of agreement rose to
86% in posttest results.

Social Network Analysis (SNA)
1)
SNA Background
Social network analysis (SNA) is used to identify and
measure interactions within an associated social structure.
More specifically, an SNA utilizes numerous statistical
measures for analyzing activity within a social structure and
often times results in a visualized graph of the network as
shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. The ability to view social
graph structure and community evolution can be a crucial
measure of a learning design and can serve as an early
indicator of its success [49].
2)
SNA Design
In this study, SNA graphs were constructed in Microsoft
Excel, with the 2014 NodeXL Template extension. NodeXL
is a free and open source extension, which provides a range
of basic network analysis and visualization features [50].
Using NodeXL, Figure 4 and Figure 5 were constructed
using the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, which positions
team members, or nodes, in a manner so that all edges are of
more or less equal length and there are as few crossing edges
as possible. Arrows, represent weighted interactions and
larger arrows indicate a greater number of interactions
between members. Bi-directional arrows occur when there is
interactivity between students, measured in-degree and out-
degree values. A higher average value for in-degree and out-
degree
indicates
that
those
students
more
frequently
interacted with one another.
3)
OSN Sociograms
Illustrated in Figure 4 and Figure 5 are sociograms for
two capstone courses utilizing the OSN software for PM-
activities. Discussed in more detail in the Discussion, team
members are identified by their group letter and group
project grade. For example, B3(95) represents the third
member of Group B and their final project grade was 95 out
of 100.

degree. For Group 2, average in-degree / out-degree was 5.9
with a standard deviation of 3.91 for in-degree and 2.68 for
out-degree.
Betweenness centrality is an indicator of a node's
centrality in a network and is calculated using the number of
shortest paths from all vertices to all others that pass through
a node. For Group 1, average betweenness centrality was
7.81 with a standard deviation of 5.16. For Group 2,
betweenness centrality was 9.2 with a standard deviation of
8.77. Density, which is the count of the number of
connections divided
by the total
number of possible
connections, was .43 for Group 1 and .35 for Group 2.
Finally, the average final group grade was 92 for Group 1
and 88 for Group 2.

DISCUSSION
The overarching goals of this study is to present OSN
software as a viable option for capstone courses, one that
allows users to participate in course-level and team-level
activities. To explore these claims, OSN software was
introduced to two IT capstone courses, where we measured
its ability to foster peer-to-peer interactions and support
project success.
A.
OSN Promotes Teamwork
An important role of the OSN was to facilitate the
workflow of project teams. To measure this, we consider a
couple of factors. First, we focus attention on survey
responses relating to the wiki’s ability to enhance group
cohesion,
collaboration
and
interaction.
Pretest
results
showed a majority of individuals believed that the wiki could
facilitate
cohesion
(82%),
collaboration
(82%)
and
interaction
(75%).
More
so,
however,
it
was
very
encouraging to discover high levels of agreement in the
posttest that the wiki actually contributed to higher levels of
cohesion (78%), collaboration (83%) and interaction (74%).
Engagement
theory
is
concerned
with
meaningful
engagement. This amounts to finding the right tools for the
right projects. Wiki software is geared towards collaboration
and interaction where individuals bear witness to the
evolution of a project’s analysis and design. Wiki software
also reinforces the notion that projects can be both user-
centric
and
group-oriented,
thus
facilitating
individual
ownership and motivation.
Referring back to the sociograms in Figure 4 and Figure
5, the proximity of nodes reflects that these nodes interacted
with one another more frequently. In other words, the closer
a set of nodes are to one another, the more cohesive that
group
of
nodes
are
as
a
single
unit.
In
dynamic
environments, bonds tend to strengthen as a network
becomes denser. As one would expect within capstone
projects, where students are working collaboratively towards
project milestones, the network graph will likely organize in
a manner where project members are relatively close to one
another. In Figures 4 and Figure 5, this is the case, with the
exception of a couple peripheral nodes (i.e. C1 and G2). This
outcome would be expected in any organizational network
where individuals, while functioning as part of the larger
community, are still responsible for working within their
own respective project teams in order to accomplish project
milestones. Taken together, the quantitative results at hand
indicate that students utilized the OSN to set achievable
project
goals,
resolve
misunderstandings
about
design
decisions, and negotiate deliverables, similar to the way
team-based IT projects function in the real world. In this
way, collaborating students used one another as a resource

for learning, while also working to complete their project
milestones.
B.
OSN and Wiki as Support for Project Success
An objective of this study was to investigate the role of
OSN software in promoting project success. An important
measure of project success stems from a group’s ability to
establish the parameters of success through analysis of
business requirements and the design and construction of the
IT artifact. Through an analysis of survey responses and
grading of each team’s final IT artifact, it was evident that
the OSN helped contribute, in part, to each team’s project
success. In pretest survey responses, it was encouraging to
discover that the majority of individuals believed that the
OSN wiki would facilitate project management (83%),
project
information
organization
(85%)
and
content
generation (83%). More so, it was encouraging to discover
higher levels of agreement in posttest responses, where
individuals perceived that the OSN wiki did, in fact,
contribute to higher levels of project management (86%),
project information organization (91%) and content creation
(85%). Each of these factors is an important dimension of
project management that promotes a shared understanding of
technical requirements, which helps to mitigate expensive
and time consuming rework. This concept can apply to both
short-term and long-term real-world IT projects.
We acknowledge that survey results paint a limited
picture, which is why we also dive into the interactions that
took place across the OSN. Average project grades indicate a
stronger performance by teams within Group 1 (92%)
compared to teams within Group 2 (88%). We attribute this,
in part, to the patterns of interaction that took place within
the OSN and the levels of social capital that existed across
both networks. More dense and active networks, such as with
Group 1, tend to result in more communication and
collaboration, which, in turn, can contribute to higher quality
output. This is discussed in more detail in the next section.
C.
OSN Software Builds Social Capital
Within IT capstone courses, and academic courses in
general, OSN software provides opportunities for greater
levels of social capital. Simply defined, social capital is the
common
social
resource
that
facilitates
information
exchange, knowledge sharing, and knowledge construction
through continuous interaction [51]. Social Presence Theory,
which focuses on the degree to which an individual’s
perception of the online community, in its entirety, affects
his or her participation in that community.
Analyzing the levels of community in Group 1 and
Group 2, our first point of measurement refocuses attention
back to the survey responses and, specifically, those
constructs relating to the OSN software’s ability to enhance
interaction and community. Pretest results were encouraging
and showed that individuals were positive from the start that
community would be important (86%) and that an OSN
could
be
an
important
resource
for
facilitating
this
community (86%). These perceptions continued throughout
the lifecycle of the intervention and posttest results showed
high levels of agreement that a sense of community did play
an important role (85%) and that the OSN was an important
factor for facilitating interaction (86%). Similarly, pretest
results indicated that high levels of interaction would be
important (88%) and that exchanging feedback with their
peers would be important (95%). Again, posttest results
supported
these
perceptions,
revealing
high
levels
of
agreement
across
these
constructs
(94%
and
91%
respectively). The fact that the OSN is an open environment
allowed team members to review the progress of their
classmates and pose questions and receive responses in an
open dialogue was likely a large contributor to these results.
In environments where identity and affiliation play a role in
shared outcomes, tools that support sharing and encourage
interaction can enhance overall levels of trust and contribute
positively to these shared goals [52].
A secondary factor for analyzing community support
brings attention back to Figure 4 and Figure 5, which
represent the peer-to-peer interactions within the OSN. The
sociograms clearly identify Group 1 as a more tight-knit
group that Group 2. While Group 1 consisted of 20% more
students, an important indicator for social capital can be
determined by network density. Group 1 maintained a
density factor of .43, which means that around 43% of all
individuals communicated with one another on a regular
basis. Group 2, on the other hand, had a density of .35, or
roughly 21% lower than Group 1. Within a smaller group,
one might expect a greater level of activity among all nodes,
but this was not the case. To make sense of this, it is
important to reflect back on the notion that social capital
considers individual’s perception that the community is an
active and vibrant space. Fewer interactions result in lower
levels of perception across constructs related to these factors.
Consequently, in the end, a lack of connectivity among
participants resulted in a lower quality product as discussed
in the previous section.
D.
OSN as Support in Technical Learning
One final consideration should be discussed and centers
on the introduction of OSN software within an academic
setting and specifically for the purposes of learning and
collaboration. While the merits of an OSN as a mechanism
for project success and/or enhancing levels of academic
community are debatable, the introduction of specialized
social software, such as those integrated within an OSN, into
team capstone courses provides a number of tangible and
intangible benefits not measured completely in this research.
Social software is pervasive across today’s dynamic
business
environments.
Therefore
students
should
be
exposed to their applications outside of peer-networks such
as Facebook and Snapchat and prior to their entering the
workforce. Capstone courses are often a final course prior to
graduating making them an optimal platform for their
introduction. As a matter of consequence, establishing an
online community of practice where students can engage in
information sharing and knowledge construction through
online social networking technologies introduced in this
study, students may be better prepared for similar types of
communication and interaction when they enter the IT
workforce. Additionally, although we focus on academic

communities in this study, research has found numerous
similarities
between
computer
supported
learning
and
working teams that make knowledge gained in one setting
applicable to another setting, making this research applicable
to other domains [54].
VIII.
LIMITATIONS AND NEXT STEPS
It is important to acknowledge the limitations in this
research. One limitation considers grouping pretest and
posttest results from Group 1 and Group 2. Rather than
present the results per class, it was decided that a high-level
view of student perceptions would provide better insight to
the capabilities of an OSN as a tool to foster project
management. A more in-depth analysis of Group 1 and
Group 2, which focuses specifically on the differences
between
each
course,
may
also
prove
interesting.
Additionally, a primary goal of this research has been to
showcase OSN software as a proof-of-concept for enhancing
collaboration among project-based teams, which we believe
was successful across a number of dimensions. As such, we
currently do not compare our results against capstone
students utilizing more formal PM software, nor do we
compare LMS software as a viable option for PM software.
Both limitations present opportunities for future research in
this space.
IX.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigate the adoption of OSN
software as a system for managing IT capstone projects.
OSN software provides unique affordances across ad-hoc,
short-term project teams and provides individuals with a
user-centric environment capable of managing the project
lifecycle, while also facilitating high-level discourse with the
larger course community. Through the analysis of survey
data and supported through a social network analysis, our
findings show the powerful and positive impact OSN
software has on supporting project success by facilitating
peer-to-peer
interaction
and
enhancing
levels
of
collaboration.
