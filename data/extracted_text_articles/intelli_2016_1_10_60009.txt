Abstract—This paper is focused at position deviation 
regulation upon a slider by Fuzzy Sliding Mode Control 
(FSMC).  Five Degrees Of Freedom (DOFs) of position 
deviation are required to be regulated except for the direction 
(i.e., X-axis) in which the slider moves forward and backward.  
At first, the system dynamic model of slider, including load 
uncertainty and load position uncertainty, is established.  
Intensive computer simulations are undertaken to verify the 
validity of proposed control strategy.  Finally, a prototype of 
realistic slider position deviation regulation system is 
successfully built up.  According to the experiments by 
cooperation of pneumatic and magnetic control, the actual 
linear position deviations of slider can be regulated within (-40, 
+40)μm and angular position deviations within (-2, +2)mini-
degrees.  From the viewpoint of energy consumption, the 
applied currents to 8 sets of MAs are all below 1A.  To sum up, 
the closed-loop levitation system by cooperation of pneumatic 
and magnetic control is capable to account for load uncertainty 
and uncertainty of the standing position of load to be carried. 
Keywords- Position Deviation Regulation; Fuzzy Sliding 
Mode Control (FSMC); Magnetic Levitation (MagLev).

 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, a few types of active non-contact slider 
systems were proposed.  An air-driven slider was presented 
by Denkena et al. [1].  Based on their study, the compressed 
air not only can levitate the slider but also can drive the 
slider back and forth.  Unlike pneumatic actuators, a 5-DOF 
(5 Degrees of Freedom) active magnetic levitation slider was 
reported by Kim et al. [2].  However, the applied currents to 
the magnetic actuators are up to 10A to counterbalance the 
weight of the slider. 
In comparison to the air-driven actuator, in general the 
required force by magnetic actuator is relatively much larger.  
Hence, the bending phenomenon on thinner portion of slider 
would become easier to occur if the applied magnetic force 
exceeds over a certain level.  Not only the heat dissipation 
problem has to be considered but also the electronic circuit 
of power amplifier is more complicated than the other low-
power actuators.  Among the available research reports 
regarding active levitation sliders, the most acceptable 
design by industries was proposed by Ro et al. [3].  In their 
work, four magnetic actuators are allocated at the corners of 
the slider to account for external disturbance.  The weight of 
the slider and load is supported by the force component by 
air actuator.  Additionally, a linear motor, to drive the slider 
back and forth, is equipped at the middle of the guide rail.  
Nevertheless, there exists a common disadvantage: both 
uncertainties of load to be carried and the standing position 
of load during the loading/unloading process onto the slider 
are not counted into consideration of the corresponding 
control stratagy at all.  
For high-precision machines and production, it often 
needs a slider system, which can account for load uncertainty 
and suppress undesired vibration effectively.  However, no 
matter contact-type slider or aerostatic slider is employed, 
the slider systems are lack of the capability against load 
uncertainty and multi-degree-of-freedom vibration during the 
transportation of carried load.  Therefore, an active robust 
slider levitation system is proposed by this paper to deal with 
the induced position deviation of the slider due to load 
uncertainty and load position uncertainty. 
The rest of this article is organized as follows.  In Section 
2, the dynamic model of slider levitation system is developed.  
In Section 3, the fuzzy sliding mode control law is proposed.  
In Section 4, the experiments to examine the capability of the 
maglev slider to account for load uncertainty and uncertainty 
of the standing position are undertaken.  Finally, conclusions 
are presented in Section 5. 
II. 
DYNAMIC MODEL OF SLIDER LEVITATION SYSTEM 
The mechanical structure of the proposed slider 
levitation system by cooperation of pneumatic and magnetic 
control is schematically shown in Fig. 1.  In Fig. 1, “S” is 
the mass center of the slider.  “S” is also the origin of the 
coordinate system.  φ , θ  and ψ  are angular position 
deviations along X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis respectively.  y 
and z are the linear position deviations along Y-axis and Z-
axis respectively.  Eight sets of Magnetic Actuators (MAs) 
and an Electro-Pneumatic Transducer (EPT) are employed 
together to regulate both angular and linear position 
deviations of the slider.  The four sets of magnetic actuators, 
Vertical Magnetic Actuators (VMAs), along with the EPT, 
are employed to together regulate the angular position 
deviations along X- and Y-axes and the linear position 
deviation along Z-axis.  Another four sets of magnetic 
actuators, i.e., Horizontal Magnetic Actuators (HMAs), are 
employed to regulate the angular position deviation along Z-
axis and position deviation along Y-axis.  Three Vertical 
Gap Sensors (VGSs) are equipped to measure the linear 
position deviation along Z-axis.  Besides, the angular

position deviations along X-axis and Y-axis can be 
estimated by the linear position deviations measured by 
these 3 VGSs at the same time.  On the other hand, two 
Horizontal Gap Sensors (HGSs) are equipped to measure 
the linear position deviation along Y-axis.  It is noted that 
the angular position deviation along Z-axis can be evaluated 
by the linear position deviations measured by the aforesaid 
HGSs.

FUZZY SLIDING MODE CONTROL 
For a slider, in general the mass of carried load and the 
standing location of the load are not fixed all the time.  This 
implies that a certain degree of uncertainties is embedded in 
the dynamic model of the slider system.  Therefore, the 
basic concept of Sliding Mode Control (SMC) [4]-[6] is 
adopted by our work.  Moreover, fuzzy logic [7]-[11] is 
additionally applied to adjust slope of the corresponding 
sliding surface, based on the real-time trajectory tracking 
error and error rate, such that superior system response can 
be achieved.  That is, FSMC (Fuzzy Sliding Mode Control) 
is proposed to replace the standard SMC by this research. 
A. Design of Controller 
Before FSMC is synthesized, the dynamic equations of 
the slider system, i.e., (1), are deduced into another form to 
aim at uncertainties of load and load position:

By adding FLA (Fuzzy Logic Algorithm) to adjust the slope 
of the sliding surface is the main concept to adopt FSMC, 
instead of standard SMC alone.  The schematic 
configuration of the closed-loop slider system is shown in 
Fig. 2.  The transformation matrix α  is utilized to convert 
the measurements from the 5 sets of gap sensors into the

B. Computer Simulations 
At the stage of computer simulations, two cases are to 
be studied:  
Caes I: Load (1kg) added onto slider 
Case II: Load (1kg) subtracted out of slider

Since the load is not put onto the position of mass center of

The corresponding computer simulations are shown in Fig.

deviation along +Z-axis occurs at

often the load is not exactly thrown at the position of mass 
center of the slider, the angular position deviations along X-
axis and Y-axis are hence induced as the load is added onto 
the slider.  In similar fashion, the applied currents to 
VMA#1~VMA#4 are all increased to account for the 
angular position deviations along X-axis and Y-axis.

at VMA#1~VMA#4 are all reduced but still have to 
cooperate with EPT.  On the other hand, since the load 
subtracted is hardly located exactly at the position of mass 
center of the slider, the corresponding currents applied at 
VMA#1~VMA#4, to suppress the angular position 
deviations along X-axis and Y-axis, are usually necessary.

the added load does not coincide with the mass center of the 
slider so that outstanding angular position deviations due to 
this applied moment by load weight are hence induced.  The 
experimental results for position deviation regulation on 
slider in 5 DOF are shown in Fig. 6.  The maximum linear 
position deviations along Z-axis and Y-axis induced by the 
additional load are 80μm and 130μm respectively.  The 
linear position deviations along Z-axis and Y-axis can be 
suppressed to ± 20μm and ± 40μm respectively within 
0.1sec.  In addition, the maximum angular position 
deviations 
along

interval (about 0.1sec).  On the other hand, the applied 
currents to the magnetic actuators, shown in Fig. 7, are 
jointly adjusted accordingly so that the induced tilt about X-
axis and the induced pitch about Y-axis can be suppressed.  
Since most of the weight of the slider and load is supported 
by the supportive force by the high pressurized air, the 
applied currents to VMAs are not increased much to 
counterbalance the weight of the additional load newly put 
on.  It is observed that the average applied currents to 
VMAs are all below 0.2A.  The applied currents to VMAs 
in the undertaken experiments are much lower than that in 
computer simulations stated in previous section.  The reason 
might be stemmed from the actual viscosity and friction in 
vertical direction being more serious in real world but 
neglected in computer simulations under over-simplified 
assumptions 
for 
interconnection 
between 
any 
two 
components in motion.

The experimental results for position deviations regulation 
on slider in 5 DOF are shown in Fig. 8.  The position 
deviations along 5-axes can be completely suppressed 
within a very short time interval (about 0.15sec).  In similar 
fashion, the applied currents to the magnetic actuators, 
shown in Fig. 9, are jointly adjusted as well to regulate the 
induced tilt and pitch motions.  Since partial load is taken 
off the slider, the average applied currents to VMAs become 
only half of those in Part I.  Besides, the maximum applied 
currents to HMAs are all below 0.5A.  Nevertheless, the 
currents applied to VMAs and HMAs are still required and 
absolutely necessary in order to counterbalance the external 
disturbance, particularly for the transient time period as the 
partial load suddenly removed, no matter how significantly 
the quantities of consumed electricity at magnetic actuators 
are reduced.

CONCLUSION 
An active robust MagLev slider system is proposed to 
deal with the induced position deviations of the slider due to 
load uncertainties and load position uncertainties.  By 
cooperation of pneumatic and magnetic actuators, efficient 
regulations of the position deviations of slider in 5 DOF can 
be achieved.  According to the experiments undertaken, the 
actual linear position deviations of slider can be regulated 
within ± 40μm and angular position deviations within 
± 2mini-degrees.  Besides, the applied currents to the 8 sets 
of MAs are all below 1A.  The closed-loop slider levitation 
system is fairly capable to account for load uncertainties and 
load position uncertainties.  To sum up, by the cooperation 
of pneumatic and magnetic actuators, the proposed closed-
loop slider system exhibits the merits of stabilization to the 
inherently unstable system, capability for simultaneous 
position regulation in 5 DOF and outstanding reduction of 
energy consumption.
