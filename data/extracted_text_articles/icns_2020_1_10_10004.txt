Abstract—Today’s indoor navigational systems are more and 
more in demand, commonly used for applications such as 
smart cities, robots and visually impaired people. As far as 
outdoor navigation is concerned, the Global Positioning 
System (GPS) technology is still one of the most (if not the 
most) commonly used approaches. Even though it is still 
considered an ideal solution for navigating in outdoor areas, 
challenges and problems arise when GPS is considered for 
navigation inside buildings due to obstacles (e.g., shopping 
malls, hospitals, etc.) and because signals cannot be absorbed 
by the building walls. To tackle the aforementioned issue, other 
technologies have emerged aimed at indoor navigation, such as 
Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth and sensors. This paper’s 
contribution is towards indoor navigation and, more 
specifically, it targets designing and developing a tracking and 
navigation system aimed at people that experience difficulties 
in indoor orientation using a wearable device. The user takes 
direction from the wearable device for the indoor orientation 
through voice commands helping him to avoid obstacles. The 
central part of the system is a device that provides the ability to 
navigate and find a route by voice commands, based on the 
device's location and orientation capabilities.

 INTRODUCTION 
Undoubtedly, there is an increasing demand for efficient 
indoor navigation systems, demand that mainly derives from 
smart cities, robots and visually impaired people, only to 
name a few. As far as outdoor navigation and pathfinding are 
concerned, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is still 
considered among the most commonly used technologies. 
Yet, this is only efficiently applicable in outdoor locations, 
because when indoor navigation comes into play, issues do 
rise. Of course, indoor navigation is very important to us and 
has many applications for humans and robots. Two of the 
most common issues that arise are a) the fact that physical 
obstacles inside building cannot be labeled as obstacles from 
the GPS and b) the fact that signals cannot be absorbed by 
walls inside buildings. Multiple floors, rooms and obstacles 
inside each and every indoor area pose a major problem. 
Additionally, the inability to use the GPS technology inside 
buildings makes indoor navigation more complicated, for 
reasons already explained above [1]. 
On the good side, many recent studies have been and are 
still conducted in order to make indoor navigation more 
effective and efficient. The direct need for new applications 
and technologies that can efficiently tackle such issues can 
luckily be covered by other available indoor navigation 
technologies that do exist nowadays, such as Wireless-
Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth and sensors. 
This paper provides the design and development of a 
tracking and navigation system for people with special needs 
for indoor locations. In its core, the system consists of a 
device that provides the ability to navigate and route by 
voice commands, based on the device's location and 
orientation capabilities. This device shall be connected to the 
server via the user's mobile phone (android). The overall 
system (when completed) will consist of the following 
components: 
• 
Equipment permanently installed in selected areas. 
• 
A cloud server that will synchronize and coordinate 
the various parts, store information about the 
facilities and users, and will be responsible for the 
accounting and invoicing parts. 
• 
Portable devices. 
• 
Software that will run on smartphones.

subject. Section IV addresses the system’s architecture 
whereas Section V goes into finer details in regard to the 
proposed algorithms for positioning and navigating in indoor 
spaces. Finally, Section VI summarizes our main findings

II. 
MOTIVATION 
Blindness is the condition of lacking visual perception 
due to physiological or neurological factors. Blind people 
face many problems in everyday life. They always depend 
on others. They cannot move easily from one place to 
another without help from others.  
According to the World Health Organization, the 
following are the key facts regarding blindness and vision 
impairment [2]: 
• 
Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision 
impairment or blindness, of whom at least 1 billion 
have a vision impairment that could have been 
prevented or has yet to be addressed. 
• 
This 1 billion people include those with moderate or 
severe distance vision impairment or blindness due 
to unaddressed refractive error, as well as near 
vision 
impairment 
caused 
by 
unaddressed 
presbyopia. 
• 
Globally, the leading causes of vision impairment 
are uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts. 
• 
The majority of people with vision impairment are 
over the age of 50 years. 
The motivation of the GuideMe project [3] is to provide 
guidance and security for out-of-home travel. The central 
part of the system is a portable device that provides the 
ability to route and navigate by voice commands. The 
instructions will be based on the device's location and 
orientation capabilities. The device will be connected to the 
server via the user's mobile phone. The solution is built 
around a discreet portable device capable of indoor 
localization with an accuracy of 10 cm using Ultra-wideband 
(UWB) technology. The device can also determine the 
orientation, receive voice commands, and transmit voice 
instructions.  
The motivation of the paper is to improve two areas of 
social life of the blind people and people with special needs 
in general: convenience and security. Specifically, with the 
use of the proposed system, users will feel more comfortable 
visiting public places, such as airports, shopping malls, 
stations, etc. as they will be guided by the system to reach 
their destination. At the same time, in case of emergencies 
involving both the user (accidents) and the building (fire, 
earthquake, etc.), the system will inform the users of the 
exact location of the users, whilst also guiding them to the 
nearest exit. The ultimate goal is to increase the presence of 
the population with mobility or other problems in buildings 
by 20%.

RELATED WORK 
There are several studies concerning indoor positioning 
techniques and systems. Previous works focus on the need to 
study the general way of positioning and then they propose 
algorithms and methods for indoor positioning. Daramouskas 
et al. [4] study methods for location estimation on Low 
Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). They also present 
Multilateration, 
Trilateration 
and 
Particle 
Swarm 
Optimization (PSO) algorithm, according to previous 
research, which constitute the three most commonly used 
methods to calculate the location of a moving object, based 
on distance measurements. Choliz et al. [5], gather all 
existing algorithms for UWB positioning and tracking 
systems and evaluate the performance in a realistic interior 
scenario. Next, Krishnaveni et al. [6] present an overview of 
indoor positioning based on UWB technology.  
In the literature on positioning, machine learning 
algorithms are widely used to estimate position. Some of the 
machine learning algorithms used in indoor positioning are 
presented in [7]. Liu et al. [8], present a summary table with 
a comparison of recent systems and provide solutions about 
current wireless indoor positioning systems. Α survey of the 
latest indoor positioning technologies is provided by Alarifi 
et al. [9], who analyze UWB technologies with an analysis of 
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT). 
Unlike previous studies, Al-Ammar et al. [10] present new 
taxonomies and review some major recent advances on 
indoor positioning techniques. Finally, in [11], Mahida et al. 
deal with various positioning enabled wireless technologies 
and algorithms used in realistic scenarios to provide indoor 
navigation. 
As far as indoor navigation is concerned, there exists a 
variety of significant work for people with special needs. 
More specifically, giving emphasis in works of the last years, 
we have found several similar approaches. Kishore et al. [12] 
provided a comprehensive solution for indoor public 
transport for people with disabilities. Beacons (small low-
power devices, which are increasingly gaining recognition 
and application in malls and airports) were placed indoors 
and transmitted signals to the cell phone sensors via 
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. Cheraghi et al. 
[13], BLE beacons-based indoor navigation was developed 
under the name GuideBeacon, where simulations showed 
that the GuideBeacon application reduces the time it takes 
for a disabled person to cross an unknown indoor area by 
30%-50% and reduced the required distance they have to 
walk by at least 50%. Link et al. [14] suggested a system 
called FootPath, which obtains a geographic map from 
OpenStreetMap. After downloading the geographic map, the 
system uses the accelerometer and compass on the user's 
phone to calculate and detect the user's steps. The results 
showed that the FootPath system is very accurate to assist 
users with disabilities and indoors.  
Megalingam et al. [15], proposed a system to find the 
best route for wheelchair users based on minimal changes in 
direction. The algorithm suggested is called Location-Aware 
and Remembering Navigation (LARN) and it depends on 
Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal path. The study 
2

ICNS 2020 : The Sixteenth International Conference on Networking and Services

carried out in [16] introduced a new method for dynamically 
changing the navigation path indoors. The proposed 
algorithm was named FPP and combined its internal path 
information and interior information. The FPP algorithm was 
compared with those of Dijkstra and Elastic and the results 
showed that FPP can provide the shortest route for in-house 
navigation faster than the other two algorithms. Goel, et al. 
[17], studied indoor navigation in order to reduce the time 
required for a user to get to its destination, using algorithm 
A*. The first section of the paper was devoted to a detailed 
presentation of A* algorithm, while in the second one, the 
authors successfully demonstrated why the A* algorithm is 
better than Dijkstra algorithm for indoor navigation with 
barriers. Comparing A* and Dijkstra for indoor navigation, 
A* achieves better results through heuristic searches and 
delivers better results faster. 
Following the previous studies, in this section we will 
present similar projects to GuideMe. Indoo.rs and San 
Francisco International Airport worked together to create an 
app for visually impaired passengers. The Entrepreneurship-
in-Residence (EIR) project is an Edwin M. Lee collaboration 
with the White House and other San Francisco business 
partners. At the beginning of 2014, they chose to help the 
San Francisco Airport (SFO) create a tool to assist blind and 
visually impaired travelers [18]. Recommendation ITU-T 
F.921 [19] sets out how audio-based network navigation 
systems can be designed to ensure that they are dedicated 
and responsive to the needs of people with visual 
impairments. The aim is to provide network visual system 
designers with the audio data they need in the early stages of 
development to anticipate and overcome any constraints and 
obstacles that prevent vision impaired users from making full 
use of the built environment. The purpose of [20] was to 
implement a module-based application developed in the 
context of preliminary projects for the mobile mass market. 
Through an appropriate user interface that responds to the 
needs of the visually impaired, the blind user should be able 
to use public transport independently in a secure manner and 
navigate complex public transport terminals. The system 
combines real-time communication to and from public 
transport vehicles with precise positioning and guidance 
while it also provides additional navigation assistance.  
INK 2016: Indoor Navigation and Communication in 
ÖPNV for blind and visually impaired people [21] combines 
real-time communication to and from public transport 
vehicles with precise positioning and guidance and has 
additional video call navigation assistance where the person 
can communicate with a professional operator. Arikovani 
UK’s WeWalk, Imperial College London, Astra Terra and 
the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) will 
cooperate to mitigate indoor wayfinding challenges by 
developing an indoor navigation system that is both reliable 
and fully accessible for visually impaired people and anyone 
that may struggle to navigate the built environment [22]. 
Project Ways4all [23] is a new personalized indoor 
navigation system that can increase public transport 
accessibility for all passengers and especially the visually 
impaired, who will be able to access public transport and the 
necessary up-to-date traffic information in a very simplified 
way. Finally, Project “Using An Integrated Techniques for 
Developing Indoor Navigation Systems to Allow the Blind 
and Visually Impaired People to Reach Precise Objects” [24] 
uses a set of different technologies (WIFI, Bluetooth, and 
RFID) to help the user reach a micro element in the 
navigated environment. It constitutes an intelligent interface 
for precise indoor navigation for blind and visually impaired 
people using a smart phone. 
IV. 
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
In this project, the main component is a small wearable 
that helps in the user’s positioning through UWB 
technology. This technology provides very accurate 
positioning, up to 10 cm divergence. This device, apart from 
the ability to locate the user, can also determine the 
orientation of the user, receive voice commands, and 
transmit voice instructions to guide the visually impaired 
people. 
Specifically, as it is shown in Figure 1, in our proposed 
system, our smart device can communicate to anchors via 
UWB technology, in order to locate the user. This device has 
the ability to provide route and navigation information to the 
user via voice commands. The anchors are calculating and 
measuring the distance between the user and the anchor. The 
distance data (between the user and the anchors), is 
transferred to a local server in order to measure the exact 
position and run positioning algorithms, that in our case will 
be trilateration. The positioning algorithms are described in 
the Section V. Furthermore, there is a remote server that has 
a map of the building. This remote server, having the details 
of the building and the position of the user and the 
destination of the user, can provide guidance to the user by 
giving directions. The directions are given by the smartphone 
to the user through wireless headphones, using voice 
commands.

As far as the wearable device is concerned, the processor 
that is chosen is the module made by Econais, the EC32L13 
[25]. The EC32L13 is a 32-bit processor of the product 
family STM32 processors. This processors in this family of 
processors are energy efficient, in order to expand the battery 
life. A WiFi module is also integrated into the wearable

device. For the connectivity through UWB, we have chosen 
the module DWM1000 of Decawave. 
In Figure 2, we present the general architecture of the 
wearable device. The device consists of some sensors such 
as, the magnetometer and accelerometer sensors, the UWB 
module, the WiFi module, the Main Computing Unit, which 
in our case is the EC32L13 and module for the battery 
management as well, in order to expand the battery life as 
long as possible.

PROPOSED ALGORITHMS 
In this section, we will present our indoor positioning 
algorithms and the indoor navigation algorithm we used and 
integrated in our system.  
A. Indoor Positioning 
As far as indoor positioning is concerned, as part of the 
GuideMe project, it was decided to implement the 
trilateration algorithm that combines simple implementation 
and sufficiently precise positioning beyond the project 
requirements.  
 
Figure 3.  Represenation of trilateration. 
The trilateration algorithm is a fairly common and easy to 
understand algorithm and is used extensively in various 
applications. Also, the DW 1000 module used in the project 
supports Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA), a method that 
gives a very good distance estimation. The high data rate and 
speed of the UWB can reach 100 Megabits per second 
(Mbps), which makes it a good solution for indoor 
positioning. Thus, the trilateration algorithm can give a very 
good estimate of the user's position. The logic that is 
followed is: for each anchor the user communicates with, a 
circle is created with its center being the position of the user 
and the radius the distance between the user and the anchor. 
This should be done for at least 3 anchors. The point where 
the circles intersect is the location of the user. Before we 
begin the description of the implementation and the code, we 
give an image describing the three cases considered in the 
trilateration method, in Figure 3. In Algorithm 1, our 
approach of the localization of the user is described. 
 
Algorithm 1: Trilateration Algorithm for indoor positioning 
1: 
Class circle(point,radius){ 
2:      this.point=point; 
3:   } 
4:    function Locate(x1, y1,distance1, x2, y2,distance2, x3, 
y3,distance3){ 
5:      create circle objects; 
6:      circle_list={c1,c2,c3} 
7: 
    get_all_intersecting_points(circle_list); 
8: 
    center=Get_center_of_polygon(intersected_points_list); 
9: 
    } 
10: 
    function get_all_intersecting_points(circle_list){ 
11: 
    //intersecting points of every circle with the other circles 
12: 
  find_interecting_points_by_two_circle(circle(i),  
circle(k)); 
13: 
    } 
14: 
   function get_polygon_center(points){ 
15: 
          center = point(0, 0); 
16: 
          num = len(points)       
17: 
        for i in range(num){ 
18: 
            center.x += points[i].x 
19: 
            center.y += points[i].y 
         } 
20: 
        return center 
21: 
       } 
 
B. Indoor Navigation 
For the needs of the project, it was decided to use 
Algorithm A* for indoor navigation (based on [16], 
Algorithm A* is an optimal algorithm for indoor routing). 
Algorithm A* is a pathfinding algorithm that is widely used 
because of its completeness and optimum efficiency. In 
systems where navigation through barrier is required, A* is 
still the best solution for the majority of cases. This 
algorithm is based on structured graphs. It defines an initial 
node of the graph as a start node and attempts to find the 
path to the final node at minimum cost. The minimum cost 
does not necessarily have to do with the minimum number of 
moves, as it could e.g., UWB indicates the shortest path 
length. 
To implement the algorithm, a path tree is constructed 
that starts from the start node and extends the tree paths, one 
edge at a time, until the algorithm termination criterion is 
met. At each iteration, the set of paths to be expanded must 
4

ICNS 2020 : The Sixteenth International Conference on Networking and Services

be specified, and to do so, the travel cost is used in 
conjunction with an estimate of the costs required to extend 
to the final node. Therefore, the algorithm will select that 
path that minimizes: 
 
f(n) = g(n) + h(n) 
() 
where n is the next extension node in the graph, g(n) is the 
path cost from the original node to n and g(n) the cost of the 
minimum cost from the extension node n to the terminal 
node. The algorithm terminates when an acceptable 
extension is found from the start node to the terminal node, 
otherwise extensions to the node are not available. As for the 
efficiency of A*, as long as this algorithm never 
overestimates the actual cost to reach the terminal, then the 
returned path will always be of minimal cost. 
At the programming level of the algorithm, the Javascript 
library Easystar.js will be used [26]. Based on this library, 
we will first need to set a grid where the accepted values will 
be 0 or 1, depending on which cells are accessible and which 
are not (the matching can be done as we wish). Having 
defined which cells are accessible, by defining the (x,y) start 
and stop coordinate pairs, the path of algorithm A* can be 
calculated, if it exists. 
The pseudocode of algorithm A* is presented below (we 
accept the Wikipedia approach for the algorithm [27]): 
 
Algorithm 2: A* Algorithm for Indoor Navigation 
1: 
begin 
2:  function reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current) 
3:      total_path := {current} 
4:      while current in cameFrom.keys:  
5:          current := cameFrom[current] 
6:          total_path.prepend(current) 
7: 
    return total_path 
8: 
 function A_Star(start, goal, h) 
9: 
    openSet := {start} 
10: 
    cameFrom := an empty map 
11: 
    gScore := map with default value of Infinity 
12: 
    gScore[start] := 0 
13: 
    fScore := map with default value of Infinity 
14: 
    fScore[start] := h(start) 
15: 
    while openSet is not empty 
16: 
        current := the node in openSet having the lowest              
fScore[] value 
17: 
        if current = goal 
18: 
            return reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current) 
19: 
        openSet.Remove(current) 
20: 
        for each neighbor of current 
21: 
            tentative_gScore := gScore[current] + d(current, 
neighbor) 
22: 
            if tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor] 
23: 
                cameFrom[neighbor] := current 
24: 
                gScore[neighbor] := tentative_gScore 
25: 
                fScore[neighbor] 
:= 
gScore[neighbor] 
+ 
h(neighbor) 
26: 
                if neighbor not in openSet

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This work refers to the project of GuideMe. The state of 
the art of existing approaches and the algorithms that were 
implemented to complete the project in terms of navigation 
and indoor routing were presented. By providing a wearable 
device, the project is contributing to indoor navigation and 
positioning assistance for people with difficulties. The user 
takes direction from the wearable device for the indoor 
orientation through voice commands that help with avoiding 
obstacles. This work is the basis of the next step of the 
project that relates to transmitting the correct instructions to 
the user using the information of the algorithms of the 
position of the mobile device as well as the path to follow 
through voice commands. Future work may include an 
extension of this current work by also covering outdoor areas 
through the application.
