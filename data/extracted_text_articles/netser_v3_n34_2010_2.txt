Abstract—Admission control is a key issue for quality of 
service (QoS) provisioning in both wired and wireless 
communication networks. Providing QoS for voice traffic 
transmission over packet-based network is a crucial task, 
which requires development of accurate resource estimation 
models. In order to perform bandwidth saving and improve 
the naturalness of the voice service contemporary voice coding 
schemes are equipped with the functionality of voice activity 
detection and background noise transmission during inactive 
speech periods. The adoption of traditional ON-OFF traffic 
model may cause significant errors in estimating the 
bandwidth required to meet the performance bounds of 
aggregated traffic flow. The aim of this article is to present a 
“new paradigm” of call admission control (CAC) dimensioning 
applicable to wireless access transmission media. The 
admission decision policy is codec-dependent and relies on the 
concept of user-perceived voice quality, since it could provide a 
tight connection with the QoS metrics that shall be guaranteed 
by the network. The well-known bufferless fluid-flow method 
is applied and new simple exact formulas for CAC 
performance evaluation are derived. The proposed methods 
are illustrated with numerical examples and some comparisons 
are made.

 INTRODUCTION 
As next generation networks architecture is moving 
towards packet, also known as “all-IP” architecture, 
emerging wireless access technologies rely on fully shared 
radio resource allocation schemes, which allow scarce 
resource usage in an efficient way. Interactive services as 
well as real-time constraining services, such as voice or 
streaming applications, are supported over shared radio 
resource. Thus, it becomes critical that the emerging wireless 
access systems should be capable of employing efficient 
radio resource management schemes for packet data, in order 
to ensure that real-time services can be supported according 
to their stringent QoS requirements. 
Providing QoS for real-time traffic flows in modern 
telecommunication networks is still a challenging task, 
which can be split up as follows: QoS guarantee in access 
network and QoS provisioning in the backbone. The former 
needs more difficult and more costly solutions, compared to 
the latter. It is due to the cheap available resource (e.g., fiber 
optic) and easy way of providing additional bandwidth in the 
core network, in comparison with the scarce and expensive 
resources in the wireless access networks (WAcN) as well as 
the specific features of the wireless medium. As a 
consequence, the QoS requirements may not be satisfied, 
even though a large amount of resources (i.e. bandwidth) is 
allocated to a certain connection.  
The possibilities of contemporay WAcN, such as Wi-Fi 
(a set of standards IEEE 802.11), WiMAX (a set of standards 
IEEE 802.16), and LTE (3GPP standard of Long Term 
Evolution), to serve voice traffic are subject of particular 
attention. In spite of the increasing popularity of pure data 
services, the voice service demands still remain the biggest 
revenue contributor of telecommunication network operators 
[2]. VoIP traffic flows over WAcN encounter different 
problems and particularities like: a) stringent norms of 
admissible delay; b) the traffic flow is formed by relative 
short packets with high arrival rate; c) the scarce radio 
resource is wasted due to the relative long packet header, 
which can considerably exceed the packet payload, carrying 
voice frames; d) time-varying channel conditions. 
Transmission of voice over packet-based networks is 
possible by applying different coding techniques. In order to 
prevent wasting available resources in WAcN voice codecs 
employing silence suppression techniques are preferred to be 
used. This is a reasonable solution in contrast to the 
implementation of constant bit rate (CBR) codecs, which are 
well accepted in systems where the network resources are 
not problematic. An additional option of the modern voice 
codecs is their ability of improving speech quality of parties 
participating in communication. This is done by generating a 
special frame, called Silence Insert Descriptor (SID), which 
describes the talker’s background noise. As a result, the 
traffic profile of aggregated voice traffic should be 
addressed, by developing accurate models in which the 
generation of SID frames is included. 
Since VoIP services continue to be commercially 
attractive for network operators, their adoption could be 
influenced by the users’ satisfaction. The major challenge of 
the packet-based networks (either wireless access or core 
domain) serving streaming traffic is to provide QoS 
guarantee, such that consumer satisfaction is the same or 
similar to that of conventional fixed or cellular telephone 
services. This should imply methodologies and models for 
perceived voice quality prediction to be incorporated in

algorithms for network resource management, with respect 
to QoS provisioning. 
On the other hand, an important aspect of radio resource 
management and QoS provisioning in wireless access 
networks is towards the CAC mechanism implementation. 
The necessity of CAC arises with the wide deployment of 
connection-oriented packet switching technologies. Based on 
a source’s traffic characteristics and required performance 
metrics, it encompass a set of tools, which has to take a 
decision whether or not a new connection can be accepted by 
the system, in addition of those connections in progress. If a 
new connection is admitted, it must not deteriorate the 
bandwidth usage and the performance of the connections 
already established. Since CAC is a fundamental mechanism 
for congestion control and QoS provisioning, it has been 
extensively studied in both wired [3] and wireless [4] 
network domains. 
The CAC design and performance analysis became an 
inseparable part of ATM- and IP-based networks planning 
process [5], including different wireless networks as well. It 
can be classified based on various objectives and design 
options, such as QoS parameters (call-level and packet-level 
congestion probabilities, packet delay, bandwidth guarantee); 
throughput 
optimization, 
power 
allocation, 
fairness; 
controlling handover dropping probability, etc. Our research 
work is focused on both call blocking and packet dropping 
probabilities. Call admission decision is based on a simple 
threshold rule – an offered call is accepted if all the calls in 
progress are less than a pre-calculated threshold value. 
Taking into consideration the decision time, CAC 
schemes can be classified as proactive (parameter-based) and 
reactive (measurement-based). In the former scheme the 
decision rule is based on a predictive analytical evaluation of 
the QoS constrains, while in the latter scheme, the CAC 
decision is based on certain QoS measurement. In order to 
get more efficient congestion control, a combination of both 
approaches can be realized. 
This article is an extended version of the research work 
carried out in [1]. We investigate admission control schemes 
for streaming traffic and propose a new paradigm of a 
proactive CAC mechanism and VoIP dimensioning 
framework, based on perceived voice quality evaluation 
models. We aim at developing a solution that is applicable 
for a broad class of contemporary VoIP coding schemes.

RELATED WORK 
The packet form of voice transmission differs 
considerably from other data transmissions. The VoIP traffic 
is streaming with stringent delay requirements. The activity 
periods (talk-spurts) are relatively long and the transmission 
rate of active voice frames (ACT) is not very high. The 
packets are relatively short with constant length and more 
often the packet header size is larger than the payload size. 
Due to the great interest in using IEEE 802.11 and 802.16 
standards as well as emerging 3GPP LTE with E-UTRAN as 
access networks for packetized voice transmission, there 
exist numerous publications on modeling the VoIP call 
performance. References [6]-[8] (Wi-Fi), [9][10] (WiMAX) 
and [11]-[13] (LTE) are just a few among the latest ones. 
In voice communications, speech is usually represented 
as a sequence of talk-spurts, interleaved with silence periods. 
This is a consequence of the widespread employment of 
voice codecs schemes with silence suppression or Voice 
Activity Detection (VAD) feature. In teletraffic point of 
view, this led to modeling the VoIP traffic pattern as an ON-
OFF source. The analytical modeling of the ON-OFF voice 
traffic started with voice over ATM and continues with voice 
over IP applications [5]. Among analytical methods for 
performance evaluation, Markov-Modulated Poisson Process 
(MMPP) [14] and Fluid-flow model [15] are well-
distinguished. Both models are described and compared in 
more details in [41][42]. The MMPP approach is more 
accurate, but at the cost of more computational efforts, when 
compared with the fluid-flow model, which is usually 
preferred as a less complex solution [16]. 
Although quite low bandwidth requirements, the 
packetized voice features lead to poor traffic performance in 
the high-speed WAcN [7][8][17]. In [6], the theoretical 
capacity for VoIP traffic of IEEE 802.11b WAcN is 
computed to be 15 calls. A comparative study shows the 
benefit of implementing silence suppression technique, 
which enhances the theoretical capacity to 38 calls. This is 
still a poor performance compared with the IEEE 802.11b 
radio channel PHY rate of 11 Mbps. Thus, it is beneficial to 
improve the performance and properly dimension the WAcN 
for VoIP traffic. 
Along with the advantages of VAD feature for bandwidth 
reduction, its application may lead to sudden drop of the 
signal level during voice inactivity periods (OFF state), 
which is perceived unpleasant by the other dialogue party. 
Hence, to fill up this inactive period of time, a description of 
the background noise characteristics shall be sent from the 
inactive voice encoder. This is done by SID frames 
generated by the codec’s algorithm. The corresponding 
output signal is referred to as comfort noise [18]. Hence, we 
should note that the presence of SID packets in VoIP traffic 
pattern can affect the traditional ON-OFF traffic evaluation 
[19]. Since the ON-OFF model is not valid for such a case, 
in [14] authors even went so far as to suggest the notation 
ON-SID instead of ON-OFF. 
CAC techniques in modern wireless networks have been 
a subject of intensive study [4]. The design of CAC schemes 
for voice traffic has often been based on QoS performance 
metrics, which are treated separately (e.g., a design objective 
could be to achieve minimum packet loss rate for a specified 
delay constrains). On the other hand, in contrast to the TDM 
systems in which G.711 CBR codec can be only used, voice 
communications over packet networks can be realized by a 
number of low-bit-rate codecs for the purposes of bandwidth 
saving. Due to the complicated signal processing algorithms, 
user satisfaction strongly depends on the robustness of the 
particular type of codec to the instantaneous network 
performance (e.g., packet loss rate). In order to provide tight 
connection between both voice quality perceived by users 
and QoS parameters that shall be guaranteed by the network, 
either subjective or objective methods, developed through 
the years, should be incorporated. The Mean Opinion Score 
(MOS) is the most widely used subjective measure of voice

quality expression and the ITU-T E-model is a compu-
tational model for predicting voice quality from network 
parameters [20]-[22]. 
MOS-based rate adaptation for VoIP sources has been 
incorporated in [23]. Architecture for adaptive control of a 
VoIP source coding rate, based on the state of the network, is 
proposed. The goal is to maximize the voice quality 
perceived by the receiver. Similar approach is presented in 
[24], where dynamic joint source and channel coding 
adaptation algorithm for the AMR speech codec is proposed. 
It is aimed at finding the optimum solution between packet 
loss recovery and end-to-end delay in either wired or 
wireless networks, in order to maximize the perceived voice 
quality. The ITU-T E-model is successfully incorporated in 
[25], which proposes an optimization algorithm that selects 
coding scheme, packet loss bound and maximum link 
utilization for a VoIP connection. 
There are a large number of researches concerning the 
voice quality prediction models and their main application in 
playout buffer optimization algorithms. This is due to the 
fact that in the past, the choice of a buffer algorithm was 
entirely based on buffer delay and loss performance, treated 
separately (e.g., minimum end-to-end delay for a given 
packet loss). 
In [26] a method for enhancing perceived quality of 
streaming applications and adaptive playout buffer control is 
proposed. The method is based on the assumption that the 
relationship between MOS and packet loss for codecs is 
linear, which is not correct, especially for newer codecs. 
In [27] the assessment of how buffer algorithms affect 
perceived voice quality and how to choose the best algorithm 
and its parameters to obtain the optimal perceived quality has 
been carried out. The results are based on Internet trace data 
measurement and a new methodology for predicting speech 
quality, which combines the ITU-T Perceptual Evaluation of 
Speech Quality (PESQ) and ITU-T E-model. 
Taking into consideration the widespread use of the E-
model for voice quality prediction, Sun [28] points out that it 
is suitable for a limited number of codecs and network 
conditions. This is expressed by the necessity of performing 
time-consuming subjective test in order to derive model 
parameters. As a result, new accurate models for objective, 
nonintrusive voice quality prediction in packet networks are 
proposed. Based on a new methodology, authors of [28] 
propose efficient regression models, which can be applied 
for a number of modern codecs. 
The packet loss probability evaluation and accurate VoIP 
bandwidth estimation for aggregate traffic, with respect to 
the perceived voice quality metrics is a crucial task in a CAC 
dimensioning. Comparative study shows that a little of 
research activities concerning this topic area have been 
carried out so far. A new approach to solving this problem is 
a subject of the present article, taking into account VAD and

III. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
The current section deals with the development of 
analytical models for call- and talk-spurt level performance 
evaluation of the proposed CAC mechanisms for VoIP 
traffic transmission. 
Almost all known publications on packetized voice 
traffic performance over WAcN have a common feature – 
the investigations are carried out under overloaded (or nearly 
overloaded) system conditions. It is explained merely by the 
fact that the investigations are fulfilled by means of 
simulations. Good references are [29] and [30], where 
extensive research work and interesting characteristics of 
VoIP traffic service through a IEEE 802.16 system are 
obtained by means of simulations. Telecommunication 
service providers are mainly interested in system behavior 
under real traffic load, where the QoS measures such as call 
blocking, packet loss, etc. are rare events. The reason is that 
the QoS norms applied for commercial public networks 
restrict the traffic volume before an overload can occur. 
Direct simulation of rare events is time and resource 
consuming process. Thus, simulation acceleration methods 
are necessary to reduce the computing time. These methods 
may face certain problems. The proper setting of a particular 
method's parameters is critical for its performance and 
accurate results evaluation. An effective alternative is to 
employ analytical 
methods for system performance 
evaluation 
Another reason to have a preference on analytical 
methods is the necessity of cross-layer design application 
due to the radio channel characteristics. Multi-layer 
simulations are often hard to be performed because they 
involve widely different time scales [31] (e.g., call request 
arrival, packet arrivals, packet processing at MAC level, 
etc.). Performance analysis by means of multi-layer 
simulation will take large amount of time and may be 
unpractical for a broad class of problems analysis. 
The subject of interest is the traffic flow generated by 
multiple homogeneous sources and the bursty traffic in 
particular. Our considerations are restricted to streaming 
(real-time) traffic, generated by VoIP sources. We aim at 
developing an approach for Generalized VoIP (GVoIP) 
traffic source characterization and parameters estimation of a 
CAC for an access network. 
A. Modeling of VoIP traffic with VAD and SID over 
wireless systems 
А WLAN, WMAN or E-UTRAN, being an access net-
work, is just one hop of a multi-hop end-to-end connection. 
The total one-way delay for good voice quality is fixed by 
ITU-T recommendations [32] to be less than 150 ms. Both 
observations and simulations show that the MAC functional 
delay is about 15 – 20 ms [9]. The same delay sustains at the 
other end. An additional delay of 50–60 ms can occur due to 
the necessity of jitter buffer [19]. Therefore, after extraction 
of possible queues delays of the backbone routers the 
remaining delay budget for a wireless access network is quite 
limited. 
The stringent requirements on delays limit the ways in 
which the voice traffic losses (packet-scale and talk-spurt-
scale) can be handled. The packet-scale losses are easy to be 
prevented by means of a short buffer. However, it is not 
practical to prevent talk-spurt-scale losses by means of a 
335

buffer. The buffer in this case would have to be large 
enough, and this would introduce an unacceptable delay. The 
talk-spurt-scale losses can be reduced to an admissible 
amount by selecting an appropriate medium transmission 
rate C during the wireless access network traffic planning 
process. 
In this article, the bufferless fluid-flow approach is used 
for CAC parameters determination. The assumption that 
there is not a buffer at talk-spurt level leads to conservative 
estimates for packet losses and therefore to the safety side of 
CAC parameter determination. 
The bufferless fluid-flow model is used quite a while ago 
[33]–[35] and [5, Chapter 12] due to its effectiveness and 
simplicity. 
In the majority of investigations on VoIP traffic 
performance analysis, it is widely adopted the speech 
generation process to be modeled as a consequence of talk 
spurts and inactive periods, whose duration is usually 
assumed to be exponentially distributed. The so defined ON-
OFF model does not take into consideration the existence of 
SID frames in the voice traffic pattern, generated by the 
voice encoder. When the source is in the ON state, it 
produces voice frames with a constant bit rate, which are 
encapsulated in voice packets. During the OFF state, the 
source sends no packets. 
In order to determine the maximum number of calls 
(sessions) N admitted to the system by the CAC, meeting 
certain objectives, the bufferless fluid-flow or burst-scale 
loss approach is well-accepted. 
An ON-OFF traffic source is usually characterized by 
means of the following parameters: the bit rate during a talk-
spurt R; the mean bit rate r; the talk-spurt duration 
TON
 and 
the inactive period duration 
TOFF
. The mean bit-rate during 
ACT frames (packets) generation process is:

According to (1), an ON-OFF source could be characterized 
by means of any three out of four parameters. It should be 
noted that 
1/ α
 measures the peak to mean ratio of the rate 
produced by a call and α denotes the voice activity factor. 
By employing voice encoders that randomly generate 
SID frames (packets) during voice inactive periods, the OFF 
state bit-rate is 
ROFF > 0
. The VoIP traffic source with VAD 
and background noise transmission is called a Generalized 
VoIP (GVoIP) source [36]. A GVoIP traffic source is 
characterized by means of the above mentioned parameters 
plus the bit rate during the inactive period
ROFF
. Hence, the 
overall mean bit rate

 of a GVoIP source is derived as:

Since SID frames generation has an influence on the

be rewritten as follows:

The actual value of γ can vary, but usually the typical

values of α range from 0.35 to 0.45 [6]. Therefore, it could 
be expected an approximate increase of a GVoIP source 
mean bit rate up to 20 %. 
For an aggregated model of multiple homogeneous VoIP 
sources, which generate SID frames, the arriving flow rate

where, in the general case, i denotes the number of calls

B. System model and packet loss paradigm 
Let us formulate the problem of aggregating a number of 
voice traffic sources over the radio interface of an access 
network. We suppose C represents the total bit rate link 
capacity allocated by a base station, of a particular wireless 
access technology, for the purposes of streaming traffic 
transmission. It is convenient to use the notation R 
(transmission rate during talk-spurt period) as a unit 
transmission resource. Therefore, 
 
C = nR,
 
(6) 
where 
 
C R
n
/

(7) 
denotes the number of network resources (referred to as 
transmission resource units as well). In case of a classical 
ON-OFF model (without SID) n represents the maximum 
number of active calls that can be simultaneously served 
without any packet losses. 
However, if 
G
n  denotes the maximum number of active 
GVoIP traffic sources, including CNG feature that can be 
served simultaneously without packet losses, then:

Hence, the maximum number of talk-spurts (active calls) 
that can be simultaneously served without packet losses is 
not constant any more, but depends on the number of the 
calls i admitted to the system. Recall that in the classical ON-
OFF model, this value is constant and depends on C only (7). 
The main parameter of a proactive CAC scheme is the 
maximum number of calls (sessions) admitted to the system 
by the CAC, denoted by N. In order to gain from the 
statistical multiplexing, it is obvious that 
N > nG
. On the 
other hand, the following expression

fulfilled in order to prevent a buffer from permanently 
overflowing. Hence, the following condition can be derived:

The research efforts will be directed towards determining 
both the CAC threshold value N of maximum admissible 
calls (to keep the call blocking below the norm) and the 
radio-link resources n (necessary to keep the packet loss 
value below the norm). 
The analytical evaluation is based on the following 
parameters: the offered traffic A, in terms of Erlangs; the 
GVoIP source parameters (such as, TON, TOFF, R, and ROFF); 
the QoS parameters – call blocking probability B and packet 
loss probability
PPL
. 
Our attention is paid to the packet loss evaluation, as a 
more intricate task. The analytical model derived can be used 
for evaluation of the necessary medium transmission rate C, 
with respect to the packet loss probability requirements. 
The ratio of the packets loss rate to the arriving packets 
rate gives the probability of packet losses [5]

Both the numerator and the denominator in (12) represent 
flows that are mixture of packets that carry voice (ACT 
frames) and packets that carry background comfort noise 
(SID frames). As Estepa [16][38] have correctly pointed out, 
since the loss of ACT packets forms the main influence on 
the perceived voice quality, it makes sense to account the 
loss of ACT packets only. The proportion between ACT and 
SID packets in the excess rate flow varies and depends on 
the number j of talk-spurts. In the aggregated excess rate

A common feature, when N is determined, is to consider 
the case i=N only and evaluate PPL [5, pp. 141]. This 
corresponds to a system where all traffic sources suffer 
highest losses. For carrier-grade voice service the network 
operator has to guarantee QoS similar to that of circuit 
switched networks. For this reason, for a properly planned 
network the common assumption of i=N tends to be an 
extremely rare event. As a consequence, it is significantly 
important to take into consideration all possible system states 
for which losses are encountered, when performing an 
analytical evaluation of PPL. 
A VoIP source is either in an idle or busy state. In case of 
VAD function implementation the VoIP source is alternating 
OFF and ON states after the call is setup (Fig. 1a). An 
assumption is made that any call originates or terminates 
when it is in silence period only. In case a call can originate 
or terminate during an active period (during a talk-spurt) the 
call state-transition diagram is modified as shown on Fig. 1b.

coding schemes comprises of SID packets generated during 
the OFF periods. Thus, the presence of such packets affects 
the traditional ON-OFF traffic model and hence, the packet 
loss evaluation methodology when GVoIP sources are 
employed. 
Based on the state-transition diagram (Fig. 2) as well as 
the main properties of GVoIP sources, in any state for which 
j > nG
 a packet loss with certain probability occurs. On the 
other hand, it could be seen that the parameter
G
n is tightly 
coupled with the number of admitted calls, which is 
expressed by (9). 
Following (11), it is more realistic to consider the ratio of 
lost packets to all arrived packets just for VoIP calls with 
packet losses only, i.e. 
i > n
 (Fig. 2). 
Hence, the packet loss evaluation of aggregated GVoIP 
traffic flow could be obtained by the following expression:

Both the numerator and denominator in (21) represent a 
packet flow, which is a mixture of packets carrying voice 
(ACT packets) and those carrying background comfort noise 
pattern (SID packets). As it was pointed out earlier, we are 
interested in the ACT packets loss evaluation, due to their 
main influence on the perceived voice quality. The 
proportion between ACT and SID packets in the excess rate 
flow varies and depends on both the number of calls (i) and 
the number of talk-spurts (j). It should be noted that the total 
offered ACT flow at states with i calls is

The main contribution of the models we have developed 
is to propose a new paradigm of CAC dimensioning for 
VoIP traffic pattern generated from homogeneous sources 
with VAD and CNG features. As further part of the research, 
we address this problem from the users’ perspective as well, 
by incorporating the broad term of perceived voice quality. 
C. CAC Dimensioning with respect to the perceived voice 
quality 
The concept of user-perceived QoS and its evaluation for 
real-time services, such as VoIP, is a key issue, since it could 
provide a tight connection with the QoS metrics that shall be 
guaranteed by the network. In VoIP applications the delay 
and packet losses are the main impairments that have direct 
impact on the perceived voice quality, and the MOS is the 
most widely used measure for this purpose. 
Due to variety of voice coding schemes (codecs) and 
their robustness to the network conditions, all the 
information about the type of codec and packet losses is 
suitably 
represented 
by 
an 
appropriate 
equipment 
impairment model Ie, while the delay impairment model Id 
encompasses a number of impairments due to one way delay 
of voice packets. 
Since the models’ parameters are usually calculated by a 
set of complex equations [22], efficient regression models 
for objective, nonintrusive voice quality prediction in packet 
networks are proposed in [28], which combine the ITU-T 
speech quality measurement algorithms (either PESQ or 
PESQ-LQ) and ITU-T E-model. 
A non-linear equipment impairment Ie regression model 
for a number of contemporary low-bit-rate codecs is derived 
in [29] and has the following form: 
 
(
)
,
ln 1
c
b
a
I e
+
+
=
ρ
 
(23) 
where ρ denotes the packet loss probability (in percentage), 
and the parameters (a, b, and c) are derived under the PESQ 
or PESQ-LQ algorithm and depend on the particular coding 
scheme used. Employing complicated signal processing 
algorithms, voice codecs can also have an impact on the 
perceived quality under zero packet loss and delay 
conditions. This is expressed by the parameter c in (23). 
Unlike Ie which is codec dependent, the Id factor is 
common to all codecs and it could be derived by a 
polynomial fitting of 6-th order [28]. Among all the 
impairments included in Id, we take into consideration the 
following ones (assuming the rest to be in perfect condition):  
(a) packetization delay 
d pack
 – time taken to fill the 
packet payload, i.e. for the purposes of the packetization 
process it is necessary the number of codec frames Nfpp that 
will be encapsulated in each packet to be set. This option has 
a great importance, because for a particular type of codec, it 
can influence the bit rate the ACT and SID packets are 
generated. The packet mean bit rate is significantly 
increased, especially for low values of Nfpp, and vice versa. 
On the other hand, there is a trade-off between the packets 
mean bit rate and the packetization delay;  
(b) network delay – contemporary packet-based networks 
are too complex and large-scale systems. Thus, standard 
techniques for delay analysis are not well-suited and a 
common practice for such studies lies in the scope of 
statistical delay distribution modeling, based on a network 
configuration and acquired trace data. This topic is covered 
in more depth in [39] and several statistical distribution 
functions are investigated and applied in [40] for a network 
delay description. As a consequence of applying statistical 
analysis, the network delay can be expressed by its mean 
value, denoted by 
dn
. The overall mean packet delay is 
simply represented by

Taking as a starting point the VoIP packet loss model in 
which all possible system states are taken into consideration 
(Fig. 2), we extend it to include the models for perceived 
voice quality prediction addressed previously. We aim at

advantage factor A takes into account the fact that some users 
could accept the voice quality reduction in return to the 
service convenience, for instance wireless access connection. 
Typical values of the advantage factor are A = 0 (wireline 
access) and A = 10 (GSM network access). Thus, the average 
R factor, expressed by (28), considers all the impairments as 
a result of particular network condition and the type of 
coding scheme employed. 
The perceived voice quality is quantitatively expressed 
by the relationship between the R factor and MOS, as 
defined in ITU-T G.107 recommendation [22]. 
IV. 
NUMERICAL RESULTS 
The current section is concerned with a quantitative 
analysis and comparative study of the methods for CAC 
dimensioning we have proposed. 
In order to decrease the bandwidth usage the encoding 
scheme of each traffic source employs an activity detection 
function, which is quantitatively represented by the activity 
factor α. The offered traffic flow Ac is generated by multiple 
homogeneous (G)VoIP sources. The maximum number of 
calls (sessions) admitted to the system depends on the target 
call-level blocking probability B, which can be obtained by 
(16). 
The commonly accepted ON-OFF model ignores the SID 
packets in the VoIP traffic pattern (γ = 0) and thus, its 
application could cause significant errors in estimating the 
bandwidth required to meet the performance bounds of 
aggregated traffic flow. Focusing on a more realistic case, 
where voice source traffic pattern includes both a silence 
suppression feature and comfort noise generation, we 
analyze a CAC mechanism assuming the worst-case scenario 
with N admitted calls, i.e. 
i = N.
 We set the ACT packets 
loss probability threshold (14) to 
%
5.0
ACT =
PPL
 [21]. The 
aim of the study is to determine the maximum number of 
admitted users N in case a fixed amount of network resource 
units n is allocated for the VoIP service. The quantitative 
relationship among the variables of interest is shown on 
Figure 3. In spite of improving the naturalness of 
conversations by introducing the CNG feature, SID packets 
generation during inactive periods (γ = 0.1) leads to 
additional consumption of allocated resources. This results in 
decreasing the number of users admitted to the system.

Based on the required performance thresholds, such as B 
and PPL, as well as source traffic characteristics the task of 
CAC is to determine whether a connection can be accepted 
and, if accepted, the amount of network resources to be 
allocated. Fig. 4 depicts results of an access network 
dimensioning with typical values of PPL and α, under 
assumption 
of 
offered 
traffic 
flow 
generated 
by 
homogeneous ON-OFF sources (without CNG feature). A 
comparative study has been carried out by applying both the 
model presented in [5], expressed by (20) (we will refer to it 
as “model A”), and proposed analytical model (19) (we will 
refer to it as “model B”). The “model A” corresponds to a 
system that encompasses the set of states for which i = N is 
fulfilled. This is related to the most right column on the state-
transition diagram (Fig. 2). Since network service providers 
are interested in more realistic system performance 
evaluation, it is necessary all possible system states to be 
taken into consideration (we can denote this condition as 
i > n
). Numerical results show that this led to more efficient 
network resource (bandwidth) usage, because the system is 
not overdimensioned, as it is done by using (20). 
For carrier-grade voice service it is of crucial importance 
a VoIP dimensioning framework for accurate estimation of 
the network resource, required to guarantee the performance 
bounds of aggregated GVoIP traffic sources, to be applied. 
This issue is addressed by the proposed analytical model (21) 
and (22), which is valid for any VoIP coding scheme, by 
setting both parameters α (α = 1 corresponds to a CBR-type 
codec) and γ (γ = 0 – the model is valid for a VAD codec 
without CNG feature). We compare our dimensioning 
algorithm to the common approach of considering 
i = N
. 
Comparative study includes the derived exact formula (14) 
for packet loss evaluation. We consider G.729 and G.723 
coding schemes, both employing VAD and CNG features. 
Typical values of γ for both codecs are assumed to be 0.1 and 
0.03 respectively [16]. Results depicted on Fig. 5 reveal the 
bandwidth (in term of transmission resource units) required 
in order to satisfy QoS constrains of aggregated traffic load 
Ac. It is demonstrated the bandwidth allocation margin that 
results from applying the proposed methodology for packet 
loss evaluation (22) (
i > n
). 
On the other hand, silence suppression technology can 
considerably decrease the bandwidth usage needed. This is 
quantitatively represented on Fig. 6. Study results 
demonstrate that the same amount of network resource could 
be allocated to meet the call flow demands with higher value 
of activity factor (α = 0.45) when the proposed approach is 
applied, compared to the case for which i = N.

Since we are interested in the voice (ACT) packets loss 
probability evaluation, in our analysis, we ignore the SID 
packet losses which are a part of the overall packet flow. 
This is represented by (22). On the other hand, SID packets 
are characterized with a small number and size (typically 
γ<0.1), which means they would not have great impact on 
the precision of voice packets loss probability evaluation, 
expressed by (21). The results presented on both Fig. 7 and 
Fig. 8 let us answer this question. 
Fig. 7 depicts the comparison results of 
PPL
 and

more accurate results, Fig. 8 shows the absolute difference

 of (21) and (22) for the same case. It could 
be concluded that there is no sense of using (22) instead of 
(21), when the offered traffic volume is high (above a certain 
threshold) as well as it is expected the packet loss probability 
is small enough (e.g., less than 1.10-3). 
 
The current trend of wireless networks dimensioning and 
performance evaluation is going towards application-specific 
quality measures, which takes into consideration the end 
user’s satisfaction, rather than network parameters for QoS. 
This allows us to build a CAC mechanism that is capable of 
allocating the scarce network resource more precisely, based 
on the users’ perceived QoS. The admission decision policy 
is codec-dependent and relies on the MOS value, which is 
expressed by the average impairment factor (26). We 
consider the following modern low-bit-rate coding schemes, 
supporting VAD and CNG: G.729, G.723.1, and the AMR 
codec (the highest mode – H, and the lowest – L), which has 
been adopted in the 3GPP networks. It is assumed the AMR 
codec maintains the either mode for an active call duration. 
The codec parameters for different values of Nfpp are 
calculated according to [16] and presented in Table I. The IP 
packets flow rate during a voice source active and inactive 
state is denoted by R and Roff respectively. A sequence of Nfpp 
consecutive codec frames (either ACT or SID) are sent in a 
single IP packet payload every 
N fpp ⋅T
 seconds, where the 
value T is codec-dependent and denotes the frame inter-
arrival time. 
The feature under investigation is towards a CAC 
mechanism dimensioning of an access point. We assume 
negligible packet delay (Id ≈ 0), which does not have a direct 
impact on the perceived voice quality evaluation. In order to 
achieve minimum packetization delay the number of codec 
frames that will be encapsulated in each IP packet is set Nfpp 
= 1 by the voice application. 
Fig. 9 reveals the bandwidth (in terms of transmission 
resource units) required for offered aggregated GVoIP traffic 
flows to have a certain value of MOS, when a voice coding 
scheme of particular type is involved. The CAC decision 
policy is based on the target MOS value as well as the 
offered traffic load by setting call-level blocking probability 
B = 1 %. More generally, Fig. 10 depicts the link capacity

that shall be guaranteed by an access point in order to reach 
certain perceived quality level. MOS rating is based on [22].  
The method proposed could be incorporated into a codec 
negotiation procedure based on the allocated network 
resource and fulfilling the CAC decision criteria. 
The VoIP traffic service over WAcN may encounter 
certain difficulties as a result of the wireless domain 
characteristics. The scarce radio resource may be wasted due 
to the traffic flow formed by packets with relative long 
headers, which could exceed the voice payload field several 
times. In most cases, this drawback can be minimized by 
adjusting the sequence of Nfpp consecutive codec frames 
building an IP packet payload field. From QoS perspective, 
this option leads to increase of packetization delay and it is 
not very appropriate, especially in case the voice packets 
could encounter considerable network delay. Applying the 
“new paradigm” of CAC dimensioning, Fig. 11 depicts the 
perceived voice quality, which could be achieved, under 
specific network parameters for a number of popular low-bit-
rate voice codecs. It is assumed the aggregated GVoIP traffic 
load Ac = 40 Erl. It can be seen that for the same amount of 
consecutive voice frames per packet Nfpp, the access point 
shall allocate more resource when the average network delay 
dn increases. This arises from the necessity of keeping the 
perceived voice quality at the same level when network 
conditions are getting worse. At the same time, the scarce 
resource is not wasted when the maximum possible value of 
MOS is requested to be obtained, since the capacity 
allocation to links could be accurately estimated by the 
model we propose.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this article, we have focused on a more realistic case 
where VoIP source traffic pattern includes not only a silence 
suppression feature, but comfort noise generation as well. 
The adoption of the traditional ON-OFF model may cause 
significant errors in estimating the bandwidth required in 
order to meet the performance bounds of aggregated VoIP 
traffic flow. Both call- and talk-spurt level considerations for 
a teletraffic design of access networks for voice services are 
proposed and comparative analysis has been carried out. 
We propose a new paradigm of CAC dimensioning of 
wireless access networks serving packetized voice traffic. 
The new methodology has a broad area of application and is 
especially suitable for accurate link capacity estimation, 
taking into consideration the end user’s service satisfaction, 
rather than network parameters for QoS treated separately. 
The approach is valid for a number of modern low-bit-rate 
voice codecs, employing VAD and CNG functionality, and 
is insensitive to the wireless technology in use. 
Due to the great interest in emerging wireless access 
technologies, the research community is being interested in 
the system design, optimization and QoS requirements 
satisfaction of next-generation wireless access networks. The 
wireless environment features as well as user mobility draw 
the direction of the future research work. It will encompass 
the models we have developed and solve wireless 
communications resource management problems in order to 
maintain channel capacity and provide the performance 
guarantee. In order to achieve this goal, cross-layer 
adaptation and optimization mechanisms are going to be 
developed.
