of
Learning
Management System (LMS) utilized in higher education using
clustering techniques. LMS is an essential technology to
support virtual learning environment where students have
access to the learning materials that their instructors provide,
submit the deliverables, and participate in various learning
activities involving group projects, discussion forums, quizzes,
and Wikis. However, the returns on large investment have not
systematically performed in terms of what extent of students
and instructors have utilized the system for their teaching and
learning. In this study, 2,639 courses opened during 2013 fall
semester in a large private university located in South Korea
were analyzed with 13 observation variables that represent the
characteristics of academic courses. Three clustering methods
including Gaussian Mixture Model, K-Means clustering, and
Hierarchical clustering contributed to (1) identifying large
number of courses that show inactive and no usage of LMS, (2)
disclosing
the dramatically
imbalanced clusters,
and (3)
identifying
several

INTRODUCTION
Currently, universities are increasing incorporating a
Learning Management System (LMS) to support effective
teaching and learning [1]. Whether focusing on campus-
based learning in higher institute or distance learning, LMS
is considered as an essential technology for virtual learning
environment
on
e-learning
systems
where
instructors
provide various learning materials such as text, images,
URL links and video clips to learners.
A common goal of LMS is to organize and manage
different courses within an integrated system [1]. The
integrated systems collect each learner’s online behavior
data in every class. Based
on this data educational
researchers and practitioners can analyze and interpret
learners’ status during the semester. University staff or
decision makers can leverage such LMS usage trends
analytics to derive proper treatment and policies to current
learners.
Such a data-driven approach has been attempted in the
field of higher education recently with the term of academic
analytics. It has emerged after the widespread of data
mining practices by the influence of business intelligence [2,
3]. This approach has been evaluated as a new tool to
respond to increased concerns for accountability in higher
education and to develop actionable intelligence to improve
student success and learning environment [4]. For example,
instructors and academic consultants are better able to
understand the learner’s learning behavior and performance,
even their thoughts based on the rich data. Further, the
academic analytics can help more strategic investment and
development in a way to fulfill the needs of students and
instructors based on the informed analytic results via the
pattern-recognition, classification, and prediction algorithms
of [5].
The data analytics in education has helped to develop
prediction models for academic success of learners based on
their behaviors and participation or identifying at-risk
students for special guidance from their faculty and advisors
[6, 7]. However, the previous applications of analytics have
disclosed a further research to apply the elaborated analysis
and develop more precise prediction models to prevent the
drawbacks from the wrong feedbacks to students [8].
Therefore, as a preliminary research, this study highlights
the need of the examinations of current usages and patterns
of LMS. Instead of analyzing the individual student level
data, the academic course data as a unit of analysis was
utilized. We argue that without the thorough analysis on
LMS usages and patterns and accurate clustering of the
courses, it would not be able to build elaborated prediction
models to estimate students’ success and failure based on
the online behavior records in LMS.
The data sets utilized for academic analytics can be
diverse depending on the characteristics of institutions [5].
Not
only
the
aforementioned
LMS
but
also
course
management system (CMS), audience response systems,
library systems are the examples. In this study, we utilized
LMS dataset to analyze students’ virtual learning behaviors
and CMS data to collect the academic course’s general
information. By using both LMS and CMS data, the

clustering analysis of academic courses on the basis of
virtual learning environment usage levels and patterns were
synergistically
performed.
For
the
rigorousness
and
thoroughness on data analytics we employed multiple
methods of clustering analysis: Gaussian Mixture Model, K-
Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering. The specific
research questions were as follows:
RQ1) To what extent have instructors and students
utilized LMS for their teaching and learning?
RQ2) What clusters are formed as the patterns of LMS
usages?
RQ3) How does clustering analysis detect academic
courses that present inactive usage of LMS or
unique LMS usage patterns?
II.
METHODOLOGY
This study aimed to find a group of classes that are as
homogenous as possible within group (cluster) and as
inhomogeneous as possible between groups (clusters) based
on their online activities and class sizes.
A.
Research Context
The context of this study was a private university located
in Seoul, Korea. With the supports of institution for teaching
and learning in the university, we collected academic course
data of the year of 2013 fall semester. All courses were
opened using Moodle-based virtual learning environment
regardless of the course type such as offline and online.
Consequently, total 4,416 courses were analyzed at the initial
data analysis step. However, since it was revealed that many
courses did not use online campus, the exclusion of such
non-active courses were performed. Finally, 2,639 courses
were observed for this study with 13 variables.
A data set for analysis was prepared by combining two
databases: CMS and LMS. CMS dataset contained course-
related information indicating each student’s hierarchical
categorizations (i.e., graduate VS. undergraduate, mandatory
VS. selective, affiliated colleges and department) and LMS
dataset included online behavior tracks (i.e., total number of
resources, notices, lecture notes, submissions, group works
etc.). We integrated CMS and LMS dataset, and these data
were divided in general indicator and activity-based indicator.
Table I shows a total of 13 variables.

Clustering Methods
1)
Gaussian Mixture Model
GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes all data are
from the mixture of normal distributions. The variables must
be numeric since we assume that the data are from the
multivariate
normal
distribution.
The
parameters
(the
proportion of each group, mean vectors, and variance matrix)
are estimated by EM algorithm. In general, the number of
clusters is very hard to estimate in the clustering analysis.
However, we can estimate the optimal number of clusters in
GMM using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). We
use the R-package “mclust” for GMM. The mclust package
in R can estimate not only the number of clusters but also the
optimal form of variance matrix. We will use the number of
clusters from the GMM for the K-means and the hierarchical
clustering, too.
2)
K-means clustering
K-means clustering is one of the most popular clustering
method because it is very fast to find clusters and very easy
to understand. The objective function of K-means clustering
is to minimize the sum of within scatters. Basically, it tries to
find the k group that minimizes within-cluster sum of
squares; therefore it maximizes the between-cluster sum of
squares. Since it uses the squared Euclidean distances among
the objects and the cluster centers are defined as the means
of objects in each cluster, all variables must be numeric. We
use K-means function in R for our analysis.
3)
Hierarchical clustering
Hierarchical clustering method is used for building a
hierarchy of clusters from data. Strategies for this clustering
fall into two types: agglomerative for “bottom-up” approach
and divisive for “top-down” approach. We use a bottom-up
approach in this article. The algorithm finds the nearest two
objects and merges them. It repeats this process until all
objects are in one cluster. The final results are usually
represented by the dendrogram. The hierarchical clustering
methods can give different results depending on which
distance metric we use between groups. There are several
distance metrics between groups and we use the “complete-
linkage” in our analysis. The “complete-linkage” is the
maximum distance between two groups and it is known that
the “complete-linkage” can find the compact clusters. We
use “hclust” function in R for our analysis.

As shown in Table 2, most variables have extremely high
values. For example, the maximum values of variables
indicate that 596 resources (RES), 176 lecture notes (LEC),
1612
board
postings
of
group
works
(GRO),
2,810
discussion postings (POS), and 215 Q&A postings (QNA).
These values present extremely high utilization level of few
courses.
On closer inspection, one course which posted 2,810
forum discussion postings was big-sized basic requirement
course and there were over a hundred students who signed
up for class. There were 11 groups and they discussed
enthusiastically with each other, so such very high postings
were possible. Next, the other course which had 1,612 group
works was the major course of educational technology and
the instructor assigned team project during the semester.
There were 10 groups and they used group board for team-
based learning. Because they uploaded all the related
materials for project, opinions and chatting messages in
group board, so this high value was also possible. These
cases looked as errors but it tells the ‘real aspects’ of unique
courses.
Furthermore, the data were sparse by showing many
observations with zero values. The variables from QNA to
WIK have zero values for more than 50% of data. We can
predict that there will be a single one big cluster with a lot of
‘zero’ observations. This one big cluster will have all the
classes with minimal online activities. This cluster was not
our interest but we were more interested in other clusters of
small size and how different they are.
B.
Gaussian Mixture Model
As Figure 1 indicates, Mclust finds the best model is
three clusters with EEV (ellipsoidal, equal volume and shape
covariance). In the point of three components (clusters), the
increase of BIC starts decrease. However, four-cluster model
is also close. Thus, we decided to investigate both three-
cluster and four-cluster model.

We checked the mean vectors (cluster centers) of three
clusters. As Figure 2 indicates, cluster 3 (size 67, green line)
has the higher mean values (more online activities) and
cluster 1 (size 212, black line) is in the middle, and cluster 2
(size 2,360, red line) has the least online activities. On a
closer view, cluster 3 has greatly high value of POS and
cluster 1 has high GRO value.

Figure 2. Mean vector plot of three clusters
Look inside the clustering table, 2,360 out of total 2,639
classes were included in cluster 2 where having at least
online activities. They were inactive classes. Approximately
89% of total class did marginal performance at online
campus. On the other hand, cluster 3 was the most active
online classes. We can guess that these classes were actively
discussed about their topic since both number of forum
discussion postings and average log-in frequency per person
are quite high. The rest courses in cluster 1 also participated
in group work much but the average frequency mean is in-
between cluster 2 and 3. This cluster is specialized in team
project.
2)
GMM with four clusters
We divided total classes into four clusters this time. The
size of four clusters were 71, 2,322, 230, and 16 as sheen in
Table IV.

Figure 3. Mean vector plot of four clusters
When reviewing the cluster mean vector plot in Figure
3, cluster 4 (size 16, blue line) has extremely high mean
values in POS while cluster 2 (size 2,322, red line) has low
mean
values in
general.
Cluster
4
shows
the equal
appearance with the cluster 3 in GMM with three clustering
analysis. Moreover, in common with GMM with three
clustering results, 9th variable (GRO) is shown the highest
value in cluster 3 (size 230, green line), not the cluster 4
which has higher values in the gross. Courses which
involved in cluster 3 were inactive in most of online
activities except group works. Newly-drawn cluster 1 (size
71, black line) has the highest MEM value and it represents
number of members including an instructor, teaching
assistant and students. We are able to call its name, ‘big-
sized courses’.
The last thing we should observe carefully is that when
we clustered total courses into four clusters using GMM,
number of courses with highly active in online activities
such as forum discussion postings and log-in frequency
were decreased from 67 (see Table III) to 16(see Table IV).
C.
K-means clustering
In addition to GMM, we also performed a clustering
analysis using K-Means. As a first step, we analyzed with
non-standardized dataset to see overall clusters and compare
the results with GMM. However, due to the large scale
differences among variables, we also conducted clustering
with standardized dataset because we like to see the
clustering results when all variables have the similar
contributions in distances.

Using non-standardized data
The
results
of
K-means
clustering
with
non-
standardized
data
showed
similar
results
with
GMM
analysis. But this process was meaningful because the
results identified fewer active online courses.
a) K-means clustering with three clusters
Figure 4. Mean vector plot of three clusters
Most of mean vector values about learners’ online
behavior were quite similar, similarly low but FRE, GRO,
POS variables were distinguished among clusters. Learners
who were included in cluster 3 (size 6, green line) classes
logged LMS in the most frequently and wrote up the
postings on the forum very much. Cluster 2 (size 71, red
line) has high value of GRO which means group works.
Cluster 1 (size 2,562, black line) which the most of classes
were in has less online action.

Six courses included in cluster 3 are listed on Table VI.

(POS).

Figure 5. Mean vector plot of four clusters
When we were partitioning total courses into four
clusters, cluster 3 and 4 were somewhat unique. Cluster 3
(size 11, green line) has high value of GRO variable and
cluster 4 (size 6, blue line) is shown much online action in
FRE and POS variables. As mentioned earlier, students in
cluster 4 courses discussed with one another constantly and
this fact can be proved by FRE and POS. Like the preceding,
cluster 3 performed intensive group works. Newly created
cluster 2 (size 109) compared to previous results was shown
the middle activeness in LMS.

2)
Using standardized data
Prior to clustering data, we rescaled variables for
comparability. So standardized data was utilized in this step.
It showed quite different figures in mean vector plots for the
plot of non-standardized dataset. Since K-means uses the
squared Euclidean distance, the outliers can affect the
clustering results significantly. However, if we use the
standardized dataset, then the effect of outliers will be
reduced, therefore it is unlikely to see very small sized
clusters.
a) K-means with three clusters
Figure 6. Mean vector plot of three clusters
As shown in Figure 6, cluster 2 (size 22, red line) has
high mean vector value on the whole. FRE, ACT, LEC,
SUB, LIN, POS, QUI and WIK values of cluster 2 were
high. Among these, those courses used quiz function very
frequently, so QUI was shown excessive activity log in
comparison with other clusters.

Cluster 1 (size 2,030, black line), about 77% of courses
contained, was shown the low activeness in general without
exception. However, cluster 2 was generally active. Cluster
3 (size 587, green line) was middle-active according to the
LMS usage levels, but it had top-of-the-line value in MEM,
RES and GRO. In contrast with non-standardized clustering
results, these clusters were distinguished by the level of
usage, not the unique extreme values.
b) K-means with four clusters
Figure 7. Mean vector plot of four clusters
Cluster 3 (size 8, green line) had unusually high mean
vector
values
in
QNA,
compared
to
other
clusters.
Moreover, such MEM, RES and WIK values were also high.
We can interpret this situation that there were many
members in class, so lots of questions came out together.
Another cluster 4 (size 30, blue line) has high action value
in FRE, ACT, LEC, SUB, LIN, POS and QUI. In other
words, students eagerly participated in LMS in average
since the average log-in frequency per person value was the
biggest among other cluster. Furthermore, we could assume
that the courses provided both a great deal of course-related
materials and the grade-related assignment. High values of
SUB (number of task submission) and QUI (number of
quiz) as well as LEC (number of lecture notes) and LIN
(number of URL links) are the evidences. However, cluster
1’s (size 1,979, black line) action was minor despite it took
most of virtual learning environment courses. Likewise the
previous analytic results of cluster 3 (size 587, green line),
cluster 2 (size 622, red line) was shown the middle
activeness.

158th course utilized many activity items (ACT = 7) in
moderate way and interestingly used Wiki function in its
course. It was the course of economics department. Actually,
15 times was not that huge usage number but as almost the
whole courses had not used Wiki (M = .01, SD = .31), this
class was chosen for the sole course in cluster 2 because of
WIK.

unparalleled usage. It was possible because there were lots
of members in class. Every person uploaded 27.28 postings
averagely and it would be an acceptable number.

Four clusters analytic result was pretty similar with
those three clusters hierarchical clustering. Cluster 2 and 3
courses (158th and 255th class) were the same with the
previous result. However, newly created cluster 4 (size 3)
differed from the previous one. Three classes out of 2,637
courses had high mean value in RES (number of resources).

These three courses did not utilized many activities so
the variables from SUB to WIK got almost zero value.
Specifically, courses had the highest RES values. We can
interpret that instructors in these courses chose the resource
application instructional method and provided many useful
resources for the subject.

instructors provided references from the web in big-sized
courses.

This case, cluster 2 (size 5), 4 (size 1), 5 (size 1) and 6
(size 3) took on an exactly the same aspect with five clusters
hierarchical clustering. All the courses which were included
in each cluster were the same. Some courses in previous
cluster 1 (size 2,620) were divided into two clusters in here
as cluster 1 and 3 (size 9).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The purpose of study was to cluster academic courses in
higher
education
in
accordance
with
virtual
learning
environment usage levels and patterns. For this goal, we
employed three methodologies: Gaussian mixture model, K-
Means clustering and hierarchical clustering and could draw
several implications.
The results of this study found that clusters were
considerably imbalanced. Descriptive statistics revealed that
outliers from dataset were so abnormally high in some
variables. On the other hand, most of values were quite low
and most of them were zero. This initial data condition led
to disproportionate result and this would be the reason that
some enthusiastic courses continuously came up. It may not
be the cluster in which decision makers wanted to see from
LMS usage patterns in higher education institute. However,
this real combined data and the results emphasize the true
status quo. We can infer that instructors do not know much
how to use virtual learning environment well and they might
have a hard time to facilitate the LMS use. It is time for
academic leaders and university decision makers to form a
practical plan which can improve utilization in a balanced
way.
Nevertheless, this study revealed that certain enthusiastic
courses were drawn out repeatedly when using these three
clustering
methods.
Since
such
courses
had
unique
characteristics distinguishing from other courses, this study
suggests a further in-depth study to examine remarkable
instructional methods and challenges in aspect of teaching
and learning.
Three methodologies (Gaussian Mixture Model, K-
means clustering and Hierarchical clustering) for clustering
analysis of academics was meaningful respectively. GMM,
as an initial step, was essential to check overall clusters of
2,639 academic courses opened during one semester. As
classic and the most popular algorithm, K-means with both
non-standardized and standardized dataset contributed to
identify prototypical LMS usage patterns by revealing
clusters of course utilized forum-based online instruction,
quiz-based online instruction, and wiki-based instruction.
Hierarchical clustering method was also valuable for the
detection of extreme outlier courses that revealed resource-
based online instruction. Because of hierarchical analytic
approach, few outlier could not be included in other cluster
naturally but it was left in isolation. This study confirmed
that the different strengths of three methodologies leveraged
to escalate the effectiveness and robustness of clustering
analysis.
Finally, this study represented that online learning
activity
was
fairly
marginal
despite
the
advance
of
information and communication technology (ICT) and its
applications for promoting blended learning policy in higher
education. We conclude that offline courses were central to
most of higher education. We found too many courses did
not incorporate a variety of activity items. LMS such as
Moodle and Blackboard provides lots of meaningful activity
opportunity like discussion, group works, quiz and Wiki.
Although we consider that there might be some cultural
characteristics of university in South Korea, we believe the
analytics methods and approaches incorporated in this study
contribute to the area of academic analytics in the field of
higher education.
