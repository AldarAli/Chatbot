Abstract—College admissions in mainland China depend mainly
on the scores of the standardized annual examination called
Gaokao. Students submit a common application to their provin-
cial Gaokao ofﬁce, on which they are allowed to list a ﬁxed and
small number of universities and majors they intend to study.
The admission process in a province follows one of the following
three admission models: parallel, gradient, and a combination of
both. No matter what admission models are used, there is always a
possibility that an applicant could end up being rejected by every
university listed in the application, even though the applicant
could have been accepted by a university not in the list. This
process presents a challenge for students to ﬁgure out how to
select universities to apply so that they can be admitted by a
university and major that match their abilities and interests. To
many students, and their parents, this is a difﬁcult decision to
make and their experience is unpleasant. To help reduce this
agony, we present a new approach of applying Technique for
Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to
generate a personalized selection of the best suited universities
and majors that match a student’s Gaokao score and meet a
list of criteria. We then present case studies to demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach.
Keywords–TOPSIS; weighted criteria; multi-attribute decision
making; recommendation system

INTRODUCTION
Gaokao is the standardized annual examination for col-
lege entrance in mainland China, which takes place in early
June every year. It is mandatory for admission into four-
year colleges and universities. Each year during the last 10
years, there were over 9 (sometimes over 10) million high-
school graduating students participating in Gaokao according
to Chinese Education Online (http://gaokao.eol.cn/). Students
must choose one of the two types of exams; namely the Li-
Ke exam (meaning the science exam) and the Wen-Ke exam
(meaning the liberal-arts exam). The Li-Ke exam must be taken
by students for entering the disciplines of science, engineering,
agriculture, and medicine; and the Wen-Ke exam must be
taken by students for entering the disciplines of arts, humanity,
education, and management. Students ﬁnd out their Gaokao
scores in late June, followed by the application and admission
process that would last from one to two months.
Students in the same province must complete a common
application form either prior to taking Gaokao or after, de-
pending on the province or municipality in which they have
ofﬁcial residency. A municipality is a very large city directly
under the central government and so is treated as a province.
When the admission process starts, each application is
released to a university selected from the universities listed
in the application according to certain rules. That is, not all
universities listed in an application can see the application
simultaneously. If the university that receives the application
rejects it, then the application is released to the next university
in the list. However, this university may have already ﬁlled
out its admission quota by then. Recall that students are
only allowed to list a ﬁxed and small number of universities
and majors on their application forms. Thus, in addition to
obtaining good Gaokao scores, students need to ﬁgure out
which universities and majors they should apply to maximize
their chances of acceptance while meeting their education
goals. Note that each student can only be accepted by one
university, or not accepted at all. This process is fundamentally
different from the US where students may apply to universities
directly as many as they would like and receive acceptance
from multiple universities.
In mainland China, universities are ofﬁcially categorized
into three tiers based on the qualities and the number of
programs they offer. National universities are the ﬁrst tier,
provincial universities are the second tier, and regional uni-
versities are the third tier. There are about 120 ﬁrst-tier,
750 second-tier, and 1,550 third-tier universities. Applicants
need to specify their preferences according to the ofﬁcial
categorization.
Each university sets an admission quota for each province
each year, which is broken down into majors. Each province
sets its own rules on how universities access applications.
These rules may be grouped into three admission models:
parallel admission, gradient admission, and hybrid admission.
Mismatched admissions is a common problem. That is, if
applicants apply to universities inappropriately, they may end
up receiving no offer or an offer that is a poor match of their
abilities or interests even though they could have been accepted
by a university that presents a better match.
Both Gaokao and college admission are conducted only
once a year. Once a student is admitted by a university to
a particular major, it is almost impossible to change majors
after admission. Thus, it is important to identify best-suited
universities and majors to apply to, and students must complete
their applications in a short period of time after Gaokao. To
help reduce this agony, Lu, Zhang, and Wang [1] presented
an automated system using General Morphological Analysis
(GMA), based on a proprietary mathematical model for pre-
dicting admission scores for each major of each university
in the current year, to analyze a large volume of data from
previous years of Gaokao and help students make informed
decisions based on their Gaokao scores and interests.
GMA is a method for identifying and investigating the
total set of conﬁgurations contained in multi-dimensional, non-
quantiﬁable problem complexes. It is “totality research” that
attempts to derive all the solutions of any given problem

in an unbiased manner. For a given admission model, we
use GMA to identify suitable universities and majors for a
student based on the student’s Gaokao score and interests [1].
However, GMA does not allow students to specify weights
over each interest they are interested to compute the best-
suited university and major for the students. We present in
this paper a method using Technique for Order Preference by
Similarity to an Ideal Solution(TOPSIS) to ﬁll this void. In
particular, based on the universities and majors recommended
by GMA for a student, we allow the student to specify the
weight for each attribute and then use TOPSIS to compute
the best-suited university and major. TOPSIS is a method for
multi-criteria decision making, which was originally developed
by Hwang and Yoon in 1981 [2] with further developments
by Yoon in 1987 [3] and Hwang, Lai and Liu in 1993 [4].
TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative
should have the shortest geometric distance from the positive
ideal solution [5] and the longest geometric distance from the
negative ideal solution [5]. It compensates aggregation and
compares a set of alternatives by identifying weights for each
criterion, normalising scores for each criterion, and calculating
the geometric distance between each alternative and the ideal
alternative. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst
to use TOPSIS to produce Gaokao recommendations.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion II, we describe how we identify all the suited universities
and majors using GMA. In Section III, we describe TOPSIS
and use it to generate the best-suited universities and majors
among the suitable solutions found using GMA. In Section IV,
we present two case studies and conclude the paper in Section
V.
II.
IDENTIFY ALL THE SUITED UNIVERSITIES AND
MAJORS USING GMA
Lu, Zhang, and Wang [1] used computer assisted GMA to
compute all possible combinations of majors and universities
that are for students at various degrees according to their
Gaokao scores and their interests under the admission model in
their province. Let LU denote the set of labels for university
slots in an application form, J the number of universities a
student is allowed to specify for each tier, and K the number
of majors a student is allowed to specify for a university. For
example, in application forms for students living in the Fujian
province, J = 4 and K = 6.
For convenience, in what follows we will use Alice to
represent a student and XYU to represent a university. Alice
enters her Gaokao score and other information to obtain
recommendations for X-universities, where X ∈ LU, and we
call them X-recommendations. For example, when J = 4,
we have A-, B-, C-, and D-recommendations, respectively.
Universities listed in A-recommendations are competitive for
Alice, but Alice still has a chance to be accepted. Universities
listed in B-recommendations would present a good match of
Alice’s ability and interests, which means that Alice would
have a good chance to be accepted. Universities listed in C-
recommendations are conservative choices for Alice, which
means that Alice would have a very good chance to be
accepted. Universities listed in D-recommendations are the
safest choices for Alice, which means that Alice would have
a near 100% chance to be accepted.
The baseline GMA setting consists of 14 parameters,
divided evenly into two groups, one group for students and
one group for universities. Parameters in the student group
are (1) Alice’s Gaokao score; (2) the type of the exam that
Alice takes; (3) the tier of the universities that Alice wants to
attend; (4) locations where Alice wants to go to for college; (5)
locations Alice does not want to go to for college; (6) Majors
that Alice wants to study; (7) majors that Alice does not want
to study.
Parameters in the university group are (1) the lowest
admission score of XYU in the past year; (2) the type of majors
that XYU offers; (3) XYU’s ofﬁcial tier; (4) XYU’s location;
(5) the majors that XYU offers, including (when possible) the
lowest, medium, and highest admission scores for each major
in the past year, and the total number of expected enrollment
for a major for the current year; (6) the ranking of XYU (the
ﬁrst-tier universities are ranked from 1 to 5 with 1 being the
highest one; the second-tier universities are ranked from 6 to 7;
and the third-tier universities have one rank of 8); (7) the total
enrollment of XYU for the current year (When this number is
not known, it uses last year’s enrollment number).
III.
IDENTIFYING THE BEST-SUITED UNIVERSITIES AND
MAJORS USING TOPSIS
TOPSIS is a multi-objective decision making method over
a hierarchical structure of alternatives with multiple criteria. At
the top level is the optimization goal. The next level consists of
a list of criteria, which may be decomposed further into several
levers of sub-criteria. The bottom level consists of a list of
alternatives to be measured against each criterion. The criteria
can relate to any aspect of the decision making, tangible
or intangible, carefully measured or roughly estimated, well-
deﬁned or poorly understood.
Based on the concept that the chosen alternative should
have the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal
solution and the longest geometric distance from the negative
ideal solution, TOPSIS compensates aggregation through com-
parisons of alternatives by identifying weights for each crite-
rion, normalizing the scores for each criterion and calculating
the geometric distance between each alternative and the ideal
alternative, which is the best score in each criterion. TOPSIS
allows tradeoffs between criteria, where a poor result in one
criterion can be negated by a good result in another criterion.
This provides a more realistic form of modeling than non-
compensatory methods, which include or exclude alternative
solutions based on hard cutoffs [6].
To use TOPSIS, we need to ensure that the criteria of
attributes are either monotonically increasing or monotonically
decreasing and use normalisation to compensate incongruous
dimensions in multi-criteria problems [7][8].
A. Criteria
After using GMA to obtain all suitable combinations of
majors and universities for Alice, we create an evaluation
matrix consisting of m alternatives and n criteria, where the
alternatives are universities (XYU) and majors suitable for
Alice, and the criteria are listed below:
1) Academic environment: This is the academic atmo-
sphere of the city where XYU is located. In this paper we use
the number of universities in the city where XYU is located
to represent academic environment.

2) Economy: This is the economic growth level of the
city where XYU is located. The China Business Network
Weekly publishes a ranked list of economic growth for all
the cities in China every year. Cities are ranked from the ﬁrst
tier to the eighth tier according to their economic development,
with the ﬁrst being the best (such as Beijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou).
3) Enrollment: This is the summation of the enrollment
ﬁgures of all suitable majors of XYU.
4) Interest matching: This is the matching of Alice’s fa-
vored majors with suitable majors of XYU. In mainland China,
areas of studies are ofﬁcially classiﬁed into a hierarchy of three
classes. The Class-1 category consists of 11 general areas of
studies: (1) Philosophy, (2) Economics, (3) Law, (4) Education,
(5) Literature, (6) History, (7) Science, (8) Engineering, (9)
Agriculture, (10) Medicine, (11) Management.
Each area in Class 1 (referred to as Class-1 subject) often
consists of a number of subjects referred to as Class-2 subjects.
For example, Science is a Class-1 subject, which consists of
12 Class-2 subjects: (1) Math, (2) Physics, (3) Chemistry,
(4) Astronomy, (5) Geographical Sciences, (6) Atmospheric
Sciences, (7) Ocean Sciences, (8) Geophysics, (9) Geology,
(10) Biological Sciences, (11) Psychology, (12) Statistics.
Each Class-2 subject further consists of a few subdisci-
plines referred to as Class-3 subjects. For example, Math is
a Class-2 subject, which consists of two Class-3 subjects: (1)
Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, (2) Information and
Computing Science. Each subject in any class is uniquely
identiﬁed by a subject code.
We allow students to specify majors at the Class-1 level,
Class-2 level (after Class 1 is speciﬁed), or the Class-3
level (after Class 2 is speciﬁed) [1]. Let (a, b, c) denote a
speciﬁcation of major, where a is a subject in Class 1 (which
could be empty), b a subject in Class 2 (which could be empty),
and c a subject in Class 3 (which could be empty). Note that
if a is empty, then b and c must be empty. Likewise, if b
is empty then c must be empty. Given a major speciﬁcation
(a, b, c) entered by s, we deﬁne the following terms:
1)
We say that a match occurs at level 3 for student s
with university u if one of the following conditions
are satisﬁed:
a)
The university u offers c.
b)
The university u offers b, and c is empty (in
this case, any Class-3 subject offered by u
under b is deemed speciﬁed by s).
c)
The university u offers a, and b is empty (in
this case, any Class-3 subject offered by u
under a is deemed speciﬁed by s).
d)
The speciﬁcation (a, b, c) is empty (in this
case, any Class-3 subject offered by u is
deemed speciﬁed by s).
2)
We say that a match occurs at level 2 for student
s with university u, if b is offered by u, but c (not
empty) is not offered by u.
3)
We say that a match occurs at level 1 for student
s with university u, if a is offered by u, but b (not
empty) is not offered by u.
In addition to matching majors, we would also like to put
more weight on university u if it offers more majors under a
given Class-2 subject, for it provides more related disciplines
of studies for student s. For a particular Class-2 subject b, let
nb denote the number of Class-3 majors u offers under b.
5) Ranking: This is the group ranking of XYU. The ﬁrst-
tier universities are characterized into ﬁve groups: Group G1
consists of the two super universities: Peking University and
Tsinghua University. They are the best funded and most rep-
utable universities in China. Both universities are designated
by the Chinese government as project-985 universities. There
are 39 universities in mainland China with this designation,
which are the national key universities; Group G2 consists
of the top ten universities after Peking and Tsinghua. They
are also project-985 universities. Group G3 consists of all the
remaining 27 project-985 universities; Group G4 consists of
all the ofﬁcially designated project-211 universities, excluding
project-985 universities. These are universities having top
programs in certain areas; Group G5 consists of the remaining
ﬁrst-tier universities. The second-tier universities can also be
further characterized into two groups: Group G6 consists of
provincial key universities; Group G7 consists of the remaining
universities in this tier. Group G8 consists of all the universities
in the third tier.
B. Weights
Alice enters a weight value wj for each criterion Cj, where
wj ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 10} with the following meanings: 0 is to
ignore this criterion; 2 is to consider this criterion with no
importance, 4 is moderately important; 6 is strongly important,
8 is very strongly important, 10 is extremely important, and 1,
3, 5, 7, 9 are between the above scales.
C. TOPSIS Steps
Step 1. Create an evaluation matrix U with universities as
alternatives and the criteria set up above.
U =

Step 2. Normalize matrix U to form the matrix R =
(rij)m×n, where for i = 1, 2, . . . , m and j = 1, 2, . . . , n,
rij = uij

Step 3. Normalize weights entered by Alice such that the
new weights, still denoted by wj for criterion Cj with j =
1, . . . , n, satisﬁes Pn
j=1 wj = 1. This is often referred to as
linear normalization.
Step 4. Multiply the weights to each of the column entries
in the matrix R to obtain a new matrix T = (tij), where
tij = wirij, for i = 1, 2, . . . , m and j = 1, 2, . . . , n. That is,
T =

Step 5. Determine the best alternative vector, denoted by
AAAb; and the worst alternative vector, denoted by AAAw. Write
AAAb = (tb1, tb2, . . . , tbn)T ,
(2)
AAAw = (tw1, tw2, . . . , twn)T .
(3)
Let J− = {j | Cj is the smaller the better, j = 1, . . . , n} and
J+ = {j | Cj is the larger the better, j = 1, . . . , n}. Then for
j = 1, 2, . . . , n,
tbj =

max{tij | i = 1, 2, . . . , m},
if Cj ∈ J+,
min{tij | i = 1, 2, . . . , m},
if Cj ∈ J−;
(4)
twj =

min{tij | i = 1, 2, . . . , m},
if Cj ∈ J+,
max{tij | i = 1, 2, . . . , m},
if Cj ∈ J−.
(5)
Step 6. For each alternative Ai with 1 ≤ i ≤ m, calculate
the Euclidean distance between (ti,1, ti,2, · · · , ti,n)T and AAAb,
denoted by dib, and between (ti,1, ti,2, · · · , ti,n)T and AAAw,
denoted by diw, as follows: dib =
qPn
j=1(tij − tbj)2, and
diw =
qPn
j=1(tij − twj)2, where i = 1, 2, · · · , m.
Step 7. For each alternative Ai, calculate the similarity to
Aw as follows:
siw = diw/(dib + diw),
(6)
where 0 ≤ siw ≤ 1, i = 1, 2, · · · , m. The alternative Ai with
the largest value siw is the best alternative. In other words,
that university is the optimal one for Alice.

CASE STUDIES
We present two case studies, where Tom and Bob are
high school seniors in the JiangSu Province. In JiangSu,
each student must select two subjects from Politics, History,
Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Biology, and Technology; and
take them in addition to the must-take Gaokao subjects of
Chinese, Mathematics, and English. The two selected subjects
will be graded with a letter grade for A+, A, B+, B, C, or D.
The three Gaokao subjects are graded numerically. Students
who take the Li-Ke exam must choose Physics and students
who take the Wen-Ke exam must choose History in their two
selected subjects, respectively. Note that the selected subjects
are criteria for GMA, not for TOPSIS. For a student to be
admitted to a university, a good Gaokao score and good grades
of selected subjects are a must. We will analyze the ﬁrst-tier
optimal recommendation for Tom and the second-tier optimal
recommendation for Bob using TOPSIS, and justify that they
make sense. We use data in the year of 2015 for demonstration.
A. Case A
Tom obtains a Gaokao score of 407 in the Li-Ke exam
and A+ for both of his selected subjects. He is not interested
in Literature, Economics, Law, Medicine, Management or
Engineering, and he likes to study in Beijing or the Hubei
province. The weights he gives to academic environment,
economy, enrollment, interest matching, and ranking are 5, 4,
1, 1, and 7.
For the 2015 Gaokao in the Jiangsu province, the highest
mark in the Li-Ke exam was 425 out of 480 (the student with
this mark went to Tsinghua University) and the highest mark
in the Wen-Ke exam was 418 out of 480 (the student with this
mark went to Peking University). The mark of 407 in the Li-
Ke exam was ranked from the 80th to the 94th among about
180,000 students who took the Li-Ke exams. Students in this
range were admitted to top universities including University of
Chinese Academy of Sciences and Renmin University of China
in Beijing; and Wuhan University and Huazhong University of
Science and Technology in Hubei. Table I shows the values for
TOPSIS on the following universities recommended by GMA
based on Tom’s Gaokao score and interests, where AE stands
for Academic Environment, IM for Interest Matching:
•
China Agricultural University (CAU),

Huazhong University of Science and Technology
(HUST),

Tables II and III represent, respectively, the linear normal-
ization and criterion weight normalization. Table IV represents
the process of multiplying the weights to each of the column
entries in the normalized matrix of university values for
TOPSIS. Tables V and VI show the best alternative vector and
the worst alternative vector, respectively. Table VII displays the
Euclidean distance between alternatives and the best alternative
vector, and the worst alternative vector, respectively. Table VIII
shows the similarities to the worst possible alternatives.
From Table VIII, we can see that RUC (Renmin University
of China) in Beijing has the largest value. From Table II, we
can see that RUC has the top score for each criterion except
Enrollment, and from Table III, we can see that Tom cares
more about Ranking, Academic Environment, and Economy,
and he does not care much about Enrollment or Interest
Matching. Thus, all things considered, we conclude that RUC
is the best-suited university for Tom to apply. Based on the
admission data in 2015, we conﬁrm that RUC did admit
students with Gaokao scores similar to Tom’s.

From Table XVIII, we can see that NUPT (Nanjing Univer-
sity of Posts and Telecommunications) has the largest value.
From Table XI, we can see that NUPT has the top score for all
the criteria except Economy. From Table XII, we can see that
Bob cares more about other criteria than Economy. Thus, we
can conclude that NUPT is the best-suited university for Bob
to apply. Based on the admission data in 2015, we conﬁrm
that NUPT did admit students with Gaokao scores similar to
Bob’s.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Gaokao is a unique and major annual event in mainland
China, which affects the lives of about 10 million graduating
high-school students each year, and attracts tremendous atten-
tions by their parents, relatives, and teachers. We presented
an automated tool using computer assisted TOPSIS over big
data to identify the best-suited university that matches the
student’s Gaokao score and interests. Our case studies showed
that the recommendation provided by TOPSIS makes sense.
Using computer assisted TOPSIS, students can easily ﬁgure
out the best universities to apply under different sets of weights
for the criteria. In a future project, we plan to fully develop
this tool by allowing students to specify their own criteria.
