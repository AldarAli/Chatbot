Abstract— White-nose syndrome (WNS), caused by the fungal 
dermatophyte (Pseudogymnoascus destructans), is considered 
the most important disease affecting hibernating bats in North 
America. The identification of dermatophytic fungi, isolated 
from the skins of cave-dwelling bat species, is necessary to 
distinguish pathogenic (disease-causing) microbes from those 
that are innocuous. This distinction is an essential step for 
disease diagnoses, early detection of the presence of microbial 
pathogens 
prior 
to 
symptom 
development, 
and 
for 
discrimination between microbes that are present on the skins 
of hibernating bats. Early detection of P. destructans infections 
of bats prior to symptom development is essential to provide 
effective early treatments of WNS-diseased bats which 
significantly improves their chances of survival and recovery. 
Current diagnostic methods using quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (qPCR) for the detection of the microbes on bats 
require invasive methods (skin swabs) that tend to arouse 
hibernating bats resulting in consumption of valuable fat 
reserves that reduce their chances of winter survival. Also, 
qPCR only indicates the presence and quantity of fungal 
inoculum on bat skin, but does not indicate that the fungus has 
infected the host or that a state of disease exists since substrate 
fungal DNA used for PCR comes from outside of the host (on 
the surface of the skin) rather than from within the host (in 
deep subdermal layers of the skin). Consequently, we are 
developing non-invasive methods for the early detection of 
WNS-disease and other microbes of bats based on their 
production of unique mixtures of volatile organic metabolites 
that may be detected using a dual-technology, electronic-
nose/gas 
chromatography 
device 
for 
identifying 
and 
discriminating between the microbial metabolites produced in 
pure cultures. We determined that the Heracles II e-nose 
system was effective in discriminating keratinophilic fungal 
species using principal component 
analysis (PCA) of 
smellprints signatures coupled with discrimination index (DI) 
and gas chromatographic retention times (RTs) of major VOC 
GC-peaks produced in culture headspace.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
A large diversity of microbes have been isolated from the 
skins of cave-dwelling bats [1][2]. The skin-swabbing of 
small mammalian trogloxenes (animals that are temporary 
cave residents and move freely in and out of caves), 
particularly insectivorous bats while in hibernation (i.e., in a 
state of torpor), is a common practice among animal 
pathologists and wildlife researchers interested in obtaining 
cultures and conducting diagnostic tests for determining the 
etiology of various dermatophytic diseases acquired by 
volant mammals. Bats are known to be attacked by relatively 
few fungal dermatophytes including Pseudogymnoascus 
destructans (Pd), causing deep-seated skin infections, and 
Trichophyton redellii (ringworm) that causes superficial skin 
infections [3]. Over the past decade, White-nose Syndrome 
(WNS), caused by the psychrophilic dermatophyte and 
pervasive fungal pathogen P. destructans, has emerged as 
the most important disease of cave-dwelling bats in North 
America, 
causing 
extensive 
mortality 
and 
regional 
population declines of hibernating bat species in the eastern, 
mid-western and southern United States as well as 
southeastern Canadian provinces [4]. WNS is known to 
significantly affect at least eight species of bats in North 
America including the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), the 
gray bat (Myotis grisescens), the eastern small-footed bat (M. 
leibii), the little brown bat (M. lucifugus), the northern long-
eared bat (M. septentrionalis), the Indiana bat (M. sodalis), 
the 
tricolored 
bat 
(Perimyotis 
subflavus), 
and 
the 
southeastern bat (M. austroriparius) [5]-[7]. The capability 
of clinical diagnosticians to detect and discriminate between 
the microbes growing on the skins of bats is a critical 
necessity for studying and identifying dermatophytic 
microbes involved in the complex interactions that occur on 
bat skins between fungal pathogens, innocuous microbes, 
and host defense responses that ultimately influence the final 
outcome of pathogenesis and disease development. To 
address this diagnostic capability, we are developing new 
noninvasive diagnostic tools and technologies to identify and 
discriminate between microbes that grow and multiply on the 
skins of bats in hibernation and outside of hibernacula. 
Electronic-nose (e-nose) devices have been used 
extensively to identify microbial pathogens in culture which 
are causal agents of diseases in plants, animals, and humans 
[8][9]. Various types of e-nose devices, utilizing different 
operational mechanisms for chemical detection, are 
particularly useful and effective diagnostic tools for the 
discrimination of  complex gaseous mixtures of volatile

organic compounds (VOCs) that compose the most common 
metabolic products of microbes released into the headspace 
of microbial cultures [10][11]. Some important potential 
advantages of e-nose devices as diagnostic tools, particularly 
for hibernating bats, are noninvasive early detection of 
infectious diseases and causal agents (minimal disruption of 
bat torpor patterns and behavioral disturbances during 
hibernation), rapid real-time disease detection capabilities 
using portable e-nose devices, low-cost diagnostic testing, 
high precision of measurements, low incidence of false 
positive results, and complex VOC-mixture detections 
without identifying individual chemical species within 
diagnostic samples [12][13]. 
Soil-borne psychrophilic (cold-loving) fungi related to 
the Pd-pathogen include other Pseudogymnoascus species 
(such as P. appendiculatus, P. roseus, and P. verrucosus), 
and numerous Geomyces species. Geomyces pannorum var. 
pannorum is a nonaggressive pathogen that occasionally 
causes superficial human dermatophytic diseases [14][15]. 
Although these fungi are somewhat related genetically and 
metabolically, differences in specific metabolic pathways 
used by these microbes result in the production of different 
types, combinations and mixtures of VOCs produced and 
released 
into 
the 
headspace of 
microbial cultures. 
Consequently, unique complex VOC-mixtures, released into 
culture headspace, may be used as a basis for discriminating 
between microbial species when analyzed by specialized gas 
sensor arrays such as e-nose devices [8]. 
The objectives of this study were to 1) determine the 
capability of the Heracles II fast gas chromatograph (GC)/E-
nose combination-technology instrument to discriminate 
between related keratinophilic fungi, including both 
pathogenic and innocuous species, isolated either from bat 
skin or from soils, a common reservoir of inoculum for 
fungal dermatophytes of bats, 2) document differences in gas 
chromatogram component peaks and patterns of VOC fungal 
metabolite mixtures released into the culture headspace of 
microbes tested, and 3) develop an aroma map indicating the 
relatedness and differences in fungal headspace VOC-
metabolites of keratinophilic fungi based on 3-dimensional 
principal component analysis (PCA). The results from this 
study will be used to evaluate the efficacy of this dual-
technology e-nose for discrimination of cultures of P. 
destructans and related fungi. 
This paper is composed of an introduction to 
dermatophytic fungi of bats and the use of e-nose VOC-
metabolite detection approaches in section 1, followed by 
experimental methods used for this work in section 2, 
describing the specific details of methods used in association 
with e-nose and GC runs and analytical procedures, followed 
by experimental results in section 3 providing details of 
research results and findings for e-nose analyses of fungal 
VOC metabolites from the headspace of microbial cultures, 
including sensor output responses to VOCs, PCA e-nose 
aroma maps of fungal dermatophytes, and associated data.

II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Fungal Strains and Growth Conditions 
Eight genetically-related keratinophilic fungi were tested 
in this study including: Pseudogymnoascus destructans 
20631-21 (PD6), the ATCC type strain originally isolated 
from a little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) at Williams Hotel 
Mine, New York; Pseudogymnoascus destructans M-3902 
(PD3) 
from 
West 
Virginia; 
Pseudogymnoascus 
appendiculatus 
UAMH-10509 
(PA1) 
and 
Pseudogymnoascus verrucosus UAMH-10579 (PV1), both 
isolated from a Sphagnum fuscum-Picea mariana bog near 
Alberta, Canada; Pseudogymnoascus roseus 722101 (PR1), 
the type strain of the genus [16]; Geomyces pannorum CCF-
340 (GP2), Geomyces pannorum CCF-338 (GP5), and 
Geomyces pannorum var. pannorum CMF-2582 (GP8) were 
obtained from the Center for Forest Mycology Research 
(CFMR; Madison, WI). All media were sterilized at 121°C 
under 15 PSI for 20 minutes. For long-term storage at 
−80°C, strains were grown and maintained in 24 hour 
darkness on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (4% dextrose, 
1% Neopeptone, 2% agar), incubated at 14°C for 8 weeks.  
Asexual spores were collected by washing sporulating SDA 
cultures with 5 ml of 0.1% deoctylsulfosuccinate (DSS) in 
SD broth to which an equal volume of 50% glycerol was 
added to suspend hydrophobic conidia [17]. 
B. Sample Preparation and Prerun Procedures 
All fungal strains tested were grown on SDA slants in 100 
mL Kimax GL45 glass bottles with 40 mL SDA culture 
medium per bottle.  Five glass-bottle cultures were prepared 
as replications for each strain. Three bottles of uninoculated 
SDA slants (SAB) served as controls. GL45 PBT open-top 
screw caps were fitted with Pyrex PTFE-faced silicone 
rubber septa. Agar slants were inoculated with 20 µl of 
frozen conidial spore suspension, spread with a sterile glass 
rod. Cultures were grown in darkness at 14°C for 4 weeks. 
To allow headspace VOCs to accumulate, cultures were 
moved to room temperature at 21°C in the dark for 18 hours 
prior to analysis on a weekly basis. The total quantity of 
VOCs accumulating in culture headspace over each weekly 
period were largely removed from bottle cultures for analysis 
each week so that the quantity of VOCs analyzed weekly 
indicated the quantity that had accumulated only over a one-
week period. 
C. Instrument Configuration and Run Parameters 
The Heracles II GC/Electronic-nose system (Alpha MOS, 
Toulouse, France), composed of a dual-column (DB-5 and 
DB-1701 output) fast-gas chromatograph (GC) with flame-
ionization detector (FID) and multiple e-nose sensors, was 
utilized for all culture VOC-headspace analyses. Fungal 
VOC-metabolites were manually injected using 15 ml of 
culture headspace per sample via 20 cc (Cadence Science 
Inc., Cranston, RI) glass syringe, trapped at 30 °C for 50 s 
before split-injection at 10 ml/min into DB-5 and DB-1701 
GC columns following isothermal heating at 240 °C for 30 s

at 57 kPa of pressure. Analyses were conducted at an initial 
oven temperature of 50 °C, ramping at 1 °C/s up to 80 °C, 
then accelerating the heating rate to 3 °C/s up to 250 °C for 
21 s. Analyzer injection volume was set at 5000 μl at a speed 
of 125 μl/s, injection temperature of 200 °C at 10 kPa 
pressure, injection time 45 s, and venting at 30 ml/min. The 
two FID detector temperatures, for separate dual columns, 
were set at 260 °C. Retention times (RTs) of VOCs were 
recorded for each peak for both GC columns. 
The e-nose analyzer component of the dual-technology 
Heracles II system utilizes a very large number of 
proprietary sensors in the sensor array. For data analyses 
involving statistical discrimination algorithms, only those 
sensors in the array that provided the largest output 
responses that added significantly to sample discriminations 
were utilized in data analyses, such as for PCA plots and 
derivations of aroma signatures or smellprint patterns that 
define the unique aroma fingerprints of VOC-metabolite 
mixtures contained within fungal headspace volatiles. 
D. Data Acquisition Parameters and Run Schedule 
Data acquisition rates for both GC data recording and e-
nose data from the sensor array were collected every 0.01 s 
intervals (100 data points per second) set at a constant data-
recording rate for the entire duration of each analysis run. 
Total run time for all analysis runs was 110 s. Both dual 
GC-columns and e-nose sensor arrays were purged with 
ultrapure air or blank samples between each sample 
analysis. 
E. Principal Component Analysis 
Three-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) 
was performed on e-nose data using Heracles II software to 
compare the relatedness between aroma signature patterns 
derived from e-nose sensor array output responses to fungal 
VOC-metabolite mixtures in culture headspace. Distances 
between centers of data clusters (PCA mapping distance), 
derived from sensor array outputs of each fungal culture 
headspace (aroma classes or sample type), were determined 
on a PCA plot or aroma map by pairwise comparisons of 
aroma classes (sample types) in all possible combinations 
along with aroma Pattern Discrimination Index (PDI), 
expressed as a percentage, indicating the statistical level of 
discrimination (P-values) between each corresponding 
sample type compared based on aroma signature patterns 
(smellprints).

RESULTS 
A. Gas Chromatography VOC Peak Analyses 
Analyses of gaseous VOC-mixtures produced by 
individual fungi in culture headspace, based on gas 
chromatographic (GC) patterns on chromatograms, provided 
indications of differences in the types and quantities of 
volatile metabolites produced. Most of the fungi tested 
produced common metabolites with peaks at RTs of 16.50 s 
and 26.57 s in 3-week old cultures, although P. destructans 
strains did not produce the 26.57 peak until several months 
later in older cultures (Table I).

a. Peak heights indicate relative heights of individual peaks, representing 
separate VOC-metabolites produced by each fungal strain at the indicated 
RTs (for DB-5 column) derived from GC-chromatographs in separate 
analyses of headspace from fungal cultures on SDA medium. Symbols PL = 
VOC peak was produced later (in older cultures). 
 
The 
VOC-metabolite produced 
at 
RT=16.50 
varied 
considerably in peak height for different fungi (up to 11-fold 
difference in quantities between G. pannorum and P. 
destructans strains, but variations in peak heights for the 
VOC-metabolite produced at RT=26.57 was quite consistent 
for all fungi tested with the exception of the G. pannorum 
var. pannorum strain that did not produce this metabolite. 
The unique production of two distinct metabolites at 
RT=15.30 and RT=59.60 only by the G. pannorum var. 
pannorum strain was considerably different from the other 
fungi, particularly G. pannorum strains that did not produce 
these particular VOC-metabolites at all. The two strains of P. 
destructans also produced a unique metabolite at RT=63.10 
that was not produced by the other fungi. 
 
B. E-nose Signature Patterns of Headspace Volatiles 
Comparisons of differences in e-nose smellprint patterns, 
derived from multisensor e-nose array outputs of the 
Heracles 
II 
GC/Electronic-nose 
instrument, 
provided 
additional data for discriminating between fungal species 
based on differences in e-nose multisensor responses to 
unique VOC-metabolite mixtures produced in culture 
headspaces. The e-nose smellprints produced by the 
multisensor array in response to differences in VOC-
metabolite mixtures were significantly different from that of 
SDA-medium alone that served as a control for comparisons 
to indicate the smellprint of background VOCs released from 
the common SDA culture medium itself (Figure 1, A-G).

Figure 1.  E-nose aroma signature patterns (smellprints) of complex 
headspace volatile mixtures, composed of fungal VOC metabolites from 
cultures of fungal dermatophytes and control: A) P. appendiculatus, B) P. 
roseus, C) P. verrucosus, D) G. pannorum, E) G. pannorum var. 
pannorum, F) P. destructans, and G) SDA medium control. 
The sensor numbers, labeled on the x-axis, are listed in 
the same order for all sample types analyzed. All of the 
smellprints, produced as sensor responses to VOC 
headspace volatiles of fungi in culture, varied considerably 
in sensor response intensity, shown on the y-axis, and in 
overall smellprints compared with each other and with the 
SDA-control (Figure 1G). The smellprint pattern of P. 
appendiculatus differed quite drastically from the other 
Pseudogymnoascus species, including the WNS fungal 
pathogen (P. destructans), P. roseus, and P. verrucosus 
(Figure 
1 
A-C,F). 
The 
smellprint 
pattern 
of 
P. 
appendiculatus only superficially resembled that of G. 
pannorum strains, but differences in individual sensor 
intensity responses varied considerably (Figure 1 A,D). 
The aroma signature patterns (smellprints) of culture 
headspace volatile metabolite mixtures of P. roseus and P. 
verrucosus were fairly closely related in appearance (Figure 
1 B,C). However, the smellprint patterns of G. pannorum 
strains and the G. pannorum var. pannorum strain GP8 
unexpectedly showed very little resemblance (relatively few 
sensor responses in common), but a very significant number 
of major and minor sensor responses were considerably 
different between these two sample types for the majority of 
sensors responding to VOC-metabolites within the e-nose 
sensor array (Figure 1 D,E). The smellprint pattern of P. 
destructans strains was uniquely different from those of 
other Pseudogymnoascus species and Geomyces species 
tested with relatively few major sensor responses and many 
minor sensor responses at low intensities (Figure 1 F). 
C. Principal Component Analysis 
The differences observed in sensor responses of the 
Heracles II e-nose sensor array to complex gaseous mixtures 
of volatile metabolites released into culture headspace were 
analyzed statistically using principal component analysis 
(PCA) to measure and quantify the differences between e-
nose aroma signatures produced by individual fungi. 
Pairwise comparisons of e-nose aroma profiles, tested in all 
possible combinations to assess and measure these 
differences, indicated widely varying PCA mapping 
distances (between data clusters for individual fungal 
species) and statistical differences as measured using a 
percentage Pattern Discrimination Index (PDI) for each 
pairwise comparison (Table II). These analyses collectively 
included 36 distinct PCA-pairwise comparisons between 
individual strains of each fungal species and between the 
fungal strains and uninoculated SDA slant (SAB) controls. 
All nine fungal strains tested showed high levels of 
significant differences from SDA-culture medium controls, 
both in terms of PCA mapping distances (range of 21,992-
106,723 mapping units) and percentage PDI (range of 72.3-
98.7%). PDI results provided precise numerical values 
(percentage indications) of differences between sample 
types in all possible combinations. The higher the value, the 
lower the relatedness between each paired combination.

a. PCA aroma mapping distances indicate actual plotting distances 
between centers of data clusters for each combination of sample types 
compared. b. Percentage values for aroma Pattern Discrimination Index 
(DPI) indicate the P-value of significant differences (expressed as a 
percentage) for each pairwise comparison between sample types being 
compared, based on PCA-statistical testing of aroma plot data. 
 
The P. appendiculatus strain (PA1) PCA-mapping data 
cluster was most significantly different from P. roseus strain 
(PR1), G. pannorum var. pannorum strain (GP8), and P. 
destructans strain (PD3) based on mapping distance 
(between data clusters) and PDI (%). Strain PA1 of P. 
appendiculatus was considerably less different (more 
related) to P. verrucosus strain (PV1), but moderately 
different from G. pannorum strains (GP2 and GP5) as 
indicated by lower mapping distances and PDI values. 
P. roseus strain PR1 showed a PCA mapping data cluster 
that had very high significant differences in aroma mapping 
distances and PDI values from strains GP2 and GP5 of G. 
pannorum and strain GP8 of G. pannorum var. pannorum, 
but much less differences with data clusters of strains PD3 
and PD6 of P. destructans. 
P. verrucosus strain PV1 displayed PCA mapping data 
clusters with highly significant differences in aroma 
mapping distances and PDI values when compared with P. 
destructans strain PD3, but only moderate differences with 
strains GP2 and GP5 of G. pannorum, strain GP8 of G. 
pannorum var. pannorum, and lower levels of significant 
differences with P. destructans strain PD6. 
The PCA mapping data cluster of G. pannorum strain 
GP2 had low levels of differences in aroma mapping 
distances and PDI values when compared with data clusters 
of G. pannorum strain GP3, but differences in these two 
PCA statistical parameters were highly significant when 
compared with PCA data clusters of P. destructans strains 
PD3 and PD6 as well as G. pannorum var. pannorum strain 
GP8. Very similar results were observed for PCA 
comparisons of the mapping data cluster of G. pannorum 
strain GP5 with P. destructans strains PD3 and PD6 and G. 
pannorum var. pannorum strain GP8. 
Construction of a 3-dimensional plot (aroma map) of all 
sample types tested using PCA provided a visual means of 
comparing the PCA mapping distances between data clusters 
of each sample type as well as an overall Discrimination 
Index (DI), indicating the relative overall strength or level of 
discrimination between all sample types included in the PCA 
test.  Displayed DI values are validated by the Heracles II 
software (using green highlighting), indicating a passing 
PCA test at P≤0.10 level of significance when a successful 
discrimination between sample types is achieved. 
The plotted aroma data cluster of G. pannorum var. 
pannorum strain GP8 was most obviously separated from 
the other fungi tested as indicated in the 3-dimensional PCA 
aroma map of fungal VOC-metabolite mixtures in culture 
headspace (Figure 2). The overall discrimination index (DI) 
was 67.0 for this 3-D PCA plot. 
A most surprising result was the discovery that G. 
pannorum var. pannorum strain GP8 produced an aroma 
signature that was highly different from G. pannorum 
strains GP2 and GP5. 
Mapping data clusters in the 3-D PCA plot of e-nose 
aroma signature data among Pseudogymnoascus species 
generally were well separated with only a few minor 
overlaps for some combinations between species. Data 
clusters for P. destructans strains were most distant (least 
related) with P. appendiculatus strain PA1, intermediately 
distant from  (moderately related with) P. verrucosus strain 
PV1, and least distant from (most related to) P. roseus strain 
PR1.

The percentages of total variance, accounting for the 
variability 
explained 
by 
each 
orthogonal 
principal 
component, are as follows: PC 1 = 95.6%; PC 2 = 3.0%; and 
PC 3 = 0.7%. Thus, most of the variability in the PCA was 
accounted for by PC 1 (x-axis), whereas PC 2 (y-axis) and 
PC 3 (z-axis) account for only a small proportion of the total 
variance.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Analyses of VOC-peak patterns from GC chromatograms 
of volatile metabolites produced in culture headspace 
indicated that most of the fungi tested produced metabolites 
at the same two RTs, suggesting the production of some 
common VOCs and the likely use of similar metabolic 
pathways by these genetically-related fungi. Differences in 
VOC peak heights at specific RTs provide evidence that 
different keratinophilic fungal species and strains may utilize 
slightly different metabolic pathways or have gene 
duplications within the genome that produce varying 
quantities of common VOC-metabolites in culture [18]. 
G. pannorum var. pannorum produced two unique VOC-
metabolites that were different from those produced by all 
other related fungal species tested. Significant differences in 
VOC-metabolite mixtures (produced in culture headspace) in 
addition to pathogenicity differences, combined with PCA 
pairwise-comparisons and e-nose mapping data of VOC-
metabolite mixtures, all suggest that G. pannorum (strains 
GP2 and GP5) and G. pannorum var. pannorum strain GP8 
function metabolically as separate species and that G. 
pannorum var. pannorum perhaps should be elevated as a 
distinct new Geomyces species, rather than just a variety, or 
perhaps a new Pseudogymnoascus species. The taxonomy of 
Geomyces and Pseudogymnoascus species currently is in a 
state of flux and some researchers already consider G. 
pannorum var. pannorum to be a Pseudogymnoascus species 
based on more recent DNA-homology results from genetic 
studies. 
The authors chose to compare the relatedness between 
smellprint patterns, derived from e-nose sensor array output 
responses to fungal VOC-metabolites, using the PCA 
method with PDI values because these e-nose analysis 
procedures are most useful for providing precise numerical 
values of differences with statistical levels of significance.  
The WNS-pathogen P. destructans was most closely related 
metabolically to P. roseus and P. verrucosus, and less related 
to P. appendiculatus based on 3-dimensional PCA mapping 
distance, PDI, and data clustering on the e-nose aroma map. 
These results were consistent with similar indications of 
relative genetic relatedness between these species based on 
genetic analyses using genomic DNA-homology tests [19]. 
The uniquely different mixtures of VOC-metabolites 
produced in culture headspace by strains of P. destructans, 
compared to its non-pathogenic cave-dwelling psychrophilic 
(cold-loving) and saprophytic relatives consisting of other 
Pseudogymnoascus and Geomyces species commonly in 
cave sediments, indicate that the Pd-pathogen has shifted its 
metabolic pathways toward pathogenic phenotypes and 
greater utilization of keratinogenic substrates. Recent 
evidence suggests that this shift in substrate specialization 
from saprobic to pathogenic phenotypes in P. destructans 
has occurred at the expense of reduced saprotrophic enzyme 
activity [20]. This data suggests that P. destructans has co-
evolved over time with its bat hosts and moved away from 
the utilization of carbon sources in the environment, leading 
to its somewhat reduced capacity for saprotrophic growth. 
Although P. destructans is still considered a competent 
saprotroph that persists and sporulates in cave sediments 
(presumably due to its emergence from non-pathogenic 
ancestors), its reduced activity of urease and endoglucanase 
saprobic enzymes provide evidence that it may be shifting 
toward increasingly pathogenic activity [20][21].   
Our results indicate that the Heracles II GC/e-nose dual-
technology instrument was effective in discriminating 
between genetically-related species of Pseudogymnoascus 
and Geomyces, common keratinophilic fungi of bat skin, 
based on the production of unique VOC-metabolite mixtures 
in culture headspace. Furthermore, PCA provided indications 
of differences in metabolic relatedness between fungal 
species based on unique mixtures of fungal VOC-metabolites 
produced. This capability of e-nose devices to detect and 
discriminate between complex VOC-metabolites produced 
by pathogenic and non-pathogenic keratinophilic fungi of 
bats could potentially provide a new effective means for the 
noninvasive early detection and diagnosis of devastating 
wildlife diseases, such as WNS. A cheaper, more portable e-
nose device potentially could be useful for both rapid 
diagnosis of the disease in living bats and for determining the 
cause of death post-mortem [22][23]. The WNS-epizootic 
has already killed over six million hibernating bats in North 
American since the disease was first detected and identified 
in New York State in 2006 [1][24][25]. Consequently, there 
is a need for a rapid, noninvasive method for early WNS 
disease detection at the geographical advancing front of the 
epizootic in order to allow for the application of very early,

more effective WNS-control applications, particularly prior 
to the appearance of WNS-disease symptoms, as newly 
approved treatments are developed and become available.
