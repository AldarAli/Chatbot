Abstract— A land based 2.3 MW horizontal axis wind turbine 
steel supporting tower was instrumented with a Fiber Braggs 
Grating Strain array.  The turbine was subjected to forced 
yawing of the nacelle during periods of low wind in order to 
isolate a baseline structural response.  The strain experienced 
in the tower was presented as a function of yaw angle, and was 
shown to vary in a sinusoidal manner as a response to the 
eccentric loading condition present at the nacelle-tower 
interface.  The yaw-strain baseline was shown to have strong 
inter-sensor cross correlation and is discussed in the context of 
a healthy structural response record with possible future 
utilization in SHM schemes.

INTRODUCTION 
  Due to the high initial implementation costs of wind 
energy, 
increasing 
the longevity of the 
entire turbine system 
is 
an 
important 
factor contributing to 
the 
economic 
viability 
of 
wind 
energy projects [1].  
One of the main 
components 
of 
a 
horizontal axis wind 
turbine system is the 
structure’s 
supporting 
tower.  
The 
towers 
themselves 
are 
usually constructed 
from 
steel, 
are 
assembled 
in 
multiple sections [2-
4], 
and 
are 
commonly designed 
to have a lifespan of 
20 to 30 years [3-4].     
Unlike most of 
the mechanical systems (rotors, control motors, bearings etc.)  
that can be replaced without dismantling major components 
of the system, repairing a damaged tower can be a costly 
procedure requiring specialty surface preparations, welding 
techniques and surface finishing [4].  In situations where 
damage is irreparable, replacing a damaged tower section 
involves an extraordinary amount of down time and 
resources to complete.  In order to replace a full tower 
section, the entire nacelle and rotor assembly must be 
disassembled and subsequently re-assembled [5].  The ability 
to monitor and identify problems within the tower structure 
in a timely manner could help prevent a small tower defect 
from growing into a larger problem.  This is commonly 
referred to as structural health monitoring (SHM). 
Structural 
health 
monitoring 
has 
a 
history 
of 
implementation on large scale civil infrastructure such as 
bridges, dams and pipelines in order to prevent or predict 
catastrophic structural failure [6].  SHM has also been 
applied to wind turbine mechanical systems such as rotor and 
blade assemblies [7-9].  There has recently been interest in 
the literature regarding SHM of the supporting towers for 
wind turbines [10-11].  The basic premise of SHM 
techniques is that damage to a structure, such as a crack in 
the material, results in the changing of the structures 
dynamic properties (stiffness, damping, etc.).  This change in 
physical properties results in a change in the structures’ 
response (strain, natural frequencies, mode shape etc.) to 
service conditions.  SHM strategies work to identify the 
changes in structural response in order to detect structural 
damage [10, 12-13].  Works examining the response of 
turbine towers have mostly focused on the structural 
dynamic response of wind turbine towers by means of finite 
element analysis [3, 14-18] and in-situ monitoring of wind 
turbine towers using accelerometers and/or strain gauges 
[19-21].  The main focus of these studies has been improving 
tower design methods. 
Since many SHM schemes compare measured structural 
response to that of a typical undamaged or healthy structure, 
it is necessary to collect a library of response samples 
corresponding to a healthy state [10, 12-13, 22].  This paper 
presents longitudinal strain data gathered from a 2.3 MW 
commercial horizontal axis wind turbine tower in order to 
further facilitate the characterization of a healthy wind 
turbine tower response to changes in the nacelle’s yaw

Figure 2:Area moment of inertia of the wind turbine tower as a 
function of the tower height 
 
positioning.  The turbine was subjected to manually forced 
yawing of the nacelle during low wind conditions.  The data 
was measured by a Fiber Bragg Grating strain sensor array 
with the ability to detect both static and dynamic tower 
response.  The strain data is presented as a function of yaw 
angle and is potentially useful as a healthy baseline as a wind 
turbine with active yaw control is constantly changing its 
yaw angle in order to be facing the wind.  Future possible 
applications of the sensor array are subsequently discussed.  
 
II. 
INSTRUMENTATION 
The wind turbine tower studied is 78.54 m tall. It was 
designed for wind gusts of 59.5 m/s with 18% turbulence.  It 
is comprised of three individual steel sections that are bolted 
together, the geometry of the sections varies throughout the 
height of the tower.  The bottom section is 15660mm tall 
with a constant outside diameter of 4200mm and wall 
thicknesses varies from 41mm to 25mm; the middle section 
of the tower is 26880mm tall with a constant outside 
diameter of 4200mm and varying wall thicknesses of 24mm 
to 14mm; the top section of the tower is 36000mm tall with 
an outside diameter that varies linearly from 4200mm at the 
base of the section to 2392mm at the top and wall 
thicknesses varying from 13mm to 22mm.  The tower 
geometry is such that the area moment of inertia decreases as 
the height of the tower increases, the moment of inertia of 
the tower with respect to its height is shown in Figure 2. The 
large moment of inertia at the base is required to counteract 
the large bending moment induced at the fixed foundation by 
the wind design loads [3].  The studied tower was also 
recently subjected to a comprehensive structural inspection 
and was determined to be in good condition. 
The tower was outfitted with a Fiber Bragg Grating 
(FBG) sensor array. An FBG array was chosen over a 
traditional foil gauge set up for a number of reasons 
including 
but 
not 
limited 
to; 
their 
immunity 
to 
electromagnetic interference that may be present during 
regular operation of the wind turbine [11, 23]. Their 
corrosion resistance and long service life contributes to their 
ability to operate for extended periods of time in a variety of 
harsh conditions such as those experienced by offshore wind 
turbines in the North Atlantic [6, 11, 23].  Their non 
conductive nature [23] was of particular importance for this 
installation given turbine susceptibility to lightning strikes; a 
2002 report published by the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory found that up to 8% of wind turbines could be 
expected to experience a lightning strike each year [24].  
Strain gauges also have an advantage in measuring static 
deformations that occur over a long period of time that may 
otherwise be missed by accelerometers, and are still capable 
of tracking dynamic responses [6, 9, 11, 23]. 
The FBG array consisted of two os7100 three 
dimensional accelerometers, 12 os4100 temperature sensors 
and 24 longitudinally mounted os3100 strain gauges with a 
strain sensitivity of 1.4 pm/µε, feeding into a sm130 optical 
sensing interrogator all manufactured by Micron Optics.  The 
strain gauges, and temperature gauges were affixed to the 
interior of the circular tower by means of an epoxy adhesive 
at six different heights above the foundation along the 
tower’s vertical axis, shown in Table 1.  The vertical location 
of each of the strain gauge rings were chosen for practical 
installation with respect to the safety

landings located throughout the tower.  At each level four 
strain gauges and two temperature gauges were positioned as 
depicted by Figure 3, with one strain gauge and one 
temperature sensor at both the 12 o’clock and 6 o’clock 
position, along with two strain gauges located at the 3 and 9 
o’clock positions of the tower respectively.  The 12’oclock 
position corresponds to the true north face of the tower.  One 
accelerometer was placed at level 5 and another was placed 
at level 3.   
 
As a broadband light source is transmitted through fiber 
optic cables attached to each strain and temperature gauge, 
each gauge reflects its own distinct wavelength of light 
known as the Bragg wavelength λB, given by equation 1 
below;

where n is the effective core index of refraction and Λ the 
grating period [25].  When a Bragg grating is strained, the 
grating period shifts, the wavelength strain relationship for a 
FBG strain gauge is given by Equation 2 below 
 
 
(2) 
 
where ε is the mechanically induced strain, Δλ is the shift in 
measured wavelength, λo is the initial reference wavelength 
and FG is a gauge factor which is a property associated with a 
particular strain gauge that relates the strain measured to the 
shift in reflected wavelength.  It should be noted that the 
strain gauges are self-referencing.  Thus, the strain measured 
is the change in strain with respect to the original strain 
reading at the beginning of each experimental recording.  
III. 
EXPERIMENTS  
In order to determine a baseline of the relationship 
between the directional orientations of the nacelle (yaw 
position) and the strain in the tower at the various strain 
gauge locations, an experiment was performed on three 
separate occasions when the wind farm was experiencing 
periods of low wind, when the wind speeds were lower than 
the turbines cut-in wind speed of 3 m/s.  Low wind periods 
were chosen for two reasons.  First, as the test machine is 
part of a commercial wind farm, parking a power producing 
turbine during high yield winds represents financial loss.  
The second reason was to minimize the proportion of strain 
response that could be attributed to the wind load.  The 
average wind speeds for each individual experiment are 
given in Table 2.

Each experiment consisted of manually yawing the 
nacelle, using the tower’s handheld control module, for three 
full 360 degree rotations; each rotation took 800 seconds to 
complete and was performed in the opposite direction of the 
previous rotations.  The opposing rotation directions were 
necessary due to the limit of the number of rotations the 
nacelle can complete in one direction without twisting the 
cables past their maximum limit.  Operational constraints 
built into the tower’s control software also required for the 
rotor brake to be disengaged while the nacelle was put 
through the rotations.  The blades, however, were pitched 
into a full aerodynamic brake position to ensure minimal 
rotor motion during the tests. 
Strain information was collected via a PC located at the 
first safety landing platform inside the tower, running 
Micron Optics’ EN-Light data acquisition software.  The 
sampling rate for the Fiber Braggs Grating array was 100 Hz.  
The general turbine parameters were recorded on a separate 
PC located at the wind farm’s operations office by means of 
an SQL script with a data sampling rate of 0.2 Hz.  The 
parameters recorded from the turbine were: nacelle yaw 
position, wind speed, rotor speed, power production and 
blade pitch.  Before the tests, the two data acquisition 
systems were set to collect data synchronously with a 
common timestamp. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
The resulting strain-yaw position relationships clearly 
demonstrate the effect of the eccentric load transferred to the 
turbines’ supporting tower induced by the front-heavy 
nacelle.    This is revealed through inspection of the strain-
yaw relationship of any strain gauge in the tower.  Figure 4 is 
representative of a typical nacelle rotation and shows the 
strain-yaw angle relationship of a strain gauge located at a 
height of 65.02m above the foundation, situated at the 6:00 
position of the tower.  As the rotor passes over the gauge 
(yaw angle of 180 degrees), the tower wall experiences an 
increase in compressive strain.  Similarly, an equivalent 
tensile strain is experienced when the nacelle is oriented 
above the opposite side of the tower (yaw angle of 0 
degrees), resulting in a predictable sinusoidal pattern in the 
strain-yaw relationship. Every grouping of strain gauges at 
each measured tower level between level 0 and level 4 
inclusive show a similar sinusoidal response pattern. The 
difference in strain magnitude from peak to peak for each 
gauge location shows good agreement with its neighboring 
gauges as shown in Figure 5.  The constancy of the strain 
response at each level indicates that all strain gauges are 
functioning properly.  The strain peaks for each strain gauge 
along the rotation of the nacelle occur predictably at a ¼ 
rotation from the previous peak at 0, 90, 180 and 270 
degrees.  For the result illustrated here, the nacelle rotated in 
the counter clockwise direction starting from a yaw position 
of 194 degrees.  The duration of the rotation was 13 minutes 
and 10 seconds and the mean wind speeds observed at 
nacelle mounted anemometer was 2.5 m/s. 
 In order to represent the effect of the tower geometry on the 
magnitude of strain response induced by the eccentric load at 
the nacelle, we consider all of the strain gauges positioned on 
the same face of the tower, e.g., the 6 o’clock position as per 
Figure 6 below.  The tower is constructed such that as the 
height of the tower increases, the area moment of inertia of 
the tower decreases.  Equation (3) represents the contribution 
of an eccentric load to the strain induced in a column, where;  
M is the internal moment induced by the loading eccentricity 
on the column, y is the distance of the point of interrogation 
from the neutral axis of the column, E is the elastic modulus 
of the material, and I the moment of inertia of the column.  
Equation 3 indicates that the strain in the tower is inversely 
proportional to the area moment of inertia of the tower.  This 
is responsible for the large differences in strain measured 
along the tower’s height as demonstrated in Figure 6.  The 
cross correlation coefficients between every strain gauge 
along the vertical lines for the bottom 5 interrogated levels of 
the turbine tower was calculated to range between 0.83 and 
0.98, showing good correlation throughout the strain array.  
This strong and consistent inter-sensor correlation may be 
applicable to detecting damages within the tower structure by 
means of a correlation-based damage identification method 
like that described by Gul [22].

The difference in strain at 77.34m above the foundation, or 
the very top ring of strain gauges on level 5, presented in 
Figure 7, did not behave similarly to all of the other rings 
below it; rather, each show a large area of peak compression 
within a yaw range of 90 degrees to the left and right of the 
nacelle current position.  It has been theorized that this was a 
result of the close proximity of the strain gauges to the 
nacelle load bearing surface, and the possibility of an 
imperfectly distributed load over the connecting flange 
transferring a quasi-point load to the left and right of the 
turbine rotor.  
Since yawing events occur constantly throughout turbine 
operation, the data sets collected and presented can 
potentially serve as a baseline to which a future SHM 
program could compare monitored responses.  The strong 
and consistent inter-sensor correlation may be applicable 
detecting damages within the tower structure by means of 
correlation based damage identification methods [22].  This 
set of raw data will be further analyzed in order to identify 
healthy dynamic response natural frequencies, modal 
damping, and mode shapes that can be applied to vibration 
based SHM schemes. 
V. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK  
The structure and instrumentation of a 2.3 MW horizontal 
axis wind turbine tower using an FBG strain array was 
described.  Three separate experiments held on three 
different low wind days, investigated the strain response of 
the supporting tower induced by yawing the nacelle a full 
360 degrees. The following can be concluded from the 
results presented: 
• 
It was identified that the nacelle yaw position-strain 
relationship demonstrated the presence of an 
eccentric load transferred to the tower from the 
nacelle. 
• 
There is the presence of a strong cross correlation 
between each of the individual responses from the 
bottom 5 strain gauges oriented along the same 
vertical line.  This correlation could be used as the 
baseline tower behavior for a correlation-based 
damage identification method. 
• 
There was a consistent and recurring anomaly in the 
strain response of the 4 individual strain gauges 
located at the top level of the tower.  It is theorized 
that the anomaly is a result of stress concentrations 
at the tower-nacelle interface due to an unequally 
distributed load. 
Moving forward with the results and capabilities of the 
configured system; the following is being considered: A 
characterization of the structural response of the tower to 
different types of rotor braking events.  The potential for 
accelerated fatigue damage promoted through soft, hard, and 
emergency stops will be studied.  Another future work will 
be focused on the correlation of the tower response due to 
operational loading measured by means of the SCADA 
system, a meteorological tower in close proximity to the 
tower as well as a nacelle mounted LIDAR unit.  Finally the 
system will continually contribute to the development of a
