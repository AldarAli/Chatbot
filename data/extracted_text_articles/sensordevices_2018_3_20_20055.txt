waveguides, which can be used as evanescent field sensors for 
the quantitative analysis of various gases and liquids. 
Waveguides were fabricated and experimentally characterized.

fine-tuning of the optical material parameters and provides 
important input for future sensor design. The concept was 
validated with quantitative CO2 measurements.

 INTRODUCTION 
Interest for integrated gas sensors, which could be used 
in mobile devices has grown over the last years and provides 
the motivation for investigating Si-based photonics in the 
mid-infrared spectral range [1]. One approach uses 
waveguide 
structures 
and 
evanescent 
field 
infrared 
absorption as the sensor principle [2]. The measurement 
principle is shown in Figure 1. Mid-Infrared radiation from a 
quantum cascade laser is guided to the structure via an 
optical fiber. Diffraction gratings and taper structures on 
both ends of the waveguide are used for coupling the light 
into and out of the waveguide. Part of the waveguide is in 
contact with the sample-gas and there absorption occurs in 
the evanescent field of the transmitted mode. 
The 
devised 
active 
structures 
are 
silicon 
strip 
waveguides, which are in contact with the gas, so that the 
evanescent field gets absorbed. For a good understanding 
and further optimization of the sensor performance, a 
thorough characterization of these photonic structures is 
crucial. Here, we present results from simulation and 
experiments, where we characterized damping, mode 
profiles, and coupling. Comparison of simulation and 
experimental results also allows a fine-tuning of the 
simulation parameters, which is important for further 
optimization. Finally, our first measurements with CO2 
demonstrate the feasibility of gas measurements with this 
type of evanescent field sensors. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes experimental procedures and the fabrication of the 
structures. Section III presents and discusses the first results 
we obtained and Section IV summarizes our work and 
presents first conclusions from this work in progress.

EXPERIMENTAL 
The devised sensor test structures are silicon strip 
waveguides on a silicon nitride-layer, deposited on SiO2, 
which can be fabricated with standard semiconductor pro-
cesses to provide a fully integrated CMOS (Complementary 
metal-oxide-semiconductor) compatible sensor.  
Simulations where carried out using COMSOL-
Multiphysics in order to determine favorable dimensions of 
the waveguide and the grating coupler. The waveguides were

designed for the absorption band of CO2 at 4.26 µm. The 
dimensions of the waveguide were chosen for single-mode 
wave propagation. The calculated mode profiles for a strip 
waveguide on a silicon nitride membrane are shown in 
Figure 2. The influence of different Si3N4 layer thicknesses 
on damping and mode profiles was investigated. The width 
and height of the waveguides are 1.4 µm and 660 nm, 
respectively. 
There are large uncertainties, with regard to the optical 
parameters, because the optical properties of the thin layers 
of poly-Si and Si3N4 strongly depend on the details of the 
deposition method. For experimental characterization of the 
mode properties, directional couplers were designed and 
fabricated, which are very sensitive to the exact shape of the 
mode. A direct comparison between experiments and 
simulation allows fine-tuning the optical parameters for the 
simulation. The basic outline of these structures is shown in 
Figure 3. A grating launch-pad with a subsequent taper 
structure is used to couple light in and out. Light is coupled 
in at port 1 and detectors are placed at port 2 (“through-
port”) and 3 (“drop-port”). For the structures measured in 
this paper, the gap between the waveguides was 400nm. 
Measurements on structures with different interaction 
lengths allow quantitative comparison of the experimental 
results with the simulation.  
Details of the fabrication process can be found in [3]. In 
short, the structures were manufactured using low pressure 
chemical vapor deposition, lithography and etching. A 2 µm 
thick SiOx layer and subsequently a Si3N4 layer of some 
nanometers were deposited onto a silicon substrate. On top 
of the Si3N4 an amorphous silicon layer was deposited which 
was annealed at 700 C° to achieve a polycrystalline silicon 
layer. Finally, the waveguide structures, as well as the 
gratings, where etched into the polycrystalline silicon layer.  
The waveguide characterization, as well as the gas 
measurements, was carried out using a custom test-bench, 
described in detail in [4]. In short, it comprises a Quantum 
Cascade Laser (QCL) as radiation source, optical fibers, a

stage for placing the test chips, and mercury cadmium 
telluride (MCT) detectors. The beam was guided from the 
laser to the device and from the device to the detector via 
optical fibers with core diameters of 100 µm and 450µm, 
respectively.  
While the characterization of the intrinsic losses was 
carried out on wafer-level, the gas measurements were 
carried out on single chips. The single test chips were placed 
in a 3D printed gas cell, which comprised a gas inlet and a 
holder for the test chip. The top of the cell provided openings 
for the optical fibers, which also served as outlet for the gas. 
During the gas measurements the cell was flushed with 
CO2/N2 mixtures at a total flow rate of 100 ml/min using two 
mass flow controllers. 
All characterization measurements were performed at 
2400 cm-1
, which is just outside the CO2 absorption band in 
order to avoid an influence of the ambient CO2 
concentration. For the absorption measurements, the laser 
was tuned to a position within the CO2 band at about 
2363 cm-1, where maximal absorption was observed.

RESULTS 
Figure 4 shows pictures from scanning electron 
microscopy validating the fabrication quality. The surface 
roughness of the Si structures and the Si3N4 layer, as well as 
the topography of the strip waveguides were also 
investigated using atomic force microscopy, which revealed 
that the surface roughness is about 1 nm at measurement 
positions (on the top of the Si layer as well as on the SiO2 
and the Si3N4 layer). 
To measure the intrinsic losses, the transmitted IR 
radiation was measured on four waveguides with different 
lengths (5.0 mm, 7.5 mm, 10.0 mm and 12.5 mm), for each 
configuration of Si3N4 layer thickness (0nm, 140nm and 
280nm). For every thickness, the transmitted intensity 
through the four waveguides was recorded, which allows to 
calculate the intrinsic damping, without contributions from 
losses at the coupling structures and the taper [5]. The 
damping increases with increasing Si3N4 thickness and is on 
the order of 4-5 dB/cm. 
Most importantly, we performed measurements on 
directional couplers. These results are very sensitive to the 
exact shape of the mode and allow a direct comparison 
between experiments and simulation. Besides academic 
interest, this is important because it allows fine-tuning of the 
optical parameters for the simulation, and, in addition, such 
coupling structures will be important building blocks for 
more complex sensor designs. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show 
the simulation results for two different thicknesses of the 
Si3N4 layer. From this, we estimated the coupling length for 
maximal energy transfer between the waveguides to be 
110µm and 95µm for thicknesses of the Si3N4-layer of 140 
nm and 280 nm, respectively. Figure 5(c) shows the 
calculated dependence of the coupling length as a function of 
layer thickness. Based on these simulations, test-structures 
with interaction lengths of 70, 110, and 150 µm were 
designed and fabricated. In the experiments, we found a 
mismatch of about 20% with regard to the initial estimates. 
However, fine-tuning of the optical parameters by some 
percent provides excellent overlap between experiment and 
simulation. This is shown in Figure 6. Here, the curves show 
the simulated relative intensities at the through-port and the 
drop-port as a function of propagation length for three 
different layer-thicknesses of Si3N4. The markers show the 
experimental results measured on structures with interaction 
lengths of 70, 110, and 150 µm and different thickness of the 
Si3N4 layer. The values for the refractive indices of Si and 
Si3N4 used in the simulations were nSi=3.525 and nSi3N4=1.92 
respectively. 
Finally, in order to test the sensing capability of the strip 
waveguide, quantitative CO2 measurements were conducted 
using a strip waveguide in the form of a meander with a 
length of 2 cm. The QCL was tuned to a wavelength where 
we observed maximal CO2 absorption. The position of the 
fibers for in- and out-coupling was adjusted in order to 
optimize the coupling and achieve a high signal at the 
detector. The sensor chip was placed in a gas cell, which was 
flushed using mixtures of N2/CO2 of different concentrations. 
Free-beam absorption, which occurs between the fibers and

the waveguide was characterized with a reference 
measurement and compensated for. In these measurements 
[5], it was possible to sense CO2 concentrations down to 500 
ppm, which is already in the range of the typical workplace 
CO2 concentrations and well below the exposure limits.  
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
We presented a detailed design and characterization of 
silicon strip waveguides. Among others, our results indicate 
that the index of refraction of the deposited poly-silicon is 
about 3% higher in our structures, compared to literature 
values of bulk silicon. The waveguides feature damping 
characteristics of 4-5 dB/cm, depending on the details of the 
layer structure and can be used for CO2 monitoring, which 
was demonstrated with actual measurements. Based on these 
results, we will proceed in designing and optimizing the next 
generation of waveguide structures for evanescent field 
sensing.
