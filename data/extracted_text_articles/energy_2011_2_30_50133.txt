Abstract—Efﬁcient generation and distribution are crucial for
economic power production. In this paper we discuss the planning
and design of upgrading a medium size enterprise power system
by installing Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), with partic-
ular emphasis on economic viability and environmental beneﬁts.
The planning for this project considers both conventional grid
and SmartGrid connections. Project planning, installation chal-
lenges and governmental support of renewable energy projects
in Australia are discussed. It is found that upgrading a medium
size enterprise power system with DERs can yield reasonable
levels of energy cost savings and greenhouse gas mitigation with
both conventional grid and SmartGrid connections, but that
SmartGrid connection can deliver better outcomes.
Index Terms—medium size enterprise power systems, solar
and wind energies integration with smartgrid, economic and
environmental analyses of energy projects
I. INTRODUCTION
Concerns over catastrophic climate change, increased indus-
trialisation, CO2 emissions and fuel price rises are creating
incentives for reliable, safe and environment-friendly energy
sources. To help achieve a clean and secure electric power
industry, the current power grid has been modernised to accept
a range of renewable energy sources [1]. These are expected
to become more competitive with conventional generators.
As a part of the international trend towards restructuring
electricity grids, many developed countries are establishing
new investment support policies. They are also developing
legislation for commercializing “Green Energy”. As new
clean-energy markets have been emerging around the world,
opportunities exist for economic development, jobs creation
and energy diversiﬁcation beneﬁts [2]. Thus, there is a need to
develop efﬁcient clean-energy regulations to direct companies,
so that socio-economic beneﬁts are maximised [3]. Regulators
are initiating new programs for energy efﬁciency, renewable
energy capacity generation, and reliability improvements [4].
Liberalizing power markets will also become more important
because of the advantages of pooling large generation stations,
sharing spinning reserves and using the most efﬁcient energy
resources [5].
The Australian Government has initiated major funding
support plans to promote commercialization of renewable
energy [6]. Australia is considered one of the most favourable
nations for investment in energy resource development because
of low political and regulatory risks [7]. Foreign investment
is welcomed by the Australian Government and no mandatory
local equity or local content requirements are imposed on en-
ergy resources development [8]. The Ofﬁce of the Renewable
Energy Regulator (ORER) in Australia administers the Renew-
able Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (the Act), the Renewable
Energy (Electricity) Charge Act 2000, the Renewable Energy
(Electricity) (Small-scale Technology Shortfall Charge) Act
2010 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001
(the regulations) to increase renewable electricity generation
from Australia’s renewable energy sources by encouraging
the generation of an additional 45,000 GWh of renewable
energy per year by 2020 [9]. The Australian Government has
established the Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme to
ensure that 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity supply will
come from renewable sources by 2020. The plan is to make
the amount of energy coming from sources like solar, wind,
wave and geothermal sources be around the same as all of
Australia’s current household electricity use [10].
The Australian Government has assisted consumers with the
cost of installing solar panels on Australian homes and con-
necting them to the utility grid for energy commercialisation
purposes (SmartGrid) [6]. Although photovoltaic cells are
still too expensive to compete effectively with the conven-
tional power generators, the solar-cell market in Australia is
expanding rapidly. Australia has a long history of using wind
power for pumping water, and now it is been used widely
for renewable power generation. Solar and wind systems are
appropriate in Australia because of environmental concerns
with conventional energy generation, usually based on burning
coal, and a reluctance to adopt nuclear power or build more
hydro electricity dams [11]. Solar and wind energies are
popular because they are widely distributed, climate-benign,
and have clean-attributes that no other major energy source can
currently match. This paper is investigating the economic and
environmental impacts of integrating solar and wind energies
to upgrade medium size enterprise power systems for current
grid and smartgrid connections.

II. GOVERNMENT SCHEMES FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION
AND PROMOTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE UPTAKE
The Australian Government has taken on responsibility for
reducing the carbon pollution in all its states and territories.
Its main target is reducing Australian’s carbon footprint by
nearly one third to one half. They have also started to develop
new policies and rules which are needed to help Australian
businesses and households to reduce their carbon pollution
[12].
A. Emissions reduction and investing in clean energies
Given that Australia has a very large ecological footprint,
which is dominated by carbon dioxide emissions from fossil
funds, it is appropriate that Australia to be very active in
responding to climate change. This indicates major research
and initiative project funding for energy balance and emissions
reduction, for example the Low Emission Technology Demon-
stration Fund (LETDF) to support the Australian ﬁrms to com-
mercialize low emissions technologies [13]. Carbon Pollution
Reduction Scheme (CPRS) would introduce a price on carbon
pollution and ensure that all businesses take this into account
when they developing their business plan. Concurrently, the
Australian Government is developing, commercialising, and
investing on clean energy technologies [12]. These will be
crucial for Australia’s efforts to reduce its carbon pollution
emissions. These technologies will also be important to the rest
of the world as they also need to reduce their carbon pollution.
Australia’s RET goal will be met from renewable sources such
as wind, solar and geothermal power by 2020. The Initiative
will create more jobs in clean industries by giving investors
the conﬁdence to back low emissions technologies such as
solar power, energy from ‘hot rocks’ in the earth’s crust, and
carbon capture and storage.
B. SmartGrid in Australia
In the state of New South Wales, the city of Newcastle
is currently starting the ﬁrst commercial-scale SmartGrid
project. The governmental initiatives for such projects will
help Australians save energy, commercialize renewable energy
grid connection and tackle climate change. The aim is to
optimise energy participation from local generation to the
public grid. SmartGrid will involve soft computing and
distributed control systems implementation to perform de-
mand prediction, smart renewable energy participation and
distribution generation management. New market schemes and
economic energy generation can be performed from applying
smart infrastructure on the energy grid. It is a substantial
foundation for developing smart energy markets, and it allows
public, private and business sectors to interconnect the small
scale, on-site generators e.g., diesel and renewable energy
resources, to participate in these markets.
III. PLANNING FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
A main problem for project development is the availability
of installation space. A sufﬁcient share for renewable energy
supply requires a high number of generation units located
Figure 1.
Project developement planning ﬂowchart
within new or existing facilities or at more remote installation
sites. There is still an alternative solution for solving instal-
lation space problem, which is increasing utility grid share
in such a way, it ﬁts with utilizing all the available space
in the project land, then supplying the rest from utility grid.
SmartGrid connection is another planning consideration.
Since SmartGrid is a foundation for commercializing energy
suppliers, it will be a key solution for solving the installation
space problem. SmartGrid will allow the private sector
to feed energy into the public grid. The energy consumers
will be able to get the energy back from the SmartGrid
from different substations in different locations covered by
SmartGrid connection. Selling and buying energy to and
from the grid from different locations will add other expenses,
which will be economically analysed and added to the project
cost as it is explained in the Economic Analyses section in
this paper. Figure 1shows the proposed planning strategy for
adding renewable energy sources to an existing microgrid.

IV. A CASE STUDY
As a case study, ECU’s Microgrid at its Joondalup campus
was selected for project development planning. The average
climate from minimum to maximum values and safety consid-
erations are considered in the studies. The city of Joondalup is
located in one of the worlds ﬁve Mediterranean climate zones.
The geographical information for this city:
Country: Australia
State: Western Australia
City: Joondalup
Latitude: 31.44 °S
Longitude: 115.45 °E
Elevation / Altitude: 25 m
Average solar irradiation: 5.35 kWh/m²/day
Average wind speed: 12.24 km/h
The above details are helpful in detailing the installation
challenges and solutions with solar panels and wind turbines.
For maximum output, solar-electric (photovoltaic; PV) mod-
ules or solar thermal collectors need to be located where they
receive the most sunshine. Ideally, hills, trees, buildings, or
other obstructions should not shade a system site at any time
during the year, so identifying the best place is complex.
Based on the university’s energy demand readings, the
highest amount of demand per hour occurs on summer’s
afternoons, reaching 1704 kWh, while the lowest energy
occurs on winter nights or holidays, (284 kWh). To cover the
demand in the university, a speciﬁc number of solar panels and
wind turbines are needed. As the highest demands are always
during the day time, more emphasis would be placed on solar
panels rather than wind turbines.
A. Solar panel installation
According to the provided information about the climate in
the city of Joondalup and generation efﬁciency of different
brands of solar panel, generation outcomes were estimated.
For best generation outcomes, the installation angles of the
solar panel have to be adjusted according to the location of
the project, and the angle of the sun during winter and summer
seasons. To optimize the installation of solar panel in the city
of Joondalup, the angle is adjusted to 23o, facing north, (Fig
2).
From the installation and sun angle challenges, the average
lost generation for solar panel was estimated to be about 10%
of the overall annual generation capacity. For the selected solar
panel unit, the average daily solar panel output is estimated at
936 Wh, while the monthly average of minimum and maxi-
mum daily solar panel output is 439 and 1447 Wh respectively.
The average annual solar panel output is 341 kWh. For 25
years, the total solar panel output will be about 8.525 MWh.
Based on these calculations, this unit is considered appropriate
for ECU’s microgrid energy supply.
B. Wind turbine installation
In wind energy, useful energy contribution (work) is cal-
culated by summing the amount of generated power over
Figure 2.
Summer, Winter and Optimal Angles for Solar Panel Installation
Figure 3.
Average Monthly Wind Speed in the City of Perth
time taking into account variation in wind and operational
conditions. The relationship between the size of the wind
turbine and the generation outcomes may vary depending on
the threshold point for wind speed and the amount of available
wind speed annually. From the climate study results, it has
been shown that wind speed drops to zero regularly from
midnight till sunrise. The average wind speed is 12.24 km/h
while minimum and maximum (monthly average) wind speeds
are 9.36 km/h and 15.84 km/h respectively. The minimum
wind speed to activate generation in the nominated unit is
9 km/h. For a secure power supply design, utility supply
will cover the missing hours of generation availability for
solar panels and wind turbines. The wind speed readings were
collected from City of Perth station, which is located about
20 km south from the project location.
As a conservative estimation, the average monthly 9 am
wind speed for the city of Perth since 1993 is illustrated in
Fig. 3.
From the climate study, the safe estimated average of

missing wind generation hours varied between 20 hours in
winter season and zero hours per day in summer season.
For wind turbine, the technical layout and design of wind
park installations are important. When installing several wind
turbine concentrated in an array, the major challenge which
arises is the spacing. The relationship between rotor distance
and aerodynamic array efﬁciency is illustrated in Figure 4.
A minimum clearance between the wind turbines must be
guaranteed, otherwise power losses will be so high that the
wind park will operate uneconomically.
This inﬂuences the required space needed for this project
at Joondalup, where space can be limiting. However, for the
SmartGrid connection, an off-campus location is used and
land cost becomes a factor.
V. ECONOMIC ANALYSES
Economic analyses for installing DERs for this project were
conducted for conventional grid and SmartGrid connections.
A. Conventional grid connection
For this project, a satellite image for the project’s land has
been added to identify available installation space. For this
project, it has been found that the available installation space
for the wind turbine is 17000 m² as shown in Figure 5. Adding
to that, sufﬁcient installation space has been allocated for solar
panel installation.
From the climate study, and the characteristics of the project
land, it has been estimated that solar panels and wind turbines
can share the supply of 37% of the full electricity demand
in the university. The 37% generation is set to be 85% from
solar panels and 15% for wind turbines. Figure 6 is showing
the assigned energy supply shares of the installed DERs.
From the current 2,000 kWh maximum daily demand, and
the assigned 85% of the solar panel participation in the 37%
share of DERs supply to the project, 735 kWh is required
to be generated from solar panels. This can be obtained by
Figure 5.
Satellite Image for the project plan

Proposed energy supply shares for ECU power system for the

installing 3964 units of the in-market selected units “Sharp
NUS5E3E 185 W mono”. Each single unit required 1318 x 994
x 46 mm for installation space. Thus, for the needed number
of solar panels, 5193.2 m² is required. For Wind turbine,
the nominated generation unit is “WinPower 48V DC/240V
2000Watt”, which has a 4 m rotor diameter. The required
installation space is 300 m² for each wind turbine, allowing
for the 56 wind turbines for this project. So, for both solar
panel and wind turbine installation area, about 21,193 m² will
meet the required installation space.
Other calculation assumptions for the missing generation
hours due to clouds and low speed wind have to be considered
under generation capacity for the installed renewable energy
sources. The average calculated missing hours of generation
are summarised in Table I.
These have to be compensated by utility grid supply and
Tables II and III show the amount of non operating hours
and the energy compensation needed from the utility grid

under conventional grid connection. The average total daily
utility compensation is 3,125 kW. Since the total annual energy
consumption is 6,082,854 kW, the average daily consumption
is about 16,666 kWh. Thus, the average daily utility compen-
sation for the non-operating hours is 18.1% adding to that the
actual 63% utility supply for the university. Then, the actual
utility for the project will be 81.5% and the renewable energy
participation will be 19% of the total needed generation. Table
IV shows the details of the missing operation hours of the
installed solar panels and wind turbines.
Additional weather studies have been applied to show the
generation outcomes and the amount of non-operating hours

energy sources under conventional grid connection.

CONVENTIONAL GRID CONNECTION RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES
INSTALLATION COST[14]
For solar panel, the estimated generation price for 25
years from this unit was found to be between 0.0288-0.0354
$/kWH according to “SharpNUS5E3E185Wmono”. For
wind turbine, the equivalent is about 0.07$/kWh generation
price over 25 years. The utility energy prices may increase for
the next 3 years by 10% and may increase by another 90% by
the next 25 years. The estimated cost that ECU is currently
paying is about $2,140,594 a year. Thus, for the next 25 years
with energy price increment, it is expected that ECU is willing
to pay about $80,272,000 over 25 years if all assumptions are
realised. For these calculations, load expansion will not be
considered for generation capacity installation.
From the calculations of the renewable energy generation
shares, it is expected that ECU will have to pay $65,020,000
in the next 25 years. Figure 8 shows the proposed generation
shares of the renewable energy sources and utility grid supply
for the proposed project.
Thus, the total generated energy by solar panels and wind
turbines for this project will cost $7,612,244 for the next 25
years. The total cost savings will be $7,639,494. Table V
details the estimated cost of installing and operating the DERs
for the investigated project.
Note that, capital costs include the modules costs, while the

operating costs include converters, installation, maintenance,
engineering consultation and insurance costs. Investigating
the ﬁnancial support from the ﬁnance sectors, the Australian
Government promotes funding one third of the project budget,
which will save about $2,537,414. The current loan rates are
7.1% for ﬁxed annual interest. For the speciﬁed project, that
all funding is borrowed except for Australian Government
funding support, ECU will need to invest about $5,074,828 on
this project. To refund this amount after 25 years, it required
to pay extra $5,762,724 according to current Australian banks
loan rates. Figure 11
From the above calculations , it has been conducted that:
from the economic analyses point of view, this project will
save about $4,414,189 including the $2,537,414 of Australian
Government support. These calculations were to evaluate the
investment values in 25 years time in case of loan funded
scenario. In case of self funded scenario, the project will
save about $10,176,910 including the Australian Government
funding support, ignoring the opportunity costs for other uses
of ECU funds.
B. SmartGrid connection
Future SmartGrid will have fair solutions for installation
area problems. For this case study, this project can be im-
plemented on a remote area covered by SmartGrid power
lines. SmartGrid will allow private sectors to feed-in the
energy to the public grid. The energy consumers will be able to
have the energy back from the grid to supply their loads from
wherever it is covered by SmartGrid. The difference in prices
for selling and buying to and from the grid from different
locations will be added to the project cost. Since installation
space problem can be solved by SmartGrid, the full capacity
generation will be supplied by renewable energy sources for
the speciﬁed project rather than having a nett reliance on the
utility grid supply. Thus, it is assigned to have the 2,000kWh
from the renewable energy sources (70% for solar panel and
30% for wind turbine).
Due to missing operation hours of the renewable energy
sources as shown in table I, utility grid compensation is
considered under economic analyses to compensate for the
missing operation hours. From the current 2,000 kWh max-
imum daily demand and the 70% solar panel with 30% of
wind turbine generation share, it is required to install 7568
units of the above nominated solar panel type and 300 units
of the nominated wind turbine type (Figure 9).
Table VIillustrates the renewable energy source installation
costs for the SmartGrid connection case.
Figure 10 shows the proposed energy supply shares and the
non operating hours for the assigned renewable energy sources.
Figure 9.
The distribution of generation shares for utility and renewable
sources under SmartGrid connection
Figure 10. Energy supply shares for the proposed project under SmartGrid
connection
Table VII and VIII show the non operating hours details
and the amount of energy to be compensated from the utility
grid for SmartGrid connection case. From tables VII and
VIII it has been estimated that the estimated utility grid
compensation for the missing operating hours of renewable
energy sources is about: 7728 kW per day (24 hours). The
utility compensation price for the 25 years is expected to be:
$21,155,400. Thus, price difference of selling and buying to
and from the grid, may cost an extra $11,085,962. The needed
installation space for this project may cost $7, 500, 000 as
well assuming that this location will have the same climate
characteristics as those estimated for Joondalup, according to
current Australian land prices. The total project cost may reach
to $64,518,551 including the Australian Government support
in case of fully loaned project. Thus, the project may save up to
$15,753,751 in case of fully loan funded project, while it may
save up to $32,277,190 including the Australian Government
support a self funded project, ignoring the opportunity for cost
associated with alternative uses of ECU’s funds.

VI. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSES
Solar panels are generating power with no noise and very
low rate of emissions including those involved in manu-
facturing, transporting and installing the panels. The main
environmental effects caused by wind turbine generation are:
audible sound, infrasonic sound, disco effect, shadow impact,
ice throw, visual interference with natural scenery, harm to
bird-life, effects on other fauna, space consumption, offshore
utilisation and social acceptance [15]. However, photovoltaic
power plants emit 110 kg (243 lb) CO2/MWh, while wind
turbine plants are emitting 17 kg (37.5 lb) CO2/MWh. By
comparison: modern gas and steam turbine power plants emit
435 kg (960 lb) CO2/MWh, while coal-ﬁred power plants
to emit 900 kg (1980 lb) CO2/MWh [15]. From this project,
tables IX and X show the amount of daily generation and CO2
mitigation by solar panels and wind turbines for conventional
grid and Smartgrid connections.
Evaluating the importance of this project for the next 25
years, it is expected that this project will save 18,957 tonnes
of CO2 emission for conventional grid connection, and 64,933
tonnes of CO2 for SmartGrid connection. This average
value is based on CO2 release from modern gas and steam
turbine and coal-ﬁred power plants. Figure 11 provides the
estimated investment beneﬁts for this project under self funded
and loan funded cases for conventional grid and SmartGrid
connection.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
Upgrading ECU’s power grid with DERs installation has
been described and costed this paper. There are great chal-
lenges in installing the estimated amount of DERs in terms
of allocating suitable installation space and investigating the
non operating hours of DERs based on the weather patterns
at the project location. Economic and environmental impacts

Investment economic and environmental beneﬁts
were investigated for this problem in this paper. The economic
analyses have shown that the project may achieve different
amount of proﬁts including the Australian Government fund
support under different connection modes: conventional grid
or SmartGrid, and may vary according to the sponsored fund
from ﬁnancial sectors. The calculations showed that for best
economic and environmental beneﬁts, it is more beneﬁcial to
implement this project with SmartGrid connection. From
these calculated results, it is noticed that it is encouraging
to invest on upgrading medium size enterprise power system
projects with these friendly conditions.
