Abstract—Online social networks are extremely popular services
on the Internet, having a relevant impact on the social, po-
litical and economical aspects of our daily lives. Being able
to characterize social network users based on their temporal
behavior and activity proﬁles can be useful to several engineering,
management and design tasks. This paper characterizes the
activity proﬁles of Facebook users, as well as their time evolution,
based on data extracted using the Facebook Graph API and
corresponding to social networking activity of 200 users during
the years of 2011 and 2012. Using multiscale analysis based on a
wavelet decomposition of the dataset, the proposed methodology
is able to identify three main periodicity trends on the activity
proﬁles: one of the identiﬁed proﬁles exhibits a visible periodicity
around the 24 hours time scale (corresponding to users that
have a daily interaction with Facebook), a second proﬁle exhibits
relevant components in the complete frequency range (intensive
interaction) and a third proﬁle includes important low periodicity
components (users that tipically use Facebook in time periods
higher than 24 hours). By looking at the temporal evolution of
the different activity proﬁles, it is also possible to understand the
dynamics of the proﬁle changes.
Keywords–Facebook users activity; user proﬁle; scalogram;

INTRODUCTION
Some Online Social Networks (OSN), such as Facebook,
Twitter or Google+, are among the most popular services
on the Internet, enabling individual users to connect to other
participating users, share and ﬁnd contents, and disseminate
information through the network, while collecting the reactions
from other users without any constraints, either geographic or
temporal. Several OSN sites provide social links, like for ex-
ample networks of professionals and contacts (e.g., LinkedIn,
Facebook, MySpace) and networks for sharing contents (e.g.,
Flickr, YouTube). People access OSNs using both traditional
personal computers and new emerging mobile devices. So,
these services are really having a deep impact on the social,
political and economical aspects of our daily lives.
The success of a social network depends on the behaviour
of its users. Characterizing users based on their temporal
behavior and activity proﬁles can be useful in many ways:
studies of user behavior will allow to evaluate the performance
of existing systems, leading to better site designs [1][2] and
advertisement placement policies [3]; social studies can exploit
models of user behavior and interaction, while viral marketers
can use those models to spread their promotions quickly and
widely [4][5]; understanding the workload of OSNs can be
very important to design the next-generation Internet infras-
tructure and content distribution systems [6]; activity proﬁles
can also be used for user classiﬁcation or detection of anoma-
lous behaviors, such as bots or compromised accounts [7].
Characterizing user activity in major OSNs is challenging
because the distribution of most user characteristics is very
skewed and shows wide variations, while the majority of
participating users have a low (to moderate) level of activity.
In this paper, we will characterize the activity proﬁles of
Facebook users, as well as their time evolution, in order
to understand how their behaviors change over time. The
periodicity trends of the activity proﬁles are identiﬁed using
multiscale analysis based on a wavelet decomposition of the
time series. In fact, it is known that one of the main purposes
of multiscaling analysis is to identify the most important
time-scales of (pseudo-periodicity) activity and quantify the
constancy of that pseudo-periodicity. The conducted study
relies on a medium size dataset, which was extracted using the
Facebook Graph API [8], containing social networking activity
of 200 users during the years of 2011 and 2012.
From the conducted analysis, we were able to identify three
types of activity proﬁles: an activity proﬁle that exhibits a
periodicity around the 24 hours time scale, a second proﬁle
that exhibits relevant components in the complete frequency
range and a proﬁle that includes important low periodicity
components. In other words, the ﬁrst group of users has an
activity periodicity roughly equal to one day; the second group
presents signiﬁcant energy components at the different time
scales, which means that these users interact intensively with
Facebook, being almost permanently active; the third group
uses Facebook in time periods that are generally higher than
one day.
By looking at the temporal evolution of the different users
behaviors, we could identify a global decrease on the number
of users corresponding to the ﬁrst proﬁle and a steady increase
on the number of users corresponding to the other two proﬁles.
This means that the number of users that typically have daily
access to Facebook is decreasing and those users tend to
behave according to second and third proﬁles. We also tracked
how users changed their proﬁles in the two years period of our
study by calculating the number of users that changed between
two speciﬁc proﬁle types: we could verify that the ﬁrst proﬁle
was actually the one who lost more users: the majority of those
users (aroud 33%) changed their proﬁles to the second type,
although around 14% of them changed their proﬁles to the
third type.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: Section
II presents some relevant related worksin this area; Section III
brieﬂy presents the multiscale analysis methodology that will
be used to identify the pseudo-periodicity characteristics of the
Facebook users’ activity, as well as a summarized description
of the k-means clustering algorithm; Section IV presents the
social network activity analysis that was conducted, together

conclusions and discusses some possible directions for future
work.

RELATED WORK
The huge amount of data generated by social media users
has been used to understand their behavior. By analyzing
workloads from three information networks, Guo et al. [9]
showed that users’ posting behavior exhibited strong daily and
weekly patterns. Benevenuto et al. [10] used click-stream data
from a social network aggregator to compare user behavior
across different OSNs. Papagelis et al. [11] investigated the
causality between individual behavior and social inﬂuence by
observing the information diffusion among users. In order to
understand how users’ news interests change over time, Liu et
al. [12] conducted a large scale analysis of Google News users
click logs that were conveniently anonymized. These authors
developed a Bayesian framework for predicting users’ current
news interests from the activities of that particular user and
the news trends demonstrated in the activity of all users.
Several works have been studying the properties of user
interactions in OSNs. Cha et al. [13] analyzed the spread of
favorite-marking of Flickr photos, showing that social links are
a primary way users ﬁnd and share information in social media.
Also in 2009, Valafar et al. [14] conducted a measurement
study on the Flickr OSN that was able to show that only a
small fraction of users in the main component of the friendship
graph is responsible for the vast majority of user interactions.
Wilson et al. [1] were able to show that interaction activity is
signiﬁcantly skewed towards a small portion of each user’s
social links by analyzing interaction graphs derived from
Facebook user traces. Also using Facebook data, Gilbert and
Karahalios [15] were able to demostrate that the ”strength of
ties” varies a lot, ranging from pairs of users who are best
friends to pairs of users who even wished they were not friends.
Viswanath et al. [16] studied the evolution of activity between
Facebook users, investigating how pairs of users in a social
network interact and examining how the varying patterns of
interaction affect the overall structure of the activity network.
In a very interesting work, Burke et al. [17] analyzed the
activities of a huge number of Facebook users in order to study
the roles of user interactions. Visible actions, such as wall
posts and comments, and silent actions, such as consumption
of friend’s content, was conveniently quantiﬁed and the authors
were able to show that a typical Facebook user communicates
with a small subset of their entire friendship network, although
it usually maintains relationships with a larger group.
Several efforts have been made to characterize and detect
malicious forms of interactions in online social networks. Gao
et al. [18] the authors were able to quantify and characterize
spam campaigns launched using accounts on online social
networks, particularly Facebook. Benevenuto et al. [19] built
a test collection of real YouTube users and classiﬁed them
as spammers, promoters and legitimates, based on social and
content attributes. Markines et al. [20] proposed a methodology
to detect spam on social bookmarking sites, while Webb et
al. [21] placed honeypot accounts on MySpace and study
the captured social spammers. Grier at al. [22] presented a
characterization of spam on Twitter, ﬁnding that this OSN
is a highly successful platform for coercing users to visit
spam pages. Vasconcelos et al. [23], authors analyzed how
Foursquare users exploit the tips, dones and to-dos features
to uncover different behavior proﬁles. This study revealed the
existence of very active and inﬂuential users that seem engaged
in posting tips at a large variety of venues while also receiving
a great amount of user feedback on them. Besides, the paper
also provided evidence of spamming, showing the existence of
users that post tips whose contents are unrelated to the nature
or domain of the venue where the tips were left. Wang et al.
[7] proposed a machine learning approach to distinguish spam
bots from normal ones in Twitter. To facilitate the spam bots
detection, three graph-based features, such as the number of
friends and the number of followers, are extracted to explore
the unique follower and friend relationships among users.
User navigation and usage on OSN websites have also
been intensively studied in the last years. Schneider et al. [24]
analyzed OSN clickstream data extracted from network trafﬁc,
identifying typical user navigation patterns; Jiang et al. [25]
used traces from a chinese social network to obtain statistics
of proﬁle visits, showing that silent interactions are much more
prevalent and frequent than visible events, and that proﬁle
popularity are uncorrelated with the frequency of content
updates. Joinson et al. [26] identiﬁed seven unique reasons
for users to use Facebook: social connection, shared identities,
content, social investigation, social network surﬁng, and status
updating. Using data from Facebook, Burke et al. [2] studied
user motivations for contributing to OSN sites. The authors
concluded that newcomers who see their friends contributing
to the OSN share more content themselves. Furthermore, those
who were initially inclined to contribute, receiving feedback
and having a wide audience, were also predictors of increased
sharing. Chapman and Lahav [27] analyzed the ethnographical
differences in the usage of OSNs. Finally, Caverlee and Webb
[28] analyzed over 1.9 million MySpace proﬁles in order to
understand who is using such large OSNs networks and how
they are being used.
III.
PSEUDO-PERIODICITY ANALYSIS
The proposed pseudo-periodicity analysis of the social network
users’ activity is based on a wavelet decomposition through the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) [29]. Let us consider
that x(t), t ∈ {t0, t0 + ∆, . . . , t0 + ∆i}, i = 1, 2, . . . quantiﬁes
the number of activities performed by a user, within a social
network, between t − ∆ and t. Using wavelet decomposition,
it is possible to analyze the social interaction process x(t) in
both time and frequency domains. The CWT of a process x(t)
can be deﬁned as [30]:
Ψψ
x (τ, s) =
1
p
|s|
Z −∞
+∞
x(t)ψ∗(t − τ
s
)dt
(1)
where ∗ denotes the complex conjugation,
1
√
|s| is used as an
energy preservation factor, ψ(t) is the mother wavelet, while
τ and s are the translation and scale parameters, respectively.
The ﬁrst parameter is used for shifting the mother wavelet
in time, while the second parameter controls the width of the
window analysis and, consequently, the frequency that is being
analyzed. By varying these parameters, a multiscale analysis
of the entire captured process can be performed, providing
a description of the different frequency components present
in the decomposed process together with the time-intervals
where each one of those components is located. A Wavelet
Scalogram can be deﬁned as the normalized energy ˆEx(τ, s)
19

over all possible translations (set T) in all analyzed scales (set
S), and is computed as:
ˆEx(τ, s) = 100
Ψψ
x (τ, s)
2
P
τ ′∈T
P
s′∈S
Ψψ
x (τ ′, s′)

2
(2)
To facilitate the analysis of the scalograms and enable the
discovery of the different frequency (periodicity) components,
we choose to average the normalized energy over time (set T)
obtaining the average energy at timescale s:
¯ex(s) =
1
|T|
X
τ∈T
ˆEx(τ, s), ∀s ∈ S
(3)
where |.| represents cardinality of a set. The existence of a
peak in the average energy at a low timescale indicates the
existence of a high-frequency (high-periodicity) component in
the analyzed time-series, while a peak in the average energy
at a high timescale corresponds to the existence of a low-
frequency (low-periodicity) component.
In order to classify the distinct users behaviors, the un-
supervised learning k-means algorithm was applied to the
average normalized energies. The k-means algorithm is one
of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that is used
to solve the clustering problem [31]. The number of clusters,
k, is ﬁxed apriori and their centers are deﬁned, one for each
cluster. These centers should be placed in a cunning way,
because different locations causes different results: the better
choice is to place them as much as possible far away from
each other. In our problem, we veriﬁed that three clusters were
enough to classify the average normalized energies because an
hypothetical forth cluster was simply a replication of one of
the other clusters.
The next step of the k-means algorithm is to take each point
belonging to a given dataset and associate it to the nearest
center. When no point is pending, the ﬁrst step is completed.
At this point, we have to re-calculate k new centroids as
barycenter of the clusters resulting from the previous step.
A new binding has to be done between the same dataset
points and the nearest new center. An iterative approach has
been generated and, as a result of this loop, we notice that
the k centers change their location step by step until no
more changes are done. This algorithm aims at minimizing
an objective function, known as squared error function, which
is given by:
J (C1, . . . , Ck) =
k
X
j=1
X
i∈Ci
(∥¯ei − µj∥)2
(4)
where ¯ei is the s-dimensions data point (average normalized
energies) for user i, k is the number of cluster centers, sets
{C1, . . . , Ck} contain the data points binded to each one of
the k clusters, {µ1, . . . , µk} is the set of (s-dimensions) cluster
centers, and ∥¯ei − µj∥ is the Euclidean distance between ¯ei
and µj.

SOCIAL NETWORK ACTIVITY ANALYSIS
As as proof of concept, we used a dataset containing social
networking activity (speciﬁcally, wall posting) in Facebook of
a group of 200 users during 2011 and 2012. The dataset was
extracted from a group of Facebook friends of the authors
of this paper using the Facebook Graph Application Program

Interface (API) [8]. Facebook Graph API is a low level HTTP-
based API used to retrieve data from Facebook’s Social Graph.
Data queried using the Facebook Graph API is returned in
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which can be
easily post-processed to extract relevant statistics. The data
was divided in four datasets, one per semester: Jan-Jun 2011,
Jul-Dec 2011, Jan-Jun 2012 and, Jul-Dec 2012. We considered
an interval of analysis of 15 minutes (∆ = 15 minutes).
Note that this type of API usually provides well structured
data, but are generally limited in terms of which data, how
much data, and how often data can be retrieved. Conditions
vary signiﬁcantly between services: in contrast to Twitter, for
example, Facebook is quite restrictive in terms of what data can
be accessed, but imposes few limits on the request frequency.
Besides, we know that companies retain the right to modify
or close their data interfaces, which can lead to substantial
problems for researchers.
A. Activity Patterns
Figure 1 shows the average normalized energy coefﬁcients over
time for some of the users included in the dataset. Although
this plot contains a high number of curves, different proﬁles
can be distinguished: some users have activity proﬁles that
exhibit a noticeable periodicity around the 24 hours time scale
(corresponding to the typical bell-shaped curve); for other
users, the activity proﬁles exhibit relevant components in the
complete frequency range, while a third group of users include
important low periodicity components. The ﬁrst group of users
is the one that presents high energy coefﬁcients around the 24
hours time scales, that is, the periodicity of its activity proﬁle is

roughly equal to one day. So, these users have typically a daily
interaction with Facebook. The second group of users is the
one that presents signiﬁcant energy components at the different
time scales, which means that these users interact intensively
with facebook, being permanently active. We know that there
are several types of Facebook interactions besides wall posting,
like messaging, use of different applications, photo upload,
chat, among others, but we cannot establish a straighforward
relationship between their interaction frequencies. Neverthe-
less, high activity periods are very likely to include different
types of user interactions. Finally, users of the third group use
Facebook in a less infrequent way, interacting with the OSN
(through wall posting, in this case) in periods that are generally
higher than one day. So, these proﬁles include signiﬁcant
energies for periodicities of several hours.
B. Users Classiﬁcation
In order to better identify the different activity proﬁles, the k-
means unsupervised clustering algorithm was applied to each
one of the four datasets. As previously explained, three clusters
were enough to describe the different proﬁles. In fact, when
we used more clusters, some of them tend to overlap.
The different cluster centroids corresponding to the four
datasets are presented in Figures 2 to 5. Note that cluster cen-
troids are simply the means of each clustering variable for each
cluster. For all datasets, three similar proﬁles can be clearly
identiﬁed: proﬁle A exhibits signiﬁcant energy components
around the 24 hours time scale, with lower energy components
at the low and high frequency regions of the plot; proﬁle B
corresponds to users that include relevant energy components

in the complete frequency range; proﬁle C represents users
that have signiﬁcant energy components in the medium to
low frequeny range and lower energy components in the high
frequency range.
These proﬁles, clearly revealed by the clustering analysis,
are in accordance to our previous analysis. In terms of their
wall posting activity, Facebook users can actually be classiﬁed
into three groups, corresponding to their typical usage behav-
ior.
C. Users Behavior Evolution
Finally, it is important to study the temporal evolution of the
different users behavior. Figure 6 shows the size (in terms of
the percentage of users) of the different proﬁles in the four
semesters that are included in this study. The main trend that
can be identiﬁed is a global decrease on the number of users
corresponding to proﬁle A and a steady increase (although
with some ﬂuctuations) on the number of users corresponding
to proﬁles B and C. This means that the number of users that
typically have daily access to Facebook is decreasing; these
users tend to behave according to proﬁle B (users that are
almost permanently connected) or proﬁle C (users that access
to Facebook at longer intervals).
In order to prove this observation, we tried to track how
users changed their proﬁles in the two years period of our study
by calculating the number of users that changed between two
speciﬁc proﬁle types. Figure 7 shows the percentage of users
that made a particular change on their proﬁle, for all possible
changing combinations. As previously observed, proﬁle A was
the one that lost more users: now, we can conclude that the
majority of proﬁle A users (aroud 33%) changed their proﬁles

type C. A signiﬁcantly lower number of users whose proﬁles
were classiﬁed as type B changed their proﬁles: among the
ones that changed, the vast majority changed their proﬁles to
type C. Finally, most of the users whose proﬁles were classiﬁed
as type C changed their proﬁles: in this case, a transition to
proﬁle type A has a higher probability than a transition to
proﬁle type B.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Some online social networks are among the most popular
services on the Internet, having a deep impact on the social,
political and economical aspects of our daily lives. Characteriz-
ing social network users based on their temporal behavior and
activity proﬁles can be useful to evaluate the performance of
existing systems, conduct social studies, develop viral market-
ing strategies, design new content distribution systems, detect
anomalous behaviors, such as bots or compromised accounts,
among many other tasks. Based on a medium size dataset,
extracted using the Facebook Graph API and containing social
networking activity of 200 users during the years of 2011 and
2012, this paper was able to characterize the activity proﬁles of
Facebook users, as well as their time evolution. The periodicity
trends of the activity proﬁles were identiﬁed using multiscale
analysis based on a wavelet decomposition of the dataset.
Three types of activity proﬁles were identiﬁed: an activity
proﬁle that exhibits a periodicity around the 24 hours time
scale, a second proﬁle that exhibits relevant components in the
complete frequency range and a proﬁle that includes important
low periodicity components: the ﬁrst group of users has an
activity periodicity roughly equal to one day; users belonging
to the second group interact intensively with facebook, while
users belonging to the third group use Facebook in time periods
that are generally higher than one day. By looking at the
temporal evolution of the different users behavior, we were
able to identify a global decrease on the number of users
corresponding to the ﬁrst proﬁle and a steady increase on the
number of users corresponding to the other two proﬁles. In
fact, the majority of users from the ﬁrst group (aroud 33%)
changed their proﬁles to the second type, although around 14%
of them changed their proﬁles to the third type.
The identiﬁcation methodology that was used in this study,
which relies on multiscale analysis, will now be applied to the
detection of social bots. Social bots, which are automatic or
semi-automatic computer programs that mimic humans and/or
human behavior in online social networks, can attack users
(targets) to pursue a variety of latent goals, such as to harvest
private users’ data such as email addresses, phone numbers,
and other personal data that have monetary value, to spread
information or to inﬂuence targets. Although many techniques
have been proposed to automatically identify spambots in
OSNs based on their abnormal behavior, security defenses are
not prepared for detecting or stopping a large-scale inﬁltration
caused by social bots.
