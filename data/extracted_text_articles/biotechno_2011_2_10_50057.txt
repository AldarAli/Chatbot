Abstract—Directional auditory perception features and energy 
information were extracted from transcranial Doppler (TCD) 
ultrasound  signals and were used to automatically  identify 
micro-embolic  events  (MEEs)  using  a  novel  embolic  signal 
analysis approach. Three directional analysis methods were 
evaluated for their MEE identification performance using data 
recorded during cardiac surgery. The analysis methods were 
based on Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs), linear 
frequency cepstrum coefficients (LFCCs) and linear spectral 
components (LSCs). The results of these preliminary off-line 
evaluations showed that: a) the auditory perception and energy 
features of Doppler signals could play an important role in the 
identification of MMEs; b) MFCC-based analysis seems to be 
superior to the other two methods, achieving a sensitivity of 
95.99%, a specificity of 96.43% and a positive predictive value 
(PPV) of 95.64%. Future studies using larger data sets and 
more  complicated  detection implementation  (a rather basic 
rule-based system was used in the detection stage here) could 
further confirm or improve the identification performance and 
robustness of MFCC-based systems.

 INTRODUCTION
Identification of cerebral micro-embolic events (MEEs) 
utilizing transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound is often used 
to  provide  valuable  information  in  clinical  and  research 
settings [1]-[3]. Therefore considerable effort has been made 
using a wide range of signal analysis approaches (e.g., [4]-
[7]), trying to improve the reliability of automated MEE 
identification (AMEEI) systems. 
A novel AMEEI approach is proposed in this study with 
the following objectives: 
1.
To  emulate  and  use  human  auditory  perceptual 
features  in  AMEEI.  Human  auditory  perception 
plays an important role in manual MEE detection 
procedures that are often regarded as quite reliable in 
research settings [8], [9]. Hence perceptual features 
are studied here to explore their potential to improve 
AMEEI performance. 
2.
To  extract  the  directional  signatures  of  embolic 
signals and apply them in the classification of MEEs. 
It is widely acknowledged that, in general, MEEs are 
unidirectional  events  whilst  artifacts  are  bi-
directional ones [10], [11]. However, the way to 
efficiently  use  this  directional  information  for 
AMEEI purposes is yet to be addressed in detail and 
in depth.
Three AMEEI methods were evaluated in this study. Mel 
frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs), linear frequency 
cepstrum  coefficients  (LFCCs)  and  linear  spectral 
components (LSCs) were used to extract basic perceptual 
and perception-related energy features from recorded signals. 
Doppler signals containing both sporadic MEEs and embolic 
showers recorded from patients during cardiac surgery were 
used to evaluate these methods. A “gold standard” based on 
the results from manual MEE detection was applied to all the 
evaluations of the AMEEI performance. 
This paper is divided into 5 sections. The details for the 
design and implementation of the AMEEI methods are given 
in the next section. Section III contains the details of the 
clinical data and evaluation procedures. Experimental results, 
AMEEI  performance  comparisons  and  discussion  are 
provided in Section IV, which is followed by conclusions 
and future work in Section V.

METHODS
A.
The MFCC-based Directional Analysis Approach
Imagining that a trained human operator is listening to 
both the forward and reverse Doppler signals to compare the 
auditory perceptions, the perceived difference between the 
two signals can be emulated by calculating the directional 
perceptual distance (DPD) between the two Doppler signals. 
The  DPD  at  time  index  n  is  defined  as  (the  sampling 
frequency  is  12.5kHz  and  the  data  window  length  is 
10.24ms):

Here MfccF(i) and MfccR(i) are the ith MFCC elements 
(from the “classical” MFCC calculation [12]) for the forward 
and reverse signals at time index n, respectively;  and N=7 is 
the  number  of  the  MFCC  elements  used  in  the  DPD 
calculation.  Based  on  the  DPD,  the  mean  directional 
perceptual distance (MDPD) and the differential directional

EngSi is the estimated signal energy at time index i and 
EngBi is  the  estimated  energy  (averaged  in  a  154-ms 
window) for the background signals around time index i. 
These energy estimations are calculated using the spectral 
magnitude elements obtained using a 128-point FFT and a 
Hamming window (overlap=50%).

where ESBR_Fi is the ESBR for the forward signal at time 
index i. The RPECn is actually the correlation coefficient 
between the differential perceptual change and the relative 
energy variation for the forward signal within the moving 
window. It should become high for MEEs (the higher the 
relative embolic signal level in the forward direction, the 
larger the relative directional perceptual difference) and low 
for normal artifacts due to their bi-directional properties.
 Another directional parameter derived from the RPEC 
is the averaged relative perceptual and energy correlation 
(ARPEC) within a positive ESBR_F peak between the two 
time indexes n1 and n2 that form the two boundaries of the 
peak. The ARPEC corresponding to the ESBR_F peak is 
defined as:

An  MFCC-based  automated  identification  unit  was 
designed and developed to detect MEEs with a certain signal 
threshold  (i.e.,  ESBR≥7dB),  using the  above  defined 
parameters. Fig.1 shows the block-diagram of this rather 
basic rule-based system and Table I lists the parameters used 
and their details.
B.
The LFCC-based DirectionalAanalysis Approach
An LFCC-based  MEE detection unit was designed and 
developed using a system structure similar to that shown in 
Fig.1. The main difference, however, is that the MFCCs and 
all  the  MFCC-based  parameters  were  replaced  by  their 
LFCC counterparts in the directional/perceptual evaluations. 
The calculation of the LFCCs is same as that of the MFCCs, 
except that mel scale filters are not used [12].

The directional linear frequency distance (DLFD) is used 
as the LFCC counterpart of the (MFCC-based) DPD. The 
DLFD at the time index n can be defined as:

where LfccF(i) and LfccR(i) are the ith LFCC elements for 
the forward and reverse signals at time index n, respectively; 
and N=7 is the number of the LFCC elements used.
Similar to the calculations in (2), (3), (5) and (6), four 
more LFCC-based parameters were derived from the DLFD, 
as the LFCC counterparts of MDPD, DDPD, RPEC and 
ARPEC. These five LFCC-based parameters were then used 
to form an LFCC-based MEE detection unit according to the 
same rule-based system structure shown in Fig.1.
C.
The LSC-based Directional Analysis Approach
Again,  the same system structure shown in Fig.1 was 
used to design an LSC-based MEE detection unit. This time, 
the  MFCCs  and  all  the  MFCC-based  parameters  were 
replaced  by  their  LSC  counterparts  in  the 
directional/perceptual evaluations.
The  directional spectral distance (DSD) is used here to 
replace the MFCC-based DPD in (1). The DSD at the time 
index n can be defined as:

where XF(i)  and XR(i)  are the spectral magnitudes for the 
forward and reverse signals sampled at the ith frequency 
index, and N1=46 was chosen to match the corresponding 
frequency bandwidth used in the MFCC and LFCC methods.
Using formulae similar to (2), (3), (5) and (6), four more 
LSC-based parameters are deduced from the DSD, as the 
analogues of MDPD, DDPD, RPEC and ARPEC. These five 
LSC-based  parameters  were  then  used  in  an  LSC-based 
MEE  detection  unit  with  the  same  rule-based  system 
structure shown in Fig.1.

CLINICAL DATA AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES
A.
Data Acquisition
The data used in this study were selected from Doppler 
recordings on two patients during cardiac surgery (a mitral 
valve replacement and an aortic root replacement). These 
recordings were made using a modified version of the in-
house  multi-gate  TCD  system  previously  developed  [5]. 
Doppler signals from only one chosen gate were used in this 
study.  A  transmitted  frequency  of  2  MHz  and  a  pulse 
repetition frequency of 12.5 kHz were chosen during the 
signal acquisitions. The receive gate width was set to 10 mm 
and the sample depth was adjusted to give the optimal signal 
from the middle cerebral arteries of the patients.
B.
MEE Verification Methods 
The  evaluation  started  with  the  identification  of 
significant events (SEs). Here, a SE was defined as an event 
with the ESBR higher than or equal to 7dB. A 40-ms time-
domain resolution was used to find the numbers of SEs in 
data recordings. A “gold standard” based on the manual 
“case study decision method” [8] was then used to verify 
MEEs that were part of the SE family.
C.
Data and Procedures  for theTraining Phase
Four  recordings  containing  998  seconds  of  recorded 
signals  in total  were  used  to  train  the  knowledge-based 
system shown in Fig.1. About 12350 SEs were found in 
these training data, which included 1756 verified MEEs.
The training data were purposely selected from clinical 
recordings,  to contain sporadic  MEEs, MEE groups  and 
artifacts including those caused by diathermy signals. 
The training data were used for setting and tuning the 
thresholds and parameters in all the three analysis methods 
(i.e., the MFCC-based, the LFCC-based and the LSC-based 
approaches),  until  the  “optimized”  training  performances 
were reached for these three AMEEI systems.  
D.
Data and Evaluation Procedures for the Testing Phase
The system was evaluated in two ways using data different 
from those recordings used in the training phase.
First,  an  evaluation  of  sporadic  MEE  identification  was 
performed using three recordings, which had a total signal 
duration of 827 seconds. These recordings contained 2,835 
SEs, 128 sporadic MEEs and many artifacts including those 
caused by diathermy signals.
Second, an evaluation of the ability to detect closely packed 
MEEs  was  carried  out,  using  one  recording  that  was 
dominated  by  heavy  embolic  showers.  The  recording 
contained 4,547 SEs within the recording duration of 310 
seconds,  amongst  which  3,189  were  verified  as  MEEs 
(closely packed MEEs were separated using 7-dB ESBR 
peaks during the verification).
The results of the two evaluations were then used to obtain 
the overall evaluation results for all three AMEEI methods 
being tested.

EVALUATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Evaluation Results for Sporadic MEE Identification
The sensitivity, the specificity and the positive predictive 
value (PPV) results for the evaluation of sporadic  MEE 
identification are shown in Table II. It can be seen that the 
MFCC-based AMEEI method outperforms the other two 
methods in all the categories, although the performances of 
the other two methods are also reasonably good. 
An example of identification of sporadic MEEs using the 
MFCC-based method is shown in Fig.2 (the display results 
for the LFCC-based and the LSC-based methods are not 
provided since they are identical to Fig.2 in this example).

low in this 5 minute recording containing heavy embolic 
showers, compared with the number of MEEs. 
As an example for comparison, Fig.3, Fig.4 and Fig.5 
show the MFCC-based, the LFCC-based and the LSC-based 
methods used to detect a group of MEEs within an embolic 
shower,  and  yellow  indicator  lines  are  used  to  mark 
identified MEEs.

displayed on the upper part of the screen, whilst the estimated signal to background ratios (ESBRs) are shown on the lower part of the screen (ESBR_F is for  
the forward signal and ESBR_R is for the reverse). Arrow 1 shows a sporatic MEE. Arrow 2 demonstrates that the MEE has been detected by the MFCC-
based emthod, with a yellow indicator dispayed under the sonogram. Arrows 3 and 4 point to artefacts.Arrows 5 and 6 indicate non-detection regions of the  
sonograms for the current screen (i.e., any MEE within these regions is to be indentified in the previous or subsequent screen). Arrow 7 points to the display  
range for the ESBR_F and ESBR_R.

Doppler signals are displayed on the upper part of the screen, whilst the estimated signal to background ratios (ESBRs) are shown on the lower part of the 
screen (ESBR_F is for the forward signal and ESBR_R is for the reverse). Arrow 1 shows a group of MEEs within an embolic shower. Arrow 2 demonstrats  
that the MEEs have been verifiied using the manual “gold standard” (green lines displayed under the sonogram) and also detected by the MFCC-based 
emthod (with yellow indicator lines dispayed). It can be seen that the automated method detects the EBSR_F peaks more accurately, compared to the manual  
verifications. Arrows 3 and 4 indicate non-detection regions of the sonograms for the current screen (i.e., any MEE within these regions is to be indentified 
in the previous or subsequent screen). Arrow 5 points to the display range for the ESBR_F and ESBR_R.

Overall Evaluation Result
The overall evaluation results for the automated MEE 
identification are shown in Table IV. It shows that, with 
similar specificity and PPV results for all the three methods, 
the MFCC-based AMEEI system seems to be significantly 
superior in terms of sensitivity performance.

Discussion
It  seems  from  the  results  that  all  the  three  methods 
performed reasonably well while detecting sporadic MEEs. 
It should be noticed that the MFCC-based method is superior 
to other two methods, with a higher sensitivity as well as a 
higher specificity.
Furthermore, the MFCC-based method coped quite well 
with heavy embolic showers, whilst the other two methods 
suffered heavy sensitivity losses. Our in-depth investigations 
revealed that the LFCC and the LSC parameters were not 
sensitive  enough  to  follow  the  rapid  directional  signal 
changes due to heavy embolic showers, which could be the 
cause for the significant numbers of MEEs missed by these 
two detection approaches. 
The  results  also  demonstrated  that  even  the  simpler 
conventional spectral based LSC method outperformed the 
LFCC-based approach in general.
 
V.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
A novel MFCC-based embolic signal analysis has been 
proposed to explore the potentials of auditory perception and 
energy features of Doppler signals in automated embolus 
identification. Initial off-line evaluations were carried out 
using Doppler signals recorded during cardiac surgery and 
the  results  show  the  proposed  method  could  play  an 
important  role  in  a  high-performance  automated  MEE 
identification system. Compared with the LFCC-based and 
the  traditional  LSC-based  approaches,  the  MFCC-based 
method seems to have a superior performance in both cases 
of sporadic MEEs and with heavy embolic showers. 
Further clinical evaluations with a larger data set will be 
necessary in future studies. 
All the approaches at this stage were applied based on an 
assumption that an artery had already been located by an 
operator  (i.e.,  sonograms  had  been  established  and 
displayed). Future studies could be carried out to include the 
searching phase while the operator is locating the artery. 
Since unidirectional artifacts could be occasionally generated 
(e.g., due to a finger touching on the probe) in this rather 
special detection phase, additional signal analysis measures 
may be needed to cope with these unwanted events.
