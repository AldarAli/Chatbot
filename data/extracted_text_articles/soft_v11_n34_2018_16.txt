Abstract — Current satellite images provide us with detailed 
information about the state of our planet, as well as about our 
technical infrastructure and human activities. A range of 
already existing commercial and scientific applications try to 
analyze the physical content and meaning of satellite images by 
exploiting the data of individual, multiple or temporal 
sequences of images. However, what we still need today are 
advanced tools to automatically analyze satellite images in 
order to extract and understand their full content and 
meaning. To remedy this exploration problem, we outline a 
highly automated and application-adapted data-mining and 
content interpretation system consisting of five main 
components, namely Data Sources (selection and storage of 
relevant images), Data Model Generation (patch cutting and 
generation of feature vectors), Database Management System 
(systematic data storage), Knowledge Discovery in Databases 
(clustering and content labeling), and Statistical Analytics 
(generation of classification maps). As test sites, we selected 
UNESCO-protected areas in Europe that include coastal areas 
for monitoring and an area known in the Mediterranean Sea 
that contains fish cages. The analyzed areas are: the Curonian 
Lagoon in Lithuania and Russia, the Danube Delta in 
Romania, the Hardangervidda in Norway, and the Wadden 
Sea in the Netherlands. For these areas, we are providing the 
results of our image content classification system consisting of 
image classification maps and additional statistical analytics 
based on three different use cases. The first use case is the 
detection of wind turbines vs. boats in the Wadden Sea. The 
second use case is the identification of fish cages/aquaculture 
along the Mediterranean coast. Finally, the third use case 
describes the differences between beaches, dams, dunes, and 
tidal flats in the Danube Delta, the Wadden Sea, etc. The 
average classification accuracy that we obtained is ranging 
from 80% to 95% depending on the type of available images.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
In Earth observation (EO) [1], a very popular satellite 
image analysis system is the one from Digital Globe, named 
Tomnod, or Google Earth together with its related tools, 
which are targeting general user topics. In addition, in the 
EO domain, there are systems such as LandEX [2], which is 
a land cover analysis system, while GeoIRIS [3] is a system 
that allows the user to refine a given query by iteratively 
specifying a set of relevant, and a set of non-relevant images. 
A similar information retrieval system is IKONA [4], which 
is using relevance feedback in order to exploit very high 
resolution EO images. Further, the Knowledge-driven 
Information Mining (KIM) system [5] is an example of an 
active learning system providing semantic interpretation of 
image content. The KIM concept evolved into the TELEIOS 
prototype [6], complementing the scope of searching for EO 
images with additional geo-information and in-situ data 
integrated into an operational EO system [7] to interpret 
TerraSAR-X images. A similar concept to the KIM concept 
is presented in [8], while in [9] a data mining approach for 
Big Data is described. 
Our proposed system is very fast compared with the other 
existing systems, and can retrieve with only a few examples 
the desired category with higher accuracy. The diversity of 
applications that can be considered for such systems are 
rather broad and include, for instance, coastal environmental 
monitoring (sea level, tides and wave direction), land 
cover/use changes, disaster monitoring, forest management, 
ice monitoring, monitoring of active volcanoes, waste 
deposit site management, traffic monitoring, vegetation 
monitoring, urban sprawl, soil moisture dynamics, etc. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes 
the selected test areas with a number of results obtained with 
the proposed methodology. Section III presents our datasets. 
Section IV details the data mining methodology applied in 
this paper. Section V shows the results for three selected 
cases. Section VI concludes the paper together with the 
future work. The acknowledgements close the paper. 
II. 
SELECTION OF TEST AREAS, USE CASES, AND 
APPLICATIONS 
The use case selection is closely related to the 
ECOPOTENTIAL project that focuses on a targeted set of 
internationally recognized protected areas in Europe, 
European territories and beyond, including mountainous, 
arid and semi-arid, and coastal and marine ecosystems [10]. 
We emphasize here a number of use cases for monitoring 
coastal environments. The first four use cases are 
internationally recognized protected areas as UNESCO 
(United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization) Natural Heritage sites. These selected use 
cases are the Wadden Sea with the Dutch Delta (in the 
Netherlands), the Danube Delta (in Romania), the Curonian 
Lagoon (in Lithuania and Russia), and the Hardangervidda 
(in Norway). The last use case is an area that has a large 
aquaculture located between Albania and Greece.  
A. The Wadden Sea, Netherlands 
Site description: The Wadden Sea (Dutch: Waddenzee, 
German: Wattenmeer, Danish: Vadehavet) is an intertidal

zone in the south-eastern part of the North Sea. It lies 
between the coast of N-W continental Europe and the range 
of Frisian Islands, forming a shallow body of water with tidal 
flats and wetlands [11], protected by a 450 km long chain of 
barrier islands, the Wadden Islands. The Wadden Sea region 
measures about 22,000 km2, divided between land and sea. 
About 63% of the region lies in Germany, with about 30% in 
the Netherlands, and 7% in Denmark [12]. In 2009, the 
Dutch-German Wadden Sea was inscribed on the UNESCO 
World Heritage List, and the Danish part was added in 2014. 
The landforms in the Wadden Sea region have essentially 
been created from a marine or tidal environment [13]. 
Typical for the Wadden Sea are large tidal flats, which 
are characterized by very high benthic biomass and 
productivity, dominated by molluscs and polychaetes.  
State-of-the-art publications: In the research literature 
there are several studies treating the Wadden Sea area along 
the years. In order to understand the Wadden Sea dynamics, 
a number of recent publications [14][15][16][17] already 
used remote sensing images and addressed the issue of 
Synthetic 
Aperture 
Radar 
(SAR) 
satellite 
image 
classification and interpretation in these areas. At present, the 
option of data fusion from different sensors has not yet been 
fully exploited. 
Image interpretation goal: The Wadden Sea area faces a 
strong economic impact due to recreation, fisheries and 
maritime traffic. The last impact is due to, e.g., the ports of 
Bremerhaven, Hamburg, and Rotterdam whereby the traffic 
runs through or nearby this area, which makes the 
monitoring of sand banks and any decrease of the water 
depth and the tide levels in this area a critical topic for 
maritime security. A second important topic is the 
monitoring of biodiversity as described by [10]. 
Typical examples: The diversity of categories identified 
from a single image and a typical classification map of the 
Wadden Sea and its surrounding areas are shown in Figures 
1 and 2. 
B. The Danube Delta, Romania 
Site description: The Danube Delta is the second largest 
river delta in Europe and is the best preserved one on the 
continent [18]. Formed over a period of more than 10,000 
years, the Danube Delta continues to grow due to the 67 
million tons of alluvia deposited every year by the Danube 
River [19]. The delta is an ideal test and validation area for 
vegetation monitoring as it is characterized by high 
biodiversity and various crops. 
The Delta is formed around the three main channels of 
the Danube, named after their respective ports Chilia (in the 
north), Sulina (in the middle), and Sfantu Gheorghe (in the 
south). 
The greater part of the Danube Delta lies in Romania 
(Tulcea County), while its northern part, on the left bank of 
the Chilia arm, is situated in Ukraine (Odessa Oblast). Its 
total surface is 4,152 km2 of which 3,446 km2 are in 
Romania. The waters of the Danube, which flow into the 
Black Sea, form the largest and best preserved delta in 
Europe. In 1991, the Danube Delta was inscribed on the 
UNESCO World Heritage List due do its biological 
uniqueness. 
State-of-the-art publications: In the image processing 
literature there are not many studies treating the Danube 
Delta especially for SAR data [20][21][22]. However, the 
monitoring of biodiversity from in-situ measurements has 
attracted more interest [23]. 
Image interpretation goal: At the mouth of the Danube, 
the alluvial discharge decreases every year from 81 million 
tons in 1894, to 70 million tons in 1939, 58 million tons in 
1982, and about 22 million tons in 2015. This makes it 
interesting to monitor the evolution of the alluvial discharge 
and to investigate its impact on the Danube Delta and the 
three channels together with their ports (Chilia, Sulina, and 
Sfantu Gheorghe) through the years. 
The data can be combined with other types of 
information, such as the volume of water of each channel in 
order to prepare flood risk maps needed for the safety of the 
shipping traffic and also for the local authorities to protect 
the human settlements. Another image interpretation goal is 
vegetation monitoring, in particular, biodiversity issues and 
crop type analyses. 
Typical examples: The diversity of categories identified 
from a single image and a typical classification map of the 
Danube Delta and its surrounding areas are shown in Figures 
3 and 4.  
C. The Curonian Lagoon, Lithuania and Russia 
Site description: The Curonian Lagoon is the largest 
European lagoon. Situated in the southern part of the Baltic 
Sea with a total area of 1584 km2, the lagoon receives water 
from the River Nemunas. The salinity of the water is higher 
and ﬂuctuates between the northern and southern part of the 
lagoon [10]. The entire Lithuanian part of the Curonian 
Lagoon has been designated as a NATURA 2000 area and in 
2000 the Curonian Spit cultural landscape was as well 
inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. 
State-of-the-art publications: In the remote sensing 
literature, there are not many studies treating the Curonian 
Lagoon especially for SAR data. However, the monitoring of 
biodiversity has attracted greater interest [24][25][26]. 
Image interpretation goal: We analyzed the effect of 
socio-economic activities of the area regarding: the ceasing 
commercial fisheries, the prohibition of the extraction of 
mineral resources, the agricultural sector, the hunting sector, 
the restriction of recreational use of the aquatic areas, and the 
oil drilling/pollution of the area. 
Typical examples: The diversity of categories identified 
from a single image and a typical classification map of the 
Curonian Lagoon and its surrounding areas are shown in 
Figures 5 and 6.

D. The Hardangervidda, Norway 
Site description: The Hardangervidda is the largest 
peneplain (eroded plain) plateau in Europe with a cold year-
round alpine climate, and one of Norway's largest glaciers. 
The largest extent covers an area of about 6,500 km2 at an 
average elevation of 1100 m and is part of the 
Hardangervidda National Park, which is a protected area. 
The plateau with its boulders and rock outcrops are the 
remnants of mountains that were worn down by the glaciers 
during the quaternary Ice Ages [10]. The landscape of the 
Hardangervidda is characterized by barren, treeless, and 
shrubby moorland interrupted by numerous lakes, streams 
and rivers. 
State-of-the-art publications: In the remote sensing 
literature, there are very few publications that are 
investigating the Hardangervidda and its surrounding areas 
using SAR data. One of these publications is the monitoring 
of wet snow [27]. 
Image interpretation goal: We analyzed the effects in 
time of the high mountain plateau with its unique artic flora 
and fauna, and the land use (e.g., grazing by livestock and 
fishing) [10]. 
Typical examples: The diversity of categories identified 
from a single image and a typical classification map of the 
Hardangervidda and its surrounding areas are shown in

The authors of [28] identified 248 cages with a circular 
diameter larger than 40 m and 20,976 cages within 10 km 
offshore. The majority of these fish cages/aquaculture (see 
Figure 1 in [29]) are located in Greece (49%) and Turkey 
(31%). Based on this context, we selected an area along the 
Greek coast near Corfu Island. 
State-of-the-art publications: In this area of aquaculture / 
fish cages, there are many remote sensing publications. In 
two recent publications ([30] and [31]), the authors are using 
Sentinel-1 SAR images in order to monitor aquaculture and 
to count fish cages.  
Image interpretation goal: Using the satellite imagery 
available through the Sentinels or TerraSAR-X, we can 
detect these fish cages/aquaculture with a better or lower 
accuracy using SAR or optical data. This information can be 
used later to estimate the fish farm production in the area. 
We can extend the analysis to the entire Mediterranean coast 
and the results can be compared with the reports [32] 
published by FAO (United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization). 
Typical examples: The diversity of categories identified 
from a single image and a typical classification map of the 
area between Albania and Greece close to Corfu Island are 
shown in Figures 9 and 10.

between Albania and Greece and its surrounding areas. 
III. 
DATASETS 
An important aspect to be addressed is the compilation of 
a reference dataset for test and validation of the different 
systems. We already possess an initial synthetic aperture 
radar dataset composed of 1000 TerraSAR-X images and 
100 Sentinel-1 images covering target areas from around the 
world.  
From this database, about 295 TerraSAR-X and 25 
Sentinel-1A images have already been annotated by a remote 
sensing expert using a semi-automatic semantic annotation 
system resulting in a semantic catalogue of hundreds of 
semantic labels grouped in a 3-level hierarchical scheme 
[33]. This annotated database mainly covers urban and 
industrial 
areas 
together 
with 
their 
infrastructure 
predominantly from Europe, and can be considered as our 
initial ground truth dataset [34]. 
Our latest dataset also contains optical satellite data with 
multi-spectral images (e.g., Sentinel-2A), and synthetic 
aperture radar images (e.g., TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A / 
1B). These data cover 10 protected areas from Europe 
(national parks, mountains, arid and semi-arid areas, and 
coastal and marine ecosystems) [10]. 
IV. 
METHODOLOGY 
The data mining system [7] (used in this paper) is 
composed of five modules: Data Sources (DS), Data Model 
Generation (DMG), Database Management System (DBMS), 
Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), and Statistical 
Analytics (SA). It’s the first one that explores, discovers, 
extracts semantics, and understands Big EO data. 
Our data mining methodology is shown in Figure 11 and 
a pseudo-code segment is given in Table 1. For more details 
about the implementation and algorithms, see [7]. 
The DS module collects the relevant data related to each 
use case to be processed and analyzed in the other modules. 
The DMG module transforms the original format of 
original Earth observation products into smaller and more 
compact product representations that include image 
descriptors, metadata, image patches, etc.  
The DBMS module is used for storing all the generated 
information and allows querying and retrieval of the 
available image data.  
The KDD module is in charge of finding patterns of 
interest from the processed data and presenting them to the 
user. Moreover, the KDD module allows annotating the 
image content by using machine learning algorithms and 
human interaction resulting in physical categories.  
The SA module provides classification maps of each 
dataset and distribution results of the retrieved categories in 
an image. 
These five modules are operated automatically and 
interactively with and without user interaction.

V. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
For the selected areas of interest, different use cases can 
be considered such as: detection of Wind turbines vs. Boats; 
Fish cages/Aquaculture; differences between Beaches, Tidal 
flats, and Dams; etc.  
For our first example, we selected the Wadden Sea area 
and we show the results for the detection of Wind Turbines 
vs. detection of Boats. The images were acquired in order to 
cover, as much as possible, the same area on the surface 
and/or the same acquisition date or a close date between the 
acquisitions. The data set consists of different images 
acquired by three different satellites: a TerraSAR-X image 
acquired on May 13, 2015 with a resolution of 2.9 meters, a 
Sentinel-1A image acquired on May 15, 2015 with a 
resolution of 20 meters, and a Sentinel-2A single quadrant-
image acquired on April 21, 2016 with a resolution of 10 
meters (comprising only the RGB bands). In Figure 12, we 
show the available data for the Wadden Sea protected area. 
All these images were tiled into patches, and from each 
patch a feature vector was extracted. We classified the 
images considering only two categories of interest, namely 
Wind turbines and Boats (see Figure 13). Based on the 
extracted features and the specific patterns of these 
categories, we were able to separate them during 
classification. Figures 14, 15, and 16 illustrate the retrieved 
categories after the classification back-projected on the 
quick-look of each image product. For each image product, 
the locations of Wind turbines and Boats are marked in green 
and blue, respectively. 
The complete processing chain from ingestion to 
annotation was run on a desktop PC with software coded in 
Java 8 and Matlab R2105a. The PC used for our experiments 
had a processor clock rate of 2.40 GHz, and a RAM capacity 
of 8 GB. Typically, we obtain a CPU usage of less than 25% 
as we store all image ﬁles onto disk and have to wait for the 
completion of all data transfers. The actual memory 
allocation of our PC configuration is less than 50 MBytes per 
image. The classification and display of a new set of 
retrieved patches needs about 4 to 6 ms when we have a 
collection volume of 2 GBytes of image data.  
The accuracy of the results was computed separately for 
each sensor and for each retrieved category. For each image 
(EOi) we compared the category al with its corresponding 
reference category rk and we computed its classification 
accuracy. The attained average accuracy is 93%, ranging 
from 80% to 95% depending on the image type (e.g., 
TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1A, or Sentinel-2A). When we 
compare the different SAR sensors, we notice that the overall 
classification accuracy is higher for the high resolution 
instruments, for example for TerraSAR-X. 
For the second example, we selected an area between 
Albania 
and 
Greece 
in 
order 
to 
identify 
Fish 
cages/Aquaculture (Figure 17). The goal of this second 
example is to extract, from different image products, as 
much as possible, all the visible patches from the images that 
contain this category. 
The 
location 
of 
the 
area 
of 
interest 
(Fish 
cages/Aquaculture) is close to Corfu Island and is shown in

Figure 18 and marked with pushpins [29]. The satellite 
images were acquired by different sensors around the same 
period: the TerraSAR-X product was acquired on January 
19, 2017, the Sentinel-1B product on January 15, 2017, and 
the Sentinel-2A product on October 15, 2016 (when the area 
of interest was not covered by Clouds). Figure 19 shows the 
available data for the investigated area. 
All three images are covering the area of interest where 
the Fish cages/Aquaculture are located, but not in all three 
images we can see the entire aquaculture. This is because of 
the sensor type (SAR or multi-spectral), resolution, and 
maybe because of the feature extraction methods being used 
for classification. 
The images were tiled into patches, and from each patch 
a feature vector was extracted based on the type of sensor. 
Further, we classified the image patches and chose three 
semantic labels, namely Aquaculture, Boats, and Harbor 
infrastructures. 
Figure 20 illustrates the retrieved categories after the 
classification projected on the quick-look image of each 
product. In each image the location of the semantic labels are 
marked in blue, red, and green.

We can conclude that, when the product has a higher 
resolution, we can better identify the area of interest, and 
with higher accuracy. 
The third example aims at the differences between 
Beaches, Dams, Dunes, and Tidal flats, categories that we 
can find within the images available in our dataset (e.g., the 
Danube Delta, the Curonian Lagoon, or the Wadden Sea). In 
this case, we obtained similar accuracy results with the 
previous cases.  
For illustration, we selected the area of the Wadden Sea 
and the area of the Danube Delta. In Figure 22, we show the 
results for the identification of Dams, Dunes, and Deltas or 
Tidal flats in the Wadden Sea. The image was acquired by 
Sentinel-1 on May 15, 2015 with a resolution of 20 meters. 
We tiled this image into patches and extracted a feature 
vector that is used further for classification. We classified the 
images considering only three categories of interest, namely 
Dams, Dunes, and Tidal flats (see the in-situ data in Figure 
21). Based on the extracted features and the specific patterns 
of these categories, we were able to separate them during 
classification.

The classification map was generated by back-projecting 
it on the image quick-look of the retrieved categories; then 
the locations of Dams, Dunes, and Tidal flats were marked in 
blue, red, and green, respectively.

In Figure 24, we show the results for the identification of 
Beaches or Sand banks and Deltas in the Danube Delta. The 
classification was made by considering only two categories 
(see the in-situ data in Figure 23). Based on the extracted 
features and the specific patterns of these categories, we 
were able to separate them during classification. The 
locations of Beaches and Deltas are marked in blue, and 
green, respectively. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, as an extension of [1], we analyzed several 
protected areas all over Europe by a high- and a medium-
resolution space-borne instrument (delivering SAR and 
multi-spectral images). The accuracy of the results was 
computed for each sensor by comparing the retrieved results 
with reference data and this accuracy is on average about 
97%.  
By exploiting the specific imaging details and the 
retrievable semantic categories of these three image types 
(TerraSAR-X, 
Sentinel-1, 
and 
Sentinel-2), 
we 
can 
semantically fuse the image classification maps. In order to 
verify the classification results, we had to compare them with 
in-situ data.  
For future evaluation, we plan to compare the 
classification accuracy of the wind turbines considering more 
parameters such as: the size of the pylons, the blade angles of 
the wind turbines, the rotation rates of the propellers, and the 
viewing direction and the resolution of the satellite images.  
At the moment, there exist some studies about wind 
turbines [44][45][46] using SAR images but none of the 
existing papers analyzes all these parameters simultaneously. 
Therefore, we plan to compare the results from the point of 
view of accuracy between high-resolution vs. medium-
resolution and between SAR vs. multi-spectral sensors. 
In future, we plan to compare the performances acquired 
so far with the ones of the new system that will be developed 
under the CANDELA project [47].  
In addition, depending on user feedback and responses by 
interested institutions, we could offer our software package 
to national and international authorities to support their 
coastline monitoring and disaster handling activities.
