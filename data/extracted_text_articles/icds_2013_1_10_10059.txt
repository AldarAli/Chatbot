Abstract—Five leading German parties and their coalitions
are evaluated from the viewpoint of direct democracy. For this
purpose, the positions of the parties on over 30 topical issues,
as given for the last Bundestag (parliament) elections 2009,
are compared with the outcomes of public opinion polls. The
results are summarized in the party indices of universality
(percentage of issues with majority representation). The same
is done for party coalitions. A statistical test is developed
to judge whether the index magnitudes are sufﬁciently high
to conﬁrm the representative capacity. It is shown that the
representativeness of German parties and their coalitions is
statistically insigniﬁcant.

I. INTRODUCTION
The mathematical theory of democracy provides methods
to evaluate single representatives (candidates for president,
political parties) and representative bodies (parliament, cabi-
net of ministers) regarding their capacity to express opinions
of the population. The evaluation is based on comparing the
position of representatives on selected policy issues with
the public opinion revealed in public polls, referenda, or
plebiscites. However, any conclusion based on a data sample
has a limited reliability. Therefore, the statistical signiﬁcance
of evaluation has to be estimated.
To illustrate what we are going to study, suppose that ﬁve
political parties deﬁne their position on six issues like ‘Intro-
duce nation-wide minimum wage’, ‘Privatize railways’, etc.,
and, according to public opinion polls, one party perfectly
represents the public opinion, matching the majority opinion
on all the issues. The party looks highly representative,
nevertheless, the following questions emerge:
1) Does the outcome observed really indicate at the
party’s representative capacity, or it may be just a
coincidence by chance? In other words, can a similar
performance be expected on other policy issues, not
yet considered or arising in future?
2) Are six policy issues sufﬁcient to make any conclusion
about the party’s representative capacity? Or their
number should be increased, say, to 10?
3) What can be said if the match of party positions to the
public opinion is imperfect, for instance, is restricted
to ﬁve out of six issues? Does the conclusion about
the party’s representativeness remain valid?
The same questions can be addressed to party coalitions.
The usual approach to this type of problems is developing
a statistical test. Assuming that the parties meet the public
opinion randomly, the probability of the actual outcome is
found. If it is small then a coincidence by chance looks
improbable and the actual observation is interpreted as a
manifestation of the party’s representative capacity. If the
probability is not small then the outcome looks possible and
no conclusion on the party capacity is made.
The match of party positions to public opinion can be
represented by a table, in our example of six issues versus
ﬁve parties, with 1s standing for match and 0s for no match.
If the match is assumed random, the table elements turn into
independent Bernoulli random variables, taking values 0 and
1 with equal probabilities 1/2.
If an alone-standing party is considered then the table
consists of a single column. The match on six out of six
issues has the probability (1/2)6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.02. Here, 0.02
is the signiﬁcance level of the null hypothesis — that there is
no representative capacity, i.e., the match and non-match of
the party positions with the public opinion is unpredictable,
and the responses to the questions are independent. In
social sciences it is traditional to use the 5% signiﬁcance
threshold; therefore, 0.02 is considered too small, the null
hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis about
the existing representative capacity is accepted. Hence, the
party is regarded representative.
For ﬁve parties, the situation is different. The probability
that one party out of ﬁve expresses the majority opinion on
all the six issues is 1−

1 − (1/2)65 ≈ 0.08. It is not small
enough to say that the actual outcome is little probable, so
the party’s representative capacity is in question. However,
if the perfect match is observed for seven out of seven issues
then the probability 1−

1 − (1/2)75 ≈ 0.04 is sufﬁciently
small, arguing for the party’s representativeness.
Making conclusions about coalitions is similar, but ran-
dom coincidences are more frequent than for single parties.

In our example of ﬁve parties, the occurrence of a three-
party coalition which represents the public opinion on six
out of six issues has the probability of about 0.10. Hence,
the perfect coalition performance observed is not much
promising for the future. The common probability threshold
0.05 (= 5%-signiﬁcance level) can be surpassed with as
many as eight hits out of eight. If the match is imperfect
then the sample of issues should be extended further. For
three-party coalitions, a single mismatch on i = 1 issue
must be outbalanced by at least m − i = 10 hits, otherwise
the 5%-signiﬁcance is not attained.
Computing the probabilities required to
statistically
‘prove’ the representative capacity of coalitions is not easy,
and just this task is the subject of this paper.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
Perfect column pairs and column triplets: A Bernoulli
(m × n)-matrix B = {bij} is a matrix whose elements bij
are independent Bernoulli random variables, taking values 0
and 1 with equal probabilities 1/2. A k-tuple of its columns
is called perfect if its sum along rows is a column m-vector
with all m elements being ≥ k/2 .
Label every k-tuple of columns of Bernoulli matrix with
the set of corresponding column numbers J = [j1, . . . , jk].
Order these labels J and use them as scalar indices of
column k-tuples.
By AJ denote the event that the J-th k-tuple is perfect.
We are interested in the probability of union of these events,
meaning that there occurs at least one perfect k-tuple of
columns:
Pr
[
AJ

=?
(1)
A table with random 0–1 codes of match of party positions
to public opinion is nothing else but a Bernoulli matrix.
Here, m rows are associated with m issues, and n columns
are associated with n parties. If the majority opinion on the
i-th issue is represented by the j-th party then the matrix
element bij = 1, otherwise bij = 0.
A perfect k-tuple of columns corresponds to a coalition
of k parties whose internal majority (≥ k/2 parties) shares
the prevailing public opinion on every issue. The probability
(1) characterizes the occurrence of such coalitions by chance
and is needed to statistically test the representative capacity
of coalitions with 100%-representativeness observed. That
is, it is addressed to answer Questions 1–2.
i-imperfect column pairs and column triplets: To study
Question 3 about imperfect match of party positions to
public opinion, weaken the perfectness-condition. If it is
violated in i or fewer rows, the k-tuple of columns is called
i-imperfect, that is, its sum along rows is a column m-vector
with at least m − i elements being ≥ k/2
.
Obviously, perfect k-tuples of columns are 0-imperfect.
A i-imperfect k-tuple of columns corresponds to a coalition
which represents the majority opinion incompletely, failing
to do it on i or fewer issues. The events AJ and the
probability (1) are respectively redeﬁned for i-imperfect k-
tuples of columns.
Existing literature: Besides the mathematical theory
of democracy, the problem of estimating the probabilities
mentioned arises in genetics, logistics, and some other
applications like trafﬁc control or ﬁnances [5], [6], [13],
[14], [15]. Random matrices are considered in numerous
publications; for a survey see [7], [8], [9], [10]. In particular,
there are papers focused on sums of random vectors and their
approximations; see [1], [2], [3], [5], [11].
These publications study trends in large random matrices
or in large sums of random vectors rather than propose
solutions for small and medium-sized practical applications
where asymptotic properties are not salient. The given paper
attempts to ﬁll in this gap by developing approaches to the
problem for column pairs and column triplets in small and
medium-sized Bernoulli matrices, that is, for coalitions with
two or three parties if the total number of parties and the
number of reference policy issues are rather limited.
Meta-modeling approach: For Bernoulli matrices, three
ways to ﬁnd the probability (1) are developed. One method
is geometric, another algebraic, and the third properly proba-
bilistic. In theory, each of these methods solves the problem,
but in practice every method has its computational limits.
The geometric solution is computationally appropriate for
Bernoulli matrices with a few columns, the algebraic — for
Bernoulli matrices with a few rows, and the probabilistic —
for Bernoulli matrices with twice more rows than columns.
Therefore, the united computational solution is combined
from the three methods. There are still non-computable
probabilities, and their approximations are estimated from
the known probabilities by ﬁve interpolation techniques.
The general approach is based on meta-modelling. Each
meta-model builds a series of models with computational
formulas for particular sizes of the Bernoulli matrix. These
formulas are too complex to be derived ‘manually’ and
have no visible regularity, so the meta-modeling approach
is essential.
The complexity and lack of regularities may evoke sus-
pects in the model errors. The doubts are resolved by equal
output from different methods. In fact, the probabilities com-
puted by alternative methods, say, geometric and algebraic,
coincide with the precision better than ǫ = 2−25.
About this paper: This paper focuses on the application
of the statistical test to estimate the statistical signiﬁcance
of the representativeness of ﬁve German parties currently
in the Bundestag and their coalitions. The full account of
mathematical methods which back up the statistical test is
presented in [16]. A more broad overview of the mathemat-
ical theory of democracy is given in [14], [17], [18].

III. APPLICATION TO GERMAN PARTIES
Let us come back to the questions posed in Introduction.
Apply the results obtained to evaluate the representative
capacity of ﬁve eligible German parties and their possible
coalitions at the time of Bundestag elections 2009; see
Table I.
Figure 1 shows positions of the ﬁve parties on 32 topical
policy issues; as well as outcomes of polls of public opinion
on these issues. The party positions are taken from the
Wahl-O-Mat — a German internet site developed after a
similar Dutch site StemWijzer (Vote match) of the late 1990s
[12], [19]. These sites were designed to stimulate political
participation, primarily by young people. The user ﬁlls
in a questionnaire on topical political issues with Yes/No
answers, eventually with weights; then the answers are
compared with the answers of the parties, and the user
learns which party ﬁts best to his political proﬁle [4]. Before
the elections, the governmental supervising committee —
Bundeszentrale f¨ur politische Bildung — ofﬁcially receives
from the parties their Yes/No answers to the questions for
the Wahl-O-Mat. Therefore, the information about party
positions we refer to is ofﬁcial. The answers of the Wahl-O-
Mat users are unavailable, because they are not saved even
as cumulated statistics. The position of the electorate on the
issues is taken from related public opinion polls; see [16],
[17] for references to data sources.
To explain the ﬁgure, consider the top question: ‘2. In-
troduce nation-wide minimal wage’. The question number
‘2’ is as in the ‘ofﬁcial’ Wahl-O-Mat table ﬁlled by the
parties shortly before the Bundestag elections 2009. Each
party is depicted by a rectangle, whose length is proportional
to the number of the party seats in the Bundestag. The
‘No/Yes’ party opinion on the question is reﬂected by
the location of the rectangle to the left side or to the
right side from the central vertical axis, respectively. A
Bundestag majority is attained if the cumulative length of
party rectangles surpasses the 50%-threshold (marked with
dotted lines). The balance of public opinion on each issue
is shown by the blue bars with the length normalized to
100% (abstaining respondents are ignored). Their bias from
the center indicates at the prevailing public opinion.
For every question, a given party represents either a
majority, or a minority of the population (identiﬁed with the
fraction in the opinion polls). For instance, the CDU-CSU
(black rectangle) with the ‘No’ answer to the top question ‘2.
Introduce nation-wide minimal wage’ represents the opinion
of 43% of the population against 52%. After normalization,
we obtain that its representativeness for question 2 is
rCDU-CSU,2 =
43
43 + 52 · 100% ≈ 45% .
Similarly, with the ‘No’ answer to the next question
‘17. Relax protection against dismissals’, the CDU-CSU
expresses the opinion of 82% of the population against

for question 17
rCDU-CSU,17 =
82
82 + 17 · 100% ≈ 83% ,
and so on.
The frequency of representing a majority (≥ 50%) is
deﬁned to be the universality of the party. As one can see,
the CDU-CSU represents a majority on 15 questions from
32, having the degree of imperfectness 32 − 17 = 15, or
in %
UCDU-CSU = 15
32 · 100% ≈ 47% .
A higher universality means that a majority is represented
more frequently. For instance the Left-Party represents a
majority on 22 of 32 questions, having the degree of
imperfectness 32 − 22 = 10, or
ULeft-Party = 22
32 · 100% ≈ 69% .
The universality indices and the degree of imperfectness of
the parties are shown in Table II.
The representativeness indices for a coalition are com-
puted with a probabilistic model. If the coalition member
parties are unanimous on an issue, the coalition position on
the issue is as that of the member parties. If the member
parties are not unanimous, the index is computed for a lottery
of two possible decisions on the issue, with the probability
between 0.5 (absolute uncertainty) and the one which is
proportional to the size of opposing factions within the
coalition.
For the statistical test, however, a simplistic assumption
is made: the position of a coalition on a given issue is
deﬁned by a simple majority of the member parties, for
instance, if two parties out of three share the same opinion,
this opinion is adopted by the coalition. In the case of a

tie opinion in a two-party coalition, the prevailing public
opinion is assumed decisive, as if inﬂuencing the internal
coalition debate. After the positions of coalitions have been
determined, their universality and imperfectness indices are
deﬁned in the same way as for single parties. These indices
for possible two- and three-party coalitions are also shown
in Table II.
The statistical signiﬁcance of the representative capacity
of single parties and properly coalitions is shown in the last
column of Table II. Here, the representative capacity of no
party and of no three-party coalition is even 10%-statistically
signiﬁcant, to say nothing of the usual 5%-threshold. As for
two-party coalitions, the only 5%-signiﬁcant representative
capacity is inherent in the ‘politically impossible’ coalition
of the CDU-CSU with its extreme political opponent, the
Left-Party. Its 100-% universality results from our assump-
tion that in the case of tie vote the coalition position
is determined by the public opinion. On four issues the
CDU-CSU and the Left-Party share the prevailing public
opinion. On the remaining 28 issues they are opposite,
which, according to our assumption, makes the coalition’s
opinion the prevailing public opinion again. Thereby the
coalition ‘perfectly’ expresses the public opinion, which is
of course a strained conclusion.
Thus, the representative capacity of German parties is
statistically insigniﬁcant. A relatively high degree of imper-
fectness of match of their positions to the prevailing public
opinion leaves little hope that new surveys with additional
policy issues can change this conclusion. The same holds
for the party coalitions; however, with reservations caused
by a simplistic assumption of the statistical test that the
coalition member parties adopt the position on an issue by
the majority rule.
IV. DISCUSSION: AN ALTERNATIVE ELECTION METHOD
In representative democracy, political participation by
the people is realized through election of representatives.
Therefore, representative democracy is democratic to the
degree with which the elected represent the public interest.
To increase in the representativeness of a parliament,
an election procedure with an alternative architecture is
imagined. Electoral ballots are proposed to include ques-
tions about the voter’s position on key issues in candidate
manifestos (Introduce nationwide minimum wage? Yes/No,
Relax protection against employee dismissals? Yes/No, etc.).
The election method envisages processing the totality of the
ballots and evaluating candidates by the degree to which
their proﬁles match with that of the electorate as a single
body. It differs from common elections in that candidates
receive no votes. In contrast to voting based on individual
choices, this procedure implements public determination.
The embedded referenda on a sample of issues serve as
a ‘direct democracy test’ of the candidates. In a sense,
our proposal attempts to bridge direct and representative
democracies, and to make election better meet democratic
objectives.

Let us illustrate our proposal with redistributing the seats
in the German Bundestag, referring the German public
proﬁle based on 32 polls of public opinion on 32 policy
issues and the political proﬁles of the ﬁve leading German
parties shown in Figure 1. The degree of match of the
parties with the public proﬁle is expressed by the universality
indicator given in Table II.
Now we make the size of the Bundestag factions propor-
tionally to the party universality indices. For instance,

Sum of universality indices
of the ﬁve leading parties
= 17% .
The adjusted seats for the ﬁve parties are shown in the
last column of Table II. Note the increase in the Bundestag
universality displlayed in the bottom row of the table.
Of course, this is only an illustration. The procedure can
be modiﬁed arbitrarily and/or used in weighted combinations
with traditional voting schemata. More generally, one can
consider an optimization model to maximize the representa-
tiveness of the Bundestag (its universality index) by varying
the size of Bundestag factions.
V. CONCLUSIONS
Thus, the representativeness of candidates (parties) can be
accurately tested from the viewpoint of direct democracy.
They are evaluated with regard to their match-up with the
public opinion on the key issues from the candidate (party)
manifestos, declarations in medias, etc. Next, statistical con-
clusions about their representative capacity can be made. The
statistical test for individual candidates (parties) is accurate,
whereas for coalitions it is simpliﬁed: It is assumed that, on
each question at issue, the position of a coalition is made
by the majority rule within the coalition, and in the case of
a tied opinion, the prevailing public opinion is taken.
For illustration, ﬁve leading German parties and their
coalitions are evaluated. For this purpose, the positions of
the parties on over 30 topical issues, as given for the last
Bundestag (parliament) elections 2009, are compared with
results of public opinion polls. The outcomes are summa-
rized in the party indices universality (percentage of issues
with majority representation). The same is done for party
coalitions. A statistical test is developed to judge whether
the index magnitudes are sufﬁciently high to conﬁrm the
representative capacity. It is shown that the representative-
ness of German parties and their coalitions is statistically
insigniﬁcant.
