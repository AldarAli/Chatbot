Abstract - The article is focused on the possibility of using fuzzy 
logic principles in the authentication process in a computer 
network environment. Fuzzy logic could play an important 
role in authentication techniques where the input data is 
unclear or inaccurate and, therefore, the result of the process 
will also become unclear. Examples of this can be found in 
processing positional information concerning the user’s 
location at a particular moment within the authentication 
process. The paper shows a possible solution to these 
difficulties by using a location-based authentication system 
which relates to the user’s biometric data. 
Keywords - fuzzy logic; authentication; location; biometric 
data

 INTRODUCTION  
The article deals with the possibility of the usage of fuzzy 
logic in the authentication process and especially in location-
based authentication. Currently electronic systems make 
decisions exclusively by using bivalent values when they 
perform an authentication. The more native approach could 
be by using a value within a continuous interval. One of the 
sources where fuzzy logic was used is detailed  in [1]; this is 
focused on password security enhancement. 
Let us imagine a specific situation: two people talk to 
each other, the first of them declares something to the 
second. The second person has to make a decision whether 
s/he will believe this declaration or not. The decision will not 
happen with absolute certainty.  
Another aspect of the authentication process is the 
position of the authenticated user. The number of mobile 
devices such as laptops, smartphones and tablets continues to 
grow. The question “Where are you?” in the mobile 
environment is being asked more and more frequently.  This 
is where fuzzy logic could be exploited with regard to 
location-based authentication, and in the authentication 
process generally. This will have the result that the user will 
be allowed access to protected services dependent on his/her 
position and on his/her trust level. This could be achieved by 
the use of several methods, for example; assessing the age of 
the provided position information and its accuracy. 
In this article we will introduce the methodology of how 
to use fuzzy logic principles in the authentication system. 
The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2 
fuzzy logic is introduced and an overview is given 
concerning what is required for its usage in authentication 
systems. Section 3 will discuss the possibilities of how to get 
the user’s positional information and how to transfer it 
through a chain form, from user to authenticator. Section 4 
will show an example of an authentication system and an 
authentication 
terminal 
designed 
for 
location-based 
authentication. Section 5 is concerned with future work and 
issues that have to be taken into account.    
II. 
FUZZY LOGIC FUNDAMENTALS  
Fuzzy logic is an extension of set theory and logic 
operators [2].  
In comparison with classic set theory the main 
difference is membership of an element to the set. In classic 
set theory an element is a member of a set or not, no other 
option is possible. In fuzzy logic theory an element is 
mapped to a fuzzy set by usage of a membership function. 
The difference is described in (1).  
𝜇𝐾: 𝑋 → {0,1}𝜇𝐹: 𝑋 → [0; 1], 
 (1)  
  
, where μK is a membership function of classic set and 
maps elements to universe set X into two member set {0,1}. 
and μF is a membership function of fuzzy set and maps 
elements from universe set into values in the range  from 0 
to 1. This relation is depicted in the Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1.  
Fuzzy set membership function example 
In fuzzy logic, we can talk about a “linguistic variable”. 
When we consider a variable, in general, it takes numbers as 
its value. If the variable takes linguistic terms, it is called a 
“linguistic variable”.  Let us imagine the next example. We 
have a variable X called password strength, which has 
values (terms) weak (N(n)), moderate(S(n)) and secure 
(B(n)). We can define the member function for each term 
as follows.

Password strength fuzzyfication 
The fuzzy system is composed of input variables, output 
variables and inference rules. The inference rules are 
responsible for behavior of the system. Generally the rule is 
written in the form: 
If(ascendant)   then (consequent), 
 
where the ascendant is one or more logically connected 
input variables and consequent is the output variable. 
Usually a system consists of a set of rules most of the time 
in several stages. 
The logical connection of variables could represent 
Mamdani’s implication, which could be explained by the 
equation 5 and Figure 3. 
 
𝜇ℑ(𝑥1, 𝑥2) =min{𝜇𝐴(𝑥1), 𝜇𝐵(𝑥2)} 
(5) 
 
With regards to (6) the membership function of 
consequent will be cropped on layer equals to a minimum of 
values for both ascendant min(). The situation is 
illustrated in the figure 3.

Mamdani’s fuzzy implication 
In this case we need to get a numerical value of the 
output linguistic value of the defuzzyfication to be done. 
Several solutions are possible for this task. In our case we 
will use the strategy: Center of Area (COA). 
The widely used COA strategy generates the center of 
gravity of the possibility distribution of a fuzzy set (6).

III. 
USER’S POSITION  
The position information could be figured out 
absolutely or relatively.  
The relative position is stated as proximity to the object 
with a known position in the system. Objects with a known 
position are called anchor points in the system. This way of 
how gaining information concerning a position is suitable 
especially in a Global System for Mobile Communications 
(GSM) network. Here the user’s position is estimated by 
exploiting the known position of the Base Transceiver 
Station (BTS), in the network where there is a mobile 
terminal connected [3]. This kind of localization is 
mentioned in references [1], [2], [3]. 
The second way is possible by using an absolute 
position. Information about the position consists of two or 
three coordinates. This way is usually used in cartography 
or in the Global Positioning System (GPS). 
In the authentication and authorization process, we can 
consider both kinds of  interpretation concerning the user’s 
position. 
In certain cases it is not necessary to use an absolute 
position. If we know the user is located in the proximity of 
an anchor point it could be sufficient information. The 
accuracy of the position information decreases with 
increasing distance from the anchor point. 
In the Figure 4 you can see a basic schematic of the 
principle of relative positioning, as previously described in 
[6]. The shaded area is a room covered by the signal from

the anchor point (xAP, yAP and zAP are coordinates of the 
anchor point’s position). Between the authenticator and 
anchor point there has to be the establishment of mutual 
trust, it means the authenticator believes in the information 
form of the anchor point and vice-versa. If the user is in the 
signal range of the anchor point, it means it has to be able to 
communicate with the anchor point.  If the user’s terminal 
claims to the authenticator it is located near to the anchor 
point, the authenticator is able to validate this claim by the 
authenticator.

The relative positioning principle 
In the rest of the paper we will consider the next sources 
for localization that could be used as position formation 
sources in an authentication terminal. For outdoor usage it 
would be a GPS receiver and a terminal GSM module. 
Exclusively for indoor usage it will be a module with a 
wireless interface regards corresponding to IEEE 802.11. 
IV. 
THE AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM  
In relation to the previous sections, here is an example of 
an authentication system concerning the processing of a 
user’s positional information. Below is a list of steps which 
should be gone through in the design period.  
Description - in this step there should be a general 
description of the behavior of future system.  
Authentication techniques - all considered authentication 
techniques should be considered. 
Relations – all relations between used authentication 
techniques should be specified. 
Splitting, used techniques – all listed techniques in the 
second step should be split into two groups. The first group 
will be formed by techniques performed in an authentication 
terminal and the second in an authenticator.    
Difficulty – we should imagine how strong each 
technique is and also how trusted it is as well. 
Influences – all the main influences for used techniques, 
which could have an impact on the authentication process 
have to be taken into account.  
Quantification - all listed influences should receive a 
value which describes its importance. 
Scheme assembly – with regards to the list of 
authentication techniques, their relations and splitting into 
two sites schemes of how a whole system could be 
assembled. 
Fuzzyfication – all input and output variables with their 
influences have to be transformed to linguistic variables   
Inference rules – the behavior of the whole system and 
especially output variables are dependent on used rules.  
An example is given below detailing an authentication 
system which performs a strong authentication where the 
user’s position is one of the processed factors. 
A user will use an authentication terminal (Figure 5) to 
prove its identity to the authenticator. The authentication 
terminal contains modules for the determination of position 
such as: GPS receiver, terminal GSM or radio interface IEEE 
802.11. Because we need to prove the user’s position we 
have to demonstrate the user is in the same place as the 
authentication terminal. The authentication terminal uses a 
fingerprint reader for this task, as well as a tested biometric 
authentication technique [6]. Positional data is not sent to the 
authenticator until the fingerprint is checked. The 
authentication terminal is assigned to the concrete user (it’s 
personalized by a fingerprint and encryption key KEY and 
password).  Data is encrypted by an encryption key (unique 
for the terminal) is transmitted from the terminal to the 
authenticator. Note, we assume using AES128 or AES256 as  
secure enough encryption algorithms [6]. It means each 
terminal could be used as a unique token in the system and 
works as an additional authentication factor. Positional data 
is strongly related to the time when the positional data was 
created. In the Figure 5 you can see several sources of time 
information.

The authenticator which stores the user’s profile is on 
the other side. The user’s profile holds all the necessary data 
for the user for defined locations (from where the user could 
be authenticated), encryption key, password etc. The 
schematic of the authenticator is illustrated in Figure 6. All 
necessary data is stored in a knowledge base, also inference 
rules or amplification coefficients AX. Each subsystem on 
Figure 6 is a fuzzy system which performs the 
authentication of a specific factor (for example, subsystem 
GPS processes data from the GPS receiver).    
 
 
Figure 6.

The behavior of the whole system is defined by 
inference rules which are part of the knowledge base. The 
rule is described in section 2 and it usually takes the form of   
a “if then” condition. Table 1 lists the top level rules for the 
authenticator for evaluating the state of positional 
information.

The result of the processing of the submitted 
authentication data is the level of trust that the user has 
identified which he claims and he is in the location where he 
claims. How the level is varied with different input data can 
be seen in Figure 7. The result in Figure 7 is based on the 
application inference rules set (table 1) and provided by 
Matlab. There we can see how trust concerning positional 
information POSITION is dependent on the results from the 
subsystems, in this case from the GSM subsystem GSM and 
the IEEE 802.11 subsystem IEEE80.11. We can see the 
highest value of POSITION is in the case when both of the 
input values are also in high values. This is the simplest 
example of dependence but could vary with different 
inference 
rules 
according 
to 
authentication 
system 
requirements.

This radio is able to list Media Access Control (MAC) 
and addresses devices in the neighborhood with their 
appropriate Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). 
Two modules have been chosen from Quectel. The first one 
is the GPS receiver L76 and the second one is the GSM 
module M95.  The board is equipped with five buttons, user 
defined functions and an LCD with a resolution of 240 x 320 
pixels. As was mentioned previously the board contains a 
fingerprint reader: FPC-AM3 from Fingerprint.

CONCLUSION 
The article deals with the possibility of using fuzzy logic 
principles in the authentication process in a computer 
network environment. The basic idea is make the result of 
the authentication process more diffusive with regards to 
vague input data (authentication factors). Presently systems 
produce a result in bivalent logic as “Yes/No” or 
“True/False”. In many cases the right one is somewhere in 
the middle. This could be correct especially in the 
evaluation of positional information, this means where an 
authenticated user is located. This information could be 
unclear or inaccurate and therefore, the result will also be 
unclear or inaccurate. Fuzzy logic could represent a possible 
way of how to control a system with vague values. 
The focus is on positional information. We introduce a 
GPS receiver or GSM terminal as positional information 
sources in the authentication process. We also introduce the 
idea of relating positional information with a human 
biometric element for strong authentication (the user has to 
be in the same place as the authentication terminal). 
Next, the paper presents a possible way of how to set up 
a basic authentication model step by step. Further to this the 
example of an authentication system is presented. For 
testing purposes the development board of an authentication 
terminal was designed and realized. 
Future work will be aimed at testing the presented 
principles in a real environment. Although the basic 
principles were verified in a previous version of an 
authentication terminal, our next work will focus on the 
implementation of advance techniques related to positional 
information.
