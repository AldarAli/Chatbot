Abstract—Phishing is one of the leading cyber attack vectors 
against businesses and consumers. President Biden signed an 
Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity in 
May of 2021. The Administration followed up with 
Memorandum M-22-09, which in addition to laying out a Zero 
Trust strategy for the federal government to follow, also 
provides special emphasis on phishing resistant systems such 
as MFA. This paper provides a literature review of phishing 
resistant systems and covers Microsoft solutions for the 
enterprise, eliminating passwords as specified in the Web 
Authentication API and FIDO 2 standards. Research into how 
threat actors accomplish phishing schemes is examined, along 
with email authentication (Sender Policy Framework, SPK; 
Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM); and the Domain-Based 
Message 
Authentication, 
Reporting 
and 
Conformance 
(DMARC) standard). Browser-based detection systems are 
also reviewed, along with phishing intelligence databases that 
developers can integrate into their applications.  
Keywords—phishing; phishing-resistant; FIDO; SPK; DKIM; 
DMARC;  Defender.

INTRODUCTION
On May 12th of 2021, President Biden signed EO 
14208, Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s 
Cybersecurity. The Executive Order directs federal 
agencies 
to 
enhance 
cybersecurity 
through 
several 
initiatives [1]. One of the specific initiatives spelled out in 
the EO is that within 180 days agencies must adopt Multi-
factor Authentication (MFA). The White House followed 
up with Memorandum M-2209 in January of 2022, spelling 
out a Zero Trust strategy and placing special emphasis on 
the use of phishing-resistant MFA that protects users from 
cyberattacks [2]. The Memorandum defines phishing 
resistant 
authentication 
as 
“authentication 
processes 
designed to detect and prevent disclosure of authentication 
secrets 
and 
outputs 
to 
a 
website 
or 
application 
masquerading 
as 
a 
legitimate 
system,”[2]. 
The 
Memorandum notes that some MFA approaches do not 
protect against sophisticated attacks since they can spoof 
applications and interact dynamically with users.
For 
example, users can be fooled into issuing a one-time code 
or responding to a security prompt that grants access to the 
attacker. The Federal Government’s Personal Identity 
Verification (PIV) card protects against these types of 
attacks. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)’s web
authentication standard is another approach that is effective 
that will be discussed later.

LITERATURE REVIEW
A. Discussion 
The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) noted in 
their Phishing Activity Trends Report for Q3, 2021 that 
webmail and Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) providers 
accounted for 29.1% of phishing attacks [3].  Figure 1 
shows the most targeted industries [3]. 
Fig 1.  Most Targeted Industries, 3Q 2021 as originally published [3]
Younis and Musbah [4] note that smishing or SMS 
phishing is an attack that uses the SMS service that is an 
appealing attack vector for cybercriminals. Two-factor 
authentication (2FA) uses a hardware token, USB key, QR 
scan, one-time password, push notification, or contextual 
awareness to authenticate [5].  However, some 2FA 
approaches are vulnerable since they do not verify the 
webpage that the user is interacting with.  In this attack, the 
user is tricked into entering the 2FA credentials into a 
counterfeit website.  There are emerging protocols, such as 
FIDO (covered later) that help protect against this type of 
9

runtime phishing, which is where a user discloses their 
credentials and second factor codes to the adversary.  
Phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails to 
lure you into providing credentials such as login 
information, passwords, and other sensitive information. 
This paper focuses primarily on phishing resistant 
techniques and technologies that provide a control against 
phishing emails. The paper also looks at technologies that 
can protect again malicious links or websites.     
According to Dooremaal, et al. [6], phishing detection 
technologies that protect against fraudulent websites can be 
grouped into three categories:  (1) list-based, (2) visual 
similarity-based, and (3) heuristic-based [6].  List-based 
approaches look at the URL of the website a user is visiting 
and compare that to a list of known phishing/malicious 
websites (called a block list) or a list of known legitimate 
websites (called an allow list).  There are several anti-
phishing websites such as, OpenPhish, PhishTank, and 
PhishStats.  The main issue with list-based approaches is 
that they are not effective against zero-day attacks and these 
data sources need to be constantly updated to be useful.  
Han et al. found that some sites can take up to twenty days 
to add a site to their list [7].  Visual similarity-based 
alternatives utilize content on the website to determine its 
legitimacy. Techniques include examining the favicon 
(small image next to the website title), examining the logo 
or comparing screenshots of two websites to determine if 
one is trying to imitate the other. Heuristic-based 
approaches analyze features extracted from a website, such 
as the presence of an SSL certificate [7].  
This research looks at a sampling of academic papers 
consisting of sixteen papers. The research did not take into 
consideration the number of surveys that have been 
conducted on phishing attacks.  The papers were selected 
from cybersecurity databases such as Communications & 
Mass 
Media 
Complete, 
Telecommunications, 
ABI/INFORM Collection, ABI/INFORM Dateline, ACM 
Digital Library, and IEEE Computer Society.  Keywords 
included phishing, phishing resistant, FIDO, authentication, 
MFA, 2FA, and others.  Each paper was aligned to one of 
the four categories (compromised CSP, fraudulent website, 
stolen credentials and phishing emails) based on the 
discussion and results section of the paper.  
B.
Microsoft Phishing Resistant Solutions 
There are configurations within Microsoft 365 and 
Exchange to enable anti-phishing settings [8].  Microsoft 
offers Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Exchange 
Online Protection (EOP).  EOP is a cloud-based filtering 
service that protects against spam, malware, and other 
threats [9]. EOP works by routing each message through
filters that check for sender’s reputation, malware, mail
flow rules that the organization may have set up, and then 
delivered to the recipient, assuming no malicious content 
has been found.  EOP utilizes the following [9]:  
• URL block lists that help detect known malicious 
links within messages.  
• List of domains that are known to send spam.  
• Multiple anti-malware engines.  
• Inspects the active payload in the message body and 
all message attachments for malware.  
Fig 2.  EOP Processing Email as originally published [8]
Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is a standalone 
product that builds on the protection afforded in EOP.  
Defender adds safe attachment scanning (for malware), 
URL scanning and real-time scanning of suspected links, 
anti-phishing 
protection 
(impersonation 
protection, 
protected users–specify email addresses that are protected 
from 
impersonation, 
and 
domain 
protection) 
[10].  
Defender also adds post-breach investigation, hunting and 
response tools that allow administrators to see malware 
detected by the program, view phishing URLs, automate an 
investigation and response process, and investigate 
malicious emails [10]. It should be noted that the researcher 
did not test the effectiveness of these technical solutions.   
C.
Eliminating Passwords 
One phishing resistant solution involves eliminating 
passwords.  Passwords are a critical element in a phishing 
attack; so eliminating them goes a long way towards 
thwarting a phishing attack.  The Web Authentication API, 
known as WebAuthn, is a specification developed by the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the FIDO 
Alliance [11].  The API provides a mechanism for servers 
to register and authenticate users utilizing public key 
encryption instead of a password.  It works with
authentication systems that are built into devices such as 
Windows Hello and Apple’s Touch ID.  During registration 
a public/private key pair is created for a website.  The user 
can use a FIDO Compliant authentication app or an
10

SECURWARE 2022 : The Sixteenth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

external authenticator.  The private key is stored securely 
on the device.  Other sensitive information such as 
fingerprint and face ID data never leave the device.  The 
server retains the user’s public key and a randomly 
generated credential ID.  The server uses the public key and 
credential ID to validate and authenticate a user to its 
services.  The private key is never shared, and the public 
key is worthless without the corresponding private key [11].  
Typically, a server would request a user ID and password 
from a user, which it would store online.  A threat actor 
could seal the credentials from the server or with phishing, 
obtain the credentials from the user.  Utilizing WebAuthn, 
when a user needs to access a web server, it sends a 
signature which is created with the private key.  The server 
verifies the signature with the user’s public key that was 
created during registration.   
FIDO implementation comes in two forms:  Platform 
authenticators are those that are embedded in a device such 
as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.  Many times, these 
devices have built-in biometric capabilities like Touch ID, 
Face ID and Windows Hello.  FIDO supports Windows, 
Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, and Android.  Cross-platform 
authenticators are external, physical devices that support 
USB, NFC, and Bluetooth [12].  FIDO supports biometrics 
including face, voice, iris, fingerprint, etc. [13]. FIDO keys 
include products from Yubico, Thetis, Google Titan, and 
Kensington, to name a few.  
The FIDO Alliance is an industry association that is 
focused on reducing the reliance on passwords.  FIDO 
stands for Fast Identity Online. FIDO has developed several 
specifications and standards, including FIDO and FIDO2.  
FIDO2 is the update to FIDO and was released in 2018.  
The main component of FIDO is WebAuthn.  WebAuthn 
provides  
browser-based  
support  for  
web  
authentication. 
FIDO2 
also 
utilizes 
the 
Client-to 
Authenticator Protocol (CTAP), which allows for external 
authenticators, 
such 
as 
USB, 
NFC 
(Near 
Field 
Communication), or BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) [14]. 
There is a growing number of companies that support FIDO 
including Apple, AWS, Coinbase, Dashlane, Dropbox, 
Ebay, Facebook, GitHub, GoDaddy, Google, Login.Gov, 
Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Twitter, and Yahoo [14].  
Miriam, et al. [15] researched how threat actors 
accomplish phishing schemes by posing as buyers in black-
market services. They found five types of email lures:  
impersonating an associate, a stranger, a bank, Google, or a 
government authority.  All of the services utilized domain 
squatting–registering and utilizing an internet domain name 
with the intent of profiting off of someone else’s trademark 
(Nolo, n.d.).  The threat actors were able to capture 
passwords in six out of nine attempts and immediately used 
the credentials to log in to the victim’s account.  Where 
2FA was activated, the hackers sent subsequent phishing 
messages to victims asking for their
phone number.
Clicking on the link in the phishing message led to a 
fraudulent page that requested the 2FA code that was sent 
to the victim’s phone.  When the researchers inputted the 
2FA code into the fraudulent page, the hackers were able to 
successfully log in [15]. The researchers noted that 2FA 
adds “friction” to attacks.  Some dark web services noted 
that they could not access accounts without the victim’s 
phone number and then had to add additional phishing 
messages to obtain the 2FA code, which added complexity 
to their attack [15].  
MFA (and 2FA) are not without their flaws.  Hendricks 
and Kettani [17] note that biometrics data is stored in a 
database and attackers could target those databases and use 
the biometrics to pass MFA. Further, threat actors have 
been successful in impersonating customers and resetting 
accounts and moving cell phone numbers to different SIM 
cards.  Once that happens, the hacker can have the 2FA 
code sent to the new phone number [17]. Setting up an 
account PIN or some other form of identification is the best 
way to protect against this kind of vulnerability.    
Razaq et al. [18] found that some threat actors mask 
fraudulent phone numbers by tricking victims into saving 
phone numbers as contacts so future calls from that number 
appear 
legitimate. 
Haworth 
defines 
Multi-factor 
authentication (MFA) fatigue as “the name given to a 
technique used by adversaries to flood a user’s 
authentication app with push notifications in the hope they 
will accept and therefore enable an attacker to gain entry to 
an account or device,” [19]. Threat actors have been 
observed using multiple authentication attempts in short 
succession against accounts that have MFA enabled.  This 
technique, otherwise known as push notification spamming, 
works because users are often distracted or overwhelmed 
with notifications and will silence the authentication 
requests by approving the request [20]. Office 365 can limit 
these requests by configuring the default limits to the MFA 
service.  Additionally, customers can utilize Microsoft 
Authenticator app, which works by providing a unique two-
digit number that must be confirmed by inputting the 
number into the app.  The authenticator app also supports 
industry standard time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP or 
OTP).    
D. Email Authentication 
By default, email headers and body are not encrypted 
or protected cryptographically.  Thus, the sender’s address 
is not a reliable verification of the sender’s identity.  There 
are, however, several methods that can be utilized to 
authenticate the sender [21]:  
• 
The 
Sender 
Policy 
Framework 
(SPF) 
allows 
administrators to authorize hosts that are allowed to 
send mail.  
• 
The Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM) is a standard 
that provides outgoing email messages with a digital 
11
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2022.     ISBN:  978-1-68558-007-0
SECURWARE 2022 : The Sixteenth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

signature.  Recipients can use the signature to verify 
the validity of the sender.    
• 
The Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting 
and Conformance (DMARC) standard builds on SPF 
and DKIM by providing a protocol for sender 
authentication and provides guidance on how to deal 
with a message that fails the SPF or DKIM test.    
Adoption rates for these standards and protocols are 
low; Hu et al. [22] noted a 44.9% adoption rate in 2018 for 
SPF and 5.1% for DMARC. A 2019 study by 250ok found 
that 91.4% of non-profits have no DMARC policy in place 
despite holding a significant amount of PII [23].  Further, 
only 23% of Fortune 500 companies have some form of 
DMARC policy in place.  Tatang et al. [23] noted that most 
email providers utilized some form of authentication.  Their 
study revealed that out of 25 free email service providers, 
only one did not support SPF; DKIM was supported in 18 
out of 25 service providers; and 14 out of 25 supported 
DMARC [24].  Hu et al. [22] noted a number of technical 
weaknesses with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC that impacted 
adoption of these standards and protocols.  Table 1 displays 
these weaknesses.  
TABLE I. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC TECHNICAL WEAKNESSES 
[22] 
As noted in Table 1, the sender’s domain can be 
different from what the end user sees.  Figure 3 displays 
how SPF authentication focuses on the return-path domain, 
which can be different from what the user sees [22].  
Fig 3.  Return path Domain is Different that the Domain 
Displayed to User as originally published [22]
Additionally, the researchers found that administrators 
shared implementation challenges as well, such as, lack of 
control of their DNS servers [22].
E. Browser-Based Phishing Detection 
Modern web browsers utilize safe browsing, which are 
a set of security measures that work to prevent unauthorized 
activity while an end user surfs the web. Safe browsing 
should protect against hackers, vulnerabilities, and online 
exploits.  Google’s Safe Browsing service that checks 
website URLs against a database of known malicious sites 
that is updated every 30 minutes [25]. Chrome actually 
samples a website’s color profile and compares those to 
known phishing domains.  Chrome counts basic colors in 
each pixel and stores the count in hashmaps.  According to 
Google, image-based phishing is up to 50 times faster at the 
50th percentile [25].  Apple’s browser, Safari, also uses 
Google’s Safe Browsing, as does Firefox, Chrome and 
Brave.    
Some browsers offer third-party add-ons that provide 
anti-phishing toolbars and indicators to warn users of 
malicious sites. Research has shown, however, that these 
tools do not protect users against high-quality phishing 
attacks, and that users typically do not pay much attention 
to browser warnings [21]. Kaushik et al. [25] have found 
that hackers can take advantage of browser extensions to 
steal credentials, deliver malware, change browser settings, 
modify user interface elements, and substitute web content. 
The researchers noted that there are third-party applications 
that can scan an extension to see if it is legitimate or not.  
One such tool is Ext Analysis.  While this tool can help 
prevent the installation of malicious extensions, they are 
time consuming to use and would need to be deployed on 
an 
enterprise 
level.  
F. Phishing Intelligence Databases 
There are several phishing intelligence databases that 
capture information on cloned websites. OpenPhish 
provides phishing feeds and has several developer plans 
that can get updates from 12 hours to (free) to five minutes 
(subscription) [27].  The site also offers an API that 
developers can use to integrate the searching of malicious 
URLs into a custom program.  PhishTank is a collaborative 
clearing house for phishing data, which also provides an 
open API for developers to utilize [28]. PhishStats is a third 
dataset that is updated every 90 minutes. Developers can 
use an API as well [28]. All of these sites are useful but do 
not protect against zero day phishing exploits that have yet 
to be reported.  
Figure 4 notes the top impersonated brands for 
December 2021 according to OpenPhish [30].

ANALYSIS
The intent is to identify new or variants of a tactic or 
technique as well as new or updated mitigation strategies. 
The sample of academic research consisted of sixteen 
papers. The papers were selected from cybersecurity 
databases such as Communications & Mass Media 
Complete, Telecommunications, ABI/INFORM Collection, 
ABI/INFORM Dateline, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE 
Computer Society.  Keywords included phishing, phishing 
resistant, FIDO, authentication, MFA, 2FA, and others.  
Each paper was aligned to one of the four categories based 
on the discussion and results section of the paper.  
70% of the academic papers reviewed fell into two of 
the four categories:  fraudulent website and compromised 
credentials. 25% of the academic papers fell into the 
phishing email category.   
Fig 5.  Academic Papers Reviewed.
IV.
PASSWORDLESS AUTHENTICATION
Since the literature review of phishing resistant 
systems was completed, a new entrant is making its way to 
the market.  As of September of 2022, passwordless 
authentication is being adopted by a number of vendors [5]. 
Passkeys are a fido authentication credential that provides 
passwordless entry to online systems [31].  Support for 
passkeys [6] has been announced by Apple, Google, and  
Microsoft. Passkeys utilize biometrics or a pin to 
authentication [32].  Apple integrates Touch ID or Face ID 
into passkeys and makes it simple to log into a website [7]. 
Passkeys are synced across user’s Apple devices and are 
encrypted (even Apple [8] does not know that encryption 
password), [33].  Microsoft utilizes Microsoft Hello for 
Business, their Authenticator app [9], and fido2 security 
keys to implement passwordless authentication [10][34].  
Google has also expressed support for fido passwordless 
authentication and will utilized passkeys stored on mobile 
phones and synced to the cloud for authentication [11] [35] 
V. CONCLUSION
The purpose of this study was to review the literature 
of phishing resistant systems.  The author reviewed 16 
papers and categorized them into four categories:  
Fraudulent 
website, 
compromised 
credentials, 
Compromised CSP, and Phishing Emails.  The literature 
review revealed that there is no single product that 
provides full protection against phishing attacks.  This 
study is limited in some ways. The scope of the literature 
review only contained 16 papers. A future study could 
further expand the number of papers reviewed and map 
the literature review to the MITRE ATT&CK and 
D3FEND frameworks.  The most exciting technology to 
prevent phishing is undoubtedly passwordless systems.  
With support from the fido Alliance, and the big three 
tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, and Google) the impact 
of passwordless authentication should significantly reduce 
phishing initiated attacks.
