INTRODUCTION
It is important to analyze the radio channel parameters
from the latest high-speed wireless communication [1]. A
sharp demand for wireless communications requires the
development and optimization of the next generation mobile
communication system. Development of efficient frequency
use and study of a wireless transmission technology having
high competitiveness is based on the understanding of the
correct
radio
channel
characteristics.
Radio
channel
characteristics are based on the channel parameter analysis.
Channel parameter analysis is helpful in understanding the
characteristics of the propagation channel space and have a
significant impact on the design of the mobile system.
Current wireless channel models were established through
measurement of a wide range of channel 800MHz ~ 2.5GHz
band. Typically, it is used to establish, based on the channel
model for the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
standard channel model [2]. Propagation Modeling and
Analysis for the current below 6GHz band is being studied in
major countries such as the United States, Europe, Japan
progress. In addition, the international standards organization
[ITU, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE),
3rd
Generation
Partnership
Project
(3GPP),
WINNER] has proposed a standard and modeling results of
the analysis method [3].
Recently,
many
countries
and
international
standardization organizations are working to examine the
next-generation mobile (5G) wireless communication system
using a range of frequencies below 6GHz. Therefore, it is
determined that the prior studies of the same frequency band
are necessary in Korea. International standards organizations
have classified bandwidth utilization as high as 3GHz ~
4GHz frequency among the next generation of mobile
communications. In this paper, the selection of a 3.5GHz
band and the analysis of the propagation characteristics of
the channel parameters are measured and presented based on
the correlation between the parameters. Analysis of the
channel in such an environment will facilitate the system
design of future communication systems.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is an

with
related measurement data; Section 4 provides a summary and
conclusions of the this paper.

MEASUREMENT SYSTEM
A. System environments
This study analyzes the propagation characteristics in the
frequency band of 3.5GHz for a 5-generation wireless
mobile communication system. We focused on the primary
channel characterization of the physical channel. Hence, we
constructed

measurement
system
to
analyze
the
propagation characteristics.
We took our measurements on the Dunsan area using
1×1 antennas and a channel sounder from the Korea
Electronics
and
Telecommunications
Research

B. Measurement Scenario
In
this
study,
we
measured
the
propagation
characteristics. Our selected area was Dunsan, characterized
by an urban environment within about 1 km. Figure 2 shows
an aerial photograph of the building location and the area of
the measurement region. A Base Station (BS), as shown in
Table 1, is installed in the antenna height of 7.3m and a
Mobile Station (MS) has been set on top of the roof of a car
at 2m. MS is moving along a path within 500m around the
BS, measuring the radio wave, and storing the measured
data. We analyze the channel parameters based on the stored
data.

CHANNEL CHARACTERISTIC ANALYSIS
A. Path Loss (PL)
Signal passing through a radio channel results in path
loss. When the path loss is caused by the encounter, each
reflection, diffraction, scattering will have a different value
according to the surrounding environment and the distance
between the transceiver. The power value changes according
to the distance and has the following distribution [4].
ܲ௅(݀) = ܮ଴−10݈݊݋݃ଵ଴ ൬
ௗ
ௗ೏೐೑൰ + ܺఙ             (1) 
where L0 is the initial value, and n is the index of the
path-loss. Figure 3 illustrates the received power according
to the distance measured from Dunsan area.
The measured reception power value is reduced to a
logarithmic function type according to distance. This is
meant to increase their element to interrupt the flow of the
radio wave according to the distance between the transmitter
and the receiver. In fact, the high buildings and large floating
population and vehicle were acting as impediments.
The received power value measured in the region Dunsan
follows the following distribution.
ܲ௅೏(݀) = 20.06 − 4.204 × 10 ݈݋݃ଵ଴ ൬
ௗ
ௗ೏೐೑൰ + 8.91 (2)
Figure 3.
Path loss according to the distance
Figure 2 shows the distance away from the BS that tends
to be much higher with respect to the number of buildings.
Figure 3 shows the tendency on the received power
distribution to increase with the distance; at 500m point, the
power received shows a big difference of 40dbm.
B. Delay Spread (DS)
Delay
spread
is
due
to
multipath
reflections
and
influences the Inter Symbol Interference (ISI). Therefore, the
maximum data rates on the communication applications
could be limited by ISI.
Time delay spread is derived by calculating the signal
level and the noise signal over a reference impulse signal. 1
sample corresponds to 0.48 us and multiplies the time and

Delay value [5].

The RMS delay spread is defined as the square root of
the second central moment of the Mean Excess Delay.
Figure 4 shows the RMS delay spread in our scenario.
Figure 4.
RMS Delay Spread according to the distance
As expected, the highest delay spreads are found mostly
because of its high density of scattering.
C. K-factor
In many radio environments, the complex path gain
consists of a fixed component plus a zero-mean fluctuating
component. The ratio of the fixed and fluctuating power
components is defined as the K-factor [6].
K[dB] = 10݈݋݃ଵ଴

Figure 5.
K-factor according to the distance
where c2 is the power of the LOS component and 2σ2 is 
the power of the NLOS component. The K-factor is an
important parameter in a wireless channel system since it
defines the power probability of the LOS component. The
results are shown in Figure 5; they are calculated by the
measured
data is
K-factor and
tend
to
be inversely
proportional with the distance. This means that, according to
the increasing distance, the LOS signal component is
reduced.
D. Channel Capacity
To derive the channel capacitor of performance in a
wireless channel, the channel capacity from SISO radio
channel is calculated by the following formula [7].
C = ݈݋݃ଶ(1 +ߛ)=݈݋݃ଶ ቀ1 +
௉೟
ఙ೙మ |ℎ|ଶቁ
(5)
where γ denotes the total received signal-to-noise ratio 
and h represents the channel.
Figure 6 shows the cumulative distribution probability
according to the channel capacity. Blue, red and black lines
represent SNR 0, 10, 20dB, respectively. It can be seen that
the channel capacitor is proportional to the SNR.
Figure 6.

E. Correlation Channel Parameters
The correlation of the parameters observed in the
measured data is reflected in joint power or probability
distributions.

where Cxy is the cross-covariance of channel parameters
x and y. The correlation between the different channel
parameters is an important property when developing and
evaluating channel models. The correlation coefficients for
all of the combinations of the estimated channel parameters
are shown in Figure 8. Figure 9 presents the analysis data
from a similar environment at 300 MHz [8]. We can see a
positive correlation in our scenario between the K-factor and
DS in Figure 7.

Correlation Coefficients
Figure 9.
Correlation Coefficients (300MHz)[8]
The correlation between the channel parameters is shown
by the channel characteristic in the measured scenario.
Generally, the DS values are observed to have a positive
correlation, and the PL and K-factors are observed to have a
negative correlation, according to the distance. The reduction
of overall power explains the negative correlation of the PL
and distance. The reduction of the LOS signal explains the
negative correlation of the K-factor and distance. The
strongest correlations between the distance and PL are
observed in scenario. In this scenario, DS correlation value
for PLs is -0.82. We can see a similar correlation between
PLs and the DS when measured at 300MHz, -0.74. This
means that the measurement environment seems similar
according to distance. However, the correlation between
distance and PLs exposes the difference between the Korean
environment and the Swedish environment, are -0.65 and -
0.87, respectively. The difference in the two environments is
closely associated with the landscape, surroundings, and
temperature. The amplitude of the multipath components is
frequency
dependent,
resulting
in
different
fading
characteristics
in
the
channel
and
also
the
channel
parameters.
IV.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented the correlation between
channel parameters at 3.5GHz, which is an important
frequency
band
for
radio
services
and
new
mobile
communication. It was measured according to a receiver path
in
an
urban
area
environment.
We
derived
channel
parameters, such as path loss, delay spread and K-factor for
SISO wireless system from the measured data. Also, the
correlation coefficients of the channel parameters were
derived
for
the
urban
environment.
High
negative
correlations between DS and PL are observed in this urban
scenario. It means the generation of a large path loss. Similar
correlations can be found with measurements at 300 MHz.
But, the correlation between distance and k-factor shows the
difference between the Korean environment and the Swedish
environment.
This
difference
shows
the
measurement
frequency band and the difference between Korean and
Swedish environments. Generalizations should be explained
from the environment structure, propagation mechanism, and
the inclusion of other related measurement results, which
should be done in the future.
