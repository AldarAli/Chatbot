Abstract—We introduce a new reduced-Hamiltonian scheme for 
realizing universal quantum computing in strongly coupled 
multi-qubit systems. This technique provides analytic solutions to 
the time evolution of the system, so that experimentalists can 
easily chose system parameters to realize desired quantum gates. 
We show how to implement arbitrary controlled-unitary 
operations in a one-dimensional nearest-neighbor architecture by 
deriving system parameters to achieve these operations. The key 
feature of the scheme is that all gate operations are realized by 
varying only a single control parameter, which greatly reduces 
the circuit complexity. Furthermore, we do not require the ability 
to tune couplings during a computation. We also show how the 
scheme can be extended to realize a controlled-unitary operation, 
involving N control qubits and one target qubit, in a single pulse.

 INTRODUCTION 
A quantum computer comprises several qubits interacting 
with each other. Most schemes for implementing a quantum 
computer in different physical quantum systems are nearest-
neighbor (NN), which comprise one- and two-dimensional 
arrays of qubits where each qubit interacts only with the qubits 
adjacent to it [1-26]. In these systems, when performing single- 
and multi-qubit gate operations, if the interactions are not 
turned off, the evolution of the qubit on which the gate 
operation is performed is affected by the other qubits it is 
coupled to. As a result, a number of methods for isolating a 
qubit from its neighbors, by shutting off the coupling, have 
been devised in various quantum systems [12-19, 27-34]. For 
instance, in phosphorus doped silicon systems, a method is 
employed of applying voltage biases to surface control 
electrodes, in order to vary the exchange coupling between 
neighboring donor atoms [27]. In GaAs/AlGaAs electron spin 
quantum dots, the strength of the exchange interaction, which 
depends 
on 
the 
overlap 
of 
the 
respective 
electron 
wavefunctions, is varied by changing the voltage applied to the 
gate controlling the tunnel barrier between the two dots [17]. In 
charge qubits, nearest neighbors are coupled via loop-shaped 
electrodes with Josephson junctions (JJs) at the loop 
intersections, where the bias currents through the coupling JJs 
serve as interaction control knobs [19]. In coupled quantum dot 
molecules, the coupling is switched off by grounding metal 
film electrodes between two qubits which turns off the 
Coulomb interaction between qubits [26]. While all these 
methods 
of 
switching 
couplings 
facilitate 
multi-qubit 
operations, there are disadvantages in using tunable coupling. 
The ability to switch couplings usually involves performing 
fast changes in the qubit parameters or using additional circuit 
elements, both of which increase the complexity of the 
experimental set-up and open the system to noise.  
A desirable alternative to the ability to switch couplings is 
to devise methods for performing computations with always-on 
interactions, wherein the ability to tune couplings is no longer 
required. To this end, a number of schemes have been proposed 
[33-41]. In [35], Zhou et al. devised a two-dimensional 
architectural scheme for universal and scalable quantum 
computation where the coupling between encoded qubits are 
effectively turned on and off by computing in and out of 
carefully designed interaction free subspaces analogous to 
decoherence free subspaces. In [36], Benjamin et al. showed 
how to perform computations along a one-dimensional array by 
tuning the Zeeman transition energies of individual qubits. 
Recently, schemes employing global control have been 
proposed [37, 38] and implemented in optical systems [39] and 
antiferromagnetic spin rings [40]. While each of these methods 
allows us to perform computations without having to switch 
couplings, each method has its own disadvantages. From a 
practical standpoint, the scheme in [35] is complex in terms of 
the 
two-dimensional 
physical 
arrangement 
of 
qubits, 
initialization, and the steps involved in generating gates. The 
scheme in [36] requires placing intervening qubits in definite 
classical states in order to negate the residual Ising interaction, 
thereby increasing the computational overhead. The scheme in 
[37], which uses translation-invariant operations to perform 
universal quantum computations, has a constant spatial and 
linear temporal overhead. 
In this paper, we present a new reduced-Hamiltonian 
scheme for implementing universal quantum computing in 
strongly coupled systems. The technique works in both NN and 
non-NN architectures, and without having to shut off the 
coupling between qubits. In systems with switchable 
interactions, the couplings can be tuned to desired values at the 
start of a computation. These couplings, once set, will not be 
varied during the computation. The main advantage of our 
scheme is that it is simple and efficient, because only a single 
control parameter is pulsed high for all gate operations. The 
number of pulses for a gate operation varies depending on the 
number of qubits involved in the gate operation. For instance, 
in a one-dimensional Linear NN (LNN) array, a three-qubit 
Toffoli gate requires one pulse, a two-qubit CNOT gate

requires two pulses, and a single qubit gate requires four 
pulses. In this work, we first describe how to implement gate 
operations in a one-dimensional LNN architecture. We include 
the effects of finite rise and fall times due to non-ideal pulses 
on gate operations. Next, we extend the scheme to show how a 
controlled-unitary operation with multiple controls and a single 
target qubit can be realized in a single pulse. Unlike previous 
schemes [35, 36], our method does not require encoding 
physical qubits into logical qubits. Neither does it require 
separating qubit-bearing spins by passive “barrier” spins [37], 
thereby, significantly minimizing the computational overhead. 
 
Figure 1. Linear nearest-neighbor array of qubits where each qubit is only 
coupled to the two qubits adjacent to it. Here, the circles represent individual 
qubits and the squares represent the couplings between qubits. There are two 
coupling constants, 1 and 2, which alternate along the length of the chain. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
describe how to implement gate operations in an LNN 
architecture. We show how to reduce the Hamiltonian of a 
three-qubit system, and then calculate parameters to implement 
gate operations. We assume a diagonal-type Ising interaction 
between qubits and then extend the scheme to Heisenberg 
interactions. In Section III, we present the conclusions. 
II. 
GATE OPERATIONS IN LNN ARCHITECTURES 
Figure 1 shows an LNN architecture, where each qubit is 
represented as a circle, and the couplings between qubits are 
represented by squares. Each qubit is coupled to every qubit 
through an Ising-type interaction, which is diagonal in the 
interaction basis. Such an Ising type coupling between qubits 
is commonly seen in proposals for superconducting Josephson 
junction qubits [34, 35], and also arises as one limit of dipole-
dipole or J-coupling systems [34, 36]. In our design, we 
assume only two coupling constants, 1 and 2, which alternate 
along the length of the architecture. The design can be 
implemented in systems with and without tunable couplings. 
For instance, in charge qubits with fixed couplings [42], the 
coupling capacitances between adjacent boxes can be 
fabricated to alternate along a line of qubits. If the coupling is 
tunable, as in [19] where nearest-neighbor charge qubits are 
coupled through loop-shaped electrodes with JJs at the loop 
intersections, the bias currents through alternate JJs can be 
fixed such that they alternate along the length of the chain. 
These currents, once set, will not be varied during the 
computation.  
Consider only three adjacent qubits along the line – qubits 
A, B and C in Fig. 1. The Hamiltonian describing the evolution 
of this system is an 8  8 matrix:

Here, i is the bias acting on individual qubits, which will be 
the control parameter in our system. We assume the qubits to 
be identical in design, in that the tunneling parameters ( and 
k) are identical. The bias parameter controls the tendency of 
the qubit to remain in its state. The tunneling parameter 
controls the tendency of the qubit to switch between the two 
basis states. We will also choose the magnitude of the 
coupling to be much larger than the tunneling, i.e., 1 >>  (or 
k) and 2 >> . Two different values of the coupling are 
required, so that qubit B can distinguish between qubits A and 
C.  
Suppose that, initially, the bias equal zero for all qubits. 
Next, the bias on qubit, B, is raised to some value of . As a 
result, Eq. (1) becomes:

Since 1 >>  and 2 >> , the expectation values of the ZA 
and ZC operators are either +1 or –1, depending on whether 
qubits A and C are in the |0 or |1 states, respectively. 
Therefore, we can write four 2  2 reduced Hamiltonians for 
qubit B in the subspaces where qubits A and C are in the |00, 
|01, |10 and |11 states, respectively:

Observe that if B << 1 (2), qubit B undergoes Z rotations 
in each subspace. However, since the couplings directly add to 
or subtract from the parameter  in each subspace, can be so 
chosen as to cancel or minimize the effects of the large 
coupling. As a result, unitary gate operations other than Z 
rotations can be realized. We will use this principle to realize 
different controlled-unitary and single-qubit operations in the 
system of 3 qubits. 
A controlled-unitary operation, CN(U), comprises N control 
qubits and one target qubit [43]. The desired unitary operation, 
U, is performed on the target qubit when the control qubits are 
in a given state, usually when all the controls are in the |1 
state. Suppose we want to perform a controlled-unitary 
operation, C2(U),  on qubits A, B and C, with qubits A and C as 
controls and qubit B as the target. A general single-qubit 
unitary operation can be written as:  
A 
1

where U is a 2  2 unitary matrix belonging to SU(2) [43], 
which is the set of 2  2 unitary matrices with unit determinant. 
The values of ,  and  can be chosen to realize the desired 
unitary transformation. Suppose we desire that only in the 
subspace where the control qubits are in the |11 state, the 
unitary operation given by Eq. (7) be performed on the target 
qubit B. This implies that the unitary matrices generated by 
each of the Hamiltonians given by Eqs. (3) through (5) be 2  2 
identity matrices. Likewise, the unitary matrix generated by the 
Hamiltonian given by Eq. (6) must be U. Since 1 (2) >> , we

We can see that under the first three Hamiltonians, Eqs. (9) 
through (11), target qubit B undergoes Z rotations. However, 
the values of 1 and 2 can be so chosen that within the time 
step of the gate operation, the Z rotations correspond to integer 
multiples of 2, wherein the unitary matrices generated are 
identity operations. Integrating the Hamiltonian given by Eq.

Here, T is the time step within which the desired unitary 
operation is to be realized. Given the values of , , and , Eqs. 
(15) through (17) can now be solved to find the parameters to 
realize different unitary gate operations. All parameters except 
will be treated as fixed constants of the system, while 
implementing a gate operation. Figure 2 shows the bias that 
will be applied on the target qubit, B, for a time step T, during 
which the gate operation is realized. The magnitude of the bias 
will be “1 + 2 + m” as given by Eq. (8). 
As an example, suppose we wish to realize a Toffoli gate, 
C2(X), in which case the U matrix given by Eq. (7) is the NOT 
gate (denoted by X), where

 One set of values for the angles , , and  are , 0 and , 
respectively. From Eqs. (15) and (16), we have m = 0 and k = 0 
(which is typical for Josephson-junction qubits. Note that for  
=  = 0, and  = , we have m = 0 and  = 0.)  If we choose the 
time step, T, of the gate operation to be 10ns, then from Eq. 
(17), we find  to be 25MHz, which is a typical value for the 
tunneling parameter of SQUIDs [44]. Since 1 (2) >> , we 
choose 1 and 2  to be 400MHz and 200MHz, respectively. 
These values are arbitrarily chosen such that under each of the 
Hamiltonians given by Eqs. (9) through (11), qubit B 
undergoes Z rotations that are integer multiples of 2 within 
the time step, T. Under the Toffoli gate operation, the bias on 
qubit B is pulsed from zero to 600MHz (Eq. (8) with m=0) for 
10ns. That is, in Fig. 2, the magnitude of the bias pulse is 
600MHz and the time step is 10ns. Observe that the biases on 
qubits A and C remain zero throughout the operation, and need 
not be varied, which is an advantage. Numerical simulations of 
the 8  8 Hamiltonian verify this technique, with a maximum 
error of 0.93% in the output probability amplitudes. It is 
important to point that, since the reduced-Hamiltonian 
technique uses the approximation 1 (2) >>  in finding an 
analytic solution for calculating the system parameters, 
30

stronger the coupling, greater is the fidelity of the gate 
operation. For instance, if 1 and 2 are 2GHz and 1GHz, 
respectively, the maximum error in the output probability 
amplitudes is 0.04%.  However, in this case, the bias on target 
B will have to be raised to 3GHz.  
Likewise, suppose we want to implement a controlled-
controlled-Hadamard gate, C2(Had), where the Hadamard gate, 
Had, is defined by the following matrix operation:

Since the tunneling is a fixed parameter of our system, we will 
use the same value of  and k as we previously derived for the 
Toffoli gate, i.e.,  = 25MHz, k=0. One set of values for ,  
and  to realize a Had gate are 2,  and /2, respectively. 
Note from Eq. (16) that these values of the angles satisfy the 
condition k = 0. Also, from Eq. (15), we have m = 1. Using Eq. 
(17), we calculate T to be 7.1ns. Therefore, to implement a 
C2(Had) gate, the bias on qubit B is pulsed from zero to 
625MHz (Eq. (8) with m=1) for 7.1ns. That is, in Fig. 2, the 
magnitude of the bias on qubit B is 625MHz, and T is 7.1ns. 
Observe that for both gate operations we used the same value 
of the couplings, i.e., the couplings are fixed. This has the 
advantage that even in a system with tunable couplings, the 
values of the couplings need to be adjusted only at the start of a 
computation, which can greatly reduce the circuit complexity, 
and the number of computational steps. 
In most quantum systems, gate operations themselves are 
not realized perfectly, due to the structure of the internal 
Hamiltonian. For instance, observing Eq. (13), an X gate or 
Had gate is realized with an overall global phase of ± /2 for 
k=0. As a result, the |101 and |111 states pick up relative 
phases of ±/2 with respect to the other basis states when 
implementing a Toffoli (or C2(Had)) gate. To overcome these 
phases we require an additional coupling parameter, , between 
qubits A and C. However, this additional “next-to-nearest-
neighbor” coupling, if present, affects the gate operation itself, 
unless accounted for when applying the bias pulses on the 
target qubit. Details of the effects of next-to-nearest-neighbor 
couplings on gate operations have been presented elsewhere. 
We will next show how to use our scheme to implement 
two-qubit controlled-unitary operations and single-qubit 
unitary operations. Two-qubit controlled-unitary operations, 
C1(U), can be realized by applying two pulses as shown in Fig. 
3(a). Suppose we want to perform a C1(U) gate with qubit A as 
the control qubit and qubit B as the target qubit. Qubit C 
behaves as the “dummy” qubit in this case. The first pulse on 
target qubit B is a bias value of “1+2+m” (Eq. (8)). For the 
second pulse, the bias on target qubit B is raised to a value of 
“12+m”.  This is because, in this case, we want qubit B to 
undergo a unitary operation (Eq. (7)) under the reduced 
Hamiltonian given by Eq. (5). Similarly, to realize a single 
qubit unitary operation, four pulses are applied. The values of 
the bias pulses on qubit B will be “12+m”, “1+2+m”, 
“12+m”, and “1+2+m”, respectively, for the four gate 
operations shown in Fig. 3(b). Observe that unlike some 
previous methods that use “isolation” qubits (qubits fixed in |0 
and |1 states) to separate the qubits used in the gate operations 
from their nearest neighbors, our scheme has no such 
requirement. This is a great advantage for two reasons  the 
same gate operation can be realized without using additional 
qubits, and swap gate operations are not required to bring 
together qubits separated by “isolation” qubits. 
 Figure 2. Bias pulse on the target qubit, B, during a C2(U) gate operation on a 
three-qubit system. The bias is raised from zero to a value “1 + 2 + m” as 
given by Eq. (8). The biases on control qubits, A and C, are kept zero 
throughout the gate operation. 
As shown, the reduced-Hamiltonian technique presented 
here allows experimentalists the ability to choose system 
parameters to realize quantum gates, for ideal pulses. However, 
in real systems, pulses are not ideal. Given non-ideal 
characteristics, 
experimentalists 
can 
fine-tune 
control 
parameters through numerical simulation, as shown in [45] and 
[46]. For example, real pulses exhibit finite rise (TR) and fall 
(TF) times.  Simulations carried out for the Toffoli gate under 
different values of TR and TF show that, under a non-ideal 
pulse, to increase the fidelity of a Toffoli gate, the pulse width 
has to be increased. For instance, when B = 600MHz, for TR = 
TF = 1ns, the pulse width becomes 10.4ns, instead of 10ns as 
originally calculated. In this case, the maximum error in the 
output probability amplitudes is 2.97%. If, however, B = 3GHz 
(for 1=2GHz; 2=1GHz), for TR = TF = 1ns, the pulse width is 
10.7ns, giving a maximum error of 0.54% in the output 
probability amplitudes. Even though the probability amplitudes 
can be improved by adjusting the pulse width, random relative 
phases occur between the basis states in the final state. These 
phases are hard to keep track of since they vary with the 
rise/fall times and the maximum amplitude of the bias pulse. 
However, in [47], we present an architectural layout of qubits 
that is immune to such relative phase errors.   
While we have restricted our discussion to LNN 
architectures where the qubits are coupled via Ising 
interactions, the method presented here easily extends to 
systems coupled via Heisenberg interactions. Equation (20) 
shows a three-qubit system coupled via anisotropic interactions 
[48].

interactions are pre-dominantly of the Ising type. Therefore, the 
same parameters that were used to realize a C2(U) operation in 
a system described by Eq. (5), can be used to realize the 
operation in a system described by Eq. (20). For instance, 
consider the Toffoli gate. The coupling parameters, 1 and 2, 
are 400MHz and 200MHz, respectively. Simulation results 
showed that when  was 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1, the maximum 
error in the output probability amplitudes were 0.3%, 1.64%, 
and 11.36% respectively. The high error in the probability 
amplitude when  is 0.1 is because, the magnitudes of the 
XX and YY couplings are much larger than the tunneling 
parameter. As a result, the high off-diagonal couplings cause 
the control qubits to undergo unitary dynamics that are no 
longer simple Z rotations. In other words, the control qubits no 
longer remain in their states, but actually can change their state 
from |0 to |1, and vice versa, with a probability that depends 
on the value of . Moreover, it was also found that by 
decreasing the pulse width of the gate operation, a higher 
accuracy can be obtained. For   = 0.1, when T was reduced to 
8.4ns, the maximum error in the output probability amplitudes 
was reduced to 4.9%. Next, for  = 0.05, the off-diagonal 
couplings are almost equal to the tunneling, which results in a 
much lower error. Here again, by reducing T (9.2 ns), a much 
lower error in the output probability amplitudes can be 
obtained (0.6%). Finally, for  = 0.01, the error is very low 
since the off-diagonal couplings are lower than the tunneling. 
Therefore, they have a negligible effect on the evolution of the 
system as a whole.

Figure 3. Methods for realizing a two-qubit controlled-unitary operation and a 
single-qubit unitary operation. (a) Qubit A is the control and qubit B is the 
target. Qubit C functions as a dummy qubit. The overall gate operation requires 
2 pulses. (b) Qubit B is the qubit on which a unitary operation is to be 
performed. Qubits A and C are dummy qubits. The gate operation is realized in 
four pulses, each of which corresponds to a C2(U) gate operation. 
In a previous reduced-Hamiltonian scheme for weakly 
coupled qubits [44], we showed how to implement two-qubit 
controlled-unitary operations, C1(U), without having to shut off 
coupling between qubits. This approach required that the bias 
on the control qubit be maintained at an arbitrarily large value 
throughout the gate operation, and the bias on the target qubit 
be pulsed low during the gate operation [44]. While the scheme 
worked at achieving arbitrary C1(U) operations, it had two 
disadvantages. The first was that the high value of the bias on 
the control qubit during C1(U) operations caused the control 
qubit to precess at very fast rates. Therefore, slight mismatches 
in timing or in the bias parameter gave rise to large variations 
in the relative phases between the basis states. The second, and 
more important disadvantage, was that the scheme could not be 
generalized towards realizing controlled-unitary operations on 
a target qubit involving more than two control qubits, i.e., 
CN(U) with N>2. In the scheme presented here, once the values 
of m, , k and T are found by solving Eqs. (15) through (17), a 
CN(U) operation, for any value of N1, can be simply realized 
by raising the bias on the target qubit from zero to a value 
given by

where i  are the couplings between the target qubit and each of 
the N control qubits. No two couplings can have the same 
magnitude as the target qubit will not be able to distinguish 
between the different control qubits. Equation (21) shows that, 
as N varies, the values of m, , k and T  do not change for a 
desired unitary operation given by Eq. (11). Only the bias 
varies according to the number of coupling terms in Eq. (21). 
(Note that since i >> , for i = 1,…,N, the values of i  are 
chosen such that “iT”  is an integer multiple of 2, so that an 
identity operation is realized on the target qubit when all the 
control qubits are not in the |1 state). Thus, the scheme can be 
easily extended to 2-dimensional layouts and to architectures 
where couplings are not restricted to nearest neighbors. 
The scheme presented here has yet another advantage. 
Single qubit Z rotations can be easily realized by varying the 
biases on individual qubits. For instance, an RZ() gate, which 
is a Z rotation by angle , can be realized on qubit A (B or C), 
by raising the bias slightly on it to a value A (B or C) such 
that 2AT = , where T is the time within which the rotation 
is realized. Since the scheme in [44] required high biases on all 
qubits during idle times, it was difficult to perform single qubit 
rotations, especially since qubits were precessing at very fast 
rates and relative phases were difficult to control. Moreover, 
the scheme presented here, where the couplings are larger and 
chosen so that within a 10ns interval no phases occur, the small 
magnitudes of the always-on couplings in [44] always generate 
additional phases, which are hard to keep track of through 
timing.  
It is important to point out that while in this work we have 
assumed the qubits to be identical in design with no 
asymmetries in the architectural layout, relative phases can 
occur as a result of parameter mismatches, which might alter 
the results of a computation. The performance of gate 
operations in the presence of parameter mismatches and 
asymmetry in design is being considered as a future work.

the system, so that system parameters can easily be solved for, 
to realize desired quantum gates. The scheme is general and 
can be can be extended towards any two-level system whose 
Hamiltonian can be reduced to that of a spin boson. We 
described how to implement gate operations in a one-
dimensional NN architecture, where the effects of finite rise 
and fall times due to non-ideal pulses on gate operations were 
considered. The scheme was then extended to show how a 
controlled-unitary operation with N controls and a single target 
qubit can be realized in a single pulse. The main advantage of 
the scheme presented in this paper is that it is simple and 
efficient because only a single control parameter is required. 
Also, we do not require the ability to tune couplings during a 
computation. Moreover, unlike some other methods, neither 
does ours’ require encoding physical qubits into logical qubits, 
nor does it require separating qubit-bearing spins by passive 
“barrier” 
spins, 
thereby, 
significantly 
minimizing 
the 
computational overhead.
