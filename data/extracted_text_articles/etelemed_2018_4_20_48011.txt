Abstract— The aim of this study was to clarify what kind of their 
facial expression nursing students selected; be it dependent on their 
patients' situations and the nursing care. Furthermore, educational 
needs concerning facial expressions are examined. In accordance with 
P. Ekman's facial expression analyses, photographs of 10 types of 
facial expressions were taken and the emotional components perceived 
therein analyzed. Using the 10 expressions, several aspects were 
studied. Twenty-seven students responded to questions. Results 
revealed students may misunderstand the expression of fear as one of 
disgust or sadness. Furthermore, they tend to think that the 
expressions of surprise, fear, disgust, anger, and sadness are 
inappropriate facial expressions when talking to a patient or 
conducting a physical assessment. Twenty students responded to 
educational needs regarding facial expressions. Their remarks 
included “lessons on how to make facial expressions corresponding to 
situations in simulations and actual practices are desirable” and 
“effectiveness of facial expressions.” In addition, having the students' 
own facial expressions mechanically analyzed or evaluated by others 
may offer them an opportunity to learn how to express emotions 
appropriately. As these aspects are in accordance with the students' 
educational needs, an early introduction to the education on facial 
expressions is desirable. 
Keywords-facial expression; nursing student; physical 
assessment; communication. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Because it is a requirement for nurses to understand their 
patients' 
needs 
and 
respond 
accurately, 
proficient 
communication skills are indispensable for their profession 
[1]. However, in the actual education practices for nurses in 
Japan, a deterioration in the nursing students' ability to 
sympathize as well as other interpersonal abilities has been 
evident; thus, it is difficult for students to build a mutual 
understanding with their patients through their nursing 
practices [2]. In addition, a survey on university students’ 
communication skills from the perspective of social skills 
revealed that the emotional sensibility of nursing students, 
which is required to understand nonverbal information, is 
poorer than that of students who have specialized in care for 
people who have disabilities. Furthermore, their ability to 
control their emotions, which is required to keep their 
emotional sensibility in check, is higher than that of 
pedagogic students [3]. Although the impact of the facial 
expressions of nurses [4], physical therapists [5], and 
pharmacists [6] on their patients has been reported, no study 
has revealed how nursing students choose their facial 
expressions; be it based on their patients' situations or 
events. There has also been no clear indication on the need 
for education with reference to facial expressions. 
In view of these circumstances, the aim of the present study 
was to clarify what kind of their facial expression nursing 
students selected; be it dependent on their patients' 
situations and/or nursing events. Furthermore, educational 
needs with reference to facial expressions are examined. 
In Section 2, the method employed in the study is 
explained. In Section 3, the results of the feelings analysis of 
10 kinds of expressions, which were developed for this 
investigation, are outlined. In addition, facial expressions 
when a nursing student provides care for a patient are 
described. A brief discussion is offered in Section 4; 
conclusions and recommendations for future research are 
presented in Section 5. 
II. 
METHOD 
In accordance with P. Ekman's facial expression 
analyses [7], photographs of 10 types of facial expressions 
were taken; these are depicted in in Figure 1 (A: blank 
expression; B-E: four levels of happiness; F: surprise; G: 
fear; H: disgust; I: anger; J: sadness). The emotional 
components perceived therein were analyzed. The Emotion 
API of Microsoft Cognitive Services [8] [9] was employed 
to analyze facial expressions. The reason for a number of 
facial expressions showing happiness is nursing students use 
different degrees of smiling when caring for patients. The 
degrees of expressing happiness were derived from the 
researchers’ experience.

Using the 10 expressions, the items thus listed were 
studied. To assess their adequacy, the facial expressions were 
rated by means of seven levels; Level 1 denoted “not

adequate at all,” while Level 7 signified it was “very 
adequate.” The items are as follows: 
 
 How nursing students recognize emotions behind the 
10 facial expressions; 
 Adequacy of facial expressions when talking with a 
patient by showing a smile, blank expression, worry, 
agony or anger; 
 Adequacy of facial expressions when conducting a 
physical assessment of a patient by showing a smile, 
blank expression, worry, agony or anger; 
 Adequacy of facial expressions when communicating a 
problematic or non-problematic test result. 
 Past experience in facial expression training and the 
emotion felt on that occasion; and 
 Educational needs regarding facial expressions.

 The analysis of the 10 facial expressions  
The analysis of the 10 facial expressions prepared for 
this study mainly detected components associated with a 
lack of emotion in Expressions A and B, happiness in C, D 
and E, surprise in F, sadness in G, I and J, and a lack of 
emotion in H (Table I). The expressions of fear, disgust, and 
anger included a great deal sorrow and expressionless 
components.

 a. Emotions expressed by facial expression. 
b. Total of 8 items sums to 1. Because it rounds off, the total may not be 1 in some cases. 
 
B. Emotions that nursing students feel from 10 facial 
expressions 
Six 1st-year students, twelve 2nd-year students, and nine 
4th-year students responded to the questions. With reference 
to Expression A, the majority, namely, 81.5% identified it 
as “others.” Of these, 15 students chose “indifference and 
lack of emotion.” Regarding Expression B, 51.9% identified 
it as “others” while 40.7% associated it with “happiness.” 
Other responses included “smile” and “tense smile.” 
Expression C was linked to “happiness” by 85.2% of the 
respondents. Expressions D and E were perceived by 92.6% 
of the students as “happiness.” Other responses included 
expressions that indicated fun and a lack of animosity 
against someone else. Expression F was associated by 100% 
of the respondents with “surprise.” Expression G was 
identified with disgust, fear, and sadness by 44.4%, 33.3% 
and 14.8%, respectively. Expression H was associated with 
disgust by 88.9% of the respondents. In Expression I, 92.6% 
perceived anger while 92.6% perceived sadness in 
Expression J. 
 
C. Facial expressions that nursing students select for 
communication and care 
When caring for patients who displayed various facial 
expressions, the expression selected by the nursing student 
is presented in Tables II and III. To assess their adequacy, 
the expressions were rated by means of seven levels; Level 
1 signified "not adequate at all," while Level 7 meant “very                 
adequate.” The extent to which nursing students thought 
their expressions were appropriate is indicated in the table 
by the average value. Nursing students should consider the 
following when speaking with patients who have various 
expressions.

students tried to “smile,” “make a kind smile because the 
patient might be worried or nervous,” or “change facial 
expressions along with the conversation.” When a patient 
had a worried expression, the students focused on “keeping

patient displayed a painful expression, the students tried to 
“keeping a worried face” or “a smile that keeps the patient 
from feeling pain.” When the patient displayed an angry 
expression, the students tried to have “a serious look” and 
“not an angry face,” but “smile.”

Nursing students chose a facial expression that they consider appropriate for patients 
expressing a certain emotion. The average value of the 7-level Likert scale is shown  
 
The facial expressions that nursing students chose when 
conducting a physical assessment of patients are as follows. 
The students' tendency when talking to a patient with a 
beaming smile was to “beam in the same way” or 
“seriously.” When a patient had a blank expression, the 
students tried to “smile,” and display “a facial expression 
that relieves the patient,” or a “gentle expression.” The 
students focused on “keeping a worried face in the same 
way” or “a facial expression that relieves the patient when 
the patient had a worried expression. When the patient’s 
facial expression was one of pain, the students tried to “keep 
a worried face” or “a facial expression that relieves the 
patient,” or “expressions in which seriousness is conveyed 
to patients.” When a patient had an angry expression, the 
students tried to have “a serious look,” “not an angry face,” 
and “a facial expression that conveyed worry.” 
D. Facial expression when conveying test results 
The facial expressions when conveying test results are 
presented in Table IV. When the students informed a patient 
that there was no problem, they chose to wear a “smile,” 
“bright expression” or “assuring expression.” When they 
informed a patient that there was a problem, they opted to 
have a “serious expression,” “smile,” or “nervous 
expression.” 
E. The degree of self-confidence of students who make 
appropriate facial expressions, and learning needs 
The level of confidence the nursing students had in 
making an adequate expression was 4.5. The averages per 
year were 4.6, 3.9, and 5.3 among the 1st-year, 2nd year, and 
3rd year students, respectively. There were seven students in 
the school who received training on facial expressions. The 
level of satisfaction they experienced from the training was 
6.4, their level of delight was 4.5, and level of sadness was 
1.9.

Three 
students 
received 
instructions 
on 
facial 
expressions during their clinical practice from someone 
other than a teacher. The level of satisfaction they 
experienced from the instruction was 7.0, their level of 
delight was 5.0, and sadness, 3.7. 
Twenty students responded on educational needs 
regarding facial expressions. Their remarks included: 
“lessons on how to make facial expressions corresponding 
to situations in simulations and actual practices is 
desirable,” “effectiveness of facial expressions,” “mutual 
peer advice because you cannot exactly know what 
expression you wear unless the other person tells you,” “for 
the purpose of staying closer to patients’ feelings, it would 
be more useful if the education focuses on how to express or 
perceive emotions instead of making facial expressions,” 
and “it would be great to have an opportunity to teach junior 
nurses and students the effective facial expressions when 
dealing with angry patients, emotionless patients, or patients 
in agony.” 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
Most students perceived happiness in Expressions C and 
D. While their impressions from Expressions H (disgust) 
and I (anger) were different from the mechanical analysis 
35

results, the students’ evaluation seemed consistent. On the 
other hand, opinions were divided for Expression G (fear) 
both in the analyses and among students; this suggested the 
possibility of mistakenly being perceived as an expression 
of disgust or sadness. In a survey targeting nurses, the 
highest mean accuracy rate of recognizing facial emotion 
was happiness (99.14%) while the lowest accurately 
recognized facial expression was fear (47.71%) [10]. 
Students, like nurses, are expected to be able to assess the 
feelings of happiness accurately. The expression of 
happiness is considered to be a facial expression that 
students can understand. The reason for this is that the facial 
expression of happiness is different from other facial 
expressions; the footprint of the crow is formed in the 
corner of the eye and the corners of the mouth are raised. 
Nursing students are confused by the expressions of fear 
and disgust. The reason is that the two facial expressions are 
similar with regard to wrinkles between the nose and 
eyebrows. Psychiatrists who treat adults were significantly 
better at recognizing fearful and disgusted facial emotions 
than child-adolescent psychiatrists while the latter were 
better at recognizing angry facial emotions [11]. Even 
qualified medical personnel suggest that there is a difference 
in the ability to recognize negative facial expressions. 
Training to recognize facial expressions is necessary for 
students. This has already been developed as the Micro 
Expression Training Tool. However, it is reported that the 
training effect is low when communication ability is poor 
[12]. While facial expressions are often judged in 
combination with other circumstances, this study may 
provide students with an opportunity to realize that patients' 
feelings can be misunderstood. Furthermore, having students' 
own facial expressions mechanically analyzed or evaluated 
by others may offer an opportunity for them to learn how to 
express emotions. As these aspects match the students' 
educational needs, an early introduction of the education on 
facial expression is desirable. 
In having conversations with or conducting physical 
assessments on patients who display various expressions, 
such as smile, worry, agony, and anger, it was revealed that 
students consider it inadequate to have an expression of 
surprise, fear, disgust, anger or sadness. Furthermore, they 
responded that a modest smile could be applied to any 
situation. However, because the students do not have many 
opportunities to deal with a patient in agony or anger in a 
nursing practice, their responses may be a result of their lack 
of experience. This suggests the necessity to create 
opportunities for students to experience how to deal with 
patients in agony or anger through simulation education. In 
communicating a problematic test result to a patient, the 
students considered it better to have a blank expression or 
modest smile. This study did not conduct any survey on what 
kind of facial expressions patients prefer or what kind of 
expressions skilled nurses consider adequate; ideally, these 
themes should be studied in the future. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This study aims to clarify nursing students choose what 
kind of their facial expressions depending on their patients' 
situations and nursing occasions. The results of this study 
indicate facial expressions that nursing students select when 
they are with patients. Nursing students thought that a 
moderate smile could be applied to any situation. However, 
patients and nurses need to evaluate the actual students' 
facial expressions. 
Currently, there are no systems that students can self-
learn about their facial expressions. Therefore, our future 
work is to develop a system that integrates facial expression 
analysis system and others evaluation, so that nursing 
students can learn about communication.
