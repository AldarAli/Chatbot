Abstract— Due to interfacial effects that concerns micro 
channel 
jets, 
Plateau-Rayleigh 
is 
a 
well-known 
instability. In micro fluidics context, the gravity is 
negligible 
and 
surface 
tension 
phenomena 
are 
predominant. Over the past decade, there has been 
extensive research into the design of microfluidic 
systems for chemical analysis. All previous works 
provided an overview of instabilities that lead to a rich 
variety of different flow regimes that can be obtained in 
a micro channel. We survey advancement over ten years 
in the development of micro scale devices for instability 
gaseous micro flow. A parametric instability study was 
systematically conducted with varying system pressure, 
heat flux, and channel size with and without inlet 
restrictor. This paper describes various works for micro 
channel instability flow in gaseous micro fluidic devices. 
The main objective of this work is the mathematical 
resolution of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation, and then 
used this solution to create perturbations in the flow by 
varying the pressure. The instability of physics is 
explored using previous theoretical and numerical 
analyses, as well as experimental observations. The 
difficulty of the analytical resolution of the Orr-
Sommerfeld equation for a velocity profiles for the 
perturbation has always been a problem; that is why we 
are going to try to get it numerically.   
                                                                     
Keywords-Gaseous instability; micro canal; microfluidics 
simulation; experimentation; gaseous flow. 
 
 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Microfluidics is the science and technology of the 
manipulation of fluids in small channels. The development 
of the microfluidics science has been seen in the mid of the 
70th. The current micro fabrication technology has allowed 
its rapid expansion from the middle of the 80th [1]. The 
interest in this science has led to a major development, 
particularly in the field of chemistry and biology. This 
growing interest is reflected in several publications. 
 
Drazin and Reid [2] deﬁne hydrodynamic instability as a 
branch of hydrodynamics, which is concerned with “when 
and how laminar ﬂows break down, their subsequent 
development and their eventual transition to turbulence.” 
Fluid instabilities may be broadly divided into two classes: 
convective instability and dynamic instability. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Growth in the number of publications on microfluidics 
 in recent decades [1]. 
 
While the convective instabilities can be understood 
rather easily in terms of forces acting on displaced parcels 
of fluid, the dynamic one are more varied and more 
challenging to understand. 
 
When thin cylinders of liquid tend to break up into 
droplets in the presence of large surface tension; this 
phenomenon is known as Rayleigh-Plateau instability [2], 
and it is caused by a positive feedback loop between the 
decreased cylinder radius and increased tension forces. 
 
  
As a result, liquid jets and spindles along the boundary 
of a liquid sheet will reliably break apart as soon as they 
become thin enough for the surface tension forces to 
dominate the inertia forces [3] [4]. For applications, we can 
use coaxial cylinders to create jets, or to generate droplets in 
order to obtain some micromixers [5]. The classical 
Rayleigh-Plateau instability is described as a phenomenon 
in which the velocity inside the jet is constant; the same 
kind of analysis is done in a more general setting using a 
long wave approximation [6]. The numerical linear 
instability is done in the context of a shear flow [7]. K.C 
Sahu, et al., use the same strategy of Colin and Tancogne 
[8] in order to study the stability of a coflow composed by a 
newtonian fluid and a non-newtonian one. The spatial 
responses of the film to inlet controlled periodic 
perturbations which have been characterized when the 
Rayleigh-Plateau is relevant [9].

The emphasis has been put on the linear and nonlinear 
development of the primary wave train. S. Shabahang et al. 
[10], present the observation of the Rayleigh-Plateau 
capillary instability in a multi-material fiber at the core 
cladding interface. 
 
The Plateau–Rayleigh instability, often just called the 
Rayleigh instability that is responsible for the phenomenon 
of the break-up of a jet. Fonade [11] gave some principles of 
such study focusing primarily on the flow type "jets". The 
method that is used is similar to the harmonic analysis of a 
system: in a given mean flow, we add a perturbation which 
is 
characterized 
by 
velocity 
and 
pressure. 
These 
characteristics are sinusoidal functions.  
The frequency is kept as a parameter; we study how the 
flow is modified by the perturbation. If the system is 
nonlinear the answer will depend on the amplitude of the 
perturbation; therefore, we take low amplitude, which 
permits linearizing equations.  
 
We consider a parallel of two dimensional flow which 
defined by
 in which we superpose a 
perturbation which defined by
. 
It is supposed that the mean flow
 and the 
global flow
 separately verify the 
continuity equation and Navier-Stokes equations.  
 
A stream function of the perturbation which is 
periodic with respect to time, verifies the continuity 
equation and Navier-Stokes equations. This function is 
written with the following complex notation:    
                          
                 
                     (1) 
 
 
 : The amplitude functions of the 
perturbation. 
 
 and 
:  constants that are generally complex [Only the 
real part of the stream function has a   physical sense]. 
 
When we replace adimensional quantities in the relation 
(1): 
 
           
     
          
                                     
 
                  
                       
               
 
 
        The relation (1) becomes:  
 
      . 	



	

     (2) 
The relation (1) is used to calculate the components (u ', 
v') of the perturbation velocity. Medium flows and global 
verify the Navier-Stokes equations in which the pressure 
between these two equations is eliminated, to obtain the 
equation that is known as "Orr-Sommerfeld" [12]. 
 
  (3) 
R : the Reynolds number
 ;    U : mean flow. 
 
In this equation we must add the boundary conditions 
that are written to a jet: 
 
- v' = 0  whether   ∅/  0	 for 
 
- v' = 0 whether   0 for Y = 0 when we  
   consider a change of a symmetrical                           (4) 
   perturbation relative to the axis of the jet. 
- u = 0 whether ∅/  0    
  
For Y = 0, when we consider an antisymmetric perturbation.  
The stability study is to find the eigenvalues of the 
constants  and c; such as, the solution ∅ of equation (3) 
which verifies the boundary conditions.  
 
In addition to the mean flow U, and the Reynolds 
number R, we have three parameters 
in 
equation (4).∝ is undetermined parameter   2/ in 
which  is the wavelength of the perturbation.  
 
The association between the equation (2) and the 
boundary conditions (4) provides a solution ∅ and a pair 
of values
 that are dependent on the Reynolds number 
R and ∝. The perturbation will be amplified when
 
and it will be amortized when
. The perturbation will 
be neutral or indifferent when
.  
The condition 
provides the neutral stability 
curve  , "  0 that can be represented in the plan, ". 
 
II.     A METHOD OF OBTAINING AN EXACT 
SOLUTION 
 
We develop a method to obtain an exact solution of Orr-
Sommerfeld equation by reducing, the resolution of this 
differential equation solving a Volterra integral equation. 
 
We observe that:

We note that the transversal velocity at a position 2 is 
always maximum comparing at others positions with any 
pressure inlet 2 and it increases when the pressure inlet 2 
increases. 
 
V. CONCLUSION 
Microfluidics deals fluid flow, single or multiphase 
systems in very small dimensions in the micrometer range. 
In this paper, we present a study of jet created by a 
perturbation as different pressures.  
Our research team is in the process of developing a new 
line of research in our laboratory, the study of the 
hydrodynamic instability of gas flow. 
The equation of the perturbation is known by the Orr 
Sommerfeld equation. The difficulty of the analytical 
resolution of this equation is always a problem for obtained 
a velocity profiles for the perturbation we try to obtain it 
numerically. 
The first result consist a manipulation of all step of 
mathematical resolution of Sommerfeld equation. Really the 
difficulty is located on resolution of Voletra equation. 
The numerical results were presented. The velocity 
profile at different position of geometry indicates the 
sensibility of pressures.  We conclude the perturbation of 
principal flow is directly influenced by the size of 
elementary channel and pressures.
