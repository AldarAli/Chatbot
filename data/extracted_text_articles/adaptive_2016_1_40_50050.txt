Abstract—Cognitive radio is an emerging approach to implement
efﬁcient reuse of the licensed spectrum by detecting unoccupied
spectrum bands and adapting the transmission to those bands
while avoiding the interference to primary users. However,
rigorous requirements are put on the white space sensing that the
secondary user should have the ability to detect the primary signal
in very low signal to noise ratio (SNR). To achieve the require-
ments, in this paper, we discuss the adaptive white space sensing
for cognitive radio system based on generalized likelihood-ratio
test over Rayleigh fading channel in multiple antennas. The test
statistics are based on softly combined spatio-temporal diversity
to enhance the detection performance. Additionally, we give the
expression of the asymptotic detection performance.

INTRODUCTION
Spectrum sharing remains one of the most important goals
for wireless communication systems. Until this time, the prin-
ciple has been to assign exclusive frequency bands to different
systems or different operators, and systems that used adjacent
frequency channels were required to use appropriate spectrum
masks to avoid harmful interference with each other. In this
case, the spectrum utilization is very limited.
Cognitive radio is an emerging approach to implement
efﬁcient reuse of the licensed spectrum by detecting unoccu-
pied spectrum bands and adapting the transmission to those
bands while avoiding the interference to primary users as
shown in Fig. 1 [1]. This novel approach to spectrum access
introduces unique functions at the physical layer: reliable
detection of primary users and adaptive transmission over a
wide bandwidth [2]-[5].
However, in order to avoid the harmful interference with
the primary system, the cognitive radio needs to sense the
availability of the spectrum (so called white space). Further-
more, rigorous requirements are put on the spectrum sensing
that the secondary user should have the ability to detect
the primary signal in very low SNR [6], [7]. Cooperative
communication has been known recently as a way to overcome
the limitation of wireless system. In some works, the cognitive
radios are allowed to cooperate for sensing the spectrum, so
that the issues are addressed [8]-[10]. Multiple antenna based
cognitive radios are also proposed in [11]-[13].
In this paper, we discuss the adaptive white space sensing
for cognitive radio system based on generalized likelihood-
ratio test over Rayleigh fading channel in multiple antennas. As

the transmitted data and channel impulse response are indepen-
dent from each other, we can calculate the variability of space
and time domains, separately. Although the detection with
joint process of the spatio-temporal domains using likelihood
ratio test shows the optimum property, it is difﬁcult to give a
clear expression of the test statistic. Therefore, the suboptimal
method is given with spatio-temporal soft combination of
individual test statistics in each domain. Additionally, we give
the expression of the asymptotic detection performance. This
paper is organized as follows. The white space sensing is
described in Section II. In Section III, we describe the adaptive
spatio-temporal detection. In Section IV, we show the computer
simulation results. Finally, the conclusion is given in Section
V.

WHITE SPACE SENSING
We assume that the cognitive radio system has been
deployed with M received antennas. The channel response
between the primary transmitter and the mth antenna of
the secondary receiver hm is modelled as independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex random variables with
variance σh, and E(||hm||2) = 1. When band-limited primary
signal dl is transmitted, the received signal at the mth antenna
of secondary receiver can be given by
ym,l = hmdl + nm,l,
(1)
where nm,l is the additive white Gaussian noise with the
variance σ2
n. In order to avoid the harmful interference with the
primary system, the cognitive radio needs to sense the avail-
ability of the white space adaptively. The goal of white space

sensing is to decide between the following two hypotheses:
H0 : ym,l = nm,l (absence of primary signal)
(2)
H1 : ym,l = hmdl + nm,l (presence of primary signal).
In the traditional multiple antennas reception, we can combine
the signal on each antenna to acquire diversity gain. If hm
and nm,l are known to the secondary receiver, maximum
ratio combination (MRC) can be used to maximize the SNR.
However, in general, hm, dl, and nm,l are unknown in the
secondary receiver. Therefore, the case with unknown hm, dl,
and nm,l is more practical. From this reason, it is reasonable
to model dl as complex Gaussian with zero mean and variance

ADAPTIVE SPATIO-TEMPORAL DETECTION
Adaptive detection can be performed with the time-
variability of hm without the knowledge of the noise variance.
Reviewing the expression in (1), we ﬁnd that the variances
of dl and hm can be transformed to each other without any
changes on the distribution of hmdl. As dl and hm are indepen-
dent from each other, we can calculate the variability of space
and time domains, separately. Although the detection with
joint process of the spatio-temporal domains using likelihood
ratio test shows the optimum property, it is difﬁcult to give a
clear expression of the test statistic. Therefore, the suboptimal
method is given with spatio-temporal soft combination of
individual test statistics in each domain.
A. Spatio variability
Based on the variability of hm, we get the generalized
likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) for the binary hypothesis testing

where L is the available independent samples which is smaller

Λ1 for both hypotheses follows the central and non-central χ2

where σh is the variance of channel hm.
C. Adapive spatio-temporal soft combination
To fully utilize the observations in space and time variabil-
ity, adaptive soft combination is performed to maximize the
detection performance. The test statistics after combination is
given by
Λ = ω1Λ1 + ω2Λ2
½
H1
Λ≥µ
H0
Λ<µ
(9)
where µ is the detection threshold. The accurate weight can
be obtained numerically to get the optimal solution. Moreover,
according to the Gaussian approximation of the X 2 distribu-
tion (restricted to the limits on the antenna number M in a
practical system, this approximation is not quit matched for
small M), we have the asymptotic optimal detection with the
maximal ratio processing
ω1 =
L
√
M 2 + L2 ,
(10)
ω2 =

√
M 2 + L2 .
The two test statistics Λ1 and Λ2 are thought to be independent
from each other due to different variabilities they are base
on. Moreover, different Doppler frequency and delay spread
of channel show the different coherence time and bandwidth.
Therefore, we need to identify the different coherence time
and bandwidth. Since L is smaller than 2BTc, we need to
choose the suitable L, adaptively. Observing Eq. (10), we can
get independent optimum weights ω1 and ω1 by choosing the
suitable L due to different channel variabilities. To derive the
more compact expression of the performance, it is common
practice to approximate a weighted sum of chi-square variables
by that 2 · Λ ∼ αX 2

COMPUTER SIMULATION RESULTS
Fig. 1 shows the concept of cognitive radio networks to
identify the white space. In this section, we consider the re-
ceived antennas number M to evaluate the detection probabil-
ity in the cognitive radios based on generalized likelihood ratio
test. In general, due to the cost limitation, the multiple antennas
communication systems have a few antennas. Therefore, the
received antennas number M is less than the samples number
L which is only restricted to the detection duration.

Detection performance for various M and L with PF A = 0.1.
Fig. 2 shows the detection performance for various M
with L = 50 , PF A = 0.1 and SNR=-7dB. The perfor-
mance improvement by exploiting two domains of spatio-
temporal diversity of the received signal is obvious when M is
large (M ≥ 4). When M is small, the approximation of GLRT
is not good enough which leads to bad detection probability.
Particularly, the detection performance of adaptive detection
is 7% degraded compared with the numerical result when
M = 3. Moreover, Eq. (13) is given under the assumption
that the test statistics in the spatio-temporal domains are
independent. Thus the actual correlation will cause larger error
when the PD is large. As a result, the detection performance
of adaptive detection and numerical result is the approximately
same when the PD is large.
Fig. 3 shows the detection performance for various M and
L with PF A = 0.1. From the simulation results, the detection
probability is rapidly improved by increasing the number of
antennas M and the number of the available independent
samples L. Particularly, the detection performance of adaptive
detection is more rapidly improved with increasing M than
that of with increasing L. There should be a tradeoff between
M and L because of the equivalent of spatial and time domains
in the detection.

CONCLUSION
We discuss the detection for cognitive radio system over
Rayleigh fading channel in multiple antennas. The spatio-
temporal diversity is exploited to improve the detection per-
formance. The time variability and the spatial variability are
both considered to give better detection performance. The per-
formance improvement by exploiting two domains of spatio-
temporal diversity of the received signal is obvious when M is
large (M ≥ 4). When M is small, the approximation of GLRT
is not good enough which leads to bad detection probability.
Particularly, the detection performance of adaptive detection
is 7% degraded compared with the numerical result when
M = 3. Moreover, the detection performance is more rapidly

improved with increasing M than that of with increasing L.
However, the number of antennas in a practical system restricts
its performance gain that it is only suitable to detect signal in
a medium low SNR (greater than -10dB). As the future work,
we will adapt the proposed detection method to Google project
Loon.
