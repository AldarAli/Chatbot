Abstract—Power measurement of individual machines is 
required in factories for production control and energy 
conservation. Therefore, a power consumption monitoring 
sensor that can be easily retrofitted and requires minimal 
maintenance should be devised. In this study, we developed a 
contactless, wireless, and battery less alternating current (AC) 
apparent power and power factor sensor, wherein a current-
sensing transformer serves not only as a noncontact current 
sensor but also as a power supply for the sensor. The AC voltage 
waveform was measured without a metal contact by using a 
piezoelectric film. A low-power circuit was designed to manage 
the power and measure the power factor from current and 
voltage waveforms. The prototyped sensor was tested in the 
factory. The data obtained by the field test were consistent with 
the results obtained from a commercially available power meter. 
The developed sensor can enable energy savings and carbon 
dioxide reduction in industrial applications.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This study expands on a previous conference submission 
[1]. The reduction of electrical power consumption remains a 
pertinent issue in factories with regard to reducing 
manufacturing costs and CO2 emissions [2][3] so as to ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
International 
Organization 
for 
Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard [4]. Therefore, precise 
measurement of the power consumption of each unit of 
equipment is critical [5].  
Such measurement requires compact, easy-to-install, and 
inexpensive wireless power sensors. However, existing 
sensors cannot satisfy these demands [6]–[11].  
To measure the current and voltage waveforms without 
invading the cables, the development of sensors that can be 
easily retrofitted. Current waveforms can be easily measured 
using a commercially available split-type current transformer 
[12]. Current transformers output an induced current that is 
proportional to the current flowing in the cable to be measured. 
This current can be used for sensing and power generation for 
energy harvesting [13]–[16]. Energy-harvesting batteryless 
operation considerably reduces maintenance costs. However, 
noninvasive measurement of the voltage waveform is difficult. 
Several nonmetallic contact methods for voltage waveform 
measurement have been proposed [17]–[20] to realize ease of 
installation and noninvasive measurement. However, these 
methods are expensive and require multiple probes, which 
renders implementation difficult. 
In this study, we developed a non-metal-contact voltage 
measurement method based on a single probe using a 
piezoelectric film. Furthermore, we fabricated and evaluated 
an energy-harvesting, noninvasive, and retrofittable wireless 
power consumption sensor that consists of the proposed 
voltage sensor, a current transformer, an energy-harvesting 
circuit, a power factor (PF) measurement circuit, and a 
wireless communication module for use in factories. The 
device does not require complex electrical circuitry and costs 
approximately $20 because of its simple design.  
In Section 2, a block diagram of the proposed sensor is 
presented. Section 3 describes the nonmetal contact voltage 
measurement process using a piezoelectric film. Section 4 
presents the power management and PF measurement circuit. 
Section 5 presents the results of field tests. Finally, Section 6 
presents the conclusions of this study. 
II. 
SENSOR CONFIGURATION  
The configuration of the developed sensor is illustrated in 
Figure 1. A current transformer was used to measure the 
current in a contact-free manner. The operating power of the 
wireless module can be obtained from the current transformer. 
The sensor can be powered through energy harvesting. The 
apparent power was calculated by multiplying the assumed-
to-be-constant voltage with the measured current. The PF was 
calculated using the phase difference between the voltage 
waveform acquired by the proposed voltage sensor and the 
current waveform. The obtained apparent power and PF were 
transmitted using a wireless module (TWE-Lite, Mono 
Wireless Inc., Kanagawa, Japan).

Installation of the developed sensor is easy because 
noncontact single probes are used for both current and voltage 
measurements. Furthermore, our sensor requires lower 
maintenance than conventional sensors because of its energy 
harvesting-based operation. 
 
III. 
NON-METAL-CONTACT VOLTAGE MEASUREMENT 
USING PIEZOELECTRIC FILMS 
A. Principle 
A piezoelectric film was attached to an electric cable. A 
cross-sectional view of the cable and piezoelectric film is 
displayed in Figure 2. The cable was assumed to be a 
sufficiently long conductor cylinder. When a voltage was 
applied to the cable, an electric field, E, is generated, and a 
potential difference is created between the nearby electrode 
pair of the piezoelectric film. The potential difference vp(t) can 
be calculated as follows: 
 
𝑣𝑝(𝑡) = − ∫
𝐸
𝑟+𝑎
𝑟
𝑑𝑟 = 𝑞(t)
2𝜋𝜀0𝜀𝑟
ln 𝑟 + 𝑎
𝑟
(1) 
 
In Equation (1), r is a distance between the center of the cable 
to a nearest electrode, a is a thickness of the dielectric film, 
and q(t) is the charge per unit length of the cable. 
Energized cables and grounded cables have capacitance. 
Therefore, the voltage applied to cable v(t) and the charge per 
unit length of cable q(t) have the following relationship: 
 
𝑞(𝑡) = 𝐶𝑣(𝑡)
(2) 
 
where C is the capacitance formed between the cables, which 
is extremely small. Combining the two equations, the 
relationship between the potential difference vp(t) and cable 
voltage v(t) can be expressed as follows: 
 
𝑣𝑝(𝑡) = 𝐶𝑣(𝑡)
2𝜋𝜀0𝜀𝑟
ln 𝑟 + 𝑎
𝑟
(3) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Cross-sectional view of the cable and piezoelectric film 
 
 
If the piezoelectric film is placed near the cable and r is 
small, the output voltage vp(t) has a sufficient value for 
measurement, and it correlates with cable voltage v(t). 
Therefore, the voltage can be measured without a metal 
contact. Equation (3) indicates that the output voltage vp(t) is 
proportional to the thickness of the piezoelectric film.  
However, the output of the piezoelectric film depends on 
the distance. 
 
B. Prototyping 
Noninvasive voltage measurement can be realized using by 
measuring the electric field strength around a wire using a 
single probe when the voltage is applied to the wire [17][18]. 
We used piezoelectric films to realize a low-cost electric field 
measurement method. Piezoelectric films comprise a 
piezoelectric material sandwiched between metal electrodes. 
The piezoelectric material was polarized by the electric field 
around the wire, and a potential difference was generated 
between the two electrodes. Thus, the electric field around 
the wire could be detected using a single piezoelectric probe. 
A non-metal-contact voltage probe was prototyped, as 
displayed in Figure 3. A commercially available piezoelectric 
film 
(LDT0-028K, 
TE 
Connectivity, 
Schaffhausen, 
Switzerland) was bent and placed at a uniform distance from 
the center of the wire. The sensor frame was fabricated using 
a 3D printer (UP BOX Plus, Beijing Tiertime Technology Co. 
Ltd., Beijing, China). The cable-side electrode was set as 
positive. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3. (a) Fabricated non-metal-contact voltage probe. (b) Probe placed 
on the electric cable. 
 
C. Measurement 
The voltage waveform observed using the probe is 
displayed in Figure 4. Although the output voltage and phase 
varied with the distance between the piezoelectric film and the 
wire, the correlation coefficient obtained for the actual and 
measured waveforms was 0.99. The proposed method can 
measure the relative change in the voltage, which is sufficient 
to enable PF calculation. The piezoelectric sensor output was 
related to the actual voltage and was consistent with the 
calculation results from the equivalent circuit. Furthermore, 
the output was almost zero when the neutral side of the cable 
was measured, which indicated that hum noise was not 
measured.

piezoelectric film. The piezoelectric sensor output was related in advance 
to the actual voltage. The neutral side output is almost zero. 
 
D. Linearity of the output for the applied electric field 
To evaluate the probe characteristics against the voltage 
applied to the cable, we measured the relationship between the 
applied electric field strength and output. A conductive tape 
was attached to both sides of the piezoelectric film, and a 
signal generator was used to apply voltage to the tape. The 
results displayed in Figure 6 confirmed that the output was 
linear with respect to the applied electric field. The inclination 
was slightly larger at higher frequencies.

linearity to the applied electric field. 
E. Frequency response 
The frequency response of the output of the fabricated 
probe was measured. The voltage of the measured cable was 
100 Vrms for all frequencies. The obtained frequency 
characteristics are displayed in Figure 8. The gain reference 
was set to the output at 350 Hz. The cutoff frequency was 25 
Hz, which indicated excellent low-frequency characteristics.

frequency was 25 Hz. 
 
IV. 
CIRCUIT OF THE PROPOSED METHOD 
A. Power management and current measurement circuit 
 The power management circuit of the fabricated sensor is 
illustrated in Figure 9. A current transformer was installed on 
the cable to be measured, and the current obtained from the 
transformer was full-wave rectified, smoothed, and measured. 
The power management circuit outputted not only the 
operation power for the entire circuit but also the voltage that 
correlated with the current flowing in the cable.

 First, we simulated the transient response of the power 
supply voltage (Vcc) of the power management circuit when 
currents of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 A were applied to the 
measured cable. The circuit used in the simulation is 
illustrated in Figure 10. Here, C1, L1, and R1 on the primary 
side of the transformer are the equivalent circuits of the cable. 
The simulation results for Vcc are displayed in Figure 11, 
which reveals Vcc converges after a few seconds. Furthermore, 
the results revealed that the voltage depended on the amount 
of current flowing through the cable. Here, Vcc was 
determined by a measurement resistor R6 (47 Ω) and D5 and 
D6. We confirmed that the operating voltage of a general 
micro controller (1.8 to 3.6 V) can be obtained in the range 1 
to 20 A, where we want to perform the measurement. The 
measurement range of the current can be modified by 
changing the resistance value or the threshold of the diodes.

Figure 11. Simulation results of the cable current dependence on the supply 
voltage (Vcc). Vcc converges after a few seconds and depends on the amount 
of current flowing in the cable. 
 
 Next, we simulated the relationship between the measured 
current and the sensor output voltage. The current 
transformer was assumed to be a current source that outputs 
current proportional to the current flowing in the cable. The 
circuit displayed in Figure 12 was simulated.

input current. 
 
The results of the relationship between the current, power 
supply voltage for our sensor, and the voltage of R6 are 
displayed in Figure 13. The supply voltage was rapidly 
increased to the operating voltage of the microcontroller. 
However, the sensor output was proportional to the output of 
the current transformer. The power management circuit 
simultaneously generated both the power supply and current 
measurement voltages. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13. Simulation results of the sensor supply voltage and the sensor 
output for the input current. The supply voltage rapidly increases to the 
operation voltage of the micro controller. By contrast, the sensor output is 
proportional to the output of the current transformer 
 
The sensor output was changed by the power consumption 
of the microcontroller. The microcontroller sent the data 
every 5 s and consumed 15 mA for 4 ms to send the data. For 
the other 4996 ms, the microcontroller was in the sleep mode 
and consumed 1.5 A. An RC low-pass filter with a time 
constant of 1 s was used to reduce the influence of the sending 
current. 
 
B. PF measurement circuit 
The developed sensor was operated using the power 
obtained from the current transformer; thus, realization of 
low-power PF measurement was critical. In this study, we 
used an analog circuit to perform PF measurements with a 
low power consumption.

Figure 14. Block diagram of the PF measurement circuit. 
 
Figure 14 displays the block diagram of the fabricated PF 
measurement circuit. The current and voltage waveforms 
were converted into square waves, and the phase difference 
was obtained as the pulse width by calculating the logical 
product of these waves. Subsequently, the phase difference 
was output as an analog voltage through the power 
amplification, smoothing, and differential amplification 
processes. The output was connected to the analog-to-digital 
converter of the wireless module, and the data were 
transmitted. This circuit can be applied to both the single- and 
three-phase electrical loads. 
V. 
FABRICATION AND FIELD TEST 
Noncontact wireless apparent power and PF sensors were 
fabricated, as displayed in Figure 15. The fabricated sensor 
was attached to an injection molding machine (SH100C, 
Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Tokyo, Japan) for field testing 
(Figure 16).

Figures 17 and 18 display comparisons of the PFs and 
apparent power values, respectively, which were measured 
using the developed sensor with those measured using a 
commercially available power logger (CM3286-01, HIOKI 
E.E., Tokyo, Japan). The PF obtained by the developed sensor 
had a correlation coefficient of 0.80 with that measured using 
a commercial logger. Apparent power had a correlation 
coefficient of 0.73. These results indicate that the proposed 
sensor can measure the power consumption sufficiently 
accurately. This accuracy is suitable for rough logging of the 
PF and can be improved by calibration and grounding 
processes. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Voltage waveforms were measured using a single 
piezoelectric probe without metal contacts. Novel energy-
harvesting wireless apparent power and PF sensors were 
developed using the piezoelectric probe. The data acquired 
using the developed sensor were consistent with the data 
acquired using a commercially available power meter.
