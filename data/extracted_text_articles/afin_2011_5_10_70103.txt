Abstract—As the Internet is one of infrastructures, the
reliability of the Internet is becoming crucial to survive against
failures of network equipment. Physical connectivity of the
network is essential to characterize the reliability. There is
collaboration structure, which is one of topological structures
where two or more nodes are connected with a node, and col-
laboration is observed in transcriptional regulatory networks
and ISP’s router-level topologies. The collaboration structure
relates to reliability of the network. Here, the main objective of
this paper is to indicate whether the increase of collaboration
improve the reliability or not. For this purpose, we ﬁrst cate-
gorize the topology into three-level hierarchy; top-level layer,
middle-level layer and bottom-level layer. It is apparent that
the collaboration between top-level layer and middlelevel layer
is much lower in the router-level topologies. We then calculate
reliability of each network. The result indicates that reliability
of most transcriptional regulatory networks is higher than one
of router-level topologies. Finally we conﬁrm that reliability of
router-level topologies can be improved by rewiring to increase
collaboration between top-level and middle-level layer.

I. INTRODUCTION
As the Internet becomes the social and economic in-
frastructure, the reliability is becoming crucial to survive
against failures of network equipment. Many approaches to
improve the reliability have been investigated either at the
network layer [1] or more higher layer. The reliability is also
investigated in the optical communication systems through
the protection/restoration techniques [2].
These approaches greatly improve the reliability of the
network, however, physical connectivity of the network is
more essential to characterize the reliability of the network.
That is, if the physical connectivity of the network is easily
disrupted by network failures, the approaches to improve
the reliability at network layer are no longer effective. In
fact, the physical topologies used in the previous studies
inherently assume that the physical connectivity is kept
after the network failures. In order to design a reliable
network, it is important to make the physical topology to
be reliable against the network failures. For this purpose,
the topological characteristic and topological structure that
makes the physical topology more reliable is necessary to
investigate.
As for the topological characteristic, Faloutsos et al. [3]
demonstrates that the degree distribution of ISP’s router-
level topologies in the Internet exhibits power-law attribute,
meaning that the existing probability P(k) of degree k node
that has k links is proportional to k−γ. The modeling methods
of router-level topology are investigated in Refs. [4], [5].
Barab´asi et al. presents the well-known BA model that
generates topologies having power-law degree distribution
[4]. Albert et al. also investigated the failure tolerant char-
acteristics of BA topologies generated by the BA model [6].
The results show that BA topology has relatively few high
degree nodes. Thus, a random failure of nodes will mostly
remove low-degree nodes with little effect on the physical
connectivity of the network. However, only the degree
distribution does not determine the performance of router-
level topologies. In Ref. [5], the author enumerates several
topologies that have the same degree distribution but have
the different topological structure, and then evaluates the
amount of trafﬁc that the network accommodates. Because
of the constraints of router’s processing capacity and the
product lineup of commercial routers, the amount of trafﬁc
differs dependent on the topological structure of router-level
topology. The results show that router-level topologies have
the structure that high-degree nodes connect with low-degree
nodes while the topology by the BA model has the structure
that high-degree nodes are connected each other.
Li et al. [5] demonstrates that the topological structure
greatly affects the network-level performance of router-
level topologies. However, Abilene network examined in [5],
which is one of scientiﬁc networks, is different to the other
ISP networks [7]. The main difference may come from the
fact that scientiﬁc networks like the Abilene network provide
fewer opportunities to enhance their network because of
budgetary constraints, while ISPs make their efforts on
enhancement of network and/or reduce the trafﬁc load on
network. The difference on the redundancy of the topology
can clearly be seen from the graphs of the Abilene network
(Fig. 6 (e) of Ref. [5]) and the Sprint network (Figs. 7 and 8
of Ref. [8]). One of our motivations in this paper is to reveal
a topological structure that makes the router-level topologies
more reliable.
In this paper, we investigate a collaboration structure in
router-level topologies. Here, the collaboration is one of
topological structures where two or more nodes are con-
nected with a node. The collaboration contributes robustness
or reliability of topologies because it introduces multiple
paths between nodes.

The collaboration contributes robustness or reliability of
topologies because it introduces multiple paths between
nodes. The network where the nodes are more collaborated
has a chance to have larger number of paths between nodes.
Note that unlike the clustering coefﬁcient deﬁned in [9],
we consider the hierarchy of ISP topologies. That is, we
ﬁrst categorize the topology into three layers; top-level
layer, middle-level layer, and bottom-level layer. We then
investigate the collaboration between the three layers, which
clariﬁes the topological structure of routerlevel topology.
The deﬁnition of the collaboration structure is deﬁned in
Section II.
The collaboration structure is also investigated for tran-
scriptional regulatory network [10]. The transcriptional reg-
ulatory network is one of the biological networks where
transcription factors are regulated by the gene in the cell.
In Ref. [10], the collaboration structure is investigated for
several species. The authors show that the complex organism
like human is more collaborated than the other organism
such as E. coli or yeast. One of the main reasons to focus
on the collaboration structure in router-level topologies is to
answer the question that the current router-level topologies
are designed well in terms of biological contexts. Our results
show that there is a clear difference on the collabora-
tion between the transcriptional regulatory network and the
router-level topologies: The collaboration between top-level
layer and middle-level is much lower in the router-level
topologies. We therefore investigate the effect to increase
the collaboration in the router-level topologies through the
rewiring operation to discuss the future direction to design
of router-level topologies.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we deﬁne
the collaboration in the networks. Section III presents the
degree of collaboration and reliability against random node
failures of router-level topologies, and compares with the
collaboration in biological networks. Then, we investigate
the effects of collaboration structure on the reliability by
changing the physical topology through the rewiring process.
Finally, we conclude this paper in Section V.
II. COLLABORATION IN NETWORKS
A. Collaboration in biological networks
The collaboration structure in transcriptional regulatory
network is investigated in Ref. [10]. In the cell of organisms,
there is a transcriptional regulatory network consisted of
transcription factors that are a kind of protein. The net-
work transmits information to regulate genes depending on
environmental insult. Collaboration in the transcriptional
regulatory networks is a co-regulation relationship where
two transcription factors regulate a transcription factor. Ac-
cording to the results of [10], more complex organism has
more collaboration structure.
There are some analogies between transcriptional regu-
latory networks and router-level topologies. For example,
the degree distributions of both networks exhibit power-low
attribute. Another analogy is the hierarchical structure. In the
transcriptional regulatory network, there are three level of
hierarchy; top-level, middle-level, and bottom-level. Router-
level topologies also have the hierarchy in the network;
for example, a core network connects with several regions
and/or state, a regional network, and an access network. We
therefore investigate the collaboration structure in router-
level topologies and show the difference, and then examine
for changing the collaboration structure to discuss the future
direction to design the router-level topologies.
B. Deﬁnition of hierarchy in router-level topologies
A key to identify the collaboration structure is to ﬁnd
a hierarchy, i.e., top-level, middle-level, and bottom-level
in the router-level topologies. We deﬁne top-level, middle-
level, and bottom-level nodes in the router-level topologies
as follows. We ﬁrst calculate Hi as the average hop-counts
from a node i to the other nodes. Then, we set a directed
link from node i to node j when Hi is lower than H j. That
is, when the node is located at the “center” of the network,
the node tends to be the top-level node that belongs to the
top-level. When the node is located at the “edge” of the
network, the node tends to be the bottom-level node that
belongs to the bottom.
More precisely, the top-level node is determined through
the modularity analysis [11]. We divide the topologies into
modules, and when the node has one or more links that
connect with other module is classiﬁed into the top-level
node. Note that, when there is a directional link from middle-
node to top-level node, we reverse the direction of the link
so as not to have links from lower level layer to the top-
level layer. When there is a directional link between top-level
nodes, we also change the directional link to be undirected.
For the remaining nodes, nodes that have both incoming and
outgoing links are classiﬁed into the middle-level nodes, and
nodes that have only the incoming links are classiﬁed into
the bottom-level nodes.
C. Deﬁnition of collaboration
Degree of collaboration is deﬁned in [10]. It is the fraction
of genes that are regulated by multiple transcription factors.
In this paper, in order to investigate collaboration inside
of topology, we adjusted the deﬁnition, that is, degree of
collaboration is the fraction of nodes that are regulated by
multiple nodes. Degree of collaboration does not depend on
number of nodes and links. Bhardwaj et al. [10] introduces
two types of degree collaboration. One is degree of collab-
oration in each layer DL
collab and the other one is degree of
collaboration between layers DL1,L2
collab−betw.
1) Degree of collaboration in each layer: Degree of
collaboration in each layer DL
collab represents the average of
Di
collab for all nodes i in L-level, where Di
collab is the number
of nodes that are co-regulated by node i and the another
node (A, for instance) divided by the nodes that are regulated
by node i. The formal deﬁnition of Di
collab and DL
collab is as
follows;

of nodes in L-level. To compare with several ISP topologies
that have different numbers of nodes/links, we modify the
deﬁnition of collaboration between layers to represents the

III. COLLABORATION STRUCTURE AND RELIABILITY OF
ROUTER-LEVEL TOPOLOGIES
A. Degree of collaboration
We ﬁrst evaluate the collaboration structure in eight
router-level topologies; AT&T, Sprint, Ebone, Exodus,
Level3, Telstra, Tiscal and Verrio [8]. These topologies
are obtained from traceroute-based network measurements,
which may require alias resolution. The rocketfuel in Ref.
[8] extended Mercator project’s method [12] and relaxed
the possibility of IP aliasing of routers to some extent.
For comparison purpose, we compare the results of router-
level topologies and ﬁve transcriptional regulatory networks,
E. Coli, human, mouse, rat and yeast, and model-based
two topologies (BA topology and ER topology [13]). For
each topology, we calculate the hierarchy and then obtain
the degree of collaboration in each layer and degree of
collaboration between layers. Note that we do not show
the degree of collaboration related to the bottom-level since
nodes in bottom layer do not regulate other nodes by our
deﬁnition of hierarchy.
We show the degree of collaboration in Figs. 4 and 5.
From the results of router-level topologies in Fig. 4, we
observe that difference between the degree of collaboration
of top-level and the degree of collaboration of middle-level
is less than 0.1. In contrast, the difference on transcriptional
regulatory network is large in general. More distinctive char-
acteristic of router-level topologies can be seen from Fig.
5. In the router-level topologies, the collaboration between
top-level and middle-level is marginal, whereas it is not in
the transcriptional regulatory network. One possible reason
to have such the marginal collaboration is the functionality
of middle-level nodes in the router-level topologies. That
is, the trafﬁc is ﬁrst aggregated at the middle-level nodes
and then forwarded to the top-level nodes. Thus, there are
no consideration on load-balancing between top-level nodes
and middle-level nodes.

B. Reliability
We next compare the reliability of router-level topologies
with that of the transcriptional regulatory networks. The
purpose of the comparison is to investigate how the degree
of collaboration discussed in previous section relates to the
reliability of networks. For this purpose, we consider the
random node failures in each network, and we evaluate the
ratio of nodes that are reachable from top-level nodes to the
number of nodes in the network. Hereafter, we call the ratio
as the reachable node ratio.
Figure 6 shows the reachable node ratio dependent on
the failure ratio. The failure ratio is deﬁned as the number
of failed nodes normalized by the number of nodes in
the original network. In obtaining the ﬁgure, nodes to fail
are selected randomly from a set of nodes in top-level or
middle-level nodes since bottom-level nodes are located at
the edge of the network and removing them does not give
the impact on the reachable node ratio. The results of the
router-level topologies are depicted as solid-lines without
symbols. We also depict the upper bound of the reachable
node ratio in the ﬁgure. From this ﬁgure, we observe that the
results of human (Hs), mouse (Mm), and yeast (Sc) is most
reliable among the organisms that we investigated, and is
close to the results of model-based topologies (BA topology
and ER topology). Looking again at Fig. 5, we notice that
these organisms exhibit a high collaboration between top-
level nodes and middle-level nodes, which increases the
number of alternative paths between top-level nodes and
bottom-level nodes. That is, it is expected to construct more

IV. EFFECTS OF COLLABORATION STRUCTURE ON THE
RELIABILITY
In the previous section, we show that the transcriptional
regulatory networks of human (Hs), mouse (Mm), and
yeast (Sc) is most reliable among the organisms that we
investigated, and ﬁnd that these organisms exhibit higher col-
laboration between top-level nodes and middle-level nodes,
while the router-level topologies exhibit lower collaboration
between them.
In this section, we investigate effects of collaboration
structure on the reliability. More speciﬁcally, we increase
the collaboration between top-level nodes and middle-level
nodes through the link-rewiring, and investigate differences
before and after the link-rewiring. Note that the actual ISP
network may increment links or capacity of links rather than
rewiring the links. However, we still consider to rewire the
link because our primal concern here is whether the increase
of collaboration improve the reliability or not.
A. Rewiring to increase the collaboration
We explain the link-rewiring operation to increase the col-
laboration between top-level and middle-level. The operation
consists from four steps as described below. The illustrative
example of each step is shown in Fig. 7.
Step. 1 Find a node X regulated by three or more nodes in
the same level. If several nodes are found, a node
is selected randomly.
Step. 2 Select a node Y randomly from the several nodes
that regulate the node X and that are in the same
level.
Step. 3 When the node Y is the middle-level node, ﬁnd a
node Z that is co-regulated only by the top-level
nodes. Otherwise, i.e., when the node Y is the top-
level node, ﬁnd a node Z that is regulated only by

Z
Step. 1 Node X is regulated by three
nodes included in the same layer.
Step. 2 Node Y is one of
nodes regulating Node X.
Step. 3 Node Z is regulated by
only nodes in one layer.
Step. 4 A link from
node Y to node X is
removed, and a link is
wired from node Y to
node Z.

the middle-level node. If there are several candi-
date for the node Z, select the node Z randomly.
Step. 4 Rewire a link between node Y and node X; remove
the link from node Y to node X, and wire a link
from node Y and node Z.
Note that, in Step. 1, when the node X is regulated by
only two nodes, rewiring the link leads to decrease the
collaboration in the layer (middle-layer in Fig. 7) that the
node Y belongs to.
This rewiring operation is continued until either of fol-
lowing termination conditions is satisﬁed.
1) There is no candidate for node X or node Z.
2) All nodes are regulated by both of top-level nodes and
middle-level nodes. With this case, the collaboration is
maximized, thus we do not need the link-rewiring.
The collaboration between layers after the rewiring oper-
ation is summarized in Fig. 8, and shows that the operation
certainly increase the collaboration between top-level and
middle-level.
B. Reliability of topologies after the link-rewiring
Lastly, we investigate the reliability of topologies after
the link-rewiring that increases the collaboration between
top-level and middle-level. Unlike Fig. 6 that evaluates the
connectivity of directed network after the node failures, we
present connectivity after the random node failures by using
the un-directed links instead of directed links, and evaluate
the difference between the original router-level topologies
and the topologies after the link-rewiring. In particular, we
use the cover ratio, which is deﬁned as S i
N where S i is the
number of nodes in the largest strong component after i-th
node failure, as the measure of the reliability.
Figure 9 shows the cover ratio of each topology after
the link-rewiring. We examined 300 trials of random node
failures and the average of them is plotted in the ﬁgure.
We can see that the cover ratio improves for the most of
router-level topologies except Sprint, Exodus, and Level3
which show a little improvement. The reasons are as follows.
The original Level3 topology has a lot of links and is
already collaborated well. That is, there is a little space to
improvement. The situation for the Sprint and Exodus is
different from Level3; the number of rewiring operations
in the Sprint and Exodus is 59 and 14 respectively, while
it is 221 in the AT&T topology. That is, the Sprint and
Exodus have a little opportunity to increase the collaboration
between the top-level and middle-level. The results of this
section indicate that the collaboration structure of topologies
characterizes the reliability, and the reliability improves to
some extent by increasing the collaboration.
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we investigated the collaboration structure in
router-level topologies, and showed that the collaboration be-
tween top-level nodes and middle-level nodes in router-level
topologies is less than that in the transcriptional regulated
networks. Because of this, the connectivity of router-level
topology is easily collapsed when node failures occur. In
order to reveal the possible evolution path to improve the
reliability of router-level topologies, we demonstrated that
the reliability of several topologies improves when the col-
laboration between the top-level and middle-level increases.
However, the improvement of reliability is limited in Sprint
and Exodus topologies due to the limited opportunity of link-
rewiring operations. That is, the evolution path to construct a
reliable network is limited. Our future work is to identify the
topological structure to prevent the link-rewiring opportunity
in router-level topologies.
