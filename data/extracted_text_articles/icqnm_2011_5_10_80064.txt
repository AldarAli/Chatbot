Abstract—Quantum networks are communication networks
in which adjacent nodes enjoy perfectly secure channels
thanks to quantum key distribution (QKD). Drawing end-
to-end security from QKD-supported point-to-point security
can be done by virtue of multipath transmission. This concept
buys security at the cost of strongly connected networks and
perfect routing. Particularly the latter is hard to ensure, since
congestions or (passive) eavesdropping may cause QKD key-
buffers to run empty, thus enforcing local re-routing of packets.
Hence, the adversary may use eavesdropping not to extract
information, but to redirect the information ﬂow towards a
relay-node that he controls. Such attacks can readily invalidate
the stringent requirements of multipath transmission protocols
and thus defeat any formal arguments for perfect secrecy.
Moreover, this form of ”indirect eavesdropping” seems to be
unconsidered in the literature so far. We investigate whether
or not unconditional security in a quantum network with non-
reliable routing is possible. Using Markov-chains, we derive
various sufﬁcient criteria for retaining perfect secrecy under
imperfect packet relay. In particular, we explicitly do not
assume trusted relay or quantum repeaters available.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum key distribution (QKD) [1] is renowned for
providing unconditional security over direct channels with
no intermediate nodes. Securing an entire network by means
of QKD calls for additional measures, as up to now, the
technology is still limited to point-to-point security. Cre-
ating end-to-end security has been subject of independent
research, culminating in multipath transmission regimes. The
latter can provide unconditional end-to-end security from
perfectly protected links, which is exactly what QKD can
do. However, most results in this area hinge on two major
ingredients: sufﬁcient graph connectivity and the sender
having the routing under full control. Since the requirements
for multipath transmission are stringent and therefore easily
invalidated, a passively eavesdropping adversary may cause
QKD key-buffers to run empty and thus enforce re-routing
of packets over a set of nodes under his control. Since
QKD can only protect links but not nodes, he can use
eavesdropping on a link to redirect and extract information
from another node. We call this indirect eavesdropping. Even
without the adversary becoming active, local congestions
may as well cause deviations from the intended routing, and
consequently destroy the protection of the secret message.
Our contribution in this paper is investigating the extent to
which quantum networks are resilient to such incidents.
Organization of the paper: We consider networks em-
ploying QKD for point-to-point- and multipath routing for
end-to-end security, referred to as quantum networks. For
convenience of the reader, we brieﬂy review the use of
QKD with multipath transmission in Section III. In Section
IV, we introduce a Markov-chain model for the path that
a data packet takes from the sender to the receiver, with a
particular focus to multipath transmission. Conditions under
which a random routing regime can yield perfect secrecy
are derived in Section V, with an example supporting the
practicability of our results in Section VI. Final remarks are
given in Section VII.
II. RELATED WORK
Most closely related to our work are the results in [2],
who provide a stochastic routing algorithm along with prob-
abilistic measures of secrecy in a randomly compromised
network. We improve on this by taking an existing routing
regime and giving conditions under which it can provide
perfect secrecy under random compromission. Motivated by
the physical distance limitations of practical QKD imple-
mentations (cf. [3], [4], [5] to name a few) in spite of the the-
oretical possibility of unlimited distance QKD transmission
[6], multipath transmission over disjoint channels remains a
theoretical necessity for perfect end-to-end security [7]. In
particular, [8], [9], [10], [11] and references therein form
the basis for our work, where our goal is investigating
a hidden assumption within these results: what happens
if the routing is random rather than fully controllable?
Implementations of multipath transmission within the TCP
protocol are currently under standardization, and many other
protocols like stream control transmission protocol (SCTP
[12]) as well facilitate concurrent transmission. Similarly
as for a recently proposed extension of SSL by QKD
[13], [14], one could imagine QKD being integrated in
such protocols. Load-balancing, local congestions and most
importantly (adversarial) eavesdropping can all cause re-
routing of packets and therefore make otherwise disjoint

routes intersecting. Our work is an explicit account for
security under such random distortions. To the best of our
knowledge, such indirect eavesdropping attacks have not yet
been considered elsewhere in the literature.
III. QKD-BASED MULTIPATH TRANSMISSION
Our adversary model will be a computationally un-
bounded passive threshold adversary Eve. That is, given a
network G = (V, E), with a sender s and receiver r (both
in V ), the adversary can compromise up to k ≤ |V \ {s, r}|
nodes in G (thanks to QKD, an activity on any of the
links would be detected anyway). Moreover, Eve knows all
relevant protocol speciﬁcation and the network topology, but
sticks to the protocol in a merely passive attempt to extract
secret content ﬂowing over the network.
For a string M ∈ {0, 1}∗, let |M| be its length (in bits),
and let H be the Shannon-entropy. We will use the following
security model (similarly to the model given in [7]):
Deﬁnition III.1. Let ε > 0, and let Π be a message
transmission protocol. Suppose that for conveyance of a
message M ∈ {0, 1}∗, the packets C1, . . . , Cn ∈ {0, 1}∗
are transmitted over the network (constituting the pro-
tocol’s transcript). The adversary’s view on the trans-
mission of M is adv(M) ⊆ {C1, . . . , Cn}. We call a
protocol ε-secure, if H(M|adv(M)) ∈ {0, H(M)} and
Pr[H(M|adv(M)) = 0] ≤ ε, i.e., the adversary can disclose
M with a chance of at most ε. We call the protocol Π
efﬁcient, if the size of the transcript, i.e., Pn
i=1 |Ci|, is poly-
nomial in the size of the message M, the size of underlying
network (in terms of nodes), and log 1
ε. A protocol that is
ε-secure for any ε > 0 is said to enjoy perfect secrecy.
It is easy to see that if a protocol is ε-secure with ε <
2−|M|, then simply guessing the message is more likely than
breaking the protocol itself.
Multipath transmission pursues a simple idea: having t
paths from s to r that are node-disjoint, the sender can
transmit a message m by ﬁrst putting it through a (t′, t)-
secret sharing (Shamir’s for instance), giving the shares
s1, . . . , st and sending each share over its own (distinct) path
to r. The adversary is successful if and only if he catches
at least t′ shares. Obviously, the scheme is unconditionally
secure if t′ > k (where k is the adversary’s threshold), but
in addition, we require full knowledge of the topology, and
assured delivery over the chosen disjoint paths. The general
interplay between network connectivity and unconditional
security has been studied extensively, and our goal in the
next section is ﬁnding out whether or not unconditional
security can be retained if the paths are not fully under
the sender’s control (i.e., what happens if the adversary
indirectly ﬁddles with the routing).
IV. A MARKOV-CHAIN ROUTING MODEL
Assume a quantum network modeled as a graph G =
(V, E) with |V | nodes and nb(v) denoting the set of v’s
neighbors. Formally, we put nb(v) := {u ∈ V |(v, u) ∈ E}.
For each v ∈ V , it is trivial to (empirically) estimate the
probability distribution supported on nb(v), indicating the
chances for a packet to leave towards the j-th neighbor. If
the transition from u to v is denoted as u → v, then this
(local) distribution comprises the probabilities Pr[u → vi]
where vi ∈ nb(u). The whole process can be considered
as a Markov chain, with the transition matrix P describing
the hops along which a data packet travels. In other words,
the ”chain” is the list of intermediate nodes that a packet
comes across, with the state of the chain being the node
that currently hosts the message before forwarding it. As
outlined in Section III, it is reasonable to assume a multi-
path transmission regime in the absence of inﬁnitely long
quantum channels. Hence, we will look at an ensemble of
t independently traveling packets with corresponding trajec-
tories (traces) starting off the nodes v1, v2, . . . , vt. Without
loss of generality, and to ease notation in the sequel, call
the starting nodes 1, 2, . . . , t, with the sender’s node being
number ”0”, having the neighborhood nb(0) = {1, 2, . . . , t}.
The receiver’s node has number r. So, |V | = r + 1 and
V = {0, 1, 2, . . ., r}.
To simplify technicalities, let us assume a synchronous
forwarding regime, i.e., the nodes simultaneously forward
their packets at ﬁxed times. Despite this assumption appear-
ing restrictive, it does in no way affect the validity of the
obtained results, as will become evident soon. In particular,
the derived formulas equally perfectly apply to a setting in
which nodes independently forward their data.
Let the distribution πi(n, v) : N × V →[0, 1] describe the
chance that the i-th trajectory (i = 1, 2, . . . , t) is within
node v at time n ∈ N. The whole distribution is denoted as
πi(n), and the whole ensemble of t trajectories is denoted
as π(n) = (π1(n), . . . , πt(n)). The particular state of the
i-th trajectory at time n is written as Xi(n). Consider an
arbitrary but ﬁxed trajectory i in the following. It is well
known from the theory of Markov chains that the state of
the i-th chain is governed by πi(n) = P n·pi(0), where P is
the transition matrix. Our chain has only a single absorbing
state, which is the receiver’s state r (the receiver will surely
not pass on his message any further). Furthermore, it can be
assumed irreducible, because if it were not, then there would
be at least two nodes u, v in the network whose chance of
getting a packet from u to v is zero, so they could never
communicate.
We write HjA for the time (measured in hops) that it takes
a trajectory to get from j to a set of A ⊆ V target nodes,
HjA = min {n ≥ 0 : Xi(n) ∈ A|X(0) = j} .
The probability hjA of the chain ever reaching A from j is
therefore hjA = Pr[HjA < ∞], and the family (hjA; j ∈ V )
is the smallest non-negative solution of the equation system
hjA =
X
i∈V
pjihiA,

where hjA = 1 for all j ∈ A and pji is the probability of
passing from node j onwards to node i (see [15, p.123] for
details). Writing down this system for, say n = 5 equations
with A = {1, 3}, we get (after some minor algebra),

(p22 − 1)h2A
+
p24h4A
−p41 − p43
=
p42h2A
+
(p44 − 1)h4A,
where we additionally substituted hrA = 0, as r is the only
absorbing state of our chains. Let us write (in a slight abuse
of notation) P−R,−C to denote the matrix P with all rows
in R and all columns in C deleted. Similarly, we use the
notation PR,C to denote the matrix P only with the rows in
R and columns in C retained. To ease notation, let us put
Q := P−r,−r, i.e., Q is P without the r-th row and column.
If I is the identity matrix, and 1 is the vector of all 1’s, then
the above equation system takes the compact form
−Q−A,A · 1 = (Q−A,−A − I)hA,
(2)
where hA is the family (h1A, h2A, . . . , hrA), excluding
hrA = 0 and hjA = 1 for all j ∈ A. In order to have
the values hj for j ̸= r and j /∈ A well-deﬁned, we ought
to show that (Q−A,−A − I) is invertible. This is our ﬁrst
Lemma IV.1. Let P be a stochastic matrix of an irreducible
Markov-chain with the state space V
and exactly one
absorbing state r ∈ V . Select any set of states A ⊂ V
with r ∈ A, and let Q = P−A,−A be the submatrix of P
that describes transitions between states outside of A. Then
Q − I is invertible.
Proof: Partition the state set V into V1 = A and V2 =
V \ A, then r ∈ V1 and Q describes transitions within V2.
For each v ∈ V2, write πV2(n, v) for the chance of the chain
being in state v after n steps. From the theory of Markov-
chains, we know that the vector πV2(n) = (πV2(n, v))v∈V2
is given by πV2(n) = QnπV2(0). As the chain is irreducible,
we will eventually reach r from any state in V2, and since r
is absorbing, this means that Qn → 0 as n → ∞. Now, put
(Q − I)x = 0. Then Qx = x and on iterating Qnx = x. As
n → ∞, Qnx = x → 0, so Q − I is invertible.
Lemma IV.1 helps constructing a formula giving us the
chance that exactly l trajectories pass through a given area
A ⊆ V
that is under the adversary’s control. We can
solve the system (2) for any given set A and see whether
it is passed with certainty. Similarly as for the binomial
distribution, we can ask for the probability of a subset of l
trajectories hitting A within ﬁnite time, with the remaining
ones never reaching A. The probability we are after is the
sum over all subsets of size l. Formally, we have
Proposition IV.2. Let a graph G = (V, E) be given, and
assume a random walk of t trajectories starting at nodes
1, 2, . . . , t. For a given A ⊆ V , the chance of l trajectories
passing through A is given by
p(A, l) =

M ⊆ [1 : t]
|M| = l

 Y
i∈M
hiA


 ,
where the vector hk = (hiA)i∈V is calculated as described
above (i.e., put hrA = 0, hjA = 1 for all j ∈ A, and
calculate the remaining probabilities by solving (2)). Here,
[1 : t] is a shorthand notation for the set {1, 2, . . ., t}.
V. PERFECT SECRECY UNDER RANDOM ROUTING
According to Proposition IV.2, the adversary will not learn
anything unless he conquers some set A that is passed by
sufﬁciently many, say l, trajectories. Consequently, his best
strategy is attacking the set with maximum likelihood of
seeing sufﬁciently many trajectories. It follows that the most
vulnerable subset of nodes in the network is
A∗ = argmax
A⊆V
Pr[l trajectories traverse A] = argmax
A⊆V
p(A, l).
(3)
The following result is an immediate consequence of the
above discussion:
Theorem V.1. A network with a routing regime described
by a transition matrix P can provide perfect secrecy if and
only if for some integer l ≥ 1, we have p(A, l) < 1 for all
A ⊆ V that the adversary can compromise.
Despite this maximum likelihood optimization problem
being sound, it is yet infeasible to evaluate as the number of
subsets to test is exponential (in the adversary’s threshold).
We shall therefore set out to ﬁnd sufﬁcient criteria that are
easier to test.
For a 1-passive adversary, we have the following criterion:
Theorem V.2. Let t = |nb(s)| ≥ 1 count the sender s’s
neighbors. If, for each v ∈ V , we have Pt
i=1 hiv < t,
then the network provides perfect secrecy against a 1-passive
adversary.
Proof: Put the secret message through a (t, t)-secret
sharing and let each share take its own individual path
through the network (i.e., do a random walk according to
the transition matrix P). With the random indicator variable
Ii,j :=
 1,
if hij > 0
0,
otherwise,
the number of trajectories passing through a node v ∈ V
is given by Nv := Pt
i=1 Ii,v, and its expected value is
E(Nv) = E(Pt
i=1 Ii,v) = Pt
i=1 hiv. The assertion now
directly follows from Markov’s inequality, since
Pr[Nv ≥ t] ≤ E(Nv)
t
< t
t = 1,
which holds for all v ∈ V . The network thus provides perfect
secrecy by Theorem V.1.

Theorem V.3. Let G = (V, E) be a graph, and let the
sender and receiver be s, r ∈ V . Let the adversary be k-
passive, i.e., up to k nodes in G can be compromised. For
perfect secrecy, it is necessary that |nb(s)| > k. In that case,
with V ∗ := V \ {s, r}, if
∀i ∈ nb(s) : hij ≤ 1
ek ∀j ∈ V ∗ \ {i} ,
then the network provides perfect secrecy.
Proof: Without loss of generality, assume s’s neighbors
to be the nodes {1, 2, . . . , t}, and put the secret message m
through a (t, t)-secret-sharing scheme, transmitting the i-
th share over the i-th neighbor of s (the remaining path of
each is individual and determined by the network’s transition
matrix P). Observe that the adversary will not learn anything
unless he gathers all t shares.
If t ≤ k, then the adversary can ”cut off” s from the rest
of the network, thus reading all information conveyed by s,
and perfect secrecy is impossible by Theorem V.1.
Assume t > k henceforth, so there exists at least one
honest neighbor of s in every attack scenario. Let A ⊆ V
with A = {j1, . . . , jk} be a set of compromised nodes. The
(mutually dependent) events T ji
l
for i = 1, 2, . . ., k occur
when the trajectory starting off the node l reaches node ji.
For each (starting node) l = 1, 2, . . . , t, we have
Pr
h
T ji
l
i
= hlji ≤ max {hlv|v ∈ V \ {l, s, r}} ≤ 1
ek ,
(4)
where the last inequality follows from our hypothesis. Since

e·k, then Lov´asz local lemma (symmetric ver-
sion) implies

(5)
In other words, the l-th trajectory has a positive chance
of evading the set {j1, . . . , jk}. Since inequality (4) holds
independently of the particular ji’s, (5) is true for all these
sets. If condition (4) holds for all l = 1, 2, . . ., t, then in
every attack scenario there is at least one trajectory with
a positive chance of not passing through the compromised
area in the graph. So, for every A ⊂ V with |A| ≤ k, it
holds that p(A, t) < 1 and the network can provide perfect
security.
Efﬁciency
Regarding the bandwidth demand, we require the overall
network trafﬁc (bit complexity) and round complexity to
be polynomial in log 1
ε for any chosen ε > 0. Assume
the network satisﬁes the condition for perfect secrecy in
Theorem V.1.
Fix some ε > 0. We will prove the following transmission
regime to enjoy efﬁcient bit- and round-complexity, i.e.,
polynomial efforts in log 1
ε. Let the secret message trans-
mitted from s to r be m:
1) put m through a (n, n)-secret sharing, giving the
shares s1, . . . , sn (the number n will be determined
below).
2) for i = 1, 2, . . . , n do the following: put the i-th share
si through a (t, t)-secret sharing, where t = |nb(s)|,
and transmit the j-th share of si over the j-th neighbor
of s.
Obviously, the attacker will not learn anything unless he
gets all the information ﬂowing over the network (due to
the (n, n)- and (t, t)-sharings). Our task is proving n to
be polynomial in log 1
ε and the size of the network. For
the proof, deﬁne an indicator variable for each round i =
1, 2, . . . , n via
Ii =

1,
if the share si was disclosed;
0,
otherwise,
so that Ii measures the adversary’s success (in a binary scale)
in the i-th round. By our hypothesis, Theorem V.1 implies
Pr[Ii = 1] < 1 for all rounds i and all sets of nodes that the
adversary could have conquered (recall that the adversary is
k-passive). Put ρ := maxi=1,2,...,n Pr[Ii = 1], then ρ < 1.
Since 0 ≤ Ii ≤ 1 for all i, the ﬁrst moment E(Ii) exists
and Ii’s deviation from its mean is bounded by −1 ≤ Ii −
E(Ii) ≤ 1 for all i. Deﬁne S := Pn
i=1 Ii, then since E(Ii) ≤
ρ, we get E(S) = Pn
i=1 E(Ii) ≤ nρ. Moreover, S −E(S) ≥
S − nρ ≥ τ for some τ to be ﬁxed later. Application of a
variant of Hoeffding’s inequality (with relaxed independence
constraints; see [16]) gives
Pr[S − nρ ≥ τ] ≤ Pr[S − E(S) ≥ τ] ≤ exp

Since

for all δ ≥ 0. By construction, the adversary is successful
if and only if Ii = 1 for all rounds i = 1, 2, . . . , n, or
equivalently, mini Ii = 1. Choosing δ := 1 − ρ > 0, the
number n of rounds until Pr[mini Ii ≥ ρ + δ = 1] < ε is
achieved comes to n ∈ O

VI. APPLICATION TO QUANTUM NETWORKS
It is important to emphasize that Theorems V.1, V.2 and
V.3 should not directly be applied to the communication
network at hand. Instead, we are interested in estimating the
harm that any deviation from a prescribed routing strategy
causes. Going back to multipath transmission, our goal is
using the results from the previous section to classify a
given network as (in)secure under the assumption of random
detours that a packet takes upon local congestions or empty
local quantum-key-buffers.
We illustrate the application of Theorem V.3 using a
simple example, which we hope demonstrates the general
line of reasoning. Take the network shown in Figure 1, with
each link secured by means of QKD. Alice (node 1) per-
forms a multipath communication over three disjoint chan-
nels ρ1 = (1 → 2 → 3 → 8), ρ2 = (1 → 5 → 6 → 8), ρ3 =
(1 → 4 → 7 → 8) (shown bold) to Bob’s node 8. Assume
that each node does the packet forwarding reliably, up
to some chance of α for the packet to deﬂect from the
prescribed route. Thus, assuming stochastic independence
for the sake of simplicity, with probability 1 − αlength(ρi)−2,
the packet will travel over ρi as desired. Notice that any
path is accessible from any other, and that an adversary will
surely not waste resources by attacking anywhere else than
on the chosen paths. Hence, we can create an abstract model
for such a multipath transmission by restricting the focus on
whether the packets travel as desired (likelihood determined
by the reliability of routing, i.e., the probability of the packet
not deviating from its prescribed route), or whether they
take detours (should happen with a small chance only) that
could yield to intersecting paths and disclosure of the secret
message.
For the analysis of a general network G = (V, E) under
a multipath transmission scenario, we therefore consider the
auxiliary graph G′ = (V ′, E′): let ρ1, . . . , ρt be paths in G,
then each of these becomes a node in G′, which is connected
to the sender and receiver, so put V ′ := {ρ1, . . . , ρt}∪{s, r}.
Attacking elsewhere than on the paths ρ1, . . . , ρt is less
paying for the adversary than compromising the paths
themselves, so we may safely disregard any nodes in the
network that are not on a chosen path. Also, assume that a
packet can jump from any path to any other, so the nodes
ρ1, . . . , ρt form a clique. Finally, each path ρi is connected
ρ1

ρ3
r
s
Figure 2.
Auxiliary graph G′ describing state transitions
to the receiver r in a one-way manner, as the receiver
is absorbing and will not pass anything further. Similarly,
the sender is (one-way-)connected to all his chosen paths,
though these transitions are of no further interest, since
an accidental jump from a path back to the sender can
trivially be corrected by the sender putting the packet back
on its correct path. The set of edges therefore comes to
E′ = {ρ1, . . . , ρt}2 ∪ {(ρi, r), (s, ρi)|i = 1, 2, . . ., t}. The
resulting transition graph for the example is depicted in
Figure 2, with arrows indicating possible state transitions.
The topology of the auxiliary graph G′, excluding the
transitions from s to each ρi (for obvious reasons) deﬁnes
the Markov-chain on which we can invoke the results
from Section V. For the analysis, it remains to specify the
following likelihoods:
• Pr[ρi → r]: with the parameter α as above, this is
Pr[ρi → r] = 1−αlength(ρi)−2. Notice that several events
of node failure are not necessarily independent, and
correlations among these must be considered in a more
accurate (perhaps more realistic) model.
• Pr[ρi → ρj]: this quantity depends on the particular
chances of jumping from a node on ρi to any node on
ρj, and must be worked out individually for the network
at hand. For the sake of simplicity and illustration,
we assume an equal likelihood of jumping on any
other path once ρi is left. For the example, we take
Pr[ρi → ρj] =
1
t−1(1 − Pr[ρi → r]).
Since the jumps from the sender to each of his chosen paths
are uninteresting, we do not need to model the corresponding
transition probabilities, nor must these appear in the transi-
tion matrix of the Markov-chain. These links are merely
included to have G′ consistent with our criteria, and are
therefore shown dashed.
With α = 0.01, we end up ﬁnding the transition matrix:
P =

Now, we can use Theorem V.3 on this matrix to see that the
network is indeed secure against a 2-passive adversary: with
V ∗ = {1, 2, 3} and by solving (2) for A = {1} , {2} , {3},
we ﬁnd hij =

It follows that the network remains secure even under

much less reliable routing. Indeed, we can tolerate up to
α ≈ 0.155, i.e., a more than 15% chance of the packets
becoming re-routed via indirect eavesdropping or congestion
control. Finally, Theorem V.4 tells that resilience against
such incidents can be retained efﬁciently.
VII. CONCLUSION
We have obtained simple criteria for protection against
passive adversaries. Carrying over our results for active
(Byzantine) adversaries, one needs a slightly different trans-
mission technique. In fact, (k, n)-secret sharing is resilient
against an active adversary compromising up to ⌊(n−k)/2⌋
shares [17]. Future work will include reﬁning and adapting
our criteria for Byzantine adversaries, as well as inves-
tigating transmission efﬁciency (notice that the proof of
Theorem V.4 no longer holds for active adversaries. Still,
QKD enhanced multipath routing can indeed bring perfect
secrecy to future networks, even without much change to
the existing routing regimes apart from using QKD. More
detailed examples are subject to ongoing research in the
context of a project where this framework is going to be
tested empirically. We will report on this in future papers.
Our results are only indirectly dependent on the quantum
nature of the network, as the attack targets the multipath
transmission regime only by exploiting general QKD prop-
erties. These are, moreover, independent of the particular
QKD-implementation, and equally well apply to discrete or
continuous quantum information encodings. In general, any
successful denial-of-service attack, regardless of whether on
a conventional or quantum line, can be used for indirect
eavesdropping in the described form, as soon as secure
multipath transmission is used.
This work is an explicit account for an adversary who
turns the QKD eavesdropping detection against the network.
If end-to-end security is set up by means of multipath trans-
mission, then ”disconnecting” (by eavesdropping) otherwise
adjacent nodes may enforce local re-routing of packets and
in turn direct the information ﬂow right into the adversary’s
hands. We presented various sufﬁcient criteria for this kind
of ”indirect eavesdropping attacks” to be repealable. In
general, our criteria can be used to decide whether or not
a network retains perfect secrecy under randomly compro-
mised nodes and routes.
