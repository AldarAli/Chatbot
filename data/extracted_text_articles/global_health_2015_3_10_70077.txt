Abstract— Visual synchronization tasks are difficult. We need
intensive brain activity for completing visual synchronization
tasks. Recently, we can measure the precise movement of a
human with cheap and easy to use sensors. We propose a
method to estimate the total brain activity using the precise
measurement of the motor of a human body. This paper
measures the movement of hands of a human synchronizing
the example movement presented on a display. With the
Fourier analysis of the movements, we propose to measure the
synchronization of hands. This measure helps to detect a small
change of the brain activity that might be indicative of brain
diseases. As a result, the measure helps to detect a small
symptom of brain diseases.
Keywords-motor measurement; cerebral dysfunction.
I.
INTRODUCTION
There are many motor tasks that measure the abilities of
motor functions of a human. They are the Purdue pegboard
task, a seal affixation task, a tray carrying task, etc. [1][2][3].
These tasks estimate the ability of a motor function of a
human based on the results of the tasks. There is no
observation of the process of the tasks.
There are also some synchronization tasks used to
measure
human
abilities.
For
example,
they
are
synchronization of ﬁnger taps with periodically ﬂashing 
visual
stimuli
and
synchronization
with
an
auditory
metronome. In these tasks, the timing between the stimuli
and the tapping is measured. There is no observation of the
process of the tapping [4][5][6][7][8][9][10].
Recently, many cheap and easy measurement methods
for the movements of a human body have been developed.
For instance, some of these sensors include Kinect sensor,
and
Leap
motion
sensor
[11][12].
There
are
many
applications that use those sensors for controlling computers.
For instance, there are many video games that use those
sensors for controlling an avatar in the games [13].
Many researchers report that many kinds of brain
disorder affect motor functions. In this paper, we propose a
method measuring motor functions that are reflections of
many brain functions. If we can measure the motor functions
that reflect all the brain functions, the measurement reflects
the total brain activity. As a result, in case of any brain
disorder, the measurement of motor functions will reveal
some symptom about the disorder.
The human hands are the parts of a body that can make
the most complex movements. This paper proposes a method
that measures the precise movements of hands synchronizing
the movements of hands on a display. The synchronization
needs visual perception of the displayed hands’ images and
precise control of the arm muscles.
We can now precisely measure the movement of hands.
This paper proposes a new synchronization task and the
evaluation method. The resulting measure is very sensitive.
With this measure, we can observe the developments of the
motor function and infer on brain activity.
First, we discuss the synchronized hands’ movements
with visual presentation. Then, this paper proposes the
outline of the proposed observation system for visual
synchronization of hands’ motions. Next, we show our
implementation of the observation system. Then, we discuss
the brain function estimation method using the measured
visual synchronization. Next, we show our experimental
results and conclude this work.

VISUAL SYNCHRONIZATION TASK
There are many motor tasks that intend to measure the
motor function of a human. However, most of these tasks
measure the results of the tasks. There are some tasks that
measure the synchronization between a finger tap and
stimuli. With human observations, it is difficult to measure
the process of synchronizing movements. Now, we can use a
Kinect sensor and a Leap Motion sensor. Those sensors

measure the three-dimensional movements of a human body.
With these sensors, we can measure the precise movements
of a human body.
We can synchronize our movements with each other. For
instance, in playing a dance, dancers can synchronize their
movements with each other. A synchronization of movement
is more difficult work than a simple imitation of movement.
To generate synchronized movements, we need to observe
the motion to be synchronized. We need to generate the
motion to be similar to the motion synchronized. We need to
observe the generated motion synchronizing the original
motion. We need to estimate the divergence between the
original motion synchronized and the motion synchronizing
the original motion. We need to control the speed of the
motion synchronizing. These functions make the feedback
loop. However, for compensating our brain’s processing
delay, we need to estimate the delay itself and make
feedforward.
This processing loop is shown in Fig. 1. For estimating
the total brain function, we need to include all the functions
of a brain. The visual synchronization task includes vision
and motor functions. The vision includes not only the static
sight, but also the dynamic sight.
The visual synchronization is more difficult than audio
synchronization. So, we observe the wider brain functions
with
the
visual synchronization
tasks
than the audio
synchronization tasks.
Our
proposed
visual
synchronization
task
is
the
synchronization between the position of stimuli on a display
and the position of hands. Our synchronization task is not the
synchronization between the timing of stimuli and the timing
of action. The measurement of timing is only one scalar
value.
In
our
proposed
synchronization
task,
the
measurements of positions between the stimuli and the hands
are the sequence of a triple of the position of the stimuli and
the ones of both hands.
III.
VISUAL SYNCHRONIZATION OBSERVATION SYSTEM
Classical synchronization tasks measure the timing
between the result of action and the stimuli. We observe the
process of synchronization between the stimuli and the
motion.
A.
Stimuli
For the motor task, we select the rotation of both hands.
Rotation is a difficult movement of a hand. For analyzing the
synchronization easily, we make the stimuli follow a precise
sine curve. If stimuli form a precise sine curve, we easily
evaluate the observed motion comparing with the sine curve.
Fig. 2 shows the sequence of stimuli. The images are
proposed on display with a constant interval from top to
bottom. And then, they are proposed from bottom to top.
These two sequences make one cycle of the stimuli of hands’
motion. In the stimuli images, the right hand and the left
hand are the same. The right one is the mirror image of the
left one.
B.
Stimuli generation
Our stimuli are a displayed video of both hands’ rotation.
However, in a normal video, it is difficult to control precisely
the motion of hands in the video to follow the sine curve. It
is also difficult to evaluate the synchronization between the
stimuli and the motions of hands. We propose the stimuli
generation method that displays a proper image at the precise
timing.

C.
Hands’ rotation measurement
We use the Leap motion sensor for measuring the
position and the pose of both hands [12]. With the Leap
motion sensor, the measurements are not performed at a
fixed interval. However, the Leap motion sensor measures
the position and the pose of hands about 120 times within a
second. We determine the precise position and pose at every
1/100 S with interpolating linearly between two adjacent
measurements.
D.
Synchronization measure
We define the synchronization measure using FFT (Fast
Fourier Transform) results of the estimated poses of both
hands
in
each
cycle.
If
a
subject
makes
complete
synchronization to the stimuli, the resulting pose of both
hands follow a complete sine curve. As a result, at every
cycle of the rotation of hands, the result of FFT has a zero
value at the second term or higher terms. We define the
measure as (1). This measure increases with the amount of
the difference from ideal sine curve.

is the power of the
lowest frequency. This represents a one cycle of a hand’s
rotation. If the rotation of a hand follows the stimuli images
precisely, the
carries all powers of the hand’s rotation.
Other terms carry no power. In the case, the measure in (1) is
0.
is a value that represents the average of poses. This is
not included in (1). As a result, this measure does not depend
the absolute poses of hands.
We call this measure as
Non-Smoothness-Measure
(NSM). This measure may span from 0 to infinite.
Our proposed system observes two hands. So at every
cycle, we have two NSMs.
IV.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED SYTEM THAT
MEASURES VISUAL SYNCHRONIZATION
A.
System Overview
The visual synchronization measurement system has two
major parts. One part displays the intended hand’s motion,
and the other part measures the position and the pose of
hands with the Leap motion sensor. These two main parts
must work smoothly. The stimuli must be updated at precise
timing. The measurements of the position and the pose of
hands must continue without interruption. To perform these
requirements, our proposed implementation has two main
processes. One process works to display stimuli images, and
the other records the position and the pose of hands.
We use Python and Pyglet for implementing the system
[14]. Pyglet is an object-oriented programming interface for
developing games and other visually-rich applications [15].
B.
Stimuli Image
For creating stimuli images, we recorded the hands’
rotation images with the measured hands’ positions and
poses. Then, we selected the images that fit for the sine curve.
The selected sequence of hands’ images fits for the sine
curve.
C.
Stimuli Image Presentation
With the progress of time, our proposed system selects
the most proper image and proposes on a display. This
stimuli image presentation takes a one process. There is no
intervention from other processes, for instance, hands’
rotations measurement.
D.
Hands’ Rotations Measurement
We use the Leap-Motion-Sensor for measuring the hands
poses. To measure the pose of hands, we can use attached
type sensors. The attached type sensors have enough
accuracy and measuring speed. However, we need longer
setup time. This prevents the easy and fast measurement. The
sensor measures the pose of hands at each 1/100 S. The
measurement includes the positions and the poses of both
hands. The measured record has about 700 KB in 25 second.
The system must record all data without loss. This measuring
shares a one process. As a result, there is no intervention
from the Stimuli image presentation. The sensor works in
enough speed.
V.
EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS
We made two types of experiments. One experiment
elucidates the distributions among normal people. The other
does the changes on a person.
A.
Experiments Setup
From the pre-experiments, the speed of the hands’
rotation is best at one cycle per second. Subjects need about
10 S to synchronize their movements of hands to the
proposed motion images. As a result, one session of an
experiment needs at least 11 S. For getting reliable results,
we decide that the length of a session is 25 cycles of
rotations. This means that one session needs 25 S. Before
starting a session, we instruct a subject to synchronize their
hands to the displayed hands’ images.
B.
Session Non-Smoothness Measure
At each session, we have 25 cycles’ measurements. As a
result, we have 25 pairs of NSMs (Non-Smoothness
Measure). Our observation shows that a subject needs about
10 S for synchronizing to the proposed images. So, we

exclude first 10 cycles. As a result, at each session, we have
a sequence of 15 pairs of NSMs.
At a single cycle, there may be some distributions. We
select three continuous cycles’ average of NSMs to evaluate
the synchronization. At each session, we select the minimum
of three continuous cycles’ averages of NSMs as the NSM
for the session at each hand. The NSM is computed at each
hand. We have two points that the average of continuous
three NSMs is the smallest. At each point, we have a pair of
the averages of continuous NSMs. They are the average
NSMs of the left and right hands. As a result, we have four
average NSMs.
A pair has the average NSM at left hand and the average
NSM at right hand, when the average NSM of the left hand
is minimum. And, another pair has the average NSM at left
hand and the average NSM at right hand, when the average
NSM of the right hand is minimum. From the four NSMs,
we decide that the session’s NSM is the minimum of all four
NSMs.

C.
Distribution on Normal adult people
There are 19 subjects whose ages span from 18
years old to 27 years old. They include three females.
Fig. 3 shows the relation between the session
NSM and the average NSM. In many cases, the
average NSM and the session NSM have linear
relation.
Each subject tries two sessions. There are 38
sessions.
However,
at
some
sessions
rotation
measurements fail. As a result, we have 31 valid
sessions of normal subjects. Table I shows 31 valid
sessions’ NSMs and one subject who declares
weakness
in
sport. In the subject column,
M
represents a male. The number is the age. The ‘Right’
is the position where the right hand’s NSM is
minimum. The ‘Left’ is the position where the left
hand’s NSM is minimum. The ‘Right/R’ stands for
the NSM of the right hand at the position where the
right hand’s NSM is minimum. The ‘Left/R’ stands
for the NSM of the left hand at the position where the
right hand’s NSM is minimum. The ‘Right/L’ and
the ‘Left/L’ do respectively.
The average is 0.35. The normal distribution is
0.10. The distribution is small. The range of NSM
under 1.0 include over 0.9999999999. In most of the
sessions, the session NSM and the average NSM are
nearly same. However, at two sessions, they are
different. We can conclude that the session NSM and
the average NSM are nearly same in a normal person.
If the average NSM and the session NSM are
different, there may be a problem at the measurement
or the subject.
D.
Subject weak in sports
We have one subject who declares his weakness
in sports. The last raw in Table I shows NSM of a
subject who is weak in sports. The session NSM is
very large, and it differs
from the average of
NSMs of the normal people.
E.
Personal diurnal variation
With two
subjects, we observe the diurnal
variations. They are 25 years old and 27 years-old
males.
In
this
experiment,
we
measure
the
performance at every 30-minute interval from 9:00 to
18:00. Table II and Table III show the experimental
results. There are some missing data. Figure 3 and
Fig. 4 shows the session NSMs in time series. In the
figures, the linear estimation form and
are shown.
Their linear approximation shows a little increase in
the time course. This may show the accumulation of
fatigue. However, the
is lower than 0.5. The
number of experiments is not large enough for
concluding. In the afternoon, the two subjects show a
large increase of the NMS. At the time, they may be
a little sleepy. At the time, the brain activity may be a
little lower than a normal state.
The averages are 0.30 and 0.31. The normal
distributions are 0.07 and 0.04. The diurnal variation

of a person is smaller than the inter-individual variation. As a
result, we have the reliable NSM of a person with a small
number of trials.
F.
Discussions about Brain Activity
In subsection D, the NSMs of healthy peoples converges
on 0.35. In subsection E, the diurnal variation is smaller than
the inter-individual variation.
If the NSM is large, there is a problem of the motor
functions. The cause of the problem may not only be the
disorder about brain functions, but also be the disorder about
nerves, muscles, etc. Our proposed method cannot find the
cause of the motor disorder. However, if there is no change
in the functions about nerves, muscles, etc., the increase of
the NSM shows the disorder about the brain.
If we have the NSMs about a person in a long term, the
increase of the NSM shows the new disorder about brain
function.
VI.
CONCLUSION
The pair of the proposed synchronization task and the
evaluating
method
enable
to
measure
the
precise
performance of the motor function of hands. The task is easy
to perform. For instance, it needs merely 25 S. The proposed
Non-Smoothness
Measure
has
enough
power
of
discrimination between normal people and people that has
some motor problems.
This NSM can be used for evaluate the development of
the motor function of children. This NSM detects very small
disorder of the brain activity. For normal people, the NSMs
concentrate on a small range. The personal diurnal variation
is small enough for detecting small disorder of brain activity.
We will perform larger scale experiments in the next step.
