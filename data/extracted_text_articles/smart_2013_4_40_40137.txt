 INTRODUCTION 
The introduction of Smart Grid to the home caused 
promoting itself to zero-energy management technology and 
the built-environment related technology development, thus 
making the management of climate change possible and 
attaining improvement for the quality of life for citizens. The 
government provides 1 million green homes by 2018 by 
supporting the public housing corporation’s annual target of 
100,000 green homes between 2009 and 2018 and reducing 
energy consumption in the residential sector by 30% [1]. 
We develop the home energy management system 
(HEMS) type of platform for green home, which is 
composed of home clients (server) and operation (complex 
home) server. The energy management platform technology 
for green homes monitors and controls all detailed energy 
usage to provide an efficient energy management function, 
which reduces carbon-emission from the house by 
optimizing the energy consumption such as electric 
consumption in the home. The aim of the technology is to 
achieve no-carbon emission in the home, which is based on 
interfacing the home area network and service and includes 
IT convergence hardware and software technologies. It 
consists of an integrated monitoring interface module and 
energy management framework technologies which provide 
functions for green energy management, remote energy 
control, and energy service management.  
Testbed for Zero Carbon Green Home located in Korea 
Institute of Construction Technology (KICT) is R&D project 
with Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute 
(ETRI) and Korea Institute Energy Research (KIER). 
Testbed is being constructed to conserve energy by active 
energy technologies (energy management system, renewable 
energy, etc.) and passive energy technologies (heat-shield, 
smart-window system, ventilation, etc.). To manage the 
energy, we are developing Home Energy Management 
System. 
HEMS 
provide 
energy 
management 
and 
optimization system, connecting devices and equipment that 
create, store and save energy. Energy flow and consumption 
within household can be monitored on displays such as wall 
pad (In-Home Display) by using green home server to 
connect up smart meter, water meter and smart appliances 
[2].  
In this paper, we provide economic analysis of energy 
and payback period by using HEMS. We also describe the 
energy saving for home. This paper is organized as follows. 
In Section 2, we explain the related works of testbed for the 
green home. We describe scenario of the energy economic 
and energy savings when we equipped with HEMS in each 
household in Section 3, and present our conclusions in 
Section 4.

RELATED WORKS 
The home energy management platform technology for 
green homes monitors and controls all detailed energy usage 
to provide an efficient energy management function by 
optimizing the energy consumption such as electric power 
consumption in the green home test-bed. Green home 
testbed located in KICT are made of fifteen households on 
the 3rd through 8th floors and control (operation) center on 
2nd floor for total energy management. HEMS is composed 
of two parts: green home server, which is part of each 
household, and control center, which covers the entire green 
home complex with respect to all households energy 
management [3]. Green home testbed to verify and monitor 
energy performance had planned to complete by the end of 
2012. But, Construction was delayed and completed in 
March 2013. It been delayed for three month. Figure 1 
shows the overview of green home testbed.

Also, green home is a no-carbon emission house in which 
all required energy for its life is provided by itself based on 
renewable energy. The testbed is equipped with solar energy 
and connected to the grid with an installed capacity of 34.66 
kW and 34kW solar inverter. It consists of an integrated 
monitoring interface module with solar energy which 
provides functions for renewable energy management, 
remote energy control, and energy service management (see 
Figure 3).

SCENARIO  
A. Conceptual model for analysis   
In this paper, we described the development of HEMS 
which is interconnecting with various smart appliance and 
renewable energy. We need to analyze how much energy we 
save, as much as how much energy we use after we equip 
each household with HEMS.   
To analyze the energy saving, we categorized each 
testbed based on the size of the floor space. The Energy 
Consumption of home changes according to testbed floor 
spaces. The testbed is composed of three floor space: 
38.36 ㎡, 62.25 ㎡, 84.75 ㎡. Table 1 shows the electric 
energy consumption that is classified as monthly and yearly 
(see Table. I).

Testbed was completed in March 2013. It been delayed 
for three month. For that reason, the interior was not 
equipped with smart appliances for analysis of energy use. 
We estimated the energy consumption based on the data of 
KPX in Table II. The energy consumption patterns are 
classified into eight types by floor spaces. We choose 
energy us to compare testbed floor spaces.

In this paper, we assume that energy saving rate is an 
11.12 percent based on the other project (2012) named 
‘smart home network industry infrastructure development’. 
The other project is now under way in Naju, Korea. It 
replaced an old-fashioned home network infrastructure with 
a new one. The other project has no regard for renewable

We developed low-power energy metering and control 
module based on wireless communication (IEEE 802.15.4) 
for smart appliance. It is plugged to each smart appliance 
and communicates with green home server [10]. We can 
check the information measured instantaneous power and 
accumulated power (see Figure 5).   
Since the household is equipped with HEMS, we can 
check the status of energy usage of home. In Fig. 6, we can 
see the monitoring of energy consumption for each smart 
appliance.

In this paper, we calculate the average of energy saving 
after the home energy platform was installed. We have 
calculated two averages: a monthly average and a yearly

As testbed was equipped with the solar energy, we are 
considering energy saving with renewable energy.  
The capacity of PV module is 34.66kW. The amount of 
average solar radiation in Korea is 3.92 kWh/㎡day, total 
design factor is 0.75. We calculate the amount of solar 
energy generation. It is 37,193.65 kWh/㎡ and the monthly 
amount of solar energy generation is 206.63 kWh/㎡ in 
testbed. Table IV shows the amount of energy consumption 
when equipped with solar energy. People who live on bigger 
floor space consume more energy than those who live on 
smaller floor space.

Energy saving of the house increased after the solar energy 
installed. A yearly average of energy saving cost is $344.69. 
People who live on the smallest house can sell electricity 
45.9kWh each month to utilities companies. Also, the largest 
house saved quadruple the energy (money) compared to the 
amount of energy used before the installation of home 
network. The largest house in testbed will save $467.09 after 
their installation of solar energy (see Table. IV).  
 
C. Case stugy economic analysis 
For an economic analysis, we calculate the energy saving 
with HEMS. We assume the annual electric charge saving is 
$106.83 in each household because the 84.75 square meters 
is the average of floor space. Next, we estimate HEMS 
installation cost when HEMS is universally available in 
home. As a result, the payback period is 4 years. Table V 
shows the estimation of total cost and payback period.

For an economic analysis, we calculate the energy saving 
with HEMS and renewable energy. We assume the annual 
electric charge saving is $467.09 in each household because 
the 84.75 square meters is the average of floor space. Next, 
we calculate solar energy installation cost when HEMS is 
universally available in home. As a result, the payback 
period is 7.23 years. Table VI shows the estimation of total 
cost and payback period.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  
The Korean government announced an obligatory plan for 
new houses that mandates 90% reduction in cooling/heating 
energy consumption starting from 2017 and a zero energy 
house level starting from 2025. In order to accomplish these 
goals, passive and active systems need to be in place.  
In this paper, we described the development of HEMS, 
which is interconnecting with various smart appliance and

renewable energy. Also, we calculated the average of 
energy saving by month and year when the home energy 
platform and renewable energy were installed. These results 
are expected to contribute the support of the government-
driving green home supply project, and reduce the energy 
saving cost).  
For the future work, we will apply energy storage system 
and electric vehicle charging station in home. They will be 
controlled and managed by HEMS. And we calculate and 
estimate energy savings and payback period when installing 
energy storage system near the future.
