Abstract—With the spread of smartphones, it is easy to obtain 
sensor data from users, and location-based service (LBS) 
becomes the most common service in mobile industry. 
Predicting the user's destination can lead to a variety of services 
in mobile devices. In addition to the user’s final destination, the 
locations during movement are also important in LBS. In this 
paper, we propose a destination prediction method based on 
hidden Markov models for representing the paths using sensor 
data from smartphone and identifies the destination and 
intermediate locations in future moving with visiting 
probabilities. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the 
proposed method, we compare it with Dynamic Time Warping 
(DTW), a method of template matching. Experiments with the 
data collected by 10 college students for five months confirm 
that the proposed method results in 12.67 times faster and 2.88 
times more accurate than the DTW. 
Keywords-destination prediction; forecasting; hidden Markov 
model; location-based service.

 INTRODUCTION 
The proliferation of smartphones facilitates to obtain 
various sensor data from the users, and a wide range of 
services using a variety of sensor data are introduced. 
Location-based service (LBS) is the most common service for 
utilizing the sensor information. It can extract key locations 
and identify the exact coordinates using user location provided 
by smartphone. Also, it predicts where the user moves next 
and provides the information required in the future in advance 
[1]. As a result, the technology to predict the destinations and 
movements of the user is required in mobile environment. 
Users make a trajectory by moving locations along the 
flow of time. A trajectory based on the information of 
locations visited can be obtained. Prediction of destination is 
to find out the next location in future based on the information 
of movements until now. In other words, when the 
information of location movement is 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦𝑡 =
{𝐿1, 𝐿2, ⋯ , 𝐿𝑡} until the current time 𝑡 , the prediction of 
location is to find out the location 𝐿𝑡+𝑛 at time 𝑡 + 𝑛. 
In order to search 𝐿𝑡+𝑛, we should look for a movement 
which has the same pattern with 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦𝑡 in the past [2]. 
As a path is a subsequence of trajectory, the path becomes a 
moving pattern. Path is a set of locations, each of which is 
constructed by temporal and spatial information. 
The problem of predicting destination can be defined 
using the path. The past path 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙  with the highest 
similarity using the current moving path 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡  is 
determined, and the endpoint of path 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙 is said to be 
the destination 𝐿𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛. 
In this paper, we propose a destination prediction method 
which utilizes hidden Markov models for representing the 
paths using sensor data from smartphone, estimates the 
destination 𝐿𝑡+𝑛 based on 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 , and finds out the 
intermediate locations 𝐿 ∈ {𝐿𝑡+1, 𝐿𝑡+2, ⋯ , 𝐿𝑡+𝑛−1} . The 
problem of destination prediction is shown in Fig. 1.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the related works in destination prediction. Section 
III describes the proposed method. The proposed method 
consists of constructing model and predicting destination.

RELATED WORKS 
The study of destination prediction is related with 
comparing the information of previous visits with the current 
location of visit along the flow of time, in order to identify the 
destination. The trajectory of locations along the flow of time 
can be expressed as time series data. There are three types of 
classification methods for time series data. First, feature-based 
classification finds the decision boundary. Second, the 
sequence distance-based classification method classifies using 
the class of closest distance of time-series data. Third, the

probable class after creating the probability model [3].

A. Feature-based classification 
The 
studies 
which 
incorporated 
feature-based 
classification classified the next destination by using the 
context information of the current state and the current 
location. Do, et al. proposed a destination prediction method 
based on linear regression using location, Apps, call history, 
and Bluetooth [4]. Lu predicted destinations using SVM with 
place, Bluetooth, WLAN, and call history as inputs [5]. 
Monreale, et al. predicted a destination using the method of 
Trajectory Pattern Tree that uses GPS trajectory [6]. Also, 
Akoush, et al. performed a destination prediction by applying 
Bayesian neural networks with cell ID, cell history, and time 
as variables [7]. In addition, Kim, et al. predicted the user's 
destination using a Bayesian network created from history 
information of visited locations in the past [8]. However, the 
studies using feature-based classification method predicted 
the next location with fragmented information only. Moreover, 
because it does not consider the path, it is impossible to know 
the location information of the intermediate paths. 
B. Sequence distance-based classification 
Sequence distance-based classification, with the use of 
time series data, is a classification method which works by 
determining the class which has the highest similarity among 
the stored templates. Lee, et al. classified the user's destination 
by using dynamic time warping, which is a method of 
determining the similarity of the pattern of the two GPS paths 
[9]. However, because the processing speed increases as the 
number of templates in the pattern becomes larger, the 
problem of template management is usually encountered 
when using this method. 
C. Model-based classification 
The studies using a classification model-based approach is 
a way to model the sequence data and find the model most 
similar through matching to the new input. Mathew, et al. 
made a model using HMM to a sequence of visited locations 
to derive the destination [10]. Gambs, et al. determined the 
destination by using the mobility Markov chains from the 
sequence of the POI (Point of Interest) to make the model [11]. 
Burbey, et al. predicted the destination by applying the PPM 
using the residence time and visit time and location [12]. The 
studies using the model-based classification predict the 
destination by using only spatial information, such as GPS. 
However, when using the spatial information only, there is a 
problem that the prediction is biased to the lower information 
that lacks of initial movement. 
III. 
THE PROPOSED METHOD 
When it comes to represent the path using only the spatial 
information, prediction methods cannot resolve the problem 
of partially overlapped paths as shown in Fig. 2. This means 
that there are main trajectories for users to move. When the 
user passes through the main trajectory, using only spatial 
information will result in predicting an incorrect destination 
which overlaps the main trajectory. In order to work out this 
problem, we extend the path information by adding time and 
other context data. Location information, including temporal 
and spatial among others, is collected by sensors in 
smartphone environment. Time and date of the smartphone 
are used as temporal information, and latitude and longitude 
from the GPS sensor are utilized as spatial information. Also, 
other context data from accelerometer, magnetic, and 
orientation sensors determine the mode of transportation of 
the user. 
 
 
Figure 2.  An example of overlapped paths 
In this paper, in order to predict the destination, the path 
information is stored using hidden Markov model (HMM). 
HMM is a statistical model characterized by Markov process 
with unknown parameters, modeling observations to 
determine these hidden parameters. It is a widely used 
technique that stochastically models sequence data of the time 
series. It is mainly composed of the state transition 
probabilities, and the probabilities that select the observation 
value at each state.

About the path P = {𝐿1, 𝐿2, ⋯ , 𝐿𝑛}  of length 𝑛 , the 
information of location 𝐿𝑡  at time 𝑡  is affected by the 
information of 𝐿𝑡−1. Therefore, it can be assumed to be a 
Markov process. In this method, because it uses a variety of 
information of context, we make a model using HMM, which 
probabilistically represents many features. A HMM is defined 
by state transition probability𝐴, probability distribution of 
observed symbols 𝐵, and probability distribution of initial 
state Π. One HMM, λ, is expressed as (1). 

λ = {𝐴, 𝐵, 𝛱}

HMM consists of only one probability distribution which 
is made from various sequence data. Therefore, it eliminates 
the storage of unnecessary sequence data because new input 
sequences can be compared with only one model, as opposed 
to comparing with many sequence data. Thus, HMM is 
suitable in mobile environment which has limitations in 
processing time and storage. 
In this method, when 𝑚𝑖 is the 𝑖th HMM that makes a 
model with the same paths as the departure and destination 
about 𝑃𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 = {𝐿1, 𝐿2, ⋯ , 𝐿𝑡} which is moving path to the 
time 𝑡, we find a HMM model 𝑚̂ which is the most similar 
to 𝑃𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡. Destination of 𝑚̂  is predicted destination. Also 
after finding the 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙 which is the most similar to 𝑃𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡, 
we pick up the future visiting locations based on the 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙. 
The structure of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 3. 
 
 
Figure 3.  The structure of the proposed method 
A. Construction of path sequences 
The path sequence is a set of locations along the temporal 
flow. Each element of the sequence represents the place. The 
𝑖th location of the path sequence 𝑃 is represented by (2). 
   𝐿𝑖 = {𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑖, 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑖, 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑖, 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖}

The 𝐿𝑖  used for the observed symbol of HMM is 
quantized as follows. 
The temporal information of the place, to generate the 
observed values, separated by time and day of the week. 
Because the user works in a different pattern on the basis of 
the time of day and day of the week, we extract the two 
features in the time information. The time, in the 
representation of the time zone, has a total of 6 values through 
the vector quantization, and the day of the week has 7 values. 
Spatial information is formed by the latitude and longitude 
coordinates of a large number. However, as it is not possible 
to use up all coordinates, it is necessary to extract the key 
locations. The key locations may be the departure and 
destination locations or a location to visit during moving such 
as crossroad, bus stop, subway station, etc. In other words, a 
key location means user’s meaningful location or intermediate 
location to it. Previous studies to extract key locations use K-
means clustering which finds the centers of crowded area in 
GPS data [12]. 
  However, this method should determine the number of 
locations for extracting key locations. Also, it cannot 
guarantee the performance of extraction, because the criteria 
of density are uncertain. Therefore, we used G-means 
clustering [13] for extracting key locations which follow a 
Gaussian distribution in GPS data [14]. The G-means 
clustering is a clustering method to test each cluster whether 
Gaussian distribution through statistical verification and 
repeat the K-means clustering until all clusters follow 
Gaussian distribution. Extracted locations were labeled by 
discrete value as the observation symbols for HMM. 
Other context information is used by transportation in 
location. In order to determine the transportation mode, this 
method classifies the transportation based on accelerometer, 
magnetic, orientation sensors in smartphone. For converting 
high-level data to low-level data, this method uses decision 
tree algorithm which is suitable in mobile device because the 
recognition speed is faster than other methods. Transportation 
mode is classified into 4 states, such as Staying, Walking, 
Running and Vehicle [1].

B. Building path model based on HMM 
A path which is a subsequence of trajectory can be 
generated from many different paths. Because it is not 
possible to create a model for all paths, we construct a HMM 
based on the paths of start and end points. The HMM has 
information about the start and end points of a path. In this 
way, the number of HMM is reduced, but is not enough 
because of the large number of locations. When the number of 
locations is 𝑛, 𝑛 × (𝑛 − 1) HMMs are required to create 
models. So, we build the models only with start and end points 
of a path for departure and destination. 
The HMM with path information is learned by Baum-
Welch algorithm [15], which is a learning method typically to

represent the probabilistic information of multiple sequences. 
Fig. 4 shows the generation process of HMM-based path 
model in a real data. In this figure, a HMM is created by a pair 
of departure and destination. This is an example to use the 
different sequences to model as the same path.

C. Predicting destination  
If a user reaches at the present location with path 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 
at time 𝑡, which is the same with the moved path of length 𝑇, 
𝑃𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑡 until time 𝑡 in past, we assume that moving location 
of 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡, in the future, is the same with moving path of 
𝑃𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑡  on 𝑡 + 1  to 𝑇 . Based on this, we define that 
destination of 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 is a destination of HMM model which 
includes the most similar path with 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 until time 𝑡. 
The similarity of path can be represented by the 
probability that 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡  is observed until time 𝑡  in 
𝐻𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐵 whose departure is A and destination is B. When the 
sequence of states until time 𝑡 is Q = {𝑞1, 𝑞2, ⋯ , 𝑞𝑡} on 
𝜆𝐴𝐵  which is the model parameter of 𝐻𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐵 , the 
probability of observing 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 can be expressed by (3). 
 
P(𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡|𝜆𝐴𝐵) = ∑ P(𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑄|𝜆𝐴𝐵)
𝑄
  
 
= ∑ P(𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡|𝑄, 𝜆𝐴𝐵)P(Q|𝜆𝐴𝐵)
𝑄


P(𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡|𝑄, 𝜆𝐴𝐵) is the probability to appear 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 
given sequence of state and model parameter of 𝐻𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐵. 
Also, P(Q|𝜆𝐴𝐵) is the probability to select 𝑄 given model 
parameter of 𝐻𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐵 . Therefore, the probability of 
observing 
𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡
 in 
𝐻𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐵
 is 
the 
sum 
of  
P(𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡|𝑄, 𝜆𝐴𝐵)P(Q|𝜆𝐴𝐵)  for all the state sequences. 
Equation (4) is expressed by using Markov process on (3). 
 
∑ P(𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡|𝑄, 𝜆𝐴𝐵)P(Q|𝜆𝐴𝐵)
𝑄

 
 
=∑ (𝑏𝑞1𝐿1 ⋯ 𝑏𝑞𝑡𝐿𝑡)(𝜋𝑞1𝑎𝑞1𝑞2 ⋯ 𝑎𝑞𝑡−1𝑞𝑡)
𝑄


P(𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡|𝜆𝐴𝐵) is calculated using (2). After calculating 
the probability of observing 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡  all about HMM, 
𝐻𝑀𝑀𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙 which has the highest probability is selected. 
Destination of 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡  is a destination of the selected 
𝐻𝑀𝑀𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙. 
D. Calculating visit probabilities  
Based on the destination which is determined by 
𝐻𝑀𝑀𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙 , the probabilities of visiting desination and 
intermediate locations are calculated. First, we find out a path 
sequence 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙, which is the same with a departure and a 
destination of 𝐻𝑀𝑀𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙  and includes the current path 
𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 . By the assumption of section C, the location 
movements of 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙 from time 𝑡 + 1 decide the future 
location movements of 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡. 
Determining a sequence of future movements of the 
locations allows to find out optimal state sequence 𝑄̂ from 
𝐻𝑀𝑀𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙  about path 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙  and calculate the 
probabilities of visiting locations based on 𝑄̂. The method of 
calculating the optimal state sequence 𝑄̂ is as (5).  
 
𝑄̂ = 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑄=𝑞1𝑞2⋯𝑞𝑇𝑃(𝑄|𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙, 𝜆𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙)

This can be calculated using the Viterbi algorithm [16]. 
When the observation sequence 𝑂 is given in the HMM, 
Viterbi algorithm searches for a state sequence 𝑄 as shown 
the best. That is, it is possible to find the state sequence 𝑄̂ 
that maximizes the probability of discovery of 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙 from 
the  𝐻𝑀𝑀𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙. 
If it finds the state sequence 𝑄̂  based on the Viterbi 
algorithm, when  𝐻𝑀𝑀𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙 is given, the probability that 
path 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙={𝐿1, 𝐿2, ⋯ , 𝐿𝑇} and sequence of states 𝑄̂ are 
found together (joint-probability) is the same as (6). 
 
P(𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙, 𝑄̂|𝜆𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙)

= ∏
𝑃(𝑄̂𝑡|𝑄̂𝑡−1, 𝜆𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙)𝑃(𝐿𝑡
𝑇
𝑡=1
|𝑄̂𝑡, 𝜆𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙) 
Based on (6), when the user has actually moved to the 
location of the 𝑖th path 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙  whose length is 𝑇, the 
probability of the location 𝐿𝑗  of the  𝑗 th (𝑗 > 𝑖)  may be 
calculated by the following equation (7). 
 
P(𝐿𝑗) = ∏
𝑃(𝑄̂𝑘+1|𝑄̂𝑘)𝑃(𝐿𝑘+1

It is possible to calculate the probabilities of the intermediate 
locations and a destination previously visited using (7).

ACCURACY ACCORDING TO ADVANCEMENT  
OF THE PATH 
 
In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed 
detination prediction method, we measured the accuracy 
according to the progress of path. Prediction result of the 
advancement of the path is illustrated in Table IV. Looking at 
the prediction accuracy in accordance with the progress of the 
path, as the path is largely moves, it can be seen that the 
prediction accuracy becomes higher because the information 
of the location movement is increased. 0% progression of the 
path, that is, is capable of predicting only location information 
from the starting location. HMM showed accuracy of 57.96% 
on average only with the information of departure.  
Fig. 5 shows the accuracies for the data of 10, indicating 
the average of the predicted test results with and without the 
use of context information and progress of the path. When 
using all context information, the accuracy is the the highest. 
When using only the spatial information, the accuracy is the 
lowest. The difference in the case of not using the 
transportation information and time information is not large, 
and by using the information of the day, it can be seen that the 
accuracy is significantly increased. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Accuracy according to context contribution  
and advancement of the path 
To demonstrate the usefulness of HMM for the prediction 
of the destination, we compared it with dynamic time warping 
(DTW) method [8] which is a template pattern matching 
method. Fig. 6 shows the average accuracy of prediction based 
on the data of the 10 users. When the path of the progress is 
0% in DTW, because of the shorter length of the input, the 
prediction is impossible. In the case of HMM, 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 
matches up the part of the path of the past. However, in DTW, 
because it matches the full path of the past, it is shown in very 
low prediction probabilities.

Figure 7. Comparison of processing time of HMM and DTW 
Fig. 7 illustrates the prediction time of DTW and HMM. It 
shows the overall average of time that has been used for 
predicting each input path. It is possible to see the HMM 12.67 
times faster than DTW. In the DTW, the amount of calculation 
per one template is bigger than HMM because of matching the 
sequence of the entire path in many cases. Also, it consumes 
a lot of time, since input data are matched to all the patterns 
which are the same as departure and destination. However, in 
the HMM, because it calculates the similarity only until 
current moving time and it makes one model for all the paths 
which have the same departure and destination, its running 
time is shorter. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have proposed a destination and 
intermediate location prediction method using user’s 
smartphone sensor data. A path is the changes in the location 
due to human judgment. Based on this, we represent the path 
model using the HMM where the user moves, and predict a 
destination. The pre-processing for destination prediction 
includes 
extracting 
key 
locations, 
and 
classifying 
transportation mode using smartphone sensor data. After 
making a HMM of paths using pre-processing data, HMM is 
to learn the parameters. When new input comes, this method 
finds out the optimal HMM and decides a destination. Also, it 
calculates the probabilities of visiting destination and 
intermediate locations. When evaluated with the data of 10 
users’ destinations, by using not only the spatial information, 
but a variety of context information improves the accuracy 
significantly. Also, when compared to the other methods, this 
method yielded higher accuracy and showed fast running time.
