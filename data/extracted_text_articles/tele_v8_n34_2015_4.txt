Abstract—Transmitters (=Tx) on-board a satellite generate an 
electromagnetic environment with potential impact on victim 
receivers (=Rx, e.g., instruments) placed nearby. Ensuring 
Radio Frequency Compatibility (RFC) on-board a satellite is 
hence an important point to be considered during satellite 
design and requires an optimized satellite configuration. This 
contribution concentrates on RFC issues in practical satellite 
design by considering the future MetOp-SG meteorological 
satellites: First, an overview is given summarizing the various 
transmitters and instrument receivers on-board the satellites. 
Then, the fundamentals of RFC analysis are presented showing 
the method how to compute the coupling factor between a Tx 
and a victim Rx. To improve the decoupling, MetOp-SG 
satellites are housing dedicated baffles between Tx and Rx 
antennas. Therefore, the contribution finally studies in detail 
the signal attenuation caused by a baffle by comparing two 
methods: field simulation and an extended knife-edge 
diffraction theory. By combining both methods, the overall 
engineering and computation effort to optimize the baffle 
design is minimized.  
Keywords- MetOp-SG; Radio Frequency Compatibility; 
coupling factor; knife-edge diffraction; baffle attenuation. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Earth observation satellites typically house a variety of 
transmitters and very sensitive instruments receivers. 
Hereby, the signal is transmitted / received via dedicated 
antennas. Instruments may, e.g., sense the Earth atmosphere 
while the collected data is transmitted towards Ground by the 
on-board Tx antennas. It has to be ensured that the 
instrument receivers work properly in the electromagnetic 
environment generated by on-board Tx antennas. This means 
that the remaining signal at a victim receiver has to be below 
a specified value. As the dimension of a satellite is in the 
order of only a few meters, the distance between Tx and Rx 
antennas is quite small which makes it challenging to 
achieve Radio Frequency Compatibility (RFC) on-board a 
satellite.  
Therefore, the configuration of a satellite has to be 
optimized w.r.t. RFC, which means that the positions and the 
orientations of Tx and Rx antennas play a significant role. 
Even in an early project phase, this aspect has to be 
considered to minimize the need for configuration changes in 
a later project phase. The approach is hence to define a 
preliminary configuration and to run an RFC analysis which 
investigates the coupling between critical Tx and Rx 
combinations. In an early project phase, the unintended 
signal at a victim receiver shall be well below (typically 20 
dB) the maximum acceptable value, whereas the difference 
is called RFC margin. On the other side, a satellite 
configuration will not only be optimized w.r.t. RFC. Other 
aspects (such as center of mass, minimization of harness 
length etc.) have to be taken into account and will lead to 
some configuration changes. In the end, a compromise will 
be required ensuring positive margins in all considered 
disciplines. 
As the optimization exercise is typically not finished in 
an early project phase, the approach is to run an RFC 
analysis based on a preliminary satellite configuration and to 
aim for high margins. After the global optimization exercise, 
the remaining RFC margins may be lower, typically above 6 
dB and thus still fulfilling the needs. 
 
This contribution is an extended version of [1] and 
considers RFC aspects for the future MetOp-SG satellites:  
 
The European MetOp meteorological satellites currently 
in orbit will be replaced after 2020 by follow-on satellites 
with advanced instrumentation. MetOp-SG will ensure 
observations until approximately 2040 [2]. After successful 
finalization of ESA Phase A/B1 study by Airbus Defence 
and Space, the company has been nominated by 
EUMETSAT / ESA as prime contractor for the provision of 
the space segment of MetOp-SG. For this purpose, two 
satellites (Satellite A and Satellite B) with different scientific 
instruments are currently under development. Each satellite 
houses a variety of transmitters and instrument receivers 
being sensitive in the RF frequency range. Hence, ensuring 
RFC on-board the satellite is a major challenge. 
    Section II of this contribution gives an overview of the 
different transmitters and receivers on-board the MetOp-SG 
satellites. To improve the decoupling between critical Tx / 
Rx combinations, the satellite design encompasses baffles 
that shade the Line of Sight (LoS) between these critical 
combinations.

    Section III deals with the fundamentals of RFC analysis 
by summarizing the computations to derive the coupling 
factor between a Tx and victim Rx antenna. This section also 
discusses possibilities to ensure sufficient decoupling.  
    The remaining sections deal in more detail with the 
influence of a baffle on the received field strength: Hereby, 
Section IV presents two general approaches (E-field 
simulation and a simplified method based on knife-edge 
diffraction) to determine the baffle attenuation. To improve 
the predicted field strength, Section V shows an expansion of 
knife-edge diffraction theory by inclusion of an angle-
dependent antenna gain. Finally, this section compares the 
obtained results for the two approaches. It is shown that the 
simplified theory can be used during optimization of the 
baffle design while field simulations are used for final fine-
tuning purposes. This helps to minimize the overall 
engineering and computation effort. Conclusions are given in 
Section VI.

In addition, both satellites are housing a TT&C system in 
S-Band (transmitter and receiver) and transmitters in X-Band 
and Ka-Band for downlink of the sensed data towards 
Ground.     
When the downlink transmitters are active (transmission 
via Tx antenna), it has to be ensured that the instrument 
receivers are not distorted by the emissions. Although the on-
board Tx antennas are designed to radiate towards the Earth, 
the field strength around a Tx antenna is not negligible 
potentially leading to interference seen by the on-board 
receivers [5]. Limiting this effect is key to proper 
performance of the receivers. Reduction of unintended 
interference power can be achieved by, e.g., sufficiently 
large distances among Tx and Rx antennas, optimization of 
antenna patterns and inclusion of additional baffles to avoid 
Line-of-Sight links between Tx and Rx antennas.  
For readability reasons, the remaining part of the 
contribution will use the wording “Transmitter (Tx)” and 
“Receiver (Rx)” in the sense of the dedicated antennas.

III. 
FUNDAMENTALS OF RFC ANALYSIS 
When multiple transmitters and receivers operating in RF 
range are located on-board a satellite, potential interference 
is an issue, and a Radio Frequency Compatibility analysis 
has to be performed to ensure proper performance. For this 
purpose, coupling factors between involved Tx and Rx 
constellations are determined and the resulting interference 
level at the Rx position is compared to a specified limit. 
  
In the following paragraph, the coupling factor is derived 
for free space propagation as a function of distance and the 
angle dependent antenna gain between Tx and Rx. In 
addition, the analysis takes into consideration  
• 
Improvement of Tx-Rx decoupling for receivers 
integrating over a pulsed signal (MWI / SCA) 
• 
Additional attenuation in case of No-Line of Sight 
between Tx and Rx (e.g., shading by structure or 
intended baffles); hereby, the attenuation value is 
based on 3D full-wave electro-magnetic simulations 
(CST Microwave Studio software).   
 
A. Modeling of Interference Power 
The approach presented below assumes free space 
propagation between a Tx and Rx, where the Tx radiates a 
power PTx at a frequency f and the victim Rx receives the 
signal in-band as an interference signal. Figure 3 shows a 
general constellation involving Tx, Rx, antenna patterns and 
the definition of elevation angles towards the LoS path.  
 
Figure 3.  General definition of angles between transmitter and receiver 
   If the antenna patterns are also dependent on the azimuth 
angle, azimuth has to be considered as well. 
   In general, the power density S (in W/m²) at a victim Rx 
which has been generated by a Tx antenna can be determined 
as

where PTx is the total transmitted Power, GTx (ΘTx-Rx, φTx-Rx) 
is the Tx antenna gain at the considered frequency f in the 
direction of the Rx (direction described by the elevation 
angle ΘTx-Rx and the azimuth angle φTx-Rx), and d is the 
distance between Tx and Rx. 
     The Rx antenna will suffer interference from the incident 
signal. The received interference power PRx at a distance of 
d is

where GRx (ΘRx-Tx,, φRx-Tx) is the antenna gain of the victim 
Rx towards the Tx, f is the Rx frequency, Aeff the effective 
area of the antenna, and c0 the speed of light in vacuum. This 
equation describes free space propagation and is known as 
Friis equation. It assumes that the Rx is positioned in the far 
field of the transmitter: For antennas physically larger than 
λ/2 (where λ is radiated wavelength), the Rx is in the far field 
of the Tx for d > df = 2D2/λ (far field condition). The 
parameter D corresponds to the physical length of an 
antenna, or the diameter of a "dish" antenna. In addition, the 
following conditions have to be fulfilled: df  >> D  and  df  >> 
λ. 
 
The received power may be attenuated due to harness 
losses between the Rx antenna and the receiver input (e.g., 2 
dB losses). This can be respected by a factor Lhar ( ≤ 1) in 
the equation. The interference power at the receiver input is 
then

Hereby, the expression c0² / (4 π d f)² is also called free 
space loss. The coupling factor is hence the free space loss 
multiplied by the loss factor Lhar at Rx side and the antenna 
gain of both Tx and Rx antenna in the LoS direction.

The coupling factor in dB is obtained by applying 
“10*log10” of the linear value. In satellite design with 
distances in the range of meters and frequencies in RF range, 
a typical coupling factor is, e.g., -100 dB.  
 
The sensitivity of the victim receiver describes the 
maximal allowed interference power (e.g., value in mW or 
dBm in logarithmic notation) at Rx side. The interference 
power PRx shall be smaller than the specified sensitivity, 
where the difference is called RFC margin. An RFC margin 
of 20 dB is typically recommended in an early project phase.  
Sometimes, the sensitivity of the receiver is not given in 
terms of power, but in terms of power spectral density 
(=PSD, e.g., in mW/Hz or dBm/Hz in logarithmic notation). 
In this case, power has to be replaced by PSD values in 
above equations. This leads to

where PSDTx is the power spectral density of the Tx signal at

   The resulting coupling factor is hence the same when 
compared to the previous definition, which was based on 
power. The interfering power spectral density PSDRx shall be 
smaller than the specified sensitivity, where the difference is 
called RFC margin. If the LoS is shaded, e.g., by a dedicated 
baffle, an additional loss factor has to be considered in above 
equation. In this case, the coupling factor can be described 
by:

Above considerations are based on in-band interference. 
In general, this case can be avoided by proper selection of Tx 
and Rx frequencies. Nevertheless, interference may occur, 
e.g., since the Tx radiates, in addition to the desired signal. 
• 
Out-of-band noise: This means that the Tx radiates 
noise power outside the desired Tx frequency range. 
The coupling factor is determined in the same way 
as for in-band considerations.  
• 
Out-of-band spurious (harmonics): Hereby, the Tx 
radiates also an integer multiples of the carrier 
frequency fc. The n-th harmonic is associated with a 
frequency of n*fc. The coupling factor between the 
n-th harmonic and the Rx is calculated by the same 
equation as shown above, but f has to be replaced 
by n*fc. 
 
As a rule of thumb, if no sensitivity value is specified, the 
received interference power should be about 20 dB below the 
minimal input level of the receiver which may be, e.g., -120 
dBm. In reality, a victim Rx may receive multiple 
interference signals simultaneously that originate, e.g., from 
different transmitters. In this case, the sum of all 
contributions at the considered frequency must still provide 
sufficient RFC margin (e.g., 20 dB).  
 
B. Methods to Achieve Strong Decoupling 
Equation (7) indicates that strong decoupling between a 
Tx and a Rx can be achieved by a high baffle attenuation, 
sufficiently low antenna gain at both Tx side and Rx side in 
LoS direction, large distance, low Tx power and high Tx 
frequency. In case of harmonics radiation, the radiated power 
of the harmonic signal can, e.g., be minimized by proper RF 
filtering.  
 
C. Temporal Effects 
    On MetOp-SG “Satellite B”, the Scatterometer (SCA) 
radiates pulsed signals. For combinations with SCA Tx and 
MWI Rx, the pulsed nature of SCA signals leads to an 
improvement of the decoupling between Tx and Rx, as 
described hereafter.  
 
   The SCA (only present on Satellite B) radiates a pulsed 
signal. This means that the signal (and hence the power 
spectral density in dBm/Hz) is only present during the pulse 
duration TP. The MWI receiver hence observes a power 
spectral density of S(t)=S0 during TP, else zero. The MWI 
instrument integrates S(t) over the integration time Tint > TP 
which leads to

In logarithmic notation, the received power spectral 
density is hence S0,red[dBm/Hz] = S0[dBm/Hz] + 10*log 
(TP/Tint) whereas the second term provides a negative value 
(hence S0,red is lower than S0). |10*log (TP/Tint)| describes the 
improvement of the decoupling between Tx and Rx due to 
temporal effects, which translates into a respective 
improvement of the RFC margin. 
 
IV. 
APPROACH TO DETERMINE BAFFLE 
INFLUENCE 
This section assumes a metallic baffle (e.g., wall) 
between a Tx and a victim Rx to limit undesired signals at 
the Rx position. The physics of electromagnetic wave 
propagation at radio frequencies is the reason for an 
undesired signal still present at the Rx position, albeit 
strongly attenuated: Signal paths originating from diffraction 
at the baffle can travel towards the Rx as a result of 
Huygen’s principle. In addition, further signal contributions 
may originate from reflections or scattering at objects in the 
vicinity of the Tx and Rx. The principle of this multipath 
propagation is visualized in Figure 5. Hereby, the shown 
diffracted path interacts with the baffle directly above the 
hypothetical LoS path. In general, further diffracted paths are 
possible with interaction points along the top of the baffle.  
 
Figure 5.  Multipath propagation 
Since reflected and scattered paths can carry significant 
power levels, these contributions should be avoided by a 
proper design of the baffle (e.g., by an adequate height and 
an adequate length around the surrounding objects). In this 
case, the dominant contribution at Rx side only results from 
the diffraction at the baffle. Due to the physics of diffraction, 
the interfering signal decreases with steeper diffraction angle 
(e.g., increased baffle height) and frequency.  
The influence of a baffle on the received signal can be 
determined either by: 
• 
A simplified wave propagation model, e.g., theory 
of knife-edge diffraction. 
• 
3D field simulations: A simulation tool solves the 
corresponding electromagnetic field equations and 
determines the received field strength at the Rx. 
This 
method 
implicitly 
takes 
into 
account 
diffraction, reflection and scattering. 
A. Analytical Approach by Knife-edge Diffraction 
      The scenario related to “knife-edge diffraction” is 
visualized in Figure 6. It assumes a “knife-edge” obstacle 
between Tx and Rx and shows the diffracted path between 
Tx and Rx. Hereby, the obstacle subdivides the distance 
between Tx and Rx into d1 and d2. Two cases are possible: 
In case 1, the upper edge of the obstacle appears at a height 
h > 0 w.r.t. the Line of Sight (LoS). This leads to a “No Line 
of Sight” (NLoS) scenario. In case 2, the upper edge of the 
obstacle appears at a height h < 0 w.r.t. LoS. This leads to a 
LoS scenario.

resulting diffraction loss (“baffle attenuation”) as a function 
of v is plotted in Figure 7 for v = [-5 .. 5] as per [7]. 
 
 
Figure 7.  Diffraction loss of a “knife-edge” versus parameter v [7] 
The figure shows the level of the diffracted path in dB 
relative to freespace, which is negative for v > - 0.7. Hereby, 
a level of “- x dB” corresponds to an attenuation of “x dB”. 
According to (12), v and h are proportional, hence,  
h > 0 (NLoS) is associated with v > 0, yielding a baffle 
attenuation of at least 6 dB (see graph). The above graph can 
be approximated, e.g.,  by the following piecewise function

Note that above equation is the good one compared to a  
sign error related to 1.27v²  in [8]. To quickly determine the 
“baffle attenuation”, the approach is to determine v by (12) 
and then to apply (13) for the obtained v.  
 
Example (typical values on a satellite): For d1 = 1.5 m,  
d2 = 1.5 m and f = 8.2 GHz (X-Band as typical downlink 
case), Figure 8 visualizes the “baffle attenuation” as a 
function of the parameter h.

Figure 8.  Diffraction loss of a “knife-edge” versus h assuming d1 = 1.5 m, 
d2 = 1.5 m and f = 8.2 GHz 
The result reveals that the attenuation is very sensitive to 
the height. This behavior is due to the small wavelength 
which is only 3.7 cm in the considered case.  
 
The other way around, the theory of knife-edge 
diffraction reveals that the baffle attenuation in X-Band 
frequency range can be improved significantly by only 
slightly increasing the baffle height. In practice, constraints 
on the height are given by the required field of views of the 
transmitters and instruments. 
 
B. Simulation based approach (CST field simulation) 
      An approach based on solving electromagnetic field 
equations has the following advantages: 
• 
Result available for any baffle geometry (not only 
for simple objects like a “knife-edge”) 
• 
All wave propagation phenomena implicitly taken 
into account (e.g., also reflection and scattering), 
not only diffraction as in the “knife-edge model” 
• 
Environment (surrounding structure) can be taken 
into account   
 
       A well suited approach for satellite engineering is to use 
the simulation software “Microwave Studio” from the 
company CST. For example, this tool has also been used by 
Airbus Defence and Space to assess EMC/RFC for MTG 
satellites.  
 
     To determine the baffle attenuation, a dipole antenna is 
placed at the transmitter position and oriented in a way that 
the radiation towards the receiver position is maximized. 
The electric field strength in dB(mV/m) at a victim receiver 
is first simulated without baffle (reference, including Line of 
Sight path) and then with baffle. In both cases, the 
surrounding satellite structure is taken into account. The 
difference of the electric field strength in dB(mV/m) 
corresponds to the baffle attenuation in dB. 
 
     To obtain the simulation results reported in this paper, 
the integral equal solver based on Multi Level Fast 
Multipole Method (MLFMM) has been used. MLFMM is a 
technique based on the same principles as the traditional 
“Method of Moments” (MoM), but applicable to models of 
significantly larger electrical size. Given the geometrical 
dimensions 
of 
typical 
Earth 
observation 
satellites, 
simulations at frequencies as high as (roughly) 30 GHz can 
be performed applying this numerical technique. Higher 
frequencies (smaller wavelengths) require a mesh size that 
results in increased memory demand and simulation time. 
Should the need arise to overcome that constraint for 
practical limitations (e.g., memory size), the satellite 
structure can be restricted to a representative volume 
encompassing the Tx and Rx positions.

COMPARISON OF FIELD SIMULATIONS W.R.T.  
KNIFE-EDGE THEORY 
     On Satellite A, the radiation of the X-Band transmitter 
towards the MWS instrument is reduced by a baffle (height:

65cm). Figure 9 visualizes a part of the satellite structure 
including the phase center of the transmitter (modeled as a 
dipole) radiating at 8.2 GHz, the baffle as well as the MWS 
victim receiver. Hereby, two Rx positions (“Position 1”, 
“Position 
2”) 
are 
considered, 
where 
“Position 
2” 
corresponds to the center of the MWS reflector plate. The 
figure also shows the position of the Sentinel-5 instrument.

     The figure also indicates the LoS directions between Tx

• 
“without baffle” 
• 
“with baffle”.  
 
Results are presented in Figure 10.

Figure 10.  Simulated field strength at MWS assuming radiating  
dipole; f=8.2 GHz 
Observation: 
Position 1: The case “Without baffle” reveals a field 
strength of 90 ± 1 dBmV/m”. The case “With baffle” 
reveals 72 ± 1 dBmV/m. Hence, the difference is 18 dB. 
Position 2: The case “Without baffle” reveals a field 
strength of ≈ 77 dBmV/m”. The case “With baffle” reveals 
≈ 64 dBmV/m. Hence, the difference is 13 dB. 
      In a second step, the attenuation is estimated by 
applying the theory of knife-edge diffraction. As explained 
in the section on knife-edge theory, the baffle subdivides the 
theoretical LoS path into two distances (d1, d2) and a relative 
height h of the baffle. For “Position 1”, the values are: d1 = 
1.07 m, d2 = 1.08 m, h = 0.16 m. Assessment at f = 8.2 GHz 
yields an expected baffle attenuation of 17.2 dB while 18 dB 
has been simulated by CST software according to the 
previous figure. This shows a good agreement between 
simplified theory and CST simulations. Assessment for 
“Position 2” (d1 = 1.05 m, d2 = 1.43 m, h = 0.218 m) at f = 
8.2 GHz yields an expected baffle attenuation of 18 dB 
while 13 dB has been simulated by CST software. This 
behavior can be explained as follows: In contrast to 
“Position 1”, “Position 2” does not enable a path directly 
diffracted at the baffle towards the receiver position. The 
signal can arrive at “Position 2” only via multiple 
interactions, hence, the knife-edge diffraction theory based 
on a single baffle is not applicable. 
      Next, the radiation pattern of the Tx antenna is replaced 
by the measured characteristics of the physical X-Band 
helix antenna. Figure 11 visualizes the 3D pattern as well as 
the antenna gain as a function of elevation angle Θ.

Hence, the difference caused by the baffle is 10 dB.

      The question arises if this value of 10 dB attenuation can 
be predicted by the knife-edge diffraction theory. To do so, 
the angle-dependent antenna data has been incorporated into 
the knife-edge diffraction theory. The approach is described 
hereafter: First, the elevation angle is determined under 
which a propagation path leaves the transmitter. Figure 13 
shows the principal scenario.

Figure 13.  Principal scenario involving diffracted paths  
 
• 
A dotted line indicates the propagation path in LoS 
direction which is present in absence of the baffle. 
The associated elevation angle is Θ1.  
• 
In presence of a baffle, a path originating from 
diffraction appears at an angle Θ2 < Θ1. Hereby, the 
interaction point with the baffle is inside the plane 
defined by the  Nadir direction and the LoS 
direction. 
 
      For “Position 1”, the elevation angles and the associated 
antenna gain according to Figure 11 are: 
• 
Θ1 = 89.9 deg, associated with a gain of -12.5 dBi. 
• 
Θ2 = 82.4 deg, associated with a gain of -7.3 dBi. 
Hence, the diffracted path runs along a direction with higher 
gain when compared to the LoS direction. Therefore, it is 
expected that the influence of the baffle is lower compared 
to the dipole case. The expected attenuation by insertion of 
the baffle corresponds to the result of the dipole, corrected 
by the delta antenna gain, hence, the expected value is 17.2 
dB – ((-7.3) - (-12.5)) dB = 12 dB.  
      For comparison, 10 dB attenuation has been determined 
using the CST simulation software. Limited differences in 
the result can be explained, e.g., by  
• 
Multipath propagation:  
While above consideration assumes only one 
diffracted path, further diffracted paths are possible 
along the top of the baffle. These additional paths 
occur out of the plane which is defined by Nadir 
direction and LoS direction. Possible additional 
paths are already visualized in the left part of  
Figure 13. In principle, all paths have to be 
weighted by the angle-dependent antenna gain and 
then summed up. As the knife-edge theory does not 
predict multiple paths and the associated elevation 
angles, only weighting of the diffracted path “in-
plane” is possible. A more complex channel model 
which predicts multiple paths and allows for 
insertion of an angle dependent antenna gain is 
Ray-tracing [10]. A disadvantage of this technique 
is however increased computational time. 
• 
Baffle geometry:  
The baffle geometry differs from the ideal “knife-
edge theory” as the baffle is bended and the 
distance between Tx and baffle differs along the 
baffle.  
• 
Approximation of Fresnel integral : 
Equation (13) is only an approximation of  (10). 
 
        To verify the effect of baffles on-board the MetOp-SG 
satellites prior to launch, measurements are envisaged in the 
frame of ground testing. These so-called mock-up tests will 
be performed in Q2/2016 and use transmitters and receivers  
with representative antenna pattern as well as a relevant part 
of the satellite structure.

        A similar approach using an adapted knife-edge model 
is shown in [11], which considers the channel between a 
train and a satellite including a knife-edge obstacle that 
models structural elements on the roof of the train. In [11], 
classical knife-edge theory is expanded by only one antenna 
gain (the “train antenna gain”), whereas the present 
contribution takes into account both the characteristics of 
the transmitter and the receiver.  
 
       Finally, a general remark is given w.r.t. field predictions 
when involving antenna patterns: The radiation pattern of a 
transmit antenna differs between the near-field and the far 
field where far field conditions are achieved at distances of 
d > dmin = 2 D² / λ  (D = antenna dimension). When using a 
far field antenna pattern in above approach, the distance 
between the transmit antenna and the baffle has to be at least 
dmin (fulfilled in above consideration).  A near field 
approach considers possible pattern distortion by the baffle. 
  
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Modern Earth observation satellites such as the MetOp-
SG satellites accommodate manifold Radio Frequency 
transmitters and instrument receivers. The on-board 
transmitters generate an electromagnetic environment with 
potential impact on the performance of instrument receivers. 
Ensuring Radio Frequency Compatibility means that the 
level of the unintended signal at Rx side is kept below a 
certain threshold level so that the instrument performance is 
not degraded. The satellite configuration (for example, 
position and orientation of on-board transmitters and 
receivers) is vital to RFC. As a consequence, it deserves 
careful consideration throughout the satellite program, 
starting with a first optimization in a very early project 
phase.  
The suitability of the configuration w.r.t. RFC is verified 
by an RFC analysis, which is based on the calculation of the 
coupling factor between critical combinations of Tx and Rx. 
An RFC analysis covers both in-band-radiation and out-of-
band radiation (e.g., radiation of wideband noise or 
harmonics). A correction factor leading to improved 
decoupling should be applied when a pulsed signal is 
received by a receiver applying integration times in excess 
to the pulse width of the interfering signal. In case of 
insufficient decoupling between Tx and Rx, the situation 
can be improved by a dedicated baffle between Tx and Rx, 
optimization of antenna orientations, increased distance, 
lower Tx power or stronger filtering effort at Tx side. 
 
Conclusions related to a proper design of a baffle are 
given hereafter: The height of the baffle shall be large 
enough to  
• 
realize NLoS between Tx and Rx (and hence, a 
diffracted path towards the Rx) 
• 
avoid reflections at, e.g., high objects in the 
vicinity of Tx and Rx 
     The length of the baffle shall be large enough to avoid 
reflections at objects next to the baffle which could carry 
significant power towards the Rx.  
     To determine the baffle attenuation for such a properly 
designed baffle, two methods have been studied: 3D field 
simulations and knife-edge diffraction theory (based on a 
single baffle), expanded by information on antenna gain. It 
has been shown that the results agree well in scenarios 
resembling the set-up illustrated in Figure 13, involving a 
single diffraction of the wave propagating from Tx to Rx. 
Hence, the simplified theory is an adequate method for 
assessing the effectiveness of the baffle prior to initiating 
extensive 
3D 
full-wave 
simulations. 
This 
approach 
minimizes the overall engineering and computation effort. 
Verification of the derived results for MetOp-SG will be 
achieved by mock-up testing in Q2/2016.
