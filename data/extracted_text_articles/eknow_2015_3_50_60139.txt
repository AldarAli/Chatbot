Abstract—The eventual goal of our study is to extract useful
knowledge which will help students with improving their learning
performance. Towards this goal, we have studied the methods
for extracting useful information about students’ attitudes to the
lectures they take from the lecture-related data. Such studies will
contribute to capture the real status of university students, and
will be able to make a very useful tool for student development
in the future. In this paper, we challenge the problem of out-
come/grade estimation from the text data that have been written
by the students in a term-end questionnaire. First, we introduce
a new concept for rating a keyword which will contribute to
increasing of the grades of the students who use them. Then, we
use the contribution rates and estimate the grades of students.
We change the weights and compare the estimated grades with
the original ones, so that we can ﬁnd the optimal weights of
the keywords in the proposed framework. Finally, by using the
optimal rates of keywords, we compare the usage of keywords
between high-graded and low-graded students.

Text Analysis; Educational Data Mining; Lecture Data Analysis.

INTRODUCTION
It has been pointed out in Japan that the students’ academic
skills and achievements have been decreasing. So, the univer-
sities have been putting a great amount of efforts in order to
change the university professors to be able to do better lectures
through the faculty development (FD) activities. However,
students’ academic skills do not improve accordingly.
Based on our observation, the biggest problem does not
exist in the professors’ teaching skills, nor in the students’
academic skills and knowledge level. Main cause of this
problem is rather on the students’ attitudes to learning, such
as eagerness to learn, curiosity to those that surround them,
motivation to learning, and other mental tendencies. So, in
order to pursue a solution to the problem of declining academic
performances of students, it is insufﬁcient to do efforts on
FDs only. It is very important to take the matters of students
(Student Development) into consideration.
Based on such recognition, our eventual goal of the study
in this paper is to ﬁnd out the most appropriate teach-
ing/advising/leading methods for the students learn the most
out of the lectures. In order to do this, we pursue the practical
methods of extracting tips for improving lectures from data.
We would help the students in learning more effectively by
utilizing these tips. Our approach to this issue consists of two
steps: (1) to make a student’s learner model which includes
attitudes to learning by proposing new concepts and measuring
indexes for them, and see what we can ﬁnd, and (2) to
advise the student according to his or her learner model. This
approach has an advantage in terms of understandability of
humans. Even though the method we are developing is a naive
one, we prefer to choose the understandable method rather
than applying the established and more sophisticated methods
if they are less understandable for us.
As a part of such an approach, we have been analyzing the
answer texts to a question, which asked the students about their
looking-back evaluation of themselves and the class [10]. Such
data are considered to be appropriate to analyze the students’
attitudes to the lectures. In the studies so far, we have found
that the students with high examination scores use the words
which indicate their wide point of view. On the other hand,
the students with low grades use the words closely related to
the lecture. An aim of this paper is to introduce a numerical
method to text analysis and conﬁrm this ﬁnding.
In this paper, we analyze the data obtained in the lectures.
Such studies of educational data analysis have been conducted
in the research ﬁeld of Educational Data Mining (EDM) [12].
For example, Romero et al. [13] gave a comparative study
of data mining algorithms for classifying students using data
from e-learning system. Its major interest is on predicting the
student’s outcome. Our focus is on the student’s psychological
tendency in learning, such as eagerness, diligence, seriousness,
etc. Many studies in EDM use the target data which are
obtained from learning management systems (LMSx). On the
other hand, we intend to obtain our target data in everyday
lectures.
Goda et al. [2] proposed a method of text analysis, where
texts are given by students as the reports in the everyday
lectures. Our method, on the other hand, mainly uses such
data as the homework, exercise, and term-end examination,
which are obtainable in ordinary lectures.
Ames et al. [1] studied in the similar motivation to ours.
They investigated the students’ attitudes to the class, learning,
etc., based on the answers to questionnaire items. However,
their underlying data were obtained by asking the students to
choose the rate from 1 to 5 for each question item. In our case,
even though 2 of our question items are asking to rate from 0
to 100, other questions are asking to write the students’ own
thought in a free-text format.
Our data analysis style is also different from the major
studies in EDM. Most of them somehow intend to analyze the
big data, and the data obtained automatically as log data. On

the other hand, we would rather take the approach of dealing
with small data, because our target data themselves may be
very small [6][10]. Also, the data we deal with are somewhat
represent human students, and we, as the staff in an educational
organization like university, we have to educate all of them.
Thus, we have to take attention to all the data as well, even
if they are located in the far-away areas from the central area,
because they represent one or more students.
We have been taking such an approach in library data
analysis. In previous studies [4][7][8], we took library’s loan
records as the target data and analyzed them by proposing
new concepts, such as expertise levels of books and library
patrons. From these experiences we are convinced that such
an approach is useful also for other types of small data. So,
we take the same approach in our lecture data analysis.
In order to achieve our aim, the rest of the paper is
organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the data we use
for analysis. In Section III, we present our interesting ﬁndings
in our previous studies, such as [10])[11]. In Section IV, we
conduct the analysis by focusing attention to the words used
by the students in the answer texts of a question about their
ﬁnal evaluation, which asked the students to evaluate their
achievements of the class. We propose a process model for
estimating the grades of students, and perform the process.
Then, we change the parameter in order to ﬁnd the optimal
results. We discuss the usage of keywords in this optimal case.
Finally in Section V, we conclude the discussions and ﬁndings
in this paper.
II.
TARGET DATA
The data used in this paper came from the class of
“Information Retrieval Exercise” in 2009 in a women’s junior
college [5][6][10]. The total number of students who attended
the class was 35. They were year 2 students and going to
graduate. The most important aim of the course was to let the
students become expert information searchers so that they had
enough knowledge about information retrieval, search, ﬁnding,
and also had enough skills in ﬁnding appropriate search engine
site and search keywords based on the understanding of the aim
and the background of the retrieval.
The term-end examination of the course consists of 3
questions. The ﬁrst question is to ask them to ﬁnd the Web
sites of search engine, and to summarize their characteristic
features. The second question is on ﬁnding the Web sites on
e-books and on-line material services. The third question is
to ﬁnd and argue about the information crimes in the Internet
environment. The aim of these questions is to evaluate the
skills on information retrieval, including the skills for planning
and summarizing. These skills are supposed to have learned
and trained in the course, through their exercises in the classes
and in the homework assignments. We use the score of term-
end examination as the measure for the student’s achievement.
We also asked the students to answer the questions as the
overall evaluation of them for the course. They are: (Q1) what
the student has learned in the lectures, (Q2) good points of
the lectures, (Q3) bad points that need to be improved, (Q4)
to score the course as a whole with the numbers from 0 to
100, where the pass level is 60 as in the same way to the
examination score, ..., (Q11) to score the student herself of
her outcome and her attitude toward the course from 0 to 100
as in the same way as in Q4, etc.
III.
FINDINGS IN OUR PREVIOUS ANALYSIS
We will illustrate what we have done and have found in
our previous studies. Our study in Section IV is carried out
based on these achievements.
A. Analysis of Numerical Items
As the ﬁrst example of the results obtained in the previ-
ous analysis, Fig. 1 shows the correlation between the self-
evaluation scores (x-axis) and the examination scores (y-axis).
The former data are obtained as the answer to Q11. Actually,
the data for about 60% of students are shown in the ﬁgure,
because only 21 students gave answers to the scoring questions
Q4 and Q11.
It is interesting to see that the students who have higher
examination scores, i.e., those who locate above the line for
the average score 71, evaluates themselves mostly in the range
between 40 and 80. Thus, the range size of the self-evaluation
is as wide as about 40.
On the other hand, the students who have lower-than-
average scores evaluate themselves relatively high. With one
exception of the student who has the lowest self-evaluation
score, the rest of them mostly evaluate themselves more than
average score.
In other words, we can say that the students who have
high examination scores evaluate themselves from a very low
score up to a very high one, which means that those students
who evaluate low would have the self-image that “I am the
person who can do better than what I have been doing.” These
students have a good desire of self-improvement.
On the other hand, the students who have poor performance
seem to believe in themselves without evidence, and evaluate
themselves something like, “I do fairly well in my study.”
Another possibility is that they actually recognize very well
about their poor efforts and poor performance. Still, or maybe
because of it, they wanted to believe themselves strongly, that
they are not very poor in their efforts, instead of admitting
their poor efforts. In this way, they could avoid facing what
they really were, and keep their pride. As a result of such
a phenomenon, the correlation coefﬁcient between the self-
evaluation score and the examination scores becomes a nega-
tive value of 0.1.
In our previous analysis, we have also investigated the
relations of attendance and homework scores, together with the
scores in the questions of Q4 and Q11. We have found that a
notable number of students are just attending the lectures and

do their homeworks. Probably because they do not intend to
learn seriously, they could not learn in the real sense. Thus,
quite a lot of students’ efforts are rather superﬁcial and they
do not affect to the true improvement of their academic skills
[9].
Furthermore, we have a result, which indicates that students
concern more on their efforts than on their achievements,
which is an important result for the lecturers to know. See
the papers [5][6][9][10] for more ﬁndings in our analysis.
B. Analysis of the Relationship between Students’ Viewpoint
and Outcome from the Answers for Question 1
The ﬁrst question of the term-end questionnaire was “Q1:
What did you learn in this class? Did it help you?” It is the
question to ask the students for summarizing what they have
learned in the lectures of the course, and they express in their
own words. Thus the answers to the question might express
their understanding, recognition, point of view, and so on, in
the course. Because the data are in free text format, it is more
difﬁcult to analyze and extract useful information out of them
than the data in numerical format. However, at the same time,
they are very appropriate to know about the students on their
mental statuses that are normally hidden in their minds. We
want to extract information such as which teaching materials
attract them, in what attitudes they had in the class, how they
felt by attending the class, etc.
As the ﬁrst step to conduct the text data analysis, we need
to transform them into the data that can be used in our analysis
method. As an approach to the free text analysis, we took
attention to the usage of words and phrases in the texts. The
words used by the students might somewhat reﬂect their own
views and attitudes to the course. Also, in order to obtain more
subjective results, it is preferable to extract the words from the
text data and analyze them than to extract the students’ attitude
data in a manual methods by us humans.
We chose the KH Coder [3] as the analysis tool. KH Coder
is a free software equipped with the facilities of morphological
analysis for Japanese language. This facility is very important
in dealing with Japanese texts, because Japanese has no word
divider, like the space in English. Thus word segmentation
is a big issue in natural language processing. KH Coder can
extract words together with doing statistical analysis including
correspondence analysis. In our analysis, we took the answer
text of each student as one document for KH Coder.
C. Extraction of Words which Appear in the Answers
Table I shows the words that appear in the texts more than
5 times and their number of occurrences, in the decreasing
order of the number. We can see that the words related to
the lectures appear in high frequencies. For example, the word
“Search” appears 88 times in the answers to Q1, which is the
most frequently used one among all words. Also the words
“Information”, “Library” and so on appear in the list. The
lecture-related words are 6 (20%) among 30 words, whereas
4 (29%) among 14 words with frequencies more than 10.
D. Correspondence Analysis of Words and Students
It is important to know not only the words themselves but
also their relations with others, such as between word and
word, between word and student. Analysis of such association
may give us more useful information about students and their
attitudes to learning.

Fig. 2 shows the results of the correspondence analysis in
a two-dimensional principle component space. The words in
the ﬁgure are those occurring more than 2 times. The name
in the form st0** represents a student. Then we divide the
students into 5 groups manually, from Grp1 to Grp5. The total
number of students who appear in the ﬁgure is 33 because two
students did not answer to the question Q1. Table II shows
the features of the groups, such as the numbers of students of
the group, the member’s average examination scores, and their
variances. The numbers of the group members range from 3
(Grp4) to 16 (Grp5). For the average scores, Grp3 is the highest
with the score 83.5, which locates in the upper-right part in
Fig. 2. Grp5 takes the lowest average score with 59.3 which
locates in the lower-left part. The P-value is 0.0469, and thus
the assertion that there are differences between the averages
of these examination scores of ﬁve groups is statistically
signiﬁcant at the 5% level [10].
E. Relation between Used Words and Examination Scores
Next, we deal with the correlations between the characteris-
tic words that appear in the answers to Q1 and the examination
scores. Table III shows the high ranked characteristic words
of some of the students in the decreasing order in the Jaccard
similarity measure. Note that the Jaccard similarity of student
p and q is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of words which

are commonly used by p and q against the total number of
words which are used either or both of p and q. The words
marked with “Y”, “É” and “Ì” in Table III indicate that
they are classiﬁed as the general word, frequently used words
that relate to the lecture, and the words closely related to the
subject, respectively. The value in the right-hand side of (st0**)
represents her examination score.
For Grp3 (with the highest examination score) character-
istically use the technical terms and those words from the
broader point of view in comparing Japan and the world such
as “Foreign,” “National,” and “Japan.” It is interesting to see
that the words which are relating to the homework assignments
do not appear in Grp3. Thus, we can see that the students in
Grp3 attended the lectures with the attitude of learning in a
broad perspective.
The students in Grp5 (with the lowest examination score)
use quite a lot of frequently-used general words, and do not use
technical terms at all. It is interesting to see that many students
use the words they have learned in the lectures; e.g., “Learn,”
“Master,” “Study,” “Useful,” and “Use.” So, we can guess they
took too much attentions to the words themselves and did not
pay much attention to their background, their relation to the
related concepts, their values in our society, etc.
IV.
GRADE ESTIMATION OF STUDENTS BY THE USAGE
OF WORDS IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE ANSWER
As we have shown in the previous section, there exists
some amount of relationship between the grades of the term-
end examination and the usage of words in the answers to
Q1 [10]. For example, the students in Grp3, the group with
the highest average score, used the words that indicate their
interest to the world, such as “Foreign,” “Overseas,” “Japan,”
and “National.” They also used more technical terms and
characteristic words than other group members.
On the other hand, the students in Grp5, the one with the
lowest average score, used general words and popular words,
such as “Remember,” “Learn,” “Useful,” and they did not use
technical terms. It is interesting to see that from the words used
by the Grp5 students, they look like good students because
they used the words directly related to the lectures. However,
considering their poor achievements, they might have learned
rather superﬁcially in the lectures. They might thought it was
very important in the lectures to attend the class regularly and
remembered what the teacher talked about. They would not
think it was important to have a wide view on the subjects
they were supposed to learn and thought hard with their own
brains. We investigated further on how much the word types
affect to the students’ achievements in [11].
A. Grade Estimation of Students
Next, we estimate the students’ grades according to the
framework illustrated in Fig. 3. The process consists of two
steps. Step 1 is the process of assigning the weights to the
keywords that appear in the texts. The weight is calculated so
that it reﬂects the closeness of the keyword and the students
who use it, and the weight becomes higher if the students took
higher examination scores. The arrows in the left part of the
ﬁgure illustrate this relationship.
Step 2 is the process of estimating the grades of the
students. We also use the relationship between the words and
the student in this step. If a student used the words which have
higher weights, then the student’s estimated score becomes
higher. The most typical and simple method might be to
distribute the weight of a keyword to the students who have
used it in the equal rate, i.e., to give the keyword weight
equally to its related students by dividing the weight by the
number of students who used it. Then, we calculate each
student’s estimated score by summing up all the score values

For the keywords preferably used by the Grp5 students,
“Remember” has the ranking order 44, followed by “Useful,”
“Use,” and “Learn” with the ranking order 100, 164, and 171,
respectively. Thus, from the numerical data also, it has been
clearly shown that the students in Grp3 used the words which
have high weights, and those in Grp5 used the words which
have small weight to the grades.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have been studying the student’s attitudes toward the
lectures so far. In this paper, we conducted a study of estimat-
ing the grades of students in terms of the weights of words,
which are calculated according to the frequencies of words
used by students. Beginning from a simple method of linear
weighting of words, we extended it to a more sophisticated
method by using a parameter for adjusting the weighting. By
changing the value of the parameter, we could ﬁnd the value
of the parameter which gives the optimal weighting of words
for grade estimation. Then we discussed the words and their
weights in the optimal case.
Our eventual goals in the research topic of this study are
two-folds: The ﬁrst one is to ﬁnd new facts and tips for helping
our students with more effective learning, and the other is
to develop new concepts and measuring methods which can
be used for the ﬁrst goal. Thus, understandability is very
important in our study. This is the reason why we rather choose
naive methods of analysis than to use more sophisticated, but
less human understandable methods.
Even though our current status of study is in a very
beginning stage, the methods developed in the studies so far
have shown high potential of our methods. It will become a
necessary knowledge management tool for student develop-
ment [7] in the near future, because it is a very important
topic for the institutional research (IR) for universities [6].
We have the following study topics for the future: (1) To
develop a method to devise new ideas further, and to perform
reﬁnement of dedication to the study of student effort, and
attitudes to learning, especially further analysis of the text. Use
of other similarity measure like pointwise mutual information
(PMI) is a possible candidate. Also, it is worth comparing our
model with other types of models. (2) By collecting data from
a different class, to analyze them, and to verify if the results of
this study are also holds. Also, it is important to ﬁnd out the
characteristic features of each class by comparing them. It will
be interesting to investigate what features are gender-speciﬁc.
(3) To generalize the analysis methods, and to integrate them
into an automated data analysis system.
