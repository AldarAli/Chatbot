 INTRODUCTION 
Understanding the adoption process of new products is 
crucial for most businesses. It is also important for 
governments when creating policies to regulate the market or 
to define the necessary infrastructure to support new 
technologies being introduced, such as medical equipment or 
electric vehicles. 
Although largely investigated since the last century, 
diffusion processes still remain complex phenomena. 
Various methodologies, approaches and computer models 
have been developed to investigate the market diffusion of 
new products. 
In order to contribute to the scientific advancement in 
this area, this paper proposes a novel simulation-based 
approach for evaluating how consumers’ preferences and 
social forces influence the introduction of new products. The 
proposed approach merges concepts from the traditional 
Bass Diffusion Model with the Discrete Choice Model from 
a System Dynamics perspective. Compared to other 
approaches, our model offers the following advantages: a. 
both timing and market-share can be jointly estimated; b. the 
model is fully flexible with respect to the number of product 
attributes, and; c. the model is easily parameterized through 
Conjoint Analysis without the need of market data. This is 
illustrated by the real-scale application to the German market 
for electric cars. The results demonstrate the potential of the 
proposed approach, to support the understanding of the main 
drivers for product adoption. 
This paper is organized as follows: section II presents a 
literature review and highlights the research gap; section III 
overviews the theoretical background employed in the 
proposed model; section IV introduces the proposed 
approach; section V presents the preliminary application in 
the German market for electric cars; section VI proposes 
future research; and finally, section VII outlines final 
remarks and conclusions.

RELATED WORKS 
A myriad of innovation forecasting studies is provided in 
the literature. The present work concerns Diffusion models, 
Discrete Choice Models and System Dynamics approaches, 
as well as the ones applied in the electric car market. 
 The Bass Diffusion Model [1] is probably the most 
widely used approach in management science [2]. In its 
algebraic form, the Bass Model is somewhat restricted to a 
small set of parameters and strong underlying assumptions. 
Some works partially relaxed some of these assumptions 
(e.g. Dodson and Muller [3]) and others extended the model 
(e.g. Kalish [4], Chatterjee and Eliashberg [5], and Horsky 
[6]). Interestingly, Bass [2] himself commented on some 
possible extensions for his seminal work. Two relatively 
recent state-of-the-art reviews are provided in Frenzel and 
Grupp [7] and in Meade and Islam [8]. 
While the Bass Diffusion Model captures innovation 
timing, the Discrete Choice Model, another popular 
approach, captures consumers’ appraisal of the product’s 
utility [9]. Many interesting works exist in the literature, 
including Anas [10], that relates information theory with 
Discrete Choice Models; Drakopoulos [11] discusses the 
psychological aspects underlying the theory of rational 
consumers; Kim et al. [9] propose an adjusted Discrete 
Choice Model that incorporates the choice behavior of the 
consumer into the dynamics of product diffusion; Lee et al. 
[12] put forward a methodological framework derived from a 
static utility function based on the Discrete Choice Model 
and the Bass Diffusion Model.

System Dynamics is also employed in this area. Milling 
[13] provides an example of the innovation diffusion process 
from a System Dynamics perspective. The basic structure of 
his model is identical to the mixed-influence of the Bass 
model [14], thus the characteristics of the product are not 
considered explicitly. Mooy [15] used a System Dynamics 
model with the sociological theory of Memetics, and more 
recently Park et al. [16] developed a marketing penetration 
forecasting model for hydrogen vehicles, also using a 
generalized Bass model in a System Dynamics framework. 
Maier [14] explains that variables such as pricing, 
quality, technical capabilities, etc. can impact on the 
probability of a purchase, but in his case this probability 
serves as a multiplier that affects the coefficient of 
innovation and imitation, or that can delay or speed up the 
demand. The total product utility is not considered explicitly 
through a Discrete Choice perspective. 
More specifically in the electric car market, many works 
propose forecasting approaches in the literature, including 
Discrete Choice (e.g., Beggs [17]), conjoint experiments 
(e.g., Segal [18], Ewing and Sarigolli [19]), and equation-
based models (Urban et al. [20]). An approach quite related 
to the present work is Klasen and Neumann [21], which 
combines the Bass Diffusion Theory with the Discrete 
Choice Model in an agent-based framework to investigate 
the feasibility of the German’s goal for the electric car’s 
adoption rate in next decade. Another contribution from the 
literature, which is close to the present work, is Meyer and 
Winebrake [22], but it is dedicated to hydrogen vehicles and 
the refueling infrastructure. Similarly to the present work, 
their System Dynamics model encapsulates concepts from 
the Diffusion Theory and the Discrete Choice Model, but 
consumers’ preference utilities are limited to fuel cost, 
vehicle price and station density. Moreover, the proposed 
model does not directly incorporate social forces in a utility 
model. 
Despite their contribution to the concerned literature, and 
to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no work exists which 
deals directly with consumer preferences and diffusion 
processes within a System Dynamics perspective for the 
electric car market. Thus, the model and application domain 
proposed herein are original. 
III. 
THEORETHICAL BACKGROUND 
This section introduces the main concepts employed in 
the proposed model. 
A. Bass Diffusion Model 
Traditionally, economic models of innovations’ diffusion 
are founded on biological and sociological research [23]. 
Perhaps the most well known work in the area is the Bass 
Diffusion Model [1], which distinguishes between two types 
of customers: innovators and imitators. This model is 
described as a set of differential equations employing a small 
number of parameters. Basically, Bass defined the rate of 
adoption S(t) as a function of the potential market share T(t), 
the actual number of adopters A(t), an innovation coefficient 
p and an imitation coefficient q. Bass formulated it is as 
following: 
𝑆 𝑡 = 𝑞𝑇(𝑡) + 𝑝 − 𝑞 𝐴 𝑡 − 𝑝[𝐴 𝑡 ]! 𝑇(𝑡).            (1) 
 
The Bass model assumes that everything in a diffusion 
process 
(e.g., 
customers’ 
individual 
characteristics, 
availability of information about a product, positive and 
negative personal recommendations, etc.) can be modeled 
through the parameters q and p. Despite the fact that the Bass 
model is largely used, its inherent assumptions have been 
criticized in the literature [8]. Additionally, the Bass Model 
is not easily parameterized when no market data is available. 
Thus, radically new products, which imply changes in 
consumers’ behavior, as the electric car, does restrict the use 
of the Bass Diffusion Model. 
Diverse approaches have emerged to improve or extend 
the Bass model, including the Discrete Choice Model and 
System Dynamics [21]. 
B. Discrete Choice Model 
The Discrete Choice Model allows for the determination 
of the relative purchase probability based on products’ 
utilities [24], describing products as a finite set of perfectly 
substitutable attributes. In short, the probability 𝑃!
! that an 
individual i will choose a product k from a set of alternatives 
Ai is given by: 
 
𝑃!
! = 1
1 +
𝑒 !!
!!!!
!
!∈!!,!!!
,  
    (2) 
 
where 𝑉!
!  is the deterministic component of the utility, 
described through expressed attitudes toward that alternative. 
This utility is assumed to be a linear additive function of the 
product attribute score, such as: 
 
𝑉!
! =
𝑎!
!𝑥!"
! +
!∈!!
𝑏!𝑥!"
!
!∈!
, 
 
  (3) 
 
Where 𝑥!"
!  is the score given by individual i to the kth product 
alternative of the jth attribute; 𝑎!
!  is the utility weight 
reflecting the importance of the jth attribute defined uniquely 
for the kth alternative; 𝑏! is the utility weight reflecting the 
importance of the jth generic attribute defined consistently for 
all alternatives; Sk is the set of attributes relevant to 
alternative k only, which is not common to all other 
alternatives and; S is the set of attributes common to the 
description of all available alternatives. 
It is important to note that both (2) and (3) assume that 
the individual preferences structure is fixed and depends only 
on the product attributes, which contradicts one fundamental 
notion of the Bass diffusion Model, i.e., that preference is 
also influenced by social forces (e.g. interaction between 
adopters and non-adopters) through time [21]. Thus, 
innovation timing cannot be forecasted directly through the 
use of Discrete Choice Models. This opens interesting 
opportunities by combining both diffusion and the Discrete 
Choice Model to incorporate social aspects and consumer 
preferences. Moreover, the linear structure of equation (3) 
enables the identification of its coefficients through a least 
square analysis, using a Conjoint Experiment, even in the 
case where products are fictitious. Thus, the combination of 
the Bass with the Discrete Choice Model allows one to 
82

forecast not only purchase probability based on product 
attributes, but also diffusion timing, with a relatively simple 
form of parameterization, namely, conjoint experiment. 
System Dynamics provides an interesting framework for 
doing so. 
C. System Dynamics Applied to Innovation Diffusion 
System Dynamics is an approach for modeling and 
understanding the behavior of complex systems over time 
through the study of the system’s information-feedback 
structure. Thereby, interactions among the system structure, 
amplification in policies and time delays in decision and 
actions can be analyzed [25]. Basically, the mathematical 
description of a system dynamic model is realized with the 
help of differential equations. These equations simulate the 
resulting behavior of the system over time. The basic 
elements of the system dynamics model are feedbacks, 
flows, accumulation of flows (i.e. stocks) and time delays.  
The coarse structure of the Bass model is roughly 
schematized as a System Dynamics model in Fig. 1 (for a 
detailed explanation of System Dynamics and the Bass 
model, please refer to Sterman [26]). 
 
 
Figure 1: Bass model from a system dynamics’ perspective (inspired by 
[14]). 
In this case, the rate S(t) consumes the stock T(t) and 
feeds stock A(t), regulated by parameters p and q. In contrast 
with Bass’ original algebraic formulation, the System 
Dynamics model easily allows diverse policy studies, such as 
a change in parameters p and q, or even structural changes, 
such as adding other feedback loops, for example. 
Consequently, System Dynamics provides an interesting 
framework to combine the fundamental structure of the Bass 
Model (to take into consideration innovation timing and 
social aspects of the diffusion process) with the basic ideas 
of Discrete Choice Models (incorporating customers’ 
preferences explicitly in accordance with several products’ 
attributes). In the next section, a model describing this 
possibility is discussed. 
IV. 
PROPOSED METHODOLOGY AND SIMULATION MODEL 
The general methodology employed in this work is 
summarized in Fig. 2 and explained afterwards. 
 
 
Figure 2: Proposed methodology. 
A. Modelling and Simulation Paradigm 
The proposed System Dynamic model is depicted in Fig. 
3.  
This figure shows that the basic structure of the Bass 
Model (see Section IIIA) is employed, including the typical 
A(t), S(t) and T(t). In addition, the traditional Bass model is 
extended in many ways. First, based on Sterman [26], the 
model captures the replacements/substitutions purchases by 
the variable discarding rate 𝐷𝑅! of the product alternative k. 
This is necessary because for the electric car (and many other 
durables), the adoption timing is slow and can easily 
overcome the product’s life cycle. In this case, based on the 
car’s lifecycle lc, obsolete products have to be replaced, 
moving consumers back to the potential market when the 
product is discarded. The rate at which consumers move 
back was modeled approximately as the adoption rate S(t), 
delayed by the average lifecycle lc of the product. As the 
average lifecycle is relatively long for many durables (like 
cars), the repeated purchase decisions are reasonably similar 
to the initial purchase decisions; thus after discarding 
consumers reenter the potential customers’ pool [26].

Figure 3: Proposed model. 
Another improvement to the traditional model is the 
inclusion of the total market TM(t), which represents the 
untapped market, as suggested by Maier [14]. The stock of 
potential adopters is increased by PA(t) rate, i.e. the flow 
coming from the untapped market, which represents actual 
consumers of other products that may become new 
customers at a rate that also depends on the average product  
lifecycle lc. This corrects the traditional diffusion model for 
the substitution of durables, because not all consumers are 
immediately available as potential adopters, but only those 
that need to replace the product after it reaches the end of its 
lifecycle. Based on this, it is possible to define: 
 
𝐴 𝑡 =
(𝑆 𝑡 − 𝐷𝑅 𝑡 )𝑑𝑡

where P is explained in the next subsection and, 
 
𝐷𝑅 𝑡 = 𝑆(𝑡 − 𝑙𝑐), 
 
            (6) 
  
i.e., the discarding rate is delayed by the lifecycle lc in respect to t, 
and:

The most important contribution of the proposed model 
is indicated at the center of Fig. 3. Replacing the traditional 
coefficients p and q, the buying probability is determined 
through a model inspired by the Discrete Choice approach 
combined with the Diffusion Theory, as explained in the 
next subsection. In this way, the ideas underlying the Bass 
Model are maintained with the advantage of easy 
parameterization through Conjoint Analysis, even in the case 
of radical innovations when no market data is available. 
B. Model Structure for the Buying Process 
The fundamental structural contribution of the proposed 
model lies on the substitution of buying probabilities by the 
innovation and imitation coefficients. It was assumed that 
both innovative and imitative behaviors originate though 
utility assessment, as proposed by Klasen and Neumann 
[21]. A similar approach was also recently employed by 
Goldenberg et al. [27]. In this case, 𝑃!
! is not calculated 
through (2) as the traditional Discrete Choice Model, since 
the utility assessment of products 𝑉!
! is replaced by 𝑉𝑆!
!: 
 
𝑉𝑆!
!(𝑡) = 𝑉!
!(𝑡) + 𝑈!
!(𝑡) , 
              (10) 
 
where 𝑉!
! 𝑡  is defined in (3) and represents the innovation 
utility, similarly to the innovation coefficient p of the Bass 
model; 𝑈!
!(𝑡) is the imitation utility of a product alternative k 
for individual i, representing the coefficient q of Bass. By 
doing so, besides incorporating consumer preferences as 
preconized by the Discrete Choice Model, equation (10) 
combines characteristics of the classical diffusion model, 
including social components. These social components are 
derived from the perception of clients of the market share 
84

and positive recommendations from their entourage, as 
following: 
 
𝑈!
!(𝑡) = 𝑅!
!(𝑡) + 𝑀!
!(𝑡),  
           (11) 
 
where 
𝑅!
! 𝑡
represents 
the 
utility 
of 
positive 
recommendations and 𝑀!
!(𝑡) the utility of the market share: 
 
𝑅!
!(𝑡) = 𝑓(𝑅𝐴!
!(𝑡)), 
                       (12) 
 
𝑀!
!(𝑡) = 𝑔(𝑀𝑆!(𝑡)), 
 
           (13) 
 
where 𝑅𝐴!
!(𝑡)  represents the quantity of recommending 
adopters for the kth alternative obtained by individual i; and 
𝑀𝑆!(𝑡)  is the market share (percentage) of the kth 
alternative. Both functions f and g are parameterized with the 
help of a conjoint experiment, explained in the next 
subsection. 𝑅𝐴!
!(𝑡) and 𝑀𝑆!(𝑡) are calculated as follows: 
 
𝑅𝐴!
!(𝑡) = 𝑟𝑟!
!×𝑐𝑟!
!×𝑆𝐴!(𝑡), 
                  (14) 
 
𝑀𝑆!(𝑡) = 𝐴(𝑡)×𝑠𝑟!, 
 
           (15) 
 
where 𝑟𝑟!
! is the recommendation rate for the kth alternative 
received by individual i; 𝑐𝑟!
! is the contact rate of individual 
i with people who adopted the kth alternative; 𝑆𝐴!(𝑡) is the 
quantity of satisfied adopters choosing the kth alternative; 𝑠𝑟!
! 
is the satisfaction rate of those adopting the kth alternative; 
and the already defined A(t) is the total quantity of adopters. 
C. Model Parametrization 
In order to parameterize the simulation model, the 
proposed methodology employs a conjoint experiment. The 
Conjoint Analysis is probably the marketers’ favorite 
methodology for determining how consumers decide among 
competing products, according to Green et al. [28]. 
Basically, it measures trade-offs of survey responses 
concerning preferences and intentions to buy. A conjoint 
experiment is performed through a field research employing 
interviews and semi-structured questionnaires with potential 
consumers. The results are the consumers’ individual utility 
functions for each product attribute (in equation 3). 
In the present work, these utility functions constitute the 
necessary parameters for the utility loop in Fug. 3. As 
mentioned before, both functions f and g are produced based 
on a Conjoint Analysis. For f, based on quantities of 
recommending adopters A(t), it was possible to define the 
values of the corresponding utility function of positive 
recommendations 𝑅!
!(𝑡). Similarly, based on the possible 
market share 𝑀𝑆!(𝑡), it was possible to determine the 
corresponding utility function of the market share 𝑀!
!(𝑡). 
Finally, the innovation utility 𝑉!
! was determined from the 
sum of the total car utility and the base utility, both resulting 
from the Conjoint Analysis. The total car utility corresponds 
to the consumer’s average utility of an assumed technology. 
The base utility can be interpreted as a utility deficit of some 
product alternatives in relation to others. This deficit can be 
explained by different reasons, e.g. product or technology 
related uncertainty, lack of information and residual 
preferences not measured by other products’ attributes. For 
further detail on Conjoint Analysis, the reader is referred to 
Ewing and Sarigollii [19], Klasen and Neumann [21] and 
Lee et al. [12]. 
V. 
PRELIMINARY APPLICATION 
The proposed simulation model was applied in a 
preliminary industrial-scale case in the German market for 
electric cars. 
A. Simulation Problem 
As a promising technology to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, the electric car appears, together with other 
complimentary technologies such as hybrid cars, to be an 
interesting alternative for consumers. Believing that it is a 
good alternative, the German government has established an 
official market goal of 1.000.000 cars sold by 2020, a market 
share of approximately 2,32%. Recent governmental reports 
suggest, though, that without government intervention, only 
450.000 cars will be sold [9]. Great uncertainty is related to 
this market, since consumers’ reaction to technological 
limitations, 
loading 
infrastructure 
and 
green 
energy 
generation are still not well understood. 
Consequently, understanding the market potential and 
consumers’ preferences is crucial not only for validating the 
market goal but also for deriving public policies to support 
new technological and infrastructural developments. As 
explained in section II, many works propose approaches to 
forecast the electric car market in the literature, but to the 
best of the authors’ knowledge, no work puts forward an 
approach dealing directly with consumer preferences and 
diffusion processes within a system dynamics framework, 
such as the one proposed herein. 
This approach provides an interesting simulation tool to 
forecast the market share when consumers’ preferences favor 
technical attributes, such as in the electric car market. In 
addition, it allows for evaluating how social aspects and the 
product’s utility influence the adoption process. 
Thus, in this context, the preliminary simulation 
experiment aims at “understanding how the main driver of 
infrastructure, the battery loading time, influences the 
diffusion of electric cars in Germany”. This simulation 
objective highlights that the main goal of the simulation 
study lies in the comparative analysis of different charging 
technologies. Consequently, absolute forecasting accuracy 
was not primarily pursued. Also, the scope of the study was 
limited to the comparison between present internal 
combustion cars and electric vehicles. 
Based on the literature and on the interaction with some 
automakers, a list of 18 attributes that differentiate an electric 
car from a conventional one was produced and verified 
through interviews with two experts, one from the 
automobile industry and another from a consulting firm. 
Among the attributes, but not limited to them, price, battery 
range, variable cost per km, battery charging time, battery 
durability, CO2 emissions, maximal velocity, acceleration, 
loading space, noise level and model exclusivity were 
included. The simulated technology was based on the newly 
85

SIMUL 2011 : The Third International Conference on Advances in System Simulation

announced Renault ZE technology, which offers a total range 
of 180 km and three battery loading possibilities: a normal 7 
hours charging at home and/or at the working place, a 30 
minutes fast charging and a five minutes battery exchange. 
As fast charging and battery exchange infrastructures require 
expensive investments, this simulation enables one to 
understand how the market can evolve in the case these 
infrastructures are indeed installed.  
The field research consisted of 291 interviews with 
subjects, conducted between September and October 2009. 
From these, only those with relevant driving behavior, i.e. 
mainly city and short distance travellers, were identified as 
potential consumers. This filtering criterion yielded 183 
potential consumers that effectively took part in the conjoint 
experiment. Thus, based on this proportion, the potential 
market for electric cars accounts for 63% of the total German 
car market. With the results of the conjoint experiment, the 
model was parameterized and simulations were performed, 
together with some sensitivity analysis. 
B. Simulation and Results 
The proposed model was implemented through Vensim® 
PLE 5.10d and then configured using information from the 
Conjoint Analysis, described previously. 
Fig. 4 shows the simulation results of the potential 
market share (in percentage) for the three technologies: a 
normal 7 hours charging, a fast 30 minutes charging and a 
five minutes battery replacement. 
 
 
Figure 4: Simulation results for the potential market share. 
A number of conclusions can be drawn from Fig. 4. First, 
if no fast charging infrastructure is available, consumers are 
not willing to purchase the electric car. The restrictions 
imposed by limited charging possibilities (only at work, at 
special public parking lots and at home), together with the 
long loading time, require a drastic change of consumers’ 
behavior, leading to a less than 0,1% market share. Second, 
fast high-power charging infrastructure that allows the 
batteries to be charged in 30 minutes accounts for a market-
share of 14% in 15 years. According to this scenario, the 
German government goal of 1.000.000 cars (3,6% of the 
market) could be reached in 2020. The impediment lies on 
the infrastructure, which is not available yet. The latter 
requires not only high investment, but also time to be built, 
suggesting that the decision of the first cities where this 
infrastructure will be built is of a great strategic importance. 
Third, if battery exchange stations are available, the market-
share might increase further, yielding 18% of the potential 
market (11% of the total market). Although this 
infrastructure requires a high investment in a stock of 
available batteries, it could account for a second step in the 
development of the market. 
Even though our simulated experiment offers an idea of 
the potential market-share, results must be interpreted with 
care. Modeling assumptions and consumers’ high uncertainty 
about the technology are possible sources of error. Despite 
the fact that absolute values should be read with caution, 
comparative analyses, as the one presented here, are valid. 
Thus, our analysis shows that investment in the right 
infrastructure can determine the success or failure of electric 
cars. In our analysis, we restricted ourselves to two main 
limitations of the electric car, i.e. the battery loading time 
and necessary infrastructure. Nevertheless, many other 
scenarios could be created and additional analysis could be 
done in future works, as discussed in the next section. 
VI. 
FURTHER RESEARCH 
The preliminary application illustrates the utility of the 
proposed model. Several additional studies can be performed 
using the proposed approach and dataset, including some 
supplementary validation. 
An initial structural validation (which is the validity of 
the set of relations used in the model, as compared with the 
real processes) was performed based on the literature. This 
structural validation increases the level of certainty to 
acceptable levels. Some additional research efforts will be 
done in the future to deeply verify some assumptions 
strongly influencing the forecasting behaviour and accuracy. 
This additional validation effort will also be done through 
additional literature review in specific areas related to these 
assumptions.  
Another important future work in the electric car market 
refers to the study of other drivers of the adoption process, 
such as car price when compared to conventional vehicles, 
battery durability, maximum speed, and so forth. 
Other market sectors can be also investigated in the 
future, consequently more statistical certainty will be gained 
as other important application domains will be tested in the 
future. 
 Finally, additional works could be performed to develop 
simpler parameterization approaches in order to increase the 
model’s usability in practice. 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper proposes a novel simulation-based approach 
for investigating the innovation adoption process. By 
combining the Bass Diffusion Theory with the Discrete 
Choice Model and Conjoint Analysis, from a System 
Dynamics perspective, it is possible to evaluate how

diffusion timing, social aspects and consumer preferences in 
terms of the products’ characteristics influence the 
introduction of new products in the market. 
An illustration of the proposed simulation model for the 
electric car market in Germany was provided. As a 
preliminary real-scale application, it was possible to 
demonstrate 
how 
battery 
charging 
technology 
and 
infrastructure drive customer adoption. This simulation 
experiment shows the potential of the proposed approach, 
supporting the understanding of the main drivers of product 
adoption in strategic planning through an intuitive method. 
Several future research works are under way, including 
additional structural and behavioral validation efforts, as well 
as assumptions and parameterization investigations.
