lectures via the Internet, which have been adopted recently 
as alternative or adjunct to traditional lectures worldwide. 
Whereas the adoption and usage of virtual lectures have 
been studied extensively, we do not know how facilitating 
conditions influence students’ intention to use this 
technology. Therefore, this research aimed to fill this 
knowledge gap by studying the dimensions of the 
facilitating conditions that could influence students’ 
intention to use virtual lectures. A quantitative approach 
was followed, by obtaining 204 survey responses at a 
Jordanian 
university, 
and 
statistically 
testing 
the 
dimensions of the ‘facilitating conditions’ construct 
adapted from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of 
Technology (UTAUT) models. Results revealed that 
students’ familiarity, online support, course fee and course 
nature suitability can significantly influence students’ 
intention to use virtual lectures, whereas technical 
resources availability and system compatibility showed 
insignificant 
impact 
on 
usage 
intention. 
Research 
implications and future work were specified afterwards.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In today‘s dynamic tertiary education systems, web-
based applications are playing an increasingly significant 
role in supporting the learning process. For instance, 
utilizing blackboards, e-learning classroom systems, 
online exams, web-based learning systems and virtual 
lectures could change education significantly [1]. 
University virtual lectures, specifically, continue to grow 
increasingly and are expected to become a more general 
learning trend in many developing countries worldwide. 
A lecture is traditionally defined as ―a process in 
which information passes from the notes of the lecturer 
to the notes of the student without passing through the 
minds of either‖ [2, P.640]. In general, lectures have 
been remaining the popular approach of undergraduate 
teaching since universities were founded, for several 
reasons. Firstly, lectures are effective in delivering big 
amounts of information by one person to a flexible 
numbers of students (lecturer-centered approach). 
Secondly, lectures can be easily combined with other 
teaching methods [2][3]. Additionally, lectures are 
considered cost-effective instruction methods, especially 
for big classes. However, the emerging web technologies 
have transformed the university learning styles to 
become more learner-centered, which has popularized 
the live delivery of internet and virtual lectures as 
alternative or adjunct to traditional lectures [4]. Virtual 
lectures (also called synchronous classes or digital live 
lectures) are playing an increasingly significant role in 
delivering today‘s lectures at many universities and 
educational institutes globally. 
It is worth mentioning that virtual lectures are not 
equivalent 
to 
e-learning 
or 
online 
learning. 
Specifically,  e-learning is considered the umbrella of all 
mentioned terms that indicates utilizing electronic means 
to support the learning process, whereas online learning 
comprises the utilization of the internet and web-based 
application for education purposes, where material could 
be stored on storage devices for anytime use. Virtual 
lectures, however, means attending live lectures 
synchronously and by digital means without students‘ 
physical attendance to classes.  
 There are several advantages afforded by the usage 
of virtual lectures in comparison to traditional lectures:  
1)  Students have the opportunity to take the lecture in 
the place of their own choice, resulting in more spatial 
learning flexibility [4][5].  
2)  Virtual lectures are highly useful for students who 
live in rural areas or in a region far from the university 
campus. They are also suitable for students who find 
some kind of trouble with transportation to attend 
university lectures on campus in a daily basis.  
3)  By using virtual lectures, students can learn at their 
most attractive mode of learning, such as having the 
most appropriate setup and convenience [3][4]. 
4)  Virtual lectures provide a better alternative to 
traditional lectures in large classes with 50 or more 
students, in which the former are more practical way 
for every student to take advantage of an instructor's 
teachings, and the instructional material presented [3]. 
5)  Virtual lectures have environmental and social 
advantages, such as decreasing pollution rate and road 
traffic, and saving time in getting on campus of 
universities or colleges. These advantages benefit 
students as well as lecturers and people in the society. 
Despite its popularity and potential, virtual lectures 
are currently having very limited adoption rates in 
Jordanian universities and colleges. In addition, little 
research in the literature is found to address the factors 
that influence students‘ usage of virtual lectures in this 
country. For instance, students‘ willingness to accept and 
take virtual lectures was empirically examined by 
applying the whole UTAUT model [4]; the findings

revealed that facilitating conditions (as one variable) and 
attitudes towards virtual lectures were exclusively found 
to have significant direct influence on students‘ intention 
to take virtual lectures. Whereas ‗attitudes‘ construct is 
an original variable in the UTAUT model, and well 
defined in huge bundle of research, the construct 
‗facilitating conditions‘ has been usually included as an 
optional extension, and has not been clearly measured as 
the ‗attitude‘ construct. Furthermore, there might be 
many facilitating conditions that could influence 
students‘ intention to use virtual lectures, which varies in 
its significance and influence power. Whereas the paper 
[4] fully utilized the UTAUT in an empirical study, the 
current study extends the previous one by focusing on 
‗Facilitating conditions‘ as a focal construct of 6 
variables to empirically test and valid them separately, as 
no previous studies have yet paid any attention to them. 
Therefore, this study aimed to investigate these 
dimensions of the facilitating conditions, and to 
understand which of them could have a significant 
influence on students‘ intention to use virtual lectures. 
Accordingly, this paper reviews the relevant literature in 
Section II, and then demonstrates research model and 
hypotheses in section III. In Section IV, the methodology 
of this research is presented, followed by the findings 
and analysis in Section V. Finally, a discussion and 
conclusion are given in the Section VI.         
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Facilitating conditions are originally defined as the 
objective factors in the environment that observers agree 
that they make an act easy to accomplish [6][7]. Those 
objective factors are theorized to have a direct effect on 
intention to use information technology resources. In the 
context of virtual lectures, facilitating conditions can be 
relating to the people directly involved in the process 
(students 
and 
faculty 
members), 
the 
technical 
infrastructure, and the technical  support for the use of 
the virtual lecturing system [8][9]. Facilitating conditions 
could act as an adoption enabler if available resources 
and facilities are adequate, and accordingly individuals 
may exhibit positive attitudes toward the use of virtual 
lectures [7]. Conversely, facilitating conditions could 
lead to negative attitudes towards virtual lectures should 
those conditions are not found satisfying to users.  
As mentioned earlier, facilitating conditions have 
been extensively used as an extension of the (UTAUT) 
and its next version (UTAUT2), which are widely used 
in the field of information and communication 
technology acceptance modeling [6][7]. In relevance to 
this study, ‗facilitating conditions‘ has been studied in 
the fields of electronic learning [8]-[16], online learning 
[17][18], virtual learning and virtual lectures [19]-[23], 
and mobile learning [24]. It is noteworthy that most of 
the studies found in the literature focused on the 
acceptance 
and 
usage 
of 
e-learning 
tools 
and 
technologies, whereas very scant research particularly 
concentrated on the adoption of virtual lectures. In 
addition, the construct ‗facilitated conditions‘ has been 
measured by different items, and thus we do not 
understand 
precisely 
how 
facilitating 
conditions 
influence e-learning technologies in general, and virtual 
lectures specifically. Moreover, this construct is most 
often studied as one variable while its items differ from 
one study to another, resulting in low clarity of the 
nature of this construct, and a little understanding about 
how it affects intention to use virtual lectures. 
Importantly, no previous studies have been found yet in 
the literature that discuss the factors that compose the 
‗facilitated 
conditions‘ 
variable, 
and 
how 
these 
components influence students‘ intention to use virtual 
lectures specifically, and e-learning technologies in 
general.   
Therefore, this study proposes and tests some 
variables that are associated with the ‗facilitating 
conditions‘ construct, and discover its influence on 
intention to use virtual lectures. This original endeavor 
has not been seen in the literature, to date. Next section 
discusses the factors in details.  
III. RESEARCH MODEL AND HYPOTHESES 
Based on the literature of the ‗facilitating conditions‘ 
construct and its associated items, six variables were 
developed to measure their impact on students‘ intention 
to use virtual lectures. These variables are: students‘ 
familiarity, technical resources availability, system 
compatibility, online technical support, course fee and 
course nature suitability. The proposed research model is 
shown in Fig. 1.

IV. METHODOLOGY 
This study followed a quantitative approach to 
address the research aim. The targeted population was all 
undergraduate students at the Faculty of Economics and 
Administration, at Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan 
(in Amman, Jordan). This faculty is considered the 
largest in the university in terms of students and 
resources, and includes six departments: business 
administration, 
accounting, 
finance, 
marketing, 
management 
information 
systems, 
and 
tourism 
management. 
Details 
about 
the 
data 
gathering, 
instrument development, and instrument validity are 
presented in the subsequent subsections. 
A. Data Gathering 
The research data were gathered through a random 
sampling approach via an online self-administered 
survey. In total, 218 respondents completed the survey in 
two-week duration, but 14 of those responses were 
discarded due to  incompletion, and thus, a net sample of 
204 usable questionnaires remained. This sample size is 
considered statistically sufficient, given the 95% 
confidence interval and the population size of the 
Jordanian undergraduate 
students locally (around 
55,000). This sample size is also consistent with the 
often-cited 10 times rule, which states that the sample 
size should be equal or larger than 10 times the largest 
number of structural paths at a particular construct in the 
model [25][26]. The survey was mainly promoted online 
and hosted by the e-learning system at the faculty. 
Students were invited to take the questionnaire by 
sending them the link of the survey webpage on their e-
learning 
system 
profiles. 
As 
an 
incentive 
for 
participation, respondents were given the chance to enter 
a prize draw of a bookshop voucher valued 30JDs. 
B. Instrument Development     
A survey instrument of 29 items was developed 
based upon the conceptualization and development work 
of previous literature [6][7][17]-[23]. Specifically, the 
questionnaire contained 4 items for variables such as 
‗familiarity‘, ‗system compatibility‘ and ‗course nature‘, 
whereas the constructs ‗course fee‘, ‗online technical 
support‘, ‗technical resources‘, and ‗intention to use‘ had 
3 items each. Items are shown in Appendix A. In 
addition, five items were developed to measure 
demographic variables, such as gender, age, academic 
year (on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th year), major, study program 
(matinee, or evening), having work (part time, full time, 
or casual). A 7-point Likert scale was used to measure 
the constructs presented in the proposed model (scores 
were ranged from 1 = ―strongly agree‖ to 7 = ―strongly 
disagree‖, with ―neutral‖ score = 4). This scale could 
effectively allow respondents to express their opinions in 
this research, as it offers a wider range of agreements to 
statements than the 5- point.  
The survey was available in two languages (Arabic 
and English). When translating the questionnaires, the 
researcher ensured that the meaning of the source 
language statement was preserved in the translation 
(called semantic equivalence) [4]. The questionnaire was 
originally designed in English, and was then translated 
into Arabic. The back translation method was used after 
the Arabic version had been translated back into English 
by another bilingual person. 
The survey instrument was refined during the pre-test 
phase to ensure the internal consistency of the measured 
instrument, with the involvement of 18 respondent 
students. Consequently, the wording of some questions 
was modified. Afterwards, a pilot study was conducted 
by 29 students to assure the reliability and validity of the 
instrument. As a result, two items which were assigned 
to measure the constructs ‗technical resources‘ and 
‗Online technical support‘ were removed from the 
questionnaire due to their very low reliability scores 
(alpha coefficients of .34 and .27 respectively). 
Consequently, the questionnaire included 27 validated 
items in total. 
C. Instrument Validity and Reliability 
It is essential to check that the questionnaire will 
measure what it is supposed to measure, which is its 
validity [25]. Most of the items in the survey instruments 
were adapted from the items developed by [6][7] to 
estimate the facilitating conditions employed in 
UTAUTs, and from other studies in the virtual lectures 
literature [9][11][12][14][23]. Thus, the face validity of 
the survey instrument has been already established for 
most of the items. The internal consistency (reliability) 
of the instrument was also assessed. Reliability is the 
extent to which the items measure the same way each 
time they are used, under the same conditions, with the 
same sample [25][26]. Instrument‘s reliability was 
maximized by using clear conceptualization of the 
factors and ensuring accurate measurements, in addition 
to operationalizing each group of factors with multiple 
indicators [26]. Furthermore, the questionnaire was pre-
tested and modified to ensure that it was easily 
understood. Additionally, the validity and reliability of 
the constructs and their associated items were 
statistically assessed in the data analysis phase. 
D. Data analysis 
Firstly, Descriptive statistics were performed to 
overview the research sample profile, by using IBM 
SPSS statistics18.0 software. Secondly, Structural 
Equation Modeling – Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) 
analysis were conducted, in order to check the effect 
power among various constructs, by using the 
SmartPLS2.0 software. SEM-PLS is a second-generation 
comprehensive statistical data analysis approach, which 
is more powerful than other first-generation multivariate 
techniques in measuring multiple relationships at the 
same time [27]. The findings are shown in the scenario 
below.

V. FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS 
Based on the demographics and other background 
characteristics of the participants in the research, around 
58% of the samples were male students, whereas female 
students accounted for around 41% of the targeted 
population. In addition, around two thirds of the sampled 
students were in their middle academic years (either 
sophomores or juniors). Students with accounting, 
Management Information Systems (MIS) and marketing 
majors accounted for the majority of the study sample. 
Additionally, more than two thirds of the students had 
some sort of work (part time 41.7%, full time 19%, or 
casual 4.4%). Not all of them agreed to share their Grade 
Point Averages (GPAs), however, many of the 
respondents had Good or Very Good GPAs (45.6% and 
23.5% respectively). Further demographic details are 
shown in Table II.

The PLS method is usually analyzed and interpreted 
in two stages: firstly, by assessing the reliability and 
validity of the measurement model (constructs and 
items), and secondly, by assessing the structural model 
through interpreting the path coefficients and identifying 
the adequacy of the research model [27]. The subsequent 
section discusses the results of these two stages. 
E. Measurement (Outer) Model Results  
In order to view the correlations between the latent 
variable and the reflective indicators in their outer 
model, the values of the outer loadings were examined. 
Indicators with an outer loading above 0.7 were retained, 
whereas indicators with outer loadings between 0.4 and 
0.7 were considered for removal from the scale only 
when deleting the indicator leads to an increase in the 
composite reliability (or the average variance extracted) 
above the suggest threshold value [27]. Indicators with 
very low outer loadings (below 0.4) were eliminated 
from the scale.  
As a result, the majority of the items were above the 
acceptable level of (0.4), and thus demonstrating reliable 
items. However, two items, CN4 and SC2, were found 
with low loadings: (0.3815) and (0.3156) respectively. 
Therefore, as recommended by [27][28], these items 
were eliminated from this study and were not involved in 
further analysis. All item loadings are shown in 
Appendix B. In order to examine the discriminant 
validity across the items, the pattern of item loadings 
across constructs in the model was also examined. The 
rule of thumb for demonstrating discriminant validity is 
to keep the difference between an item loading on its 
intended construct and its next highest loading at least 
.10 [27]. In this research, the discriminant validity of all 
items was demonstrated, as all cross loadings among 
different constructs were not less than the determined cut 
off point, as shown in the same appendix (Appendix B). 
Construct validity assesses whether the measures 
chosen are true measures of the constructs describing the 
event, and that these measures are actual tools for 
representing 
or 
measuring 
the 
construct 
being 
investigated [27][29]. For the current study, construct 
validity was established, including both convergent and 
discriminant validity. Convergent validity refers to the 
extent to which a measure correlates, or converges, with 
other measures of the same construct [27]. Convergent 
validity is demonstrated when the Average Variance 
Explained (AVE) value between the constructs is equal 
to, or exceeds, 0.5 [27][28]. As presented in Table III, 
the AVE scores for all constructs in the model were 
greater than .50, which meets the first requirement of 
achieving 
convergent 
validity. 
Consequently, 
all 
constructs demonstrated convergent validity. Another 
approach to assess the convergent validity of the 
constructs is to examine the composite reliability of the 
constructs [26][27]. All constructs exhibited acceptable 
to high scores of composite reliability, exceeding the .70 
threshold recommended by [25]-[29]. All validity scores 
are demonstrated in Table III.

In order to assess the internal consistency, Cronbach‘s 
alpha measures need to be examined. Internal 
consistency is achieved when reliability estimates are 
greater than .70 [25]-[27]. The .07 threshold is regarded 
in the social sciences and Information Systems reported 
data to be the most commonly accepted cut off point 
[25][28]. As presented in Table III, all reliability scores 
exhibited 
acceptable 
to 
high 
reliabilities, 
with 
Cronbach‘s coefficient alpha exceeding the .70 threshold 
recommended by [25]-[28], thereby, satisfying the 
second requirement of convergent validity. Having 
provided evidence of the convergent validity of the 
constructs, the discriminant validity was also assessed.  
Discriminant validity examines the extent to which 
an independent variable is truly distinct from other 
independent variables in predicting the dependent 
variable [27]. One popular approach to assess the 
discriminant validity followed in the current research is 
through examining the cross-loadings comparisons 
between constructs. Specifically, the AVE of each latent 
construct should be higher than the construct‘s highest 
squared correlation with any other latent construct [27]. 
The square roots of the AVE values of all constructs are 
calculated, and compared with correlations between 
constructs, as shown in Appendix C. The results 
indicated that all constructs in the research model 
achieved this criterion as none of the off-diagonal 
elements exceeded the respective diagonal element. 
Thus, discriminant validity was demonstrated.   
B. Structural (inner) model results. 
An assessment of the structural model was 
undertaken to determine the significance of the paths and 
the predictive power of the model through the PLS 
algorithm, then by considering a bootstrapping process 
that involved 5,000 random re-samples from the original 
data set to determine the significant levels of path 
coefficients [27]. Firstly, a systematic assessment of the 
structural 
model 
was 
conducted 
to 
assess 
the 
significance of path coefficients by examining the 
standard error, T-statistics, R squared value and 
confidence interval [28]. The amount of variance 
explained by R² provides an indication of the model fit 
[27] as well as the predictive ability of the endogenous 
variables [28]. It is suggested that the minimum level for 
an individual R² should be greater than a minimum 
acceptable level of .10 [27].  
Table IV highlights the hypotheses of the study, and 
shows the path coefficient between the exogenous and 
endogenous variables, the Average Variance Accounted 
for, R² and bootstrap critical ratios. The bootstrap critical 
ratios (T-Statistics) determined the stability of the 
estimates and were acceptable above the value of 1.96 on 
0.05 significant level [27]. The R² value of ‗intention to 
use‘ construct was found equal to 0.427, which was 
greater than the recommended level of .15; indicating 
that this endogenous variable is explained by 42.7% of 
the given exogenous variables. Therefore, it was 
appropriate to examine the significance of the paths 
associated with these variables. All of the paths and all 
variables had bootstrap critical ratios as shown in Table 
IV.

In sum, four hypotheses that were associated with 
familiarity, system compatibility, online technical 
support, course fee and course nature were supported 
(H1, H4, H5 and H6), whereas only two hypotheses 
expressing the influence of technical resource and 
system compatibility were not supported (H2 and H3). 
The results of each path are interpreted in the next 
section.   
VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
As shown in Fig. 2, the strongest path in the model 
was associated with the influence of the online technical 
support on students‘ intention to use virtual lectures, 
followed by the influence of each course nature, 
students‘ familiarity and course fee. However, two paths 
were found insignificant; the influence of the technical 
resource availability and system compatibility on 
intention to use. Significant paths are presented in 
normal arrows, whereas insignificant paths are presented 
in dotted arrows.

handled, may result in losing important information 
delivered by the lecturer. In addition, the course nature 
can impact students‘ intention to use virtual lectures, 
especially that some practical courses and lab-based 
lectures require students‘ attendance in person to get the 
know-how information directly without intermediaries, 
to try performing tasks by themselves, or to get involved 
in some sort of physical class interactions.  
Course fee, in turn, can affect students‘ intention to 
use a virtual lecture in a reverse way, in that the greater 
the virtual course fee, the less the intention to use it. 
Having a low-price option for getting a university course 
can foster students‘ opportunities in favor of this option, 
given that the majority of the students in Jordanian 
universities are self-funded, and that very few students 
who receive governmental fund to cover their tuition 
fees. 
Students‘ familiarity in virtual lectures can also 
influence their intention to use them. This relationships 
indicates that the more knowledge in the technology and 
how to it works the more the intention to use it. 
However, and due the immaturity of virtual lectures at 
Jordan universities, students‘ familiarity about virtual 
lectures could be described as limited.  
This study has several theoretical and practitioner 
implications. As for theory, the research has explored 
new constructs and provided new significant factors that 
influence students‘ intention to use virtual lectures. As 
discussed earlier in the literature review, no previous 
studies have investigated those factors in the virtual 
lectures arena, which in turn fills an important 
knowledge gap and significantly contribute to the 
relevant literature. Practically, it is implied that 
universities administration should consider the course 
nature, course cost and the existence of the online 
support when providing virtual lectures. Specifically, 
theoretical courses offered in reasonably low prices and 
supported with online helpdesk, along with educating 
students about using virtual lecturing systems should 
contribute to the success of students‘ usage of virtual 
lectures. In addition, administrations, in turn, could 
spread the literacy of using virtual lectures, and may 
provide training courses and special classes for 
demonstrations, in order to support students‘ intention to 
use virtual lectures. Overall, universities‘ administration 
should pay more attention on familiarizing students 
about virtual lectures; their nature, technicalities, 
limitations and challenges. In addition, administration 
should allocate resources for setting up and maintaining 
the technologies required to operate such a system, and 
to enable the IT infrastructure to support it. Moreover, a 
technical support team should be available to provide 
usage help and directions, especially at the beginning of 
each virtual course and for newly registered students. 
Furthermore, virtual courses should be offered in lower 
prices than traditional courses. By following these 
recommendations, administration could expect high 
usage rate of virtual lectures.    
Future research directions might include testing the 
research model, or investigating the newly developed 
dimensions of ‗facilitating conditions‘ in different yet 
relevant contexts, such as e-learning and online lectures. 
It is also suggested to examine the culture factor and to 
discover its impact on students‘ intention to use virtual 
lectures, in Jordan specifically and in the Middle East 
region in general.
