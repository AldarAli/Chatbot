Abstract—The paper proposes a novel approach for address-
ing issues that are related to organizational changes that are
induced by the introduction of an Information System within
an organization. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the effects of a
Workﬂow Technology because its introduction affects typical
work practices, its use is mandatory, and Workﬂow Technology
often makes it necessary to accomplish work activities in a
more rigid way. Similar to other Information Systems, the con-
sequence is that changes brought about because of Workﬂow
Technology can trigger the phenomenon of user resistance. The
Information Systems literature reports different strategies to
limit the degree of user resistance toward Information Systems.
Some of these strategies are based on the direct involvement
of the designers of the technology, while others involve the
managers of the organizations in which the technology is used.
In this paper, we propose the Workﬂow Evaluation Software, a
tool that actively involves the end users to reduce the effects of
user resistance. In fact, this tool allows to simulate the use of
Workﬂow Technology at an early stage of its implementation
by focusing on the coordination aspects of user resistance that
are related to how people coordinate their activities. Based
on the data collected, the tool implements the Activity Circle,
which is a social visualization mechanism that distributes
the information related to the coordination aspects of user
resistance among the users. We claim that the sharing of this
information gives voices to the users and could represent one
of the most promising strategies for reducing frustration and
anger about any organizational change.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Activity Circle [1] is a general social visualization
tool that displays information that is related to attitudes,
opinions and possible trends in the behaviors of different
people. It aims at making this information distributed among
different people, with the idea that knowing this information
about others who have some relationship with an individual
is also relevant for that individual; furthermore, being aware
of this information about others could also inﬂuence the
individual’s related attitudes, opinions and possible behav-
iors. The main idea is to design the Activity Circle to be as
general as possible, considering that any information related
to the possible interactions among different people could
be displayed in terms of a dot that is capable of exhibiting
different characteristics that are related to that information;
for example, the distance from the center of the circle in the
background could be related to the different strengths that
are associated with the considered information. Speciﬁcally,
the Activity Circle was designed while considering the reac-
tions of users to the introduction of a new technology. The
Activity Circle aims to make these reactions shared among
a group of users, and this tool could hence be considered
useful in the area of technology adoption research.
This paper focuses on the application of the Activity
Circle when considering the possible reactions of users to the
organizational changes that are induced by the introduction
of an Information System [2], where an Information System
(IS) is any technology that is aimed at supporting the man-
agement of interactions among people, processes and data
within an organization [3]. Among the possible reactions of
people to the introduction of an Information System, one
of the most critical for its successful introduction is user
resistance. User resistance is a complex phenomenon that is
often associated with organizational change [4]. Information
System research strongly emphasizes how the introduction
of an IS could favor a form of organizational change and,
consequently, how people react to changes that are induced
by an IS [2].
Workﬂow Technology provides the infrastructure to de-
sign, execute, and manage business processes that are spread
over a network of people and resources [5]. Among the many
possible types of Information Systems, we focus on Work-
ﬂow Technology (WT) because we think that the peculiar-
ities of Workﬂow Technology (sometimes called Business
Process Management Systems or Workﬂow Management
Systems) are highly related to the theme of organizational
change. In fact, this technology affects the usual work prac-
tices within an organization because it embeds a business
process and, consequently, manages which activities must be
performed, who is in charge of performing them, when the
activities must be completed, and the order to be followed for
the accomplishment of those activities. Furthermore, the use
of this technology is mandatory for end users; this happens

because WT is used to support the implementation of organi-
zational change that is aimed at making the accomplishment
of work more standardized or its outcomes more determined
and accountable [6]. Moreover, WT enables changes that
make the accomplishment of work activities more rigid
because the changes it promotes might impose ﬁxed patterns
of execution, which often harm the ﬂexibility that is needed
in work environments [7]. Consequently, the employees
often consider the introduction of a Workﬂow Technology
to be a source of frustration because of the perception
of the power exerted by the organization, especially when
employees are not directly involved in deciding the changes
that affect their usual working practices. Accordingly, this
aspect can raise user resistance to change either by users
refusing to use the system or, less acutely, by users initiating
coping strategies to re-appropriate their usual work practices
and overcome the rigidity of the Workﬂow Technology with
forms of production deviance [8], such as workaround [9].
According to the IS literature, in the following Related Work
Section of this paper, we will summarize the main strategies
that have been considered to overcome user resistance;
these strategies mainly focus either on the designers of
the technology or on the management of the organization
in which the technology will be implemented. Usually,
these strategies consider the phenomenon of organizational
change as a generic monolithic process without considering
the speciﬁcity of the change with regard to the business
process that is affected by the change process itself. In
this way, the identiﬁed strategies suggest using generic best
practices, where these practices do not contemplate how the
speciﬁc change of the business process affects consolidated
local work practices and how this change could trigger the
emergence of user resistance in the organization. We want
to propose here an alternative strategy because we believe
that reactions to change are not only attributable to the
change itself but are also attributable to the speciﬁcity of
the change in the considered business process. Hence, local
aspects of the change must be accounted for because of the
nature of the change that occurred in the speciﬁc business
process and because the changes might affect the users’
reactions. Consequently, there is a rise in the phenomenon
of user resistance. This consideration is in line with what
is advocated in a previous study [10], which claims that,
in the research toward the adoption of business process
change technology, it would be necessary to identify both
generic and locally relevant process-centric constructs that
could predict users’ adoption of the related re-designed
business process. In Section III, a tool is described, namely
the Workﬂow Evaluation Software (WES), which is espe-
cially designed to involve directly the possible end users
of a Workﬂow Technology in experiencing the effects of
a Workﬂow technology–induced organizational change. To
this aim, we propose using WES to simulate the management
of a business process at both the design and execution times
to collect and then make available information about the
coordination aspects of user resistance at an early stage of
development of a WT, where these coordination aspects are
about the local aspects of the change on the speciﬁc process
itself and are related to how people coordinate their activities
about that process. This is because user resistance is a
complex phenomenon and it is possible to isolate different
components to partly explain the user resistance. From our
perspective, we are interested in identifying aspects of user
resistance related to the coordination efforts that are required
by people when they are jointly called to accomplish the
goals of a speciﬁc business process. Speciﬁcally with WES,
we focus on business processes as they will be managed
by Workﬂow Technology. Once the related information has
been collected, we propose to display it with the Activity
Circle in terms of a social proxy visualization approach to
make all of the participants aware of the effects of their
coordination efforts to reduce the possible disparities and
frustration and to limit the emergence of user resistance.
Our challenge when proposing the WES tool is to limit the
rise of user resistance during Workﬂow technology–induced
organizational change i) by considering the local aspects
of the change, and not the overall change process; ii) by
isolating the effects of the introduction of a WT on the work
practices without focusing on any speciﬁc implementation
of a WT but instead focusing on the coordination aspects
of user resistance; and iii) by simulating the effects organi-
zational change as soon as possible to restrain the possible
costs for the WT implementation.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II reports
Related Work about the issue of user resistance to the
introduction of an IS; Section III describes our proposal to
manage the issue of user resistance at an the early stage
of the introduction of a Workﬂow Technology; Section IV
describes how to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach;
and Conclusion and Future Work Section is presented at the
end of the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
Because user resistance is a critical factor for the suc-
cessful introduction of IS within organizations, most of the
IS literature provides discussions for a better understanding
of the complex phenomenon of user resistance (see [4] for
a review on user resistance toward the use of Information
Systems). Furthermore, some solutions are proposed in this
literature to reduce the resistance to facilitating IS adoption.
These solutions are usually described while considering ei-
ther the involvement of the management of the organizations
in which the IS should be used or the involvement of the
designers of the new IS to be implemented.
Some authors remind the designers of a new Information
System that its design should never be considered a neutral
activity; the designers should consider that this activity will
also bring an organizational change [4] along with the related

criticalities (such as the emergence of the phenomenon
of user resistance to change). Consequently, most of the
designers’ effort during the design of a new system should
be devoted to limit the possible user resistance. Other
authors (e.g., [11]) state that the designers should implement
a participative strategy with employees. In this strategy,
employees should be involved in the development of the new
system and should not be presented only the overall ﬁnal
result of the project; instead, this work should be conducted
as a series of pilot studies to examine the impact of the
change step by step. Following this strategy, the designers
are also asked to develop and follow a clear implementation
plan with the direct support of the management, who need
to be informed in a detailed way about both the system and
the related business process that is affected by the system. In
this way, designers could also have the possibility of being
informed by managers to better address the questions and
concerns of the ﬁnal users.
For the concerns of the management, the IS literature
mainly considers two categories of strategy to address
user resistance: participative and directive [12]. Participa-
tive strategies are devoted to involving ﬁnal users in the
development process for the new system, as when users
perceive that they are an active part of the change process,
their resistance toward the new system may be reduced.
These strategies consider the phenomenon of user resistance
either before the system is actually used, which suggests the
incorporation of user participation into the design process,
and the encouragement of open communication between
management and employees. Alternatively, these strategies
are generally implemented in a system that is already in
use by considering the training of the users, giving users
sufﬁcient time to learn to use the system (without focusing
on their performances during this transition period), or
providing a clear documentation of the new standards that
are related to the use of the new system [13][14][15].
Directive strategies, instead, are those that are imposed by
the management and can be organized around two opposite
perspectives: rewards and punishment. Most efforts of the
management are devoted to the ﬁrst type of perspective, as
described in previous studies [12][15]. The authors suggest
providing ﬁnancial incentives for using the new system, a
power redistribution among users using the system, and job
title modiﬁcations. In addition, one study [15] also suggests
that the management should give unions higher wage rates in
return for a work rule change and should give one of their
leaders, or someone they respect, a key role in designing
or implementing a change. Punishment strategies are, for
example, ﬁring or transferring people who resist the change,
and implicitly or explicitly threatening the loss of a job or
promotion possibilities [15][12].
The theme of user resistance is relevant also for re-
quirements engineering research (see e.g., [16]). However,
requirements engineering is about the formulation of the
software requirements related to the implementation of a
technology (an Information System in this context). In this
way, requirements engineering process is more focused on
the implementation of the functionalities of the system and
hence on the way people will accomplish their duties after
its introduction; accordingly, higher user participation to the
deﬁnition of the requirements will probably rise higher sense
of belonging to the technology being implemented and this
will reduce resistant behaviors [16]. However, we are more
focused on less tangible aspects than the implementation
of the system’s functionalities; in fact, we are interested in
the way people perceive the organization of their work after
an organizational change. This would occur paradoxically
even in case the procedures and processes related to the
completion of a work are re-designed “on-paper” without
the support of a technology. Obviously, the effects of the
changes on the organization of work, and consequently also
the possible resistant behaviors, would result ampliﬁed if the
change is supported by a proper technology. For this reason,
the identiﬁcation of possible user resistance to IT–induced
organizational change is more challenging.
The solutions reported within the body of the considered
literature are mostly oriented toward providing suggestions,
hints, indications, and rules of thumbs for managers and
designers to limit the potential harm of user resistance by
generally considering the overall process of organizational
change. To our knowledge, the ﬁeld lacks a practical tool
that can be used to limit the negative inﬂuence of user
resistance toward the adoption of a new WT by focusing
instead on the speciﬁcity of the business process affected by
the introduction of the WT. Therefore, taking our inspiration
from the participative strategies that are suggested both
to the designers and the management staff, we consider
involving end users in the process of change to be extremely
relevant. Speciﬁcally, the process of change would bring
the users’ participation to the design of the “re-engineered”
business process [17] because it will then be implemented
in the newly introduced Workﬂow Technology. In line with
this suggestion, the solution that we propose is designed
by accounting for the end-users’ perspectives to make these
potential users both aware and then able to express their
voices about the change “imposed” by introducing the new
WT. This scenario is in line with what was advocated by dif-
ferent scholars, e.g., by [18], who hope for the possibility to
offer end-users alternative responses to reduce the likelihood
of frustration in response to instances of power (such as how
an organizational change that is related to the introduction
of a new WT might be perceived by end users). In the next
section, we describe our proposal for placing into practice a
real shared channel with which alternative users’ responses
are voiced.

III. THE PROPOSAL
We propose a tool, the Workﬂow Evaluation Software
(WES), to limit the effects of user resistance to the intro-
duction of a Workﬂow Technology. The tool encompasses
two main modules: the Workﬂow Evaluation Module (WEM)
and the Activity Circle Module (ACM). The WEM allows
users to manage both the modeling and execution of a
workﬂow, which reﬂects the business process re-designed
as a consequence of the introduction of the considered
WT. The ACM makes possible the social visualization of
information that is related to the possible user resistance
from the Workﬂow Technology introduction, which causes
the organizational change. Detailed description of these two
modules will be provided in two dedicated subsections,
while another subsection will describe the rationale of the
model behind our tool.
A. The Workﬂow Evaluation Module
It is possible to ﬁnd elsewhere a more detailed description
of the WES tool and of its constituent modules [19]. The
most important aspect to recall here is that the WEM
implements what can be considered a simulation tool of a
real Workﬂow Technology. A simulation tool not in the sense
that the WEM fully implements the way how each activity
has to be performed by any of the involved users, but rather
in the sense that the WEM implements a sort of “workﬂow
mockup tool” to assign to the involved users a placeholder
for each of the activities they have to complete according to
the right order of execution deﬁned in the business process
modeled using the module.
The main rationale behind this module is making possible
to apply the WES tool in organizational settings in which
an organizational change induced by the introduction of a
WT is underway. Our idea is to anticipate the extent of the
end-users’ positions before both the implementation and use
of the system to emphasize as soon as possible which are
the possible forms of resistance to change before the costs
of implementation will strongly impact the organization. In
this way, the management can drive the change in a less
traumatic way, thus reducing the possible negative impact of
resistance by accounting for the reactions of the end-users
who are in charge of making the WT introduction either a
good or a bad investment for the organization. Obviously,
this rationale is not free from criticism. In fact, our approach
does not encompass all of the features that affect the
possible success or non-success of the considered Workﬂow
Technology. In fact, by using the WEM functionalities users
focus only on the impact of change with respect to concerns
about the new organization of the work. On the one hand, the
module focuses on user interactions and the coordination of
work activities; on the other hand, it focuses on how much
the workload of each user has changed as a consequence
of the introduction of the Workﬂow Technology. A more
comprehensive evaluation of the effects of change from the

considered WT will also require asking the users to evaluate
how much the implemented system affects the completion of
each activity that was assigned to them by considering, for
example, the Perceived Ease of Use of the system [20], the
technological integration with other applications and other
characteristics that are related to the system as indicated, for
example, in the DeLone and McLean Model of Information
Systems Success [21] or in the BPM success model [22].
Though these last aspects are very relevant to address the
issue of user resistance, they are more focused on the
way the system is implemented and, hence, how it can be
evaluated, only at a very later stage of the introduction of
the new Workﬂow Technology. Conversely, we are more
focused on the preliminary phase of WT introduction and
on the coordination aspects of user resistance. To iden-
tify coordination aspects of user resistance, we deﬁned a
human-oriented meta-model of business processes, which we
called the Human-Oriented Meta-BUsiness Process (HOMe-
BUPro) model (see Figure 1 for the corresponding ER
diagram).
This model is not intended to fully design a business
process, but it aims to be fairly general and complete to
describe the interactions occurring among actors during
a business process execution (and hence also to describe
the coordination of the related activities). To this aim, it
focuses on specifying the relevant constructs to capture the
coordination efforts of the involved actors occuring during
the unfolding of a business process, namely Activities (what
has to be done), Roles (which functional role has the skills
and the duties to accomplish an activity according to the
organization’s rules), and Actors (who is really in charge to
perform an activity within the organization). The rationale of
generality behind the HOMe-BUPro model was also guided
by the idea of making this model easily mappable to any
existing Workﬂow Technology and to any reasonable way
of describing and representing a process model (even on
paper). We conducted this effort while aiming to widen the
possibility of applying the HOMe-BuPro model to different
organizational settings, according to the local choices of
Workﬂow Technology to be used or to any methodology
used to represent internally a business process. Moreover, the
rationale behind the HOMe-BUPro model is also to make it

appliable not only to the models that are employed by usual
Workﬂow Technology (where this technology is usually
built on imperative process models based on a very rigid
control-ﬂow approach) but also to richer workﬂow models.
In fact, our aim is also to apply our model to other more
ﬂexible workﬂow approaches such as declarative, constraint-
based approaches (e.g., the ESProNa engine [23] or the
DECLARE tool [24]), to evaluate whether an improved
ﬂexibility during execution affects user resistance and the
users’ attitude toward the system. In other words, we want
to identify whether the effects of change, and hence the
possible resistance that arises as a consequence of this
change, could be limited by a more ﬂexible technology or
whether the effects of change are basically always the same,
irrespective of the technology used.
In order to make it possible the simulation of the co-
ordination efforts related to the execution of a process, the
WEM incorporates both a Process Designer functionality by
which a Process Designer role can deﬁne all the aspects
related to the modeling of the process, and a Human-driven
Workﬂow Engine in which a Process Manager role can
manually trigger the change of state of the Activities of
the process, and to assign them to the related Actors in
order to fully simulate the unfolding of a process during
its execution.
We do not focus here on the details of the Process
Designer functionality and on the Workﬂow Engine; rather
we are interested to describe both the HOMe-BUPro model
used to deﬁne the coordination of the Activities among the
involved Actors and the way in which the related Actors’
coordination efforts are measured.
B. The HOMe-BUPro model
We consider the application of the HOMe-BUPro model
at two different stages of business process management: the
design time and the enactment/run time as will be described
in the next two subsections.
1) Design time: We based our model on the general
characteristics of a business process to capture the coordi-
nation efforts among involved people, considering a process
to be composed of a set of Activities. For each Activity,
it is possible to specify the Roles that are involved in its
accomplishment. We identiﬁed two types of relations that
link Activities with Roles: a Role that is responsible for
the accomplishment of the related Activity (at least one
Role must be deﬁned as being responsible for an Activity)
and a Role that is involved in the accomplishment of the
Activity (the presence of this relation is optional). The
two different relations emphasize two possible positions in
regards to the Activity to be completed: one is a position
of full responsibility toward the overall accomplishment
of the Activity; the second one, is a position indicating
an optional involvement to support who is responsible to
Figure 2.

complete the Activity (e.g., to emphasize the difference
between a Physician responsible for a Drug Administration
activity and a Nurse supporting the Physician if we consider
a subordinate relation, but also to emphasize the difference
between a General Practictioner responsible for a Patient
and a Specialist, when the General Practitioner asks the
Specialist an opinion in regards to a Diagnosis). Figure 2
reports a sample process, as deﬁned at the design time. This
process was inspired by an insurance Claim Request process
after a car accident considering only a subset of activities of
the overall process. Role R1 is responsible for Activity A1,
while Role R4 is involved in its accomplishment. Roles R2
and R3 are both responsible for the accomplishment of A2.
The model allows us to deﬁne that the same Role, R1, is both
responsible for the accomplishment of an Activity, A1, and
is involved in the accomplishment of another Activity, A3.
Speciﬁcally for the case in example, Activity A1 is about
Claim Registration, under responsibility of an Agent (R1)
of the insurance company, who will follow then the entire
evaluation process. Optionally, a Junior agent (R4) could
be involved to support the Agent responsible for the Claim
Registration activity. A2 is about the First Evaluation of the
Claim (to identify a guesstimate amount of the request).
This Activity is both under responsibility of an Accountant
(R2) and a Supervisor (R3). After this ﬁrst evaluation, the
request passes through more formal steps, like the Document
Collecting activity (A3). This activity is under responsibility
of a Document Collector (R5), who in some cases could
involve also the Agent following the Claim Request.
Then, at the design time, it is necessary to anticipate for
each Role all of the Actors who could possibly assume that

6
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 6 no 1 & 2, year 2013, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

Role and hence which Actors would be possibly involved
in the accomplishment of the related Activities (even if the
Actors who will actually accomplish an Activity during an
instance of the process will be speciﬁed at the enactment
time). To guarantee covering most of the possibilities of real
work environments, the HOMe-BuPro model allows both to
model collaboration among Actors with respect to a single
Activity (e.g., modeling a pool of Actors who are involved
in the accomplishment of the same Activity, as shown for
Activity A2, the First Evaluation of the Claim, in Figure 2,
where both Accountant John, a4, and Jim, a5, have been
involved to possibly collaborate for that Activity’s accom-
plishment) and provide collaboration among the Actors who
are involved in the accomplishment of different Activities
(e.g., for the Agent Susan, a1, and the Document Collector
Joe, a9, who are both involved in the accomplishment of the
Claim Registration activity A1 and the Document Collecting
activity A3).
Activities can be related as in the usual workﬂow models
in terms of mandatory precedence (Claim Registration, A1,
which precedes the First Claim Evaluation, A2, must end
before the First Claim Evaluation can be executed, as shown
by the arrow connecting A1 and A2 in Figure 2), but they
can be related also in terms of interdependence (as shown in
Figure 2 by a line connecting A1 with A3 indicating some
form of interdependence among the Claim Registration
and the Document Collecting activities). Interdependency
describes a weaker relation, which indicates that the
accomplishment of an Activity can be related to the
accomplishment of another Activity without imposing a
strict execution order. This construct also means that the
Actors involved in the accomplishment of interdependent
Activities, not just the Actors following a strict sequential
order to complete two Activities one next to the other, can
be considered as mutually dependent [25]. Accordingly,
two Actors being mutually dependent means that an Actor
relies positively on the work performed by the other to
accomplish her duties, and vice versa. When two Actors are
mutually dependent, this dependency could be described
in terms of what has been deﬁned as Coordination
Requirements [26]. Coordination Requirements in fact
describe an “objective” measure that is deﬁned for the
domain of large software development projects and express
that the coordination efforts required for developers to
complete their project could be deﬁned according to the
level of interdependence among the software modules of that
project. The theme of interdependence is to be considered
not only for software development, but also for business
process management [25]; in this latter case, dependency
rather than considering software module dependencies
can be measured in terms of task interdependencies. An
investigation of task interdependency can be found in a
previous study [27], where a measure for representing the
degree of task interdependency is deﬁned. The authors of
this study relate this measure to other process characteristics,
such as the coordination mechanisms that are required for
people to manage their coordination to get their job done
according to a certain degree of Task Interdependence.
Measuring Interdependence: For measuring interde-
pendence among Actors involved in the accomplishment of
a process and hence to identify the related Coordination
Requirements, we combined the concepts of Coordination
Requirements with Task Interdependence. In fact, with
respect to Task Interdependence, we considered that the
coordination efforts needed to accomplish different activi-
ties are related to Task Interdependence: different degrees
of task interdependency require people to adopt different
coordination modes, from stricter, such as plans and rules
for a high level of Task Interdependence, to weaker, such
as unscheduled informal meetings for low interdependent
tasks. Stricter coordination modes such as plans and rules
require the involved Actors to perform a higher extra work
effort to manage high Task Interdependence, i.e. to perform a
huge amount of what has been called articulation work [25],
while weaker coordination modes used for articulating low
interdependent tasks require lesser articulation work than
plans and rules. In regards to Coordination Requirements,
we considered the idea behind Coordination Requirements
to automatically computing them according to the degree of
software module dependency. Accordingly, we deﬁned the
Coordination Requirements of Actors who are involved in
the accomplishment of related Activities within a business
process. The interest in identifying Coordination Require-
ments is based on the hypothesis that focusing on Coordi-
nation Requirements that arise among Actors to accomplish
a business process (and hence on local aspects of change)
will provide useful information to infer details about user
resistance to change. Speciﬁcally, these aspects of resistance
to change are not related to the measures that are based
on individual differences [28] or to those based on general
organizational measures about change. Instead, these aspects
are related to the more objective measure of the coordination
efforts that are imposed on Actors by the new organization
of the work, i.e., on what we deﬁned as the coordination
aspects of user resistance. In this case, we argue than
higher Coordination Requirements could be associated with
increased work complexity and higher efforts of articulation
work needed, which would result in a stronger form of user
resistance or at least in a reduction of user satisfaction. This
is in line with the study of [29], where it is shown that
some job characteristics such as skill variety and autonomy
are negatively related to satisfaction after the introduction
of an organizational technology affecting the usual work
practices. The choice of deﬁning Coordination Requirements
as objective measures of work complexity as an alternative to
more complete scales to determine job characteristics, such
us the scale described in a previous study [30], is motivated

2013, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
by simplifying the measures that are related to identifying
local aspects of change. The deﬁnition is also motivated by
being more objective because Coordination Requirements
are automatically generated by the business process model
itself, and this generation does not require a longer subjective
evaluation by the people who are involved.
Similarly to the formula proposed by Cataldo and col-
leagues [26], we deﬁned Coordination Requirements as a
measure that is computed using the following formula:
CR = TA ∗ TD ∗ T T
A

where TA represent the Task Assignment matrix, TD repre-
sents the Task Dependency matrix and T T
A is the transpose
of the Task Assignment matrix. In the work of Cataldo and
colleagues [26], TA is built considering the developers who
opened ﬁles related to a software modiﬁcation request; TD
is identiﬁed by considering syntactic dependencies among
the source code ﬁles of a system. In our case, the Task
Assignment matrix identiﬁes the Actors who are in charge
of accomplishing each Activity in the process. The Task
Dependency matrix describes the dependencies among the
Activities of the considered process. We have different Task
Assignment matrixes, which are deﬁned at different stages
of the management of the process: one matrix is deﬁned
at the design time, and one is designed at the enactment
time. At the design time, the Task Assignment matrix is
automatically generated from the process model, while at
the enactment time the Task Assignment matrix considers
only the Actors who were in charge of the accomplishment
of an Activity for the speciﬁc instance of that process.
The Task Dependency matrix is, instead, the same at both
the design and run times, and it is automatically derived
from the process model by extracting both the precedence
and the interdependency relations among the Activities.
Table I shows a Task Assignment matrix that is automatically
generated from the process represented in Figure 2. The table
is built as follows.
For each Actor:
• the Actor is assigned 2 each time that she can play the
Role responsible for an Activity (e.g., in Table I, where
a1 is assigned the value 2 in correspondence with A1
because, as shown in Figure 2, a1 can play the Role
R1, which is responsible for A1);
• the Actor is assigned 1 each time she can play a
Role that is involved in the accomplishment of an
Activity (e.g., in Table I, where a3 is assigned 1 in
correspondence with A3 because, as shown in Figure 2,
a3 can play Role R1, which is involved in A3);
• the Actor is assigned 0, when there is no relation
between the Role and the Activity.
These weights have been arbitrarily deﬁned, and it is pos-
sible to consider smarter strategies for assigning them. In

any case, the assignment follows a rationale that considers
the effort requested in the accomplishment of an Activity
to change according to the Role played by the Actor.
Responsibility requires more effort than pure involvement,
which is reﬂected in the values of the associated weights.
Table II presents a Task Dependency matrix that was
automatically generated from the business process described
in Figure 2. This Table reﬂects the static nature of the design
of a process because the dependencies among the activities
are ﬁxed according to the model that was deﬁned at the
design time. The TD is built as follows.
For each Activity:
• the Activity is assigned 2 when the column refers to
the same Activity in a row. In other words, within the
same Activity, the coordination effort requested for the
Actors involved in the accomplishment of that Activity
is the highest. For example, A1 is assigned the value 2
in the column A1;
• the Activity is assigned 1 when, in a column, the
considered Activity follows the Activity considered in a
row. For example, in Figure 2, it is clear that A2 follows
A1; then, in Table II, the Activity A1 is assigned 1 in
correspondence with A2. The precedence relation is not
symmetrical (if A2 follows A1, it does not hold that A1
follows A2). Consequently, in Table II, A2 is assigned
0 in correspondence with A1;
• the Activity is assigned the value of 0.5 to emphasize
the presence of an interdependency with the Activity
of the corresponding column. In this case, in Table II,
A1 in correspondence with A3 is assigned 0.5 because,
as shown in Figure 2, A1 is interdependent with A3.
Additionally in this case, interdependency is not sym-
metric, as shown in Table II, where for A3 there is a
zero value assigned with regard to A1;
• the Activity is assigned 0, when there is no dependency
among the Activities.
Additionally in this case, the weights have been arbitrarily
deﬁned, and it is possible to consider smarter strategies

to assign them. Nevertheless, a rationale is followed that
considers the effort requested from Actors in the accom-
plishment of an Activity to change according to the degree
of dependency among the Activities. This ranges from the
highest effort among the Actors accomplishing the same Ac-
tivity (the strongest dependency) to the lowest effort among
the Actors who where involved in the accomplishment of
the interdependent Activities (the weakest dependency).
According to Formula 1, it is possible to generate the
Coordination Requirements table. Table III describes the Co-
ordination Requirements that are associated with each pair
of Actors according to the Claim Request process described
in Figure 2. For each Actor (a single row, e.g., in Table III
the ﬁrst row refers to the Coordination Requirements of a1),
the Table reports the Coordination Requirements that are
calculated with respect to all of the other possible Actors
identiﬁed in the design phase. The last two columns, S1 and
S2 aggregate the data about the Coordination Requirements
that are related to a speciﬁc Actor. S1 is about the sum of all
of the Coordination Requirements of an Actor with respect
to all of the other Actors involved in the process, and S2
is about the sum of the Coordination Requirements for a
Role, considering all of the possible Actors who play that
Role. While the columns of the table with the names of other
Actors identify the Coordination Requirements concerning
Actor-Actor interactions, the last two colums (S1 and S2)
are about a more general and comprehensive quantiﬁcation
of Coordination Requirements posed to each of the Actor
involved in the process. This evaluation would be useful
for example in comparing the coordination workloads re-
quested to an Actor in regards to different processes: e.g.,
comparing the Coordination Requirements for the actual
process (i.e., before the organizational change) with the
requirements posed by the re-designed process as supported
by the Workﬂow Technology (i.e., after the organizational
change as simulated by means of the WES tool); in other
cases, this evaluation would be useful also in giving the
possibility to any involved Actor to compare her workload
with the workloads of the others.
Consider for instance the case of John (a4) and Jim (a5),
both Accountants responsible for the accomplishment of the
First Evaluation of the Claim (A2). Because of their com-
petition for a promotion, they do not want to collaborate at
all. Instead, as reported by Table III, a4 and a5 are enforced
to possibly collaborate with one of the highest values of

the identiﬁed Coordination Requirements (measured with
the strength of eight, where eleven is the highest value)
according to the new organization of work imposed by the
new Claim Request process that is simulated by using the
WES tool. So, in this case, more than other Actors, such as
Steve (a8), the Junior agent, with his highest Coordination
Requirement set to 4.5, John and Jim might probably exhibit
a resistant behavior toward the new organization of work
as imposed by the Workﬂow Technology. In regards to S1,
the value of S1 for both John and Jim is set, after the
change of the considered process, to one of the highest
values (42, where 59 is the highest value). Our hypothesis
is that an increase of the Coordination Requirements for an
Actor would correspond to a possible increase of a resistant
behavior toward the organizational change induced by the
introduction of a Workﬂow Technology.
The data about the columns in the CR table emphasize
how much an Actor is involved in the coordination of
Activities for a given process by considering that the
measure of this involvement is based on what could occur
according to the design of the process but it is not based
on considering the speciﬁc instances of that process. The
next step is to consider how these data could change for a
speciﬁc instance of that process.
2) Enactment and Run time: At this time, among the
possible Actors speciﬁed at the design time, the Actors
actually involved in the execution of the Activities related to
the current instance of the process will be chosen. Figure 3
depicts a possible instance of the Claim Request process
that is considered in Figure 2. In this speciﬁc instance,
Susan (a1) is the only Agent who is responsible for the
accomplishment of the Claim Registration activity A1; John
(a4), an Accountant, and Paul (a7), a Supervisor, are both
responsible for the accomplishment of the First Evaluation
of the Claim (A2); Joe (a9), a Document Collector, is
responsible for the accomplishment of the Document Col-

lecting activity (A3), while David (a3), an Agent, is involved
in the accomplishment of that Activity (see Figure 3, in
which each assigned Actor is represented with a double-
lined circle). Consequently, a new Task Activity matrix is
automatically determined by accounting for only the Actors
who are actually involved in the execution of that speciﬁc
process instance. For the situation after the enactment has
occurred, as depicted in Figure 3, Table IV is generated. To
emphasize the differences with Table I, describing a static
situation according to the design phase, in Table IV, the
Actors underlined in the second column (named Actor) are
the only Actors enacted for the considered instance of the
process. Instead, the weights underlined are the weights that
are changed in the TA table, which reﬂect the change from
the design time to the run time after enactment. Speciﬁcally,
the values in Table IV are all at least equal to or at most
less than the values in Table I because the table at the
design time describes a wider set of possibilities to assign an
Actor for the accomplishment of an Activity. Consequently,
applying Formula 1 to the Task Activity matrix generated
at the run time (Table IV) and to the Task Dependency
matrix (Table II), it is possible to compute the Coordination
Requirements table that is speciﬁc to that instance of the
process (see Table V). Again, the Actors underlined in the
ﬁrst column are the only Actors enacted for the considered
instance of the process. Instead, the weights underlined
report the speciﬁc Coordination Requirements, which were
changed according to the data reported by Tables IV and II.
In this way, S1 and S2 in Table V describe, for each
Actor enacted for that instance, the sum of the Coordination
Requirements with respect to all of the other Actors and with
respect to the Role played by that Actor. Again the values
contained in Table V are all at least equal to or at most less
than the values contained in Table III thus reﬂecting the
different Coordination Requirements that occur at either the
design or run times. In this speciﬁc instance of the Claim
Request process, John (a4) and Jim (a5) are not enacted
together, but only John is assigned for the completion of
the First Evaluation of the Claim (A2). Consequently, the
Table V reﬂects this fact because both cells at the cross
of a4 and a5 related rows/columns (and viceversa) equal
zero (i.e., no Coordination Requirements among John and
Jim are set for this instance). Obviously, this is the case
for a single speciﬁc instance of the Claim Request process,
so it is not possible to base the identiﬁcation of possible
resistant behaviors on a single case. For this reasons, our
tool will refer either to data related to the design time
(summarizing the set of all the possible cases) or to data
related to the run time considering the single CR tables
related to the instances of the considered process. The idea
of considering two different sources of data to identify
Coordination Requirements could be also used to implement
forms of Socio-Technical Congruence [31] that is a way to
measure the proportion of the Coordination Requirements

C. The Activity Circle Module
Once the information about a process and the related
instances is collected, the Activity Circle (AC) is then used
to make this information distributed (and hence shared)
among the various participants who are involved in the
business process. The Activity Circle relies on a social
proxy approach [32] to social visualization [33], which is
a way of visualizing any type of information that is related
to the interactions that occur among people, by choosing
to represent any of this information in terms of a social
proxy (a graphical representation of that information). The
visualization of the various social proxies involved then

describes the trends in people’s attitudes, opinions and
behaviors. Because our focus is on WT acceptance, we
mainly consider the information that can be shared among
users of a Workﬂow Technology. In a previous study [1], we
considered to distribute the information about how much a
speciﬁc user intended to break the way of accomplishing her
work with respect to the nature of the Workﬂow Technology
that was imposed on her. Another study [19] focused on
distributing information about perceived viscosity, i.e., about
the perception that a user had of her increased or decreased
effort requested to complete an activity after the introduction
of a Workﬂow Technology. To this aim, Figure 4 describes
an example of Activity Circle generated for a sample process
of a Claim Request process. The process encompasses ten
different Activities (the related dots in the Activity Circle
shown in the ﬁgure). Each Activity is under responsibility of
a Role (each Role is associated with a different color in the
AC, for sake of readability in Figure 4 each Role responsible
for an Activity is described using a different shape) and each
Role could be played by a different Actor. For instance, the
three pentagons are associated to three different Activities
under responsibility of the Agents of the insurance com-
pany. The two triangles are related to two Activities under
responsibility of the Supervisor role. As the triangle dots are
closer to the center of the Activity Circle, the related Actors
playing the Supervisor role perceived a stronger value of
the viscosity as a consequence of the introduction of the
Workﬂow Technology, while Agents, whose related dots are
farther from the center of the AC, perceived a smaller effort
requested to complete their activities. In fact, the closer a dot
is to the center of the AC, the higher the perceived viscosity
is, and vice versa, the farther a dot is from the center of
the AC, the lowest the perceived viscosity is. Because this
visualization is available to any of the involved users, the
distribution of viscosity information makes each user aware
of the others’ perceptions, and this would mutually inﬂuence
the attitudes toward the adoption of the new Workﬂow
Technology. In particular, what are the possible reactions of
the “Supervisors” (considered as a group, the group whose
members are the Actors assuming the Role of Supervisor) in
regards to the “Agents”, because of their perception of the
different efforts requested after the introduction of the tech-
nology? If we reason in terms of power, and power during IS
implementation matters [34], Supervisors, perceiving higher
viscosity than Agents, feel to be considered powerless than
Agents in the new organization of work. This would have to
be balanced with some strategy to limit the possible negative
attitude toward WT by Supervisors.
In the current proposal, we focus instead on the visu-
alization of the more objective measure of Coordination
Requirements among the different users to provide a type
of information that is possibly related to user resistance
toward the new WT. The nature of Activity Circle is to make
information about Coordination Requirements distributed
and, hence, shared among the different users. Consequently,
this goal makes each user aware of the possible differences
in the related work complexities and the redistribution of
work after the redesign of the process; hence, the AC can
make evident possible cases of relative deprivation in the or-
ganizational setting [35]. Here, the relative deprivation refers
to the discontent that each employee might feel when she
compares her position to the positions of her colleagues and
realizes that she has a higher burden of work; she believes
that she does not deserve to have this higher burden of
work compared with those around her. Relative deprivation
could be then related to the perception of organizational
injustice [36], and the level of this injustice would either
favor or not favor the emergence of user resistance.
We provide here two different but related views: the
Actor view and the Role view. The Actor view is about
the visualization of Coordination Requirements among the
different Actors who are involved in the same business
process. The Role view is similar to the former view, but it
focuses instead on providing the Coordination Requirements
that are related to each of the involved Roles that the Actors
have assumed. Considering here the case of data collected
during the run time, the Actor view is related to the S1
columns of the CR Tables that are associated with all of the
instances of the same process. Speciﬁcally, each of the dots
in the Activity Circle, where each dot is a proxy of one of
the Actors involved in at least one of the instances of a given
business process, is characterized by three different graphical
aspects, each of which relates to some of the Actor’s traits:
the position, the size, and the transparency. The position of
a dot is computed using the following formula:
position(ai) =
N
∑
j=1
S1(ai)j/N
(2)
where the Coordination Requirements of ai with respect to
all of the other involved Actors (S1(ai)) are added for any

Figure 4.

of the j–speciﬁc instance of the process, and N represents
the overall number of instances. The position of a dot is
thus a clear indication of the Coordination Requirements of
the related Actor: the farther a dot is from the center of
the AC, the more Coordination Requirements the Actor has
compared with the other Actors, and vice versa, the closer
a dot is to the center of the AC, the fewer Coordination
Requirements the Actor has with other Actors.
Size involves the dimension of the dot and is calculated
according to the following formula:
size(ai) =
N
∑
j=1
enacted(ai)j/N
(3)
where enacted(ai)j equals 1 if the Actor ai was enacted in
the accomplishment of instance j, and it equals 0 if not; N
represents the overall number of instances of a process. This
graphical aspect of the dot means that the size of the dot
is deﬁned proportionally to how much the value of size(ai)
is closer to 1. The larger the size of the dot is, the more
the related Actor was enacted in most of the considered
instances of the process. In other words, the size of the dot
could be related to the experience of the corresponding Actor
or, more speciﬁcally, to the accountability of that Actor
within the considered organization.
The transparency of the dot is computed using the fol-
lowing formula:
transparency(ai) =
N
∑
j=1
(S1(ai)j − position(ai))2/N
(4)
where the closer to zero the transparency(ai) is, the less
the related dot is transparent. This arrangement means that
the transparency reﬂects the variance of the Coordination
Requirements of an Actor with respect to others. A dot that
is not transparent means that the related Actor had the same
Coordination Requirements with respect to other Actors for
all of the different instances of the considered process.
Similarly, a Role view could be implemented by aggre-

12
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 6 no 1 & 2, year 2013, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

gating, for each Role, all of the data about the Coordination
Requirements for all of the Actors who played that Role.
Consequently, the dots of this visualization would represent
Roles (and not single Actors) to display how the Coordina-
tion Requirements are distributed among the different Roles
that are involved in the execution of the considered business
process.
It is possible to identify two scalability issues related to
the AC visualization: ﬁrst, the number of dots (associated
to the number of Actors involved in a modeled process)
which can be visualized within a single Activity Circle;
this could raise an issue, if the number of dots is too high;
second, the number of instances considered to generate each
of the dot’s characteristics; in fact, when too much instances
are considered to generate the dots to be displayed on the
Activity Circle, this might rise some problems especially in
regards to the size of a single dot (too large) or to its position
(too far from the center of the AC). We are conﬁdent that
the solution of this second issue is also helpful to solve
the ﬁrst one. In fact, in order to deal with the possible
issue due to a larger number of instances considered, we
designed the system considering that each of the dot’s
characteristics will be normalized to a logaritmhic scale.
This is useful both for large corpus of data, in order to
limit the effects of the differences (giving the possibility of
minimizing the differences among both dots’ sizes and dots’
positions) and also for small corpus of data (to emphasize the
possible differences among the dots to be visualized when
considering few data). The fact to reduce the effects of the
dots differences considering large source of data makes also
feasible to manage the visualization of a larger number of
dots, contributing to the solution of the ﬁrst scalability issue.
With both Actor and Role views, any Actor can visualize
the Coordination Requirements about either the different
Actors who are involved or the different Roles that are
involved in the accomplishment of a process. Accordingly,
this information makes clariﬁcation for the requesting user
about the nature of the new arrangement with respect to the
complexity of her work and the complexity of others’ work.
Hence, the related coordination aspects of user resistance can
be elucidated. Consequently, if any form of user resistance
has occurred, with the AC, we have built a mechanism that
promotes social inﬂuence to reduce the impact of the resis-
tance. However, we must evaluate whether this mechanism
can effectively reduce the impact of user resistance toward
WT adoption. In any case, if it is not possible to reduce
user resistance, then the AC contributes to making different
users aware of the aspect of resistance that is related to
coordination efforts. The AC accomplishes this goal in a
measurable fashion, giving the involved users voices and
allowing the management to hear this voice clearly. In
addition, this is done in an anonymous form to address users’
fears of possible retaliation. To socialize information about
the Coordination Requirements makes relative deprivation
explicit and can bring about a reduction in the perception of
organizational injustice [36]. With regard to the procedural
justice that is advocated because of participation in the
deﬁnition of new procedures [37] or because of the goal
to reduce employees’ frustration in response to instances of
organizational power [18], the AC can represent an alterna-
tive channel to provide voices for users, especially in the
presence of perceived procedural injustice [38]. The AC can
also facilitate vicarious learning [39] about situations that are
related to the new organization of the work by allowing users
to learn from each other by observing the other colleagues’
workloads and by making it possible to ﬁnd users who use
forms of unintentional “employee silence” [40].
IV. EVALUATION OF THE WES TOOL
The next step is to evaluate the real effectiveness of the
WES tool in limiting the possible negative effects that are
related to the coordination aspects of user resistance. To
do this, it is necessary to study the WES adoption in real
cases in which a Workﬂow technology–induced organiza-
tional change is occurring. To evaluate the effectiveness of
the WES tool, a set of experimental studies needs to be
implemented. First of all, a study to demonstrate, even if
some indirect evidences are available (see e.g., [29]), that
Coordination Requirements are positively related to user
resistance: i.e., the more the Coordination Requirements for
a user are, the more probably she will exhibit a resistant
behavior and viceversa. In addition, it would be useful also
to identify other job characteristics related to user resistance
such as autonomy [30] to enrich the WES tool. However,
this considering only the job characteristics which could be
easily incorporated into the WES tool because they could be
automatically generated from the workﬂow model designed
using the WES tool. Next, it is necessary to implement a set
of longitudinal studies comparing measures related to user
resistance before and after the change induced by the new
organization of work as a consequence of the introduction
of a Workﬂow Technology; this has to be done considering
both generic organizational measures such as organizational
commitment and locally relevant constructs associated to
the re-designed process [10]. The comparison of the values
measured before and after the change, could be used to
describe at what extent the change possibly determined the
rising of resistant behaviors.
While it is clear when to set the “before” time, i.e., before
the change process has been initiated, to set the “after” time
is more critical. In other words, when will it be convenient
to measure the effects of the change? The risk is that the
later the “after” is set in time, the more the effects of the
change are radical and most of all the more the costs of
WT implementation have been risen. Conversely, the risk is

predict the rising of resistant behaviors. It is so necessary to
ﬁnd an acceptable trade-off to set the “after” time. What is
an acceptable trade-off is however still a research question.
Some authors [29] considered to set the “after” time during
what is called the “shakedown” phase of the technology
deployment. This phase is considered as lasting from the
point the Workﬂow Technology is functional and accessible
by users until normal use is achieved. This is considered as
the most shocking phase for the users, who have to deal with
the new technology and hence with the real consequences of
its introduction; so, during this time, it is more possible than
users will exhibit resistant behaviors. Though we consider
this reasonable, we claim that however to set the “after”
time in the shakedown phase might result too later in time,
that is, in this case, the costs for the implementation of the
technology have been already risen, and also the time needed
to implement the Workﬂow Technology has been already
spent. What if all users during this phase would resist to
the adoption of the new technology? Perhaps is it better to
have a less realistic measure of resistance (e.g., to identify a
probability of resistance less accurately) but to limit the costs
of implementation? We believe that anticipating as much as
possible the setting of the “after” time would be the right
answer, and this is our challenge in proposing the WES tool.
Obviously, we need an experimental proof that to anticipate
the “after” time by using the WES tool gives however a
good approximation to predict the possibility of resistant
behaviors. To demonstrate this, we need to implement an
experimental study in which a group will be assessed to
measure constructs related to user resistance in the shake-
down phase, while another group will be assessed with the
WES tool in a very preliminary phase of the change, that is
by providing users with a simulation of the change occuring
with the re-designed process. The comparison of the mea-
sures collected at the two different times by considering the
two different groups will provide some useful information
about the feasibility of the WES approach. Another point
to investigate is about the effectiveness of the WES in
communicating the consequences of the change, because we
claim that socializing the information about consequences
of the change by means of social visualization techniques
should mitigate the emergence of resistant behaviors. In
this respect, another study should compare two (or possibly
more) groups in which the same change at the same “after”
time is communicated. With this design of the study, it is
possible to compare the measures related to user resistance
between the two (or more) groups in order to identify
whether the use of the WES tool is more effective or not
to limit the possible rise of resistant behaviors than other
strategies used to manage an organizational change induced
by the redesign of a work process.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The paper presented the WES, a tool for anticipating the
possible effects of user resistance toward the introduction
of a Workﬂow Technology at an early stage of its imple-
mentation. In fact, with WES, it is possible to design a
business process and to simulate its execution by involving
the possible Actors. Actors can be made aware of the
Coordination Requirements with respect to the other mutual
Actors through the Activity Circle. The AC implements a
social visualization approach in which the position of each
dot on a circle represents the strength of the Coordination
Requirement of the related Actor. The visualization of the
Coordination Requirements associated with each Actor then
allows for sharing the coordination aspects of the user
resistance among the involved people. This visualization is
intended to give voices to real users about the organization
of the work (as imposed by the Workﬂow Technology) at an
early stage of the implementation in an attempt to limit their
possible frustration and provide managers with information
that allows them to address, as soon as possible, any user
resistance. This approach limits the possible ramiﬁcations
that result from (at worst) a “sabotage” of the system [15]
or that limit the costs for redesigning the system. The WES
encompassing the HOMe-BUPro model and the visualiza-
tion of Coordination Requirements is being implemented as
a part of a research project of the author by integrating these
new features within the existing WES system [41]. Future
work will focus ﬁrst on the evaluation of the effectiveness
of the WES tool (see Section IV); second, future work will
focus on evaluating the possibility to integrate in the WES
tool different “organizational” measures that are related to
user resistance and to ﬁnd the way to visualize them with
the Activity Circle in a coherent way.
