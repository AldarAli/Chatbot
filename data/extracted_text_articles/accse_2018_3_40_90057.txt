cal comparative study of a new improved Probabilistic Analytic
Hierarchy Process (pAHP) in comparison to classic AHP method
in service selection problem in SOA architecture. The experiment
illustrates the possibility of using an pAHP algorithm for selecting
a proxy server in SOA architecture. A comparative study shows
the use of the pAHP algorithm on data from servers of a real
company. The effectiveness of the algorithm was tested and
the statistically signiﬁcance of pAHP over classical AHP was
demonstrated in the deﬁned case.

I. INTRODUCTION
A method for multi-criteria decision making is Analytic
Hierarchical Process (AHP), presented by Thomas Saaty [1].
Classic AHP includes the reduction of decision problems to a
series of comparisons and the synthesis of results using mathe-
matical equations [2]. The AHP also includes the technique of
examining the coherence of the decision-maker’s assessments
[3]–[8]. Classic AHP considers a set of criterias and a set
of alternatives out of which the best alternative is determined
[9]. A number of restrictions [10] of classic AHP [11] was our
motivation to propose a new pAHP algirithm and to implement
and assess its effectiveness for selecting optimal service in
SOA architecture.
II. PROBABILISTIC ANALYTIC HIERARCHICAL PROCESS
The ﬁrst step of pAHP is the acquisition of decision criteria
and alternatives. The output of the step is a set of criteria
and alternatives denoted by a and c. These are the vectors of
alternatives and criteria, where a(i) is the i-th alternative, for
i ∈ {1, 2, ..., m}, ci is the i-th criterion for i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}, m
is the number of alternatives, n is the number of criteria [12].
In the second step, the process of determining the probability
density function for the distribution of a random variable
should start by calculation from the distribution of the random
variable obtained from the sample based on the formula for
Kernel estimation [13]:
˜f(x) =
1
mh
m
X
i=1
K(x − xi
h
),
(1)
where: m is the number of sample elements, h - smoothing
parameter, xi are the next numerical values from the sample,
K - this function is called kernel [14]. The third step is to
set the weights of the criteria and alternatives. The output
will be a vector of alternative weights against the criteria: wj,
for j = 1, 2, ..., n, where n is the number of criteria or the
vector weighting criteria: w(0). Vector wj, for j = 1, ..., n is
m-dimensional, where m is the number of alternatives, while
w(0) is n-dimensional [15].
The fourth step is ﬁnal ranking. Results for each alternative
are obtained using the formula:
v(i),k =
n
X
j=0
w(0)
j
· w(i)
j ,
(2)
where: v(i),k is the point score of the i-th alternative in the
k-th iteration, and i ∈ {1, ..., m}, k ∈ {1, 2, ..., N}, m is
the number alternatives, N is the number of iterations, in
(0) is the weight of the jth criterion, w(0)
j
is the weight of
the i-th alternative to j-th criterion for i ∈ {1, ..., m} and
j ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}, n is the number of criteria. The ﬁfth step is
to establish a probabilistic ﬁnal ranking based on knowledge
about the distributions. Our method is called P-THRESHOLD
and calculates the probability of obtaining a score above a
given threshold t: v(i)
prob = P(V (i) > t).
III. SERVICE SELECTION WITH AHP AND PAHP
In order to test the effectiveness of the pAHP, an algorithm
for selecting a proxy server has been implemented. The
environment based on Hetzner dedicated server type PX70-
SSD enabled monitoring network trafﬁc parameters such as:
connection time (c1), query response time (c2), average trans-
fer speed (c3), success of delivery (c4) which where used as
algorithm criterias. The data forms where sent every minute to
the test part of the ofﬁce service. Four proxy servers were used.
The observation lasted 30 days with 1800 parameter values
collected for each hour. This was sufﬁcient to determine for

each criterion, the alternatives and the time of the probability
density function of the criterion value. Examples of average
values are shown in Table I. Identical comparisons with
the pairs of criteria were proposed in Table II. The weight

vector for criteria, calculated using the matrix’s own vector
method, is: [0.062, 0.224, 0.158, 0.556]. This vector of weights
was adopted regardless of the hour, because the validity of
the criteria does not change over time. Normalization for
the pAHP was performed by the expected value method.
The P-THRESHOLD method was chosen to determine the
ﬁnal results. Probability density function of ranking random
variables is presented in Figure 1. For each hour, one proxy
server was selected for the classical and probabilistic AHP.
Only hours in which decisions were different were selected for
the satisfaction survey. The company’s server used alternately

The users assessed satisfaction with the shipment (quality of
experience) according to their own criteria. The user did not
know that he was involved in the study and had no knowledge
about the method of sending data forms carried out by the
company. The effectiveness of the algorithm is understood as

the satisfaction of the system user. After sending the form, the
user was asked about the satisfaction of shipping and assessed
it on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is a lack of satisfaction, 5 is full
satisfaction. The study was carried out for one week during the
dispatch of annual testimonies. The test results were saved to
the database and then made available to the author. The results
are summarized in Table III. Classic AHP algorithm obtained
the average of: 4.538, the variance 0.617 and the standard
deviation: 0.785. The pAHP algorithm obtained an average of:
4.673, variance 0.503 and standard deviation: 0.709. Average
rating indicates better results for pAHP.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented preliminary ﬁndings of compara-
rive study of new improved probabilistic Analytic Hierarchy
Process (pAHP) in comparison to classic AHP method. The
experiment illustrated the possibility of using the implemented
pAHP scheme for selecting a service in SOA architecture.
The problem of selecting a proxy server to send queries was
resolved. The statistically signiﬁcance of probabilistic AHP
over classical AHP was demonstrated in the deﬁned case.
The algorithm uses additional knowledge about probability
distributions of criteria values for alternatives. This knowledge
allows to make automated decisions without the participation
of a decision maker. The conclusions conﬁrm the thesis about
the possibility of constructing a decision making algorithm in
probabilistic conditions, which is signiﬁcantly better than the
classical Analytical Hierarchical Process. Our future work will
focus on more detailed performance comparison of classical
AHP and new improved pAHP by performing experiments on
different case scenarios.
