Abstract— The views and experiences of the stakeholders on 
the use of telemedicine play an important role in the 
development of the service. This study aims to investigate the 
willingness of Japanese people to use the telemedicine service, 
and identify cases/situations it is preferred to use for. It also 
identifies the stakeholders’ opinions and needs to increase 
actual use of telemedicine. To achieve our goals, two different 
types of stakeholders were selected, including general public 
and medical doctors. Regarding the first group that includes 
ordinary people, 84 participants in the age ranging from 20 to 
64 years were randomly selected, and data were collected from 
them using a questionnaire. As for the second group of 
participants, online interviews were conducted with 25 
physicians (with ages ranging from 30 to 65 year) working in 
different scopes of medicine. The results of both surveys reveal 
that all participants except three doctors had never 
experienced 
telemedicine 
despite 
COVID-19 
state 
of 
emergency. Less than half of the participants in each group 
expressed their willingness to use telemedicine at present. 
Furthermore, the majority of our participants pointed out that 
telemedicine is a good tool for virtual visits to inpatients by 
their loved ones. Based on the stakeholders’ views and needs, 
this study identifies two approaches to increase telemedicine 
utilization. First approach aims to expand the scope of 
telemedicine, so that encompasses various issues, which 
currently concern the community in Japan. The second one 
focuses on improving the telemedicine platform through 
different actions recommended by each group of participants.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
    Since 2018, telemedicine has been covered by Japanese 
insurance, but the incentive to promote telemedicine is 
weaker than that of other countries partially due to free 
access to medical institutions and other issues [1] [2].    
Telemedicine can be defined as the use of electronic 
communications and information technologies to provide 
clinical services when participants are at different locations 
[3]. In April 2020, the COVID-19 crisis has prompted Japan 
to ease regulations on telemedicine [4]. However, the use of 
deregulated telemedicine has been sluggish compared to the 
US and UK. In Japan, only 15% of medical institutions have 
deployed telephone or online consultations [5]. Therefore, 
this study investigates public willingness to use current 
telemedicine service. It also identifies the needs of different 
stakeholders to develop telemedicine. In this study, the use 
of diverse population samples is useful to create an inclusive 
telemedicine service that meets the needs of as many people 
as possible. We focus on two types of stakeholders, 
including general public and medical doctors.       
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
explains the method of this study. Section III shows the 
results of the survey. Section IV includes discussion and 
limitation of a study. Section V includes conclusion. 
II. 
METHOD  
    To achieve our goals, online ‘semi-structured’ interviews 
’including 20 questions’ were conducted with 25 Japanese 
physicians (21 males and 4 females) between August and 
October 2020. The doctors were randomly selected for this 
study. Furthermore, a semi-structured questionnaire (9 
multiple-choice questions) was undertaken with 84 
individuals from the public (63 females and 21 males) 
between 
February 
and 
April 
2021. 
Selecting 
the 
questionnaire participants was based on their busy works 
with limited vacations time (about 10 days in a year) to visit 
hospitals. The questionnaire sheets had been given to the 
person in charge of the department by hand in order to 
distribute it to all the employees. Based on the literature 
review [6] [7], the questionnaire was designed, and then 
piloted on 5 individuals. From the responses of 5 people, the 
questions were revised and determined. Probing questions 
were used to determine the best patterns and circumstances 
for making telemedicine services more usable and efficient.  
     In this study, all participants were provided with an 
explanation of telemedicine and all information regarding 
the study, including the purposes for undertaking the 
surveys. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from 
the Kyushu University Hospital, permission no. 2021-15.  
III. 
RESULT 
    The questions were answered by two various types of 
stakeholders. First group includes 84 administrative 
employees (63 females and 21 males). Second group 
includes 25 medical doctors (21 males and 4 females). The 
following are the main results of the surveys.  
A. The Characteristic of Participants 
The first group includes the general public, and with ages 
ranging from 20 to 64 years.

They are administrative employees working (full-time job) 
in different business sectors at 2 public universities in the 
Fukuoka city. The results of the questionnaire indicated that 
all participants have no physical disabilities, and are not 
telemedicine users. Fifty-nine (70%) of them are somewhat 
aware of telemedicine. The majority (29%) visit the 
hospitals about 2 times a year (Table 1).  
     On the other hand, the second group includes medical 
doctors with ages ranging from 30 to 65 years old. They are 
working in various scopes of medicine (including internal 
medicine, 
neurology, 
dermatology, 
orthopedics, 
otorhinolaryngology and ophthalmology), and at different 
healthcare facilities (including university and non-university 
hospitals as well as small clinics). The results of online 
interviews with 25 physicians revealed that at the beginning 
of COVID-19 pandemic (from May to August 2020) only 3 
out of 25 doctors practiced telemedicine (hospital-based 
telemedicine) via telephone (audio only visit). Furthermore, 
we found that 18 (72%) of them were somewhat aware of 
telemedicine (Table 2).  
B. Opinions Towards the Use of Telemedicine Service  
    All participants were asked about their interest in and 
willingness to use telemedicine. Regarding the first group 
(see Figure 1), less than half (46%) of participants answered 
with “yes”. About 37 (44%) of participants chose “I’m not 
sure”, and 8 (10%) of them responded with “no”.  
Concerning the situations/cases, in which the participants 
may use a telemedicine for, 65 (77%) of them would prefer 
to use the service in the state of a personal emergency “mild 
illness”, while 30 (36%) participants might use the service 
when it is imposed by policies or other means. Twenty-five 
(30%) participants answered that when a hospital is far from 
home, while 15 (18%) participants responded that it might 
happen for prescription renewals and chronic care 
management. A few (7%) participants indicated that in all 
cases, they will not use telemedicine, and 3 (4%) 
participants chose “other”.  
     On the other side, the majority (48%) of doctors in the 
second group expressed their interest in telemedicine despite 
its shortcomings which have a negative effect on the use of 
a service (see Figure 2). Regarding the major reasons for 
abandoning a telemedicine at present; 15 (60%) doctors 
stated their inability to perform an accurate and complete 
physical exam for the patients, while 12 (48%) of them 
mentioned lower revenues of telemedicine. Furthermore, 7 
(28%) doctors stated their preferences for in-person visit 
over a telemedicine (such as; P # 2 stated that “it is not 
possible to build trust with the patients through 
telemedicine”, and P # 8 mentioned that “the relationship 
between doctor and patient is based on trust. This trust 
strengthens when people actually meet each other. In virtual 
consultation, even trust becomes virtual”). About 6 (24%) 
participants stated the barriers related to telemedicine work 
environment (including regulations and facilities). Further, 6 
(24%) doctors indicated social influences on their decision-
making, while 3 (12%) doctors stated other issues, such as 
most of the patients are elderly and have poor ICT skills 
(see Figure 3).  
C. Expanding the Scope of Telemedicine  
     The participants were asked about their issues/concerns, 
which could be well addressed through online care services. 
The majority (62%) of participants in the first group 
indicated that telemedicine is a good tool for virtual visits to 
inpatients by their loved ones and/or conducting remote 
follow-up meetings with the family members who are 
unable to be with their hospitalized patients. Forty-two 
(50%) participants stated that telemedicine could be 
effectively used for following up care, including post-
operative follow up, while 39 (46%) participants mentioned 
that the service is a suitable way to educate people about 
lifestyle diseases. Twenty - two (26%) participants indicated 
that telemedicine can be used for patients on board (such as 
emergency medical care on the express train or at the sea by 
providing medical advice for the passengers on board ships), 
while 19 (23%) participants stated their needs to school-
based telemedicine program for providing access to high-
quality healthcare in the school setting. A few (12%) 
participants mentioned the need to use telemedicine for birth 
control counselling. Eight (10%) participants chose “other” 
(see Figure 4). On the other hand, the result of online 
interviews detected that the majority (40%) of physicians 
agreed with the first group of participants on the suitability 
of telemedicine for the virtual visits to inpatients by their 
loved ones and relatives.  
D. Actions to Improve a Telemedicine Platform 
     We asked the participants about their views and needs to 
improve a telemedicine platform. The majority (49%) of 
first group indicated the importance of creating a user-
friendly telemedicine program (see Figure 5). Twenty-four 
(29%) participants suggested to provide telemedicine in 
higher number of hospitals and be for all, while 21 (25%) 
participants requested to make the service available at any 
time “24 hours a day, and 7 days a week”. Twenty (24%) 
participants indicated the necessity to offer many value-
added programs to telemedicine patients as a part of their 
wellness programs, while 18 (21%) participants requested to 
make the services easy to access without having Internet 
connection problems. 
About 
17 
(20%) 
participants 
responded that telemedicine must consider desires and needs 
by age demographic. Ten participants (12%) chose “other”, 
such as recommended that telemedicine be held to the same 
standards of in-person care, and establish unique patient 
engagement strategy that focuses on creating greater 
awareness of telemedicine’s potential and its usage.  
     Regarding the doctors' viewpoints and needs, the 
following are the most important actions to develop and 
expand the telemedicine service. 
• 
Recommendations for telemedicine expansion: 
P # 2 “Due to some issues, telemedicine will not spread in 
Japan unless it is mandated by policy or other means”. 
P # 3 “Patients are not ready for telemedicine. They should 
learn about the service as a quick option to receive care”.

P # 7 “There is a necessity to promote telemedicine in the 
unpopulated/remote area in Japan”.  
P # 24 and 25 “Telemedicine should be more widespread in 
order to prevent infections and improve the efficiency of 
medical treatment. It is not very popular because many 
elderly people are not familiar with ICT. Therefore, ICT 
education for both elderly doctors and patients is needed”. 
• 
Recommendations for raising telemedicine awareness: 
P # 4 “Patients broadly should know the merit and demerit 
of telemedicine and accept it”. 
P # 17 “Unique and advanced marketing strategies should 
be established to increase the patient awareness of 
telemedicine, such as the successful approach which is used 
for 'generic”.  
• 
Recommendations about the regulations and facilities: 
P # 3, 17 and 20 “It is necessary to put strict rules and high- 
quality clinical practice guidelines to avoid any crimes or 
medical malpractice with telemedicine’. 
P # 20 “All Japanese, especially politicians and lawyers 
should be fully aware of the telemedicine risks”. 
P # 5 and 20 “About the issue of low practice fee, the 
payments for telemedicine are better not covered by the 
health insurance, and allow doctors to set the prices freely. 
Furthermore, subsidies are needed. Cheap refund for 
hospitals, implementation and running cost. Medical fee 
should be increased for hospitals”. 
P # 1 “Telemedicine should maintain the same income as F- 
to- F meeting”.  
P # 13 and 20 “Policies of hospitals and equipment for  
telemedicine should be well prepared to use the service as 
one of its treatment tools”. 
 
 
 
E. Usability requirements for a Telemedicine Meeting 
     Regarding the most suitable and trustful healthcare 
delivery model, the survey results revealed that the majority 
(74%) of participants in the first group  preferred home-
based telemedicine, while 12 (14%) participants chose 
mobile medical clinic, and a few (12%) participants selected 
the hospital-based telemedicine. Regarding the better mode 
for communication, we found that the majority (73%) of 
participants 
preferred 
video 
call, 
while 
17 
(20%) 
participants chose voice call, and a few (7%) participants 
selected “other”.  About the most adequate device for a 
telemedicine visit, the majority (38%) preferred smartphone 
“using a video call service”, while 30 (36%) participants 
chose PC/tablet, about 24% of participants preferred 
smartphone “a voice call only”, and a few (2%) of them 
chose “other” (see Figure 6).  
 
     On the other hand, the result of online interviews with 25 
physicians detected that 14 (56%) doctors stated the 
necessity to improve their ICT skills, while 13 (52%) of 
them want the opportunity to experience first-hand what 
telemedicine is all about. Furthermore, 8 (32%) doctors 
stated other issues, such as getting the agreement of 
administrative staffs to practice the service in the hospitals, 
while 6 (24%) doctors wanted to find ways to train the staff 
on a shortened time. About 4 (16%) of doctors wanted to 
improve their online communication skills with patients (see 
Figure 7).

 DISCUSSION 
    Telemedicine services have the advantage of ensuring the 
health of inaccessible local residents and increasing 
convenience [8] [9]. Studies have shown that remote 
monitoring approaches are as effective as – and in some 
cases better than – in-person care for many chronic 
conditions [10] [11]. However, all the participants in this 
study, except three doctors, were not telemedicine users, 
even in a state of public health emergency due to the SARS-
CoV-2 outbreak. Further, less than half of the participants 
from each group expressed their willingness to use the 
telemedicine service at present. In Japan there is a strong 
cultural bias towards face-to-face consultation, but the 
servicing rural and remote areas by doctors is increasingly 
difficult so there is an urgent need to increase the uptake of 
telemedicine [2]. These may confirm the viewpoints and 
recommendations of some physicians (P # 2, 3, 7 17, 23 and 
24) on the necessity to establish innovative strategies for 
increasing the awareness and use of telemedicine.  
     In terms of telemedicine growth and development, studies 
reported that the service should deliver care that respects the 
patients’ preferences and values - responds to needs in a 
person-centered manner [12] [13].  
     Based on the participants’ responses, there are two 
approaches to potentially increase the use of telemedicine in 
Japan. First one aims to expand telemedicine capabilities. 
This is by identifying community issues and concerns that 
can be addressed through online care services. In other 
words, it is better going beyond traditional home diagnostic 
and monitoring activities to include further medical care 
forms where the individuals’ abilities are restricted. 
    The survey results revealed that most (62%) participants  
 
 
 
 
 
    
in the first group indicated that telemedicine is a good tool 
for virtual visits to inpatients by their loved ones and/or 
conducting remote follow-up meetings with the family 
members who are unable to be with their patients at 
hospitals. The same suggestion had been stated by the 
majority (40%) of physicians participating in this study.  
    The second approach is about understanding people’s 
requirements, preferences and views to improve a 
telemedicine platform. Based on the responses of first group, 
there are 6 key actions suggested to higher use of a 
telemedicine service.  
    Regarding the first action, the majority (49%) stated the 
importance of creating telemedicine equipment as user- 
friendly as possible. The usability issue is one of the seven 
core principles that underlie the development of successful 
telemedicine systems [14]. Furthermore, to make a 
telemedicine easier and safer, be mindful of the importance 
of site in which virtual encounters occur [12].  
   The survey results indicated that most participants 
preferred to conduct a telemedicine appointment at home by 
using video call over the smartphone. Similar findings 
showed in another survey that the majority of Japanese 
participants preferred video call with supplementary text 
message as a communication tool used for telemedicine [15].  
    On the other hand, studies pointed out that home-based 
telemedicine system via video conference can be of great 
benefit to patients in terms of convenience, reliability, health 
care availability, and cost savings. However, there are some 
issues affecting the efficiency of this system and should be 
well considered and addressed, such as privacy and security 
concerns, patient age, patient and healthcare professional's 
capabilities to use digital technology, Internet speed, network

signal, audio quality, and technological compatibility [16] 
[17] [18]. In addition, a recent study indicated the necessity 
of the apps being easy to use for patients and staff, providing 
smooth access to important functions [19]. Regarding this 
point, further study stated that a user-friendly device which is 
easy to use by patients with low digital literacy is helpful, 
and a system allows medical personnel to remotely control 
the equipment could be an option [11].  
    Generally, usability is an important key to the successful 
implementation of telemedicine which is why the majority 
(56%) of physicians participating in the study indicated the 
need to improve their skills in using the ICT system, while 
some (P# 24 and 25) of them stated the need to educate the 
ICT among older adults (including physicians and patients).  
    Second action, 24 (29%) participants suggested providing 
the telemedicine services in the greater number of 
hospitals/clinics. In Japan, there is a slow spread of 
telemedicine in the hospitals. A high percentage of hospitals 
are not offering the service due to many issues, such as the 
lack of infrastructure and uncertainty about reimbursement 
[20]. This was also indicated by some doctors (P# 1, 5, 13 
and 20) through the interviews. A study reported that among 
the 110,898 medical institutions that exist, the number of 
medical institutions implementing telemedicine increased 
slightly from 10,812 (9.7%) in April 2020 to 16,202 (14.6%) 
in June. Of this number, only 6,801 (6.1%) medical 
institutions implement telemedicine for a patient’s first visit 
[21]. Lack of telemedicine use in the hospitals is not only 
limited to the clinical services (including remote patient 
care), but also to the non-clinical activities (such as medical 
education, management meetings, provider training, etc.). A 
recent study pointed out that international telemedicine 
conferencing is not sufficiently active in Japan, even though 
the installed equipment and technical expertise of technical 
staff in telemedicine are adequate [22]. 
    The third action is about the service availability seven 
days a week. The current study findings showed that twenty-
one (25%) participants requested to offer telemedicine 
services for patients at any time, day or night. This might be 
because there are sometimes difficulties to find an 
appropriate major hospital/clinic to visit in case of an 
emergency in Japan [23] [24]. Confirmation on that, 65 
(77%) participants would prefer to use telemedicine services 
in a state of a personal emergency.  
    The fourth action, 20 (24%) participants recommended 
offering many value-added programs to the telemedicine 
patients as a part of their wellness programs.   Regarding the 
fifth action, 18 (21%) participants clarified the importance of 
fast Internet speed for transmitting patients’ files, records, 
pictures, and videos. A study reported that 18 factors inhibit 
the dissemination of telemedicine service in Japan, including 
network speed [25]. Most of the telemedicine applications 
require a high speed and reliable Internet bandwidth to run 
smoothly. Unreliable and low wideband Internet pose 
barriers in smooth delivery of telemedicine service [26].  
     Last action, 17 (20%) participants stated the necessity of 
considering telemedicine desires by age demographic 
because not all generations have same requirements towards 
telemedicine. A study reported that age plays a large role in 
consumer healthcare trends and telemedicine usage. 
Understanding consumer telemedicine trends by age group 
may be the key to increasing awareness and the use of 
telemedicine [27].  
    Based on the answers of the respondents, it can be said 
that telemedicine has not significantly spread in Japan 
despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study 
detected that it would be better to incorporate telemedicine 
service in our lives, rather than just focusing on medical 
consultations. This is by using telemedicine tools to address 
the issues of health care that concern the society. 
Furthermore, there are some issues that obstruct the growth 
of the service at present. Therefore, the answers of two 
groups of participants revealed that the telemedicine service 
is likely to be used more by considering certain actions. In 
this study, the needs and interests of each group have 
influenced the proposed actions. The participants in first 
group recommended specific actions related to the service 
usability, availability, value, and accessibility, while the 
suggested points of second group are related to the service 
awareness and facilities, as well as legal and business issues.  
    Overall, it can be stated that telemedicine success begins 
with the individuals’ satisfaction. Stakeholders will start 
demanding more use of telemedicine that is when the service 
satisfies their needs and interests. 
    Regarding the limitation of this study, the survey was 
conducted with limited number of Japanese participants. 
The results cannot be generalized beyond the participants of 
a study. The participants expressed their own perspectives to 
develop the current telemedicine platform, and these may 
not express views of the majority of Japanese people. 
 
V.      CONCLUSION  
    Although telemedicine brings important benefits to 
promote wellness, prevent disease, and enable the home 
management of chronic conditions, it is still relatively 
uncommon to use in Japan. This study discussed the 
stakeholders' perspectives on the use of telemedicine. It 
investigated the willingness of Japanese people to use 
telemedicine, and in what situations/cases it is preferable to 
use for. It also identified two approaches to promote the use 
of telemedicine services.  
    The first approach aims to expand the scope of 
telemedicine, so as to address many issues which concern 
the society. Regarding the second approach, it focuses on 
developing the telemedicine service by understanding the 
stakeholders’ views and needs. Based on valuable feedback

of the participants from the general public, 6 actions are 
suggested to improve a telemedicine platform, and possibly 
raise the rate of its usage.  
     The key actions are concerning telemedicine usability, 
availability, 
value, 
and 
accessibility. 
Furthermore, 
recommendations have been made by the medical doctors 
about telemedicine awareness and facilities, as well as legal 
and business issues of the service.  
     On basis of the above findings, further studies are needed 
to explore the demands of different groups of individuals, 
such as older adults. Using larger and more diverse 
population samples will be valuable to establish the 
inclusive telemedicine service that fulfills the basic needs of 
the society.
