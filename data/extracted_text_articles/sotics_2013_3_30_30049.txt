Abstract— Dengue is a public health problem that presents 
complexity in its dissemination. The physical means of 
spreading and the dynamics of the spread between the 
municipalities need to be analyzed to guide effective public 
policies to combat this problem. This study shows a correlation 
between the exponent of Criticality present in Self-Organized 
Criticality (SOC) and the number of buses per week, 
identifying municipalities that exert important roles in the 
spread of dengue in Bahia, confirming transport as a physical 
means for the diffusion of dengue.

 INTRODUCTION  
Many factors were responsible for the resurgence of 
epidemic dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 
last years of the 20th century. Demographic and social 
changes such as population growth, urbanization and modern 
transport contribute to the increased incidence and geographic 
expansion of dengue. 
The prevalence of this public health problem is greater in 
tropical areas of Asia and the Americas. The epidemiological 
situation in Latin America is similar to the reality found in 
Southeast Asia a few years ago, where there is circulation of 
multiple serotypes, and therefore the increase in the number of 
cases of classic dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever. 
In 2002, Latin American countries have reported a number 
greater than 1 million cases of dengue, with approximately 
17,000 of these, cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting 
in 225 deaths [1]. Dengue is a major cause of mortality and 
morbidity in the tropics [2]. 
The history of dengue in Bahia began in 1987 when it 
was recorded for the serotype DEN-1, in the municipality of 
Ipupiara, which resulted in a local epidemic [3] [4]. Focusing 
on isolated urban area in the municipality measures to 
combat the epidemic has intensified, acting in intense 
combat Aedes aegypti, being controlled before reaching 
neighboring municipalities [5]. 
In 1995, the municipality of Prado, southern Bahia, 
identified the first case of DEN-2, we starting an epidemic. 
The same was not contained and has spread to other 
municipalities in Bahia [3]. The Aedes aegypti is present in 
99.5% of the municipalities of Bahia, and has been reported 
from the four serotypes: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and 
DEN-4. Preventive actions undertaken to combat epidemic 
outbreaks, were not sufficient to control the dengue 
epidemic, which gradually spreads throughout the country 
and even to other countries of Latin America [6] [7]. 
Bahia with an area of 567 295 km², its size surpasses 
countries like France with an area of 543,965 km² to 504,030 
km² and Spain. Its composition is 417 municipalities that are 
linked by 22 Federal Highway (BR) and 11 State Highways 
(BA) [8]. As a network of ground transportation, the main 
route of migration between these municipalities is also the 
primary means of spreading of dengue in the state. In order 
to better understand the dengue transmission dynamics in 
Bahia, we use the social networking tools. 
This paper is organized as follows: The next section 
demonstrates the methodology applied, the third section will 
comment on the results, and the fourth section will finalize 
with a conclusion. 
II. 
METHODOLOGY 
The construction methodology of the Transport Network 
(Transbahia) was made from the analysis of road maps of 
Bahia, the lifting of federal highways (BR) and state 
highways (BA) that connect the municipalities. In the 
creation of the Transportation Network in Bahia (Figure 1), 
we used the basic principles of graphs, where each of the 417 
municipalities was represented by a vertex (node), and 7368 
km of roads that connect the municipalities are represented 
by an edge connecting these vertices.

Based on road maps, the graph was assembled by the 
Program for Large Network Analysis (PAJEK) [9]. Only 
municipalities were considered, discarding the villages and 
districts, since, in both instances, the records are held by a 
municipal health department. 
In order to make the transport networks, the follow steps 
were made:  
1.  Four hundred and seventeen municipalities were 
geographically divided in Bahia; 
2. Each node is labeled with the corresponding name of 
the municipality; 
3. Each node received a number, which was used in the 
correlation between municipalities;  
4. Based on road maps each direct link between 
municipalities is represented by an edge in the graph; 
5. The distance in Km between two counties was 
represented by the network weight, which is the third 
element representative; 
6. To facilitate visualization, were placed coordinates for 
the vertical and horizontal axis, allowing the spatial 
distribution of the network (Figure 1). 
 
 
 
Figure 1 - Transport Network in Bahia. 
 
According to 2010 national transport company (CNT), 
surface conditions of these roads are in working condition. 
      By analyzing Dengue in Bahia with 417 municipalities, 
only 45 municipalities (10.79%), according to the Ministry 
of Health through the National Dengue Control (NPDC), 
were prioritized.  
The deployment priority is defined based on population 
and epidemiological aspects: capital cities, metropolitan 
areas, municipalities with a population ≥ 50,000 inhabitants, 
and cities with high immigration (i.e., borders, ports, tourism 
core) [10]. 
The Ministry of Health, in 2013, invested U$6.6 million 
for actions to combat dengue in Bahia. This investment is 
aimed at improving measures to combat dengue in the state, 
being allocated to all 417 municipalities in the state, 
according to the State Department of Health (Sesab). 
However, there are municipalities where the rate of 
occurrence is larger; they are considered hubs, to be 
connected with several other municipalities and these should 
be treated differently. 
To construct the Bahia transport network attacked 
(TransBahiaAtac), the cities with degree higher than 5 were 
deleted from the TransBahia Network (Figure 2): Bom Jesus 
da Lapa, Barra, Buritirama, Vitória da Conquista, Jacobina, 
Santo Antônio de Jesus, Jequié, Brumado, Itaberaba, Santa 
Inês, Valença, Caetité, Condeúba, Boquira, Sítio do Mato.  
Without these municipalities, the network was divided in 
smaller groups, a fact that could facilitate the control of 
outbreaks. With this procedure, the network becomes 
disconnected, with 61 connected components, mostly made 
up of groups below 10 municipalities.

III. 
EXPONENT OF CRITICALITY PRESENT IN 
SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY (SOC) 
The variability of the frequency of occurrence in the 
number of dengue cases among different municipalities is 
caused by climatic diversity in the state of Bahia, for 
complex effects of migration and other environmental 
effects [11]. This suggests the existence of interdependence 
in the occurrence of dengue among municipalities regarding 
the cases distribution. To evaluate this possibility, we 
calculate the curves of the probability occurrence of dengue 
cases in each county. Figure 3 shows an example in 
logarithmic scale of the probability distribution for the 
Camaçari county. 
Through the database SINAN data were mined, so that 
occurrences were grouped by cities and presented with a 
total daily of reported cases of occurrences per day.

For all studied cities, we constructed histograms of 
occurrences obtained from the dengue epidemiological time 
series. The frequency of occurrence for each city follows a 
power law. This behavior is characteristic of systems that 
obey the so-called self-organized criticality (SOC). Figure 3 
shows the histogram of the City of Camaçari; in red, we 
present the apparent linear fitting with a power exponent δ = 
-2,34.  
 
Figure 3 - Cases of Dengue 2000-2009 in Camaçari. 
 
SOC is a phenomenon found in systems that reach a 
critical condition during a process of natural evolution, 
without any external intervention. During his critical 
condition, this system can undergo reactions stimulated by 
unpredictable changes or minimum noise [12]. 
In order to understand this behavior, we estimate the 
power laws exponents for each county of Bahia. Table 1 
shows the values of the exponents of the 20 most populated 
municipalities with dengue cases (we considered the 
population in 2000, the year that starts the database). 
Observe that all coefficients have values less than three, 
which represent power laws with long tails (decay slower 
than exponential). We can also observe that the values of the 
Pearson correlation coefficient R [13], Table 1, indicate 
significant fittings. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
It is also observed that the exponents of criticality in the 
municipalities are related to the number of intercity buses 
that circulate per week in the municipalities; the relationship 
is shown in Figure 4. 
In order to evaluate the significance of this correlation 
was applied an randomization analysis for Spearman 
correlation [14], with 100,000 randomizations of the data 
[15], we found a probability of only 0.00057 of the original 
correlation is due to chance, i.e., only 0.057% of the results 
had correlations greater or equal to the original correlation 
[16]. The graph in Figure 5 shows the comparison between 
the distribution of the correlation values found to 100,000 
randomizations and the correlation of the original data. 
Thus, it was observed that there is significant correlation 
between the exponents of criticality () and the numbers of 
buses that run weekly in the municipalities in Bahia.

Figure 4 - Number of intercity buses as function of exponent for all 417 
municipalities in Bahia. 
The significant correlation between the critical exponent 
and the number of intercity buses suggests that the hole in 
outbreaks dynamic is governed by the transport network 
flux. With this result, we can propose preventive actions 
directed to the topology of the network. Thus, for example, 
an action in road hubs changes a possible generalized 
epidemic in local outbreaks. The elimination of the hubs of 
the network could represent the concentration of federal
