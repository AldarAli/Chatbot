Abstract— In this paper, we present an analytical method to 
model the joint probability density function of delay and leakage 
power. In order to model the joint distribution of these two 
parameters, they should be modeled independently through an 
accurate method. The manufacturing process variations as the 
sources of delay and leakage power variations are considered in 
our modeling. We also demonstrate that the proposed method is 
so accurate in modeling joint cumulative density function which 
is the very parametric yield whose predicting is the main 
objective of this work. Finally, the proposed method is verified 
by HSPICE simulations for combinational benchmark circuits 
in 45 nm technology. We compare the accuracy of our method 
with that of classic bivariate Gaussian estimation. Simulation 
results reveal that the mean percentage error of our proposed 
technique for joint cumulative density function of ISCAS85 
benchmark circuits is 2.5 % by average. The average 
improvement achieved in accuracy of modeling joint cumulative 
density function through our work compared to aforementioned 
classic method is 17.1 % and 16.8% respectively without and 
with considering correlated intra-die variations.

INTRODUCTION  
The scaling of CMOS has resulted in the increasing 
magnitude of the variabilities which manifest themselves in 
the forms of random and systematic variations. Sources of 
variations could range from random dopant fluctuation to 
non-idealities imposed by photolithography [1] [2].  
The dramatic increase in leakage power with scaling, and a 
strong dependence of leakage on highly varying process 
parameters, raises the importance of statistical leakage and 
parametric-yield optimization. Leakage-power consumption 
increases are due to both channel (subthreshold)-leakage and 
gate-leakage currents [3]. The subthreshold current is a strong 
exponential function of highly variable process parameters. It 
has been demonstrated that the variability of subthreshold 
leakage depends primarily on L and Vth [4]. Leakage power is 
inversely correlated with chip frequency. Hence, the Joint 
Probability Density Function (JPDF) of delay and leakage 
should be modeled precisely in order to budget one while 
optimizing another. As a result, parametric yield modeling 
considering the correlation between delay and leakage 
consumption is of great importance.  
Yield –driven optimization tools require accurate statistical 
models for both timing and leakage consumption considering 
correlation between them. There have been works which have 
limited their yield estimation to either timing or leakage [5], 
[6]. However, these approaches neglect the correlation 
between delay and leakage power.  
Although [7] proposes a methodology to model the 
parametric 
yield 
considering 
leakage/performance 
correlation, it only presents a closed-form equation for total 
chip leakage that models the dependence of the leakage 
current distribution on different process parameters. The only 
closed-form expression for JPDF of delay and leakage has 
been proposed by [8][9], wherein the cornerstone of modeling 
is taking the JPDF of delay and logarithm of leakage as 
bivariate normal distribution. [10] and [11] despite of 
improving and building their method upon [8][9] still use the 
same model which is bivariate normal approximation. 
In this paper, we present an analytical approach to 
accurately model the JPDF of delay and leakage power. In 
order to verify the efficacy and accuracy of our proposed 
method, we present the results of HSPICE Monte Carlo 
simulation as well as those of our model for the performance 
and leakage consumption of ISCAS85 benchmark circuits 
[12]. The simulations have been performed in Nangate 45 nm 
open cell library technology [13]. It should be mentioned that 
the method presented in this paper is not limited only to this 
specific issue in Integrated Circuits industry. This method can 
be extended to any application in engineering and science 
where modeling and simulation of the JPDF of several 
random variables is the main objective. This paper is 
organized as follows. Section II briefly introduces the main 
formulations we use to model the delay and leakage power 
under variations. Section III introduces our proposed 
analytical yield modeling. Section IV discusses the 
simulation results and a comparison is made between our 
method and previous work. Finally, Section V concludes the 
paper. 
II. 
FORMULATIONS OF DELAY AND LEAKAGE POWER 
UNDER VARIATIONS 
In order to model delay and leakage power under process 
variations, we need to determine which parameters of the 
circuit are subject to variations. In this paper, similar to [9], 
we assume that gate-length and gate-length-independent 
threshold voltage are the sources of variation. It is also 
assumed that these sources are normally distributed. 
According to [9], delay and leakage power of an individual 
gate can be expressed as following:

which is the probability of delay and leakage being less than 
D0 and P0, respectively. Srivastava and Chopra propose a 
bivariate Gaussian random variable for yield [8][9]. 
According to [8][9], it is assumed that delay and logarithm of 
leakage are normally distributed. As a result, they proposed 
the bivariate normal distribution for JPDF of delay and 
logarithm of leakage as follows:

where, x, y, and ρ respectively stand for delay, natural 
logarithm of leakage, and correlation coefficient. However, 
even if the gate delays are assumed to be normal, it should be 
mentioned that maximum operation is an inherently nonlinear 
function. The maximum of two normal distributions is a non-
Gaussian distribution. Blauuw et al discuss and explain the 
non-Gaussian nature of delay distribution [14]. Besides, the 
simulation results reveal that natural logarithm of leakage 
consumption deviate from normal distribution. For some 
input states of gates, the leakage distribution does not show 
lognormal behavior. As a result, the accurate JPDF of delay 
and natural logarithm of leakage is skewed by both variables. 
Hence, there is a need to analytically calculate the JPDF of 
delay and leakage power in order to obtain a more accurate 
prediction.  
A. 
Analytical JPDF of Delay and Leakage Power 
Given two random variables x and y and two functions 
g(x,y) and h(x,y) we assume we have the following functions: 
             
,     = (x, y)
(x, y)    
=
h
w
g
z
                                    (5) 
These functions are also random variables whose JPDF 
shall be expressed in terms of JPDF of x and y. Given this 
fact, we shall express the JPDF fzw(z,w) of the random 
variables z=g(x,y) and w=h(x,y) in terms of the JPDF fxy(x,y) 
of the random variables x and y. The Jacobian function J(x,y) 
is, by definition, the determinant given by:

J(x, y) =

To find fzw(z,w), we solve the systems (5) for x and y. If this 
system has no real solutions in some region of the zw plane, 
fzw(z,w)=0 for every (z,w) in that region. Suppose, then, that 
(5) has one or more solutions (xi,yi), that is,

where (xi, yi) are all pairs satisfying (7) [15]. The 
aforementioned procedure is extendable to any n×n systems. 
Now, for calculating the JPDF of delay and leakage power, 
we can replace z and w by delay and leakage power, 
respectively, in previous analysis. However, in our case, we 
may have n sources of variation where n is not necessarily 
equal with 2. In this case, we have to add n-2 auxiliary 
equations to systems. Hence, in our case where we have 3 
sources of variation, our 3*3 1st order systems are as 
following:

Analytical Parametric Yield 
According to (3), the parametric yield of a circuit given 
delay and leakage power constraints is the probability of 
delay and leakage power being less than D0 and P0. 
Subsequently, having found the JPDF of delay and leakage 
power, the parametric yield of a circuit can be expressed as

The parametric yield is a 3-dimentional surface versus

constraints. 
This 
surface 
monotonically increases from 0 to 1 as it represents a 
probability.  
C. 
Correlated Intra-Die Variations 
The sources of variation are correlated within the die area. 
To handle the correlated components of variations, the overall 
chip is divided into a grid as shown in Figure 1. The 
correlation coefficient varies from one and falls off to zero 
with increasing distance. Each square in the grid corresponds 
to a random variable of the process parameter which has 
correlations with all other random variables corresponding to 
other squares in the grid. The values at the top of each of the 
grids show the correlation coefficients with the top left square 
on the grid.  
To simplify the problem, this set of correlated random 
variables is replaced by another set of mutually independent 
random variables with zero mean and unit variance using the 
principal components of the set of correlated random 
variables. A vector of random variables, say X, with a 
correlation matrix C, can be expressed as a linear 
combination of the principal components Y as [8]:

deviations of X, V is the matrix of the eigenvectors of C, and D 
is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of C. If 
Pp
in (1) is 
generated by (17), correlated sources of variations are 
incorporated in calculating delay and leakage power 
consumption.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
We implemented our proposed model and bivariate 
normal model in MATLAB and compared the accuracy of 
both approaches by HSPICE Monte Carlo simulations. We 
performed 10.000 Monte Carlo simulations on ISCAS 85 
benchmark circuits assuming that all sources of variations 
have (3σ/μ=20%). In this paper, we assume that sources of 
variations are channel-length and gate-length independent 
threshold voltages of NMOS and PMOS transistors. In this 
work, the full-chip simulations on ISCAS 85 circuits have 
been set up similar to those of [8] in terms of sources of 
variations. In our approach, the JPDF of delay and leakage 
power are calculated analytically by means of Jacobian 
matrix. 
Figure 2 depicts the JPDF and Joint Cumulative 
Distribution Function (JCDF) of bivariate normal model for 
c432 from the benchmark circuits. Figure 3 shows the JPDF 
and JCDF of our model and simulation results. As shown in 
Figure 2 and Figure 3, the JPDF of our model is visually 
more similar to that of simulation results compared to 
bivariate normal model. The errors are calculated with regard 
to HSPICE simulation results. The Mean Percentage Error 
(MPE) of model is calculated as following:

have calculated the average error improvement achieved for 
estimating the JCDF of delay and leakage by our model to be 
17.1% compared to bivariate normal model when correlated 
intra-die variations have not been considered. The mentioned 
average error improvement has been calculted to be 16.8% by 
considering correlated intra-die variations. We have assumed 
that the correlated intra-die variations follow the pattern of 
Figure 1 for all circuits.

CONCLUSION 
We proposed a methodology for modeling the JPDF and 
parametric yield considering variations of delay and leakage 
power. In this method, we analytically calculated the JPDF of 
leakage power and delay by means of Jacobian matrix. Then, 
JCDF (parametric yield) was extracted by integration. We 
demonstrated that JPDF and JCDF achieved by our modeling 
outperform their counterparts in [8][9]. Simulation results in 
45 nm technology on ISCAS85 benchmark circuits revealed 
that our proposed model improves the accuracy of JCDF 
17.1% and 16.8% by average, respectively, without and with 
considering correlated intra-die variations. The proposed 
method in this paper is generic and can be incorporated in 
modeling any JPDF in engineering, considering the 
correlations among the random variables, where accuracy of 
the model is of great importance.
