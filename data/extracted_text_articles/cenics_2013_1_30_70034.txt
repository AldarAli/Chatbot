Abstract—This paper reports upon the design and development 
of a low cost, high sensitivity, high frequency surface acoustic 
wave resonator (SAWR) based system for gas sensing 
applications. The 262 MHz one-port SAWR operates in a 
grounded-base Colpitts oscillator arrangement that was 
developed based on an equivalent circuit model. Electrical 
characteristics of the fabricated SAWR show good agreement 
with its equivalent device model at the resonant frequencies, 
and it was found to have good stability and sensitivity with a 
Q-factor in air of about 2,870 at its fundamental resonant 
frequency. The sensor system is designed to operate in a dual 
configuration in which one resonator is coated with a gas-
sensitive polymer (polyethylene) coating, whilst the second one 
is used as a reference channel; thereby eliminating common 
mode interferences on the baseline signal. Mass sensitivity was 
found to be ca. 1 Hz/ng, which corresponds to sub-ppm 
sensitivity to gas/odour concentration.

INTRODUCTION  
Both bulk acoustic and surface acoustic wave (SAW) based 
sensor systems have been reported in chemical sensing 
applications over the past few decades [1–4]. Due to their 
high sensitivity and simple drive/readout circuitry, more 
recent focus has been on surface acoustic wave based 
devices where a SAW device forms the frequency selective 
component within an oscillator circuit. Polymer-coated 
SAW based chemical sensors impart high sensitivity and 
selectivity to specific volatile compounds. The absorption of 
the ligand molecule onto the polymer changes the 
physicochemical and electrical behavior of the SAW device 
resulting in a change in its oscillation frequency.  
Common methods to implement SAW oscillator circuits 
are typically based on  the feedback loop method or the 
negative resistance method [5], [6]. The frequency stability 
and vapor sensitivity of the SAW sensor system directly 
depends on the type of the employed oscillator circuit. 
Nimal et al. [7] have recently reported that one-port Colpitts 
oscillators are more sensitive, but less stable, than two-port 
Pierce oscillators. The sensitivity can also be improved by 
tuning the phase point set within the SAWR in the pass 
band thereby reducing the noise performance of the 
oscillator circuit [8].  
In this study, we present one-port polymer-coated 
Rayleigh wave based SAW resonators, fabricated on an ST-
cut quartz wafer, for application in low-cost chemical 
sensors. An investigation into different equivalent circuit 
models is also presented, which lead to the conclusion that 
the most suitable oscillator circuit for one-port SAWR 
sensors is a Colpitts oscillator configuration.  
II. 
ONE PORT SAW RESONATOR  
SAW resonators are commonly available as one-port and 
two-port devices employing either delay line or resonator 
conﬁgurations. Because of the potential for high Q-value, 
low noise level and higher stability, we have selected a one-
port resonator structure. These resonators are designed to 
operate at a baseline frequency of 262 MHz in a dual 
configuration to obtain differential measurements (Fig. 1).   
The design and modeling of surface acoustic devices are 
normally carried out using the well-established Coupling of 
Modes (COM) theory [9], [10]. Although a COM model 
allows for an accurate description of the SAW resonator by 
simulating the admittance behaviour, the formulas are 
somewhat cumbersome and are not very informative - as far 
as circuit analysis and simulation is concerned. In addition, 
the accuracy of this model is limited to a narrow frequency 
band around the resonance region. Hence, the COM theory 
must assume near-resonance frequencies in order to derive 
a simplified electrical model of the SAW resonator [11].  
The Butterworth Van Dyke (BVD) model, as a simple 
electrical equivalent circuit model, is more suitable for 
circuit designers. Morgan [12] established that the electrical 
acoustic impedance behavior of a SAW device, obtained 
using a lumped-element equivalent circuit model, is in good 
agreement with conventional COM analysis. This equivalent 
circuit model conveniently relates the acoustic perturbations 
due to surface mass loading in a SAW device to its electrical 
behavior.  
A BVD model [11] was developed for the  262 MHz one-
port SAWR, shown in Fig. 2., allowing quick simulation 
and design of the associated oscillator circuitry. The 
motional and static arm parameters were extracted using the 
transmission parameters of the SAWR. As shown in Fig. 2, 
the electrical components R, L and C are the motional 
inductance, capacitance and resistance respectively, which 
form the motional arm producing the resonant frequency 
while the capacitor Co forms the static arm providing the 
anti-resonant frequency. The motional arm signifies the 
electro-acoustic properties [13] of the piezoelectric material 
and it models the vibration of the crystal. R represents the

acoustic attenuation in the resonator and capacitance Co the 
capacitance of the piezoelectric crystal. 
 
 
 
The designed 1-port SAWR comprises 60.25 finger 
pairs with 3 µm finger width forming the inter-digitated-
transducer (IDT), and 500 reflectors on each side to create a 
standing wave pattern with an overall die size of 7.4 mm × 
2.4 mm. The dual resonator configuration [14] with a 
reference channel eliminates common mode interferences 
on the baseline signal, such as changes in ambient 
temperature or pressure. The SAWRs were fabricated on an 
ST-cut quartz substrate with aluminum IDTs using UV 
lithography (PacTech, Germany). 
  
 
In addition to the fundamental mode of operation, the 
SAWR exhibits several overtone frequencies, which can be 
modelled by adding additional series-resonant branches to 
the BVD model. For operation around a certain resonant 
frequency, the crystal can be modelled by the circuit with a 
single motional arm. The impedance of this modelled circuit 
is given by [15]:

as expected between the series and parallel resonant 
frequencies. The phase curve in Fig. 3 also shows that the 
Barkhausen criterion of 0° phase condition for oscillation is 
satisfied at the center frequency of the SAWR. 
III. 
COLPITTS OSCILLATOR DESIGN 
Several similar transistor-based circuit configurations are 
available for the realisation of SAW oscillators, such as 
Pierce, Colpitts, and Clapp, with the main difference lying 
in the transistor grounding options. The performance of the 
three configurations varies with the difference in the 
position of the biasing resistors and capacitances. The most 
desirable option is the Pierce configuration due to its 
simplicity, robustness and ability to work at higher 
frequencies (> 500 MHz) because it is arguably the least 
affected by stray capacitances [15]. However, the Pierce 
oscillator can only work with a two-port SAW resonator 
within a feedback loop to attain the required 180° phase 
shift. 
The Colpitts oscillator, however, allows the SAWR to 
operate in a 1-port configuration [7], and therefore was 
selected for this work. The schematic of the Colpitts SAW 
oscillator circuit with a grounded base configuration, where 
the SAWR input is connected to the transistor’s base and the 
output port is connected to the ground, is shown in Fig. 4. 
   
  
 
 
The Colpitts oscillator offers good stability at higher 
frequencies, lower harmonics, lower component count and 
hence lower cost than other types including feedback-based 
oscillator. The transition frequency of the transistor, fT , 
limits its frequency of operation, when the capacitors 
needed for obtaining the oscillation frequency are 
comparable to the transistor’s terminal capacitances. This 
may be avoided by using a high fT value (a few gigahertz) 
BJT in the oscillator circuit or by using the crystal in a 
series resonance configuration [15]. The use of RF transistor 
(BFR92P, Infineon) rather than an operational amplifier also 
reduces parasitic capacitances allowing radio frequency 
(RF) oscillator operation. To obtain the tuned oscillation 
frequency close to the SAWR Q-factor, tight tolerance 
components were selected for the capacitor and the inductor 
values. 
In this configuration, the resonator shows an inductive 
behavior between the series (fs) and parallel resonances (fp). 
The transistor along with the feedback capacitors C1 and C2 
provides the negative resistance to compensate for resistive 
losses in the resonator. The major limitation of such an 
oscillator circuit is that the parasitic capacitances begin to 
affect the effective operation of the circuit at frequencies 
above 500 MHz. 
IV. 
CHEMICAL DETECTION SYSTEM SETUP 
A robust, high-sensitivity chemical detection system based 
on polymer-coated one port SAW sensor has been designed 
and implemented. The SAW oscillator has been realized by 
interfacing the dual SAW resonators to Colpitts oscillator 
circuitry. A two layered Printed Circuit Board (PCB) has 
been designed using Altium Designer software. Figure 5 
shows the photograph of the dual Colpitts SAW oscillator 
based chemical sensor system. The PCB ensures minimal 
cross-talk associated with high frequency signals. The phase 
shifts linked with the RF signal paths to the resonators have 
also been taken into account during the PCB design.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
The 
experimental 
arrangement 
demonstrating 
chemical detection using SAWR oscillator consists of a 
14×14×40 cm3 gas/odor chamber (photograph of the setup is 
shown in Fig. 6) to which a neMESYS multi-channel 
syringe pump (Cetoni GmbH, Germany) is attached. The 
microliter precision syringe delivers the chemicals into the 
chamber via capillary lines, where it gets vaporised. The

sensor forms the reference channel are attached to the far 
end of the chamber. A commercial FQ4 interface instrument 
(JLM Innovation, Tubingen, Germany) was connected to the 
oscillator output for frequency measurement. The oscillation 
frequencies of the individual sensors were monitored to 
obtain the SAWR differential signal.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Figure 7 shows the oscillator’s resonant frequency output 
obtained 
by 
an 
RF 
oscilloscope 
(LeCroy 
LT342 
Waverunner). The measured frequency value is in good 
agreement with the theoretically modeled value. The load 
sensitivity is significantly less for this oscillator circuit. The 
output of the SAWR oscillator is practically noise and 
distortion free.  
 
 
The typical frequency shifts of a dual SAWR sensor after 
the detection of a volatile chemical compound (here an 
insect sex pheromone) shows that the one-port SAW 
oscillator provides a highly-sensitive system for chemical 
detection. The response has a low level of noise as shown in 
Fig. 8. On the introduction of 10 µl of the insect pheromone 
Z9-14:OAc into the odor chamber, a differential frequency 
shift of about 6 kHz was measured at the SAW output, 
which shows that the average sensor response to the 
pheromone compound is about 0.6 Hz/nl of liquid, i.e., sub-
ppm levels of phermone in air.  
The response time of the system is relatively slow (~100 
s) and it is associated with the evaporation and diffusion of 
the volatile compound inside the chamber. However, the 
actual response time of the SAWR itself is below one 
second. 
  
 
 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION  
A high frequency one-port Colpitts SAWR oscillator has 
been designed and fabricated for application in a low-cost, 
low-power gas sensor. An equivalent model has been 
developed, which formed the basis of an oscillator circuit 
design for a highly sensitive chemical sensor. The SAWR 
exhibits a high quality factor of 2,870 and has an estimated 
0.5 Hz/ng mass sensitivity after coating with a thin gas 
sensitive non-conducting polymer film.  
Further studies are being carried out on the detection of 
specific blends (i.e. mixtures) of chemical compounds. In 
addition, technological developments of this work include 
the creation of a smart low-cost, low-power chemical sensor 
on a chip - by the integration of the SAWR sensor with full 
custom CMOS oscillator circuitry thus resulting in an 
application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) BioMEMS 
chip.
