Abstract— Magnetic non-destructive testing is limited to 
surface inspection, however demand for the detection of 
deep defects is increasing. Therefore, we developed a 
magnetic flux leakage (MFL) system using a tunnel 
magnetoresistive (TMR) device that has high sensitivity 
and wide frequency range in order to detect deep defects. 
Using the developed system, back-side pits of steel plates 
having different depth and diameter were measured and 
2D images were created. Moreover, we analyzed the 
detected vector signal with optimized phase data. As a 
result, the developed MFL system can detect a defect 
that has a wall thinning rate of more than 56 % of 8.6 
mm thick steel plates.  Furthermore, the defect’s 
diameter size was estimated by spatial signal change.

 INTRODUCTION  
Accidents due to defects in steel structures such as power 
plants or pipe line cause serious injuries to humans and harm 
to the natural environment. Therefore, it is important to use 
non-destructive testing for detecting defects at an early stage. 
In many cases, it is difficult to find defects in the interior or 
on the back side, and thus a detection method for deep 
defects is desired. There are many non-destructive testing 
methods such as radiographic testing [1], ultrasonic testing 
[2], magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing [3]-[9], and eddy 
current testing (ECT) [10]. Among them, MFL is commonly 
used for ferromagnetic material such as steel and it is a 
method for detecting flux with bypass defects due to 
differences in permeability and leakage from the sample’s 
surface when an external field is applied to the sample.  
MFL for deep defects needs to be operated at low 
frequency because the penetration of the applied external 
field becomes deeper with decreasing frequency. However, 
the conventional MFL method, which uses a detection coil as 
a magnetic sensor, cannot be operated at low frequency 
because it has low sensitivity at low frequency due to 
Faraday’s law of induction. Therefore, it can detect only 
surface defects near the detection coil. Moreover, the 
detection of deep defects also requires a high magnetic 
resolution because the change of flux generated by the deep 
defect is very small. The other problem of MFL is that the 
magnetic field intensity of MFL needs to be operated at the 
saturation region of the B-H curve in order to obtain 
measurable large magnetic flux leakage. However, a 
measurement system that gives such large magnetic field 
intensity is costly because a high power current source is 
necessary. One way to solve these problems is to use a high 
sensitivity magnetic sensor that can detect a low magnetic 
intensity field at low frequency such as a magnetoresistive 
(MR) sensor. If such a sensor were installed, we could 
operate MFL at extra low frequency, which would give deep 
skin depth and detect small magnetic flux leakage caused by 
a low power source. We reported a MFL system using an 
anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) sensor [11].  Recently, 
the tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) sensor has progressed 
because it has a larger MR ratio than other MR devices with 
a wide frequency range.  
In this study, we developed the MFL system using a 
TMR device having high sensitivity at extreme-low 
frequency in order to enable us to detect defects deeper and 
more clearly than the AMR sensor and other magnetic 
sensors. Moreover, we investigated the performance of the 
developed system using samples having various back-side 
pits. 
II. 
TMR DEVICE 
A TMR device is a kind of MR device and is usually applied 
in the magnetic head of a hard disk. It has a larger MR ratio 
than other MR devices. A common TMR device shows a 
step response to magnetic fields and has hysteresis. The 
TMR device used in this study was designed for sensor 
application [12]-[14]. 
It was 
annealed at 
different 
temperatures and directions two times in order to make easy 
directions of the pin layer and the free layer orthogonal. In 
this structure, the output is linear with respect to the 
magnetic field. In addition, it has a large MR ratio because of 
magnetic coupling of the free layer and the soft magnetic 
material layer. Figure 1 shows the TMR resistance as a 
function of an applied field. The range from -400 T to

EXPERIMENTAL 
The developed MFL system (Figure 2) consists of a 
sensor probe with a TMR device, a lock-in amplifier, a 
current source, an oscillator, two excitation coils, a half 
shaped ferrite yoke, a sample stage, and a PC. Two 
excitation coils with 30 turns were connected to both ends of 
the yoke and an AC field was induced in the sample between 
both ends. The sensor probe was installed between the ends 
of the yoke and they were 1 mm away from the sample’s 
surface. The TMR device measured magnetic flux leakage 
bypassing defects. In this study, the TMR device had 
sensitivity to the direction parallel to both ends of the yoke in 
order to obtain a larger output [11]. The excitation coils were 
operated by a sine wave of 1.2 App and 5 Hz or 10 Hz from 
the current source controlled by the oscillator. The effect of 
the eddy current can be ignored in such an extreme-low 
frequency field. The output signal from the TMR device was 
detected by the lock-in amplifier, which is synchronized with 
the current source in order to obtain a high signal-to-noise 
ratio.  
The signal from the lock-in amplifier contains the signal 
intensity R and the phase θ. In this measurement system, 
magnetic flux leakage is very small so that it is strongly 
affected by the phase shift of the entire measurement system. 
Therefore, we calculated the imaginary part of the signal 
intensity with the common phase φ [11].

R’ = R sin(θ+φ )
Here, φ is a common phase adjusting the phase shift of 
the entire measurement system.  
The samples used in this study were two steel plates 
(SPHC) with four back-side pits as shown in Figure 3. Both 
samples were 8.6 mm thick. The pits of Sample (a) are of the 
same diameter (6 mm) and different wall thinning rates (23, 
57, 70, 93 %). Sample (b) has the same wall thinning rate 
(70 %) and different diameters (4, 6, 8. 10 mm). Multipoint 
measurement was carried out in the range of 20 mm × 20 
mm around a pit from front surface with an interval of 1 mm 
for 21 × 21 steps as shown in Figure4.

We investigated the common phase φ in this 
measurement system. The measurement was carried out 
around a pit that has a wall thinning rate of 70% and a 
diameter of 4 mm. The excitation coils were operated by sine 
wave of 1.2 App and 10 Hz or 5 Hz from the current source. 
The measurement results show as contour maps of calculated 
intensity (mV) with different common phases. 
Figure 5 shows magnetic images with a frequency of 10 
Hz and different common phases and Figure 6 shows that 
with 5 Hz and different common phases. Magnetic images 
with a common phase φ of 130 ° show the emphasis of the 
intensity change due to the pit in the center of the scanning 
range. The magnetic image with a frequency of 5 Hz shows 
the presence of the back-side pit more clearly than that of 10 
Hz because the skin depth becomes deeper with decreasing 
frequency. Therefore, the frequency was 5 Hz and the 
optimized common phase φ was 130 ° for the measurement 
system.   
Figure 7 shows the power spectrum of the developed 
system when the magnetic field was not applied and the sine 
field was applied at 100 T and 5 Hz in the unshielded 
environment. The sensitivity at 5 Hz of the developed system 
is 2.44 mV/T. We estimated the magnetic noise without an 
applied field that corresponds to the minimum magnetic field 
resolution at 5 Hz. As a result, the magnetic field resolution 
was 1.08 nT.

To evaluate the performance of the developed MFL 
system, we analyzed the magnetic image change of a steel 
plate having different pit wall thinning rates and diameters 
under optimum conditions. The excitation coils were 
operated by a sine wave of 5 Hz and 1.2 App from the current 
source. We calculated the signal vector with the optimized 
phase φ = 130°. The aforementioned Sample (a) and Sample 
(b) were measured and we made contour maps of the 
calculated signal vector.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
First, we used Sample (a) and investigated the change of 
magnetic images of the steel plates with different wall 
thinning rates. The map showed the existence of the pit and it 
becomes clear with increasing the actual pit’s wall thinning 
rate (Figure 8). However, the magnetic image of a pit that 
has a wall thinning rate of 23 % is unclear. This was caused 
by the weak magnetic flux leakage from the small thinning 
rate of the wall. The detection limit was a thinning rate of

57 % corresponding to a wall thickness of 4.6 mm. Next, we 
used Sample (b) and investigated the changes of the 
magnetic images by changing the diameter (Figure 9).  
Apparent differences were observed in each figure. The 
contour map change became large according to the 
increment of the diameter. 
Moreover, we quantitatively evaluated the magnetic field 
intensity change and examined the relationship of the 
defect’s characteristics and the calculated intensity. The 
center line of the contour of the magnetic image was 
extracted as shown in Figure 10 and ΔB was defined as the 
value obtained by subtracting the minimum value from the 
maximum value as shown in Figure 10. Figure 11 shows the 
relationship of ΔB and the wall thinning rate and Figure 12 
shows that of ΔB and the diameter.  ΔB was increased with 
the increment of the wall thinning rate and the diameter. 
Therefore, we can estimate the defect’s characteristics using 
the magnetic image and ΔB.

CONCLUSIONS 
We developed a magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing 
system using TMR for back-side defects. Analysis using the 
signal vector with optimized phase was effective for 
magnetic imaging of the back-side pits. The magnetic images 
reflected the actual defect’s characteristics and were able to 
detect more than the wall thinning rate of 57%.  The 
developed MFL system does not require a high power 
current source so that this measurement system is expected 
to be applicable to field testing.
