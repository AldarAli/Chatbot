Abstract—A sensor network is composed of nodes which col-
laborate in a common task. These nodes have certain sensory
capabilities and wireless communication that allow forming ad-
hoc networks, i.e., no pre-established physical structure or central
administration is necessary. Therefore, one of the main problems
with ad-hoc systems is that there is no existing infrastructure, so
the routes change dynamically. This is due to fading, interference,
disconnection of nodes, obstacles, node movements, and so on.
We expose an analysis of the Multi-Parent Hierarchical (MPH)
routing protocol for wireless sensor networks, which has low
overhead, reduced latency and low energy consumption. Network
performance simulations of the MPH routing protocol are carried
out and compared with two popular protocols, Ad-hoc On-
Demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing
(DSR) and the well-known algorithm Zigbee Tree Routing
(ZTR). The combination of a hierarchical topology with self-
conﬁguration and maintenance mechanisms of the MPH protocol
makes nodes optimize network processes, reduce delays, take
short routes to the destination and decrease network overhead.
All this is reﬂected in the successful delivery of information.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are based on low-
cost devices (nodes) that are able to get information from
their environment, process it locally, and communicate via
wireless links to a central coordinator node. Additionally, the
coordinator node might also send control commands to the
nodes [1]. WSNs may not rely on a predetermined structure
and require the capacity of self-organization in order to deal
with communications impairments, mobility and node failures.
Moreover, it is important to study the scalability and adaptation
methods of the network in the face of topology changes and
packet transmission failures in the wireless medium.
In this work, scenarios of wireless sensor networks are
proposed under different conﬁgurations of topology arrays.
The aim is to contrast the performance of the sensor network
under three widely known protocols in the literature: AODV
[2], DSR [3] and MPH [4]. The latter was designed and
implemented by the same authors of this work in the reference
cited in [4]. In this study, AODV, DSR, ZTR [5] and MPH are
compared based on various efﬁciency metrics and how they
optimize routing protocols through energy. There are several
schemes to ﬁnd the best routes in the shortest possible time.
In terms of hierarchy algorithms, such as ZTR, it has a simple
and fast routing, which reduces overload in the network, is
reliable and has a distributed addressing scheme that does not
require nodes to have routing tables. Results from our work
show that for the single sink scenario, the MPH protocol has
an energy saving of 35% against AODV and DSR protocols
and 8% compared with ZTR. MPH has 27% less overhead
compared with AODV and DSR. Moreover, MPH presents a
10% increase in packet delivery compared with AODV, DSR
and ZTR.
We describe the organization of the rest of the paper.
Section 2 introduces the related work on the wireless sensor
network problem to an IoT approach. Section 3 proposes
the analysis of performance metrics. Section 4 describes and
explains the analysis of performance metrics under a grid
topology. Furthermore, Section 5 presents the results. Section 6
has the study of sensors as base of Internet of Things. Finally,
conclusions are given in Section 7.

RELATED WORK
Due to technological advancements, the Internet is being
used to share data among different small, resource-constrained
devices connected in number of billions to constitute the
Internet of Things (IoT). A large amount of data from these
devices imposes overhead on the IoT network. Hence, it is
required to provide solutions for various network related prob-
lems in IoT including routing, energy conservation, congestion,
heterogeneity, scalability, reliability, quality of service (QoS)
and security to optimally make use of the available network.
One of the most efﬁcient topologies in information delivery
is the hierarchical topology [6]. The hierarchy levels allow
packet forwarding with the least number of hops, which causes
fewer errors in delivery and lower delays in the transmission
of a packet from source to destination. Hierarchical proto-
cols have scalability and robustness characteristics, providing
energy savings in the network and distributing energy costs
among network sensors. A great advantage of such protocols
is that they carry information generally to one node, thus the
communication with the coordinator or root node is simpler
and more efﬁcient [7]. Tree Routing is a classic form of
routing that is restricted to parent-child links. This scheme
eliminates the need for searching and updating paths and the
overhead associated with the establishment of those paths.
However, when the networks are large and the nodes can
connect and disconnect from the network due to link changing
conditions, it is helpful for the Tree Routing scheme to be able
to change slightly, offering more ﬂexibility in assigning IP

addresses to the network in order to become self-organized
because it is performed using fewer links. In addition, the
hierarchical protocols have simple routing algorithms that
guarantee efﬁcient delivery of information and increase the
lifetime of the network.
A reliable routing protocol in WSNs is essential due to
the versatility of these networks. In [8], the authors analyze
metrics such as end-to-end path reliability and number of
hops. Their work analyzes different routing algorithms based
on link reliability models for each type of node. In [9], a
routing protocol that guarantees the route with the shortest
path while maintaining Quality of Service is designed. The
route optimization is related to the ideal relay node position
and metrics such as mean end-to-end delay and packet rate
under random scenarios are considered [10]. The inﬂuence
of packet retransmissions in communication and its effects
on energy efﬁciency in the network are analyzed. Some of
the most adaptable protocols for this type of networks are
AODV and DSR, which are aimed at reducing cost and energy
consumption and improving reliability. These protocols allow
multi-hopping among the actively involved nodes that want to
establish and maintain routes in a network [11]. On the other
hand, ZTR, a widely referenced algorithm, has low overhead
and is simple with regard to the memory capacity of the nodes
since they do not have routing tables, which eliminates path
searching and updating. Nevertheless, it has some drawbacks
in terms of ﬂexibility and adaptation, especially when it is
deployed in wide network environments [5].

PERFORMANCE METRICS
Metrics of the network layer are very important because
they show the performance and usefulness of a routing proto-
col. Each routing protocol is designed for speciﬁc applications
and certain scenarios. These metrics indicate how the use of
bandwidth is affected by the overhead of the routing protocol
in use. In addition, the availability of effective routes and the
ability of the network for self-conﬁguration show the capacity
of the protocol to recover from topology changes. Recovery
times have an impact on the latency in the network and even
though the networks conform with different technologies, it is
highly important to understand and evaluate the performance
metrics as shown in [12].
A. Optimization of Routes
An important feature in a sensor network is when nodes
lose established routes due to mobility or changes in the
topology. It is necessary to have a protocol that can ﬁnd
optimal routes and can adapt to network changes. Applications
of sensor networks were used by such and such authors to
conduct a study about Energy Optimal Routing algorithm
in [13] for mining and tunneling approaches, which is very
signiﬁcant in energy savings in sensors due to their long time
period in harsh environments unsuitable for constant human
access. This algorithm builds routes based on transmission
distance and search optimization. Moreover, it employs energy
balancing strategy. In [14] Nezhad et al. proposed a Desti-
nation Controlled Anonymous Routing Protocol for Sensor-
nets routing protocol for high trafﬁc sensor networks. In this
work, the authors propose a collector node capable of having
a global view of the whole network topology representing
a higher level of hierarchy than the other nodes. In [15],
Nasser et al. proposed the Secure and Energy-Efﬁcient multi-
path Routing protocol that combines multi-path technique for
communication among nodes, as well as safety techniques with
respect to malicious attacks to a destination. This protocol
is proposed for an environment of static nodes. It stores
information in the node routing tables with the routes to a
collector node as a ﬁnal destination. This contributes to a new
proposal for the establishment and maintenance of routes.
B. Routing Protocols in WSNs
In communication networks, there are routing protocols
classiﬁed into two groups: proactive routing protocols and
reactive routing protocols. When nodes are under a reactive
protocol, they ask for a route only when it is needed. This in-
volves high latency for the ﬁrst packet and some independence
among routes. The AODV routing protocol is based on routing
efﬁciency of wireless ad-hoc networks with a huge number of
nodes and it uses a route discovery mechanism in broadcast
mode. It is considered as a reactive protocol: the routes are
created only when they are needed, on demand. AODV can
transmit in unicast or multicast mode. It uses the bandwidth
efﬁciently and responds to the network changes in a very quick
mode, preventing network loops [2]. In fact, AODV maintains
time-based states in the routing tables of each node. An entry
in the routing table expires if it has not been used recently. The
timer function is designed to avoid the use of links which the
node does not have an updated status from a long time ago.
Some advantages of AODV include more reliability and less
cost in bandwidth. However, there are some disadvantages,
as follows: more complexity and computing, more cost in
memory, and this protocol was designed to work in a network
where there are no malicious nodes. In conclusion, it is not a
secure protocol.
The DSR protocol is a reactive protocol. It routes from
source node including a header in the packets. It indicates what
nodes will be crossed to arrive at a destination because the ori-
gin node is responsible for calculating the complete path to the
destination node. This process is called Source Routing. Each
node in the network has a cache memory which stores all of
the obtained routes throughout discovery processes, this could
be from the source node or learned from the network. If there
is no current route to a speciﬁc destination, the node begins a
Route Discovery. The route table or route cache is constantly
monitored to detect broken or invalid routes, in order to repair
them, when the network topology has changed. This process
is called Route Maintenance. DSR protocol presents some
advantages; for instance, a node can obtain multiple paths to
a speciﬁc destination by only requesting for a route. Also, it
allows the network to be entirely self-conﬁguring without a
particular architecture or topology. Additionally, it is a good
election in scenarios where the number of mobile nodes is
limited. Furthermore, the protocol adapts itself quickly to
routing changes when a node is frequently moving, and ﬁnally,
this protocol decreases the overhead in the network.
ZTR is a simple protocol which establishes parent-child
links and the nodes always carry information to their parent. It
has a tree topology and is easy to implement. ZigBee requires
that there is at least one full-function device with a more
robust nature to act as a network coordinator, but the ﬁnal
nodes can have reduced function in order to reduce costs. The
parent node is the one which has given the child access to the

network, so parent-child links are created, but each child can
only have one parent. Some of the advantages of ZTR are that
in the algorithm implemented in the network layer, there is a
balance between cost per unit, battery expense, complexity of
implementation to achieve a proper cost-performance relation
to the application.
MPH creates a hierarchical network logical topology where
the hierarchy of the nodes is given by its location level, which
is proactive. It works like a hierarchical tree: nodes establish
parent and child links that constitute the possible routes. Node
hierarchies are used to establish links between parents and
children based on the coverage radius that depends on the
transmission power. As a result, a node can share both the
children and the parents with another node belonging to the
same hierarchical level, which allows more links, but does
not generate unnecessary routes, and continues to express
speed thanks to the hierarchical topology. This protocol takes
advantage of the controlled maintenance of routes of the
proactive nature, but combines the agility that allows to have
more than one route for a node. This makes it more versatile
and adaptable to different topologies.

ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE METRICS UNDER A
GRID TOPOLOGY
WSNs consist of a number of spatially distributed au-
tonomous devices using sensors to monitor physical or en-
vironmental conditions. They are multi-functional, low-cost
and low-power networks, and rely on communications among
nodes or from sensor nodes to one or more sink nodes. Sink
nodes, sometimes called coordinator nodes or root nodes,
may be more robust and have larger processing capacity than
the other nodes. Sensor networks can be widely used in
various environments, sometimes hostile. Some of the many
applications of WSNs are in the medical ﬁeld, agriculture,
monitoring and detection, automation and data mining.
The most notable issues regarding WSNs are the difﬁculty
in transmitting information in a wireless environment as well
as the energy costs implied. When the signal suffers from
physical obstacles, channel occupancy, interference and gen-
eral fading with other devices, it promotes the use of high
energy consuming mechanisms to send and receive packets
successfully. These networks have limited resources because of
the cost and size of the devices. The sensors are small in order
to be adaptable to all kinds of environments and able to be
installed in various conditions, locations, and infrastructures.
This also causes the batteries to be small and short-lived; thus
creating the need to save energy in all processes of the network.
We take into account performance metrics that directly or
indirectly inﬂuence the energy consumption of a network. The
delay may be an indication that packets are not directed on the
optimal path, which shows an increase in the number of hops
to reach the ﬁnal destination. When routes are not optimal
this brings more energy consumption. When the number of
retransmissions is high this may be a consequence of the large
number of collisions that are in the channel, and nodes can
be strained to bring the information to its destination. The
connections and disconnections of nodes make the network
topology change constantly. This is why the implemented
routing protocol must be able to respond quickly and efﬁciently
to these failures. The availability of routes is a parameter
showing the capacity of the routing protocol to maintain
current valid routes due to the fact that nodes are constantly
asking for routes, increasing the overhead.

RESULTS
In this section, we compare the performance of the MPH
protocol with that of commonly used protocols in sensor
networks, such as AODV, DSR and the well-known algorithm,
ZTR. We consider the following important metrics that are
indicative of network performance and they are tested under
the topology described in Figure 1.

1) Delay: The time a packet takes to reach its destination is
variable due to several factors, for instance: the transmission
speed, the packet size and the delay of the packet in each
hop in the route. Collisions and packet retransmissions also
increase the end-to-end delay. The delay is related to the
network complexity. The MPH protocol, through the election
of a hierarchical topology, produces a reduction of the delays
in the information delivery process.
It is important to consider the delay involved in reorganiz-
ing the network due to changes in connectivity, for example,
due to new nodes or nodes that switch off or are faulty. Table
II shows relevant delays obtained in the simulations of the

MPH protocol compared with AODV, DSR, and ZTR. The
ﬁrst row shows the time required to complete the process of
table maintenance performed by a neighbor node. With this
process, each node builds its neighbor table. The second row
describes the time it takes a packet to travel from the farthest
node to the coordinator (these are the nodes of the last ring
shown in Figure 1). In the third row, we obtained the time it
takes a packet from the nearest ring in Figure 1 (one hop) to
get to its destination, for each of the protocols. In the fourth,
ﬁfth, sixth, seventh and eighth rows, we randomly turned
off 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% of the network nodes,
respectively. We observed how long it takes a packet to reach
the coordinator node from the farthest node in the topology.
In the ninth row, we deﬁne the recovery time for the worst
case (50% nodes turned off). This metric takes into account
the self-conﬁguring time of the network due to the dynamics
of the wireless scenario, such as node disconnections. This is
where we see the ability of each routing protocol to overcome
topology changes and reorganize the network.
2) Energy consumption: The energy model implemented
for the three protocols studied is presented in Table III. When
MPH is used, nodes store neighbor tables, and routing is done
via the optimal route. Therefore, this protocol provides large
energy savings thanks to multi-parent routes. This can be seen
in Figure 2a, where we observe that AODV and DSR use
more total energy than MPH because they require more routing
overhead, which causes more collisions and retransmissions.
ZTR does not carry out a discovery mechanism but it has
less available links and does not guarantee that those are the
shortest routes, so, sometimes it needs more hops.
3) Overhead: Reactive protocols such as AODV and DSR
have low overhead because routes are discovered only when
they are needed. However, MPH and ZTR use fewer control
packets, thus nodes have low processing and simple manage-
ment of neighbor tables. Therefore, MPH maintains neighbor
tables with fewer control packets. ZTR does not need to
maintain any table. This behavior can be seen in Figure 2b.

analyzed the percentage of delivered packets for AODV, DSR,
ZTR and MPH. The value that this metric takes is a con-
sequence of the ability of a routing protocol to reorganize
the network. Besides, if the number of hops the packets pass
through is smaller, there will be fewer errors in the information
delivery. Results are depicted in Figure 2c.

SENSORS AS BASE OF INTERNET OF THINGS
Internet of Things (IoT) [17] ] allows the possibility of
digital interaction among objects, through the Internet, without
the intervention of human beings. Thanks to wireless systems,
it is possible to integrate a chip of a few millimeters in any
object in the home, work or city to process and transmit
information from it constantly. One of the biggest challenges of
IoT is to have real-time data that are visible to extract valuable
information. The goal is to have accurate information to make
better decisions by discovering which data is essential through
intelligent ﬁltering. In addition, it allows understanding the
signals within the data. Thus, organizations can extract and
analyze data through the connected IoT ecosystem [18].
Internet of Things is precisely one of the leading areas
where sensors have a fundamental role since they are the
instruments capable of gathering weather, trafﬁc, electricity,
gas and water data and combine it with real-time images to
understand how a neighborhood behaves. In other words, the
sensors are aware of all the digital pulses in each activity in a
city.
1) Availability of routes: Reliable or valid routes are the
routes that are active and can be used by nodes to send packets.
These routes may expire (according to the routing protocol)
or may disappear from the tables due to disconnections of
neighbor nodes. The most reliable routes will ensure more
reliable delivery of information.
We turned off a certain percentage of network nodes to
observe nodes disconnections. In this way, we could see
how some routes become invalid and how nodes respond to
reconﬁgure valid routes in the network, depending on the
protocol. The percentage of reliable routes is presented in
Figure 3.

these become safer as well as more reliable, compared with
AODV, DSR, and ZTR. This is so because in AODV routes
have timers that expire after a certain period. On the other
hand, DSR is aware that a route is obsolete only when it
receives a route error message. ZTR does not have tables, so
each time it needs to form the whole topology.
In Table IV, we took a sampling period of 100 seconds.
We made tests every 10 seconds in which we compute the
average number of valid routes available in case the node has
to send a trafﬁc packet right at this moment. In the AODV
and DSR cases, occasionally some routes have just expired
or some node in the route has been disconnected: these cases
will result in invalid routes. In the ZTR case, sometimes, there
is no route available to send the packet. On the other hand,
when the MPH protocol is implemented, almost all the time
the neighbor tables have valid routes ready to be used.
With regard to diversity of routes and hop count, we present
Table V. The MPH protocol gets routes with a minimum

number of hops but it has fewer routes. The advantage of
MPH compared to the AODV and DSR protocols is that MPH
does not require routing tables, the decision of a node to route
a packet to the coordinator is very simple because a node
chooses the most widely used route. In contrast, we see that
AODV and DSR have more routes to the coordinator, but they
do not always guarantee the shortest route. It is true that the
node chooses the shortest route from its routing table but it
may be that this route is not the shortest to the destination.
This effect is due to the packet loss probability. Regarding
ZTR, the route to the destination is unique because it does not
have the multi-parent concept. This means that, if there is any
disconnection of a node (or nodes), the probability of packet
loss is higher, which is a big disadvantage. In this table, the
number that shows the hops is an average number of the nodes
every 10 seconds.
A. Retransmissions and retries
Figure 4 displays the average node retransmissions and the
average CSMA/CA retries for the four studied protocols. Here,
we remark that for the four protocols, initially, there are many
retransmissions and CSMA/CA retries. This is so because,
when the nodes connect to the network they begin by sending
broadcast packets to discover neighbors, so there is a greater
number of packets in the network: overhead and trafﬁc packets
produce more collisions. Note that in the retransmissions,
during the ﬁrst 10 seconds the four protocols increase their
average amount of retransmissions(the line has the highest

peak of the graph). This is because of the amount of packets
ﬂowing in the network during the time of formation of the
topology. The CSMA retries also show this peak because as the
channel is constantly busy, CSMA retries increase. However,
regarding retransmissions, it is important to mention that this
ﬁrst peak has an average value of 2.7 for AODV and DSR, 2.6
for ZTR and 2.5 for MPH. Concerning also the ﬁrst peak, the
CSMA retries metric has an average value of 3.6 for AODV,
3.5 for DSR and ZTR and, 3.3 for MPH.

CONCLUSION
IoT enables physical devices or sensors to measure, per-
form a deﬁned task, use the cloud for storage and to actuate the
alert system automatically in case of an emergency situation
with the aid of Internet as its underlying technology. Thus, IoT
transforms these traditional devices to work in a smart way by
using various deriving technologies such as pervasive comput-
ing, embedded devices, various communication standards and
technologies.
In MPH, the coordinator node can be aware of approxi-
mately the whole topology due to the source routing mecha-
nism. In AODV and DSR, the routes from the coordinator to
some node are calculated the same way as the other routes. So,
MPH has the advantage that the coordinator node can access
any node to send information, statistics or measurements
requests. In comparison with AODV and DSR, the coordinator
has to discover the route to a speciﬁc node if it does not have it,
which is not desirable. Also, MPH protocol has fewer control
packets, therefore less overhead, resulting in fewer collisions,
so there will be fewer packet retransmissions compared with
AODV and DSR. Moreover, this is reﬂected in the energy
saving metric. The ZTR algorithm does not present route
diversity which enhances the probability of losing packets
when there are disconnections of nodes.
The results for MPH protocol are encouraging because this
protocol has good performance in terms of processing, fast
and efﬁcient information delivery and energy conservation.
Protocols such as AODV and DSR are very efﬁcient in terms of
backup routes and connectivity from any node to any node in
the network. ZTR is a simple and low energy cost algorithm,
but it is not very reliable in adverse network conditions or
failure on the links. The combination of a hierarchical topology
with self-conﬁguration and maintenance mechanisms of the
MPH protocol makes the nodes optimize network processes,
reduce delays, take short routes to the destination and decrease
network overhead. All this is reﬂected in the successful de-
livery of information. As future work, this analysis of the
performance of a sensor network should be complemented
by low-power protocols on the Internet of things, such as
6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area
Networks).
