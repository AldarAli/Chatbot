INTRODUCTION
Within the recent decades, an explosion of researches and
developments
referring
to
the
next-generation
communication networks known as 5G New Radio (NR) has
been observed [1]-[5]. Based on 4G Long-Term Evolution
(LTE) progress [6], 5G NR is in principle a novel stage of
unprecedented technological innovation with ubiquitous
speed connectivity. As a result, it is expected that 5G NR
will radically transform a number of industries and will
provide direct, super-speed connections between any users
and any sensors and devices.
At the present time, several reviews to analyze significant
changes in the 5G NR approaches as compared to the
existing 4G LTE networks have been published [7][8]
denoting a series of milestones. Developing this topic, Table
I summarizes the results of the advanced analysis adding the
investigations of the last 5 years.
A review of the current Research and development
(R&Ds) in 5G NR area convincingly demonstrates the
consistent achievement of the milestones indicated in Table
I, which is reflected in a vast number of publications and the
emergence of commercial products. Among them, much
attention is paid to radically expanding the available spectral
bands (see point 1 of the Table I), which is associated with
the absorption of the Millimeter Wavelengths (MMW).
Following
this
tendency,
currently,
the
local
telecommunications commissions of various countries are
proposing and harmonizing the plans of frequency allocation
in MMW-band, which will be reviewed this year at the
World
Radio
Conference
(WRC-2019)
[9].
Another
milestone of great importance is the development of access
networks (see point 3 of the Table I). In this direction, well-
known Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) technology [10]-[12] is
considered as the most promising approach, which is
implemented based on Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) architecture.
TABLE I. THE MILESTONES IN THE WAY TO TRANSFORM 4G LTE TO 5G
No
Designation
Short Description
1
Radically
expanding the
available
spectral bands
Some super-wide bandwidth cases in 5G access
networks
will
require
contiguous
carrier
bandwidths. To support them, additional carrier
frequencies (below 6 GHz), as well as millimeter
wave (mmWave) RF carriers will be required.
2
Increasing
user
densification
The answer is to use small-cell technology (from
macro-cells to femto-cells) that enables carriers to
provide more users with lower latency, better
mobile device battery life, and expanded cellular
coverage
3
Establishing
optimized
access
network
architecture
Following the milestones of the points 1 and 2, it is
necessary
to
optimize
the
access
network
architecture so that at the same time provide high-
quality communication with fixed and mobile users
and low charges for the building and maintenance
of networks. A promising candidate for solving the
problem is a fiber-wireless architecture, already
tested in 4G LTE systems.
4
Providing
More Options
with Fixed
Wireless
Access
Fixed Wireless Access provides users with more
alternatives for connecting to the cloud using
wireless
broadband
data
communication
to
connect two or more fixed locations. In particular,
the introduction of this type of service will be very
feasible
for
the
broad
development
of
telemedicine.
5
Using a
Mobile Phone
as a Hub
A future people life is able to revolve around a
new 5G smartphone. With high-speed mobile
broadband access and truly ubiquitous coverage, it
will enable devices to communicate directly with
each other, without routing the data paths through
a network infrastructure.
6
Using active
antenna
systems in
mm-Wave
communication
Following
the
tendencies
of
expanding
the
available spectral bands and increasing user
densification, mm-Wave 5G wireless network
infrastructure can be erected with a lot of small
cell sites controlled by the corresponding remote
(base) station (RS). In order to avoid inter-
interference
inside
these
cells,
one
of
the
promising approaches is to equip the RS with
beam-steerable
phased
array
antennas
using
hundreds of antenna elements to form directional
beams.
7
Providing
low latency
Mission-critical
services
requiring
very
high
reliability, global coverage, and very low latency,
which may be more important than throughput in
some applications, will become more native to
support 5G infrastructure.

AICT 2019 : The Fifteenth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications

A typical configuration of an RoF-based communication
network including Central Office (CO), set of Base Stations
(BS), and microwave or millimeter-wave band user radio
terminals, have been discussed in detail in numerous
publications (for example, in [10]-[13] and the papers cited
there), so it is not considered in this paper. An important
element of this network architecture is a base station, through
which an interactive fiber-wireless interface is implemented.
Taking part recent studies, we have proposed and previously
investigated two design concepts of cost- and power-efficient
base station for emerging FiWi networks [14][15], in which
for a multi-frequency conversion of a Radio-Frequency (RF)
carrier, an Optical Frequency Comb Generator (OFCG)
based on microwave-photonic technology was used. Namely,
it was designed on a long-wavelength Vertical Cavity
Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) operating in the period
doubling
state
in
the
first case, and
on an
Optical
Recirculation Loop (ORL) technique using two Suppressed
Carrier Single Sideband (SC-SSB) optical modulators in the
second one.
Nevertheless, in the cited papers, as well as in the works
of other authors referred to this direction, there is no analysis
of the efficiency of the OFCG-based actual base station for
emerging
FiWi
networks
that
supports
high-speed
multichannel digital RF-signal transmission. Meeting this
shortcoming, the remainder of the paper is organized as
follows. Section II demonstrates the models and setups for
simulation of a recirculation-loop-based OFCG and fiber to
MMW-band
wireless
interface
using
the
well-known
software tool VPIPhotonics Design Suit [16]. Leveraging the
application of this OFCG for a realistic case, the simulation
results
by
the
same
computer
tool
imitating
multi-
wavelength
optical
frequency
comb
generation
and
transmission of quadrature amplitude modulated RF signals
through OFCG-based fiber-wireless interface of a FiWi-
architected base station are discussed in Section III. Section
IV concludes the paper.
II. DESCRIBING THE MODELS AND SETUPS FOR SIMULATION
A. Optical Frequency Comb Generator
Generally, the outstanding performance of OFCG has led
to a revolution in a lot of radio-engineering fields, from
radio-frequency arbitrary waveform generation to coherent
optical communications. The key R&D achievements in this
direction are summarized in [17]. In the paper, four layouts
of OFCG suitable to achieve a comb with a spectrally flat
envelope are reviewed consisting of cascaded intensity and
phase modulators, dual-drive Mach Zehnder modulator
(another name for the SC-SSB modulator), two-cascaded
phase modulators with linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating,
and three cascaded modulators: two intensity and one phase.
As a result, it was concluded that the ideal optical frequency
comb
must be well conceived to
target a particular
application. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned paper does
not consider the option of OFCG based on an optical
recirculation loop, which has been studied for more than 10
years as a good candidate for designing microwave-
photonics multichannel oscillators and frequency converters
[18][19]. The undoubted advantages of this technique
include simplicity of the scheme, stability, robustness,
tunability, low RF driving voltage, etc. However, its
important disadvantage is the relatively short comb length.
For example, as follows from [18], the output comb of the
device under study consists of only 5-9 teeth, that is, not
enough for a realistic 5G application in MMW-band. The
obvious way to create a multichannel fiber-to-wireless
interface in such environment is to “compact” the comb by
narrowing down the interval between frequency teeth.
Following this concept, Fig. 1 shows the VPI model and
setup for simulation of the OFCG scheme under study. There
are four units depicted in Fig. 1: the composed model of
ORL includes library models of optical X-coupler, SC-SSB
modulator, Optical Amplifier (OA), Optical Band-Pass Filter
(OBPF), as well as library models of Continuous-Wave
Semiconductor Laser (CW-SL) emitting at the frequency ν0
as an optical source, RF Generator (RFG) as a RF signal
source and library instrumental model of Optical Spectrum
Analyzer (OSA). In order to close the ORL, output of OBPF
through the service unit T and input of SC-SSB are
connected to X-coupler's port 'input2' and port 'output2',
correspondingly. During the simulation, RFG acts as a
source of the reference RF signal (fref), while using the OSA,
the output optical spectrum is recorded.
B. Optical-Frequency-Comb-Based Fiber-to-Wireless
Interface
Fig. 2 shows the VPI model and setup for simulation of
OFCG-based fiber to MMW band wireless interface while
transmission of quadrature amplitude modulated RF signals is
supported. The scheme represents the downlink channel of
FiWi-architected RoF system and consists of three units
imitating the operation of CO, BS, and 2-fiber optical cable
between them. The CO includes the same laser model, the
radiation of which is divided into two branches using a Y-
coupler,
library
model
of
SC-SSB
modulator
with
suppressing lower sideband, and library instrumental model
of QAM RF Transmitter. The latter contains library models of
QAM generator and output unit for power control following
by electrical amplifier. This module generates an electrical
M-QAM signal up-converted at a given RF carrier frequency.
The Optical Cable includes two equivalent library models of
single-mode optical fiber. Such a remote optical feed reduces

the cost of the BS. Besides the OFCG model (see Fig. 1), the
BS includes library models of optical amplifier, X-coupler,
photodiode, and electrical post-amplifier outputted to the
model of QAM RF Receiver. The latter detects the RF
signal, decodes an electrical QAM signal and evaluates
quantitatively the Symbol Error Rate (SER) and the Error-
Vector Magnitude (EVM) of the output QAM signal. The

dimensional graphical representation of the data from the

SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS
A.
Reference Data for the Simulation
In this work, the subject of the study is a fiber to MMW-
band wireless interface and the device of the study is an
OFCG based on a SC-SSB optical modulator. A tool for the
computer simulation is the well-known commercial software
VPIPhotonics Design SuitTM. In the course of the research,
first of all, the possibility of creating a multi-frequency
OFCG with the closest arrangement of the teeth is checked.
Then, the transmission quality of a digital RF signal with
multi-position QAM through the downlink channel of the
base station using fiber to MMW-band wireless interface is
analyzed. Two limiting factors are taken into account during
the simulation procedure: fiber chromatic dispersion and RF
channel spacing. Table II lists the common reference data for
the OFCG under study. In addition, Table III lists the
reference data for the fiber to MMW-band wireless interface
under study.

C. Optical-Frequency-Comb-Based Fiber-to-Wireless
Interface
Our further studies were related to EVM analysis
depending on the length of the optical cable and the spacing
between the RF channels in the setup of Fig. 2. The results of
the simulations are presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5,
respectively. For a clear view, there are some insets in Fig. 4
showing
constellation
diagrams
in
specific
points.
In
particular, as one can see from Fig. 4, due to dispersion in
the optical cable, the EVM values increase with a slope of
near 0.17 %/km reaching a standard limit for 64-QAM of 8%
[20] at the distance of 40 km.
Besides, Fig. 5 demonstrates EVM vs RF channel
spacing characteristic at the fiber distance of near 12 km. As
a result, as the co-channel spacing shrinks, the EVM remain
at about 3% until 240 MHz. With a further reduction in the
RF channel spacing, the slope of the EVM curve begins to
increase reaching the standard limit at about 215 MHz.
Figure 4. EVM vs Optical Cable Length.
Figure 5. EVM vs RF Channel Spacing.
The following outputs can be derived from our study:
• When transmitting digital radio signals with 64-QAM
on millimeter-wave RF carriers (37-43.5 GHz), even when
using a single-sideband modulator with a suppressed optical
carrier, dispersion in an optical cable has a significant impact
on the quality of the received signal. However, the error is
within the standard limit up to a distance of 40 km.
• With a fiber-optic link length of up to 12 km, it is
acceptable to shrink the interval between RF channels from
300 to 215 MHz.
IV.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, a detailed analysis of optical-frequency-
comb-based fiber to millimeter-band wireless interface in
actual base station for emerging 5G access networks of fiber-
wireless architecture was carried out using off-the-shelf
computer-aided design tool VPIphotonics Design Suite. The
specific goal of the research was to assess the possibility and
efficiency of creating a downlink channel of a multi-channel
base station using a multi-wavelength optical frequency
comb generator with a close arrangement of optical carriers
based on a cost- and power-efficient optical recirculation
loop including carrier-suppressed single-sideband optical
modulator. Following this goal, firstly a computer model and
a setup for simulation were proposed and described.
Simulation experiment predicts that OFCG including 21
optical carriers with the spacing of 0.3 GHz and the level
non-uniformity of less than 5 dB can be realized. Leveraging
the application of this OFCG for a realistic case, the model
and setup to simulate fiber to millimeter-band RF interface
were proposed and described. The simulation experiment
predicts that the needed transmission quality is supported at a
distance of optical cable between Central Office and Base
Station, which is quite acceptable for an access network. In
the course of another simulation experiment evaluating the
effect of RF co-channel interference, it was shown that the
number of RF channels within the same frequency band
could be increased 1.4 times.
