Abstract—In the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, User Equipments (UEs) have
to measure system information of target cells, if the target cells
are Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) cells. Home evolved NodeB
(HeNB) in the LTE femtocell is CSG cell. Femtocell is one of
promising cellular network technologies to enhance both of cell
coverage and capacity. This paper introduces six measurement
methods of system information in the 3GPP LTE system. And, we
also analyzed performance of the proposed measurement methods
in aspect of service interruption time and measurement delay.
We ﬁnd out that the autonomous and parallel method shows the
smallest measurement delay and the methods which use small
gaps have small service interruption time.

I. INTRODUCTION
In 3rd Generation Partnership Project, Long Term Evolution
release 8 standardization has been ﬁnalized [1]. And also,
release 9 standard is on the ﬁnal step. LTE release 10, in other
words LTE-Advanced is being discussed actively. One of the
key features of LTE/LTE-Advanced system is heterogeneous
deployment. Therefore, femto technology is adopted to expand
cell coverage and enhance cell capacity, in the 3GPP LTE
release 8. HeNB is femtocell eNB of 3GPP LTE network.
HeNBs operate only CSG mode in the release 8. Therefore,
only authorized users can access the CSG HeNBs. In the
LTE release 9, HeNB is extended to be able to operate in
open mode. HeNB can operate in hybrid mode in the LTE-
Advanced standard. Hybrid mode HeNB operates not only as
CSG HeNB, but also as an open HeNB. Therefore, it provides
limited service even though the user who tries to access is not
a member of its CSG.
UE does not need to measure system information from
target cell in general LTE handover procedure [2], [3], [4].
CSG inbound handover technology is essential to support
femto technology in LTE/LTE-Advanced system. And, CSG
inbound handover requires system information measurement
from target HeNBs instead of getting the information from
serving eNB. However, there is not detailed description for it in
the 3GPP technical speciﬁcations. Therefore, we propose four
methods to measure the system information of CSG femtocell
in 3GPP LTE/LTE-advanced system.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II introduces the backgrounds about System Information in
3GPP LTE system. Section III introduces and analyzes System
Information Measurement methods which are proposed in [5]
. Section IV proposes the Autonomous Measurement with
Parallel Small Gaps method. Section V shows the evaluated
performance comparison results and section VI concludes this
paper.
II. SYSTEM INFORMATION IN 3GPP LTE SYSTEM
The System Information is exchanged in a type of System
Information Blocks (SIBs) between eNBs and UEs. SIB
messages are kinds of Radio Resource Control (RRC)
messages [2]. SIB messages include Master Information
Block (MIB), System Information Block Type 1 (SIB1) and
System Information message. MIB message contains essential
information such as downlink bandwidth, Hybrid Automatic
Retransmission Request (HARQ) channel conﬁguration and
System Frame Number (SFN) information. SIB1 message
contains information related to cell selection and scheduling
information of SIB2 - SIB13 [3].
SIBs except SIB1 are not a RRC message but message
elements that are carried by SI message. SIB2 is composed
of conﬁguration information of common and shared channels.
SIB3 contains cell reselection information, mainly related
to the serving cell. SIB4 contains information about the
serving
frequency
and
intra-frequency
neighboring
cells
relevant for cell reselection including common parameters for
a frequency as well as cell speciﬁc reselection parameters.
SIB5 contains information about other Evolved Universal
Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) frequencies and inter-
frequency neighboring cells relevant for cell reselection.
SIB6 contains information about UTRA frequencies used
in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS),
and UTRA neighboring cells relevant for cell reselection.
SIB7 contains information about GSM/EDGE Radio Access
Network (GERAN) frequencies relevant for cell reselection.
SIB8 contains information about CDMA2000 frequencies and
CDMA2000 neighboring cells relevant for cell reselection.

Service (MBMS).
Downlink
channel
of
the
3GPP
LTE
system
uses
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA).
Therefore, resources are divided into time and frequency
axis. Measurement of MIB and SIB1 is essential steps
before handover decision to CSG femtocell. MIB and SIB1
messages are broadcasted from eNBs periodically. System
information broadcasting scheduling in time domain is shown
in Figure 1. Length of a subframe is 1ms. And, 10 subframes
compose a frame. Therefore, length of a frame is 10ms. MIB
message packets are generated for every 4 frames (40ms)
and replicas are transmitted for every frame (10ms). The
packet generation time and transmission duration of SIB1
are double of those of MIB, respectively. Therefore, SIB1
packets are generated for every 8 frames and its replicas are
transmitted for every 2 frames. Another system information
might be scheduled aperiodically or use other transmission
duration. The scheduling information of SIBs in the system
information messages is contained in SIB1 messages [6].
III. SYSTEM INFORMATION MEASUREMENT IN 3GPP LTE
SYSTEM
UE measures system information from neighboring cell
after neighboring cell detection. UE has to disconnect the
link with serving eNB to measure system information from
target eNB. The service interruption time for measurement is
called “Measurement Gap”. System information measurement
could be performed autonomously or by scheduling from
serving eNB. In the autonomous method shown in Figure 2,
UE determines the measurement gap by itself. During the
measurement gap, packet drop can be occurred since serving
eNB cannot know whether the UE is disconnected or not.
In the scheduled method shown in Figure 3, UE requests for
measurement gap to serving eNB and serving eNB allocate
measurement gaps to the UE. Therefore, packet drop does not
occur in scheduled methods.

A. Autonomous Measurement with a Large Gap
The Autonomous Measurement with a Large Gap (AMLG)
method is shown in Figure 2. In this method, a UE disconnect
with serving eNB when candidate neighboring eNBs are de-
tected, and measures MIBs and SIB1s . The UE reconnect with
serving eNB after successive MIB and SIB1 measurement. The
measurement gap and the measurement delay are given by
Tgap = TMIB+SIB1
(1)
and
Tdelay
=
TMIB+SIB1 + TRRC + · · ·
=
6 (TMIB+SIB1 + TRRC) ,
(2)
respectively. The measurement delay is the duration from cell
detection to measurement completion. And, It is represented
as dark (blue) area in Figure 2. The measurement gap is
represented dotted (yellow) area. TMIB+SIB1 is the service
interruption time to receive both of MIB and SIB1 packets of
target CSG HeNB at once. TMIB+SIB1 is 25ms in the worst
case, because maximum time for MIB is 10ms and maximum
distance between MIB and SIB1 in time domain is 15ms. And
TRRC is the time during a RRC message is transmitted. We
assume that TRRC is about 10ms because it is the length of a
frame. Figure 4 shows the timing diagram of AMLG.

measurement gap to serving eNB. Then, the serving eNB
allocate a large measurement gap to the UE. Therefore, SMLG
need more measurement delay than AMLG to exchange
scheduling messages. The measurement gap and delay are

measurement of MIB after detect strong neighboring cell. The
UE can predict the time when the target cell transmit a SIB1,
because the UE get SFN information from MIB measurement.
Therefore, the UE need only one more tiny measurement gap
to measure SIB1. The measurement gap and delay are
Tgap = TMIB or TSIB1,
(5)
and
Tdelay
=
TMIB + WSIB1 + TSIB1 + TRRC
+TMIB + WSIB1 + TSIB1 + TRRC + · · ·
=
6 (TMIB + WSIB1 + TSIB1 + TRRC)
(6)
where TMIB is time to measure MIB and TSIB1 is time to
measure SIB1. TMIB is less than 10ms and TSIB1 is about
1ms without channel error. WSIB1 is waiting time until the
SIB1 packet is transmitted.
D. Scheduled Measurement with several Small Gaps I
The Scheduled Measurement with several Small Gaps I
(SMSG1) method is almost same with AMSG method except
the part of exchanging RRC messages to schedule the mea-
surement gaps. The ﬂow chart and timing diagram are shown
in Figure 3 and Figure 7, respectively. The measurement gap
and delay are given by
Tgap = TMIB or TSIB1,
(7)
and
Tdelay
=
3 · TRRC + TMIB + 3 · TRRC + WSIB1
+TSIB1 + 3 · TRRC + · · · + WSIB1
+TSIB1 + TRRC
=
6 (TMIB + WSIB1 + TSIB1) + 37 · TRRC (8)
respectively. The SMSG1 method naturally has hybrid charac-
teristic of scheduled methods and methods those use several
small gaps.

The SMSG2 method is hybrid method. UE which uses
this method, request measurement gap for MIB to serving
eNB. After the UE measure MIB, the UE measure SIB1
autonomously, because the UE knows the timeslot when the
SIB1 packet will be transmit and the serving eNB knows the
maximum measurement gap for a single cell is 25ms. The
timing diagram are shown in Figure 8. The measurement delay

respectively.
IV. AUTONOMOUS MEASUREMENT WITH PARALLEL
SMALL GAPS
We propose the Autonomous Measurement with Parallel
Small Gaps (AMPSG) method to reduce measurement delay.
All methods which are proposed in section III, are serial
methods. ‘Serial methods’ means that the UE measures system
informations of target cells cell-by-cell in order of Reference
Signal Received Power (RSRP). First, the UE which operates
with AMPSG method, measures MIB packets of target cells
cell-by-cell in order of RSRP. Then, the UE sorts the target
cells in order of distance in time domain. Second, the UE
measures the earliest SIB1 packet of target cells and next SIB1
packets until all the SIB1 packets of target cells are received.
Figure 9 is the ﬂowchart of the proposed AMPSG method.
The measurement delay and gap are given by
Tgap = TMIB or TSIB1,
(11)
and
Tmeas = 6 · TMIB + 6 · TSIB1 + TRRC
(12)
respectively.
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we present the results of mathematical
analysis and simulation. In the mathematical analysis, we
analyze the maximum measurement delay of measurement
methods in worst case. The equations which are used in
mathematical analysis, are equation 1-12. In the simulation
we use OPNET simulation tool and the parameters which are
used, are presented in Table I. And, the network deployment
in the simulation is shown in Figure 11. The UE perform
system information measurements of 6 target HeNB in a
simulation execution. We repeated simulation 200 times with
different random seed value for each measurement method.
Figure 12 and 13 show numerical results of mathematical
analysis and simulation. In the graph, the x axis represents
four methods those are proposed in this paper, and the
y axis represents time in the unit of milliseconds. In the
mathematical analysis, the maximum service interruption
time of both the AMLG and the SMLG methods is about
25ms, while that of the AMSG, SMSG1, SMSG2 and
the AMPSG methods is about 10ms. And, the maximum
measurement delay of the autonomous methods is 210ms,
while the scheduled methods have extra delays about 30ms

or 60ms for scheduling message exchange. The AMPSG
method shows the shortest measurement delay compared with
other methods. In the simulation results, the graph shows
similar trend with that of mathematical analysis but, the scale
is not exactly matched. The differences between two graphs
are due to that the mathematical analysis performed with
assumption of worst case. And, the AMPSG shows more
delay compared with worst case analysis because overlapping
of system information broadcast can occur in the simulation.
As a result, the methods with several small gaps show better
performance in aspect of service interruption time. But, all
of four methods have smaller than 25ms service interruption
time. Therefore, the measurement does not inﬂuence on video
or VoIP services critically, if the channel quality is properly
good to prevent errors in system information message packets.
And, autonomous methods show much better performance
than that of scheduled methods in the aspect of measurement

delay. However, autonomous methods have possibility of
packet drop, because the serving cell cannot know whether
the UE is disconnected or not. If we want to use the AMLG,
AMSG or AMPSG method, we need extra mechanism to
prevent possible packet drops. Moreover, parallel method
shows better measurement delay performance than that of
serial methods. Consequently, the AMPSG method is best
solution when the system requires small measurement delay.
VI. CONCLUSTION
In this paper, we propose for system information measure-
ment methods for the 3GPP LTE CSG cell. And we evaluated
the performance of those methods in the terms of service
interruption time (measurement gap) and measurement delay
by mathematical analysis and simulation. As a result, the
measurement gaps of methods with a large gap are larger
than those of methods with several small gaps. And, the
measurement delays of autonomous methods are much shorter
than those of scheduled methods. Also, the parallel method
shows best performance in aspect of measurement delay.
