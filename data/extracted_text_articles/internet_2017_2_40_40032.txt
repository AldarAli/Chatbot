Abstract—Wireless 
body 
area 
networks 
(WBANs) 
can 
significantly improve healthcare, diagnostic monitoring, and 
other medical services. However, existing standards, such as 
IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 cannot fulfill all the 
requirements of WBANs. Numerous medium access control 
(MAC) protocols have been studied, most of which are derived 
from the IEEE 802.15.4 superframe structure with some 
improvements. Nevertheless, the MAC protocols do support 
required quality of service (QoS) for various forms of traffic 
coexisting in a WBAN. This paper proposes a traffic-aware 
MAC (TA-MAC) protocol for WBANs that allocates time slots 
dynamically based on traffic priority. The performance study 
shows that the proposed TA-MAC outperforms IEEE 802.15.4 
MAC and the conventional priority-based MAC in terms of 
throughput and energy efficiency.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
A wireless body area network (WBAN) is a special-
purpose sensor network that is designed to autonomously 
connect various medical sensors and appliances located 
inside and around the human body and is capable of long-
term health monitoring remotely or within a hospital. The 
general organization of a WBAN is shown in Figure 1. A 
WBAN consists of biomedical sensor nodes used to monitor 
physiological signals, such as electromyography (EMG), 
electroencephalography (EEG), temperature, heart rate, and 
blood pressure [1]. Quality of service (QoS) is an important 
benchmark to achieve in WBANs. The key requirements in 
WBANs are small device size, low power consumption, 
negligible electromagnetic effects to the human body, short 
transmission 
delay, 
high 
reliability, 
and 
effective 
communication. WBANs have specific requirements and 
considerations that the IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control 
(MAC) protocol does not fully address [2]. 
MAC protocols play a vital role in prolonging the 
lifespan of a network by controlling the sources of energy 
waste such as packet collisions, overhearing, control packet 
overhead, and idle listening [3] [4]. The main approaches 
adopted for energy savings in MAC protocols for WBANs 
are lower-power listening (LPL), schedule contention, and 
time division multiple access (TDMA). In the LPL 
mechanism, nodes wake up for a short duration to check the 
activity in the channel without receiving data. Scheduled 
contention is a combination of scheduling process and 
contention-based mechanism to avoid the problem of 
scalability and collision. 
The IEEE 802.15.6 standard [5] defines new physical 
(PHY) and MAC layers to address both medical/healthcare 
applications and other nonmedical applications with diverse 
requirements. The MAC layer in the standard intends to 
define short-range wireless communication in and around the 
human body. The standard aims to support low complexity, 
low cost, ultra-low power, and highly reliable wireless 
communication for use in close proximity to or inside the 
human body (but not limited to the human body) to satisfy an 
evolutionary set of entertainment and healthcare products 
and services. 
The design of MAC protocols has a significant impact on 
energy efficiency, interference, reliability, and QoS 
provision. 
One 
MAC 
protocol 
cannot 
satisfy 
the 
requirements of all applications because the protocols are 
hardware- and application-dependent [6]. The MAC protocol 
suitable for WBANs must handle specific challenges and 
issues associated with WBAN topology and node constraints. 
In [7], the different PHY and MAC layer design approaches 
to develop efficient mobile health (mHealth) applications for 
WBANs are surveyed and discussed. The key design features, 
MAC layer challenges, energy consumption, coexistence, 
and issues concerning channel modelling are analyzed and 
summarized in [8] [9]. 
In this paper, we propose a traffic-aware MAC (TA-
MAC) protocol for WBANs that prioritizes the nodes by 
using a priority-guaranteed CSMA/CA procedure in the 
30

contention access period (CAP). For TA-MAC, we classify 
data traffic into four priorities and categorize the CAP into 
four sub-phases with dynamically changing length. This 
protocol is designed to support various QoS requirements for 
the data classified by priorities in WBANs. The proposed 
TA-MAC supports CAP and contention-free period (CFP). 
In the CAPs, the operation is based on a priority-guaranteed 
CSMA/CA procedure in which different WBAN nodes are 
assigned different priorities. The CFP is used to carry the 
large number of data packets to the coordinator. 
This paper is organized as follows: In the following 
section, some related research is reviewed and discussed 
briefly. The proposed MAC protocol is presented in Section 
3. In Section 4, the performance of the proposed TA-MAC is 
evaluated via computer simulation and compared with IEEE 
802.15.4 MAC and the conventional priority-based MAC 
protocol. Section 5 concludes the paper.

RELATED WORKS 
The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol was designed for low-
data-rate applications and is the most commonly used MAC 
protocol in wireless sensor networks to support low power 
and low data rate in cases where latency and bit rate are not 
critical [11]. The general characteristics of IEEE 802.15.4 
MAC are low power consumption, support for low-latency 
devices, star or peer-to-peer operation, and dynamic device 
addressing. The superframe structure of IEEE 802.15.4 
MAC consists of a CAP, a CFP, and an inactive period. The 
CFP contains up to seven guaranteed timeslots (GTS). The 
duration of the superframe is described by the values of 
macBeaconOrder (BO) and macSuperFrameOrder (SO). The 
BO describes the beacon interval at which the coordinator 
may transmit its beacon. IEEE 802.15.4 MAC does not have 
any mechanism for prioritizing among the different kinds of 
data traffic, and low-priority data can block the transmission 
of high-priority data.   
There have been many significant developments of MAC 
protocols for WBANs. Most of the MAC protocols are 
already used for specific purposes, but they can be adopted 
with certain modifications to fulfill the requirements of 
WBANs. Most research has focused on the IEEE 802.15.4 
standard for low-rate wireless personal area networks. 
An IEEE 802.15.3-based MAC protocol was developed 
as part of a body area system for ubiquitous multimedia 
applications [12]. The main objective of a body MAC [13] is 
to achieve energy efficient and flexible operation in terms of 
bandwidth allocation and to support a sleep mode to fulfill 
the requirements of WBANs. The context-aware MAC 
protocol [14] was designed to guarantee the real-time 
transmission of life-critical and emergency data. In 
heartbeat-driven MAC (H-MAC) protocol [15], efficiency is 
achieved through the TDMA approach by reducing idle 
listening and avoiding collisions. In [16], support for 
multiple physical layers including ultra-wideband is taken 
into account. A multichannel management scheme for 
WBANs is introduced in [17]. In the traffic priority and load-
adaptive MAC protocol presented in [18], the transmission 
schedules of packets are determined based on their priorities. 
The traffic-adaptive MAC (TaMAC) protocol [19] uses a 
traffic-based wakeup mechanism and a wakeup radio to 
accommodate normal, emergency, and on-demand traffic in 
a reliable manner. A traffic load-aware sensor MAC is 
reported in [20] for collaborative body area sensor networks. 
In [21], a traffic-aware dynamic MAC protocol (TAD-MAC) 
for both invasive and noninvasive WBANs is introduced. In 
[22], a novel priority-based channel access algorithm for 
contention-based MAC (NPCA-MAC) protocol is devised to 
solve the contention complexity problem. A hybrid and 
secure MAC (PMAC) protocol for WBANs [23] uses two 
CAPs for accommodating normal and critical data, whereas 
one CFP is used for accommodating the large amount of data 
packets. In low-delay traffic-adaptive MAC (LDTA- MAC) 
protocol [24], GTSs are allocated dynamically based on 
traffic load to improve some of the shortcomings of the IEEE 
802.15.4 MAC.  
Existing standards, such as IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 
802.15.4 cannot fulfill all requirements of WBANs. 
Therefore, numerous MAC protocols have been studied. 
Most of them are derived from the IEEE 802.15.4 
superframe 
structure 
with 
some 
improvements 
and 
adjustments. However, they do not support differentiated 
QoS for various kinds of traffic coexisting in a WBAN. 
III. 
TRAFFIC-AWARE MAC PROTOCOL 
In this section, the proposed TA-MAC is presented in 
detail. The priority level of different kinds of data traffic, 
dynamic timeslot allocation, and data transfer procedures are 
discussed in the following subsections. 
A. Priority Level of Traffic  
Among WBAN applications, medical and consumer 
electronics (CE) signals represent the majority of data traffic 
in the network. Emergency traffic, which is directly related 
to the life of a patient (e.g., emergency alarm signals) should 
be regarded as the most important service and must be in the 
first priority level. Continuous medical traffic with common 
vital signals (e.g., EEG, electromyography) ranks in the 
second priority level. Discontinuous medical traffic (e.g., 
temperature, blood pressure) ranks in the third priority level. 
CE traffic (e.g., audio/videos transmitted in an event-driven 
manner) is ranked in the fourth priority level. The priority 
levels for different kinds of traffic are shown in Table I.

B. Dynamic Timeslot Allocation 
The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol consists of CAPs and 
CFPs. In this paper, we focus on the channel access of CAP 
because the performance of a CAP significantly influences 
the collision probability and the final throughput. When 
numerous nodes are densely deployed in a narrow region, 
contention complexity is increased and leads to high energy 
consumption and high collision. Contention complexity is 
one of the requirements of WBANs that must be satisfied so 
that the necessary QoS and low power consumption can be 
best achieved. Here, we divide the CAP into sub-phases for 
each priority level of traffic; i.e., ET-CAP (Phase 1), ODT-
CAP (Phase 2), NT-CAP (Phase 3), and NMT-CAP (Phase 
4) as shown in Figure 2. Nodes that transmit P1 traffic can 
access channels through all phases from 1 to 4. P2 can access 
channels from Phases 2 to 4. Similarly, P3 can access 
channels through Phases 3 and 4. The node that transmits P4 
can use only Phase 4 to access the channel. Phase 1 always 
occupies the first time slot of the CAP [25]. To avoid wasted 
timeslot utilization, the length of sub-phases L2, L3, and L4 
dynamically change and are calculated by the coordinator 
according to number of priority nodes on that sub-phase 
using (1), (2), and (3), respectively. 
The length of Phase 1 in Figure 2 is fixed; it is one time 
slot long and always occupies the first time slot of the CAP. 
However, the lengths of the remaining phases are variable 
and represented as

where Ni is the number of ith priority nodes and L is the

C. Data Transfer Procedure 
In the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol, the CAP is suitable 
for the transfer of short data and command messages, and the 
CFP is designed for transferring continuous data. The 
coordinator continuously broadcasts beacons to all nodes, 
and active nodes receive the beacons. The nodes send a 
request to the coordinator for allocation of time slots in the 
CAP. According to the number of requests received, the 
coordinator also allocates TDMA slots in the CFP. To 
alleviate the collision of data traffic, a GTS scheduling 
criterion is defined. For P1 and P3, the data are transmitted 
immediately after successfully accessing the channel in the 
CAP. However, for P2 and P4, the nodes uniformly send GTS 
request command frames in the CAP to apply for GTS 
allocation. The data transfer procedures for different 
priorities of traffic are shown in Figures 3 and 4. In the CAP, 
TA-MAC employs the priority-based CSMA/CA procedure, 
which is based on the IEEE 802.15.6 standard. Each priority 
class has differentiated maximum/minimum contention 
windows and contention probability values to provide 
priority-based 
channel 
access 
to 
satisfy 
the 
QoS 
requirements of WBANs [5].

A. Performance Metrics 
The performance metrics used in our simulation are 
throughput and energy efficiency. In this subsection, the 
metrics are summarized in brief. In addition, the effects of 
different priority levels are evaluated and discussed in terms  
of average transmission time. 
Throughput in data communications refers to the actual 
level of traffic put through the network across a path between 
a transmitting device and one or more receiving devices, 
from end to end. It is defined as the average rate of 
successful packet delivery over a communication channel. 
Energy efficiency is one of the key requirements for WBAN 
MAC protocol designs. 
Energy consumption depends on the behavior of the 
nodes on the network. A network with heavy traffic has 
higher energy consumption than one with low traffic activity. 
In order to comprehensively compare the MAC protocols, 
we calculated average energy consumption per bit to 
evaluate energy efficiency. The energy consumption per bit 
is defined as the total energy consumption over the total 
number of bits delivered during a simulation run [26]. 
B. Simulation Environment 
Our performance simulation was carried out using the ns-
2 network simulator version 2.35. In our simulation, it is 
assumed that several biomedical sensors are attached to or 
implanted into the human body. The sensors collect the 
sensed data and transmit them to the central coordinator, 
resulting in a star topology. All sensor nodes are randomly 
deployed within a 5 m radius around the central coordinator, 
and data are transmitted using one-hop communication [22]. 
The network parameters used for simulation are summarized 
in Table II as in [27].

C. Simulation Results and Discussion 
The overall throughput of the proposed TA-MAC, IEEE 
802.15.4 MAC and NPCA-MAC is shown in Figure 5. The 
throughput is  the total amount of data packets received by 
the coordinator in a specific time interval. Here, we can see 
that the throughput of all three protocols increases with the 
increase in the number of sensor nodes. When the network 
has low traffic load (i.e., less than 15 sensor nodes), all the 
three protocols perform similarly. With the increased number 
of sensor nodes, TA-MAC shows improved throughput over 
NPCA-MAC and IEEE 802.15.4 MAC. As a matter of fact, 
the classification of continuous and discontinuous data 
transfers and allocation of GTSs for continuous data makes 
TA-MAC outperform NPCA-MAC and IEEE 802.15.4 
MAC. 
The average energy consumption per bit as a function of 
the number of nodes is illustrated in Figure 6. The proposed 
TA-MAC and NPCA-MAC show better performance than 
IEEE 802.15.4 MAC in all network scenarios. However, TA-
MAC shows slightly better performance than NPCA-MAC 
when the number of nodes is greater than 15. In general, 
packet collision and retransmission result in more energy 
consumption. As the number of nodes is increased, the 
energy consumption of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC is increased 
sharply because of high contention complexity. However, in 
the proposed TA-MAC, prioritized channel access with 
differentiated contention window, classification of data 
transfer, and backoff exponential values reduce the 
contention complexity, number of collisions, and packet 
retransmissions thus contributing to reduced energy 
consumption. 
For comparing the performance of the sensor nodes 
according to their priority level, scenarios with the different 
number of sensor nodes per priority level are taken into 
evaluation. Figure 7 shows the effect of four different 
priority levels in terms of average transmission time for the 
different number of sensor nodes.  In this paper, transmission

time is defined as the end-to-end delay from a sensor node to 
the coordinator. In Figure 7, the average transmission time of 
individual priority traffic is depicted for the proposed TA-
MAC and IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, but the average 
transmission time of NPCA-MAC is not shown because it is 
almost the same as that of TA-MAC. This is primarily 
because NPCA-MAC also divides the CAP into four sub-
phases according to the different priority levels of traffic as 
in TA-MAC. In NPCA-MAC, however, the continuous and 
discontinuous data transfer procedures and the use of GTSs 
were not considered. In addition, the number of sensor nodes 
per priority level is varied from 5 to 35 in Figure 7, and the 
impact on the average transmission time for the sensor nodes 
of each priority level is observed. As shown in Figure 7, the 
average transmission time tends to increase with the increase 
of priority level in both protocols. The difference is more 
noticeable in IEEE.15.4 in comparison to TA-MAC. It is 
obviously shown that TA-MAC shows better performance 
than IEEE 802.15.4 MAC. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have proposed a traffic-aware MAC 
protocol called TA-MAC for WBANs to support various 
QoS requirements. The proposed TA-MAC differentiates the 
access phase of the CAP and classifies the transfer procedure 
of priority-based traffic in WBANs. TA-MAC uses CFPs for 
continuous and large amounts of data. According to the 
simulation 
results, 
TA-MAC 
showed 
substantial 
improvements in terms of throughput and energy efficiency 
compared to IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and the conventional 
NPCA-MAC. A possible future work is to apply cognitive 
radio and multichannel access to the design of a MAC 
protocol for WBANs in order to mitigate the coexisting 
interference and improve network performance including 
QoS.
