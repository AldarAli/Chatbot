Abstract — We review results on theoretical modeling of 
biochemical systems in support of the studies of several types 
of biosensors and systems for “biocomputing” information 
processing. The developed theoretical techniques have been 
utilized to investigate performance and optimize a novel 
approach to biosensors with extended linear response for lysine 
detection and also to study a “binary” response of a metabolic 
“branch point effect” system for detection of glucose. We study 
the experimental data for the flow-injection amperometric 
biosensor based on the action of Lysine-2-monooxygenase and 
L-Lysine-alpha-Oxidase. Lysine is a homotropic substrate for 
both enzymes. Parameter values are identified for an extended 
linear range of response. For a “branch point effect” system, 
we demonstrate that an “intensity filter” mechanism can yield 
a sigmoid response useful in biochemical signal processing and 
enzyme-based biosensing applications. 
Keywords – enzyme biosensor; linear response; differential 
sensitivity; intensity filter

 INTRODUCTION 
We report our recent results in the field of biosensing and 
biocomputing aimed at investigating the control of several 
types of biochemical responses for lysine [1], Section II, and 
glucose detection [2], Section III. These investigations have 
been motivated by interest in novel diagnostic applications 
[3-8] involving sensing, information and signal processing in 
chemical [9-11] and biochemical [12-15] systems, including 
those based on enzyme-catalyzed reactions [16-18]. Such 
systems use enzyme-catalyzed reaction cascades with 
properties optimized for the information/signal processing in 
biocomputing systems [19-24] and for controlling the 
input/output signal response to improve detection in 
biosensors of different types [8,25-28]. New applications 
have been considered for the multi-enzyme biosensors with 
response/actuation of the threshold-type, “digital” nature 
[1,25,28,29]. 
A key requirement in design of biocomputing systems 
has been the avoidance of noise amplification by 
biochemical processes used as network elements [7,30]. In 
this regard, the most promising approach has been to 
transform a typical convex shape signal in a biocatalytic 
process to a sigmoid-shape response, similar to natural 
systems [31,32]. Such transformation of the response can 
yield “biomolecular filters.” These filters are usually based 
on different mechanisms such as self-promoter enzyme 
properties [33], pH control by buffering [23,34], redox 
transformations [35], or utilization of competing enzymatic 
processes [28]. Their action is based on realizing a sigmoid 
response of the output as a function of the input [2,7,22-
24,36-38]. This can be achieved, for instance, by designing 
systems with “intensity filtering” in which a fraction of the 
output signal is neutralized by adding an additional 
(bio)chemical process [7,20,28,35]. When the added filtering 
reaction practically stops (once the added reactant is 
consumed), the intensity of the output signal increases, 
resulting in a sigmoid shape of the response [22-24,36]. Such 
a response allows a clear differentiation of the levels of the 
“binary” logic-0 and logic-1 output signal levels, as well as 
avoids noise amplification from the input signal to the 
output. We consider an example of such a system in 
Section III. 
However, in many biosensor applications the level of the 
output signal must be approximately proportional to the 
concentration of the detected “input-signal” substance 
[27,39-42]. This enables easy calibration in response to the 
variations of the enzyme activity from batch to batch and 
during the extended times of biosensor use. Optimization of 
such biochemical sensing systems should be aimed at 
achieving a high degree of linearity [1]. We illustrate design 
of biosensors with extended linear response, by utilizing a 
combined function of more than a single enzyme, in 
Section II. 
II. 
BIOSENSORS WITH EXTENDED LINEAR RESPONSE 
The experimental study and analysis of the systems for 
lysine detection have shown that a typical enzymatic process 
can have a good linear sensitivity only at lower 
concentrations of lysine [27,40-42]. Another allosteric 
enzymatic process has an approximately linear response to 
the same substrate, but only for a range of larger input 
concentration. Incorporation of this allosteric enzyme in the 
biochemical system leads to the effect of increasing the 
linear range of the signal [1,40], but also in some cases to a 
certain decrease in its intensity. Control of the proportions of 
the two enzymes in the system can optimize the linearity of 
this 
bi-enzymatic 
biosensor 
signal 
[1,39-42]. 
Many 
experimental studies of bi-enzymatic biosensors have been 
recently reported [8,43-46]. Therefore, theoretical analysis of

their performance optimization is warranted [1]. We consider 
a particular system for detection of lysine that was measured 
amperometrically by oxygen consumption in a flow-through 
analyzer [1,27,40-42]. 
The first enzymatic process is catalyzed by L-Lysine-
alpha-Oxidase (LO):  
L-Lysine ൅ O2
  LO  
ሱۛሮ 
α-keto-ε-aminocaproate ൅ H2Oଶ ൅ NH3 
(1) 
The output signal of this enzymatic process was measured by 
the consumption of oxygen. Its shape is linear in a small 
range of input lysine concentration [27], and it saturates for 
larger concentrations. The second, allosteric enzymatic 
process was catalyzed by Lysine-2-monooxygenase (LMO): 
L-Lysine ൅ O2
  LMO  
ሱۛۛۛሮ 
δ-aminovaleramide ൅ CO2 ൅ H2O 
(2)
The shape of the output signal for this process is not linear 
for small inputs. It has a self-promoter sigmoid form 
(homotropic response) [27,40]. However, when both 
enzymes LO and LMO are present then the resulting 
response signal can be made linear with a good degree of 
linearity. LMO was added approximately in multiples of the 
LO concentration. With the proper choice of the process 
parameters, the linearity of the signal will be considerably 
extended without significantly reducing the output signal 
intensity [1,27,40-42].  
For this biosensor system we propose a modeling 
approach [1] to quantify the sensitivity and degree of 
linearity of the resulting signal. It is not always possible to 
model a system’s response in detail, because kinetic 
equations for biochemical processes involve many pathways 
and rates. Therefore, our numerical modeling has focused on 
few key parameters sufficient to quantify the signal 
processing. The reason for this has been that the available 
experimental data are usually limited and frequently very 
noisy.  
Most enzymes have mechanisms of action that are quite 
complex, with many pathways, involving a lot of adjustable 
rate parameters. These rate constants are normally enzyme-
batch dependent and typically change considerably with the 
chemical and physical conditions of the system. Therefore, 
we use a simplified kinetic consideration for few key 
processes in terms of rate constants. This approach allows 
finding an approximate representation of the shape of the 
system’s response curve or surface with few adjustable rate 
parameters.  
For the first, non-allosteric enzyme, LO, we use the 
standard Michaelis-Menten (MM) description: 
ܧଵ ൅ ܵ
݇ଵ
⇄
݇ିଵ
ܥଵ 
(3) 
ܥଵ
݇ଶ
→
 
ܧଵ ൅ ܲ 
(4) 
The first enzyme, LO, of concentration ܧଵ, consumes the 
substrate (L-Lysine), the concentration of which is denoted 
as ܵ, and produces the complex, ܥଵ . This complex later 
transforms to the product, ܲ, while restoring the enzyme ܧଵ. 
All the concentrations here are time dependent. The first step 
of the reaction is naturally reversible. For biosensor and 
information processing applications this system is typically 
driven by the forward reaction. Thus, we assume that 
݇ିଵ ൎ 0.  Therefore, 
there 
are only 
two 
adjustable 
parameters, ݇ଵ,ଶ, for an approximate description of the LO-
catalyzed kinetics.  
Note that the real experimental data for this biosensor 
were obtained for flow systems at certain “measurement 
time,” ݐ ൌݐ୫, here ݐ୫ ൌ 120 sec [27,40], as function of the 
input concentration, ܵ. Since both enzymatic processes (LO 
and LMO) were in their steady states, we can use a 
representative product concentration, ܲሺݐሻ, calculated as a 
function of time, ignoring spatial variation of the product 
concentration along the flow.  
The actual measurements [27,40-42] were made 
amperometrically. Therefore, the signal measured, to be 
denoted ܸ, is not one of the concentrations of the product 
chemicals, but is rather proportional to the oxygen 
consumption rate in the system. The conversion factor of the 
product concentration ܲ to the actually measured signal ܸ is 
not known, and it can depend on the chemical conditions, 
specifically, the pH [40], and on the enzyme batch. Thus, the 
conversion factor, ߛ, was taken as another adjustable 
parameter: 
ܸ ൌߛܲሺݐmሻ 
(5) 
It is now possible to write down a set of differential rate 
equations and carry out numerical simulations to analyze the 
available experimental data. These equations are shown 
below, once the second enzyme, LMO, kinetics is included. 
Figure 1 illustrates the results of such modeling. The data for 
the LO-only experiment were fitted assuming the initial 
values ܧଵሺ0ሻ ൌ 0.26 µM, and ܵሺ0ሻ varying from 0 up to 60 
mM. The parameters were ݇ଵ ൌ 2.1 ൈ 10ିଷ  mM–1sec–1,

For the second added enzyme (LMO), ܧଶሺݐሻ, we should 
take into account the fact that L-Lysine has a self-promoter 
substrate property (Figure 1). Apparently, LMO is an 
allosteric enzyme, but the detailed scheme of its functioning 
has not been studied in the literature. We apply a simplified 
version of the model [1,47-49] of conventional self-promoter 
allostericity, which explains sigmoid properties:

(8) 
For this scheme, we assume that some amount of 
substrate is used to transform LMO into a more active form, 
ܧଶ
௔, where this active form of enzyme works according to the 
MM scheme similar to Eq. (3-4). This description ignores 
many possible kinetic pathways connecting them into 
effective single steps allowing to limit the number of 
adjustable parameters, and assuming that the conversion 
factor, ߛ, is the same. Note the product of the reaction (8) 
differs from that in (4), for LO. We can use the notation P in 
both cases, because the two processes consume oxygen—
which is the actual measured signal—identically. The initial 
value was ܧଶሺ0ሻ ൌ 0.25 µM, and the fitted constants were 
݇ଷ ൌ 0.39 ൈ 10ିଷ mM–1sec–1, ݇ସ ൌ 0.47 ൈ 10ିଷ mM–1sec–1, 
݇ହ ൌ 1.2 ൈ 10ିଷsec–1. The results of our modeling for an 
LMO-only system are shown in the Figure 1. 
Figure 2 illustrates the data vs. model with the two 
enzymes, with a good degree of consistency for all the initial 
LMO:LO ratios [1,27,40-42]. The functioning of the 
enzymes is interconnected via the substrate concentration, 
which enters in the rate equations:

where ܸሺݐሻ is the measured signal at time ݐ ൌݐm. 
The initial values were ܧଵሺ0ሻ = 0.29 µM for LO, and 
ܧଶሺ0ሻ = ݎ ൈ 0.26 µM for LMO, with ݎ ൌ 1, 8, 12, 29. These 
parameters were obtained for the data from the original 
experimental works [27,40]. For ݎ ൌ 1, the amounts of the 
enzymes per unit mass of the gel on which they were 
immobilized were identical [42]. 
 
 
 
The bi-enzymatic biosensor can be optimized by 
selection of the parameters, here exemplified by r, to get an 
approximately linear response in the desired input regime. In 
order to evaluate the properties of the output signal we use 
the differential sensitivity of the system over the input range, 
S(0) = 0 to 60 mM, see Figure 3: 
݀ܲ
݀ܵ ൌ ݀ܲሺݐmሻ
݀ܵሺ0ሻ  
(14) 
We aim at finding parameters minimizing this function over 
the desired input range. Figure 1 shows that for  ݎ ൌ 0, LO-
only, gives us an almost linear signal only for the range of 
inputs between 0 and 5 mM. However, when r = 29 
(Figure 2), the response has an approximately linear shape in 
the extended input range from S(0) = 0 to 60 mM, as 
confirmed by the differential sensitivity plotted in Figure 3. 
However, the overall biosensor sensitivity drops due to 
such modifications. Therefore, other quality measures must 
be also defined and considered, in addition to “linearity,” as 
detailed in [1], but not reviewed here. Each of such quality 
measures can be formally defined and modeled. For 
example, the linearity of the response can be characterized

by a measure of the deviation of the differential sensitivity 
over the input signal range from the average slope:

For the best quality of response’s linearity we have to 
minimize ∆/∆௥ୀ଴ , plotted as a function of r in 
Figure 4,which indicates that values from 14 to 32 represent 
an optimal range for the parameter r selection based on the 
“linearity” criterion. The actual minimum of the linearity 
measure (Figure 4) is close to r = 20, consistent with the 
experimental results [40].  
III. 
BIOSENSORS WITH BINARY-TYPE SIGMOID RESPONSE 
We consider an enzymatic biosensor with the binary-type 
sigmoid response [2,28]. The input in this system is glucose, 
ܩ, with the initial concentration from 0 mM to 10 mM. 
These values are assumed as logic-0 and logic-1 respectively 
used to define the YES/NO signals. Electrode-immobilized 
glucose oxidase (GOx) consumes glucose [2,28]. The output 
signal I(tg) was measured at the “gate time” ݐ௚ ൌ 180 sec as 
the current due to transfer of two elementary units of charge 
per reaction cycle [28]. The usual response shape for such 
biocatalytic reactions is convex, see Figure 5. However, for 
“binary” information processing it is useful to have a signal 
of a sigmoid shape [37]. This was accomplished [28] by 
consuming a fraction of the input (glucose) directly in 
solution, by a competing enzymatic process. The second 
enzyme, hexokinase (HK), ܪ, has been added, consuming 
glucose and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), ܣ, resulting in a 
biochemical “filtering” effect, see Figure 6.  
 
 
We developed a model [2] based on a rate-equation 
modeling of the key steps of the enzymatic processes in this 
biosensor system, using a limited number of adjustable 
parameters. The GOx enzymatic process is modeled as: 
ܧ൅ܩ
௞భ→ܥ
௞మ→ܧ൅⋯ (16) 
The intermediate complex ܥ is gluconolactone, for the 
kinetics of which we have: 
݀ܥሺݐሻ
݀ݐ
ൌ ݇ଵܩሺݐሻܧሺݐሻ െ ݇ଶܥሺݐሻ 
(17) 
The current ܫሺݐሻ is proportional to the rate of the second 
reaction in Eq. (16); ܫሺݐ௚ሻ ∝ ݇ଶܥሺݐ௚ሻ. Assuming that the 
oxygen concentration was constant, it was absorbed in ݇ଶ. 
Equation (17) is exactly solvable:

The input G has value from 0 to Gmax = 10 mM. Without the 
filtering process, least-squares fit of experimental data from 
[28] gives us the estimates ݇ଵ ≅ 80 mMିଵsିଵ, ݇ଶ ≅ 60 sିଵ.  
With the added filtering process, we consider the 
pathway of the HK biocatalytic process in which glucose 
transforms into the complex D:

In order to minimize noise amplification in the output 
signal, the biosensor parameters must be chosen properly. 
There are usually several sources of noise. The main is the 
fluctuations in the input signal and the transmission of this 
noise from input to output. This transmission could amplify 
or suppress the noise [3,7,37]. Avoiding this “analog noise” 
amplification during signal processing is paramount for 
network stabilization [9,30]. Noise reduction can be achieved 
by modifying the system’s response to sigmoid [2,22-24,34-
38,50,51]. 
Note that a sigmoid curve has a peaked derivative. In 
order to achieve the response curve as symmetric as possible 
we consider the position and width of this peak, aiming at 
finding parameter values for which it is narrow and centrally 
located. Examples are given in Figure 7, and details of the 
optimization for the present system are presented in [2]. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In summary, we reported approaches [1,2] allowing 
optimization of biosensors based on functioning of multiple 
enzymes with different kinetics, yielding  a binary-type 
sigmoid or an extended linear response. Kinetic modeling 
allowed us to evaluate the effects of varying system 
parameters that can be adjusted to control the response.
