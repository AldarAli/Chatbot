Abstract— 
The 
Space 
Internet, 
also 
known 
as 
the 
Interplanetary Internet, is a proposed network intended to 
connect stations on Earth with others in orbit around and on 
the surface of other planets and moons in the Solar System. 
This paper reports on a space Internet development and test 
plans for Korean lunar exploration program. First, Korean 
lunar program was reviewed. Then Delay Tolerant Network 
(DTN) characteristics and DTN protocols used in lunar 
exploration are reviewed. DTN communication architectures 
are presented. The Korea lunar exploration program is divided 
into two phases. In first phase, test lunar Orbiter will be 
launched without Lander or Rover. So, proposed DTN test 
architecture is based on Lander and Rover located on earth. In 
second phase, Lander and Rover will be landed on the moon. 
The DTN architecture and protocol stacks for second phase 
are also proposed.

 INTRODUCTION 
Korea plans to develop a space vehicle on its own and 
launch it during the first half of 2020, and send up a lunar 
orbiter and a lunar lander for itself before the end of the same 
year. In the longer term, it is planning to explore Mars, 
asteroids, and deep space to join the ranks of space industry 
powerhouses [1] [2]. 
The Korean lunar project is divided into two phases. The 
goals of the first phase, which continues until 2017, include 
the completion of the basic technical design of the orbiter 
and module in cooperation with NASA, and the development 
of a test orbiter. At the same time, the scientific equipment to 
be carried in the orbiter and earth-bound control station to be 
responsible for deep space communication will be built. 
The second phase is for the self-production of the orbiter 
and module and actual launch using a Korea Space Launch 
Vehicle (KSLV). To this end, 15 government-funded 
research institutes, such as the Korea Aerospace Research 
Institute (KARI) have formed a council and conducted 31 
research tasks. 
Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute 
(ETRI) plan to develop space Internet technologies for the 
lunar communication. During the first phase, space Internet 
technology developed by ETRI will be tested through test 
lunar orbiter. If first phase testing is successful, space 
Internet technologies will be applied to the mission 
communication in the second phase of lunar exploration. 
This paper focused on overview of development and test 
plan of space Internet technologies for Korea lunar 
exploration. In this paper, Delay/Disruption Tolerant 
Network (DTN) is reviewed first in Section 2. The protocols 
used in DTN communication for Korea lunar exploration is 
reviewed in Section 3. Architecture for DTN communication 
is reviewed in Section 4. In this section, DTN architecture 
for first and second phase is reviewed separately. Finally, 
research activities and future works are summarized in 
Section 5.

DEAY TOLERANT NETWORK 
The Internet has been a great success at interconnecting 
communication devices across the earth. It has done this by 
using a homogeneous set of communication protocols, called 
the TCP/IP protocol suite. All devices on the hundreds of 
thousands of networks that make up the Internet use these 
protocols for routing data and insuring the reliability of 
message exchanges. 
Connectivity on the Internet relies primarily on wired 
links, including the wired telephone network, although 
wireless technologies such as satellite and short range mobile 
links are also an essential part of the network. These links, as 
used on the Internet, are continuously connected in end-to-
end, low-delay paths between sources and destinations. They 
have low error rates and relatively symmetric bidirectional 
data rates. 
The interplanetary network differs from the terrestrial 
Internet in a number ways as following that might arise 
individually or collectively. 
 Intermittent connectivity: Connectivity may suffer from 
disruptions leading to link failure and network 
partitioning, for a large number of reasons like mobility 
issues, radio issues, and battery issues. 
 Delay issues: Links could have a very high propagation 
delay or have such a highly variable delay that 
traditional protocol like TCP would fail. 
 Asymmetric data rates: Links can suffer from highly 
asymmetric data rates or can be simply just 
unidirectional.

 High error rates: Some links may have high error rates. 
They could require a high level of correction and a 
large number of retransmissions, leading to the creation 
of tight bottlenecks [3]. 
 
A DTN is a network of smaller networks. It is an overlay 
on top of special-purpose networks, including the Internet. 
DTNs support interoperability of other networks by 
accommodating long disruptions and delays between and 
within those networks, and by translating between the 
communication protocols of those networks. In providing 
these functions, DTNs accommodate the mobility and 
limited power of evolving wireless communication devices. 
DTNs were originally developed for interplanetary use, 
where the speed of light can seem slow and delay-tolerance 
is the greatest need. However, DTNs may have far more 
diverse applications on earth, where disruption-tolerance is 
the greatest need. The potential earth applications span a 
broad range of commercial, scientific, military, and public-
service applications. 
The DTN architecture implements store-and-forward 
message switching by overlaying a new transmission 
protocol, called the Bundle Protocol (BP), on top of lower-
lower protocols, such as the Internet protocols. The bundle 
protocol ties together the lower protocol layers so that 
application programs can communicate across the same or 
different sets of lower-lower protocols under conditions that 
involve long network delays or disruptions. 
The bundle-protocol agent stores and forwards entire 
bundles (or bundle fragments) between nodes. A single 
bundle protocol is used throughout a DTN. By contrast, the 
lower-lower protocols below the bundle protocol are chosen 
to 
suit 
the 
characteristics 
of 
each 
communication 
environment. 
 
III. 
PROTOCOLS USED IN DTN COMMUNICATIONS 
The protocols used for DTN communication in Korea 
lunar exploration are summarized as following. 
 CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data 
Systems) File Delivery Protocol (CFDP): The CFDP 
[4] is a File Transfer Protocol (FTP)-like protocol for 
transferring files between two entities separated by 
interplanetary distances, on the space links that have 
asymmetric bandwidths. CFDP can be used over a wide 
range of underlying communication services. It can be 
configured for either ground station to spacecraft or 
spacecraft to ground station transfers, apart from other 
configurations of a network of platforms, such as a 
spacecraft constellation or a series of planetary landers. 
The CFDP offers typical file operation commands such 
as delete, move, and copy that can be used to control a 
distant file store. 
 Bundle Protocol (BP): The Bundle Protocol [5] 
provides effective mechanisms for communicating in 
and/or through highly stressed environments such as 
those with intermittent connectivity, large and/or 
variable delays, and high bit error rates. For providing 
its services, BP forms a store-and-forward overlay 
network by sitting at the application layer2 of some 
number of constituent Internets. The protocol data unit 
is called as a bundle and it comprises a sequence of two 
or more blocks of protocol data, which serve various 
purposes. 
 Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP): The Licklider 
Transmission Protocol [6], also known as Long-haul 
Transmission Protocol [7], is principally aimed at 
supporting the links, characterized by extremely long 
message route-trip times and/or frequent interruptions 
in connectivity. It has emerged as one of the best 
candidates as a convergence layer protocol in the case 
of interplanetary space communication. For single hop 
deep-space RF links, LTP is intended to serve as a 
retransmission-based reliable mechanism and does 
ARQ of data transmissions by soliciting selective-
acknowledgment reception reports. LTP's design 
notions are directly descended from the retransmission 
procedures defined for CFDP. 
 Proximity-1: Proximity-1 Space Link Protocol [8] is a 
short haul delivery communications protocol designed 
to establish a two-way communications link between a 
lander and an orbiter, negotiate data rate and 
communications mode, and reliably deliver data during 
short orbiter-to-surface contacts. Developed by CCSDS, 
Proximity-1 is implemented on Mars Exploration 
Rovers, Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, 
and Mars Express as well as on Phoenix Mars Lander. 
The frequency band used by this protocol is in the 400 
MHz band so as to reduce complexity of the ground 
craft. 
 Space Link Extension (SLE): The SLE transfer services 
[9], developed by the CCSDS, provide a standard 
method to transport spacecraft forward and return data 
between various tracking stations, mission operation 
control 
centers 
and 
data-user 
facilities. 
This 
standardization of the interfaces between the various 
facilities permits re-use of systems for successive 
missions and eliminates the development costs of 
mission-specific implementations. Mission risk is 
reduced since standard SLE services facilitate the rapid 
substitution of ground stations in the event of a failure. 
Since 
the 
SLE 
protocols 
run 
over 
existing 
communications infrastructure and utilize TCP/IP 
protocols, they help integrate Space Data Systems into 
the global communications network. 
 
IV. 
DTN COMMUNICATION ARCHITECTURE 
The DTN architecture for lunar exploration consists of 
following communication nodes. 
 Orbiter: orbiting the moon to perform data relay for the 
Lander and Rover 
 Lander: on a moon surface to perform science mission 
and data relay for the Rover

SPACOMM 2015 : The Seventh International Conference on Advances in Satellite and Space Communications

 Rover: move on the moon surface to perform science 
mission 
 Ground Station (GS): on earth for communication with 
the orbiter and lander 
 Mission Control Center (MMC): on earth for 
monitoring and control of the lunar Orbiter 
 Lander Control Center (LCC): on earth for monitoring 
and control of the Lander 
 Rover Control Center (RCC): on earth for monitoring 
and control of the Rover 
The communications links between the nodes are shown 
in Figure 1. The Orbiter can communicate with earth through 
GS whereas Lander and Rover cannot communicate with 
earth directly. Lander and Rover can communicate with earth 
through Orbiter relay.

A. DTN Architecture for first phase 
In the first phase of lunar exploration, test lunar orbiter 
called Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) will be 
launched for the testing purpose. The KPLO mission is to 
verify Orbiter functionality and to check many parameters 
to be considered for the second phase of lunar exploration. 
In the meantime ETRI plan to test DTN technologies 
through KPLO in the first phase of lunar exploration. The 
purpose of testing is to verify DTN protocol functionality 
and performance and also if DTN communication 
architectures 
are 
acceptable 
for 
lunar 
mission 
communications. Figure 2 shows a DTN configuration in 
first phase of lunar exploration. Because there are no Lander 
and Rover on the moon in first phase, ground models of 
Lander and Rover will be located on earth for the 
communication testing. RCC is a source of DTN node and 
Rover is a destination of DTN node. MCC, Lander, KPLO 
and Cube-sat are DTN nodes which perform, store, and 
forward bundles between the source and destination. GS is 
not a DTN node because it just transfers bundles between 
the MCC and Orbiter. GS, MCC, RCC and Lander ground 
model are connected together through Internet. 
Two kinds of DTN tests will be performed in first phase 
of lunar exploration. The first test is a DTN round trip test. 
In this testing, RCC controls Rover on earth through KPLO. 
RCC send command message or files to Rover in earth 
through KPLO and receive status telemetry or image files 
captured by Rover through KPLO also. The signal flow of 
round trip test is shown in Figure 3. Table 1 shows tentative 
protocols between the communication links. 
The CFDP class 1 will be used for message or file 
transfer between RCC and Rover. Custody transfer based on 
store-and-forward mechanism and end-to-end reliability is 
provided by BP and LTP which are underlying CFDP. The 
SLE protocol will be used in the link between MCC and GS. 
This link can be assumed to be continuously available and 
there seems to be no need to apply the store-and-forward of 
BP in the GS. Proximity-1 can be used as a radio link 
between the Orbiter, Lander and Rover. Figure 7 at end of 
this paper shows a protocol stack for DTN round trip test in 
first phase.

Second test is a DTN communication test using Cube-sat.  
Cube-sat is released from the Orbiter when Orbiter is settled 
down in the orbit. Then, RCC on earth sends command to 
Cube-sat, and captured image by Cube-sat is transferred to 
RCC through KPLO relay. Cube-sat mission will continue

until the link between KPLO and Cube-sat is disconnected. 
The signal flow of Cube-sat communication test is shown in 
Figure 4 and Table 2 shows tentative protocols between the 
communication links.

B. DTN Architecture for second phase 
In the second phase of lunar exploration, self-production 
of the Orbiter and Lander will be launched using a Korea 
Space Launch Vehicle (KSLV). The Orbiter is launched 
first and Lander follows. After Orbiter and Lander are 
settled down in its lunar orbit, Lander will be landed on the 
surface of moon. After safe landing, Lander deploys antenna 
and Rover will be released from the Lander. After safe 
release, Rover will perform science mission moving around 
landing area. Figure 5 shows a DTN communication 
configuration in second phase.

As in first phase, CFDP class 1 will be used for file and 
message transfer between the RCC and Rover. The 
protocols are simular with the first phase. The signal flow of 
DTN communication in second phase is shown in Figure 6 
and Table 3 shows tentative protocols between the 
communication links in second phase.

V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we presented a development and test plans 
of space Internet technologies for Korea lunar exploration. In 
the first phase of lunar exploration, two kinds of test 
scenarios are considered now. First scenario is DNT round 
trip test through KPLO. In this test, RCC controls Rover on 
earth through KPLO relay. RCC also monitors telemetry 
from the Rover on earth and also receive images captured by 
Rover through KPLO relay. Second scenario is DTN 
communication with Cube-sat. In this test, RCC controls 
Cube-sat through KPLO, it monitors telemetry from the 
Cube-sat, and also receives image captured by Cube-sat 
through KPLO relay. The purpose of DTN testing in first 
phase is to check and validate that DTN technologies are 
acceptable for the mission communication in second phase. 
In the second phase of lunar exploration, Lander and 
Rover will be located on the surface of moon. In this phase 
DTN technologies will be applied to the communications 
between earth and lunar assets. 
At this moment, ETRI installed DTN test-bed for the test 
of DTN protocols functionality and performance. Also, ETRI 
have a cooperation plan with NASA in the DTN and Cube-
sat development. In near time, ETRI DTN test-bed will be 
connected to NASA test-bed for inter-operability testing. For 
the Cube-sat design, we are considering using smart phone 
as a communication payload for Cube-sat. ETRI also designs 
Proximity-1 space link modem for the inter spaceship 
communications. ETRI also participates in CCSDS meeting 
continuously.
