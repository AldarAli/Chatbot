Abstractâ€”Photovoltaic power generation is affected much by 
weather and temperature, so the amount of power generation 
is not constant and there are many difficulties in predicting. 
Thus, the accurate prediction of the photovoltaic power due to 
climate change is critical to stable electricity supply. In this 
paper, in order to create a power generation forecast model, 
the data, such as power generation, temperature, Daily Mean 
Cloud Amount (DMCA) data has been collected from April 
2016 to September 2016. Using the neural network, the peak 
solar irradiation forecasting model was created, solar 
irradiation was calculated from the peak solar irradiation 
predicted, and finally the model to predict power generation 
was made. In this paper, the peak solar irradiation is predicted 
using the maximum temperature and the peak solar 
irradiation data, and ultimately the solar power generation is 
predicted through the predicted peak solar irradiation.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, concern for the development of alternative 
energy resources has been growing as the energy problem 
gets worse worldwide. Accordingly, the importance of 
renewable energy is emerging and the proportion of 
photovoltaic (PV) power system in the various renewable 
energy sources is increasing. Nowadays the use of the 
distributed power generating systems, especially those using 
PV, is increasing due to the maintenance free, long lasting, 
and environment friendly nature of PV [1]. Accurate 
prediction of PV generation accompanying climate change is 
important for stable supply of electric power, since PV 
generation is most sensitive to climate change among 
renewable energy sources. 
In this paper, the data measured by the energy 
Management System (EMS) built in the smart grid system is 
utilized, and the prediction of the PV power generation aims 
at the efficient energy management of the EMS. In Section 
II, past temperature data and solar irradiation data were 
collected and analyzed, and the maximum temperature and 
the peak solar irradiation were classified. In Section III, peak 
solar irradiation was predicted using the Neural Network 
(NN). Utilizing the predicted peak solar irradiation, finally, 
the amount of PV power generation was predicted.

ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA
First of all, before starting the experiment, temperature 
data, solar irradiation data and DMCA data from April 2016 
to September 2016 were collected and analyzed. Daily 
maximum temperature and daily peak solar irradiation data 
were calculated and classified. Temperature and DMCA data 
were collected from the Meteorological Agency and solar 
irradiation data was collected through its own EMS. Figure 1 
shows the experimental data of hourly solar irradiation 
during April - September 2016. The DMCA data, peak 
irradiation data, and maximum temperature data were 
normalized, and the correlation of the normalized data was 
analyzed. Figure 2 shows the relationship between peak solar 
irradiation and DMCA data. As a result of analyzing the 
normalized DMCA and normalized maximum solar 
irradiation, it can be confirmed that nonlinear inverse 
proportional curves are created in which the solar irradiation 
becomes smaller and smaller as the DMCA is larger. Here, 
the normalized DMCA value 0 means sunny, 1 means very 
cloudy. Figure 3 shows relationship between peak solar 
irradiation and maximum temperature. The maximum 
temperature and the peak solar irradiation are also 
normalized and then analyzed. As a result, as for the 
maximum temperature and peak solar irradiation, a nonlinear 
proportional curve is created as shown in Figure 3 and was 
predicted. Using the analyzed data, a peak solar irradiation   
prediction model is created, and the peak solar irradiation is 
predicted by this forecasting model. Then, the daily solar 
irradiation was predicted from the predicted peak solar 
irradiation, and finally the amount of PV power generation.

SIMULATION
In this paper, simulation to predict one day ahead 
generating power output for PV system was executed for 
efficient energy management of EMS. In order to compare 
the actual generating power amount of the PV power 
generation system with the predicted PV output value of the 
program, the research institution of City C in Korea is 
selected and installed, and the capacity of the PV system is 
50 kW. 
Single layer feedforward NN [2] was used for peak solar 
radiation forecasting algorithm. NN is very effective in 
prediction and is used in various fields, and the model output 
value calculated by input and the desired output value update 
the connection weight to minimize the error. The input layer 
receives as parameters the peak solar irradiation, the 
maximum temperature and the DMCA, while the output 
layer gives as parameters the peak solar irradiation at the 
next day [3]. Prior to performing the algorithm, DMCA data, 
maximum temperature data, peak solar radiation amount data 
as the input data are normalized between 0 and 1. The 
simulation was carried out assuming that tomorrow's cloud 
data and maximum temperature data are known through the 
Meteorological Agency forecasts. Peak solar irradiation was 
predicted by using single layer feedforward NN with 
maximum temperature, peak solar irradiation, DMCA as 
input data. The generating power for PV system was 
calculated by using the least squares method, which is a 
method for minimizing the sum of squares of distances 
between actual values and values predicted by trend lines.

Table 1 shows a comparison of Actual solar irradiance 
data and predicted solar irradiance data. Through Table 1, it 
is possible to confirm that predicted solar irradiance and the 
accuracy of the prediction were verified with Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error (MAPE). As a result of obtaining the 
MAPE of the forecasted solar irradiation from 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m. when the amount of sunlight increased, MAPE was 
3.2% on a sunny day and MAPE was 12.3% on a cloudy day. 
It is difficult to predict because the shape, quantity and 
weight of the cloud cannot be confirmed and clouds are a 
major contributor to the amount of solar radiation. Through 
Figure 5 and Figure 6, it can be confirmed that the hourly 
solar irradiation on a sunny day is comparatively better than 
the day with clouds. Figure 7 shows a comparison between 
actual data and predicted data. Figure 7(a) shows forecasting 
of hourly solar irradiation and Figure 7(b) show forecasting 
of hourly generating power output for PV system in 
September in 2016.

It can be confirmed by seeing Figure 7 that the hourly 
solar irradiation curve pattern and the hourly generating 
power output of for PV system curve pattern are similar.

CONCLUSION
This study predicted PV power generation to make a plan 
for operating ESS efficiently. In Section II, temperature, 
solar irradiation and DMCA data from April 2016 to 
September 2016 were collected and analyzed. In Section III, 
by using NN, the peak solar irradiation amount was 
predicted, and one day ahead daily solar irradiation amount 
was also predicted using the predicted peak solar irradiation 
amount. Then, PV power generation amount was predicted 
using the predicted daily solar irradiation amount. 
Experimental comparison between generating power output 
forecasted through experiments and actual PV output data 
and predicted solar irradiation amount and actual solar 
irradiation data were compared. The proposed method shows 
that the predicted PV values and the actual PV values are 
displayed in a similar curve pattern. The forecast of PV on a 
sunny day improved relatively, but in the case of many 
clouds, the accuracy of the forecast of PV decreased due to 
the amount of clouds and various factors. For follow-up 
research, solar altitude data will be added to the input data of 
the solar prediction model.
