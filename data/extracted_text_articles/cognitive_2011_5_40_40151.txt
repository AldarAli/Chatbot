Abstract— In this study, we provide a two-level decision 
support system for the constitution of supplier pool and  order 
quantity decision for each of the suppliers selected from a 
predetermined candidate list. The candidate suppliers are the 
current vendors in the market. The proposed decision support 
tool integrates a knowledge-based expert system and a genetic 
algorithm to consider both qualitative and quantitative criteria 
in supplier selection and order quantity decision. The expert 
system decreases the candidate suppliers to the most preferred 
ones according to quality, delivery and management core 
dimensions. Genetic algorithm then allocates order quantities 
to each supplier considering quantity discounts, preference 
factors and capacity constraints. A real-life case study at a steel 
structures 
manufacturing 
company 
demonstrates 
an 
application of the proposed support system.

 INTRODUCTION  
Procurement expenses constitute a major component of 
the operating expenditures of the firms. Thus, supplier 
selection has become one of the key issues in supply chain 
management. Furthermore, choosing the right vendors 
would result in improved coordination with suppliers. In 
practice, the contemporary approach is to work with fewer 
but more fulfilling suppliers to build long term relationships 
with each of them. With the increasing diversity of 
suppliers, transaction costs, monitoring costs, supply chain 
strategic and operational risks, competition are increased, 
whereas supplier innovation and responsiveness are 
decreased [1-4]. However, firms benefit from the risk 
pooling effect with the increased number of suppliers. 
 Apparently, building a manageable supplier base is a 
multi-criteria decision making problem which requires the 
analysis of both quantitative and qualitative factors such as 
price, delivery leadtime and quality, and managerial issues 
(feedback, contingency planning, etc.). Consideration of 
quantity discounts also adds a new level of complexity to 
the supplier selection problem. That is, the decision maker 
must determine the order quantities for each supplier under 
several conflicting factors. In this context, the need for an 
effective decision support system is apparent. 
In the literature, a vast number of studies focus on the 
supplier selection issue. One group of studies relies on the 
inventory management perspective. In such studies, delivery 
leadtime, quality, supplier capacity, and other factors are 
embedded into inventory control models. The other group of 
studies mainly concentrates on developing decision support 
systems (such as expert systems, data envelopment analysis) 
based on qualitative factors. In this study, we combine these 
two approaches and propose a two-level decision model 
consisting of a knowledge-based expert system and a genetic 
algorithm. The model is composed of two main stages: In the 
first stage, a knowledge- based expert system is used to 
discover the suppliers --with their preference factors-- that 
we can order for a certain type of product. The second stage 
aims at determining the order quantity allocated to each of 
the selected suppliers with the use of a genetic algorithm. 
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 
presents a review of some of the related literature. Section 3 
introduces the proposed methodology in an overall 
perspective. Sections 4 and 5 present the knowledge-based 
expert system and the genetic algorithm respectively. A case 
study is carried out in Section 6. The final section 
summarizes the paper and presents the conclusion.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
In the area of supply base management numerous 
methods have been used for supplier evaluation and 
selection. We refer the reader to the recent survey of [5]. 
The research analyzes prevalently applied approaches and 
provides evidence that the multi-criteria decision making 
methods are better than the traditional cost-based approach. 
With its practical usefulness, a majority of the studies 
are based on data envelopment analysis [6]. Mainly, the 
methodology seeks for relatively efficient suppliers based 
on multiple inputs and outputs. It relies on the assumption 
that more efficient suppliers are more effective. AHP 
(Analytical Hierarchy Process) is another popular method 
used widely in the literature [7].  It should be noted that, due 
to the number of evaluations required, for problems with a 
large number of alternatives or criteria, the use of this 
technique is unwieldy. The use of intelligent systems, such 
as case-based reasoning, neural networks and expert 
systems form another group of decision making tools [8-
11].  
Most studies in the literature have addressed the 
selection problem solely. Some articles considering the 
order quantity allocation to the selected suppliers under

multiple sourcing strategies. Degraeve and Roodhooft [12] 
followed a mathematical programming approach using 
activity-based costing for supplier selection. Karpak et al. 
[13] and Kumar et al. [14] used goal programming (GP) 
models to select suppliers and allocate orders under 
supplier’s capacity constraints. Ghodsypour and O’Brien 
[15] proposed a mixed integer nonlinear programming 
model to minimize the total cost of logistics, including net 
price, storage, transportation and ordering costs.  
In [16][17][18][19], integrated AHP and GP models are 
used. Relative performances of suppliers found from the 
AHP model was used as inputs to the GP model to find the 
optimal supplier base. Both quantitative and qualitative 
factors could be used for supplier evaluation, but the unit 
price of a product is assumed constant for different order 
quantities.  
Xia and Wu [20] used AHP for searching potential 
suppliers and then used the multi-objective mixed integer 
programming to determine the number of suppliers to 
employ and the order quantity allocated to these suppliers. 
Mendoza and Ventura [21] also used AHP in the first phase 
to reduce the number of suppliers. At the second phase they 
implemented a mixed integer non-linear programming 
method to determine the optimal order quantites. Demirtas 
and Ustun [22] have used analytic network process (ANP) 
in the first step and for quantity allocation they followed the 
similar method used in [20].  
In the studies of [23][24], fuzzy multi-objective 
programming models were developed for supplier selection 
and order quantity allocation. Their later work also 
considered price discounts. Chen [25] used the fuzzy set 
theory to select suppliers under supplier base limitations. 
Eventually, while many studies in the literature address 
the quantity discounts in the economic order quantity 
subject, a little attention has been paid to the case in the 
supplier selection and order quantity allocation problem. 
This paper proposes a two-level approach to seek for the 
most appropriate supplier base by using the expert system 
and 
the 
genetic 
algorithm 
with 
quantity 
discount 
considerations. 
III. 
 THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 
Supplier selection and order quantity allocation is a 
multi-step process which requires the evaluation of suppliers 
by quantitative and qualitative measures dependent on the 
product type and various constraints. The methodology 
proposed in this study follows a two-step architecture 
illustrated in Figure1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Main flowchart. 
 
The first stage uses a knowledge- based expert system to 
select potential suppliers under quality, delivery and 
management dimensions. At the end of this step, a list of 
candidate suppliers with their preference factors is provided 
as an output to the second step. Using this data, the second 
stage searches throughout the solution space under supplier 
capacity constraints and price discounts to determine the 
optimal supplier base.  Finally, at the end of this phase, 
optimal suppliers and their order quantity allocations are 
specified. 
IV. 
STAGE I .THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEM  
 
A. Criteria determination and evaluation  
Dickson [26] listed 23 factors to consider for supplier 
evaluation and selection. Recently, Ho et al. [27] reviewed 
the literature to discover the criterion used by the decision 
makers. Studies identify more than hundreds of measures 
with quality, delivery, cost, manufacturing capability and 
service as being the most popular ones and some recently 
recognized criterions such as environmental standards. In 
general, the evaluation and selection process differs 
according to the purchased product type. Therefore, in the 
developed model, initial determinant in the system is the 
product’s category, which may be either strategic or non-
critical.  
The criteria in this work were determined based on 
related literature and by interviews with the purchasing 
managers of a medium-sized company in the steel structure 
construction business. It should be noted that these criterions 
are subject to discussion and they may be defined in a 
different way for companies in different industries. Figure 2 
shows the decision map for the strategic products.

B. Expert system architecture  
A knowledge-based expert system developed for 
determining the potential suppliers and their preference 
factors is composed of the following elements: User and 
expert interfaces, knowledge base, material requirements 
planning module and the inference engine. The user and the 
material requirements planning module together provide 
information related to the product to be purchased and the 
available suppliers. The knowledge base contains the 
problem specific information obtained from purchasing 
experts. The facts and rules (based on production rules 
semantics) are stored in the knowledge base are generally in 
the structure provided in Table II.

THEN

Example rules given above are used for strategic 
products. Through rule ST_Q_5, the system determines the 
supplier’s quality score as very good, if it is certified, its 
product quality is high and its corrective action management 
is satisfactory. According to the next rule, (ST_D _12), if a 
company’s on-time delivery is rated very good, quantity 
reliability and improvement efforts are excellent then its 
delivery score is excellent. Rule ST_M _9 states that if 
supplier feedback is satisfactory, reputation is very good and 
contingency planning is satisfactory then the management 
score is satisfactory. The scores for the three main 
dimensions are then evaluated together to obtain the 
preference factor in terms of “Unsatisfactory; Marginal; 
Satisfactory; Very Good; Excellent”. For instance, through 
rule ST_P _9, preference factor is rated as very good for a 
supplier with very good quality, excellent delivery and 
satisfactory management. 
V. 
STAGE II   
 
Previous phase determined the potential suppliers along 
with their preference scores. This stage allocates order 
quantities to each of these suppliers under supply constraints 
and price discounts. To search throughout the large solution 
space, a genetic algorithm, which is known as an effective 
method for solving complex optimization problems, was 
employed. 
A. Chromosome representation 
Each chromosome is designed in a way to represent a 
feasible solution with suppliers and their quantity 
allocations. As illustrated in Figure 3, each gene of a 
chromosome is designed to stand for the quantity allocation 
(qi ) for each supplier placed in a fixed position.

B. Genetic operators 
 
In order to maintain the genetic diversity for evolution, 
selection, crossover and mutation operators are utilized. The 
selection process selects two individuals or parents for 
crossover. Rank selection technique is used for this purpose. 
Once the parents are selected offspring are created by the 
use of the crossover operator. With the aim of ensuring the 
variety of the individuals so as to prevent local optimum 
solutions, mutation operator is induced.  Figure 4 
demonstrates the two-point crossover and the mutation 
operators used in this study. To preserve the best individuals 
in an attempt to shelter the population, elitist strategy is 
adapted when creating the new population.

C.  Fitness function 
Fitness value of a chromosome reveals its value 
compared to other individuals in terms of the defined 
objective. In this model, the fitness function is an 
arrangement of the measures unit and fixed purchasing 
prices, and preferences. Furthermore, diversity the total 
number of suppliers in the supplier set formed by the expert-
system.

The 
solution 
is 
reached 
through 
simultaneous 
minimization of those measures. Preference factor for each 
supplier is derived from the first stage expert system 
outputs. Unit price policies for different quantity ranges are 
prearranged for each supplier.

We consider a single-buy model with deterministic 
demand. One may consider this model as a make-to-order 
model with known demand, say D, for a specific 
component. That is, the total quantity allocated to the 
suppliers should be defined as
i
n

q

, where n is the total 
number of suppliers in the preferred list generated by the 
expert-system. Further, with a supplier capacity of SCi , 
quantity must also be limited by  
i

q  
  SC
 .    
Preference factors derived from the expert system are 
converted to numeric values through one to five, with five 
being the least preferred and one the most preferred score.  
We then use the preference factors of the suppliers as the 
weights of their costs. Then the objective function is

CASE STUDY 
The proposed method was coded in Microsoft Visual 
C++ with .NET Framework under Windows Vista. The 
model was then applied to a mid-size steel structures 
manufacturing company. The case selected for testing 
purposes was a strategic product with 12 potential suppliers. 
Some suppliers could meet the qualifications entirely and 
some partially. The input data related to the performance 
criteria in the model are given in Table III. 
The solution procedure followed the structure outlined in 
Figure 1. The initial determinant is the product category. As 
the user selects the strategic product option, the expert 
system will follow the decision-tree structure depicted in 
Figure 2. The output preference factors for each supplier are 
shown in Table IV. 
Since the maximum number of suppliers is limited by 
the company, the suppliers with the top preference scores 
are taken as input to the second phase of the model. The 
supply capacities, setup costs and price levels for different 
quantities for those suppliers are shown in Table V. Total 
demand of the product is given as 100 units.

Parameters and attributes related to the genetic algorithm 
are as follows: 
 
The population size is set to 50 
 
Rank selection is used for choosing the candidates for 
breeding. 
 
Two-point crossover is implemented. 
 
Crossover and mutation probabilities are set to 0.9 and 
0.2 accordingly.  
 
Elitist strategy is implemented.  
 
Maximum number of iterations is set as 250. 
Genetic algorithm was run with the above parameters 
and the best solution found in ten runs is shown in Table VI. 
The supplier base is composed of two suppliers: Supplier 1 
and Supplier 4. Supplier 1 scored “Very good” in quality, 
“Excellent” in delivery and “Very Good” in management, 
whereas Supplier 4 scored “Excellent” in quality, “Very 
Good” in delivery and “Excellent” in management aspects. 
The first supplier is assigned an order of 60% of demand (60 
units). With this amount, the order size is above the second 
price breakpoint and the company can benefit from the price 
advantage. Remaining demand (40 units) is allocated to 
Supplier 4, where the third price level policy may again be 
adapted.

Within the genetic optimization stage, the solution 
fitness scores at each iteration were analyzed. Figure 5 and 6 
demonstrate how the individuals persistently converged to 
better solutions, consistent with the genetic algorithms 
nature. While the first graph belongs to the population 
average progress, the second graph shows the evolution 
process of the best chromosome for ten runs.

Figure 6: Fitness evolution of the best solution 
 
Examination of the solutions proved that all solutions 
are feasible in terms of supplier capacities, demand and 
price polices. Criterion relating to quality, delivery, 
management, and price were considered simultaneously in 
decision of the final selection. The model showed strong 
tendency towards choosing the most appropriate suppliers in 
terms of quality, delivery and management as far as it would 
be economically reasonable. Furthermore, solutions also 
tempted to work with fewer but more reliable suppliers. 
These results verify the efficiency of the fitness function 
explained previously. 
It should be noted that heuristic algorithm solutions do 
not guarantee an optimal result. Nevertheless, reaching a 
result close to the optimal solution, to some extent, is 
essential. To test the algorithms performance in this 
perspective, best and worst solutions throughout the 
experimental runs were collected. These two values may 
imply the upper and the lower bounds of the feasible 
solution space.  
 
 
Figure 8: Solutions dispersion   
    
In Figure 8, dispersion of the best and the worst scores 
in ten runs are illustrated. It can be observed that, best 
solutions are scattered within the top 2% of the feasible 
solution space. With these facts, it can be concluded that the 
developed genetic algorithm conforms to the fundamental 
requirement of a heuristic and the developed method can be 
employed as an efficient decision support tool in order to 
help purchasing managers. 
 
VII. 
 CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes a new model integrating the expert 
system and the genetic algorithm to build the most 
appropriate supplier base. With the knowledge-based expert 
system potential suppliers are chosen with respect to quality, 
delivery and management dimensions and preference factors 
are assigned to each supplier. In the second phase order 
quantities are allocated to each supplier considering quantity 
discounts, preference factors and setup costs. A real-life 
case study at a steel structures manufacturing company 
illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology.  
As a future research, the model can be extended to tackle 
multi-product orders. Then, the model can be used for group 
decision making for a complete supplier base optimization.
