Abstract—Efforts
in
image
processing
and
pattern
recognition have been made in order to help improving the
detection accuracy by physicians. In this paper, we present
a analysis that study the use of Diversity Indexes in a
Spatial approach as a texture measure in order to distinguish
suspicious regions previously detected by segmentation scheme.
The description of the pattern is based on the fact that the
important features could be distributed on the region under
certain distance, angle and tonalities. And these tonalities
represents species that have a particular associations that
may be important distinctions between the pattern of mass
and non-mass regions helping do false positive reduction and
assisting a physician on a task of verify suspicious regions
on a mammogram. The computed measures are classiﬁed
through a Support Vector Machine and reaches a reduction
of 75% of false positives on mass detection methodology.

I. INTRODUCTION
According to the estimative of the American Cancer
Society (ACS), the chance of a woman having the breast
cancer in any period of her live is a just little below of
1 in 8, and the chances of dying from the disease is of
1 in 35 [1]. The screening mammography is the best way
for the precocious detection of any kind of lesion in breast,
also cancers. An earlier diagnosis improve the chances of
cure. It is also know that in early stages, the treatment
is more effective. The digitized mammogram is a image
that presents overlapping breast tissues obtained by the X-
ray exposure. The overlap and physiological characteristics
of the patient can generate a mammogram of low contrast
which could lead the physician a wrong diagnostic caused
by the repetitive task of analyzing the image [2].
Efforts has been made in the use of image processing
and pattern recognition techniques to improve the breast
cancer diagnosis results. The goal is to increase detection
and diagnostic accuracy providing a second opinion also
causing a reduction in the rate of false positive biopsies for
cases since the sensitivity of mammography exam is around
85% [3]. Mass detection methodologies based on image
processing generally has a step of false positive reduction.
This is aimed at decreasing the amount of the segmented
regions that were marked as suspected mass, when they are
actually normal tissues.
We have veriﬁed that the false positive reduction of the
tissues extracted from the mammogram as mass and non-
mass is a crucial stage in the methodologies for detection of
breast cancer and that there is a potential to be explored
in measurements that describe texture as the diversity
indexes applied in a spatial approach. This study began in
previous work of the group [4][5][6], which demonstrate the
effectiveness of these methods.
Also, the classiﬁcation of breast masses in mammography
images has motivated many research. Some surveys [7][8]
analysis different approaches published in literature. Most
approaches are based on the extraction of features such
as texture (statistics) [9][10][11], geometry (roundness,
sphericity, spicularity) [12][13][14][15], morphological or
nominal
(BI-RADS)
[16][17][18].
These
features
are
submitted to a classiﬁcation using a pattern-recognition
machine as Support Vector Machine or Neural Networks.
This work proposes the use of diversity indexes used
in Ecology (Total Diversity, Brillouin, Berger-Parker, J,
ED, Hill, Buzas-Gibson) in a spatial approach to describe
the patterns found in previously segmented images of
mammogram. The main goal is to propose an efﬁcient
methodology for reducing false positives and assist detection
methodologies that are used on Computer Aided Systems to
assist the physician on a task of detection breast cancer.
The remainder of this work is organized as follows.
Section II brings a brief introduction to Diversity Indexes.
Section III presents a detailed description of the proposed
methodology and evaluation used in this work. Section IV
presents and discusses about the founded results. Finally,
Section V presents the ﬁnal considerations.
II. DIVERSITY ANALYSIS
This work proposes a study of a texture extraction
for false positive reduction inspired in biological process
using diversity analysis. Following we present the Diversity
Indexes used as feature descriptor as well as the mapping
of this problem to a traditional image processing task.

This analysis intends to identify the distribution of a group
of species and their interrelations. It is used in Ecology
to measure the biodiversity in an ecosystem. The diversity
refers to the variety of species in a given community
or habitat. Biodiversity is the relationship between the
number of species (richness), the pattern of distribution of
individuals in their species (evenness) and the dominance
of one or more species among others (dominance). All
these characteristics can be measured and investigated using
indexes usually classiﬁed as coverage of local analysis
(alpha) or between various habitats (beta) [19].
More generally, the diversity indexes can be used to
measure the diversity of a population where each member
belongs to one single group or species. This paper intends to
study the use of Diversity indexes for false positive reduction
in pattern recognition process to distinguish mass and non-
mass ROI’s extracted from a digitalized mammography
image. With this goal we adopt that the pixels are the
individuals and their tonalities represents the set of specie.
Considering that each image ROI used has a distribution
of gray tones varying from 0 to 255 (8 bits per pixel).
Thus, any pixel x of image A have a specie si. The set
given by x0, x1, ..., xN represents the overall population P
where N is the total number of individuals and also of
pixels. The set S is the total amount of species of the set
s0, s1, ..., si where i represents a speciﬁc specie. The number
of individuals of each species is represented by ni and pi
is the total proportion of the sample belonging to species i,
that is pi = ni
N . This paper investigates the application of
the following diversity indexes for texture characterization
of mammography images.
The Total Diversity Index [20] estimates the total richness
of a population based on species variation. This measure is
given by:
Td =
S
X
i=1
wi(pi(1 − pi))
(1)
where wi is the weight or importance given individually to
a specie characterized by
1
ni .
The Brillouin Index [21] measures the richness of a known
population and it is recommended when that population is
not random. Also, this index tends to inform similar results
comparable to Shannon-Wienner’s Index [22] used in a not
completely known population. It is deﬁned by:
Hb = ( 1
N )(logN! −
S
X
i=1
logni!)
(2)
The Berger-Parker Index [23] is the numerical importance
of the most abundant species, deﬁned by:
Bp = max(ni)
N
(3)
where max(ni) is the amount of the most abundant specie.
The J Index [21] compares the observed Shannon-Wiener
Index against the distribution of individuals between the
observed species which would maximize diversity, and is
deﬁned by:
J = H
H′
(4)
where H is the Shannon-Wiener Index calculated by H =
− PS
i=1 piln pi
and his maximum value H′ is given by
H′ = logS.
The ED [20] Index compares the dominance of Simpson
with the known species that maximize the diversity. It is a
relation between Simpson index D and it’s maximum:
Ed = Ds
Ds′
(5)
where Ds is the Simpson Index [24] given by Ds =
PS
i=1 ni(ni−1)
N(N−1)
and his maximum dominance Ds′ calculated
by Ds′ = ( S−1
S ) ∗ (
N
N−1).
The Hill Index [25] calculates the equally abundance
distribution of the species, given by:
Hill =
1
Ds−1
eh − 1
(6)
where Ds and H are respectively the Simpson and Shannon-
Wienner’s Indexes previously explained. In this index, if the
species are equally abundant then the index should take the
maximum value. This value will decrease as the relative
abundance differ between species.
The Buzas-Gibson Index [26] indicates the degree of
evenness trough Shannon index H and is deﬁned by:
Bg = eH
S
(7)
where H is given by Shannon-Wienner’s Index.
III. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
The methodology proposed in this work intends to study
the uses of diversity indexes in a spatial approach to describe
breast segmented tissues and allow a discrimination of then
into mass and non-mass. The goal is to perform a false
positive reduction of a detection methodology previously
published in [27]. The methodology has ﬁve steps as
illustrated in Figure 1: ROI Acquisition, Enhancement,
Spatial Diversity Analysis (using the indexes previously
described),
Recognition
and
Validation.
Each
step
is
explained in the following text.
In order to test the proposed methodology, this work use
a database generated by a detection methodology published
in [27]. The ROI’s were segmented using a circular template-
matching technique. It detect the suspicious regions of
randomly extracted 603 mammograms obtained in Digital
Database Screening Mammography [28] each one containing
only one mass. It were generated a total number of 2679
suspicious regions, including all 603 masses and other 2076

non-masses. Figure 2 shows some examples of these regions.
We could note that mass regions are generally rounded,
has high and homogeneous pixel values at their core. Non-
mass regions has random contour. Their pixel distribution
values is less accentuated than a mass region. So they share
similar tonalities but mass regions are more concentrated
on high values whereas non-mass regions are more equally
distributed over many tonalities.

A. Enhancement
To produce an image with higher quality for the next
stages, it was applied for each region an histogram
equalization [29]. This step aims to make equally important
tones of gray to represent spatial and visual image. Also,
after the equalization of the image, six versions of each
sample were made through the scalar quantization using six
numbers of gray levels (28, 27, 26, 25, 24 and 23). This aims
to clustering similar tones of gray in order to enhance their
participation in the sample.
B. Spatial Diversity Texture Analysis
Each sample generated after the enhancement step was
submitted to a spatial texture analysis using the Diversity
Indexes presented in Section II. The spatial analysis
measures the autocorrelation between the points over a
certain localization or distance and even direction. Our goal
is to measure also the autocorrelation information besides
their diversity and use this information to create a pattern.
For this goal, we adopt three approaches to make the spatial
association: Rectangular, Circular and Directional.
1) Rectangular (HVDW): In this, the sample is divided
into tiles, using horizontal (H), vertical (V), diagonal (D)
and windows (W) like exempliﬁed in Figure 3. The image
was divided in 4 horizontal, vertical, diagonal tiles and 9
windows. Each resulting region is used separately.
Figure 3.
Rectangular scheme for split image region
2) Circular (CIRC-RING): Here the sample is analyzed
by circles of different radius r1, r2, ...rn and also rings
formed by the subtraction of two circles of different radius,
where r1 > r2, as exempliﬁed in Figure 4. It was used 5
different equidistant radius. They were obtained by dividing
the largest radius into ﬁve parts. The largest radius was
determined as the radius of the larger circle circumscribed in
the region. The use of ﬁve radius was deﬁned after empirical
tests.
Figure 4.
Circular scheme for split image region
3) Directional (DIR): This analysis [30] is done for each
pixel of the sample, that will become a Head point in
certain moment (See Figure 5a). In addition, to improve the
capacity of describing texture patterns, we have conducted a
directional analysis. For it, we must deﬁne a direction vector,
that is an azimuth which corresponds to an angle in x axis,
assuming a lag increasing rate. We assume tolerances for
lag and azimuth to better capture neighborhood in a matrix
arrangement of pixels. These restrictions are exempliﬁed in
Figure 5b.
In practice, for a speciﬁed direction, the features may
be computed for a number of lags and directions take in
consideration tolerances of lag and directions. We also split
the set of species in 4 sets without intersection, in order of
occurrence, to analyze the contribution of separate species to
form a pattern and increase the importance of rare species
that could have been obscured by the high occurrence of
other common specie. For each one, the initial lag separation
distance h was 1 pixel. After, this lag was incremented in
1 unity. The maximum number of lags chosen was 10. The
tolerance lag adopted was ±0.45.

C. Pattern Recognition using Support Vector Machines
In all spatial approaches described in Section III-B,
each set of spatial diversity features vectors generated
for each samples was classiﬁed using Support Vector
Machine (SVM) [31] as previous used on [5]. It is a
machine learning technique based on the creation of a
high dimensional hyperplane of separation optimizing the
limits of generalization. It uses radial kernel to mapping
characteristics to a high dimensional space where non linear
features could be separated. This kernel is deﬁned by:
K(x, y) = e−γ∥x−y∥2
(8)
where γ > 0 is a parameter that also is deﬁned by the user.
The process of classifying starts with a deﬁnition of a
set of training samples and test samples. For this study, the
training set for all approaches have the same samples to
make possible the approaches comparison. The training set
was formed by 400 samples of known mass and 400 samples
of known non-mass samples. The balancing is important
because of the large difference in number of samples non-
mass relative to the mass. The rest of samples was used as a
test set. Therefore, to prevent the classiﬁer tends to a certain
group, was held the balance amount of the samples.
SVM has the penalty parameter C that regulating the
classiﬁcation function for the best overall accuracy. This
parameter was calculated for each set of samples during the
training stage as the parameter γ for radial function. Also,
with the objective to give more importance classiﬁcation to
mass group, was adjusted weight penalty imposed on the
group represented to the value 15 in all classiﬁcations tests.
D. Validation
In order to evaluate the classiﬁer with respect to its
discrimination ability, this work were validated through
following metrics [32]:
• True positive rate (Tpr): percentage of masses correctly
classiﬁed;
• True negative rate (Tnr): percentage of non-masses
correctly classiﬁed, meaning false positive reduction;
• Mean false positive per image (Fp/i): average number of
false positive per image that remain after the reduction
process;
• Means false negative rate per image (Fn/i): average
number of incorrectly classiﬁed masses.
IV. RESULTS
This section intends to present and discuss the results
obtained from the proposed methodology. Table I presents
results of all executed tests for each approach. The best
outcome for this analysis happens when you have a large
reduction of false positives while the hit rate remains high
for mass group. Reduce false positives, but reduce the mass
hit rate implies to produce results that do not detect cancer.
The best result found reaches 75.81% reduction of false
positives (Tnr) with a rate of 93.53% of Tpr using DIR
approach and Berger-Parker index. This results means that
for the image database evaluated were generated 0.833
false positives in average and 13.195 masses were lost
during the step of reducing false positives, generating a
rate of 0.065 per image. Buzas-Gibson and Total Diversity
also shows similar results with the CIRC, RING and
HVDW approaches completing the best results found by
the proposed methodology. The differential of the approach
using directional Berger-Parker may be the division of
species into subgroups appropriate for this index that
quantiﬁes the importance of the most abundant species in
relation to other species.
Analyzing the other results we conclude that there is a
low variation in the settling of masses, represented by Tpr
averaging of 93.11%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
the diversity indexes jointly spatial approaches to correctly
represent the mass group. The same can not be said of the
hit rate of non-mass which obtained average variation of 6.7
percentage points. Analyzing how the indexes are obtained,
we conclude that the evenness indexes that represent the
abundance of the species over the population had difﬁculty
in presenting notable differences between mass and non-
mass patterns. One likely reason is the segmentation process,
executed in previous methodology. The resulting regions
are internally homogeneous, even in their borders. Even
though there are different species within each homogeneous
region. We observed that only 5 species occur only in
regions of mass and all others are shared. Also, the species
distribution in quantitative terms are very similar. Therefore,
if the population of the samples do not differ enough and
its distribution is similar, so evenness indexes will no be
able to effectively translate the patterns found. Unless we
use the information of the spatial distribution of species
to characterize then. In this sense, the spatial approach
becomes important to quantify mutual associations between
species and include this information in the process of pattern
recognition.

The Table II show the comparison of the best results
found by this work with the previous work from which was
obtained the image database. In previously work, the best
result was found using jointly geometry and texture features,
with the feature selection using a Genetic Algorithm. This
result was a false positive reduction of a 83.24%. Although
the reduction has been greater, we need to analyze the
amount of not detected mass drastically increases in 3 times.
So, in comparison with the other work, our methodology
ensures that the proposed approach maintains a substantial
reduction of false positives while maintaining a high hit rate
of mass.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper presented a research on the application of
diversity indexes and spatial approaches for the reduction
of false positives in mass detection methodologies under
digitized mammography’s regions. It has been shown that
these indexes can quantify with the aid of spatial approaches,
texture characteristics able to differentiate masses and non-
masses extracted from a image database generated by a
previous mass detection methodology.
The best result obtained, decrease at most of 75.81% of
false positives without signiﬁcant loss of mass accuracy rate.
Even the result of the lower accuracy attains a reduction of
52.98% of false positives. Compared with previous work,
this approach reduces false positive without interfering
signiﬁcantly in detecting masses. We can conclude that the
results are promising. But is still necessary to lower the false
negative rate, that corresponds a mass regions that are not
detected and harmful for a patient. In this methodology we
used SVM penalty functions to optimize the rate of mass
detection but this was insufﬁcient.
So, although we have obtained good results with this study
of diversity indexes applied in a spatial manner, we believe
that the reduction of false positives remains to be larger
to help permanently specialist. Therefore, as future works,
we will extend it using morphological approaches under
species to improve the pattern recognition step, also apply
feature selection and make more tests in different images
databases. Also implementing tools using this methodology
to be directly applied by physicians and test it’s performance
in real situations.
