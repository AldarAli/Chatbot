Abstract—This paper presents the development of a nonlinear 
control strategy for a robot manipulator model, using a robust 
higher order sliding mode control structure. In the present 
work, a traditional sliding mode control is presented, the 
robustness of the controller in the context of stabilization and 
trajectory tracking, is analytically proved using Lyapunov 
approach. In order to reduce the chattering in sliding mode 
controller (SMC) we used the higher order sliding mode 
control algorithm (Super twisting and Twisting). The 
simulation results presented in this paper indicate that the 
suggested approach has considerable advantages compared to 
the classical sliding mode control.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Variable structure systems with a sliding mode were 
discussed first in the Soviet literature [1], and have been 
widely developed in recent years. The sliding mode control 
(SMC) is a powerful method to control high-order nonlinear 
dynamic systems operating under uncertainty conditions 
[2][3]. A SMC law is designed such that the representative 
points’ trajectories of the closed-loop system are attracted to 
the sliding surface and once on the sliding surface they slide 
towards the origin. As the sliding surface is hit, the system 
response is governed by the surface dynamic; consequently, 
the robustness to the uncertainty or disturbance is achieved. 
In spite of claimed robustness properties, high frequency 
oscillations of the state trajectories around the sliding 
manifold known as chattering phenomenon [2][4] are the 
major obstacles for the implementation of SMC in a wide 
range of applications. 
Several methods of chattering reduction have been 
reported [5][6]. One approach [7] places a boundary layer 
around the switching surface such that the relay control is 
replaced by a saturation function. Another method higher 
order SMC [8][9][10], latter approach have been proposed 
for a Flexible Robot Arm in [11] [12]. The current papers 
result is based on this latter approach and its main idea can 
be described as follows: 
Let 
, 
s x t  (
n
x  is the state variable,t

 the time 
variable) be the sliding variable and r
 N
the sliding order. 
The control forces to zero in finite time s and its 
r  1
 
first higher time derivatives by acting discontinuously on 
the rth time derivative of s . Keeping the main advantages 
of standard SMC, the chattering effect is eliminated and 
higher order precision is provided. In the case of “real” 
SMC [9], if   is the sampling time, the error is  
o  in the 
case of standard SMC [13] whereas it is 

o  r
in the rth 
order SMC [14]. 
In the case of second order SMC (
r  2
), many works 
have given solutions. Several second order sliding mode 
algorithms are proposed in [9][14][15] [16]. 
The present paper proposes a multi-input multi-output 
(MIMO) second order sliding mode strategy, for this 
purpose we have chosen as an application PUMA 560 robot 
manipulator with three degrees of freedom model obtained 
using Lagragian’s equations [17]. The proposed controller 
based on sliding mode control approach. 
The paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 introduces a 
general PUM 560 robot manipulator model. Section 3 
presents traditional sliding mode controller design. Section 
4 displays the design of the second order SMC (the Twisting 
and de Super Twisting algorithm). Section 5 presents the 
simulation results obtained with the full dynamic model. 
Finally, we present the comparative study to show the 
effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control 
strategy.

SLIDING MODE CONTROLLER DESIGN 
This section focuses on the design of a sliding mode 
control for the stabilization of nonlinear systems; we will 
apply it on a highly nonlinear system which is the PUMA 
560 robot manipulator. This control must meet the 
specifications defining the objectives, including stability, 
speed, accuracy and robustness. The simulations are 
performed in the case of trajectory tracking, and we passed 
the drop test load as the test of robustness. The PUMA 560 
robot model without taking into account the effect of the 
load is as follows: 
 
Mq Vm .
q
G

(10) 
This model describes the dynamics of a robot 
manipulator with three degrees of freedom, which requires 
the synthesis of three controls, and as each joint is 
considered as a subsystem whose relative degree is 
ir  2
, 
which means that each surface
is  is of order

ir  . And the 
error e is defined by:

From property (1), the matrix M  is positive definite, and 
we also 
V  0

. So, according to the study of 
Lyapunov stability, the system is stable when, 
V  0

IV. 
2-SLIDING MODE CONTROLLER DESIGN 
The problem of 2-sliding mode control is to constrain 
the trajectories of the system to evolve on the sliding

From the simulations results, we can find that the control 
result of conventional sliding mode controller produces a 
serious chattering phenomenon, Figure 2. 
On the other hand, the chattering phenomenon of the 
controlled system is suppressed in the case of Super 
Twisting algorithm controller (Figure 4). Moreover, the 
proposed controller is a robust controller since the load 
drops hasn’t influence on the control performances. 
To compare the performance of 2-sliding controller with 
SMC, we define tow cost functions

Comparing the simulation results, it can be said that the 
proposed control strategy, second order SMC (Super 
Twisting algorithm), gave better performance than using the 
conventional sliding mode controller. 
VII. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, a second order SMC is proposed for a 
PUMA 560 robot manipulator system and simulation results 
are presented. Firstly, the classical sliding mode control of 
PUMA 560 robot manipulator system is developed. 
Secondly, the second order SMC control is used to smooth 
the discontinuous control term in order to alleviate the 
chattering phenomenon. The simulation results presented in 
this paper indicate that the suggested approach has 
considerable advantages compared to the classical sliding 
mode control. As future works, we would like making an 
experimental study of the control approach on a real robot 
manipulator.
