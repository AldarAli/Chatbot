Abstract— A major drawback of Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals is the extremely high 
Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). Constant Amplitude 
Zero Auto Correlation (CAZAC) precoding can dramatically 
improve the PAPR of OFDM signals, i.e., up to the same PAPR 
value of single carrier signals with the same modulation scheme. 
One negative point of the CAZAC precoding technic is not being 
able to meet the current wireless standards, which usually 
require a null subcarrier allocated on the center of data 
subcarriers. In this paper, we demonstrate the CAZAC-OFDM 
which completely satisfies the 4G-LTE standard by using the 
proposed allocation method for a null subcarrier without 
degrading the PAPR and the Bit-Error-Rate.  
Keywords- OFDM; CAZAC; null subcarrier; PAPR;.

INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, with the rapid spread of wireless LAN and 
mobile communication terminals, such as smart phones, 
tablets, etc., the demand for wireless communication is 
expanding. However, since the capacity of the data is also 
increasing, it is a problem that there are few available 
frequency bands. Therefore, research on Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) system is progressing 
because it is the modulation scheme that can provide high 
spectral efficiently. By using OFDM systems, high-speed 
communication can be realized under limited frequency bands 
as compared with other modulation schemes, and OFDM 
system is currently adopted in downlink of the mobile 
communication system [1]. On the other hand, OFDM has the 
demerits of the high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). 
The high PAPR causes a decrease in the average power of the 
transmission signal, resulting in lowering of the energy 
efficiency of the power amplifiers and the shortened operation 
time causes a serious problem in battery-powered wireless 
terminals. 
A new PAPR reduction technique with Constant 
Amplitude Zero Auto Correlation (CAZAC) equalization was 
recently proposed [2].  
Our research group have demonstrated that CAZAC 
precoding can reduce the PAPR without any degradation of 
BER performances [3], and have also provided available 
control procedure for PAPR and spectrum managements for 
the CAZAC-OFDM system [4]. Unfortunately, the CAZAC-
OFDM is not able to meet the current wireless standards, 
which usually require a null subcarrier allocated on the center 
of data subcarriers. The main reason of this subcarrier which 
is named the DC-subcarrier is to avoid DC-offset for received 
signal processing ease. In an ordinary OFDM system, each 
subcarrier carries independent information. On the other hand, 
by using CAZAC precoding, every information-data is 
spreading over subcarriers and every subcarrier shares all 
information-data. This peculiar feature, however, hinders the 
allocation of a null subcarrier, whereas, in case of ordinary 
OFDMs, it is easily allocated a null subcarrier by inputting 
null-data instead of information-data. 
This paper proposes a method for null subcarrier 
allocation in the  Constant Amplitude Zero Auto Correlation 
OFDM systems (CAZAC-OFDM systems). The method is to 
replace the CAZAC precoding data for the center subcarrier 
by null-data. This means that the information carried by the 
center subcarrier is dropped. Fortunately, since the CAZAC-
OFDM has a frequency diversity effect, the dropped 
information is effectively recovered. 
 We will demonstrate that the CAZAC-OFDM system 
with proposed null subcarrier allocation method fulfills the 
requirements of the PAPR and the Bit-Error-Rate for 4G-LTE 
standard.  
Section 2 describes the OFDM system and Section 3 
describes the CAZAC precoding technic and proposal system. 
Section 4 then performs simulation verification and concludes 
in Section 5. 
 
II. 
OFDM SYSTEM 
This section describes existing OFDM systems. 
A. PAPR 
OFDM system is a form of multicarrier modulation and a 
communication system by OFDM can use frequency 
efficiently. In an OFDM transmitter, an Inverse Fast Fourier 
Transform (IFFT) is performed after primary modulation of 
a data sequence. As a result, the value after primary 
modulation is placed on each subcarrier, and a spectrum is 
formed in which each subcarrier overlaps. Even if each 
subcarrier overlaps, due to mutual orthogonality, respectively 
demodulation is possible, so that frequency utilization 
efficiency is excellent. 
The 𝑁 th sample with the input signal 𝑋 (length 𝑁) after 
mapping is defined as (1) [5]. 
𝑥𝑛 = 1
𝑁 ∑ 𝑋𝑘𝑒𝑗2𝜋

Where 𝑋𝑘 is the frequency-domain signal, and 𝑁 is the 
number of subcarriers, 𝑗 = √−1 . After IFFT, a guard

interval is inserted in the baseband signal. The OFDM 
symbol is generated by the above procedure. In particular, the 
value after IFFT when n=0 in (1) disappears the imaginary 
part, and only the real part remains as (2). 
𝑥𝑛 = 1
𝑁 ∑ 𝑋𝑘
𝑁−1
𝑘=0
 
(2) 
The PAPR of the OFDM signal (1) can be expressed as 
𝑃𝐴𝑃𝑅 =
max
0≤𝑛≤𝑁−1|𝑥𝑛|2
E[|𝑥𝑛|2]
, 
(3) 
where E[∙]  is expectation operator. PAPR represents 
amplitude fluctuation of each symbol.  
As shown from by (1), the OFDM signal is composed of 
a plurality of subcarrier signals, which causes an increase in 
amplitude fluctuation. A high PAPR signal increases the Input 
Back Off (IBO) at the power amplifier in order to amplify the 
transmit signal without distortion. Increasing in IBO causes 
decreasing the efficiency of PA. 
 Figure 1 shows the OFDM time domain signal. While 
OFDM can make effectively utilize the limited frequency 
domain, a very large peak power is generated in the time 
domain. The more OFDM uses subcarriers, the more PAPR 
will be increased. 
 
Figure 1. OFDM signals in time domain. 
 
In order to reduce the PAPR, well-known techniques are 
clipping-and-filtering, partial transmit sequences (PTSs), and 
selected mapping (SLM)[6]. Clipping-and-filtering limits the 
peak amplitude of the transmission signal. However, non-
linear distortion causes BER to degrade. PTS partitions input 
data into disjoint sub-blocks. Moreover, each sub-block are 
weighted by a phase factor. This technique chooses the phase 
factor to minimize the PAPR of combined signals. SLM 
generates multiple candidate data blocks. All data blocks 
represent the same information. Although PTS and SLM can 
be expected to create a certain reduction in PAPR, both 
techniques need side information in the receiver, which 
decreases spectral efficiency. The most practical solution to 
improving PAPR is to introduce single carrier frequency 
division multiplexing access (SC-FDMA). The 3GPP LTE 
system adopts SC-FDMA for uplink multiple access systems. 
However, SC-FDMA has not been considered to be suitable 
for next-generation high-speed communications. Therefore, 
we should reduce PAPR without any degradation of various 
performances 
B. Null subcarrier 
Communication standards that make use of OFDM, on 
the transmitting side, data is not placed on the relevant part 
beforehand, and zero padding is performed so that the real 
component is designed to be zero. 
Figure 2 shows the transmission spectrum of OFDM with 
Null subcarrier inserted.  
 
Figure 2. Null subcarrier of OFDM spectrum. 
 
Since the data placed on the subcarrier corresponding to 
the part of 0Hz, which is the element which becomes the real 
part in the FFT processing on the receiving side is made null 
beforehand as the null subcarrier.

CAZAC-OFDM SYSTEM 
This section describes the features of the CAZAC-
OFDM system. 
A. CAZAC precoding technique 
Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence is one of the CAZAC 
sequence. The ZC sequence 𝐶𝑘 of length L is defined as (4). 
 
𝐶𝑘 =
{  
  𝑒𝑥𝑝 (𝑗𝜋𝑘(𝑘 − 1)𝑟
𝐿
) (𝐿 is even)
𝑒𝑥𝑝 (𝑗𝜋(𝑘 − 1)2𝑟
𝐿
) (𝐿 is odd) 
  
(4) 
Where 𝐿  is the length of the CAZAC sequence and 𝑟  is 
the sequence number, 𝑘 = 1, 2, ⋯ 𝑁2. 𝐿 is a natural number, 
and 𝑟  is a prime integer with respect to 𝐿 . 
CAZAC precoding uses a square matrix 𝑀  generated 
from the equation in the case where 𝐿  in (4) is an even 
number. The matrix equation is defined as (5). 
 
𝑀 = [

(5) 
Where matrix 𝑀 is the rearrangement of Ck in  (4) in the 
row direction, and 𝑁 is the number of subcarriers and 𝐿 =
 𝑁2, 𝑟 = 1. 𝑁  is an even number, and 𝐿  is also an even 
number. 
Figures 3 and 4 show the block diagrams of CAZAC-
OFDM transmitter and receiver, respectively. On the 
transmitting side of CAZAC-OFDM, CAZAC precoder is 
inserted before IFFT.

While, on the receiving side of CAZAC-OFDM, 
CAZAC decoder is inserted after FFT and calculates the 
inner product of the received symbol Y in frequency domain 
and CAZAC inverse matrix 𝑀−1. 
According to Figure 3, 𝑋 is QAM Vector, P is Modulation 
Vector for IFFT, 𝑀 is CAZAC Matrix. Then S as

 Where 𝑘 is an integer not less than 0, and the following 
equation is developed.

To lead the (9) from the (8).

When 2𝜋(𝑚 + 𝑛)/𝑁 = 1 , 2(𝑚 + 𝑛)/𝑁  is an integer and 
odd number. Also, n and 𝑚 are

relationships.

From the above, we have theoretically derived 
 for 
arbitrary n. The time waveform of CAZAC-OFDM is 
obtained by phase-rotating the value after mapping such as 
Figure 5. Therefore, PAPR can be reduced to a single carrier 
equivalent without using side information and without 
degrading BER characteristics. This is ideal as an 
improvement to PAPR. 
 In OFDM systems, cyclic prefixes are used to prevent 
inter-symbol interference [8][9]. And certainly, this 
technique can use cyclic prefix without disadvantages.

the value after mapping. 
 
B. Frequency diversity effect of CAZAC-OFDM 
By using CAZAC precoding for OFDM, it has a strong 
resistance to interference waves of a specific frequency. We 
consider the case where the signal of a specific subcarrier is 
lost due to frequency selective fading. In an ordinary OFDM 
system, each subcarrier has only one 𝑋 component like 
Figure 6(a). Therefore, under the frequency selective fading, 
a specific subcarrier is strongly affected, and this specific 
data suffers serious damage like Figure 6 (b). As a result, 
BER deteriorates.

Figure 6. The example of subcarrier deterioration of ordinary OFDM. 
 
On the other hand, in a CAZAC-OFDM system, each 
subcarrier is possessing all 𝑋  component averagely like 
Figure 7(a). Even if a narrow-band interference wave strongly 
affects a specific subcarrier, the influence of it is uniformly 
distributed to each data like Figure 7(b), and BER would be 
improved [10].

Thus, it's assumed that a CAZAC-OFDM system can 
reduce the influence of affected subcarriers by spreading 𝑋 
components to all subcarriers. This effect is due to the 
expression of CAZAC precoding signal 𝑃 before IFFT. From 
(6), IFFT input signal for subcarrier is shown as (14). 
 
𝑃𝑛 = ∑ 𝐶𝑛(𝑁+𝑘)𝑋𝑘
𝑁−1
𝑘=0
 
𝑃𝑛 = 𝐶𝑛𝑁𝑋0 + 𝐶𝑛(𝑁+1)𝑋1 + 𝐶𝑛(𝑁+2)𝑋2 + ⋯ 
+𝐶𝑛(2𝑁−1)𝑋𝑁−1 
(14) 
As shown in (14), 𝑃𝑛 includes terms of all 𝑋 components, 
i.e. 𝑋0, 𝑋1, 𝑋2, … , 𝑋𝑁−1. This means that each subcarrier is 
possessing all 𝑋 component. Thus, the CAZAC-OFDM has a 
nature of spread-spectrum just like a CDMA. 
 
C. Null subcarrier allocation method for CAZAC-OFDM 
In CAZAC-OFDM, all subcarriers have all data 
components averagely. At the same time, it means that the null 
subcarrier can’t be placed at the center of the frequency 
spectrum. Therefore, in this state OFDM cannot be applied to 
the current wireless standard. 
In an ordinary OFDM system, zero-padding is performed 
on DC subcarrier in advance to obtain a null subcarrier, 
thereby setting the DC component to zero as (15). 
 
𝑋′ = [
0
𝑋1 
⋮
𝑋𝑁−1 
] 
(15) 
On the other hand, in CAZAC-OFDM, if an operation as 
shown by (6) is performed on the original data information, 
when zero padding is performed in the same way as in 
ordinary OFDM, zero can’t be generated in the CAZAC 
precoded signal as shown in (16), and it cannot be set as a null 
subcarrier.

⋮
𝑐(𝑁−1)𝑁+1 ∙ 0 + ⋯ 𝑐𝑁2 ∙ 𝑋𝑁−1 = 𝑋′𝑚𝑁 ≠ 0
]
 
 
 
 
(16) 
Furthermore, if the size of the CAZAC matrix and the size 
of the IFFT do not match, the PAPR reduction effect can’t be 
obtained. It means that IDFT must be performed including DC 
subcarriers. Therefore, the number of data subcarriers is 
increased by one compared to conventional OFDM. Thus, in 
order to use CAZAC-OFDM with the number of subcarriers 
of the current standard, it is necessary to use IDFT. Although 
the computational complexity O(𝑛2) of the DFT is larger than 
the computational complexity O(𝑛𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑛) of the FFT, it can be 
ignored considering the progress of the processor.  
In the proposed system, DC subcarrier is set as null 
subcarrier while maintaining the orthogonality of the CAZAC 
sequence by performing the process of setting P1 in (6) to zero. 
This process means that one data is lost, but CAZAC-OFDM 
can reduce adverse influence of affected subcarriers by 
spreading influence to all subcarriers. By using this frequency 
diversity effect of CAZAC-OFDM, lost data is demodulated. 
 
IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
This chapter describes simulation specifications and 
results. 
A. Simulation specification 
To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, 
simulation was performed according to the specifications in 
Table 1. The simulation is performed in MATLAB using 
communications system toolbox. We compared the CCDF 
characteristics between ordinary OFDM and proposed method 
using the number of subcarriers used in the IEEE802.11ac 
standard. Next, the BER characteristics were compared while 
changing the value of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 
AWGN. At this time, fading is not taken into consideration. 
After that, we carried out the same comparison using the 
number of subcarriers used in the 4G-LTE standard. 
For the forward error correction code and decoding, 
convolutional codes with coding rate  𝑅 = 1/2, constraint 
length 𝐾 = 7 and Viterbi decoding were applied. 
Looking at Table 1, the number of data subcarriers in the 
conventional OFDM is one less than the number of proposed 
systems because transmission is performed without carrying 
data on DC subcarriers. On the other hand, although the DC 
subcarrier is set to be zero in the proposed system, it is 
demodulated using the frequency diversity effect, so it does 
not decrease the number of data subcarriers. Thus, the data 
rate of the proposed method is slightly improved as compared 
with ordinary OFDM.

B. Simulation Results 
First, we compare the OFDM and the proposed system for 
the CCDF characteristics and BER characteristics using the 
number of subcarriers used in the IEEE802.11ac standard as 
Figures 9 and 10. Here, conventional CAZAC-OFDM means 
it has no null subcarrier. 
 
Figure 9. CCDF characteristics in the IEEE 802.11ac standard 
 
 
Figure 10. BER characteristics in the IEEE 802.11ac standard 
 
Looking at Figure 9, by using the Null subcarrier 
allocation method like the proposed system, it is found that the 
proposed method can obtain CCDF characteristics almost the 
same as the ideal CAZAC-OFDM which does not adopt the 
DC subcarrier as Null. Therefore, it can be said that the 
proposed method can make the DC subcarrier Null without 
impairing the PAPR reduction effect of CAZAC-OFDM, and 
PAPR can be improved by about 4 dB when compared with 
CCDF characteristics of conventional OFDM. 
Looking at Figure 10, at first, the CAZAC precoding 
process does not adversely affect the error correction by the 
convolutional code. Next, comparing the BER characteristics 
of ordinary OFDM and the proposed method, we can see that 
the BER of the proposed method is slightly deteriorating. This 
is because the data of the DC subcarrier is lost when the DC 
subcarrier is set to Null, and therefore the influence thereof 
appears even if the frequency diversity effect is used. 
From the above results, it can be said that the proposed 
method in the IEEE802.11ac standard is a method which can 
obtain slight improvement of data rate and dramatic 
improvement of CCDF characteristics in exchange for slight 
deterioration of BER characteristic compared to conventional 
OFDM. 
Next, similar comparisons using the number of subcarriers 
used in the 4G-LTE standard are shown in Figures 11 and 12. 
At this time, the spectrum of the proposed system with null 
subcarrier arranged is shown in the figure 13. 
 
Figure 11. CCDF characteristics in the 4G-LTE standard 
 
 
Figure 12. BER characteristics in the 4G-LTE standard 
 
 
Figure 13. CAZAC-OFDM spectrum with null subcarrier arranged 
 
Comparing Figure 11 with Figure 9, CAZAC-OFDM 
shows no change in CCDF characteristics even if the number 
of subcarriers increases. This is because CAZAC-OFDM uses 
the power pattern of QAM mapping as the output power after 
IFFT processing without depending on the number of 
subcarriers. On the other hand, since the conventional OFDM 
multiplexes a plurality of subcarriers intact, the peak power 
thereof increases with an increase in the number of subcarriers.

Therefore, the PAPR also increases with the number of 
subcarriers, which shows that the PAPR is very high in the 
4G-LTE standard where the number of subcarriers is 1200. It 
means that PAPR can be improved as the number of 
subcarriers increases compared with OFDM in the proposed 
method, and here we can see that PAPR can be improved by 
about 7dB. 
Looking at Figure 12, It was found that the BER 
performance of the proposed method is almost consistent with 
that of ordinary OFDM regardless of whether or not error 
correction is performed. Compared to Figure 10, it can be said 
that the frequency diversity effect by CAZAC precoding 
becomes more powerful as the number of subcarriers is larger, 
and in the 4G-LTE standard, the negative influence generated 
when the DC subcarrier is made Null is ignored. From the 
above results, it can be said that the proposed method in the 
4G-LTE standard can improve the data rate slightly and 
dramatically improve the CCDF characteristics while 
maintaining the same BER characteristic as the conventional 
OFDM. 
From these results, it was found that the BER 
characteristics differed depending on the number of 
subcarriers. Here, it is evaluated how much the deterioration 
degree of the BER characteristic with respect to the number of 
subcarriers under the simulation specification similar to Table 
1 is. The difference in SNR at the error rate 10-3 point when 
only the number of data subcarriers is changed is shown in 
Figure 14. We evaluated using 234, 468 data subcarriers used 
in the IEEE802.11ac standard, 1200 subcarriers used in the 
4G-LTE standard and subcarriers between them. 
 
Figure 14. Degree of degradation of BER characteristics with respect 
to the number of data subcarriers 
 
From this figure, when the proposed method is applied 
using 234 subcarriers, which is the medium-band transmission 
mode of the IEEE 802.11ac standard, the BER performance 
will be deteriorated by about 1.76 dB compared to ordinary 
OFDM. And it is difficult to say that it is practical. It is about 
0.26 dB worse in the case of 468 subcarriers which is the 
broadband transmission mode, which can be said to be a 
practical range considering that PAPR can be greatly 
improved if this degree is deteriorated. And at 1000 
subcarriers, the degradation of BER characteristics was not 
completely seen. 
It has resulted that only advantages are obtained in mobile 
communication exceeding 1000 subcarriers and terrestrial 
digital broadcasting. In recent years, communication using a 
large number of subcarriers tends to be performed in order to 
enable further high-speed communication, including a 
wireless LAN. This is a promising trend for the proposed 
system. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In CAZAC-OFDM that reduces high PAPR while taking 
advantage of OFDM, PAPR can be reduced while zero DC 
component by applying Null subcarrier placement method 
utilizing frequency diversity effect. It means that CAZAC-
OFDM can be adapted to current wireless standards. 
Moreover, it is confirmed that the deterioration of the BER 
characteristic decreases as the number of subcarriers increases. 
As a result, in the 4G-LTE standard, we confirmed that the 
proposed system can be used without degrading BER while 
suppressing PAPR to the equivalent of single carrier. These 
results meet recent trends that are changing from narrowband  
transmission to broadband transmission in order to transmit 
data with large amount of information at high speed.
