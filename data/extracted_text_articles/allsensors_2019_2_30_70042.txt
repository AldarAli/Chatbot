Abstract— This contribution presents a novel low-cost approach 
to interrogation of short cavity Fabry-Perot optical fiber sensors 
and their  use for pressure measurements in a combustion cham-
ber of a petrol or diesel engine. The optical fiber sensor interro-
gation system is based on laser diodes with different wave-
lengths. Reflectance from Fabry-Perot sensors at three different 
wavelengths was observed to determine the cavity length, using 
specially developed signal processing algorithms. The interroga-
tion system was evaluated statically and dynamically. It is shown 
that the interrogation system has a resolution of about 2 nm and 
bandwidth of 16 kHz. Two sensor designs were studied and eval-
uated in both the laboratory environment and in a combustion 
chamber of the engine. Both sensor designs are executed on the 
tip of the optical fiber, with etching, cleaving and splicing of spe-
cial optical fibers.

 INTRODUCTION 
Stricter ecological demands from the authorities and lower 
fuel consumption demands from the consumers of the cars 
with Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) are forcing the au-
tomotive industry into development and production of more 
efficient engines with lower emissions in the environment 
[1]. Research in both academia and industry is focused to 
achieve those goals [1]-[4], with, but not limited to: Down-
sizing of the engines, supercharging, variable controlled 
valves, novel fuels or their mixtures, etc. An important part 
of ICE are their sensors; information from them serves the 
electronic control unit for optimization of combustion and, 
consequently, lowering both consumption and emissions. In-
cylinder pressure sensors have been investigated for a few 
decades, due to the rich nature of information that we can ex-
tract from the pressure curve. But, even after decades of re-
search, the design of a low-cost pressure sensor, which would 
fulfil the price requirements of the automotive industry to im-
plement it in the low and mid cost series production cars, 
which are responsible for a large part of global emissions, 
proved to be challenging. On the other hand, optical fiber sen-
sors are known for their durability and reliability in harsh en-
vironments. Very often, they offer superior properties in 
terms of resolution and speed. Optical fiber sensors are con-
nected to an interrogation unit, which is responsible for con-
version of  the measured parameter to a desired output, and 
is, as much as the sensors, responsible for the properties of 
the optical fiber measurement system. Commonly, the inter-
rogation unit represents the bigger part of the cost of the op-
tical fiber sensor system, and, due to its cost, optical fiber 
sensors have not made a breakthrough in  consumer applica-
tions. 
We present a new, low-cost method to interrogate a short 
cavity optical fiber Fabry-Perot (FP) sensor. While most of 
the reliable methods for interrogation of fiber FP sensors are 
based on wavelength sweep or wavelength filtering, our ap-
proach is based on only three different wavelengths. FP opti-
cal fiber sensors are involved in Metrology due to their low 
cost of production and a wide range of possible uses [5].  
In Section 2 the theoretical background of the interroga-
tion system will be presented, followed  by the physical con-
figuration of the system in Section 3. Section 4 will provide 
a short program description. Sensor mounting will be pre-
sented in section 5, followed by Results and Discussion in 
Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, conclusions and further work 
will be presented.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INTERROGATION 
SYSTEM 
Interrogation of FP optical fiber sensors is a well-known 
problem, which is solved mainly with expensive equipment, 
inappropriate for our application. Most of them are  based on 
a wavelength tuneable source or optical spectral analyzer. If 
we measure the wavelength response of an FP sensor, we get 
a “lifted sinusoid” response, from which we can determine

with great accuracy the length of the interferometer. Our ap-
proach is based on three laser diodes with different wave-
lengths. We measure sensors` reflectance at different wave-
lengths with a photodiode, which is given by (1).

) 
 
 
𝑦2 = 𝐴 (1 + 𝐵𝑐𝑜𝑠4𝜋 𝐿

yx – response from a given wavelength 
A – amplitude of the sinusoid 
B – offset of the sinusoid 
L – length of the FP cavity 
λx – wavelength of the given laser diode 
 
Solving (1) gives us (2) and (3) which are solutions for A, B: 
 
𝐴 =

𝐵 =
𝑦1 − 𝑦2
𝑦2𝑐𝑜𝑠4𝜋 𝐿

The length of the FP cavity is calculated with Newton’s gra-
dient method as seen in (4) and (5). 
 
 
𝐹(𝐿) = 𝑘 (𝑐𝑜𝑠4𝜋 𝐿

𝐿𝑘 = 𝐿𝐾−1 − 𝐹(𝐿)/𝐹(𝐿)′ 
(5) 
For known wavelengths of the laser diodes, we can calculate 
the length of the FP interferometer.

PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION OF THE PROPOSED 
SYSTEM 
The electro-optical configuration of the proposed interro-
gation system is presented in Figure 1. The system is built 
around a specially designed optical module consisting of  
three Fabry-Perot laser diodes, packed in a housing with op-
tical elements providing good coupling into an SM fiber. The 
optical fiber is connected to the 50:50 2X2 optical fiber cou-
pler, which splits the light into two equivalent parts. One part 
of the light goes to the photodetector for monitoring transmit-
ted light, and the second goes to the sensor, which reflects 
some of the light back to the coupler. Half of the reflected 
light goes back to laser diodes and is lost, the other half goes 
to the second photo diode for monitoring reflected light. 
The electronic part of the system is based on a microcon-
troller (PIC 32MZ family), which controls all the components 
described below. The design must provide us with sequential 
powering of the laser diodes with adjustable current. This is 
achieved with three equal electronic circuits consisting of a 
digital potentiometer, voltage buffer, digital switch, and a 
current driver with mosfet transistor. Such layout enables se-
rial switching of the laser diodes on and off in the range of 
tens of microseconds. The detector side consists of two stand-
ard optical fiber coupled photodiodes and  transimpedance

amplifiers with gains of 87 thousand and 2 million, for meas-
uring the transmitted light and reflected light from the sensor, 
respectively. Signals from the amplifiers are routed to the mi-
crocontrollers` AD converter pins.  
Two types of optical fiber pressure sensors are considered, 
both  micromachined on the top of the standard SM optical 
fiber. First is the so-called needle sensor [6], as depicted in 
Figure 3 (b). The needle sensor was initially meant for strain 
measurements. Responsivity of a needle sensor with a 400 µm 
long gutter is about 2 nm/bar. Its production process is appro-
priate for massive production and, therefore, the needle is our 
first choice. The second sensor is a membrane pressure sensor 
[7], Figure 3 (a) . Its production process is more complex, but 
design of the structure is better, because it`s similar to some 
classical pressure sensors. Also, the responsivity can be set in-
dividually during the production process.  
IV. 
SHORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 
The program is a crucial part of the whole system because 
it must run fast enough to provide enough throughput of the 
whole system. Stable timing is achieved with timers and inter-
rupts. Four switching states are implemented, as depicted in 
Figure 2, three for when  each laser diode is turned on, and 
one when all diodes are turned off and we measure the dark 
optical power. This had to be implemented due to the optical 
power from combustion coupling into the fiber. Proper timing 
of the analog-digital conversion is also ensured with timers 
and interrupts. After all samples are taken, we start the algo-
rithm for calculation of the length of the FP cavity. First, re-
sults are averaged with the number of samples taken in one 
state. After that they are “normalized”. Responses have  unde-
sired offsets and different amplitudes for different wave-
lengths, therefore, we must normalize all the signals to an even 
interval throughout the complete measuring range for all three 
wavelengths. Finally, we use equations 4 and 5 to determine 
the length of the cavity. With measured length of the cavity, 
responsivity of the sensor and initial length of the cavity, we 
calculate the pressure.

SENSOR MOUNTING 
We designed a similar insert to the industry standard probe 
for measuring pressure in the combustion chamber (from the 
company AVL LIST GmbH). Redesigned and finished sen-
sors are depicted in Figure 4. Bonding of fiber to the insert 
has proven to be difficult due to the high temperatures and 
pressures. Primarily, tests with two component epoxy adhe-
sives were executed, but under high pressures the sensor fiber

was excreted. Excretion was solved with usage of EPO-TEK 
353ND. This joint has proven to be suitable for temperatures 
up to 350°C.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The interrogation system was evaluated in laboratory condi-
tions under both static and dynamic conditions. Static testing 
was performed with a needle sensor being stretched. The sen-
sor forming fiber was left long enough to glue it to a linear 
stage, while the lead in fiber was glued to a stationary block 
of aluminum. The aluminum block and linear stage were se-
cured on the optical table with screws. With moving of the 
linear stage, we got the results from the interrogation system 
given in the   following graph. As seen in Figure 5, the inter-
rogation system has a very good linearity over an almost 1 
micrometre span. 
Dynamic testing was performed with the needle sensor 
glued to a PZT stack. The PZT stack was excited with a 140 
Hz square signal.As seen in Figure 6, 2, nanometres of noise 
are presented at 16 kHz sampling, considering the typical 
sensitivity of the membrane sensor we achieved noise of 500 
mbar.After validation of the interrogation system, tests in the 
engine followed. 
Test were performed on a Toyota 4Y ECS engine, fuelled 
with natural gas. This type of engine was developed for in-
dustrial forklifts. The engine was mounted on the test bench 
and coupled with an engine brake. We tested under different 
brake torques: 45 Nm, 100Nm and 115 Nm. Engine speed 
was 1500 rpm. The pressure curve acquired with the needle 
sensor is partially valid only during periods of high pressure, 
but in the periods of gas exchange, it is very distorted, due to 
rapid temperature changes, as the outer side of the structure 
got heated more than the inner pedestal. Therefore, false read-
ings of pressure were acquired due to the uneven thermal ex-
pansion of the complete structure. Additionally, we had some 
difficulties with vibrations on the needle sensor due to high 
frequency vibrations introduced by the engine, so we needed

to set the distance between the epoxy adhesive and the struc-
ture to such a length that those effects were minimized. 
The following is the pressure measured with the membrane 
sensor after it has been inserted in the combustion chamber 
for 100 working hours. It has been observed that sensors do 
not age in this time period. The pressure curve in Figure 7 is 
valid throughout the complete combustion cycle.  
VII. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK 
This paper presented a low-cost interrogation system with 
corresponding sensors for pressure measurements under ex-
treme conditions of a combustion chamber in automotive ap-
plications. Simple construction of the complete system and, 
therefore, minimum components, are used to achieve low 
cost design with good reliability. 
The system was tested both under laboratory conditions 
and in a  real engine. Resolution of 2 nm was shown, which 
matches 0.5 bar. 
At the time, commercially available pressure sensors for 
combustion chambers were developed and manufactured by 
the company AVL LIST GmbH, for example GH15D, but, 
due to different approaches of measurement, additional work 
must be done in the direction of maturing of our solution. 
Further work must be done  into research of dynamic temper-
ature changes on the needle sensor to minimise those unde-
sirable effects.
