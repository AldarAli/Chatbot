Abstract — Research data is a type of data that is gaining 
importance 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
scientific 
value 
and 
commercialization potential. Research data is one of the 
essential parts of the entire data universe. It can be big data, 
small data, raw or processed data. In order to improve 
functionality, searchability and indexation, the data is 
associated with metadata and linking data, allowing it to be 
linked with other resources, databases, and reference data. 
Complex calculations are carried out on large amounts of 
research data generated as part of scientific experiments. An 
increasing number of universities prepare and implement an 
Open Access policy, following the latest international guidelines. 
To meet the conditions of these arrangements, scientific 
institutions in Poland implement projects to ensure open access 
to their employees' publications and Open Research Data. This 
paper presents the results of an analysis of four university 
repositories in Poland. The study covers, inter alia, the type of 
published data, database scope, institutions participating in the 
project implementation, and the possibility of re-use of open 
data (data sharing format, metadata format, applied ontologies 
and data schemas, information on linked data, legal licenses). 
Keywords-Open Research Data; Linked Data; institutional 
repository; data repository. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Research data comprises all data produced as a result of 
scientific research, regardless of whether we are dealing with 
sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, or humanities. 
Data can be the results of analyses, measurements, surveys, 
historical sources, laboratory logs, images or samples, among 
others. It can take both digital and analog forms. The 
significance and quality of research data are widely discussed 
topics in the scientific community and, nowadays, 
researchers have become increasingly open in sharing and 
disseminating research findings. The amount of data is 
continuously growing, and opening research data is not only 
a good practice, but an obligation. Leading research funding 
agencies, including the European Commission, implement 
policies of sharing scientific data associated with publicly 
financed projects and place increasing emphasis on proper 
management of the research results they fund. Many 
guidelines and recommendations in this area have been 
published 
(including 
guidelines 
from 
the 
European 
Commission, research funding institutions, international 
organizations and associations). In the big data era, society, 
business, and research need quality data to evolve. One of the 
best ways to ensure data quality is managing research data 
under FAIR principles. FAIR data is data which meets 
principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and 
Reusability [1] (hence the acronym).  
Horizon 2020 introduced a policy that obliges grantees to 
publish research results in the Open Access (OA) model. 
A pilot of Open Research Data has also been introduced. The 
announced changes in Horizon Europe will include the need 
to ensure OA by depositing work in a repository immediately 
after publication, without any embargo period, leaving 
copyright with the author, and using open licenses, such as 
Creative Commons licenses. In the field of research data, the 
principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’ will 
be maintained, according to which, by default, data should be 
made available in an open manner. Data can only remain 
closed in justified situations, with considerable attention 
being paid to research data management. 
On 4 April 2019, the European Parliament adopted 
a Directive on open data and re-use of public sector 
information [2]. The document was updated in June 2019. EU 
member states were given two years to adapt their laws to the 
new requirements. This means, among other things, that 
regulations for the sharing of research data by scientific 
institutions must be in place by 2021. The adoption of the 
Directive will also affect the Polish legal order, as its 
implementation will require amendments to the Act of 25th 
February 2016 on the re-use of public sector information [3]. 
It is worth paying attention to the fact that easy integration, 
linking, and re-use of data across silos is enabled by, among 
others, Linked Open Data (LOD) technology [4]. 
The EU Directive in points 27 and 28 speaks explicitly 
about the motives and ways to make research data open:  
‘The volume of research data generated is growing 
exponentially and has potential for re-use beyond the 
scientific community. In order to be able to address 
mounting societal challenges efficiently and in a holistic 
manner, it has become crucial and urgent to be able to 
access, blend and re-use data from different sources, as 
well as across sectors and disciplines. Research data

includes statistics, results of experiments, measurements, 
observations resulting from fieldwork, survey results, 
interview recordings and images. It also includes meta-
data, specifications, and other digital objects. (…) Beside 
open access, commendable efforts are being made to 
ensure that data management planning becomes 
a standard scientific practice and to support the 
dissemination of research data that is findable, accessible, 
interoperable, and reusable (FAIR principle). (28) For the 
reasons explained above, it is appropriate to set an 
obligation on Member States to adopt open access policies 
with respect to publicly funded research data and ensure 
that such policies are implemented by all research 
performing 
organizations 
and 
research 
funding 
organizations. (…) certain obligations stemming from this 
Directive should be extended to research data resulting 
from scientific research activities subsidized by public 
funding or co-funded by public and private-sector entities. 
(…) However, in this context, concerns in relation to 
privacy, protection of personal data, confidentiality, 
national security, legitimate commercial interests, such as 
trade secrets, and to intellectual property rights of third 
parties should be duly taken into account, according to the 
principle "as open as possible, as closed as necessary"’ 
[2]. 
The second section of this paper describes the legal and 
organizational situation of research data in Poland (based on 
European Union regulations). It describes the method of 
calculating the number of repositories in Poland and indicates 
the reason for selecting those repositories described in the 
study. The third section describes the method adopted in the 
study and the individual elements analyzed. This section is 
divided into the following parts: providers and cooperation; 
types of provided information; publications and Research 
Data licenses; repositories and FAIR principles; research 
Data format; Linked data and semantization; access points; 
metadata license; used schemas and ontologies. The last 
section of the paper describes the preliminary conclusions of 
the research and, above all, the indicated areas that require in-
depth analysis and further research. As this publication is an 
introduction to the research and indicates problems that 
require analysis, topics have been identified that have not 
been researched yet, but will be analyzed in the future. 
II. 
OPEN RESEARCH DATA AT POLISH UNIVERSITIES 
Based on the Directive mentioned above, the Ministry of 
Digitalisation of the Republic of Poland prepared in 2020 
a draft law on open data and re-use of public sector 
information [5], which will be introduced in 2021. As 
a consequence of introducing the Act, guidelines and 
recommendations for universities will also be presented. 
The National Science Centre – NSC (the Polish national 
funder) also supports the idea of making research data 
accessible. From 2019, grant applications submitted in NSC 
competitions must be accompanied by a Data Management 
Plan (DMP), which specifies, among other things, what 
research data will be used, produced and made available 
within the project, as well as how they will be stored. 
The academic year 2019/2020 in Poland began with 133 
public universities, including 19 universities, 16 technical 
universities and 13 universities of natural science, economics 
and pedagogy, 9 medical universities, and approx. 240 non-
public universities [6]. According to the statistical data of the 
Polish Central Statistical Office for 2019, 93,100 academic 
teachers were employed in various research and teaching 
positions [7].  
Considering the large number of universities in Poland, 
the number of repositories where their employees can share 
data is low. The Directory of Open Access Repositories 
(Open DOAR) database shows 119 open repositories in 
Poland [8]. After analyzing the list of repositories, it can be 
concluded that most of the platforms registered there are 
digital libraries, which are not typical repositories. However, 
they often contain, in addition to cultural heritage objects, 
scientific publications and sometimes research data. The 
content of these databases would require additional separate 
research. However, considering only the research data 
repositories registered in the Re3Data.org database, we can 
see only 8 instances [9]. This is a much better source of 
information than the Open DOAR, because the repository 
must meet specific criteria to be registered in that database. 
Registered repositories are: Copernicus' Heliograph, Open 
Forest Data, Kujawsko-Pomorska Digital Library (as the only 
one of the digital libraries), CLARIN-PL, MOST Wiedzy 
Open Research Data Catalog (Bridge of Data), GEOMIND 
(no longer available since 2018), RepOD, Polish Platform of 
Medical Research.  
III. 
THE BASIS OF THE ANALYSIS  
Repositories chosen for this study had to meet two main 
criteria: they should provide access to Open Research Data 
and implement LOD technology to increase accessibility, 
improve quality and increase the possibility of reusing 
science 
resources 
according 
to 
international 
recommendations. According to a survey concerning Polish 
LOD projects conducted in January 2021, only four 
institutional repositories functioning in Polish universities 
meet the LOD criterion [10]: AZON 2.0 (the Atlas of Open 
Science Resources) [11], the Bridge of Data (MOST Wiedzy 
Open Research Data Catalog – Gdańsk University of 
Technology) [12], RUJ (Repository of Jagiellonian University, 
Cracow) [13] and PPM (Polish Platform of Medical 
Research)[14]. Those examples show a diverse approach to 
providing access to information about publications, research, 
and Open Data conducted by Polish researchers. Information 
on the projects comes from the data posted on the official 
websites of the projects and from questionnaires sent to 
suppliers between January 21 and 27, 2021. 
A. Providers and cooperation 
The selected examples show that, in the Polish landscape, 
there are different approaches to creating repositories. We can

ALLDATA 2021 : The Seventh International Conference on Big Data, Small Data, Linked Data and Open Data

list here two main types: 1) projects implemented by a single 
university and 2) projects created cooperatively by more than 
one institution. In the first group, we can indicate a) projects 
designed for the university’s employees only, e.g. RUJ; b) 
projects implemented by a single university but open to all 
research communities in the country, e.g., Bridge of Data, 
which the Gdańsk University of Technology introduced, but 
where any interested researcher can create a profile and share 
information about research conducted and publications. In the 
second group, we can identify a) projects implemented by 
“homogeneous” universities, e.g. PPM, which is a result of 
the cooperation of 8 medical institutions (7 universities with 
Wrocław Medical University as a leader and 1 Institute of 
Occupational Health); and b) projects implemented by 
different kinds of institutions, like AZON 2.0 created by 
Wrocław University of Science and Technology (leader), the 
Wrocław University of Environmental and Life Science, 
Wroclaw Medical University and Systems Research 
Institutes of Polish Academy of Science. Further analysis of 
remaining Polish repositories should lead to the creation of 
a typology that includes them. 
B. Types of provided information 
Analyzed projects show that these are not only typical 
institutional repositories. In addition to data on employees’ 
publications and Ph.D. theses, they also provide information 
about 
researchers’ 
profiles, 
conferences, 
research 
infrastructure, 
research 
projects, 
research 
data, 
and 
sometimes about inventions (detailed information on the 
types of provided data are summarized in Table I).

* Only those with Open Access and deposited in the repository (ca. 17 % 
of all publications records in the database). 
C. Publications and Research Data licenses 
Because all of the analyzed repositories provide access to 
publications and research data, they must define the licenses 
under which they are available online. In every case, 
information about the type of license is given in addition to 
the metadata. Moreover, the information about the license 
usually links to the full text of the license on the Internet. The 
exception is the PPM platform, where clicking the license 
info directs us to the list with results of all publications 
deposited in the PPM with the same license. The most 
common are Creative Commons licenses. If the full text of 
the publication is available outside of the repository, an 
appriate link is also given. Most of the suppliers also provide 
special tutorials for researchers about licenses. 
D. Repositories and FAIR principles 
As mentioned in the introduction, one of the best ways to 
ensure data quality is managing research data under FAIR 
principles. The analyzed repositories in their tutorials for 
researchers write about FAIR principles [15; 16; 17]. The 
only repository that doesn’t provide such information on the 
project’s website is AZON 2.0. The actual check of whether 
a given repository's resources meet the FAIR rules is the so-
called FAIRification, which consists of the technical review 
of data using dedicated IT tools [18]. This is an issue that 
requires a separate study. 
E. Research Data format 
Research Data are mostly available in many formats, due 
to the multidisciplinary nature of the repositories. The most 
common are CSV and PDF. But, for example, the set of 
formats of the AZON 2.0 repository also includes DOC/X, 
PPT/X, TIFF, JPG, PNG, GIF, PSD, WRP, STL, OBJ, PTS, 
PTX, TXT, JSON, MP4, MOV, STR, VTT, STL, AVI, MP3, 
MD, and many technical formats for datasets. Depositaries 
are committed to sharing files in open formats and/or 
providing alternative formats to closed formats. 
F. Linked data and semantization 
Three of the four analyzed repositories provide 
information about LOD or semantization of their collection 
on their websites (AZON 2.0 on the main page [11] after 
choosing “How to further explore resources”; Bridge of Data 
40
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2021.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-842-6
ALLDATA 2021 : The Seventh International Conference on Big Data, Small Data, Linked Data and Open Data

[19]; PPM [20]). Information about LOD implementation in 
the RUJ project was received in the questionnaire. 
All of the repositories implemented linking data within 
the projects. In AZON 2.0, metadata are connected also to 
external datasets such as Geonames, Wikidata, plWordnet, 
General Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus (GEMET), 
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), AgroVOC, International 
Plant Names Index (IPNI), The Plant List, World Flora 
Online (WFO), Ośrodek Przetwarzania Informacji (OPI), 
ORCID, Polska Bibliografia Naukowa (PBN), ResearcherID, 
Scopus. Information about linking data to external datasets in 
the PPM was not provided.  
G. Access points 
All of the projects provide API for data re-use, and in most 
cases, this requires filling an access form to receive an access 
code or token. As to API’s data format, there are many 
variations: the most common are JSON, JSON-LD, RDF, 
XML, and Turtle. The exception is the PPM platform, which 
lists all available formats of data and protocols on its website 
[21]. 
H. Metadata license 
Almost none of the projects implemented by Polish 
institutions provide information about metadata licenses. The 
Bridge of Data uses the Creative Commons CC-BY license 
for metadata, but that information is not visible on the 
project’s website. At RUJ, the suppliers didn’t apply any 
license for metadata because, in their opinion, “it was not 
necessary”. 
Of course, the issue of a metadata license is strongly 
related to the applicable law in the country, and this should 
be the basis for further research. 
I. Used schemas and ontologies 
Creating an extensive database that provides access to 
diverse content is a big challenge. It requires, for instance, the 
development of a data entry schema. The analyzed projects 
mainly created schemas based on other schemas and 
ontologies already available on the Web. The most common 
are: Schema.org, datacite, Friend of a Friend (FOAF), 
Bibliographic Ontology (BIBO), Dublin Core (DC), 
Bibliographic 
Framework 
(BIBFRAME), 
Metadata 
Authority Description Schema (MADS), Gemeinsame 
Normdatei (GND), Simple Knowledge Organization System 
(SKOS), Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records 
(FRBR). 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Research Data Management is a topic that has been 
discussed for many years and is gaining in importance. The 
basic premise for appropriate data management is the proper 
and efficient use of public funds. Considering the changes in 
scientific communication and the guidelines of research 
funding agencies, as well as legislative changes, Polish 
universities will have to create data repositories or use 
existing platforms for sharing research data. Both the 
repositories analyzed and the remaining repositories must be 
carefully analyzed according to specific qualitative criteria, 
defined at a later stage of the research. The conducted study 
showed that, among similar initiatives, there are significant 
differences in the functionality and standards used. 
Further research should also cover other issues related to 
the quality of Polish repositories. These include indexing the 
repository content in dataset indexing databases, such as 
Google Dataset Search, DataCite, and Data Citation Index 
(Web of Science). Another criterion against which 
repositories will be assessed will be their certification (e.g., 
Core Trust Seal) and presence on the lists of trusted 
repositories published by scientific journals and publishers 
(e.g., Nature Scientific Data Recommended Repositories 
[22]). Further research should also show in which other data 
repositories researchers from Poland share their data. 
Preliminary analyses indicate that these may be repositories 
with an international scope, such as Zenodo or Figshare, 
domain repositories and repositories of scientific journal 
publishers.
