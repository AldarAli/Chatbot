Abstract—Delay/Disruption/Disconnection Tolerant Networks
(DTNs) attract a great deal of attention as the part of the
evolution of various telecommunications networks. In DTNs, the
desired features of communication are high-speed data-transfer,
high rate of transmission, and reduction of terminal resource
usage (e.g., network bandwidth or capacity of node storage).
These features often conﬂict with each other. Although balancing
conﬂicting requirements are important, optimum methodology is
still not established. In order to address these issues, we propose a
new method which propagates information based on the context
of messages in the shared network, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle
(V2V) communication. In our method, we use two parameters,
namely, rate of dissemination and maximum number of hops, to
control the speed of information propagation and total amount of
information in the network. We found that rate of dissemination
controls the speed of spreading information and an amount of
messages needed for spreading, while maximum number of hops
controls the speed of spreading information and the information
volume sent per time unit.

INTRODUCTION
Delay/Disruption/Disconnection
Tolerant
Networks
(DTNs) is a computer network technology which aims to
realize a high trust data transmission in the environment
where devices are not able to communicate sequentially.
DTNs do not assume a ﬁxed wireless infrastructure, where
nodes communicate with each other by direct connection
or through multi-hop relays. When the terminal cannot
connect to the recipient directly, they perform multi-hop
relays by using the resources (message storage) of every node
encountered on their communication path. DTNs attract a
great deal of attention as a network construction technology
for a high-speed communication using only mobile devices,
in particular, when network infrastructure is damaged by
disasters [1].
As an ideal model of DTNs communication, we discuss
the approach to construct a network where any message can be
delivered with high-speed and high probability. The simplest
way to do it is to broadcast every message. It is difﬁcult for
the terminal to deliver its message to the recipient directly
in DTNs. The terminal expects that somebody delivers the
message by passing its copy through other nodes. The more
nodes relaying the message exist, the higher are chances that
the message is delivered successfully. However, broadcasting
a message involves a lot of relaying nodes, so it is not a
good policy since the network becomes ﬂooded with messages.
Besides, we need to assume that network resources have some
restrictions, since DTNs consist of mobile devices only. For
example, the broadcast communication leads to the network
congestion and, at worst, to the network failure. Hence, com-
munication on DTNs must be performed in a way that reduces
the consumption in resources.
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) networks [2] consist of many
moving vehicles which can communicate with each other, so
V2V can be regarded as one form of DTNs. For example, Intel-
ligent Transport Systems (ITS) are one of the solutions for road
transportation problems [3][4][5]. The most remarkable feature
of ITS is that every communication is performed between the
unspeciﬁed large number of nodes. Every message has no
speciﬁc recipient, but it is shared by all nodes which could
communicate with others. Assuming that ITS aims to share
information, we found that according to context, information
could be marked either as urgent or important. These two
factors affect information propagation.
Based on this analysis, we propose a parameter-based
routing method which controls the process of information
propagation by using information context. The structure of this
paper is as follows: Section II introduces some existing routing
techniques in DTNs. Section III shows our proposal. Section
IV shows the results of simulation and related considerations.
Finally, Section V presents conclusions and future tasks.

RELATED WORKS
This section introduces some existing routing techniques
in DTNs.
Epidemic Routing [6] is the easiest routing technique in
DTNs, where copies of messages are sent to adjacent nodes.
With a behavior resembling a contagious disease, this method
is a simple technique with very high probability of delivering
messages. However, most of messages sent by a node do
not reach an intended receiver. In order to avoid an overload
of network and message storage, more elaborate message
propagation methods have been proposed.
Based on the assumption that using historical information
estimates future behavior, several methods using historical
transmission state have been proposed. PRoPHET [7] uses the
delivery predictability calculated from the encounter rate, the
encounter time and the delivery success rate. In MaxProp [8],
all nodes in the network calculate transmission costs from the
number of the past encounters and send own message along
the path determined by these costs. However, in a large-scale
mobile network, these methods are hard to apply.
In Encounter-Based Routing [9], the total number of mes-
sages is set, and when relaying, sender makes copies of

messages according to the number of node encounters. Spray
and Wait [10] introduces two propagation phases. In Spray
phase, the ﬁxed number of messages is sent to the network.
In Wait phase, the node stops sending messages and waits
for them to be received. This policy can limit the amount of
information transferred in the network. Spray and Focus [11]
differs in that Wait phase is replaced with Focus phase. In
Focus phase, nodes holding a message do not wait for it to
reach the destination, but pass the message to the other node
who can deliver it with higher probability. In these methods,
however, the number of nodes who receive a message is limited
because the number of messages is ﬁxed.

PROPOSED METHOD
This study does not target networks for communication be-
tween speciﬁc communication partners. Instead, it is supposed
to be used for sharing information scenarios, such as V2V
communication. We propose propagating shared information
according to the information context. Assuming that every
node wants the information shared, the goal is to spread a
message to as many nodes in the network as possible.
We understand that urgency and importance of the informa-
tion shared in V2V communication are deﬁned by information
content. By importance in this paper we mean how much proﬁt
can be produced. In case of trafﬁc, a proﬁt could mean that the
trafﬁc jam is resolved early, traveling time is saved, and the
environment is considered by saving fuel. The priority of such
message is high because it is beneﬁcial from a viewpoint of
V2V network and the vehicles in the network. Urgency means
how much information value is lost as time passes. In other
words, this shows how important the freshness of information
is. One example of such urgent information is the one that
prevents driver’s life risk. For example, the submergence
of roadway underpass or rockfall along the mountain path.
Drivers’ safety could be ensured by notifying them of such
information in the area as wide as possible.
It is hardly possible to balance all requirements in V2V
communication (like yielding both speedy delivery and deliv-
ery with high probability), similar to how it is done in general
DTNs. Instead, balance should be achieved by considering
the information context. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
changing propagation method according to a propagation me-
dia (in this case, a node), considering the information context
to attain desired efﬁciency (Fig. 1).
A. Context-Based Communication
We deﬁne context-based communication as follows:
1)
Get message context
2)
Assign propagation parameters determined by context
(importance and urgency) to each message
3)
Send information depending on propagation parame-
ters
This paper proposes spreading messages by using param-
eters (the item 3 above).
During the evaluation (Section IV), we assumed that nodes
have functions to get the context and to assign parameters
(items 1 and 2 above). Since the number of message types is
limited, assigning parameters to each message can be easily
performed with the assignment table. It is important to deﬁne
how the context affects propagation parameters. For example,
ﬁrst, a user sets the level of urgency and importance individ-
ually. The level ranges from 0 to 5. Next, the propagation
parameters are determined by the level. For example, the level
multiplied by 1/5 (20%) is used as rate of dissemination.
B. Communication Parameters
The following parameters are proposed:
1) Rate of dissemination: This is a propagation parameter
determining a probability, at which a node sends a message
to the other node. It controls the number of messages in the
network and the speed of propagation. For instance, a sender
sends a message to each receiver with 60% probability when
a parameter value is 60. In such case, we expect that this
information will reach 60% of possible receivers (Fig. 2). This
parameter should be set high when the message owner wants
to reach more nodes quickly and wants other nodes to relay
(the urgency is high).
2) Maximum number of hops: This is a propagation param-
eter determining the number of intermediate nodes. It controls
the area of spreading and the speed of propagation. Basic
behavior is similar to Time To Live (TTL) parameter of an

IP packet. Fig. 3 shows an example when the message with
maximum number of hops = 2 is propagated. The parameter is
decreased by 1 with each hop. The message whose maximum
number of hops becomes 0 is not propagated anymore. In case
the same information arrives, the message is dismissed. We
decided not to overwrite maximum number of hops, since our
network aims to spread the information as much as possible.
This parameter should be set high when the message owner
wants to deliver a message in an area as wide as possible (the
importance is high).
IV.
EVALUATION
Evaluation was done under the assumption that the context
of messages (importance and urgency) affects propagation
parameters (rate of dissemination and maximum number of
hops), which, in turn, inﬂuences spreading speed and the
amount of information. We use custom DTN simulator written
in Java, since none of existing open source software or
commercial software met our speciﬁc needs for this evaluation.
Physical parameters (e.g., communication bandwidth, commu-
nication channel or communication delay) were not taken into
account.
A. Simulator Design
One cycle of simulation contains the following sequence
of actions.
1)
Each node moves within the simulation ﬁeld area.
2)
Each node searches other nodes in range.
3)
Each node sends messages to nodes found.
All nodes move by 1 unit of length every cycle. The
contactable distance of all nodes is 10. The movable ﬁeld
size is 1000 x 1000. To evaluate the effect of our parameters
more precisely, nodes and communication relay devices were
designed as follows:
•
Unlimited storage: prevents deleting messages in the
storage.
•
Fixed number of nodes: prevents losing messages.
•
Communication always succeeds: prevents communi-
cation failures affecting successfulness of propagation.

Free movement: all nodes can either go straight or turn
randomly. In an epidemic broadcasting in DTNs, the
difference in mobility affects spreading messages [12].
The more freely nodes can move, the more difﬁcult
message spreading patterns become.
All shared messages have two propagation parameters and
are transmitted according to them. At the beginning of each
simulation, the number of messages is the same. The number
of messages is affected only by our proposed parameters.
B. Results and Considerations
During the pre-experimentation stage, we measured the av-
erage number of contactable nodes using our simulator (Table
I). Most nodes did not have communication partner. The more
nodes in the simulation ﬁeld are, the more communication
partners for each node appear, since node density increases.
In case of 50 and 200 nodes, an increase in the number of
nodes advanced the termination of spreading messages. The
simulation produced the same results in case of 100 nodes as
to the effect of rate of dissemination and maximum number
of hops. Therefore, we considered only the case of 100 nodes.
When maximum number of hops is “Unlimited” or rate of
dissemination is 100%, given parameter does not have any
effect.
Figs. 4 and 5 indicate how long does it take for the message
to spread within the ﬁeld by changing rate of dissemination.
The horizontal axis shows the time, and the vertical shows
the spreading. By spreading in this evaluation we mean how
many nodes receive the message. As nodes in the ﬁeld receive
a message, spreading approaches 100%. Each line corresponds
to messages with different values of rate of dissemination. As
rate of dissemination increases, the message is spread faster.
In other words, rate of dissemination controls the spreading
speed. Besides, by comparing two ﬁgures, we can see that
changing maximum number of hops also affects message
spreading speed.

Fig. 6 indicates the number of transmissions for each
value of rate of dissemination. The horizontal axis shows the
number of cycles. We calculated the average every 600 cycles.
Regardless of rate of dissemination, at ﬁrst the number of
transmissions increases with the number of cycles. After that,
it stabilizes. The lower rate of dissemination is, the lower is
the upper limit of measured value. Fig. 7 indicates the number
of transmissions for each value of maximum number of hops.
The axes are same as in Fig. 6. As the parameter increases, the
number of transmissions increases as well. However, further
increase in parameter did not make a substantial change in the
number of transmissions. There was a small variation in case
of 200 nodes, which we believe is because a small number of
nodes restricts the number of hops.

Fig. 8 shows the number of cycles needed for 100% spread-
ing and the total amount of sent messages. The horizontal axis
shows rate of dissemination. The left vertical axis corresponds
to the line graph and shows the number of cycles needed for
100% spreading. The right vertical axis corresponds to the bar
graph and shows the number of sent messages by the spreading
termination. As rate of dissemination increases, cycles until
termination amount decreases at ﬁrst, and then stabilizes. In
contrast, the total number of messages increases. Increasing
the parameter not only do not expedite the termination, but
also generates excessive messages, which, in turn, increase
the network load. In Fig. 9, we replaced the horizontal axis
to show maximum number of hops. Increasing the parameter
decreases cycles until termination amount, similar to rate of
dissemination. However, maximum number of hops do not
affect cycles until termination amount. Considering Figs. 7
and 9 together, we see that this parameter does not change
the sum of messages by spreading termination. From another
point of view, it can save network bandwidth by delaying
the consumption of network resources at the cost of reducing
spreading speed.
According to the experiments above, we assume that pro-
posed parameters (rate of dissemination and maximum number
of hops) control the amount of messages in the network and the
speed of the message spreading. When rate of dissemination
is 50%, the number of messages is reduced by half while
the termination time remains almost the same compared to
broadcasting. By decreasing the rate to 15%, the number of

V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we proposed an efﬁcient means of commu-
nication in information sharing DTNs by using the context
of information. We suggested that two parameters, namely,
rate of dissemination and maximum number of hops, can
serve as a way of controlling information propagation and
help establish the process of context-based communication.
We found that rate of dissemination controls the speed of
spreading information and an amount of messages needed for
spreading, while maximum number of hops controls the speed
of spreading information and the information volume sent per
time unit.
By performing the simulation, we established the effect
propagation parametes (rate of dissemination and maximum
number of hops) have on spreading messages, therefore mak-
ing the usage of message context feasible.
The future tasks for constructing context-aware communi-
cation in DTNs are as follows.
•
Making the system context-aware: All nodes in DTNs
should take the context from their own messages and
assign the propagation parameters according to the
context (the items 1 and 2 in Section III-A). Also,
in order to deal with different kinds of information,
the system must be generalized.
•
Realistic simulation: We should perform simulation
on the various mobile models and consider various
channel models and protocols (e.g., CSMA/CA) by
using the ns (network simulator) [13][14].
•
Using the network state: Each node should take into
account the network state when propagating own
messages. This allows to build network-aware system.
•
Summarization of the similar information: Each node
should summarize similar information shared in the
network. In the case of V2V, several vehicles may gen-
erate the information containing the similar message
(e.g., trafﬁc jam occurred at almost the same location).
By summarizing such information, we could reduce
the total number of messages in the network.
•
Applying game theory to DTNs for sharing informa-
tion: DTNs would become simple and intelligent if
each node acts for oneself. The goal of this task is
to make the function of each node simple and reduce
their load.
