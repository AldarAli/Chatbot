Abstract—The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) has emerged
over the last years as an approach which supports the
improvement of software and systems development. Several
software companies have reported on success stories regarding
the implementation of SAFe. SAFe claimes solutions for
business
challenges,
such
as
shortening
cycle’s
times,
improving
product
quality,
increasing
team
members’
satisfaction,
and
involving
the
customer
in
product
development. However, regarding customer involvement, there
is limited research, both in SAFe and in real-life agile software
development projects. This study aims to develop a conceptual
customer involvement process model as a basis for case studies
in industrial companies which are implementing SAFe. As
such, this study reflects work-in-progress, and our conceptual
model can be considered as a partial achievement of a longer-
term research project.
Keywords-

Conceptual
model;
Customer

INTRODUCTION
Software
development
companies
have
a
lot
of
challenges nowadays. “They need to deliver software in
time, within the budget, and within the quality and
functional
requirements”
[8].
The
traditional
way
of
software development is not suitable for the development of
large scale and complex systems. Agile is nowadays a
popular development approach [7]. Agile has proved to be
able to handle large-scale complex systems by using several
methods and techniqes [14]. Although the Scaled Agile
Framework (SAFe) is rather new, some success stories on
implementation have already been reported [20]. Although
customers issues can be recognized in SAFe, there is limited
research on how to involve customers in real-life agile
projects [18]. Customer involvement is an essential factor
for developing successful software products [17]. However,
often companies are not supported in identifing and
selecting the right customer types and the customer skills
that
are
needed.
Consequently,
customers
cannot
be
assigned
appropriately
in
the
various
development
processes, and their performance cannot be measured. For
instance, a customer can have essential knowledge of a
product, but can lack authority in development processes to
decide for particular product features [15]. Also, customers
cannot have sufficient time to participate in software
development processes [11]. This can cause declining
customer motivation and loss of customer interest to get or
stay involved in software development, and in SAFe
implementations. SAFe considers user feedback and the
usage of intrinsic customer knowledge as key for a
successful application [10]. Customers are considered as
having a critical role in the various aspects of SAFe
implementations [18]. However, although SAFe addresses
customer involvement issues in its framework, there is
limited research done on how to determine and evaluate
customer involvement. There are currently no clear concepts
and guidelines to involve customers on the various SAFe
levels and in the processes. In Section 2, some related work
will be discussed. Section 3 focuses at a literature review
and analysis. A conceptual customer involvement model
will be introduced in Section 4, to support a case study
research
on
SAFe
implementations.
This
customer
involvement model will be based on findings from a
structured literature research, and will contain guidelines for
application during SAFe implementation projects. Section 5
will finalise the paper with conclusions.

RELATED WORK
The Agile Manifesto emphasized the importance of
customer collaboration in one of its four pinciples [4]. Also
in
Scrum
and
ScrumXP,
customers
should
have
responsibilities,
for
example
in
review
and
feedback
processes
[19].
The
SAFe
framework
covers
both
organizational levels and processes for agile development
practices,
see
the
“4-level
view”
in
http://www.scaledagileframework.com/. Four organizational
levels can be recognized in this framework, respectively the
Team Level, the Program Level, the Value Stream, and the
Portfolio Level. Although SAFe states that customers
should be empowered in processes such as requirements
management, defining solutions, planning, demonstration,
and product evaluations [11], it does not provide explicit
guidance for employing customer involvement, for example

with respect to the type of customer to be involved, in what
specific activities, and the customer’s barriers to overcome
[9].
Since
pressure
on
customer
involvement
and
satisfaction has been increased in the current era [3], new
approaches for involving customers should be developed.
Customers have to be engaged effectively and efficiently
into
software
development
and
SAFe
implementation
projects, and barriers have to be overcome.

LITERATURE AND ANALYSIS
Three literature domains provided a basis for our
literature search, see Fig. 1. This figure shows the Scaled
Agile Framework domain as the main research area, and the
highly relevant intersections between the three domains.
This study strives at a conceptual customer involvement
model for SAFe implementations as an ‘integrated concept’
of the three recognized domains.
Figure 1. Literature domains.
Regarding the literature on the Scaled Agile Framework,
customer
involvement
is
addressed
on
four
levels,
respectively: Team Level, Program Level, Value Stream,
and Portfolio Level [18]. Analysis results are presented in
Table I. Program level and Value Stream are merged
because customers have similar activities on these levels,
and some activities are closely linked. As can be seen in
Table I, customers should be involved significantly at the
Program Level and the Value Stream. Most activities are
related to validate the product quality in order to meet the
customer needs. On the other hand, customers contribute
less at the Team Level and seem to not contribute at the
Portfolio Level. Regarding the literature domain of agile
software development, see Fig. 1, the structured evolution of
agile methods has been investigated, see for example [1].
Customers should have an important role in software
development processes, e.g., as product owner with critical
tasks, such as defining product features, reviewing features,
and providing feedback [19]. In the literature domain of
customer involvement, see Fig. 1, four main aspects have
been
identified,
respectively:
customer
role,
customer
knowledge, customer motives and customer interaction [17].

Contributing in defining a roadmap, milestones, and
releases
Participating in inspection and adaption (I&A) and
workshops to improve next PI’s performances
Team
Contributing in creating user stories
Performing functional & system acceptance testing at
the end of iterations
Three roles have been identified: customers as a resource,
customers as co-creators, and customers as users [13].
Regarding customer knowledge, two factors are considered:
usage and technology knowledge [12]. On that basis three
types of customers are being defined: respectively: ordinary
users,
experts,
and
lead
users.
Regarding
customer
interaction, literature reports on advances in internet and
technology
which
have
changed
current
product
development practices [2]. For example, Nambisan [13]
suggested that companies need to design and use virtual
customer environments (VCE’s) to optimize customer
knowledge acquisition and exchange.
Next to these customer involvement issues that SAFe
implementations have to deal with, barriers and threaths
have also been identified and reported in literature, see
[5][16]. Six barriers have been identified in this study,
respectively:
team
diversity
(that
hinders
knowledge
exchange,
e.g.
because
of
geographical
and
time
differences), team attitudes and values, team competences,
team
communication,
and
customer
interaction
and
technology infrastructure.
IV.
CONCEPTUAL CUSTOMER INVOLVEMENT MODEL
Based on the literature study and analysis we developed
our customer involvement model to help companies to
engage customers and to optimize their ‘involvement value’.
Our model consists of five stages, see Fig. 2. Because
customer involvement can increase project uncertainty, the
first stage addresses the identification of risks in the project.
In stage 2, the result of the project risk identification is used
for the determination of the customer involvement level in
the project. To support this stage, customer involvement
concepts, such as customer roles (i.e., resource, co-creator,
user) [13], and customer knowledge issues have to be
applied. Subsequently, the next three stages follow an
approach for involving external parties, as developed in
[21]. These are respectively, a specification, a selection, and
a customer value optimization stage. The latter stage

replaces the contract agreement stage of [21] because in our
study legal aspects are out of scope. The motivation for the
latter stage is that it has the same goal as contract
agreements, i.e., it ensures that external parties (i.e.,
customers)
perform
in
accordance
with
company
expectations.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This preparatory study represents a partial achievement
of a longer-term project, i.e., the development of a
conceptual customer involvement model to improve SAFe
implementations. The conceptual model is based on a
structured literature review and analysis. Five stages have
been developed and have been elaborated on the basis of
findings
from
literature.
The
conceptual
customer
engagement process model will be applied on the short term
in an in-depth case study, in Company X. In this company,
medical embedded software development is carried out in
large evolutionay software development projects. Currently
SAFe is being implemented in this company in various
projects
in
different
departments
and
business
units.
Customer involvement is considered in this company as a
challenging and promising area in SAFe implementations. In
our case study, we will use an inductive approach, i.e.,
carrying out semi-structured interviews, document studies
and team work observations. Regarding the quality of the
case study we will address validity (internal, construct and
external) and reliability aspects [22]. Based on the case study
results we will strive towards an extended, customer
involvement oriented, SAFe framework.
