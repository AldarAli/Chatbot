Abstract— In this paper, a case study is presented to improve 
the performance of a Tires Production System implemented as 
a Material Requirement Planning. In our proposal, the Master 
Production Schedule is calculated from a percentage of the 
demand’s forecast per period, and production begins with the 
arrival of customer orders. The improvement of Tires 
Production Systems comprises to work with the multi-objective 
genetic algorithm method NSGA-II and with the results 
comparison of the duo Simulated Binary Crossover - 
Parameter based against the Whole Arithmetical Crossover 
Mutation - Mutation Uniform. The simulation results show 
that the minimum values are obtained with the pair Simulated 
Binary Crossover - Mutation-based Parameter, and also in 
fewer generations number.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
This research starts with the need to improve the 
performance of a Tire Production System (TPS). TPS is 
implemented as a Material Requirements Planning (MRP) 
System. The improvement is made at the Planning and 
Production Control System (PPCS) of the TPS in order to 
satisfy demand without increasing inventory.  
A PPCS can be implemented as a Push System (PHS) or 
as a Pull System (PLS). A MRP is a type of Push System 
[1], while a Kanban System is considered to be a Pull 
System [1]. In a PHS, the Forecasted Demand represents the 
signal to start production, and its main feature is to satisfy 
the demand in exchange for an inventory of finished 
products. A Kanban System starts production with the 
arrival order signal; its main feature is to decrease inventory 
in exchange of the increasing the risk to do not meeting the 
demand. 
 
Both PPCS approaches (PLS and PHS) were created for 
different manufacturing environments. PLS works well in 
environments 
of 
assembly 
of 
components, 
where 
components are assembled into finished products, while 
PHS works well in processes that supply products to other 
production processes as well as processes that involve 
perishable products [2].  
Since late 80’s, some researchers have explored different 
combinations of the advantages of PHS and PLS and they 
have defined a new kind of PPCS known as Hybrid Push-
Pull Systems (HPPS). These kinds of systems merge the 
characteristics of PHS and PLS in order to improve 
Production Systems performance [1]. 
The objective of this paper is to improve the performance 
of a TPS. This is accomplished by taking the advantages 
from both PHS and PLS. It is proposed to use MRP for 
Master Production Schedule (MPS) and Material Plan (MP). 
For the execution of the production, the arrival of the orders 
as a signal to start production is proposed. The performance 
is measured with two indicators: Unmet Demand and Raw 
Material Inventory. A Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm 
(MGA) is used in order to find the minimum values of 
performance indicators. 
The paper is organized as follows: the related literature 
with the HPPS that improve the performance of a MRP 
system is cited in Section II. Section III presents the 
proposal to improve the TPS on study, considering the 
elements to integrate to the MRP system implemented in the 
TPS, the MGA method and the crossover and mutation 
techniques; in the materials and methods section, the general 
methodology is defined as well as the structure of the MGA 
method and the information related to the case study. The 
results and conclusions are presented in Section V and 
Section VI, respectively.

of a PPCS, which highlights the inventory of raw materials 
and demand 
satisfaction,

other performance 
indicators. 
According to the literature reviewed, the proposed HPPS 
are structured so that the main advantages of each PHS and 
PLS, i.e., MRP in the planning stage and JIT at the 
production stage. 
The proposed HPPS do not consider changes in the 
proportion of Forecasted Demand in the planning production 
stage, while working with PHS and PLS in the production 
stage.

PROPOSAL 
Based on the literature review, a proposal is made to 
improve a TPS. The TPS under study operates according to 
a MRP system. The improvement is based under the 
following considerations: the TPS in the stages of MPS and 
MP will operate as a MRP system [16], In the Push stage, 
the arrival orders as the starting production signal is 
proposed, like in a Pull System [17]. 
To improve the performance of the TPS, it is proposed to 
calculate the MPS from a percentage of the forecasted 
demand and to produce according to demand. TPS 
improvement is measured through the performance 
indicators: Raw Materials Inventory and Unmet Demand. 
The Raw Material Inventory is the amount of raw material 
accumulated at the beginning of the production process at 
end of period. Unmet Demand is the amount of demand that 
is not satisfied at the end of the period. 
To improve the TPS, a MGA is used. The MGA are used 
when an optimization problem has two or more objective 
functions and the search space is very large. The problem to 
improve the TPS is an optimization problem consisting in 
two objective functions and continuous decision variables. 
The search space size is calculated with a combination of 
the decision variables of all the periods. This problem is 
defined later. According to our previous statements, it can 
be said that it is appropriate to use a MGA. 
There exists some methods of MGA in the literature. 
NSGA-II proposed by Deb [18] is proven to have a better 
performance than other similar methods, such as Pareto-
archived Evolution Strategy (PAES) [19] and Strength-
Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) [20]. These three 
MGA methods use elitism. NSGA-II gets better results with 
real code representation than binary code representations 
[18]. These are the reasons why this method is selected to 
improve the TPS. 
NSGA-II proposes to work with Simulated Binary 
Crossover (SBX) and the Parameter-based Mutation (PBM), 
for validation experiments [21]. However, in this research, 
the mutation and crossover techniques are alternated, in one 
side we use SBX along with PBM, and on the other side the 
Whole Arithmetical Crossover (WAX) is used along with 
Uniform Mutation (UM) [22]. All crossover and mutation 
techniques used in this work, are defined in the next section. 
To improve the TPS, there is an optimization problem 
where the objective functions are: to Minimize Raw 
Material Inventory and to Minimize Unmet Demand, the 
decision variables are the Percentages of Demand 
Forecasted per period and the Demand has random arrivals 
according to a Poisson Probability Distribution with known 
mean. 
To get the minimum values of performance variables for 
the TPS, both crossover and mutation techniques are 
compared in order to find which of the two pairs defined 
previously show better values on performance indicators: 
Raw Materials Inventory and Unmet Demand, as well as 
which of the techniques takes less time. The two pairs are 
chosen because both are applied to real-coded representation 
in genetic algorithms and both use bounds for the decision 
variables; moreover, the crossover is applied to all elements 
of the chromosome, by genetic algorithms.

in the system are the two objective functions to evaluate. 
SBX - PBM and WAX-UM are used for crossover and

1) Crossover and Mutation techniques 
In this work, two methods of crossover and mutation are 
applied. They are described below. 
a)  Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) 
 The formulas for Simulated Binary Crossover [21] are 
presented below: 
 
Create a random number u between 0 and 1. 
 
Find a parameter βq, as follows: 
 
βq= {
    
 
                             
 
 
(
 
    )
 
                            
                             
where                 and β is calculated as 
follows: 
 
     
 
                           
 
     The parameter y is assumed to vary in the interval        
[yl, yu].  
 
     The children solutions are then calculated as follows: 
                      |      |                               
                      |      |                              
 
 
It is assumed that y1 < y2.

 
Calculate the parameter δq as follows: 
 
    
{  
  
                    
 
             
           
                              
 
       
          
 
 
δ=min {[(y- yl ),((yu-y)]/(yu- yl)}.

The formulas for Whole Arithmetical Crossover [22] are 
presented below: 
 
    {
                                
                 
                              
 
 
 
In order to calculate a: 
 
  
  
    
           β 
  
    
             
  
     
             
  
    
       
 
     Where each value    exist within range    
    
 ] and each 
value    exist within range    
    
    
     The children are constructed as follow: 
 
             and               
 
                   
       
               
                   
          
                 
 
d) Uniform Mutation 
     The methodology to calculate Uniform Mutation [22] is 
described below: 
Given          
        the mutated individual will be              
          
           
                            .      
     The minimum and maximum ranges of the variables are 
used. 
2) Procedure for evaluation function  
 
The procedure to calculate evaluation function or fitness 
is described as follows. These steps are added to the NSGA-
II method, and they are related to the case study:

 
To input the Demand Forecasted and the number of 
planning periods.  
 
To calculate MPS. This is the multiplication of the 
Percentage of Forecast by Demand Forecasted, per 
period. The percentage of forecast takes values 
between 0 and 1.5.  
 
To generate Demand. The demand is generated 
randomly, following a Poisson distribution with 
known mean.  
 
To calculate the evaluation functions or Fitness: 
Raw Material Inventory and Unmet Demand. 
 
if MPS ( i , j ) = Demand ( i , j ) 
Raw Material Inventory ( i , j )  = 0 
             Unmet Demand ( i , j )  = 0 
 
if MPS ( i , j )  <  Demand ( i , j )  
Unmet Demand ( i , j ) = (Demand ( i , j )               
– MPS ( i , j ) / Demand ( i , j ) 
        
Raw Material Inventory ( i , j )  = 0 
if MPS ( i , j )  > Demand ( i , j ) 
Raw Material Inventory ( i , j ) = ( MPS ( i 
, j ) – Demand ( i , j ) / MPS ( i , j ) 
           
Unmet Demand ( i , j )  = 0; 
 
 
Fitness ( i ) = [ ∑  Unmet Demand ( i , j )  
             ∑    Inventory ( i , j ) ] 
 
 
To obtain the final solution: get the set of 
nondominated solutions of the final population P, 
and then select the minimum value, one that 
provides the mimimum accumulated values of Raw 
Materials Inventory and Unmet Demand. 
 
Calculations of Raw Material Inventory and Unmet 
Demand are performed for each set of solutions generated 
by the algorithm; i represents the set of solutions of each 
population, and j represents the number of planning periods.  
To construct the MGA that improves the TPS the steps of 
the NSGA-II method are applied. The way of making the 
crossover and mutation must be changed with SBX-PBM 
and WAX-UM, with the respective change on the steps 
above described for the evaluation function. 
The values of the parameters for the MGA are: population 
size of 100, probability of crossover 90%, mutation 
probability of 17%, maximum number of generations of 
250. The probability of Mutation is (1 / (number of decision 
variables)). The value of nc for SBX calculation is 20 and 
nm and for PBM calculations is 20 as well. These values are 
set as recommended by NSGA-II method. Chromosome is 
formed as follows: [Percentage of forecast to period 1 … 
Percentage of forecast of period p], the number of genes 
depends on the number of periods. 
C. Case Study 
The TPS produces 30 different tire sizes; it has a total 
production capacity of 400,000 tires monthly, TPS makes its 
planning for the next 6 months, the average demand is 
390,000 tires per month. The forecast of the demand for the 
6 periods is in Table I.

Simulations are performed to find the minimum values 
of Inventory of Raw Material and Unmet Demand for TPS. 
The results are analyzed by SBX-PBM and WAX-UM; the 
duo that generates the minimum values for both objective 
functions and do it in less generations, is defined as the final 
solution for the case study. The simulations are performed 
in MATLAB 2012-A ®. 
D. Simulation Procedure 
 
The simulation procedure for MGA to improve TPS 
starts with the input data of the case study and the 
parameters of NSGA-II method, considering the evaluation 
function shown in B 1. The simulation is carried out using 
MGA with crossover and mutation SBX-PBM and with 
WAX-UM techniques. 
V. 
RESULTS 
The results of the simulation with SBX-PBM and WAX-
UM are presented in Table II and Table III, respectively. 
These are the percentages of the forecast. Figures 1 to 5 
show the values of Raw Material Inventory and Unmet 
Demand, with SBX-PBM and WAX-UM, for the five 
simulations with 250 generations.    
The graphics in the left side in all figures show the 
results obtained by the SBX-PBM; they achieve the 
minimum values for Raw Materials Inventory and Unmet 
Demand, between 50 and 100 generations. Also, the graph 
shows that from generation 100 the values achieved were 
very similar, and very close to zero. They also notice that 
the values generated for the two objectives initially, reach a 
value of 50. Both objectives are minimized at the same time 
for SBX-PBM. 
 
The graphics on the right side in all figures show that the 
values of the objectives reach values up to 75 at the 
beginning, for WAX-UM. The behavior of the values 
Inventory of Raw Material and Unmet Demand fail to 
stabilize at 250 generations and values generated do not 
reach the minimum in both objectives at once.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
After carrying out the simulation of the MGA to optimize 
the TPS improved by making changes in crossover and 
mutation techniques using the pairs SBX-PBM and  WAX-
UM, and based on the results depicted in the graphics of the 
section above, it can be concluded that:  
 
SBX-PBM gets better results for the two objectives: 
Raw Materials Inventory and Unmet Demand than 
WAX-UM.  
 
SBX-PBM reaches minimum values in fewer 
generations than WAX-UM, for both objectives.  
 
SBX-PBM gest values closer to zero than WAX-
UM. 
The best performance in relation to Inventory of Raw 
Material and Unmet Demand is generated for the pair SBX-
PBM. Therefore it can be concluded for this case study that 
TPS is improved with MGA using the techniques of 
crossover and mutation SBX and PBM. 
It is recommended to apply the improvements proposed 
for TPS, with demand arrivals and production capabilities 
proven in the case study, as well as demand arrivals 
following a Poisson distribution and the parameters fixed for 
the NSGA-II.   
According to the objective, MGA should be used to 
improve TPS, with the technique of crossover and the 
technique of SBX mutation with PBM, with the following 
parameters nc = 20 and nm= 20, with 90% probability of 
crossover, 17% probability of mutation, 250 generations, 
population size of 100, for 6 planning periods. 
As future work, it is planned to set this work as a Hybrid 
Push-Pull System. It is planned also to experiment with 
different production capabilities.
