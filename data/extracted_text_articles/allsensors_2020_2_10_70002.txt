INTRODUCTION
Today, alcohol vapor sensors have a great demand in
various fields. Ethanol sensors are used in food industry,
medicine and biotechnology. Ethanol sensors are also
extremely important during the production of ethanol and
alcoholic drinks to monitor the wine quality. They are used
in processes such as: food–packages, clinical analysis,
agronomic, vinicultural and veterinary analysis, also toxic
waste and contamination analysis, fuel processing, Trends in
Analytical Chemistry (TRAC) management and societal
applications, as well as chemical processing in industry [1]-
[5]. Several methods and strategies have been reported for
the detection of ethanol, e.g., gas chromatography, liquid
chromatography,
refractometry
and
spectrophotometry,
semiconductor gas sensors and so on [2][6][7].
The solid-state gas sensors based on Metal Oxide
Semiconductors (MOSs) with different nanostructures have
played
an important role in environment
monitoring,
domestic and car safety, control in chemical processing due
to their distinct advantages, such as simple implementation,
low cost, high sensitivity, stability and reproducibility, low
detection limit, easy production, nontoxicity, easy-achieved
real-time response and compatibility with micro-fabrication
processes [8]-[10]. Various MOSs materials, such as SnO2,
In2O3, WO3, ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3, CuO, Ga2O3, CTO (CrTiO)
with different nanostructures and dopant have been studied
and showed promising results for detecting Volatile Organic
Compounds (VOCs) [11]. Among these materials, the SnO2
has good electrical and chemical properties. It is an n-type
semiconductor with tetragonal rutile structure and it has a
large energy band gap of 3.6 eV at 300 K. It has been
widely exploited as an ultrasensitive gas sensor for the
detection of carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia, ozone,
carbon dioxide, hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide, nitrogen
dioxide, ethanol and so on [12]-[14]. The wide range of
possible applications has attracted many researchers to work
on this material with different nanostructures, such as
nanograins, nanorods, nanowires and nanofibers synthesized
by various methods. It has a high sensitivity to reducing and
oxidizing gases, fast response and recovery behavior and
low sensitivity to humidity [15]-[17].

Although many conductometric gas sensors made of
MOSs have been commercialized for the last decades, a lot
of problems still need to be solved in order to improve the
performance of gas sensing devices. The main issues are
related to sensitivity, selectivity and stability but the
lowering of sensor’s operating temperature is still one of the
main concerns. Resistive metal oxide based gas sensors
normally operate at an elevated temperature (in a range of
200 ºC
to
400 ºC).
This
results
in
higher
power
consumption, limits the use of the sensor in explosive
environments, and causes difficulties for the sensor to be
attached to electrical systems [18][19].
There
are
many
studies
aimed
at
applying
new
technologies
and
reducing
operating
temperatures.
To
ensure a low operating temperature, several techniques have
been used, such as doping the metal oxides with additives,
using catalytic particles, applying a high electric field across
the sensor terminals and illuminating the sensors with UV
radiation [20][21]. The irradiation of UV-assisted MOS
sensors is an important alternative to activate chemical
reactions on metal oxide surface and reduce the resistance of
the thin sensing layer instead of the more common use of
energy-demanding heating. Almost completely replacing the
effect of thermal energy, UV irradiation greatly influences
the adsorption and desorption processes of the gas on the
semiconductor surface enhancing their reactivity with the
analyte gas. Under the influence of UV illumination, as a
result of the formation of electron–hole pairs, more neutral
atoms and molecules of absorbed oxygen on the surface of
the semiconductor become ions, which then interact with
analyte gas. UV irradiation can also be used to clean the
active surface of a gas sensing layer, but the more important
function is to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the
gas sensor by reducing the operating temperature. If it is not
possible to lower the operating temperature to room
temperature
by
using
UV
irradiation,
UV
irradiation
combined with heating can be used to stimulate the gas
sensor [22]-[24].
In this paper, we focus on low temperature sensing of
SnO2 based thin film sensors under UV illumination. In
Section 2, the fabrication steps of SnO2<Co> sensor are
presented. In Section 3, the studies of sensing properties of
UV assisted ethanol sensor are presented. The conclusions
are outlined in Section 4. The sensor exhibited good
sensitivity
to
low
concentration
of
ethanol
vapors.
Fabricated sensors have also sufficient selectivity and
stability over time.
II.
SENSOR FABRICATION
Sensitive layers based on SnO2<Co> were deposited by
RF magnetron sputtering technique. Firstly, appropriate
quantities
of the
corresponding
metal
oxide
powders
(SnO2+2 at.%Co2O3) were weighed and mixed thoroughly
for 10 hours. Then, the mixture was subjected to pre-heat
treatment at 800 0C for 5 hours (the initial annealing
temperature was chosen based on the composition of the
compound). The preheating of mixed powder eliminates the
moisture of the metal oxide raw materials, which facilitates
homogeneous mixing and milling of the powders (when the
ceramic tablet is made of dry powders, it reduces the
probability of formation of mechanical cracks during final
annealing). Then, the mixed powder was milled for 20 hours
until becoming fully homogeneous and pressed (with
2000 N/cm2 pressure) in a form of a tablet (with 50 mm
diameter). The sputtering ceramic target based on SnO2
doped with 2 at.% Co (using the pressed tablet) was
synthesized by solid-phase reaction method using thermal
treatment in the atmosphere by the programmable furnace
Nabertherm, HT O4/16 (with the controller of C 42). The
final annealing was carried out at temperature range of
500 °C-1100 °C
for
20
hours.
The
synthesized
semiconductor solid solution was subjected to mechanical
treatment in order to eliminate surface defects. So, a smooth
and parallel target with a diameter of 40 mm and thickness
of 2 mm was prepared as a magnetron sputtering target (see
Figure 1).
The thin sensing layers were deposited on Multi-Sensor-
Platforms by RF
magnetron sputtering
method
using
synthesized SnO2<Co> target. The Multi-Sensor-Platforms
were purchased by TESLA BLANTA (Czech Republic).
The platform has a temperature sensor (Pt 1000) for
controlling operating temperature. There are platinum heater
and interdigitated electrodes on the ceramic substrate of the
Multi-Sensor-Platform
(see Figure 2).
The
heater
and
temperature sensor were covered with an insulating glass
layer. Gas sensitive SnO2<Co> layer was deposited onto the
non-passivated electrode structure, so the Multi-Sensor-
Platform was converted into gas sensor. Then, palladium
catalytic particles are deposited on the surface of the
magnetron sputtered sensing layer by ion-beam sputtering
method for sensitization of active layer. The working
conditions of the high-frequency magnetron sputtering and
ion-beam sputtering are presented in Table I (the base
pressure was 2×104 Pa for both cases). The manufactured
sensors were annealed in the air at 350 °C for 4 hours for
homogenization of sensing films and stabilization their
parameters. The fabrication steps of photo-assisted gas
sensor are presented in Figure 1.
The thickness of the SnO2<Co> thin film was measured
by the Alpha-Step D-300 (KLA Tencor) profiler. The result
of the study of the film-substrate transition profile is shown
in Figure 3. The thickness of the SnO2<Co> film was equal
to 180 nm.
The
electrical
and
gas
sensing
properties
of
the
SnO2<Co> thin layer was measured using a home-made
computer-controlled gas testing system. The testing system
has
a
test
chamber,
pressure
sensor
(Motorola-
MPX5010DP) and a data acquisition system (PCLD-8115)
[25]. For measurement of alcohol vapor concentration, the
SnO2<Co> based sensor (the Multi-Sensor-Platform) was
attached in the test chamber connecting the six pins (two
pins of temperature sensor, two pins of heater and two pines
of resistance measurement electrodes, see Figure 2) with the
corresponding inputs on sensor holder. The UV LED
(λ=365 nm) was attached 0.5 cm away from the active layer 
with illumination of 2 mW/cm2. The gas sensing properties
of
the
SnO2<Co>
sensor
were
measured
at
room
temperature in the dark and under UV illumination. The

response of the sensor was measured also at 200 0C
operating temperature in the dark. The working temperature
of the sensor was adjusted by changing the voltage across
the platinum heater. To have the necessary concentration of

GAS SENSING PERFORMANCES
Initially, we tested the influence of the UV illumination
on the baseline resistance of the SnO2<Co> sensor at room
temperature. It can be seen from Figure 4 that the value of
R0/RUV (~350) ratio is larger than 1, indicating the decrease
of the sensor baseline resistance under UV illumination. The
response time of the Co-doped SnO2 thin film under UV
irradiation is a few minutes.

The manufactured sensor is resistive and its operation is
grounded
on
changes
of
resistance
of
gas
sensitive
semiconductor layer under the influence of ethanol vapors
caused by an exchange of charges between molecules of the
semiconductor
film
and
absorbed
ethanol.
The
high
operating temperature of these types of sensors is mainly
due to the high activation energies of chemical reactions.
For this reason, these types of sensors mainly do not
sensitivity at room temperature. The UV light promotes the
gas adsorption and desorption on the surface of the
semiconductor participating to the sensing mechanisms [23].
Figure 5.
Resistance variation of the SnO2<Co> sensor under the
influence of UV irradiation at room temperature in the presence
of 150 ppm ethanol vapors.
The thin film SnO2<Co> based sensor did not show
sensitivity to ethanol vapors at room temperature without
UV irradiation. We measured the resistance variation (also
the signal repeatability) of the SnO2<Co> sensor in the
presence of ethanol vapors under the influence of UV
irradiation at room temperature. The resistance of the thin
film changes by almost 400 Ω in the presence of 150 ppm 
ethanol vapors (see Figure 5).
Sensor response and recovery times are in minutes and it
is clear that recovery times are faster because UV light more
stimulate the desorption processes from the surface of the
sensing layer.
Figure 6.
The SnO2<Co> sensor response to 900 ppm of ethanol vapors
under the influence of UV irradiation at room temperature.
Figure 6 shows the transient response of the SnO2<Co>
sensor in the presence of ethanol under UV light at room
temperature. The response to 900 ppm ethanol vapors under
UV illumination is sufficiently high (24 %).
We extracted the response vs. concentration curve for
the Co-doped SnO2 sensitive film. Figure 7 shows the
dependence of response on the ethanol vapor concentration
under the influence of UV irradiation at room temperature.
The dependence has almost linear characteristic, which will
allow not only to detect of ethanol vapors but also to
accurately measure the low concentrations of this gas.
Figure 7.
The dependence of response on the ethanol vapor concentration
under the influence of UV irradiation at room temperature.
The resistance change of the Co-doped SnO2 sensor
under the influence of ethanol vapors at high operating
temperature in dark conditions was also measured. The
sensitive layer resistance decreases more than 25 times in
the presence of 150 ppm ethanol vapors at 200 0C operating
temperature (see Figure 8). The response and recovery times

of the sensor at high operating temperature are a few
seconds. At high operating temperature in dark condition,
the sensor performance is quite promising but the power
consumption of fabricated sensor at 200 0C is about 2.5 W.
It is more than two orders high then the power consumption
(24 mW) needed the sensor operating with UV irradiation at
room temperature.

CONCLUSION
In summary, a simple technology has been used to
manufacture semiconductor thin film sensor based on SnO2
doped
with
2 at.% Co.
The
fabricated
SnO2<Co>
chemiresistive gas sensor showed a good sensitivity to
different concentrations of ethanol vapor (from 150 to
900 ppm) at room temperature with the activation of low-
powered UV LED (24 mW, 365 nm). The sensor displayed
a good signal repeatability and long-term stability. These
sensing characteristics made the present SnO2<Co> based
sensor a promising candidate for practically detecting
ethanol vapors at room temperature.
