Abstract—Wireless communications always strive for higher 
throughput and higher performance. The Multiple Inputs 
Multiple Outputs (MIMO)- Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme is the key Physical (PHY) layer 
feature of the next generation wireless local area networks 
(WLAN) IEEE 802.11ac standards. In this paper, we propose a 
novel MIMO-OFDM scheme based on modulation diversity for 
IEEE 802.11ac. This proposed scheme jointly optimizes the 
MIMO-OFDM and modulation diversity together, which makes 
full use of time diversity, frequency diversity and space diversity. 
It exhibits high spectral efficiency and low error rate in fading 
channels. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme 
outperforms the current MIMO-OFDM scheme based on Bit-
Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) in the 802.11ac standard, 
which is up to 7dB SNR gain.

 INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, the applications of wireless local area 
networks (WLAN) have grown very fast in hot spots all over 
the world. Through the combination of Multiple Inputs 
Multiple Outputs (MIMO) and Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing (OFDM), IEEE 802.11n significantly increases 
the maximum data rate up to 600 Mbit/s [1]. Although existing 
802.11n can support data rate up to 600 Mbit/s, it cannot yet 
meet the growing demands for higher throughput and higher 
performance. Since 2008, IEEE 802.11ac Task Group (TG) has 
developed the next generation wireless local area networks 
(WLAN) IEEE 802.11ac standard in order to achieve 1 Gbit/s 
data throughput below 6 GHz to meet the fast-growing market 
demands [2]. It extends the air interface  technologies in IEEE 
802.11n [3]. The combination of OFDM and MIMO is still a 
key feature for high-throughput transmission in the IEEE 
802.11ac standard. 
OFDM is an orthogonal multi-carrier frequency-division 
multiplexing (FDM) modulation scheme. OFDM allocates its 
transmitted symbols into narrow-band sub-carriers and 
maintain its orthogonality between the sub-carriers, so that 
OFDM can avoid inter symbol interference (ISI) due to a 
frequency selective fading channel. MIMO systems have 
attracted much more attention in wireless communications, 
because it can obtain very high spectral efficiency.  Thanks to 
these properties, MIMO-OFDM has become the foundation of 
advanced wireless transmission technologies in current WLAN 
802.11standards. 
The uncoded modulation diversity schemes based on 
multidimensional rotated constellations were proposed in [4][5] 
[6] for the conventional single-input single-output (SISO) 
scenario. The schemes are essentially uncoded and can achieve 
very high modulation diversity, which can approach to the 
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) error performance 
over fading channels. A rotated coding modulation OFDM 
system was put forward in [7], which extends the two-
dimensional modulation diversity in coded OFDM systems. 
Through the combination of rotating the MPSK/MQAM 
constellation and interleaving the symbol-components, the 
performance of wireless communications systems can be 
significantly improved in flat fading channels without time-
dispersion. Hence, a MIMO-OFDM system based on two-
dimensional modulation diversity for IEEE 802.11ac is 
proposed, which jointly optimizes MIMO-OFDM and the 
rotated coding modulation. This scheme can take full 
advantage of the coding-gain of channel codes, the time and 
frequency diversity of OFDM system and the spatial diversity 
of MIMO all together. It is more suitable for space-time-
frequency selective fading channels and exhibits the much 
better performance in wireless communications. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. An improved 
MIMO-OFDM system based on modulation diversity for IEEE 
802.11ac is proposed in Section II. Rotational modulation, the 
component interleaver and the detection algorithm in receiver 
are introduced in Sections III, IV and V, respectively. 
Simulation results are given in Section VI. Conclusions are 
reached in Section VII. 
II. 
MIMO-OFDM SYSTEMS BASED ON MODULATION 
DIVERSITY FOR 802.11AC 
An improved MIMO-OFDM scheme based on modulation 
diversity is proposed, which is shown in Figure 1. The blocks 
drawn in dotted line are the additional proposed processing 
based on the conventional MIMO-OFDM system introduced in 
[8]. 
T
N  transmit and 
R
N  receive antennas are assumed. 
In the transmitter, the number of encoders is determined by 
rate-dependent parameters [8]. Information bits are firstly 
divided between the encoders by sending bits to different 
encoders in a round robin manner, and then coded by binary 
convolutional codes (BCC) or low density parity codes (LDPC).

Afterwards, the coded bit stream is parsed into 
NSS
 spatial 
streams.  
If BCC encoding is used, BCC interleaving is performed 
within each spatial stream according to a rule in [8]. For each 
of the encoded, parsed, and interleaved spatial stream, convert 
the bit group into complex-valued symbols according to the 
modulation encoding tables. And then, the rotational 
modulation mapper converts the conventional modulated 
symbols into new complex-valued rotated symbols which 
contain in-phase (I) components and Quadrature (Q) 
components. LDPC tone mapping is skipped in this case.  
If LDPC is used, after the stream parsing, BCC interleaver 
is not used, and the coded bits on 
NSS
 spatial streams are 
converted into complex-valued symbols according to the 
modulation encoding tables. Based on the conventional 
modulated constellations, rotational modulation is carried out, 
and then the LDPC tone mapping shall be performed on all 
LDPC coded streams.  
Afterwards, the spatial interleaving and spatial Q-
interleaving are carried out over 
NSS
 spatial streams, which 
will be described in section V. The interleaved symbols are 
then mapped onto different time-frequency resource elements 
(REs) on each stream. For the Q-components, an additional 
time-frequency Q-interleaver is performed on each stream. In 
this paper, we consider that STBC is not used, so the number of 
space-time streams is the same as the number of spatial streams. 
After the spatial mapping, 
NFFT
-point Inverse FFT (IFFT) and 
inserting guard interval (GI) are implemented for each group of 
subcarriers on each transmit antenna. 
In the receiver, removing GI and 
NFFT
-point FFT are 
carried out firstly. Afterwards, the spatial demapping is 
performed. And then, the received symbols of each spatial 
stream are obtained after time-frequency Q-component 
deinterleaving, 
spatial 
Q-deinterleaving 
and 
spatial 
deinterleaving.  
If LDPC encoding is used, LDPC tone demapping is 
carried out after the above operations. For each symbol, the 
maximum likelihood (ML) rotational demodulation is used to  
produce the log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs) of encoded bits.  
If BCC encoding is used, LDPC tone demapping is skipped. 
After the ML rotational demodulation, BCC deinterleaving is 
performed.  
After the above operations, stream deparser is carried out, 
and then the channel decoder (BCC or LDPC) utilizes the 
LLRs to decode the information bits.  
III. 
ROTATIONAL MODULATION 
Modulation diversity can be achieved via the rotational 
modulation, which provides an additional modulation diversity 
gain. Through the combination of rotating the conventional 
constellation and interleaving the components, the performance 
of wireless communications systems can be improved greatly 
in fading channels.

two bit are carried by both components at the same time, which 
means the information of two bits is spread over the I- 
component and Q-component. After appropriate interleaving of 
the Q-components, the fading coefficients of the I- components 
and Q-components are uncorrelated. The modulation diversity 
order L of a multidimensional signal set is the minimum 
number of distinct components between any two constellation 
points. Assuming independent Rayleigh fading channel and the 
maximum likelihood (ML) detection, multidimensional QAM 
constellation becomes insensitive to fading channel when the 
diversity L is large [4]. 
The key of rotational modulation technique is finding an 
optimum rotational angle to minimize bit error rate (BER). 
J.Boutros studied the optimum criteria of the uncoded rotation 
modulation over the independent Rayleigh channel, and 
proposed that the diversity order L and product distance should 
be maximized [4]. Simulation results indicate that the optimum 
rotation angle depends on the modulation order and code rate 
for coded modulation. The correlation between the code rate 
and optimum rotation angle is weak. Especially for the 
high code rates from 3/4 to 8/9, the optimal rotation angles 
keep almost the same value. However, it is strongly correlated 
to the modulation order. For the same code rate, the optimal 
rotation angle values are different for QPSK, 16QAM and 
64QAM, and it decreases as the modulation order increases. 
Based on the above theoretical analysis and computer 
simulation, we obtain the optimal rotation angles that are 
suitable for  IEEE 802.11ac, which are shown in Table I. 
IV. 
Q-COMPONENT INTERLEAVER 
A. Time-frequency Q-component interleaver 
The Q-component interleaving is aimed to make the I- 
component and the Q-component in one modulated symbol as 
uncorrelated as possible in the time and frequency domain. We 
assume the OFDM system has L subcarriers in frequency 
domain for each user and 
Nsym
 OFDM symbols in time domain. 
One Q-component of a complex-valued modulated symbol is 
mapped onto one resource element 
( , )
Q f t
, which at 
the
f th
subcarrier in the 
tth
 OFDM symbol. After time-
frequency Q-component interleaving, the output is 
(

Q f t

The Q-component interleaving is defined as follows.

.Thus, the time interval 
between I-component and Q-component is 
Nsym / 2
 OFDM 
symbol duration. In frequency domain, the frequency interval 
is half of the bandwidth for each user. So, the time-frequency 
Q-component interleaver can make full use of the frequency 
diversity and the time diversity of OFDM system, and it can 
make the I-components and Q-components as uncorrelated as 
possible. 
B.  Spatial interleaver and spatial Q-component interleaver 
The spatial interleaving is the conventional spiral layer 
interleaving among all layers. Let 
i
tx   and 
i
tx  denote the input-
symbol and the output-symbol of the spatial interleaver on the 
thi  spatial stream at the t instant. The interleaving is defined as 
follows.

component of the Q-component interleaver on the

.The achievable rate of the proposed 
scheme can increase via the spatial Q-component interleaver. 
For the sake of simplicity, a system with two transmit and two 
receive antennas is firstly considered, and the symbols are 
mapped 
to 
two 
spatial 
streams.

). The total achievable rate is the sum of 
partial achievable rate on each singular-value-decomposition 
(SVD) spatial layer of the MIMO channel [11]. 
For the system without spatial Q-component interleaver, the 
fading coefficients of I- and Q-component in each symbol are 
identical.  The achievable rate can be calculated as follows.

SIMULATION RESULTS 
To validate the advantages of the proposed scheme, an 
IEEE 802.11ac link level simulation platform is programmed 
by using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (VS2005). Computer 
simulations are carried out to compare the proposed scheme 
with the conventional MIMO-OFMD scheme in current 
802.11ac standard draft. The frame structure, physical resource 
elements of OFDM system, channel model and coding are all 
based on 802.11ac standard draft [8][9], which are given in 
Table II.

that of the conventional MIMO-OFMD scheme in current 
802.11ac standard draft. From these figures, the proposed 
scheme can obtain obvious SNR gain as compared with the 
current 802.11ac MIMO-OFDM scheme. In NLOS channel, 
for BCC coding, SNR gains are about 7 dB and 4.8 dB at 
FER=0.01 for QPSK and 16QAM modulation, respectively. 
For LDPC coding, SNR gains are about 6.8 dB and 4.5 dB at 
FER=0.01 for QPSK and 16QAM modulation, respectively. 
Therefore, the proposed scheme obviously outperforms the 
current MIMO-OFDM system in 802.11ac. For higher code 
rate or lower modulation order, the SNR gain becomes more 
significant. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
An improved MIMO-OFDM scheme based on modulation 
diversity is proposed. A simple and effective space-time-
frequency component interleaver is designed to make the best 
use 
of 
space-time-frequency 
diversities. 
An 
efficient 
demodulation method is also put forward for it. This scheme 
can take full advantage of the coding-gain of channel codes 
(BCC and LDPC), the time and frequency diversity of OFDM 
system and the spatial diversity of MIMO all together. 
Simulation results turn out that it can obtain obvious SNR gain 
as compared with the current MIMO-OFDM scheme in IEEE 
802.11ac standard. In the future, more theoretical analysis and 
simulations are still required to research for the impact of 
channel estimation to our proposed scheme. In a word, our 
proposed scheme is simple, efficient and robust for the next 
generation WLAN standard.
