Reactive pulse magnetron sputtering of Al targets in a gas 
mixture of Argon and Nitrogen allows the deposition of AlN 
layers at high deposition rates of up to 200 nm/min. In the 
reported experiments films were deposited AlN onto unheated 
substrates with a thickness of typically 10 µm. Deposited films 
have been characterized for a variety of layer properties using 
e.g. XRD, SEM, profilometry, weighting and piezoelectric 
measurements regarding crystalline structure and orientation, 
surface morphology, density, film stress and piezoelectric 
coefficient d33. The characterized AlN films can be classified 
into 2 groups. The first group shows a nearly pure 001 
orientation of the crystalline structure, an undisturbed surface 
morphology, a high density and a very high piezoelectric 
coefficient d33 of up to 7.2 pm/V on silicon substrate. The 
second group exhibits a dominating but not pure 001 
orientation, disturbances in the surface morphology, a slightly 
lower density and a piezoelectric coefficient close to zero. The 
range of the process parameters pulse mode, pressure, 
sputtering power and reactive working point to achieve the 
layers of the first group is very narrow. Surprisingly films with 
high piezoelectric constant can be obtained both by strong and 
moderate particle bombardment during deposition using 
adapted parameter sets. The suitability for the intended 
application in high frequency ultrasonic phased array sensors 
systems is investigated using pulse echo measurements.

 INTRODUCTION 
New 3-dimensional integrated electronic devices, next 
generations of textured materials like carbon fiber reinforces 
polymers (CFRP) and complex multilayered devices like 
solar cells require new approaches for non destructive 
evaluation 
techniques. 
One 
area 
of 
research 
and 
development are high frequency ultrasonic phased array 
sensors systems that combine the performance of phased 
array methods with the resolution of a scanning acoustic 
microscope. The very high frequencies in phased array 
sensors require a very thin transducer thickness and cannot 
be realized with traditional piezoelectric materials like PZT 
ceramics, piezoelectric 1-3 composites or polymers like 
polyvinylidenfluoride (PVDF). A promising alternative 
piezoelectric material is aluminum nitride (AlN).  
Aluminum nitride is a piezoelectric but not ferroelectric 
material with a Wurtzite crystal structure. Compared to the 
widely used ferroelectric materials like PZT, AlN cannot be 
electrically polarized. Therefore piezoelectric activity can 
only be observed in single crystals or in a polycrystalline 
structure with a strong crystal orientation. To achieve a 
thickness vibration of the sensor, a crystalline orientation in 
(001) direction is necessary (c-axis of the AlN crystalline 
structure being oriented perpendicular to the substrate 
surface).  
In this paper, piezoelectric AlN films with a thickness of 
up to 10 µm were investigated. The reactive pulse magnetron 
sputtering process was optimized for high rate deposition of 
AlN thin films with strong piezoelectric properties. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Coatings were carried out in cluster type sputter 
equipment using the Double Ring Magnetron DRM 400 
developed at Fraunhofer FEP. This type of magnetron 
combines two concentric discharges allowing uniform 
coating of substrates with a diameter up to 200 mm [1]. 
Figure 1 shows the schematic of the deposition set up. Pulse 
powering at 50 kHz in unipolar or bipolar pulse mode was 
applied using the pulse unit UBS-C2 of Fraunhofer FEP and 
standard DC power supplies. Pure metallic aluminum 
targets were sputtered in a mixture of argon and oxygen as 
reactive gas. A closed loop control of the reactive gas inlet 
allowed stabilizing the process in the so-called transition 
mode, where stoichiometric films are deposited at high 
deposition rates.  
Using the DRM 400, the pulse mode of the pulse 
magnetron sputtering process can be changed between 
unipolar and bipolar. In the unipolar pulse mode, a pulsed dc 
is applied between each of the two targets and the separate 
hidden anode. In the bipolar pulse mode, a voltage with 
alternating polarity is applied between the two targets. For 
the two pulse modes, the plasma properties are completely 
different (Table I). Thus, variation of the pulse mode allows 
new degree of freedom to optimize deposition process. On 
one hand, the unipolar pulse mode shows low thermal 
substrate load and it allows e.g. coating of very temperature 
sensitive substrates. On the other hand, in the bipolar pulse

allows deposition of very dense films.

From literature it is known, that the sputter parameters 
strongly influence the piezoelectric behavior [2]. Thus, for 
each of the two pulse modes the power and voltage applied 
to the sputter target as well the pressure was varied to find 
optimal process parameters for the deposition of AlN layers 
with highest piezoelectric properties. In Table II, deposition 
parameters are summarized.

For the evaluation of piezoelectric properties, a simple 
ultrasound transducer test layout was used. An electrode 
structure with 10 mm diameter was deposited on an isolated 
silicon wafer. An AlN film in a circle structure with a 
diameter of 13 mm was deposited, followed by a second 
aluminum electrode to fabricate the sensor and the 
interconnection pad on the top side. The structures were 
realized by using laser cutted aluminum oxide ceramic 
masks with a high stiffness to prevent bending when being 
reused. The area of the deposited sensor layer needs to be 
larger than the electrodes themselves, because there occur 
edge effects during the deposition process, which influence 
the piezoelectric behavior of the sensor.

STRUCTURAL, ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL 
PROPERTIES 
The characterized AlN films can be classified into 2 
groups. The first group shows a nearly pure 001 orientation 
of the crystalline structure, an undisturbed surface 
morphology, a high density and a very high piezoelectric 
coefficient d33 of up to 8 pm/V. The second group exhibits a 
dominating but not pure 001 orientation, disturbances in the 
surface morphology, a slightly lower density and a 
piezoelectric coefficient close to zero. The range of the 
process parameters pulse mode, pressure, sputtering power 
and reactive working point to achieve the layers of the first 
group is very narrow. Surprisingly films belonging to the 
first group with high piezoelectric constant can be obtained 
both by moderate and strong particle bombardment during 
deposition in unipolar and bipolar pulse mode respectively. 
Figure 2 shows the XRD diagrams of films with nearly 
pure 001 orientations (002 and 004 peaks) deposited in 
unipolar and bipolar mode. Figure 3 shows the results of 
SEM investigations on these samples. The fracture in the 
SEM micrograph exhibits in both cases a dense 
microstructure. Surface morphology is rather coarse in 
bipolar compared to unipolar pulse mode. In Table III, most 
important layer properties for the two layers with highest 
piezoelectric properties are summarized. Films deposited in 
bipolar mode exhibit slightly higher values of piezoelectric 
coefficient, density, resistivity and breakdown field strength, 
but show significantly stronger compressive stress.

CHARACTERIZATION OF PIEZOELECTRIC PROPERTIES 
The AlN thin films were used already for SAW filters, 
microwave filter or resonator and ultrasound transducers [3-
5]. One possible new application is as sensor thin films in 
special phased array ultrasound transducers. For this 
application, the transformation of electrical energy in 
acoustical energy and vice versa has to be verified and 
quantified. Acoustical measurement in pulse echo mode 
were carried for each sensor to characterize the vibration 
behavior and the maximum signal voltage. Afterwards the 
electrical properties and piezoelectric charge constants were 
measured with a Berlincourt-Meter. 
A. Pulse Echo Mode 
In the pulse echo measurements the AlN sensor serves as 
an acoustic transmitter and receiver. The pulser and receiver 
DPR 500 (JSR Ultrasonics) was used to excite an acoustic 
sound wave. The ultrasound wave propagates through the 
silicon substrate, is reflected at the interface silicon-air and 
travels back to the AlN layer. The aluminum metal electrode 
with 150 nm thickness has only a very small influence and 
can be neglected. The mechanical vibration pulse gets 
transformed to an electrical signal, which can be measured.  
The illustration in Figure 4 shows the schematic setup of 
the pulse echo measurements. All AlN sensors were 
connected to the pulse generator and were excited with a 
needle pulse at high amplitude (-143 V) and very short pulse 
time (~1.4 ns). The receiver was set to a gain of 36 dB and a 
high frequency pass filter between 30 MHz and 500 MHz 
was used.

In the first tests the receiver output was connected to an 
oscilloscope, but during the evaluation of all AlN sensors 
the receiver signals where transmitted to a PC Digitizer 
Card (Aquiris U1071 A, Agilent Technologies). This 
hardware has an real-time sampling rate up to 2 GS/s and 
the amplifier response are optimized to ensure that high-
frequency measurements can be made with a bandwidth (-3 
dB) of maximum 1 GHz. The sending pulse after excitation 
could be observed, followed by multiple reflections from the 
silicon back wall. The distance between the multiple echoes 
equals the time the ultrasound longitudinal wave needs to

pass through the silicon and return back. Because of the 
small damping behavior of silicon, the echo pulse signal is 
relatively long. The evaluated sensors were deposited on 
silicon substrates with the same thickness and were excited 
with the same electrical pulse. Therefore the amplitudes of 
the received signals could be used to compare the sending-
receiving efficiency of the different AlN transmitters 
indirectly.  
In the right handed diagram of Figure 4, a typical time 
response with multiple back wall echoes is shown. To avoid 
an influence of the sending signal, the first back wall echo 
was not evaluated, but the fourth. In Figure 5, the fourth 
back wall echoes are shown for the optimized layers 
deposited in the unipolar and bipolar pulse mode as well as 
for a not optimized layer. Strong differences in the 
transmitting and receiving properties of AlN based sensor 
could be verified as result from the different sputtering and 
deposition parameters.

on the deposition parameter set. 
B. Berlincourt-Meter 
Additionally the piezoelectric charge constant (d33) was 
measured with a Berlincourt piezometer PM 300 (PiezoTest). 
The samples were clamped and loaded with an alternating 
force. The generated electric charge was compared to the 
value of a reference sample to obtain the piezoelectric 
charge constant. The measurements were carried out by 
applying an alternating force of 0.25 N and a frequency of 
110 Hz. Quasi-static measurements of the dissipation factor 
tan δ and the electric capacity of the AlN sensor layers was 
performed at a frequency of 1 kHz. 
Measured Samples piezoelectric charge constant d33for 
AlN thin films was between below 1 pC/N and 7.2 pC/N in 
maximum. The reasons for these differences is the different 
microstructure and c-axis orientation of the AlN thin films. 
Figure 6 shows, that the d33 value can be correlated to the 
maximum signal voltage obtained in the pulse echo 
measurements. Therefore the Piezometer can be used for a 
very fast estimation of the thin film quality for AlN sensors 
with the same substrate material and film thickness.

charge constants. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, the piezoelectric behavior of ultrasound 
sensors based on the AlN thin films was investigated. The 
process parameters like pulse mode during sputtering, 
power and process pressure strongly influenced the 
crystalline growth and the orientation of the thin films. As 
result, sensor samples with excellent c-axis orientation were 
obtained, that were investigated regarding their structural, 
electrical and mechanical properties. The electro acoustic 
measurements and the evaluation of the piezoelectric charge 
constants have shown good piezoelectric activity. But, the 
piezoelectric activity is depending strongly on the 
deposition parameters. For AlN thin films on silicon 
substrates, d33 was about 7.2 pC/N in maximum for films 
with nearly perfect c-axis orientation and it was below 1.0 
pC/N for films with weak c-axis orientation. Also in pulse 
echo measurements, the AlN sensors with good c-axis 
orientation showed a much higher echo amplitude.
