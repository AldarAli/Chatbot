Mental Model Construction Process and the Time Variation
Abstract— The purpose of this study is to grasp temporal
characteristics of the structural and functional models of a
mental model. The temporal characteristics were examined
from a viewpoint of thinking and memorizing. Tests were
performed using wooden blocks. As a result, it was determined
that the structural model is useful for constructing mental
models; understanding only the functional models is not
enough. For example, when the structural model is shown at
first in an operational screen or user manual, users can
understand the structure of the products or systems quickly
and can operate them easily.
Keywords - mental model; construction process; time variation.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Studies regarding temporal characteristics of mental
models have not been addressed in previous studies [1][2].
As operational screens or user manuals of products become
complicated and difficult to understand, a study of the
temporal characteristics of mental models is very important.
After users operate a product, such as a wi-fi router which is
not familiar, they cannot usually memorize how to operate it
because of temporal transition.
Mental models are important factors for users to
successfully use products or systems. The mental model is
defined as a system image in this paper. However, designers
and engineers cannot understand how to design with mental
models. The mental model consists of structural models and
functional models. Structural models refer to how products
or systems work and functional models refer to how to use
the products and systems. The structural model shows the
structure of products or systems, and the functional model
shows the procedure of operation [3]-[8].
The provision of information in the structural models
and functional models was examined in this study. The
study details are described next. Participants were asked to
construct blocks three times because of memorizing the
final shape of the blocks.
1) Participants were showed information regarding the
structural model (Section II).
2) Participants were showed information regarding the
functional model first, followed by the structural model
(Section III).
3) Participants were showed information regarding the
functional model (Section IV).
4) Participants were showed the information regarding
the structural model first, followed by the functional model
(Section V).
The structural model, functional model and the combination
of them can be evaluated by constructing the blocks without
instructions.
The common information of the method is described as
follows.
21
participants
labelled
from
“A”
to
“U”
participated in the studies. Only one participant answered
only one task. The participants were students of Kyoto
Women’s University in Kyoto and not trained for the test.
The tests were performed to determine the role of structural
models and functional models in the memorization of a
mental model. As memorizing two times is insufficient to
memorize
complicated
structures
and
the
order
of
constructing wooden blocks, a task was done three times in
order to fully memorize the structure and the order of
building the structure [9]. The number of successfully
completed shapes constructed from wooden blocks was
evaluated.
II.
STUDY 1
Participants were shown the information regarding the
structural model of the object.
A. Method
Five participants were asked to construct wooden blocks
such as cubes, rectangles, etc. The participants were
students of Kyoto Women’s University and ranged in age
from 21 to 24 years. The participants constructed a final
shape according to the following instructions.
1) The first time, participants were shown the whole
picture (the final shape) of the combination of cubes and
rectangles (see Figure 1). They were then asked to construct
the final shape showing the whole picture using wooden
blocks.
2) The second time, the entire procedure in step 1) was
repeated.
3) The third time, the entire procedure in step 1) was
repeated once more.
4) The fourth time, participants were asked to construct
the final shape without showing them the final shape first.
Five days later, they were asked to construct the final
shape without any information.
B. Results and discussion
The five participants were able to construct the final
shape (see Table I). Five days later, three participants could
construct the final shape (see Table II). As the time to
complete the final shape varied, Tables II, IV, VI, and VIII

(final picture) means providing a structural model of the
mental model.
The results show that the structural model seems to be
useful
for
constructing
a
mental
model.
After
the
participants took time to construct the wooden shape at first,
they could put together the blocks easily because they had
constructed the mental model (see Table I). As the structural
model can make participants think according to these results,
they can memorize by cue of thinking.
III.
STUDY 2
Participants were shown information regarding the
functional model first, and then the structural model.
A. Method
Six participants were asked to construct wooden blocks
such as cubes, rectangles, etc. The participants were
students of Kyoto Women’s University and ranged in age
from 21 to 22 years.
1) The first time, the participants were shown a part of
the whole picture (final shape) combined of cubes and
rectangles, in order. They constructed using the wooden
blocks in order and completed the final shape (see Figure 2.)
2) The second time, the entire procedure in step 1) was
repeated.
3) The third time, the participants were showed the
whole picture of the combined cubes, rectangles etc. They

were asked to construct the final shape shown in the whole
picture using wooden blocks.
4) The fourth time, they were asked to construct the
final shape without showing the final shape first.
Five days later, they were asked to construct the final
shape without any information.
B. Results and discussion
Three participants were able to construct the final shape.
Five days later, two participants were able to construct the
final shape.

Showing the parts of the whole picture presented in
order means providing the functional model, while showing
the whole picture (final shape) means the structural model
(see Tables III and IV). The participants seem to be able to
get the mental model by showing the whole picture which
means the structural model compared with the results of
study 2.
IV.
STUDY 3
Participants were shown information regarding the
functional model.
A. Method
Five participants were asked to construct the model
using wooden blocks such as cubes, rectangles etc. The
participants were students of Kyoto Women’s University
and ranged in age from 21 to 24 years.
1) The first time, the participants were shown a part of
the final picture in order to combine the cubes, rectangles
and so on. They put together the wooden blocks in order and
completed the final shape.
2) The second time, the entire procedure in step 1) was
repeated.
3) The third time, the entire procedure in step 1) was
repeated once more.
4) The fourth time, they constructed the final shape
without being shown the final shape first.
Five days later, the participants were asked to construct
the final shape without any information.
B. Results and discussion
Only one participant could construct the final shape (see
Table V). Five days later, only the same participant could
construct the final shape (see Table VI). The procedure to
construct blocks according to the functional model is
difficult and does not successfully allow the users to make a
mental model.
The structural model seems to be useful for users to
understand the structure or function of systems according to
the results of studies 1 and 2.

participants were students of Kyoto Women’s University
and ranged in age from 21 to 24 years.
1) The first time, participants were shown combined
parts of the final picture, in order. They then constructed
combined wooden blocks, in order, and completed the final
shape.
2) The second time, the procedure in step 1) was
repeated.
3) The third time, the participants were shown the final
constructed object. They then constructed the final shape
shown using the combined wooden blocks.
4) The fourth time, they constructed the final shape
without being shown the final shape first.
Five days later, the participants were asked to construct
the final shape without any information.
B. Results and discussion
Four participants were able to construct the final shape
(see Table VII). Five days later, only two participants were
able to construct the final shape (see Table VIII).
The grouped parts of the whole picture presented in
order represent both the functional model and the partial
structural model. Since the procedure for users to read and
understand each part and structure of the final shape was
difficult, the idea to present one unit with some combined
blocks seems to be useful. The structural model seems to be
useful for users to understand the structure or function of
systems according to the results of studies 1, 2 and 3.

DISCUSSION
The tasks evaluated in each study are presented in Figure
4. Showing the grouped parts of the whole picture presented
in order represents the functional model and structural
model. Showing the parts of the whole picture presented in
order represents the functional model. Constructing the
blocks according to the whole picture each time represents
the structural model.
For the no instructions cases, Table IX shows the
relationship between the structural model and the functional
model to verify the results of the cases with no instruction
on the first day and five days later.
The structural model influenced the construction of the
mental model according to Table IX．The structural model
easily allows users to memorize the structure according to
the results of the four studies. So, the structural model is an

important factor in constructing mental models. After we
understand the structure or frame of systems, we can
understand the substance of systems. Or, we can understand
the substance of systems based on the context created by the
functional model. The context can help users to convey the
information of the system structure. Context helps users un-

derstand and memorize the structure of systems (see
Figure 5.). Usually, the functional model causes trial and
error to be used and creates the context as a result.
When we read sentences in operational manuals to
understand the operating procedure, we normally cannot
memorize the content. This shows why the three participants
in study 3 could not memorize. The reason participants in
study 3 were not able to memorize and construct the blocks
is because there was no context with the story which
showed that the final shape was a scorpion.
Providing opportunities to think about system structure
is very important for users. When the participants tried to
look at the final shape in study 1, they were able to
understand the system structure. Understanding the system
structure means grasping the relationship among the parts of
the system. They thought about the structure and were then
able to memorize it. If the final shape was announced as a
scorpion, some participants seem to be able to construct it
easier because of a general idea of name which contains the
shape and the function.
VII.
CONCLUSION
Thinking about the structure is very important to
construct the mental model. Operating according to the
procedure without thinking about the structure, such as the
examples found in operational manuals, seems not to be
sufficient.
The conclusions based on the four studies are as follows.
(1) The structural model is useful for constructing a
mental model.

(2) While functional models can create context using a
story or other elements, they are also useful for constructing
a mental model.
(3) Providing opportunities to think about the system
structure is very important for users. Participants could not
think or imagine the structure of the whole image (final
shape) when they were using and understanding only the
functional model.
(4) When the structural model was shown at first in the
operational screen or user manual, users could easily
understand the structure of products or systems and could
easily operate them.
As user experience becomes an important factor to
design products or systems, the mental model shoud be
studied from the viewpoint of not only structural model and
functional model, but also user experience.
