Abstract—Cyber physical systems control, monitor, and 
supervise physical, technical systems using information and 
communication technology, also called operation technology. 
The focus of cyber security is protection against cyber attacks, 
their detection, and recovery from successful cyber attacks. 
Cyber resilience aims at delivering an intended outcome of the 
cyber physical system despite attacks and adverse cyber events 
and even due to failures not directly related to attacks. 
Industrial security standards define how cyber physical systems 
and the used devices can be protected against attacks (prevent). 
Despite all efforts to protect from attacks, it should always be 
assumed that attacks may happen. Security monitoring allows 
to detect successful attacks (detect), so that corresponding 
measures can be performed (react). This paper describes an 
additional, complementary approach for protecting cyber 
physical systems. The devices are designed in a way that makes 
it harder to use them for launching attacks on other devices or 
on their physical environment. A device-internal hardware-
based or isolated firewall limits the network traffic that the 
device software executed on the device can send or receive. Even 
if the device software contains a vulnerability allowing an 
attacker to compromise the device, the technically possible 
negative impact on other connected devices is limited, thereby 
enhancing the resilience of the cyber physical system in the 
presence of manipulated devices.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Traditionally, IT security has been focusing on protection 
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data at rest and 
data in transit, and sometimes also protecting data in use by 
confidential computing or by applying homomorphic 
encryption. In cyber physical systems (CPS), major protection 
goals are availability, meaning that the CPS, e.g., an industrial 
automation system, stays productive, and system integrity, 
ensuring that the CPS is in fact operating as intended and 
designed. Typical industrial application domains are factory 
automation, process automation, building automation, railway 
signaling systems, intelligent traffic management, and power 
system management. Such CPSs are also called industrial 
Internet of Things (IIoT), distinguishing them from other 
Internet of Things (IoT) domains as, e.g., consumer IoT. 
Cyber security is covering different phases during operation 
as there are protect, detect, and react: Protecting against 
threats, detecting when an attack has occurred, and recovering 
from successful attacks. With the approach of “resilience 
under attack”, it shall be ensured that the CPS can stay 
operational even during an ongoing attack, maybe with 
limited performance or functionality [1]. This property 
reduces the impact of a successful attack, as the CPS can be 
continued to be used even if parts of the CPS should have been 
attacked successfully. The availability of the overall CPS is 
thereby improved, as the CPS can stay operational even under 
an ongoing attack. 
When designing a security solution for a CPS or for a 
device used within the CPS, the focus is on protecting the 
assets of the CPS or device, by preventing attacks against the 
relevant assets. However, this approach is not complete from 
a more holistic perspective: It is also important to detect 
ongoing attacks, and to recover efficiently from an attack. 
Also, the environment of a device or a CPS has to be protected 
from attacks originating from a manipulated CPS or one of its 
devices. In particular, IoT devices have been attacked with the 
objective to use them for launching attacks against other 
systems. Dao, Phan et al. described distributed denial of 
service (DDoS) attacks originating from manipulated IoT 
devices [2]. As (consumer) IoT devices have often also a weak 
security management, vulnerabilities are often not patched in 
time, making them an easy attack target. Vulnerable IoT 
devices connected to the Internet can easily be found by using 
Internet-based device search engines like Shodan [3] or 
Morpheus [4]. 
This paper presents an approach for protecting the network 
environment, i.e., other devices of a CPS and further connect 
devices, from attacks originating from a manipulated 
component of the CPS. It is an extended version of the 
conference paper [1], extending in particular the possible 
reduction in risk exposure, see section VI. The objective is to 
limit the impact of a manipulated CPS device on other devices 
of the CPS, thereby enhancing resilience of the overall CPS. 
The intention is to keep the CPS in a trustworthy operational 
state even if some devices of the CPS should have been 
successfully attacked and manipulated. The high-level 
objective addressed by this paper is to present a design for 
resilient CPS devices that limits the possibility that an 
attacked device can be used by an attacker for further attacks

on other devices of the CPS. A manipulated device could 
otherwise provide manipulated sensor or control data to other 
CPS devices or manipulate their firmware or configuration 
data. Such manipulations of CPS devices may finally lead to 
manipulated control operations impacting the real, physical 
world, i.e., on the controlled physical process, in a critical 
way. The main idea is to extend CPS devices with a resilience 
function that allows to isolate a manipulated operational CPS 
device from other devices of the CPS. This isolation from 
other CPS devices extends the isolation from accessing the 
physical world by a manipulated CPS device by a physical-
world firewall [5]. 
After giving an overview on cyber physical systems and 
on industrial cyber security and IoT security in Sections II and 
III, a new approach on protecting the network environment 
from manipulated devices of a CPS is described in Section V. 
It is a concept to increase the resilience of a CPS when being 
under attack. Aspects to evaluate the new approach are 
discussed in Section VI, investigating the possible reduction 
of overall risk exposure of the CPS that can be achieved by 
the presented approach. Section VII concludes the paper. 
II. 
CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEMS 
A CPS, e.g., an Industrial Automation and Control System 
(IACS), monitors and controls a technical system. Examples 
are process automation, machine control, energy automation, 
and cloud robotics. Automation control equipment with 
sensors (S) and actuators (A) is connected directly with 
automation components, or via remote input/output modules. 
The technical process is controlled by measuring its current 
state using the sensors, and by determining the corresponding 
actuator signals. Also, IoT in general can be seen as a cyber 
physical system, as IoT devices usually interact via the 
physical world using sensors and actuators [5].  
Figure 1 shows an example of an industrial automation and 
control system, i.e., of an industrial CPS, comprising different 
control networks connected to a plant network and a cloud 
backend system. Separation of the network is typically used 
to realize distinct control networks with strict real-time 
requirements for the interaction between sensors and actuators 
of a production cell, or to enforce a specific security policy 
within a production cell. Such an industrial automation and 
control system is an example of a CPS and is utilized in 
various automation domains, including discrete automation 
(factory 
automation), 
process 
automation, 
railway 
automation, energy automation, and building automation. 
Figure 2 shows the typical simplified structure of IoT 
devices, e.g., automation components. The functionality 
realized by an automation component is largely defined by the 
firmware/software and the configuration data stored in its 
flash memory (FW Flash). Such an automation component 
can also be considered as a remote input/output (IO) device, 
as in many cases, its operation is controlled by a different 
control device connected via the network interface (NW IF).

In practice, it has to be assumed that each software 
component may comprise vulnerabilities, independent of the 
effort spend to ensure high software quality. This is one reason 
why automation systems are usually organized in separate 
security zones. Network traffic can be filtered using network 
firewalls between different zones, limiting the impact of an 
impact in one security zone on other connected security zones. 
In addition, it is often not possible to fix known vulnerabilities 
immediately by installing a software update, as updates have 
to be tested thoroughly in a test system before being installed 
in an operational system, and as an installation is often 
possible only during a scheduled maintenance window. Also, 
the priorities of security objectives in different security zones 
are often different, too. In CPSs, the impact of a vulnerability 
in an OT system may not only affect data and data processing 
as in classical IT, but it may have an effect also on the physical 
world. For example, production equipment could be damaged, 
or the physical process may operate outside the designed 
physical boundaries, so that the produced goods may not have 
the expected quality or even that human health or life is 
endangered.  
III. 
CYBER SECURITY OF CPS 
Protecting 
IACSs 
against 
intentional 
attacks 
is 
increasingly demanded by operators to ensure a reliable 
operation, and also by regulation. This section gives an 
overview on industrial security, and on the main relevant 
industrial security standard IEC 62443 [15]. It summarizes 
also selected security standards addressing consumer IoT 
devices. 
A. Industrial CPS Security Requirements 
Industrial security is called also Operation Technology 
security (OT security), to distinguish it from general 
Information Technology (IT) security. Industrial systems have 
not only different security requirements compared to general 
IT systems but come also with specific side conditions 
preventing the direct application of security concepts 
established in the IT domain in an OT environment. For 
example, availability and integrity of an automation system 
often have a higher priority than confidentiality. As an 
example, 
high 
availability 
requirements, 
different 
organization processes (e.g., yearly maintenance windows), 
and required component or system certifications may prevent 
the immediate installations of updates. 
The three basic security requirements in IT environments 
are confidentiality, integrity, and availability (“CIA” 
requirements). This CIA order corresponds to the priority of 
the basic security requirements typically relevant in common 
IT systems, However, in automation systems or industrial IT, 
the priorities are commonly just the other way around: 
Availability of the IACS has typically the highest priority, 
followed by integrity. Confidentiality is often no strong 
requirement for control communications, but may be needed 
to protect critical business know-how. 
Figure 3 shows that in common IT systems, the priority is 
“CIA”. As shown graphically, the CIA pyramid is inverted 
(turned upside down) in many automation systems.

Figure 3. The CIA Pyramid [13] 
Specific requirements and side conditions of an IACS like 
high availability, planned configuration (engineering info), 
long life cycles, unattended operation, real-time operation, 
and communication, as well as safety requirements have to be 
considered when designing a cyber security solution. Often, 
an important aspect is that the applied security measures do 
not put availability and integrity of the automation system at 
risk. Depending on the considered industry (vertical), they 
may also be part of the critical infrastructure domain, for 
which security requirements are also imposed for instance by 
the European Network and Information Systems (NIS) 
directive [14] or country specific realizations of the directive. 
Further security requirements are provided by applying 
standards defining functional requirements, for instance 
defined in IEC 62443. The defined security requirements can 
be mapped to different automation domains, including energy 
automation, railway automation, building automation, process 
automation.  
Security measures to address these requirements range 
from security processes, personal and physical security, 
device security, network security, and application security. No 
single security technology alone is adequate, but a 
combination of security measures addressing prevention, 
detection, and reaction to incidents is required (“defense in 
depth”).  
B. Overview IEC 62443 Industrial Security Standard 
The international industrial security framework IEC 
62443 [15] is a security requirements framework defined by 
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It 
addresses the need to design cybersecurity robustness and 
resilience into industrial automation and control systems, 
covering both organizational and technical aspects of security 
over the life cycle. Specific parts of this framework are 
applied successfully in different automation domains, 
including 
factory 
and 
process 
automation, 
railway 
automation, energy automation, and building automation. The 
standard specifies security for Industrial Automation and 
Control Systems (IACS) along the lifecycle of industrial 
systems. Specifically addressed for the industrial domain is 
the setup of a security organization and the definition of 
security processes as part of an Information Security

Management System (ISMS) based on already existing 
standards like ISO 27001 [16] or the NIST cyber security 
framework. Furthermore, technical security requirements are 
specified distinguishing different security levels for industrial 
automation and control systems, and also for the used 
components. The standard has been created to address the 
specific requirements of industrial automation and control 
systems. 
Different parts of the IEC62443 standard are grouped into 
four clusters, covering:  
− 
common definitions and metrics; 
− 
requirements on setup of a security organization (ISMS 
related, similar to ISO 27001 [16]), as well as solution 
supplier and service provider processes;  
− 
technical requirements and methodology for security on 
system-wide level, and  
− 
requirements on the secure development lifecycle of 
system components, and security requirements to such 
components at a technical level.  
The framework parts address different roles over different 
phases of the system lifecycle: The operator of an IACS 
operates the IACS that has been integrated by the system 
integrator, using components of product suppliers. In the set 
of corresponding documents, security requirements are 
defined, which target the solution operator and the integrator 
but also the product manufacturer.  
According to the methodology described in IEC 62443 
part 3-2, a complex automation system is structured into zones 
that are connected by and communicate through so-called 
“conduits” that connect different zones. A conduit maps, e.g., 
to the logical network protocol communication between two 
zones over a firewall. Moreover, this document defines 
Security Levels (SL) that correspond with the strength of a 
potential adversary. To achieve a dedicated SL, the defined 
requirements have to be fulfilled. 
Part 3-3 of IEC 62443 [18], addressing an overall 
automation system, is in particular relevant for the system 
integrator. It defines seven foundational requirements that 
group specific requirements of a certain category: 
− 
FR 1 Identification and authentication control 
− 
FR 2 Use control 
− 
FR 3 System integrity  
− 
FR 4 Data confidentiality  
− 
FR 5 Restricted data flow 
− 
FR 6 Timely response to events  
− 
FR 7 Resource availability 
For each of the foundational requirements, several 
concrete 
technical 
security 
requirements 
(SR) 
and 
requirement enhancements (RE) are defined. Related security 
requirements are defined for the components of an industrial 
automation and control system in IEC 62443 part 4-2 [19], 
addressing in particular component manufacturers.  
C. Consumer IoT Security 
While industrial CPS or industrial automation and control 
systems are called also industrial IoT, IoT in general includes 
also consumer IoT. Example consumer IoT devices are 
connected smoke sensors, connected home automation 
devices, connected washing machines, or smart cameras. 
The standard EN 303 645 [20] defined by the European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) defines 
baseline security requirements for consumer IoT devices, 
addressing cyber security and data protection (user privacy). 
It is complemented by the assessment specification 
TS 103 701 [21] and a (draft) implementation guide 
TR 103 621 [22]. The cyber security provisions defined by 
EN 303 645 address the following areas: 
− 
No universal default passwords  
− 
Implement a means to manage reports of vulnerabilities  
− 
Keep software updated  
− 
Securely store sensitive security parameters  
− 
Communicate securely  
− 
Minimize exposed attack surfaces  
− 
Ensure software integrity  
− 
Ensure that personal data is secure  
− 
Make systems resilient to outages  
− 
Examine system telemetry data  
− 
Make it easy for users to delete user data  
− 
Make installation and maintenance of devices easy  
− 
Validate input data 
The defined security requirements or examples also 
consider resilience of the overall IoT system comprising a 
huge set of IoT devices, e.g., by randomizing when an update 
check is performed. Several provisions are defined addressing 
resilience of the system with respect to outages of data 
network connectivity or power supply. The main functionality 
of an IoT device shall be maintained locally when network 
connectivity is lost, ensuring that the main functionality is 
available to users independently of network availability. IoT 
devices may reconnect after power outage with a randomized 
delay to avoid an overload on the network infrastructure by a 
huge set of reconnecting IoT devices. This maintains the 
availability of the network infrastructure after a loss of power 
in a larger geographic area.  
The National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) developed a standard for IoT security [23], with an 
associated catalogue of security requirements [24]. The 
catalogue defines requirements for the following main cyber 
security capabilities: 
− 
Device identification 
− 
Device configuration 
− 
Data protection 
− 
Logical access to interfaces 
− 
Software update

− 
Cybersecurity state awareness 
− 
Device security 
In addition, also non-technical, supporting capabilities 
have been defined: 
− 
Documentation 
− 
Information and query reception 
− 
Information dissemination 
− 
Education and awareness 
While resilience in general is not within the addressed 
scope, the requirements catalogue also includes examples 
related to resilience, e.g., that an IoT device continues 
operation when associated networks are unavailable. 
Furthermore, a draft defining baseline security criteria for 
consumer IoT devices has been published for comments [25]. 
A program on trustworthy network of things has been setup, 
where both IoT devices are protected from the Internet and 
where the Internet is protected from IoT devices, improving 
security and robustness of large-scale deployments of IoT 
devices. One aspect are manufacturer usage descriptions 
(MUD), as specified in [27], that define the intended 
communication behavior of an IoT device. It enables a 
network to block other types of network communication, 
reducing the attack surface associated to a specific IoT device. 
It also provides the possibility to automatically configure rules 
for 
communication 
traffic, 
based 
on 
the 
intended 
communication behavior. Such rules can be either directly 
applied, or after inspection and approval by a network 
administrator.  
IV. 
RESILIENCE UNDER ATTACK 
Being resilient means to be able to withstand or recover 
quickly from difficult conditions [30]. It shifts the focus of 
“classical” IT/OT cyber security, which puts the focus on 
preventing, detecting, and reacting to cyber-security attacks, 
to the aspect to continue to deliver an intended outcome even 
when an adverse cyber attack is taking place, and to recover 
quickly back to regular operation [31]. More specifically, 
resilience of a system is the property to be resistant to a range 
of threats and withstand the effects of a partial loss of 
capability, and to recover and resume its provision of service 
with the minimum reasonable loss of service quality (e.g., 
performance). It has been addressed in telecommunications, 
ensuring that subscribers can continue to be served even when 
one line is out of service [11]. Bodeau and Graubart [32] 
define resilience guidelines for providers of critical national 
telecommuni-cations infrastructure in the UK. Kott and 
Linkov [33] have compiled a book of different contributions 
addressing various aspects of cyber resilience in networks and 
systems. Besides an overview on cyber security, metrics to 
quantify cyber resilience, approaches to assess, analyze and to 
enhance cyber resilience are described. The notion of 
resilience is related to risk management, and also to 
robustness. Risk management, the “classical” approach to 
cyber security, identifies threats and determines the risk 
depending on probability and impact of a potential attack. The 
objective is to put the focus of defined security measures on 
the most relevant risks. Resilience, however, puts the focus on 
a reduction of the impact, so that the system stays operational 
with a degraded performance or functionality even when it has 
been attacked successfully, and to recover quickly from a 
successful attack. Robustness is a further related approach that 
tries to keep the system operational without a reduction of the 
system performance [12], i.e., to withstand attacks.

Figure 4. Concept of Cyber Resilience 
Figure 4 illustrates the concept of cyber resilience: Even if 
an attack is carried out, the impact on the system operation, 
i.e., the performance or functionality of the system, is limited. 
The effects of an attack are “absorbed”, so that the system 
stays operational, but with limited performance or 
functionality. A recovery takes place to bring the system up to 
the regular operation. In adaptation of resilience, the system 
might be enhanced to better prepare for future attacks. As 
stated above, a main objective in a CPS is that the CPS stays 
operational and that its integrity is ensured. In the context of 
an industrial automation and control system, that means that 
(only) intended actions of the system in the physical world 
continue to take place even when the automation and control 
system of the CPS should be attacked. 
The standard NIST SP 800-193 [28] describes technology-
independent guidelines for resilience of platform firmware. 
Resilience-specific roots of trust are defined for update of 
platform firmware, for detection a corrupted firmware, and for 
recovery from a compromised platform state. A working 
group on “cyber resilient technologies” of the Trusted 
Computing Group (TCG) is working on technologies to 
enhance cyber resilience of connected systems. Different 
building blocks for cyber resilient platforms have been 
described that allow to recover a malfunction device reliably 
back into a well-defined operational state [29]. Such building 
blocks enhance resilience as they allow to recover quickly and 
with reasonable effort from a manipulation. Basic building 
blocks are a secure execution environment for the resilience 
engine on a device, protection latches to protect access to 
persistent storage of the resilience engine even of a 
compromised device, and watchdog timers to ensure that the 
resilience engine can in fact perform a recovery. These 
building blocks are complementary to the extension described 
in section VI, and they may be used in combination.

V. 
PROTECTING NETWORK ENVIRONMENT FROM 
MANIPULATED IOT DEVICES 
The security objective “resilience under attack” means that 
a CPS, e.g., an IACS or an industrial IoT environment, should 
stay operational even when some of its components would be 
manipulated. Considering the manifold of devices used in 
real-world CPS and practical limitations to timely install 
patches, it has to be assumed that some of them will have 
vulnerabilities that can be exploited and be used to also infect 
further CPS devices. Hence, it shall be avoided that a 
successfully hacked device can be used to launch attacks 
against other devices. This is a specific security objective: 
When designing the security architecture for a device, usually 
attacks against the device are considered. Here, it shall be 
avoided that a successfully attacked device can be misused by 
an attacker to launch attacks on other devices within the CPS. 
So, the possibility to misuse a vulnerable CPS device to 
launch attacks on other devices of the CPS is reduced. 
The software execution environment executes the 
software (firmware) of the device that might have a 
vulnerability. A separated, e.g., a separate hardware based, on-
device firewall limits the network communication that the 
executed software can perform. This enforcement is realized 
independently from the executed device software, so that it is 
still working even if the device software has been manipulated 
by an attacker. This independence is a necessary pre-requisite. 
In the described design, this independence is achieved by 
separate 
hardware-based 
component. 
However, 
the 
independence from the executed device software could be 
achieved also by using an isolated software execution 
environment, e.g., a separate processor or a separate trusted 
execution environment. Using a hardware-based realization 
has the advantage of limiting the impact on real-time 
communication properties as delay and jitter, and also on the 
energy consumption. It can be easily implemented if a 
dedicated hardware-based network interface is in use anyhow 
to support real-time communication protocols.   
Possible filter criteria are source and destination network 
addresses, protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP), port numbers, transmit 
rate (frames/packets per second), or data volume. In an 
advanced form, the firewall may even verify on application 
level whether certain control flows are aligned with either the 
typical (historical) behavior of the device or with the 
engineered CPS configuration information. The policy might 
be fixed, e.g., for embedded control devices with a fixed 
functionality, or it may be configurable. Important is that the 
device software cannot modify the filter policy on its own. 
The filter policy might be adapted automatically 
depending on the patch status of the device software, or 
depending on the result of a device integrity self check of the 
IoT device, or based on a cryptographically protected health 
check confirmation received from a device integrity 
monitoring service. This would allow to keep the system 
operational, although with potentially limited capabilities, 
thus keeping it resilient. Also, limiting specific functionalities 
as result of missing device integrity may stipulate the timely 
application of patches, to get the system back to normal 
operation with full functionality and performance.

Figure 5. Attack-preventing IoT Device Architecture 
Figure 5 shows an IoT Field Device with a central 
processing unit CPU executing device firmware/software 
stored in a flash of RAM memory. The software can 
communicate over the network interface (NW IF) with other 
devices, e.g., using HTTPS or OPC UA over TCP/IP. Also, 
sensors and actuators can be connected via an input-output 
(I/O) interface. An USB interface allows to configure the 
device or to install a firmware update.  
To enhance resilience, the device includes a hardware-
based network firewall to protect the network environment 
from attacks originating from the IoT field device. It limits the 
type of network communication that can be performed by the 
device software executed on the CPU. This function is fixed, 
so that the device software cannot modify it, so that the 
filtering is performed with high level of trustworthiness. It 
would be possible as well to use a secure execution 
environment that is isolated from the main device software 
executed on its CPU. In both cases, the network firewall is 
effective even if the main device software executed on the 
CPU should be manipulated.  
The hardware-based firewall can be realized by an 
integrated circuit, e.g., an application-specific integrated 
circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), or a 
separate microcontroller or security controller, or it can be 
integrated with a hardware-based network interface. The filter 
policy might be adapted, depending on whether a 
cryptographically protected network access token (NAcT) is 
provided to the hardware firewall. The NAcT can be provided 
by a backend device integrity check service. The device 
software may provide a received NAcT token to the device 
hardware firewall, but cannot manipulate it. This allows the 
backend device integrity check service to temporarily activate 
a less restrictive policy if the device integrity has been verified 
successfully. A NAcT token can be protected by a 
cryptographic checksum, e.g., a digital signature (e.g., RSA, 
DSA, ECDSA) or a symmetric message authentication code 
(e.g., HMAC, AES-CBC-MAC). The NAcT token realizes an 
authenticated watchdog, as described by England, Aigner, 
Marochko, Mattoon, Spiger, and Thom [7]. However, here it 
is used for selecting a firewall policy, not for initiation a 
device recovery procedure. If an integrity monitoring system 
monitoring the integrity of control devices or a network-based 
intrusion detection system, realizing the device integrity check 
service, detects an ongoing attack in the IACS, it can limit 
reliably the network communications of devices, allowing to

A different approach compared to attack monitoring is to 
monitor write access to the flash memory, i.e., to check 
whether the device software (firmware) stored in the flash 
memory is updated regularly. The less restrictive, open filter 
policy stays activated only if the device firmware is updated 
regularly.  
This section described a hardware network firewall of an 
IoT device to prevent attacks of a manipulated IoT device via 
network 
communications. 
A 
related, 
complementary 
approach, limiting access to the physical world via the sensors 
and actuators connected to the input/output interface by 
manipulated software running on the CPU has been described 
in previous work [6].

physical and the cyber environment 
Both approaches can be combined in a single IoT device, 
see Figure 6. The impact of successful attacks on an IoT 
device on both the network environment as well as on physical 
world is limited. The possibility that a manipulated IoT device 
can be used for launching attacks on other connected systems 
is reduced. While shown as separate entities, both firewall 
functionalities can also be combined into a single on-device 
firewall functionality, protecting both access to physical world 
via I/O interfaces as well as access to other devices by data 
communication. After having detected a device manipulation 
by a device integrity check, restrictive filtering policies would 
be activated in a reliable way by the device so that a 
manipulated software executed on the CPU has only limited 
possibilities to perform unwanted sensitive operations 
impacting the physical world or other IoT devices of the CPS.  
VI. 
EVALUATION 
While the original motivation for ”plug and produce”, as 
defined for Industry 4.0, is to increase flexibility in production 
and to reduce the time needed to reconfigure an automation 
environment for different manufacturing tasks or batches, this 
flexibility is also advantageous for increasing resilience under 
attack: Even if some of the devices are manipulated (attacked) 
and cannot be used for production until they are patched, the 
flexibility of the overall production system allows to 
reconfigure the IACS components, avoiding or at least 
limiting the interaction with affected devices. Therefore, 
production can continue, maybe with limitations, even when 
some devices should have been manipulated. This means that 
functionality coming with Industry 4.0 can already be used 
also to increase resilience under attack, i.e., to improve 
availability of automation and production systems being under 
attack. When using the enhancement described in section V, 
it depends on the specific IACS and on the specific attack 
scenario to what degree the IACS can stay operational under 
which specific attack scenario. For the evaluation, it has to be 
determined to what degree relevant risks of the IACS are 
reduced by introducing such protection measures.  
The security of a CPS is evaluated in practice in various 
approaches and stages of the system’s lifecycle: 
− 
A Threat and Risk Analysis (TRA, also abbreviated as 
TARA) is typically conducted at the beginning of the 
product design or system development, and updated after 
major design changes, or to address a changed threat 
landscape. In a TRA, possible attacks (threats) on the 
system are identified. The impact that would be caused 
by a successful attack and the probability that the attack 
happens are evaluated to determine the risk of the 
identified threats. The risk evaluation allows to prioritize 
the threats, focusing on the most relevant risks and to 
define corresponding security measures. Security 
measures can target to reduce the probability of an attack 
by preventing it, or by reducing the impact.  
− 
Security checks can be performed during operation or 
during maintenance windows to determine key 
performance indicators (e.g., check compliance of 
device configurations) and to verified that the defined 
security measures are in fact in place.  
− 
Security testing (penetration testing, also called 
pentesting for short) can be performed for a system that 
has been built, but that is currently not in operation. A 
pentest can usually not be performed on an operational 
automation and control system, as the pentest could 
endanger the reliable operation auf the system. 
Pentesting can be performed during a maintenance 
window when the physical system is in a safe state, or 
using a separate test system. Security testing can be 
performed also on a digital representation of a target 
system, e.g., a simulation in the easiest case. This digital 
representation is also called “digital twin”. This allows 
to perform security checks and pentesting for systems 
that are not existing yet physically (design phase), or to 
perform pentesting of operational systems in the digital 
world without the risk of disturbing the regular operation 
of the real-world system. Using a dedicated test system 
or a digital twin simulation environment allows also to 
install patches and to test their effectiveness and possible 
influence on the CPS operation without interfering with 
the operational system. 
As long as the technology proposed in the paper has not 
been proven in a real-world operational setting, it can be 
evaluated conceptually by analyzing the impact that the 
additional security measure would have on the identified 
residual risks as determined by a TRA. The general effect of 
the presented resilience-under attack security measure is that 
the worst-case impact of a threat, i.e., a successful attack, on 
the physical world controlled by the CPS is reduced. 
Whatever attack is ongoing on the IT-based automation and

control system, still the possible impact on the real, physical 
world is limited. While security measures often target the 
prevention of attacks, the proposed resilience measure reduces 
the impact and thereby the risk. The impact of a threat is 
reduced if the IACS in fact can stay operational, at least with 
limited functionality, in relevant attack scenarios. A further, 
indirect effect of the improved resilience would be that 
relevant key performance indicators of the CPS, e.g., its 
uptime/availability, the output of produced goods, the 
required production time, quality-relevant metrics of 
produced goods, or the number of deficient goods are 
maintained even when the CPS is being attacked.  
However, TRAs for real-world CPS are not available 
publicly. Nevertheless, an illustrative example may be given 
by a chemical production plant performing a specific process 
like refinery, or a factory producing glue or cement. If the 
plant is attacked, the attack may target to destroy the 
production equipment by immediately stopping the process 
leading to physical hardening of the chemicals / consumables 
and thus to a permanent unavailability of the production 
equipment. In this case, trusted sensors could be used to detect 
a falsified sensor signal, and the physical-world firewall can 
be used to limit actions in the physical world. Both, the trusted 
sensors and the physical world firewall build a security 
overlay network, independent from the actual operational 
control network. Thereby, a physical damage of the 
production equipment can be avoided. If needed, a controlled 
shutdown of the production site can be performed.

Figure 7. Example Threats of a Threat and Risk Analysis 
Figure 7 shows a simplified table as used typically in a 
threat and risk analysis to collect and evaluate relevant treats 
to a technical system or component. Some selected threats are 
shown as examples. Realistic TRAs for real-world systems 
and components include usually a much longer list of threats. 
The likelihood and the impact of the threat is determined by 
judgement of competent personal, usually in a team including 
technical experts and people responsible for the product or 
system. The corresponding risk is determined based on 
likelihood and impact. It has shown to be useful to define and 
document explicitly the criteria leading to the categorization 
of likelihood and impact, including also the made assumptions 
on the operational environment. The TRA with prioritized 
risks is the basis for security design decisions, focusing on the 
most critical risks. It is the basis to define a security concept 
that includes suitable protection measures. Protection 
measures may not be technical measures only, but include as 
well organizational and personal security measures (e.g., 
performing regularly security audits and security trainings).   
Figure 8 shows how the likelihood and the impact are 
mapped to the corresponding risk value. In the example, the 
three categories unlikely, possible, and likely are used to 
describe the likelihood. For the impact, the three categories 
negligible, moderate, and critical are used. In practice, also 
more fine-granular rankings can be used, distinguishing, e.g., 
four or five different categories. Also, the risk evaluation can 
in general include further categories, e.g., disastrous. 
For the example threats shown in Figure 7, the risk that the 
device communication is intercepted is evaluated as minor, as 
the assumption in the example is that the device 
communication is protected cryptographically (e.g., by the 
Transport Layer Security protocol TLS [42]), and that the data 
would not reveal highly sensitive information.

Figure 8. Risk Mapping 
The risk that the communication is manipulated, leading 
to a manipulated device operation, is unlikely as well as the 
communication is assumed to be protected in transit. 
However, the impact is evaluated as critical, as, without 
any further protection, this threat could lead to arbitrary 
effects on the device operation and therefore also on the CPS. 
The risk that a vulnerability of the software running on the 
device is exploited is ranked here as major, as the assumption 
is that the device is not regularly patched while being 
connected to the public Internet. Therefore, it is likely that the 
vulnerability will be exploited. The functionality of the 
manipulated device could be changed in arbitrary ways, so 
that the impact can be critical, leading to a major risk. The 
threat that the device is replaced by a fake device is evaluated 
as moderate. 
An overview on the determined risks can be shown in a 
graphical risk reporting as shown in Figure 9. It gives an easily 
understandable representation on the distribution of identified 
risks. This representation can be useful to depict the overall 
risk exposure of a CPS if many risks have been identified. In 
particular, the example shows one major threat (red field) as 
well as a moderate threat (yellow field) having a critical 
impact. Butting resilience measures as the one described in 
section V into place can reduce the impact of threats, thereby 
improving the overall risk exposure.

Figure 9. Risk Reporting for the Example Threats without Resilience-Under-
Attack Protection 
If the resilience under attack protection as described in 
section IV is put into place, the possible impact of the threats 
is reduced. This effect is illustrated in Figure 10. As, in the 
example shown, the impact of the two risks with critical 
impact reduces from critical to moderate, the risk is reduced 
correspondingly. Thereby, also the overall risk situation of the 
overall CPS in which the considered device is used, is 
improved.

Figure 10. Risk Reporting for the Example Threats with Resilience-Under-
Attack Protection 
As the evaluation in a real-world CPS requires significant 
effort, and as attack scenarios cannot be tested that could 
really have a (severe) impact on the physical world, a 
simulation-based approach or using specific testbeds are 
possible approaches, allowing to simulate the effect on the 
physical world of certain attack scenarios with compromised 
components in a simulation model of the CPS, or to evaluate 
it in a protected testbed, e.g., a CPS test system. The 
simulation would have to include not only the IT-based 
control function, but also the physical world impact of an 
attack. Using physical-world simulation and test beds to 
evaluate the impact of attacks have been described by Urbina, 
Giraldo et al. [43]. They allow to analyze the impact of 
successful attacks on the physical world in a safe evaluation 
environment.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
A CPS comprises the operational cyber-technology and 
the physical world with which the system interacts. Both parts 
have to be covered by a security concept and solution. 
Traditional cyber security puts the focus on the cyber-part, 
i.e., automation and control systems. The security of the 
physical part, like machinery, is protected often by physical 
and organizational security measures, only. This paper 
presented a concept for a new approach that enhances the 
resilience of a CPS in the presence of attacked devices, by 
making it harder that a compromised CPS device is used for 
attacking other devices of the CPS. This can be a useful 
element to ensure the availability of the automation system. 
Even under attack, the automation system has not to be shut 
down completely. It can stay operational, possibly with 
reduced performance or functionality. It is complementary to 
other approaches for enhancing CPS resilience by protecting 
the physical-world interface [5] as well as to platform 
resilience measures as known from [28] [29] that allow to 
recover a manipulated device quickly and reliably back into a 
well-defined state. 
Possible future work is to not only analyze the effect on 
reducing the risk exposure of a complex real-world CPS, but 
to determine the effect of successful attacks on relevant 
operational key performance indicators of the CPS, as, e.g., 
uptime and output of a production system. A CPS simulation 
environment, i.e., a digital twin of the CPS, or a non-
operational CPS testbed can be used to analyze the impact of 
different attack scenarios on CPS key performance indicators 
that are relevant to the operation of the CPS in a safe way. 
Such analysis is considered to be relevant in particular for 
CPS, as attacks may impact not only IT-related assets, but may 
have also an impact on both the real, physical world of the 
controlled technical system and on the business-relevant 
operation of the CPS.
