Abstract— Recent studies have shown that global mobile data 
traffic has risen dramatically over the past five years. New network 
technologies and devices are introduced to handle the ever 
increasing traffic demand. An accurate application benchmark is 
required to evaluate the performance of these new cellular network 
infrastructures and devices. In this study, we measure and 
characterize the behaviour of popular cellular network applications 
such as video streaming, web browsing, file sharing, Voice over IP 
and Instant Messaging. The characterization includes both laptop 
and smartphone traffic and is expressed in the form of packet size 
and packet inter arrival time histograms. These histograms are 
required for the configuration of many synthetic traffic generation 
tools. 
Keywords- Application characterization, cellular backhaul 
network benchmark, traffic generation. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Recent traffic reports have shown that global mobile data 
traffic has grown 69-percent in 2014, it is expected to surpass 
24.3 exabytes by 2019 and mobile video traffic is accountable for 
55 percent of all traffic [1]. The increasing use of smartphones, 
tablets and laptops connected to mobile networks, in addition to 
fourth generation (4G) deployment and the acceleration of 
network connection speeds only partially account for this growth. 
New network technologies, protocols and devices have been 
introduced to handle the ever - increasing mobile demand. In 
order to reliably evaluate the performance of such emerging 
technologies, protocols and network devices, we need a realistic 
evaluation framework reflecting the current and forecasted traffic 
patterns. Characterizing application behaviour in terms of packet 
size distribution and packet inter-arrival time distribution is 
especially important for evaluating quality-of-service and user 
experience of new traffic policies, anomaly detections, active 
queue algorithms, application classifications, and scheduling 
algorithms (see, some examples in [2]-[4]). Furthermore, most 
traffic generation tools (see a comprehensive list of traffic 
generators in [5]) require either a learning trace to fit their 
synthetic generated traffic to accurate real traffic distributions or 
a manual configuration of the traffic distributions. As a result, an 
additional time consuming measuring phase is needed for proper 
operation of such tools.  
For this purpose, we actively measured and analysed the 
traffic distributions of the top most popular applications in 
cellular networks:   video  streaming, file sharing,  web browsing,  
 
and Voice over IP (VoIP). According to Allot Mobile Trends [6], 
the traffic share of these applications represents more than 95% 
of the mobile broadband traffic. The traffic in this study was 
generated by both laptops and smartphones, and the 
characterization is expressed in terms of packet size and packet 
inter-arrival time histograms. Our results can be used for fast and 
accurate configuration of traffic generation tools, applications 
traffic modelling, analysis of new traffic policies, active queue 
algorithms, scheduling algorithms, or for statistical application 
classifications. Previous internet traffic studies have analysed the 
packet size distribution of IP packets on the Internet [7]-[10]. We 
differ from these studies in several ways. First, our measurements 
were performed over a cellular network and on mobile devices 
and not over the Internet. Second, we analysed distributions per-
application and not the overall packet size distribution. This is 
essential for the evaluation of devices and algorithms that support 
more than one class of service. Third, in addition to the packet 
size distribution, we analysed the packet inter-arrival time 
distribution. This distribution is important, for example, for 
queue size tuning. Finally, to improve our understanding of 
application behaviour, we characterized uplink traffic and 
downlink traffic separately. Bonfiglio et al [11], provide detailed 
analysis of Skype traffic, but the measurements are from the 
campus Local Area Network (LAN).  In [12], smartphones traffic 
is analysed but the analysis did not include packet size and 
packets inter-arrival time histograms.  
This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present 
the data collection. Section 3 provides the application 
characterization 
results. 
Finally,

our 
conclusions.

DATA COLLECTION 
We recorded single user scenarios of the most popular 
applications: video, file sharing (downloading), browsing and 
VoIP to obtain an active dataset. The traffic was recorded from 
three iPhone devices and two laptops connected via a wireless 
modem to a cellular network. The measurements were done over 
two different cellular networks. For each device, we capture 
single user scenarios over live network during peak and non peak 
hours. As a result, any impact of other devices/users on our 
measured devices is incorporated in the traffic statistic behavior. 
Each scenario was repeated ten times. In each time, the device 
cache and cookies were cleared. According to Allot Mobile 
Trends [6] and to CISCO Mobile Trend report [1], these 
applications represent the mobile broadband application share as 
presented in Figure 1 above. They describe the subscriber 
behaviour that is likely to shape the future of the mobile internet. 
Their share of overall bandwidth has risen in 2014. In the second 
half of 2014, video streaming continued to dominate the mobile 
broadband with more than 55 percent of the global mobile data 
traffic, reflecting the demand for real-time experience. On the 
other hand, file sharing, which offers a delayed experience, 
consists of only 2 percent of overall bandwidth. In the following 
subsections, we describe the trace collection process per 
application type.  
A. Video data collection 
The trace collection for video streaming application included 
both cellular operator portal videos and Internet videos. 
1) Video Content: Three of the most frequent video content 
types were included in this trace collection: football, news and 
music clips. The major characteristics of football are the 
prevailing green field and the fast moving ball. Therefore, the 
transmissions of this video type leads to intensive traffic.  A 
news video is characterized by a small number of slow changes 
which naturally result in different transmission patterns. A music 
clip is a mixture of different characteristics. Scenes do not move 
quickly, but they change often and rapidly. 
2) Data Collection of Videos from Cellular Operators 
Portal: The trace collection involved a single user connected to 
the video directory in a operator portal server. The videos from 
the operator portal consisted of the three video clip types as 
described above. This traffic generation operation repeated ten 
times. Each time, the cache and cookies were cleared. 
3) Data Collection of Video from the Internet: The trace 
collection involved a single user connected to the Internet via 
the cellular operator network browsing to video sites. The video 
sites were YouTube [13] and Ynet [14] and the specific videos 
consisted of the three video clip types as described above. This 
traffic generation operation was repeated ten times using the 
same videos every time. Each time, the cache and cookies were 
cleared. 
B. File sharing data collection: file download/upload data 
collection and Peer to Peer data collection 
The applications in this data set were File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)-download. The 
FTP scenarios included both PUT and GET sessions. A single 
user downloaded/uploaded data using FTP GET and PUT/HTTP 
download data to a FTP/web server located in our demilitarized 
zone (DMZ). The objects were files of 1MB, 10MB, 20MB, and 
50MB in size. The traffic generation operation was repeated ten 
times. The file sharing, Peer to Peer (P2P) application types 
included both BitTorrent and eDonkey sessions. The file was 
large (more than 500MB). This traffic generation operation was 
repeated ten times for each P2P application. 
C. Browsing data collection 
The trace collection for browsing included captures of 
browsing the top 5 popular Israeli sites according to Alexa rating 
[15]: Google [16], Facebook [17], Walla [18], Wikipedia [19], 
and Mako [20].  This traffic generation operation was repeated 
ten times. Each time, the cache and cookies were cleared. 
D. VoIP, IM, Signalling, and SMS data collection 
The trace collection for VoIP included talks of approximately 
five minutes each with pre-defined lines between two users. The 
VoIP application used was Skype. The first user’s laptop ran 
Skype and was connected via a wireless connection with a data 
card connected to a cellular operator network. The second user 
was connected via our network to the Internet and also ran 
Skype. The following trace collection was used for signalling and 
Short Message Service (SMS) traffic. The user was on a moving 
train and connected to a cellular operator network. At certain 
intervals, the user sent a pre-defined SMS to a specific 
destination.  This traffic generation operation was repeated ten 
times. 
III. 
RESULTS 
The benchmark analysed each of the following applications in 
terms of packet size and the packet inter-arrival time in both the 
uplink (to the network) and downlink (to the user) directions. The 
information was represented in the form of a histogram – where 
the packet size histogram was divided into 40 byte bins, and the 
packet inter-arrival time was divided into 200 millisecond bins.  
A. Video Streaming 
As mentioned in Section 2, recordings of the video streaming 
application included both a cellular portal and an internet video. 
The content of the videos were football, news and music video 
clips, which characterize intensive traffic (football), variable 
traffic patterns (music clip) and slow transmission patterns 
(news). 
1) Video Streaming Packet Size Analysis: The video 
streaming packet size histogram is presented in Figure 2. The 
uplink stream was characterized by more than 95 percent of 
small packets (40-80 bytes). The downlink stream was 
52

characterized by large packets; between 77 percent (iPhone) and 
85 percent (laptop) of the packets were 1440-1560 bytes. 
2) 
Video Streaming Packet Inter-arrival Time Analysis: The 
video streaming packet inter-arrival time histogram is presented 
in Figure 3. In both directions, the packet inter-arrival time was 
very low, and more than 95 percent of the packets had an inter-
arrival time of less than 200 milliseconds. More than 10 percent 
of the packets in the uplink flows had a zero inter-arrival time 
and more than 85 percent of the packets were less than 200 
milliseconds. The downlink flows had more zero inter-arrival 
packets (25 percents); thus, only 60 percent of the packets had 
an inter-arrival time of less than 200 milliseconds. Note that 
“zero” is not really a zero inter-arrival time but appears as such 
because it is lower than the time resolution of the application 
(Wireshark [21]) used to  captures these recordings. 
B. File sharing 
As mentioned in Section 2, recordings of file download and 
upload included FTP, HTTP download on both Bitorrent and 
eDonkey sessions. The sizes of the files downloaded were 1 MB, 
10 MB, 20 MB and 50 MB. The P2P sessions were used to 
download a large file (more than 500 MB). 
1) File Sharing Packet Size Analysis: The file sharing packet 
size histogram is presented in Figure 4. Almost 100 percent of 
the packets in the iPhone’s upload recordings were small 
packets: 40-80 bytes in size. In the laptops recordings, 72 
percent of the packets were small and only around 23 percent 
were large packets of 1400-1480 bytes. The downlink stream 
was characterized by large packet size; 44 percent of the packets 
were 1440-1480 bytes and more than a one third of the packets 
were 1520-1580 bytes. The mid-size packets (1040-1120 bytes) 
accounted for 21 percent of the packets on the iPhone, and only 
6 percent of the laptop captures. Small packets (40-80 bytes) 
also accounted for 10% for the laptops. 
2) 
File Sharing Packet Inter-arrival Analysis: The file 
sharing inter-arrival time histogram is presented in Figure 5. 
Both in the uplink and the downlink traffic the packet inter- 
arrival time was extremely low. More than 95 percent of the 
packets had an inter-arrival time below 200 milliseconds. The 
uplink captures consisted of approximately 50 percent of the 
packets with a zero inter-arrival time (that is, smaller than 0.1 
milisecond), and the remainder with an inter-arrival time of less 
than 200 milliseconds. The downlink captures were composed of 
more than 65 percent of packets with a zero inter-arrival time, 
and around 30 percent of the packets with an inter-arrival time 
of less than 200 milliseconds.

C. Web Browsing 
As mentioned in Section 2, recordings of browsing were of 
the top five popular live websites in Israel according to [15]. 
1) Web Browsing Packet Length Analysis: The Web 
browsing packet size histogram is presented in Figure 6. Though 
exhibiting the same tendency, the iPhones downlink browsing 
traffic was somewhat different from the laptop downlink 
browsing traffic. All in all, the majority of the packets were 
large, in the range of 1440-1480 bytes and 1520-1560 bytes. 
Some small packets from 40 bytes to 80 bytes were observed as 
well. The uplink browsing traffic for both the iPhone and laptop 
was characterized by small packets with more than 80 percent of 
the packet lengths between 40 bytes and 80 bytes. The rest of 
packets were evenly distributed throughout the range with 10 
percent divided between mid-size packets (360 bytes to 680 
bytes).  
2) Web Browsing Packet Inter-arrival Time Analysis: The 
Web browsing inter-arrival time histogram is presented in 
Figure 7. The iPhone and the laptop recordings on both uplink 
and downlink streams presented the same trend but with 
different percentages. The downlink and the uplink traffic were 
characterized by a very low packet inter-arrival time; more than 
90 percent of the packets had an inter-arrival time of less than 
one second.  One third of the packets had a zero inter-arrival 
time for the uplink traffic. Around half of the packets had an 
inter-arrival time of less than 200 milliseconds. Four percent of 
the packets had an inter-arrival time of more than 5 seconds. 
More than 53 percent of the packets had a zero inter-arrival time 
for the downlink traffic, and more than a third of the packets had 
an inter-arrival time of less than 200 milliseconds. Only 3 
percent of the packets had an inter-arrival time of more than 5 
second. 
D. VoIP, IM, Signalling, and SMS 
As mentioned in Section 2, recordings included conversations 
on Skype of approximately five minutes between two users with 
predefined talk content. 
1) VoIP and IM Packet Length Analysis: The VoIP and IM 
packet size histogram is presented in Figure 8. Uplink streams 
consisted of mostly small packets at 40-80 bytes whereas the 
downlink streams also had 12 percent of large packets of 1440-
1560 bytes.  
 
2) VoIP and IM Packet inter-arrival Time Analysis: The 
VoIP and IM inter-arrival time histogram is presented in Figure 
9. In both directions, more than 87 percent of the packets had an 
inter-arrival time of less than a second. Whereas in the uplink 
stream more than 40 percent of the packets had a zero inter-
arrival time and 20 percent were less than 200 milliseconds, the 
downlink exhibited the reverse pattern: only 20 percent of the 
packets had a zero inter-arrival time and 40 percent had less than  
a 200 millisecond inter-arrival time. In both directions 4 percent 
of the packets had an inter-arrival time exceeding 5 seconds. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This study aimed at: 
 
The measurement and dataset collection of traffic in 
cellular networks from laptops and smartphones of the 
most popular applications in cellular networks: video 
streaming, file sharing, web browsing, and VoIP.  
 
Per application characterization in terms of packet size 
and packet inter-arrival time histograms that can be used 
for traffic generation tool configurations, or for 
applications traffic modelling and analysis or for 
statistical application classification. 
In terms of characterizing these applications, the analysis 
shows that: 
 
Video streaming, web browsing and file sharing have 
very short packet inter-arrival times (less than 200 ms) 
and have similar distributions. VoIP and IM have longer 
packet inter-arrival times. We believe that this is a result 
of the relatively slow human interaction integrated in 
these applications.

 
The packet sizes of smartphones are slightly smaller than 
the packet sizes of laptops.  
 
Video streaming, web browsing and file sharing have 
asymmetric packet size distributions in the downlink and 
uplink directions. The packet sizes in the downlink 
direction are usually large (> 1440 Bytes) whereas the 
packet sizes in the uplink direction are usually small (< 
100 Bytes). That is, current packet sizes seem mostly 
bimodal at 80B for uplink traffic and 1440-1560B for 
downlink traffic. This observation supports a previous 
recent Internet measurement study [8] but with slightly 
different values (40B and 1500B were reported in [8]). 
This observation represents a shift away from the 
common wisdom such as the pre-2000 data that reported 
tri-modal packet sizes around 40, 576, and 1500B [9]. 
 
VoIP and IM have symmetric packet size distributions in 
the downlink and uplink directions. The packet sizes in 
both directions are small (< 100 Bytes). This observation 
supports a previous recent LAN measurement study [11]. 
However, 
the 
observed 
inter-arrival 
times 
were 
significantly larger in our measurements.  A possible 
explanation is the difference between LAN and cellular 
backhaul network behavior.  
 
In the downlink direction of file sharing applications, we 
observed an additional common value range around 
1040-1080B. 
For fast traffic generation tools configuration, Table I 
summarizes the packet size average and standard deviation per 
application and Table II summarizes the packet inter-arrival time 
average and standard deviation per application.
