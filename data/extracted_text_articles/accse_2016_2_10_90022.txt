Abstract— This paper suggests a real-time method for 
detecting both visual and cognitive distraction using lateral 
control performance measures including standard deviation of 
lane position (SDLP) and steering wheel reversal rate (SRR). 
The proposed method adopts neural networks to construct 
detection models. Data for training and testing the models were 
collected in a driving simulator in which fifteen participants 
drove through a highway. They were asked to complete either 
visual tasks or cognitive tasks while driving to create distracted 
driving periods. As a result, the best performing model could 
detect distraction with an average accuracy of 93.1%.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Recent technological advances have enabled a wide 
variety of information systems to be integrated into a vehicle 
in order to increase safety, productivity, and comfort. 
However, drivers are also exposed to more distraction 
sources than before [1]. The driver’s distraction is a specific 
type of inattention that occurs when drivers divert their 
attention away from the driving task to focus on another 
activity instead [2]. The major types of in-vehicle distraction 
can be categorized into visual-manual and cognitive 
distraction.  
There have been efforts to monitoring driver’s distraction 
in real time using driving performance [3], eye movement 
measures [4][5], and physiological measures [6]. However, 
most previous studies have focused on a specific distraction 
type, either visual or cognitive. 
Thus, this paper presents results using neural networks 
for detecting and classifying visual and cognitive driver's 
distractions trained using lateral control performance 
measures, including the Standard Deviation of Lane Position 
(SDLP) and Steering wheel Reversal Rate (SRR).  
II. 
DISTRACTION CLASSIFICATION MODEL  
As shown in Figure 1, lateral performance measures 
including SDLP and SRR have different profiles according 
the type of distraction. Based on this behavioral difference, 
the distraction detection and classification model was 
constructed. 
A. Experimental Setup for Learning Data Collection 
The experiment was conducted in the DGIST fixed-based 
driving simulator, which incorporated STISIM Drive™ 
software and a fixed car cab. The virtual roadway was 
displayed on a wall-mounted. Sensory feedback to the driver 
was also provided through auditory and kinetic channels. 
Distance, speed, steering, throttle, and braking inputs were 
captured at a nominal sampling rate of 30 Hz. 
B. Generation of distraction 
In this study, visual distraction was generated by an 
arrow search task, which only required visual processing 
demand and minimal cognitive processing [7]. The arrow 
search task had three different arrangements of arrows to 
create three levels of difficulty. Cognitive distraction at three 
distinct levels was created using an auditory delayed digit 
recall task, so called n-back task. The n-back task requires 
participants to repeat the nth stimulus back in a sequence [8]. 
C. Experimental Procedure 
Fifteen young males, in the 25-35 age range (M=27.9, 
SD=3.13), were recruited to collect visually and cognitively 
distracted driving data. Following informed consent and 
completion of a pre-experimental questionnaire, participants 
received 10 minutes of adaptation time in a simulator. The 
simulation was then stopped and participants were trained in 
the n-back task while remaining seated in the vehicle. When 
the simulation was resumed, participants drove on a straight 
highway twice, one for visual distraction and the other for 
cognitive. Each driving takes about 20 minutes, and 
participants perform a secondary task, i.e., n-back task or 
arrow task at a specified segment.

D. Input Features 
The SDLP and the SRR were used for detecting both 
types of distraction in the classification models. The SRR 
was calculated by counting the number of steering wheel 
reversal from the low pass filtered steering wheel angle per 
minute. For cognitive distraction, the selected cut-off 
frequency of the low pass filter was 2Hz and the gap size of 
the reversal angles was 0.1 degree.  For visual distraction, 
the cut-off frequency and the gap size were 0.6Hz and 3 
degrees. The SDLP in both distraction types was calculated 
from 0.1Hz high pass filtered lateral position based on the 
AIDE report [9]. 
E. Model Training and Testing 
Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Networks (RBPNN), 
which are known as one of suitable methods for 
classification problems [10], were used to construct the 
driver’s distraction classification model. For training and 
testing the distraction detection models, the simulated 
driving data sets were used. Each data set consists of a 
driving only period and three levels of distracted driving 
periods. Each task duration was divided into multiple 
segments based on a time window size. This study 
considered seven window sizes, i.e., 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 
30 seconds. Among the segments in each task, half of them 
were used for training and the others for testing. 
III. 
RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
The performance of the distraction detection models 
varies depending on the window sizes. As shown in Table 1, 
the time windows between 3 and 10 seconds provided good 
performance in overall. Under the visual distraction, the 
highest accuracy was 98.5% with 10 seconds window, but 
the model performance was degraded when the window sizes 
are smaller than 3 seconds or bigger than 15 seconds. In the 
cognitive distraction, the best accuracy was 93.6% with 2 
seconds window. 
In general, the SRR represents the control effort needed 
to cope with time sharing induced by a secondary task, and 
thus provides a direct measure of the consequences of visual 
or cognitive demand on lateral control. Thus, the increased 
SRR could be interpreted in terms of increased workload. 
Regarding the SDLP, the increased SDLP is often observed 
under visual distraction, but cognitive distraction causes the

reduced SDLP [11]. Due to the characteristics of lateral 
performance measure, the classification performance in 
visual distraction could have specific regions of window size 
to provide better accuracy rate. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION  
In this paper, we proposed a real-time method for 
detecting both types of driver’s distraction using the lateral 
control performance measures including SDLP and SRR. In 
order to collect training and testing data, fifteen participants 
drove in a driving simulator and completed three different 
levels of cognitive and visual tasks. The distraction detection 
and classification was performed by RBPNN models. 
The results show that the proposed models were able to 
detect both types of driving distraction with high accuracy. 
The model performance was assessed with the cross-
validation scheme. As a result, the highest accuracy rate in 
overall model performance was 93.1%. And it is also 
expected that the accuracy can be improved by applying 
more sophisticated algorithms and supplementary inputs.
