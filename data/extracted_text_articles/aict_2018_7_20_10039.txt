Abstract— A major drawback of Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals is extremely high 
Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). Signals with high 
PAPR lead to a lowering of the energy efficiency of the 
Power Amplifiers (PAs) and the shortened operation time 
causes a serious problem in battery-powered wireless 
terminals. In this paper, we propose a new power saving 
technique for wireless terminals. It is the combination of 
a polar modulation technique and Constant Amplitude 
Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) equalizing technique. 
Proposed the polar modulation technique for the PA 
employs a current control by changing the common-gate 
stage bias in a cascade amplifier circuit. The CAZAC 
equalization scheme makes the PAPR of M-array 
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) OFDM 
signals into the PAPR of M-QAM single-carrier signals. 
By using CAZAC-OFDM signal, proposed polar 
modulation PA exhibits overall efficiency of 40% at Error 
Vector Magnitude (EVM) of -32dB. Furthermore, a 
breakthrough technique which transcends barrier of 50% 
efficiency has been proposed. A prototype of Single Ended 
Push-Pull amplifier (SEPP AMP) exhibits power gain of 
15dB over 100MHz to 1GHz, the maximum efficiency of 
65% without polar modulation scheme.

 INTRODUCTION 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) 
system for high speed and high capacity communications is 
recently attracting attention in wireless applications, e.g.,  
3GPP LTE, Wi-Fi and WiMAX. It is well known that one of 
the most serious drawbacks of the OFDM system is its high 
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which decreases the 
energy efficiency of power amplifier (PA) and increases 
transmitter power consumption. In mobile communications, 
high PAPR signal negatively affects device battery life.  
To overcome the above problem, many techniques are 
proposed: Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS), Selected 
Mapping (SLM), etc. [1]. PTS and SLM techniques choose 
respectively the phase factor and candidate data block to 
minimize the PAPR of transmission signal, which improves 
PAPR performance. However, those techniques need side-
information in the receiver side, i.e., phase factor and 
candidate number information, in order to demodulate the 
received signal correctly, which result in degradation of 
spectral efficiency, and additional power consumption of 
DSPs. 
On the other approach to overcome the problem, some 
circuit topology for high-efficiency OFDM power amplifier 
design have been  proposed [2]. Here, a polar modulation PA, 
or an envelope tracking PA, is the most promising one. In the 
polar modulation, OFDM signal is separated into phase 
modulation (PM) component and amplitude modulation 
(AM) one. The PM component is input to the PA as the 
quadrature signal with constant amplitude. On the other, the 
AM component is used as envelope tracking data, which 
supplies to the PA as drain DC biasing from adaptive output 
power supply using a DC-DC converter. In general, the 
efficiency of PAs operating in saturation region is higher than 
one in linear region. Therefore, the polar modulation PA 
improves energy efficiency under full-time operation in the 
saturation region. 
In this paper, we propose a new power saving technique 
for wireless terminals. It is the coupling technique between 
envelope tracking operation of PAs and CAZAC (Constant 
Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation) equalizing.  Here, we had 
reported an original polar modulation PA using a cascade 
circuit topology [3]. One can control output power by 
changing common-gate stage biasing in accordance with 
signal envelope, which improves energy efficiency of PA by 
full-time operation in saturation region. Since the polar 
modulation is a simple method of separating into amplitude 
information and phase information, it can cope with all 
modulation schemes. We also reported that one CAZAC 
sequence in cooperation with IFFT signal-process converted 
the PAPR of the M-QAM OFDM signal into the PAPR of an 
M-QAM single-carrier signal. Here, this fact was our original 
discovery [4].  
In this paper, this coupling technology has novelty and 
effectiveness in combining the features of CAZAC-OFDM 
which is constant amplitude and the characteristics of this PA 
which is power saving, where a more power-saving system 
can be created. The coupling technique reduces the PAPR of 
5 dB at the 16QAM-OFDM signal while the system imposed 
no penalties on the BER performances. By using CAZAC-
OFDM signal, proposed polar modulation PA exhibits overall 
efficiency of 40% or more at error vector magnitude (EVM) 
of -32dB which satisfies the requirement of IEEE 802.11 ac 
specification [5]. 
Moreover, a breakthrough technique, which transcends 
barrier of 50% efficiency has been proposed. As well-known, 
a Class-B amplifier allows operating at a power efficiency of 
115

78.5%, while a Class-A amplifier operates at a power 
efficiency of 50%. The Class-B amplifiers, however, are 
strongly difficult to achieve high frequency and high linearity 
operations at the same time.  
Our proposal of new circuit topology is certain kind of 
single ended push-pull amplifier, or SEPP AMP, using a 
complementary MOSFET technology. The circuit topology is 
suitable for monolithic circuit configuration and easily 
applied commercially available process of CMOS foundries. 
A prototype of the SEPP AMP exhibits power gain of 15dB 
over 100MHz to 1GHz and the maximum efficiency of 65% 
with no use of polar modulation scheme. 
Up to now we have shown that the polar modulation 
system is effective with various modulation schemes [3][4]. 
On the other hand, the contribution of this paper is to 
demonstrate the achievement of unprecedented power 
efficiency by combining CAZAC-OFDM which achieved the 
same PAPR as the single carrier in the world and power-
saving polar modulation system. 
This paper is organized as follows. SectionⅡ presents the 
proposed the operating principle of the coupling technique 
between envelope tracking operation of PAs and CAZAC. In 
SectionⅢ, a performance of proposed system is presented. In 
Section Ⅳ, the operating principle of further improvement of 
OFDM-PAs with SEPP and simulation results are given. 
Finally, SectionⅤ concludes this paper. 
II. 
PROPOSED SYSTEM 
In the proposed system, CAZAC-OFDM and polar 
modulation are used together to improve energy efficiency. 
Below, we explain CAZAC-OFDM and polar modulation 
and propose a system with improved efficiency. A 
description of OFDM system in section A, CAZAC 
equalizing technique in section B, and polar modulation 
technique in section C are shown. 
A. OFDM system 
In OFDM system, the frequency domain symbol 𝑿 =
[𝑋0, 𝑋1,… , 𝑋𝑁−1]𝑇  is modulated by 𝑁  size inverse Fast 
Fourier Transform (IFFT). The discrete-time OFDM signal 
with 𝑁 subcarriers is represented as 
𝑥𝑛 = ∑ 𝑋𝑘𝑒𝑗2𝜋𝑘𝑛/𝑁
𝑁−1
𝑘=0
, 
(1) 
where 𝑗 = √−1  and 𝑛  is discrete time index. On the other 
hand, receiver acquires frequency domain symbol 𝒀  by 
applying FFT to received signal 𝒚. 
𝑌𝑘 = ∑ 𝑦𝑛𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑘𝑛/𝑁
𝑁−1
𝑛=0
 
= ∑(𝑥𝑛 + 𝑁𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒)𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑘𝑛/𝑁
𝑁−1
𝑛=0
. 
(2) 
The PAPR of the OFDM signal (1) can be expressed as 
𝑃𝐴𝑃𝑅 =
max
0≤𝑛≤𝑁−1|𝑥𝑛|2
E[|𝑥𝑛|2]
, 
(3) 
where E[∙]  is expectation operator. PAPR represents 
amplitude fluctuation of each symbol. In order to improve the 
accuracy of PAPR, the OFDM signal 𝑥𝑘 is converted to 𝐿-
times oversampled time domain signal [1]. 
As shown from (2), the OFDM signal is composed of a 
plurality of subcarrier signals, which causes an increase in 
amplitude fluctuation. A high PAPR signal increases the Input 
Back Off (IBO) at the power amplifier in order to amplify the 
transmit signal without distortion. In general, increasing in 
IBO causes decreasing the efficiency of PA. 
B. CAZAC equalizing technique 
CAZAC sequence is constant amplitude and provides a 
good 
cross-correlation 
property. 
Therefore, 
CAZAC 
sequence is used in wireless communication systems such as 
channel estimation and time synchronization. The Zadoff-
Chu sequence 𝑐𝑘 which is one of the CAZAC sequences is 
represented as 
𝑐𝑘 = 𝑒𝑗𝜋𝑘2/𝑁2, 
(4) 
where 𝑘 = 0, 1, … , 𝑁2 − 1  denotes the sequence index. In 
this paper, CAZAC 𝑁 × 𝑁 matrix 𝑴 is represented as 
𝑴 = [
𝑐0
𝑐1
⋯
𝑐𝑁−1
𝑐𝑁
𝑐𝑁+1
…
𝑐2𝑁−1
⋮
⋮
⋱
⋮
𝑐(𝑁−1)𝑁
𝑐(𝑁−1)𝑁+1
…
𝑐𝑁2−1
]. 
(5) 
In CAZAC-OFDM system, multiply the signal with M 
before the IFFT of the transmitter. frequency domain symbol 
𝑿′ = [𝑋0
′, 𝑋1
′, … , 𝑋𝑁−1
′
]𝑇 is represented as 
𝑿′ = 𝑴𝑿. 
(6) 
Therefore, the CAZAC-OFDM time signal x′  is 
represented as 
𝑥𝑛′ = ∑ 𝑋𝑘
′ 𝑒
𝑗2𝜋𝑘𝑛
𝑁
𝑁−1
𝑘=0
 
= 𝑁 ∙ 𝑐(𝑁/2−𝑛)mod 𝑁 ∙ 𝑋(𝑁/2−𝑛)mod 𝑁. 
(7) 
Receiver side can demodulate the original frequency 
domain symbol with using conjugate 𝑴𝐻 [4]. 
Figure 1 shows PAPR performance of OFDM, CAZAC-
OFDM and single carriers with using complementary 
cumulative distribution function (CCDF). Each signal has 64 
subcarriers and oversampling factor 𝐿 =  4. As shown from 
Figure 1, CAZAC equalization improves PAPR performance 
about 2.5 dB of PAPR when CCDF value is 10−3. In addition, 
the PAPR of CAZAC-OFDM and M-QAM signal is same 
performance, which results from (7). 
C. Polar modulation technique 
In polar modulation system, AM and PM components are 
input separately into PA as power voltage and quadrature 
modulation signal respectively. General polar modulation 
system supplies AM component into PA by using dc-dc

converter. However, efficiency of dc-dc converter is around 
90%, which affects overall efficiency of transmission system 
[6]. We have proposed new polar modulation technique 
without dc-dc converter [3]. In this system, quadrature 
modulation signal and AM component are input to the 
common-source and common-gate stage in cascade PA. 
Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the proposed system. 
Mapping data after serial-parallel conversion is applied 
CAZAC precoding matrix 𝑴 . Secondly, CAZAC-OFDM 
signal after IFFT is separated into PM and AM component. 
Quadrature modulation signal which is composed of PM 
component of CAZAC-OFDM is input to cascade PA. 
Lookup table converts AM component to 𝑉𝐶𝑂𝑁  to control 
envelope of output signal. 𝑉𝐶𝑂𝑁 applies to the common-gate 
stage in cascade PA. 
We suppose OFDM signal in IEEE 802.11 specifications. 
Therefore, CAZAC-OFDM system must limit bandwidth [4]. 
In proposed system, we increase the number of data 
subcarriers and decrease the symbol rate to meet spectrum 
mask defined IEEE 802.11 specification, which doesn’t affect 
data rate of proposed system. 
Prototype cascade PA is shown in Figure 3. In proposed 
system, the quadrature modulation signal is input to 
prototype PA as 𝑅𝐹𝐼𝑁. On the other hand, proposed system 
changes the common-gate stage voltage 𝑉𝐶𝑂𝑁  to control 
envelope of output signal 𝑅𝐹𝑜𝑢𝑡 . Figure 4 shows the 
amplitude and phase shift of output at prototype cascade PA 
with 10dBm of quadrature modulation signal as input. As 
shown from Figure 4, changing the common-gate voltage 
𝑉𝐶𝑂𝑁  affects the power of output signal 𝑅𝐹𝑜𝑢𝑡 . Proposed 
system controls 𝑉𝐶𝑂𝑁 to linearly amplify the input signal.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
We compare conventional OFDM system and proposed 
system combined CAZAC-OFDM and polar modulation PA. 
We show the setup of the simulation in section A and the 
result in section B. 
A. Setup 
We compare conventional OFDM system and proposed 
system combined CAZAC-OFDM and polar modulation PA.  
We have simulated the proposed system by the Advanced 
Design System 2016.01(ADS) and MATLAB 2014α. In 
proposed system, we use MATLAB to generate text files of 
data set of CAZAC-OFDM IQ signals which are input to 
polar modulation PA designed by ADS and output signal of 
PA in ADS is demodulated in MATLAB.We use ADS 
pallet’s OFDM signal source “WLAN IEEE 802.11” in 2.4 
GHz and “SpectrumAnalyzerResBW” to measure spectrums. 
Table Ⅰsummarizes the simulation specifications. As carrier 
frequency, we use 2.4 GHz, which is industrial, scientific and 
medical (ISM) radio bands. Since we don’t evaluate bit error 
rate performance, we apply no encoding to transmission 
signal. If the coding rate is 1/2, data rate of proposed system 
is 24 Mbps in IEEE 802.11g. CAZAC-OFDM system don’t 
have null subcarriers. Therefore, we extend symbol time of 
CAZAC-OFDM to meet spectral mask in IEEE 802.11.

versus average output power. EVM represents demodulator 
performance in wireless communication system. In IEEE 
802.11 a/g specifications, EVM of transmitter system must           
be less than -25 dB. As shown from Figure 5, simulated EVM 
is deteriorating with increasing average output power, which 
is caused by non-linear characteristic at polar modulation PA. 
CAZAC-OFDM system has superiority of about 2 dB in 
EVM as compared with the conventional OFDM system, 
which is caused by improving PAPR performance by 
CAZAC equalization (Figure 1). 
The overall efficiency is shown in Figure 6. In the case of 
-25 dB or less of EVM, the efficiency of OFDM system is 
about 42 %. On the other hand, the efficiency of CAZAC-
OFDM system is about 48 % in IEEE a/g specifications. 
Moreover, IEEE 802.11 ac specification requires the EVM of 
transmission signal ≤  32 dB. The efficiency of proposed 
system is about 42 % at EVM of -32 dB in IEEE 802.11 ac 
specification, which is due to improve PAPR performance by 
CAZAC equalization. Efficiency means drain efficiency in 
this paper. 
Figure 7 shows power spectral density of proposed system 
with CAZAC-OFDM and OFDM system. CAZAC 
equalization improves a roughly 5 dB in adjacent channel 
power ratio (ACPR). To sustain high efficiency at PA, IBO is 
required to be small. In the case of using high PAPR signal,  
small IBO causes nonlinear distortion. Since CAZAC 
equalization improves PAPR performance, ACPR of pro-
posed system is suppressed.

PROPOSAL OF FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF OFDM-
PAS 
In addition to conventional amplifiers, we would like to 
propose a class B biased wireless amplifier which we could 
not realize until now. There is still a problem and class B 
behavior is not realized, but I would like to show a prototype 
circuit with reference to SEPP. We show the circuit topology 
in section A, the setup of the simulation in section B and the 
result in section C. 
A. Circuit topology 
Since the OFDM exhibit large PAPR and wide bandwidth, 
the PAs should deliver high efficiency and linearity over wide 
bandwidth and input dynamic range. Generally, a class-A PA 
has preferred for good linearity, but lowered efficiency under 
the condition of small input range. The polar modulation PA 
mentioned previously, exhibits good efficiency over wide 
input dynamic range as well as linearity. However, it requires 
additional signal processing circuits and order-made look-up 
tables for specific devices.On the other hand, instead of class-
A, a PA operated at a deep class-AB or class-B achieves a

high efficiency in wide input dynamic range, although it has 
a large gain deviation and degradation of linearity 
performance. Here, to overcome the problems of class-B PAs, 
it is considered that push-pull amplifier scheme is one of 
dominant candidates.  
Our proposal is a certain kind of single ended push-pull 
amplifier, or SEPP AMP, using a complementary MOSFET 
technology, as in shown in Figure 8. The circuit topology is 
suitable for monolithic circuit configuration and easily 
applied commercially available process of CMOS foundries. 
As shown in Figure 8, the output may be direct-coupled to 
the load connected through a dc blocking capacitor. Where 
both positive and negative power supplies are used, the load 
can be returned to the midpoint (ground) of the power 
supplies. The NMOS and the PMOS amplify only half the 
sinusoidal waveform and is cut off during the opposite half. 
In a deep class-AB or class-B operation, the amplifier has 
favorable features, i.e., low idle current and small quiescent 
current. The features provide improved efficiency over wide 
input dynamic range. Moreover, symmetrical construction of 
the two sides of the circuit means that even-order harmonics 
are cancelled, which can reduce distortion and improve 
linearity  
Figure 9 shows the block diagram of transmitter with 
CAZAC-OFDM scheme for the SEPP AMP. 
B. Setup 
In ADS, both gate length of the NMOS and the PMOS is 
0.18 μm. The transconductance gm of the NMOS and the 
PMOS is 513mS/mm and 253mS/mm, respectively. Ideal 
Class B operation requires complimentary devices are used 
to deliver the power instead of one. Each device conducts for 
alternate half cycles. To make good complementary pair, the  
gm of the PMOS must increase to those of the NMOS.

AMP with no input and output matching circuits. 
 
Figure 11. The PAE versus the average output power of the prototype SEPP 
AMP with no input and output matching circuits. 
Since the ratio of the gm of the NMOS and the PMOS is 
approximately 2: 1, the total gate width of the PMOS is set to 
twice width of the NMOS. Therefore, the total gate width of 
NMOS and PMOS is set to 900 μm and 1800 μm, respectively. 
In the S21 of S parameters, “Simulation-Sparam” is used. In 
the PAE uses the “P_Probe” of “ads_rflib”, subtracts the input 
power from the output power, divides the DC power and 
corrects it to a percentage. 
C. Simulation results 
Figure 10 shows the gain versus frequency characteristics of 
the prototype SEPP AMP. It exhibits power gain of 15dB 
over 100MHz to 1GHz. This flat gain performances are from 
no input and output matching circuits. 
Figure 11 shows the efficiency versus the average output 
power of the SEPP AMP. The maximum efficiency of 65% 
has been obtained.  Higher efficiency is expected if proper 
band-pass design of input and output matching circuits would 
be applied. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A new power saving technique for wireless terminals has 
been proposed. It is the combination of a polar modulation 
technique and CAZAC equalizing technique.
