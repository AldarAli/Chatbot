Abstract—In recent years, consumers have become empowered 
to share personal experiences regarding prescription drugs via 
Web page discussion groups. This paper describes our recent 
research involving automatically identifying adverse reactions 
from patient-provided drug reviews on health-related web 
sites. We focus on the statin class of cholesterol-lowering drugs. 
We extract a complete set of side effect expressions from 
patient-submitted drug reviews, and construct a hierarchical 
ontology of side effects. We use log-likely ratio estimation to 
detect biases in word distributions when comparing reviews of 
statin drugs with age-matched reviews of a broad spectrum of 
other drugs. We find a highly significant correlation between 
statins and a wide range of disorders and conditions, including 
diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), rhabdomyolysis, 
neuropathy, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, memory loss, and 
heart failure. A review of the research literature on statin side 
effects corroborates many of our findings.

 INTRODUCTION 
The last few decades have witnessed a steady increase in 
drug prescriptions for the treatment of biometric markers 
rather than overt physiological symptoms. Today, people 
regularly take multiple drugs in order to normalize serum 
levels of biomarkers such as cholesterol or glucose, or to 
reduce blood pressure. All drugs have side effects, which are 
sometimes debilitating or even life-threatening. When a 
person taking multiple drugs experiences a new symptom, it 
is not always clear which, if any, of the drugs or drug 
combinations are responsible.  
Increasingly, consumers are turning to the Web to seek 
information, and, increasingly, this information comes in the 
form of consumer-provided comments in discussion groups 
or chat rooms. User reviews of products and services have 
empowered consumers to obtain valuable data to guide their 
decision process. Recently, statistical and linguistic methods 
have been applied to large datasets of reviews to extract 
summary and/or rating information in various domains ([9] 
[22]).  
Health care and prescription drugs are a growing topic of 
discussion online, not surprising given that almost half of all 
Americans take prescription drugs each month, costing over 
$200 billion in 2008 alone ([5]). Though drugs are subject to 
clinical trials before reaching market, these trials are often 
too short, and may involve too few people to give conclusive 
results. A large study recently conducted on the heart failure 
drug, nesiritude, invalidated the findings of the smaller study 
that had led to the drug’s approval [11]. While regulatory 
agencies do attempt to monitor the safety of approved 
medical treatments, surveillance programs such as the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Adverse Event 
Reporting System (AERS) are often difficult for patients to 
use.  
In addition, the large language gap between medical 
documents and patient vocabulary can cause confusion and 
misunderstanding ([23]). We hope to take advantage of the 
vast amount of information available in patient anecdotes 
posted online to address the dual problems of insufficient 
clinical studies and mismatched terminology.  
We envision a system that increases patient awareness of 
drug-related side effects by enabling consumers of 
prescription drugs to easily browse a large consolidated 
database of posts from health-related web sites. Beyond 
aggregating data from drug review and health discussion 
sites, we plan to support spoken queries, which would be 
answered via a set of succinctly summarized hits that best 
match the query, based on sophisticated statistical and 
linguistic techniques. The user could then click on any one of 
these displayed summaries to read the associated post. 
This paper describes our preliminary efforts to detect 
associations between a drug class and its side effects. We use 
statistics and heuristic methods to build up a hierarchical 
ontology of side effects by aggregating patient-submitted 
drug reviews. We use log-likelihood ratios to extract 
summary information derived from biases in word and 
phrase distributions, and to quantify associations between 
drugs and symptoms. For the scope of this paper, we focus 
on statin drugs, which are among the most costly and 
commonly prescribed drugs in the United States. The 
methods described are applicable to all drug classes. 
In the remainder of this paper, we will first review the 
research literature reflecting known or suspected side effects 
associated with statin drugs. After explaining our data 
collection and side-effect ontology construction, we describe 
our methodology and verify that many of our extracted 
associations align with observations from the literature.

inhibitors) have become increasingly popular as very

effective agents to normalize serum cholesterol levels. The 
most popular of these, atorvastatin, marketed under the trade 
name, Lipitor, has been the highest revenue branded 
pharmaceutical for the past 6 years. The official Lipitor web 
site lists as potential side effects mainly muscle pain and 
weakness and digestive problems. However, several 
practitioners and researchers have identified suspected side 
effects in other more alarming areas, such as heart failure, 
cognition and memory problems, and even severe 
neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and ALS 
(Lou Gehrig’s disease). [21] provides compelling arguments 
for the diverse side effects of statins, attributing them mainly 
to cholesterol depletion in cell membranes. 
It is widely acknowledged that statin drugs cause muscle 
pain, weakness and damage ([7] [12]), likely due in part to 
their interference with the synthesis of the potent antioxidant 
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) ([10]). CoQ10 plays an essential 
role in mitochondrial function to produce energy. Congestive 
heart failure is a condition in which the heart can no longer 
pump enough blood to the rest of the body, essentially 
because it is too weak. Because the heart is a muscle, it is 
plausible that heart muscle weakness could arise from long-
term statin usage. Indeed, atorvastatin has been shown to 
impair ventricular diastolic heart performance ([14]). 
Furthermore, CoQ10 supplementation has been shown to 
improve cardiac function ([13] [20]). 
The research literature provides plausible biological 
explanations for a possible association between statin drugs 
and neuropathy ([15] [24]). A recent evidence-based article 
([1]) found that statin drug users had a high incidence of 
neurological disorders, especially neuropathy, parasthesia 
and neuralgia, and appeared to be at higher risk to the 
debilitating neurological diseases, ALS and Parkinson’s 
disease. The evidence was based on careful manual labeling 
of a set of self-reported accounts from 351 patients. A 
mechanism for such damage could involve interference with 
the ability of oligodendrocytes, specialized glial cells in the 
nervous system, to supply sufficient cholesterol to the myelin 
sheath surrounding nerve axons. Genetically-engineered 
mice with defective oligodendrocytes exhibit visible 
pathologies in the myelin sheath which manifest as muscle 
twitches and tremors ([16]). 
Cholesterol depletion in the brain would be expected to 
lead to pathologies in neuron signal transport, due not only to 
defective myelin sheath but also to interference with signal 
transport across synapses ([17]). Cognitive impairment, 
memory loss, mental confusion, and depression were 
significantly present in Cable’s patient population ([1]). 
Wagstaff et al. ([19]) conducted a survey of cognitive 
dysfunction from AERS data, and found evidence of both 
short-term memory loss and amnesia associated with statin 
usage. Golomb et al. ([6]) conducted a study to evaluate 
evidence of statin-induced cognitive, mood or behavioral 
changes in patients. She concluded with a plea for studies 
that “more clearly establish the impact of hydrophilic and 
lipophilic statins on cognition, aggression, and serotonin.”  
B. Relationship between Cholesterol and Health 
ALS and heart failure are both conditions for which 
published literature suggests an increased risk associated 
with statin therapy ([1] [10]). Indeed, for both of these 
conditions, a survival benefit is associated with elevated 
cholesterol levels. A statistically significant inverse 
correlation was found in a study on mortality in heart failure. 
For 181 patients with heart disease and heart failure, half of 
those whose serum cholesterol was below 200 mg/dl were 
dead three years after diagnosis, whereas only 28% of the 
patients whose serum cholesterol was above 200 mg/dl had 
died. In another study on a group of 488 patients diagnosed 
with ALS, serum levels of triglycerides and fasting 
cholesterol were measured at the time of diagnosis 
([2]). High values for both lipids were associated with 
improved survival, with a p-value <0.05. 
A very recent study on the relationship between various 
measures of cholesterol status and health in the elderly came 
up with some surprising results, strongly suggesting that 
elevated cholesterol is beneficial for this segment of the 
population [18]. A study population initially over 75 years 
old was followed over a 17 year period beginning in 1990. In 
addition to serum cholesterol, a biometric associated with the 
ability to synthesize cholesterol (lathosterol) and a biometric 
associated with the ability to absorb cholesterol through the 
gut (sitosterol) were measured. For all three measures of 
cholesterol, low values were associated with a poorer 
prognosis for frailty, mental decline and early death. A 
reduced ability to synthesize cholesterol showed the 
strongest correlation with poor outcome. Individuals with 
high measures of all three biometrics enjoyed a 4.3 year 
extension in life span, compared to those for whom all 
measures were low.

SIDE-EFFECT DISCOVERY 
A. Data Collection 
To learn the underlying associations between side effects 
and drug usage from patient-provided reviews, we collected 
drug 
reviews 
from 
three 
drug 
discussion 
forums 
(“AskAPatient.com,” 
“Medications.com” 
and 
“WebMD.com”) which allow users to post reviews on 
specific drugs and share their experiences. Table 1 gives the 
statistics on the review data collection. A total of 8,515 
statin reviews were collected from the three data sources. 
We also collected 105K drug reviews 
from the 
AskAPatient.com, on drugs to treat a broad range of 
problems such as depression, acid reflux disease, high blood 
pressure, diabetes, etc. This set includes reviews for non-
statin cholesterol lowering drugs.

A typical review entry contains the personal information 
of the user (e.g., gender, age), the dosage and duration of the 
drug treatment, the reason for taking the drug, the side 
effects that the user has experienced, as well as a free-style 
text comment. An example of a review is shown in Figure 1. 
 
   :drug “Lipitor” 
   :dosage "40mg 1X D" 
   :sex "Male" 
   :age "47" 
   :duration "4 years" 
   :reason "high cholesterol" 
   :side_effects "Body aches, joint pain, decreased mobility, 
decreased testosterone and libido, difficulty getting out of bed 
in the morning, tingling and itchy hands, and decrease in 
overall strength." 
  :comment "I have been taking lipitor for many years. I started 
out on 10mgs and now I am on 40mgs. I have had hip 
replacement, back surgery, and shoulder surgery while on this 
drug. I have seen my strength decrease dramatically …”

B. Side-Effect Extraction 
Most previous medical natural language processing 
research relies on medical lexicons such as those provided 
by Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) or the Food 
and Drug Administration’s (FDA) COSTART corpus. 
However, these official lexicons often have low coverage of 
colloquial side effect expressions, which are very common 
in patient-submitted reviews. Thus, in this study we extract 
side effect expressions from the reviews themselves, instead 
of using these restrictive lexicons.  
As shown in the example in Figure 1, the input of “side 
effects” often contains a list of short phrases describing the 
major side effects the reviewer has, and the input of 
“comment” contains free-style texts which tell the story 
about the reviewer’s experience with the drug. To obtain a 
clean set of side effect expressions, we first automatically 
extract short phrases from the input of “side_effects” in each 
review entry. From the 107K reviews collected from 
AskAPatient.com (including both statin and non-statin 
drugs), we extracted 7,500 words and phrases that describe 
common side effects on various drugs.  
These phrases extracted from general users’ input 
contain a lot of noise. For example, some users may type in 
long sentences describing their conditions instead of using 
short phrases. Also, many phrases may describe the same 
type of side effect (e.g., “joint pain,” “pain in joint” and 
“severe pain in the arm and leg joint”). To eliminate the 
noise and redundancy, the extracted phrases were first 
subjected to a stop-word filter, eliminating 377 common 
stop words. A phrase which contains only stop words is 
filtered out as noise. We also filter out the phrases which 
have frequency counts less than five in the whole review 
dataset. We further filter the phrases by grouping phrases 
containing the same set of non-stop-word (e.g., “joint pain” 
and “pain in joint”). With this filtering process, the number 
of candidate side effect phrases shrinks to 2,314.  
C. Side-Effect Onology 
To organize the set of side effect phrases, we asked an 
annotator who is knowledgeable in medical terminology to 
classify the phrases into a hierarchical ontology. First, 
synonyms are identified and grouped (as shown in Table 2). 
For example, “elevated blood pressure,” “increase in blood 
pressure” and “higher blood pressure” are clustered into the 
same group. Then, these synonym groups are further 
organized into broad classes. For example, the synonym 
groups of “achy legs,” “muscle pain” and “joint pain” are all 
clustered into the generic class of “pain.”  
Table 2. Examples of the synonyms of side effects. 
Group 
Synonyms 
loss of mental 
clarity 
mental slowness, slow brain, fuzzy thinking, 
foggy head, cloudy head, muddled thinking 
all body aches achy body, achy feeling, achy bones, achy all 
over, overall aches, body ache, aches and pains  
forgetting 
words 
difficulty finding the right word, mixing up 
words, can’t find words, difficulty finding words 
diabetes 
diabetic, high blood sugar, elevated blood sugar 
As a result of this manual process, the 2,314 side effect 
phrases are clustered into 307 synonym groups, which are 
furthered grouped into 30 classes. Table 3 shows the 30 
classes as well as the number of synonym groups in each 
class, and Table 4 gives examples of the synonym groups in 
some classes. Note that this classification schema 
encompasses side effects for all drugs, and thus can be used 
for other drug classes besides statins.

D. Association of Drug Class with Side-Effects  
Given the hierarchical ontology of side effects, we can 
now discover which side effects are strongly associated with 
statin drugs. For this, we make use of log-likelihood ratio 
([3]). In statistics, a likelihood ratio test is used to compare 
the fit of two models, one of which (the null model) is a 
special case of the other (the alternative model). The test is 
based on the likelihood ratio, which expresses how many 
times more likely the data are under one model than the 
other. This likelihood ratio, or equivalently its logarithm, 
can then be used to compute a p-value to decide whether to 
reject the null model in favor of the alternative model.  
To apply the log likelihood ratio algorithm, we treat the 
side effect association problem as a coin toss model. The set 
of reviews on statin drugs () is analogous to a coin A. The 
set of reviews on non-statin drugs () is analogous to a 
coin B. Each review (in  or ) is a coin toss instance. For 
a certain side effect phrase , if a review contains the phrase, 
the “Head” of the coin shows up; otherwise, the “Tail” 
shows up. Thus, the null hypothesis is that coin A and coin 
B have the same probability of showing “Head” or “Tail,” 
i.e., the review set  and  have the same probability of 
containing the phrase. The alternative model is that coin A 
and coin B have different probabilities of showing up “Head” 
or “Tail,” i.e., one review set (  or  ) has a higher 
probability of containing the phrase than the other. The 
measurement of the hypothesis that the phrase  is more 
likely to occur in the set of statin reviews () is calculated 
by: 
 
 = 	

 +  − 	

                (1) 
 
where  is the counts of statin reviews that contain the side 
effect phrase ,  is the counts of non-statin reviews that 
contain the phrase ,  is the probability of the phrase  
occuring in ,  is the probability of the phrase  occuring 
in ,  is the probability of the phrase  occurring in the 
whole document set ( ∪ ),  is the size of , and  
is the size of . 
Maximum likelihood is achieved by: 
 
 =

          =

                           (2) 
 
 =

                                     (3) 
 
A symmetric equation of (1) can be derived for , the 
hypothesis that the phrase  occurs more frequently in . 
Whether the alternative model fits significantly better and 
should thus be preferred can be determined by deriving the 
probability or p-value of the obtained difference  −
 . The probability distribution of the difference can be 
approximated by a chi-square distribution. P-values are 
computed under the assumption that there is one degree of 
freedom between the null model and the alternative model.  
IV. 
EXPERIMENTS 
In our dataset of reviews, the size of non-statin reviews 
(105K) is much larger than that of statin reviews (8,515). To 
make the two document sets equivalent for comparison, we 
randomly select the same size of reviews (8,515) from the 
non-statin reviews as . An important consideration is to 
correct for a possible age bias of review-providers in the data 
selection process. Figure 2 gives the age distribution of statin 
drug reviewers. We observed that, in the statin review set, 
most of the reviews (83.6%) are published by users aged 
from 40 to 70. To avoid the possible bias on symptoms of 
different ages, we follow the same distribution of reviewers’ 
age for the random selection of non-statin reviews.  
 
 
Figure 2. Distribution of reviewers’ age in statin reviews. 
For each side effect in our hierarchy ontology, we 
calculate the log likelihood ratio of the statin review set and 
non-statin review set as explained in the algorithm section. 
We treat all the synonyms for each side-effect equally, i.e., 
the occurrences of alternatives in the same group count for 
the same phrase .  
Table 5 lists all side effect clusters related to pain that 
yielded a p-value less than 0.05. Pain in essentially all parts 
of the body -- arms, legs, neck, shoulder, and back, all 
occurred more frequently in the statin reviews by a 
substantial margin. 
“Muscle 
pain” in particular is 
overwhelmingly associated with statins, with a p-value of 
1.4E-06.

rare, it did not occur at all in the non-statin reviews, but 
appeared 31 times in the statin reviews. “Loss of muscle 
mass” is ten times as frequent in the statin reviews. “Muscle 
cramps,” “general weakness” and “muscle weakness,” highly 
associated with “frailty,” have extremely low p-values. In 
addition, “general numbness” and “muscle spasms” are also 
significantly associated with statins.

Table 7 shows the frequency distributions for several 
often debilitating conditions associated with pathologies in 
the brain and nervous system. Most alarming to us is the 
10:1 ratio of incidence of ALS, a debilitating disease 
associated with damaged motor neurons in the spinal cord 
that is nearly always fatal. The associated p-value of 0.008 
makes this result highly significant. The ratio is even higher 
for Parkinson's disease (18:1). Parkinson's disease involves 
damage to dopamine-secreting cells in the substantia nigra. 
The p-value for memory problems is also very low (0.01), 
providing powerful evidence that statins cause memory 
problems. An extreme form of memory problems, dementia, 
comes in with a p-value just above the significance cutoff at 
0.056. Neuropathy, due to nerve damage in the peripheral 
nervous system, is generally associated with muscle 
weakness, cramps, and spasms, other side effects that occur 
very frequently in statin drug reviews.

Table 8 shows other major health issues for which the 
word frequencies are highly skewed towards the statin 
reviews. Most of these distributions are highly significant, 
with a p-value < 0.01. Diabetes is especially striking, with 
three times the frequency of occurrence in the statin reviews 
as in the other reviews, despite the fact that diabetes 
medications are included in the other class. The highly 
significant results for diabetes are in line with recent concern 
about the possibility that statins may increase risk to diabetes 
([4] [8]). 
 “Heart attack” has an extremely low p-value, but in this 
case strong compounding from a precondition is undeniable. 
A similar issue arises with “stroke.” The strongest 
correlation among the remaining conditions is found for liver 
damage (p<0.003), a potential side effect that is 
acknowledged by the statin manufacturers. It is interesting 
that arthritis associates strongly with statins, as arthritis has 
not been identified as a known side effect. Also, “heart 
failure” and “raised liver enzymes” are under the cutoff of 
0.05, and “kidney failure” is six times as frequent in the 
statin reviews, with a p-value slightly above 0.05.

To learn the high level association between side effects 
and statin drugs, we further aggregate the side effects into 
classes, and calculate the log likelihood ratio as well as the p-
values for each class. Table 9 gives the top-ranked classes 
with p-values below 0.05 for statin reviews. These categories 
are considered as most strongly associated with statin drugs. 
In particular, “muscle problems” is overwhelmingly 
associated with statins, with a p-value of 2.0E-07.

DISCUSSION 
In this paper, we have described our vision of a Web-
based database providing potential users with a rich facility 
for exploring the association of prescription drugs with 
possible side effects. We used the basic strategy of 
comparing word frequency distributions between two 
databases as a means to uncover statistically salient phrase 
patterns. Our efforts focused on statin drugs, as these are a 
widely prescribed medication with diverse side effects. 
Through standard statistical log likelihood ratio estimation, 
we have shown that statin drugs are very strongly associated 
with muscle pain and weakness, and that there is as well a 
statistically significant association between statin drugs and 
several debilitating diseases, such as ALS, Parkinson’s 
disease, rhabdomyolysis, and heart failure. Many of our 
findings are supported by the research literature on statins. 
Our research was inspired by the study conducted by Jeff 
Cable ([1]). While he looked at only 350 reviews, he used 
careful manual analysis to deduce associated side effects. We

looked at a much larger set of reviews (over 8,000), and used 
statistical techniques for analysis. On the one hand, it is 
gratifying that both methods uncovered similar side-effect 
profiles on different data. On the other hand, it is disturbing 
that a drug class as widely prescribed as the statin drugs has 
such severe and sometimes life-threatening adverse 
reactions.  
One limitation of the method is the compounding effects 
of preconditions. This clearly influences the bias for statins 
with regard to “heart attack” and “stoke,” but may also 
contribute to other terms such as diabetes and heart failure. 
In addition, users occasionally post comments that discuss 
potential side effects that they did not personally experience. 
VI. 
FUTURE WORK 
In the future, we will focus on incorporating the results of 
our statistical analyses into the user database. We will also 
develop techniques to summarize individual reviews and 
provide associated index terms. An ambitious goal is to use 
parsing techniques to extract a story line that captures cause-
and-effect relationships. For instance, by commenting, “It’s 
only been 2 days without the medication and cramping is 
improving,” a user clearly implied that the drug had caused 
the cramping. We also plan to expand the database to other 
drug classes, such as psychopharmaceuticals and acid reflux 
therapies. Finally, we would like to provide a speech-based 
interface for querying the database.
