Abstract—In this paper, we put forward an improved scheme 
based on deferred NAK (Negative Acknowledgement) mode in 
CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) file 
delivery protocol, to make a trade-off between the file delivery 
time and the throughput. We employ K  retransmissions on 
the missing packets to decrease the packet error probability 
and lower file delivery time. We define a ratio

 INTRODUCTION 
Over the recent years, Consultative Committee for Space 
Data Systems (CCSDS) has standardized a set of 
communication 
protocols 
based 
on 
state-of-the-art 
techniques. Indeed, since the needs of different missions, a 
single type of standard would not satisfy all scenarios and 
possible selections will be offered to users [1].  
Currently there are two kinds of reliability mechanisms 
for various mission scenarios, respectively based on 
retransmission and redundancy schemes. The ultimate 
frontier for ensuring reliable data transfer is represented by 
the joint application of ARQ and erasure codes, so as to 
provide 
a 
two-level 
protection 
in 
deep 
space 
communication[1]. Coding solutions applying the concept of 
digital fountain, such as LT, Tornado, and Raptor codes, yet 
deserve great attention and were initially considered within 
the CCSDS standardization process. Despite the virtues they 
may offer in terms of rateless coding, they still require the 
availability of a feedback channel for signaling the 
completion of the decoding procedure to the sender, which 
otherwise would continuously transmit new redundancy 
symbols, wasting power and link bandwidth[2]. 
As one type of reliability mechanisms based on 
retransmission, the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) 
offers end-to-end transport services for the file transfer 
to/from onboard mass memories. It is designed to get 
reliable transfer of files by following an FTP-like paradigm. 
Its implementation spans the application and transport layers. 
It consists of two operative procedures: core and extended. 
CFDP adopts an ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) 
mechanism, while uses NAK (Negative Acknowledgement) 
to replace ACK (Acknowledgement). Considering the 
features of links and transmission requirements, CFDP 
offers four selectable modes: deferred, immediate, prompted 
and asynchronous [3]. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II presents the related work. Section III describes 
and analyzes K-retransmission-based deferred NAK scheme. 
Section IV defines a  reasonable ratio to validate and 
evaluate our scheme, and determines the proper K value. 
Section V makes a comparison between standard deferred 
NAK and our scheme based on 
K  2
. Finally, conclusions 
are drawn. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Some work have been done to analyze the performance 
of CFDP. W. Baek and D. C. Lee evaluate the expected file 
delivery time in deferred and immediate NAK modes [4][5]. 
All parameter values are set under the constraint that the 
throughput is never compromised. T. de Cola proposes 
Repeated Transmission (RT) mechanism to extend the 
CFDP features, transmitting the same CFDP PDU for K  
times consecutively [6]. The relationships between packet 
loss rate, packet size, throughput and the number of 
transmissions are merely discussed under the cislunar  
scenario，whereas the file delivery time is not mentioned. G. 
Papastergiou and I. Psaras advance the Deep-Space 
Transport Protocol (DS-TP), which transmits each packet 
twice importing some delay between the original 
transmission and the retransmission. Although DS-TP can 
obtain two times faster than conventional protocols in terms 
of file delivery time, it induces high overhead [7].  
From the above work, we find that the same PDU 
allowed to be delivered either two or K times consecutively 
during the whole period of file transfer. As a result, 
extraordinary power will be consumed in the context of 
multiple repeated transmissions. How to measure the 
compromise between the file delivery time, extraordinary 
power and throughput of CFDP, is an open issue. The 
purpose of this paper is to bring forward an improved 
scheme to standard deferred NAK CFDP, in which we use a 
K-retransmission-based strategy to make a trade-off between 
the file delivery time and the throughput. We measure the

proposed scheme under several typical scenarios, such as 
GEO, Earth to Moon and Earth to Mars.   
III. 
K-RETRANSMISSION-BASED SCHEME  OF CFDP 
In CFDP, file-transfer is called a “transaction”. Each file 
is segmented into PDUs of variable length before 
transmission. For the first transmission attempt, a meta-data 
PDU is sent at the beginning, followed by the file data 
PDUs sent out in sequence with an end-of-file (EOF) PDU, 
which marks the end of the first transmission attempt and 
signals the receiver to respond. If missing or error-corrupted 
PDUs were detected, a NAK message is issued back to the 
sender, with a list of PDUs that need to be retransmitted. 
Upon reception of the NAK, the sender will retransmit the 
requested PDUs until all missing PDUs have been correctly 
received. If all PDUs are successfully received, the receiver 
will send a Finished (FIN) message to the sender, signaling 
the completion of the transaction. As a widely used mode, 
in this paper we regard deferred NAK CFDP as an 
improved object. We consider the transport layer channel of 
CFDP to be an erasure channel and make some assumptions 
as follows, details refer to [4][5]:  
 
Link is full-duplex and power budget is fixed. 
 
Processing delay of  PDU is neglected. 
 
The meta-data PDU and all file data PDUs have an 
identical length.  
 
Each EOF is transmitted successfully at a time. 
Notations we use in this paper are specified in Table I.

A. Scheme Description  
As depicted in Fig. 1, we chronologically divide the total 
file delivery time into two stages: first sending stage and 
retransmission stage. The first sending stage starts at the 
sender’s transmission of meta-data initiating the transaction 
and ends after EOF reception at the receiver entity. The 
retransmission stage begins at the transmission immediately 
following ACK (EOF) transmission and finishes at the 
instant when all missing PDUs have been correctly received. 
Note that our definition of file delivery time does not include 
the time for FIN-ACK(FIN) procedure. Let us have a quick 
overview of K-retransmission-based deferred NAK scheme. 
The algorithm is described as follows: 
 
Figure 1.  Delay time diagram of K-retransmission-based deferred NAK. 
Step I: In first sending stage, sender entity transmits a 
meta-PDU and all file data PDUs in sequence to receiver 
entity, after finishing sending all the data PDUs, the sender 
entity sends a EOF PDU to the receiver entity, then waits 
ACK(EOF) and NAK. Upon receiving the ACK(EOF) and 
NAK, if there is no missing PDU, the transaction is closed, 
details refer to [3][4], otherwise goes to Step II.  
Step  II: In retransmission stage, upon receiving a NAK, 
the sender entity immediately retransmits each missing PDU 
K times consecutively. If missing PDUs still remain, the 
receiver entity issues another NAK. This process repeats 
until the receiver entity receives all necessary PDUs 
successfully, then the transaction is closed. 
Here, K is a meaningful parameter, which is counted by 
a counter at the sender entity and influences the overall 
performance and helps increase the probability of data 
delivery at cost of power waste (proportional with K ). 
B. Theoretical Analysis 
Before the theoretical analysis of K-retransmission-based 
deferred NAK, we address the setting rules on EOF timer 
and NAK timer. Considering CFDP over a direct hop-to-hop 
link, 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
unnecessary 
duplicate 
retransmission, the time-out value of the EOF timer should 
be         . The time-out value of the NAK timer set upon 
issuance of the NAK that causes the
 retransmission spurt 
in the retransmission stage, should be  
    
  , where 
k denotes the transmission time of the PDUs requested by 
the receiver for the 
 retransmission spurt in the 
retransmission 
stage 
[4]. 
From 
the 
aforementioned 
assumptions, the EOF delivery time can be  
     because it 
is transmitted successfully at a time.

is equal or larger

In general, we have a better understanding of K-
retransmission-based deferred NAK mode. We will validate 
the K-retransmission-based scheme in Section IV, and 
determine the proper K value. 
IV. 
SIMULATION AND DISCUSSION 
This section includes both analytical and experimental 
evaluations of our scheme. To that purpose, we define a 
ratio expressed in terms of the decrement of file delivery 
time by one extra retransmitted PDU to validate the 
performance of K-retransmission-based scheme, and the 
proper K is determined. 
A. Validation  
Under the aforementioned analysis, we have constructed 
our simulation scenarios. We consider a single link file- 
transfer operation. The typical configurations of parameters 
are listed in Table II.  
We denote 
the time spent in K-retransmission-based 
retransmission 
stage 
(with 
is 
corresponding 
to 
retransmission time needed in standard deferred NAK 
CFDP), and 
the number of PDU requested in K-
retransmission-based retransmission stage (with 
is 
corresponding to retransmission number of PDU needed in 
standard deferred NAK CFDP).

We then define a ratio as follows:

where
K  2
, refers to the decrement of file delivery 
time by one extra retransmitted PDU transmitted in the K-
retransmission-based stage, relative to the standard deferred 
AK CFDP. We utilize this ratio to evaluate the 
performance of our scheme. Here we only consider the ratio 
of the Earth to Mars scenario to see general. The tests are 
performed in order to show how the performance changes 
with different packet error probability ranging from 0.01 to 
0.5 and retransmission times 
N
K from 2 to 10. Combining 
(2), (3), (5) and (7), we plot a figure, as shown in Fig. 2, by 
using MATLAB tool.  
It is straightforward that increasing the times of 
retransmissions, the values of ratio 
 decrease. We 
observe that the values of 
)1

( 
 under different PER are 
all superior to the other cases. If the number of 
transmissions is further increased, from 3 to 10, when PER 
ranging from 0.1 to 0.5, the curves will tend to be flat. As 
highlighted in the previous case, best results are provided, 
when K is equal to 2, with maximum decrement of file 
delivery time at the cost of same number of PDUs. More 
precisely, the contribution to lower the file delivery at the 
cost of power is maximal in the case of 
K  2
. The peak 
values under different K and PER appear in the vicinity 
of       
  , the reason causing this phenomena will be a 
contribution in future work.  
 
      
On the basis of above mentioned, we choose the proper 
K equal to 2, and name this scheme as Double 
Retransmission (DR) deferred NAK. We make some 
simulations in Section IV.B for a supplementary validation.

B. Simulation and Analysis 
From the above Fig. 2, it is clear that increasing the K , 
the decrement becomes smaller and smaller. Thus, we 
confine the maximum K down to 5, and the packet error 
probability in the range of 0.1 to 0.5, to make a 
supplementary validation under three typical scenarios 
which have been listed in Table II.

.Moreover, the maximum values emerge when the 
packet lost rate is higher, especially in “deep-fading period”. 
For scenario A, we note that the values of ratio are negative 
in Fig. 3(a). This is easily explained by the fact that the 
retransmission time is ruled by the number of retransmitted 
PDUs, in the case of one way propagation time is small. As

are both the maximum. The longer distance from the earth 
to destination and the higher PER, the larger decrement of 
file delivery time can be realized, which can be informed by 
comparing the scenarios B and C. These are also in line 
with the previous results shown in Section IV. A.

File size = 1MB, transmission rate = 20kb/s, and one way propagation 
delay = 2.5 a.u.  
B. Deferred NAK vs DR Deferred NAK 
Under the simulation parameters presented in Table II, 
we implement several experiments to compare DR deferred 
NAK with standard deferred NAK. We only consider the 
formula (6) in this paper and the formula (7) in [4] (in 
Section III. C ). The comparisons between them under three 
typical scenarios are shown in Fig 5. From Fig 5, we notice 
that the file delivery time ascends with the increase of packet 
loss rate. Although the DR deferred NAK does not fit the 
GEO scenario, it quite suits the latter two scenarios, 
especially when the packet loss rate is larger than 0.1. As 
discussed in [3] (in Section II. C, proposition 1), the 
 
increases in logarithmic order with N . The expected file 
delivery time in (8) has a term that increased with 
 and a 
term that has the factor 
. For very long propagation 
delay, the product of multiplicative factor 
 and one 
way propagation time is much larger than that of the term 
linear of 
, which is on the order of the PDU transmission 
time. In such an environment, as the number of PDUs in the 
file increases, the expected file delivery time is initially 
ruled by the term logarithmically growing with 
, and the 
order of growth later becomes linear with a small 
multiplicative factor for larger values of N . Given as 
is 
fixed, the expected file delivery time is absolutely 
dominated by the multiplicative factor and long one way 
propagation delay. For a small one way propagation delay 
(relatively to the PDU transmission time), the order of 
growth is always ruled by the term linear of 
. Generally, 
the DR deferred NAK is especially suited to scenarios with 
very long propagation delay, or high packet error rate, or 
both in deep space communication.

CONCLUSION  AND  FUTURE WORK 
Future space communication needs simple, effective and 
reliable protocols. A single type of protocol would not meet 
the needs of all scenarios in future Delay-Tolerant Network 
(DTN). We have reconsidered the deferred NAK CFDP and  
integration of the retransmission concept. We have put 
forward an improved scheme utilizing double retransmission

mechanism to standard deferred NAK CFDP. The protocol 
make an efficient trade-off between the file-delivery time 
and the throughput efficiency under several typical scenarios. 
Our theoretical evaluation and preliminary simulation results 
reveal that DR deferred NAK outperforms standard deferred 
NAK mode in terms of file delivery time. This improved 
scheme favors the scenarios with small connectivity time, 
long propagation delay and high PER greatly. 
Future work will emphasize on the joint use of our 
scheme with erasure coding particularly. A deeper analysis 
of channel model combined with rain attenuation will also 
be tackled in our future work.
