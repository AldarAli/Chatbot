Abstract— Water turbidity measurement is important for 
underwater environmental monitoring. Large changes in this 
parameter can affect fishes catching the food. This avoids 
having fishes feed properly and most pellets are wasted and 
deposited in the seabed. In some cases, it is more important to 
know the variation of the turbidity in real time than a very 
accurate value. For this reason, we may not need very high 
precision in our sensor. In this paper, we show the 
development of a low cost turbidity sensor. Our sensor is able 
to take measurements in real-time and presents long useful 
lifetime. Consequently, it will need low maintenance. To test 
our system, we are going to create a set of samples with 
different concentrations in sea water. We will calibrate our 
system and we will estimate the analytical model that follows 
the behavior of our low cost turbidity sensor.  
Keywords-Turbidity; turbidity optical sensors; low cost 
sensor. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, it is important to have wide knowledge in 
underwater parameters because large changes can be 
important in some areas such as aquaculture, pollution 
monitoring, sewage treatment or oceanography.  
The Water Framework Directive [1] proposes to measure 
some 
physicochemical 
parameters 
like 
temperature, 
dissolved oxygen or salinity, among others, to evaluate the 
quality of all water bodies (including marine water till one 
nautical mile from the coast). 
In last years, the most common methods to analyze the 
water and to define these variables were sampling in-situ and 
the subsequent analysis at laboratories. The use of sensors to 
perform this kind of measurements is becoming increasingly 
common because these methods can reduce the analysis cost 
of the physicochemical parameters. The use of sensor nodes 
can be a way to eliminate the manual process of sampling 
because the measurements are performed automatically in 
the environment (river, lake, fish farm, etc.) by the sensor 
nodes. The use of sensors reduces costs avoiding going to the 
field for taking samples. When measurements and analysis 
are performed directly in the medium by using sensors, the 
sampling process is enhanced and we are sure that the 
number of samples is representative. 
The lifetime of a physical sensor is longer than a 
chemical sensor. The chemical methods used at laboratories 
use reagents consumed during the analyses. Physical sensors 
also let us measure in real time. If we use several sensors 
forming a network along a river, it is possible to have 
measures along any type of environment such as a river bed 
or in the surrounding area of a marine fish farm. For these 
reasons, the use of sensor networks is growing day by day 
and now, it is easy to find many examples [2]. 
The turbidity is defined as the decrease of transparency 
of a water solution caused by the presence of dissolved or 
suspended particles. The size of particles is also important 
although sizes lower than 0.45µm do not affect to this 
parameter. These particles reflect, scatter and attenuate the 
light [3]. Turbidity measurements are important for 
environmental monitoring and management. In some cases, 
the sampling process is complicated and it may alter the 
environmental conditions. The alteration of a sample can 
make it not being a representative sample, so it should not be 
taken into account. Turbidity is expressed in Nephelometric 
Turbidity Units (NTU). 
Turbidity values can vary by changes in the composition 
of the solids and some dissolved substances in water. In the 
seas, oceans and rivers those substances can have different 
origins and different effects. On one hand, the solids can 
come from the erosion of the emerged zones which provide 
nutrients to the water. On the other hand, the solids can come 
from different industrial effluents and in this case they can be 
dangerous for the environment. The suspended solids can 
also have a biological origin. They can be different type of 
microorganisms like phytoplankton, zooplankton or organic 
particles matter. Consequently, turbidity can indicate a wide 
range of situations (pollution, eutrophication or the increase 
of solids in the water mass). The sediments in suspension can 
cause several environmental damages such as benthic 
smothering, irritation of fish gills and the transport of 
absorbed contaminants. These sediments also produce an 
attenuation of the light penetration and this affects to the 
photosynthesis process [4]. The light dispersion can be used 
to measure the turbidity at specific wavelength and at 
specific angle, usually 90º [3]. 
In this paper, we propose the design of a low cost 
turbidity sensor. In addition, we have performed a set of 
measurements in sea water for several turbidity levels. 
Finally, we have performed a verification process to ensure 
that our system is working correctly.  
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 
shows a review of the main methods which are used to 
measure the turbidity. Our low cost turbidity sensor is 
presented in Section 3. Section 4 explains the processes 
carried out to measure and calibrate our system. Finally, 
Section 5 shows our conclusion, compares the prize of our 
proposal with existing proposals and presents our future 
work.

RELATED WORK 
Turbidity can be directly and quantitatively measured 
using several methods. In this Section, we are going to 
present the main ones.  
A. Secchi disc and variations 
Steel and Neuhausser [5] performed a study in Skagit 
River (Western of Washington State) where the turbidity was 
measured with 3 discs: horizontal black disc, horizontal 
Secchi disc and vertical Secchi disc. They also measured the 
clarity of the river with a nephelometer. Finally, they 
compared the results obtained by the nephelometer and the 
distances of the disc. These results are shown in Table I. 
Larson et al. [6] addressed  the possibility of reducing 
sources of error in measuring lake water clarity using a 
Secchi 
disk 
by 
investigating 
the 
use 
of 
beam 
transmissometer readings for estimating Secchi disk clarity. 
To do this, the authors investigated how Secchi disk works 
and performed the measurements in the Crater Lake in Crater 
Lake National Park, Oregon, USA. From their results, they 
extracted a prediction model to determine the water turbidity. 
The results demonstrated that this prediction model reliably 
estimated Secchi disk depths and could be used to 
significantly expand optical observations in an environment 
where the conditions for standardized Secchi disk 
deployments are limited. 
B. Optical sensors 
An optical turbidimeter bases the turbidity measure on 
the light detection at different angles. The name of the 
instruments changes according to the angle used to perform 
the measurements. If the angle is 90º, it is called 
nephelometer. If the angle is 0º, it is called absorbimeters. 
Because the turbidity is a value which depends on the 
quantity of suspended solids in water, the solids intercept the 
line of light causing scattering and absorption, so not all light 
arrives to the detector [7]. 
When the turbidity is low, the light scattered away from 
its original direction is lower. This is one of the most 
important problems when we try to measure low turbidity 
levels with a turbidimeter. To improve these measures, A. F. 
B. Omar and M. Z. B. MatJafri proposed the use of light 
detector in different angles, from 90 to 180º. This is called 
backscattering [7]. Other problems that optical sensors can 
have are the fouling, the high variability of the size and the 
reflectivity of particles [8]. 
Laser sensors are being investigated as an alternative 
method to the nephelometers. T. S. Melis et al. [9] developed 
a study of turbidity in Colorado River. They used Laser In-
Situ Scattering and Transmissometry to measure the sand 
and thinner material. They measured the sensor output 
voltage in mV and the concentration of the sediments in 
mg/l. Their results showed the correlation in (1): 
                              
  
                  (1) 
The interval of sediments concentration measured was 
from 10mg/l to 160 mg/L, and the recorded voltages were 
from 10 mV to 150 mV. Their results show that LISST-100-
B is suitable for providing data of suspended solids of the 
Colorado’s River, The measurement results presented a high 
confidence bound. It was around 95%. 
Gray et al. in 2003 [10] took continuous in-situ turbidity 
measurements with the purpose of estimating the sediment 
concentrations in the Kansas River. They found a correlation 
of R=0.93, and the formula that relates the suspended 
sediment concentration (SSC) with the water turbidity was 
(2): 
    
  
                                      (2) 
The range of values of their experience was between 
10mg/l to 4000mg/l and between 10 NTU to 4000 NTU.  
C. Acoustic sensors  
Other method to measure the turbidity is the use of an 
Acoustic Dolpper Velocimeter (ADV) with backscattering. 
Chanson et al. [11] performed an experiment where the 
correlation between acoustic backscatter intensity and the 
sediment concentration showed a monotonic increase instead 
of the linear relationship. It is similar than the one that we 
can see between turbidity and suspended sediments [11]. 
They prepared some experiences in the laboratory and other 
ones in the estuarine zone of Eprapah Creek with low 
sediments concentration (Eastern Australia). Their results 
showed that the quality of water and the composition of 
sediments affect to the calibration curves. For this reason, 
each sensor must be calibrated with the water and soil 
material of the study area. 
D. Other methods 
There are several papers where authors use satellite 
images (LANDSAT) to measure the turbidity in water bodies 
[12]. However, this methodology is not interesting for our 
purposes because we need a continuous measurement 
process. In addition, we want to have values in a short period 
of time. Satellite systems cannot provide us short temporal 
scale (every hour), enough spatial resolution (few meters) 
and low economic prices.

The pressure-differential principle can also be used to 
measure the turbidity. This method is promising to be used in 
highly concentrated stream flows [10]. But, we cannot use 
this method because our measures are performed in the sea 
where the concentration of sediments is usually low. 
III. 
LOW COST TURBIDITY SENSOR PROPOSAL 
In this section, we are going to present our low cost 
turbidity sensor. This section also shows its fabrication cost.  
A. Our proposal 
Our system is based on the use of an infrared LED as a 
source of emission and a photodiode as a receiver. Both 
elements are disposed at an angle of 180° and they are faced 
so that the photodiode can capture maximum infrared light 
from the LED. The infrared LED and the photodiode are 
placed at a distance of 4 cm. 
TSUS5400 is an infrared emitting diode using GaAs 
technology molded in a blue-gray tinted plastic package. 
This infrared diode has a peak wavelength of 950 nm and its 
angle of half intensity is 22°. 
S186P is a high speed and high sensitive photodiode in a 
plastic package. It is an IR filter, spectrally matched to GaAs 
or GaAs on GaAlAs IR emitters (≥ 900 nm). The large active 
area combined with a flat case gives a high sensitivity at a 
wide viewing angle. The angle of half sensitivity is ±65º. 
S186P is covered by a plastic case with IR filter (950 mm) 
and it is suitable for near infrared radiation. 
The transmitter circuit is powered by a voltage of 5V 
while the photodiode is supplied with a voltage of 15V. To 
achieve these values, we use two voltage regulators of 
LM78XX series, where XX is 05, for the transmitter circuit, 
and 15 for the receiver circuit. This type of regulatory 
permits a maximum output current of 1 A. 
In our system, the water turbidity is proportional to the 
potential difference registered in the resistor R3. To process 
the voltage values recorded in the receiver circuit a 
microcontroller is used. This element is responsible for 
taking the data and performs the necessary calculations to 
estimate the turbidity value of the analyzed solution. The 
model we have used is the PIC18F2525 which is fed at 5V. 
We can use the microcontroller to display information via a 
LCD display or to send the information through the RS232 
port to a personal computer. 
Fig. 1 shows the schematic of our turbidity sensor. 
B. Cost of our turbidity sensor 
The electronic components used in our turbidity sensor 
can be easily found. We have asked for their prize in a 
Spanish electronic distributor. The prizes of the main 
components are shown in Table II.

TEST BENCH AND MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
Our 
main 
problem 
when 
taking 
the 
turbidity 
measurements was to determine the turbidity level of each 
solution test probe. These values were necessary in order to 
estimate the analytical model of our system. This section 
explains the process carried out to take the measurements 
and the calibration process of our system. 
A. Used elements 
On the one hand, we employed a calibrated turbidimeter 
to know the accurate value of turbidity of each test probe to 
be measured. The used device is Turbidimeter Hach 2100N. 
This turbidimeter can take measurements in two modes (ratio

mode and non-ratio mode). We have used the non-ratio 
mode, which measures the turbidity by using a detector 
placed at 90 degrees. 
All measures have been performed for seawater. The 
salinity of the sea water depends on the geographic position. 
Our samples were taken from the east coast of the 
Mediterranean Sea (Spain). The average water salinity 
ranges from 36 to 38 grams per liter. pH is 8.07 and its 
temperature is 21.1ºC. 
Regarding to the elements used to generate the 
dissolutions with different turbidities, we have used a 
mixture of clay and silt. The silt is a loose material with a 
grain size between fine sand and clay. It is an incoherent 
classic sediment transported in suspension by rivers. The 
particle size of our sample is between 0.002 mm and 0.06 
mm. 
The glass containers used in our test had a volume of 
30ml. First, took four calibration samples in the turbidimeter 
Hach 2100N. Then, we took 10 samples with turbidities. 
Next, we performed more samples at lower concentrations 
than at higher ones because lower concentrations are most 
usual. The concentration samples we prepared are shown in 
Table III. We have selected samples with low turbidity 
because for devices low turbidities are more difficult to 
measure these. 
Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the amount of 
solute and the concentration of the test probe. 
We can extract the relationship between both values 
using (3) with a correlation coefficient of 0.9999.

where C represents the concentration of the dissolution in 
mg/l and S represents the amount of solute in g. Because the 
independent term is extremely small value, we can 
approximate this relationship as (4): 
                                              (4) 
Each prepared sample has a turbidity value. Fig. 3 shows 
the relationship between the concentration of silt-clay in 
ocean water and the water turbidity value. 
Equation (5) shows the relationship between both 
parameters with a correlation coefficient of 0.9999.

where, T represents the turbidity in NTU and C is the 
dissolution concentration in mg/l.  
Finally, we can express the turbidity as a function of the 
amount of clay-silt dissolved combining (4) and (5). It is 
given by (6).

B. Obtained results 
After measuring the turbidity of each sample, we placed 
each one in our system in order to measure their voltage 
values.

Fig. 4 shows the gathered output voltage value for each 
the turbidity. The prepared samples are shown in red while 
the standard samples are shown in blue. We can see that the 
behavior of our system is not linear. Its behavior can be 
approximated to a linear function up turbidity values of 300 
NTU. But, for higher turbidity values, the behavior is closer 
to a curve function with an error lower than ±1%. 
We used Eureqa Formulize [13] to estimate the analytical 
model. Using these 14 samples, we have estimated the 
analytical expression that models the behavior of our 
turbidity sensor. The program provided us several models 
but the one which provided best results is the model show in 
(7). Equation (8) relates the turbidity with the output voltage 
of our system, where, t represents the turbidity in NTU and v 
the output voltage. 
Fig. 5 shows the obtained values for each sample in blue 
(estimated, using (8)). The obtained output voltage values for 
the same samples are shown in red. As Fig.5 shows both 
values are close. 
Finally, in order to check the accuracy of our system, we 
represent the output voltage value predicted by our model 
versus the value of output voltage obtained by our system. 
Fig. 6 shows this relation. As Fig.6 shows, most of the points 
remain in the black line, which indicates a perfect match. 
From Eq. 8, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, we observe that our 
equation has a correlation coefficient of 0.99897 and its 
maximum error is 0.1 Volts. 
C. Verification 
In order to test the accuracy of our system, we have 
compared the values obtained by the turbidimeter Hach 
2100N and the values obtained by our turbidity sensor. 
In the verification test, we have chosen low concentration 
samples, which means low turbidity. In these situations, it is 
more difficult to measure accurately the turbidity. 
Commercial Turbidimeters have also problems in low 
turbidities. In order to perform this step, we have prepared 
four samples with unknown concentrations. The output 
voltages obtained for each sample are shown in table IV. 
Estimating the turbidity values by using (8), we have 
introduced our samples (in blue) in (7). It shows the behavior 
of our system. In order to compare the estimated turbidity 
values with the measured values and the error for the four 
samples, we provide Table V.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented the circuit of a low cost 
turbidity sensor. In addition, we have performed several tests 
in sea water to model and to calibrate the operation of our 
turbidity sensor.  
Although sea water usually presents low turbidity levels 
and we have focused our system in lower values; we have 
also added some values of higher turbidity level. For low 
turbidity values, we have obtained a maximum error of 
5.22%. We have also compared the prize of our device with 
commercial ones in Table VI.

Seeing these prizes, we think we are able to develop a 
low cost turbidity sensor. 
In our future work, we will improve our system. First, we 
believe that there are some external factors such as the 
measurement system disposal and the electronic elements 
placement, significantly affect the sampling process. So, we 
will improve our measurement system. 
On the other hand, we will improve the way to find the 
analytical relationship between the measured parameters by 
adding more mathematical operations. Additionally, we 
would like to perform other calibrations with others waters. 
After these improvements, we would like to test our 
sensor in marine fish farms [14].
