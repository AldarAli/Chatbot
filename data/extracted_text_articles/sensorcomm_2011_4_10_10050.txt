Abstract—Collaborative sensor relocation has potential to 
improve Mobile Sensor Network (MSN) performance while 
prolonging its life span by conserving sensor battery energy.  
However, lack of centralized control, variety of performance 
criteria, numerous uncertainties, and a possibility of sensor 
trapping in sub-optimal positions make collaborative sensor 
relocation an exceedingly challenging problem.  Assuming that 
the sensing and communication operations are optimized much 
faster than sensors relocate, this paper proposes a sensor 
relocation strategy based on iterations of a Distributed 
Subgradient Projection Algorithm (DSPA).  While maintaining 
inherently distributed nature of the computations, DSPA-based 
sensor relocation is capable of aligning sensor mobility with the 
overall MSN goals.  This approach also accounts for a possibility 
of abrupt topology changes as sensors relocate.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Mobile Sensor Networks (MSN) are envisioned to offer a 
novel set of applications in detecting, monitoring and tracking 
people, targets or events in pervasive computing environments 
[1].  Locations of sensors in a MSN affect both their ability to 
acquire information on the intended target(s) and event(s) as 
well as their ability to communicate this information to the 
intended recipient(s).  The information acquisition needs, 
which require proximity to the target(s), often compete with 
the communication needs, which require proximity to the 
recipient(s) of the sensor information.  Inherent traits of MSN 
such as lack of centralized control, variety of performance 
criteria, operational uncertainties, and possibilities of MSN 
topology change and sensor trapping in suboptimal locations 
make MSN optimization an exceedingly challenging problem.   
Our previous publications [2]-[4] proposed aligning sensor 
mobility with the overall MSN goals by assuming that (a) 
sensing and communication are optimized much faster than 
sensors relocation and (b) sensor relocations are governed by 
cost/benefit analysis where “cost” of sensor battery energy 
expenditure for sensor relocation is weighted against projected 
performance gains due to new sensor locations.  This approach 
is vastly superior to sensor mobility control based on 
phenomenologically 
defined 
potential 
fields 
and 
the 
corresponding virtual forces [5].  This is because dissipation of 
the non-renewable sensor battery energy, asymmetric virtual 
forces due to asymmetric wireless channels, and abrupt 
changes in the optimal MSN topology with sensor relocation 
are inconsistent with the existence of global potential field.   
Practicality of the framework proposed in [2]-[3] depends 
on overcoming numerous challenges with (inherently) 
distributed nature of MSN being the most critical.  An 
intelligent sensor may have direct knowledge of its current life 
expectancy determined by its battery energy level and 
depletion rate affected by the surrounding terrain as well as 
sensor information acquisition and transmission capabilities.  
However, a sensor typically has no direct knowledge of the 
effect of its relocation on the rest of the MSN. 
This paper suggests that the class of Distributed 
Subgradient Projection Algorithms (DSPA) [6]-[7] has 
potential for addressing major challenges of controlled sensor 
mobility in MSN. Subgradient-based iterations allows for 
dynamic network topology optimization. Projection of the 
algorithm iterations onto the set of feasible sensor locations 
ensures sensor information acquisition and communication 
needs. Most importantly communication overhead reducing 
techniques allow for addressing the inherently distributed 
nature of MSN.  While more conventional pricing-based 
algorithms effectively reduce the communication overhead in 
some particular situations, recently emerged consensus-based 
algorithms have low communication overhead in a more 
general setting.   
Consensus-based algorithms differ in their approach to 
achieving consensus.  In the first type [6] each agent maintains 
and iterates its own sequence, and consensus is achieved by 
communicating this sequence to the neighboring nodes, who 
incorporate neighbors’ sequences into their own sequences 
through averaging.  In the second type [7] all agents update a 
single sequence and consensus is achieved by passing the 
sequence instances to each other.  In this paper, we 
concentrate on the first type since updating and passing 
instances of a single sequence by agents to each other exposes 
algorithm to the risk of manipulation by malicious agents 
while averaging with judiciously chosen weights can mitigate 
this risk. Comparison and suitability of a particular consensus-
based algorithm for controlling sensor mobility is left for a 
future study. 
A major difficulty with controlling sensor relocation is the 
possibility of sensor trapping in suboptimal locations (e.g. in 
non-flat terrain) due to typical non-convexity of the 
performance criterion [8].  A possible approach to overcoming 
91

this difficulty is allowing occasional random sensor 
relocations to escape the potential traps in the spirit of 
simulated annealing optimization algorithm [9]-[10].  One of 
the advantages of the proposed approach in this paper is in its 
ability to incorporate such random moves in a distributed way. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.  Section II 
quantifies the effect of sensors positions on MSN 
performance; while the effect of sensors relocation in 
discussed in section III.    Section IV describes sensor 
relocation algorithms based on maximization of the 
corresponding performance gain.  Section V discusses initial 
simulation results showing benefits of cooperative sensor 
relocation for the case of a MSN tracking a single target on a 
flat terrain.  Finally, section VI briefly summarizes the 
proposed approach to controlled sensor mobility and outlines 
directions for future research.

that our goal is to maximize the MSN life span, given the 
constraints on sensors ability to acquire and communicate 
sensor information at some low fixed rate and sensor battery 
energy availability.  Subsection A describes requirements on 
MSN ability to acquire and communicate information to the 
destination.  Subsection B quantifies effect of sensor locations 
on MSN performance.

ability to acquire information are formalized directly in terms

with respect to their ability to cover the area of interest. 
III. 
RELOCATION GAIN 
Subsection A quantifies cost/benefits of sensor relocations, 
where cost is associated with the energy expenditure on sensor 
relocations; and, potential benefits are associated with better 
information gathering (or transmission) due to the new sensor 
positions. Subsection B introduces subgradients of MSN 
utility and describes the effect of sensor relocations on the 
MSN performance. It also discusses communication overhead 
required for estimation of these subgradients.

COOPERATIVE SENSOR RELOCATION 
Subsection A proposes cooperative sensor relocation 
following iterations of subgradient projection algorithm for 
solving the optimization problem (13)-(14).  Subsection B 
proposes consensus-based cooperative sensor relocation, 
which mitigates high communication overhead. This is 
achieved by following iterations of the decentralized 
subgradient projection algorithm.  Subsection C suggests that 
combining decentralized subgradient projection algorithm 
with simulated annealing may result in avoiding traps on non-
flat terrains.

S  relocation on its performance as 
measured by 
gsi (x)
. We consider cooperative sensor 
relocation by iterations of Distributed Subgradient Projection 
Algorithm (DSPA) for solving optimization problem (13)-
(14). DSPA achieves cooperation by building consensus on 
optimal sensor locations through information exchange 
between each sensor and its neighbors.  In effect, DSPA offers 
a consistent approach to overall performance optimization 
while minimizing the communication overhead.  Again for 
brevity, we only describe DSPA-based cooperative sensor 
relocation and refer to [6] for elaborate details of DSPA.

C. Escaping Traps with Random Moves 
Using local information for controlled sensor relocation on 
non-flat terrain is prone to sensor trapping in suboptimal 
positions due to typical non-convexity of the performance 
criterion [8].    A combination of controlled sensor mobility 
with simulated annealing to avoid sensor trapping has been 
proposed in [9] and further discussed in [10].  This subsection 
discusses a possibility of combining DSPA-based sensor 
relocation and simulated annealing algorithms.

In the case of “high temperature”:

, sensors perform optimization (13)-(14).  The main 
advantage of simulated annealing algorithm is that it allows 
for obtaining guidelines on the “cooling schedule” in order to 
ensure convergence to the global solution of optimization 
problem (13)-(14).  Therefore, with a proper cooling schedule 
sensors can avoid traps. 
 
The problem with random relocations following (24) is 
that this algorithm is centralized.  In the spirit of a distributed 
subgradient algorithm, it is natural to relocate sensor s   from

existence of a cooling schedule that allows sensors to avoid

EXAMPLE: TRACKING A SINGLE TARGET 
Consider a MSN designed to track a single target G  and 
communicate the desired information at a low rate to a fixed 
destination D .  For brevity, here we only discuss simulation 
results for a scenario with 
6
S
 sensors on a flat terrain 
where signal attenuation depends only on the distance (6).  To 
simplify further, we assume that energy required for relocation 
is proportional to the travelled distance.  It can be shown that 
under some natural conditions and for sufficiently high initial 
sensor battery energy levels, the optimal MSN topology is 
linear with only one sensor tracking the target and the rest of 
the sensors relaying this information to the destination, 
formally identified as sensor 
0
s
.   
Figure 1 shows this linear topology with six sensor, where 
information flows from the target to the destination:

We also assume that sensors have the maximal communication 
and sensing range indicated by the corresponding circles in 
Figure 1.  Sensor relocation algorithm accounts for existence 
of these maximal ranges by projecting the iterations of the 
relocation algorithm onto properly designed set of feasible 
sensor positions.   
 In a case of stationary sensors, Figure 2 shows that sensor 
battery energy draining rate is completely determined by the 
initial sensor positions with respect to the stationary 
destination and the target (which may or may not be 
stationary).

Figure 2 demonstrates imbalances in sensor battery energy 
draining rates due to initial sensor positions.  Since in our 
model sensors use minimal communication power required for 
MSN operation, the network becomes non-operational in 
approximately 90 minutes. This is the time when sensor 
3
s
 
spends all of its energy.    
In the case of non-cooperative sensor relocation, shown in 
Figure 3, the MSN becomes non-operational in approximately 
140 minutes when sensors

Figure 3.  Residual sensor energy: selfish relocation 
 
The inverse S-shape of the residual sensor energy evolution, 
shown in Figure 3, is indicative of selfish sensor relocation 
when each sensor attempts to prolong its own life-span.  In 
this case, each sensor is attempting to minimize its 
transmission power by positioning itself at the “middle point” 
of the neighboring sensors without any consideration for 
conserving the neighbors’ battery energy.  This “selfish” 
sensor positioning is responsible for lack of coordination 
shown in Figure 3.    
In a case of cooperative sensor relocation, shown in 
Figure 4, all sensors deplete their battery simultaneously 
prolonging MSN life span to approximately 300 minutes.  This 
is achieved through cooperation, when sensors with longer life 
expectancy are “willing” to relocate longer distances in order 
to save energy for sensors with shorter life expectancy.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
This paper has proposed an approach to controlled 
cooperative sensor relocation in a Mobile Sensor Network 
(MSN) by following iterations of a Distributed Subgradient 
Projection Algorithm (DSPA) for aggregate performance 
optimization.  The main advantage of this approach is in its 
ability to accommodate locally available information on 
battery energy availability, sensing, communication and 
relocation “costs” with respect to the energy expenditure in an 
inherently decentralized environment.  Initial simulation 
results indicate viability of this approach for prolonging the 
MSN life-span.   
 
Future research should evaluate pros and cons of different 
versions of distributed subgradient algorithms with respect to 
controlled sensor relocation, and provide guidelines for 
selection of the algorithm step size and free parameters 
involved in the “consensus” step.    These selections affect the 
trade-off between the algorithm convergence rate and 
communication overhead.  The ability to avoid traps on non-
flat terrains is critical for practical implementation of 
controlled sensor relocation.  This paper has suggested the 
possibility of achieving this by combining a distributed 
subgradient projection and simulated annealing algorithms.  
More studies need to be done to realize this possibility, 
including developing distributed cooling scheduling. 
 
Finally, note that the important issue of initial network 
formation has not been discussed.  Distributed subgradient 
optimization algorithms assume agent connectivity.  However, 
at the initial stage mobile sensors may be organized in several 
disconnected clusters.  In that case, controlled sensor mobility 
should simultaneously pursue two goals: collaboration within 
clusters and establishing connectivity between clusters.  This 
problem, which can be broadly framed as controlled mobility 
in Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTN), would require new 
ideas and approaches.
