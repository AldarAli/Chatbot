Abstract—Multilayer multistage interconnection networks 
have introduced multiple parallel layers for enhancing 
performance 
metrics 
over 
traditional 
multistage 
interconnection networks. In this work, we propose an 
innovative multilayer multistage interconnection network 
fabric, which improves the switch efficiency by allowing 
multiple internal paths. The proposed fabric has demonstrated 
improved performance metrics compared to other existing 
fabrics and acceptable reliability in terms of fault tolerance. 
This type of fabric can considerably enhance the connection 
points of a modern network and improve its data flow. The 
configuration of the network allows for a conflict drop 
resolution mechanism or a classic backpressure blocking 
mechanism. This novel fabric can also handle multicast traffic, 
hotspot traffic or a combination of them.

INTRODUCTION 
Multilayer 
Multistage 
Interconnection 
Networks 
(MLMINs) are devices that improve performance metrics 
when transferring data. The use of MLMINs avoids the 
necessity for the crossbar type of interconnection device, 
which is expensive to construct. However, although this 
shared-bus type of switching device is of low cost, it has low 
performance and therefore there is a need for interconnection 
devices, 
which 
strike 
a 
balance 
between 
efficient 
performance, reliability and reasonable cost. MLMINs were 
proposed by Tutsch and Hommel [1], after it was found in 
various studies that more switching power was needed in the 
last stages of a multistage interconnection network (MIN) 
than in the first stages [1]-[5].  
The performance of MLMINs has been studied 
thoroughly by Garofalakis et al. [3] [6].  
A typical MLMIN consists of an 
N  N
 MIN and 
N
L
 logk
stages and 
k  k
 or 
k  n
 switching elements 
(SEs), where k  and n  are the number of inlets/outlets of the 
SEs.  
A typical MLMIN has two seriatim segments: the single-
layer segment followed by the multilayer segment.  
In the first segment, each stage consists of  
/ )
(
N k
 SEs 
of size
k  k
, while the last stage consists of SEs with 
size
k  n
, where
n  k
.  
In the second stage, however, the multilayer segment 
consists of 
k  k
 SEs in parallel rows. If the single layer 
segment has S stages, the second part has 
L  S
 stages. 
The size of S is a matter of engineering choice, and depends 
on the degree of reduction to be implemented in the last 
stages of construction.

Figure 1. Schematic view of several MLMINs and corresponding 
definitions 
In addition to the above, in order to accurately determine 
the structure of a MLMIN, three further parameters are 
required [3].  
The first parameter is called the “Start replication factor” 
(
S
G ), and denotes the stage number at which the replication 
of layers starts. The second parameter is known as the 
“Growth factor” (
GF
), and denotes the number of layers 
that can be developed at one stage by each SE. Finally, the 
third parameter is the “Layer limit factor” (
L
G ), and this 
denotes the maximum number of layer replications. 
Structures which can be described by the above three 
parameters are known as semi-layer MINs [6].  
Figure 1 illustrates several MLMINs and gives the three 
factors that describe them. Of all the possible types of 
multilayer MINs, semi-layer MINs are the most suitable for 
use in the information technology industry due to the 
simplicity of their construction compared to other multilevel 
devices.

In addition to their performance characteristics, their fault 
tolerance or reliability is of interest to the scientific 
community, since the requirements of modern applications 
involve a constant demand for improved solutions [7, 9-10, 
12-13]. 
In this work, in order to improve the behaviour of 
MLMINs even further, the number of possible paths between 
each pair (input-output) is multiplied. In this architecture, in 
cases of internal blocking, the system has the ability to send 
the packet via another, 'parallel', alternative route. This 
operation reduces the stacking of packets in internal buffers, 
increasing forwarding speed.  
A series of multiplexers (MUXs) at the beginning of the 
fabric is introduced to implement this concept. This 
mechanism can dissipate the packets using multiple paths. 
The diffusion of packets increases (since more parallel paths 
are used) as the blocking phenomenon develops.  
This forms the basic concept underlying the current 
work. To implement this idea, a new architecture is 
introduced which significantly raises both performance 
metrics and the reliability factor to acceptable values. 
Moreover, this system provides the ability to handle special 
load cases such as hotspot or multicast traffic.  
Hence, the novel contribution of this work can be briefly 
summarized as:  
 A new, productive and therefore promising MLMIN 
architecture is introduced with finite buffers, multiple 
internal routes and MUXs.  
 A simple but detailed study of the proposed fabrics is 
carried out, showing that these fabrics have many 
benefits; the results from the proposed fabric in terms 
of metrics, the reliability factor and packet latency are 
encouraging. 
 A comparative study of other similar modern 
architectures 
indicates 
that 
the 
new 
fabric 
outperforms these in permutation capability and has 
an acceptable level of reliability.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In 
Section II, the proposed MLMIN fabric is introduced and 
several details of its operation (e.g., internal paths and 
routing) are presented. In Section III, the basic definitions 
are given and the necessary analysis carried out. In Section 
IV, the reliability and performance capability are analysed, 
and several numerical outcomes are described for the 
implemented MLMINs in terms of network size. Finally, in 
Section V, the conclusions and anticipated future work are 
presented.

THE PROPOSED FABRIC 
A. Proposed fabric: Semi-layer MIN with internal path 
redundancy 
To establish internal paths and to disperse the load 
uniformly, a preamble block composed of MUXs is located 
in front of the MIN. Thus, the proposed MIN consists of 
three segments in sequence, as presented below (Fig. 2). 
 
Figure 2: Fabric with internal path redundancy consisting of three blocks 
 
1) Preamble of the MIN segment: In the preamble block, 
a column of 
m1
 MUXs are used to connect the inputs of 
the first stage of the MIN. Thus, a 
N  N
network needs  

3N / 2
multiplexers at the input stage (See Figure 3). This 
part is introduced because we want to have the possibility to 
make diffusion packages to alternative paths, when the first 
of them are busy.The main body of the MLMIN follows the 
preamble segment.  
2) First segment of the MIN (single-layered segment): 
The first segment of the MIN contains only a single layer, 
which employs multiple internal paths (see Figure 3).

segments, shown here for a network of diameter 3

switches per stage, where S is the stage number of 
the single-layer segment. This part consists of 
22
 
switches, except for the final stage, which employs 
2 2m
 
switches, where
m  ,1 ,2 ...
 depends on the fan-out 
configuration to which they are connected (Figure 4). 
3) Second segment of the MIN (multilayered segment or 
fan-out): 
The 
multilayered 
segment 
or 
fan-out 
is 
accommodated in the second segment (Fig. 4). In the case of 
a double layer (one stage multiplied) the fan-out has a 
quantity 

layered (one stage multiplied) network is composed of

switches.

For simplicity, the proposed device is referred to here as 
SemiL (Semi-Layer MIN with multiple internal paths). 
 
B. Multiple paths between two points 
Fig. 5 shows all the possible routes between two points of 
the MIN (inlet: 000; outlet: 000), e.g., in a fabric with eight 
inputs and equal outputs. All alternative paths have the same 
length, which means that while the network is operating in 
real time, many equivalent actions for bypassing blocks are 
generated when faults arise in the system.  
In standard
N  N
MLMINs, there are 
2log2 N
 distinct 
routes from one input point to all outputs, and thus a total of 
possible routes of 
N
N
 2log2
distinct paths. However, the 
equivalent novel MLMIN fabric, which contains internal 
redundancy paths, provides
N

 distinct paths. 
Hence, for example, a classic MLMIN with 
N  8
 provides 
64 distinct paths, while the equivalent novel MLMIN fabric 
provides six times more (6x64) distinct paths.  
C. Marking paths 
Marking paths and establishing a hierarchy among the 
different paths aids in the implementation of an automatic 
routing mechanism. Taking an arbitrary input-output pair, 
then according to Fig. 5, packets can be routed from an input 
(e.g., 000) via three different SEs (SE01, SE21 and SE41). 
These links can be considered as the first link (FL) of the 
path.

Figure 5: Example of multiple paths for an input-output pair (000, 000) 
shown here for a network of diameter 3 
 
Thus, FL1, FL2 and FL3 links are marked. Each request 
at Stage 1 has to choose one of these three links. 
Subsequently, from Stage 1 to the next stage, each request 
has two available links to choose from. The first is marked as 
the main link (ML), while the other can be marked as the 
auxiliary link (AL).  
The same pattern of marking of links is continued for all 
the following stages of the single-layer segment. As the 
number of stages is increased, the number of distinct paths is 
multiplied. Thus, we have links marked MLn and ALn where 
n ϵ[1, +∞].  
As a whole, this approach leads to distinct routes which 
constitute a hierarchy at every stage. Fig. 5 shows all the 
possible paths between an arbitrary input-output pair. In 
addition, it depicts the intermediate nodes (e.g., switches) 
that are involved in a specific input-output pair.   
D. Routing technique and blocking mechanism 
The clocking of the internal fabric guides the whole 
routing operation. The packets are forwarded synchronously 
at every stage in a parallel manner. 
In MINs, routing and forwarding decisions are made 
independently for each packet by computation for each 
outgoing link. When a packet enters the fabric, it receives the 
‘routing address’ (RA). The RA has as many bits as the 
number of stages in the MIN. The bits of the RA guide the 
packet-forwarding through the MIN, from SE to SE. 
The RA is used by a packet in order to reach its unicast 
destination (including in the case of hotspot traffic). 
Moreover, in the case of multicast distribution, beyond the 
RA, a ‘multicast tree number address’ (MTNA) is assigned 
to each packet. Both types of address have as many bits as 
the number of stages in the MIN. The multicast address

indicates at which stage a packet has to act as a multicast 
operation (generating a copy packet), thus creating the so-
called ‘multicast tree’ if this mechanism is implemented in 
the fabric. 
The multistage construction described above can work 
either with backpressure or with a drop resolution 
mechanism. For simplicity, the accommodation of the 
backpressure technique in the system is considered here. 
This backpressure mechanism is appropriate in a network 
where systems employ non-deterministic protocols such as 
the UDP protocol; however, the back-pressing operation is 
completely unsuitable for deterministic protocols, such as the 
TCP protocol. Nowadays, although the backpressure 
mechanism is considered responsible for phenomena such as 
packet looping, large packet delays, and scalability, it 
continues to be implemented due to a lack of credible 
alternatives.  
For the selection of an internal path which is not 
overburdened, the concept of backpressure weight per link 
may be introduced at the start of the device and constantly 
calculated for each input-output pair. A backpressure weight 
is an operation (function) based on local queue conditions, 
and gives information about the link state.   
In contrast, the drop resolution mechanism, also known 
as the relaxing blocking mechanism, may be used when the 
switching element suffers from blocking; it sends back a 
request releasing a signal to the sender along a specific 
established route. In this case, this path is discarded at the 
end of the time cycle. The blocked request, now lost, repeats 
the same process (starting again from the beginning) until a 
new path is established.

BASIC DEFINITIONS AND ESSENTIAL ANALYSIS OF

Probability of packet arrivals

probability of packet arrivals is ranked from 0.1 to 
1.0, with steps equal to 0.1. This probability can be 
expressed as

Buffer size 
)
(b  represents the maximum number of 
packets that can be held by an input buffer of an SE.  
 
Reliability ( r ) of a component represents the 
probability of a switch component being operational.  
Each switch component has its own reliability. The 
reliability symbol can be denoted by
rtype n
, where 
type signifies the switch type and n  depicts the 
number of gates of the switch. Thus, for example, 
rMUXn
 and DEMUXn
r
 signify the reliability of the 
nx1 multiplexer and the 1xn de-multiplexer 
respectively, and
rSE2x2

rSE2x4

rSE2x6
 
represent the reliabilities of
SE2x2

SE2x4
and 
SE2x6
 correspondingly. 
 
Average throughput (
Tavg
) signifies the average 
number of packets accepted by all destinations per 
network cycle. Because the last stage of a single 
layer is never blocked, the average throughput can 
be expressed as

utilization of the S stages. 
Moreover, 
TNorm
 is the normalized throughput

 
Normalized packet latency (
DNorm
), of a MIN with 
L stages is defined as the ratio of average latency 
(

) to the minimum packet delay. As minimum 
packet delay we consider the minimum number of 
time slots needed by a packet to be transmitted to its 
destination, i.e. when packets don’t face any 
blocking during their routes. For L -stage MINs the 
minimum delay is equal to ( L ) time slots. Thus

p reliability, the probability of at least one fault-free 
path existing between an input-output pair is 
considered. The reliability between an arbitrary 
given pair (inlet-outlet) is dependent on all the 
switch elements involved, insofar as the failure of 
each element implies the failure of the current 
routing action [11]-[13]. Supposing there is a 
switching subsystem with a series of n  switch 
components, each with a reliability of ir ; then, the

RELIABILITY AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
A. Reliability of the proposed fabric 
For reliability analysis of the novel fabric, p-t-p reliability 
is used. As discussed above, in p-t-p reliability the 
probability of at least one fault-free path existing between an 
input-output pair is considered [See Figure 6]. The total p-t-p

For low values of component factor r (e.g., r=0.9) it can 
clearly be seen that the total p-t-p reliability for networks 
with high network diameter (e.g., size N=256) is greatly 
reduced.  
When the factor r tends to 1, all the fabrics, regardless of 
network diameter (size), tend to have the maximum p-t-p 
reliability of value 1.

Figure 7: Total path reliability versus reliability of components (r) for 
various network diameters 
Fig. 8 shows the total input-output reliability for various 
types of MIN. With adjacent groups of bars corresponding to 
given values of the component reliability (r), the two left-
hand bars of each group represent the total p-t-p reliability of 
MLMINs (SeLMINs) that do not use internal paths and have 
replication factors of 3 and 2 respectively. 
The two right-hand bars of each group depict the total p-
t-p reliability of MLMINs (SemiLs) that include internal 
paths and have replication factors of 3 and 2 respectively. 
The central bar represents the p-t-p reliability of a Pars 
network.

It can be seen that the novel fabric is not the most 
effective in terms of p-t-p reliability. Fortunately, this 
weakness is improved if the selected components have a 
reliability tending to a value of 1. 
B. Performance capability 
In most cases, the performance of MINs is estimated 
using analytical approaches [2]; in the remaining cases, 
simulation is used [4]-[6]. In this study, network 
performance was calculated using simulation. For this 
simulation, a special-purpose simulator was developed to 
evaluate the overall network performance of the MLMINs 
with internal path redundancy as well as without redundancy 
paths. This tool was developed in C++, and is capable of 
operating under various conﬁguration scenarios and handling 
uniform traffic. It operates with various input parameters 
such as buffer size, number of inlets/outlets, offered load, 
number of stages, and number of layers in the last segment of 
the fabric. Each SE was modelled using an array of non-
shared buffer pairs of queues. Each queue operates on a 
FIFO (first input, first output) principle and each buffer is 
considered to be empty initially. In the same way, the 
simulation was carried out for single-layer MINs, and the 
results were used for comparison with the corresponding 
fabrics with redundant paths.  
All simulation experiments were performed at packet 
level, assuming ﬁxed-size packets transmitted in fixed-size 
timeslots, where the timeslot cycle is defined as the time 
required by a packet to be transferred from one stage to the 
next. All packet contentions, which occur when two packets 
claim the same next point, are resolved randomly.  
Figure 9 represents the increments of normalized packet 
latency of various MLMIN constructions with a network size 
of 8 (that is, a network diameter of value 3) and various 
values of uniform type offered load (varying from 10–
100%). 
The two upper solid curves depict the normalized latency 
of a single-layer MIN (SiLMIN) with buffer sizes of 2 and 3 
respectively. The dotted curves represent the same quantity 
for semi-layer MINs (SeLMINs) without internal path 
redundancy, with buffer sizes of 2 and 3 respectively and a 
replication factor of 3.

various MIN architectures with a network diameter of 3 
Finally, the lowest solid curve depicts the packet latency 
of the novel fabric (with internal paths redundancy, also 
referred to here as SemiL) with buffer size equal to 1 and 
replication factor of 3. 
This diagram demonstrates that when the offered load 
exceeds a value of 70%, the novel fabric presents the 
smallest packet latency in comparison with other devices 
which are equivalent in terms of network size. This 
improvement in latency can be explained as follows. When a 
heavy load is required to be transferred, this leads to a large

number of blocks (and particularly in the last stages). As a 
consequence, this leads the fabric to use a greater number of 
alternative routes, thus relieving the blocking phenomenon. 
The conclusion which can clearly be drawn from this plot is 
that the novel fabric is the most efficient choice in terms of 
packet delay, in comparison with other similar architectures 
that do not include internal paths.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
An innovative MLMIN is presented in this paper. The 
proposed fabric is composed of a preamble containing 
MUXs, a single-layer MIN with internal path redundancy 
implementation, and a fan-out in the final segment. This 
structure is composed of 
22
 and 
22m
switches, 
depending on the replication factor. Multiple paths for each 
input-output pair are provided by the fabric. This allows 
network connections to handle the traffic more efficiently. 
The current preliminary but careful study indicates that the 
proposed MLMIN architecture outperforms conventional 
MLMINs in terms of performance metrics and offers 
acceptable values of reliability and fault tolerance.  
This work has many possibilities for extension. For 
example, this system requires study under conditions of 
hotspot traffic or a multicast service, and should also be 
evaluated in terms of performance metrics, priorities and cost 
metrics when operating with a backpressure or relaxing 
mechanism.
