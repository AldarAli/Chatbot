Abstract—This article presents an extended research of the
main results from creating objects equipped with classiﬁcations
and concordances as base for advanced discovery, processing,
and computing based on knowledge resources. Today big data
collections and resources sadly combine one or more deﬁcits of
being unclassiﬁed, unstructured, isolated, and weakly developed
on the one hand and in consequence only accessible with
insufﬁcient simplistic means on the other hand. New classiﬁcation
features, structures, and components have been developed, which
can be ﬂexibly used with multi-disciplinary, multi-lingual long-
term knowledge resources. The extended facilities can be used for
universal long-term knowledge resources beyond the simple and
isolated use of knowledge and data. The goal of this research is to
create advanced resources and methods based on classiﬁcations
and concordances. The focus is to provide facilities for advanced
discovery processes based on universal knowledge resources
and showing that content, classiﬁcation, and concordances are
valuable long-term assets.

INTRODUCTION
This extended research is based on the results from multi-
disciplinary project for the creation of objects and concor-
dances, which are intended to be used for long-term knowl-
edge creation knowledge processing, and advanced computing.
The basic fundaments of the results were presented at the
INFOCOMP 2015 conference in Brussels, Belgium [1].
Advanced knowledge discovery and computing can be
based on appropriate knowledge resources, concordances, and
classiﬁcation. The knowledge resources require spanning a
reasonable width and depth of knowledge and universal and
long-term features.
The fundaments of these required features are the results
from the development of advanced object features for long-
term knowledge resources, which can be used for universal
documentation and consequent purposes. For the consequent
purposes like advanced knowledge discovery, further creation
and development of knowledge resources, visualisation, and
education suitable, data-centred structures have been created
being usable for advanced knowledge discovery and processing
and for advanced and dynamical computing.
Up to now the world of increasingly big data is limited to
data and data collections, which are rapidly growing in quan-
tity, mostly even growing in storage requirements instead of
knowledge only. Besides the data being unstructured, isolated,
and often inconsistent in content and form it is also missing
quality and essential features for conceptional knowledge like
classiﬁcation. One consequence is that in the last decades the
means for accessing and handling data have not changed a
lot regarding the content, context, and a next generation of
features and quality.
The facilities provide advanced features for processing of
knowledge as well as for ﬂexible computing. Therefore, the
creation and long-term care for suitable knowledge objects is
a central issue. The knowledge resources have to be able to
document any knowledge and data, e.g., factual and proce-
dural knowledge, which require vertical as well as horizontal
scalability for individual and subsequent use. In order to cope
with the deﬁcits this architecture can integrate structured and
unstructured data, support universal classiﬁcation and concor-
dances and it can enable advanced knowledge processing, like
parallel processing and dynamical visualisation.
The goal of this research is to create advanced resources and
methods based on classiﬁcations and concordances. The focus
of this research is to provide sustainable facilities for advanced
discovery processes based on universal knowledge resources
and showing that content, classiﬁcation, and concordances
are valuable long-term assets for integrating documentation
and applicability. This paper presents the up-to-date research
results from the creation of classiﬁcations and concordances
for long-term knowledge resources’ components, structures,
and workﬂows for advanced processing and computing – and
in the end most important on the long run, fostering the
investments in the development of the data itself. Therefore,
the major contributions of this research are the content and
context, especially the integration of classiﬁcation and con-
cordances, on the one hand and on the other hand the new
practical insights on improving the state-of-the-art of long-term
documentation and application of universal knowledge.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II introduces
state-of-the-art and motivation for creating an overall system.
Section III discusses the research fundaments. Sections IV and
V present the data-centric implementation, the implementation
of resources, including concordances and classiﬁcation with
the creation of objects. Section VI shows the deﬁnition and
organisation of implemented knowledge resources. Section VII
provides selected content facets. Section VIII summarises
the implemented features for processing and computing. and
Sections IX and X provide an evaluation and summarise the
main results, lessons learned, conclusions and future work.

II.
STATE-OF-THE-ART AND MOTIVATION
Conceptual knowledge is an important issue with many
aspects of knowledge discovery. Content and context can be
provided by structured and unstructured data. Both can be
assembled and collected, e.g., in collections and containers.
Regarding the value of data it can be seen as a drawback
that most public developments are focussing on technical
implementations and not on the content [2]. In public pre-
sentation and marketing common understanding of containers
is reduced to certain aspects, e.g., security features [3], [4].
Other container concepts for handling Big Data, especially sci-
entiﬁc data, e.g., the NERSC ‘Shifter’ at the National Energy
Research Scientiﬁc Computing Center [5] are focussing on
technology-centric and implementation purposes.
These approaches are insufﬁcient from the content and
knowledge related point of view of containers. For example,
on the one hand, there is nothing general for a container when
postulating that it should contain “everything”. At the same
level, security features have to be considered very special with
speciﬁc cases of application. In addition, in most cases the
advanced application scenarios trigger those secondary con-
ditions. On the other hand, containers must not only provide
computational features. The result is that up to now we neither
have a commonly discussed container concept nor a set of
universal features.
A container is a term for a data or ﬁle format bundling
the data for certain purpose and application. The features for
anything more interesting will include data, documentation,
references and so on. Doing so includes how the information is
transferred or accessed, which includes to deﬁne the modalities
for a certain scenario. When discussing containers from the
content and knowledge view, many scenarios suggest a target
beyond universal application [6], which induces a much more
general understanding of containers.
For the required purposes the knowledge resources require
a set of features, especially facilities for multi-disciplinary
and multi-lingual knowledge and content. Content should be
kept consistent and easily accessible, e.g., in collections and
containers. One of the most desirable properties are long-term
facilities and long-term availability. Especially, the organisa-
tional units and objects need to carry conceptual knowledge,
e.g., in form of classiﬁcations.
III.
FUNDAMENTS AND PREVIOUS WORK
Many developments have contributed to the state-of-the-art
on knowledge processing and discovery. Also, many develop-
ments have provided new technical means to cope with the
new developments in computing architectures and services. In
the context of knowledge processing, discovery, and search we
are often faced with “prominent” examples like Internet search
engines, library search engines, specialised expert systems, and
maybe social media systems. If at all then there are some
interfaces, e.g., for automated requests or web-service creation.
The algorithms applicable to this kind of ‘art’ are very
limited and often not sufﬁcient in delivering a reasonable
quality for requested results or for following advanced goals.
Therefore, various concepts, developments, and approaches
have been created, addressing different aspects and special pur-
poses. Nevertheless, these tools, classiﬁcations, and algorithms
only try to handle the symptoms of the state of the data.
The approaches cover in-depth classiﬁcations and handling,
e.g., library classiﬁcation specialised on geological publications
[7], handling historical geographic resources, especially in
library context [8], and international patent classiﬁcation [9].
The algorithms touch processing and automation, e.g., statis-
tical models for online text classiﬁcation [10] and automation
with a classiﬁcation [11].
The discussions and analyses range from research aspects to
reliability and non-disciplinary approaches, e.g., classiﬁcation
as a research tool [12], reliability of diagnostic classiﬁcation
[13], and the Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation (UDC) [14] as a
non-disciplinary [15] universal [16] classiﬁcation system, and
legal and general aspects within Information Science, Security,
and Computing [17].
In depth, aspects of mapping, organisation and multi-lingual
data have been discussed, e.g., simple mapping between a
classiﬁcation and an “index” [18], simple conceptual methods
for using classiﬁcation in libraries [19], knowledge organi-
sation [20], multi-lingual lexical linked data cloud [21]. In
principle, any multi-disciplinary data resources may be used,
e.g., projects like Europeana [22], European Cultural Heritage
Online (ECHO) [23] or World Digital Library (WDL) [24].
Although these examples are focussed on providing special
information they lack in sufﬁcient content, organisation, and
structure.
The main motivation for this extended research was the
lack of multi-disciplinary data-centric approaches, which can
be used for long-term creation of knowledge and scalable
implementations. A major reason for the lack of data-centric
approaches for these purposes is the missing understanding of
value of data, which does not only manifest with data breaches.
Considering a possible data breach the analysis has shown an
even increased value of data within the last years [25].
With data-centric implementations this is also signiﬁcant for
quality steering [26], evaluation, and acceptance of information
systems [27]. In many cases the long-term data value of the
results is much higher than the funding value for creating the
data [2].
The data used here is based on the content and context from
the knowledge resources, provided by the LX Foundation Sci-
entiﬁc Resources [28]. The LX knowledge resources’ structure
and the classiﬁcation references [29] based on UDC [30] are
essential means for the processing workﬂows and evaluation
of the knowledge objects and containers. Both provide strong
multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual support.
For this part of the research all small unsorted excerpts of
the knowledge resources objects only refer to main UDC-
based classes, which for this part of the publication are
taken from the Multilingual Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation
Summary (UDCC Publication No. 088) [14] released by the
UDC Consortium under the Creative Commons Attribution
Share Alike 3.0 license [31] (ﬁrst release 2009, subsequent
update 2012).

case studies from the research conducted in the Knowledge
in Motion (KiM) long-term project [32] have contributed
to the application of UDC and different classiﬁcations and
concordance schemes in the context of knowledge resources.
The following term deﬁnitions for object, container, and
matrix can be helpful in this context.
•
An object is an entity of knowledge data being part
of knowledge resources. An object can contain any
documentation, references, and other data. Objects can
have an arbitrary number of sub-objects.
•
A container is a collection of knowledge objects in a
conjoint format.
•
A matrix is a subset of the entirety, the “universe”,
of knowledge. A workﬂow can consist of many sub-
workﬂows each of which can be based on an arbitrary
number of knowledge matrices. The output of any sub-
workﬂow or workﬂow can be seen as an intermediate or
ﬁnal result matrix.
The ﬂexible creation of objects carrying references, especially
classiﬁcation and concordances is the fundament for advanced.
knowledge processing and computing.
IV.
DATA-CENTRIC IMPLEMENTATION
In order to concentrate on the challenges of the data it-
self so-called data-centric, data-deﬁned, document-oriented or
document-centric approaches have been developed. This went
along with extending features like Structured Query Language
(SQL) and “Not only SQL” (NoSQL) [33], e.g., via MySQL
[34] and respective SQL [35] and MongoDB [36] and in
consequence [37] also in bridging relational and data- or
document-centric approaches [38]. Anyhow, implementations
like MongoDB, Docker, and CoreOS are technology-centric
components, e.g., they are mostly used for Web and application
development [39], [40], [41]. The very minimalistic “map”
and “reduce” functions approach of MapReduce [42], which
attracted many quick and simple solutions is a nice example
for building simple workﬂow elements.
As the knowledge resources’ approach [28] is even much
more general [29] it allows for arbitrary measures and also
for processing implementing map and reduce functions, which
can be based on the creation of objects and concordances.
Regarding a distributed computer system theoretical com-
puter science can state the CAP (Consistency, Availability,
Partition tolerance) theorem. In condensed form this means:
Consistency: All nodes see the same data at the same time,
Availability: A guarantee that every request receives a response
about whether it succeeded or failed, Partition tolerance: The
system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss
or failure of part of the system. Accordingly, learning from
decades of case-studies, regarding the long-term knowledge
and information sciences we can state a “CLU” theorem:
•
Consistency: All knowledge in context used is neither in
contradiction to other knowledge in context nor disac-
cording within its content,
•
Long-term sustainability: Data-centric architectures, the
core knowledge resources can be used for an arbitrary
number of different implementations,
•
Universal documentation: Documentation is supported
for any knowledge and data, e.g., factual, conceptual,
procedural, and metacognitive knowledge.
There is no direct reasonable equivalent for the P and A as-
pects. Besides the consistency, the items much more important
are the long-term sustainability and universal documentation
aspects. This includes the requirements for any type of knowl-
edge as well as its multi-lingual documentation and features.
V.
IMPLEMENTATION AND RESOURCES
The implementation for dynamical visualisation and com-
putation is based on the framework for the architecture for
documentation and development of advanced scientiﬁc com-
puting and multi-disciplinary knowledge [43].
The architecture implemented for an economical long-term
strategy is based on different development blocks. Figure 1
shows the three main columns: Application resources, knowl-
edge resources, and originary resources.

resources are the central component within the long-term architecture.
The central block in the “Collaboration house” framework
architecture [29], covers the knowledge resources, scientiﬁc
resources, databases, containers, and documentation (e.g., LX
[28], databases, containers, list resources). These can be based
on and refer to the originary resources and sources (photos,
scientiﬁc data, literature).
The knowledge resources are used as a universal component
for compute and storage workﬂows. Application resources and
components (Active Source, Active Map, local applications)
are implementations for analysing, utilising, and processing
data and making the information and knowledge accessible.

The related information, all data, and algorithm objects pre-
sented are copyright the author of this paper, LX Foundation
Scientiﬁc Resources [28], all rights reserved. The structure and
the classiﬁcation references based on the LX resources and
UDC, [44], especially mentioning the well structured editions
[14] and the multi-lingual features [45], are essential means
for the processing workﬂows and evaluation of the knowledge
objects and containers. Both provide strong multi-disciplinary
and multi-lingual support.
The three blocks are supported by services’ interfaces.
The interfaces interact with the physical resources, in the
local workspace, in the compute and storage resources the
knowledge resources are situated, and in the storage resources
for the originary resources.
All of these components do allow for advanced scientiﬁc
computing and data processing, as well as the access of
compute and storage resources via services interfaces. The
resources’ needs depend on the application scenarios to be
implemented for user groups.
A. Data-centricity
The architecture allows data-centric and computing-centric
implementations. In this case, the plan is the integration of
long-term creation of knowledge and scalable implementa-
tions, which motivates a data-centric approach.
The knowledge resources play the central role. With a
data-centric approach the properties of objects may inﬂuence
workﬂow decisions and code paths and logics may be deﬁned
through references, e.g., relations and constraints, optimising
the access of dynamical states of the data and minimising code.
Results and object stages can be stored with the data objects
and the computing can be done by reading and writing object
instances.
Therefore, the focus to provide facilities for advanced
discovery processes based on universal knowledge resources
is closely linked with data-centric classiﬁcation and concor-
dances.
B. Context for concordances and classiﬁcation
Knowledge resources, concordances, and classiﬁcation are
based on an organisation of knowledge. The underlying organ-
isation of knowledge is important for working with knowledge
dimensions and for creating computational views, which can
be used for advanced knowledge discovery and computing.
The available dimensions depend mostly on features and
complexity of the available data. Therefore, a number of
essential aspects have been considered when creating content
with the knowledge resources. Regarding the views many new
arrangements and visualisations are possible. Nevertheless, it
can be quite challenging for application developers to create
representations, which can be visualised, and to implement
suitable components. In many cases so called “Section Views”
can be computed, which use n-dimensional sections from
‘n+m’-dimensional knowledge context.
Views are supported by knowledge dimensions, meaning the
implementation of the types of knowledge, all of which can
be integrated in the workﬂows.
C. Implementation of knowledge dimensions
The implemented knowledge resources integrate factual,
conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge. Table I
shows the major types of knowledge as complementary parts of
the knowledge resources [46]. The table shows some practical
examples, which illustrate the beneﬁts of the integration.
The data itself is represented in knowledge objects contain-
ing any kind of information and collections, including content,
classiﬁcations, and references.

With the content and context documentation the knowledge
objects describe the integrated knowledge space, for which any
dimensions can be interconnected. Conceptual knowledge can
be expressed with classiﬁcations.
It is useful to support classiﬁcations in general, as there are
more than one classiﬁcation available and in practice. There-
fore, also concordances have a strong base in the conceptual
knowledge.
D. Section views
The implemented structure and content enable to create
section views based on the knowledge dimensions, which can,
e.g., be physical or contextual dimensions. Table II shows
some section views, which can be based on the combination
of contextual and factual knowledge.
Generators can access the knowledge resources and their
workﬂows can apply any appropriate components with their
references and algorithms, e.g., classiﬁcations, concordances,
phonetics [47], associations, references, keywords, and statis-
tics. There will always be different objects, e.g., for different
purposes and from different sources.

There is no need that such properties are available in all
available objects but it can vastly enrich the quality of content
and context if they are available. Therefore, the creation and
‘development’ of knowledge resources and objects is mostly a
dynamical process.
E. Creation of objects and conceptual knowledge
Practical creation of objects has shown to be most efﬁcient
when three different categories of creation are considered:
•
Manually created objects,
•
Hybrid (semi-automatically) created objects, and
•
Automatically created objects.
In any case creating objects is supported by universal classi-
ﬁcation, e.g., references to UDC. Therefore, that can also be
applied for the creating concordances with objects.

object excerpt from an object collection. The excerpt shows

The excerpt shows a representation of conceptual knowledge
for the container and various factual knowledge. The data
was collected and created semi-automatically over a period of
time. The conceptual knowledge is a matter of more detailed
discussion in the next subsections and sections.
The excerpts have been processed with the appropriate
lx_object_volcanology and lx_container_volcanology in-
terfaces, selecting a number of items and for the container also
items in English and German including a unique formatting.
The resources’ access and processing can be done in any
programming language, assuming that the interfaces are im-
plemented. For example, combining scripting, ﬁltering, and
parallel programming can provide ﬂexible approaches.
F. Creation of concordances
Many disciplines and large ﬁelds of application have devel-
oped and used individual adapted frameworks of conceptual
knowledge for their purposes. The reasons have been multifold,
in that cases either developing a universal approach was too
demanding or a distinction for certain reasons might have been
considered adequate. In many cases, various classiﬁcations
required to be “compared” and to be used together.
However, when developing content with conceptual knowl-
edge and classiﬁcations sooner or later also the individual
classiﬁcations get in the focus of development and may require
to be “mapped”.
In most cases, this can be done with the means of con-
cordances, for example, concordances with classiﬁcation in
medicine and health [48] or the creation concordances between
two classiﬁcations systems [49], in concordance projects like
coli-conc [50] or for beneﬁts in industry classiﬁcation systems
[51], [52]. Therefore, the organisation of the resources and
objects is signiﬁcant for the long-term aspects and the vitality
of the data.
Taking advantage of the modular architecture of the overall
resources (Figure 1) the main objectives are the knowledge
resources, services, and interfaces, which are deployed for
creating workﬂows. Figure 4 illustrates an excerpt of selected
knowledge resources’ objects. The selected objects are as-
sociated to collections and containers and contain references
to concordances and classiﬁcations. The excerpt in this case
shows a distinct handling of manually, hybrid, and automati-
cally created data.
The collection objects carry mostly only their individual
conceptual knowledge, as there are concordances and clas-
siﬁcation, for example. The container objects are commonly
similiar types of objects and structures where the container
can carry a respective commonly valid conceptual knowledge
for the container (symbolised in the ﬁgure by brick-structures
for the objects). The respective knowledge resource, on the
level integrating collections and resources, can also contain
a respective commonly valid conceptual knowledge for the
resource.
There are different ways of handling the processes for semi-
automatically and automatically created concordances. With
the main focus on processing and advanced computing we
concentrate of the object and references side of the resources.
This concept has shown vital beneﬁts, which enables im-
plementations with comparably high ﬂexibility. Disciplines,
services, and resources can be integrated in a very scalable
way. Practical creation of concordances has shown to be
most efﬁcient when three different categories of creation are
considered:
•
Manually created concordances,
•
Hybrid (semi-automatically) created concordances, and
•
Automatically created concordances.

from objects into a concordance instance. Hybrid-created-
concordances is a type of concordances, which has re-
sulted from a combination of manual and automated (semi-
automatically) processes.
The processes may work on primary concordances or on
any level of secondary data in order to support the creation
of concordances. Automatically-created-concordances is a type
of concordances, which have been generated, e.g., by an
automated workﬂow process. This is mostly done for big data,
which are used as quantity data and not due to their quality.
In any way, an integration with the knowledge resources’
references and structures is the target.
The workﬂows can contain several functions comparable to
the map and reduce concept. A map function ﬁnds the data
according to the criteria and creates a map result matrix. A
reduce function does the appropriate operation on the map
result matrix output.

The excerpt shows classiﬁcation concordances in several dif-
ferent classiﬁcations as used in different disciplines. Possibly
multiple views from different disciplines or author groups
on a certain object are not shown in this reduced view
but they can also hold the full spectrum of classiﬁcations
and concordances. The following listing (Figure 6) excerpts
classiﬁcation and concordances of a (volcanological features)
container (Figure 3).
The differences in classiﬁcation and concordances are re-
sulting from the different level of detail in the collections
and containers as well as in different potential of the various
classiﬁcation schemes to describe certain knowledge as can be
seen from the different depth of classiﬁcation.

Figure 6. Classiﬁcation and concordances excerpt of a simple container
instance (knowledge resources container).
In integration, together the concordances can create valuable
references in depth and width to complementary classiﬁcation
schemes and knowledge classiﬁed with different classiﬁcation.
The term concordance is not only used in the simple
traditional meaning. Instead, the organisation is that of a meta-
concordances concept. That results from the use of universal
meta-classiﬁcation, which in turn is used to classify and
integrate classiﬁcations [53].
The samples include simple classiﬁcations from UDC,
Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation (MSC) [54], Library of
Congress Classiﬁcation (LCC) [55], and Physics and As-
tronomy Classiﬁcation Scheme (PACS) [56]. For PACS the
asterisk (*) indicates entries from the “Acoustics Appendix /
Geophysics Appendix”.
The UCC entries contain several classiﬁcations. The UCC
blocks provide concordances across the classiﬁcation schemes.
The object classiﬁcation is associated with the items associated
with the object whereas the container classiﬁcation is associ-
ated with the container, which means it refers to all objects in
the containers.
VI.
DEFINITION AND ORGANISATION OF KNOWLEDGE:
CLASSIFICATIONS AND CONCORDANCES
Most content / context documentation and knowledge dis-
covery efforts are based on data and knowledge entities.
Knowledge is created from a subjective combination of dif-
ferent attainments, which are selected, compared and balanced
against each other, which are transformed, interpreted, and
used in reasoning, also to infer further knowledge. Therefore,
not all the knowledge can be explicitly formalised. Knowledge
and content are multi- and inter-disciplinary long-term targets
and values [57]. In practice, powerful and secure information
technology can support knowledge-based works and values.
Computing goes along with methodologies, technological
means, and devices applicable for universal automatic manip-
ulation and processing of data and information. Computing is
a practical tool and has well deﬁned purposes and goals.
A. Organisation of knowledge
Knowledge requires a universal organisation in order to
establish a practical long-term implementation for knowledge
objects, which can be ﬂexibly used for varying computing
requirements. The sketch of a two-dimensional representation
for the organisation of knowledge resources (Figure 7) shows

the structure of attributes and references as used for illustration
with this research.
The ﬁgure illustrates an excerpt of depth and width of
resources. These two-dimensional representation is based on
n-dimensional resources, which have no general limitations
regarding attributes and references.
The knowledge resources contain collections, containers,
and other forms of providing information and data.

Figure 7. Sketch of a two-dimensional representation for the organisation of
knowledge resources, showing an attributes/references structure.
A collection contains objects, which can widely differ,
e.g., regarding internal structure, content, and references. For
example, different references may be available, classiﬁcation
for objects being available or not. A container contains objects,
which can have a common structure and comparable content
and data, e.g., a mineral collection container or a volcanic
features database. From the conceptual knowledge point of
view, classiﬁcation for the objects in a container will be very
much the same.
From this point of view all knowledge objects will have
a number classiﬁcations, for the resources, for the collection
or container, for the object itself, for sub-objects, and prob-
ably references to object with classiﬁcations in the available
dimensions.
Therefore, in this example, in a two-dimensional represen-
tation a sub-object in an object, in a container, in knowledge
resources can have at least four classiﬁcations from the struc-
tural hierarchy.
B. Conceptual knowledge: Classiﬁcation and concordances
The object as described with the creation of concordances
is classiﬁed by use of one or more classiﬁcations. In this case,
the UCC concordance holds entries from UDC, MSC, LCC,
and PACS.
•
UDC
is
fully
integrating
the
object
in
a
multi-
disciplinary and multi-lingual context.
•
LCC is providing a comparable but much less multi-
lingual integration.
•
MSC is a mathematical and natural sciences classiﬁca-
tion but not providing much depth and details and in this
case neither covering volcanology nor archaeology.
•
PACS is a traditional classiﬁcation, which has been used
with physics and astronomy and natural sciences context.
In this case, it is signiﬁcant that archaeology is not
covered by PACS.
Table III shows the referred conceptual knowledge for an
object resulting from more than one classiﬁcations.

Not only that supporting multiple classiﬁcations can be
used to integrate resources from multiple sources, which
include different classiﬁcations. The spectra and focus of many
classiﬁcations are representing various views and disciplines.
Therefore, the use of “complementary” classiﬁcations leads
to a broader conceptual knowledge with the available content.
This is most interesting for multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual
knowledge.

VII.
CONTENT FACETS OF KNOWLEDGE
A. References and features
For most cases, practically usable knowledge is available
at the object level and deeper, e.g., in object elements. That
means, within any process available conceptual knowledge
can be considered appropriately, according to the respective
depths and views. Practically available collection and container
reference types from the above examples are, for example:
•
Categorisation,
•
Multi-lingual elements,
◦
Including multi-lingual objects,
◦
Including multi-lingual elements in elements of
other languages,
•
Sorting support,
•
Keywords,
•
Classiﬁcation,
•
Concordances,
•

•

Collections are mostly used for gathering individual objects
of any size and content. Containers can be used for keeping
objects of comparable thematical content and context. Exam-
ples are containers implemented for volcanic features, volcanic
eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and minerals.
B. Spanning multi-lingual content
Knowledge resources provide features to document any
part of knowledge, e.g., a knowledge resources collection,
container, object, or element of an object in any kind and
language.
This sounds much simpler than it is for complex knowledge
resources. A Latin entry can, e.g., contain documentation for
multiple audiences, e.g., English and German. The English
references can direct to German objects and vice versa. The
German documentation and the German objects can again
contain English terms or references. Any of these snippets of
language can, e.g., require to provide different views, clas-
siﬁcation, and formatting. With classiﬁcation the conceptual
knowledge can also provide classiﬁcation descriptions.
As can be seen from the descriptions, which are available in
many languages: It can be reasonable to have support tables,
e.g., synonym, variation, and transliteration lists for multi-
lingual descriptions.
C. Spanning classiﬁcations
Complementary to the fact that the objects are spanning
multi-lingual content is the feature that their conceptual knowl-
edge is also spanning different classiﬁcation and concordance
spaces.
Therefore, they are spanning different conceptual knowledge
views, which refer to their trees of knowledge. The comple-
mentary views also help improving the quality and robustness
of discovery processes based on data, especially long-term and
heterogeneous data [58]. Very ﬂexible and extendable trees are,
e.g., provided by the decimal architecture of UDC.
Although classiﬁcation can be used and created dynamically,
for many reasons most classiﬁcations are long-term conceptual
knowledge applied manually and explicitely, persistent to the
respective object. This may be met with applying editions
for the respective classiﬁcations. The result is the beneﬁt of
consistent and trackable classiﬁcation.
D. Application case: Components and cycles
The following example illustrates the components and work-
ﬂow cycles, especially related to collections and containers
including conceptual knowledge.
Table IV shows the speciﬁcations with the selected environ-
ment, major workﬂow steps with types of involved informa-
tion, and the result matrix. The start point for the discovery
was Vesuvius. The target was to discover 10 associated ancient
locations
The ranking relates to the respective resources, speciﬁca-
tions, and workﬂow. The ﬁrst matrix elements are more related
than the following. The resources and workﬂow components
also allow context associations. However, less related from
a primary discovery process can mean more related from a
secondary discovery process.
VIII.
KNOWLEDGE PROCESSING AND COMPUTING
The advanced processing of knowledge resources beneﬁts
from a signiﬁcant number of unique attributes in its elements.
These attributes can be references, classiﬁcation, keywords,
textual content, links, and many more. The elements can
consist of objects or collections of objects, the containers,
integrating factual data with object information and structure.
Workﬂows for creating arbitrary result matrices (Figure 8)
have been based on the organisation and object features
(Figure 4) in the knowledge resources.

Figure 8. Creation of intermediate result matrices from resources and refer-
ences (collections and containers) in reply to workﬂow requests.
The illustration shows that object information is gathered
from the objects and references in collections and containers.
Conﬁgurable algorithms like ﬁlters and mapping are then used
in order to compute a result matrix. Here, the result matrix is
considered “intermediate” because any of such workﬂows can
be used in combination with other workﬂows, workﬂow chains
or further processing.
For example, there is no “archaeology” in PACS, the
concordances refer to resources including “archaeology” via
some of the other schemes. MSC also does not contain a
classiﬁcation neither for volcanology or geology nor for asso-
ciated features. Instead, even the geophysics section classifying
geological problems refers to computational methods. The
above examples (Figures 5 and 6) also illustrate this. The
concordances’ blocks allow to bridge between classiﬁcations
and data resources, which can efﬁciently increase the available
data pool size. Common options are in-depth computation with
the container, or in-width with the general object collections.
The concordances’ blocks allow to follow in-depth or in-width
references within data resources, which efﬁciently supports
to improve the quality of result matrices and the quantity
of elements, which also impacts on scalability and efﬁciency
of workﬂows. Table V shows the shares of items regarding
processing and computing with the main steps at knowledge
resources, processing algorithms, and intermediate result ma-
trices for the Vesuvius / volcanology case (Figures 2–6).

The number of operations is based on subset of 100,000
collection and container objects from the knowledge resources,
which have been accessed for the study. The number of items
to be handled by the processing and computing for creating a
comparable or higher quality result matrix have been much
smaller in the major number of practical workﬂows when
classiﬁcation and concordances are included in the workﬂows.
Especially, the primary number of requests on the collections
and containers can be reduced. Consequently, the number of
algorithm calls is reduced. The number of string comparisons
and associated algorithms is most prominent here as the
majority of objects in the resources contain text.

Figure 9. Generated workﬂow parallelisation with PARA_Discover.
Every instance of this sample Portable Batch System (PBS)
script uses 16 compute nodes and 6 processors per node
in order to execute a para_discover call for maximum 60
minutes walltime. A regular run with the above values requires
about 5 minutes walltime per instance without and about 25
seconds with classiﬁcation and concordances. With four times
the nodes and cores we can handle about four times the subset
data.
However, it is important to choose a right knowledge
representation for universal long-term data. The Resource
Description Framework (RDF) [60] is a simple example for
representing Web data. In many cases, simple directed labeled
graphs are not sufﬁcient to represent knowledge. References
to directed labeled or other kinds of representations should be
possible.
The structure should provide an intuitive and ﬂexible access
to the data. There should be features for integrating any kind
of external data, e.g., objects, references, links, from structured
to unstructured data with the available data. The elementary
means of accessing the data should be independent from a
certain implementation or certain purpose. The integration,
interfaces, and interchange of data should be provided in
most sustainable ways. This means any kind of structure and
references and conceptual knowledge representation can be
integrated. For example, in case of Web data even RDF can
be deployed for Uniform Resource Identiﬁers (URI) naming
relationships between data at the “ends” of a link, which in
simple context enables to use graph analytics even on powerful
High End Computing resources.
IX.
EVALUATION
The section views were created over longer periods of
time while developing the knowledge resources, especially the
objects. The implementation of knowledge dimensions is a fun-
damental means, which is based on complementary knowledge,
especially factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive
knowledge.
Supporting more than one classiﬁcation allows to integrate
different sources and disciplinary views. This support can be
beneﬁcial for the discovery processes and the quality and value
of data. Concordances are based on the same classiﬁcation
methods. The integrated use of multiple classiﬁcations allows
to support a wider and deeper representation of conceptual
knowledge.
On the one hand, the wide range of references, which have
been implemented and can be extended arbitrarily, enables to
support any data and sources. On the other hand, spanning
multi-lingual content and spanning classiﬁcations allows to
document with many languages and even specialised concep-
tual knowledge and integrate multi-lingual content as well
as bridging areas of knowledge, which would be considered
‘dark’ in a single language or single classiﬁcation.
As shown, objects and containers can carry complementary
information and knowledge. The classiﬁcations and concor-
dances feature a fuzzy bridging between resources, which
allows modular in-depth as well as in-width workﬂows. In
addition to that, workﬂows can require strongly adaptive code
and algorithms. This may result in signiﬁcant variations of
runtime behaviour and resources’ requirements. The workﬂows
can integrate any objects for the processing, e.g., from collec-
tions and containers. These objects and their content may result
from manual to automated origin. For example, the spectrum of
creation includes use of classiﬁcation, keywords, text analysis,
and context analysis for the purpose of integration.
All the elements like classiﬁcation, concordances, and fac-
tual data can result from manual, hybrid, and automatic
processes. For example, Big Data [61] resources can be
automatically outﬁtted with classiﬁcations and concordances
following the container components. The level of details in
content, context, and structure is arbitrary and can be scaled
deﬁned by the focus of the creator of the respective data.
Therefore, associated conditions can be used in workﬂows for
weighting the types of processes and qualities involved.
In practice, during the processing and computing, the num-
bers of algorithm calls for requests on the collections and con-
tainers can be signiﬁcantly reduced with considering classiﬁca-
tion and concordances in workﬂows even when creating result
matrices of comparable or higher quality. There will always
be non-automated resources, which might be the knowledge
intensive ones. The knowledge review can also be supported
by distributed authorities as well as by means of automation.
Overall, classiﬁcations and concordances can easily be inte-
grated with application components and workﬂows and allow
an improved documentation for object along with additional
information for supporting discovery processes, which can,
e.g., be used for decision making and relevance considerations
within discovery processes.
X.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
With this extended research knowledge resources were cre-
ated, which integrate ﬂexible facilities for classiﬁcations and
concordances. The organisation of the knowledge resources
allows efﬁcient long-term references structures. Therefore,
the resources and objects can include any classiﬁcation and
concordances. Section views and knowledge dimensions have
proven to be of long-term beneﬁt for creating and developing
knowledge resources.
The support of multiple classiﬁcations and concordances
is a surplus value in many ways. The support advances
the integration of knowledge and the facilities for discovery
processes.
The types of objects and concordances shown in this paper
have been successfully created and further developed within

the knowledge resources. These results have also been in-
tegrated into the knowledge resources. The workﬂows for
creating the structures and the features for the advanced
processing and computing based on these resources have been
successfully implemented with in the last years. From this
research, we have learned some major results.
Experiences with the creation and development of objects
within the knowledge resources have resulted in the fact that
the data-centric approach neither conﬂicts with the long-term
aspects nor with the deployment of advanced processing and
computing features. This way, it should be possible to keep
knowledge persistent even under changes of technology and
paradigms.
The integration of objects, classiﬁcation, and concordances
has provided new means of documenting and accessing knowl-
edge as well as for the efﬁcient application of computational
means. The structure of the long-term multi-disciplinary and
multi-lingual knowledge resources’ components enables to
easily integrate objects from collections and containers. In
more depth the conceptual knowledge, e.g., the classiﬁcation
can improve the quality of the result matrices. It enables to
integrate more objects via strong means of knowledge instead
of statistics or pattern matching algorithms only.
The implementation of the concordances and workﬂows
has shown that the integrability of objects regarding multi-
disciplinary and multi-lingual aspects has improved. The in-
troduction of a universal classiﬁcation and concordances is an
excellent means of breaking up the isolated state of knowledge
resources’ content and associated data. In this context, creating
concordances mainly contribute in two ways. On the one hand,
concordances enable to considers different views of different
and even special disciplines with the knowledge processing.
On the other hand, concordances can be used to build bridges
between isolated data resources.
The ﬂexibility of the knowledge processing beneﬁts from the
advanced organisation of the data, which enables various scal-
able computational means for implementing directed graphs to
fuzzy links, for which High End Computing resources can be
deployed.
In summary, the wide range of implemented and arbitrarily
extendable references and spanning languages and classiﬁca-
tions enabled to improve documentation, integrability, and dis-
covery with any data and sources. Creation and development of
knowledge resources and knowledge discovery have beneﬁted
from classiﬁcations and concordances.
Future work will concentrate on advanced methodologies
for data description and analysis, which can be applied with
structured and unstructured knowledge objects and integrated
with classiﬁcations, concordances, and references.
