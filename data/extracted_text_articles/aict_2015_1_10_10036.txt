Abstract—Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
is the most commonly used multicarrier modulation in telecom-
munication systems due to the efﬁcient use of the frequency
resources and its robustness to multipath fading channels. How-
ever, as multicarrier signal in general, Peak-to-Average-Power
Ratio (PAPR) is one of the major drawbacks of OFDM signals.
Many works exist in the scientiﬁc literature on PAPR mitigation
such as clipping methods, Tone Reservation based approaches,
Partial Transmit Signals. However, in this paper we focus on
clipping methods. This last is one of the most efﬁcient adding
signal techniques for PAPR reduction in terms of complexity.
Nevertheless, clipping presents many drawbacks such as bit
error rate degradation, out-of-band emission and mean power
degradation. Adaptive clipping has been recently proposed in
order to decrease these drawbacks. However, this approach is
expensive in terms of numerical complexity, because an optimal
threshold should be found for each OFDM symbol. This paper
proposes a new approach to efﬁciently achieve the adaptive
clipping, in terms of iterations number to ﬁnd the optimal
threshold. Theoretical analysis and simulation results validate
the interest of this new clipping method.

INTRODUCTION
The Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is one of the
main issues of the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex
(OFDM) signal. Many works [1][2][3] exist in the literature
for PAPR mitigation. Clipping [4][5][6] method is an efﬁcient
technique for PAPR mitigation where the peak-canceling signal
is computed by clipping the amplitudes of the signal that
exceed a predeﬁned threshold A. In practice, a normalized
threshold ρ =
A2
Pxn is used, where Pxn represents the mean
power of the discrete signal xn whose PAPR has to be reduced.
It can be noted that, the normalized threshold deﬁnes the PAPR
below which the signal is not clipped.
Due the large amplitude variations of the OFDM sig-
nals in the time domain, the instantaneous PAPR of each
OFDM symbol highly depends on its content. Therefore, the
instantaneous PAPR after Classical Clipping(CC) method [4]
with a predeﬁned normalized threshold also depends on its
content. Then, the upper bounded PAPR of the clipped signal,
at each value of its Complementary Cumulative Distribution
Function (CCDF), increases when the CCDF decreases. This
is illustrated by the left curve in Figure 1. Note that this is also
the case for the original OFDM CCDF curve. That means there
is no deterministic upper bounded PAPR for CC method. It is
exactly what we target in this work. This deterministic value
corresponds to the vertical solid blue line depicted in Figure 1.
In practice, the suitable upper bounded PAPR of the signal

Clipping.
for the Input Back Off (IBO) deﬁnition on the High Power
Ampliﬁer (HPA) is in general chosen at CCDF(Φ) close to
zero (generally 10−4). In this paper, this value is called the
desired upper bounded PAPR and denoted as PAPR0). Thus,
in [7] the authors have shown that in CC techniques many
OFDM symbols are either severely clipped or unnecessarily
clipped with respect to this desired upper bounded PAPR. To
illustrate this assertion, let us consider Figure 2 which is a
zoom around 10−1 of the CCDF of the Figure 1. Note that
our main objective is to have a PAPR clipping output about
4.72 dB (the vertical blue line). Therefore, all the symbols
that have a PAPR value between 4.1 dB and 4.72 dB are
clipped unnecessarily (see ∆1 in ﬁgure 2). Besides this, all
the symbols whose PAPR values are between 4.72 dB and
8.4 dB are severally clipped by the CC technique compared
to ideal clipping (see indicated ∆2 in ﬁgure 2). If we extend
these considerations to all CCDF values, then we obtain the
two areas of Figure 3:

•
Area2: Symbols are clipped more severely than nec-
essary

clipped by CC.
To avoid this drawbacks, the authors have proposed an
Adaptive Clipping (AC) algorithm [7] in which the threshold
is adapted to the content of each OFDM symbol and the
desired upper bounded PAPR. Other adaptive clipping methods
exist in the literature [8][9]. In [9], the authors proposed to
adapt the normalized threshold ρ depending on the mapping
constellation of the OFDM signal for a better compromise
between PAPR reduction and BER degradation. In [8], the
authors proposed an iterative clipping and ﬁltering scheme
[10] in which the computation of the amplitude threshold A
from the predeﬁned normalized threshold, is done at each
iteration. This approach improves the performances on PAPR
reduction but degrades more the signal. In contrast, in [7],
the AC proposed approach and the classical clipping method
[4] achieve same performance in terms of PAPR reduction.
However, better bit error rate (BER), less out-of-band (OOB)
emission and less mean power degradation are achieved.
Nevertheless, the computational complexity of the proposed
algorithm is high. In fact, from a predeﬁned desired upper
bounded PAPR (PAPR0) and an initial normalized threshold
ρ0 = PAPR0, an exhaustive search is performed to ﬁnd the
optimal threshold. For this purpose, having a predeﬁned step
ϵ > 0, we check successively the values ρ0, ρ0 −ϵ,...,ρ0 −kϵ.
In this context, the number of iterations to ﬁnd the optimal
threshold ρ(opt) depends on the content of each OFDM symbol
and ϵ. In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient approach to
compute ρ(opt), which consists to adapt the step ϵ at each
iteration. This technique is equivalent to clipping the signal
iteratively by adapting A in function of PAPR0 and the content
of the clipped signal at the previous iteration. Therefore, we
named this approach as Iterative Adaptive Clipping (IAC).
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the prob-
lem formulation and AC principle will be brieﬂy presented. In
Section III, we will present IAC approach and show that IAC
method performs fewer iterations than AC approach to reach
ρ(opt). A comparative study in terms of signal degradation with
the classical clipping will then be conducted in Section IV. The
conclusions will be presented in Section V.

ADAPTIVE CLIPPING ANALYSIS PRINCIPLE
Throughout this paper an OFDM signal xn(t) is given by
the following equation
x(t) =
+∞
X
n=−∞
M−1
X
m=0
Xm,ng(t − nTu) ej2πmF t
(1)
where M means the total carriers, g is the window function
of duration Tu, F =
1
Tu is the intercarrier space, mF the mth
frequency, and Xm,n the symbol carried out by the mth carrier
at time nTu.
In this paper, if z denotes a vector containing the time
domain samples of the signal z(t) in continuous time domain,
its PAPR will be denoted by PAPRz. The positive scalar γe
will represent in this paper the upper bounded PAPR of the
signal at the CCDF value equal to 10−e (e constant), i.e.,
γe = max
Φ

CCDFyn(Φ) ≥ 10−e	
(2)
where CCDFyn(Φ) = Prob[PAPRyn ≥ Φ] and yn is the signal
after clipping. Let xn = [xn,0, . . . , xn,NL−1]T be the vector
containing the samples of the OFDM signal xn(t) oversampled
by a factor L. The PAPR of xn(t) can be approximated from
xn, as follows:
PAPRxn =
max
m=0,...,NL−1

|xn,m|2	
Pxn
(3)
where Pxn is the mean power of the xn signal before clipping.
The Classical Clipping (CC) proposed in [4] is one of the
most popular clipping technique for PAPR reduction known
in the literature. It is sometimes called hard clipping or soft
clipping. To avoid any confusion, the (CC) name will be used
in this paper. In [4], its effects on the performance of OFDM,
including the power spectral density, the PAPR and BER are
evaluated. The function-based clipping used for CC technique
is deﬁned as;
f (r, A) =
(
r,
r ≤ A
A,
r > A .

where A is the clipping threshold. From this equation, the
PAPR of the output signal yn after CC, if some samples of xn
are greater than the clipping threshold A, is given as follows:

Then, by substituting (11) in (5) the PAPR of the clipped
signal at the mth iteration satisﬁes the following expression:
PAPR[y(m)
n
] − PAPR0 = ϵm+1.
(12)
Therefore, if we deﬁne ϵm+1 ≤ δ as the criteria for stopping
IAC at the mth iteration, then, for each OFDM symbol the
PAPR of the output signal after PAPR reduction by IAC is
less than PAPR0 + δ. So, the CCDF curve of the IAC will
approach the ideal clipping and give the desired deterministic
upper bounded PAPR. The following Algorithm 1 describes
the IAC proposed technique.

For convergence speed comparison with AC, we can re-
mark that, at each iteration, AC and IAC algorithms have
almost the same numerical complexity. Therefore, convergence
speed comparison will be achieved by comparing the number
of iterations performed by these algorithms for each OFDM
symbol.
For each OFDM symbol xn and δ > 0, let Nxn,1, Nxn,2 be
the number of iterations performed by AC and IAC to converge
towards ρ(opt), respectively. So, ρ(opt) is approximated by
ρNxn,1 = PAPR0 − Nxn,1ϵ and ρNxn,2 = PAPR0 − PNxn,2
l=1
ϵl
in AC and IAC, respectively. Let’s deﬁne the average step for
the IAC as,
ϵxn =
1
Nxn,2
Nxn,2

l=1
ϵl.
(13)
Then, for each OFDM symbol xn, the number of iterations
performed by IAC to ﬁnd ρ(opt) is equal to the number of
iterations performed by AC when the step is equal to ϵxn. In
fact, from (6) the PAPR of the output signal at the mth in AC
with the step ϵxn can be expressed as follows
PAPR[y(m)
n
] = PAPR0 − mϵxn + 10Log10( Pxn

After few derivations and by using (13), we obtain

Therefore, since the number of iterations performed by IAC
to compute the normalized threshold for the OFDM symbol

which proves that, for each xn the number of iterations
performed by IAC is equal to the number of iterations
performed by AC in which the step is equal to ϵxn. Thus,
for each OFDM symbol, the comparison between Nxn,1 and
Nxn,2 can be achieved by comparing ϵxn and ϵ. However,
since xn is a random signal we will compare IAC and AC by
comparing the mean of number of iterations required for each
algorithms. This is equivalent to compare E [ϵxn] deﬁned in
(15) and ϵ (the constant step in AC) as,

over a great number of K OFDM symbols.

In [7], in order to obtain the desired upper bounded PAPR
equal to PAPR0 + δ, the step ϵ must be chosen less or equal
to δ. It is clear that the number of iterations increases when ϵ
decreases. Thus, the optimal step in AC is ϵ = δ. From (17)
and the fact that in IAC ϵm > ϵ if m < Nxn,2, IAC converges
more quickly than AC if ϵ1 ≥ ϵ. Therefore, from (9) we can
deduce that, for each PAPR0 N1 ≥ N2 if and only if

SIMULATION RESULTS
The performance of the proposed IAC and the CC method
are analyzed under same PAPR reduction, i.e., PAPR0 = γ4−δ,
and compared in terms of signal degradation and convergence
speed. The simulations are performed for an OFDM signal

with 16-QAM modulation in which M = 64, an oversampling
factor L = 4.
Figure 5 conﬁrms that the CCDF curves of the IAC
approximate the ideal clipping CCDF curve. Beisdes, the IAC
and CC method achieve the same upper bounded PAPR value
at CCDF equal to 10−4. It can be also noticed from depicted
results, that IAC method reach a deterministic upper bounded
PAPR.

thresholds ρ1 = 3.5dB and ρ2 = 5dB
In the following, the IAC is compared with CC in terms
of BER degradation.
Figure 6. Comparison of CC and IAC in terms of BER degradation for
ρ = 3.5dB.
Results depicted in Figure 6 show that IAC outperforms CC
in terms of BER degradation. The obtained gain at 10−4 of
BER, is greater than 1 dB. This result conﬁrms the theoretical
analysis undertaken in [7] where the authors have shown that
in CC many OFDM symbols are clipped more severely (see
AREA 2 in Figure 3) than necessary or unnecessarily (see
AREA 1 in Figure 3) with respect to γ4.
The performances in terms of Mean Power degradation and
adjacent channels pollution which is due to the effect of the
OOB components, are depicted in Figure 7.
Figure 7. Comparison of CC and IAC in terms of Mean Power degradation
for ρ = 3.5dB and a PAPR at CCDF 10−4
.
From the simulation results depicted in Figure (7), it can be
noticed that IAC degrades less the Mean Power of the clipped
signal than the CC for the same PAPR performance reduction
at a CCDF ≤ 10−4. For example, for γ4 = 4.72dB, ∆E =
−0.47dB in CC method and ∆E = −0.25dB in proposed IAC
approach.
Figure (8) represents the Power Spectrum Density (PSD)
of both OFDM signal before PAPR reduction and after PAPR
reduction by IAC and CC respectively.

ρ = 3.5dB
Similar as in Figure 7, for BER degradation and mean
power variation, Figure 8 shows that IAC pollutes less the
adjacent channels than CC when PAPR0 = γ4 − ϵ.
As a general conclusion, obtained results in terms of
signal degradation conﬁrm that when PAPR0 = γ4 − ϵ, IAC

degrades less the signal than CC method (see Figure 6, 7, 8).
In the following, we compare N1 and N2 deﬁned by
Figure 9. Mean of number of iterations performed by IAC and AC for each

equation (16) by simulation with K = 104 . Figure 9 shows
that IAC method converges more quickly than AC method,
for instance, when γ4 = 3dB, and N1 ≃ 4N2.
Obtained results conﬁrms our theoretical analysis undertaken
in Section III (see equation (18)). In fact, from Figure (9),
it can be remarked that N1 ≥ N2 when γ4 ≤ 6 which

CONCLUSION
In this paper, a new method for approximating the normal-
ized adapted threshold for the adaptive clipping is presented.
The theoretical analysis and simulation results achieved in this
paper show that this approach converges more quickly than the
one based on exhaustive research with a constant step. This
approach outperforms also CC in terms of signal degradation,
with the same performances in terms PAPR reduction. Fur-
thermore, IAC gives a deterministic desired upper bounded
PAPR which is very important for IBO deﬁnition on high
power ampliﬁers (HPA). Our future work will focus on the
extension of proposed work to other clipping functions as deep
clipping and smooth clipping combined with Out Of Band
noise suppression approcahes.
