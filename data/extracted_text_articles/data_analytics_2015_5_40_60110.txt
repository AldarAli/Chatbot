Abstract— In this paper, an oscillatory model is proposed to 
provide the necessary period of time for the analysis of a 
system’s data in order to reduce its attrition. The actual system 
was assumed to be a periodic complex dynamical system, since 
it deals with the human-machine daily routine activity. 
Typically, in the real life, is the maintenance developed by the 
employees in the industry. The model presented is suitable for 
the simulation of the periodicity of the reliability of the studied 
system, as well as prediction. Then, two types of models are 
considered: the first one is associated only with the 
degradation process of the system, while the second one is also 
associated with the periodic remedying process along the 
employees production time, from which the lifespan is 
extended.

which is associated with the degeneration of a studied 
system. This concept is frequently used in both general and 
specific literature, as in [1]-[2]. The parameter is adopted 
to be the rate of system’s faults, t is the arbitrary time of 
reliability, 
 

C
is the reliability, while 
X ()
is the 
attrition as a function of time. However, in addition to these 
results of the applications, a slaving procedure is implied by 
(1). This is due to the fact that it is always necessary to 
process the whole system’s data (system or complex 
system) before emergent real time problems and attrition’s 
values affect the system’s operation. Consequently, it was 
necessary to fix the system’s faults to continue its operation. 
The remedy system starts working again until the new 
emergent problems appear and affect the operation, see [3]-
[5]. This cycle is repeated ad infinitum. Since the attrition is 
a cumulative process, a new time dependent function 
   t
replaces the original parameter  . Consequently, 
this is to be done in (1). In this case, the analyst must reset 
the observation at every period of time, which demands a lot 
of attention and effort, even when using a computer. This is 
due to the fact that the data must be updated at every cycle. 
The key for this work remains in the assumption that the 
system has oscillatory motion. This behavior seems a 
damped mass-spring response, as in [6]. In this context, it is 
assumed that the system includes humans and machines 
together. This is also to say that the system stores and loses 
energy, and also has inertia. Moreover, an appropriate 
damping implies oscillatory behavior and periodicity. The 
first objective of this work was to predict the system 
reliability’s evolution through a feedback loop based on the 
model proposed in [3]-[5], but here the function 
 t
is 
presented in such a fashion that generates a damped mass-
spring periodic model. This dynamical model is likely to 
that developed in [6], but here it is being necessary only the 
lineal approximation. The second objective was to save 
administrative time and resources during the system’s 
operation control by applying the generated dynamical 
damped mass-spring periodic model in obtaining the period 
of the system. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 
I, a brief state of the art and some introductory remarks are 
presented. In Section II, some developments associated with 
the process of data processing intervals of self-degenerative 
systems are described. Finally, in Section III, a set of 
conclusions is provided. 
 
II. 
DATA PROCESSING INTERVALS FOR A SELF-
DEGENERATIVE DYNAMICAL SYSTEM 
Let us consider systems with inertial, spring and dissipative 
forces, as in [6].  Note that fewer forces than these three are 
qualitatively and quantitatively far from representing the 
real situation, whatever kind of dynamical system is 
considered. Here, a balance between the machines 
production and the human counterpart restoration to operate 
them is proposed. A typical dynamic equation is

fonts  and W represent parameters or functions of the 
system respectively, and X is the unknown variable. Since

the human contribution to the system may be adopted in 
order to always follow (2), then  W  must be zero.  Although 
an external and actual agent is needed in this oscillatory 
process to operate the machines, its contribution does not 
exist in the right member of (2), effectively. So, (2) is 
derived homogeneous with
W  0
. In this context, the most 
relevant fact to point out is the assumption that X  is a 
global, non-deterministic, and abstract property of the 
system. For instance, this property could be the 
degeneration, or the attrition,
 
X  X 
, of the system, and 
obeys (2). This equation is differential, linear, ordinary, 
second order and, in general, variable coefficients. 
Moreover, (2), when used, can model the linear asymmetric 
interaction due to self-degeneration with a sort of “null 
natural frequency” (
W  0
). So, we have the equation

, agrees with the degeneration of the 
system obtained from the field of statistical analysis by 
applying the Poisson distribution as frequently reported in 
the literature, see [1]-[2]. The parameter was adopted to be 
the rate of faults per unit of time, while 
X ()
was the 
attrition as a function of time.  
The following sequence of steps to define a new procedure 
was developed: 
 
 
The system’s model suffers a change from 
stochastic to deterministic after it has been proof 
that the stochastic model also obeys (3), which is 
valid for a dynamical system like (2), together with 
W  0
.  
 
Then, a periodic behavior is introduced by 
updating the system’s dynamical law from (3) to 
(2) by including energy storage capability
W  0
.  
The negative feedback control-loop (human control 
or machine control) acts as a spring and generates 
this behavior. 
 
Now, by considering 
W  0
, and
 ()
 in (1), 
and by using 
C  C()
 in (1) and (2), and also 
considering explicitly the “forced” human activity 
as

Once the time period is generated, the automatic 
process for resetting the data intervals is 
implemented: 
o 
by measuring on site the system’s 
parameters (or functions)  , W ,  and 
then by scaling the model and processing 
the macro-data.

reliability

, and then for the attrition 
 
X 
. Then, the response of X over time is 
obtained and a superior limit for attrition 
is adopted. 
 
Finally, it is also useful to apply both the Poisson 
distribution and the reliability definition repetitively at each 
time period, in order to allow the response to be obtained 
over time for a statistical tool. Therefore, a comparison 
should be made to calibrate both responses (dynamical and 
statistical).  
III. 
CONCLUSIONS 
      A procedure for setting the data processing intervals for 
analysis of self-degenerative systems was given as an 
external support. A new tool is proposed: 
o 
by avoiding the data lecture at each time 
period.  
o 
by 
connecting 
theoretically 
and 
experimentally the Poisson distribution 
with the parameters and response of a 
dynamical system. 
      The tool developed was based on physical laws and will 
be applied to the fields of health care, economy and politics, 
as well as to other social sciences. This tool advises the 
operator which parameters should be changed in the actual 
dynamical system in order to obtain the desired response 
over time.
