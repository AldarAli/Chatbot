Abstract—Technological improvements and access provide a
fertile scenario for the creation and development of mobile
applications. This scenario of intense production of new
software for mobile devices results in a myriad of apps
providing information about almost all the cultural segments,
including those dedicated to UNESCO World Heritage Sites
(WHS). However, not all of the apps have the same efficiency.
In order to have a successful app, its development must
consider usability aspects aligned with reliable content. Despite
the guidelines for mobile usability being broadly available,
they are generic, and none of them concentrates specifically in
cultural heritage. This article aims to fulfil this literature gap
and discusses how to develop specific guidelines for a better
WHS experience. It uses an empirical approach applied to an
open-air WHS city: Weimar and its Bauhaus and Classical
Weimar sites. To build the guidelines, this research compared
literature-based guidelines to industry-based ones, extracted
from a vast compendium of available apps dedicated to WHS.
The instructions compiled from both sources have been
comparatively tested by using two built prototypes from the
distinctive guidelines.
Keywords – Interface design; world heritage sites; usability;
app; mobile devices.
I.
INTRODUCTION
It is far behind the time when, in order to enjoy a
historical and cultural experience, it was necessary to visit a
museum or to buy a guide to check the information about
the monuments and historical buildings in a city. Despite the
importance of these institutions and tools, the technology
allows the expansion of the concept one step further,
transforming cities themselves in open-air museums, by
using mobile apps accessible through smartphones that most
people carry in their pockets. They can be used to converge
information and recreate the museum experience in open-air
spaces.
However, to make this experience effective, the apps
must follow a particular set of rules, or they can end up
influencing the tourism experience negatively by causing
frustration when the user tries to retrieve the desired
information. To make this experience enjoyable for the user,
it is advised to follow guidelines and good practices during
the development of an app for touristic purposes. This study
goes beyond the touristic aspects and helps to define
guidelines that are appropriately applied for WHS scenarios.
This research considered a vast range of usability studies and
explored the interactions between users and urban spaces. It
also includes precise niche requirements for the chosen
scenario such as usability applied to elderly groups, as they
are an important target group for tourism in Germany.
From a content perspective, it is valid to mention the
preparedness of UNESCO WHS. Every recognised site has a
vast range of official information available, aiming for
different
audiences.
For
example,
it
is
easy
to
find
educational content, ready to be used inside classrooms. For
this study, the set of available material related to heritage
locations is defined as target content, and some of the
discussions explore how it is possible to make it accessible
and tailored for mobile devices.
It is necessary to say that, despite the popularity of
mobile gadgets, the target content does not contemplate
guidelines or suggestions for digital applications. It will be
explored in Section II. The same section also shows why
Germany is relevant as a scenario to develop guidelines for
WHS apps, that can have an international application. The
research uses a mixed-method approach to suggest the
guidelines. It started with the analysis of apps available in
the industry through a classification based on affordances
[1], identifying features, elements and their use in the mobile
application, as detailed in Section III. The analysis revealed
one set of guidelines used to create one of the prototypes.
Section IV shows how a systematic literature review was
used to identify the available articles discussing the topic
and, by analysing the content, to extract another set of
guidelines used in a second prototype. After the compilation,
each one of the guidelines was used to develop their own
mobile app prototype, and both prototypes were submitted to
a
comparative
A/B
test.
Section
V
deals
with
the
implementation of the two prototypes and also with the
evaluation
process,
comparing
the
results
from
both
developed
prototypes.
In
Section
VI,
the
evaluation,
implementation and results are discussed. In Section VII, a
new set of recommended guidelines emerges, considering
the evaluation results.

TARGET CONTENT
The focus of this research is on apps that deal with
cultural heritage content. Germany is the 5th largest country
with of “World Heritage Sites” from the UNESCO’s list [2].
The country has 43 cultural sites spread across its territory.
From those sites, two of them (Bauhaus and its Sites in
Weimar and Dessau; and Classical Weimar) are situated in
Weimar - a place where this research is based. These sites
are easily accessible, being a perfect sample opportunity for
in loco use. There is a vast amount of target content
available for the two sites mentioned. It means the
information was retrieved directly from official sources to
build the two prototypes. By doing so, the test was
concentrated on verifying the features, functionalities, and
on different ways to display similar information on the app.
Also, Germany is well known for its technological
potential. This scenario reflects on services using a digital
format,
available
for
different
purposes,
such
as
information, education, entertainment, just to mention a few,
applied to multiple devices, such as mobile devices, web-
based services, and interactive screens.
Taking Germany as a scenario for the empirical approach
is a fair way to gain experience and access for innovative
projects using mobile devices for cultural heritage.
III.
INDUSTRY BASED GUIDELINES
There are many smartphones and
tablets’ models
available on the market, with different features but also
constraints. The iOS or Android OS together have more
than 3 million published apps, embracing 80% of the
German
mobile
market
share.
For
that
reason,
the
prototypes were developed using a platform that could be
accessed by both OS: iOS and Android operating systems.
For the same reason, the apps to be evaluated were retrieved
from both official stores following the same criteria.
To retrieve the apps from each selected OS markets, a
search string was applied, using the following combination
of words:
1.
UNESCO WHS in Germany
2.
Official app market
3.
Word search options:

UNESCO Germany

UNESCO Deutschland

World Heritage

Welterbe (World Heritage in German)

The name of the WHS for Germany, in
English and German versions
4. When the WHS refers to “Old Town” or “Parks” of
a city, the used search term is “City Name” +
UNESCO
5. Dedicated WHS apps
In this work, a dedicated WHS app defines an app specially
made for the WHS attraction. Generic touristic apps, on the
other hand, usually cover multiple touristic attractions and
not only the WHS site; the only exception is when the city
centre (usually called as old town, inside the WHS context)
is considered a WHS itself. In this case, a generic city
touristic app may enter in the list, if in its home screen there
is an indication of UNESCO or WHS. Following these
search criteria, 29 apps dedicated to German WHS sites
were retrieved by 25 July 2018.
Other apps were found following the beforementioned
search criteria, but they did not offer specific WHS-related
content and, therefore, were excluded from the analysis. In
some cases, they were clickbait apps, using the WHS
identification to encourage the users to download it, but
promoting other sorts of content, such as touristic tours or
purchase-in app features. In other cases, sweb-based apps
had problems to load the pages. As they were not fully
functional – thus not trustworthy to generate guidelines –
they were also excluded from the final sample.
The final sample also included generic touristic apps
where it was possible to find specific WHS information,
despite this not being shown on their home screen. In these
cases, it means one needs to go further into the app to
discover if a WHS is mentioned or not.
A. WHS App Analysis
The selected apps were analysed and classified from an
affordance perspective, observing their properties and usage
from a user perspective. This enabled the identification of
common features and tools used for the promotion of a
WHS. It also allowed identifying unique features and the
ones that could be part of the guidelines to build the
prototype. The analysis extracted guidelines from layout,
navigation, design, and content perspectives. From that, a
WHS prototype app was built based on the state of the art
observed in the industry (Table I).
The app affordances were analysed from the user
perspective, by using the individual expert review technique,
in which
“an individual expert review involves a single
practitioner who is asked to provide feedback on the
usability of a UI.” [2, p. 37].
After being mapped, the
content was distributed under subcategories, adapted from a
study about usability guidelines for mobile websites and
applications [3], taking into consideration just the app
functionalities. This approach allowed the identification of
the usability guidelines, plus mapping the visual and content
structure from the official apps for WHS in Germany.
B. Industry Overview Guidelines
The industry/market analysis of the available apps for
WHS in Germany revealed a set of guidelines used to build
a market-based prototype with the most common features
and layout, creating an average model to be tested against a
literature-review-based one (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Schematics on the creation of the industry-based guidelines
The prototype following the industry-based guidelines
combined the most popular elements presented on the
evaluated apps, taking in consideration layout, navigation,
design, content style, features and media. The guidelines
considered only those elements that appeared in more than
50% of the apps (Table I). The guideline also followed the
most prominent qualitative features in regards to elements
that cannot be quantified, such as colour, layout disposition,
etc.

It is possible to point that, based on the sample, an
average app based on what the industry is offering, would
have the following characteristics:
1)
Layout
•
The content is spread beyond the initial screen,
creating vertical scrolling (L2).
•
The layout structure will be maintained across the
sections (L4).
2)
Navigation
•
The number of taps to achieve a WHS content from
the initial screen is two (N1).
•
The number of items in the main menu would vary
from four to six (N2).
•
The navigation menu is always visible among the
sections (N3).
•
The content will be spread in different levels,
leaving the user to explore further in each section
(N5).
•
The main menu is self-explanatory, with direct
meaning sections (N6).
3)
Design
•
The use of colours is limited up to three (D1).
•
The design is clean and not polluted (D2).
•
The use of an icon reinforces the menu and content
is present (D5).
4)
Content
•
The content utilises long text, usually more than
two paragraphs (C1).
•
No need for introductory or explanation text on the
initial screen (C4).
•
The prevention of content loss when backing from
a section is ensured (C5).
5)
Features and Media
•
Use photo/illustration along with the text, to
reinforce the content (F1).
•
Providing GPS or static versions (F3, F4).
These guidelines were used to build the structure and
layout of the market-based prototype and how its content
was organised. The content was elaborated addressing the
WHS in Weimar, retrieving target content available at the
official touristic site of the city [4], and from the largest
cultural foundation from Weimar [5].
IV.
GUIDELINES FROM LITERATURE-REVIEW
This section covers the creation of the second set of
guidelines for WHS apps, based on the literature review, to
be compared with the app guidelines extracted from the
market overview.
While the guidelines from the app market overview took
an
observational
approach
of
affordances,
aiming
to
generate a model that could represent the average content
style and features present on the available WHS apps for
Germany, the guidelines acquired from the literature review
took into consideration a systematic approach to the
144

ACHI 2020 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

academic articles. The literature-based guidelines were
extracted from publications about mobile app usability,
available
on
research
databases.
It
also
took
into
consideration existing usability models [6] - [10], and
official guidelines for mobile development from the leading
mobile OS companies (iOS and Android).
The generated guidelines took into consideration studies
from the academia and the industry recommendations,
connecting and combining different views and approaches
on mobile interface design guidelines applied for WHS
(Figure 2).
The systematic literature review took into consideration
the guidelines from the mobile industry, with an added layer
of confirmed guidelines on studies of mobile apps retrieved
from academic publications, on platforms, such as: ACM
[11], IEEE [12], JSTOR [13], SAGE [14], and Google
Scholar [15].
Figure 2.
Schematics on the creation of the literature-based guidelines
In order to find academic studies and research outcomes
that can contribute to the formation of literature-review
guidelines for mobile apps dealing with cultural places, a set
of search parameters were applied:
Search Strings:

“Mobile usability” AND “Guidelines”

“Mobile usability” AND “App”

“Mobile usability” AND “Heritage”

“Mobile usability” AND “Travel Guide”

“Mobile usability” AND “City Guide”

“App guidelines”

“Mobile interface guidelines”

Published material since 2013, covering five years
of publication, considered enough for a literature
review [16, p. 53].
The first 50 results in each search string on each
platform were sorted by relevance and initially analysed
based
on
their
abstract/description
to
be selected
or
discarded for content analysis.
A. Selected papers
The aim of the reading selection from the literature
review
was
to
find
guidelines
and
interface
recommendations for mobile devices to build a literature-
based prototype to be tested in comparison with the market-
based one. With this goal in mind, studies done on mobile
web sites were included, as they address the interface design
on mobile screens. Medical and health studies were included
just when they addressed mobile interface design and
usability, and not therapeutic issues.
Also, studies covering mobile interaction with public
spaces were included, as the prototype app will deal with
interaction in the city centre of Weimar. The same applies
for context-aware and location-based mobile interactions.
Taking into consideration the wide range of profiles of
the Weimar’s visitors, the selection also included studies on
mobile interface for elderly users. Although the guidelines
are not focused on educational features, studies on mobile
learning were also included, as long as the interface was the
research target. This decision was made because the city of
Weimar also deals with teenager students visiting and
learning about the heritage attractions of the city.
Overall,
the
analysis
was
concentrated
on
direct
instructions that could be translated into guidelines. Vague
recommendations, such as “create an appealing design”
were not considered for being too open for different
interpretations.
Based
on
their
titles
and
abstract,
249
academic
publications
on
mobile
usability
and
mobile
cultural
heritage were selected, where only thirteen were not
accessible
due
subscription
and/or
accessibility
issues
(despite five of them providing a two-pages preview),
totalling a 5.2% rate of waste in the original selection,
making the final number of selected academic works for
reading equal to 236 publications.
The selected readings, apart from those dealing with app
interface and usability, dealt with topics such as cultural
heritage, mobile tourism, mobile health, mobile learning,
older adults, just to mention a few examples. Based on the
readings’ keywords (when available), a word cloud was
generated to illustrate the full range of selected topics
(Figure 3).
Figure 3.
Word cloud generated from the used keywords from the reading
selection.
It can be seen in the word-cloud that the keyword
cultural heritage does not have the same weight as usability
or even app, for instance. As said, the word cloud was based
on the keywords defined by the authors, and it reflects the
lack of studies that are specifically dedicated to the relation
145

ACHI 2020 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

between apps and WHS, compared to those related to
generic apps.
Each one of the selected publications was read and
analysed to find and extract guidelines that could be used
for cultural heritage apps. However, the analysis was not
restricted to the selection list and was extrapolated, taking in
consideration relevant references cited by the publications
selected for the sample.
As a procedure, when a guideline or recommendation
was found, it was placed in a table following a similar
structure as the guidelines extracted from the app-market-
overview, adding new categories to correspond to the
literature review findings. Overall, the literature-review
based guidelines reinforced some and challenged other
guidelines found on the industry-oriented overview, creating
a new set of guidelines to be tested against the first
prototype.
When a conflicting guideline was found (for instance:
one author claiming that text should be long and another
that it should be short), the one supported by the majority
(more than one author endorsing it) was selected; in case of
a tie (equal sum of authors supporting opposite views), an
expert-based overview technique was implemented to select
which one would be selected from the literature-review
guidelines list, based on how closely related it was to the
research topic.
The guidelines found during the analysis are shown in
Table II, using the common ones with the market-based
selection
with
the
addition
of
new
literature-based
guidelines, distinguished with an asterisk (*) mark. It is
possible to note that the literature-based guidelines have
similar items with the market-based ones, but with more
detailed orientations regarding the content.

The use of maps is one of the features that was not
detailed in the literature-based guidelines. From the market-
based research, the recommendation is to offer an offline
map along with the GPS one. Still, such orientation was not
confirmed by the literature, leaving this specific feature
open and, as a consequence, allowing to test original ideas.

For the Augmented Reality (AR) feature, most of the
selected studies addressed issues on using this technology,
but just a few of them recommended it for a mobile
application. Here, it is believed that AR can be indeed an
appealing feature for a mobile app, but using such an
environment
demands
an
exclusive
and
sophisticated
development which is not the purpose of this research.
Overall, when comparing both guidelines sets (Table
III), it was possible to identify unique guidelines in each
one, enabling the idea of an A/B test comparing a prototype
based in each set of guidelines.
Despite the complexity and extension of the guidelines,
some critical elements were not clearly identified in any
guideline. However, the relevance requires them to be
implemented and compared in the prototypes:
•
Content: List vs Grid content
List is when the options are listed in a (generaly)
vertical sequence. Grid presents the content in a tile
format, generally in square shape.
•
Map: icons
Displaying one map with generic pin icon, and
others with personalised icons (according to
content categories).
•
Map: marker information
When tapping/clicking on a pin on a map, the
information may be displayed in the bottom of the
screen, or as a centred floating banner.
The use of two different subtle prototypes created an
opportunity to test other features, such those mentioned
above, along with dedicated WHS content.
V.
GUIDELINES INTO PROTOTYPES
Two prototypes were created, each one based on one set
of guidelines built beforehand (industry and literature-
review based). At this stage, considering the need to follow
the guidelines as close as possible, the decision was made
not to involve users during the design process, but to rely on
an
expert
review
approach
[2,
p.
37],
leaving
the
involvement of users for later, when comparing and
evaluating the prototypes.
To enable the comparative A/B test, two prototypes were
developed:
•
Prototype Red (Figure 4): industry-based
guidelines, available at [53].
•
Prototype Blue (Figure 5): literature-review based
guidelines, available at [54].
The reason for calling the two prototypes “Red” and
“Blue” was to set a neutral impression for the users/testers,
not revealing their nature (industry or literature-review),
neither their chronological development using letters, such
as “A” and “B” – which could lead to the impression of “A”
being the first version, and “B” a second-and-updated
version. The chosen set of colours (red and blue) was also
implemented to avoid conflict for possible colour-blind
testers.
Figure 4.
Prototype Red, with less content on the main menu, bigger tiles
for pages and standard map icons.
Figure 5.
Prototype Blue, with more items on the main menu, detailed
tiles for pages and customised icons for the map.
VI.
EVALUATION
In order to compare the two prototypes based on
different guidelines, a task-based test and a comparative
evaluation survey were implemented. The idea behind this
approach is having different individuals performing a series
of pre-defined tasks in both prototypes and answering a
147

ACHI 2020 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

series
of
questions
comparing
features
and
formats
presented in both versions.
Questionnaires are a well-known method to collect and
summarise evidences [55] [56, p. 100], also helping to
collect opinions and input from the users. They are efficient
for a wide range of data collection, such as usability, user
satisfaction and interface design [57, p. 30].
The questionnaire used in this work had a set of pre-
defined answers to be chosen by the users, ideal to statistics,
especially on user satisfaction [58]. It also offered open-
ended questions to allow the testers to give personal inputs.
This method was crucial to compare and analyse both sets
of guidelines (industry vs literature-review) against each
other and to extract an ideal set of guidelines for apps
dealing with open-air world heritage sites.
A. Evaluation process
A
questionnaire
can
be
divided
into
four
parts:
introduction, participant information, information section
and epilogue [57]. In the introduction, it is crucial to give
general information about the test, carefully preventing it
from producing a biased result. In this case, it explained that
the test was meant to compare two different models of
interface design. Within this context, the testers had an
indication of the upcoming content of the test/questionnaire,
but no other details regarding the origins or the differences
between the prototypes were provided.
As
participant
information,
the
gender
role
was
discarded on purpose as it was irrelevant for this study. The
relevant information to understand the profiles were: age,
which could be later related to the different groups of
visitors; familiarity (or not) with the city of Weimar,
showing if the results would change if a tester knows the
locations or not; and the behaviour related to the use of
apps, especially for travel and touristic activities, and the
level of expertise in using them.
The selection of testers/participants aimed to find two
different groups: people who knew the city of Weimar
beforehand, and people who have never been in the city.
The age groups had a wide range spread, going from the
early ’20s to
late
’40s.
The differences brought an
interesting perspective on how familiar the users were with
the
locations,
and
which
features
were
prefered
by
individuals of certain group age. For this test, academics,
students and professionals from a diverse set of areas of
expertise were invited.
It is argued that even a modest number of five
participants is enough to perform a usability test [59] [60],
getting the necessary feedback to find usability problems
when compared with a setting using a larger amount of
testers. For the test, 35 participants confirmed the interest in
performing the evaluation, with a final attendance of 30
participants.
B. Test settings
After
designing
the
evaluation,
an
unmonitored
/
unmoderated setting was selected for the users to perform
the tasks in an online evaluation. The unmonitored setting
for assessments is not new in computer science [61].
Unmoderated tests can be perfectly applied for testing
prototypes [62], and they bring a series of advantages by
increasing the measurement precision [63]; no restriction of
time [64] [65]; and simultaneous participation [61]. Also,
unmonitored tests have a set of advantages in comparison to
the monitored ones, which may intrusive to the task
performance and time-consuming when having one tester at
a time in the observational setting [57, p. 44].
The data collection of the evaluation was implemented
by using Google Forms, as it is a free tool and covers all the
needs relating to the type of questions and sets of data for
further analysis.
C. Types of questions
Surveys commonly present two types of questions: open
or close-ended. Open-ended questions give more freedom to
the participants in answering without any influence, but they
require more time and effort from them in creating their
own answers and demanding interpretation of the collected
data [66]. Close-ended questions are more suitable for
quantitative usability data [67].
As the questionnaire has 69 questions in total, it used
close-ended questions but with a possibility to an open-
ended answer. Different types of questions were used,
changing according to the desired data. Most of the
questions were multiple-choice, with the option for the
tester to add their own open-ended answer. In this way, the
participants could always give their own input. Almost all
the questions had a screenshot image from the app to
contextualise the question.
D. Results
The evaluation questionnaire was divided into seven
sections: About you, About the attractions, About the Red
Prototype, About the Blue Prototype, Comparing the two
versions (Red/Blue), About Weimar, and Final opinion.
Among the questions (About the attractions), for example,
the
testers
were
asked
if
they
could
recognise
the
UNESCO’s
WHS
logo
after
using
the
prototypes,
confirming if they acquired this information by using the
prototypes or if they already knew it. From the feedback, it
was suggested that using the UNESCO’s WHS logo helps to
reinforce its branding, with 59% of the testers who
recognised this symbol claiming they learnt if from the
prototypes.
The “About Weimar” identified if the testers have been
to Weimar beforehand, to verify if the familiarity with the
locations and previous knowledge about the WHS site
would affect the answers. However, the results were
inconclusive in this regard. However, when checking if the
prototypes could serve as an incentive for people to travel to
148

ACHI 2020 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

Weimar, the evaluation suggested that the users who have
never been in the location were considering to visit the city
after using the app. It allows one to conclude that dedicated
apps can be a tool to promote the city.
The core-questions - “About the Red Prototype” and
“About
the
Blue
Prototype”
and
the
comparisons
-
identified the testers’ views on each one of the prototypes,
but also inquired about exclusive features/pages, such as
Routes, Settings and Right-Top-Menu available on the Blue
Prototype only. In the end, as the final evaluation of each
one of the implemented features, the testers answered a final
question regarding which one of the prototypes they would
prefer to use, resulting in 83.3% in favour of Blue Prototype
(literature-based
guidelines),
and
16.7%
for
the
Red
Prototype (industry-based guidelines).
The exclusive features mentioned in Section IV (the
ones not suggested from the found guidelines) were also
tested. The results are detailed in Table III, which displays
separately each one of the features tested and the guideline
that originated it, divided into ‘from industry-based’, ‘from
literature-based’, ‘from evaluation’ and the beforementioned
ones, that are not from the guidelines.
It is also important to mention that, by making the
literature review more inclusive - adding tailored outcomes
for specific target groups, such as elderly people and studies
on open-air media urban integration using apps – resulted in
a more inclusive set of guidelines in general.
As seen, the results were mostly favourable to the
literature-based prototype (blue version), confirming the
found guidelines suggested by academics, reports, and
official documentation for developers. These results can
support the idea that, sometimes, the apps offered at the
official stores might be closer related to the developers’
taste and expertise than to the real needs and requirements
of a niche sector.

VII. CONCLUSION
The main objective of this work was to set guidelines for
the future development of apps applied for historical open-
air locations, with emphasis on UNESCO World Heritage
Sites.
From this analysis, some unique guidelines can be
highlighted, such as, the best approach regarding the use of
a large amount of text to describe each POI (Point Of
Interest) - in this case, offering a short version, with the
possibility to read further/expand; no use of audio or video,
considering the surrounding noises while walking through
the city; the recommendation of implementing thematic
routes; and offering the possibility to change interface
features such as text-size (especially for elderly groups),
149

POI warnings based on GPS and the presence of WHS
related content, such as displaying the official WHS logo,
curated content and explanation about the reasons the place
was listed as WHS.
It can be argued that the found guidelines could be
applied not just to dedicated apps to open-air WHS, but also
to touristic apps in general. This assumption can be true, as
touristic
locations
also
require
wayfinding
and
POI
descriptions, alongside with the navigation, design, layout
and content recommendations described in this research.
It is important to say that – as it happens in most of the
independent projects – this research had a constrain of time
and budget for the prototype development and testing.
However, in the ideal scenario, the work could continue
with the implementation of a commercial app based on the
final guidelines and another round of tests with different
demographics. Another improvement could be done in
regards to inclusion, checking the extension of the elderly-
friendly features and extending the user-friendly approach to
various disabilities and special needs.
