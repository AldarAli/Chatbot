Abstract— SUMMIT is a mobile app that aims to gamify the 
experience of walkers and hikers and benefit the local 
communities through which they perambulate. It encourages 
physical activity through gamification of the user experience 
by adding additional elements of social fun and motivation to 
walking and hiking activities. It rewards users for their 
physical effort by offering access to local resources, hence 
increasing awareness and appreciation of the local assets and 
heritage and contributing to the local economy. The evaluation 
results show that both businesses and walkers were very 
receptive to the idea.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Romanticism era in the 18th century brought forth a shift 
in attitudes to the landscape and nature leading to the 
manifestation of the idea of walking through the countryside 
for pleasure [1]. An explosion of long distance walking 
routes occurred in the late 20th century with the Appalachian 
Trail in the USA [2] and the Pennine Way in Britain [3] as 
early examples. In Scotland, tourism figures from 2012 show 
that walking and hiking was the second most popular tourist 
activity among domestic visitors [4]. However, for many of 
these visitors, the walk can be the sole purpose of their trip 
and they may not access any other local attractions or local 
businesses. 
SUMMIT is a location-based mobile app that encourages 
the walking and hiking community to avail themselves of 
local resources including hospitality businesses, product 
vendors, tourist attractions and local information. The key 
goal is to “gamify” the user experience by adding additional 
elements of social fun, motivation and rewards to walking 
activities whilst increasing cultural appreciation through 
promotion of the local amenities and services to the benefit 
of the local economy. 
The idea behind SUMMIT is to challenge walkers and 
hikers to reach checkpoints (geo-fenced areas) that are 
located along popular walking and hiking routes. When 
walkers reach a checkpoint they are presented with a list of 
rewards on their mobile app from which they can choose 
their favourite. The rewards are provided by local businesses 
in the area and may include things like a free muffin or a 
20% discount on a product. For example, if the walker 
decides to choose a free muffin as his reward at some 
checkpoint, he selects this in his app and a virtual muffin is 
added to his “reward knapsack”.  He then takes this virtual 
muffin to the local shop that offered this reward to exchange 
his virtual muffin for a real one.  While he is there he may 
also buy a coffee or take friends with him who may also 
make some purchases. 
In this way, SUMMIT benefits both walkers and local 
businesses. It encourages physical activity by making such 
activities more fun and rewarding but also introduces 
walkers and hikers to new local resources in the area that 
they might not have visited otherwise.   
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II 
presents the related work. The design of SUMMIT is 
presented in Section III along with an evaluation of the first 
prototype that was carried out in the wild on Arthur’s Seat in 
Edinburgh, Scotland in Section IV. Section V details and 
discusses the results of the evaluation while Section VI 
concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK 
Pervasive gaming takes the gaming experience into the 
real world, focusing on introducing game elements into the 
everyday life of players. It exploits interaction devices such 
as handhelds to display virtual elements [5], generates 
location-sensitive responses to interaction [6], employs 
technology through which human game-masters can exercise 
control of the game experience [7] and involves interactive 
actors to perform non-player characters [8]. 
Pirates! [9] was one of the first successful attempts to 
port the computer game into the real world and the IPerG 
project [10] has successfully executed a number of pervasive 
games in real spaces such as Epidemic Menace [11] and Day 
of the Figurines [12]. Other groups have produced 
educational pervasive games such as Virus [13] and Paranoia 
Syndrome [14]. Artistically oriented pervasive games such 
as Can You See Me Now? [5] used whole cities as the game 
environment. Ludocity [15], a collection of pervasive games 
inspired by theatre, painting, dance and other art forms also 
exploits public places such as city streets and parks for social 
play. All Ludocity games are released under creative 
common license which allows everyone to run the games for 
free. Ingress by Google [16] is a near real-time augmented 
reality massively multiplayer online pervasive game with a

complex science fiction back story and continuous open 
narrative.  
On the other hand, SUMMIT is a real-world outdoor 
treasure hunt game using Global Positioning System (GPS)-
enabled devices inspired by geocaching [17]. Analogous to 
geocaching, SUMMIT 
“hides” rewards of different 
categories at different places along a popular route for users 
to find and collect. These rewards reflect the distinctive 
resources offered by the local area and community 
encouraging users to appreciate and take advantage of the 
local amenities on offer. SUMMIT also logs users’ 
achievements and allows them to perform social comparison 
of their performance against others, thus introducing a 
competitive 
element 
to 
the 
overall 
walking/hiking 
experience. 
To date, quite a few treasure hunt based pervasive 
applications 
aiming 
at 
increasing 
cultural 
heritage 
appreciation have emerged including the Regensburg 
REXplorer game [18] the Global Treasure Apps [19], the 
National Museum of Scotland Apps [20] and Huntzz [21]. 
The main difference between these applications and 
SUMMIT is that these applications do not reward users 
based on physical achievements but on solving puzzles and 
clues. Only the Global Treasure Apps include real-world 
rewards but the focus is on promoting artifacts and 
attractions rather than local businesses and communities.  
Although other stamping schemes for tourist checkpoints 
exist [22], these schemes usually require all checkpoints to 
be reached to validate the completion of a tour with the aim 
of collecting badges or similar rewards. On the other hand, 
SUMMIT users do not need to reach all checkpoints to 
collect rewards and have the flexibility of choosing their 
desired 
rewards. 
Instead 
of 
automated 
checkpoint 
verification, the stamping schemes involve manually dating 
and stamping of a personal completion brochure or manually 
entering codes collected from checkpoints on the respective 
websites for electronic validation. 
III. 
THE SUMMIT SYSTEM 
The SUMMIT system consists of two main components: 
a web app which allows business users to manage the 
rewards that they provide, and a mobile app, which is used 
by the walkers and hikers. Fig. 1 illustrates the SUMMIT 
system deployment including the server where information 
about business users and app users are stored.  
The web app was developed to enable easy sign-up of 
local businesses as reward providers. Once registered as 
business users, they can perform the actions depicted in the 
workflow diagram in Fig. 2. The supplier can add, edit or 
delete a business. They can add, deactivate, re-activate, 
delete and edit a specific reward item. They can also approve 
claims from the mobile app users. Fig. 3 shows the web app 
dashboard which displays the list of businesses and rewards 
own by a provider as well as the available actions. Alert 
icons will appear beside reward items that reach zero count 
so that the provider can decide to add more of the reward or 
delete it.

The mobile app was developed for the Android platform. 
It aims to enhance the walking activities by supporting the 
users’ personal achievement element through a reward 
scheme and the social competition element through 
comparisons of their progress against others via the social 
network site, Facebook. The mobile app monitors the users’

outdoor locations while they are en route using GPS. Each 
route has several pre-defined checkpoints, usually selected 
based on their touristic values to the respective region that 
are geo-fenced areas. The app does not provide real-time 
navigation but as users reach checkpoints, the phone will 
start vibrating and notifications will appear on the system 
bar. When this happens, users will unlock new virtual reward 
items provided by local businesses which they can exchange 
into real rewards. They can also post their achievement onto 
Facebook if they wish. 
Prior to the game, users can check out different routes 
and rewards associated with each of the routes. They can 
then select a route that provides the rewards they desire and 
suits their constraints in terms of time and distance. This 
flexibility enables users to customise their gaming 
experience based on their needs at any particular time. Fig. 4 
shows the workflow of the mobile app. When users select a 
route, the route information will be downloaded onto their 
phone assuming Internet connection is available. By pre-
loading the routes, the issue of unreliable 3G signal is 
avoided as the route information is now locally stored, hence 
will always be available to users when en route. During the 
hike, only GPS signal is required to track users’ position. 
Since each checkpoint covers an area of 50-metre radius, a 
short lost of GPS signals will not affect the performance of 
the app. These approaches give users the Virtual “Always-
On” Connectivity impression allowing them to have an 
undisrupted interaction experience. The problem of draining 
the battery power is also minimised as the phone is not 
constantly connected to the network. Synchronisation with 
the server occurs the next time network connectivity is 
available and activated by the user when all logged data on 
the mobile device is uploaded. To help users locate the 
rewards, a map that shows the locations of the different 
checkpoints is provided as illustrated in Figure 5(a). Fig. 5(b) 
shows a rewards selection dialog box.

IV. 
EVALUATION 
A trial of the SUMMIT mobile app has been carried out 
with 24 participants; 18 males and 6 females. Participants 
were volunteers who are either interested in mobile 
applications or hikers and walkers. They were issued with 
Samsung Galaxy SIII phones with the game pre-installed and 
were asked to hike up Arthur’s Seat, a popular rural area 
within the City of Edinburgh. After participants had played 
the game, they were asked to complete a questionnaire. They 
were asked to rate different features of the game on a 5-point 
Likert scale. These features included – S1: route information, 
S2: map, S3: rewards motivation, S4: advance knowledge of 
rewards, S5: rewards selection, S6: claim system, S7: 
rewards choices, S8: claim intention, S9: Facebook 
functionality and S10: Ease of use of the app. Additionally, 
they were given the freedom to provide further comments 
about any part of the game or their experience of using the 
mobile app. Please refer to Appendix I for the list of 
questions. 
A total of 7 businesses signed up to the rewards scheme. 
A week after the trial ended, they were contacted to gather 
their feedback on the web app. The questions included the 
number of customers the mobile app brought into the shops, 
other desired features for the web app and free comments on 
the web app and their experience in using it. Please refer to 
Appendix II for the list of questions. 
V. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The chart in Fig. 6 shows the overall average rating of all 
24 participants. On average participants were neutral on the 
usefulness of the route information (S1). Taking the level of 
significance, α = 0.05, a Mann-Whitney test on this variable 
between the younger (less than 40 years old, n=17, M=3.418, 
SD=0.425) and the older (more than 40 years old, n=7, 
M=2.286, SD=0.694) users showed a significant difference 
with U(24)=13, Z=-3.050, p=0.002 (see Fig. 7).

Figure 6. Overall average rating of all 24 participants. 
 
The older generation found the route information not 
useful while the younger generation found it useful. This 
might be because the older users were used to using 
guidebooks when walking and were expecting directional 
information such as descriptions of terrain and photographs 
of each checkpoint which was not provided via the app and 
might have led to some of them getting lost along the way. 
On average the participants found the map informative 
(S2). However, they would have preferred an interactive 
map. The participants found the rewards motivated them to 
go on the hike (S3). Some participants mentioned in their 
questionnaire that the rewards served as an initial motivation. 
As they moved from one checkpoint to another, the fact that 
there were rewards attached to each of the checkpoints 
became less important to them and, instead, their ultimate 
goal was to reach all the checkpoints and complete the route. 
This interesting finding suggests that the gamification aspect 
of numbering the checkpoints itself provided enough 
motivation for the user to carry on once they had started.  
Overall, participants thought that it was important to 
know the rewards in advance (S4) and to be given the option 
to choose from a selection of rewards (S5). They also found 
the claim system easy to use (S6).  
In terms of the range of rewards provided (S7), there was 
again a significant difference between younger (n=17) and 
older (n=7) users. This was revealed by applying the Mann-
Whitney test, with U(24)=17, Z=-2.842, p=0.005, to the 
results in Fig. 7. The younger users seemed to be satisfied 
with the type of rewards provided which included discounts 
on food, drinks, shoes, sweets, clothes, souvenirs and tours, 
while the older users were not. The older users would have 
liked some rewards that they could redeem immediately after 
the hike, for example, refreshments, discount at a local hotel 
or B&B and rewards targeted at kids.

The intention to claim all rewards (S8) also revealed a 
significant difference between the two age groups. Many of 
the participants were exhausted after the hike and selected 
their rewards only after they were home and once they were 
not in the vicinity of the shops. They were therefore less 
keen to make the effort to return to the area to collect their 
rewards at a later date. Again, the Mann-Whitney test 
showed a significant difference between the older and 
younger users, U(24)=21.5, Z=-2.529, p=0.013. Since the 
older users were less interested in the rewards, they were 
also less inclined to claim them. The participants rated the 
ability to post their achievement onto Facebook (S9) fairly 
low. One reason for this might be because, as the game was 
only a prototype, the users had to use test user accounts 
instead of their own accounts. As a result the achievement 
posts did not appear on their own Facebook wall or timeline. 
Finally, the average rating for ease of use of the app (S10) 
was good. However, there was again a significant difference 
between the older and younger users, as confirmed by the 
Mann-Whitney test, U(24)=17.5, Z=-2.801, p=0.005. This 
could be due to the fact that the younger users were more 
accustomed to gaming and more familiar with mobile apps 
and thus had a better idea about the flow of control and 
operations of the mobile app and phone in general. 
The feedback on subjective questions revealed that some 
participants would have liked the mobile app to provide 
more 
interesting 
information 
about 
the route 
and 
checkpoints. One of the experienced hikers suggested that it 
would be useful if the app could show real-time progress 
such as the time he took to go from one checkpoint to 
another and the overall time he took to complete the route. 
This would allow users to compare their real-time progress 
with each other, hence increasing the competitive element of 
the game. The game has also been found to provide 
motivation for a second time visitor to hike a hill/mountain 
that they have conquered before, as one of the participants 
stated: 
 
“Thanks for giving me a reason to walk up Arthur's 
Seat. I am feeling revitalised and refreshed now I'm 
53

home! This serves as an excellent reason to walk up 
hills/mountains that you have already conquered (I've 
been up Arthur's Seat twice).” 
 
From the perspective of the suppliers, overall they were 
very satisfied with the usability of the web app. 
Unfortunately they were not very meticulous in recording the 
actual rewards that were redeemed so we are unable to report 
actual numbers but we were assured that rewards were 
indeed claimed. 
In order to encourage claims after the trial, one of the 
suppliers offered an additional deal on top of those provided 
on the mobile app if participants claimed within a particular 
period of time. The suppliers remained very enthusiastic 
about the SUMMIT system following the trial and one of the 
suppliers suggested that it might be useful to include an 
online claim facility which might encourage more claims as 
the participants would be able to redeem their rewards 
anywhere at their own convenience. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
SUMMIT has successfully added the elements of social 
fun and motivation to walking and hiking activities. It helps 
to promote local resources around a route by making users 
aware of their existence through its rewards scheme and 
checkpoints assignment. Business users were satisfied with 
its ease of use and appreciated its potential as a useful 
medium for advertising and delivering their wares and 
services. The authors are now investigating other ways in 
which the concepts and business model underlying 
SUMMIT can be deployed to support the mobile, rural and 
tourist sectors.
