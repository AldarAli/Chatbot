Abstract— Healthcare systems globally are facing capacity 
issues due to the increased demand of health services, the high 
cost of resources and the level of quality anticipated of service 
providers. Emergency Departments (ED) are the most 
pressurized unit in healthcare systems due to uncertainty in 
demand and limited resources allocated. Mater Hospital (one 
of leading hospitals) in Dublin has built a new (state-of-the-art) 
unit for ED yet faced an issue in resourcing the unit to optimize 
performance. This paper presents an integrated solution to 
optimize the capacity of the new ED before opening to public 
and examine improvement interventions in the ED area. This 
solution provides ED management with a tool that can 
contribute significantly in enhancing patient experience by 
reducing the waiting time from 21 hours to 6 hours while 
achieving utilization below the 80% burn-out threshold. The 
model is recommended by Health Service Executives to be used 
national wide.

 INTRODUCTION 
Healthcare management, globally, is under constant 
pressures of increasing service costs, public demands, and 
quality expectations from patients. This drives the strategy 
into one direction, namely, continual improvement of 
strategies related to patients experience.  
While hospitals represent an important part of healthcare 
service providers, Emergency Departments (EDs) are 
considered the front line defense in managing the flow of 
patients into hospitals. The problem faced by ED managers 
is related to the fact that number of patients who arrive at ED 
usually exceed the physical capacity of the waiting rooms 
[1]. Overcrowding can lead to dramatic consequences that 
may include higher mortality rates for patients [2]. Crowding 
involves the patients waiting for ED admission, being 
monitored in non-treatment areas (corridors) and those 
waiting to be admitted in the hospital (inpatient). Those 
patients utilize resources in non-treatment areas and their 
waiting times exceed reasonable periods [3] and the problem 
can get worse with higher arrival rate [4]. 
In an Irish context, the Health Service Executive (HSE) 
is the government entity responsible for the provision of 
health and social services. The HSE has always addressed in 
its strategies the urgency to bring real and sustained reforms 
to Irish healthcare services. In 2007, a scheme has been 
presented by HSE to reward hospitals that maintain high 
performance levels [5]. To support continual improvement 
that leads to reduce the pressure on EDs, HSE has set a target 
of less than 6 hours to overall Patient Experience Time 
(PET), i.e., length of stay, within the ED that has been 
adopted ever since [6].  
The ED managers in Irish hospitals have developed a 
need, since then, for innovative solutions and applications to 
help them to achieve the target set by HSE and reduce the 
patient experience time in the emergency department to less 
than 6 hours. These solutions have to be capable of 
understanding their system dynamics and increase efficiency, 
while taking resources utilization and process rationalization 
into consideration. The challenge for these solutions would 
be in meeting the aforementioned pressures and managing 
the huge gap between the needs and costs of healthcare. 
Simulation is a powerful tool used to capture the 
complexity and dynamic features of ED processes. 
Simulation models have been proven to be an excellent and 
flexible tool for modeling such kinds of complex 
environment. A simulation model is an effective tool for 
testing the effect of different resource allocation schemes, 
which is crucial for efficient utilization of resources within 
the ED [7]. A simulation model is also a flexible tool that 
can be used to simulate the effect of different possible ED 
settings on patient waiting time [8]. Moreover, multi-
performance indicators can easily be measured using a 
simulation model, as stated by [9]. Simulation modeling used 
to examine staff scheduling impact on overall utilization and 
burnout issues related to over-utilized staff [10]. A number 
of studies in the literature used simulation to model the 
operation of ED using patient’s waiting time and throughput 
time as the main target service quality [11]. The impact of 
staff scheduling can also be investigated using simulation 
and modeling [12]. It can also be used to analyze the impact 
of the enhancements, made to the system after the relocation 
of the emergency department, on the patients flow [13].  
Aforementioned studies show that modeling and 
simulation is currently seen as a competent tool for EDs 
performance analysis, which allows the effects of actions and 
changes to be understood and predicted more easily. 
Compared to change initiatives, tools such as discrete event 
simulation provide a low risk, lower cost method to develop 
improvement strategies, test assumptions, and observe 
potential outcomes of decisions prior to implementation. 
Numerous discrete event simulation applications are found in 
healthcare, but very few demonstrate a pre-/post-intervention 
comparison [14]. Frequently, healthcare decision makers use

subjective information from frontline staff, providers, and 
other stakeholders to make strategic improvement decisions. 
Change attempts whether to structures (e.g., change in floor 
plan or layout) or to processes, may prove costly in terms of 
time and capital [15].  
This paper presents a simulation based solution to the key 
healthcare service providers (i.e., Public Hospitals) in order 
to help them to make the optimum decision in such 
stochastic environment. The simulation-based model will 
offer a tool for the decision makers to examine different 
scenarios for the given variables of the system. This will 
enable them to envisage the impact of the decisions on 
patient throughput time and resource utilization. The 
interpretations of the model output also allow the decision 
makers to gain new insights into the complexity of the 
interrelated variables and the effect of changes on the overall 
performance of the ED units. This research is a continuity of 
research work published in WSC 2012 [16]. Their work 
contributed to the simulation application in healthcare 
services with particular interest in ED in Irish hospitals [17]. 
This paper presents a simulation-based solution to develop 
effective strategies to reallocate an existing ED to a new ED 
in one of the largest hospitals in Dublin. The impact of the 
additional capacity on patient experience time will be 
assessed prior to opening the ED to the public. The main 
objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the new 
capacities and accordingly optimize nursing staff to cope 
with the increased demand of care. 
Section II gives an overview of the project's background, 
highlighting the nature of the partner hospital. Section III 
describes the suggested scenarios proposed by the ED 
management. Section IV presents and discusses results from 
the different scenarios used and applied. Section V concludes 
the paper, presenting the best proposed scenario to decrease 
the PET.

PROJECT BACKGROUND 
Mater University hospital in Dublin is an acute care 
public hospital in North Dublin. It provides a variety of 
healthcare services and has a total of 570 beds on premises, 
with a 24-hour ED that receives over 55,000 patients 
annually. The current ED of the hospital has 13 monitored 
trolley spaces, 3 of which are in a resuscitation area and are 
reserved for major trauma and critical care patients; an 
ambulatory care area (capacity 6 trolley spaces); two 
isolation rooms; a psychiatric assessment room; two rapid 
assessment triage bays; and two other triage rooms. The 
layout of the ED is shown in Figure 1, provided by the ED 
management.  
Five distinct areas can be identified: a waiting room for 
walk-in patients waiting for triage, a diagnostics area (X-ray 
and CT scan), an ambulatory care unit (ACU) area, an ED 
resuscitation area (CPR), and an ED major assessment area. 
Patients arriving by ambulance – usually in critical 
condition– are routed directly to the resuscitation area, 
whereas patients whose conditions require monitoring stay in 
the major assessment area. The ambulatory care area is for 
walk-in patients, who may be suffering from abdominal pain, 
headache, limb problems, wounds, head injuries, and facial 
problems. As a 24-hours department, the ED has three 
consultants, two nursing managers, and eleven nurses during 
the day and nine nurses at night, divided into six types of 
nurse: Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs), triage nurses, 
resuscitation nurses, respiratory nurses, majors/minors 
nurses, and health-care assistants. Physicians (excluding the 
three consultants who provide cover between 9 am and 5 pm 
(or 8 am and 8 pm) with 24/7 on-call provision) are divided 
into three types, registrar/specialist registrars; Senior House 
Officers (SHOs), and interns, and are distributed as follows 
when the roster allows: three registrars per day working 10-h 
shifts starting at 8am, 12pm and 10pm; two interns working 
daily 8 am – 5 pm shifts Monday to Friday; and 12 SHOs 
working fixed shifts during the day and night to keep the ED 
running. 
 
Figure 1.  ED physical layout and main care areas 
According to the task force report in 2007 [18], the 
overall physical space of the ED and infrastructure were 
inadequate. The hospital – which was operating at 
approximately 99% occupancy – had difficulty in 
accommodating the increasing flows in ED admission 
numbers. Therefore, patients who required critical care 
(ICU/HDC) beds suffered from significant delays and the 
ED could not meet the national target of 6 hours average 
Length Of Stay (LOS) for patients. The ED figures showed a 
clear evidence of overcrowding with an average of 17% of 
its patients choosing to leave before being seen by the ED 
clinician. The report also indicated that the average time 
from ED registration to discharge was 9.16 hours, that is 
3.16 hours over the 6 hours metric set by the HSE, and the 
average LOS from registration to acute admission was 21.3 
hours with a standard deviation of 17.2 hours (i.e., 3.5 times 
higher than the same national metric). Obviously, patients 
who are admitted will usually experience longer LOS times 
than those who are discharged due to delays between 
admission referral by an ED doctor, the allocation of a bed, 
and time taken to transfer the patient to the bed.  
To cope with these challenges, a simulation-based 
framework was developed by Abo-Hamad and Arisha [16], 
using ExtendSim v.8 [19], aiming to identify performance 
bottlenecks and explore improvement strategies to meet the 
HSE targets. To reduce the time of the model development 
cycle and to increase the confidence of the ED simulation 
model results, verification and validation were carried out 
throughout the development phases of 
the 
model. 
Furthermore, each model development phase was verified 
and validated against the previously completed phases. The 
final results of the simulation model were validated using 
78

face validation and comparison testing. Face validation was 
performed by interviewing ED senior managers and nursing 
staff to validate the final results of the simulation model. 
Comparison testing involved comparing the output of the 
simulation model with the real output of the system under 
identical input conditions According to the ED managers, the 
goal was to assess the performance of the ED if the average 
LOS of patients complies with the HSE 6 hours target. 
Therefore the framework was developed and used to assess 
the implications of a number of strategies. These strategies 
were the impact of variation in medical staffing, increasing 
clinical assessment space and finally assessing the impact of 
incorporating a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy regarding exceeding 
the national 6 hours LOS. The importance of this assumption 
was emphasized by the senior hospital decision makers to 
identify the real factors that contribute the unacceptable 
overcrowding status of the current ED; inappropriate 
physical space, insufficient staffing levels, or operational 
difficulties beyond the direct control of the ED. By using the 
model, the ED managers were able to reveal that 
enforcement of the national benchmark of 6-hour limit for 
EDs would have a significantly greater impact on reducing 
average LOS for all ED patients than increasing medical 
staff or assessment cubicles. Access block therefore, has 
been shown by the model to have the highest impact on 
prolonged average LOS for patients. Based on these 
recommendations, the ED management proposed the 
introduction of a new unit called Acute Medical Unit (AMU) 
that is co-located with the ED.  
Meanwhile, a new campus for the hospital was 
completed. The hospital development was a €284 million 
redevelopment including 55,000m2 of new acute hospital 
services 
including 
a 
new 
Emergency 
Department, 
Outpatients Department, GI unit, 12 new operating theatres, 
ICU and HDU, Radiology Department and 134 single en-
suite bedrooms. However, the new campus planners and 
senior hospital management wanted to model the relocation 
of the present ED to the new ED. The purpose is to assess 
the capacity of the new ED before opening to the public and 
to check whether the new capacities will cope with the 
demand of care or other strategies will be required. The 
assessment of the impact of these changes will be discussed 
in the next sections. 
III. 
STRATEGY ASSESSMENT 
Three strategies were proposed by the ED management 
to be assessed by the proposed model. The first is the new 
changes of the ED layout. The objective of these changes 
was to provide better patient flow and more space to avoid 
overcrowding and allowing the management team to 
increase the number of beds in each medical assessment 
area (Table I).  
The second scenario suggests that the hospital opens an 
AMU. The unit will be divided into two units; an acute 
medical assessment unit (AMAU) that opens from 8am to 
8pm and a Short Stay Unit (SSU). The purpose of the 
AMAU is to facilitate the immediate medical assessment, 
diagnosis and treatment of medical patients who suffer from 
a wide range of medical conditions who present to, or from 
within, a hospital requiring urgent or emergency care. The 
required patients can be admitted to the SSU for a short 
period for acute treatment and/or observation where the 
estimated length of stay is less than 48 hours. The logic 
behind limiting the working hours in the AMAU to only 12-
hours is to allow enough time for patients to be admitted to 
the hospital and make sure that this new pool of beds will 
always be available at the beginning of the next day. The 
unit will act then as a gateway between the ED and the 
wards of the hospital, and it will help increasing the 
throughput of the ED to achieve the national target of 6 
hours.

The third strategy scenario is related to the optimization 
of the staff levels with particular interest in nursing team 
due to the burn-out factor in two areas in the ED: 
Resuscitation Area and Majors Area. The ED managers 
were concerned that the nurses will be well over utilized due 
to the increase in the ED physical capacity. Therefore an 
optimization experiments were conducted to find the best 
combination of nurses for each shift which will enable the 
hospital to achieve the national 6-hour target without 
exceeding the threshold of staff burn-out. Flexibility in 
resource allocation and optimization of workload is a matter 
of urgency to the ED management team [10]. 
 
In summary, the strategy scenarios will model the 
impact of variation of layout, increasing the capacity in each 
assessment area, namely, CPR, majors area, and ACU area, 
open AMAU & SSU to avoid access blockage of patients to 
the 'upstream' hospital beds, and finally assessing the impact 
of optimizing the nursing staff level in each shift (Table II).

RESULTS ANALYSIS 
The first investigated scenario is to change the layout of 
the ED and increase the capacities of the three main 
assessment areas, and investigate the effect of that change on 
PET. Increasing the physical space by 65% (i.e., scenario 1) 
will decrease the number of patients in the waiting room, 
though the number of admitted patients will increase. The 
effect will be cascaded back through the ED progressively 
with more patients waiting on trolleys to be admitted to the 
hospital. Consequently the PET will increase for patients 
who are waiting to be admitted to the hospital (Table III). As 
a result, there will be no space left to meet the timely needs 
of the next patients who need emergency care.  
TABLE III.  
COMPARISON BETWEEN SIMULATION RESULTS OF 
CURRENT ED AND NEW ED 
 
To prevent access blockage of patients who are required 
to be admitted to the hospital, the introduction of the acute 
medical assessment unit was the second suggested scenario. 
The question was how many beds are needed to unlock the 
access blockage, given the current demand of care. The unit 
was modeled as an additional assessment unit that deals with 
a wide variety of medical patients that present to the ED. A 
number of experiments were designed determine the optimal 
number of beds needed for the unit, as shown in Table IV.

The capacity of the 25 beds was agreed to be divided 
between the two new units, namely AMAU and SSU, with 
12 beds being assigned to the AMAU and 13 beds to the 
SSU. After that, the management decided to increase the 
capacity of the SSU with 6 more beds, leading to 19 beds 
overall in the SSU. Arguably, it was justified that the 
increase in the number of beds in the short stay unit was due 
to the utilization of the SSU in comparison to the AMAU. 
Integrating the new factors into the simulation model 
developed has showed that the national 6 hours admission 
target is still not met. However, the introduction of this 
intervention has provided a new decline in the PET (Table 
V). 
ED 
Management 
demonstrated 
interests 
in 
the 
optimization of resources – with a particular emphasis on 
nurses. The question is “How many nurses should be availed 
in every shift to achieve the national target of 6-hours)?”. 
The management team also emphasized on the importance of 
avoiding the burn-out of nurses due to long working hours. A 
full factorial design of experiment was constructed based on 
an orthogonal array (L36) [20]. Thirty six experiments were 
carried out with different levels of nursing staff, varying 
between 6-11 nurses during the day and 4-9 nurses during 
the night shift. The L36 design allows for testing the two 
factors at each of their levels to analyze their impact on the 
responses (i.e., outputs), namely the PET-All, PET-
Admitted, PET-discharged and the utilization of the nurses, 
as recommended by the managers for each experiment. Table 
VII shows the impact of different levels of nursing staff for 
each shift on the performance indicators and on the nurses 
utilization.

Sensitivity analysis of number of nurses in each shift and 
different performance indicators (Figure 3) demonstrated that 
assigning 9 nurses on the day shift and 7 nurses on the night 
shift will improve performance. This resource schedule 
along with other recommendation can easily help the 
hospital to achieve the national target while maintaining the 
utilization level of the nurses at 80% (less than burn-out 
level) [10]. 
The results of the simulation model showed that the 
adoption of scenario 3 has the greatest impact on the patient 
experience time in the ED as shown in Figure 4. The 
recommendations of scenario 3 are changing the layout of 
the ED along with increasing the capacity of the assessment 
areas by 65%, open an AMAU and SSU units with 12 and 19 
assessment areas respectively, and change the number of 
nurses on floor to 9 nurses during the day and 7 nurses at 
night. Scenarios 1 and 2 both showed a significant 
improvement from the baseline scenario, with patient 
experience times decreasing substantially, yet both failed to 
achieve the national target of less than 6 hour for the 
experience time of patients. 
For verification of the simulation results, an overall 
confidence of interval of the simulation output was obtained 
with at least 95% confidence level that all KPIs lie in the 
dimensional box defined by the confidence intervals. Ten 
replicas of each scenario was generated to obtain the results 
of the confidence intervals for each KPI (Table VI). 
To avoid the inflated error rate that resulted from using 
separate confidence intervals, a joint confidence region was 
constructed, based on Hotelling's T2 distribution, which is a 
generalization of the univariate t-distribution [21]. The three 
KPIs were chosen for calculating the T2 value, namely, the 
PET-All, PET-Admitted, and the PET-Discharged. The 
confidence regions were calculated for each of the three

The following figures compare the confidence region of 
each pair of the performance indicators, namely the PET of 
all patients; PET of admitted patients and PET of discharged 
patients across the three scenarios. The confidence region on 
the upper left corner of each graph represents the region 
formed by the two indicators under the first scenario, i.e., 
changing the layout of the ED and increase the capacity of 
the three assessment areas by 65%. While the region formed 
in the center of each graph shows the confidence region of 
each pair of indicators for the second scenario. Finally the 
lower right corner of each graph is the confidence region for 
the third scenario; that combines the first and second 
scenarios with optimum number of nurses. Figure 2 shows 
that increasing the capacity of the ED will not solve the 
overcrowding problem unless other interventions are 
introduced. Thus, finding the appropriate staffing levels is a 
key to cope with such increase in capacity along with the 
incorporation of a block-free unit (i.e., AMU)

CONCLUSION 
The increased demand for ED services in Irish Hospitals 
puts an immense pressure on healthcare systems to meet 
patients' expectations. It is evident that increasing one or two 
particular resources (e.g., layout) will not be adequate to 
significantly improve the patient experience time in the ED. 
The delays that the patients experience is strongly related to 
bed access 'upstream' in the hospital, thus whether a bed is 
available for the patient to be admitted or not is one of the 
main factors influencing the patient throughput. This paper 
presented a simulation-based solution that is used to develop 
effective strategies to reallocate the present ED to the new 
ED for Mater hospital in Dublin.  
The business model of the present ED was projected into 
the layout of the new ED to assess the impact of the 
additional capacity on patient experience time. These 
changes were investigated before opening the ED to the 
public to check whether the new capacities will cope with the 
demand of care or other strategies will be required. The first

intervention was the changes in the layout of the ED from 19 
to 31 assessment areas that were proposed to enhance the 
patient flow. The simulation model showed that the new 
capacity will not reduce patient experience time. However, it 
will help to decrease the number of patients in the waiting 
room, though the number of admitted patients will increase. 
The second intervention that was assessed is the introduction 
of an acute medical unit (AMU) with access to a minimum 
of 25 assessment areas. This intervention was recommended 
based on previous research on the present ED. The unit is to 
be collocated with the ED and should have limited working 
hours allowing the pool of assessment areas to be vacant for 
the next following day. This unit contributed significantly in 
addressing the problem of upstream bed blockage in the 
hospital, leading to more than 50% reduction of the total 
patient experience time in the ED. Also, combining these 
interventions together led to more than 70% reduction in the 
total patient experience time. Finally the third scenario is to 
optimize the allocation of nurses in two areas of the ED: 
Resuscitation Area and Majors Area. The optimization 
process resulted into allocating 9 nurses in the day shift and 
7 nurses in the night shift. Optimizing the resources in the 
ED will enhance the overall performance of the unit and also 
maintain the burn-out factor below 85%. The combination of 
these three interventions resulted in a significant reduction of 
PET from 21 hours to 6 hours and also to achieve 95% of 
patients to be seen by a doctor in less than 6 hours. ED 
management has engaged in the process of the solution and 
the confidence of the simulated results has increased 
significantly after the validation of the model.  
Due to the flexibility and extendibility features of the 
framework, it provided the hospital management with a 
lower cost method to develop improvement strategies, test 
assumptions, and observe potential outcomes of decisions 
prior to implementation. The confidence level of the project 
output encouraged the HSE to adopt the framework to design 
and plan the introduction of the AMU in every hospital 
across the country. A pilot study has been initiated for the 
largest six hospitals in Dublin, which will be implemented at 
a later stage national wide.
