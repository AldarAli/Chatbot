Abstract—In Human Computer Interaction (HCI), acquisition 
of physiological signals for emotion recognition is done by 
emotion researches. Prior to this, one needs to identify the 
reliability of physiological responses. The aim of this study was 
to investigate the reliability of physiological responses induced 
by sadness and disgust using an experiment that was repeated 
10 times. Twenty subjects participated in this experiment. For 
emotion induction, twenty different emotional stimuli were 
selected in a pilot experiment. Skin Conductance Level (SCL), 
Skin Conductance Response (SCR), and Heart Rate (HR) were 
measured before the presentation of stimuli as a baseline and 
during the presentation of the stimuli as emotional state. The 
results showed that physiological signals during emotional 
states for the 10 times the experiment was repeated were stable 
and reliable compared to the baseline. Our results suggest that 
physiological signals of sadness and disgust are reliable over 
time. This means that physiological signals are reliable and 
useful tools for emotion recognition. These results can be useful 
in developing an emotion theory, or profiling emotion-specific 
physiological responses, as well as establishing the basis for an 
emotion recognition system in HCI.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
To recognize human's emotions and feelings, various 
physiological signals have been widely used in human 
computer interaction (HCI) [1]. Recently, physiological 
signals have been applied to continuous ambulatory 
monitoring of the affective state of individuals. For this, one 
needs to identify the pattern of physiological responses under 
specific emotional situations. This is important for basic and 
applied physiological research [2][3]. Although previous 
results have shown the temporal stability of physiological 
response patterns [4]-[11], they are not sufficient to verify 
whether or not complex patterns are stable [2]. Some results 
focused on the stability of the physiological responses by 
introducing different time intervals (e.g., 2 weeks or 4 weeks 
[9][10]) or using different kinds of biomarkers (e.g., blinking 
responses [9][11], Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), 
heart rate, salivary cortisol [12], and startle response [10]). 
Other studies failed to show consistent findings despite 
repetitive experiments [13][14]. They were limited to 
measuring the physiological responses only twice within a 
relatively short time interval with the same stimuli to 
examine whether or not the given conditions evoked stable 
emotions. The results may have possibly been subject to an 
adaptation effect to stimuli. Also, the methodological issue 
with these studies is that the stability was determined by 
physiological measures induced by valence (pleasant and 
unpleasant) not by a specific emotion. To examine the 
reliability of physiological responses over a relatively long 
period of time, we attempted to identify the stability of 
physiological responses induced by specific emotions 
(sadness and disgust) using audio-visual film clips in an 
experiment repeated 10 times. What differs from previous 
studies is the elimination of possible adaptation and learning 
effect (e.g., habituation) to the same stimuli by using 
differential emotional stimuli to effectively provoke each 
emotion, i.e., sadness and disgust. The rest of the paper is 
structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide the 
experimental methods used including description of the 
subjects, material and procedure. In Section 3, we present the 
experimental results and we conclude in Section 4. 
II. 
METHODS 
The emotional stimuli were 2~4 minutes long film clips, 
captured originally from a variety of movies and TV shows. 
The contents of the sadness film clips included scenes to 
address themes of death of parents or lover, separation, 
longing for mother, etc., and the contents of disgusting film 
clips included themes such as mutilation, butchery, and 
blooding. A total of 20 emotional stimuli were selected (2 
emotions repeated 10 times each) by the pilot study. To 
examine whether the stimuli were suitable for provoking 
emotion, an appropriateness (the label of the experienced 
emotion i.e., sadness, disgust, and others) and an 
effectiveness (the intensity of the emotion in response to the 
emotional stimulus) of each stimulus were tested by the 
participants’ ratings. The experimental procedures follow. 
Twenty healthy persons (10 males and 10 females) aged 21.0 
(SD 1.9) years old college students participated in this 
experiment. They filled out a written consent before the 
beginning of the study and were introduced to the 
experiment protocols. Then, they were attached electrodes on 
their wrist, finger, and ankle for measurement of 
physiological signals, i.e., electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
electrodermal activity (EDA). Physiological signals were 
measured for 1 minute during baseline (before presentation 
of the stimuli) and for 2~ 4 minutes during emotional state 
(during presentation of stimuli) by using the MP100 (Biopac, 
USA). Finally, their psychological assessment was rated 
based on the experienced emotions. The procedures were 
conducted on each of the two emotions for 10 weeks on a 
weekly basis. To analyze physiological data, tonic level (skin 
conductance level, SCL, in uS) and phasic level (skin 
conductance response, SCR, in uS) were extracted from the

EDA channel and heart rate (HR, in beats per minute) in the 
ECG. The physiological data were analyzed for each 30 
seconds from the baseline and emotional states. Also, 
Cronbach’s alpha [15], which is a measure of internal 
consistency, was used as a basis to determine the reliability 
of physiological responses observed during the 10 times. 
III. 
RESULTS 
The results of psychological assessment on emotional 
stimuli showed appropriateness ranging from 83 to 100 
percent and effectiveness ranging from 8.7 to 10.4 point (on 
an 11-point Likert scale [16]). Sadness, in particular, had an 
average of 96 percent appropriateness and 9.2 point of 
effectiveness, and disgust showed 94 percent appropriateness 
and 10.1 point of effectiveness. Also, as Tables 1 and 2 
illustrate, SCL and HR showed that Cronbach’s alpha was 
greater than .90 for both sadness and disgust emotions.

CONCLUSION 
This study attempted to verify the reliability of 
physiological responses associated with specific emotions, 
namely sadness and disgust, across experiments repeated 10 
times. Despite a small sample size, we identified that the 
physiological responses are stable during the experiment 
repeated 10 times using different stimuli evoking an emotion 
(e.g., sadness). In particular, SCL and HR having values 
higher than .95 indicate stability and consistency. Although 
the limitations of this study such as small sample size may 
affect the generalization, the results can be useful in 
developing an emotion theory, or profiling emotion-specific 
physiological responses, as well as establishing the basis for 
emotion recognition system in HCI.
