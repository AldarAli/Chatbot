Abstract— One possible way of reducing drivers’ psychological 
burden under severe traffic congestion is to reframe their travel 
time as “valuable time” via “Information and Communication 
Technologies (ICTs) for enjoying traffic congestion.” Such 
technology, of course, must be safe for drivers and satisfy legal 
restrictions. As a first step, a questionnaire survey was 
conducted to grasp drivers’ activities during traffic congestion, 
thus clarifying the possible content of these ICTs, as well as the 
target groups. Overall, the majority of participants reported 
engaging in conversations to pass the time when they had 
passengers in the car. Furthermore, for long-term congestions, 
these drivers selected more active activities (i.e., activities 
requiring specific motions to be performed). Drivers without 
any passengers tended to select passive activities (i.e., activities 
that do not require specific motions) during short-term traffic 
congestions. Younger drivers and more creative and curious 
drivers also selected active activities during long-term 
congestions. Taken together, the results suggest that one of our 
future main targets for these ICTs is young people with 
passengers (particularly for long-term traffic congestions).

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
In this study, we introduce a new idea for coping with 
traffic congestion. In the following sections, we relate past 
work in this area and then provide an outline of the present 
study. 
A. A new idea for coping with traffic congestion 
In many countries, traffic congestion is a serious problem 
that lacks an effective solution. In large cities, the main reason 
for traffic congestion is usually rapid motorization in 
conjunction with slow road infrastructure construction. 
However, severe congestions also commonly occur in 
relatively small cities, especially after events or festivals that 
generate a large, unusual traffic demand. Resolving these 
problems requires large-scale infrastructure construction, 
which takes a long time to realize. Therefore, non-structural 
countermeasures, such as information provision, signal 
control, public transportation promotion, etc., have been 
conducted for some time to reduce or disperse traffic demand, 
as is shown in the case of Los Angeles [1]. Nevertheless, it 
remains difficult to solve the problem of traffic congestion 
using these methods.  
Travel time has long been considered a negative aspect of 
travelling. Especially for drivers, travel time during traffic 
congestion is regarded as a psychological burden because of 
the behavioral and attentional restrictions imposed by driving. 
Hennessy et al. revealed a positive relationship between traffic 
congestion and aggressive driving [2], as did Shinar et al. [3]. 
To deal with the long waiting times that accompany traffic 
congestion, people are increasingly adopting various 
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). ICT, 
along with mobile telecommunication technologies and 
autonomous driving, is advancing rapidly nowadays, and such 
technologies can potentially reframe travel time as “valuable 
time.” This, in turn, might lead to some form of psychological 
resolution for serious traffic congestion. In the present study, 
these technologies are termed “ICTs for enjoying traffic 
congestion.” Considering that car manufacturers, electronics 
companies, and researchers are now competing to develop 
travel-related technologies, such as “head-up displays” 
[HUDs], which allow for projecting information on the front 
windows of vehicles [4][5], it is necessary to accumulate 
knowledge on the content of these ICT applications that is 
desirable for drivers to make use of their time during traffic 
congestion. In this study, in order to aid in the future 
development of “ICTs for enjoying traffic congestion,” a 
questionnaire survey was conducted on drivers’ activities 
during traffic congestions. A specific focus was on the target 
groups and contents of these ICTs. 
B. Related work 
In the literature on ICT applications for drivers, Siuhi and 
Mwakalonge reviewed the latest trends and found that route 
planning, traffic safety, parking information, transportation 
data collection, and fuel emissions and consumption are the 
main categories of ICTs for drivers [6]. Among them, route 
planning information via smartphones appeared to be most 
acceptable for young drivers [7], and many drivers found stop 
sign information provision as a traffic safety measure useful 
[8]. Ilarri et al. introduced the present course of development 
of applications for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) 
using extensive references [9]. However, there are no studies, 
to our knowledge, on developing ICTs to reduce drivers’ 
psychological burden during congestion. 
Psychology researchers have identified several factors that 
can shorten human time perception. Particularly, Maister 
noted that “the more valuable the service, the longer the 
customer will wait” [10]. In exploring what qualities make a 
service “valuable,” Failing, et al. revealed that services with

“higher reward” might induce attentional deployment and 
shorten people’s subjective time [11]. Furthermore, Edwards, 
et al. found that “high intensity exercise” in sports can shorten 
subjective time [12]. Misuraca et al. examined groups of 
maximizers and satisficers, and found that maximizers (who 
generally choose the option with the highest expected utility) 
tend to perceive time as shorter during the “decision-making” 
process than do satisficers (who generally choose the “good-
enough” alternative) [13]. From the viewpoint of enjoyment, 
Sackett, et al. found that time passes more quickly during 
enjoyable experiences [14], and Xu, et al. mentioned that 
switching between more and less entertaining tasks can 
generate overestimation of time duration [15]. So far, there is 
little research focusing on drivers’ time perception. 
Therefore, our proposed concept of “ICTs for enjoying 
traffic congestion” can be considered new and requiring 
further study as a potential intervention for the psychological 
burden experienced by drivers in serious traffic congestions. 
C. Outline of this work 
The outline of this work is as follows. Section II provides 
an overview of the questionnaire survey. Section III 
introduces the statistical results of the survey, including 
several activity choice models. Finally, the conclusions and 
suggestions for future work are mentioned in Section IV.

SURVEY OVERVIEW  
In this section, an overview of the web questionnaire 
survey is described. 
A. Sample selection 
In this paper, a web-based questionnaire survey was 
conducted to understand drivers’ activities to pass the time 
during serious traffic congestion. To investigate the variety of 
actual behaviors, this method is considered to be more realistic 
and cost-effective for collecting data about drivers’ 
experience than in-situ observations conducted by equipping 
drive recorders to sample vehicles. Considering the research 
objective, respondents with driving experience in traffic 
congestion were desired. Therefore, the survey was conducted 
via a web-based research company. Their monitors were 
screened using three criteria: have a drivers’ license, have 
more than one year of driving experience, and have 
experienced being caught in a severe traffic jam. The 
respondent pool was also limited to those aged 20–59 years, 
in consideration of the age-related declines in driving skills. 
The percentage of respondents in each age group (20–29, 30–
39, 40–49, and 50–59) was set to be 25% by the survey 
company. The size of total valid samples was 311. An outline 
of the questionnaire and inclusion criteria are provided in 
Table I. Since the sample size appears to potentially have 
insufficient power, we decided that the current number of 
participants could serve as a preliminary trial to gain a rough 
understanding of drivers’ activities. 
B. Questionnaire item details 
As shown in Table I, the questionnaire asked respondents 
about their activities in the car during the most serious 
instance of traffic congestion ever experienced, along with 
their personality and driving tendencies. When a serious 
traffic jam is expected, a driver must leave after considering 
how to spend that time. Therefore, we determined that even 
this method can collect drivers’ needs and opinions. Details 
of these items are introduced in the following three 
subsections.

and 25% (50–59) 
Contents of the questionnaire 
(1) Congestion situation concerning the most serious traffic jam 
ever experienced: time duration, speed, with/without 
passengers, etc. 
(2) Activities in the car during the traffic jam (multiple answers 
were allowed) 
(3) Personality traits and tendencies while driving 
 
1) Activities in the car 
Respondents’ activities in the car during the traffic 
congestion were categorized as active activities and passive 
activities. Active activities refer to activities requiring specific 
motions to perform, while passive activities are activities that 
do not require such motions. In the survey, specific activities 
were set for each category to standardize the responses, as 
follows. Respondents were simply asked to indicate if they 
had experienced each activity or not during the most serious 
traffic congestion that they had experienced.  
- 
Active activities: making conversation, eating snacks, 
singing, playing mobile games, surfing the web, telling 
funny/horror stories, and answering riddles/quizzes 
- 
Passive activities: listening to music, watching TV, and 
listening to the radio 
2) Personality 
Items were prepared to assess drivers’ personalities by 
referring to the egogram proposed by J. M. Dusay in the field 
of transactional analysis in personality psychology [16]. 
Egogram is an easy and compact method of creating 
questionnaire items while considering the burden on 
respondents. The egogram involves dividing individuals’ 
personalities into five factors (controlling parent [CP], 
nurturing parent [NP], adult ego state [A], free child [FC], and 
adapted child [AC]). The meaning of each factor and their 
specific items are shown in Table II. Three items were 
selected from among ten original items for each factor in 
accordance with the survey context. Each item is rated on a 6-
point Likert scale: 1 = disagree, 2 = moderately disagree, 3 = 
slightly disagree, 4 = slightly agree, 5 = moderately agree, 6 = 
agree).

C. Survey hypotheses 
  The following two hypotheses were devised. 
a) Drivers’ personality factors and driving tendencies affect 
how they pass the time during traffic congestion. 
b) The existence of passengers and the seriousness of the 
traffic congestion influence drivers’ choice of active 
activities. 
 
III. 
RESULTS 
The following sections outline the results of the statistical 
analyses. 
A. Situations of traffic congestions 
Figure 1 shows the distribution of trip purposes and 
whether there were passengers in the car or not when the 
respondents encountered the serious traffic congestion. The 
percentage of trips with passengers along with each trip’s 
purpose are also shown in the figure. The most frequent 
purpose was “sightseeing/trip,” and most respondents who 
provided this answer noted that there were passengers in the 
car with them. On the other hand, in the case of “business” 
and “commuting,” respondents were less likely to have 
passengers compared with the other purposes. It was thought 
that for these purposes, respondents might have been more 
irritable and sensitive to delay than for other purposes because 
of their arguably greater schedule constraints and ill-
preparedness for serious traffic congestion; respondents’ 
choice tendencies might also differ for these purposes than for 
the others. Therefore, for all further analyses, these two 
purposes were excluded from the samples. 
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the congestion durations

Figure 2. Distribution of congestion duration and its relation to existence of 
passengers (N = 259) 
according to whether there were passengers in the car. Notably, 
the majority of respondents reported their most serious 
congestion as lasting for one hour or less. If congestion 
duration was divided into two groups—one hour or less and 
two hours or more—the frequencies were roughly equal. The 
proportion of respondents with passengers was also similar 
between these two groups (t = 0.925, p = 0.356). Thus, for 
subsequent analyses, the sample was divided into two 
categories: “one hour or less” and “two hours or more.” 
Participants also were asked to report the perceived speed 
of the traffic congestion using two categories: “slowly move” 
(assumed to be congestions caused by traffic concentration in 
expressways) and “hardly move” (assumed to be congestion 
caused by accidents or other cases). The distribution of 
congestion duration, existence of passengers, and speed is 
shown in Figure 3.  
 
 
Figure 3. Congestion duration, existence of passengers, and speed 
categories (N = 259) 
The ratios of the existence of passengers were the same in 
both speed categories (t = 0.247, p = 0.805), significantly 
higher for the “hardly move” category (t = 4.62, p ≤ 0.01).  
B. Distribution of driving tendencies 
Figure 4 shows the results of respondents’ driving 
tendency. In general, they appeared to have a high level of 
manner compliance and like to drive without a break. For 
driving tendencies during congestion, 32% of respondents 
reported using mobile phones and 48% reported becoming 
irritated. As these percentages were higher than was the 
percentage of individuals with low manner compliance (22%), 
it seems that manner compliance is not directly linked to 
actual behaviors in traffic congestion. This result suggests that 
it is more important to ensure their safe and effective use of 
time and the reduction of their psychological burden via ICTs 
than to improve their manners. 
  
Figure 4. Distribution of responses for driving tendencies (N = 259) 
C. Activity choices during traffic congestion 
For this analysis, “conversation” was separated from the 
other active activities because a high proportion of 
respondents selected it when there were passengers in the car. 
Therefore, activities were re-categorized as conversation, 
active activities, and passive activities.  
Figure 5 shows how respondents passed their time in the 
cars during serious traffic congestions according to whether 
there were passengers in the car or not. When there were 
passengers, almost 80% of respondents selected conversation. 
However, if the drivers were alone (n = 58), approximately 
20% did nothing. Moreover, 40% of respondents with 
passengers selected active activities, whereas less than 20% 
selected such activities if they were alone. Although the 
percentages of those who chose passive activities were high, 
regardless of the existence of passengers, a high proportion 
of respondents chose passive activities, especially if they 
were alone. Based on these findings, it is possible to assume 
that conversation and active activities were preferable to 
drivers when they were with passengers, while some drivers 
appeared to not pursue any activity when they were alone. 
D. Personality factors affecting active and passive activities 
Table III shows the average score for each personality 
factor when dividing respondents according to their choice of 
activities. The scores of each personality factor were 
normalized to range from 0 to 1, with 0 denoting a low score 
and 1 denoting a high score. The FC factor appeared to be a 
dividing factor for active and passive activities: that is, those 
who chose active activities had higher FC scores. When 
focusing on passive vs. non-passive activities, the CP and A 
scores significantly differed. 
E. Activity choice model 
Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explain 
what factors were related to respondents’ choice of active and 
passive activities. 
1) Choice model for active activities 
The above analyses revealed that the existence of 
passengers and the FC personality factor were influential in

the selection of active activities. Therefore, a logistic 
regression analysis was conducted (see Table IV) to clarify 
how personality factors, the existence of passengers, the 
congestion situation, and driving tendencies influenced the 
selection of active activities.  
The coefficients were estimated using a significance 
probability of 90% and the stepwise method, and the analyses 
were carried out separately by congestion duration (“one hour 
or less” and “two hours or more”). The findings from the 
analysis were as follows. 
a) Factors related to active activities during short-term 
congestions 
In short-term (one hour or less) traffic jams, active 
activities were significantly more likely to be chosen by 
drivers who used their mobile phones during congestion and 
who have high manner compliance (see Table IV). 
Furthermore, despite the above findings, the existence of 
passengers and FC scores did not have a significant 
association with active activities. 
b) Factors related to active activities during long-term 
congestions 
Unlike the results for the short-term congestions, the 
existence of passengers and FC scores did significantly relate 
to selection of active activities during long-term congestions 
(two hours or more). In addition, when the traffic jam was

“hardly moving” and respondents were young, respondents 
had a stronger tendency to select active activities. 
c) Comparison of active activity models between short- 
and long-term congestions  
Comparing the choice models for short- and long-term 
congestions revealed that active activities were significantly 
more influenced by drivers’ driving tendencies in short-term 
congestions, while in long-term congestions, they were 
significantly more influenced by drivers’ personality factors, 
age, and congestion situations. These results suggest that

when developing new ICTs for drivers, it is necessary to 
understand that the factors that must be considered might 
change according to the duration of the traffic congestions. 
2) Choice model for passive activities 
In contrast to active activities, passive activities were 
adopted more frequently when drivers were alone. As shown 
in Table III, CP and A scores were significantly related to 
choice of passive activities. Therefore, a logistic regression 
analysis was conducted again in the same way as in the 
previous section. The results are shown in Table V. 
a) Factors related to passive activities in short-term 
congestions 
As shown in Table V, it is clear that respondents tended to 
select passive activities when driving alone in short-term 
congestions. Notably, none of the personality factors were 
significant (like the results for active activities). Furthermore, 
drivers who reported that they liked to drive and could tolerate 
traffic jams tended to select passive activities. 
TABLE V.  
PASSIVE ACTIVITY CHOICE MODEL ACCORDING TO 
CONGESTION TIME 
*: P<0.10, **: P<0.05, ***: P<0.01 
b) Factors related to passive activities in long-term 
congestions 
  In long-term congestions, the existence of passengers 
was not significantly related to passive activity choice. 
Among the personality factors, only CP scores was 
significantly related. Finally, drivers that tended to use detours 
often preferred passive activities. 
c) Comparison of passive activity models between 
short- and long-term congestions  
The previous analysis suggested that both CP and A scores 
influenced passive activity choice. However, the regression 
analysis showed that only CP score was related to passive 
activity choice, and only in long-term congestions. One 
possible reason for this is multicollinearity. The correlation 
coefficient between CP and A was 0.273, which is considered 
a weak correlation in psychology research. Multicollinearity 
was tested for in other respects, and it revealed no other 
problems. Furthermore, as in the case of active activities, 
personality factors related to the choice of passive activities 
only in long-term congestions. When drivers were alone in 
short-term traffic congestion, they appeared more likely to 
choose passive activities. 
3) Comparison of the two activity choice models 
Figure 6 provides a summary of the activity choice models 
with path coefficients for the factors significantly related to 
active and passive activities. The solid lines denote positive 
effects and the dotted lines denote negative effects. In addition, 
the thickness of the lines expresses the significance level of 
the path coefficient.  
 
 
*: p<0.10, **: p<0.05, ***: p<0.01 
Figure 6. The summary of the activity choice models 
The results showed that drivers’ personal attributes and 
personality factors had significant associations with activity 
choice only during long-term traffic congestions, whereas 
driving tendencies had significant relations only for the short-
time traffic congestions. It therefore seems natural that drivers 
that tend to use mobile phones during traffic congestions 
might choose active activities in short-term congestions. 
However, a surprising finding was that during short-term 
traffic congestions, higher manner compliance was associated 
with selection of active activities, which included some 
activities deemed illegal while driving (e.g., surfing the web, 
playing mobile games). It is possible that individuals with 
higher manner compliance do try to find legal active activities 
to pass the time during traffic congestions.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This web-based questionnaire survey of drivers was 
designed to identify activities used to pass the time during 
serious traffic congestions, and clarify the factors that related 
to the choice of active and passive activities. Conversations 
were found to be effective for passing the time for most 
drivers with passengers. The activity choice models also 
revealed that drivers without passengers tended to choose 
passive activities in short-term traffic congestions, while 
drivers with passengers tended to choose active activities 
during long-term congestions. Therefore, it seemed important 
to promote active activities, including conversation, when 
there are passengers in the car. In addition, when focusing on 
long-term congestions, younger drivers and drivers with 
higher FC scores tended to select active activities.  
Based on these results, one of promising future targets for 
ICTs aimed at helping drivers pass the time during long-term 
traffic congestion are “young people with passengers.” The 
use of ICTs might be particularly helpful for traffic 
congestions that are “hardly moving.” Once a target is 
determined, it becomes clear what type of content should be 
developed to promote the drivers’ actions in the cars. It can be 
an expected technology, for example, to offer conversation 
automatically based upon the passengers’ attributes and 
preferences. 
On the other hand, when focusing on short-term traffic 
congestions, drivers’ driving tendencies had a stronger 
influence on their activity choice compared personality factors. 
In addition, some passengers who were alone did not choose 
any activity. Because even drivers with high manner 
compliance tend to engage in active activities, such as using 
cellphones, which is considered an unsafe behavior, during 
short-term congestions, it might also be necessary to develop 
ICTs that can help drivers effectively pass their time safely. A 
handsfree quiz function with voice recognition can be one of 
the solutions. 
The future tasks in this area are the development of apps 
for drivers that conform to legal restrictions, and checking to 
what extent these apps gratify drivers under severe traffic 
congestions. In general, drivers cannot use most existing apps 
and games since watching screens is a traffic violation. 
Therefore, future apps for drivers should be primarily 
operated by drivers’ voice. It is important, of course, that such 
apps keep drivers’ attention on their driving, without 
immersing them too deeply in the app. In Japan, it is said that 
drivers are so disciplined that comparatively immersive apps 
of “ICTs for enjoying traffic congestion” might be applicable. 
However, when providing such apps to drivers, it is critical to 
understand the cultural backgrounds of cities where they are 
introduced.
