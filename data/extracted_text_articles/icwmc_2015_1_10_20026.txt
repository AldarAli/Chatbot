Abstract— Optical Wireless Communications (OWC) refer 
to communication based on the unguided propagation of 
optic waves. This technique was the only wireless 
communication solution for millennia and the past 30 years 
have seen a significant improvement in two main areas: 
Outdoor applications, i.e., FSO (Free Space Optic), 
communications 
between 
satellites 
or 
ground/air 
transmission; and Indoor application like the remote 
controller and Light Fidelity (LiFi) system. Orange Labs has 
investigated, through open innovation, the potential for PmP 
(Point to multiPoint) indoor application of this technology. 
Light Fidelity solution may be a wireless alternative to radio 
systems and could gain attractiveness in case of saturation of 
the radio spectrum. The paper will present an overview of 
optical wireless communication technologies, the ecosystem 
and standards. Before conclusion, some use cases are 
presented.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Optical Wireless Communications (OWC) or Light 
Fidelity (LiFi) refer to communications based on the 
unguided propagation of electromagnetic radiation with 
frequencies over 30 THz [1]. The system performance 
(distance, coverage, etc.) is related to the propagation 
type, from the diffuse system, with wide field of view and 
low data rate (such as the remote controller) to Line Of 
Sight (LOS) systems, which could provide less coverage 
and higher data rates. 
Facing the growing needs for high data rate and 
wireless connectivity, estimated to 50 billion of devices 
by 2020 [2], LiFi is an alternative solution to the radio 
system with several advantages over “Light and 
Communication”: 
With a large and license free spectral availability, more 
than 700 000 GHz, this is an alternative solution to radio 
spectrum crunch mentioned by Ericsson and Cisco [3]. 
For the security aspect, light does not pass through 
walls and there is non-interference with radio devices. 
The radiofrequency wave customer sensitivity is 
growing in Europe with 46 % customers “concerned about 
potential health risk of electromagnetic fields” [4] and in 
the world with World Health Organization (WHO) 
radiofrequency classification (2B) means “Probably 
carcinogenic to humans” [5]. 
In the context of French Techimages [6] and European 
FP7 Omega [7] projects, studies and development have 
shown proofs of concept with, for instance, 16 LEDs on a 
ceiling broadcasting 100 Mbps on 5 m2 coverage; infrared 
prototype with high data rate bilateral solution (1.25 
Gbps) over 1 m2 coverage and 300 Mbps over 30 m2 
coverage. Currently, there is no available commercial 
product because availability and maturity of radio 
solutions currently do not leave market share for 
alternative solutions. Nevertheless, the LiFi market drives 
now several important economic players. 
II. 
LIFI MARKET 
The digital development was favored by games 
consoles and laptops specifically dedicated to the content 
management and internet connectivity. Smartphones and 
tablets come to complete the multimedia terminals 
landscape and constitute the newest trends. 
To propose OWC as an alternative to wireless systems, 
several specifications were finalized during the last years 
OWMAC [7], VLCC [8] and IrDA [9]. The IEEE 802.15.7 
[10] is the most active one with a recent revision process 
able to propose, at least, spectrum extension (infrared and 
ultraviolet) and Optical Communication for Camera 
(OCC) on smartphone or tablet.  
LiFi business has a lot of technical “bricks” already 
available, even if several visions exist according to the 
actors and their respective business sector (see Figure 1). 
• 
The LED lamp manufacturers area is still 
undergoing restructuring, especially in Europe. 
• 
LiFi 
manufacturers 
propose 
already 
some 
commercial products and services such as LBS 
(Location Base Service) or Broadcast solution. 
• 
Some devices manufacturer work to potentially 
integrate 
OCC 
and 
Emitter 
for 
LiFi 
communication. 
• 
Operators wish to enrich the offerings with new 
features and answer to users’ expectation.

III. 
CHALLENGES FOR TECHNOLOGY 
To become a successful story, LiFi systems need 
important levers adapted to users’ expectations or new use 
cases. 
The European Acemind [11] project worked on an 
analysis of European users’ point of view about LiFi, with 
brainstorming, face to face interviews and focus group 
sessions (France, Germany and Turkey). The main results 
are: 
• 
Despite Wifi satisfaction, customers expecting 
solutions face to its weakness: radiofrequency 
radiation, security management and reliability. 
• 
Users have quickly integrated the concept, it is 
intuitive (beam = communication) but their main 
request is focused on full duplex communication 
(symmetric or asymmetric) product. 
• 
However, there is still open questions: what about 
the installation to the ceiling, the integration to the 
device and the potential extra cost, is there any 
solution to have 5G outdoor communication and 
LiFi indoor communication with handover, how to 
manage no light and data, how to manage several 
LiFi lamps… 
Concerning the use cases, a lot of applications are not 
only dedicated to the home networking perimeter. For 
instance (see Figure 2), after LBS, Intelligent Transport 
Services (ITS) could be a massive application opportunity 
with low data rate by using LED lamps cars, traffic signal, 
traffic lights, and street lamps for communication [12]. 
Another potential application is Fast Content 
Delivery (FCD) for devices like smartphones or tablets on 
airports, trains or tube stations with LiFi solution. 
The application considered as the most promising one 
is the Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) or Indoor 
Networking in nomadism situation with LiFi lamp on 
ceiling and integrated LiFi module on smartphone, laptop 
or tablet. The first markets could be museums, banks, 
maternities or schools with high added value applications 
where precise location and/or minimum interference are 
expected with existing equipment and appliances. 
Currently, the video transmission is the “greediest” 
application in bandwidth, but the quality perceived by the 
customer is defined by first the screen size (laptop, tablet 
or smartphone). For those devices, an Orange Labs study 
[13] showed a video quality perception less discernible 
between a 720p and Full HD format over 14 inches screen 
size. This is equivalent to 5 Mbps data rate with Mpeg4 
(or H264) video file transmission format for one user.  In 
addition, it is advisable to take into account the next new 
coding formats such as HEVC (H265) [14]. With the 
same quality, the throughput can be reduced to 2.5 Mbps 
and with existing modulation solution (OFDM/DMT) the 
frequency baseband could be under 250 kHz. This 
modulation choice offers also a better resistance face to 
Inter Symbol Interference (ISI). 
One of the Acemind project goals is to propose a LiFi 
demonstrator with Oledcomm partner. The final objective 
is to provide an asymmetric bilateral communication with 
two devices, one coordinator in the ceiling and one device 
plugged to a tablet or a laptop. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
 
In this paper, we have presented a LiFi overview, 
the ecosystem and a standardization process. Some use 
cases have also been defined.

Now, companies want to “crossing the chasm” [15] 
and are looking for cost effective applications. Currently, 
LBS (Location Base Service) or Broadcast solution are 
commercially available. The next step could be a LiFi 
WLAN for B2B market with high added value on specific 
business cases and could grow towards mass market. In 
the long term, the LiFi could become an alternative 
solution to radio for wireless high data rate room 
connectivity and new adapted service, such as augmented 
or virtual reality.
