Abstract— This study was undertaken to quantify heart rate 
dynamics and interactions during sequential use of a postural-
respiration feedback regulation control system. The bent shape 
of the human back makes it easier to exhale air from the lungs, 
but challenging to inhale. On the other hand, when a human 
being leans over backwards, it becomes difficult to exhale, but 
easier to inhale. This simple feature opens up the possibility of 
regulating human breathing involuntarily through posture 
control. We developed and tested a postural-respiration 
feedback regulation control system. The process of the posture 
control architecture depends on an air chamber placed under 
the subject’s back. For this experiment, subjects had to lie on a 
bed, and the subjects’ respiration cycle was synchronized with 
the inflation and deflation of the air chamber. We analyzed the 
beat-to-beat heart rate and the continuous breathing signal data 
gathered from ten male university students. We investigated the 
hypothesis that the use of a synchronously controlled postural-
respiration feedback control system would yield positive 
psychophysiological benefits. The heart rate and respiratory 
dynamics from the deep breathing response and segmented 
breathing were similar. The results indicate that deep breathing 
was successfully induced when posture control was precisely 
synchronized with the subject’s own respiration. The 
implications of these findings for both future research and 
practice are addressed in a comprehensive discussion.

 INTRODUCTION 
Breathing is ventilation involving two stages: inspiration 
and expiration. The physiological background of breathing is 
the intake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide by the 
lungs. Breathing is essential to support bodily functions of 
human life. Breathing control has been accepted in modern 
society around the globe due to its numerous benefits in our 
daily life. Breathing control methods have become 
increasingly popular due to the growing significance of a 
holistic approach to healthcare. In this study, we have 
developed a new architecture for a breathing control system 
and investigated the efficacy of the system, which is based 
on our previous study regarding involuntary deep breathing 
by posture respiration feedback control system, published at 
ambient computing applications services and technologies 
2017 [1].  
A. Psychophysiological Benefits 
Breathing techniques are frequently used to change 
psychophysiological conditions and to improve organ 
function [2]. Voluntary breathing control improves task 
performance [3], alleviates anxiety [4]-[6], appropriately 
controls autonomous nervous system activities such as heart 
rate, blood pressure [7]-[10], and even immune system 
functions [11]-[13]. One study reported that the regular 
practice of slow breathing exercises for three months 
improves autonomic functions [14], and regular practice of 
breathing exercises have shown to decrease sympathetic 
activity and increase vagal tone [15] [16]. Additionally, 
breathing-related disorders may be dangerous to our daily 
life, e.g., obstructive sleep apnea is a prominent risk factor 
for cardiovascular disease [17]. 
B. Yoga Training and Meditation  
There are a variety of methods that have been developed 
for breathing control such as yoga training and spiritual 
meditation. Yoga training that uses voluntary breathing 
control methods is called pranayama [18]. Pranayama 
involves inhalation, holding, and exhalation, which can be 
performed either quickly or slowly. Such breathing training 
can affect oxygen consumption and metabolism [19]. The 
benefits of pranayama include improving cardiovascular 
indicators and respiratory functions through increasing vagal 
tone, decreasing sympathetic discharges, and reducing stress 
[18] [20]. Additionally, spiritual meditation can be used for 
breathing control. A slow breathing method is used by Zen 
monks while performing Zazen meditation [21]. The 
voluntary breathing control methods used decrease 
awareness of breathing, create controlled and even breaths, 
increase mindfulness, and improve respiratory performance. 
C.  Benefits of Deep Breathing  
Numerous studies have suggested that deep breathing 
exercises have beneficial psychological effects. These 
studies demonstrate how relaxed, slow, deep breathing 
significantly reduces negative emotions [22], and yogic deep 
breathing represses working memory [23]. Additionally, 
deep 
breathing 
techniques 
have 
been 
successfully 
implemented to enhance academic performance [24]. One

study proposed that controlled deep breathing is beneficial 
for relieving withdrawal symptoms after giving up smoking 
[25]. Another study stated that the investigations recognized 
how deep breathing progressively improves ventilation 
efficiency for oxygen [26]. Deep breathing supports 
quietening of the mind and body, which can provide 
psychological and physical benefits. 
D. Breathing Control in Clinical Setting  
Breathing control has numerous applications in clinical 
settings. Buteykyo breathing can be one of the most helpful 
techniques for asthma patients [27]. Using radiotherapy 
along with deep inspiration with active breathing control may 
decrease standard tissue irradiation in Hodgkin’s disease 
patients [28]. Training pregnant women in breathing methods 
is an effective technique for decreasing anxiety, which can 
influence the duration of the delivery during labor [29]. 
Another study suggested that the use of deep breathing 
exercises was helpful after cardiac surgery for first stage 
patients [30]. Deep breathing exercises and walking have an 
advantageous effect on the heart rate variability in patients 
hospitalized for chronic heart failure [31]. In addition to 
voluntary breathing control, passive ventilation equipment 
has been developed and has proven to be useful [32] [33]. 
E. Contribution of the Automatic Nervous System  
The autonomic nervous system influences breathing. In 
the background of the breathing pattern, the autonomic 
nervous system maintains control of the lungs through 
ventilation and the gas exchange method, which is the result 
of the electrical stimulation of nerves and correct 
physiological stimulus [34]. The autonomic nervous system 
controls the heart, smooth muscles, and endocrine/exocrine 
glands. It has both an afferent and an efferent segment [35]. 
The main branches of the autonomic nervous system are 
identified 
as 
sympathetic 
and 
parasympathetic. 
In 
sympathetic stimulation, the heart rate increases, whereas in 
parasympathetic stimulation, the heart rate decreases [36].  
The primary characteristic of the autonomic nervous system 
is that it maintains balance in the body under varying 
conditions. The hypothalamus can control the body using 
three different methods. Apart from the ANS, the 
hypothalamus regulates the endocrine system and a neural 
system concerned with motivation [37]. It has three main 
branches: sympathetic, parasympathetic, and central. On a 
fundamental level, the whole autonomic framework is 
independent and distantly associated with the other parts of 
the sensory system. 
F. Electrocardiography 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) data is used commonly for 
monitoring the clinical diagnosis of cardiac function. The 
ECG signal measures the change in electrical potential over 
the time. Recently, researchers have been able to apply 
digital signal analysis to the ECG data [38]. Calculating and 
analyzing ECG signal and time interval of QRS complex 
existing with in the range between P-Q and Q-T 
corresponding to different part of the heart behaviors. R 
complex is the most important point of the QRS complex 
because several heart beats define R complex as the peek 
point. Further, beat to beat distance is measured by the 
milliseconds between each other R complexes as the RR 
interval. Numerical studies of the cardio system have been 
using ECG data for more complex diagnostic interpretations 
[39]. 
G. Background of Heart Rate Variability 
Heart rate variability (HRV) is the measure of beat-to-
beat differences in the heart rate influence based on the rate 
of release of the pacemaker, generally sinus-atrial node. 
HRV has been used to estimate and investigate cardiac 
autonomic behaviors in the several fields as clinical, 
physiological interpretation and process of ECG. HRV can 
be measured in a wide range of time intervals, such as for a 
short 2-minute interval or an extended period of 24 hours. 
HRV can be used to analyze Cardiac arrhythmia conditions 
by using the time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear 
methods [40].  
Time domain variable calculation involves the mean 
peak-to-peak interval (RR interval). The standard deviation 
of the RR intervals, or SDRR, is frequently used as an index 
of sympathetic nervous system activity. 
The frequency-domain measure is obtained using the 
Fast-Fourier transform method. The power of the heart rate 
variation includes both high frequency (HF) and low 
frequency (LF) ranges. The HF commonly range from 0.15 
to 0.40 Hz, while the LF commonly range from 0.05 to 0.15 
Hz. The heart rate variation in the HF segment is considered 
to be an index of parasympathetic nervous system activity 
[41]. The LF segment reflects both sympathetic and 
parasympathetic nervous system activity, so the rate LF/HF 
is frequently introduced as an index of sympathetic–vagal 
balance [42].  
H. Hypothesis and Objective of this Study  
As stated earlier, breathing control can bring positive 
psychological and physiological effects. However, there are 
some limitations in both voluntary and passive breathing 
control methods. First of all, voluntary breathing control 
requires significant effort and concentration by the patient, 
and it is difficult to continue over a long period of time, 
especially for the elderly. Additionally, passive ventilation, 
such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [32] and 
adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) [33] require patients to be 
fitted with a nasal cannula or respirator, so it is not suitable 
for daily use at home. 
Therefore, in this study, we propose an alternative 
method for semi-passive breathing control via posture 
control. The idea is based on the bent shape of the human 
backbone making it easier to exhale but challenging to inhale. 
However, when a human being is leaning backwards, it 
becomes difficult to exhale, but easier to inhale. This simple 
feature opens the possibility to regulate human breathing

involuntarily through posture control. Based on this simple 
idea, we developed a postural-respiration feedback 
regulation control system and tested the efficacy of the 
proposed architecture.  
We developed an architecture that forces the user to 
change their posture synchronously with their own breathing 
cycle. In the next section, the architecture of the developed 
system and the procedure of the experiment to test the 
efficacy of the system are described. The following sections 
describe the results of the experiment, discussion, and 
conclusion. 
 
METHOD 
This study aimed to develop an involuntary postural-
respiration 
feedback regulation control 
system. 
We 
concentrated on the fact, that changing posture affects 
respiration. This physical condition of the bent shape of the 
human back makes it easier to exhale, but challenging to 
inhale. However, when a person is leaning backwards, it is 
difficult to exhale but easier to inhale. The idea of posture 
affecting respiration opens the possibility for breathing 
control by changing posture. To verify this idea, we 
developed a postural-respiration feedback regulation control 
system. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the system. 
A. Materials   
In this system a silicon air chamber is placed beneath the 
subject’s back. The air chamber is synchronized to 
deflate/inflate according to the subject’s own respiration 
cycle. For example, when a subject starts inhaling/exhaling, 
the air-chamber starts to inflate/deflate to assist the user in 
inhalation/exhalation of the air into/from the lungs.  
The basic architecture of this system is shared with our 
previous studies [43]. A thermistor sensor detects the 
subject’s respiration pattern in a time series. This analogue 
for respiration is amplified and digitized by analog-to-digital 
converter (NI USB-6008 DAQ, National Instruments Co., 
USA), and transmitted to the feedback regulator. The 
feedback regulator, developed with a visual programming 
language (LabVIEW, National Instruments Co., USA), 
controls the air flow to the chamber using a pair of air pumps 
(YP-20A, Yasunaga Air Pump Inc., Japan) and a switching 
circuit to regulate the volume of the air chamber.  
With this adaptive architecture, we assume that such an 
adaptive intervention to the posture would make the subject’s 
breathing deeper and longer, and the subject would be more 
relaxed in body and mind. To test our hypothesis, we 
conducted an experiment with three different respiratory 
intervention conditions: 1) the air-chamber inflates and 
deflates synchronously with subject’s inhalation and 
exhalation (called “SNC” hereafter); 2) the air-chamber 
asynchronously inflates and deflates with breathing: inflating 
when the subject exhales and inflating when the subject 
inhales (called “ASN” hereafter); and 3) the air-chamber 
inflates and deflates with a constant rhythm (called “CST” 
hereafter). In SNC and ASN conditions, the inflation and 
Figure 1.   Schematic diagram of the posture-respiration feedback  
regulation control system. 
deflation cycle of the air-chamber is precisely determined by 
the subject’s respiration steps, whereas in the CST condition,  
the cycle of the air chamber is set to the same duration as 
each subject’s mean deep breathing cycle, which has been 
determined in advance.  
Figure 2 shows an example of the respiration pattern and 
the movement of the air chamber regulated in the three 
different conditions. In the SNC condition, when the subject 
inhales, the air chamber continues to inflate and when the 
subject exhales the air chamber continues to deflate. 
Accordingly, the air chamber inflates and deflates 
synchronously with the subject’s respiration pattern.  
Figure 3 shows how the posture of a subject changes 
with the inflation and deflation of the air chamber placed 
under the subject’s back. It should be noted that the 
movement of the air chamber and following change in the 
posture in this image is exaggerated to illustrate how the 
system works. The actual movement of the air chamber and 
the change in the posture, was smaller than in this image in 
order to not place any burden on the subjects.

Compared with SNC, the ASN condition shows the 
opposite pattern as the air chamber asynchronously inflates 
and deflates with subject’s inhalation and exhalation. In the 
CST condition, the air chamber inflates and deflates with a 
constant rhythm determined by each subject’s mean deep 
breathing cycle.

B. Experiment 
Subjects (n = 10) were male university students (age 22-
24) and they voluntarily participated in this experiment. All 
subjects were rated for their health condition, and they had no 
heart or breathing related health problems. The study was 
conducted following ethical principles and informed consent 
was obtained from all subjects. The study was approved by 
the ethics committee of the Nagaoka University of 
Technology. 
Figure 4 shows the experiment protocol. The experiment 
consisted of a 1-minute initial rest period, followed by 15 
minutes of the intervention period, and another 10-minute rest 
period (recovery period). The total experiment time was 26 
minutes. The postural-respiration feedback control system 
functioned only during the intervention period. A thermistor 
sensor measured respiration of the subjects. The heartbeat 
signal was measured by an electrocardiogram (ECG) with a 
bio-signal amplifier system (MP150, BIOPAC Systems, Inc., 
USA) to evaluate the cardio-physiological functioning by the 
postural-respiration intervention. The subject was instructed 
to lie on the bed with the rubber air chamber placed under the 
subject’s back. In this experiment, the heart rate (HR) and the 
high frequency (HF) component of its variation were 
measured using the ECG data. The experiment was conducted 
in a within-subject design such that each participant went 
through all three conditions in one trial per day in a 
randomized order. 
 
 
RESULTS 
The postural-respiration feedback regulation control 
system (Figures 2 and 3) produced results in the dynamic 
change in the beat-to-beat respiration interval (RI) and 
respiration amplitude (RA) of the respiration during the 
intervention period. Figures 5 through 8 show standardized 
values to compensate for the large variation among the 
individuals (Z-score). Figure 5 shows that RI response and the 
segment breathing induced significantly longer respiration 
(RI: p < 0.01) in the SNC condition. For the RA, Figure 6 
shows a deeper response (RA: p < 0.01) in SNC condition. 
This means that in the intervention period the subject’s 
respiration effectively synchronized with the air-chamber. 
Compared to the recovery period, the interval and amplitude 
were significantly changed during the intervention duration.

Figure 9. The ratio of RRI change.  
 
 
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, in ASN condition the 
subject’s breathing was remarkably restricted in intervention 
period. While, in CST condition, the change in respiration is 
in between SNC and ASN as shown in the graphs. The 
frequency analysis of the heart rate variability was used to 
evaluate the postural-respiration feedback system. Figures 7 
and 8 show the results of the change in the heart rate (HR) and 
high frequency (HF: 0.15 - 0.40 Hz) component of the HRV. 
As seen in Figure 7, HR did not significantly change in any of 
the three conditions (p > 0.05) during the intervention period. 
However, HR in the recovery period in ASN was significantly 
higher than that of other conditions (p < 0.01), and it reached 
a higher value than the initial rest period (overshoot). With 
regard to the HF component in the SNC condition as shown 
in Figure 8, it was the lowest during the intervention period 
and recovery period (p < 0.01).  
Cardiac vagal activity was measured by the ECG 
recording, and the HRV was calculated from this data. The

HF component of the HRV in SNC condition has an 
instantaneous R-R interval (RRI) result shown in Figure 9. 
The R-R interval data has been analyzed to identify vagal 
activation with inclusion of feedback SNC, non-feedback 
ASN, and control CST during the experiment period. The 
average values of the RRI data during the Rest 1, Intervention, 
and Rest 2 periods were calculated. The ratio of the x is 
obtained by dividing the value of RRI when the average 
value is 0. The RRI results are shown by pie charts in Figure 
9, either x < 0.9, 0.9 ≤ x ≤ 1.1, or 1.1 < x values. The results 
of the statistical test are show in Table I. Heart rate variability 
and Rest 2 periods tended to increase in all intervention 
conditions in the feedback period, and there was a significant 
difference between SNC and ASN (0.9 ≤ x ≤ 1.1) and 
between ASN and CST (0.9 < x < 1.1) in the Rest 2 period 
the results with a p value p < 0.05. These results show vagal 
activity of the HF component. The results from the rest 
periods without movement of the chamber also show cardiac 
vagal activation.

DISCUSSION 
In this study, the impact of the postural-respiration 
feedback control system on respiration and autonomous 
cardiac system function was investigated. The hypothesis 
examined the efficacy of the proposed architecture 
accompanied by three different respiratory intervention 
conditions. Our results were as expected in SNC condition, 
meaning that the subject’s respiration (inhalation/exhalation) 
synchronized 
with 
air 
chamber 
inflation/deflation 
successfully. The results of Figures 5 and 6 show (RI: p < 
0.01) that respiration was made significantly longer, (RA: p 
< 0.01) and significantly deeper. This result implies that the 
developed posture control system can induce deep breathing 
unconsciously. 
However, in ASN condition where the posture regulation 
was administered asynchronously with respiration (i.e., the 
phase delay is 180 degrees), there was no change in the 
respiration interval and amplitude. Among the components, 
moreover, in the recovery period (Rest 2), an overshooting of 
HR was observed in ASN condition. HR overshooting is 
frequently observed in the recovery period after mild 
exercise [44]. It occurs to meet the requirement of balancing 
the greater oxygen cost of fat catabolism during the early 
recovery period. It may be that if the HR overshoot seen in 
this study shares part of the same background with that of 
after exercise, it might reflect a lack of oxygen during the 
intervention period. Despite the large effort of doing 
respiration, whether it be intentional or unconscious, ASN 
condition made breathing difficult, and this phenomenon 
misled the body into believing that the concentration of air 
oxygen was “low”, resulting in a higher requirement for 
oxygen after intervention (during “normal” circumstances). 
In CST, the impact on respiration and cardiac autonomous 
system were marginal compared to SNC and ASN, and the 
breathing seemed to be gradually entrained with the constant 
rhythm. The cycle of the air chamber movement in CST was 
fixed at the same duration as each subject’s mean deep 
breathing cycle, so subjects might modulate their breathing 
cycle voluntarily to their deep breathing. However, the 
interval and amplitude of the respiration in SNC reached far 
beyond CST. In this sense, our developed posture-respiration 
intervention architecture has demonstrated a prominent 
impact on the respiration. 
However, HF in SNC was strongly suppressed as shown in 
Figure 8. The HF component of the heart rate variability has 
been frequently taken as an index of cardiac parasympathetic 
nervous system activation [45]. However, as demonstrated in 
Figure 9 and Table I, the change in RR-interval, i.e., the 
variation of the instant heart rate, was prominent in SNC. 
Therefore, it is unable to interpret the result of our study as 
the SNC condition suppressing parasympathetic nervous 
activity.  
The physiological background of the above mentioned 
phenomenon is the relationship between deep breathing and 
cardiac behavior. The central school of thought in physiology 
discusses on how respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and 
cardiac vagal tone contribute to the heart rate. In the normal 
condition of RSA in the respiratory process, the HR increases 
during inspiration and decreases during expiration; this is 
called RSA. Sinus arrhythmia is a normal physiological 
phenomenon most typically seen in young, healthy people. 
RSA can be utilized as the key to understanding the cardiac 
vagal tone and contributes to heart rate variability [46]. RSA 
has been shown to significantly contribute to the rhythmic 
waxing and waning of cardiac vagal efferent effects upon the 
sinoatrial 
node 
and, 
therefore, the 
heart rate [47]. 
The respiratory rate and tidal volume produce independent 
and interactive effects [48]. This physiological background 
contributes to the understanding of the breathing process as a 
gas 
exchange 
mechanism. 
Numerous 
studies 
have 
documented how gas exchange productivity improves with 
deep breathing and increased mean heart rate, but in this 
process it is unconnected to the RSA contribution. Among 
the studies mentioned, HR was remarkably similar to RSA 
with slow and deep breaths [49]. 
The result of the posture control system we developed 
showed that deep breathing was successful at producing the 
123

desired effects. If the participant were to breathe in deeply, 
the heart rate would increase. That is because the heart is 
making the most of a fresh supply of oxygen to the lungs and 
sending a ration of blood through the lungs to receive the 
oxygen. When breathing out, it is more energy-efficient for 
the heart not to pump as fast, because there is less oxygen 
available in the lungs. This reaction, controlled by the brain, 
detects a slight change in the gas composition of the blood. 
This is detected and sent by the vagus nerve to the sinoatrial 
node. That node cell is at the top of the heart. The node works 
as a heart pacemaker meaning that the heart rate is changed 
by a deep breath. In this study, the heart rate condition did 
not significantly change during the conditions (p > 0.05) in 
the intervention period, but it seems that a deep breath with 
gas exchange changes the cardiac mechanism by means of 
RSA. From the above, it can be concluded that deep 
breathing gives rise to RSA that is more pronounced than 
standard RSA. In the HF analysis using the HRV method, the 
response is about 0.3 Hz (HF). Additionally, it seems that the 
HF component of the SNC condition has decreased. 
Frequency domain analysis is the most accurate method of 
discovering correlations between the HF and LF components 
and autonomic activation. HRV measures can be associated 
with several cardiac functions with the assumption of 
sympathetic or parasympathetic activation. Normally, the LF 
condition is associated with sympathetic activation. 
Generally, the HF component is associated with vagal 
modulation and respiration because HF is dependent on the 
respiration pattern. 
In our study, the high-frequency component of the RR 
interval results indicated cardiac vagal activation in the HF 
component. These results are shown in Figure 9. The changes 
in RR intervals describe the cardiac vagal activation during 
the intervention period and the rest period. These results are 
a valuable part of this study because the vagal activation 
response 
contributes 
both 
physiological 
[50] 
and 
psychological benefits. The vagus nerves also control the 
central part of the parasympathetic nervous system. Their 
influence on breathing, digestive function, and heart rate has 
an impact on mental health conditions. 
A. Limitation 
This study was conducted in a within-subject manner 
with randomized order which can free from group effect. 
However, the small sample size (n = 10) with homogeneous 
population limits the generalization of the interpretation of 
the results. The strength of posture control, i.e., the air 
pressure in the air chamber, was not varied regardless of the 
attribute of each subjects, which can also form the limitation 
of this study 
B. Implications and Future Research 
Using this architecture, inspired by involuntary deep 
breathing, can create psychophysiological benefits. After the 
development and modification of a clinical instrument, this 
posture control system can be used for clinical treatment for 
patients with respiration problems. Further, in future 
investigations, psychological and physiological changes 
can be evaluated using the different types of parameters with 
a more significant number of subjects. In the future, it is 
expected that this posture control system can be developed 
and improved as a stress-reducing mechanism with an 
involuntary breathing control and as a health product for 
the global market. Future research using this architecture will 
improve psychophysiological benefits through an involuntary 
deep breathing and inspiration.  
 
 
CONCLUSION 
In summary, we tested the efficacy of our postural-control 
respiration intervention system in the manner of real-time 
feedback regulation. The results indicate that deep breathing 
is successfully induced when the posture control is precisely 
synchronized with the user’s own respiration. Regarding the 
impact on cardiac function, HR overshoot was observed as 
the 
after 
effect 
of 
asynchronous 
regulation. 
We 
found this from the results of cardiac vagal activation. 
Further physiological study promises to reveal the 
background mechanism of the impact of our system.
