Abstract—The complex Switch and Stay Combining/Maximal 
Ratio Combining (SSC/MRC) combiner is considered in this 
paper. The system output signal at two time instants is 
observed in the presence of Nakagami-m fading at the input. 
Both of combiners, SSC and MRC, are with two branches. The 
probability density function (PDF) at the output of the complex 
combiner is obtained and the bit error rate (BER) for the case 
of binary phase swift keying (BPSK) modulation is determined. 
The obtained results are shown graphically. It was pointed out 
the improvement of using complex SSC/MRC combiner 
relative to classical MRC and SSC combiners at one time 
instant.

INTRODUCTION 
The fading, the occurrence of variation of instantaneous 
value of the received signal envelope, is one of the very 
important factors of signal quality derogation at the 
reception. Many urban and vehicular communication 
systems are subjected to fading caused by multipath 
propagation due to reflection, refraction and scattering by 
buildings and other large structures [1]. The received signal 
is, thus, a sum of different signals that arrive via different 
propagation paths. 
Several statistical models have been used in the literature 
to describe the fading envelope of the received signal [2]-[8]. 
The Rayleigh and Rician distributions are used to 
characterize the envelope of faded signals over small 
geographical areas or sort term fades, while the log-normal 
distribution is used when much wider geographical areas are 
involved. A more versatile statistical model, however, is 
Nakagami-m-distribution [7], which can model a variety of 
fading environments including those modelled by the 
Rayleigh and one-sided Gaussian distributions. Also the log-
normal 
and 
Rician 
distributions 
may 
be 
closely 
approximated by the Nakagami distribution in some ranges 
of mean signal values [2]. The fit between Nakagami and 
Rician distributions may not be very good when the signal- 
noise ratio (SNR) is large, but is very accurate for low SNR 
values. Furthermore, the Nakagami distribution is more 
flexible and more accurately fit experimental data for many 
physical propagation channels then the log-normal and 
Rician distributions [2], [3]. Although the Nakagami model 
fits experimental data around the mean or median, it does not 
fit very well in the tails of the distribution. For this reason, 
some researchers question the use of the Nakagami model 
[4]; however, there is continued interest in modelling a 
variety of propagation channels with the Nakagami 
distribution [2], [3]. Moreover, in [9] Braun and Dersch give 
a detailed derivation of the Nakagami distribution and show 
that it is quite appropriate to model multipath fading in the 
mobile radio channel. 
There are several ways to reduce the impact of fading on 
system performances. The goal is to achieve this without 
increasing the signal power and channel capacity. The 
diversity reception techniques are used extensively in fading 
radio channels to reduce the effects of fading on system 
performances [6], [10], and [11], including both fixed 
terminals and mobile communication systems.  
In order to gain significantly from the use of diversity, 
there must be a sufficient degree of statistical independence 
in the fading of the received signal in each of the diversity 
branches. The assumption of statistical independence 
between the diversity channels is valid only if they are 
sufficiently separated [2]. In mobile radio systems the signals 
at the mobile station become decorrelated as the antenna 
separation (or frequency separation) increases, giving rise to 
diversity. If the antennas are crowded then such diversity 
conditions may be violated [8]. In space diversity systems an 
antenna separation of 30 to 50 wavelengths is typically 
required to obtain correlation coefficients strictly between 
zero and one-third, in which case, for a two-channel 
maximal-ratio system in a Rayleigh-fading environment, the 
effect of correlation may be ignored [10]. 
However, there are other cases of practical interest where 
the assumption of statistical independence is not valid. When 
the Nakagami channel is studied, the analysis is usually 
limited to the dual-branch diversity system [12]. A long time 
ago Al-Hussani and Al-Bassion studied the effect of 
correlation on the performance of a dual-branch maximal-
ratio combiner for the correlated Nakagami-fading channel. 
They found that for the Nakagami-fading environment and 
for a worst case fading condition and identical signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) in each of the two branches, the 
performance difference between a single channel and the two 
channels system increases from 3 to 24 dB as the correlation 
coefficient decreases from unity to zero.

RELATED WORK 
In diversity systems multiple copies of the same signal 
are sending. They are combined in different ways in order to 
obtain as larger as possible signal to noise ratio. There are 
some kinds of diversity combining schemes. 
Maximal-Ratio Combining (MRC) is the optimal 
combining scheme [13]. In this combiner signals from all 
inputs are summed. Because MRC requires cognition of the 
channel fading parameters, it is the most complicated and 
expensive combining model [14], [15].  
Equal Gain Combining (EGC) is next and then Selection 
Combining (SC) and Switch and Stay Combining (SSC), 
with lower performances. These combining models are 
simpler and cheaper and they are very often implemented in 
practice whereas SC and SSC combining models do not 
require signal cophasing and fading envelope evaluation 
[16]. 
SSC is simplification of the system complexity, but with 
losing in quality. In this model, the receiver selects an 
antenna until its value drops below predetermined threshold. 
Then, the receiver switches to other antenna and remains for 
the next time slot, no matter the channel quality of that 
antenna is above or below the threshold. In the literature, 
mainly dual SSC schemes have been analyzed [17], [18]. 
By the authors' knowledge in the new open literature, 
except from papers published by this group of authors, there 
are no papers that treat these problems by sampling in the 
two time instants. We derived the expression for the joint 
probability density function of the SSC combiner output 
signal in the presence of different fading distributions 
(Nakagami, log-normal, Hoyt) in two time instants [19]-[21]. 
Based on these joint PDFs we made the performance 
analysis of SSC/SC combiner at two time instants in the 
presence of Rayleigh and log-normal fading in [22], [23]. 
The bit error rates for SSC/MRC combiner at two time 
instants in the presence of log-normal, Rayleigh and Hoyt 
fading we determined in [24]-[26], respectively. 
In this paper the probability density function and the bit 
error rate of the SSC/MRC combiner output signal in the 
presence of Nakagami-m fading, with sampling signals at 
two time instants for one time slot, will be observed. The 
system is more complex then classical MRC and SSC 
systems at one time instant, but with better performances. 
That means that bit error rate can be increased and transmit 
power can be reduced comparing to classical systems.  
This paper is organized as follows: II Section gives 
related works; III Section describes the complex SSC/MRC 
system model and the process of obtaining the probability 
density functions and the bit error rate of the SSC/MRC 
combiner output signal at two time instants. Sections IV 
presents numerical results obtained for performances 
introduced in previous section. Finally, the main results of 
the paper are presented in V Section as conclusions.

COMPLEX SSC/MRC COMBINER MODEL 
The model of the SSC/MRC combiner with two inputs 
considering in this paper is shown in Fig. 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.   Complex dual SSC/MRC combiner. 
We consider the SSC/MRC combiner with two branches 
at two time instants. The signals at the inputs at SSC 
combiner are r11 and r21 at first time moment and they are r12 
and r22 at the second time moment. The output signals at 
SSC part are r1 and r2. The indexes for the input signals are: 
first index is the number of the branch and the other signs 
time instant observed. For the output signals, the index 
represents the time instant observed. After determining the 
output signals at SSC combiner r1 and r2, they become the 
inputs at MRC combiner and the overall output signal is r. 
The joint probability density function of correlated 
signals r1 and r2 at the output of SSC combiner at two time 
inputs with Nakagami-m distribution and for the same 
parameters, is obtained in [19].

NUMERICAL RESULTS  
The bit error rate curves, for different types of combiners 
and correlation parameters, are presented in Fig.2 and 3. It is 
assumed that both inputs have the same channel parameters. 
rt is the optimal threshold for the SSC decision [8]:

The BER family curves for one channel receiver, for 
MRC combiner at one time instant and for SSC/MRC 
combiner at two time instants for uncorrelated case, and also 
for very strong correlation, are shown in Fig. 2 versus 
different distribution parameter. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Bit error rate for different types of combiners versus 
parameter m , for Ω=0.5 
 
One can see from this figure that SSC/MRC combiner 
has significant better performances for uncorrelated case 
then MRC combiner at one time instant. For ρ =1 the BER 
of SSC/MRC combiner follows the results for MRC 
combiner.  
It is obvious that using of complex SSC/MRC combiner 
results in better performance of the system because the BER 
for uncorrelated SSC/MRC combiner decrease for about 
50% regarding MRC combiner.

Figure 3.  Bit error rate for SSC/MRC combiner versus  parameter m  
for Ω=0.5,  for different values of ρ 
 
The influence of correlation to the outage probability of 
complex SSC/MRC combiner is presented in Fig. 3. The 
benefits of using this type of combiner increases with 
decreasing of correlation between input signals. It is apparent 
that there is no economic justification for the use of complex 
SSC/MRC combiner in the case of strong correlations 
between input signals.

CONCLUSIONS 
The SSC and MRC are simple and frequently used 
techniques for signal combining in diversity systems. The 
probability density function of complex dual SSC/MRC 
combiner output signal, at two time instants, is determined in 
this paper. The bit error probability is expressed based on it. 
The system performances deciding by two samples can 
be determine by the joint probability density function of the 
SSC combiner output signal at two time instants and putting 
them as inputs of MRC combiner. The obtained results are 
shown graphically. The performance improvement of 
SSC/MRC combiner at two time instants, comparing with 
classical SSC and MRC combiners, is described.
