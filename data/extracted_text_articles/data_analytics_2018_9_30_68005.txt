Abstract— Flexible transit services, such as Route Deviation
Bus, or RDB, match the features of fixed-haul traditional
transit and demand-responsive service. They have been proven
to be efficient on the grounds of both cost and performance in
many low-density residential areas. This paper deals with a
special form of advanced public transport operations, which is
known by different names, such as route deviation line, point
deviation bus line, corridor deviation line and checkpoint dial-
a-ride. We present the results of a design analysis performed
on a real network using a model proposed for the Route
Deviation Bus problem, which is based on mixed integer linear
programming.
The
study
network
is
located
in
Campi
Bisenzio, a small town in the surroundings of Florence (Italy).
This urban area is characterized by a low level of the transit
demand for the major part of the day. Two decades ago, the
traditional line-haul system has been replaced with a mixed
advance request and immediate request Dial-a-Ride system. In
this paper, first, the RDB problem is briefly summarized.
Second, the model is applied to the real case of Campi Bisenzio
and the results drawn from the model application are shown in
comparison with the existing on-demand service management
as a mixed operations Dial-a-Ride system. We simulated the
RDB service operating in the actual scenario and then we
compared the two different operations modes, calculating their
respective values in a set of performance indexes. In such a
study case, the existing mixed Dial-a-Ride operations mode
results are better than the switching to a route deviation bus
service. However, this result seems to be highly influenced by
the
particular
frame
of
the
underlying
street
network.
Nevertheless, we can view the obtained results as a meaningful
trial performed on a real scale that highlights boundaries and
better defines the application domain of the more frequently
applied new RDB service operations for the low transit
demand management. Finally, our results show that a route
deviation strategy is more suitable to accommodate rejected
requests, that is, those for which it is impossible to schedule the
call, than any Dial-a-Ride strategy.

INTRODUCTION
There are some transport systems that serve a low
demand in time and/or in space. In such cases, the optimal
service strategy must be suited in a way as to follow the
demand.
Many types of transport systems operate under the so-
called “demand responsive” manner. Among them, there is
the route deviation system, also called Route Deviation Bus,
or RDB, line. The RDB system consists of a number of
tracks pertaining to the main route, and of other tracks
pertaining to deviations. Passengers can be grouped in three
different clusters: in the first cluster there are passengers
boarding at main route stops that come before the deviate
stop; the second cluster groups passengers alighting at main
route stops that follow the deviate stop; the third cluster
counts passengers at the deviate stop.
Such a classification leads directly to understanding that
every objective function for the RDB problem must have at
least two terms: the first one is the disutility that deviations
impose, as an extra in-vehicle time, on passengers of the
main route; the second one is the amount of benefit attained
from those passengers that use deviated stops. The operating
mode of RDB will be reviewed in short in the following
section.
Major advantages of a route deviation service include:
- Increasing of the area served by a vehicle ;
- Better service productivity, through reducing empty
vehicle trips;
- Improving system accessibility, by shortening walking
distances.
However, this flexibility has an upper bound in terms of
increase of the timetable adherence variance for base line, or
main route, stops. Nevertheless, until now and as far as we
know,
the RDB problem has received
little research
contributions as mathematical model formulation when
compared to the fixed line-haul problem. Studies of route
deviation
systems
are
reported
in
Bredendiek
and
Kratschmer [1], Filippi et al. [2], Daganzo [3], Pratelli and
Schoen [4]. More recently, Qui and coworkers [5] identify as
demi-flexible operation the policy group between flexible
and fixed-route transit systems. Shen et al. [6] proposed a
two-stage model to minimize the total cost of a flexible
transit service operating as a demand responsive connector
system with on-demand stations. The review made by
Ronald and co-workers [7] investigates the application of an
agent-based approach for simulating demand responsive
transport systems. Lu et al. [8] presented a flexible feeder
transit routing model suited for irregular-shaped networks.
Lee and Savelsberg [9] investigated a flexible transport
system known as a demand responsive connector, which
transports commuters from residential addresses to transit

hubs via a shuttle service, from where they continue their
journey
via
a
traditional
timetabled
service.
Finally,
Papanikolaou et al. [10] compiled a critical overview of the
literature on the modeling issues related to flexible transit
systems at strategic and operational levels.
Diana et al. [11] compared the performance in terms of
the distance traveled of a conventional fixed-route transit
system and of a demand responsive service. Different models
were proposed to study the design of feeder transit services
by comparing a demand-responsive service and a fixed-route
policy [12].
The main task of this paper is to offer to transit planners
an experimental contribution to make their choice between
specific transit services for flex-route policy. Moreover,
because many traditional fixed-haul transit systems in low-
demand areas are switching to flex-route services, this paper
intends to help towards the choice between alternative flex-
route transit strategies suited for situations that have a low
and sparse user demand.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the RDB
operations are described, while in Section III, the RDB
problem is depicted in its mixed integer linear programming
formulation [4]. In Section IV, an actual on-demand transit
service scenario has been simulated as an RDB operating
mode and then compared to the real mixed operations Dial-a-
Ride system management. Section V ends the paper with a
comment about the resulting comparison evidence based on
the respective value set of performance indexes.
II.
THE ROUTE DEVIATION BUS OPERATING MODE
The RDB, or demand-responsive service on set routes, is
a transversal transit system that distributes and collects
passengers in the crossed blocks supporting the main, or
fixed, routes along radials and arterials.
RDB operation has been proposed and applied in order to
enhance effectiveness of line-haul transit during off-peak
periods, as well-suited service for small towns or as a
component of a larger integrated transit system [13][14].
One of the main elements of such a system is the so-
called equipped bus stop, or terminal, which accepts user
subscriptions and makes the bus deviate from its main route
(Figure 1).
Indeed, the terminal core is a control unit, which
interfaces other local devices, such as “detour traffic lights”,
keys and displays. The user interface is a graphic screen,
usually LCD display, plus few functional keys, which guide
the user in his/her choice of menus. The calling terminal also
informs users about the timetable and lines of the urban
service, the expected time of arrival of the next bus and
delays.
Periodically, each terminal consults the “detour traffic
lights” and updates its forecast time-of-passage table with the
new received data.
After having read the time of passage on the screen, the
passenger may insert a coin or a smart-card to confirm his
reservation. The terminal stores the subscriptions and sends a
switching signal to the proper detour traffic light. There are
two such detour traffic lights on the base route, one for each
direction, close to the “detour point”.
When a detour point is active, the control system sends a
message to the on-coming vehicle, which informs the driver
about the need of making a deviation. When the bus reaches
the equipped bus stop, data are reset in the control system.
This operation closes the cycle and detects whether or not the
reserved service was actually given. The control system can
record vehicle passages at detour points and at on-call
terminals, so it can compute the actual mileage day by day.

III.
THE RDB PROBLEM
Let us consider the problem faced by the bus route
planner when designing a bus route with optional stopping,
as described in the previous sections.
In this section, we shall deal with a simplified model and
we will describe in brief a mathematical programming
model, built in order to help the decision maker. We assume
that a bus route has been designed regarding to the main
stops served by the bus route. What remains to be decided is
the location of the optional bus stops whose are served on a
demand basis. A trade-off has to be found between the
interest of passengers located at these extra bus stops, and
the augmented travel time suffered both from passengers on
the bus whose route is deviated, and from passengers waiting
for the bus at regular stops downstream the deviation.
We assume, for simplicity, that the bus route has the
characteristics of a “feeder” line (i.e., many-to-one), that is
supposed to be true for all the stops, except for the last one
where no passenger leaves the bus. This way, we do not need
origin/destination matrices and we can base our model just
on the (expected) passenger demand at each bus stop.
The bus route with regular and demand stops is
formalized as a directed graph, with two types of nodes –
those corresponding to regular stops, and those associated
with optional demand stops – and three kinds of arcs: the
arcs corresponding to the normal bus route, the arcs
corresponding to deviations whose are actuated by passenger
demand, and arcs associated to links whose passengers not
served by a demand bus stop have to cover on foot. Figure 2
shows a simple deviation bus line layout with 7 normal
stops, numbered from 1 to 7 and identifies the location of 3
possible optional stops: A, B and C.
The main decision concerns whether to activate or not the
optional stops in A, B, C. If the route planner decides to
142

serve, e.g., optional stop A, then a bus on the main route will
deviate from node 2 to node A, and then to node 3 only if a
demand in node A is detected. Otherwise, the bus route
corresponds to the regular arc 1-2. On the other hand, if the
route planner decides not to serve node A, then passengers
potentially located at node A will have to walk from node A
to the nearest fixed stop, which is here assumed to be node 2.
The arc corresponding to pedestrian mode is the dashed one
in Figure 2.
Figure 2.
Basic graph layout of a route deviation bus line [4].
From the point of view of mathematical modeling, there
are several issues arising from the problem above. The first
issue
has
been
already
coped
with
and
concerns
origin/destination pairs. A second issue concerns cost
computations.
This
model
assumes
that
to
each
arc
corresponds a unit cost proportional to the distance between
the endpoints of the arc (an alternative could be to use an
estimate of the travel time). The distance is augmented for
the arcs corresponding to pedestrian flow, in order to give an
estimate of their “perceived” distance. The travel time should
be used; but in such a case, is also required to make a
correction
as
time
perceived
in
different
ways,
and
depending on whether the passenger is walking or waiting
for the bus. An aggregate measure of cost has been obtained
by multiplying each unit cost by the flow, i.e., by the
expected number of passengers on that arc.
IV.
THE ROUTE DEVIATION BUS MODEL
In the optimal RDB design model based on a mixed
integer linear programming problem, Pratelli and Schoen [4]
consider the problem faced by the bus route planner when
designing a bus route with optional stopping, as previously
described. For sake of simplicity, the RDB model is herewith
briefly resumed, and the interested reader is addressed to the
original paper [4].
The service area is divided into segments by some
regular stops along the base route, identified by 1, 2 … N
(Figure 1). It is assumed that a bus route has already
designed with its main stops. A trade-off has to be found
between the interest of passengers located at these extra bus
stops, and the augmented travel time suffered both from
people on the bus whose route is deviated, and from
passengers waiting for the bus at regular stops downstream
the deviation. As said before, the bus route is like a “feeder”
line, i.e., many-to-one, and in the last stop no passenger
leaves the bus. Therefore, it does not need of any o/d matrix,
and the RDB model is based just on In(i) and Out(i), number
of users boarding and alighting the bus at stop, respectively.
M is the bus capacity; Q is the maximum feasible deviation
distance from the main route, on each side; t(i,j) is the time
associated to any single user boarded on the bus traveling on
arc (i,j); t*(i,j) is the time on foot for a user walking from
location i to j.
In each ride, the bus must visit all the regular stops. The
total aggregated travel time T0, obtained when the bus makes
no deviations outside the base line, is given by (1):

Demand is constant during the design period, even when
it is associated to regular stops and deviate stops. The
decision variables are binary-valued variables, defining both
the decision or not of placing a deviated stop at some
location, and the entities describing of flows along the
different arcs. The decision variables are:
-
δ(di)=1 representing the decision to place a deviated
stop at location di; δ(di)=0, otherwise;
-
f(i,j) is the flow variable related to the amount of users
on board of the bus travelling along arc (i,j);
-
f*(i,j) is the flow variable of the number of users
walking on foot from location i to regular bus stop j.
The RDB objective function to minimize has the

Each one of the three terms in square brackets in the
objective function (2) above, is to represent:
a) the total surplus travel time perceived by users
boarded on the bus, which is defined as the total aggregated
time elapsed on board during deviations;
b) the total travel time perceived by users who have to
reach on foot a regular stop from the locations, which are
not served by any deviate stop;
c) the augmented waiting time suffered by users at bus
stops located downstream of the deviations caused by an
upstream deviation: at bus stop m there are In(m) users
waiting.
Each term in (2) is multiplied by a time weight
coefficient: Kb, Kf and Kw, which respectively consider the
different time perceived by users when traveling in vehicle,
walking and waiting [3]. A deviation at regular bus stop i
can only occur if the decision is taken of serving the
deviated bus stop, δ(di) = 1, and either at least one passenger
143

is waiting at di, or a passenger on the bus just before stop i
asks to be alighted at the deviated stop.
Probability pdi that a route deviation will actually occur
during a time slot t is given by pdi=1 – exp[(di + ßdi) t],
given that both the process of passengers arriving at a
deviated stop with rate di, and the process of requests to be
alighted at deviated stops with rate ßdi, form two independent
Poisson’ processes [4].
A
set
of
constraints
is
defined
to
reproduce
the
relationships between the different flows and the decisions
whether to activate or not deviated bus stops. The three
constraints, f(i,di) Mδ(di), f(di,i+1) Mδ(di), f*(di,i) M(1-
δ(di), impose the two logical conditions that a deviated arc
have a positive flow only and only if the corresponding
deviate stop is activated and, conversely, there is a positive
flow of walking users only and only if the deviate stop is not
activated. Flow conservation both at regular and deviate
stop is represented by constraint f(i-1,i) + f(di-1,i) +
f*(di,i)+In(i) = f(i,i+1) + f(i,di)+Out(i) and constraint
f(di,i)+ In(di) = f(di,i+1)+ f*(di,i)+ Out(di). Randomness in
bus route deviation is referred by f(i,di) pdi[f(i-1,i)+ f(di-
1,i)+ f*(di,i)+ In(i) – M(1-δ(di)].
The latter, it is a logical constraint, and it is referred to
randomness in bus route deviation. If pdi >0 is the
probability of at least one user waiting at deviated stop di,
and the decision is taken to activate that deviated stop, then
users entering node i will be divided into two streams: one
on the deviated arc (i,di) and proportional to pdi; the other
one on the fixed line arc (i, i+1) and proportional to (1- pdi).
A practical upper bound is imposed on max length, or max
time, of any deviation. There is a last constraint, g δ(di)
G, imposing that the total number of deviated stops to be
activated must lie between a minimum number g and a
maximum number G.
Finally, the RDB model results in a mixed integer linear
programming problem, or MILP [15]. The above MILP has
been implemented in the mathematical high level language
AMPL [16] and the computational tests were run on a
common PC using CPLEX solver.
V.
APPLICATION NETWORK AND FRAMEWORK
The
town
of
Campi
Bisenzio
is
located
in
the
metropolitan area of Florence, central Tuscany (Italy).
Campi Bisenzio (Figure 3) is a small town with a high
density
populated
historic
center,
and
some
sparsely
residential and industrial activities in its surroundings, along
two opposite streamlines oriented to North and South,
respectively. The rounded relevant land-use data are: 29
sqkm
of
municipal
area;
35,000
inhabitants;
average
population density of 1,200 inhab/sqkm.
Therefore, transport demand is sparse and characterized
by a high variability rate in time and space. There are several
road links with quite different geometries. In such a
condition, it is very difficult to serve transit demand by
conventional line-haul operations, and flexible-route service
looks the most proper choice. Since 1998 the previous three
fixed line-haul transit service was replaced by a new Dial-a-
Ride system conceived for mixed mode operations, named
Personalbus. Today, the Personalbus service covers all the
municipal area, even reaching zones that never were served
by the previous fixed line-haul transit system. Personalbus is
a demand-responsive door-to-door transit system, which
operates in a Dial-a-Ride mixed mode, i.e., managing both
advance requests and immediate requests.
Figure 3.
Map of the service area.
The core of Personalbus is the so-called Travel Dispatch
Centre, or TDC, located at the ATAF headquarter, the main
urban transit company of Florence. All the travel requests are
collected, processed and managed by specific software,
which solves for vehicle routes and dispatching for day-by-
day basis on the stops as requested by patronage. The TDC is
suited to manage:
- telephone travel requests, coming from user’s house or
directly from equipped stops; each travel request may be
formulated into two ways. The first is in advance (e.g., the
day before) or on systematic base (e.g., every Monday at
9:00 a.m.). The second is immediate, when the request is at
least 15 minutes before travel starting;
- automatic travel request collecting and managing by its
related insertion into the current optimal vehicle dispatching
and scheduling plan;
- in-vehicle communication for driver instructions on the
new vehicle route required by the accepted travel request(s).
Users call by phone the TDC and ask for booking their
trip, specifying both desired departure and/or arrival time
and location of stops for pick-up and drop-off. Then, TDC
operator inputs data and runs the vehicle routing and
scheduling software, giving to the user the corresponding
answer to his/her trip request, in real time. At this point, a
negotiation phase on the user’s specified service times can
eventually start between the TDC operator and the user. The
first desired times can be corrected in order to meet both
optimal system operations and tolerable user needs. Booking
phase ends with definitive acceptance or refusal by the user
of proposed trip solutions.
TDC’s operators are able to manage the immediate
requests negotiating with the user for the best pick-up time,
144

which can span into a time window of ±20 minutes centered
on the user preferred time. This avoids any flat refusal of the
user by the transit company. At the most, it is the user who
gives up his/her trip, but it happens very rarely.
Finally, it is useful to underline that time negotiation is
possible because the Personalbus patronage, as usually
happen in any demand-responsive system, have a “relaxed”
travel time utility function. This last is quite different from a
“tight-to-time” travel time utility function characterizing
systematic users of conventional fixed-haul transit systems.
The success obtained by Personalbus is clearly showed in
Figure 4, where is represented the patronage evolution in the
first 5 years of starting up, from middle 1998 to 2002 [17].
Moreover, the value of the last year recorded patronage
of the previous existing three fixed line-haul service is also
depicted in Figure 4, and it is about many thousands less
carried on by the flexible line one.
The monthly patronage ranges on 9,700 passengers
carried on average, with peaks around 13,000 passengers per
month (Figure 4). As said above, Personalbus Travel
Dispatch Centre has to cope with both off-line and on-line
requests, i.e., both advance requests and immediate requests.
Table I shows a typical requests resume recorded in two
weeks on Fall beginning.
Figure 4.
Personalbus monthly patronage from 1998 to 2002 [17].
From the values reported in Table I, it is fairly clear that
the advance requests are almost prevalent in respect to the
immediate requests. Due to this evidence, one can note that
the service should be regular to some extent, instead fully
demand-responsive. Moreover, data drawn from practice
monitoring on user disposability to negotiate for immediate
requests have revealed that shifts of plus or minus 20 to 30
minutes from the desired time are quite well accepted. This
last fact gives force to the concept that demand-responsive
system users have a perception of travel time fully different
from line-haul system users, more and more linked to tight
schedules.
These considerations have led to evaluate the hypothesis
of a new transit system, operating in a mixed-mode between
line-haul, for higher regular demand related to advance
requests, and demand-responsive operations, for lower
randomly demand related to occasional immediate requests.
Roughly speaking, the new transit system to evaluate is the
RDB bus system.

Comparison Indexes
Statistical data on costs are not available, therefore the
comparison has been performed between the present DRT
system service, i.e., Personalbus, and the proposed RDB

Following Johnson et al. [18], the first index, W%,

The second comparison index, P%, represented by

The computational goals have been restricted to one
representative operations period, which has selected in a test
month with a satisfied patronage of 3,700 passengers. Real
data are used to determine the frequency call at each stop.
The highest frequency call stops are used to build the
main network “skeleton” leading to two fixed lines, namely
Line 1 and Line 2, crossing the whole service area (Figure
5). Line 1 terminals are the industrial and commercial park
of S.Angelo a Lecore (zone 8) and the railway station of
Pratignone (zone 1). Line 2
terminals
are the large
interchange parking of motorways A1 and A11 (zone 3) and
the residential zone of S.Donnino (zone 11) characterized by
single-family detached housing. Each one of potential
deviate stops has been placed as the centroid of a group of
Personalbus stops not belonging to Line 1 nor Line 2 regular
stops. These are stops characterized by low call frequencies,
generally less than 0.15÷0.25. Therefore, the frequency call
assigned to any potential deviate stop, i.e., deviation
probability, was the weighted average frequency of the
group, using number of calls of each stop as weight. This
way, the result was in 13 deviate stops covering the whole
area to serve.
Figure 5.
Layout of the new RDB network
Data related to Personalbus patronage was adapted to the
new situation and an o/d matrix was obtained for the two
RDB lines, respectively. Users having origin located on one
line and their destination placed on the other line, were split
assigning each of them to the closest stop common for both
RDB lines.
At this point, a proper RDB problem was solved for each
one of the two RDB lines, given both a minimum of 4 and a
maximum of 7 deviate stops. The values for time weight
coefficients in the objective function (2) were assumed in
Kb = 1.0, Kf = 2.5 and Kw = 2.2. Definitive results showed the
following issues:

Line 1: Base line length is about 6.5 Km. Different
combinations were analyzed, beginning with a number
of 7 deviate stops to a number of 4 deviate stops. There
are
eight
potential
deviate
stops
on
Northbound
direction, and nine on Southbound direction. The RDB
problem drops off the potential deviate stop located at
the Pratiglione railway station, when solved for less
than seven deviate stops. This is an obvious drawback
highlighting the difference between theoretical and
practical solutions.

Line 2: Base line length is about 7.2 Km. As above,
different combinations were analyzed including from 4
to
7
deviate
stops.
There
are
fourteen
potential
deviations in both directions. The theoretical solutions
for less than 6 deviate stops not include the deviation
associated to zone 4, where is located an important
shopping center.
Both Line1 and Line 2 require a number of three vehicles
dispatched on service for a period of 12 hours on a weekday
(instead of six vehicles actually dispatched by Personalbus).
Depending on the number of included deviate stops, there
are different average vehicle headways, or frequencies, on
regular stops for each of the two lines, respectively.

Table II shows, in respect to different RDB solutions, the
obtained values of average route travel time, monthly
component of actual users not served by RDB, i.e., lost
demand, and vehicle headway. In Table II are reported the
values of no deviations situation, i.e., zero-devs, to reproduce
the borderline case of line-haul operations.
In Figure 6 and 7, respectively, are depicted the same
values of lost demand per month, and headway of Line 1 and
Line 2 solution instances. It is trivial to notice that as the
number of designed deviations increases, on one side the
route travel times and headways also increase, and on the
opposite side, the lost demand values obviously decrease.
Personalbus acts as a doorstep service and, therefore, an
alternative RDB system operation needs the highest number
of available deviate stops in order to keep the large part of
the actual patronage. On the contrary, one must take into
account of the transit company point of view, both in terms
of efficiency and costs.

The high number of deviations implies both dispatching
of many vehicles to maintain acceptable frequencies, and
increasing in vehicle idle times, and lowering of user
tolerability due to several deviations made upstream.

It is generally assumed that stable deviation route system

Line 1 have feasible deviation utility ratios only in case
of 4 deviate stops. While Line 2 shows all the evaluated
instances feasible, except the one with 7 deviations.
Table III resumes the performance indexes of all RDB
solved instances from 4 to 7 deviated stops, which are
compared to the Personalbus ones. The values shown for
RDB
solutions,
in
Table
III,
are
averages
of
the
corresponding values related to each one of the two lines
under examination. Moreover, it is clear that lower values of
waiting times are referred to an RDB service with few
deviated stops, say 55% less for 4 devs or 31% less for 5
devs, than Personalbus. Such RDB solutions also imply the
highest losses of satisfied demand with respect to the present
service situation, i.e., over 16% or 13% when compared to
Personalbus, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Future mobility is challenged to bundle up transport
demands to handle an increasing mobility caused by spatial
sprawl, economic growth and suitable working time [19].
Flexible route and demand-responsive transport systems
offer an opportunity to overcome these challenges for future
public mobility for the preservation of personal mobility,
especially in sparsely populated rural and residential areas
[20][21].
In this paper, the RDB model has outlined as a MILP
problem and applied to a real case. Computational results are
drawn in the test area of Campi Bisenzio, a large residential
area located in the surroundings of Florence (Italy), for a
new RDB system operating with two base lines and different
instances of number of designed deviate stops. Numerical
comparisons through performance indexes highlight that the
actual demand-responsive transit system, called Personalbus
and operating under Dial-a-Ride mixed mode service, is
quite better than changing to any one of the considered RDB
flexible route system alternatives.
Nevertheless, the main computational results are likely
linked to the poor resemblance to a “corridor” shape of the
study-case network. This is a further detailed confirmation of
some general findings previously obtained by Daganzo using
analytical models [3].
In addition, the fairly considerable length of deviations to
base bus route is also often resulted not favorably to
deviation route operations development, as enhanced by the
computed values of deviation utility ratio, i.e., DUR in (5),
related to many among the RDB design alternatives taken
into account.
Finally, the presented study-case leads to meaningful
experimental findings on planning and application domain of
demand-responsive
transit
systems

RDB

service operations. This paper is intended to offer to transit
planners a preliminary experimental evidence in the field of
flex-route systems. Future studies can also cope with
developments to incorporate ITS technologies, advanced
math tools and innovative smartphone applications.
