Abstract— Small and Medium Enterprises require new 
technologies and methods of work organization that allow 
them to improve their productive and competitive capacities. 
The Enterprise Architecture is a methodology that defines 
architectures for the use of the information in support of the 
business strategy, looking for strategic alignment between 
information 
technology 
and 
business 
processes. 
The 
Applications Architecture is a partial architecture of the 
enterprise architecture, which aims to define the best kinds of 
applications needed for data management and support the 
business processes, considering the strategic use of information 
and technology for the competitive advantage of the company. 
This 
research 
project 
designed 
and 
implemented 
an 
application architecture in a medium-sized manufacturing 
company using open source software, resulting in the 
identification of strategic areas of opportunity for this 
architecture, and the development of a basic web page to start 
e-commerce activities, achieving 7% increase in sales of the 
company, 
thus 
helping 
to 
raise 
productivity 
and 
competitiveness.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Productivity and competitiveness of the Small and 
Medium Enterprises (SME’s), are important, because they 
provide a high rate of employment, the Secretary of 
Economy estimates that 7 of each 10 employees work in 
SME’s [1]. 
Therefore, it is necessary to create  a strategic solution to 
improve the capabilities of these companies and respond 
quickly to the challenges, either business related or 
technological, which is today’s markets demand [2]. 
Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a methodology to 
provide companies with a framework for the use of 
information on business processes in ways that support the 
business strategy [3]. 
The framework was created to provide a disciplined 
approach 
to 
managing 
information 
systems, 
and 
professional 
communication 
that 
would 
allow 
the 
improvement and integration of tools and development 
methodologies [4]. 
Recently the framework was updated by Ross, Weill, 
and Robertson [5], cited by Bijata and  Piotrkowski, where 
the concept of  Enterprise Architecture as Strategy  (EAS), 
has been proposed as an enterprise framework, composed of 
three elements, operating model, enterprise architecture, and 
information technology cooperation model; established as 
an improvement of enterprise architecture, for an adjustment 
in the strategy of  the organization [6].  
Harrel and Sage have mentioned that the key to 
developing Enterprise Architecture is located in: 
 
Business processes. 
 
Data for processes. 
 
Technology. 
 
Interfaces with customers. 
 
Applications software. 
where each factor has its own architecture and  develops 
its own tools that support it [7]. 
In Singapore, a research project of strategic alignment 
between the business model and Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) was developed, in the 
form of an architecture for small and medium engineering 
and construction enterprises, focused on four shafts,  
business 
strategy, 
strategy 
of 
ICT, 
business 
or 
organizational infrastructure, and infrastructure of  ICT  [8]. 
This 
project 
was 
established, 
looking 
for 
the 
transformation of the business sector aforementioned, to 
prepare them to face the challenges of the XXI century, 
supported by ICT, designed to acquiring new skills, using a 
framework of enterprise architecture, the results of the study 
were [8]: 
 
Some companies do not consider ICT as 
strategic to their business. 
 
The practice of using ICT is mainly in 
administrative functions. 
 
The exploitation of ICT for improving the 
technical areas is low. 
 
Insufficient professionalism. 
 
Shortage 
of 
professional 
and 
technical 
personnel. 
 
Insufficient use of technology. 
 
Methods of unproductive operation.

 
Involved in domestic markets. 
Ahlemann et al. [9] have proposed the EAM as a way to 
deal with organizational complexity and change, make it 
strategic for business management. 
These studies have shown that results of strategic 
alignment between ICT and business strategy are similar in 
other countries. 
One important activity of the pre-construction of the 
Applications Architecture (AA) was the analysis of business 
model, and the strategic planning, which discusses, among 
other things, the mission, vision, geography, competitive 
advantage, customers, suppliers, enterprise services, and 
other important factors that relate to the definitions of the 
business. 
The AA is a partial architecture of the Enterprise 
Architecture, that aims to define the best kind of data 
needed to manage and support business processes 
applications, also known as conceptual applications model 
[10]. 
In the AA, it identifies every possible application to 
manage the data and support the business, considering the 
strategic use of ICT for competitive business advantage. As 
an increasing number of functions and processes within 
companies, it has also increased the number of computer-
based information systems, which are improving the 
efficiency and quality of the areas and processes that 
support [10]. 
The AA is a definition of what applications will manage 
data, and provide information to people running business 
processes. Applications enable the Information Systems (IS) 
function to achieve its mission; this is to provide access to 
the necessary data in a useful format at an acceptable cost. 
Using as a source of information, the definitions of data 
architecture, the data-matrix functions, the business model, 
and the applications list, to propose candidate applications. 
In this case study, an applications architecture was 
designed, like a  partial architecture of an enterprise 
architecture, considering key processes in manufacturing 
SMEs, the best practices and business modeling tools that 
use these companies to develop it; with the objective of 
supporting 
them 
in 
increased 
productivity 
and 
competitiveness. An improvement proposal was designed 
and implemented [11]. 
The methodology for the case study is shown in Figure 
1, where the requirements analysis began with the 
description of the current applications. 
 
 
Figure 1. The methodology for AA. 
The next step was a search of software tools for EA, 
looking for accessible tools for SME’s. The selected 
software was Essential Architecture Manager 3.0 [12], the 
Figure 2 displays one view representing application 
capability summary, which is searching for suitable 
software solutions to SME’s. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. View of Essential Architecture Manager for AA. 
 
The AA was designed (the next section describes the AA 
design widely), the assessment of options for opportunity 
areas identified, and finally the implementation of the 
solution. 
The organization of this paper is as follows; Section 1 is 
mentioning the concepts, studies about applications 
architecture, and the methodology used in the case study; 
Section 2 describes the Application Portfolio Management 
(APM), as well as, the information required for the design 
of the application architecture from the company; finally, 
the implementation of the solution derived from the analysis 
is shown. 
A. State of the Art 
Op’t et al. [13] have identified enterprise architecture as 
a key driver for governing the changes in companies, 
ensuring compliance in the implementation. Bernard [14] 
has defined EA as a holistic management, planning, and 
documentation activity, and has introduced the EA Cube 
Framework and implementation methodology. Where were 
defined lines of business as five sub-architectures, and three 
common thread areas.  
 
Strategic initiatives. 
 
Business services. 
 
Information flows. 
 
Systems and applications. 
 
Technology infrastructure. 
The three threads are: 
 
Security. 
 
Standards. 
 
Workforce.

―Newer approaches as business services, exemplifies 
how EA can link strategy, business, and technology 
components across the enterprise within a service bus that 
encompasses platform independent horizontal and vertical 
EA components‖  [14]. 
Some frameworks were updated for including EA as a 
requirement,  Control Objectives for Information and 
Related Technologies (COBIT EA), repositioned as a 
business framework for the governance and management of 
enterprise IT, defining EA such a requirement; the domains 
for EA in COBIT, namely business, information, data, 
applications, and technology [15]. 
EA involves key elements as, strategy, business, and 
technology; considering the basic Zachman’s  Framework 
[3], and notions from Spewak [9], and the new proposals as 
EA Cube Framework [14]. 
The applications architecture proposed in this paper has 
considered, analysis of the current applications, identifying 
priority processes, developing and assessment of solutions 
for achievement support on strategy business and 
technology, which are related with the general assumptions 
of EA, in applications architecture level.  
Figure 
3 
shows 
the 
proposal 
for 
applications 
architecture. 
Agility 
and 
effectiveness 
in 
operations 
of 
the 
manufacturing processes, as also, data sharing across the 
company, were some of the advantages of using this 
proposal.

NOTIONS 
 
Some 
researchers 
have 
identified 
5 
fields 
or 
categorizations  related to decision making in IT [16]: 
 
IT Principles. 
 
IT Architectures. 
 
IT Infrastructure. 
 
Business needs and applications. 
 
IT Priorities and investments.  
 
This set of activities have been named: The Application 
Portfolio Management (APM), shown in Figure 4, with the 
tools for each categorization [17]. 
Categories: 
 
IT Strategy: Is defined and governed by the 
central IT staff, who report directly to the CIO 
(Chief Information Office) or executive office 
information, 
considering 
strategic 
maps, 
strategy business, Scorecard for ICT, and Key 
Performance Indicators (KPI’s). 
 
Business application needs: These needs are 
analyzed 
according 
to 
the 
business 
requirements, 
using 
Business 
Processes 
Modeling (BPM), diagrams of the company and 
Use Cases.

 The AA is the conceptual model of business 
applications, composed of software applications to support 
business processes; the basics premises for construction of 
AA are shown in Table I, where the objective has been 
defined as the best kinds of applications to manage data and 
support the business processes, by using  Essential EAM, as 
a repository for the instances obtained [18].  
The technological domains identified by the EAM for 
applications were: systems implementation, environment 
services, integration services, business systems, business 
support services, and systems management. Each one has a 
set of capabilities executed by applications. In Figure 5 the 
domains and capabilities are shown.

before the application). 
 
Succeeding systems (systems that can be 
executed after this application has been run).  
The format was applied for each application in the firm. 
Subsequently, the activity for to relate the applications 
with the business processes of the company, was developed. 
Opportunity areas for application and improvement were 
detected.

C. Needs Identified  
 
The company has the applications support for the 
management processes with IS in: Distribution, Finances, 
Clients, Sales and Marketing, Product development, Stock 
and others management processes, which are shown in 
Table III. 
The production and quality processes are supported by 
spreadsheets, as these processes are essential in this 
industry, has been programmed the acquisition, in short 
term, of software to streamline processes throughout the 
logistics chain.  
By the other hand the electronic commerce is null, then 
the recommendation is begin with a basic website that 
including information about: 
 
Background of the company. 
 
Products and services. 
 
Scheme of manufacture. 
 
Quality model. 
 
Clients. 
 
Contact. 
 
Important information about the company. 
 
The website was implemented by September 2013; a rise 
in the sells was of  7%  during  the next two months. 
The graphic with the access statistics website is shown 
in Figure 6. 
We are stressing–out that the company did not have a 
website before, only mentioned in some industrial 
directories as ―Infomaquila‖; when entering the e-commerce 
in this first phase, there has been an increase of the hits and 
visits to the website, resulting in a rise of the customers and 
sales.

The 
improvement 
proposal 
will 
be 
gradually 
implemented, starting with applications and technology that 
directly impacts on priority processes as quality and 
production; continuing with human resources processes, the

The next stage of the website is to add  popular search 
engines like Google, Bing, and, Yahoo; links and social 
networking accounts, Google maps location, bilingual 
website, online payments through Paypal system, and others 
internet characteristics. 
 
III. 
CONCLUSION 
 
The final recommendations are for using software, 
hardware, and next generation networks, with efforts of 
successful practices for manufacturing industry that would 
support key processes, and help incorporate them into 
international markets, always looking for a return on 
efficient investment. 
This project helped to meet the needs of SME’s 
companies to propose affordable solutions that make 
business management resources and technology to solve 
problems. 
The contribution of the paper focuses on the 
improvement proposal for the case study firm and the 
development of applications solutions, detected by the 
analysis. 
The AA takes components of the Business Architecture, 
and is associated with the Technology Architecture to 
produce the EA complete. 
Other findings in terms of improvement were: SME’s 
have demonstrated alignment with business strategy to drive 
a 
strong 
organizational 
culture 
and 
technological 
infrastructure. 
The company has acquired new skills through ICT. 
The sharing of information with customers and suppliers 
has improved considerably with the use of e-commerce and 
networking.
