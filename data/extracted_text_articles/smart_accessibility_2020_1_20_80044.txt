INTRODUCTION
Rapid urbanization has become a trend across the world,
especially in the developing countries. Such a trend created
its own challenges to urban life, along with the benefits.
While the focus has always been on equitable distribution of
resources and opportunities, the needs of marginalized
population, including the differently abled, have been
compromised. It is estimated that nearly one billion people
(15% of the global population) experience some form of
disability. Out of that number, about 30 million are residing
in India, according to the 2011 Census [3].
Urban living in itself can be challenging and it is
particularly true for those with disabilities. A lack of
universal design can be commonly observed in public
buildings like schools, banks, offices and, most of all,
recreational spaces. Restricted mobility, dependence on
others, lack of sensitivity among fellow citizens, create a
sense of insecurity and isolation among people with
disabilities, impacting their physical as well as mental
health. The lack of accessibility to digital platforms, un-
familiarity with the technology and unaffordability of
assistive devices has impacted the intellectual growth and
empowerment of the disabled population. It has become
imperative to include and place emphasis on the “accessible
and inclusive component” on the path for achieving
sustainable development.
A.
Status of the Disabled Population in India
According to the 2011 Census [3], India has around 3
crore of the disabled population, which constitutes about
2.21% of the total population. The disabled population
constitutes about 2.17% [1] of the urban population, half of
which is concentrated in just five states. Table I gives the
details of the top five states and of the urban agglomeration
with the highest percentage of disabled population. With
the increase in the number of categories from 7 to 21 in the
Rights of Persons with disability Act in 2016 [10], these
statistics are likely to vary. There is no available data on the
qualitative aspects of demographics of the people with
disabilities.
There
is
a
need
for
enhancement
and
strengthening of the data available on the state of the
disabled population.

Existing Policies and Frameworks
The disability Act of 1995 [5] mandates the provisions
for accessibility for persons with disabilities. The national
policy for persons with disabilities [14] places emphasis on
provisions for equal opportunities and protection of the
rights of the disabled population. India is a signatory of the

“Declaration on full participation and equality of persons
with
disabilities
in
Asia
Pacific
Region”,
Biwako
Millennium Framework, Biwako plus Five and the UN
Convention on the Rights of Persons with disabilities [14].
The government of India has given a new direction to
urban development which now has a much larger coverage
and huge investments, in addition to including newer areas
of the latest government schemes such as Swach Bharat
Abhiyan [6], Smart City Mission [1], etc. The new missions
of the government are complementing each other by
enabling access to the resources available under different
missions. The concerns of inclusivity and accessibility of
Persons with Disability (PwD) have been highlighted in the
flagship program Accessible India Campaign or Sugamya
Bharat Abhiyan [15] launched by the Hon’ble Prime
Minister of India (under the Ministry of Social Justice and
Empowerment)
in
2015
and
later
supported
by
the
enactment of the Rights of Persons with Disability Act in
2016 [10]. Schemes such as Smart City Mission [1],
Swachh Bharat Mission [6], AMRUT [8], Pradhan Mantri
Awas Yojana – Urban [9], and HRIDAY [7] (under the
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs), Digital India
Campaign
(under
the
Ministry
of
Electronics
and
Information Technology) [16] have the crosscutting agenda
to guarantee accessibility and inclusivity components,
briefly described below in Table II.

II.
GENESIS OF THE PROJECT
To reflect on the needs and way forward in facilitating
Indian
cities
towards
ensuring
universal
access
and
inclusive planning, the Ministry of Housing and Urban
Affairs (MoHUA), in collaboration with the National
Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), called upon the key
stakeholders in the domain of accessibility and inclusivity.
A consultation was organized on September 11, 2018 to
seek expert insights on framing the person with disability

SMART ACCESSIBILITY 2020 : The Fifth International Conference on Universal Accessibility in the Internet of Things and Smart Environments

friendly measures and policy recommendations that can be
implemented through the Smart Cities Mission [1]. The key
recommendations that emerged from the consultation can
be broadly put into six areas of intervention, as detailed
below:
1)
Legislative Framework and Guidelines – Duplicity
and discripencies in guidelines pertaining to universal
design and accessibility need to be addressed, such that
uniform standards can be established and followed across
Indian cities.
2)
Inclusive Design and Planning – Planning and
design of projects under the Smart Cities Mission with
principles of accessibility and inclusivity.
3)
Institutional Arrangement and Capacity Building –
Improving existing institutional mechanisms and capacity
building of authorities and practitioners to carry out works
pertaining to universal design.
4)
Awareness Generation – Generation of awareness
amongst all stakeholders and the public towards disabilities,
universal design and inclusive cities.
5)
Information and Communication Technology (ICT)–
Incorpartion
of
accessiblilty
components
in
ICT
the
infrastructure of Smart Cities.
6)
Monitoring and Review - Regular monitoring and
evaluation of universal design applications in Smart Cities
projects.
To facilitate the above, there is a need for focused
technical assistance at all levels of governance, for the
accurate and successful adoption of PwD friendly measures
in Indian cities. It is in this context that NIUA, with support
from the Department for International Development (DFID)
of
the
UK
Government,
is
implementing
a
project
“Building Accessible, Safe and Inclusive Indian Cities”
(BASIIC).
The
project
has
formalized
a
Technical
Assistance Support Unit (TASU), which will ensure that
tenets of universal access, inclusivity, and safety, are
practiced through sensitive and responsive planning. The
project endeavors to promulgate the above in the ethos of
urban
planning
and
design
through
policy
level
interventions, capacity building, pilot demonstrations of
contemporary solutions, and implementation of robust
monitoring systems.
I.
PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
The principal goal of BASIIC is to build the capacities of
Indian cities to be sensitive and responsive to the needs of
the PwDs. The project aims to homogenize the definitions
and concepts associated with PwDs in India and to
holistically build the capacity of practitioners to plan and
implement
with
the
tenets
of
universal
access
and
inclusiveness. The project shall also actively work to gather
the key stakeholders working on disabilities on a common
platform
and
demonstrate
innovative
solutions
–
technologies, programs, and service delivery models in the
realm of universal access.
The key objectives of the project are:
a) Consolidation of definitions, concepts, policies,
provisions, and practice with respect to PwDs in India.
b) Mapping
the
major
areas
of
opportunity
in
implementation of policies and provisions at city level and
replicable solutions for making cities more accessible and
inclusive for PwDs.
c) Develop a monitoring and evaluation framework
for pilot cities to assess and improve their standards of
universal access and inclusivity. The framework developed
will be replicable for other Indian cities to implement.
II.
APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
A.
Project Initiation
The project has been initiated with understanding the
target population through detailed study of the available
data and stakeholder meetings to gain the sensitivity and
empathy required for the project. The interaction with
stakeholders, including persons with disabilities, non-profit
organizations and relevant institutions working in the field,
helped in understanding the needs and aspirations of PwDs
along with the challenges faced by them in life every day.
B.
Defining the Project Geography
Identification of pilot cities/towns is critical with any
project for creating a measurable impact. Criteria were
formulated for identification of partner cities in order to
achieve the project objective to implement innovative pilot
solutions focused on accessible/ inclusive/ safety design
and planning principles in selected partner cities. The
selection framework included the following influencing
factors for city selection under the BASIIC project:
1) Ongoing Policies and Programs - like Accessible
India Campaign [15], Smart Cities Mission [1], etc. to
establish convergence between the projects/schemes.
2) Data Relevance - in terms of City Classification and
Disabled Population to identify the cities in need of
immediate interventions.
3) City Intent – the cities promising intent in the form
of proposed or ongoing projects related to the concept of
accessibility, inclusivity and safety. Association with these
cities will assist in getting support in terms of leveraging
partnerships, availability of funds for implementation,
awareness/sensitization of the stakeholders, etc.
An intensive city selection process has been adopted
comparing around 39 cities overlapping between Smart
City Mission [1] and Accessible India Campaign [15].
These cities were further scrutinized to 22 cities based on
the percentage of disabled population and class of city,
which was further narrowed down to 14 taking into account
the proposed or ongoing initiatives. The level of intent
through initial accessibility audit has resulted in shortlisting
of 9 cities, namely: Kanpur, Chennai, Chandigarh, Jaipur,
Varanasi,
Vishakhapatnam,
Bhubaneshwar,
Delhi
and
Dehradun. Out of these, two cities will be selected as

partner cities for demonstration of the pilot projects. Based
on experiential learning models, seven (7) cities shall
shadow the partner cities throughout the pilot interventions
to learn and replicate.
C.
Baseline Study
1)
Qualitative and Quantitative Data on the Disabled
Population: BASIIC has undertaken a secondary baseline
study to evaluate the current status of disability in India,
both in terms of qualitative and quantitative aspects of the
concerned population set. This will help in understanding
the sectors of urban development which need immediate
attention. It is observed, from the details in Table III, that
people with hearing, visual or speech disability constitute
more than half of the disabled population.

2)
Status of Accessible and Inclusive Environment: An
assessment of secondary data has been undertaken to
understand
the
existing
status
of
accessibility
and
inclusivity in projects in the realm of urban planning and
built environment. The assessment resulted in preparation
of identifying prospective sectors of intervention.
3)
Status of Existing Policies and Frameworks: The
status of accessibility and inclusivity of the PwD in the
existing policies and guidelines was done to list the existing
focus
areas,
existing
gaps
and
possible
areas
of
intervention. It was found that there is duplicity and
discrepancies in existing guidelines/codes.
D.
Auditing
1)
Accessibility Audits: Evaluation and grading of the
smart city projects will be done in terms of inclusivity,
accessibility, scope and impact. This evaluation will help in
identification of pilot projects.
2)
Review of Existing Policies and Frameworks: A
comparative
analysis
of
the
existing
policies,
acts,
standards/guidelines and building codes helped in mapping
the gaps and scope of revision in existing guidelines. Table

and revision of guidelines/ standards leading to statutory
documents i.e. the developmental plans and the building
bylaws. Also, the Harmonised Guidelines [18], as prepared
by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, is suggested
to be revised and enhanced in a comprehensive manner to
address accessibility, safety and inclusivity of PwD in built
environment and be integrated in all existing and upcoming

3)
Knowledge Management and Training: Training
programs and modules will be arranged to ease the
understanding of policies and provisions for PwDs for
relevant stakeholder/ practitioners at national and city level.
This will help in capacity building of the civil bodies/
municipal authorities and creating a toolkit containing
aspects addressing inclusive and accessible components,
aiming at increased awareness among the stakeholders.
Also, a knowledge network of sector experts, practitioners
and stakeholder will be formulated for ease co-learning
opportunities.
F.
Monitoring
Monitoring and evaluation will be an integral part of
this project and have been integrated into the proposed
objectives
for
setting
up
a
framework
for
sectoral
monitoring of the city level efforts. In addition, to monitor
the progress of the sector and partner cities, the project will
also track its own progress in delivering the indicated
results.
G.
Intended Outcomes
The project will work towards achieving the following
outcomes and assist the national, state and city level
governments in achieving aligned goals:
a) Easing the understanding of policies and provisions
for
PwDs
for
relevant
stakeholders/practitioners
at
different levels through simplification and revision of
existing guidelines.
b) Developing
a
comprehensive
repository
of
contextual challenges, possible solutions, toolkits and
experts in matters pertaining to PwD in urban India.
c) Developing
collaborative
engagement
and
operating
models
with
key
stakeholders
(such
as
municipalities), which can help sustain the above solutions
by undertaking pilot projects in the partner cities.
d) Capacity building and dissemination of knowledge
with respect to PwD among key stakeholders. This will be
achieved through knowledge management and training.
III. CONCLUSION
The efforts under BASIIC will support the Government
of India programs in the pilot cities and will try to
propagate the results. It is envisaged that the learnings of
the project will be useful in developing programs and
policy
recommendations
at
the
national
level.
In
convergence with the Smart Cities Mission program and
Accessible India Campaign, the project will allow Indian
cities to secure benefits through their institutional capacity
building, design challenge and pilot demonstration efforts.
