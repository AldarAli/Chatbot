Abstract—Darknet technologies are a transformative technol-
ogy, particularly in the context of online social media. This paper
explores social media platforms where user anonymity artificially
constrains self-disclosure. It proposes a social media platform
anonymity continuum that recognises how the emergence and
growth of darknet social platforms - and the affordances of
darknet technologies - have exposed conceptual limitations in
our understanding of self-disclosure and technical and social
anonymity on social media platforms.
Keywords— social media; anonymity; dark social; grey social;
clear social
I. INTRODUCTION
Social media are ”Internet-based channels that allow users to
opportunistically interact and selectively self-present, either in real-
time or asynchronously, with both broad and narrow audiences
who derive value from user-generated content and the perception of
interaction with others” [1]. Social media platforms have been cate-
gorised and classified across two dimensions - social presence/media
richness (i.e., range of media and content), and self-presentation/self-
disclosure [2]. Self-disclosure refers to the conscious and unconscious
sharing of personal information, such as ”thoughts, feelings, likes and
dislikes” [2] [3]. It also includes ”identity-based” data such as one’s
real name, birth date, and image, as well as contact information such
as address, phone number and email address [4] [5]. Self-disclosure is
pervasive on social media [6] and tightly coupled to the success and
vibrancy of social media platforms [5]. The degree to which users
engage in it is, in turn, coupled with user anonymity [2] [3] [7] [8].
This paper explores social media platforms where self-disclosure is
artificially constrained by user anonymity. These constraints may be
imposed by the platform vis-`a-vis its technical architecture, its design
choices and affordances, its culture or community, and by an indi-
vidual user’s choice. We recognise the fluidity of online anonymity
across technical and social dimensions [9] and propose a continuum
for the purpose of categorising social media platforms based on these
dimensions (see Figure 1). The continuum recognises the emergence
and growth of darknet-enabled, ”anonymity-granting technologies”
[10] [11] and how they influence both technical anonymity and social
anonymity of users [12] [13] [14]. The remainder of the paper is
structured as follows. In Section 2, we present this paper’s main
idea: a continuum of social media anonymity. To provide context
and background for this, we discuss three categories of social media,
and introduce the concepts of dark, grey and clear social. This is
followed by a discussion about anonymity in the context of social
platforms. In Section 3, the paper concludes with a summary of its
achievements and presents preliminary implications and avenues for
future research.
II. CONTINUUM OF SOCIAL MEDIA ANONYMITY
Social media platforms are categorised as mainstream, alternative,
or ”dark”. Mainstream social media - comprising chiefly of the
”social media giants” such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram [12]
- is also referred to as corporate social media (CSM) [13] [15] [16].
CSM operational and business models comprise content moderation,
surveillance, commercialising user data, advertising, and lack of user
privacy [13] [15] [16]. Alternative social media (ASM) typically
operates on the fundamental principle of egalitarianism and caters to
smaller communities of niche interests and those who ideologically
reject the operational practices of CSM [12] [15] [18] [19] [24].
Current scholarship suggests that social media activity also takes
place on ”dark platforms”, on ”dark social networks”, and on ”hidden
social spaces” [14] [28] [21]. We refer to this category as dark
social - social media that takes place on the darknet. Accordingly,
alternative and dark social users turn to decentralised social platforms
hosted on privacy-attuned and anonymity-granting technologies such
as the darknet (e.g. Tor) [13], and the blockchain [24]. CSM sites
primarily exist on the clearnet, although this boundary is beginning
to blur as Facebook and Twitter both operate Tor onion services [25]
[26] [27]. Further, some clearnet social platforms such as Parler and
Gab are built upon ASM-like foundations of anonymity, freedom of
expression, and privacy; and are culturally more akin to the dark
web. A pure-play darknet social platform provides a combination
of technical affordances and ASM-like foundations to support
user anonymity and pseudonymity [13]. Anonymity is known to
increase self-disclosure [22]. However,we propose that the level of
self-disclosure on social platforms is determined by a combination
of the technical architecture of the platform (e.g. clearnet versus
darknet or blockchain), the culture or community of the platform
(CSM versus ASM versus dark - which serves as a proxy for the
risk of self-disclosure), and the individual user’s inclination towards
online anonymity. This is where the spectrum emerges: from clear to
grey to dark. In the context of computer-mediated communication,
anonymity is defined as ”the condition in which a message source is
absent” where ”an anonymous source is one with no known name or
acknowledged identity” [17] [23]. Self-disclosure is an outcome of
both anonymity and other affordances of social platforms [23]. The
emergence and growth of anonymous social media [7], alternative
social media [15], dark social media [12] [13] [16] [18] [19], and
the increasingly privacy-attuned design choices of clearnet social
platforms [5] [20] is congruent with the Communication Model of
Anonymous Interaction in that social platform user anonymity is
best viewed as a continuum from fully anonymous to fully identified
[15]. This is also reflected in our proposed continuum (Figure 1)
which comprises two dimensions: Platform Disclosure Risk (PDR)
and Individual Disclosure Practice (IDP). Here, social platforms
can be plotted as dark social (pure-play darknet - both technically
and culturally); grey social (has some combination of the technical

and cultural affordances of ASM/dark/clear social); and clear social
(pure-play CSM/clear - technically and culturally). PDR represents
the affordances) of a platform used to prevent or mitigate against
the risk of self-disclosure. IDP represents the individual users’
behaviour on a platform. The continuum comprises four quadrants:

III. CONCLUSION, IMPLICATIONS AND AVENUES FOR
FUTURE RESEARCH
This paper critically evaluated the three categories of social media
in extant scholarship - mainstream, alternative and dark social - based
on their technical and cultural affordances. Consequently, we intro-
duced and defined the concepts of dark social and grey social as part
of a proposed spectrum that plots social media as clear, grey or dark.
To aid our understanding of these categories, this paper proposed a
social media anonymity continuum. This continuum should provide
a basis to guide future research efforts to systematically examine,
deconstruct, analyse and categorise social platforms along the clear-
grey-dark spectrum in the context of the fluidity of two evolving
dimensions in online social media: technical anonymity and social
anonymity.
