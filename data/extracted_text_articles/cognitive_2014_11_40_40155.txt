Abstract—Visual P300-based Brain–Computer Interface (BCI)
paradigms for spelling are aimed at offering a non-muscular
communication channel for those people with severe motor
impairment, such as locked-in patients. To be as effective as
other assistive technologies, these systems have to achieve a
greater communication rate. One way to do so is to develop
better interfaces. In this regard, we thought of using a 4 x 3
symbol matrix based on the T9 interface developed for mobile
phones. Due to presenting a reduced matrix and relying on an
adaptation of the T9 predictive text system, we expected that this
speller would provide a higher communication rate than usual
6 x 6 matrix spellers that are based on Farwell and Donchin’s
classic proposal. As a proof of concept, a locked-in patient with
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis tested our T9-like visual BCI speller
along with two different 7 x 6 conventional matrix spellers. The
comparison of her performance results with those of a sample of
three healthy participants suggested that it was possible for this
locked-in patient to control the T9-like speller as well as they
did, and thus, write a target sentence considerably faster than
when she used the alternative spellers.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Patients who have suffered a brainstem stroke, a cerebral
palsy or that have been diagnosed with a neurological disease
such as the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) face severe
motor impairments. In some cases, they may even enter in
a locked-in state [1], in which they lose control of practically
all muscular activity. These patients are believed to retain their
cognitive abilities intact, although some authors disagree with
this assumption (cf. [2][3]).
Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) systems [4] have been
developed during the last 40 years to offer a non-muscular
channel to these patients, so that they can communicate or
control external devices [5][6]. These systems transform the
user’s brain activity into commands that are interpreted by a
machine through which they can control the environment or
express needs and feelings.
Regarding the type of brain activity required from the user,
BCIs can be roughly divided into those based on spontaneous
brain activity, such as Slow Cortical Potentials (SCP, [7]) and
SensoriMotor Rhythms (SMR, [8]) and those based on brain
responses to external events, mainly the P300 Event-Related
Potential (ERP) [9].
To be used efﬁciently, SCP- or SMR-based BCIs demand
from the user an adequate control of his/her brain activity,
which is usually acquired after a training period that might
take even months. By contrast, P300 is a naturally elicited,
positive deﬂection of the electroencephalogram (EEG) typ-
ically appearing about 300 ms after the presentation of an
unexpected stimulus. Thus, P300-based BCIs do not demand
such an intensive training. Users have simply to attend to the
stimulus that is associated to a certain option as it is displayed
among other non-relevant stimuli. This elicits a brain activity
that is systematic enough so as to be classiﬁed with usually
perfect accuracy, so that the desired option can be identiﬁed.
The ﬁrst P300-based BCI paradigm for communication
purpose was the visual speller developed by Farwell and
Donchin [10]. In this speller, a 6 x 6 matrix of symbols
was shown to the user. Its rows and columns were randomly
intensiﬁed for a certain time, during which he/she counted the
number of times that the row/column containing the desired
symbol was intensiﬁed. Those intensiﬁcations or ﬂashes con-
stituted the infrequent stimuli, which elicited the P300. Once a
sequence of ﬂashes was over, the symbol belonging to the row
and column that had produced the largest P300 was regarded
as the attended matrix element and displayed to the user.
The effectiveness of this visual speller is supported by
several studies that have tested it not only with healthy
participants [11]–[15], but also with users affected by some
motor disability [16]–[21]. However, the communication rate
of these systems is still lower than that of alternative assistive
technologies such as the eye tracker.
Aimed at improving the usability of BCI spellers, some
authors have examined the impact of user-centred factors on
performance. In this regard the mental fatigue induced by a
long use [22]–[24], the sustained attention at a symbol that
256

it demands [25][26], the resting heart rate variability [27] or
the user’s motivation [22][28][29] can inﬂuence or be related
with performance (see [30], for a review) At the same time,
other authors have explored the extent to which performance
can be improved by providing BCI spellers with predictive text
techniques [31]–[34], or by modifying the temporal of spatial
aspects of their interface [35]–[40].
Following these latter research lines, we hypothesized that
restricted BCI end-users could beneﬁt from using a visual
P300-based BCI paradigm for spelling that shows a reduced
4 x 3 symbol matrix, resembling the T9 interface developed
for mobile phones [41]. Speciﬁcally, we expected that locked-
in patients would beneﬁt from needing less time to select a
symbol—due to using a matrix with fewer rows and columns
than usual—as they frequently cannot stare at the desired
symbol for a long time.
Although a reduced matrix interface has already been
proposed with an auditory [42] and a visual P300-based speller
[43], it has never been tested, to our knowledge, with BCI
end-users. Such a test is necessary because the performance
results from a sample of healthy participants do not necessarily
apply to end-users in the locked-in state [44]. For example, the
higher frequency with which the attended row/column would
be intensiﬁed together with the complexity of typing through
a T9-like interface could overload the cognitive resources of a
BCI end-user, which may not be fully available [2][3].
In order to obtain a proof of concept of its actual usability,
a locked-in patient diagnosed with ALS performed a copy
spelling task using the proposed T9-like speller and also two
adaptations of the classic Farwell and Donchin speller. Her
performance results were compared with those of a sample
of three healthy subjects that had participated in a previous
experiment [45]. In the following sections, we will provide
a detailed account of the experimental procedure and of the
results, and ﬁnally discuss their implications.
II.
METHODS
A. The case
We visited a 62-year-old woman on two separate days with
a time interval of two days between them. She was diagnosed
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2008 and is currently
in the locked-in state. Without any independent means of
communication, she relies on a partner-scanning approach
based on eye blinks to communicate with her relatives and
caregivers and on assistive technology (i.e., an eye-tracker
system connected to her personal laptop) in order to browse
the Internet and interact with friends in social networks.
B. Experimental setup
We carried out only morning testing sessions. The patient
sat comfortably in an armchair. A laptop was placed before
her over a tray attached to the armchair (see Figure 1). The
viewing distance was about 75 cm.
On our ﬁrst visit to the patient’s home, we conducted two
sessions to test two BCI paradigms: ﬁrst, an adaptation of
Farwell and Donchin’s 6 x 6 matrix speller (hereafter termed
Spellermod), and then, a Spellermod that included a word
predictor (hereafter termed SpellermodPred). The proposed

Experimental setup at the patient’s home.
T9-like 4 x 3 matrix speller (hereafter termed SpellerT9) was
tested on a third session on our second and last visit. These
three BCI paradigms are described next.
C. Tested BCI spellers
To make a proper comparison of the three mentioned
BCI spellers in terms of typing speed, the values of all the
temporal parameters related to the selection of a symbol were
equal across them. These values were based on those used by
[12]. Speciﬁcally, each row and column was randomly ﬂashed
10 times. Therefore, each character was randomly intensiﬁed
20 times. The duration of each ﬂash was 125 ms and the
InterStimulus Interval (ISI) between ﬂashes was also 125 ms.
There was a pause of 2 s after each sequence of ﬂashes (i.e.,
after a character had been selected) and also in the beginning
of each trial. It is important to notice that the duration of a
sequence of ﬂashes depended on the size matrix, so that bigger
matrices entailed longer sequences.
1) SpellerT9: The SpellerT9 presented the user a 4 x 3
virtual keyboard (see Figure 2a), in which only eight keys -
the ones corresponding to the numbers 2 to 9 - were used
for spelling. Each of those keys corresponded to three to
four letters. To disambiguate key sequences, we implemented
a modiﬁed version of the T9 predictive text system, which
worked as follows. Given a certain sequence, the system
computed the corresponding textonyms, that is, all the possible
combinations of letters with lexical meaning that could be
formed with those contained on the selected keys. These
textonyms were then ordered according to their lexical fre-
quency in the Spanish language [46]. The system regarded
the most frequently used one as the word the user was trying
to type and accordingly displayed it in the text box below
the keyboard (see Figure 2a). If that was indeed the desired
word, the user accepted it by selecting the key 0 (i.e., selecting
the command espacio), which simply added a blank space
afterwards. Otherwise, he/she could personally disambiguate
the key sequence by selecting the key C (i.e., select the
command cambiar) to switch to a new keyboard that displayed
the four most frequently used textonyms in row-major order.
For example, given the key sequence 2272, the word casa
would be displayed in the text box below the keyboard. If
the user selected the key C, then the textonyms casa, cara,
257

COGNITIVE 2014 : The Sixth International Conference on Advanced Cognitive Technologies and Applications

capa, and basa would be displayed on the new keyboard (see
Figure 2b). The user could then select one of those textonyms,
in which case the word plus an additional blank space were
displayed in the mentioned text box. Alternatively, he/she
could go back to the previous keyboard by selecting the left
arrow key (i.e., selecting the command volver).
In order to further increase typing speed, we decided to
provide the SpellerT9 with a word predictor. In this case, given
a certain key sequence, the predictor computed the lexical
frequency of all the words starting with any of all the possible
combinations of letters contained on the selected keys, that is,
not only textonyms—as in the implemented T9 predictive text
system—but also combinations with no lexical meaning. The
predictor then regarded the most frequently used one as the
word the user was trying to type and displayed it in a text box
to the left of the keyboard (see Figure 2a). If that was indeed
the desired word, the user could validate it by selecting the
key 1 (i.e., selecting the command validar). As a consequence,
the word plus an addition blank space were written in the text
box below the keyboard. In the previous example, the predicted
word would have been barcelona. Therefore, whereas the word
predictor could suggest the user words of more letters than the
number of keys selected, the T9 predictive text system only
computed words of as many letters as selected keys.
To delete characters the user had to select the key X (i.e.,
select the command borrar). To write digits, he/she had to
select the key C just after a blank space had been introduced,
either to validate a textonym or because of having accepted
the word retrieved by the word predictor. The user could then
type the digits from 0 to 9 just by selecting the corresponding
keys. Once the desired sequence digits was written, the user
had to select the key C again to continue writing words. This
selection automatically added a blank space to the numeric
sequence.
As the SpellerT9 displayed a 4 x 3 keyboard, the time
needed to select a key was 19.5 s, that is, the initial 2 second
pause plus the time needed to ﬂash four rows and three
columns 10 times each.
2) Spellermod: The Spellermod presented the user a 7 x 6
virtual keyboard, shown in Figure 3a. The last row contained
only two command keys - BORRAR and ESPACIO - for
deleting the last inserted character and introducing a blank
space, respectively. The characters typed by the user were
displayed inside a text box below the keyboard.
According to the aforementioned temporal parameters, the
time needed to select a key of the Spellermod interface was
34.5 s - the initial 2 second pause plus the time needed to ﬂash
seven rows and six columns 10 times each - , that is, almost
twice the time needed to select a key from the SpellerT9.
3) SpellermodPred: As we had implemented a word pre-
dictor in the SpellerT9 to make typing faster, we decided to
add that feature to the Spellermod to control its inﬂuence on
user performance. Thus, we developed the SpellermodPred,
which presented a 7 x 6 virtual keyboard that included the
command key VALIDAR (see Figure 3b). The time needed to
select a key using the SpellermodPred was 34.5 s, like in the
Spellermod.
The typed characters were displayed in a text box below
the keyboard and fed into the word predictor. The suggested
word was displayed in an additional text box to the left of
the former (see Figure 3b). In case that word was the one
the user wanted to write, he/she could do it by selecting the
command key VALIDAR. As in the SpellerT9, that selection
implied writing the suggested word and adding a blank space
afterwards.
D. Testing sessions
Prior to all testing sessions, we verbally informed the pa-
tient in detail about the procedure and obtained her consent to
participate in the study and proceed with the different sessions
through partner scanning. The experiment was conducted in
accordance with standard ethical guidelines as deﬁned by the
Declaration of Helsinki [47].
Each testing session was divided into two phases: a ﬁrst
one for calibration purpose and a second one to evaluate
user performance. At the beginning of each session, the
researchers explained the patient how to spell words with the
corresponding speller. They told her to silently count how
many times the symbol she wanted to select was intensiﬁed
(i.e., ﬂashed) during a sequence of ﬂashes. They informed her
that during calibration she would not be receiving any feedback
(i.e., the attended symbol). As for the SpellermodPred and the
SpellerT9, they also explained her how the word predictor and
the T9 predictive text system worked.
In the calibration phase, the patient was asked to copy
spell ﬁve sequences of three to four characters, speciﬁcally
“hoy”, “sin”, “casa”, “remo”, and “tus” for the Spellermod and
“159”, “357”, “1xc3”, “4796”, and “258” for the SpellerT9.
The classiﬁcation weights from the Spellermod were also used
for the SpellermodPred. In the evaluation phase, she was asked
to write the sentence “experiencia bci en la universidad de
malaga” (i.e., bci experience at the university of malaga).
Two days after our second visit, we contacted the patient
through e-mail to gather her experience as user of the three
spellers. We asked her to complete a test consisting of nine
questions to be answered with a 5-point Likert scale and also
to reply to six open-answer questions, e.g., whether she had
any suggestions concerning the interfaces she had interacted
with. Her answers were recorded by her relatives and e-mailed
back to us six days later.
E. Data acquisition and analysis
Scalp EEG signals were recorded from eight positions
according to the 10-20 standard (FPz, Cz, Pz, Oz, P3, P4, PO7,
and PO8) using active electrodes (actiCAP, Brain Products
Gmbh, Germany). All channels were referenced to the left
earlobe and grounded to FPz. The EEG signals were ampliﬁed
with an actiCHamp ampliﬁer (Brain Vision LLC, USA), and
recorded at 200 Hz using BCI2000 [48].
The stimulation paradigms of the three spellers were im-
plemented using BCI2000. The T9 predictive text system as
well as the word predictor used both by the SpellerT9 and
the SpellermodPred were implemented as MATLAB R2007a
(The MathWorks Inc., USA) routines that were called from
the BCI2000 framework. The P300 component was classiﬁed
using stepwise linear discriminant analysis like in [10].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The time needed by the locked-in patient and by the three
healthy participants to spell each word of the target sentence
(i.e., “experiencia bci en la universidad de malaga”) using the
three compared spellers are shown in Table I. Unfortunately,
most of the data corresponding to the ﬁrst testing session (i.e.,
the one corresponding to the Spellermod) at the patient’s home
were lost due to a software failure.
Table I also shows the minimum required times, that is,
the time that a user that made no mistake nor slip would
need to write each word. As can be seen, the total spelling
times of the locked-in patient were similar to those of the
healthy participants when using the same speller, that is, the
SpellermodPred and the SpellerT9.
The data from healthy participants suggest that the word
predictor included in the SpellermodPred contributed to re-
ducing the overall time needed to write the target sentence
with respect to the Spellermod. Comparing the results of the
SpellermodPred and the SpellerT9, it also seems likely that
using a matrix with fewer rows and columns increased the
communication rate further than the word predictor did. In
fact, the locked-in patient wrote the target sentence over 1.5
times faster with the SpellerT9 than with the SpellermodPred.
It is also remarkable that the patient made no mistake nor slip
using the SpellerT9 when writing four of the seven words of
the target sentence (i.e., “experiencia”, “en”, “la”, and “de”).
As for her personal assessment of the spellers, she regarded
the SpellerT9 as the fastest of all three and did not ﬁnd it
too difﬁcult to use. She also indicated that all the spellers
were equally exhausting to use. Despite her good performance,
she found the SpellerT9 more confusing to use than both the

knowing which letter was going to be chosen after a key
selection. Nevertheless, she also found it more entertaining
than those two. Importantly, she thought she needed more
training with all the spellers.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
The main goal of this study was to obtain a proof of concept
that a locked-in patient diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis could efﬁciently control a visual P300-based speller
with a T9-like interface consisting of 4 x 3 virtual keyboard
and an adaptation of the T9 text predictive system of mobile
phones.
Our data suggest that the locked-in end-user that partici-
pated in the study was able to control the proposed speller as
well as a sample of healthy participants did. Importantly, the
communication rate the patient achieved with this new speller
was higher than the one achieved when using a 7 x 6 matrix
speller, even when this also included a word predictor.
However, it should be kept in mind that this particular
locked-in patient uses her laptop almost daily to browse the
Internet or interact in social networks. Besides, she is always
greatly motivated to participate in research studies and has
a very supportive circle of relatives and friends around her.
Therefore, her good performance results and her assessment
of the proposed speller cannot be fully generalized to other
locked-in patients. More studies involving other locked-in end-
users should be done to account for individual differences.
