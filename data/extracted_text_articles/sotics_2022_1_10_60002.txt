Abstract— This paper illustrates the practical application of 
cluster analysis, social network analysis and sentiment analysis 
in a case study. These techniques provide insights into the public 
communication patterns between German Members of 
Parliament (MPs) on Twitter around the time of the 2021 
federal election. The question of this work was to determine 
whether a potential shift in communication towards the 
inaugurated “Ampel” coalition, made up of the parties SPD, 
Greens and FDP, can be derived from Twitter interactions. In 
distinct scenarios, mention, retweet, and reply interactions are 
first considered together and then separately. In these scenarios, 
the Girvan-Newman Algorithm detects clusters of MPs 
dependent on the interactions observed. Then, the average 
inbreeding homophily and other network metrics of the pre- 
and post-election area are compared. An additional scenario 
focuses on intra- and inter-party sentiments conveyed within 
tweet texts. In a fourth scenario, MPs are grouped according to 
their party affiliation, the average inbreeding homophily values 
of parties and potential coalitions. The communication clusters 
of those MPs differ mostly before and after the election. The 
average sentiment of the parties towards each other changed 
positively, although no significant tendency could be derived 
regarding later coalition formations.

 INTRODUCTION  
For the political communication between parties, 
politicians and their constituents, social media platforms play 
an important role. By communicating through platforms, such 
as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, political actors reach 
wide audiences within a short period. On these platforms, 
politicians publicly communicate with each other.  
Among those services, Twitter promotes the dialogue 
between politicians and between politicians and their 
constituents via mention and reply interactions, which allow 
users to engage in direct communication. Consequently, social 
media have become a central component of political 
communication. 
Relations between individual MPs can be examined in 
more detail using social network analysis. Interactions can be 
derived from public tweets referring to other people, i.e., 
retweets of or replies to another user’s tweet, or mentions of a 
user. Analysis of interaction networks explore these relations, 
as well as their textual contents, which can be examined 
through sentiment analysis. This article applies such methods 
to explore changes to the communication of German MPs 
from selected political parties around the 2021 federal 
election. 
Section 2 of this paper presents related works, formulates 
the research gap and specifies the hypotheses. Section 3 
introduces the methodology used to aggregate and analyze the 
data. Section 4 presents the results of each perspective and 
discusses them. Section 5 illustrates the limitations of this 
research, as well as starting points for possible future work. 
II. 
RESEARCH GAP 
Virk [1] compares different Social Network Services 
(SNS) as a type of social media and explores the special role 
of Twitter in public communication. The author examines the 
communication patterns between Twitter users and applies the 
tie strength theory postulated by Granovetter [3] to conclude 
that interactions on Twitter – unlike other SNS – focus on 
content rather than user relationships, and thus can reach 
wider audiences. 
Lassen and Brown [2] examine the Twitter use of 
members of congress in the United States of America. They 
state that SNS enable politicians to communicate more 
directly and personally with peers and supporters by 
eliminating limits on message visibility, allowing content to 
be redistributed beyond one's own followers. The application 
of social network analysis to political networks shows the 
fragmentation and clustering of politicians, parties, or political 
systems. 
Boireau [4] identifies communities among Belgian MPs 
along party and linguistic lines. For this purpose, the Girvan-
Newman Algorithm (GNA) was applied on a network 
generated from the MPs’ connections to followers, and 
retweet interactions to find hidden communities and 
homogeneous clusters by calculating their homophily indices, 
which express the degree of similarity of members within a 
cluster. 
Caetano et al. [5] analyze social networks between Twitter 
users during the 2016 American presidential election by 
analyzing tweets about the candidates. Users were clustered 
based on their sentiment towards a candidate with their 
mentioning behavior and hashtag use. By obtaining 
homophily indices of these clusters, the authors could identify 
users with high degrees of relative similarity. 
Sentiment analysis attempts to quantify attitudes conveyed 
in a text. Giachanou and Crestani [6] discuss common 
procedures for sentiment analysis, as well as their respective 
limitations, e.g., the detection of irony or emotions. The work

explicitly focuses on methods suitable to retrieve sentiments 
from tweets. 
Until now, literature does not describe possible changes in 
Twitter communication behavior between MPs before and 
after an election. An exploration of the change in tone by 
analyzing the sentiment of tweets before and after an event has 
also not yet been described. Interesting aspects of political 
communication behavior on social media are expected results 
of this analysis. 
Consequently, this article examines how Twitter 
interactions (mentions, retweets, replies) between MPs of 
possible coalition partners (CDU, CSU, SPD, Greens, FDP) 
changed before and after the 2021 German federal election. It 
furthermore explores potential differences in intra- and inter-
party communication and attempts to show whether the 
political shift towards the inaugurated “Ampel” coalition 
could be derived from the observed changes. 
The following hypotheses form the basis for the 
communication behavior analysis: The article hypothesizes 
that different interactions between MPs can be observed 
during the pre- and post-election period (H1) and that the 
resulting interaction networks for each period show a 
difference in intra- and inter-party communication (H2). The 
article further assumes that “Ampel” MPs’ mutual sentiment 
changed positively (H3). By analyzing the sentiment between 
parties, as well as the average homogeneity within parties and 
party groups, political tendencies towards an “Ampel” 
coalition can be observed (H4). 
Thus, this article attempts to describe the change in 
communication between MPs by analyzing their Twitter 
interactions before and after the federal election 2021. It aims 
to understand whether changing interaction intensities 
between MPs of potential coalition partners yield conclusions 
about the emerging “Ampel” coalition. This would be of 
relevance for future research into the interdependencies of 
political communication on Social Network Services, such as 
Twitter. 
III. 
METHODS 
Mention, retweet and reply interactions between MPs 
from the SPD, Greens, FDP, CDU, and CSU were collected 
to explore changes in communication on Twitter. One MP 
using another MP’s handle denotes a mention interaction. 
Retweets refer to the redistribution of another user’s tweet and 
can contain commentary by the retweeter. A reply is defined 
as a comment posted under another MP’s tweet. The resulting 
social networks of MPs connected by their interactions is 
analyzed in four separate scenarios. 
A. Network Scenarios 
Scenario 1 considers all interaction types, while in 
scenario 2, a) mention, b) retweet, and c) reply interactions 
were examined separately. For each scenario, MPs were 
grouped using automated cluster detection and examined for 
modularity and homophily. 
In scenarios 3 and 4, MPs were grouped based on their 
party affiliation. In scenario 3, interactions were examined for 
the tweet author’s sentiment towards the addressed MP using 
sentiment analysis. The sentiment for every interaction was 
evaluated based on the tweet’s text. To determine changes to 
the inter-party relations, each party’s average sentiment 
toward all other parties was then calculated and compared 
between the pre- and post-election networks. Scenario 4 
examined the average homophily within each party and party 
group. Party groups were based on politically and numerically 
possible coalition compositions (“Ampel”, “Jamaica”) and for 
the Union parties. 
B. Data Aggregation 
Publicly available Twitter data can be divided into three 
categories: (1) User information, such as the username, the 
Twitter handle (identified by @), or account description; (2) 
following and liking behavior of a user, and the user’s 
followers; (3) the user’s tweet timeline, in which all self-
published or retweeted tweets appear, as well as the user’s 
replies to others’ tweets. 
As a basis for this study, publicly available tweets from 
MPs of the 19th (2017-2021) and 20th (2021-2025) legislative 
sessions were collected for the period from July 26, 2021, 0:00 
a.m. to November 26, 2021, 12:00 p.m. The end date was 
chosen to serve as cut-off due to the official presentation of 
the coalition agreement between the SPD, Greens, and FDP 
on November 24, 2021. To collect reactions to this 
announcement, two more days were added. The period 
between the closing of polls on September 26, 2021, 6 p.m. 
and the end date covers 60 days and is considered as the post-
election period. An equally long time before the closing of 
polls was considered for the pre-election period. 
Twitter accounts were selected from all MPs with a public 
Twitter timeline who are members of the parties SPD, CDU, 
CSU, Greens, and FDP. Members of the parties “The Left” 
and AfD were not included in this analysis, as neither party 
was relevant for coalition negotiations after the election. The 
timelines of all selected accounts were then scraped from 
Twitter’s website. 
Data Collection. Scraping of timelines was done using the 
Python package Scweet [7]. Scweet uses the Chrome plugin 
Selenium [8] to access the desired Twitter page, to extract the 
information of the tweet from the page and save it to a CSV-
file. 
Data Processing. A custom Java application was 
developed to generate uniformly formatted and sanitized 
datasets. The data originally scraped from Twitter included 
the timelines of all MPs, i.e., all their tweets, retweets of and 
replies to other tweets within the time frame. The information 
generated for each of these messages included the time of 
publication, the author’s username and handle, the textual 
contents of the tweet, as well as information on whether it was 
posted as a retweet of, or reply to another tweet. If other users 
were mentioned within the tweet, they could be identified 
through their handle. 
Additionally, the application enriches the data with 
information on party affiliation and membership of the 19th 
or 20th legislative period. It produced output data in the 
GEXF-format [9], which is limited by specified procedures. 
First, all tweets that did not represent a connection between 
two MPs were removed. The dataset was then divided into a 
pre- and a post-election partition. For this purpose, all tweets 
2

that were created before the time of the closing of polls on 
September 26, 2021, 6:00 p.m. were assigned to a first 
partition. The elements from the timeline after this date were 
assigned to a second partition. Additionally, the output is 
restricted to specific interaction types. This allowed the 
creation of one pre-election and one post-election dataset for 
each of the scenarios defined. 
Data Description. The data set collected from Twitter 
consisted of 26,888 German language tweets from 736 Twitter 
accounts. 15,770 of these tweets were posted before and 
11,118 after election day. 1,030 MPs were elected for the 19th 
and 20th legislative periods. 71.5% of them maintained a 
Twitter account. Once filtered, the dataset consisted of 622 
accounts and 9,582 tweets. After removing all tweets that did 
not connect two MPs, 5,766 tweets from 466 MPs remained 
in the pre-election dataset and 3,816 from 476 MPs in the post-
election dataset. Figure 1 shows the percentage distribution of 
all tweets among the parties before and after the election. 
 
Figure 1.  Percentage distribution of MPs’ tweets by party 
The pre- and post-election data contain nodes and edges 
depending on the interaction types selected during the data 
processing step. Scenarios 1 and 4 thus contained all MPs, 
while scenario 2 contained three separate data sets, 
differentiated by interaction types. Scenario 3 handled only 
those interaction types whose tweet text field were not empty. 
The aggregated data and source code can be accessed at [13]. 
C. Cluster Detection 
Cluster detection extracts groups of individuals from a 
network based on similarity of one or more attributes. This 
work used connectivity-based clustering, which identifies 
clusters based on the connections between nodes in the 
network, as well as the weights of connections. For this 
purpose, the Girvan-Newman Algorithm [10] was used. This 
algorithm assumes that members of a cluster have more 
connections to other members of the same cluster, and fewer 
connections to other nodes in the remaining network. By 
iteratively removing connections whose Edge Betweenness 
Centrality (EBC) is the highest, clusters are separated from 
each other. The EBC is defined as “the number of [the] 
shortest paths between pairs of vertices that run along it” [10]. 
In each step, the edge with the highest EBC is removed from 
the network and its modularity is calculated. The modularity 
of a network denotes how well clusters are separated from 
each other. The iteration continues until every connection 
between nodes has been eliminated. The intermediate step 
with the highest modularity is the result of the algorithm. 
To guarantee that an MP’s allocation to a cluster is based 
on their interactions and not their party affiliation, a 𝜒2 test is 
performed on the network. The test’s p-value denotes the 
probability p of MPs’ party affiliation determining the results 
of the cluster detection.  
D. Sentiment Analysis 
The textual contexts of MPs’ tweets were examined to 
analyze the sentiment for which the Python package TextBlob 
[11] was used. The package uses a lexicon-based approach to 
compute the sentiment. For the analysis of German language 
texts, the plugin TextBlobDE [12] was used. A predefined 
dictionary of words associated with positive or negative 
emotions is used to weigh a text’s sentiment. An individual 
score is assigned to each word in the examined text. The 
overall sentiment is defined by the average sentiment across 
all words in the text. The algorithm generates a polarity score 
from –1.0 to +1.0 for each tweet, which classified the tweet as 
either positive, neutral, or negative. Each tweet in the data set 
is then enriched with the polarity value, as well as the polarity 
class as additional attributes. 
E. Homophily 
The homophily index H measures a cluster’s relative 
homogeneity. To determine H for a cluster i, the connections 
of all nodes of the cluster are examined. Caetano et al. [5] 
calculate 𝐻𝑖 = 
𝑠𝑖
𝑠𝑖+𝑑𝑖  where si denotes homogeneous links, 
i.e., those that connect a node of class i to other nodes of the 
same class, while di denotes heterogeneous connections, i.e., 
those that connect a node of class i to nodes of another class. 
By normalizing Hi over the whole network, H can be 
compared 
across 
different 
clusters. 
This 
inbreeding 
homophily index IH is determined by 𝐼𝐻𝑖 = 
𝐻𝑖−𝑤𝑖
1−𝑤𝑖  , where wi 
denotes the relation of nodes between cluster i and the total 
number of nodes in the network. Clusters whose IHi is greater 
than 0 are considered homogeneous. The average of IH across 
all clusters in a network is used to compare the clusters 
detected in the pre- and post-election networks. 
F. Evaluation 
The procedure resulted in a set of network pairs, each 
consisting of a pre- and a post-election network. The two 
networks created for scenario 1 contained all MPs that have 
interacted via mentions, retweets, or replies within the 
respective timeframe. The number of connections between 
two nodes weighted the edges. 
Scenario 2 generated one network pair for each of the three 
interaction types. Thus, one pre- and one post-election 
network each were generated which included all those MPs 
that a) mentioned each other, b) replied to one another, and c) 
retweeted each other. Edges represent the connections. They 
are weighted by the interaction count. These scenarios were 
examined separately. For each network automated cluster 
detection was applied. The H and IH indices were calculated 
to determine the homogeneity of each cluster. Additionally, 
the number of nodes and edges in the network, the number of 
clusters identified by the GNA, as well as their networks’ 
average homophily and inbreeding homophily indices and the 
maximum 
modularity 
were 
determined. 
Statistical 
significance was ensured using the 𝜒2 test. The results of these

analyses were then compared for the pre- and post-election 
network pair. To illustrate the results of the automated cluster 
detection, each pre- and post-network pair is visualized as a 
cluster graph. 
In scenario 3, each party’s average sentiment towards all 
other parties was examined. For this purpose, MPs were 
clustered according to their party affiliations. 
Scenario 4 looked at the inbreeding homophily of each 
party, as well as the coalition options before and after the 
election. The IH-values for the coalitions where also checked 
for statistical significance using the 𝜒2 test and its p-value.

RESULTS 
A. Scenario 1: Multiple Interactions 
In scenario 1, automated cluster detection included all 
interaction types. An overview of the collected metrics can be 
found in Table I.

The number of MPs (nodes) tweeting after the election did 
not vary much from that before the election. However, the 
number of connections (edges) was reduced by 33%, which 
suggests that tweeting activity was distributed more equally 
among MPs after the election. The GNA identified 256 
clusters of the pre-election network with 466 MPs, and very 
low modularity, homophily and inbreeding homophily 
indices. After the election, 476 MPs could be assigned to 188 
clusters. The maximum cluster size was reduced by 54.5% to 
97. The modularity increased by 1369%, from 0.026 to 0.356, 
and homophily and inbreeding homophily also increased 
significantly. Figure 2 shows a visualization of these clusters. 
Node colors represent each MP’s party affiliation. The size of 
a node depicts the sum of all incoming and outgoing edges, 
i.e., the node’s degree. Edges were omitted from these figures 
for improved visibility. 
Pre-election, the visualization shows a distinctive, large 
cluster which unites MPs across all parties. Outside of this 
cluster many MPs are scattered into tiny groups or unassigned 
to any notable cluster. Post-election, four large clusters 
separated along party affiliation can be identified. A 
heterogeneous group of MPs was not assigned to any notable 
cluster. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Clusters found by GNA before and after election considering all 
interactions 
The pre-election results of scenario 1 show that MPs were 
likely allocated to the dominant cluster based on their general 
activity on Twitter. Nodes with higher degrees were allocated 
to the dominant cluster. Post-election, distinct clusters are 
clearly separable, which consist mainly of MPs of either the 
SPD, CDU, Greens or FDP. The number of nodes that could 
not be allocated to any major cluster decreased. This indicates 
that post-election, MPs predominantly communicated within 
their own parties, while they communicated much more 
openly before the election. The overall count of interactions 
decreased significantly. 
B. Scenario 2: Single Interactions 
When interaction types are considered separately, these 
findings can be analyzed in more detail.  
Mentions. In this particular scenario, clusters were 
determined based on mentions only. Table II shows the 
collected metrics.

Almost as many (433 vs 428) MPs mentioned one another 
in the pre- and post-election period. Interactions decreased by 
54%, and the number of detected clusters decreased by 40%. 
After the election, 38 clusters with a modularity of 0.441 could 
be identified, compared to 95 clusters with a modularity of 
0.237 before the election. Average IH across all clusters in 
both networks increased by more than 300%. Figure 3 
visualizes the detected clusters.

Figure 3.  Clusters found by GNA before and after election considering 
only mentions 
Pre-election, three distinct clusters can be identified, one 
portraying a large cluster mainly dominated by Greens but 
including MPs across all parties, one dominated by FDP MPs, 
and a smaller one dominated by CDU MPs. The large, 
heterogeneous cluster dominated by Green MPs could be 
caused by many mentions of the Greens’ chancellor candidate, 
Annalena Baerbock. 
Distinct clusters are detected in the post-election network 
separated along party lines. Two SPD clusters are found, as 
well as several smaller but still homogeneous clusters. The 
number of mentions increased. A subsequent analysis 
revealed that the distinct party clusters might be caused by 
MPs congratulating their party peers. 
Retweets Cluster analysis detected several well-separated 
clusters with relatively high homogeneity before and after the 
election. A possible explanation is that MPs attempted to 
promote tweets of party peers. The clusters in the post-election 
network were smaller. Retweets play a smaller role in the 
communication among MPs.  
Replies. Solely considering reply interactions, one large 
and many small clusters were found in the pre-election 
network. The main cluster contains many nodes with a high 
in– and out-degree. In the post-election network, more nodes 
are identified but fewer connections between them are found. 
Two main clusters were identified, notably consisting mainly 
of SPD and Green party members. One cluster of CDU and 
FDP MPs indicates active conversations between these two 
parties, potentially on the FDP’s willingness to enter coalition 
negotiations with the SPD and Greens shortly after the 
election which supports hypothesis H1. 
C. Scenario 3: Sentiment Analysis 
Each interaction’s textual content was analyzed to retrieve 
the parties’ mutual sentiment. The average sentiment of 
interactions from MPs of one party towards MPs of the other 
parties was calculated. The results are shown in Table III. 
Notably, polarity does not score very highly overall, except 
for the sentiment from MPs of the CSU towards MPs from the 
CDU. FDP MPs communicated neutrally in general. The SPD 
scores positively towards the “Ampel” parties. On average, 
Green party MPs showed positive polarities only towards 
other MPs of their own party.

Table IV shows the average sentiment between parties 
after the election. The post-election sentiments between 
parties notably tend towards an overall positive sentiment. 
The SPD received overall positive interactions, especially 
from the CDU. The SPD communicated relatively neutrally, 
both internally, as well as towards their subsequent coalition 
partners. The polarity of the interactions among MPs of the 
Greens and interactions from MPs of the CSU towards CDU 
MPs did not change significantly from their pre-election 
scores. The overall sentiment across all parties after the 
election was on average more positive than before the 
election. The FDP especially shows notable increases in 
positive sentiments towards the SPD and the Greens, 
considering that the FDP moved towards the “Ampel”. This 
strongly hints at successful coalition negotiations which ended 
with the signing of the coalition contract.

D. Scenario 4: Party and group dependent clustering 
In this scenario, MPs were clustered along party 
affiliation. Additionally, the two potential government 
coalitions, “Ampel” (SPD, Greens, FDP) and Jamaica (CDU, 
CSU, Greens, FDP), as well as the Union (CDU, CSU), were 
clustered. To compare the homogeneity within each cluster, 
the average IH before and after the election was calculated and 
compared. Table V displays the average IH values of each 
party, as well as the coalition and union clusters for the pre- 
and post-election networks. 
The biggest differences are within the SPD and CDU. 
Their relative homophily increased. CSU and FDP decreased 
in IH. SPD received the biggest increase in homogeneity. This 
could be explained by their win of the election, and the 
positive feedback MPs received from their peers, as well as 
the election of SPD MPs Olaf Scholz as chancellor and Bärbel 
Bas as president of the parliament. The biggest positive 
change among grouped MPs took place in the “Ampel” 
coalition, but IH increased for the Jamaica and Union clusters

as well. However, a significant statistical independence of 
these findings is not reliably provable, as the 𝜒2-test results in 
relative high p-values for the pre- and post-election 
homophily.

CONCLUSION 
This paper illustrates the application of techniques from 
social network analysis, sentiment analysis and cluster 
analysis in combination to analyze communication on social 
media especially on micro blogs.  
H1 is proven, as differences are found for mention and 
reply interactions. The networks for each interaction type 
yield differences in both intra- and inter-party interactions, 
which is shown by the results of the GNA. These findings are 
statistically significant due to the low p-values. H2 can 
therefore be considered as true. The p-value of the χ² test 
indicates a low likelihood that party affiliation influences the 
assigned cluster.  
H3 cannot be answered clearly. MPs’ mutual sentiment 
changed positively. The FDP’s positive change towards the 
coalition partners SPD and Greens can be considered as a sign 
of a generally improved attitude towards these parties. 
However, the notable overall increase in positivity across 
most parties could indicate that the findings of the FDP are not 
unique. The generally positive attitude between parties after 
the election can be caused by MPs congratulating one another. 
A lack of German language sentiment analysis models for 
short text fragments limits this research. Improved models 
utilize machine learning techniques and so can comprehend 
sentiments on a broader level and can also recognize nuances. 
Statements about H4 are not reliable. However, while 
positive tendencies towards an “Ampel” coalition can be 
shown from both the sentiment analysis and the inter-party 
and intra-coalition homogeneity, neither can be proven as 
statistically significant.  
Definitely results are: Different interactions between MPs 
can be observed during the pre- and post-election periods and 
the resulting interaction networks for each period show a 
difference in intra- and inter-party communication. However, 
this paper handles the political communication only via 
Twitter. Results are partially transferable to other countries. 
Future work may include “The Left” and AfD in these 
considerations to produce more information. Expanding the 
evaluated timeframes or continuous monitoring would 
produce more data. Analyzing follower and friend networks 
and MPs’ liking behavior in combination with the findings of 
this article would yield insights into differences in parties’ 
mutual relationships around elections.
