Abstract— Intense femtosecond laser pulses are routinely used
to stimulate ultrafast transformations in the properties of the
dielectric materials. Understanding the connection of the
microscopic response with the macroscopic properties of the
photoexcited material, requires application of space and time
resolved
experimental
techniques
and
development
of
predictive theoretical tools to rationalize experimental data. In
the field of modeling ultrashort laser-matter interactions,
progress has been achieved in understanding photoionization
and atomic scale properties of ultrafast electronic currents
within
the
Time
Dependent
Density
Functional
Theory.
However, first-principles approaches for description of micro-
and macroscopic material responses are usually limited to
ultrashort time scales of order 10fs, since the calculation is
time consuming and requires large computational resources.
We overcome this limitation by
applying
the empirical
pseudopotential
method
for
describing
the
electronic
properties of
dielectric
materials. The deposited energy,

INTRODUCTION
Femtosecond laser irradiation is suitable for studying
fundamental processes in solids, such as ultrafast chemical
reactions
and
phase
transitions.
Photoionization
and
photoexcitation of electrons in solids is the predominant
mechanism
of
laser-pulse
energy
deposition,
which
subsequently may induce ultrafast transformation of the
material.
Depending on the laser parameters (wavelength,
polarization,
pulse
energy
and
pulse
duration),
transformations of solid-state properties may be reversible or
irreversible.
Intense laser field may strongly distort the
electronic structure by transiently converting insulators and
dielectrics into metallic state on a sub femtosecond scale [1].
This distortion results in optical-field-induced transient and
reversible currents below the bulk damage threshold [2]. For
sufficiently strong laser fields close to the bulk damage
threshold, irreversible transformation occurs resulting in
non-thermal melting [3], sublimation and ablation on a
longer time scale. When intense ultrashort laser pulse is used
for material modification, the different stages during the
phase transformation can be studied using time-resolved
techniques. Study of the nonthermal melting of germanium
using ultrafast x-ray diffraction techniques was reported and
it was assumed that this ultrafast process takes place when
~10% of the valence-band electrons are excited to the
conduction band [4]. The ultrafast phase transitions and the
dynamics of melting, ablation and re-solidification
of
germanium surfaces was studied [5] using space- and time-
resolved measurements of the surface reflectivity.
At the same time, femtosecond laser interaction of
semiconductors has found important practical applications,
e.g. the graphitization of diamond bulk and creation of color
centers could be used in quantum information processing and
the manipulation of qubits [6]. Laser-induced graphitization
in bulk diamond is used in the design of particle detectors
[7]. Dielectric surfaces can be promptly converted into
plasmonic state by ultrafast laser irradiation, supporting
propagation of surface plasmon-polaritons. For instance, the
plasmonic properties of silicon and germanium can be used
for metamaterial applications at near-infrared and mid-
infrared wavelengths [8][9].
Ultrafast phase transformation of semiconductors under
intense femtosecond irradiation starts with photoionization
and deposition of laser energy onto the electrons.
In this
paper, we study the nonlinear response of silicon and
germanium irradiated by intense near-IR and mid-IR laser
pulses with time duration of 30 femtoseconds. For this
purpose,
we
have
developed
numerical
methods
for
integration of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation in
single active electron approximation [10]-[13].
More
specifically,
we
estimate
optical
breakdown
thresholds of silicon and germanium from the deposited laser
energy inside the bulk. We find two regimes of absorption: at
lower intensities, the absorbed energy depends sensitively on
the laser wavelength due to multiphoton transitions, and a
crossover occurs at higher intensity, when absorption
becomes wavelength-independent. The merging point in
laser intensity is material specific. In the multi-photon
absorption regime, the dependence of the absorbed energy on
the driving laser intensity is determined and scaling laws are
obtained. For mid-IR wavelengths, we find that a smaller

number of photons is required to cross the direct bandgap as
compared to the minimum number of photons allowed by
energy conservation. For near-IR wavelengths, the scaling
law exhibits a perturbative trend for both materials. At high
intensity, the absorbed energy is wavelength independent
and scales linearly with the laser intensity. This paper is
organized as follows: Section II presents material and laser
specific parameters which are inputs for the numerical
solution of Time Dependent Schrodinger Equation. The
numerical results for the photoelectron density and absorbed
energy are discussed in section II A. The time evolution of
the laser energy transfer to electrons, their number density
and the ultrafast macroscopic currents are discussed in
Section II B. Our main conclusions are included in Section
III.

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Photoelectron density and absorbed energy
The
photon
energies
corresponding
to
the
four
wavelengths used in the calculations are: 1.55 eV (800 nm),
1.24 eV (1 μm) for near-IR irradiation, and 0.41 eV (3 μm), 
0.248 eV (5 μm) for the mid-IR laser. The band-structures of 
Si and Ge were obtained numerically using the empirical
pseudo-potential method [14]. The corresponding bulk lattice
constants and selected transition energies between valence
and conduction band states in the Brillouin zone are shown
in Table 1. The calculated threshold for indirect electronic
excitations in Ge is 0.9 eV and it is 0.8 eV for Si. In long
wavelength approximation, the laser pulse ionizes electrons
through the direct band gaps, the threshold for direct
transitions in Ge is 1.2 eV and the corresponding threshold in
Si is 3.4 eV.

In Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 we show the number of conduction
electrons Ne produced by photoionization of silicon and
germanium as a function of laser intensity after the
irradiation with near-IR pulse of wavelength 800 nm. The
number of photoelectrons in silicon increases monotonously
with the increase of the laser intensity and follows a
perturbative trend Ne~I2 due to two-photon transition across
the minimal direct bandgap. At the highest intensity shown
(1.0 TW/cm2), Ne = 0.08. For the same laser wavelength,
similar results are found using the Time Dependent Density
Functional Theory and the number of photoelectrons per
atom at 1.0 TW/cm2 obtained by the authors is Ne = 0.06
[15].
The
intensity
dependence
of
the
number
of
photoelectrons in germanium, shown in Fig. 2, exhibits the
same trend Ne~I2 due to above threshold ionization via two
photon transition from the light hole to the conduction band
involving Bloch crystal momentum displaced from the
Brillouin zone center. When the laser peak intensity reaches
0.1 TW/cm2 we find a change of slope in the photoionization
yield following linear trend with Ne~I.
At the highest
intensity shown (1.0 TW/cm2) the number of conduction
electrons per atom is Ne = 0.07.

electrons per atom in bulk Si after the irradiation with 30fs near infrared
pulse with wavelength 800 nm. The laser is linearly polarized along the
[111] direction.
Figure 2. Intensity dependence of the number of conduction
electrons per atom in bulk Ge after the irradiation with 30fs near infrared
pulse with wavelength 800 nm. The laser is linearly polarized along the
[111] direction.
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the intensity dependence of the
energy transferred to electrons in bulk Ge and Si after the
irradiation with near-IR and mid-IR pulses. We distinguish
two regimes of electronic excitation based on the scaling of
the absorbed energy with the laser intensity. In the high-
intensity regime the absorbed energy becomes independent
of the laser wavelength above material-specific threshold
intensity - 0.5 TW/cm2 for Ge, and 1.0 TW/cm2 for Si. The
absorbed energy per Ge atom is 0.2 eV at threshold intensity,
and is 0.28 eV per Si atom. Both absorbed energies at
threshold are above the melting temperatures of the two
materials - 0.104 eV (1211 Kelvin) for Ge and 0.145 eV
(1687 Kelvin) for Si, respectively [16]. In this high intensity
regime we find that the ultrafast energy deposition inside the
bulk is sufficient to cause nonthermal melting. The low-
intensity
regime
is
wavelength
dependent
and
is
characterized by a superlinear scaling of the absorbed energy
as a function of the intensity ΔE~IN. When N = Nmin, where
Nmin is the minimum number of photons required to bridge

the direct band gap, perturbative multiphoton absorption is
expected.
Fig. 3 shows the intensity dependence of the deposited
laser energy in Ge. In the low-intensity regime, we obtain
N= 2 for irradiation with 800 nm wavelength, while resonant
one-photon absorption is expected with Nmin=1. For the 1 μm 
wavelength, the same trend is observed for laser intensities
below 5 GW/cm2. In the high intensity regime, the absorbed
energy scales linearly with the laser intensity. For irradiation
with mid-IR pulse having a 3 μm wavelength, we find N= 1 
for intensities up to 3 GW/cm2, which is less than the
minimal number of photons required to cross the direct
bandgap Nmin= 2, however N = Nmin = 2 in the range from 3
GW/cm2 up to the threshold intensity for Ge. For 5 μm 
wavelength, in the range below 2 GW/cm2, N= 1, for
intensities 2 GW/cm2 - 8 GW/cm2, N = Nmin = 4, and N= 2
for laser intensities above 15 GW/cm2.
Fig. 4 shows the intensity dependence of the deposited
laser energy in silicon. In the low-intensity regime and in the
near-IR region for the 800 nm wavelength, we find
perturbative
trend in the whole intensity range with
Nmin=N= 2, corresponding to two-photon absorption process,
while for the 1 μm wavelength, three-photon transition 
occurs with N = Nmin =3 for all intensities considered. For
irradiation with of Si with mid-IR laser, we find that there is
a threshold intensity 10 GW/cm2 below which no laser
energy is absorbed into the material. For the 3 μm 
wavelength, and laser intensity above this threshold, the
absorbed energy exhibits the superlinear trend with N=6,
which is less than the minimum number of photons required
to cross the direct bandgap (Nmin= 8). For 5 μm wavelength, 
a similar trend is observed: there is a step-like increase of
the absorbed energy with N=7 and strong deviation from
perturbative trend with Nmin=13. It is worth noting that for
irradiation with 30 fs mid-IR laser pulses, the pulse length is
a small multiple of an optical cycle. In this regime the tunnel
ionization of electrons is expected to become dominant
mechanism.

B.
Transient number density, absorbed energy and
ultrafast macroscopic currents
The ultrafast laser energy deposition and the typical
electron dynamics in the bulk of the two photoexcited
materials is shown in Fig.5 - Fig.8 for two cases of different
laser intensities, 0.05 TW/cm2 and 0.6 TW/cm2. Fig. 5 (a)
shows the transient electron densities in Ge for peak laser
intensity 0.05 TW/cm2, corresponding to the four different
wavelengths discussed in Sec. II A. The photoelectron
density displays transient oscillations due to non-linear
response of electrons, associated with the generation of
intense second harmonic. The amplitude of these transient
density oscillations increases substantially when the laser
wavelength increases from near-IR to
mid-IR region.
Charge-carrier generation occurs on the rising edge of the
pulse and competes with recombination of electron-hole
pairs
after
the
pulse
peak
to
determine
the
final
photoionization yield. A hot electron-hole plasma with
number density of around 1020 cm-3 (near-IR wavelengths)
and below 1019 cm-3 (mid-IR wavelengths) is established
after the end of the pulse. Fig. 5 (b) shows the temporal
evolution of the absorbed energy in bulk Ge after irradiation
with peak laser intensity 0.05 TW/cm2. The absorbed energy
displays
oscillatory
behavior
dependent
on
the
laser
wavelength. For irradiation with near-IR laser, energy is
efficiently transferred to the electronic system on the rising
edge of the pulse. For irradiation with mid-IR wavelengths,
large-amplitude transient fluctuations of the energy are
exhibited during the pulse, but no significant amount of
energy is transferred to electrons after the end of the

pulse.
Figure 5. Transient electron density (a) and absorbed energy per atom
(b) in bulk Ge irradiated by laser pulses of different wavelengths (indicated
in the legend). The laser pulses are linearly polarized along the [111]
direction and their peak intensity is 0.05 TW/cm2.
For the higher intensity 0.6 TW/cm2, shown in Fig.6, the
transient fluctuations of the absorbed energy are strongly
suppressed during the irradiation with near-infrared pulse (cf.
Fig. 6 (b)), however large amplitude of the oscillations is still
prominent for mid-infrared wavelengths, particularly for the
5 μm wavelength. The deposited laser energy after the end of 
the pulse is wavelength independent. A similar trend is
exhibited in the number density: regardless on the laser
wavelength, an electron-hole plasma with number density of
1021 cm-3 is established after the pulse peak, cf. Fig.6
(a).
Figure 6. Transient electron density (a) and absorbed energy per atom
(b) in bulk Ge irradiated by laser pulses of different wavelengths (indicated
in the legend). The laser pulses are linearly polarized along the [111]
direction and their peak intensity is 0.6 TW/cm2.
Fig. 7 (a-b) shows the temporal evolution of the absorbed
energy and photoelectron density in bulk Si for peak laser
intensity 0.05 TW/cm2, corresponding to the four different
wavelengths discussed in Sec. IIA. Similar to
the case of
photoexcited Ge, laser induced oscillatory dynamics of
electrons is exhibited. The amplitude of the transient energy
fluctuations is large for all four wavelengths during the
pulse. The absorbed energy after the end of the pulse is
highly inefficient for both near infrared and mid-infrared
wavelength regimes as seen in Fig. 7 (b). For near-IR
wavelengths, the density of electron-hole pairs at the pulse
peak is 1020 cm-3, and this number density is reduced with
two orders of magnitude to 1018 cm-3 after the end of the
pulse as shown in Fig. 7 (a).
For mid-IR laser, the
fluctuation in the number of conduction electrons is strongly
enhanced during the irradiation: the density of electron-hole
pairs at the pulse peak reaches 1022 cm-3. The virtual
population of the conduction band disappears after the pulse
peak and the number density of the generated real charge
carriers
is
substantially
reduced
below
1015
cm-3.
Figure 7. Transient electron density (a) and absorbed energy per atom
(b) in bulk Si irradiated by laser pulses of different wavelengths (indicated in
the legend). The laser pulses are linearly polarized along the [111] direction
and their peak intensity is 0.05 TW/cm2.
For the higher intensity 0.6 TW/cm2, shown in Fig. 8 (a-
b), the transient oscillations in energy are reduced for near
infrared wavelengths and energy is efficiently absorbed after
the end of the pulse as seen in Fig. 8 (b). The comparison
between Fig. 6 (b) and Fig. 8 (b), shows that energy is much
less efficiently absorbed in Si as compared to Ge for the
same laser irradiation conditions. This is reasonable in view
of the much larger direct bandgap in Si. Energy absorption is
less efficient for 1 μm compared to 800 nm. For 5 μm, the 
transient fluctuations of the energy overshoot during the
pulse with very high amplitude, indicating very efficient
transient energy transfer to electrons. After the end of the
pulse, energy absorption in bulk Si is 4 times more efficient
for near-infrared wavelengths than for the mid-infrared ones.
The density of the hot electron-hole plasma is around 1020
cm-3 (for near-IR wavelengths) and is around 1019 cm-3 (for
mid-IR
wavelengths)
as
shown
in
Fig.

Figure 9. Induced electric currents in bulk Si for two intensities 0.05
TW/cm2 (red) and 0.6 TW/cm2 (black) and the applied laser field with
wavelength 800 nm.
Fig. 9 shows the time evolution of the laser induced
macroscopic currents inside the bulk Si during the irradiation
with near-IR pulse of wavelength 800nm: two electric
current waveforms, corresponding to the low and high laser
intensity regimes - 50 GW/cm2 and 0.6 TW/cm2 are plotted,
and the temporal profile of the driving laser field is shown.
At the lower intensity of 50 GW/cm2, the induced electric
current lags behind the driving electric field by  π/2, which 
indicates linear response of silicon. For that reason, energy
transfer to electrons is unlikely, because negligible amount
of work is done on the electron system by the driving laser
field during each half-cycle. At the higher laser intensity -
0.6 TW/cm2, the current still lags behind by nearly π/2 
relative to the driving field, but the transient current develops
a rapid subcycle structure due to nonlinear response of the
electrons. As a consequence an efficient transfer of laser
energy to the electrons occurs during each half cycle, the
cumulative
effect
of
these
sub-cycle
energy
transfers
eventually results in dielectric breakdown.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We
have presented
theoretical/numerical results of
photo-excitation and energy absorption in Ge and Si,
irradiated with intense, ultrashort laser pulses of 30 fs, using
time-dependent
Schrodinger
equation
in
single
active
electron approximation. We obtained the wavelength and
laser intensity dependence of the absorbed energy in the bulk
of the materials. After the irradiation with near-infrared
pulses of relatively low intensity, the intensity dependence of
the electronic excitation energy exhibits perturbative trends
due to multiphoton absorption process. Tunnel ionization of
electrons is the relevant photoionization mechanism induced
by strong few-cycle, mid-infrared pulses. For Si irradiated by
mid-infrared laser pulse, we find that there is a laser intensity
threshold below which no energy is absorbed inside the bulk;
no such response is found for Ge. In the high laser intensity
regime, we find intensity thresholds above which the
absorbed energy per atom becomes independent of the laser
wavelength. In this regime, the electronic excitation energies
exceed the melting temperatures in Si and Ge, which is a
prerequisite for nonthermal melting of the materials. Below
the bulk damage threshold, the results may provide valuable
information for ultrafast changes of optical constants of
silicon and germanium at near- and mid-infrared frequencies.
Above the estimated dielectric breakdown thresholds, our
numerical results may be helpful in finding a regime of laser
parameters relevant for the nonthermal laser processing of
silicon and germanium. In a follow up paper we intend to
present results on the detailed microscopic response of
electrons in these materials, including the transient density
distributions and interband coherences.
