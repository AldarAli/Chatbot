Abstract—This work shows that two well-known spatial and
temporal mobility metrics for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs)
have drawbacks, possibly leading to invalid results. Based on
the concept of spatial dependence in the absence of move-
ment among mobile nodes, we propose mobility metrics able
to promptly capture spatial and temporal dependence among
mobile nodes. Through simulation, we compared the proposed
metrics over a diversiﬁed set of synthetic mobility models. The
results revealed that our spatial metrics can capture spatial
dependence in scenarios having different levels of node pause
time. Our temporal metric also demonstrated to be better suited
for capturing different levels of temporal dependence, without
being biased by node speed. Thus, the proposed mobility metrics
can accurately capture spatial and temporal node behavior in
MANETs.

I. INTRODUCTION
To support the growth and development of mobile ad hoc
networks (MANETs), researchers from industry and academia
have designed a variety of protocols, spanning the physical
to the application layer. Analytic modeling and simulation
are amongst the most used methods for evaluating MANET
protocols. The former has limitations due to the lack of
generalization, and the intrinsic high level of complexity [5].
The latter is by far the most used method for designing and
evaluating MANET protocols.
A mobility model is one of the most important components
in the simulation of MANETs. This component describes the
movement pattern of mobile nodes (e.g., people, vehicles), im-
pacting on protocol performance [2], [4], [11], [15], topology
and network connectivity [3], [8], [16], data replication [10],
and security [7]. Bai et al. [2] demonstrated that the perfor-
mance of a protocol can vary dramatically depending on the
adopted mobility model.
Mobility models can be classiﬁed into four categories: ran-
dom, temporal-based, spatial-based (or group-based), and with
geographic restriction [1] (Figure 1). Aiming at measuring
quantitatively and qualitatively mobility models, one can use
mobility metrics.
Bai et al. [2] proposed a framework to analyze the impact
of mobility on performance of routing protocols for MANET.
They proposed two metrics to quantify the spatial and temporal
dependence of mobile nodes. Since then, several works has
been based on these metrics for many purposes [13], [14],
Fig. 1.
Categories of mobility models in MANETs [1].
[17], [19], [20]. However, we show that those metrics have
important drawbacks (Section III). After that, we introduce
spatial and temporal metrics that overcome the described
limitations, and also propose another spatial metric, based on
the average distance among nodes (Section IV).
In order to evaluate the proposed metrics, we conducted an
extensive simulation using four well know synthetic mobility
models (Section V). Afterwards, we perform a comprehensive
analysis of metrics behavior (Section VI).
II. TERMINOLOGY
The following terminology is needed to deﬁne the mobility
metrics, and it will be used throughout this paper:
• T - Simulation time;
• N - Number of mobile nodes;
• X, Y - Length and width of the scenario;
• R - Radio communication range;
• x(i, t) is the x-coordinate of node i at time t (idem for
y(j, t)).
• θ(i, t) is the velocity angle of node i at time t.
• v(i, t) is the velocity of node i in the time t and
v(i, t0..tk) means that the velocity of node i remains
constant from t0 to tk.
• Cos(i, j, t) is the cosine of angle between the velocities
of nodes i, j:
Cos(i, j, t) =
⃗v(i, t) • ⃗v(j, t)
|⃗v(i, t)| · |⃗v(j, t)|
(1)
• SR(i, j, t) is the speed ratio between nodes i, j at time
t:
SR(i, j, t) = min(⃗v(i, t),
⃗
v(j, t))
max(⃗v(i, t),
⃗
v(j, t))

• D(i, j, t) is the Euclidean distance between nodes i, j at
time t:
D(i, j, t) =
p
(x(j, t) − x(i, t))2 + (y(j, t) − y(i, t))2
(3)
• ρ(Mp, m): indicates the Pearson correlation between the
parameter p of the mobility model M and the metric m.
III. RELATED WORK
Bai et al. [2] proposed, in their IMPORTANT framework,
two mobility metrics that should be able to quantify spatial
and temporal movement dependence among mobile nodes.
Both metrics are based on the cosine similarity between the
velocities of nodes (Equation 1).
The ﬁrst one is the Degree of Spatial Dependence between
nodes i, j at time t (DSD(i, j, t)), deﬁned in Equation 4.
DSD(i, j, t) = Cos(i, j, t) • SR(i, j, t)
(4)
Therefore, the average degree of spatial dependence (DSD)
is given as the average between all nodes during the simula-
tion. Group-based mobility models (e.g., RPGM [9]) should
present high values for DSD.
The second mobility metric proposed by Bai et al. is the
Degree of Temporal Dependence (DT D) (Equation 5), which
is calculated similarly to DSD but it considers the difference
of velocities between two time slots. Thus, the current velocity
of a mobile node is dependent on its past moving pattern. This
metric reﬂects the smoothness of node movement.
DT D(i, t, t′) = Cos(⃗v(i, t),⃗v(i, t′)) • SR(⃗vi(t),⃗vi(t′)) (5)
Temporal mobility models (e.g., Gauss-Markov [12]) should
present high values for DT D, while strongly random models
should have null DT D (i.e., zero). For the former models,
node velocity changes incrementally, unlike the abrupt changes
occurring in random models (e.g., Random Waypoint).
Based on the work by Bai et al. [2], Zhang et al. [20]
extended and developed the concept of a very similar spatial
mobility metric, called Spatial Dependence (SD). The authors
used this metric in the design of a distributed group mobility
adaptive clustering algorithm (i.e., DMGA) [20]. However,
both DSD and SD present the same limitation, which is
described in next section.
A. Limitations on Previous Metrics
The main limitation on the DSD metric (Equation 4) is
that it does not consider spatial dependence (correlation) in the
absence of node movement. While two nodes i, j are pausing,
their correlation is always zero (i.e., Cor(i, j, t) = 0), what is
not necessarily true because nodes i and j might have paused
(i.e., switched to velocity zero) just because there is some
dependence between them.
To demonstrate that the assumption may be wrong, con-
sider two mobile nodes, B and C, which are moving in
accordance to the movement pattern of their leader, node A
(Figure 2). At time t0, nodes B and C are inside node’s A

transmission range and they all start moving to points A’,
B’, and C’ where v(A, t0..t9) = 15m/s, θ(A, t0..t9) = 0,
v(B, t0..t9) = 18m/s, θ(B, t0..t9) = β, v(C, t0..t9) =
16m/s and θ(C, t0..t9) = α. By that time, they stop from t10
to t19. For this group mobility scenario, the DSD metric just
captures the correlation during the movement period (i.e., from
t0 to t9), while the correlation is considered null during pause
times (Table I). There is a clear spatial dependence among
nodes during pause times, but it is not captured by the DSD
metric. From t0 to t9 the total degree of spatial dependence
is .7034. By time t = 19, DSD has decayed to .3517. In case
the nodes continue paused for an additional 10 s, the DSD
decreases to .2345. Thus, the higher the node pause time, the
lower the metric value. Therefore, it is paramount considering
the correlation during pause periods.
IV. CONTRIBUTIONS
We propose the Improved Degree of Spatial Dependence
(IDSD), a spatial mobility metric which is able to capture
both movement and pause correlation among mobile nodes.
The second contribution is the proposal of the Improved
Degree of Temporal Dependence (IDTD), a temporal mobility
metric based on DTD [2]. Besides the pause correlation
problem, DTD was not able to distinguish temporal from
atemporal mobility models [2]. We veriﬁed that this is due
to improperly computing that metric: instead of computing
DT D(i, j, t) for each time slot t, it should only be computed
when the velocity v(i, t) changes in magnitude or direction.
With this simple modiﬁcation, IDTD can, in addition to other
beneﬁts, distinguish temporal and atemporal mobility models.
IDTD is also substantially less impacted by node speed.
In addition to that, it has higher correlation to parameter

α, a memory level parameter commonly deﬁned in tempo-
ral models such as Gauss-Markov [12] and Semi-Markov
Smooth [21].
Our third contribution is a novel spatial mobility metric,
named Degree of Node Proximity (DNP), which is capable of
distinguishing group-based mobility models from others. Be-
sides that, simulation results show that DNP is less impacted
by node pause time than DSD.
A. Pause State Movement Dependence
It is reasonable to consider that spatial dependence between
two nodes i, j at a pause time step t, DSD(i, j, t), will be
equal to the average of the last K values. The higher the
average pause time, greater is the value of K. Thus, the
Improved Degree of Spatial Dependence metric equation is
given by:
IDSD(i, j, t) =
(
PC(i, j, t)
if ⃗v(i, t) = ⃗v(j, t) = 0,
DSD(i, j, t)
otherwise.
(6)
where PC(i, j, t) is the pause correlation between nodes
i, j at time t. It is computed as follows:
PC(i, j, t) = 1
K
t−1
X
k=t−K
DSD(i, j, k)
(7)
where K is a function of the average pause time, a typical
mobility model input parameter1.
B. Improved Degree of Temporal Dependence
As explained previously, the metric DT D (Equation 5)
should be computed only when the node velocity changes,
otherwise, it will not be able to promptly catch the temporal
node behavior of a mobility model. Thus, we have that
IDTD(i, t) = 0 if v(i, t) = v(i, t− 1) and θ(i, t) = θ(i, t− 1),
and IDTD(i, t) = DTD(i, t) otherwise. Therefore, the Im-
proved Degree of Temporal Dependence (IDT D) metric is
deﬁned as follows:
IDT D = 1
P
N
X
i=1
T
X
t=1
IDT D(i, t)
(8)
where P is the number of tuples (i, t) such that IDT D(i, t) ̸=
0.
C. Degree of Node Proximity
We propose a spatial mobility metric based on the distance
between pairs of nodes, called Degree of Node Proximity
(DNP). Let AD be the average distance between all nodes
during the simulation, and MAD be the maximum average
distance expressed in units of transmission range, R. Formally
speaking:
1In fact, some mobility models have the maximum pause time (MP T)
parameter instead of average pause time (AP T). For those cases, pause time
generally has an uniform probability distribution function, and then AP T =
MP T/2.

Suppose a scenario where its width is 600 m, its length is
800 m, and the node transmission range is 100 m. Then, the
maximum average distance, MAD, is given by 5R (or 500
m). Figure 3 illustrates exactly this situation.
The proportion about AD and MAD gives a notion about
the degree of mobility dependence. When the average distance
among the nodes is constantly low, then this probably means
that nodes follow some sort of group-mobility movement. For
this reason, we deﬁne our spatial mobility metric DNP as
expressed in Equation 11.
DNP = 1 −
AD
MAD
(11)
DNP values normally range from 0 to 1. Spatial mobility
models (e.g., RPGM [9]) should present high DNP values,
while other models should present lower values. Next, we
present an extensive simulation using these metrics and a
heterogeneous set of mobility models.
V. SIMULATION
To verify the ability that our proposed mobility metrics have
to capture spatial and temporal dependence among mobile
nodes, we selected the following mobility models (the same
displayed in Figure 1):
• Random Waypoint (RWP) [6]: is probably the simplest
and most used mobility model in MANET simulation
studies. It has just three parameters: minimum and max-
imum speeds, and maximum pause time.
• Reference Point Group Mobility (RPGM) [9]: is a group-
based model where the movement of the leader of a group
inﬂuences the movement of all its members. The distance
between the leader and his members should not be greater
than a threshold, called maximum distance from center
(MDC). RPGM is more applicable for battle ﬁeld or
rescue operations scenarios.

• Gauss-Markov (GM) [12]: in this model the velocity
of mobile node is assumed to be correlated over time
and modeled as a Gauss-Markov stochastic process. GM
is a temporally dependent mobility model whereas the
degree of dependency is determined by the memory level
parameter α (0 < α < 1).
• Manhattan (MAN) [2]: is a grid-based model where
nodes follow speciﬁc paths (e.g., streets) distributed in a
rectangular grid. It is suitable for modeling the movement
of vehicular wireless networks.
The results presented in this paper depend on some assump-
tions which are required for computing mobility metrics:
i. Communication between nodes is always bidirectional
during the simulation.
ii. R is constant and equal for all nodes.
iii. N is constant during the simulation.
iv. The scenario has a two-dimensional square geometry.
Table II summarizes the main characteristic of the selected
mobility models. RPGM and MAN models are classiﬁed
as having moderate randomness. The former, because the
movements of regular nodes are limited to their leader’s, and
in the latter node movements are limited due to obstacles
spread over the scenario (e.g., city blocks). Gauss-Markov
(GM) presents variable randomness, since it depends on the
value of the memory parameter α.
BonnMotion [18] was employed for mobility scenario gen-
eration producing the synthetic traces for the mobility models.
For all scenarios, 100 nodes moved over an area of 1000m x
1000m for a period of 900 seconds. Transmission range was
set to 100, 150, and 200 meters. For the RPGM model, the
number of nodes per group (NG) was set to 10, 25, and 50,
which represents scenarios with 2, 4, and 10 groups of mobile
nodes. Maximum pause time and memory parameter were set
to a large range of values (see Table III).
All graphs present results with a conﬁdence level of 99%,
based on 10 repetitions for each one of more than 1,400
generated mobility scenarios. In some situations, the interval
length is smaller than the symbol used in the legend, making
it barely visible.
VI. ANALYSIS
Firstly, we compare the performance of the temporal metrics
DT D and IDT D. Then we show how the node pause time
affects the spatial metrics DSD and IDSD. Lastly, we also
show that our proposed metric, degree of node proximity
(DPN), is able to differentiate the mobility models used in
our simulation, and that it is not impacted by node pause time.
Fig. 4.
Degree of Temporal Dependence (DTD) percentage histograms.
A. Temporal Metrics
Table IV shows the basic descriptive statistics for the
mobility metrics. In general, random models showed moderate
DT D values, what was not expected. For some scenarios, the
DT D value for Random Waypoint and RPGM even surpassed
GM’s. The percentage histogram of DT D clearly reveals
this shortcoming (see Figure 4). On the other hand, IDT D
properly identiﬁed the Gauss-Markov model as the unique
temporal model among all under consideration, and the metric
correctly considered that the other models should have values
close to zero (Table IV).
The second problem with DT D metric is that it is very
little impacted when changing the memory parameter α in
the Gauss-Markov model (Figures 5, 6, and 7). The unique
visible change happened when α = .99. However, IDT D
demonstrated a higher correlation with α (.91 versus .35,
Table V), and consequently is better in capturing different
levels of temporal dependence than DT D.
The third problem is that DT D decreases with the incre-
ment of node speed. When maximum node speed (S) is 10
m/s, DT D is, on average, nearly 0.5. When S increases from
20 to 30, DT D decreases from 0.3 to 0.2 (Figures 5, 6, and 7).
Nevertheless, this relationship is almost imperceptible with the
IDT D metric.
B. Spatial Metrics
As stated in Section III-A, the degree of spatial dependence
DSD does not capture pause state spatial dependence (pre-
sented in Section IV-A).
Figure 8 shows the different effect that the variation of
maximum node pause time MPT causes on DSD and
IDSD in the RPGM model with 10 groups of 10 nodes
each. At point MPT = 0, both DSD and IDSD have
the same value, because nodes never stop moving. As the
node pause time increases, DSD quickly decreases. However,
IDSD increases a little bit and keeps at about the same level

until MPT = 500s, when then it starts decreasing. Similar
behavior also happens in Figures 9 and 10. Although IDSD
also decreases, this occurred in a much more slower fashion
than occurred with DSD. This is due to the smaller correlation
between MPT and IDSD (ρ(RPGMMP T , DSD) = −.58
and ρ(RPGMMP T , IDSD) = −.32, Table V).
Therefore, IDSD presents more accurate values for spatial
dependence among nodes than DSD. For most real scenarios,
where MPT is low or moderate, IDSD keeps nearly the
same value as for MPT = 0. Even in unusual scenarios,
where nodes stay longer paused than moving, IDSD still
presents higher spatial dependence values.
Concerning our second spatial mobility metric, Degree of
Node Proximity (DNP), its histogram clearly distinguished
the spatial dependency model (RPGM) from others, and
showed similar patters for RWP and MAN models (Figure 11).
GM presented the lowest DNP standard deviation.
Figure 12 shows the effect that MPT causes on DNP
for all the mobility models that have that input parameter.

In the RPGM model, MPT caused a constant small drop in
DNP. In the RWP model, DNP has a considerable drop for
MT P = 100s, but then it remains approximately constant.
On the other hand, the DNP in the MAN model was little
affected by MPT .
Comparing the relationship between IDSD and MPT , and
between DNP and MPT , the difference is that in the last
one, there is a constant small decay of DNP, instead of in

Anyway, both IDSD and DNP are better than DSD, as they
are extensively less affected by MPT .

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we introduced the concept of pause state
movement dependence, which considers the possible existence
of spatial dependence among nodes in a mobile ad hoc
network (Section IV-A). From this concept, we proposed the
Improved Degree of Spatial Dependence (IDSD) mobility
metric. IDSD revealed to be better than DSD [2] at capturing
the spatial dependence in scenarios having different patterns
of node pause times (Section VI-B).
We also proposed another spatial mobility metric, Degree
of Node Proximity DNP, which also presented better results
than DSD. Besides this, we also proposed a new temporal
mobility metric, called Improved Degree of Temporal Depen-
dence (IDT D) that demonstrated to be better than DT D [2]
in three aspects: capturing different levels of temporal de-
pendence, properly identiﬁed the Gauss-Markov model as the
unique temporal model among all under consideration in this
work, correctly setting other models to produce values near
zero, and it is not inﬂuenced by node speed.
For future work we plan to investigate the use of the
proposed mobility metrics in the design of mobility-aware
adaptive routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks.
