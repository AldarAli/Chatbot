Abstract— Medical errors, such as patient misidentification, are 
the reason for around 2.6 million deaths per annum and around 
$42 billion in costs for health organizations in low to middle-
income countries. While wristbands are the most common 
method for identifying patients, they can be easily misplaced 
and may contain missing or inaccurate information as this study 
shows. This may result in wrong medications and surgeries and 
in some instances, even preventable deaths along with liabilities 
for the health organizations. An in-depth literature review is 
conducted in this study and the current methods and process for 
identifying patients are also investigated, accompanied by a 
comparison of existing patient identification solutions, as well as 
issues and concerns about health data protection and privacy. 
Following this, the system requirements are determined 
through a qualitative analysis from a questionnaire distributed 
to different healthcare professionals. Subsequently, the 
effectiveness of biometric technology for patient identification 
through face recognition is examined. The paper finally 
proposes and evaluates a proof of concept with promising 
results for minimizing patient identification errors.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Patient misidentification is a recognized worldwide 
problem faced by medical organizations of different types and 
sizes [1]–[3]. It is estimated that around 2.6 million people die 
each year, in just low to middle-income countries, due to 
medical errors [4], including errors of patient identification 
[5]. 9% of 7,600 (684) patient misidentification events 
captured in 181 different health organizations over the span of 
32 months in the US led to patient harm, and in some cases, 
death [9]. Patient identification errors occur on different levels 
throughout the medical field. Various medical wards and units 
have been subject to such errors, including but not limited to, 
maternity wards, oncology centres, Intensive Care Units 
(ICU) and children’s hospitals. In certain situations, such 
misidentification has led to severe consequences, one of 
which is the death of a patient [4][6]. According to the World 
Health Organization [4], between November 2003 and July 
2005, the United Kingdom had 236 reported incidents related 
to missing wristbands or wristbands with incorrect 
information, the United States of America also had more than 
100 similar cases reported from January 2000 to March 2003.  
The National Patient Misidentification Report conducted 
by Ponemon Institute LLC in 2016 in the US [19] highlights 
the primary root causes of patient misidentification. The main 
three reasons include incorrect patient identification at the 
point of registration, time pressure when treating patients, and 
thirdly, lack of employee training and awareness. The report 
also outlines the health organization's financial impact, where 
the denial of claims costs the average healthcare organization 
$1.2 million a year. In a survey conducted by the same 
institute, seventy-six per cent (76%) of the respondents, who 
work in different types of organizations, such as large 
hospitals and small clinics, responded that biometrics at the 
patient registration point could reduce denied claims. 
Patient misidentification may also lead to duplicate 
medical records that are time-consuming for organizations to 
manage and arrange [7]. An increase in insurance fraud for 
intentional misidentification may also be the cause of errors in 
patient identification. The National Health Care Anti-Fraud 
Association of the United States [8] estimates that the 
financial losses due to health care fraud are between 3-10% of 
the annual health care expenditure, which could lead to more 
than $300 billion a year. Moreover, according to the Medical 
Theft Alliance (MIFA), more than 2 million American 
citizens have been victims of medical identity theft, with cases 
rising each year [9]. 
This study analyses the effectiveness of using biometric 
technology for identifying patients by performing a literature 
review in Section II on the current problems caused by patient 
misidentification, followed by elucidating the process of 
identifying patients, current existing identification solutions, 
and the security and privacy issues and concerns regarding 
identifying patients. For the methodology in Section III, a list 
of system requirements is developed after distributing a 
questionnaire to a number of health professionals and 
analysing the responses. Once the requirements are 
documented, a system based on face recognition technology 
is proposed and designed in Section IV followed by its 
evaluation against a dataset in Section V. Finally, the results 
are analysed, and further improvements are suggested in 
Sections VI and VII. 
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Despite patient identification errors being preventable, 
many hospitals worldwide do not have patient identification 
systems implemented [13]. The first goal of The Joint 
Commission's National Patient Safety Goals (NPSG) for 2020 
is to improve patient identification accuracy, both in hospitals 
and laboratories. Although the World Health Organization 
(WHO), the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) [10], 
and other authors all promote the use of technology for

reducing errors in patient identification [4][10][11]. It was 
found by the same ECRI that technology itself was the actual 
cause in 15% of patient misidentification errors. One of the 
potential barriers to mitigating or reducing patient 
identification errors is the costs associated with implementing 
such solutions [3]. 
The National Patient Misidentification Report conducted 
by Ponemon Institute LLC in 2016 [19] determines the 
primary root causes of patient misidentification. The top three 
reasons included incorrect patient identification at the 
registration point of time, which may consist of placing an 
incorrect wristband, time pressure when treating patients, and 
lack of employee training and awareness. The report also 
outlines the health organisation's financial impact, mainly due 
to denial of claims, costing the average healthcare 
organization $1.2 million a year. Table I shows more detailed 
cost calculations. In a survey conducted by the same institute, 
seventy-six per cent (76%) of the respondents, who work in 
different types of organizations such as large hospitals and 
small clinics, responded that biometrics at the patient 
registration point could reduce denied claims. The report also 
outlined that sixty-nine per cent (69%) of the survey 
respondents spend more than thirty (30) minutes per shift 
contacting medical records or other departments to get critical 
information about their patients. Patient misidentification may 
also lead to duplicate medical records that are time-consuming 
for organizations to manage and fix [13]. It is therefore 
necessary to understand the process for patient identification 
in health organizations to determine any points where patient 
misidentification is likely to occur.

MISIDENTIFICATION 
 
 
A. Patient Identification Process (PIP) 
77% of wrong-patient incidents, identifying the patient 
was not described at all in the incident reports [14]. In a report 
conducted for the Australian Commission on Safety and 
Quality in Health Care [15], patient identification and 
profiling mark the beginning of a patient journey in a hospital 
(Figure 1). The report emphasises on the importance of 
providing the patient with a unique identifier that stays with 
the patient for the rest of the journey and other future journeys 
or visits. The Bay of Plenty District Health Board [16] 
recommends using at least three approved identifiers to 
identify a patient correctly. These include the patient’s name, 
date of birth, and the National Health Index number, with the 
latter depending on the country’s person identification 
system in place. A patient’s bed or room number is not 
considered an approved identifier and should always be 
avoided [16], [17]. A patient's profile would include any 
information that can be used to confirm the patient's identity. 
The Australian Commission’s same report [16] suggests that 
part of this information can be included in the wristband. It 
also recommends that the wristband (or a tag) should link to 
the patient’s health record in the system. 
 
 
 
 
B. Identification Methods 
While patient identification errors can be preventable [10], 
many hospitals worldwide do not have patient identification 
systems implemented [18]. The first goal of The Joint 
Commission's National Patient Safety Goals (NPSG) for 
2020 is to improve patient identification accuracy, both in 
hospitals and laboratories [19]. Although many [10]–[12], 
[17], [18], [20] promote the use of technology for reducing 
errors in patient identification, it was found that technology 
itself was the actual cause in 15% of patient misidentification 
errors [10]. One of the potential barriers for mitigating or 
reducing patient identification errors is the costs associated 
with implementing such solutions [17]. 
 
1) Wristbands 
Full implementation of a barcode-based Electronic 
Positive Patient and Specimen Identification (EPSID) system 
can result in a significant reduction in mislabeled specimens 
over three (3) years [21]. However, other studies identified 
wristbands as one of the leading causes of patient 
misidentification [22], [5]. The main issues are missing or 
wrong information and patients having more than one 
wristband. Implementing a simple wristbands system for 
patient identification is considered a low-cost practice for 
health organizations [23]. Since the simple wristbands with 
handwritten information on them are still prone to human 
error, the use of barcodes [23] or RFID [18] can reduce or 
mitigate patient identification errors. 
Efficacy of a barcode wristband system on the prevention 
of medical errors indicated that the system can reduce some 
medical errors by an estimated 12.22% to 57.4% in different 
hospitals [24], [25], and medication error rate by 56% and by 
47% in neonatal intensive care units [26], [27]. A barcode 
wristband system can help such organizations in saving 
Figure 1.  A patient journey in a hospital [15]

roughly $684,000 a year, from just denial of claims [28]. 
There are various standards and specifications for patient 
wristbands [15], [16], [29], [30]. The main specifications of a 
wristband include the size, colour, usability, method of 
identification, and information presentation while allowing 
for integrating technologies such as barcodes on the bands. 
While wristbands are portable, relatively cheap, and 
generally easy to use, multiple problems can arise. One study 
concluded that 1 out of 84,000 barcode scans generated an 
incorrect patient identifier and as many as three (3) incorrect 
patient identifiers were outputted from a barcode [31]. 
Although this is a minimal number, these cases can still be 
fatal for a patient and costly for health organizations. 
 
2) Palm Vein Pattern Recognition 
Palm vein scanning is a widespread method of verifying 
and authenticating a user [32]. Given that each patient’s palm 
vein pattern is unique and very stable over the person’s 
lifetime, it makes this method the most commonly used 
successful technology for identifying people [33]. A palm 
vein scanner uses a near-infrared light wave to capture the 
user’s vein pattern on the palm. In contrast with other 
recognition methods, palm veins have internal features 
making it almost impossible to reproduce with fake palms 
[34].  
The stages of palm print authentication include acquiring 
the palm vein image, enhancement, extraction, matching, and 
authentication [32]. As for developing a palm vein pattern 
image, only specific blood flow patterns are considered for the 
sake of image clarity. The three methods for capturing 
vascular images are X-Rays, Ultrasonic Images (Ultrasound), 
and Infrared Imaging. The latter is the preferred method 
because of its non-invasive contactless, and nonharmful 
technique. While there are two types of Infrared technologies 
that can be used, Far-Infrared and Near-Infrared, the latter is 
used as it is less expensive to operate and is able to capture 
smaller veins, making it adequate for identification. However, 
Far-Infrared technology can capture thermal patterns that are 
unique even to identical twins [35]. 
While taking into consideration the accuracy of the palm 
vein scanning method, it is worth noting that this method is 
more costly when compared to the barcode wristband 
alternative. This is due to its unique software in addition to the 
installation and the implementation of the palm scanners. This 
form of method is also considered to be more intrusive for a 
patient as it may raise palm image storage security concerns. 
However, when compared to the fingerprint or face 
recognition methods, the palm vein scanners are favorable 
within this regard. Another issue worth considering is the 
matter of hygiene as when comparing methods, a noncontact 
method would be ideal, examples of this include barcode 
scanning and face recognition. 
 
3) Ocular-based Identification 
Two types of ocular-based identification technologies 
used to identify a person uniquely are iris and retinal scanning. 
The retina is the thin tissue located at the back of the eyeball, 
containing cells sensitive to light. It is composed of a complex 
structure of capillaries that supply the retina with blood and 
therefore, every person’s retina is unique. Similar to palm vein 
pattern recognition, a retinal scan would map a person’s 
retina's unique patterns. The iris is a thin circular structure 
behind the cornea of the eye, which is responsible for 
controlling the size of the pupils and, therefore, the amount of 
light reaching the retina. The complexity of the retina patterns 
makes it unique for every person. Unlike iris or palm vein 
scanning, retinal scanning uses camera technology with little 
infrared illumination to capture the retina's intricate structures' 
images. 
Iris recognition method would be ideal in a health 
organization environment as it does not require proximity to a 
camera for a successful scan and uses safer low-energy 
infrared lighting. Moreover, retina scan accuracy may be 
affected by certain diseases [36] and iris scanning proved to 
be the most secure patient identification method in UCSD’s 
Moore Cancer Center when implemented [37]. 
 
4) Face Recognition 
Face recognition can be described as determining the 
identity of an individual based on the person's facial features. 
The challenge of facial recognition in its simplest form 
involves comparing two face images and deciphering if they 
are of the same person [38]. A more significant challenge 
arises when faces exhibit changes in appearance due to make-
up, facial hair, and accessories, such as jewellery.  
The process of identifying a face through a face 
recognition system is similar to that of iris recognition. The 
steps involved include acquiring the face image, the face 
detection, recognition, and identification [39]. During the face 
detection phase, an algorithm is used to do corrections, skin 
segmentation, and facial feature extraction from the digital 
face image. One of these algorithms is the Viola-Jones 
Algorithm, which is considered the first-ever real-time face 
detection system [40]. In the next stage of face recognition, 
the modified face image from the previous phase is classified 
to identify the person from a database. Different algorithms, 
which include FeedForward Neural Network (FFNN) [39], 
and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) [41] are used here as well. 
One implementation of facial recognition with Microsoft 
Kinect v2 sensor for patient veriﬁcation proved to be over 
96% accurate [5]. However, each scan took around thirty (30) 
seconds to complete, a time frame that is unsatisfactory for a 
healthcare environment, but this can be classified as a 
limitation to the technology used, Microsoft Kinect v2, as 
other studies showed promising results in terms of 
performance, with time reduced to 100ms with the same level 
of accuracy [27][28]. 
 
C. Security and Privacy 
The security and privacy areas in patient identification are 
habitually overlooked [29]. Privacy is also a significant 
concern for the patients themselves [46], and implementing a 
biometric system for improving patient identification 
accuracy is known to impose more privacy concerns for the 
patient [47].

1) Health and Data Breaches 
According to a report issued by McAfee [48], a stolen 
health record would generally sell more than financial data on 
the black market. This is mainly because health data does not 
have that many established markets like financial data. 
Another study conducted by Infosec Institute (2015), shows 
that there was a 73% increase in cyberattacks between 2013 
and 2014 targeted to healthcare organizations and that the 
average cost of a stolen health record amounted to $363 on the 
black market compared to $1 - $2 of the stolen credit card 
information. Health data breaches tripled in a year between 
2017 and 2018 and there were over 15 million patient records 
breached in 2018 in the United States [49]. 
One of the most common causes of insider-related 
breaches is family member snooping [49], that is, healthcare 
workers spying on their family members. This cause 
amounted to around 67% of the breach cases, while the second 
most common type of breach was snooping on their co-
workers, amounting to approximately 15% of the violations. 
Insiders, which are the healthcare workers, are also more 
likely to commit another breach after their first violation, as 
51% of the offences are repeated. 
 
2) Privacy 
Storing and processing patients' personal and sensitive 
data calls for strict privacy protection measures to minimize 
patient privacy issues as much as possible. Biometrics privacy 
can be interlinked with personal privacy, given that our 
biometric information can uniquely identify us [50]. Various 
studies address different patient privacy concerns and 
implications [32][36]. In some cases where biometric 
technology is in place, patients refused to be subject to such 
technology due to privacy and confidentiality concerns [12]. 
Some biometric technologies proved to have a high 
acceptability rate, such as face recognition and voice 
recognition [5]. In contrast, others, such as iris and retina 
scanning  [52],  had a lower acceptability rate. Other studies 
however showed that biometric technologies are less or non-
invasive than traditional methods of identification [5]. 
While there are no legislations covering the usage of 
biometric identification systems [53], and yet the right of 
privacy is considered a fundamental human right [54], 
safeguards must be set down for every step, from collection to 
retention of the data collected. Individuals must be given 
rights to access, correct and delete their data [50]. 
Furthermore, individuals should be assigned the ability to opt 
out, so biometric technologies should not be the only 
implementation for identification. 
 
3. Security 
Biometric technologies can help in identifying patients 
accurately and provide the right authorization and 
authentication or verification for accessing and amending 
medical records [38], [55]. The user asserts an identity for 
confirmation, and the biometric system confirms if the 
assertion is genuine. This process is generally used to prevent 
unauthorized access to a system or services. Verification can 
be explained formally using (1), where, given a claimed 
identity 𝐼 and a query feature set 𝑥𝐴, the decision if (𝐼, 𝑥𝐴) 
belongs to the ‘genuine’ or ‘impostor’ class needs to be taken. 
If 𝑥𝐼
𝐸 is the stored template that corresponds to the identity 𝐼, 
𝑥𝐴 is compared with 𝑥𝐼
𝐸 and a score s is matched, which 
measures the similarity between 𝑥𝐴and 𝑥𝐸, and 𝜂 would be a 
predefined threshold. 
 
     
(𝐼, 𝑥𝐴 ) ∈ { 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑒, 𝑖𝑓 𝑠 ≥  𝜂,
 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟, 𝑖𝑓 𝑠 <  𝜂,       
      (1) 
 
However, biometric solutions can have their security flaws 
as well [41][42]. The biometric system's integrity is 
determined by its ability to guarantee non-repudiable 
authentication, that is, ensuring that a user who accesses a 
specific resource cannot later deny in using it. There are four 
major classes of security threats to biometric systems [6][26] 
and these are Denial of Service (DoS), Intrusion, Repudiation 
and Function Creep. Although it is much harder for an 
impostor to forge biometric traits than hacking traditional 
passwords, there are studies suggesting the use of multimodal 
biometric systems where multiple types of biometric features 
would be measured and compared, for example, fingerprints 
and face, for better accuracy [43][44]. 
 
The goal of this paper is to provide a proof of concept of 
the most favoured method of biometric patient identification 
determined through the methodology and evaluate its results 
against an already established dataset. Limitations and 
possible improvements are then suggested. 
 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
A questionnaire was developed and distributed to 
professional 
healthcare 
participants 
using 
purposeful 
sampling, and its results are analysed. Consequently, 
requirements are determined, documented and validated using 
a House of Quality matrix and system designs are proposed. 
 
A. Research Instrument 
The questionnaire developed and conducted was sectioned 
into four (4) main sections: 
 
• 
Background Information - gathering brief, non-
personal information about the stakeholder, including 
their profession, roles, and practical experience. 
• 
The Problem - capturing the stakeholder’s awareness 
of patient misidentification and its consequences, 
globally and in the organization in which they 
practice in. 
• 
Their Process of Identifying a Patient in their 
Organization – gathering information about the 
current process that health professionals use to 
identify patients. They were asked to explain the 
process briefly and what identifiers are used and at 
what point. They were also asked of awareness of any 
of the patient identification methods mentioned 

84
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 13 no 1 & 2, year 2021, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/

earlier in this study and which of them are used in 
their organization, if any. Finally, they were asked to 
provide 
feedback 
on 
their 
current 
patient 
identification method, and if they think that it can be 
improved and on what aspects, such as accuracy, 
security and cost. 
• 
The Solution(s) - participants were asked which 
patient identification methods they would implement 
in their organization, how would they prioritize them 
and why. They were also invited to prioritize the 
characteristics and the concerns of a biometric patient 
identification system in terms of security, accuracy, 
and efficiency. 
 
B. Participants 
Participants chosen that successfully answered all the 
questions which were provided to them amounted to nine (9), 
and these were staff nurses (2), an Accident and Emergency 
(A&E) nurse, a doctor, a general practitioner (GP), a urology 
surgeon, physiotherapists (2), and a speech-language 
pathologist. All the participants work in local health 
organizations in Malta. The GP owns, manages, and works in 
a small private healthcare clinic.  The nurses, the doctor, and 
the urology surgeon work in a national hospital, while the 
physiotherapists and the speech-language pathologist work in 
smaller private healthcare organizations. 
 
C. Results Analysis 
All the respondents think that their current patient 
identification system works moderately well (67%) or very 
well (33%) (Fig. 2). Hence, participants were also asked to 
identify the vital positive characteristics of their current 
patient identification system, and these included the cost, 
where 58% rated it as very well, followed by ease of use and 
efficiency (17%), and patient’s comfort in using it, where 30% 
of the participants classified it as very well, as shown in Figure 
1. Security was the least rated, with 33% rating it as just 
slightly well. 25% of the respondents classified security as an 
aspect that needs to be improved in their current system, along 
with accuracy. Moreover, 89% of the participants said that, 
currently, it takes less than 15 seconds to identify a patient, 
with 33% of them stating that it even takes less than 5 seconds. 
Therefore, essential requirements that needed to remain there 
are the system's cost, ease of use, patient’s comfort in using it, 
and efficiency (processing speed). On the other hand, other 
aspects that require improvements are security and accuracy. 
D. Requirements 
One of the most commonly used methods to achieve a 
standard view of the relationship between customer 
requirements and product design is Quality Function 
Deployment (QFD) [60]. QFD is a product development 
methodology that gives importance to the customer's opinions 
throughout the development process. QFD was used in this 
study to determine the list of important requirements for the 
proposed system. Customer importance ratings for system 
requirements were calculated based on the results obtained 
 
from the questionnaire distributed to health professionals in 
the order of Accuracy, Efficiency, Security, Ease of Use, Cost 
and Patient’s Comfort. On the other hand, the requirements 
concluded from the previous section were listed on the other 
side of the matrix. The conditions that scored the highest 
importance ratings were found to be Cost, Use of Secondary 
Identification Methods, Accuracy, Availability, and The Use 
of Alternative Non-Biometric Identification Methods. 
 
With the cost being the topmost essential requirement for 
the customer, any negative correlations related to this 
requirement should be addressed and ideally eliminated as 
soon as possible. Therefore, alternative non-biometric 
identification methods should be kept to a minimum and only 
used in cases where the patient refuses to use other biometric 
methods, for example. Patients will most probably opt for 
these alternative methods if they have trust concerns about the 
system, and hence the importance of Transparency. Each 
customer should be as transparent as possible to the patients 
about the biometric system, ensuring no physical harm will be 
done and securing their data safety while pointing out the 
benefits of such techniques for their own good. We must 
remember that using alternative non-biometric systems may 
negatively impact user training, the effort of operating the 
system, and identification accuracy. 
 
IV. 
DESIGN 
High-level and low-level designs of the system and 
integration with the possible current systems are proposed. 
Furthermore, designs of the proposed mobile application are 
also portrayed together with data and process flows. Taking 
Systems Theory into perspective, the proposed system would 
have biometric information as an input and after biometric 
processing and communication with the Patient Medical 
Record System (MRS) or Database, outputs the patient 
information. 
For patient identification, the app user needs to be 
authorised and authenticated. The app should display multiple 
authentication choices, including but not limited to Face 
 
Figure 2.  Question results for ranking aspects of the system

Recognition, Fingerprint Recognition, or a user account. Data 
collected at this stage is transferred securely to an internal API 
where it is processed. Through in-house or third-party APIs, 
if needed, roles and permissions are determined and set, and 
the user is then allowed to proceed and identify a patient on 
the app. 
Provided the user is authenticated and authorized on the 
mobile application, the user can identify a patient, which has 
already been registered before, that is, the patient’s biometric 
data required for identification has been securely stored on a 
database or service. After the patient has given consent and 
the biometric data is collected, such as a face photo, this data 
is sent through a secure and encrypted channel, such as 
HTTPS, to an internal API, which communicates to third party 
APIs, such as Microsoft Facial Recognition, and handles the 
identification and the fetching of patient information and 
medical records if needed to be sent back to the app so that 
vital patient information can be displayed. 
 
The users can be provided with different options to 
authenticate themselves (Fig. 4a). Viable options include face 
or fingerprint recognition or a user account. 
 
a) Face Recognition - A 
A similar process used to identify patients through face 
biometrics can be used here to identify and authorize a user. 
b) Fingerprint - B 
Most of the modern smartphones are equipped with an 
inbuilt fingerprint sensor. This may be used to authenticate the 
user. However, this may require more development effort to 
implement. 
c) User account - C 
A user account is also another option, although less 
preferred since it is more time-consuming to develop and 
maintain. The integration of Microsoft Azure AD will help in 
improving performance if Microsoft Face Recognition is used 
for patient identification. 
 
Figure 3 shows the proposed flow of the mobile 
application used to identify patients by their face. Adopting 
two identifiers for identifying a patient, as suggested by the 
WHO [2], the first stage includes scanning the barcode or QR 
code printed on the wristband wearing the patient. The app 
should immediately display the camera preview after 
successful authentication, for the user to scan the barcode 
(Fig. 4b). The barcode should be recognised very quickly, and 
the Patient Identifier stored on the barcode or QR code is 
captured by the app. Once a barcode or QR code is 
successfully captured, the user should be prompted to capture 
the patient’s biometric data. For this study, the method of face 
recognition using Microsoft Face Recognition is showcased. 
Therefore, the user is asked to take a photo of the patient’s 
face, as straightforward as possible. The user should confirm 
the image taken for the identification process to initiate. 
Upon identification completion, if succeeded, the user is 
prompted with a pop-up dialog asking to confirm the 
identification details, to ensure the identification and update 
biometrics or to scan again (Fig. 4c). Updating biometrics 
would send the last patient’s face photo to Microsoft Face

AI training. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
V. 
EVALUATION 
The primary identification method of face recognition is 
implemented using Microsoft Cognitive Services and their 
Face API [61]. There are various reasons for opting for 
Microsoft Cognitive Services, and these reasons all cohere 
with the system requirements established earlier. Evaluation 
of the proposed system was divided into three stages: 
 
A. Applicability 
Microsoft Face API is a seamless, secure and an easy to 
integrate and operate API for face detection, emotion 
recognition, and identification. Microsoft Face API can be 
utilised in different scenarios, such as user authentication and 
counting people in a crowd.

1) Face Detection 
Face Detection can detect up to 100 faces in an image 
along with different attributes such as age, position, smile, 
emotion, facial hair, makeup and occlusions, such as masks 
and bandanas when a photo or image URL is passed as a 
parameter. No images are stored, but only the landmarks are 
stored, which cannot be used on their own to identify a person. 
 
2) Face Recognition 
Face Identification compares face landmarks previously 
stored on the API from adding faces to a person in a person 
group or large person group to an input image face landmarks. 
The API returns a confidence level (1-10) for the user to 
decide if the prediction is up to the user’s expectations or not. 
The API also accepts a confidence threshold as a parameter to 
filter out results based on the user’s preference for confidence. 
For example, in identifying patients, a confidence level below 
80% (0.8) might not be acceptable, and therefore, a confidence 
threshold of 0.8 or greater should be passed. 
 
3) Security 
One of the most critical concerns addressed by health 
professionals in the questionnaire conducted for this study is 
the system's security. Microsoft ensures security by firstly not 
storing any actual face images on their servers, and secondly 
by encrypting any data stored using FIPS 140-2 compliant 
256-bit AES encryption. FIPS 140-2 is a U.S. Government 
computer security standard used to approve cryptographic 
modules [62]. 
 
4) Cost 
As for the cost of usage, the standard version allows for up 
to 10 transactions per second, with €0.506 per 1,000 
transactions for 5 to 10 million transactions and €0.338 per 
1,000 transactions for transactions amounting to more than 
100 million. As for storage, €0.009 per 1,000 faces per month 
is charged. A transaction constitutes an API call, apart from 
the training calls where a transaction counts for every 1,000 
images trained. Table II shows a detailed pricing scheme for 
Microsoft Face API.

5) Limitations 
Like all other face recognition methods, there are some 
limitations that may hinder the system's accuracy. Various 
face occlusions, such as masks and makeup, or face injuries 
and ageing, may prevent face recognition algorithms from 
detecting or identifying a face. While many face recognition 
technologies cater for occlusions measurement when 
detecting a face, face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic 
impacted face recognition algorithms' overall accuracy [63]. 
Such a situation requires the need for alternative identification 
methods, such as retina recognition, to be available in the 
system. 
 
 
 
 
B. Accuracy Evaluation 
A dataset of multiple faces was used to evaluate a person's 
identification accuracy through Microsoft Face API. The 
dataset was introduced in an another study [64] to provide 
more diversity than the existing publicly available datasets 
regarding lighting, age, and ethnicity. The dataset consists of 
3755 faces, totalling to 276 participants in all. Each participant 
has at least eight (8) face photos, each from a different angle 
or different lighting (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). 
The image filenames have the form of i000qa-fn.jpg, 
where: 
• 
i is the prefix of all files,  
• 
000 is the subject identification number,  
• 
q is the lighting type, ranging from q to z,  
• 
a is the camera angle, ranging from a to e,  
• 
f  for female or m for male,  
• 
n for no glasses or g for with glasses. 
 
This naming convention was used as wildcards in code 
during the evaluation process, as explained later on in this sub-
chapter. This dataset was chosen to be used in this study as it 
fits nicely into healthcare scenarios for identifying different 
patients.

The following ‘setup’ process was adopted to evaluate the 
identification accuracy of Microsoft Face API: 
1. 
A large person group with a name ‘test’ was created, 
and the returned largePersonGroupId was stored, to be used 
later to identify a face. 
2. 
For each of the subjects in the dataset: 
a. 
The subject was added to the large person group just 
created, and the identification number was used as the name 
(for example ‘000’). 
b. 
The face was added to the person using the first 
image file of the subject. 
3. 
After all subjects are added, the large person group 
was trained by calling the train API endpoint. 
 
Once all the subjects in the dataset were registered, the 
following identification process was conducted for each 
participant: 
• 
The face was detected, and the faceId returned was 
stored. 
• 
The face is identified, passing the faceId in the request 
body and the largePersonGroupId captured earlier 
when creating the group. If identified, a list of 
potential candidates should be returned, each with a 
personId and a confidence level. 
• 
The person was identified and confirmed by getting 
the person in the large person group by the personId 
captured in the previous step. The person name and 
the file identification number were compared, and if 
these matched, identification was successful. 
 
Figure 7 portraits the identification evaluation flow. 
 
 
C. Performance Evaluation 
The second stage of evaluation ensures that the second 
most crucial requirement established, efficiency is maintained 
throughout the identification process. For this, a simple 
mobile application was developed, simulating a patient's 
identification using two identifiers, a barcode and a face. Once 
this is done, the app prompts the user to take a photo of a face, 
and this is sent to Microsoft Face API upon confirmation for 
identification. Both the barcode key and the person identified 
from the API are compared, and if matched, a call to a 
database is made to fetch the records of the patient. The whole 
process was timed for efficiency evaluation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VI. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The results of the previously explained evaluation 
processes are analysed and discussed in detail. There are 
specific scenarios where the system performed very well, but 
there are others in which accuracy was challenged, and 
possible improvements are suggested for these cases. 
 
A. Accuracy of Face Recognition 
There were eight (8) types of datasets that were used to 
assess the accuracy of the proposed system (Fig. 7). These will 
be referenced as a, b, c, d, e and qa, rb, sb. a – e represent the 
different angles of the camera from which the photo was 
taken, while q, r and s represent the amount of light exposed 
to the face, with s > r  > q. 
The thresholds used for evaluating the accuracy of the 
system ranged from 0.97 to 0.92. Anything above the 
threshold of 0.97 resulted in less than 80% accuracy, which is 
not considered safe enough for such a critical system. On the 
other hand, any threshold below 0.92 always resulted in 100% 
accuracy in all scenarios tested.

1) Case 1 – Camera Angles 
In the first case, the first set of faces qa, that is, photos 
taken from in front of the person (a) and with lighting set q, 
was added to the API and trained. After that, all the other 
photos from the remaining angles were tested for 
identification against different thresholds. 
As seen in Table III, the accuracy results obtained by 
training just qa were always above 88% for 276 photos. It can 
be noted that angles b and c resulted in less accuracy than 
angles d and e. Therefore, side angles seem to be less accurate 
than front angles. Angles c and d provided the same accuracy 
results, while angle d proved to be the best angle for obtaining 
accurate results. 
TABLE III.  
CASE 1 RESULTS 
 
 
2) Case 2 – Lighting 
In the second case, with trained set qa, all the other 
remaining photos with r and s lighting exposed to them were 
tested for identification with different thresholds. 
In this case, accuracy suffered much more when different 
lighting was used on the person’s face. As shown in Table IV, 
the accuracy went down to 43.96% and 39.56% from 88.04 
and above 99% from the previous case. This indicates that 
lighting has a significant effect on identifying a person from 
their face, and a less threshold of 0.92 compared to 0.94 had 
to be used for achieving 100% accuracy on the 91 photos 
tested. Lighting set r performed better than set s significantly. 
Significant changes were also noted when the threshold was 
changed each time by 0.01, with accuracy changes of more 
than 30% in some cases. 
Since this case resulted in low accuracy results in some 
scenarios, set ra was added to the API and trained, and set sb 
was tested again. The same angle of the previously trained set 
was used (a) for consistency. This was done to note the 
difference in accuracy and the effectiveness of training. Table 
IV shows the accuracy results of set rb when tested, while sets 
qa and ra are trained already. 
Accuracy improved significantly for set sb when ra was 
added and then trained. With 0.97 as the threshold, accuracy 
improved by more than 24% and by more than 17% for the 
0.96 threshold (Table V). This shows that dataset training 
provided by Microsoft Face API does improve identification 
accuracy. 
 
B. Integration Efficiency Test 
For this case, a simple mobile application was developed 
to showcase the use of the proposed system by the users. The 
app communicates with a custom developed API hosted on 
Microsoft Azure, which then communicates to Microsoft Face 
API and a database with records of patients, also hosted on 
Microsoft Azure. The process took between 5 to 7 seconds 
when timed in code, with full-bar Wi-Fi connectivity, to detect 
and identify the face through the API, and to get the patient’s 
allergies and conditions list from a sample database. This 
result coheres with the efficiency requirement established 
earlier for identification to take not more than 15 seconds and 
ideally not more than 5 seconds.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We recognise that patient misidentification is a known 
global problem in various healthcare organizations, and it can 
lead to further complications to the patients and the 
organizations themselves. While biometric technology is 
applied in multiple sectors, such as authentication and 
security, payroll, and banking, there are fewer studies on the 
application of biometric technology for positive patient 
identification. This study conducted a questionnaire among 
different health professionals to determine the top concerns 
for implementing a biometric system in healthcare. These 
included security, accuracy, cost, and patient cooperation. 
While most of the participants were aware of some of the 
biometric methods for patient identification, none of them has 
ever made use of any of them but would consider in doing so, 
given a better accuracy rate and robust security. The 
quantitative analysis obtained from the questionnaire helped 
in determining and prioritising the proposed system 
requirements, although a further study can be conducted with 
a more extensive questionnaire and more participants. 
For the proof of concept, this study evaluated the 
implementation of face recognition biometric technology for 
identifying patients, as this was the most preferred biometric

method chosen by the questionnaire participants. Microsoft 
Face API was used as the third-party provider for identifying 
faces, and the proposed system was evaluated against its 
accuracy 
and 
efficiency, 
among 
other 
requirements 
determined. While results were promising with over 80% 
accuracy in most cases, this technology seemed to lack in 
identifying faces with occlusions, such as different lighting. 
When more than one face photo from different angles and 
different lighting are registered and trained, accuracy was 
improved significantly.  
As for future works, the system needs to be evaluated 
against a larger dataset with a larger variety of face occlusions 
to mimic real-case scenarios in health organizations. Further 
studies on the security aspects of the system are also important 
to be conducted to minimise the risks of malicious attacks on 
the system and gain more confidence from the system users.
