Abstract— Many traffic signals, intersections, and road signs 
on city roads result in waves of traffic flow. Fewer waves of 
traffic flow result in less congestion and reduced fuel 
consumption of vehicles. In order to ensure that trade and 
commerce in future are rapid, clean, and comfortable, it is 
essential to make city traffic smooth by EcoSmart driving. 
However, it is difficult to accomplish EcoSmart driving “for 
the benefit of all traffic,” even if drivers can use the me-first 
EcoSmart driving system. A control system that automatically 
performs EcoSmart driving for the benefit of all traffic was 
designed in this study. The proposed system overcomes the 
aforementioned obstacles by combining algorithms that 
consider traffic signals, preceding vehicles, and traffic flow, 
respectively. Herein, the details of the proposed control system 
are explained and simulation evaluations are reported.

INTRODUCTION 
Cities with increasing or dense populations are faced 
with the problem of increasing travel time between cities and 
air pollution caused by exhaust gases. Increasing populations 
in cities should be welcomed because it results in more 
economic activity. However, this also results in heavier 
traffic in the city. Traffic speed is closely related to 
economic activities. Therefore, a method to ensure smooth 
traffic flow should encourage stability in order to advance 
economic activities in cities sustainably. 
Conventionally, traffic flow can be made smoother by 
focusing on incidental equipment improvements. Currently, 
though, this solution does not fulfill the needs to expedite 
economic activities, because the population of cities is 
rapidly increasing. For instance, in an intersection with less 
traffic, traffic can be controlled using a stop line as a 
substitute for a traffic signal. On the other hand, intersections 
with heavier traffic often use traffic signals to control traffic. 
Control using traffic signals can impede traffic if the cycle 
time of the traffic signals is inappropriate. Traffic usually 
fluctuates depending on time zones and seasons. If only stop 
lines are used or if the run time of green signals is short 
when the traffic is heavier, more congestion would occur and 
the traffic speed would be lowered. Longer cycle times of 
red signals, in spite of less traffic, cause excessive idling and 
slow traffic speed. 
Slower traffic speed not only disturbs the economic 
activities, but also causes air pollution in cities. Moreover, 
increasing fuel consumption is a direct out-of-pocket cost. 
The cities with lesser traffic speed than other cities would 
eventually be deserted by the inhabitants, i.e., there would be 
an outflow of the population of the cities, causing them to 
lose their economic competitiveness. In other words, smooth 
traffic flow is vital for future cities. 
This study focuses on improvements in self-driving as a 
next 
generation 
method 
to 
enhance 
traffic 
flow. 
Improvements in self-driving can be accomplished by driver 
education. However, it is extremely difficult to guarantee 
smooth traffic flow through better individual driving 
techniques. Driving techniques, which create a smooth traffic 
flow, 
require 
the 
reduction 
of 
all 
unnecessary 
acceleration/deceleration. This requires that drivers have less 
influence from traffic signals and the preceding vehicles by 
maintaining long vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) distances. On the 
other hand, when a driver tries to create a greater V2V 
distance, it may become difficult for other drivers to 
maintain their V2V distances, because the vehicle consumes 
more traffic capacity. In other words, to reduce unnecessary 
acceleration/deceleration, a “me-first” driving paradigm is 
required, not one that involves driving “for the benefit of all 
traffic.” 
This study focuses on a driving system for the benefit of 
all traffic by vehicle control. The vehicle control proposed in 
this study solves two issues: reduction of unnecessary 
acceleration/deceleration and saving traffic capacity. The 
proposed driving control for city traffic is called EcoSmart 
driving control, because it saves energy by reducing 
unnecessary acceleration/deceleration. 
The EcoSmart driving control proposed in this study 
considers traffic conditions that reduce unnecessary 
acceleration/deceleration 
and 
traffic 
flow 
based 
on 
platooning control, which saves traffic capacity. Figure 1 is a 
representation of the concept of EcoSmart driving control. 
Many studies in which energy was saved by reducing 
unnecessary acceleration/deceleration were conducted [1-3]. 
A driving control system that saves energy by solving 
optimization problems using model predictive control was 
also produced [4]. In these studies, driving control was 
achieved by considering the preceding vehicles, traffic 
signals, and fuel consumption characteristics of the vehicle. 
The vehicle controls proposed in these studies use me-first 
EcoSmart driving. Hence, these systems are obviously

different from that in this study in that they are not EcoSmart 
driving systems for the benefit of all traffic. 
The EcoSmart driving control proposed in this study 
aims at EcoSmart driving for the benefit of all traffic by 
combining me-first EcoSmart driving and platooning control. 
The platooning control is used to clear congestion, reduce 
drivers’ load, and save energy mainly for expressways. 
Various methods for platooning control have been proposed 
[5-9]. Generally, the shorter the maintained V2V distance, 
the greater the efficiency, in terms of clearing congestion and 
saving energy. Thus, in recent years, control technologies to 
maintain a few meters of V2V distance even in driving at 
high velocity were developed, e.g., California Partners for 
Advanced Transportation Technology (PATH) in America, 
Safe Road Train for the Environment (SARTRE) in Europe, 
and Energy ITS in Japan. 
The proposed EcoSmart driving control saves traffic 
capacity by following the nearest preceding vehicle with a 
short V2V distance using platooning control, assuming the 
driver of the nearest preceding vehicle is driving with 
consideration of the traffic signals and preceding vehicles. 
The proposed EcoSmart driving control can switch the 
consideration for traffic conditions and platooning control. 
Thus, the driving control accomplishes both a margin for 
V2V distance that is not influenced by the preceding vehicle, 
which unnecessarily accelerates/decelerates, and saves traffic 
capacity. 
In this paper, details of the EcoSmart driving control are 
explained and simulation evaluations are reported.

ECOSMART DRIVING CONTROL FOR CITY TRAFFIC 
This section describes the details of the proposed 
EcoSmart driving control system. In addition, the design 
approach for the EcoSmart driving control and its 
formulation are explained. Herein, the EcoSmart driving 
control is formulated not as an actual driving control, but for 
simulation and evaluation of traffic flow. EcoSmart driving 
control for actual driving requires several kinds of feedback 
controls in addition to the equations in this paper. The 
feedback controls are not explained in this paper, because 
their design is not within the focus of this study.  
The EcoSmart driving control formulated in this study is 
based on an intelligent driver model (IDM). An IDM is 
simulates driving behaviors of an ordinary driver, 
considering the preceding vehicles and the traffic signals. An 
IDM is suitable for comparative evaluation with EcoSmart 
driving control. 
EcoSmart driving control based on an IDM incorporates 
free road behavior, vehicle consideration behavior, traffic 
signal consideration behavior, and platooning behavior. 
A. Free Road Behavior 
The free road behavior simulates driving in a situation 
with no traffic signals and no preceding vehicles. The 
equation to calculate target acceleration for free road 
behavior is shown below:

where 
&tv _ b
 is the target acceleration for free road 
behavior, v  is velocity of the vehicle,
vd
 represents the 
fixed target velocity of the driver, a  is a model parameter 
of acceleration with efficient fuel consumption, and δ  is a 
model parameter of acceleration exponent. 
In a general approach, fuel consumption characteristics 
of the vehicle are considered in order to accomplish 
EcoSmart driving control, where no signals and other 
vehicles are on the road. This study does not consider the 
fuel consumption characteristics of the vehicle for two 
reasons: one is that it would result in me-first EcoSmart 
driving, and the other is that the optimization problem of 
consideration of fuel consumption characteristics of the 
vehicle explosively increases calculation costs of the traffic 
flow simulator. 
If no traffic signals and other vehicles are on the road, a 
driving style that minimizes fuel consumption of the vehicle 
will also minimize fuel consumption of all the traffic. 
However, if there are vehicles following the controlled 
vehicle, and if the fuel consumption characteristics of these 
vehicles are largely different from those of the controlled 
vehicle, their fuel consumption would increase. Hence, on 
city roads where several vehicles are operating, the driving 
style that considers the fuel consumption characteristics of 
the vehicle is the me-first EcoSmart driving style. 
For the benefit of all the traffic, the average fuel 
consumption characteristics of the vehicles on the road 
should be primarily considered, rather than those of the 
vehicle itself. It is desirable that the average fuel 
consumption characteristics be calculated using V2V 
communication. 
However, 
on 
normal 
city 
streets, 
consideration of the preceding vehicles and traffic signals 
reduces fuel consumption far more than focusing on fuel 
consumption characteristics of the engine. Thus in this study, 
each model parameter of the free road behavior is set to the 
average value of the fuel consumption of the engines of 
ordinary vehicles, and online changes of the characteristics 
are not made.  
B. Vehicle Consideration Behavior 
The vehicle consideration behavior simulates driving in a 
situation with preceding vehicles. Equations to calculate the

where

s  is a model parameter, which determines the 
minimum desired gap. This behavior does not make the 
V2V distance shorter than 
0s . 
ls  is the V2V distance 
between the vehicle and the nearest preceding vehicle in the 
same lane. T  is a model parameter that determines the 
desired time headway. b  is a model parameter that 
determines the comfortable braking deceleration. 
v f _ min
 is 
the minimum velocity of the preceding vehicles in the same 
lane, which can be observed using the vehicle’s sensor. 
Figure 2 shows an example calculating 
v f _ min
 . Figure 
2-A shows an example of a vehicle, whose speed is 30 km/h, 
but its driver’s desired speed is 60 km/h. The vehicle 
observes vehicle A, which is driving at 50 km/h. It is not 
reasonable that the vehicle accelerates to more than 50 km/h. 
v f _ min
 is thus set to 50 km/h.  
Figure 2-B illustrates that the vehicle observed vehicle B 
in addition to the condition of Figure 2-A. Vehicle B is 
driving at 60 km/h. However, because vehicle A is driving 
at 50 km/h, it is not reasonable that the vehicle accelerates 
above 50 km/h. Then, 
v f _ min
 is set to 50 km/h. 
Figure 2-C shows that the vehicle observed vehicle C in 
addition to the condition of Figure 2-B. Since vehicle C is 
driving at 40 km/h, vehicle A and B are predicted to catch 
up to vehicle C, and decelerate to 40 km/h. In other words, it 
is not practical for the vehicle to accelerate to more than 40 
km/h. Then, 
v f _ min
 is set to 40 km/h. 
The design approach of the EcoSmart driving, which 
considers the preceding vehicles, is that the vehicle drives at 
the minimum velocity of all the preceding vehicles in the 
same lane. A vehicle control that considers the preceding 
vehicles is generally a following control such as an adaptive 
cruise control (ACC). However, if the V2V distance 
increases, the following control ignores the ecological 
driving, in order to maintain its target V2V distance. Also, 
the following control is not directly EcoSmart driving, 
because 
the 
control 
transfers 
unnecessary 
acceleration/deceleration of the preceding vehicle to the 
vehicle. Especially, in the following control of ACC, of 
which the string stability is not fulfilled, unnecessary 
acceleration/deceleration of the preceding vehicle is 
transferred to the vehicle with amplification, thus the 
following control should not be applied for EcoSmart driving. 
The proposed vehicle consideration behavior of 
EcoSmart driving control deals the V2V distance between 
the vehicle and the preceding vehicle as margin for 
ecological driving. This control never allows acceleration to 
higher velocity than that of the preceding vehicles in the 
same lane. Driving at a higher velocity than the preceding 
vehicle not only spoils the margin of V2V distance for 
ecological 
driving, 
but 
also 
yields 
unnecessary 
acceleration/deceleration. On the other hand, if a preceding 
vehicle driving at a lower speed than the vehicle emerges, 
the vehicle consumes its V2V distance for ecological driving, 
using most of its ecological means (e.g., reducing fuel 
consumption and using regenerative braking) according to 
the vehicle consideration behavior.

 determines a limit acceleration in order to 
stop safely in case the preceding traffic signal is yellow or

s
tv _  is the target velocity to drive in accordance with 
the timing of green light of the traffic signals, with no 
unnecessary acceleration/deceleration. Here, the traffic 
signals are observed using sensors on the vehicle or via 
communication. 
Figure 3 illustrates examples calculating 
s
tv _ . Figure 3-
A shows an example of the vehicle, which is driving at 30 
km/h but the driver’s desired speed is 60 km/h. The vehicle 
observes signal A. First, the vehicle estimates the arriving 
time at signal A. The vehicle has light timing data for signal 
A; it is not reasonable that the vehicle accelerates to higher 
speed allowing the vehicle to arrive at signal A before its 
timing of green light. Thus, the target arrival time at signal 
A is set to just after signal A turns to green. Then 
s
tv _  is 
calculated from characteristics of the free road behavior and 
the vehicle consideration behavior. 
Figure 3-B illustrates that the vehicle observed signal B 
in addition to the conditions of Figure 3-A. The vehicle 
estimates the arrival time at signal B. As the vehicle has the 
light timing data of signal B, it is not rational for the vehicle 
to accelerate to higher velocity making the vehicle arrives at 
signal A before its timing of green light. Thus, the targeted 
arrival time at signals A and B is set to just after signals A 
and B turn green, respectively. Then 
s
tv _  is calculated from 
characteristics of both the free road behavior and the vehicle 
consideration behavior. 
Figure 3-C shows that the vehicle observed signal C in 
addition to the conditions of Figure 3-B. The vehicle 
estimates the arrival time at signal C, from the target arrival 
time at signals A and B, calculated in Figure 3-B. As the 
vehicle has the light timing data of signal C, arriving at 
signals A and B at their target arrival times causes 
unnecessary acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle. Thus 
the target arrival times of signals A and B is set to any time 
in the green light period of each signal, and the target arrival 
time of signal C is set to just after it turns green. Then 
s
tv _  
is calculated from characteristics of the free road behavior 
and the vehicle consideration behavior. 
Figure 3-D shows that the vehicle observed signal D in 
addition to the conditions of Figure 3-C. The vehicle 
estimates the arrival time at signal D, from the target arrival 
time at signal C, calculated in Figure 3-C. As the vehicle has 
the light timing data of signal D, arriving at signal C at its 
target 
arrival 
time 
causes 
unnecessary 
acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle. Also, if the target 
arrival time at signal C is set to just before it turns red, a 
deceleration is also needed in order to pass the signal D just 
after signal D turns green. Thus, the target arrival times of 
signals A and B are set to any time during green light phase 
of each signal, and the target arrival time of signal C is set 
to just before it turns yellow. Then 
s
tv _  is calculated from 
characteristics of the free road behavior and the vehicle 
consideration behavior. 
If the aforementioned process is calculated with updated 
information of the preceding vehicles and the traffic signals, 
the 
vehicle 
can 
drive 
reducing 
unnecessary 
acceleration/deceleration. As it would cause accidents to 
pass traffic signals during color transition, the target arriving 
time should consider of safety margin.

These equations enable a narrow V2V distance 
necessary to execute the platoon behavior. 
The platooning behavior simulates the platooning 
control, which maintains V2V distances at a constant value, 
by setting the acceleration of the vehicle to match that of the 
nearest preceding vehicle. 
When a vehicle group is formed, with each vehicle under 
EcoSmart control, only the lead vehicle considers traffic 
conditions, and the following vehicles exhibit platooning 
behavior. In this way, the traffic capacity consumed by the 
lead vehicle can be compensated for. In addition, if the 
percentage of vehicles under EcoSmart driving control 
increases in a lane, the average traffic capacity consumption 
per vehicle decreases compared to the situation with no 
vehicles under EcoSmart control driving in the lane. Hence, 
EcoSmart driving control would clear traffic congestion. 
With the traffic congestion cleared, the efficiency of the 
traffic condition considerations, performed by the lead 
vehicle of the group under EcoSmart control, is enhanced. 
Thus, more ecological driving is achieved. In other words, 
EcoSmart Driving control proposed in this paper has a 
possibility to generate an ecological progression. 
E. Integration of the Behaviors 
A target acceleration is selected from the target 
accelerations calculated for the aforementioned behaviors.

SIMULATION EVALUATION 
In this study, the aforementioned EcoSmart driving 
control was evaluated using a traffic flow simulator. This 
paper reports the following four simulation condition 
evaluations and results: a) evaluation of the efficiency of the 
vehicle consideration, b) evaluation of the efficiency of the 
traffic signal consideration, c) evaluation of platooning 
behavior, and d) evaluation of the efficiency of the whole 
EcoSmart driving control. 
Simulation conditions, except for evaluation on the 
efficiency of the whole EcoSmart driving control, are 
evaluated in the simulator, which simulates a straight road 
with an infinite length. Only the evaluation on the efficiency 
of the whole EcoSmart driving control is simulated in the 
ring road, which is 2 km per lap. These roads have one-way 
traffic, single-lane, and flat. There is no inflow/outflow of 
vehicles anywhere on the roads. The traffic signal position is 
stable. 
The vehicle model in the traffic flow simulator has each 
vehicle under EcoSmart driving control or vehicle with an 
IDM. The model parameters of the EcoSmart driving control 
and IDM are set to the common values for the vehicles. All 
the vehicles have the same fuel consumption characteristics 
map, which simulates a D-segment car equipped with a 150 
kW reciprocating engine. The fuel consumption per interval 
is calculated based on the map. 
A. Evaluation of Efficiency of the Vehicles Consideration 
In this evaluation, three vehicles drive in order of A, B, 
and C on the road. Vehicle A drives at 40 km/h of initial 
velocity, and at 40 km/h of target velocity, with an IDM. 
Vehicle B drives at 50 km/h of initial velocity, and at 50 
km/h of target velocity, with an IDM. Vehicle C drives at 50 
km/h of initial velocity, and at 60 km/h of target velocity. 
Vehicle C is driven with an IDM and, for comparative 
evaluation, under EcoSmart driving control. The initial 
position of the vehicles have vehicle B at 200 m preceding 
vehicle C, and vehicle A is 400 m ahead of vehicle C. There 
are no traffic signals are on the road. 
Figure 4 shows the fuel consumption and velocity of 
vehicle C plotted against mileage. The result shows that the 
proposed EcoSmart control targets the velocity of vehicle A 
and starts to decelerate by running on inertia early on. In this 
way, vehicle C reduces unnecessary acceleration and results 
in improved overall fuel efficiency. 
The results reveal that the vehicle consideration in 
EcoSmart driving control yields a reduction in unnecessary 
acceleration/deceleration and that leads to a reduction in fuel 
consumption.

B. Evaluation of Efficiency of the Traffic Signal 
Consideration 
This evaluation consists of a vehicle and a traffic signal. 
The initial velocity of the vehicle is 30 km/h, and the target 
velocity is 60 km/h. For comparative evaluation, the vehicle 
drives with an IDM and under EcoSmart driving control. The 
signal is initially red, and it turns green after 35 s. The signal 
is 300 m ahead of the vehicle at the start time. EcoSmart 
driving control is shared the light timing of the traffic signal. 
Figure 5 shows the resultant fuel consumption and 
velocity of vehicle C plotted against mileage. The results 
show that EcoSmart driving control considers the turning 
timing of the signal, and gently accelerates in order to not 
decelerate at a red light. In this way, the vehicle reduces 
unnecessary acceleration and results in improved overall fuel 
efficiency.

that 
the

of unnecessary acceleration/deceleration, which leads to a 
reduction in fuel consumption.

C. Evaluation of Platooning Behavior 
This evaluation consists of three vehicles driving in order 
of A, B, and C and a traffic signal. The initial velocity of 
vehicle A is 30 km/h, and the target velocity is 60 km/h, 
driving with an IDM. The initial velocities of vehicles B and 
C are 30 km/h, and the target velocities are 60 km/h, driving 
under EcoSmart driving control. The initial state of the signal 
is a red light, and it turns to green after 35 s. The initial 
position of the vehicles is as follows: vehicle B is 200 m 
ahead of vehicle C and vehicle A is 400 m ahead of vehicle 
C. The signal is 700 m ahead of vehicle C at the start time. 
EcoSmart driving control is shared the light timing of the 
traffic signal. 
Figure 6 shows a graph of the velocities and control 
states of vehicles B and C plotted against mileage. The result 
shows that vehicle A decelerates and stops because of the red 
light, and then vehicle B decelerates. Also, vehicle C 
approaches vehicle B in accordance with the timing of 
vehicle B’s deceleration, and then the platooning control is 
enabled. In addition, when vehicle B accelerates, vehicle C 
follows at the same velocity.  
The result shows that platooning behavior in EcoSmart 
driving control precisely reproduces the platooning control.

D. Evaluation of Efficiency of the Whole EcoSmart 
Driving Control  
This evaluation simulates a ring road, which is 2 km per 
lap. There are 50 vehicles every 100 m, and 10 traffic signals 
every 500 m on the road. The initial velocities of all the 
vehicles are 0 km/h, with target velocities of 60 km/h. 30% 
of the vehicles are under EcoSmart driving control, and the 
remaining 70% are driving with an IDM. The decision of 
which control is applied to each vehicle is determined 
randomly in each experimental run. The light timing of the 
traffic signals is set in normal random numbers in each 
experiment, based on statistical information of light timing 
of traffic signals on average city roads in Japan. An 
EcoSmart driving control system can obtain the velocity of 
preceding vehicles up to 400 m ahead and the light timing of 
the preceding three traffic signals. An experimental run is 
completed with all the vehicles covering 10 km, and the 
experiment is repeated 100 times. The average fuel 
consumptions and the average velocities are recorded in 
every test. For comparative evaluation, EcoSmart driving

control can switch, i.e., enable/disable, the platooning 
behavior. 
Figure 7 shows the fluctuation percentage of average 
velocity and fuel consumption for all traffic. The fluctuation 
percentage is calculated in as follows; the value of all the 
traffic, with no vehicles under EcoSmart driving control, is 
divided into that of the value where vehicles under EcoSmart 
driving control are driving on the road. The result shows that 
both EcoSmart driving control without platooning behavior 
and EcoSmart driving control with platooning behavior 
reduce fuel consumption for all the traffic. However, the 
platooning behavior also reduces the average traffic velocity 
of all the traffic. That is mainly because EcoSmart driving 
control 
without 
platooning 
behavior 
reduced 
fuel 
consumption by decreasing the traffic velocity. In other 
words, if the percentage of EcoSmart driving control without 
platooning behavior increases, traffic congestion would be 
generated, and that influences all traffic. 
The results show that the EcoSmart driving control 
proposed in this study reduces fuel consumption of all the 
traffic, saving traffic capacity, and that the control performs 
with higher efficiency than other vehicle controls in related 
studies.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study, we developed EcoSmart driving control in 
order to enhance the efficiency of city traffic. 
First, the importance of efficiency of city traffic in future 
cities is explained. Driving needs to be improved in order for 
the efficiency of city traffic in future cities to be enhanced. 
This requires a driving control system. The related studies 
would negatively influence traffic flow. 
Then, the details of EcoSmart driving control proposed in 
this study are described. EcoSmart driving control consists of 
the free road behavior, vehicle consideration behavior, the 
traffic signal consideration behavior, and platooning 
behavior. Each behavior is formulated, and the objective is 
explained. 
Next, a simulation evaluation of EcoSmart driving 
control is reported. Evaluations are conducted based on the 
following conditions: a) efficiency of vehicle consideration, 
b) efficiency of traffic signal consideration, c) platooning 
behavior, and d) efficiency of the whole EcoSmart driving 
control system. All the evaluation results show that 
EcoSmart driving control can reduce fuel consumption in 
traffic while saving traffic capacity. 
Our future work is on system development for 
application to actual vehicles, and on driving evaluation.
