I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Power quality is a complex and controversial issue, the 
complexity resulting from the multitude of factors that 
condition it, and the controversy from how different 
researchers understand and present it differently. In 1985, the 
European Commission Directive 85/374 EC [1] established 
that electricity is a 'product', that requires clear definition of 
features. The voltage and frequency maintenance within the 
admissible limits and a pure sinusoidal voltage curve, 
without 'noise’, are the key elements for an ideal electricity 
supply. 
The paper presents a few power quality monitoring 
aspects on the interface between the power transmission 
network and the power distribution network, at 110 kV 
voltage level, considering both the current situation and the 
perspective. Permanently or temporarily power quality 
monitoring is performed in the common connection point, 
where the system operator / provider has an obligation to 
provide electricity within the quality parameters of the 
contract. The supplier / consumer is required to limit the 
system perturbations transmitted in the Romanian Power 
System below the quota. Knowing the situation within the 
power transmission network buses and the disturbance 
sources, it is required a complex measurement program, 
using acquisition and processing equipment dedicated to the 
private Power Transmission Network - Power Distribution 
Network interface.  
The problems specific to the common connection point 
result in the under-load of the power transmission network 
and the power distribution network. Also, difficulties in 
maintaining the voltage within the admissible range in the 
power transmission network are recorded. The incidents that 
occur within the power transmission network cause large 
variations in voltage, gaps, short and long term power supply 
failures, leading to disturbances for the power supplied to 
consumers [2]. Power quality within the power distribution 
network is affected both by the voltage going out of the 
admissible range, and by the distortion of the voltage and 
power curves. In the power distribution network, power 
quality monitoring involves tracking it in the network buses 
and in the user common connection point, as well as 
establishing, for each connected user, the disturbance 
generated level. 
The paper presents the structure of a power quality 
monitoring 
system, 
some 
experimental 
results 
and 
advantages obtained by using power quality monitoring 
system.

POWER QUALITY WITHIN THE ROMANIAN 
POWER GRID COMPANY TRANSELECTRICA 
Within 
the 
Romanian 
Power 
Grid 
Company 
Transelectrica the power transmission activity is based on 
the transmission network. It includes substations and 
overhead lines. The transmission network represents a 
national and strategic interest, having the rated phase-to-
phase voltage greater than 110 kV. The power facilities 
managed and operated by Transelectrica (the Romanian 
Transmission System Operator) are the following ones: 
79 substations:  
• 
1 x 750 kV substation; 
• 
36 x 400 kV substations; 
• 
42 x 220 kV substations; 
8931.6 km OHLs:  
• 
154.6 km - 750 kV; 
• 
4703.7 km - 400 kV; 
• 
4035.2 km - 220 kV; 
• 
38 km - 110 kV (tine-lines with the power systems 
of the neighbouring countries); 
and 218 transforming units totalizing 37565 MVA. 
To assure the fulfilment of the power quality 
requirements, the Company is undergoing a rigorous 
maintenance program to maintain the transmission network 
power facilities technical status. Its main goal is the 
following one: to improve the transmission network safety 
operation to avoid situations that could lead to dangerous 
unwanted events both for the transmission network and for 
the population or environment. 
The implementation of a substation remote control and 
monitoring system represents a priority for the Romanian

Power Grid Transelectrica. The improvement of the power 
transmission service efficiency and quality, the reduction of 
the dangerous events and of the operation and maintenance 
costs are direct consequences of such system.  
To achieve this goal, remote control and monitoring 
centre have been established at each transmission branch. 
Currently the following ones are operating: The Remote 
Control and Monitoring Center of Timisoara and The 
Remote Control and Monitoring Center of Sibiu (Figure 1). 
Applying the monitoring system at Timisoara and Sibiu 
Subsidiaries, based on the obtained results, its expansion to 
the entire country level can be achieved. The results 
provided by the monitoring system are able to sustain 
several decisions regarding the upgrading all the electrical 
installations at Timisoara and Sibiu Subsidiaries. Also, an 
entire imagine is provided concerning the electrical 
installations’ upgrading for all the subsidiaries within 
Transelectrica.  
Timisoara Transmission Subsidiary is operating across 
four counties: Timis, Arad, Caras-Severin and Hunedoara. 
Timisoara Transmission Subsidiary contains: 
• 400 kV substations: Arad, Mintia, Nadab; 
• 220 kV substations: Arad, Baru Mare, Calea Aradului, 
Hasdat, Iaz, Mintia, Otelarie, Paroseni, Pestis, Resita, 
Sacalaz, Timisoara.

The entire database stored on the database server can be 
accessed, on demand, in order to generate one’s own 
programs to process the primary data and to print the data, 
the graphs or the reports. Implementing the system requires 
carrying out works on two levels: in each measuring cell of 
the substations and in the central point.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Several 
experimental 
determinations 
have 
been 
performed within the following locations: 
• Timisoara Transmission Subsidiary (400 kV substations: 
Arad, Mintia, Nadab; 220 kV substations: Arad, Baru 
Mare, Calea Aradului, Hasdat, Iaz, Mintia, Otelarie, 
Paroseni, Pestis, Resita, Sacalaz, Timisoara); 
• Sibiu Transmission Subsidiary (400 kV substations: 
Brasov, Darste and Iernut; 220 kV substations: Alba 
Iulia, Fantanele, Gheorgheni, Ungheni, Iernut).

Part of the experimental determinations has been 
previously presented in other references such as [6]-[9]. 
In the following, only the experimental results 
corresponding to the 220 / 110 / 20 kV Fantanele Substation 
are presented (Figure 3). 
Over 50 % of the 220 kV and 400 kV total overhead lines 
(OHL) length (987 km), within Sibiu Subsidiary, are located 
on mountain areas, with difficult access. These OHLs are 
operating in special environment conditions, high requests 
from the maintenance and operation point of view. The 
power produced within the major power plants is transmitted 
through these OHLs: Lotru, Mintia and Iernut. Within 
Fantanele substation, additionally, even it has been partially 
upgraded, power quality indices unsatisfied values have been 
recorded. The negative aspects refer to the supplied voltage 
magnitude: UR, US, UT. 
Within Fantanele Substation the measurements have been 
performed between 28.10-30.12.2006. The very short 
measurement period is due to several difficulties in 
establishing the communication between the measurement 
point and the central one. The greatest real energy quantity 
received from 110 kV network is noted (according to Table 
II) 
being 
an 
important 
characteristic 
for 
110 
kV 
autotransformer.

The change of the real energy sense is followed by a 
significant reactive energy quantity. In specific cases the 
latter could overpass the real one (Figure 5). The 110 kV 
autotransformer power factor is 88.66 %, being the smallest 
in comparison to other analyzed network elements. The 
power quality indicator synthesis is presented in Figure 4. 
According to this figure the phase L1, L2, L3 supplied 
voltage magnitude and the long period flicker level Plt have 
not fitted between the admissible limits. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The supplied voltage magnitude power quality indicator 
is the most frequent overpass of the imposed limits for all the 
measuring points, due to its increased value over 110 % UC. 
The revision of the Electrical Transmission Network 
Technical Code has been proposed considering the technical 
equipment characteristics installed within 110 kV electrical 
installations and the experience achieved. The upper limit 
voltage magnitude variation from 121 kV to 123 kV has 
been proposed. 
The feasibility study conducted for this system stresses 
that its implementation will ensure rapid access to information 
needed for all the responsible factors. It will therefore 
increase efficiency with regards to the establishment of 
concrete measures to reduce electromagnetic disturbances 
and to diminish their effects in order to: 
• Reduce the additional losses in the power transmission 
network and for the consumers supplied directly from 
the power transmission network. It is achieved mainly 
by reducing the harmonics’ level, voltage and power 
non-symmetries for this type of networks; 
• Ensure the proper equipment operation with functions and 
performance affected by the harmonics and voltage and / 
or current non-symmetries presence; 
• Reduce operation expenses for the preventive or 
corrective equipment maintenance that is affected by 
disturbances that damage power quality; 
• Increase the life span of the power transmission network 
equipment and consumers supplied directly from the 
power transmission network, mainly by reducing the 
level of temporary over-voltages and the harmonic 
power and voltage on the network; 
• Increase the generators, processing units, lines and 
electric motors efficiency; 
• Reduce the costs of power generation / transmission and, 
in general, reduce investment in the Romanian Power 
System that would be necessary in order to cover the 
electromagnetic 
disturbances’ 
effects 
caused 
by 
exceeding the admissible limits; 
• Reduce the reactive power flow and reduce the reactive 
power exchanges between the power transmission 
network and the power distribution network; 
• Reduce damage to consumers caused by voltage 
deviations from the rated value, by voltage gaps and by 
short term power supply failures. 
The power quality monitoring system presented provides 
better results than the ones stipulated within the literature 
[10]-[13]. 
Implementing the monitoring system within all the 
Transelectrica’s 
substations, 
several 
advantages 
are 
achieved. The efficiency is increasing; the decisions are able 
to be taken more accurately at all the involved levels.  
Only limiting the advantages’ evaluation at transmission 
network additional losses reduction, that affects the power 
quality, the following economic efficiency indices can be 
evaluated. 
• Considering a 10 years period, the net updated revenue 
is NUR = 628,489 Euro. It presents the analyzed 
investment efficiency, for a considered study period and 
an update chosen rate. The limit condition the accept the 
investment is:  NUR  > 0. 
• Profitability index Pi = 2,612. It represents the ratio 
between the sum of the yearly updated benefits and the 
sum of the yearly updated expenses, along the 
considered study period. To accept the investment this 
ratio has to be greater than 1.  
• Internal return rate IRR= 45,14 %. It verifies if the 
investment is sensitive at greater updating rates, than the 
one chosen within the computing process.  
• Updated recovery UR = approximately 2.5 years from 
the first operation of the investment. It highlights the 
capacity of the objective to refund the invested capital 
for its achievement. It is refunded based on the operation 
benefices, respectively from the number of years 
necessary to equal the investment value.
