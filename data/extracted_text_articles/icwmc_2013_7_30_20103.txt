Abstract—In order to achieve the required data rates of 
1Gbit/s and more in 3GPP LTE-Advanced wireless systems, 
there is an increased need for high spectral efficiency. 
Multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) is a 
promising way to improve frequency usage efficiency. In 
this paper, a new multi-user MIMO OFDM scheme, named 
Joint Coding Modulation Diversity (JCMD) is proposed for 
the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) long term 
evolution advanced (LTE-Advanced). This new scheme can 
take advantage of the modulation diversity of rotated 
constellation, 
the 
frequency 
diversity 
of 
orthogonal 
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system and Turbo 
codes all together. The simulation results show that this 
proposed scheme can significantly outperform the current 
Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) scheme in the 
3GPP LTE-Advanced standard.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, demands on high rate wireless 
communication 
have 
increased. 
Orthogonal 
Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been 
proven to be a viable technique, which is proposed for 
next generation wireless communication system. OFDM is 
used to transmit data over extremely hostile channel at a 
comparable low complexity with high data rates [1, 2]. 
Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be 
viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband 
signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal. 
Compared with the conventional FDM scheme, it can save 
about 
half 
the 
bandwidth. 
On 
the other 
hand, 
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems have 
also been one of the key techniques to achieve high rate 
and high reliability over wireless channels because it can 
allow modulated symbols to transmit on multiple antennas 
at the same time to obtain high spectral efficiency. Using 
sophisticated coding at the transmitter and substantial 
signal processing at the receiver, the MIMO channel can 
be provisioned for higher data rates and resistance to 
multipath 
fading. 
A 
Layered 
Space-Time 
(LST) 
architecture that allows processing of multidimensional 
signals in the space domain by one dimension processing 
steps was proposed by Foschini [3]. Bit-Interleaved Coded 
Modulation (BICM) [4,5,6] is used in most of the existing 
communication standards (cf. HSPA, IEEE 802.11a/g, 
IEEE 802.16, DVB-S2, etc.) [7,8,9,10]. In BICM, the 
channel encoder and the modulator are separated by a 
bit-level interleaver, which makes the design simple and 
flexible. Based on BICM-LST, which is the conventional 
spectral-efficient spatial multiplexing technology to deal 
with MIMO fading channel, MIMO-OFDM system can be 
used to overcome the various challenges that come with 
the high bit-rate, reliable and power efficient transmission 
demand in wide-band communication, and has become the 
foundation of advanced wireless transmission technologies 
in the current 3GPP LTE-Advanced standard. 
J. Boutros et al. [11] studied the uncoded rotated 
multidimensional modulation schemes over Rayleigh 
fading channels. To distinguish from the other well-known 
diversity (time, frequency, code, space), the rotated 
modulation schemes have an essential modulation 
diversity and the modulation diversity order is the 
minimum number of distinct components between any two 
multidimensional 
components 
between 
any 
two 
multidimensional constellation points. The schemes are 
essentially uncoded and can achieve very high modulation 
diversity, and can approach Addition White Gaussian 
Noise (AWGN) error performance over independent flat 
fading channels without time-dispersion. However, it 
cannot be directly used for frequency selective fading 
channels with severe inter-symbol interference (ISI). To 
make full use of modulation diversity and frequency 
diversity over the time-dispersion fading channels with ISI, 
it should cooperate with OFDM. A rotated coding 
modulation OFDM system was proposed in [12], which 
extends the modulation diversity in coded OFDM systems. 
Through the combination of rotating the multiple phase 
shift keying or multiple quadrature amplitude modulation 
(MPSK/MQAM) constellation and interleaving the 
symbol components in space-time-frequency domain, the 
performance of wireless communications systems can be 
significantly improved. 
A 
MIMO-OFDM 
system 
based 
on 
the 
two-dimensional modulation diversity [12] is proposed for 
the 3GPP LTE-advanced MU-MIMO schemes. Through 
jointly optimizing Turbo coded MIMO-OFDM and the 
rotated coding modulation for each user, the proposed 
scheme can take full advantage of the coding-gain of 
Turbo codes, the time and frequency diversity of OFDM 
system and the spatial diversity of MIMO all together. It is 
named the joint coding and modulation diversity (JCMD) 
MU-MIMO OFDM scheme. The rest of this paper is 
organized as follows.  
General multi-user MIMO system model is introduced 
in Section II. In Section III, the JCMD MU-MIMO

OFDM scheme is proposed. Rotational modulation, the 
component interleaver and the detection algorithm are 
introduced in Sections IV, V, and VI, respectively. Section 
VII describes the procedure of selection of the codebook 
and the user, which makes the system throughput 
maximized and Section VIII gives the simulation results.

JOINT CODING AND MODULATION DIVERSITY 
MU-MIMO OFDM SCHEME 
In [13], the principle of MU-MIMO with per user 
unitary and rate control (PU2RC) is described. The 
feedback does not indicate the channel itself, but a 
preferred precoder from a set of predefined precoders. 
Based on the conventional MU-MIMO scheme with 
PU2RC, an improved MU-MIMO OFDM scheme based 
on modulation diversity is proposed, which is illustrated 
in Figure 2. The blocks drawn in dotted line are the 
additional proposed processing based on the conventional 
MU-MIMO OFDM system in the 3GPP LTE standard.  
At the transmitter, the base station firstly selects a 
group of users in the set of users to be scheduled 
according to the procedure of PU2RC-MIMO with partial 
feedback, which will be described in Section VI. Then, 
the information bits of selected group users are firstly 
encoded by 3GPP LTE Turbo code [14]. The conventional 
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is carried out to 
produce complex-valued symbols by constellation mapper. 
The conventional modulated symbols are converted into 
new complex-valued rotated symbols by a rotational 
modulation mapper. The rotated symbols contain In-phase 
(I) components and Quadrature (Q) components and 
subsequently are mapped onto NL transmission layers. 
Afterwards, 
the 
spatial 
interleaving 
and 
spatial 
Q-interleaving that will be described in Section V are 
carried out over each user’s NL transmission layers. The 
interleaved symbols are then mapped onto different 
time-frequency resource elements (REs). For 
the 
Q-components, 
an 
additional 
time-frequency 
Q-interleaver is performed. After the codebook-based 
precoding 
[15], 
NFFT-point 
Inverse 
Fast 
Fourier 
Transform (IFFT) and inserting cyclic prefix (CP) are 
implemented on each transmit antenna. 
At the receiver of each UT, removing CP and NFFT 
point FFT are carried out first. The minimum mean 
squared-error (MMSE) equalization in the frequency 
domain is performed. Afterwards, the received symbols of 
each spatial stream are obtained after the time-frequency 
Q-component deinterleaving, time-frequency resource 
element demapping, spatial Q-deinterleaving, spatial 
deinterleaving, and layer demapping. For each symbol, 
the maximum likelihood (ML) rotational demodulation is 
used to produce the log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs) of 
encoded bits. Finally, the Turbo decoder utilized the

LLRs to decode the information bits. 
IV. 
ROTATIONAL MODULATION 
Compared with the usual QAM, rotated constellation 
can obtain the modulation diversity by rotating some 
angle 
[11]. 
Combining 
rotating 
the 
conventional 
constellation and interleaving the components, the 
performance of wireless communications systems can be 
improved greatly in fading channels.  
At the transmitter, coded bits

This processing can also be illustrated in Figure 3. In 
the conventional square QPSK constellation, the 
I-component and Q-component of one complex-valued 
modulated symbol just carry one bit, respectively. After 
the operation of constellation rotation, both I-component 
and Q-component of each point in the new constellation 
carry the information of two bits, which means that the 
information of two bits exists across the I-component and 
Q-component. After appropriate interleaving of the 
Q-components, 
the 
fading 
coefficients 
of 
the 
I-components and Q-components are uncorrelated. The 
modulation diversity order L of a multidimensional signal 
set is the minimum number of distinct components 
between any two constellation points. Assuming 
independent Rayleigh fading channel and the maximum 
likelihood (ML) detection, multidimensional QAM 
constellation becomes insensitive to fading channel when 
the diversity L is large [16]. 
By adjusting the rotation angle, the optimum 
modulation diversity can be obtained to minimize bit 
error rate (BER). J. Boutros et al. [11] studied the 
optimum criteria of the uncoded rotation modulation over 
independent Rayleigh channel, and proposed that the 
diversity order L and product distance should be 
maximized [11]. Simulation results show that the best 
angle of rotation depends on modulation order and coding 
rate. Also, there is weak correlation between the code rate 
and the optimum rotation angle, especially from a high 
coding rate of 3/4 and 8/9. However, it is strongly 
relevant to the modulation order. For the same code rate, 
the optimal rotation angle values are different for QPSK, 
16QAM and 64QAM, and it decreases as the modulation 
order increases. Based on the above theoretical analysis 
and computer simulation, we obtain the optimal rotation 
angles that are suitable for the improved MU-MIMO 
OFDM systems based on modulation diversity, which are 
shown in Table I.

B. Time-frequency Q-component interleaver 
The time-frequency Q-component interleaving is 
aimed to make the I-component and the Q-component in 
one modulated symbol as uncorrelated as possible in the 
time and frequency domain. We assume the OFDM 
system has L subcarriers in frequency domain for each 
user and Nsym OFDM symbols in time domain. One 
Q-component of a complex-valued modulated symbol is 
mapped onto one resource element Q (f, t) at the fth 
subcarrier in the tth OFDM symbol. After time- frequency 
Q-component interleaving, the output is Q (f’, t’). The 
Q-component interleaving is defined as follows.

. Thus, the time 
interval between I-component and Q-component is 
Nsym / 2
 OFDM symbol duration. In frequency domain, 
the frequency interval is half the bandwidth for each user. 
So, the time-frequency Q-component interleaver can 
make full use of the frequency diversity and the time 
diversity of OFDM system, and it can make the 
I-components and Q-components as uncorrelated as 
possible. Based on the use of spatial interleaver, the 
achievable rate of the proposed scheme can be increased, 
which is demonstrated as follows.

For

system 
without

VII. PRECODING MATRIX AND USER SELECTION 
ALGORITH 
According to the equation (18), for the 
kth
 user, the 
value of 
m
k
SINR is not only dependent on its channel 
matrix
k
H , but also determined by its corresponding 
precoding vector 
k
w and the other user’s precoding 
vector
i
w . A precoding matrix 
p
w  will correspond to 
L
K
N
 SINRs. According to the known precoding 
codebook
1
2
{
,
,...,
L}
W 
w w
w
, then the total number of 
SINRs for each user is
L
K
N
L


. Each user will 
feedback these SINRs to the base station to perform 
scheduling. 
The scheduling method of maximizing system 
capacity will be used in this paper. The transmitting side 
will select K users from the X users to be scheduled, and 
select the corresponding precoding matrix to maximize 
system throughput. For the multi-user MIMO system, 
system capacity can be expressed as

The method of choosing optimal precoding matrix 
that maximizes system capacity can be defined as

as follows 
            
[ ]
k
k
w 

The detailed steps are as follows. 
1) 
Each user computes 
L
K

L

 SINRs according 
to their channel matrix and the precoding codebook, and 
then sends these SINRs to the base station. 
2) 
The 
base 
station 
collects 
all 
the 
feedback 
information. Select K users from the X users to be 
scheduled and corresponding precoding matrix according 
to the principle of maximizing system capacity. Each user 
in the selected users group corresponds to the precoding 
vectors 
k
w in the precoding matrix w . 
3) 
Apply precoding scheme corresponding to the 
selected group. 
VIII. SIMULATION RESULTS 
Assuming that each user has two data streams
2
L
N 
, 
computer simulations are carried out to compare the 
proposed scheme with the conventional MU-MIMO 
OFDM scheme in the current 3GPP LTE-Advanced 
standard. The frame structure, physical resource elements 
of OFDM system and Turbo code are given in Table II. 
Figure 4 depicts the JCMD-vs-BICM frame error rate 
(FER) performance comparison for 3/4 and 5/6. In the 
figure, the proposed scheme JCMD MU-MIMO OFDM 
scheme can obtain obvious SNR gain over the 
conventional BICM MU-MIMO OFDM scheme in 
current 3GPP LTE standard.  
For QPSK modulation, SNR gains are about 3.52dB 
and 4.55dB at FER=0.01 for 3/4 and 5/6 code rate, 
respectively. For 16QAM modulation, SNR gains are 
about 3.33dB and 3.83dB at FER=0.01 for 3/4 and 5/6 
code rate, respectively. Thus, for high code rate, the SNR 
gain becomes more significant.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, an improved joint coding and 
modulation diversity (JCMD) MU-MIMO scheme is 
proposed. Compared with the current solution BICM, the 
JCMD scheme only introduces limited complexity, which 
was 
brought 
by 
the 
several 
interleavers. 
A 
low-complexity time-frequency component interleaver is 
proposed to maximize the frequency diversity and the 
time diversity of OFDM system. The proposed scheme 
makes full use of Turbo codes coding gain, time and 
frequency diversity of OFDM system, and the spatial 
diversity of MIMO.
