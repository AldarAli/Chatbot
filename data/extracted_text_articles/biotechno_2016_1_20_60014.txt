Abstract – We study the dynamics of transcription initiation 
of the T7 Phi 10 promoter as a function of temperature, 
using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and in 
vivo single-cell, single-ribonucleic acid (RNA) time-lapse 
microscopy. First, from the mean and squared coefficient of 
variation of the empirical distribution of intervals between 
consecutive RNA appearances in individual cells, we find 
that both the mean rate and noise in RNA production in-
crease with temperature (from 20oC to 43oC). Next, the pro-
cess is shown to be sub-Poissonian in all conditions, suggest-
ing the existence of more than one rate-limiting step and 
absence of a significant ON-OFF mechanism. Next, from the 
kinetics of RNA production for varying amounts of T7 RNA 
polymerases, we find that as temperature increases, the frac-
tion of time that the T7 RNA polymerase spends in open 
complex formation increases relative to the time to commit 
to closed complex formation, due to changes in the kinetics of 
open complex, closed complex, and reversibility of the closed 
complex formation. We conclude that the initiation kinetics 
of the T7 Phi 10 promoter changes with temperature due to 
changes in the kinetics of its rate-limiting steps.

INTRODUCTION 
The bacteriophage T7 is an obligate lytic phage that 
infects Escherichia coli, using the host system to produce 
up to 100 progeny phages in less than 25 min, in optimal 
conditions [1]. One of the major gene products of T7 bac-
teriophage is the T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) [2]. 
This is a single subunit enzyme, with a high specificity 
towards T7 promoters via the recognition of a highly con-
served 23bp consensus sequence [3]. Early studies have 
shown that the T7 RNAP transcription rate is sequence 
dependent and depends on environmental conditions 
[4][5][6]. Given that the infection process of T7 bacterio-
phage is not only fast but it also requires a balance be-
tween the number of phages and the amount of capsid 
proteins produced [7], the phage needs to coordinate the 
dynamics of transcription of the viral genes, as this is 
likely critical for its success. 
It is known that the dynamics of gene expression, as 
well as of many other cellular processes, depends on envi-
ronmental factors, particularly temperature [8]. Conse-
quently, microorganisms have evolved mechanisms that 
allow them to cope with both sudden as well as slow tem-
perature changes [9][10]. E. coli, for example, can survive 
in a wide range of temperatures. Similarly, it has also 
been shown that the T7 bacteriophage is capable of coping 
with these fluctuations and wide ranges [5].   
Even though robustness to sudden temperature 
changes and wide temperature ranges is crucial for the 
survival of microorganisms, so far, little is known about 
what are the consequences of these environmental chang-
es on the in vivo transcription kinetics of the T7 promoter. 
In addition, most studies characterizing the transcription 
initiation kinetics of T7 promoters have mostly used in 
vitro measurement techniques [5][11].  
To address this issue, here we use recently developed 
measurement strategies that use single-cell, single-RNA in 
vivo detection techniques [12] and use them to study in 
detail the kinetics of transcription initiation of the T7 
Phi10 (Φ10) promoter as a function of temperature.  
The remaining of this article is organized as follows: 
Section II describes the methods used and measurements 
conducted. Section III presents the results from these ex-
periments. In Section IV, we conclude by presenting our 
interpretation of the results and our assessment of their 
relevance, as well as additional considerations for future 
work.

METHODS 
In this section, we describe the measurements con-
ducted in this study. Each subsection presents a detailed 
explanation of the experiments performed.  
A. Strain and plasmids 
The strain E. coli BL21(DE3) (New England Biolabs, 
USA) was used to express the target and reporter genes. 
This strain has a copy of the T7 bacteriophage gene 1 
coding for T7 RNAP controlled by the PlacUV5 promoter 
and integrated in the chromosome [13] (Figure 1A). 
The single copy F-plasmid pBELOBAC11, carrying 
the Φ10-mCherry-48bs sequence (constructed for this 
work) was inserted in the host strain. It produces the target 
RNA, with an array of 48 MS2 binding sites (48bs) under 
the control of a T7 Φ10 promoter, cloned from the plas-
mid pRSET/EmGFP (ThermoScientific, USA). 
A second plasmid, pZA25-GFP (Green Fluorescent 
Protein) [14] (a gift from Orna Amster-Choder, Hebrew 
University of Jerusalem, Israel), was also inserted in the 
host strain. It contains the reporter gene ms2-gfp, placed 
under the control of PBAD promoter. This reporter gene 
encodes for the fusion protein MS2-GFP, which binds the 
target RNAs and renders them visible as bright spots un-
der the confocal microscope [15] (Figure 1B). From here 
onwards we refer to the T7 Φ10 promoter as T7 promoter.

B. Microscopy 
For live cell microscopy, BL21(DE3) cells were incu-
bated in M63 medium supplemented with Glucose (0.4%) 
and the appropriate concentration of Chloramphenicol and 
Kanamycin (Sigma Aldrich, USA) and was grown over-
night at 30oC, with shaking (250 rpm). Cells from the 
overnight culture were then diluted in fresh M63 medium, 
with an initial OD600 ~ 0.05, and incubated at 37oC, for 
90 minutes with shaking (250 rpm). Then, cells were pel-
leted and re-suspended in ~100 µl of M63 medium. Four 
microliters of cells were placed between a 3% agarose gel 
pad, made with M63 medium, and a glass coverslip before 
assembling the imaging chamber (CFCS2, Bioptechs, 
USA). Two hours before the microscopy measurements, a 
ﬂow of fresh M63 medium at 37oC containing the reporter 
inducer (0.8% L-arabinose) was initiated with a peristaltic 
pump at a rate of 1 ml/min to produce sufficient MS2-
GFP molecules in the cells to detect the target RNA in all 
experiments. Note that we shifted the temperature in the 
chamber from 37oC to 20oC or to 43oC (depending on the 
condition studied), 20 minutes prior to inducing the target 
system. 
To activate the target system, we induced the produc-
tion of T7 RNAP, controlled by PlacUV5, by introducing a 
new flow (1 ml/min) of M63 medium containing 0.8% L-
arabinose and Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside 
(IPTG) at various concentrations (see below). Once syn-
thesized, T7 RNAPs will bind the T7 promoter and tran-
scribe 48bs RNAs, which are quickly bound by MS2-GPF 
molecules and appear under the confocal microscope as 
bright spots (Figure 1B).

and the MS2-GFP tagged RNA molecules inside. (C) Segmented cells 
and RNA spots within. 
Cells imaging was started at the same time as the in-
troduction of the flow containing IPTG. Images were 
captured every minute for 2 hours using an inverted mi-
croscope Nikon Eclipse (Ti-E, Nikon, Japan). Both confo-
cal images (confocal C2+ scanner connected to LU3 laser 
system, Nikon) and phase contrast images (DS-Fi2 CCD-
camera) were collected. 
Examples of confocal images of cells are shown in 
Figure 1B. Note that, at the end of the time series, the 
fluorescent background in some cells becomes dimmed 
due to the produced RNAs having bound most MS2-GFP 
molecules in the cytoplasm. 
C. Image analysis 
The segmentation of cells and detection of RNA spots 
were performed by the software “iCellFusion” [16]. It first 
applies the cell segmentation on phase contrast images 
using a Gradient Path Labelling Algorithm [17]. Then, it 
performs the inter-modal image registration between 
phase-contrast images and the corresponding fluorescence 
images and exports the segmentation results on fluores-
cence images. The spot detection was performed as in 
[18]. Results from the segmentation and spot detection 
algorithms are shown in Figure 1C. 
D. Data analysis 
The cell-to-cell variability in the kinetics of intake of 
IPTG, which affects the activation of PlacUV5 [19][20], 
creates extrinsic variability regarding when the first RNA 
appears in each cell. Since we are only interested in the 
intrinsic noise of the transcription process, to correct for 
this, we fit the total spot intensity in each cell over time 
with an activation function:

)
activation
activation
actiovation
x t
c t
c
H t
t

where t is time, tactivation is activation time of T7 when the 
48bs RNA production reaches steady state, c is the mean 
increment rate of total spot intensity and H is a unit step 
function. With the function in (1) fitted using least mean 
squared, we find tactivation for each cell. The total spot in-
tensities are then aligned using the inferred tactivation, so as 
to compare the kinetics of active T7 promoters in individ-
ual cells. 
We found by inspection that, at 37oC, in the first ~18 
minutes, the mean curve of the aligned total spot intensi-
ties can be well fitted with a linear function, indicating 
that RNA production in most cells reached a steady state 
after their corresponding tactivation. After the 18th minute, 
the mean spot intensity increases with decreasing speed, 
visibly due to increasing shortage of free MS2-GFP. 
Therefore, for this condition, we select the data in the first 
18 minutes for RNA quantification as in [18][21]. Note 
also that for different temperatures and IPTG concentra-
tions, the window for RNA quantification differs (data not 
shown). 
E. qPCR 
Cells grown to OD600 ~0.4 were induced with the ap-
propriate IPTG concentration (5-250 µM) for 1 hour, at 
the specific temperature (20oC, 37oC and 43oC). After-
wards, cells were fixed with RNAprotect bacteria reagent 
(Qiagen, Germay), followed by total RNA isolation, 
DNase I treatment (ThermoScientific, USA) and cDNA

(Forward: 5’ TCCTGAGGCTCTCACCGC 3’ and Re-
verse: 5’ GATACGGCGAGACTTGCGA 3’). For the 
reference gene 16SrRNA, the primers were (Forward: 5’ 
GCTACAATGGCGCATACAAA 3’ and Reverse: 5’ TT 
CATGGAGTCGAGTTGCAG 3’). The data from CFX 
Manager TM Software was used to obtain the relative 
gene expression and standard error [22]. 
F. Model of T7 promoter transcription kinetics 
To study how the kinetics of the T7 promoter changes 
with temperature, we assume the modelling strategy of 
transcription proposed in [23][24][25], derived from both 
in vitro and in vivo studies on viral [11][26] and E. coli 
promoters [8][25][27][28][29]. The model of transcription 
kinetics of T7 promoter is as follows:

where R is an active T7 RNAP, Pr is a free promoter, Prcc 
is a fully formed closed complex, and Proc is a fully 
formed open complex. The closed complex formation 
occurs at the rate kcc. Once the closed complex is formed, 
the promoter can either be unbound by the R at the rate 
k’cc or undergo open complex formation at the rate koc. 
Due to fast promoter escape [30], the low frequency of 
abortive initiation [6] and the fast rate of elongation of T7 
RNAP [5][11][31], we assume that the RNAP and target 
RNA are released soon after completion of the open com-
plex. Note that this model does not include an ON-OFF 
mechanism since T7 is a constitutive promoter. 
From

the 
mean of the interval distribution 
(Δt) between consecutive transcription events is:

where R is the abundance of T7 RNAP in the cell, K is 
ratio between k’cc and koc indicating the reversibility of the 
closed complex, τ(R) is the time for an RNAP to commit 
to the open complex formation, and τoc is time for open 
complex formation. From (3), the production interval 
Δt(R) is a linear function of the inverse of T7 RNAP level 
(1/R), and thus:

With each set of values of R.kcc, K, and koc, we use the 
Chemical Master Equation (CME) to find the distribution 
of intervals between consecutive RNA production events, 
from which the mean rate and noise in transcription are 
extracted.

RESULTS  
This section comprises the results, obtained from the 
measurements, which are presented into three separate 
subsections.  
A. Validation of the construct with the T7 promoter 
First, to validate that the T7 promoter inserted in the 
F-plasmid (Methods) is active, we measured the RNA 
levels of the T7 RNAP and of the target gene by qPCR for 
varying IPTG concentrations (which control the expres-
sion of T7 RNAP). Results are shown in Figure 2.  
 
 
Figure 2. Relative RNA levels of T7 RNAP (light grey) and target 
gene (48bs) (dark grey) at 37oC with varying IPTG concentrations as 
measured by qPCR. Also shown for each condition are the standard 
errors from 3 technical replicates. 
From Figure 2, first, both the T7 RNAP’s and target 
gene’s levels do not increase significantly with increasing 
IPTG concentrations beyond 100 µM, suggesting that the 
lacUV5 promoter is fully induced at this concentration. In 
Figure 2, the data is normalized by the RNA levels at 250 
µM IPTG. We validated these measurements, in the case 
of the target RNA, by observing its production dynamic at 
175 µM, 250 µM and 1000 µM IPTG at 37oC under the 
microscope (via MS2-GFP tagging, Methods). 
While we observed changes in the mean activation 
time of the T7 promoter with changing IPTG concentra-
tion (data not shown), we did not observe a significant 
change in mean transcription rate (µΔt ~350 s). 
Finally, we find an increase in both the T7 RNAP’s 
and target gene’s RNA expression with increasing IPTG 
concentration, demonstrating that both genes are active. 
Note the close correlation between the activities of the 
two genes, indicating that the T7 promoter is, as expected, 
under the control of the T7 RNAP. 
B. T7 promoter dynamics at various temperatures 
We next observed the transcription dynamics of T7 
promoter at different temperatures (within sub-optimal 
intervals). The IPTG concentration used was 250 µM, in 
order to ensure that lacUV5 is fully induced in all condi-
tions. Under the microscope, all cells appeared to grow 
normally, with reduced division rates at lower tempera-
tures. In particular, cells’ mean doubling times were 50 
min, 60 min and 100 min at 43oC, 37oC and 20oC respec-
tively.

From the RNA numbers over time in individual cells 
as observed by microscopy at different temperatures, we 
extracted the mean duration (µ) and coefficient of varia-
tion squared (CV2) of the intervals between consecutive 
RNA appearances in individual cells as in [18][32]. Re-
sults are shown in Table I.  
For each temperature, the number of cells observed, 
the number of samples collected (intervals between con-
secutive RNAs in individual cells), and the mean and CV2 
of the intervals between consecutive RNA appearances in 
individual cells are shown. The final column shows the 
relative RNA levels of T7 RNAP measured by qPCR 
(normalized by RNA levels at 37oC).

From Table I, somewhat surprisingly but in agreement 
with a previous observation by in vitro methods [5], the 
mean length of the RNA production intervals, µ, increases 
with decreasing temperature. Overall, this indicates that 
the in vivo kinetics of transcription initiation of the T7 
promoter is temperature dependent. 
Notably, the mean transcription rates in vivo are ap-
proximately one order of magnitude smaller than those 
reported from in vitro tests [5][11]. This weaker activity 
in live cells is likely due to the more limited amount of T7 
RNAP (bound by the limits in lacUV5’s activity) and 
limited resources (ATP, ribonucleotides, etc.) in the host 
cells to support the viral transcription process. 
Also in Table I, the noise in transcription (as measured 
by CV2) decreases with decreasing temperature. A previ-
ous work reported a similar result for PtetA, a native pro-
moter of E. coli [8]. 
In addition, in all conditions, the RNA production ap-
pears to be a sub-Poissonian process (CV2<1). This sug-
gests that it consists of multiple rate-limiting steps rather 
than being dominated by an ON-OFF process [11]. Simi-
lar in vivo sub-Poissonian dynamics of transcription has 
been observed in several E. coli promoters, native and 
synthetic, when under full induction [8][28][33]. 
Overall, the results suggest that the process of tran-
scription initiation of the T7 promoter by the T7 RNAP is 
similar to that of E. coli native promoters. 
Meanwhile, from the relative numbers of T7 RNAP as 
measured by qPCR, we find that unlike when controlling 
with IPTG concentrations, the kinetics of RNA production 
of the target promoter T7 no longer follows solely the T7 
RNAP numbers, as its production rate is not maximized at 
37oC while T7 RNAP numbers are. Therefore, we con-
clude that the observed changes in the T7 promoter dy-
namics are due to changes in both the kinetic rates of T7 
transcription and in T7 RNAP numbers. 
C. Estimation of kinetic rates of the T7 promoter  
We searched for changes in the underlying kinetics of 
transcription initiation of the T7 promoter (i.e. in the dura-
tion of the closed and open complex formation) with tem-
perature that can explain the changes in the target RNA 
production with changing temperature. 
To quantify how the kinetic rates of T7 promoter 
evolve with temperature, we followed the strategy pro-
posed in [12] by investigating, for each temperature, how 
the transcription activity on T7 promoter is affected by the 
T7 RNAP abundance. This abundance should affect the 
kinetics of the closed complex formation, but not that of 
the steps following the closed complex [12]. 
Here, the T7 RNAP levels, varied by employing dif-
ferent IPTG concentrations (5 µM, 10 µM, 25 µM, 50 µM 
and 250 µM), and the T7 promoter’s activity are measured 
relatively by qPCR. From these, we infer what would be 
the relative rate of RNA production given an infinite 
amount of T7 RNAP in cells (Methods). This rate should 
correspond to the fraction of time of the transcription 
initiation process that corresponds to the open complex 
formation alone [12]. Results for each temperature condi-
tion are shown in ‘ plots’ in Figure 3.

In Figure 3, the data is shown relative to the RNA and 
RNAP levels at 250 µM IPTG. Error bars represent the

standard error of the mean (SEM) of the estimate of the 
inverse of the relative rates of transcription for the target 
RNA and T7 RNAP in each condition. The lines are 
Weighted Total Least Squares fits [34]. Errors are calcu-
lated including the uncertainty in the 250 µM IPTG condi-
tion in the plot (thus removing the error from that point). 
From Figure 3, the ratio between the inverse of the T7 
RNA production rate for infinite T7 RNAP numbers in the 
cells (R-1=0) equals 0.82 at 43oC, 0.81 at 37oC, and 0.21 at 
20oC. These numbers correspond also to the ratio between 
open complex formation (τoc) and mean transcription in-
terval (Δt), described in Table I (Methods). 
Next, from the ratio (τoc /Δt), we calculated the rate of 
open complex formation (koc). Given the value of koc, we 
can find the values of kcc and K to achieve the same mean 
and noise (with 95% accuracy) of the transcription inter-
vals shown in Table I (Methods). Results are shown in 
Table II. Shown are the rate of open complex formation 
(koc), the reversibility of the closed complex formation (K) 
and the rate of closed complex formation (R.kcc), given 
the empirical values of the ratio (τoc/Δt) extracted from 
Figure 3.

From Table II, the formation of the open complex, fol-
lowing the T7 RNAP commitment to the closed complex, 
is faster at 20oC and slower at 37oC and 43oC. This seem-
ingly counterintuitive response suggests that, at higher 
temperatures, the open complex may be less stable and 
that, has a consequence, it becomes more reversible to the 
previous state rather than to committing to the elongation 
complex. 
Namely, the reversibility of the closed complex (K) 
increases with increasing temperature. At 43oC, the closed 
complex appears to be highly unstable and T7 RNAP 
likely binds and unbinds from the T7 promoter several 
times before being able to form a stable open complex, 
thus reducing the rate of RNA production. At 37oC, the 
closed complex appears to be more stable, with a ~50% 
chance of the RNAP unbinding. At 20oC, the chance of 
this RNAP unbinding appears to become negligible, likely 
due to both more stable closed complex formation and 
faster rate of open complex formation. 
Finally, the rate of closed complex formation (R.kcc) 
becomes slower with decreasing temperature. It should be 
noted that this rate is highly dependent on lacUV5’s 
strength (which determines R) and therefore is not a prop-
erty of the natural system. In the future, direct measure-
ments of the relative T7 RNAP protein levels should help 
revealing the temperature dependence of the closed com-
plex (kcc) of this system. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The T7 bacteriophage has only the lytic cycle. Once 
infecting an E. coli cell, its genes transcription is activated 
and proceeds uninterruptedly until the replication of the 
viral DNA it achieved [2]. The dynamics of transcription 
(mean and noise), should therefore play a key role in the 
success rate of this process. Consequently, for this process 
to be successful in temperature-fluctuating environments, 
the transcription process ought itself to be robust to a wide 
range of temperature conditions. 
To assess this robustness, we observed for the first 
time the in vivo transcription initiation kinetics of the T7 
promoter at the single RNA level as a function of temper-
ature. Our results suggest that, as temperature decreases, 
both the mean rate of RNA production and the noise in 
this process decrease. This somewhat surprising result 
appears to be made possible by the stabilization of the 
closed complex formation at lower temperatures. 
Our results are, to some extent, similar to those report-
ed for a natural promoter of E. coli, PtetA. Namely, its ini-
tiation kinetics is also sub-Poissonian, with two rate-
limiting steps, the closed and the open complex, whose 
duration is temperature dependent [8]. However, in PtetA, 
the noise increases for decreasing temperature.  
At the moment, it is unknown what specificities the 
configuration or composition of the T7 promoter allow 
this opposite behavior, but this knowledge should be of 
value to the future engineering of synthetic genes and 
circuits with robust behaviors at low temperature condi-
tions. From the evolutionary point of view, such noise 
reduction with lowering temperatures could be associated 
with the need of the virus for balancing the numbers of 
phages and capsid proteins more accurately as their total 
numbers are reduced due to the lowering of the mean 
production rate [2][7]. 
In this regard, note from Table I that the relative in-
crease in the interval between RNA productions as tem-
perature decreases from 37oC to 20oC is smaller than the 
decrease in T7 RNAP numbers (which here are artificially 
controlled by the LacUV5 promoter). This suggests that, 
provided a constant number of T7 RNAP for changing 
temperature, the mean rate of transcription from the T7 
promoter will not decrease heavily for decreasing temper-
ature in this range. 
In the future, we will employ the system used here 
and, among other, make use of different promoters con-
trolling the expression of the T7 RNAP so as to, by com-
paring the various results, isolate the effects of tempera-
ture on the T7 promoter alone. Also, we observed that this 
system is capable of quickly depleting cells from MS2-
GFP. This may allow studying the kinetics of binding and 
unbinding of MS2-GFP to the target RNA as a function of 
temperature, which might give insights, e.g., on the pro-
cess by which viral RNAs are protected from the host 
degradation mechanisms.
