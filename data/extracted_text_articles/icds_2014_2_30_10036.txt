Abstract— eDemocracy is one of eGovernment services which 
aims at fostering public governance and increasing public 
participation in the governmental decision making process. 
Our review of related literature revealed that only a paucity of 
research looked at eDemocracy topic from the adoption 
perspective, and this is much more evident in the context of 
developing countries. As such and aiming to fulfill this gap, in 
this study we aim at examining the adoption intention of 
eDemocracy in Jordan as a case study from developing 
countries. To do so, this study develops an integrative model on 
the basis of Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which are both well-
established theories in the field of Information Systems. 
Results indicate that both perceived usefulness and perceived 
ease of use are direct predictors of attitude. Further, the results 
reveal that attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral 
control directly and positively affect the adoption intention of 
eDemocracy in Jordan. However, subjective norm was found 
to have the strongest effect. The study also provides important 
implications for theory and practice.

 INTRODUCTION  
Electronic government (eGovernment) refers to the use 
of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools 
and applications so as to enhance transparency and 
accountability in public administration by improving public 
service delivery, access to information and services, in 
addition to governance [26][28][66]. However, the main 
emphasis of eGovernment is not only on the implementation 
of new ICT systems per se, but also on how to achieve the 
strategic goals of governments with the aid of various ICTs. 
One of the main strategic goals of implementing an 
eGovernment is the transformation of political systems; the 
so-called eDemocracy [26][54]. eDemocracy, in the form of 
greater public participation in decision making process, is 
expected to move governments forward by enabling effective 
representative democracy and by enhancing  public 
governance [26]. This study explores the adoption of 
information and communication technologies and more 
specifically the internet technology within the context of 
citizen’s participation in democratic processes.  
The existing literature on Information Technology (IT) 
adoption has cover many different contexts, such as IT 
adoption 
[8][17][70], 
eBusiness 
and 
eCommerce 
[36][60][75], eLearning [11][15][56][62], Internet banking 
[1][24][44][49], mobile services [6][12][73][74], social 
networking 
[7][18][53], 
and 
eGovernment 
[5][10][20][22][23][52]. 
Numerous 
theoretical 
models, 
primarily developed from theories in sociology and 
psychology, have been applied to evaluate users’ adoption 
new technologies. Among the widely used theories in this 
domain are the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) [4], 
Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) [2][3], and Technology 
Acceptance Model (TAM) [30].  
However, the findings of prior research demonstrate that 
citizen participation in eGovernment remains below 
expectations in all countries around the world [54]. By 
examining previous relevant research, one can easily notice 
that there is only little theoretical grounded studies 
approaching technology adoption in relation to eDemocracy 
[57], and more specifically, in developing countries. Hence, 
aiming to fill this gap, this study integrates TAM with TPB, 
so as to comprehensively understand the factors affecting the 
adoption intention of eDemocracy tools in Jordan as a 
developing country. By doing so, we believe that we could 
offer some deeper insights to explain the role of technology 
in citizen’s participation.  
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 
II, the concept of democracy is discussed. In Section III, the 
related theories (i.e., TPB and TAM) are described. In 
Section IV, the developed research model and hypotheses are 
discussed. In Section V, the employed research methodology 
is described. In Section VI, the study results are presented.

Finally, in Section VII, the study results along with their 
implications are discussed, and conclusions are presented.  
II. 
THE CONCEPT OF EDEMOCRACY 
eDemocracy, sometimes referred to as digital democracy, 
has received great attention in recent years [43]. There is no 
universally accepted definition of the eDemocracy concept. 
Mahrer and Krimmer [54: p.1] define eDemocracy simply as 
"an approach for increased and better quality citizen 
participation in the democratic processes". eDemocracy can 
also be broader and more complex and can be viewed as the 
use of Internet and its associated technologies (especially 
Web 2.0 tools) as well as mobile technologies including 
smart phones to enhance the public governance. It has the 
potential to provide a new avenue for participation, 
collaboration, deliberation and engagement in the political 
process that can make democratic processes more inclusive 
and transparent [57]. Despite the diversity of eDemocracy 
definitions found in the literature, there is a common central 
concept that underlies all these definitions- the assumption of 
normative goals of eDemocracy: to empower citizen 
engagement in public consultations for policy making 
through the utilization of new technologies and to enhance 
democratic processes and structures [29].  
The literature on eGovernment often viewed eDemocracy 
as a component of overall eGovernment initiatives that aims 
to allow wider access to, and the delivery of, government 
information and services [26][54].  In their eGovernment 
development (i.e., maturity) model, Chatfield and Alhujran 
[26] proposed eDemocracy as the fourth stage of 
eGovernment service delivery capability development. This 
stage of eGovernment service delivery capability enables the 
public to participate in the process of transforming the 
government forward towards its democratic goals in terms of 
improved transparency and governance. Although offering 
eDemocracy functionalities to the public does not imply that 
a state or a government will be democratic automatically, 
greater public engagement is expected to have a positive 
impact on public governance (i.e., better transparency and 
accountability) [26].  
A considerable amount of literature has already been 
published on the important role of citizens’ participation and 
engagement towards public-policy making [26][29][67]. 
Many governments around the globe are engaging their 
citizens for feedback via their eGovernment websites [67]. 
By developing eDemocracy capabilities, such as eVoting, 
online polling mechanism, online surveys, discussion forums 
and online communities, eGovernment offerings have the 
ability to exchange opinions and viewpoints on issues that 
are important to governments and to members of society. 
eDemocracy including Web 2.0 and social networking sites 
can be used by governments to empower citizens by enabling 
them to express their opinions and by offering more 
opportunities for their voices to be heard by decision makers 
[67]. 
Despite the lack of economic resources, Jordan has 
developed and implemented many successful eDemocracy 
and eParticipation tools. A recent study conducted by Al-
Hujran [9] indicated that the majority of ministries (46 per 
cent) offer some eDemocracy capabilities to citizens. In 
addition, the eGovernment program in this country has 
substantially moved forward in the eParticipation index 
worldwide, from being ranked 90th in the 2005 United 
Nations’ eGovernment readiness report to 15th in the 2008 
report. By using online polling mechanisms, discussion 
forums and online consultation facilities provided by 
government websites, Jordanians have the ability to 
exchange opinions and viewpoints on issues of importance 
with governments and with other members of society. 
However, public intention to use the existing eDemocracy 
tools is remain unexplored. This study is probably one of the 
first to determine the factors that may influence citizens’ 
adoption of such tools in Jordan. 
III. 
RELATED THEORIES: TPB AND TAM 
Previous research have utilized and employed a number 
of theories in order to explain users' adoption and acceptance 
of technologies. This includes Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM), Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory 
of Planned Behaviour (TPB), Diffusion of Innovation 
Theory (DOI), Technology-Task Fit (TTF), Unified Theory 
for Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and 
others.  In this study, we aim to integrate two of the most 
widely adopted theories in explaining acceptance and 
adoption of technologies, which are TPB and TAM so as to 
end up with a comprehensive model to examine the adoption 
intention of eDemocracy technologies by Jordanian Citizens. 
TPB would help us in examining eDemocracy adoption from 
a social perspective, whilst TAM is useful to examine the 
adoption of eDemocracy tools from a technical perspective 
by highlighting the important roles of usefulness and ease of 
use. The integration of the aforementioned two models 
would enable us to get a more cohesive understanding of the 
phenomenon under investigation from a socio-technical 
paradigm.  
A. Theory of Planned Behavior  
TPB is considered as one of the most influential theories 
in predicting and explaining behaviour. Various studies 
showed the applicability of TPB to various domains, and 
verified the ability of this theory in providing a valuable 
framework for explaining and predicting the acceptance of 
new information technology [47]. According to TPB, 
people’s behaviors are determined by their intentions to 
perform the behaviour, where their intentions are influenced 
by attitudes towards behaviour, subjective norms, and their 
perceived behavioural control. The history of theory of 
planned behavior is traced back to the theory of reasoned 
action, developed by Ajzen and Fishbein [4].  
The general framework of the theory of planned 
behaviour 
postulates 
three 
conceptually 
independent 
determinants of members' intentions, namely, Attitudes, 
Subjective Norms, and Perceived Behavioural Control. 
Attitude towards the behaviour refers to the degree to which 
a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation or 
appraisal of the behaviour to be acted upon [58][65]. 
Individual attitude is determined by personal beliefs and 
traits that characterize that individual in particular. The 
40

ICDS 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Digital Society

second determinant strongly relates to social factors and is 
termed as individuals' subjective norms. Subjective norms 
refer to the perceived social pressure of the external 
environment surrounding individuals on whether to perform 
certain behaviour or not, and how family and friends would 
affect his/her perception of whether to behave in a certain 
way or not. This construct is consistently a weaker predictor 
of physical activity intentions than attitudes and perceived 
behavioral control [39][40]. The third antecedent of 
individuals' behavioral intentions is the degree of Perceived 
Behavioural Control which refers to one‘s perceived ease or 
difficulty of performing the behaviour [58]. Interestingly, 
Ajzen [3] assumes that perceived behavioral control reflects 
to some extent past experience as well as other anticipated 
hurdles and obstacles (i.e., resources and opportunities 
available to a person) which might be internal or external.  
B. Technology Acceptance Model  
TAM focuses on explaining the attitude behind the 
intention to adopt, accept and use a specific technology or 
service [63]. It is an adaptation of the TRA from psychology 
specifically tailored to model user acceptance of Information 
Technology (IT). TAM has been widely applied in 
acceptance behaviour across a broad range of IT 
[10][37][50][51][72]. However, it places more emphasis on 
the role of technology in affecting users' intentions towards 
their behaviors.  
TAM is primarily built on the TRA, Expectancy Theory 
[61][71], and Efficacy Theory [19]. It theorizes that one’s 
behavioral intentions are determined by two specific belief 
constructs (perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use). 
In short, if the central goal is to predict IT adoption from an 
IT perspective, it can be argued that the TAM is preferable 
for the reason that it focuses on system design 
characteristics. TAM predicts whether individuals will 
accept and voluntary use a certain system.  
However, the TAM's fundamental constructs do not fully 
reflect the specific influences of technological and usage-
context factors that may influence users’ acceptance [55]. 
Therefore, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use 
may not fully explain behavioral intentions towards the use 
of eDemocracy if not integrated with other social-related 
factors. Its fundamental constructs do not fully reflect the 
variety of user task environment and constraints [34]. 
Moreover, TAM does not take into account the human and 
social factors that the TPB considers.  
IV. 
RESEARCH MODEL AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT 
Aiming to end up with a model which enjoys a high 
predictive and explanatory power; we in this study integrate 
TPB with TAM (see Fig. 1). This is because the Theory of 
Planned Behaviour takes only social-related factors in 
explaining 
and 
predicting 
individuals' 
adoption 
of 
technologies, but no technology-related factors are taken into 
consideration. Moreover, previous studies, for example [65], 
indicated that TPB's belief structures of intention require a 
decomposition of attitudinal beliefs if the explanatory power 
of the theory is to be increased.  
                                                                                       
 
             Figure 1.  Research Model 
 
Thus, integrating TAM with TPB would overcome the 
aforementioned limitations given that TAM examines uses' 
acceptance and adoption of technologies using technology-
related factors those reflecting design characteristics. 
Further, TAM would help in decomposing the attitude 
construct and thus helps in providing an enhanced 
explanatory power for the model.  
A. Perceived Usefulness 
Davis [30: p. 320] defined Perceived Usefulness (PU) as 
“the degree to which a person believes that using a particular 
system would enhance his or her job performance”. Previous 
studies indicated that citizens form positive attitudes toward 
a technology if they perceive that technology to be useful 
[5][34][38]. In our case, using eDemocracy tools is believed 
to be useful as it can be used by governments to enable 
citizens to express their opinions. This can lead to greater 
public governance convenience and better transparency and 
accountability. Thus, this study postulates the following 
hypothesis. 
 
H1. Perceived Usefulness directly and positively influences 
citizen's attitude towards eDemocracy tools.   
B. Perceived Ease of Use 
Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) refers to “the degree to 
which a person believes that using a particular system would 
be free of effort” [30: p.320]. In the context of eGovernment, 
several researchers reported the importance of PEOU as a 
determinant of the citizen adoption of eGovernment services, 
either directly or indirectly [5][21][34]. Findings of these 
studies 
acknowledged 
that 
developing 
eGovernment 
websites that are easy to use and more user-friendly would 
positively influence citizen attitude toward using these 
services.  Based on this discussion, it is believed that citizens 
are likely to form positive attitudes if they consider their use 
of eDemocracy tools requires little efforts. Accordingly, we 
hypothesize the following.

H2. Perceived ease of use directly and positively influences 
citizen's attitude toward eDemocracy tools. 
C. Attitude 
Attitude towards the behaviour refers to the degree to 
which a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation or 
appraisal of the behaviour to be acted upon [3][58][65] and 
defined by salient beliefs about consequences multiplied by 
outcome evaluations [46]. Previous studies in studying 
behavior in the use of technology emphasize the positive 
relationship between attitude and behavioral intentions 
[31][69]. In our case, a citizen would evaluate the value of 
using eDemocracy tools, on the basis of his or her personal 
beliefs. When citizens believe that the use of eDemocracy as 
a medium for promoting democratic activities to be positive, 
they will form strong intentions to use its capabilities. 
Therefore, this study proposes the following hypothesis.  
 
H3. There is a direct positive effect of attitude on the 
behavioral intention to use eDemocracy tools. 
D. Subjective Norm 
The second attitudinal determinant, according to the 
TPB, strongly relates to social factors and is termed as 
subjective norm. Subjective norm refers to the perceived 
social pressure of the external environment surrounding 
individuals on whether to perform a behaviour, or not [2]. 
Subjective norm is a function of individual’s perceived 
expectations of important others (e.g., family and friends) 
and his or her motivation to act in accordance with such 
expectations. Prior eGovernment, research has investigated 
subjective norm as a significant predictor of intention to use 
eGovernment services [34][47]. They found that the 
subjective norm of citizens positively influences their 
behavioral intentions. Specifically, in the context of 
eDemocracy, subjective norm can be recognized as pressure 
comes from journalists to use recent web technologies such 
as blogs, wikis, discussion forums, Web 2.0 applications, and 
other 
social 
media to communicate 
and 
exchange 
information 
promoting 
democracy. 
Pressure 
to 
use 
eDemocracy tools may also stem from social referents like 
peers within the sector, or government. It also may come 
from eDemocracy rhetoric, discussions, and debates from 
academics, politicians, practitioners, and the media [57]. In 
sum, we expect that subjective norm can affect a citizen’s 
behavioral intention to use eDemocarcy tools. Thus, we 
hypothesize the following. 
 
H4. There is a direct positive effect of subjective norm on the 
behavioral intention to use eDemocracy tools 
E. Perceived Behavioral Control 
The construct of perceived behavioral control refers to 
individual's perception of the amount of control she/he has 
over carrying out certain behaviour [3]. This perception is 
closely related to the perception on how easy or difficult to 
perform the behaviour [58]. Interestingly, Ajzen [3] assumes 
that perceived behavioral control reflects to some extent 
situational influences and past experience as well as other 
anticipated hurdles and obstacles (i.e., resources and 
opportunities available). Having control over one‘s own 
behaviour is a major determinant influencing human 
intentions to participate and engage in a digitally engaged 
community. In our case, citizen’s self-evaluation of his 
ability to use eDemocracy tools can influence his/her 
intention to use these technologies. Indeed, eGovernment 
literature has empirically proven the importance of PBC in 
determining citizens' intentions to use eGovernment services 
in general [47] and eDemocracy in particular [57]. 
Accordingly, a positive influence of PBC on behavioral 
intentions to use eDemocracy tools is hypothesized in this 
study. 
 
H5. There is a direct positive effect of perceived behavioral 
control on the behavioral intention to use eDemocracy tools.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
This section is dedicated to show the followed data 
collection procedure, sample profile, and measurement 
scales of the model's constructs. 
A. Data Collection and Measurement Scales 
This is a quantitative study that utilized the survey 
questionnaire as the main instrument for data collection. 
Hence, a self-completion, well-structured questionnaire was 
developed based on previous literature and was then 
distributed to a random sample and participation was 
completely voluntary. Prior research showed that the 
educated Jordanian citizens are the early adopters of the 
Internet [13] and are likely users of eGovernment and 
eDemocracy services in Jordan.  For this study, therefore, we 
identify the university students who are Jordanian citizens as 
our population. A total of 250 questionnaires were 
distributed to community colleges, undergraduate and 
postgraduate students in Jordan and 195 questionnaires were 
returned. Thus, the response rate was (78%). Amongst the 
195 returned questionnaires, only six questionnaires were 
excluded due to multiple skipped questions and missing 
values. In total, 189 responses (n = 189) were valid and 
usable for data analysis.  
The constructs of interest in this study were “Attitude” 
(ATT), “Subjective Norm” (SN), “Perceived Behavioural 
Control” (PBC), and “Behavioural Intention to Use” (BI). 
The developed questionnaire in this study adapted validated 
questionnaire items from previous literature with some 
modifications to fit the specific context of this research. 
Measurements for subjective norms (SN), attitude (ATT), 
and perceived behavioral control (PBC) were adopted from 
[7]. As for behavioral intention to use (BI), perceived 
usefulness (PU), and perceived ease of use constructs, 
measurements were adopted from [5] and [59]. All items 
were measured using a five-point Likert-type scale, ranging 
from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree". Table I lists the 
questionnaire items.

aged between 26-45 years represented 14.8% of the sample. 
Finally, 13.2% of the respondents aged above 46 years. In 
terms of their education, the majority respondents (i.e., 74%) 
are pursuing their undergraduate or community college 
degrees, whilst those pursing their postgraduate degrees 
represented only 26% of the sample. The details are shown

DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 
This study utilizes the Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM) approach [41], with Partial Least Square (PLS) [42] 
as an analysis method. PLS has been widely used for theory 
testing and validation. PLS examines the psychometric 
properties and provides appropriate evidences on whether 
relationships might or might not exist [33]. In this study, we 
performed data analysis in accordance with a two-stage 
methodology [14] using Smart PLS 2.0 M3. The first step 
was to test the content, convergent, and discriminant validity 
of constructs using the measurement model, whilst the 
second step was to test the structural model and hypotheses. 
A. Measurement Model 
First, we assessed the reliability and validity of the 
measurement instrument using content, reliability, and 
convergent validity criteria. The content validity of our 
survey instrument was established in two ways. First, the 
constructs along with their measures which are used in this 
study were already validated in previous studies as they were 
all adopted from the existing literature. Second, the results of 
the pre-test we undertook with subject-matter experts assured 
content validity of the survey instrument. For reliability of 
the scale, Cronbach’s alpha, which is a common method 
used to measure the reliability and internal consistency of 
scales, was used. Hair et al. [41] suggested that the reliability 
of the scale is generally accepted if the value of Cronbach’s 
alpha for each construct is equal or greater than 0.70. The 
constructs included within the study’s model exhibit a high 
degree of internal consistency as the values of Cronbach’s 
alpha ranged from 0.86 (PEOU) to 0.94 (PU), as shown in 
Table III.

A Composite Reliability (CR) and Average Variance 
Extracted (AVE) tests were conducted to measure 
convergent validity. Fornell and Larcker [33] suggested that 
the value of CR for each construct must exceed 0.70 whilst 
the value of the AVE must exceed 0.50 for the convergent 
validity to be assured. The CR and AVE values for the 
constructs included in the study model are all above 
acceptable levels. Moreover, the standardized path loadings 
for all indicators were above 0.55 and thus they are all 
significant [32].

Note: The square roots of the constructs’ AVE values are shown in the 
diagonal line (in bold); non-diagonal elements are latent variable 
correlations. 
 
As such, content validity, reliability, and convergent 
validity of the measurement instrument are all satisfactorily 
met in this research. As for discriminant validity, it is 
actually established when the square root of the AVE from 
the construct is greater than the correlation shared between 
the construct and other constructs in the model [27]. The 
discriminant validity of the measurement instrument is 
confirmed in this study given that the square root of the AVE 
from each construct is larger than all other cross-correlations 
with other constructs (see Table IV). 
B. Structural Model 
The results of the PLS-SEM analysis show, as in Fig. 2, 
the structural model estimation and evaluation of the 
relationships between attitude, subjective norm, perceived 
behavioral control and the target construct; i.e., behavioral 
adoption intention of eDemocracy. Fig. 2 also shows the 
structural 
model 
estimation 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
relationships between perceived usefulness, perceived ease 
of use, and the attitude construct. The R2 value for each 
endogenous construct (i.e., attitude, and behavioral adoption 
intention 
of 
eDemocracy) 
was 
above 
25% 
which 
demonstrate a highly acceptable prediction level in empirical 
research [16][35].The coefficient of determination R2, which 
is the central criterion for the structural model’s assessment 
[48], has a high value of 0.504 for this study’s key target 
construct; i.e., behavioral adoption intention of eDemoacracy 
technology. Indeed, the high R2 proves the model’s 
predictive validity [42]. We support the prior finding through 
the use of Q2 predictive relevancy measure [64]. The 
obtained Q2 values, after running the blindfolding procedure 
[27] with an omission distance D=8, were (0.280) for 
attitude, and (0.404) for the main target construct; i.e., 
behavioral adoption intention of eDemocracy tools. Both of 
the Q2 values are well above zero; indicating the predictive 
relevance of the PLS path model. The bootstrapping 
procedure was used and we selected 189 cases, 5000 
samples, and the no sign changes option to evaluate the 
significance of the path coefficients [42].   
Overall, the results validate the structural model and all 
hypotheses are supported. Our results indicate that the direct 
effect of attitude on behavioral adoption intention of 
eDemocracy has a significant (p < 0.001) value of 0.341; the 
effect of subjective norm on behavioral adoption intention of 
eDemocracy also has a significant (p < 0.001) value of 
0.430; and the effect of perceived behavioral control on 
behavioral adoption intention of eDemocracy also has a 
significant (p < 0.001) value of 0.219. Thus, hypotheses 1, 2, 
and 3 have been empirically substantiated. Our results also 
indicate that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use 
are two major determinants of attitude (β = 0.51, p < 0.001;β 
= 0.19, p < 0.001 respectively). Hence, hypotheses 4 and 5 
are also supported. 
VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
This study examines behavioral adoption intention of 
eDemocracy, using an integrative model that integrates two 
key behavioral adoption models: TPB and TAM. This study 
contributes to the understanding of inherent predictors of 
eDemocracy adoption. A major contribution is re-examining 
salient theories and model and empirically validating a set of 
interrelationships between key constructs that tend to be 
associated with behavioral intention by Arabian citizens who 
have a socio-cultural background different from developed 
countries in the Europe, U.S., or Asia. It is believed that the 
research model developed in this study can serve as a 
foundation for future research on citizen adoption of

eDemocracy tools. The overall research findings firmly 
support the validity of the developed model, accounting for 
50.4% of the variances in citizens' intentions to adopt these 
tools. Specifically, all proposed factors (PU, PEOU, ATT, 
PBC, and SN) were shown to be significant predictors of 
citizens’ intention to use eDemocracy tools. These findings 
support the significance of the developed model in predicting 
citizens’ intentions to adopt eDemocracy tools. 
 
 
*Parameter estimates are significant at 0.001 or less (p < 0.001). 
Figure 2.  Results of the Structural Model 
 
The results show that citizens’ attitude toward 
eDemocracy is determined jointly by perceived ease of use 
and perceived usefulness. These findings are consistent with 
previous TAM research that test and validate the consistent 
relationships between perceived usefulness, perceived ease 
of use and attitude [5][25][30][68]. These results suggest that 
the government should make eDemocracy tools more useful 
and usable. For example, governments could achieve this by 
increasing citizens’ awareness about the usefulness of using 
eDemocracy services; providing eGovernment and ICT 
training workshops; and refining IT/IS systems selections to 
meet different citizens’ needs. 
Interestingly, the findings demonstrate that citizens’ 
intention to use eDemocracy tools is importantly influenced 
by subjective norms. Unsurprisingly, subjective norm was 
found to have the strongest effect on the adoption of 
eDemocracy in Jordan. The Arabian culture has a relatively 
high collectivism orientation [45]. As a result, it is expected 
that citizens in this region are more sensitive to the social 
pressures, and have a tendency of accepting their peers’ 
opinions and comply with expectations of important others 
(e.g., family and friends). This implies that eGovernment 
officials and policy makers in the Arab countries should 
carefully manage the peer influence and the social pressure 
on citizens to assist them to adopt new technologies such as 
eDemocracy tools. 
This study also shows that perceived behavioral control 
plays a significant role on citizens' intentions to adopt 
eDemocracy tools. Indeed, such significant role of this 
construct is evident in the literature [47][57]. This implies 
that governmental agencies need to provide sufficient 
resources required to use these tools. It also implies that 
governments should train and educate citizens to increase 
their self-efficacy. High self-efficacy users have higher 
perceived behavior control than other users [47].  
As with all studies, this study has its own limitations. 
This is a cross-sectional study that represents a slice of time 
and does not show how the citizen's attitude and behavior 
may change over time. Studies employing a longitudinal 
design would ascertain whether or not the citizen’s attitude 
toward using eDemocracy tools changes over time, or not. 
Another limitation is derived from the geographical location 
of the current research (i.e., Jordan). Although, the findings 
are believed to be applicable to other Arab countries that 
share demographic characteristics with Jordan and provide 
their citizens with the same level of eGovernment in general 
and eDemocracy in particular, these findings are not 
necessarily applicable to other Arab countries that lagged 
behind Jordan in terms of eGovernment and eDemocracy. 
Therefore, further study in different countries would most 
likely strengthen and validate the findings of this study.
