Abstract— Cyber security is a risk: the risk that the company’s 
information assets will be compromised in a way that affects 
their data’s integrity, availability, and/or confidentiality. Like 
any other enterprise risk, cyber risk needs to be managed in a 
way that balances the cost of risk realisation against the cost of 
mitigating that risk. Defence in depth is a seemingly simple and 
logical approach to protecting systems and data, but is defence 
alone enough, and how much is needed?  Local and global 
standards and guidelines direct companies in where to focus 
their mitigative efforts, but for the uninitiated, these can be 
confusing. Cyber security is an expensive exercise, with much 
at stake. By taking a practical approach that combines people, 
policies, processes as well as technology, organisations can 
manage the cyber security risk to protect their critical and 
sensitive information assets, and comply with government 
regulations, within a reasonable budget.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Cyber security and cyber resilience are business 
challenges and business risks. An effective cyber security 
strategy incorporates people, policies, processes, and 
technology into an over-all risk management plan, and 
integrates these aspects to implement defence in depth 
[1][31]-[33]. This way, organisations can protect their 
critical and sensitive information assets, and be proactive in 
identifying, 
preventing, 
detecting, 
responding, 
and 
recovering from cyber threats and attacks [1][7][28][31]-
[33].  
Small to medium businesses in Australia are on the 
front-line of the cyber war, and are easy pickings for cyber 
criminals, as their lack of cyber expertise and investment in 
cyber security can leave them open to exploitation.   
Implementing an effective Cyber Security Risk 
Management Plan will enable these smaller organisations to 
balance their IT security expenditure with government 
regulation and business outcomes [21]. The Australian 
Government has recently established a set of standards to 
which businesses in the financial sector must adhere [2]-[6]. 
For these smaller businesses to survive, they will 
need to protect their sensitive and critical information assets 
and satisfy the government regulations within their limited 
budgets. But how do they know where to start? And, how 
much cyber security is enough? 
While cyber risk can never be reduced to zero, this 
paper applies practical risk management to enable an 
organisation to identify where it should be focusing its 
efforts. In addition, it analyses the requirements and 
recommendations of the most visible standards and 
guidelines and draws from these an effective set of controls 
that, once applied, will protect the organisation from known 
threats and attacks, reduce the likelihood and impact of 
successful exploits, and enable the organisation to meet the 
Australian government’s new pre-requisites to do business. 
Section 2 assesses the cyber security standards and 
guidelines available to businesses in Australia’s financial 
sector. Section 3 discusses a practical approach to managing 
cyber security risk. Section 4 identifies the controls an 
organisation should apply, within this risk management 
framework, to mitigate their cyber security risk and reduce 
the residual risk to an acceptable level.

A. AS ISO/IEC 27001:2015 and AS ISO/IEC 27002:2015 
The ISO 2700X standards define the objectives and 
techniques 
for 
implementing 
information 
security 
management in an organisation [15][16]. This is the 
standard applied by the larger banks and financial 
organisations operating in Australia. It is also the standard 
used for measuring the security posture of their third-party 
suppliers. ISO 2700X require that an information security 
policy will be documented, communicated, and available; 
Persons will be assigned responsibility for implementing an 
information security management system that meets the 
stated objectives and identifies, assesses, and treats the risks 
associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or 
availability of information by implementing suitable 
controls to meet the information security objectives 
[15][16]. ISO 27001 standard specifically identifies the need 
for competent people to oversee its information security 
performance, and for all people working in the organisation 
to be aware of the information security policy and how their 
individual roles contribute to its effectiveness [15][16]. 
 
B. APRA CPS 234 
The APRA prudential standard set is aimed at the 
financial sector in Australia. CPS 234 covers the 
fundamentals of cyber security, such as the need to have an 
information security policy and security controls in-place to 
protect information assets as well as the need for third-party 
suppliers who hold an organisation’s information on their 
behalf meet these same obligations. CPS 234 requires an 
organisation to identify and classify its information assets 
by criticality and sensitivity. Criticality and sensitivity 
indicate the degree to which the organisation would be 
impacted by an incident that affects availability, integrity, 
and/or confidentiality of that asset [2][6]. An asset’s 
classification acts as a guide for selecting controls suitable 
to protect that asset. The effectiveness of these controls 
needs to be tested regularly, relative to the rate of systems 
change within the organisation, and externally in the broader 
threat landscape [2][6].  
APRA requires that an organisation be able to detect 
and respond to potential cyber incidents and that incidents 
and vulnerability test results need to be reported to the 
appropriate Information Security executive(s) and the board. 
The design and effectiveness of the information security 
controls need to be internally audited [2][6]. APRA must be 
notified within 5 days of any material information security 
incidents and/or when the organisation identifies a material 
vulnerability in its information security controls that cannot 
be remediated in a timely manner [6]. 
Leadership 
and 
board 
commitment 
are 
key 
requirements spelled out in both the APRA CPS 234 and the 
ISO2700X standards. Ownership and visible support from 
the top is critical to the success of information security 
management in an organisation as this assures the necessary 
resources are made available to establish, implement, 
maintain and continually improve the security management 
system [6][16].   
 
C. Australian Signals Directorate Top 4 and Essential 8 
The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) offers a 
comprehensive list of 37 mitigating cyber security controls 
that they have classified as essential, excellent, very good, 
good, and limited [7][8]. ASD claims that their Top 4 cyber 
mitigations will reduce the risk of a successful cyber exploit 
by 85% by decreasing the likelihood of a successful 
intrusion, and then limiting the impact of that intrusion, 
should it succeed [7]. The essential 8 includes the top 4 plus 
4 more essential mitigations [7][8]. The ASD essential 8 
mitigations are: 
1. Application whitelisting of approved programs to 
prevent the execution of malicious programs 
including .exe, DLL, scripts, and installers. 
2. Patch operating systems. Patch/mitigate computers 
(including network devices) with 'extreme risk' 
vulnerabilities within 48 hours (e.g., Remote code 
execution in Microsoft windows operating system). 
Always run the latest version of the operating 
system, and don't use unsupported versions. 
3. Patch applications such as Flash, web browsers, 
Microsoft Office, Java and PDF viewers. Use the 
latest version of applications and patch or mitigate 
extreme risk vulnerabilities within 48 hours. 
4. Restrict administrative privileges to operating 
systems and applications based on user duties. The 
need for privileged access should be regularly 
revalidated and confirmed by the person’s 
manager. Privileged accounts must not be used for 
reading email and web browsing. 
5. Harden user applications by configuring web 
browsers to block Flash, ads, and Java on the 
internet. Disable any features in MS Office, web 
browsers, and PDF viewers that are not needed, 
such as OLE. 
6. Important and changed data, software, and 
configuration settings need to be backed-up daily 
and stored off site and disconnected from the 
source network for at least 3 months. Restoration

should be tested at least annually and when the IT 
infrastructure changes. 
7. Use multi-factor authentication for VPNs, RDP, 
SSH, and other remote access, and for all users 
performing privileged actions or when accessing 
sensitive information. 
8. Microsoft Office macro settings should be 
configured to block macros from the internet, and 
only allow permitted macros from trusted locations 
or those with a trusted certificate, with limited 
write access [7][8]. 
D. NIST 800-53 and NISTIR 7621 for Small Business 
NIST 800-53 provides a comprehensive framework of 
guidelines for managing risks – from vulnerability 
identification and risk assessment through to identifying and 
implementing mitigative controls. NIST 800-53 divides the 
cyber security management into 5 phases: identify, protect, 
detect, respond and recover [19]. 
NISTIR 7621 for small business offers 25 mitigating 
cyber security controls. There is natural overlap between the 
NIST and the ASD essential 8 controls. Both NIST and 
ASD 
recommend 
patching 
operations 
systems 
and 
applications, whitelisting applications and controlling 
internet access, ensuring redundancy of systems and data by 
taking regular backups, limiting access to data, and 
controlling systems administration privileges. NISTIR 7621 
for small business also recommends: the use of both 
hardware and software firewalls between the organisation’s 
network and the internet; anti-virus and anti-spyware on 
every device that connects to the organisation’s network, 
encrypting data at rest and in transit. In addition, the NIST 
guideline extends beyond managing the technology to 
include mandatory data breach reporting requirements, for 
example. It also includes controls identified in the ISO 
27002 standard, such as restricting physical access to the 
workspace and data centre [15][16][19][23][26][27][30].  
 
III. 
PRACTICAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Proactive management of cyber security risks within an 
organisation is best achieved by combining aspects of the 
standards and guidelines discussed to establish an effective 
cyber security risk management process that identifies the 
cyber risks, evaluates the level of the risks for that 
organisation and implements an appropriate set of 
mitigating controls to reduce the residual risk to an 
acceptable level [21][29]. This can be achieved by 
combining appropriate aspects of the standards and 
guidelines discussed, within the context of the organisation 
under consideration.  
Risk management is a continuous process. The risk 
management plan is the basis for effectively identifying, 
managing, and monitoring its cyber security-related risks 
[21][29]. An organisation’s objective in performing risk 
management is to enable it to achieve its mission by: 
1. More effectively securing the IT systems that store, 
process, or transmit the company’s information; 
2. Providing the information needed to make well-
informed risk decisions that justify security-related 
IT expenditure; 
3. Facilitating 
and 
enabling 
accreditation, 
by 
providing supporting documentation as a result of 
this risk management plan [21][29].  
A. Cyber Security Risk Management Process Activities 
1) System characterisation and Scope determination 
Managing cyber risk needs to be done within the context 
of the organisation, its purpose, scope, and the environment 
in which it operates. The first step is to understand the 
business context by defining the mission and operational 
characteristics of the system: what the system does and how 
it operates in the organisation’s environment, and what is the 
scope and boundary of the risk management plan [21][29].  
2) Asset identification and analysis 
Within the agreed boundary and scope, identify critical 
and sensitive information assets and significant and critical 
systems and activities that need to be protected, and assess 
their value [6][21][29] in terms of: 
i. 
the functions they perform, as they relate to 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability; 
ii. 
the value to the business in terms of reputational 
damage and market-share loss if they were 
compromised;   
iii. 
their replacement value (if applicable); 
3) Threat identification and analysis  
Perform threat modelling to identify and evaluate 
relevant 
threats 
to 
confidentiality, 
integrity, 
and/or 
availability of these assets, or the information pertaining to 
these assets, by considering common, known threats, 
emerging threats, and threats that relate to the local 
environment. Threats may be natural events, or man-made: 
man-made threats can be intentional or accidental; and 
intentional threats can be external or internal. Intentional 
threats can be better understood by considering the potential 
motives driving these behaviours, ability to execute the 
attack, and opportunities available for the attackers to 
exploit vulnerabilities to execute these attacks. Commonly 
known potential threats include social engineering, 
phishing, hacking, and worms [18][21][24][25][29][31]-
[33]. 
 
4) Vulnerability identification and analysis 
Assess the vulnerabilities, or weaknesses in the 
protection measures for the assets identified that may be 
exploited by these threats, such as people clicking on links 
in phishing emails or malicious websites, downloading

22
malware infected files and software, out of date patching on 
operating systems and applications, and/or lack of 
whitelisting [21][29][30]. This is an ongoing exercise as 
new vulnerabilities are identified. Intelligence services can 
assist 
with 
providing 
updates 
on 
recent/current 
vulnerabilities and exploits. 
5) Risk identification 
Risks are identified where threats may exploit the 
vulnerabilities in these assets [21][29]. 
6) Risk analysis 
The level of risk is determined by the likelihood these 
vulnerabilities will be exploited by these threats, and the 
impact if this were to happen [21][29]: 
  
Level of Risk Exposure = Likelihood x Impact. 
 
Impact includes the estimated direct and indirect costs 
to the business, if this were to happen. The NIST Risk 
Analysis process provides a comprehensive model for risk 
analysis [27][29] as illustrated in Figure 1. The process 
starts with the threat source, their intent, and the likelihood 
they will initiate a threat event to attempt to exploit a 
vulnerability in the target organisation. The degree to which 
the attacker is successful in exploiting these vulnerabilities 
will depend on the effectiveness of the mitigative security 
controls. The residual risk is the combination of likelihood 
that the exploit will succeed and the degree of the adverse 
impact if it does.  
 
 
Figure 1.  NIST Risk Analysis Process  
7) Risk treatment 
Prioritise the risks based on business impact. Identify 
and evaluate countermeasures, or controls that can be applied 
to reduce the residual risk. Calculate the cost of these 
controls. The types of controls need to be appropriate for the 
criticality and sensitivity of the assets, the vulnerabilities and 
threats to these assets, where they are in the lifecycle, and the 
potential consequences of a security incident [6][15]-[17]. 
Controls are selected to: 
i. 
protect critical and sensitive information assets; 
ii. 
mitigate risks and avoid unnecessary operational, 
financial, and customer losses. 
iii. 
ensure compliance with regulatory and legislation 
requirements;  
iv. 
gain competitive edge. 
 
8) Monitoring Risk 
Following the implementation of the recommended 
controls, the organisation should monitor, measure and 
validate the effectiveness of controls and the extent to which 
they are meeting their objectives [15]-[17]. 
IV. 
RECOMMENDED CONTROLS 
These controls have been identified from the sources 
discussed 
[1]-[16][19][20][22][23][26]-[28][30]-[32] 
and 
tested in the Australian cyber landscape for their 
effectiveness in maintaining cyber security and resilience for 
a 
mid-sized 
Australian 
organisation 
with 
300-500 
employees. These controls apply in both physical (and 
virtual) data centres and cloud computing architectures, and 
can be implemented within a reasonable budget and 
timeframe.

A. Compliance 
As a result of effectively implementing this Risk 
Management Plan, with the recommended controls, the 
organisation will satisfy the requirements for: 
• 
ASD Security certification and accreditation; 
• 
ISO 27001, and ISO 27002 compliance;

V. 
CONCLUSION 
Defence in depth can be an expensive process. It is 
critical for businesses of all sizes to focus on the real risks 
that may impact their sensitive and critical data, and to 
mitigate these in priority order. An effective Risk 
Management Plan provides a robust framework within which 
to manage cyber security and cyber resilience. There are 
many sources of truth when it comes to identifying the right 
controls for a particular organisation. Taking a structured 
risk-based approach, based on the information available from 
NIST, ISO, and ASD will enable an organisation to balance 
IT security expenditure with business outcomes, and assure 
the company’s survivability in the face of increasing cyber 
security concerns.
