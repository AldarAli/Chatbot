Abstract—The 
IEEE 
802.11p 
standard 
uses 
Enhanced 
Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism for the 
contention-based prioritized Quality of Service (QoS) at the 
Media Access Control (MAC) layer. The IEEE 802.11p is MAC 
and physical (PHY) layer standard for Vehicle Ad Hoc Networks 
(VANETs), which uses the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access 
Function (EDCAF) to support contention-based prioritized QoS 
in the MAC layer. VANET aims to provide users with a better, 
safer and more coordinated approach to their destination.  This 
paper provides an analytical model to compute the performance 
of the IEEE 802.11p EDCAF for Vehicular Network based on 
packet size. 
Keywords—IEEE 802.11p; EDCA; performance analysis; VANET

INTRODUCTION
An Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is an advanced 
application, which intelligence as such, aims to provide 
innovative services relating to different modes of transport, 
traffic management. ITS allows users to be better informed and 
use safer, more coordinated and smarter transport networks [1].  
 ITS is working to increase road safety and to provide on-
site information services to improve transport efficiency. For 
these applications, the vehicles can be equipped with sensors 
and communication devices to form a network called the 
Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET).  
The IEEE 802.11p standard [2] known as Wireless Access 
in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) is specially developed to 
adapt VANETs requirements and supports ITS. The 
performance of WAVE physical layer is one of the important 
factors that play a great role in the communication process [3]. 
The IEEE 802.11p uses an Enhanced Distributed Channel 
Access (EDCA) mechanism, which is designed for the 
contention-based prioritized Quality of Service (QoS) support 
at the MAC layer. The IEEE 802.11p EDCA mechanism 
defines four access categories (ACs); AC_VO (Voice), AC_VI 
(Video), AC_BE (Best effort) and AC_BG (Back ground). The 
priority among ACs is set by different EDCA parameters. An 
enhanced distributed channel access function (EDCAF) is used 
for each AC queue at the MAC sublayer to contend for 
transmission opportunities using its own EDCA parameters. 
EDCA parameters include the minimum contention window 
(CWmin), 
maximum 
contention 
window 
(CWmax) 
and 
Arbitration Interframe Space Number (AIFSN).  
Recently performance modeling of the IEEE 802.11p 
EDCA mechanism has been studied in [1]. In this paper, the 
performance model was developed considering all important 
factors that may affect the performance of the IEEE 802.11p 
EDCA mechanism for different ACs. In these calculations, the 
effect of the package size on performance and delay has been 
examined.  Strong approximations are avoided to ensure the 
accuracy of the model. Markov Chain modeling based 
theoretical analysis is presented where the relationship between 
EDCA parameters and EDCA performance metrics are shown. 
Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the accuracy of 
the analytical model. Simulations were done using MATLAB. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the analytical model and performance analysis. 
Section III presents the simulation results. Section IV 
concludes the paper. 
II. ANALYTICAL MODEL AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The 802.11 standard defines EDCA as a mechanism by 
which one class of frames can be given priority over another 
in their competition to access the medium. The relationship 
between EDCA parameters and performance metrics are also 
established for all AC queues. Based on Markov model, the 
performance of the IEEE 802.11p EDCA mechanism for all 
ACs is derived. According to the package size changes, 
throughput and delay analysis were performed 
A. Overview of the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access 
The EDCA is a channel access mechanism designed for 
the contention-based prioritized QoS support at the MAC 
layer.  The EDCA mechanism defines four ACs. The four ACs 
have four priorities, including CWmin, CWmax and AIFSN. The 
contention window parameters are shown in Table I. 
TABLE I. DEFAULT EDCA PARAMETER FOR DIFFERENT ACS 
Each AC queue uses different AIFS, CWmin and CWmax. 
Prioritization of transmission in EDCA is implemented by a 
new Inter-Frame Space (IFS), namely, Arbitration Inter-Frame 
Space (AIFS). The duration of AIFS for each AC is derived 
from the value of AIFSN of that AC. SIFS is the duration of 
52

the short inter-frame space and Tslot is the duration of a slot 
time [4]. AIFSN can be expressed as follows 
AIFS [AC] = AIFSN [AC] × Tslot + SIFS       
 (1) 
Prioritization mechanism is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1.
Demonstration of EDCA Mechanism 
The EDCA mechanism relies on the Carrier Sense 
Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) technique 
to contend and access channel, which a station must probe the 
channel before transmission to determine whether it is busy or 
idle. If only one AC queue has backlogged data at a time in a 
station, and the station will sense the channel idle for the 
duration of AIFS[AC] before attempting to transmit it. If the 
channel is sensed as busy, then the station defers its 
transmission of an additional back-off interval. The back-off 
interval is calculated as a random number of slot times 
uniformly selected from [0, CW[AC]]. At the first 
transmission attempt, the back-off interval for an AC in 
EDCA is randomly selected from [0, CWmin[AC]], and it is 
doubled at every retransmission with an upper limit equal to 
CWmax[AC]. The smaller is AIFS[AC] or CWmin[AC], the 
higher is the priority in channel access. If the channel is 
sensed idle in a slot, the back-off counter will be decremented 
by 1. The packet will be transmitted when the back-off counter 
becomes 0. For priority reasons, EDCA mechanism employs a 
separate time for back-off. Therefore, an internal collision 
occurs inside a station, also called virtual collision. If an 
internal collision occurs, the station will grant the transmission 
to the AC queue with the highest priority. In the meantime, the 
AC queue with lower priorities will start to back-off and then 
the packet will be transmitted. 
B. Markov Model Analysis 
A Markov 
chain is 
a stochastic 
model describing 
a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each 
event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. 
The Markov chain describes the withdrawal procedure of any 
AC. In this Markov chain, k is the value of a back-off counter. 
The value of k is initially set to from 0 [0, W−1] and is 
decremented by 1 if the channel is sensed idle in a slot, frozen 
at the current value when the channel sensed busy. The packet 
will be transmitted when k becomes zero[7]. Tslot is the slot 
time size. Pc and Pb is the collision probability and channel 
busy probability in a slot. Figure 2 shows the Markov chain 
model 
Figure 2.
Back-off Process via Markov Chain Model 
The back-off time is decremented by 1 when the channel is 
sensed idle, the calculation is specified in Equation (2). The 
back-off time is frozen at the current value when the channel 
is sensed busy, is specified in Equation (3). The packet will be 
transmitted when the back-off counter becomes 0, is specified 
in Equation (4).

The solutions can be obtained from the Markov chain. b(t) 
be the stochastic process representing the back-off counter for 
a given vehicle at timeslot t. b(t)∊(0,W0 1). The Markov chain 
is constructed to describe the back-off procedure of an AC [7]. 
As the sum of all possible states equal to one, so following 
relations can be derived

where Lh is the MAC layer and physical layer header 
lengths, L is the packet size, Rd is the system data transmission 
rate and Tdelay is the propagation delay. 
C. Throughput Analysis

information payload transmitted in a slot time over the average 
duration of a slot time

For all transmission protocols with CSMA base, the 
throughput variation equation based on the offered traffic load 
of the environment can be expressed as follows

where G offered traffic load, T packet transmission time, ߬

cell is typically characterized by average number of mobile 
stations requesting the service and average length of time the 
mobile stations requiring the service [8]. The offered traffic 
load ∝ is normalized time unit and can be expressed as ∝ =

ܧ[ܦ௔௖௖௘௦௦] =ܧ[ܶ௪]ܲ௖(1 − ܲ௖) +ܧ[ܶ௪]ܲ௖  (18) 
There are two events may occur, either the packet will be 
transmitted successfully if a collision occurs and no collision 
occurs, or the packet is dropped due to collision.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In previous sections, the performance of the IEEE 802.11p 
EDCAF and the verification of the theoretical analysis were 
calculated. The simulations are conducted in MATLAB. The 
data packets arrive at each AC queue following the mean of the 
process is 0.5 Mbps. The simulation model includes MAC 
behavior of IEEE 802.11p in vehicular networks. In this 
simulation, the number of vehicles is fixed and is calculated as 
10. Packet arrival probability is defined as vector. Pfdrop is 
fixed and calculated as 0.03. Table II provides the parameters 
value used in the simulation.

TABLE II. VALUE OF PARAMETER USED IN SIMULATION 
Figure 3 shows throughput versus packet arrival 
probability when the packet size (L) is 512 bytes. The scenario 
was simulated with the average packet length planned to be 
used in vehicle-2-vehicle communication. The packet size can 
contain at least 64 bytes with the header and at most 1518 
bytes in the 802.11 standards. Figure 4 and Figure 5 show 
throughput versus packet arrival probability when the packet 
size (L) is 64 bytes and 1500 bytes respectively. Figure 3, 
Figure 4 and Figure 5 shows that the increase of length of the 
packet size affects the throughput in the right direction. So 
using largest packet is more efficient. Figure 6 shows the 
average access delay versus packet arrival probability when 
the packet size is 64 bytes. Figure 8 shows the average access 
delay versus packet arrival probability when the packet size is 
1518 bytes. According to the Figure 6 and Figure 8, AC [0] 
provides minimum latency while the packet arrival probability 
increases. In the calculations, AC [2] and AC [3] values are 
very close to each other. But we can see that if we use  AC [2] 
and AC [3], we should try to send packages with minimum 
size. Figure 9 shows the throughput change graph depending 
on the offered load if 10 vehicles in the environment request 
are generated during a minute when ߬ = 0.1.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a simple analytical model to compute the 
performance of the IEEE 802.11p EDCAF for vehicular 
network is presented. The performance model is derived based 
on Markov chain. The Markov model calculates all important 
factors that can affect the access performance of the IEEE 
802.11p EDCA mechanism for each AC, such as the CW, 
AIFS and internal collisions. Equation (9), Equation (10), 
Equation (15) and Equation (18) shows the relationship among 
the EDCA parameters and performance matric considering 
transmission probability, collision probability, throughput and 
delay. Simulation results show that the packet size change 
affects throughput proportionally. Given the declining 
throughput because of increased traffic intensity, AC [0] 
should be preferred up to a certain density for critical 
messages. With increasing offered load, channel preference 
can shift to AC [1].
