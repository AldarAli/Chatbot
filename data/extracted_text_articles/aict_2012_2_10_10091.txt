Abstract—Currently, increasing number of devices are con-
nected to networks. Hence, M2M (Machine to Machine) com-
munication, especially LTE/LTE-Advanced based M2M com-
munication, is attracting more and more interests from the
telecommunication industry. However, as the current LTE (Long
Term evolution) system is designed for Human to Human system,
it may be unable to support the massive M2M devices. This paper
proposes a fast retrial and dynamic random access algorithm
for LTE-Advanced network. It drastically reduces the delay of
access comparing the back-off algorithm. In the meantime, it
successfully prevents the system from severe congestion, which is
inevitable in back-off algorithm when the arrival rate of random
access is very high. To make the dynamic control of random
access feasible in practical scenario, an estimation algorithm of
the access arrival rate is also proposed in this paper. Simulation
results reveal that the algorithm is able to provide better delay
performance and greater throughput comparing with the back-
off schemes deﬁned in the LTE network.

I. INTRODUCTION
M2M (machine to machine) communication is considered to
be a new killer application for the next generation communica-
tion system, such as LTE-Advanced network. However, current
communication systems are designed for Human to Human
communication, while M2M applications are characterized by
some unique features such as massive nodes, extremely high
frequency of accessing [1], [2] and so on. Hence, in order to
better support M2M applications, it is necessary to introduce
some speciﬁc optimization for M2M communication to the
LTE-Advanced system. One of the most important issue is
designing an effective medium access scheme to handle the
high frequency of access of the massive MTC (machine-type
communications) devices.
Random access is popular for medium access control. More-
over, time slotted random access is adopted in 2G (2rd Gener-
ation), 3G (3rd Generation) and LTE (Long Term Evolution)
for initiating uplink access because of its channel efﬁciency
in licensed channels [3]. Back-off algorithm has been adopted
in LTE to alleviate grave congestion following random access
collision. Sharma et al. [4] studied the performance of back-
off based random access in IEEE 802.11 DCF. Nevertheless,
Back-off scheme brings about great time delay and fails to
deal with circumstances with extremely high arrival rate of
accesses, especially when there are massive nodes. Aldous et
al. [5] evaluated the ultimate instability of exponential back-off
protocol with transmission control for random access. Rivest
et al. [6] and Hauksson et al. [7] proposed algorithms adopting
other dynamic medium access control methods to improve
the delay and loss performance of the system. However,
they can only be used in single channel. Choi et al. [8]
proposed a multichannel random access with fast retrial. It can
successfully limit the time delay in random access. However, it
is unable to sustain stable even when the arrival rate of access
is not very high.
In this paper, a fast retrial and dynamic access control algo-
rithm is proposed to deal with the congestion in multichannel
random access under extremely high arrival rate of access.
It is able to achieve a comparatively low delay, in addition
to effectively utilizing the channels. Furthermore, it works
well even when the arrival rate of access is higher than the
limitation of time slotted aloha scheme e−1 [9].
The paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces
the system model, and describes the proposed algorithm in
detail. In Section III, the algorithm’s performance is analyzed.
Section IV shows simulation results. Finally, the paper is
concluded in section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND OPTIMIZED ALGORITHM
A. Uplink random access
Consider that in a LTE-Advance system, there are numerous
MTC nodes. Each node needs to conduct a contention-based
random access procedure to obtain an uplink channel. The
physical resource of random access in LTE-Advance includes
preambles and random access opportunities. In LTE-Advance,
each cell is allocated with 64 preambles, and some pream-
bles are assigned to non-contention-based random access. For
cells below 1.5km radii, all 64 preambles are orthogonal to
each other as they are derived from single root Zadoff-Chu
sequence. In larger cells, though 64 preambles are not perfectly
orthogonal to each other as they are derived from multiple
root sequences, the cross-correlation is low [10]. Hence, we
assume that all preamble are orthogonal to each other and
one preamble is denoted as a logical channel in this paper.
According to the current LTE-Advance network deﬁnition,
time slotted aloha is adopted in random access. In which each
node can send a random access request in the dedicated time
slot (random access opportunity).

Assuming that there are N orthogonal preambles, that is,
there are N parallel logical channels (mentioned as channels
in this paper) in one random access opportunity (mentioned
as slot). In each slot, if more than one MTC nodes have sent
the same preamble, a collision will happen. Fig. 1 illustrates a
abstract system with 4 logical channels and 3 random accesses
in the ﬁrst slot.
The contention-based random access procedure in LTE-
Advance is outlined in Fig. 2, and it is further described below.
Readers can get more information about the contention-based
random access from [3], [11].
1) Random access preamble. Each ue randomly select a
preamble from the contention-based-group and transmit
it in a nearby random access opportunity.
2) Random access response. The eNodeB correlates all pos-
sible preambles in each random access opportunity with
the received preamble. With the detected preambles, the
eNodeB assigns uplink resources related MTC nodes
and broadcasts the the information.
3) Scheduled Transmission. MTC nodes transmits unique
identity with the allocated uplink resource.
4) Contention resolution. In step 3, more than one MTC
nodes which had sent the same preamble may response.
In this case, the eNodeB is unable to decode the iden-
tities from these nodes. So these nodes will not receive
the notiﬁcation of the reception step 3 in the dedicated
time window, and they will go to step 1.
In the back-off algorithm of current LTE, before conducting
step 1, each node needs to wait for a randomly determined
number of slots (back-off time). Where the back-off time
follows Uniform distribution on [0, maximum back-off slot].
If the random access procedure is unsuccessful after maximum
retrial times of step 1, the random access will be abandoned.

Proposed algorithm
In the proposed algorithm, MTC nodes which have suf-
fered from collision will send a preamble immediately in the
next random access opportunity. Before every random access
opportunity, the eNodeB broadcasts an access rate. For all
MTC nodes that need to conduct a random access, they send
a preamble at a rate of α. The parameter α is dynamically
determined by the eNodeB and timely broadcasted by it. If
a MTC node is about to send a access request, it randomly
choose one channel from all channels with equal possibility.
If a collision happens, it will retry in the next slot with a
randomly chosen channel. The ﬂow diagram of the proposed
algorithm (ﬁrst random access requests) is shown in Fig. 2:

C. The determination of α and Fsta
According to the ﬂow diagram of the algorithm, each MTC
node needs to receive α and Fsta from the eNodeB before
each slot.
Proposition 1: Assuming that the combined arrivals in a
time slot follow Poisson distribution with a mean λ′. There
are M retrials and N logical channel(N > 1, 0 ≤ M < N).
In the proposed algorithm, the optimal α follows:
α = max(0, min((N − M − 1)
N
(N − 1)λ′ , 1))
(1)

Proof: Without loss of generality, in the ith, (i
=
1, 2, 3 · · · N) channel, the combined arrivals follow Poisson
with mean λ′
N . The retrial accesses nr
i , and combined arrivals
nc
i in the ith channel follow the following distribution:
P(nr
i = k) = Ck
M( 1
N )k(N − 1

)M−k, k = 1, 2, · · · M
(2)
P(nc
i = j) = ( αλ′
N )j

e− αλ′
N , 0 < α ≤ 1
(3)
The accessing in the i(th) channel will succeed if, in the
same slot, the channel is only used by one MTC device. Hence,
the possibility of success random access in the i(th) channel
pi,ac follows:
pi,ac = P(nr
i + nc
i = 1)
= P(nr
i = 0, nc
i = 1) + P(nr
i = 1, nc
i = 0)
= C1
M( 1
N )( N−1
N )M−1 · e− αλ′
N + C0
M( N−1
N )M · αλ′
N e− αλ′
N
(4)
pi,ac achieves the maximum value when α is determined as
equation (1).
Without loss of generality, it can be applied to other chan-
nels. Hence, in the proposed algorithm, equation (1) denotes
the optimal α of the system.
■
Therefore, the eNodeB can determine the optimized α with
λ′ and M. The estimating of these two parameters is presented
as follow:
Estimation of the new arrival rate λ: When the system
is stable, the leaving rate(throughput) of the system equals
to the arrival rate of new access. Hence, we can reach an
reliable estimation of the arrival rate of new accesses λ with
the leaving rate of the system. Denote Fk as the number of
successful accesses in kth slot. We have:
˜λk =







L
P
i=1
Fk−i
L
k − L > j
k−1
P
i=j
Fi
k−j
k − L ≤ j
(5)
where j − 1 is nearest slot that is considered unstable.
When the arrival rate of random access λ is beyond the
maximum throughput, the system must be unstable. Hence,
we have to ﬁnd another reliable method to estimate the λ.
Furthermore, in this circumstance, it is meaningless to
backlog the access that has not been sent when it arrives,
because it is impossible to handle all random access in this
condition. So any arrived access will be sent immediately in
the nearby slot or be abandoned. Hence, we have λ ≡ λ′.
The unused possibility of a channel follows:
puu = P(nr
i + nc
i = 0) = C0
M(N − 1
N
)M · e− αλ
N
(6)
So, we have
λ = −N
α ln(puu · (
N
N − 1)M)
(7)
We can estimate the arrival rate of random access with:
λk = −N
α ln(˜puu,k · (
N
N − 1)
˜
Mk
)
(8)
where ˜puu,k
=

k − L ≤ j′
, and j′ − 1 is the nearest slot that
is considered stable.
Estimation of the number of retrial random access M:
We assume that the eNodeB is able to detect all collisions
in step 3, and the retrial slot of the corresponding nodes
can be determined with the contention resolution window
W. However, it is impossible for the eNodeB to identify
the number of accesses in a collided channel. Hence, it is
necessary to propose a reliable method to estimate it. Assume
that S scheduled transmission have been send during the kth
slot, we have:
pnc =

1
s = 0, 1
C0
S( N−1
N )S + C1
S
1
N ( N−1
N )S−1
s > 1
(9)
We estimate the possibility of no collision happens in certain
channel with
˜Pnc = naccept/N
(10)
We have:
˜
M = ˜S − nac
(11)
Finally, in the (K + W)th slot, ˜S can be calculated with
˜Pnc by looking-up a table established according to equation
(9), as there is no analytical solution for equation(9), and (9)
is a monotone function about S.
Evaluating the combined arrivals λ′: The parameter α is
dynamically adjusted in each slot. If we denote λ′
k as the
combined arrivals in kth slot, we have:
λ′
k =



λ′
k−1(1 − αk−1) + λk
Fsta,k = 1, k > 1
λk
Fsta,k = 0, k > 1
0
k = 1
(12)
The determination of Fsta: When λ is higher than the
maximum throughput, estimating λ with the leaving rate must
result in deviation of the estimation. Hence, it is necessary to
identify the unstable state in time. In this paper, we use the
non-collision rate of all channels as the indicator. Besides,
to limit the delay of succeeded access, the system is also
considered to be unstable when α < α0 in this paper.
Assume that S accesses have been sent in kth slot, the
Maximum throughput of the system can be reached when S =
1/ ln(
N
N−1). In this circumstance, the non-collision rate of the
channels follows:

nc = C0
S( N−1

If in the (k−1)th slot, the system is considered to be stable,
in the (k)th slot, the system state is determined as follow:
Fsta,k =

0
˜P < P ′
nc, or αk − 1 < α0

otherwise
(14)
where ˜P =
L
P
i=1
nnc,k−i

When the system is considered to be unstable and the new
arrival rate λ becomes small enough to make the system
considered stable, it is necessary to shift the system state from
unstable to stable in time. Denote α =
i=L
P
i=1
αk−i
L
. If the system
is considered to be unstable in (k − 1)th slot, the state of the
system in kth is determined as follow:
Fsta,k =
 1
α < 1
0
otherwise
(15)
Besides, Fsta,1 is set to be 0.
III. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
According to the results of proposition 1, the system
achieves the maximum throughput when
αλ′ = (N − M − 1)
N
(N − 1), (N > 1, 0 ≤ M < N)
(16)
So, the maximum throughput of the system can be denoted
by:
P(nr
i + nc
i = 1)
= C1
M( 1
N )( N−1
N )M−1 · e− αλ′
N + C0
M( N−1

(N−1)e− 1
N (N−M−1)
N
(N−1)
= (1 − 1
N )M · e− N−M−1
N−1
(17)
when N > 1, 0 ≤ M < N, we have:
e−1 ≤ (1 − 1
N )M · e− N−M−1
N−1
≤ 1
2
(18)
Hence, the Maximum throughput per slot of the system is:
N · (e−1 + δ), 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1
2 − e−1
(19)
The performance of the system is evaluated separately
according to whether the system is considered to be stable.
When the system is considered to be stable, the possibility
of successful random access follows:
pac = P(nr + nf = 1) ∗ N/(M + αλ′)
(20)
where α is determined by equation (1), and αλ′ ≤ (N −M −
1)
N
(N−1), for α may be smaller than 1 when λ′ is very low.
Hence, we have:
paccept = P(nr + nf = 1) ∗ N/(M + αλ′)
= N(C1
M( 1
N )( N−1
N

N(N − 1/N )Me
− N−M−1
N−1
N+M−MN/N − 1
≥ 1/e
(21)
When the system is stable, all accesses would retry until
they are successfully accepted by the eNodeB. Hence, we have
psuccess = 1, and the throughput equals to arrival rate λ.
When the system is considered unstable, we have λ = λ′.
With the results of proposition1, the system can achieve the
maximum throughput with α = (N − M − 1)
N
(N−1)λ′ .
Therefore, the throughput of the system follows N · (e−1 +
δ), 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1
2 − e−1.
The success rate of access follows:

IV. SIMULATIONS
In this section, we use Matlab-based simulation to compare
the proposed algorithm with back-off schedule, which is
adopted in the current LTE system.
Simulation parameters are shown in table 1. The new arrival
rate of new random access has already been normalized. That
is, λ denotes the mean number of new random access per
channel per slot.

We compare the two algorithms with the following indices:
Average delay:

Throughput:
The mean successful access in a slot
Success ratio:
the ratio of accesses that can ﬁnally successfully

Fig. 3 shows that the proposed algorithm has a much better
delay performance than the back-off algorithm. Fig. 4 shows
that the throughput of the proposed algorithm keeps stable
when λ is higher than 1/e. But the throughput in back-off
algorithm decreases rapidly when λ is higher than 1/e. After
all, the system fail to keep stable when the arrival rate is
higher than the Maximum throughput of the slotted aloha.
It is shown that the maximum throughput of the proposed
algorithm is higher than that of time slotted Aloha with
Poisson arrivals, which is 16/e with 16 channels. Besides, the
line N/e corresponds to the maximum throughput of slotted
aloha with N channels. It is because that, in the proposed
algorithm, the number of accesses in each slot no longer

V. CONCLUSION
Through dynamic control of the contention-based random
access, and the fast retrial of collided accesses depends on the
reliable estimation methods, the proposed algorithm is able to
guarantee the reliability of the system under extremely high
rate of access, as shown in analysis and simulations. Besides,
the maximum utilization of the channel is close to or even
above the extreme utilization of time slotted Aloha system
with Poisson arrivals. Moreover, the delay of random access is
limited. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm can well serve
the M2M applications in LTE-Advance, which are featured by
extremely high rate of accesses.
