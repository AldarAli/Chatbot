 INTRODUCTION  
The Internet protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a 
framework that specified for the third generation (3G) 
mobile networks, to provide Internet Protocol (IP) 
telecommunication services. The IMS standard was specified 
by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in the 
specification Release 5 [1] and Release 6 [2]. The standard 
supports multiple access types, e.g., Global System for 
Mobile (GSM), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access 
(WCDMA), CDMA2000, or IEEE802.11 Wireless Fidelity 
(WiFi) [3]. 
The present active standard describes the IMS 
functionalities for classical wireless network coverage such 
as macrocell and microcell. As a new emerging wireless 
network 
which 
has 
a 
very 
small 
coverage, 
the 
standardization for femtocell is still under development.   
In a femtocell network, the Femto Access Point (FAP) is 
defined as a small cellular base station designed to be used in 
the house, residential or in the office. The FAP allows 
service providers to improve indoor coverage mainly where 
access is limited or even unavailable. In the 3GPP 
terminology, the FAP is called as Home Node B (HNB) [4]. 
Though the IMS can accommodate current and future 
services in wired and wireless networks, however, the IMS-
femtocell interoperability is still a challenging issue.  
In the IMS network, the communication between the 
IMS core network (IMS-CN) and its clients is performed on 
the basis of request/response signalling messages. At the first 
step, client sends a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) message 
specific for the given request when requiring a service from 
the IMS-CN. The IMS-CN responds by sending the 
particular SIP message with regard to the received request.   
The SIP is used as a signalling protocol in the IMS 
environment. It is defined in RFC 3261 [5] which have 
functionalities on registration, session establishment, session 
management and participant invocation (including creating, 
modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more 
participants). SIP signalling is the primary method for user 
registration and session control in the IMS architecture [6]. 
The Call Session Control Function (CSCF) is the core 
signalling server in the IMS networks architecture. It acts as 
both a SIP Registrar and a SIP proxy server [7].  
Many research and scientific works consider either 
femtocell or IMS, but none of them concern on the 
interworking between IMS and femtocell. Accordingly, this 
paper is concern with this issue. The main focus is to 
investigate the effective and efficient IMS’ SIP signalling 
mechanism when it works on femtocell environment. The 
all-IP connection integration between IMS-CN and FAP is 
described. In addition, another critical issue such as the delay 
properties of session establishment signalling of source and 
correspondent nodes is also taken into account. The IMS 
clients in femtocell environment are based on the 3GPP 
LTE. 
The paper is organized as follow. Section II summarizes 
the related work regarding IMS and femtocell environment. 
Section III describes the integration architecture between 
IMS and FAP. Some literatures and technical aspects in IMS 
are portrayed, as well as the LTE-based femtocell. Section 
IV explains the proposed IMS signalling mechanism in 
femtocell network. The new messages flow is also depicted. 
End-to-end delay in the proposed messages flow is studied. 
Finally, Section V concludes our paper.

RELATED WORK 
There are many published papers exposing the femtocells 
in terms of increasing the network capacity, saving energy, 
supporting high-speed data rate, and providing benefits from 
the social and economic side. Authors in reference [8] 
simulated the deployment of femtocells in residential 
scenario to study their effects on the service experienced by 
users connected to a macrocell. They found out no 
significant impact on the dropped call rate when auto-
configuration is deployed in the femtocells. In [9], 
Chandrasekhar and Andrews addressed the reduced cost by 
deploying macrocell and femtocell users in a shared region 
of spectrum. They proposed a link quality protection 
algorithm to progressively reduce the target Signal-to-

Interference Noise Ratio (SINR). This two-tier distributed 
power control algorithm ensured minimal network overhead 
on femtocells. In addition to energy saving and coverage 
issues, Claussen et al. [10] proposed the mobility event 
based self-optimization and coverage adaptation method for 
femtocell deployment. As the result, the total number of 
mobility events caused by femtocells deployment is 
significantly reduced. Moreover, the femtocell’s indoor 
coverage is improved as well. Other technical and business 
advantages of femtocell deployment as well as the 
technology state-of-the-art and its challenges have been 
overviewed and described in [11].  Generally, those papers 
discuss 
benefits 
and 
technical 
issues 
of 
femtocell 
deployment, however very few papers address the 
integration of femtocells into IMS architecture. 
In addition to IMS research and technological 
development, several works have been addressed, mostly in 
terms of system performances of session establishment 
procedure. The works in [12] and [13] provided the SIP-
based IMS signalling delay for IMS session establishment 
procedure. In [12], A. Munir analyzed the end-to-end delay 
where both source node and correspondent node are the 
combination of 3G/UMTS and WiMAX networks. The 
signalling delay is analyzed separately as transmission, 
processing and queue delays. However, the paper only shows 
the delay as a whole. It was not described which delay part 
that contributed the most significant delay.  
More comprehensive analysis of session establishment 
procedure was carried out in [13] where the delay properties 
in each delay entities were investigated. The structure of 
session establishment signalling that is based on the standard 
was presented. The authors also examined which delay 
among the transmission, processing and queuing delays that 
contributes the most significant delay in the system.  
The optimization of SIP session setup delay for voice 
over IP (VoIP) service in 3G wireless networks is studied in 
[14]. The authors evaluated SIP session setup performances 
with various underlying protocols transport control protocol 
(TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP), radio link protocols 
(RLPs)) as a function of the frame error rate (FER). The 
adaptive retransmission timer is proposed to optimizing the 
delay. In addition [15], the analysis of SIP-based mobility 
management in 4G wireless network was carried out. Despite 
they were not concern on session establishment procedure, 
but some delay issues, particularly the delay on radio link 
protocol (RLP) and non-RLP have been carried out.  
The optimization of efficient route for femtocell-based all 
IP networks is carried out in [16]. The Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP) signalling routes and packet route of FAP 
resided in IP domain was compared with the FAP connected 
to IMS-CN through a Radio Access Network. For this 
purpose, the authors created the testbed for each FAP 
scenario. The end-to-end system delays were measured and 
reported. 
III. 
THE OVERVIEW OF IMS – FEMTOCELL INTEGRATION 
A. The Operational Concepts of IMS  
The IMS is not about services, but the concept providing 
access to all services regardless of the media type. It uses a 
common control architecture that works well for all media. 
Functionalities that are required for supporting multimedia 
real time services, such as service creation, registration, 
invocation and execution are incorporated in the service 
architecture of IMS. Among these entities, IMS contains 
multiple SIP proxies called Call Session Control Functions 
(CSCFs) with following roles:  
 
Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) which is the first contact 
point in IMS and interacts with GGSN (Gateway 
GPRS Support Node), i.e., the access point from 
UMTS to external networks, for policy control and 
resources allocation.  
 
Interrogating-CSCF (I-CSCF) which acts as a SIP 
Registrar and is responsible for routing sessions to 
appropriate Serving-CSCF (S-CSCF).  
 
S-CSCF which performs session control and service 
trigger. 
The IMS provides an efficient service provisioning 
capability compare to circuit-switched (CS) and packet-
switched (PS) networks. When a client registers into IMS 
network, a Subscriber Service Profile (SSP) is downloaded 
by the S-CSCF from the HSS.  
The SSP contains service-related information and 
identifies the services that need to be provisioned. If multiple 
services need to be implemented, it determines the order in 
which they are provisioned. The SSP also includes the 
address of the servers that must execute the subscriber’s 
request. This approach allows IMS to serve as a re-usable 
service infrastructure by letting providers control and 
manage the complexities involved in service filtering, 
triggering, and interaction.

Both PS and CS networks can be integrated into a single 
session by the network operator, accordingly, users can add 
multimedia services to existing services in real time. Fig. 1 
represents how IMS logical function interacts to support a 
few sample applications. 
B. Femtocell Network 
1) LTE-based Femtocell 
Based on 3GPP specification [17] the LTE-based FAP 
(HNB) provides the Radio Access Network (RAN) 
connectivity using Iuh interface, support the macrocell 
NodeB and most of the Radio Network Controller (RNC) 
functions, FAP authentication, Femto-Gateway (F-GW), 
FAP registration and Femto User Equipment (F-UE) 
registration over Iuh. Furthermore, the F-GW serves the 
purpose of a RNC and present to the mobile CN as a 
concentrator of FAP connections that provides concentration 
function for the control plane and user plane. Logical 
architecture of LTE-based FAP can be seen in Fig. 2. 
 
 
2) LTE Advanced-based Femtocell 
Additionally, in the basis of LTE-A [17],  the evolved 
RAN (or Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access 
Network/E-UTRAN) is the key element since it provides all 
system functionalities included the Physical (PHY), Medium 
Access Control (MAC), Radio Link Control (RLC), and 
Packet Data Control Protocol (PDCP) [18]. It consists a 
single node, i.e., evolved Node B (eNodeB) or Home 
evolved Node B (HeNB)/FAP. It also provides radio 
resource control (RRC) functionality that corresponds to 
handover procedure. 
E-UTRAN interacts with the Evolve Packet Core (EPC) 
system that consist the Mobility Management Entity (MME), 
Serving Gateway (SGW) and F-GW. The interaction 
between all functional elements of EUTRAN and EPC is 
depicted in Fig. 3. 
The FAP supports the same functions as those supported 
by an eNodeB. The procedures between FAP and EPC run as 
same as those between macrocell eNodeB and the EPC. The 
F-GW serves as a concentrator for the control-plane, 
specifically the S1-MME interface. The F-GW may 
optionally terminate the user-plane towards the FAP and 
towards the SGW. Moreover, the F-GW provides a relay  
 
function for relaying user plane data between the HeNB and 
the SGW.  
In addition, 3GPP also specified two standard interfaces, 
i.e., X2 and S1 interface, for the Evolved Packet System 
(EPS). The X2 interface provides capability to support radio 
interface mobility and shall support the exchange of 
signalling 
information 
between 
eNodeB 
macrocells. 
Therefore, for handover between eNodeB macrocells, the 
procedure 
is 
performed 
without 
EPC 
involvement. 
Preparation and exchange of signalling flows in the handover 
procedure are directly between eNodeB using X2 interface. 
On the other hand, the S1 interface supports many-to-many 
relations between EPC’s elements (MME/SGW) and 
eNodeB. Moreover S1 is also used for the communication 
between FAP/HeNodeB with the MME/SGW through the F-
GW. Specifically, the connection to MME is using S1 
control plane (S1-C) interface and the connection to SGW is 
using S1 user plane (S1-U) interface. 
C.  SIP/IMS-based Integration 
Introducing the femtocells obviously extends the wireless 
access directly into the homes. However, how to integrate 
thousands of FAPs with the existing mobile infrastructure is 
still challenged. There are several different ways of 
achieving this integration. In December 2007, Femto Forum 
proposed thirteen different network architectures [19] for the 
integration 
of 
femtocell 
with 
existing 
network 
infrastructures. Those proposals can be classified into three 
categories, i.e., cellular-based integration, SIP/IMS-based 
integration, and Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA)-based 
integration.  In this paper, the SIP/IMS-based integration has 
been considered to analyse the IMS signalling. The 
architecture of integrated system is depicted in Fig. 4. 
In this architecture, the FAPs integrated directly with the 
IMS 
core 
through 
all-IP 
connectivity. 
Alternative 
architecture under this category includes softswitch-based 
implementations where the FAPs are integrated to a 
softswitch via SIP interface.

Figure 4.   IMS-Femtocell integrated system architecture 
 
 
This architecture leverages a SIP based VoIP network for 
cost-effective delivery since it is interworking with a cellular 
core to extend legacy circuit switched services. The signals 
(2G/3G) from legacy mobile stations (MSs) are converted 
into appropriate SIP messages over IP by FAP. Afterwards, 
they are interfaced to a SIP-MSC inter-working function 
(IWF) which connects to IMS-CN through internet. 
Integrating femtocells directly with the IMS core offers 
definite advantages [20], i.e., there is no scalability issue 
since the mobile core network is completely offloaded, and 
the requirements for upgrading the mobile core network 
infrastucture can be avoided as the FAP has the functionality 
of Radio Access Network (RAN), it can scale the traffic. 
Traffic latency challenges are mitigated as the number of 
hops is minimal. In addition, the use of all-IP in the core 
network significantly reduces the operational expenditures 
for carriers.  
Nevertheless, the SIP/IMS integration seems has some 
limitations, i.e., the lack of standards-based support for 
security, mobility, and supplementary services. The security 
procedures need to be concerned, particularly in the 
authorization, authentication and accounting (AAA) phases 
during the network entry process. Two types of authorization 
may be applied, i.e., the conventional network-based 
authorization and a novel scenario that allow the subscriber 
to perform the authorization procedure to another subscriber 
(as on the Bluetooth pairing procedure).  
On the mobility side, several requirements have to be met 
in order to achieve a seamless FAP-to-FAP and FAP-to-
macrocell handovers. At last, this architecture should also be 
interworked with the existing circuit switch network to allow 
the continuity implementation of existing supplementary 
services such as call barring, call waiting, call forwarding, 
voicemail, SMS, etc. 
IV. 
IMS SIGNALLING IN FEMTOCELL NETWORK 
A. IMS Signalling Procedure 
In IMS system everything is controlled using one 
common  signalling  method. The  signalling  allows network   
 
 
Figure 5.   Signalling messages flow in registration procedure 
 
   
entities to communicate with one another as well as 
application servers (ASs).  
As the comparison, in the legacy Integrated Service 
Digital Network (ISDN), Signalling System #7 (SS7) is the 
signalling method used to connect facilities in the telephone 
network. SS7 connects different operators’ networks with 
one another, and connects all of the switches within the 
network with one another. In IMS, SS7 is replaced with a 
new signalling method: SIP, which is used to control 
everything in the network. 
SIP signalling is the primary method for user registration 
and session control in the IMS architecture. The CSCF is the 
core signalling server in the IMS networks. It acts as both a 
SIP Registrar and SIP proxy server. Fig. 5 depicts the 
signalling procedures for registration in the IMS Core.  
The procedure starts with the user’s SIP REGISTER 
request being sent to the visited P-CSCF. Due to air interface 
bandwidth limitation, messages are compressed before being 
sent out by the user and are decompressed at the P-CSCF. If 
multiple S-CSCFs exist in the user’s home network, an I-
CSCF needs to be deployed for selecting an S-CSCF for 
serving the user session. In this case, the P-CSCF resolves 
the address of the user’s home I-CSCF using the user’s home 
domain name and forwards the REGISTER to the I-CSCF. 
After the I-CSCF sends a User-Authorization-Request 
(UAR) to the HSS, which returns available S-CSCF 
addresses, the I-CSCF selects one S-CSCF and forwards the 
REGISTER message. 
B. Session Establishment Signalling in Femtocell 
In IMS, there are three forms of messaging, i.e., 
immediate messaging, session-based messaging and deferred 
delivery messaging. Session establishment is part of session-
based messaging. The procedure involves an end-to-end 
signalling message exchange.  
There are several signalling messages that take part in the 
session establishment procedure as shown in Table 1.

TABLE I.  
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT MESSAGES 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6.   Session establishment signalling in femtocell 
Originating F-UE1 generates a SIP INVITE request and 
sends it to the P-CSCF. The P-CSCF processes the request: 
for example, it decompresses the request and verifies the F-
UE1’s identity before forwarding the request to the S-CSCF. 
The S-CSCF processes the request, executes service control 
which may include interactions with ASs and eventually 
determines the entry point of the home operator of F-UE2 
based on F-UE2’s identity in the SIP INVITE request. I-
CSCF receives the request and contacts the HSS to find the 
S-CSCF that is serving F-UE2. The request is passed to the 
S-CSCF. The S-CSCF takes charge of processing the 
terminating session, which may include interactions with 
ASs and eventually delivers the request to the P-CSCF. After 
further processing (e.g., compression and privacy checking), 
the P-CSCF delivers the SIP INVITE request to F-UE2.  
 
 
Correspondent F-UE2 generates a response – 183 
Session Progress – which traverses back to F-UE1 following 
the route that was created on the way from F-UE1 (i.e., F-
UE2 → FAP2 → F-GW → MME/SGW → P-CSCF → S-
CSCF → I-CSCF → S-CSCF → P-CSCF → MME/SGW → 
F-GW → FAP1 → F-UE1). After a few more round trips, 
both sets of F-UE1 and F-UE2 complete session 
establishment and are able to start the actual application 
(e.g., voice calls). 
Detail on IMS session establishment procedure can be 
seen in [13]. The complete signalling flow diagram of IMS 
session establishment procedure on femtocell network is 
depicted in Fig. 6. 
 
C. Signalling Analysis and Performance 
The Session Initiation Delay (SID) is often used to 
analyze the performance of session establishment signalling. 
SID is a user QoS parameter that can be defined as the period 
between the instant the F-UE1 triggers the initiate session 
command and the instant the F-UE1 receives the message 
that is alerted by F-UE2.  
Obviously, there are many factors that influence the SID. 
In this paper we distinguish the delay into three categories, 
i.e., IMS connections delay, processing delay and queue 
delay. Thus, it can be approximated as:

IMS connection delays are influenced mostly by the 
message propagation delay in the air interface (F-UE to 
FAP) and the transmission delay through the backhaul links 
and backbone network. In wireless transmission, the Radio 
Link Control (RLC) is used to improve the performance of 
frame error rate (FER) due to bandwidth availability and 
channel condition. The channel bandwidth (B/W) is assumed 
as 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz and 20 MHz. Later, the channel 
rate (R) can be calculated by considering 3GPP TS. 36. 213 
and TS 36. 306.  
Furthermore, the number of frame a packet (k) is required 
to be calculated for every specified channel rates. The RLC 
frame duration or inter-frame time (τ) is assumed 10 ms for 
downlink access. Then number of bytes in each frame can be 
calculated as R x τ  x 
8
1 . Subsequently, the value of k for 
particular signalling messages as shown in Table 1 can be 
calculated as [12]:  
 
message size
k = number of  byte
 
(2) 
 
Since the detail operation of LTE-based femtocell radio link 
is not specified yet, the RLC delay analysis given by [15] is 
assumed to be used. The analysis of transport delay when 
transmitting a packet over the RLC is approximated as [15]:

The open-air operation radio access network is vulnerable to

where k is number of frames, n is number of RLC 
retransmission trials, p the probability of a RLC frame being

over the air interface, τ is the interframe time and P(Cij) is 
the first frame received correctly at destination as the ith 
retransmission frame at the jth retransmission. 
Based on Fig. 6, it can be assumed that there are A 
messages involved in the session establishment processes 
between F-UE1 and P-CSCF of the visited IMS network. In 
addition, there are also B messages involve between P-CSCF 
of the terminating IMS network and F-UE2. Therefore the 
IMS connection delay (DIMSconct ) is given as:

Furthermore, the processing delay (Dproc) is determined at 
all entities in the IMS signalling path, i.e., P-CSCF, I-CSCF, 
S-CSCF in both home and visited networks, plus the HSS. It 
included the queue delay and address lookup table delay.  
If number of messages processed in each entity is 
denoted as C, the delay in each entity (Dproc) can be 
approximated as:

Finally, the queuing delay for IMS session establishment 
signalling is determined in every network entities. The end-
to-end packet delay from F-UE1 to F-UE2 depends on the 
number of the packets at each queue as well as the applied 
queue model (i.e., M/M/1, M/D/1, etc.). 
By assuming that the transmission buffer at the network 
node is delay free, thus the queue delay is considered only at 
the receive buffer of F-UE1 and F-UE2. They can be 
approximated:

messages processed in each entity is denoted as C, thus the

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the IMS signalling in femtocell network has 
been studied and analyzed. The LTE-based femtocell is 
considered for the integration with the IMS core network. 
The session establishment signalling procedure has is 
described and analyzed in order to show the IMS signalling 
functionality in femtocell network. We proposed the 
particular signalling call flows for session establishment 
procedure. In addition, the signalling performance is 
intended to be determined by mean of delay properties. The 
IMS connection delay, processing delay and queue delay are 
suggested to be considered as the delay properties of Session

Initiation Delay. The further work on simulation may 
corroborate the proposed mechanism and solution.
