Abstract—In this paper, we focus on ultra-dense network mod-
eling where both the Base Stations (BSs) and Mobile Terminals
(MTs) are UAVs. In this case, two communication nodes can
be very close to each other. However, existing cellular network
analyses typically use the standard unbounded path loss model
where received power decays like rβ over a distance r. This
standard model is a good approximation for the path-loss in
wireless communications over large values of r but is not valid
for small values of r due to the singularity at 0. This model is often
used along with a random uniform node distribution, even though
in a group of uniformly distributed nodes some may be arbitrarily
close to one another, thus, it will lose accuracy and may be
not applicable for UAV-to-UAV communications. To tackle this
problem, by using mathematical tool behind stochastic geometry,
we propose tractable analytical frameworks of coverage and rate
based on the novel unbounded path-loss model with a constant
distance factor r0 for analyzing the UAV-to-UAV communications.

I. INTRODUCTION
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have received signiﬁcant
attention in wireless research as they can not only be exploited
as aerial BSs, but also functioned as a new type of MTs. In
most of the available literatures, the path-loss models for UAVs
are devised and formulated via experimental measurement [1],
[2], which may not yield a tractable analytical approach for
system-level analysis. Due to the simplicity and mathematical
tractability, the unbounded path-loss model L prq “ rβ has
been widely applied to characterize channel power gain caused
by large scale fading in wireless networks [3], especially when
transmission distance is large in the rural areas. However, as
the network density becomes larger in the ﬁfth generation
(5G) and wireless networks, it becomes more likely that
the transmission distance is small. Despite its simplicity,
unbounded path-loss model fails to accurately characterize
channel power gain in this case. In particular, when r P p0, 1q,
applying unbounded path-loss model would artiﬁcially force
the received signal power to be greater than the transmitted
signal power, which is physically impossible.
Therefore, a more realistic model, namely, bounded pathloss
model, has been adopted to model the channel power gain
caused by pathloss, especially for dense urban scenarios.
Widely applied bounded path-loss models include p1 ` rqβ,
1 ` rβ and max
␣
1, rβ(
. In literature, the impact of bounded
path-loss model on wireless network performance has been
extensively investigated, e.g., [4]. However, all the previous
investigated models are based on the ﬁxed distance factor, i.e.,
1m, which is not suitable for modeling and analyzing UAV
networks. The generalization to a generic bounded distance
is never analyzed in the previous studies for ultra-dense UAV
networks.
Motivated by these considerations, in the present paper, we
propose the novel bounded path-loss model with a generic dis-
tance factor, r0 as an approximated formulation for a measured
path-loss model [5]. To evaluate the performance, tractable
analytical frameworks of coverage probability and average
rate are obtained with aid of the mathematical tool behind
stochastic geometry. Speciﬁcally, a closed-form expression of
coverage probability is derived, which could provide the po-
tential insights for the system-level analysis and optimization.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a bi-dimensional downlink ultra-dense cellular
networks with aerial BSs and MTs, i.e., drones or UAVs. The
BSs are modeled as points of a homogeneous Poisson point
process (PPP), denoted by ΨBS, of density λBS. The MTs are
densely distributed as another independent homogeneous PPP,
denoted by ΨMT, of density λMT. Each BS is assumed to emit
a constant transmit power P. Without any loss of generality,
the analytical frameworks are developed for the typical MT,
denoted by MT0, that is located at the origin. The BS serving
MT0 is denoted by BS0. The subscripts 0, i and n identify the
intended link, a generic interfering link, and a generic BS-to-
MT (UAV-to-UAV) link. The set of interfering BSs is denoted
by ΨBS,i.
For each BS-to-MT link, path-loss and fast-fading are
considered. Shadowing is not explicitly taken into account
because its net effect lies in modifying the density of the
BSs [6]. All BS-to-MT links are assumed to be mutually
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).
1) Path-Loss: Consider a generic BS-to-MT link of length
rn, the path-loss is L prnq “ kpr0 ` rnqβ, where k and β ą 2
are the path-loss constant and the path-loss slope (exponent).
2) Fast-Fading: Consider a generic BS-to-MT link. The
power gain due to small-scale fading is assumed to follow
an exponential distribution with mean Ω. Without loss of
generality, Ω “ 1 is assumed. The power gain of a generic
BS-to-MT link is denoted by h.
3) Cell Association Criterion: A cell association criterion
based on the highest average received power is assumed. Let
BSn P Ψ denote a generic BS of the network. The serving
BS, BS0, is obtained as follows:

IV. NUMERICAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we illustrate the numerical results of pro-
posed analytical framework based on the bounded path-loss
model with a generic distance r0.
In Fig. 1, we evaluate the performance of coverage probabil-
ity and average rate as a function of density of BSs for different
values of r0 based on (2), (3) and closed-form formulation
in (5). Note that the density of BSs is represented by the
cell radius Rcell, and λBS “ 1

cell. In addition, Monte-
Carlo simulation results are provided to validate the accuracy
of proposed analytical frameworks.
It is worth noting that the performance trends of both
coverage and rate for the unbounded path-loss model are
independent with cell radius or density of BSs. Nevertheless,
with the bounded path-loss model, the trends of rate would
be monotonically increasing when cell radius increases. In
addition, it is indicated that lower r0 value could enhance the
system performance for ultra-dense scenario, and vice versa.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have introduced new analytical frameworks
of coverage probability and average rate under the application
of the bounded path-loss model with r0. The proposed mathe-
matical approach is in a good agreement with Monte-Carlo
simulations. Through the performance comparisons of the
conventional unbounded path-loss model, it is veriﬁed that the
bounded path-loss model could provide different performance
trends as a function of BSs density, which delivers potential
insights and design guidelines for UAV network deployment.
