Abstract—This paper investigates the connected vehicle 
concept at intersections with traffic signals control and 
proposes the use of Visible Light Communication (VLC) in 
Vehicular 
Communication 
Systems 
for 
vehicle 
safety 
applications. A smart vehicle lighting system that combines the 
functions of illumination, signaling, communications, and 
positioning is presented. A generic model of cooperative 
transmissions for vehicular communications services is 
established. Three specific vehicular communications systems 
are 
analyzed. 
One 
is 
for 
Infrastructure-to-Vehicle 
communications from the street lamps, located on roadside, to 
the vehicles; the other is for in line Vehicle-to-Vehicle 
communications and the last for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure 
communications from cars to the traffic lights, at the crossroad. 
An on-off code is used to transmit data. The encoded message 
contains the ID code of each emitter concomitantly with a 
traffic message that is received, decoded and resent to another 
vehicle or to traffic light, in the crossroad. An algorithm to 
decode the information is established. A phasing traffic flow is 
presented as a proof of concept.

INTRODUCTION 
The communication through visible light holds special 
importance when compared to existing forms of wireless 
communications. The visible light spectrum is completely 
untapped for communication and can complement the RF-
based mobile communication systems.  
Recently the demand for the solution of road traffic 
problems such as accidents, congestion and the associated 
environmental pollution has significantly increased. By 
enabling wireless communication among vehicles and 
between vehicles and infrastructure, the safety and the 
efficiency of road traffic can be substantially improved. 
Highway and local roads are becoming more congested 
every year due to insufficient road development to 
accommodate the growing number of vehicles. In order to 
reduce accidents, congestion and offer smooth traffic flow, 
several solutions are being adopted. Solutions such as: 
intelligent traffic control systems, providing communication 
infrastructures along the road; vehicular communication and 
likewise, are currently research trends under the area of 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]. 
Modern vehicles are equipped with many electronic sensors, 
which monitor the vehicle’s speed, position, heading, and 
lateral 
and 
longitudinal 
acceleration. 
Although 
the 
technology already exists, vehicles rarely communicate this 
information wirelessly to other vehicles or roadside 
infrastructure. The goal of the cooperative intelligent 
transport system (C-ITS) is to provide a vehicular 
communication system that can enable quick, cost-effective 
means to distribute data in order to ensure safety, traffic 
efficiency, driver comfort, and so forth. Researchers are 
anticipating 
the 
deployment 
of 
wireless 
vehicle 
communication, and have begun developing applications 
that use this new technology to improve safety and reduce 
congestion. This use case is known as connected vehicles. 
Recently, the transportation lighting infrastructure such as 
street lamps, traffic lights, automotive lamps, etc., is 
changing to LEDs. Therefore, in the case of an ITS based on 
VLC, it will be possible to make use of the conventional 
automotive and traffic LEDs. Consequently, the cost 
incurred in building the ITS infrastructure will be reduced. 
Secondly, the electromagnetic compatibility problem, which 
is a very serious problem in ITSs based on RF signals, will 
be minimized since visible light and the conventional RF 
signals occupy different parts of the electromagnetic 
spectrum. Visible light represents a new communication 
opportunity 
for 
vehicular 
networking 
applications. 
Compared to RF-based communications, VLC offers 
robustness against jamming attacks, a smaller interference 
domain, and a large license-free spectrum [5, 6, 7].

Vehicular Communication Systems are an emerging 
type of network in which vehicles and roadside units are the 
communicating 
nodes, 
providing 
each 
other 
with 
information, such as safety warnings and traffic information 
[8].The vehicular communication for C-ITS is composed of 
infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) 
and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. The 
I2V applications focus on utilizing the trafﬁc related 
infrastructure, such as trafﬁc light or streetlight to 
communicate useful information. So, VLC can be realized 
as a secondary application in LED arrays that are placed for 
lighting. In this way, some of the wireless traffic can be sent 
using light, with less cost and less carbon footprint.  
Recently, LED-based optical wireless communication 
has been also proposed for car-to-car message delivery. 
LEDs are highly reliable, energy efficient and have a life-
cycle that exceeds by far the classical light sources leading 
to the replacement of classical halogen lamps with LED 
lighting [ 9 ]. This option turned out to be particularly 
effective in short range direct communications to explore 
Line-of-sight (LoS) and overcome the issues related to the 
isotropic nature of radio waves. One additional benefit of 
LEDs is that they can switch to different light intensities at a 
very fast rate. This functionality has given rise to a novel 
communication technology (Visible Light Communication - 
VLC), where LED luminaires can be used for high speed 
data transfer [10, 11, 12 ]. VLC is a low cost technology and 
is easy to implement. VLC seems to be appropriate for 
providing 
wireless 
data 
exchange 
for 
automotive 
applications in the context in which the LED lighting began 
to be widespread in transportation, being integrated in 
traffic infrastructures (in traffic lights, street lighting and 
traffic signals) and in the vehicle lighting systems.  
In the recent past, we have developed a WDM device 
that enhances the transmission capacity of the optical 
communications in the visible range. The device was based 
on tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin light controlled filter 
with two optical gates to select different channel 
wavelengths. When different visible signals are encoded in 
the same optical transmission path [ 13, 14], the device 
multiplexes the different optical channels, performs 
different filtering processes (amplification, switching, and 
wavelength conversion) and finally decodes the encoded 
signals recovering the transmitted information. This device 
can be used as receiver, and helps developing automated 
vehicle technologies that allow vehicles to communicate 
with the surrounding ‘environment’ [15].  
The proposed smart vehicle lighting system involves 
wireless communication, computer based algorithms, smart 
sensor and optical sources network, which constitutes a 
transdisciplinary 
approach 
framed 
in 
cyber-physical 
systems.  
An introduction to the paper is given. The rest of the 
paper is structured as follows: In Section II, a traffic 
scenario is established and the transmitters and receivers are 
characterized. The performance of a cooperative driving 
system is evaluated in Section III. In Section IV, as proof of 
concept, a traffic scenario is presented and tested. Finally, in 
Section V, the conclusions are addressed.  
II. 
CONNECTED VEHICLES MODEL 
A VLC system mainly consists of a VLC transmitter that 
modulates the light produced by LEDs and a VLC receiver, 
based on a photosensitive element that is used to extract the 
transmitted modulated signal.

The transmitter and the receiver are physically 
separated, but connected through the VLC channel. For 
VLC 
systems, 
LoS 
is 
a 
mandatory 
condition.An 
infrastructure-to-vehicle followed by vehicle-to-vehicle and 
by vehicle-to-infrastructure communication was simulated. 
The illustration of the proposed scenario, for a light traffic 
controlled crossroad, is displayed in Figure 1. In Figure 1a, 
the generic cooperative vehicular model is shown, in figure 
1b the emitters and receivers in the vehicles are depicted 
and in Figure 1c, the proposed scenario, is illustrated. Using 
the I2V communication, each street lamp (transmitter) sends 
a message received and analyzed by a SiC receiver, located 
at the rooftop of the vehicle. Using the headlights as 
transmitters, the information is resent to a leader vehicle 
(V2V) or directly to a crossroad receiver (V2I), at the traffic 
light, interconnected to a local controller that feeds one or 
more signal heads.

Figure 2. 
Unit cell (LED array = RGBV color spots). 
Along the roads, street lamps are distributed in a square 
topology, for data transmission and lighting purposes. They 
are based on commercially available violet (V: 400 nm) and 
white RGB-LEDs. The white LEDs require three separate 
driver circuits to realize the white light. To decrease this 
complexity at each node, only one chip of the LED is 
modulated for data transmission, the Red (R:626 nm), the 
Green (G:530 nm) or the Blue (B:470 nm) while the other 
two are provided constant current for illumination. The 
luminous intensity is regulated by the driving current for 
white perception. In Figure 2a and Figure 2b the optical 
spectrum of the used LEDs is presented. A four-code 
assignment for the LEDs was used. The unit cell employs 
four R, G, B and V LED located at the corners of a square 
grid, as shown in Figure 2c.  
The estimated distance from the street lamps to the 
receivers is used to generate a circle around each transmitter 
(see Figure 2), on which the receiver must be located in 
order to receive the transmitted information. The grid size 
was chosen in order to avoid an overlap in the receiver from 
the data from adjacent grid points. The geometric scenario 
used for calculation uses, for calibration, a smaller size 
square grid (2 cm), to improve its practicality. To receive 
the information from several transmitters, the device must 
be positioned where the circles from each transmitter 
overlap, producing, at the receiver, a MUX signal that after 
demultiplexing, acts twofold as a positioning system and a 
data transmitter.

The nine generated regions, defined onwards as 
footprints, are presented in Figure 2. Assuming that only 
one of the RGB chip LEDs is modulated at each corner, it is 
presented in Table I, the nine possible allowed overlaps. If 
the signal comes only from one LED, the position of the 
LED is assigned to the device’s reference point. If the 
device receives multiple signals, i.e., if it is in an 
overlapping region of two or more LEDs, it finds the 
centroid of the received coordinates and stores it as the 
reference point. So, inside the cell, nine reference points are 
considered. Thus, the overlap region is used as an advantage 
to increase the accuracy in position estimation because more 
overlapping region means more reference points. 
A large-dimension environment, like a road network 
surrounding (Figure 1b), is analysed by dividing the space

Figure 3. Topology: a) Cluster with sixteen cells (square topology) having 
each one four modulated RGBV-LEDs located at the corners of the square 
grid. b) Lighting plan and generated joint footprints in a crossroad. 
To build the vehicular VLC system, a simplified cluster 
of cells for the streetlights is used. The analysed crossroad is 
located in the interception of line 2 with column 3 (white 
cells in Figure 3a). Two traffic flows are considered, one in 
the horizontal (W) and the other on the vertical direction (S). 
Each streetlight sends traffic message that includes the 
synchronism, its physical ID and traffic information. Each 
node, X i,j, carries its own colour, X, (RGBV), as well as its 
horizontal and vertical ID position in the surrounding 
network (i,j).In the I2V communication, the emitters are 
located along the roadside. Each lamp transmits data during 
the time slot it occupies, i.e., the individual LED lamp 
transmits its own data depending on the area it locates. The 
transmitted information is received and decoded at an 
external SiC pi’npin receiver, located on the rooftop of the 
car (Figure 1b). When a probe vehicle enters the 
streetlight´s capture range, the receivers respond to light 
signal and its unique ID and the traffic message are assigned.  
To build the V2V system between a leader and a follower 
vehicle, the follower sends the message that is received by 
the leader and can be retransmitted to the next car [16, 17] 
or to the infrastructure. The follower vehicle is equipped 
with two headlamps transmitters. The leader vehicle is 
assumed to be equipped with three SiC pi’npin receivers, 
symmetrically distributed at the tails, to detect optical 
messages. The leader receives three signals, compares them 
and, based on their intensities infers the drive distance and 
the relative speed between both [18], and can send again the 
information to a next car (V2V) or to an infrastructure (V2I). 
Therefore, each probe vehicle receives two different 
messages; the one transmitted by the streetlight (I2V) and 
the one coming from the follow vehicle (V2V) and can 
compare them (Figure 1b). This system uses an approach in 
which a sequence of cellular locations is matched to a route 
segment along the road network that appears to be the most 
probable. All observations for a single section are analysed 
together to produce an estimate of the lane occupied and 
travel time along that section.  
The introduction of wireless communication between 
vehicles and the infrastructure, referred to as V2I 
communication, has the potential to address the limitations 
of point detection. Instead of estimating exact vehicle 
position, speed, and queues from detector actuations, V2I 
communication allows the direct measurement of these 
values. In the V2I communication, two interconnect 
receivers are located at the same traffic light, facing the 
cross roads, and the emitters at the headlights of the moving 
cars approaching the interception. When a car enters in the 
infrastructure´s capture range of the receivers, an approach 
message is received and decoded by the corresponding 
optical pi’npin receiver. So, each driver, approaching the 
intersection area from S, W or both sends an approach 
request, that are compared by the intersection manager 
(local controller of the traffic light). Those messages contain 
the assigned ID positions, speeds, and flow direction of the 
vehicles that approach the intersection. The requests are 
labelled either with a W (West) or S (South) label, 
depending on the flow they belong to. The vehicle service 
time depends on its flow and on the flow of the following 
vehicle. The problem that the intersection manager has to 
solve is allocating the reservations among a set of drivers in 
a way that a specific objective is maximized. This goal can 
be, for instance, minimizing the average delay caused by the 
presence of the regulated intersection. In particular, V2V 
communication is useful to enhance the action space of a 
driver, e.g., through the option of dynamically joining 
groups of vehicles, based on the idea of platoons.

III. 
CODING/DECODING TECHNIQUES  
A. Modulation scheme 
A dedicated four channel LED driver, with multiple 
outputs, was developed to modulate the optical signals. The 
modulator converts the coded message into a modulated 
driving current signal that actuates the emitters of each 
violet and tri-chromatic LEDs. A graphical user interface 
allows the control of the system, which includes the setting 
of the driving current, bit sequence and frequency of each 
emitter.  
We have considered a network composed of a single 
access point (vehicle) and several nodes that periodically 
generate data, at different rates. The optical signals are 
synchronized and include the transmission of information 
related to the ID position of the transmitters and the 
message to broadcast. So, in a time slot, each node has a 
packet to transmit.

Figure 4. Frame structure. Representation of  one  original encoded 
message [10101: rrr ccc: XY….].  R3,4 , G3,3, B2, 4 and V2,3 are the transmitted 
node packet, in a time slot, from the crossroad in the network. 
Each frame is a word of 32 bits, divided into three 
blocks: the synchronism (5 bits), the binary node address, (6 
bits) and the traffic message (payload data). In Figure 4, an 
example of the codification of the digital optical signals is 
illustrated. We assigned the first five bits to the 
synchronization in a [10101] pattern. It corresponds to the 
simultaneous transmission of the four nodes in a time slot. 
Each colour signal carries its own ID-BIT [rrr;ccc] where 
the first three bits give the ID binary code of the line and the 
next three the ID binary code of the column. For instance, 
an ID_BIT [011 100] for the R3,4 streetlight is sent whereas 
in case of G3,3, an ID_BIT [011 011] is generated by the 
green LED. Thus, R3,4 , G3,3, B2,4 and V2,3 are the transmitted 
node packets, in a time slot, inside the crossroad. With 
perfect information, this method will give an exact, unique 
answer, i.e., the unit cell location in the cluster and for each 
unit navigation, the correspondent footprint.  
B. The pi´npin receiver 
The receiver module is the sub-system at the reception 
end of the communication link that extracts information 
from the transmitted modulated light signals. It transforms 
the light signal into an electrical signal that is subsequently 
decoded to extract the transmitted information. The VLC 
receiver 
is 
a 
tandem, 
p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n 
heterostructure 
sandwiched 
between 
two 
transparent 
conductive contacts (TCO).  
The device configuration and operation is shown in 
Figure 5a. The intrinsic layer of the front p-i’-n photodiode 
in made of a-SiC:H while the back intrinsic layer is based 
on a-Si:H. The deposition conditions and optoelectronic 
characterization of the single layers and device as well as 
their optimization were described previously [13, 19]. Due 
to the different absorption coefficient of the active 
absorption layers, both front and back diodes act as optical 
filters confining, respectively, the optical carrier produced 
by the blue and red photons. The optical carriers generated 
by the green photons are absorbed across both (see arrow in 
Figure 5a).

The device operates within the visible range using for 
data transmission the modulated light supplied by the violet 
(V) and by the trichromatic red (R), green (G), blue (B) 
LED transmitters. The combination of the modulated optical 
signal (transmitted data) impinging on the receiver are 
absorbed accordingly to their wavelengths. The combined 
optical signal (MUX signal; received data) is analysed by

reading out the generated photocurrent under negative 
applied voltage (-8V), with a 390 nm background lighting, 
applied from the front side of the receiver [8, 20].  
In Figure 5b, the spectral gain defined as the ratio 
between the photocurrent with and without applied optical 
bias, is displayed. The arrows point towards the gain at the 
analysed R, G, B and V input wavelength. Results show that 
the device acts as an active filter under irradiation. Under 
front irradiation, the long wavelength channels are enhanced 
and the short wavelength channels quenched. It is 
interesting to notice that as the wavelength increases the 
signal strongly increases. This nonlinearity is the main idea 
for the decoding of the MUX signal at the receiver.

In Figure 6a, the bit sequence was chosen to allow all the 
on/off sixteen possible combinations of the four channels. 
On top, the signals used to drive LEDs are shown to guide 
the eyes into the on/off states of each input.  
In Figure 6b, the MUX signals acquired by the receiver, 
located at the crossroad, position #1, #9 and #7 (see Figure 
3), are displayed. The decoded packet of transmitted 
information when all the channels are received is presented 
in the top of the figure.  
The results from Figure 6a show that the MUX signal 
presents as much separated levels as the on/off possible 
combinations of the input channels, allowing decoding the 
transmitted information [21]. On the right hand side, the 
match between MUX levels and the 4 bits binary code 
ascribed to each level is shown. The MUX signal presented 
in Figure 6a, is used for calibration purposes.  
The signal is decoded by assigning each output level to a 
4- digit binary code, [XR, XG, XB, XV], with X=1 if the 
channel is on and X=0 if it is off.  
After decoding the MUX signals, the localisation of the 
mobile target is direct. Taking into account the frame 
structure (Figure 4), the position of the receiver inside the 
navigation cell and its ID in the network is revealed. The ID 
position comes directly from the synchronism block, where 
all the received channels are, simultaneously, on or off. The 
4-bit binary code ascribed to the higher level identifies the 
receiver position in the unit cell. Those binary codes are 
displayed in the right hand of the figure. For instance, the 
level [1100] corresponds to the level d5 where the green and 
the violet channels are simultaneously on (see arrow in 
Figure 6a). The same happens to the other footprints (#1 and 
#9). Each decoded message carries, also, the node address 
of the transmitter. So, the next block of six bits gives de ID 
of the received node. In #7 the location of the transmitters, 
in the network, are G3,2 and V2,3 while in #1 the assigned 
transmitters are R3,4 , G3,2 B2,4 and V2,3. The last block is 
reserved for the transmission of the traffic message (payload 
data). A stop bit (0) is used at the end of the frame. 
IV. 
COOPERATIVE VLC SYSTEM EVALUATION 
The system topology for positioning is a self-positioning 
system in which the measuring unit is mobile. This unit 
receives the signals of several transmitters in known 
locations (corners of the square grid), and has the capability 
to compute its location based on the measured signals. In 
Figure 3, a traffic scenario was established for the 
cooperative I2V, V2V and V2I communications. The proof 
of concept was simulated using the laboratory experimental 
conditions (see Section II). 
A. I2V communication 
To compute the point-to-point exposure along a path, we 
need the data along the path in successive instants. Street 
lamps work as transmitters, sending information together 
with different IDs related to their physical locations. The 
optical receiver inside the mobile terminal extracts the 
location 
information 
to 
perform 
positioning 
and, 
concomitantly, the transmitted data from each transmitter 
[22].

Figure 7a displays the I2V MUX signal received, in three 
times slots, by a rooftop receiver, moving in the W 
direction, when the vehicle is located in #3, moves to #1 and 
arrives to the stop line (#7). In Figure 7b, it moves from 
south from #5 to #1 and arrives to the cross line (# 9). In the 
top of both figures, the decoded packet of data sent by the 
addressed R, G, B and V transmitters are pointed out. On 
the right sides of the figures, the received channel, and so 
the footprint position in the navigation cell, are identified by 
its 4 digit binary code.

On the top the transmitted channels packets [R, G, B, V] are decoded. 1)

In Figure 7a, the nodes R3,2 […011 010…], G3,3 […011

recognized while in Figure 7b the R3,4 […011 100…], G3,3 
[…011 011…], B4,4 […100 100…], and V4,3 […100 111…] 
nodes are identified. In the others positions, only two 
messages arrive to the receiver. The assigned reference 
nodes in Figure 7a are: R3,2 ; B2,2  (#3) and G3,3 ;V2,3 (#7), 
while in Figure 7b the assigned reference point are: #5 (B4,4; 
V4,3) and #9 (R3,4; G3,3). The vehicle speed can be calculated 
by measuring the actual distance travelled overtime using 
ID´s transmitters tracking. The distance is fixed while the 
elapsed time will be obtained through the instants where the 
number of received channels changes. As in Figure 3c, at 
the instant initial, t0, the receiver moves west from footprint 
3 to footprint 1 (Figure 7a). The decoded MUX message 
changes from two (R3,2 B2,2) to four (R3,2 G3,3 B2,2V2,3) 
transmitted channels. After an elapsed time, t, footprint 7 
is reached and the number of received transmitters changes 
again to two (G3,3 V2,3). In the following, this data will be 
transmitted to another leader vehicle through the V2V 
communication or to the traffic light through V2I. 
B. Traffic Signal phasing: I2V, V2V and V2I 
communication  
Signal phasing is the sequence of individual signal phases 
within a cycle that define the order in which pedestrian and 
vehicular movements are assigned the right-of-way. The 
cycle repeats itself continuously over time but the timing of 
the light switches is made according to the phasing of the 
traffic light.  
The phasing duration is variable and dependent on factors 
such as the traffic situation, rush hours, etc. Safety 
requirements dictate that two vehicles consecutively 
accessing the intersection and belonging to the same flow 
must be separated by tailgate distance. If the two 
consecutive vehicles belong to different flows, they must be 
separated by vehicle stopping distance, which is larger than 
tailgate distance for practical values of the system 
parameters. A brief look into the basic anatomy and the 
process of timing traffic signals is given in Figure 8.

Phasing of traffic flows: phase number 01(pedestrian phase), 
phase number 02 (W flow), phase number 03(S flow). 
A traffic scenario was simulated. We consider two flows 
of vehicles entering the system at the beginning of their 
respective roads, one from West (W flow), and one from 
South (S flow). Three vehicles are considered. Vehicle 1 
and Vehicle 3 belong to the same flow (W) and Vehicle 2 
belongs to the S flow. The phasing of the traffic flows is 
composed of a pedestrian-only stage (01 phase), and two 
single-lane road phases crossing at a square intersection

area: the W flow stage (02 phase) and the S flow stage (03 
phase). Each phase exists as an electrical circuit from the 
controller to the traffic light and feeds one or more signal 
heads. A phase can apply to a two aspect head (pedestrians; 
red or green) or to a three aspect head (vehicles; red or 
yellow or green). The green and yellow represent the time 
where it is allowed to pass the traffic light and the red the 
time not allowed. The traffic pedestrian lights are passively 
green as long as no vehicle is approaching.

Proof of concept. MUX/DEMUX signals. On the top the 
transmitted channels packets [R, G, B, V] are decoded. a) V2I 
communication from Vehicles 1 and 2 and the infrastructure. b) V2V 
communication between vehicle 3 and Vehicle 1. 
To model a worst-case situation, vehicles approaching 
the intersection from different flows are assumed to have a 
conflicting trajectory. A vehicle’s intersection access time is 
defined as the time at which the head of the vehicle enters 
the intersection area. Therefore, three subsequent instants 
have to be predictable, t´1, t´2 and t´3, as the correspondent 
access times of the Vehicle 1, Vehicle 2 and Vehicle 3 
(Figure 8). 
A first-come-first-serve approach could be realized by 
accelerating or decelerating the vehicles such that they 
arrive at the intersection when gaps in the conflicting traffic 
flows and pedestrians have been created for them. However, 
a one-by-one service policy is not efficient at high vehicle 
arrival rates. From a capacity point of view it is more 
efficient, if Vehicle 3 is given access at t’3 before Vehicle 2, 
t’2 to the intersection, then, forming a west platoon of 
vehicles before (t´2) giving way to the south conflicting flow 
as stated in Figure 8. 
In Figure 9a, the V2I and in Figure 9b, the V2V 
communications, in successive moments, are displayed. 
Three instants are considered to define the phase’s duration, 
t1, t2 and t3 (Figure 8). At t1 and t2, Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 
approaches, respectively, the intersection and contact 
optically the intersection manager (controller) by sending a 
request message to the receiver (V2I) located at the traffic 
light that faces the road (Figure 3b). Vehicle 3, contacts the 
infrastructure (V2I) at t3. Those messages contain their 
positions and approach velocities. As a follower exists 
(Vehicle 3), the request message may also include it 
position and speed. This information alerts the controller to 
a later request message (V2I), at t3, confirmed later by the 
follow vehicle. In Figure 9a, the MUX signal at each 
receiver and the assigned decoded messages (at the top of 
the figure) are displayed at t1 and t2. The position of both 
vehicles are: R3,2 and B2,2  (#3, W) for Vehicle 1 and B4,4 and 
V4,3 (#5, S) for Vehicle 2. Data in Figure 9b, shows that 
Vehicle 3, contacts at t1, the leader (V2V), from #7, W (G3,1 
V21). At t2 moves to #1 (R3,2 G3,1 B2,2 V21) and finally sends 
the request message, at t3, from #3,W (R3,2 B2,2) to the leader 
(V2V) and to the infrastructure (V2I). 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS  
A distributed mechanism for the control and management 
of a traffic light controlled crossroad network, where 
convehicles receive information from the network (I2V), 
interact each other (V2V) and with the infrastructure (V2I) 
was analyzed. VLC is the transmission technology. A 
simulated traffic scenario was presented and a generic 
model 
of 
cooperative 
transmissions 
for 
vehicular 
communications services was established.  
As a proof of concept, a phasing of traffic flows is 
suggested. The system is composed by VLC transmitters 
that modulate the light produced by white LEDs, and by 
VLC receivers, based on photosensitive elements (a-SiC:H 
pinpin photodiodes), that code and decode the emitted 
modulated signals. The experimental results confirmed that 
the proposed cooperative VLC architecture is suitable for 
the intended applications. Considering the experimental 
results obtained in the prototype and reported in this paper, 
and the potential for further improvements, it seems 
reasonable to anticipate the increasing usage of this 
approach in the near future.

In order to move towards real implementation, the 
performance of such systems still needs improvement. As a 
future goal, we plan to finalize the embedded application, 
for experimenting in several road configurations with either 
static or moving vehicles.
