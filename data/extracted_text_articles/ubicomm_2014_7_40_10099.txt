Abstract—Advances in ubiquitous system and service are
recently made thanks to the fruition of hardware and software
developments so far achieved. The key elements of the ubiqui-
tous services might be the omnipresence of service equipment
and the distribution network to provide information to users
everywhere. In this sense, satellite network could be one of
the most suitable candidates for ubiquitous services in mobile
and ﬁxed environment for bi-directional communication and
wideband broadcasting network system, which could be the
optimal choice for high quality educational information ser-
vices. This paper analyzes the feasibility of new satellite UHD
broadcasting service scenarios using the Ka frequency band
while increasing the service availability in Korea. Some countries
have started their service trials, and plan to launch commercial
broadcasting through a satellite link. For these services, diverse
service scenarios should be evaluated to identify the most eﬃcient
way to provide the target service on schedule. For this purpose, a
rain attenuation analysis was conducted to recognize the amount
of expected attenuation in the Korean territory, and the results
were applied to the design of the DVB-S2 satellite link. The
service scenarios were then analyzed from a variety of aspects
considering as many technologies as possible that are expected to
be available in the near future. Some of these service scenarios
were evaluated for their service availability within the Korean
territory through live experiments, the results of which showed
that satellite UHDTV service in the Ka band is possible if
the proper technologies are selected. This study will be helpful
for determining the most reasonable way for other countries
preparing similar services at the initial stage, and can contribute
to a stable provisioning of UHDTV services in the consumer
market.

I. Introduction
Since its inception with a 24 hours-a-day single channel
service in 2003, digital HDTV satellite broadcasting service
in Korea has developed into a large market with more than 100
HDTV channels and about four-million subscribers. Currently,
digital satellite broadcasting services are provided through the
Ku-band transponder of the KoreaSAT-6 satellite, which was
launched in December 2010, and they will be extended for
next-generation broadcasting services, such as stereoscopic 3-
Dimentional TV (3DTV) and Ultra HDTV (UHDTV). These
new broadcasting services will demand frequency capacity
more than the current saturated Ku-band, and to resolve such
limitations, the 21.4 to 22.0 GHz frequency band was allocated
for Broadcasting Satellite Service (BSS) in regions 1 and 3
at the World Administrative Radio Conference-92 (WARC-
92) for implementation after April 1, 2007. According to this
allocation, many countries in these regions have been com-
petitively requesting frequency registration for this frequency
band, and the number of registrations has increased signiﬁ-
cantly to up to 700 satellite networks. However, since propa-
gation attenuations in this badn may place a heavy restriction
on the service availability and system feasibility, mitigation
techniques have been studied from diverse perspectives [1].
Many advanced countries have developed various Ultra High
Deﬁnition (UHD) broadcasting technologies, opening a new
horizon for the possibility of commercial UHD broadcasting
service. Since it began its R&D activities for UHD broad-
casting service in 1995, Japan has established a new concept
for next-generation broadcasting service that fully satisﬁes the
human perception capacity in a visual and auditory sense [2].
With overall research results in the every part of broadcasting
chain [3], the Japanese government announced the launch of
trial broadcasting at 4K resolution for mid-2014 and the start
of test broadcasting at 8K resolution for 2016. In the case of
Korea, the pay TV operators conducted experiments for UHD
broadcasting service and started their trial service from the
ﬁrst quarther of 2014. For this end, satellite transmission tests
and terrestrial broadcasting tests for 4K UHD broadcasting
service were successfully conducted in 2013. During the initial
stage of such service, satellites are expected to be the major
medium because of its ﬂexibility and adaptability for new
services. However, since the propagation attenuation in the
Ka band, particularly from rain, poses a signiﬁcant challenge
in service availability, it is needed to investigate the pertinence
and possibility of commercial broadcasting services using this
band for immersive media including UHD video. Moreover,
since the weather in Korea has been changing to an increase in
rainfall in recent years, worsening the conditions for satellite
broadcasting [4][5], reasonable service scenarios should be
carefully taken into consideration. For this purpose, a simple
analysis was conducted to identify what kinds of services
are possible [6]. In this paper, an analysis of previous rain
attenuation models is conducted to conﬁrm their results, and a

link analysis is extended to consider more detailed parameters.
Through these analyses, much more diverse service scenarios
are envisaged. The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. A rain attenuation analysis for UHD broadcasting
using a satellite at the Ka frequency band, to identify how
much rain attenuation has to be expected using the regional
rain distribution of Korea, is presented in Section II. In
addition, an analysis of the link margin for each code rate
and the modulation method of DVB-S2 at a certain rain rate
are presented to evaluate the service availability in Section III.
Next, channel-adaptive UHD satellite broadcasting scenarios
based on the combinations of various technical elements are
provided in Section IV, and the experimental progress for
UHD satellite broadcasting service conducted in Korea is de-
scribed in Section V. Finally, in Section VI, some concluding
remarks are oﬀered.
II. Rain Attenuation Model Analysis in Ka-band
The quality of microwave signals propagating through the
atmosphere over the satellite links is aﬀected by complex
contributions, such as the absorption and scattering caused
by atmospheric gases and water droplets in the precipitation.
Among these contributions, attenuation by atmospheric gases
may normally be neglected when it comes to Ka band satellite
communications. On the other hand, attenuation by precipita-
tion signiﬁcantly degrades the performance of the transmission
link and varies greatly depending on the geographic location
and climate [7][8]. It is therefore essential to precisely predict
the attenuation by rain on the propagation links for the
proper planning of satellite systems and the evaluation of the
feasibility for commercial UHD broadcasting services over the
Ka frequency band in Korea.
A. Standard rain attenuation model
The rain attenuation can be estimated using the model
proposed by Olsen [9], where the rain attenuation for a satellite
system can be predicted based on the speciﬁc attenuation
calculated theoretically according to the scattering properties
of hydrometeors, and the eﬀective path length estimated using
local rainfall data. The Olsen model and more recent studies
for the diﬀerent microphysical properties of hydrometeors
were adopted into the international standards to predict the
speciﬁc attenuation as a function of the rain rate and target
frequency [10]. ITU-R adopted the rain attenuation prediction
model for a frequency range of 1 to 400 GHz using the
rainfall intensity distribution model for a spherical raindrop
shape, and ITU-R P.838 recommended a model for calculating
the attenuation from rain based on knowledge of the rain
rates, and was revised twice to adopt the type of polarization
and the scattering properties for non-spherical raindrops [11].
The estimation model of rain attenuation [12] currently used
as the international standard is the DAH model [13]. This
model uses an empirical approach for estimating the eﬀective
path length, and additionally includes a vertical adjustment
factor to consider the combined eﬀect of several propagation
impairments. The rainfall rate exceeding 0.01% of an average
year with an integration time of 1-min, i.e., R0.01, is desirable
to take local measurements for an accurate estimation of the
rain attenuation whenever possible. Otherwise, an estimate can
be used from the Recommendation ITU-R P.837-6. We found
that the characteristics of precipitation recommended by the
ITU-R model does not correctly represent the local precip-
itation intensity in Korea these days, and therefore decided
to use local measurement data for calculating R0.01, based on
a conversion of the integration time from 20-min to 1-min.
The local rainfall rate will be discussed again in Section II-B.
Next, it is necessary to obtain the speciﬁc attenuation, γ, at a
rainfall rate exceeding 0.01% of an average year, which can
be calculated based on the frequency-dependent coeﬃcients
given in the recommendation [10] and R0.01 determined in the
previous step. The ITU-R model adopts adjustment factors in
the horizontal and vertical directions to consider the relation
between the path length aﬀected by rain and the diameter of
rain cell to estimate the eﬀective path length, Le f f . Finally, the
rain attenuation for 0.01% of a one-year time period, A0.01, as
well as for the other percentages of an average year, can be
predicted.
B. Rainfall rates in Korea
It is necessary to use rainfall statistics that are as accurate
as possible in the calculation of the speciﬁc attenuation to
obtain the proper rain attenuation value for a certain area
under consideration. To this end, ITU-R classiﬁed Korea and
Japan as rain climate zone K, and recommended using 50.6
mm/h for the rainfall rate exceeded for 0.01% of the average
year [14], which is an important parameter for predicting
rain attenuation. However, the recommended rainfall rate has
turned out to be quite diﬀerent from the measurement data
within the Korea territory.
Table I shows the rainfall rate statistics in Korea, which were
measured over a ten-year period in several regional areas with
a 20-min integration time, and then converted into a 1-min
integration time [5]. It has been reported that the climate of
Korea is becoming more like subtropical weather in terms of
temperature changes, and that the mean rainfall rate for the last
ten years has increased by 9.1% compared to the previous 30

years [4]. The diﬀerence in rainfall rate between ITU-R models
and the measurements listed in Table I indicates that the rain
rates obtained using the ITU-R P.837-6 model do not fully
reﬂect these changes in Koreas local rainfall characteristics.
We therefore use the measured rainfall rates to predict the
various propagation parameters in this paper since the ITU-
R model may give erroneous rain attenuation values on the
radio links in Korea. For calculating the rain attenuation for
UHD satellite broadcasting over the Ka band in Korea, the
center frequency of channel 3 of the Chollian satellite was
used for the operating frequency, and vertical polarization
was therefore selected. To take into account domestic rain
distribution trends, we take 66.4 mm/h as the rainfall rate for
R0.01, which is the measured value for Seoul with location
data of 126.58E and 37.33N. With these values, the estimated
attenuation from rain for the regional use of the Ka-band
satellite system is obtained, and the results compared with
those from the recommended rainfall rate in ITU-R P.837-5,
as shown in Fig. 1. The diﬀerence between the two results
becomes larger as the rainfall rate increases reaching more
than 3.5 dB at 0.01% time rate, which means that the ITU-R
model does not fully reﬂect domestic weather changes, and
regional statistics should therefore be used for a better quality
service provision.
III. Link Analysis for Ka-band Satellite System
The second version of Digital Video Broadcasting via Satel-
lite (DVB-S2) standard is one of the most popular technologies
in satellite broadcasting. We take the DVB-S2 technology into
consideration for the transmission system of a UHD satellite
broadcasting service since the system has been adopted for Ku
band satellite broadcasting in Korea, and this is therefore the
best way to launch a new service minimizing the burden of risk
in terms of investment and service compatibility. In this sec-
tion, we describe DVB-S2 system performance characteristics,
which was conducted by ﬁnding the C/N required to achieve
a packet error rate (PER) of less than 10−7 for the TS packet
for each coding and modulation technique of DVB-S2. The
link margin of the DVB-S2 system under the link conditions
addressed in Section II is then estimated.
A. DVB-S2 system performance
The DVB-S2 standard has been speciﬁed to meet the
demands for the best transmission performance, total ﬂex-
ibility, and reasonable receiver complexity. To achieve the
best performance-complexity tradeoﬀ, DVB-S2 beneﬁts from
more recent developments in channel coding and modulation.
Moreover, the system was intended to be used for several
applications including interactive point-to-point applications
and professional applications, such as IP unicasting, digital
TV, news gathering, and data content distribution. The unique
features making these diverse applications achievable is the
adoption of adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) func-
tionality, which allows an optimization of the transmission
parameters for each individual user on a frame-by-frame basis
depending on the path conditions under closed-loop control
through a return channel. To keep the packet error rate at
less than 10−7 over an AWGN channel, it is known that the
required C/N of the DVB-S2 system varies from -2.4 dB
with QPSK 1/4 to 16 dB with 32APSK 9/10. However, since
the eﬀects of nonlinearity and synchronization loss and phase
noise should be considered along with the ideal performance
[15], we take 0.6/1.0/2.0/4.0 dB as an additional power losses
for QPSK/8PSK/16APSK/32APSK, as reasonable estimates
with typical equipment characteristics, respectively. Therefore,
the C/N values required to meet 10−7 of PER over an AWGN
channel for each modulation and coding (MODCOD) parame-
ter of the DVB-S2 system are calculated as shown in Table II.
Table II can be used to select feasible transmission schemes
for a certain service availability by comparing the required
signal level with the link performance as in Table III. More-
over, this can be used to design service composition meaing
how many channels and what kind of channels could be
transmitted within the dedicated bandwidth because total data
rate is simply calculated when the transmission schemes used
are determined.
B. Link analysis of Ka band satellite broadcasting system
To recognize the possible transmittion conﬁguration for 4K
UHD satellite broadcasting over the Ka band, it is necessary

to evaluate the link margin of the Chollian satellite and the
available bitrates that can be transmitted through its corre-
sponding bandwidth for each MODCOD parameter of the
DVB-S2 system under a certain rain attenuation condition. The
link margins of the Chollian satellite downlink, which can be
used to deﬁne the possible transmission method to be used
for a certain rainfall rate, are given in Table III. For a more
realistic analysis, the required C/N contains non-linear power
loss under the assumption of using a pre-distortion technique
at an earth station, as discussed in Section III-A.

*Above listed ﬁgures are assumed that antenna diameter
=
45cm(38dBi), antenna Noise Temperature = 92K, Noise Bandwidth
= 100MHz and all the carrier to interference ratios (C/I) = 60 dB.
For the simple design of the uplink from the transmitter
station to satellite, it is assumed that no rain loss is considered
thanks to the perfect uplink power control, and the total
transponder bandwidth is occupied with the minimum input
and output backoﬀ. The earth station antenna gain is calculated
under the assumption that a 70 cm antenna diameter would be
proper for the Ka band satellite link. As shown in Table III,
it turns out that the link margin for clear sky conditions is
around 13 dB, and the broadcasting link is unable to maintain
its connection with the receivers at rain conditions of higher
than 0.07% of the time percentage because the only possible
tramission schemes are lower than QPSK 1/2 code rate which
could be usable but very impractical choices.
IV. Ka-Band UHD Satellite Broadcasting Scenarios
Based on the above link analysis of the DVB-S2 satellite
UHD broadcasting system using the Chollian satellite, several
satellite UHD broadcasting scenarios are considered, and their
service performances are analyzed. As candidate technologies
to be used for the service scenario establishment, diverse
technologies available at present or expected to be available
in the near future are taken into account. Special regard is
paid to the backward compatibility with the current HDTV
services and the adaptability to channel variation for extending
service availability. Channel adaptability is a technology being
introduced to mitigate rain attenuation, which is a critical issue
in Ka band satellite services. The related technologies in terms
of transmission are being widely developed in many countries
[1]. To discuss the backward compatibility, it is necessary to
identify the legacy HDTV receiver and new UHDTV receiver
in terms of the element technologies. Legacy HDTV receivers
are deﬁned to have the capability to deal with H.264/AVC
HP@4.1 for the video codec, and DVB-S2 constant coding
and modulation (CCM) mode for the transmission. On the
other hand, the new UHDTV receivers have the capability to
support H.264/AVC with higher than HP@5.1 and HEVC for
the video codec, and DVB-S2 variable coding and modulation
(VCM) mode for the transmission. Therefore, new UHDTV
receivers are able to receive the frame resolution of UHD
video as well as HD video and a satellite signal with multiple
protection levels, which makes it possible to design much more
ﬂexible service scenarios. The service scenarios for satellite
UHD broadcasting are categorized according to the perspective
on the video codec, transmission mode and frequency band.
In the ﬁrst step, service scenarios are classiﬁed into single
layered and multiple layered services according to whether
the service is composed of multiple layers in terms of video
quality. Single-layered service is the simplest scenario and can
be applied for dedicated channel service, which only covers
new subscribers for UHDTV services. However, in multiple-
layered service scenarios, several combinations of technologies
are considered to ﬁnd a way to provide backward compatibility
and mitigate the channel deterioration from rain attenuation.
To meet these requirements, scalable video coding (SVC) and
simulcasting schemes are considered in the scenario as well.
A. Single layered scenarios
Single layered scenarios only aim to provide UHD broad-
casting service itself, and thus do not consider subscribers with
legacy HDTV receivers. Since they are not conﬁgured to have
multiple layers in the UHD program, a single-frequency band
and DVB-S2 CCM mode are used in the scenarios. Therefore,
these scenarios do not support backward compatibility because
they require video coding technology higher than H.264/AVC
HP@5.1 proﬁle to deal with the 4K frame resolution of the
video. These scenarios include two types of scenarios, which
are classiﬁed according to which video codec is used for
the UHD program compression. The single layered scenario
system is expected to be the most appropriate system for
the initial UHD satellite test broadcasting because it does
not aﬀect the current on-air services if the frequency band
is properly selected.
B. Multiple layered scenarios
In multiple layered scenarios, each program is transmitted
at diﬀerent layers with diﬀerent protection levels to provide
adaptive service in a channel variation environment. To this
end, the base layer stream and enhancement layer stream are
constructed from one program. For the sake of convenience,
in this paper a low-quality video stream is called a base
layer stream, and a high-quality video stream is called an
enhancement layer stream. The base layer stream and enhance-
ment layer stream can be generated by either way of SVC
or simulcasting scheme. In addition, each layered stream can
be transmitted in diverse ways depending on the transmission
mode and target frequency band.
In the ﬁrst step, multiple layered scenarios are classiﬁed
depending on their backward compatibility possibility. To

simulcasting scheme, and [T]: Transmission mode of DVB-S2 technology, where N/A denotes that the service scenario is not able to meet
the corresponding conditions.
*It is assumed that SVC coding with H.264 would not support UHD resolution, and thus the enhanced layer of SVC in the scenarios is
generated by only HEVC video coding. It is also assumed that the SVC with HEVC supports both H.264 and HEVC for its base layer
stream.
support backward compatibility to the current HDTV service
in Korea, the scenario should involve H.264/AVC and DVB-
S2 CCM mode for the base layer stream. Providing backward
compatibility with DVB-S2 CCM mode in a single band
is not considered in the paper because of its ineﬃciency.
Therefore, there are three scenarios that can provide backward
compatibility, as shown in Table IV. The base layer stream
used for HDTV service should be coded with the H.264/AVC
scheme of HP@4.1, and transmitted through the Ku band
frequency. In addition, the enhancement layer stream is trans-
mitted through the Ka band frequency using either H.264/AVC
of HP@5.1 or the HEVC coding schemes. Since these service
scenarios use dual-band transmission, each layer stream is
transmitted with DVB-S2 CCM mode, and the new UHDTV
receiver requires to have Ku/Ka dual-band signal reception
capability when the SVC scheme is considered. As for the non-
backward compatibility scenarios, the HEVC coding scheme
for the base layer stream and DVB-S2 VCM mode can
be considered for the scenario analysis. Both single-band
transmission and multiple-band transmission can be possible
because they can utilize DVB-S2 VCM mode to transmit
each layer stream with diﬀerentiating its protection level even
in single-band transmission. For the single-band transmission
scenarios, every combination of technology is technically
possible, while multiple codec scenarios for multiple band
transmission are not available because they are involved in
the backward compatibility scenario. As shown in Table IV,
it is assumed that only HEVC SVC usage is considered
because SVC in H.264 is hard to be practically applied.
H.264 SVC is currently not supported by most commercial
products, and HEVC SVC technology will be used later if
such functionality is thought to be needed. However, since
HEVC SVC technology is under standardization, it will take
time to appear on the market, and more importantly, it is not
clear at the moment whether the business market will demand
scalable video coding applications. Therefore, simulcasting
scenarios will be more reasonable for satellite broadcasting in
the near future if channel adaptability is required for the target
service, even though it is necessary to submit to a sacriﬁce in
bandwidth.

services
through the Ka band satellite have been conducted in past
years. In this experiments, only two service scenarios with
single band and single codecs with one of AVC and HEVC
schemes are applied, as shown in Fig. 2. The experiments were
conducted to evaluate the multi-channel service provisioning
with channel adaptibility for 4K UHD satellite broadcasting.
To meet the requirement, a high-speed DVB-S2 modem was
developed using VCM mode support. Most of the legacy DVB-
S2 modems are developed to support Ku band transponders of
around 30MHz providing 80Mbps of maximum capacity. Our
new modem extends this capacity upto around 300Mbps to
support wideband Ka band transponders, which are required
to provide multiple UHDTV channel services. In addition,
this modem supports all the MODCOD listed in the DVB-S2
standard with multiple TS interfaces functionality for VCM
transmission, and implemented with 0.3 dB margin in average
comparing to the ideal required C/N of each MODCOD. For
the channel adaptive service veriﬁcation, several combinations
of two MODCODs are selected that each combination can
serve more than 99.7% of their service availibilty.
According to the link budget analysis in Section III and
the experiment results, it turned out that this channel adaptive

functionality can be able to increase the service availability
by more than 7 hours per year. It is clear that the channel
adaptability is worthy of attention, especially in regions of
heavy rainfall. Moreover, it would be much more important in
applications in which the link should always be connected
between earth stations, such as for public protection and
disaster relief.
VI. Conclusion
This paper presented a variety of analyses on Ka band satel-
lite broadcasting service for immersive media, providing the
technological background for a veriﬁcation of satellite UHD
service commercialization. Rain attenuation modeling was per-
formed ﬁrst through the international standard method with the
domestic rainfall rate statistics, since the rain attenuation is the
most critical factor for satellite broadcasting in the Ka band.
Next, the satellite link performance was analyzed to determine
the most suitable transmission method for the service under
the local environment, and it turned out that the channel
adaptive functionality should be seriously considered for more
stable service continuation. The paper presents diverse feasible
service scenarios with the combinations of technologies which
are currently available and expected to be available in the near
future as well. Some of these combinations are open to discuss
in terms of economics. However, most of them are worth
taking into consideration since it is still vague about what will
be the correct answer in every element for UHD service. Since
technology developments will make rapid progress, it will
reduce the cost and make it possible to bring about much more
complicated scenarios in reality. Along with the service scenar-
ios, the result of satellite experiments which were conducted
for the preparation of satellite UHD broadcasting service in
Korea was presented. Thanks to these gradual developments
of service technologies, plans for satellite UHD broadcasting
service will materialize in the very near future as announced
by certain countries.
