Abstract—The experimental data used for system performance 
evaluation have many sources and multiple granularity. Thus, 
it is necessary to fuse multi-source experimental data for 
evaluation. Aiming at multi-source experimental data fusion 
problem, a multi-source experimental data fusion evaluation 
method based on Bayesian and evidence theory is proposed. 
According to the size of the data sample size, the large sample 
data are fused by the classical frequency method, while the 
small sample data are fused by Bayesian method. Then the 
parameter information is updated by the Bayesian method and 
data fusion result is obtained. The experimental data of 
different scenarios are fused by evidence theory. The evidence 
combination method is used to fuse the data when the evidence 
bodies do not conflict, while the weighted average correction 
method is used for data fusion when there is conflict between 
the 
evidence 
bodies. 
The 
result 
of 
the 
multi-source 
experimental data fusion is obtained based on Bayesian 
method and evidence theory.

INTRODUCTION 
As the complexity of the system increases, the 
performance evaluation of the system becomes more and 
more important [1]. The performance evaluation of the 
system is based on experimental data. However, only a small 
amount of measured data can be obtained because the cost of 
system real experiments is more and more expensive due to 
the use of high technology [2]. Besides, experimental data 
can be obtained through semi-physical simulation and digital 
simulation experiments. Therefore, the experimental data of 
performance evaluation have the characteristics of multi-
source, multi-capacity, multi-granularity and multi-type, etc., 
and it is necessary to fuse multi-source data and then conduct 
comprehensive evaluation. The concept of data fusion 
originated in the 1970s, first used in the military field [3], 
and later gradually applied to various non-military fields [4]. 
There is no uniform definition of data fusion, and researchers 
have given multiple definitions from different aspects. The 
typical definition is: data fusion is a multi-level and multi-
faceted data processing process that automatically detects, 
correlates, estimates and combines data from multiple 
sources [5]. 
Data fusion is applied to various theoretical knowledge 
and cutting-edge technologies, but no uniform algorithm is 
suitable for all scenarios due to its wide range of applications 
[6][7]. Data fusion method can be mainly divided into three 
categories: signal processing and estimation theory method, 
statistical inference theory method, and information theory 
method. The commonly used data fusion methods mainly 
include weighted average, classical reasoning, Bayesian 
fusion [8] and fuzzy theory. Aiming at the multi-source 
experimental data of performance evaluation, Bayesian 
method, as a commonly used method [9], can process data in 
the form of static probabilities and has good validity; 
evidence theory, second only to Bayesian method, has no 
requirement for data sample size and has good data fusion 
effect; classical reasoning method is also suitable for 
processing large sample size data and also has good validity; 
other commonly used data fusion methods, such as fuzzy 
theory, are applicable to processing experimental data. 
Aiming at multi-source experimental data, a data fusion 
method is proposed. In section 2, we analyze the 
characteristics of experimental data and the applicable 
conditions of Bayesian method and evidence theory. Then 
we propose a data fusion evaluation scheme based on the 
characteristics of experimental data. In section 3, data fusion 
method is introduced in detail. According to the sample data, 
multi-type Bayesian fusion can be divided in two cases and 
evidence theory fusion is also related to whether the 
evidence bodies are in conflict. In section 4, we present the 
conclusion of experimental data fusion method in system 
performance evaluation and the future work in next step.

MULTI-SOURCE EXPERIMENTAL DATA FUSION 
SCHEME
Experimental data used for system performance evaluation 
can be divided into measured data, semi-physical simulation 
data, digital simulation data, etc. The measured data and 
semi-physical simulation data are obtained through real 
experiments and semi-physical simulation respectively, 
while the digital simulation data are obtained by running the 
digital simulation system. Therefore, there are multiple types 
of data in the experimental data. Otherwise, the experimental 
data can also come from different experimental scenarios. 
The experimental scenario defines the scope and constrains 
of the problems studied in the system, variables, activities 
and interactive relations related to the experimental objects, 
etc., and it includes the setting and organization of all kinds 
of data in the system [10]. Thus, multi-source experimental 
data fusion problem can be divided into two aspects: one is 
38

the multi-type data fusion problem, and another is different 
experimental scenarios’ data fusion problem.  
Bayesian fusion method can process the data in the form 
of static probability and has no requirement on sample size, 
which is also the most efficient fusion method. Therefore, 
Bayesian method is considered for using to fuse multi-type 
data. For data fusion problem of different experimental 
scenarios, Bayesian fusion method is also considered for data 
fusion in order to ensure the validity of fusion results and the 
uniformity of methods. Because the experimental data are 
from different types of data under different scenarios, the 
posterior density 


,
   X
 is considered in Bayesian 
fusion, where parameter   and parameter   characterize the 
mean of the variables and different experimental scenarios 
respectively and X  is observation sample. However,  ’s 
posterior density 

  X 
 is focused on generally. The 
calculation of 

  X 
 needs the information about  
 
and 


|
  
. 
 
 
 is the parameter distribution of 
different experimental scenarios, which is easily to obtain, 
while 


|
    is conditional probability which is hard to 
obtain directly in the actual engineering application. 
Therefore, Bayesian method is not suitable for data fusion of 
different experimental scenarios. Evidence theory also has 
great advantages in data fusion and can process data of 
different types or different sample sizes. Thus, evidence 
theory is used to fuse data from different scenarios. 
Above all, Bayesian fusion method is suitable for multi-
type data fusion while evidence theory is suitable for fusing 
sample data from different scenarios. Thereout, the multi-
source experimental data fusion scheme based on Bayesian 
method and evidence theory is obtained (see Figure 1). That 
is, classify the multi-source experimental data firstly, fuse 
the multi-type data of the same experimental scenario using 
Bayesian data fusion method and then fuse the single data 
from different scenarios using evidence theory fusion 
method. Considering multi-type data mainly from simulation 
data, semi-physical simulation data and measured data, it is 
necessary to classify data before data fusion, perform data 
preprocessing for each type of data, and then fuse data. The 
simulation data have a large amount of data and low 
authenticity, and the classical frequency estimation method is 
used for data fusion. However, the semi-physical simulation 
data and the measured data have a small number of data, and 
Bayesian method is used. Then, regarding large sample 
frequency data fusion result and small sample Bayesian data 
fusion result as prior information and observation sample 
data, respectively, the Bayesian method is used to update the 
prior information parameters to obtain the multi-type data 
fusion results under the same scenario. After obtaining the 
multi-type data fusion results of each scenario, the evidence 
theory method is used to fuse data of different experimental 
scenarios. Firstly, model the sample data of each scenario 
and describe it as a form of evidence body. When the 
evidence bodies do not conflict, the conventional evidence 
body fusion method is used for processing; when the 
evidence bodies are in conflict, process using the weighting 
method and preprocess the conflict evidence before the 
evidence combination. Finally, multi-source experimental 
data fusion results are obtained.

scenarios. The description of these two data fusion methods

The principle of the Bayesian update method is described as 
follows. Assuming that parameter   is the mean of a 
variable, X  is observation sample and 
 
 
 is the prior 
density of parameter  . Then, the posterior density 

where   is the parameter space and

f

 is the 
likelihood function of X  given by  . From (1), we can see 
that the observation sample and the prior density of   are 
used to calculate the posterior density. In system 
performance evaluation, the measured data and the semi-
physical simulation data generally have small sample sizes, 
but the degree of authenticity is high, which can be used as 
the observation sample; the digital simulation data generally 
have large sample size, but the degree of authenticity is low, 
from which can obtain the prior density of  . Thus, digital 
simulation data, semi-physical simulation data and measured 
data need to be fused before Bayesian fusion. 
1)
Classical frequency fusion of large sample data 
Generally, digital simulation data are large sample data 
and classical frequency parameter estimation is widely used 
in data fusion under large sample conditions. Therefore, the 
large sample data are fused by the classical frequency 
method. Firstly, assume that there are n  independent 
sample data sets in the simulation data. Their estimated 
value of the same distribution parameter   is 

. Thus, the prior information of parameter

2)
Bayesian fusion of small sample data 
The measured data and the semi-physical simulation data 
may be small sample data, and Bayesian method is used to 
fuse small sample data. Assume that there are n  sets of the 
same type of prior information before the small sample data, 
which is compatible with small samples. The prior density 
i  

each set of prior samples, whose weight is

above we can see, the posterior distribution of   is fused by 
multiple posterior distributions when there is a variety of 
prior information and the weighted average of these 
posterior distributions is fusion posterior distribution. Then, 
the Bayesian fusion result of small sample data can be 
obtained. 
Finally, the large sample data fusion result and the small 
sample data fusion result are regarded as prior information 
and observation sample data, respectively. The Bayesian 
method is used to update the prior information parameters, 
and the obtained result is the multi-type data fusion result 
under the same experimental scenario. Furthermore, multi-
type data fusion results under different scenarios can be 
obtained. 
B.
Evidence Theory Fusion 
The experimental data used in performance evaluation 
mostly come from different experimental scenarios, which 
evidence theory fusion method is used to fuse. After 
obtaining multi-type data fusion results of different 
experimental scenarios, the sample data of each scenario are 
described as evidence body using evidence theory. The 
evidence combination method is adopted when the evidence 
bodies do not conflict, while the weighted average correction 
fusion method is adopted when the evidence bodies conflict. 
Then, the data fusion results of different experimental 
scenarios are obtained. 
1)
Evidence combination 
The evidence theory fusion criterion is used to synthesize 
the nonconflicting evidence bodies. This combination 
method is a strict AND operation method. The basic 
probability distribution of common focal elements of 
multiple belief functions is proportional to the respective 
basic probability distribution. Therefore, the evidence 
method has a focusing effect. This effect will strengthen 
support for common goals and weaken the impact of 
divergent goals. The principle of evidence combination is: if

2)
Weighted average correction fusion 
When evidence bodies are in high conflict, the result of 
combination is contrary to the common sense. The solutions 
to this problem can be mainly summarized into two 
categories: one is to modify the data fusion rules, and the 
other is to modify the data model and pre-process the conflict 
evidence before evidence combination. Because modifying 
the data fusion rules can lead to the destruction of the 
commutative law and associative law of Dempster's 
combination rule, the second solution conforms to the 
theoretical framework of the evidence theory method [11]. 
Weighted average correction method can reduce evidence 
conflict and guarantee the focusing effect of fusion to some 
extent. Thus, weighted average correction fusion method is 
used to deal with the contradictory evidence bodies. 
The principle of weighted average correction is as follows:

where

. 
Weighted average correction method can achieve the 
suppression of evidence conflict through using different 
weighting methods and comprehensively consider the 
information of multiple conflicting evidence bodies. 
Furthermore, this method reduces the evidence conflicts by 
weighting, which has been widely used in the fusion of 
conflicting evidence bodies. 
IV.
CONCLUSION 
In the performance evaluation, the experimental data need 
to be fused since it comes from digital simulation 
experiments, semi-physical simulation experiments and real 
experiments, etc., and it also comes from different 
experimental scenarios in some cases. The multi-source 
experimental data fusion problem is decomposed into multi-
type data fusion problem and data fusion problem under 
different experimental scenarios, where multi-type data 
fusion adopts Bayesian method and data fusion of different 
scenarios uses evidence theory method. In the case of multi-
type data fusion, the results obtained by the fusion of large 
sample data with the classical frequency method and the 
results obtained by the fusion of small sample data with the 
Bayesian method are respectively taken as prior information 
and observation sample data, and the Bayesian method is 
used to obtain the multi-type data fusion result. In the case of 
data fusion of different scenarios, each sample is described 
as the form of evidence body, and different data processing 
methods are adopted according to the relationship between 
the evidence bodies. The final result of multi-source 
experimental data fusion/is obtained through the proposed 
method. 
The proposed data fusion method is suitable for 
processing static data. In the next step, we will select the 
appropriate data using the proposed method and other 
existing methods to do experiments. Then, according to the 
experimental results, compare fusion results to verify the 
effectiveness of this method.
