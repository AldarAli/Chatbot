Abstract—Over the last several decades, shading devices such 
as blinds, louvers, roll shades, etc., have received much 
attention due to their roles as indoor environmental controllers 
(preventing 
glare, 
blocking 
shortwave 
radiation, 
and 
contributing to thermal comfort). In order to allow the 
aforementioned systems to act as true optimal controllers, a 
fast and accurate mathematical model that is able to predict 
the dynamic behavior  of the system is necessary. This paper 
describes the development of a lumped simulation model of an 
indoor blind system adjacent to double glazing (6 mm clear+12 
mm air + 6 mm low-e). This is typical of office building shading 
systems in Korea. Rather than attempting to develop the most 
detailed and accurate model of the system, the approach 
described in this paper is based on the postulated minimalistic 
model augmented with a parameter estimation technique. The 
lumped simulation model was validated with measurements 
obtained from an in-situ, full-scale experimental facility 
mounted on the south-facing façade. It was found that the 
calibration method delivers accurate results for the unknown 
parameters (convective heat transfer coefficients and air 
permeability of the shading device), allowing the calibrated 
lumped model to be used in ensuing optimal control and 
performance studies. 
Keywords-blind; lumped model; parameter estimation; 
calibration; validation.

INTRODUCTION 
Saving energy through architectural design is an 
important issue due to climate change and high oil prices. In 
particular, interests in building envelope design, control, and 
performance assessment are increasing due to the impacts on 
building energy and comfort. The latest trend in envelope 
systems is to increase window area for transparency and 
aesthetics. However, this leads to undesired heat gain/loss, 
assymetric discomfort, and an increased energy consumption. 
Therefore, shading devices are often adopted to reduce the 
aforementioned problems. Shading devices installed indoors, 
outdoors, or in cavities have several effects on indoor 
environmental 
conditions 
(preventing 
glare, 
blocking 
shortwave radiation, and contributing to thermal comfort).  
The development of simulation model, optimal control, 
and energy performance assessment studies for the following 
three envelope systems are now in progress by the authors. 
System I is a generic type used in a curtain wall system. 
Systems II and III are examples of the double-skin with 
different configuration (cavity depth, blind slat, etc.) 
 
System I: double glazing (low-e) + interior blind 
system (blind slat 50mm) 
 
System II: double-skin (50 mm cavity) system, blind 
slat 15mm 
 
System III: double-skin (200 mm cavity) system, 
blind slat 50mm 
In order to assess the energy performances of the systems, 
it is necessary to develop a simulation model. Obviuosly, the 
developed simulation model can be used later in optimal 
design and control studies. In particular, the simulation 
model should be able to predict the behavior of the system 
quickly and accurately in order to apply optimal control. 
There are three approaches to mathematically modeling a 
system: (1) the use of a 3D, full-blown model, (2) the use of 
a whole building simulation tool (Energy Plus, Esp-r, 
TRNSYS [1], IDA ICE [2], TAS [3], etc.), and (3) the use of 
a lumped simulation model.  
The first approach divides the system into small nodes in 
the form of a grid, and then mathematically expresses the 
heat and mass transfers that appear in each node. While this 
approach has the advantage of precisely modeling the 
airflow dynamics and temperature distribution around the 
system, the mathematical modeling requires numerous 
assumptions as well as detailed information. For these 
reasons, the uncertainty of its simulation results might 
increase. 
The second approach is to use a general-purpose tool 
developed for analyzing performance of a whole building. 
While this approach is advantageous in terms of assessing 
the influence of the envelope system on the performance of 
the entire building, it has a limited ability to express in detail 
the physical phenomena that involve transient convective 
and radiant heat transfer and airflow movement in and 
around the system. It is difficult to make accurate predictions 
about the airflow movement in a cavity [4], and it is not easy 
to apply modern control strategies (Pontryagin's minimum 
principle [5], the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation [5], a 
Riccati equation [5]), to any shading installed device (control 
of louver slat angles, ventilation dampers in the cavity, etc. 
because of high nonlinearity of the system.  
The third approach is to express the fundamental heat 
transfer phenomenon in a system as one-dimensional (1D) in 
36

a lumped fashion. As a result, this model has the advantage 
of fast calculations. For real-time performance optimization 
of a system, this approach can be applied for optimal control 
and performance assessment. In other words, it is possible to 
optimize and assess system performance by determining the 
optimal variables in real-time [6]. 
The purpose of the paper is to present the initial 
development of the System I (Fig. 1) among the 
aforementioned three systems. In this study, the third 
approach was employed and the heat transfer and airflow 
movement are expressed in a 1D state-space equation. The 
lumped simulation model was calibrated using the parameter 
estimation technique. Next, it was experimentally validated 
with the test facility described in the following section.  
This paper reports the following three processes for 
development of the lumped simulation model of System I. 
 
Step 1 (mathematical modeling): modeling complex 
heat transfer and airflow movement in the system 
 
Step 2 (calibration): estimating unknown parameters 
in the model 
 
Step 3 (validation): comparing simulated results with 
measurements. 
II. 
EXPERIMENT SETUP 
An experimental test facility of the system was 
constructed in an actual building as shown in Fig. 2. The 
installed system faces true South and the window was double 
glazing (6 mm clear glazing + 12 mm air space + 6 mm low-
e glazing), and the blind was placed adjacent to the indoor 
glazing. The blind was 10 cm from the surface of the interior 
pane, its height was 150 cm from the bottom to the top of the 
pane, and the width of the blind slat was 5 cm. The control of 
the slat angle was performed by an electric motor.

humidity was measured using a hygrometer (M-RSA, HOBO 
inc.). T-type thermocouples were installed at three points 
vertically, as shown in Fig. 3, to measure glazing surface, 
gap air, and indoor temperatures. The data were collected 
using a National Instrument data logger.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL 
In order to describe the dynamics of the indoor blind 
system, the governing heat and mass transfer phenomena 
were studied as follows: 1) direct, diffuse, and reflected solar 
radiation; 2) long wave radiation between surfaces; 3) 
convective heat transfer along the exterior and interior 
glazing surfaces and blind slats; and 4) air movement 
through the gap (between the glazing and the indoor blinds). 
In this study, the heat transfer and airflow phenomena in 
the system were described in a lumped fashion. The essence 
of the lumped model is based on the assumption that the 
temperature of the solid is spatially uniform at any instant 
during the transient process [7]. With this in mind, a one-
dimension model without a temperature gradient was 
assumed (Fig. 4) in order to describe the simplified dynamics 
of a three-dimensional (3D) system. x1-x5 are state variables 
which represent the temperature at each point in Fig. 4. 
Although this approach does not render explicit information 
about the vertical and horizontal temperature gradients, it is 
assumed to be sufficient to represent the overall thermal 
characteristics of any indoor blind system and, in particular, 
to determine the optimal control actions. This assumption 
has to be substantiated by experiments and will be described 
later in the paper. 
For the details of the grey-box approach and the thermal 
model, see [8] [9]. 
This paper gives a detailed account of the airflow 
occurring in the gap shown in Fig. 4. The size of the space 
between the blind tip and the window (gap in Fig. 4) has an 
effect on the energy performance of the system [10]. 
Therefore, the gap is equated with a cavity in this study. 
 
 
Figure 4.   Simplified system (● = state variables, x1= outer glazing 
temperature of the double-pane, x2= inner glazing temperature of the 
double-pane, x3= louver slat temperature, x4= cavity air temperature in the 
double-pane, x5= air temperature in the gap). 
Airflow in the gap is caused by a difference between the 
gap temperature (
Tgap
) and the indoor air temperature (
Tin
). 
The effects of the blinds (blind slat angle, distance from the 
glazing surface, etc.) also affect this airflow. The presence of 
the blind has a strong effect on the heat transfer from the 
indoor glazing. Moreover, when blind slats are fully closed 
(90°), the air velocity and convective transfer are promoted 
by the fully closed cavity effect [10]. 
In general, the airflow speed in the gap (Fig. 4) can be 
expressed in (1) [11] [12].

COMPARISON BETWEEN SIMULATED AND PRIMARY 
MEASURED VALUES 
For a comparison of the simulated and measured values, 
the first experiment was conducted for about 108 hours (Jul 
27, 2009 - Aug 30, 2009). The data were recorded with a 
sampling time of one minute, and the number of measured 
data points was 6,412 (6,412 minutes = four days, ten hours, 
and 52 minutes). During the experiment, the internal 
temperature of the laboratory was set to 24 °C, and the slat 
angle (0° = horizontal, 45° = facing the floor, 90° = vertical) 
was changed randomly, as shown in Fig. 5 (c). Fig. 5 (a) and 
(b) show the recorded indoor and outdoor air temperatures 
and the solar radiation.

Table 1 shows the differences between the measured 
temperatures and predictions from the un-calibrated 
simulation model that use literature values of the convective 
heat transfer coefficients ( h ) and air permeability of the 
shading device (
h
A ) [7] [11] [13]. It should be noted that the 
air temperature (x4) of the small cavity in the double-pane 
was not measured.  
As shown in Table 1, the temperature difference between 
the simulation and measurement was 1.91 °C. Considering a 
degree of details of the lumped model, the un-calibrated 
model 
has 
an 
unexpected 
accuracy 
(the 
T-type 
thermocouples used in the experiments had an accuracy 
range of ±0.5 °C). The differences between the simulated 
and measured values result from the unknown parameters of 
the model, the assumptions used in the modeling process, 
and the simplifications of the physical phenomena in the 
system (3D→1D).

Table 2 shows the convective heat transfer coefficient 
values of the un-calibrated model. In the case of the 
convective heat transfer coefficients (Table 2), the literature 
values [7] [14] [15] [16] are derived empirically from 
experiments under specific conditions (vertical walls instead 
of windows). The convective heat transfer coefficients are 
influenced greatly by surface roughness  and geometry, 
system geometry (height, width, etc.), the local environment 
and the nature of the air motion. For these reasons, they 
should be calibrated to fit to the test unit (

,

The air permeability of the shading device (
h
A ) depends 
on the blind slat angle, and it is difficult to measure accurate 
air permeability . Even in the fully closed position (vertical, 
90°), there is air permeability through openings between 
blind slats. Such air permeability has an influence on airflow 
in the gap.  
Thus, the unknown parameters related to the convective 
heat transfer coefficients and the airflow must be identified 
with a suitable parameter estimation technique based on 
extensive data points obtained from experiments. This will 
be discussed in the following sections. 
V. 
CALIBRATION 
The parameter estimation technique is used to determine 
unknown parameters that minimize the differences between 
the actual measurements and the simulation predictions [8]. 
This approach is used to estimate values that cannot be 
calculated analytically or measured directly. The parameter 
estimation technique can be expressed as the minimization of 
the objective function ( S ), as in (5).

In this study, the aforementioned convective heat transfer

parameters. 
Equation (1) is orginally developed for the shade layer 
(e.g., roll shades) and needs calibration to be used for the 
indoor blind system installed in the experimental unit. In 
other words, air permeability of the shading device should be 
estimated because it cannot be calculated exactly, and it 
should be determined based on the blind slat angle. The 
selected unknown parameters are expressed in the following 
equations.

Equation (6) is empirically driven for the convective heat

Equations (8) and (9) are mathematical representations of the 
convective heat transfer coefficients in the gap, and they are 
expressed as functions of airflow velocity and temperature 
difference (the pane surface and gap air temperatures). 
Simply put, Equations (8) and (9) can be read as a 
consideration of the convective effects according to airflow 
velocity and temperature difference. 
The air permeability of the shading device (
h
A ) from (2) 
and (3) was expressed in (10) and also reflects the changes 
due to the blind slat angle (
slat
).  
The

LSQNONLIN 
in 
the 
MATLAB 
optimization toolbox was used to solve (5). LSQNONLIN is 
specially suited for this kind of constrained nonlinear 
optimization problem. The values of the unknown 
parameters were numerically estimated using LSQNONLIN. 
Table 3 shows the estimated convective heat transfer 
coefficients. There are considerable differences in convective 
heat transfer coefficients between the un-calibrated (Table 2) 
and calibrated models (Table 3). The calibrated value (
hout
) 
in Table 3 is similar to the summer conditions in [15] (Table 
2). 
For 
hca,1
, the estimated values were greater than those in 
the literature because the literature values are derived 
empirically from experiments under specific conditions (both 
ends of the wall are insulated, allowing for only horizontal 
heat flow). In other words, the literature values do not take 
into consideration the lateral heat loss that occurs in the 
cavity, and they are usually valid for solid walls, but not for 
transparent glazing. 
For 
hca, 2
, the estimated values were also greater than 
those calculated from the literature.  
In counterpoint to the literature value for the shading 
layer, our study took into account variations in the airflow 
based on the blind slats. The differences in 
hca, 2
 were due to 
uncertain air movement in the gap (Tables 2, 3). 
hca, 3
 was 
close to that of the literature.

) were 
applied to the simulation model and compared with the 
measured values (Fig. 6, Table 4). After calibration, the 
average difference between the simulated and measured 
temperatures was 1.13 °C (Table 4). It is clear from the 
results that the accuracy of the calibrated model was 
improved compared to that of the un-calibrated model. 
Furthermore, the estimated air permeability of the shading 
device depends on the blind slat angle (Table 5). The 
h

slat angles of  = 45° (facing the floor) was greater than the 
h
A  for slat angles of  = 0° (horizontal). The

using the calibrated results implies explicit conditions about

the influence of the air permeability and the airflow 
configuration based on the slat angles and the impact of the 
convective heat transfer at the indoor glazing surface. That is, 
an ascending airflow is promoted by buoyancy (compared 
with the horizontal conditions) when  =45°. This effect 
increases the convective heat transfer adjacent to the internal 
glazing surface.

VALIDATION 
Validation processes were performed to determine 
whether the calibrated model was capable of accurately 
predicting the system’s response. To validate the model, the 
second experiment was conducted for about 132 hours (Aug 
1, 2009 - Aug 6, 2009). The data were recorded with a 
sampling time of one minute, and the number of measured 
data points was 7,874 (7,874 minutes = five days, 11 hours, 
14 minutes). The measured values were compared with the 
predicted values from the calibrated model. Fig. 7 shows the 
recorded indoor and outdoor air temperatures and the solar 
radiation.

variables. The overall average temperature differences were 
1.27 °C. Considering the accuracy range (±0.5 °C) of the 
thermocouples (Omega T-type), the calibrated model proved 
surprisingly accurate in the prediction of the most relevant 
state variables.

Fig. 9 shows the air velocity (
vgap
) in the gap calculated 
using (1). The average air velocity was 15 cm/s, with a 
maximum value of 36 cm/s.  
Considering the air velocity in the gap, the convective 
heat transfer phenomenon depends on airflow movements in 
the gap. In other words, air velocity is influenced by gap size 
and configuration. This indicates the need of model 
calibration based on the system configuration and the 
components in envelope system.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This study attempted to develop a simplified model for 
real-time optimal control and performance assessment of an 
indoor blind system. The unknown parameters in the 
mathematical model were estimated using a parameter 
estimation technique. The model was validated, implying 
that the mathematical model developed for this study is 
capable of accurately predicting system response. Based on 
the results of this study, the following conclusions can be 
made.  
 
Use of the lumped model: 3D modeling of heat 
transfer and airflow movement in a system is 
complicated, but the lumped model, expressed in 
one-dimension (1D), is a practical approach for 
predicting system behavior. Evidently, the 1D 
lumped model is also able to express the behavior of 
a system using a calibration technique. 
 
The unknown parameters: the un-calibrated model 
(using values from the literature) can be improved 
into a more accurate calibrated model using the 
parameter estimation technique. Namely, it was 
shown that there are limitations in developing a 
simulation model based solely on the parameters 
from the literature. 
 
Performance assessment and real-time optimal 
control: the simulation run-time was as short as 
several seconds using the calibrated model. The 
lumped model has the advantages of fast calculation, 
flexibility, etc., for emulating optimal control. The 
lumped simulation model can be applied to 
performance assessment and real-time optimal 
control. 
 
The airflow movement in the gap: it is necessary to 
consider airflow movement in the gap if a slat-type 
of indoor blinds are installed. Air permeability of the 
shading device (
Ah
) was estimated using the 
parameter 
estimation 
technique 
and 
was 
consequently adjusted according to the blind slat 
angle. Thus, the size and component of the gap are 
always of concern for modeling indoor blind systems 
since the airflow movement in the gap also changes 
with the blind slat angle. 
 
Based on the results of this study, following studies are 
on-going. 
 
 
Optimal control and performance assessment: 
optimal control and performance assessment in 
cooling, heating, and intermediate modes,  under 
differentweather conditions (clear, overcast), and 
orientations. 
 
Integrating of the lumped model with a whole 
building simulation model: the lumped model is 
applied to optimal control study, and the whole 
building simulation model is used to confirm the 
effect of the optimal control on the whole building 
energy performance.

 
Applicability of the lumped model: the mathematical 
model of the double-skin system should be 
calibrated according to system configuration, local 
environment, components such as cavity width, 
cavity depth, cavity height, louver materials 
(reflectance, color, thickness, width, and geometric 
size), glazing type, etc. [9]. Subsequently, it is 
necessary to investigate the applicable range of the 
lumped model.
