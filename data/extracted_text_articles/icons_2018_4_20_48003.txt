Abstract—This article presents the dynamic analysis of a
single-stage
vapor-compression
refrigeration
system.
The
model is based on the development of submodels for each
component of the refrigeration system, applying the space state
approach. The developing and verification of dynamic models
for different configurations of thermal systems is critical in
order to design control algorithms with optimal energy
consumption. This analysis culminates with the comparison
between direct performance of the refrigerant R134a as
working
fluid
and
the
behavior
temperature
of
the
compartment in a refrigerator and the results obtained are
similar in the evaporator temperature and pressure.
Keywords-Heat exchangers; Refrigerants; Dynamic Model;
Household refrigeration.

INTRODUCTION
Refrigeration and air conditioning is an active, rapidly
developing technology. It is closely related to the living
standard of the people and to the outdoor environment, such
as through ozone depletion and global warming.
Mathematical modeling is the most practical way of
studying the basic behavior of cycle performance, the
relative losses in various components and interactions of
their performance characteristics. Standard science and
engineering
formulations
are
applied
to
describe
mathematically the basics processes occurring in the Vapor
Compressor Refrigerating (VCR) systems. Mathematical
modeling is not an end in itself but is a step towards
simulation optimization.
The dynamic modeling of VCR system has been subject
on interest since the late 1970s, where first principle models
were used to describe the heat exchangers. Lumped
parameters, moving boundary models [1]-[3], and then
McArthur initiated a series of works focus on a distributed
parameters formulation [4]. Besides this main modeling
stream, other authors have designed more complex model
for analyzing specific phenomena but we refer to review of
[5] and to subsequent works and the references therein
[6][7]. Later on in 1990s traditional feedback control has
also been investigated, as in [8] and, more recently,
multivariable
control
strategy
have
been
developed,
[6][7][9][10]; in other studies, Jensen and Skogestad 2007a,
b [11][12], strategies are developed to select among the
degrees of freedom the controlled and the control variables
so that an optimal operation is nearly obtained.
Given that thermal dynamics of VCR systems are
typically slower than the mechanical dynamics, the bulk of
the
model
complexity
generally
resides
in
the
heat
exchangers. Previous literature reviews [13][14] indicated
that the bulk of the research efforts is focused on capturing
two-phase flow dynamics in the heat exchangers while
seeking a balance between simplicity and fidelity. For the
purpose of this article, the four elements of the system will
be classified into lumped parameters models. Lumped
parameter models refer to models that apply lumped
parameter assumptions to the entire heat exchanger or to
particular fluid phases within the heat exchanger (i.e.
individual lumped models for superheated vapor, two-phase
fluid, and subcooled liquid), in this article, the term “lumped
parameter model” includes approaches that model the heat
exchanger as single-control volume or multiple (time-
invariant) control volumes for each fluid phase. Most of the
publications in the lumped parameter classification are early
efforts, where computational simplicity is paramount to
ensure feasible computation times, motivating modeling
efforts with few dynamics equations and few (lumped)
parameters [15].
Many analytical models are used to simulate steady-state
performance of refrigeration systems, but do not predict
performance during transient operation. This paper presents a
method for predicting the cooling performance of VCR
systems during transient and various ambient conditions
based on established steady-state performance. In this work,

we adopt a dynamic model of refrigeration system similar
[16] but this is simplest with only four control volume.
This research is carried out in CIDESI Queretaro, for the
National Laboratory for Cooling Technologies Research
(LaNITeF).
The rest of the paper is structured as follow. In Section II,
we review refrigeration cycle principles. Section III presents
an explanation of model linearized on VCR systems. Section
IV describes the balance of mass and energy of each element
of the system, then the four ordinary differentials equations
are modeling in Simulink of Matlab. Section V describes the
validation of the modeling. Conclusions are found in Section
VI.

REFRIGERATING SYSTEMS
Vapor-compressor
refrigerating
systems
used
with
modern refrigerators vary considerably in capacity and
complexity, depending on the refrigerating application. They
are
hermetically
sealed
and
normally
require
no
replenishment of refrigerant or oil during the appliance’s
useful life. Systems components must provide optimum
overall performance and reliability at minimum cost. In
addition, all safety requirements of the appropriate safety
standard (e.g., IEC Standard 60335-2-24; UL Standard 250)
must be met. The fully halogenated refrigerant R-12 was
used in household refrigerators for many years. However,
because of its strong ozone depletion property, appliance
manufacturers have replaced R-12 with environmentally
acceptable R134a or isobutene.
Design of refrigerating systems for refrigerators and
freezers has improved because of new refrigerants and oils,
wider use of aluminum, and smaller and more efficient
motors, fans, and compressors. These refinements have kept
the vapor-compression system in the best competitive
position for household application.
A.
Refrigerating circuit
Figure 1 shows the refrigeration cycle on p-h diagrams.
The refrigerant evaporates entirely in the evaporator and
produces the refrigerating effect. It is then extracted by the
compressor at state point 1, compressor suction, and is
compressed isentropically from state point 1 to 2. It is next
condensed to liquid in the condenser, and the latent heat of
condensation is rejected to the heat sink.
The liquid refrigerant, at state point 3, flows through and
expansion valve, which reduces it to the evaporating
pressure. In the ideal vapor compressor cycle, the throttling
process at the expansion valve is the only irreversible
process, usually indicated by a dotted line. Some of the
liquid flashes into vapor and enters the evaporators at state
point 4. The remaining liquid portion evaporates at the
evaporating temperature, thus completing the cycle [17].
Note
that
energy
enters
the
systems
through
the
evaporator (heat load) and through the compressor (electrical
input). Thermal energy is rejected to the ambient by the
condenser and compressor shell. A portion of the capillarity
tube is usually soldered to the suction line to form a heat
exchanger. Cooling refrigerant in the capillarity tube with the
suction gas increases capacity and efficiency.
A strainer-drier is usually placed ahead of the capillarity
tube to remove foreign material and moisture. Refrigerant
charges of 150 g or less are common.
Figure 1.
Diagram enthalpy vs Pressure.
A thermostat (or cold control) cycles the compressor to
provide the desired temperatures in the refrigerator. During
the off cycle, the capillarity tube allows pressure to equalize
throughout the system [17][18].
III.
LINEARIZED MODEL
Considering the dynamic response of commercial coolers
based on vapor compression, various specialists have chosen
to simplify the dynamic model on the basis of its ability to
retain heat and the thermal resistance of its barriers [19][20].
These models consider the evaporator as a source of heat,
which can inject or extract energy from the thermodynamic
system to the inside of the cooler. Thus, C is considered as
the thermal capacity of the volume inside the cooler and R
heat resistance of its barriers, the linearized mathematical
model is established as:
 

T  R
T
dt
C dT
Q t
e
i
i
/



(1)
Where Q(t) is the heat injected or absorbed by the source
in this case the evaporator, Ti and Te are considered internal
and external temperatures respectively. The model is easily
recognizable as a first-order dynamic system and the
internal temperature depends on the motor compressor
angular speed, as shown in Figure 2.

In the same approach of the open-loop model, there are
several control strategies implemented to regulate the
internal temperature by applying a control law to manipulate
the compressor speed.
As is the case with the thermodynamic model, there are
several
efforts
where
basic
control
strategies
are
implemented to regulate the internal temperature of the
chiller based on the speed of the motor of the compressor
control, such strategies are tuned considering the parameters
of the linearized model [21][22]. A similar analysis is
employed to define the conditions of the drivers hysteresis,
[23][24]. A different approach found in literature, with
respect to the modeling of the dynamics of the vapor
compressor system implemented using heuristic algorithms,
the most typical tool in Neural Networks [25], fuzzy logic,
[26] and genetic algorithms [27]. The disadvantage of these
heuristic models is that their internal variables do not have
any physical interpretation, although very well solve the
problem of the internal temperature regulation whereas the
non-linearity which affects the performance of the model
linearized described above.
IV.
DYNAMIC MODEL OF THE VCR SYSTEM
A.
Energy Conservation Law
Because
the
refrigeration
cycle
of a
reciprocating
refrigerating system is a closed cycle, if the system is
operated
in
continuous
and
steady
state
(i.e.,
in
an
equilibrium state), according to the principle of continuity of
mass and energy balance, the mass flow rates of refrigerant
flowing through the evaporator, compressor, condenser and
expansion or float valve must all be equal. Also, the total
amount of energy supplied to the refrigeration system must
be approximately equal to the total energy rejected from the
system.
A continuous and steady state means that the flow is
continuous, and the properties of the refrigerant at any point
in the refrigeration system do not vary over time. Therefore,
during the design of a refrigeration system, the system
components selected should have equal or approximately
equal mass flow rates of refrigerant at stable conditions
[17][28].
A balance of energy (first law of thermodynamics),
combined with mass conservation in the control volume
provides the following equation;

The equation (2) Qis transferred to the system by the

the electric motor of the compressor, h is enthalpy function
that is associated with the sum of the internal energy and the
work flow, u + Pv, the linear kinetic energy
v 2 / 2
and
potential energy gravity gz of the fluid stream. The
subscripts i and o represent the conditions of entry and exit,
respectively. In the absence of appreciable variations of
kinetic and potential energy the equation above reduces to:
(3)
This relationship is grounded on the consideration that all
variables distributions along in the finite volume (control
volume) are homogeneous, and it is going to be applied for
each one of the control volume from the four stage of the
refrigeration cycle. In this equation,
r
m
is the mass of
refrigerant in circulation, cpi is the specific heat of the
refrigerant
at
room
temperature,
which
is
considered
constant, (Table 1). QPi represents the heat loss or heat
generated by the system and corresponds to the Newton’s
law of cooling, dT/dt is the speed with which the object cools
for this analysis represents the change in temperature of the
refrigerant, [29].

In the volume control 1, CTi is the thermal capacitance to
the interior of the space confined to the evaporator element
and for other elements is the capacitance of the material,
which can be also expressed CTi = mcp, thus, m is the mass of
the elements and cp,m is considered the heat capacity of the
material with which is manufactured elements, Ti is the
temperature inside the system, and Ta is the ambient
temperature. This model enthalpy is considered like ideal

defined according the average of the phase in regard on p vs

Considering the thermodynamic cycle starts-up when the
system is powered by the angular speed of the electric motor
of the compressor, the flow of the refrigerant quickly tends
to a permanent state, it can be noted that the refrigerant tends
to decrease its temperature at the evaporator element, trying
to keep the relationship of equilibrium of Pressure and
Temperature [31].

start-up period, during the first 5 minutes, the pressure
below from 6.5 bars to 2.2 bars, and then it tends to decrease
slowly until to reach steady state operation.

CONCLUSION
In the present work, a methodology has been developed
to model transient behavior of the refrigerator. This would
act as foundation to transient model of domestic refrigerator,
using lumped transient model. This methodology, based on
lumped parameters model will reduce the overall cycle time
in predicting the transient compartment temperature and will
also decrease the experimental effort.
The results presented in this paper agree qualitatively
with
temperature
time
evolution
shown
other
papers.
Calculation for transient analysis of domestic refrigerators,
obtained with the computer program here presented, will
further validate with experimental data in near future.
Therefore, it is considered that it is a good starting point
for the study of cooling systems applying state variables. The
first strategy will be the vector by the feedback of states
since becoming a linear approximation; however, you can
see that there are nonlinearities, so it is contemplated in the
near future to implement an algorithm control parameters
identification and adaptive control, which will be validated
with experimentation in the facilities of LaNITeF.
