Abstract— Long Term Evolution is standardized by the 3rd 
Generation Partnership Project to have wider channels up to 
20MHz, with low latency and packet optimized radio access 
technology. The peak data rate envisaged for LTE is 100 Mbps 
in downlink and 50 Mbps in the uplink. The 3GPP has chosen 
the OFDMA as the radio access technology due to his simple 
implementation in receiver and spectral efficiency. To enhance 
system’s data rate and ensure quality of service, the Radio 
Resource Management Scheduling Mechanisms plays a very 
crucial components to guarantee the Quality of Service 
performance for different services. In this paper we modeled 
and evaluated the performance of Round Robin, Proportional 
Fairness 
and 
Max

algorithms. 
The 
performances are compared in term in throughput and 
fairness index for this scheduler.

 INTRODUCTION  
The Long Term Evolution (LTE) is standardized by the 
3GPP in Release 8, as the successor of the Universal Mobile 
Telecommunication System (UMTS), in order to ensure a 
high speed data transmission with mobility for mobile 
communication. The radio access technology chosen for 
LTE system is the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple 
Access (OFDMA), in both Time Division Duplexing (TDD) 
and Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD), because of the 
high degree of flexibility in the allocation of radio resources 
to the Users Equipments (UEs) and his robustness to the 
selectivity of multipath channels [1][2]. LTE is capable of 
supporting 
different 
transmission 
band 
of 
spectrum 
allocation (Multiple Channel Bandwidth), ranging from 1.4 
Mhz to 20 Mhz, for both paired and unpaired bands. The 
high peak transmission rate reaches the LTE system is 100 
Mbps in downlink (DL) and 50 Mbps in uplink (UL). To 
achieve the performance objectives, LTE employs the 
several enabling technologies which include Hybrid 
Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) technical and different 
MIMO transmission methods are deployed [3] [4]. 
LTE technology presents a very challenging multiuser 
problem: Several User Equipments (UEs) in the same 
geographic area require high data rates in a ﬁnite bandwidth 
with low latency. Multiple access techniques allow UEs to 
share the available bandwidth by allocating to each UE a 
fraction of the total system resources. The strong motivation 
beyond the resource allocation algorithms for scheduling is 
the improvement of system performance by increasing the 
spectral efficiency at the wireless interface and consequently 
enhancing the system capacity. Other constraints such as 
fairness must also be improved. Hence, it is important to ﬁnd 
away to performance effective trade-off between efficiency 
and fairness. To develop an efficient scheduler to reach this 
trade-off, several factors must be taken into account such as: 
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), packet 
delays, buffer status (queues length and packet delays), and 
type of service, fairness, channel conditions and complexity 
(time and computing). 
In this paper, we study and compare the different 
scheduling algorithms for downlink LTE system and we 
discuss the factors which mentioned earlier for several 
proposed resources allocation schemes. This paper is 
organized as follow: in Section II, we describe the LTE 
downlink scheduling mechanism and in Section III, we 
evaluate and compare the algorithms performance. 
II. 
LTE DOWNLINK SCHEDULING 
The air interface of LTE technology is based on OFDMA 
and SC-FDMA in the downlink and Uplink respectively to 
deliver the flexibility and increase data rate without 
additional bandwidth or increase transmit power. The base 
station (eNodeB) is the entity responsible for controlling the 
air interface between the network and user equipments. The 
data transmission in LTE system is organized as physical 
resources which are represented by a time-frequency 
resource grid consisting of Resources Blocks (RBs) which 
has a duration of 0.5 ms and a bandwidth of 180 KHz (12 
subcarriers spaced with 15 KHz). It is a straight forward to 
see that each RB has 12x7 = 84 resource elements in the case 
of normal cyclic prefix and 12x6 = 72 resource elements in 
the case of extended cyclic prefix. 
The scheduler entity have a role to assigns resources 
blocks every TTI, based on the channel condition feedback 
received from User Equipment in the form of Channel 
Quality Indicator (CQI) send by the UEs to the eNodeB, to 
indicate the data rate supported by the downlink channel. 
Every value of CQI, index in the range 1 to 15, corresponds 
to the highest Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) and 
the amount of redundancy included [12]. The corresponding

In LTE system, the resource allocation is done in time 
and frequency domain. In time domain, the downlink 
channel is divided into frame of 10ms each consists of 10 
subframes of 1 ms each referred to as Transmission Time 
Interval (TTI).  In frequency domain, the available system 
bandwidth is divided into sub-channels of 180 KHz, 
comprising of 12 consecutive equally spaced OFDM sub-
carriers of 15 KHz each. A time-frequency radio resource 
spanning over 0.5 ms slots in the time domain and over 180 
KHz sub-channel in the frequency domain is called Resource 
Block (RB) [5]. The number of resource blocks in the 
available bandwidth is called Resource grid.  Resource 
Element (RE) represents one OFDM subcarrier during one 
OFDM symbol interval. The number of RBs in a resource 
grid depends on the size of the bandwidth. The LTE operates 
in the bandwidth of 1.4 MHz up to 20 MHz, with number of 
RBs ranging from 6 to 100 respectively [5] [6]. 
A. LTE scheduling Mechanisms   
In wireless communications, specifically in LTE system, 
each user return a value of CQI to eNodeB every TTI 
corresponding to the channel state of the user i and the mean 
data rate supported by the channel at the time slit t. The 
scheduler is responsible for assigning the RBs in time and 
frequency domain resources to the different UEs under the 
CQI-received as a feedback from the UE by the BS. Every 
1ms the assignment of resources could change depending 
upon various factors including CQI for each user. In order to 
perform channel-aware packet scheduling, each eNodeB 
need to have the knowledge of Channel State Information 
(CSI) for each user, for all the RBs in the available 
bandwidth. The CSIs are derived based on channel gain, 
interference conditions and SINR estimation errors. In this 
paper, we discuss the major scheduling algorithms that are 
used by the LTE downlink schedulers, they are, Round 
Robin (RR), Proportional Fairness (PFS) and Max-Rate 
algorithms. These scheduling algorithms are described in 
the next section [7]. The Figure 1 describes the packet 
scheduling strategies. 
 
Figure 1.  LTE Scheduling Scenario. 
 
The LTE downlink scheduler is designed to ensure high 
Quality of service (QOS), maximization of system capacity, 
reducing complexity and ensures fairness between all active 
users. Then, scheduling algorithms should be capable to 
exploit the channel variation condition with maintaining 
fairness between the users flows.  
B. LTE scheduling Algorithms   
In LTE system, the scheduling algorithms assume that 
the eNodeB would receive the CQI feedback, every TTI, as a 
matrix with dimensions Number_UEs x RB_grid_size. The 
value of each field in the matrix is the CQI feedback of each 
user for each RB [6]. The different scheduling algorithms are 
describes as follow:  
 
Round Robin (RR) is the simplest scheduling 
algorithm which assigns time interval to each mobile 
station in equal portion and in order with the same 
priority. This algorithm is very simple and easy to 
implement [14].  
 
Proportional Fairness Algorithm (PFS) work as 
follow. The CQI feedback of user k in time TTI i is 
in term of a requested data rate Rk,n (t), which design 
the kth user’s sub-carrier can currently supported. 
The PFS algorithm keep track of the average 
throughput Tk,n (t) of each user on every sub-carrier 
in a past window of length tc. The tc parameters 
means the trade-off between fairness and throughput. 
The larger value of tc is tc =∞, in this situation the 
allocation resources according to PFS algorithm is 
decided solely by instantaneous SNR, leading to 
maximum system throughput and poor fairness 
characteristics. On the other hand, the lower value of 
tc parameter is tc =1 in this situation scheduling 
becomes fair [8] [9].  In the time slot t, the PFS 
algorithm transmits at each sub-carrier to the user K 
with the largest value of J calculated as follow:

T,(t)                                     (1) 
The average throughput Tk,n (t) can be updated using an 
exponentially weighted low-pass filter [13] :

 
Max-Rate scheduler transmit, every TTI, to the user 
having the largest SNR, so users that have the fading 
peak are likely to be scheduled all the time, while 
other that experience deep fades are not scheduler at 
all. Max Rate scheduler has to maximize system 
throughput but it totally ignores fairness. The 
received SNR of the nth RB signal of the kth user at 
the tthTTI can be expressed by[8]:  
SNR,(t) = S, (t)  H, (t)

Where ,  (!) , ",  (!)  are the allocated transmission 
power and channel gain on nth sub-carrier at tth TTI 
respectively, N0 is the power spectral density of AWGN, B is 
the bandwidth and N is the number of sub-carriers. 
The instant data rate of each user is determined and the 
BS serves each user at this rate. The instant service rate on 
the nth sub-carrier at tth TTI is got by: 
R,(t) = B N 
⁄
Log&(1 + SNR)                      (4) 
Where, (,  (!) is the kth user transmission rate at tth time 
slot, B is the total bandwidth and N is the number of sub-
carriers [10] [11]. 
PFS algorithm transmits for each user when its channel is 
good and at the same time the scheduling algorithm is 
perfectly fair on the long term. We plot in Fig. 2 the 
frequency response of three users. Thus, the PFS algorithm 
schedules a user when its instantaneous channel quality is 
high relative to its own average channel condition over the 
time scale tc.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSS  
A. Simulation Parameters 
In this section, we will simulate and discuss the 
performance of the three scheduling algorithms, such as RR, 
PFS and Max-Rate, over LTE system. The simulations are 
carried out for frequency-selective channels modeled by ITU 
for Pedestrian-B (Ped-B) channels.  Our simulations are 
performed for users ranging from 5 to 25, choosing the 
bandwidth of 5MHz containing 25 RBs and 300 occupied 
sub-carriers. The simulations parameters used are listed in

Figure 4.  Means allocated RBs per frame for each user using RR, PFS 
and Max Rate schedulers. 
Figures 3 and 4 show the evolution of allocated RBs 
versus time and means number of RBs per frame, 
respectively, allocated  for each user using RR, PFS and 
Max-Rate algorithms. From the simulation results, we can 
see that the RR scheduler delivers fairness for all users with 
allocates the same number of RBs for each user which have 
50 Resources Block each frame. But, Max-Rate scheduler 
allocates a different number for each user derived from 
channel quality SNR to maximize average system 
throughput. The PFS scheduler tries to strike a balance 
between fairness and achieving the Maximum throughput by 
allocation almost equal means RBs for each user every TTI. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Number of allocated RBs for each user vs. TTI index using RR, 
PFS and Max Rate schedulers. 
The system fairness for scheduling algorithms versus 
users ranging from 5 to 25 is investigated in Fig. 5. It is also 
observed that Max rate is the unfairness algorithm and the 
index fairness not exceed 0.6. This is because the Max rate 
algorithm allocates the system resources to users who have a 
strongest channel and serve the users who are demanding 
service in system. But as we can see, the PFS scheduler has a 
constant fairness index almost equal to 1 because as we saw 
in section II, with a low tc parameter this algorithm 
maintenance index fairness without involving system 
throughput.

Figure 7.  System Throughput versus user using RR, PFS and Max Rate 
schedulers 
In order to compare the different scheduling algorithms, 
we simulate and plot the average throughput for each user 
and system throughput versus users ranging from 5 to 25. 
We can see that the system throughput achieved by RR 
algorithm reaches the lowest value because this algorithm 
allocates all sub-carriers to one user at each time slot 
independently of users’ channel response and rate 
requirements. But Max Rate algorithm, according to system 
throughput, reaches the best result because this algorithm 
allocates system resources to users with the strongest channel 
and it maximizes the system throughput. PFS algorithm 
exploits the propagation channel condition in order to 
maximize system capacity without comprising fairness. As 
we can see in Figs. 6 and 7, PFS algorithm has a good 
behavior because it reaches a good level of system 
throughput. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we present the performances of three 
scheduling algorithms such as Round Robin, Proportional 
Fairness and Max Throughput in term of fairness and system 
capacity. We can see that the RR scheduler promotes priority 
to fairness between all users regardless of system throughput. 
On the other hand, Max throughput is used to maximize the 
system capacity without considering the fairness among 
users. But, from the results obtained, it is also observed that 
the proportional fairness algorithm performs a compromise 
between system fairness and throughput. From this result, we 
can use a mixed between PFS and Max Throughput 
scheduler to maximize system throughput with guaranteed 
fairness between users.
