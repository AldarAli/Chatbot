Abstract—This paper presents the results from the creation of
advanced long-term knowledge resources. Focus goals are multi-
disciplinary knowledge documentation, discovery, and sustain-
ability. Application scenarios with complex knowledge architec-
tures require different computational workﬂows and resources.
The paper discusses comprehensive case studies with advanced
knowledge objects from archaeology and geosciences disciplines.
It delivers results and experiences on creating intelligent and
sustainable Integrated Information and Computing System com-
ponents and systems developed for more than twenty years. The
new universal knowledge resources and ﬂexible collaboration
framework allow multi-disciplinary documentation for any object
as well as advanced scientiﬁc computing access and enable
overall ﬂexibility for interfacing High End Computing resources,
which get increasingly important for integration, improving the
quality of result matrices, dynamical tasks and highly efﬁcient
discovery workﬂows and processes. This way, structured objects
and universal classiﬁcation are a central means for long-term
integration of information systems and supercomputing resources
with any kind of workﬂow and discipline.

INTRODUCTION
The more the demand increases for creating sustainable
and ﬂexible knowledge resources, the more we require long-
term conceptional and computational methods for discovery
in multi-disciplinary and heterogeneous resources [1]. Even
widely accessible common collections of information and data,
are missing reliability, validation, and long-term sustainability
– problems, which are passed far into the future with long-term
tasks. This is resulting from principle problems of implementa-
tion: There are no foundations of a suitable long-term strategy,
documentation, tools, and resources. This demands static and
dynamical components in all parts of an implementation.
Multi-disciplinary knowledge proﬁts from long-term doc-
umentation. Creating extensive knowledge resources requires
long-term means. Making use of extensive knowledge re-
sources, especially over long periods of time requires the
development of information and knowledge itself and an
integration of media and features for transporting and working
with information. Content has to be developed for long peri-
ods of time. This includes new research, including historical
information, and extending multi-disciplinary references. The
focus question for documentation, operating on information
and computing is: How can complex systems be built, devel-
oped, and extended over the necessarily long periods of time?
With the application components, e.g., information system
components like databases, mostly form monolithic and even
proprietary blocks. Their life cycle is mostly much shorter
than long-term content development. On the side of computing
challenges it is possible to create solutions for very perishable
present resources. Any more complex problem cannot be
considered “solved” for future architectures and applications.
Many information and knowledge resources cannot be used
without the original context, e.g., computing resources any
more. Up to now context of information science cannot be
described by common means to a reasonable extend. This leads
to another essential question: What information and knowledge
on content and context can be preserved for medium- and long-
term usage when the complexity of an overall system will be
unpredictably high?
The long-term strategy created here is based on an imple-
mentation architecture, which includes long-term knowledge
resources with the resources and development. In this paper
we concentrate on the archaeological and geosciences topics
being part of the knowledge resources. The foundations should
enable the essential processing of archaeological, geoscientiﬁc,
geophysical, geological, spatial and other data as well as a
thorough documentation of all aspects of content and context
and the exploitation of advanced scientiﬁc computing methods
and resources for maximum ﬂexibility.
Regarding the status of long-term knowledge we have to
distinct between two important main parts, which this paper
presents: The knowledge resources and the Integrated Infor-
mation and Computing Systems (IICS), both already used in
practice. The presentation of the long-term issues and the new
features and results presented in this paper shows the potential
of IICS being based on multi-disciplinary documentation for
this purpose. Anyhow, it can only describe a tiny fraction of
the multitude of possible features.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II describes
the motivation and Section III summarises related work. Sec-
tion IV introduces architecture and implementation for the
IICS. Sections V and VI describe the long-term strategy and
discuss the advanced knowledge object creation. Sections VII,
VIII, IX, and X show high-end implementation case studies
of advanced objects in context of a geoscience-archaeology
IICS: A digital archaeology library, the computing features and
components, the integration of external information, and basic
mechanisms and workﬂows. Section XI presents an evaluation
including processing, computing, and classiﬁcation aspects.
Section XII summarises the conclusions and future work.

MOTIVATION
For small volumes of data, small numbers of objects or
primitive workﬂows most computing and storage requirements
are neglectable. Using available data with complex processing
workﬂows soon shows up with requirements increasing more
than exponential. With a large amount of data and large
numbers of objects this will become a huge challenge. The
more, as commonly there are many different object types
and even inside a type any of these objects will differ. One
group of objects may consist of some thousand digital samples
from a media database, another group may be physical objects
carrying speciﬁc descriptions, and a third may be data sets and
workﬂows for seismic processing and simulation. Besides that
the workﬂows can be arbitrary complex, the requirements on
the groups can widely differ. With one group the permanent
storage may involve Terabytes of data and less computation.
With another group the input data and parametrisation may be
much smaller in size but the computational requirements can
take up to several days per workﬂow step.
Currently, other approaches fail on integrative multi-
disciplinary concepts as well as on the integration of structure,
long-term preservation, and computational and information
system facilities. An important reason is that those available
approaches start from an implementation of features and not
from the knowledge itself. There are no frameworks providing
the necessary concepts and features for integration of data,
workﬂows, knowledge and computing resources, and opera-
tion. For example, a lot of advanced geoscientiﬁc processing
cannot be reproduced after a few years, even if the data
and results are still existing. Means for extended long-term
interpretation and analysis are missing.
It is a huge challenge that, besides data creation not being
able to support sufﬁciently comprehensive documentation, the
widely used technology, e.g., document formats, Uniform
Resource Locators (URL), and Web Services are not persistent
over longer periods of time, e.g., for static objects ﬁle formats
do change, for applications and services the implementations
and features will change. Therefore, information structures
built from such technologies will become inaccessible. Long-
term knowledge creation cannot rely on this. From the complex
systems’ point of view any of those building elements are not
suitable for describing objects and creating long-term knowl-
edge resources. Anyhow the original sources and building
elements are needed for documentation of the original content
and context. Therefore, knowledge creation has to separate
the essentials of knowledge from technology, resources, and
other tools while at the same time respecting their importance.
Even worse, that workﬂows, algorithms, resources and their
management cannot be guaranteed for long-term availability.
The topic is very complex and experiences with long-term
knowledge creation are out of scale of the time interval of most
researchers. Especially, it has been found to be less difﬁcult
for groups with a strong background of classical academic
education to understand the problem itself, than it is for groups
with a “technical-only” background to realise the multiple
beneﬁts of classiﬁcation.
Examples of long-term creation of knowledge and the
implementation of applications building on these resources are
presented in the following sections, showing that such scenario
can hardly be managed in a comparable way with other
available methods and concepts. The case studies from archae-
ology and geosciences disciplines are using the architecture,
knowledge resources, computing interfaces, and features. The
resources and interfaces have been continuously developed and
improved for more than twenty years already. The following
passages describe the requirements in the context of this new
study and implementation. Further details on requirements
have been described in several case studies cited.
A. Value of data
The value of data is a central driving force for creating
sustainable knowledge resources, the more as data is increas-
ingly important for long period of times. Long-term in cases of
sustainable high-value data means many decades of availability
and usability. Therefore, usability, security, and archiving are
most important aspects of the value of data sets. Value is not
the price a data set can be sold as there are many individual
factors. The long-term studies, as the “Cost of Data Breach”
study initiated by Symantec at the Ponemon Institute [2]
summarise that the costs related to data loss are high and do
increase every year [3]. Straight approaches for calculating
individual risks and data loss, as with the Symantec Data
Breach Calculator [4] illustrate the effects.
B. Sustainability and long-term issues
1) Recommendations of the German science council:
With information systems containing content that has to be
created and cared for a sustainable long-term operation and
provisioning, the main aspect is not the technology for a
limited implementation. The focus is the speciﬁcation and
structure of the knowledge, which must be deﬁned with the
owner of the data. In many cases an exploitation for scientiﬁc
discovery is imperative. The German science council (Wis-
senschaftsrat) recommends the exploitation of content and its
public provision for content of special signiﬁcance [5].
The science council provides recommendations for infor-
mation infrastructures, which should be considered for wider
implementation. The central aspects are exploitation, standard-
isation, and long-term archiving and archival storage. This
is of prescind importance as far as the content and services
are of public interest and can be deﬁned core business of an
institutional body. As from the recommendations, the planning
phase for infrastructures should at least consider medium
duration. Project funding of existing structures is not adequate.
Regarding the context of the information, the operation must be
considered a permanent task. Nevertheless, the German science
council recommends an accompanying, infrastructure related
research, which may be considered on a project base. This can
be especially suitable for the component development, whereas
data, content, and structures are non project matter. Aspects of
funding, proﬁles, and digitising are of special concern within
federal structures [6].
2) Experiences from national an international studies: Up
to now, knowledge integration and its discovery aspects are
widely discussed within national and international context. The
existing concepts the data on knowledge and accompanying
recommendations are too specialised and too strict [7], [8],
[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], especially for the required long-
term and multi-disciplinary use. As the concepts are artiﬁcial,

the integration with natural structures is most difﬁcult. Even
if developed over years, the basic concepts and structures
rarely ﬁt for many disciplines, services, and resources. Neither
creation nor operation can proﬁt from the existing practice
and frameworks. Knowledge resources have to be considered
universal, for any data as well as any workﬂow. Practically,
there is no difference between explicit and tacit knowledge
as promoted with various previous approaches. Auditing is
not depending on a special kind of knowledge resources
and from knowledge resources point of view it cannot be
practically separated into asset structures, data auditing for
projects, organisations or maintenance.
Knowledge resources should be deﬁned for sustainability
and long-term aspects. The most important aspect for decision
making is experience. This has to be considered for creat-
ing all aspects of knowledge resources. Universal knowledge
resources require a high level of multi-disciplinary compre-
hension. The workﬂows may not inﬂuence the structures of
the knowledge resources. They should be created for selecting
a focus. They should be able to incorporate and handle data
of disciplines, content, algorithms, and documentation. They
should allow integration with implementation and operation.
They should allow for different required views.

RELATED WORK
There is no wider concept and implementation known com-
parable to the solution presented, described and implemented
here. Nevertheless, there are concepts for components, imple-
mentations, and terminology. Previous work [14], [15], [16],
[17], [18] has delivered important basic concepts and com-
ponents, e.g., Integrated Information and Computing Systems,
dynamical components, and taxonomy. Efﬁciently structuring,
classifying, e.g., with UDC, and storing data are key issues
with ﬂexible and sustainable long-term knowledge resources.
Taxonomy is the science and practice of classiﬁcation. An
important facetted classiﬁcation is the Universal Decimal Clas-
siﬁcation (UDC) [19]. According to Wikipedia currently about
150000 institutions, mostly libraries, are using basic UDC
classiﬁcation worldwide [20], e.g., with documentation of their
resources, library content, bibliographic purposes, for digital
and realia objects. This is mostly restricted to publications
and references but not of general knowledge and applications.
Some aspects can be studied from the goals of knowledge
discovery [21], which is becoming increasingly important.
Other aspects are handled with search algorithms, which
currently are still very primitive regarding knowledge creation
and usage. Developing general categories and classiﬁcations
is a long-term process [22]. Many generations of researchers
and institutions have contributed to its development [23], [19].
A general usage for any kind of objects as it had been
originally intended with the “universal” classiﬁcation is still
not practiced. A signiﬁcant part of the long-term problem for
putting a general application into practice is the complexity of
multi-disciplinary knowledge and workﬂows.
IV.
ARCHITECTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION
As far, it is not commonly possible to treasure content
currently used for being preserved in order to create really
long-term usable content. Even much more difﬁcult that an
implementable solution for any form of long-term context is
even in wide distance. In general, only a very small percentage
of disciplines and researchers are familiar with knowledge
classiﬁcation and applications. The more, multi-disciplinary
classiﬁcation is currently only in the focus of third parties.
Operational resources and features are considered to be short-
term issues whereas information, knowledge, and respective
resources and features must be considered of long-term sig-
niﬁcance. Case studies showed that long-term development
requires a strong sustainability of content, context, and com-
putation. This means, the most important part of these systems
is the knowledge resources containing the content and context
documentation to any extent necessary for describing the
activities and isolating the perishable components for context
documentation.
A solid classiﬁcation cannot be done automatically. The
more, it cannot be done automatically for use with IICS.
This does not interfere with or limit in any way the amount
of data handled by a workﬂow making use of classiﬁed
knowledge resources. Anyhow, in fact that different views are
possible, it is reasonable to have classiﬁcation views from
the origin, from main disciplines or from the developers in
order to increase the quality of references. The architecture
respects these conditions. The architecture integrates several
components especially developed for long-term integration:
•
Universal classiﬁcation,
•
Structure,
•
Multi-disciplinary knowledge documentation,
•
Resources support, e.g., computation and storage,
•
Creating, describing, executing workﬂows, . . .
All the implemented components have proved to fulﬁll the
requirements for long-term vitality and extendability.
The following sections explain in detail how a successful
implementation of an integrated system has been created and
operated using knowledge resources and classiﬁcation for
information system usage.
A. Architecture for documentation and development
The architecture implemented for an economical long-term
strategy is based on different development blocks. Figure 1
shows the three main columns: Applications resources, knowl-
edge resources, and originary resources. The central block in
the “Collaboration house” framework architecture [18], are the
knowledge resources, scientiﬁc resources, databases, contain-
ers, and documentation (e.g., LX [14], databases, containers,
list resources). These can be based on and refer to the origi-
nary resources and sources (photos, scientiﬁc data, literature).
Application resources and components (Active Source, Active
Map, local applications) are implementations for analysing,
utilising, and processing data and making the information and
knowledge accessible. These three blocks are supported by
services interfaces. The interfaces interact with the physical
resources, in the local workspace, in the compute and storage
resources the knowledge resources are situated, and in the
storage resources for the originary resources. All of these do
allow for advanced scientiﬁc computing and data processing
as well as the access of compute and storage resources
via services interfaces. The resources’ needs depend on the
application scenarios to be implemented for user groups.

by application resources and originary resources. The knowledge resources are used as a universal component for compute and storage workﬂows.
B. Components: Applications, knowledge, and sources
The main information, data, geo-referencing, and algo-
rithms for all presented components and examples are provided
by the LX Foundation Scientiﬁc Resources [14]. This deploys
the structure and classiﬁcation of objects necessary for a rea-
sonable implementation. Besides the LX structure the already
established Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation (UDC) [19] has
been integrated for objects [15] as it provides a hierarchical and
multi-lingual, faceted classiﬁcation for any topic and allows
implementing a faceted analysis with enumerative scheme
features, as well as to create new classes by using relations and
grouping. In multi-disciplinary object context, this empowers
to use workﬂows combining keywords, enumerative concepts
and full-text analysis with a faceted analysis.
Besides the academic, industrial, and business application
scenarios in focus of the GEXI collaborations’ case studies
[16] it is an important factor to integrate the necessary docu-
mentation and computing facilities with systems like an Uni-
versal IICS (UIICS). An implementation of interfaces for using
structure and classiﬁcation with appropriate Archaeological
IICS system components has been created for several simple
(SAMPLE, COLLECTION, CONTEXT, DISCIPLINE) and
slightly more complex workﬂows (CONNECT, REFERTO-
TOPIC, REFERTO-SPATIAL, VIEW-TO, VIEW-FROM) [18].
For the topics and content discussed here, geoscientiﬁc
and archaeological information and processing are the core
content. Data in this context necessarily includes applications
and algorithms. Besides the above implemented features, it
is optional to support any visualisation tool, processing al-
gorithms, cartographic and mapping features and many more
tools from secondary sciences, e.g., spatial algorithms and
components, UDC (1-0/-9). These features can be used with
the objects in any way that will be necessary to describe data
and automate workﬂows.
C. Classiﬁcation, keywords, and interfaces
The interfaces allow to use the various resources. A central
element is the classiﬁcation and structure of the knowledge
resources as it increases the ﬂexibility of the long-term devel-
opment. Table I compares some features of classiﬁcation and
keywords used for object description.

Interfaces can be used in order to access and use objects.
This includes ﬁltering, combination, workﬂow and data pro-
cessing and so on. In summation, this allows the integration
of all data, objects, and resources available: scientiﬁc and
discipline data, lexicographical and bibliographical data GPS
data, geospatial information, processing algorithms, executable
software, and many more, including realia objects.
The result means, we need to integrate multi-disciplinary
information, allowing different views on the same context and
allow even different paths for exploring knowledge.
V.
LONG-TERM STRATEGY
The immanent attribute of preservation is time. Time is one
of the factors limiting life and existence, e.g., of realia objects
in archives, museums, and libraries as well as with imple-
mentations of mathematically based electronical machines and
components.
Whereas looking from inside a traditional discipline, infor-
mation seems to be complete and appears to increase slowly.
On the other hand there is huge complementary information
that cannot be described isolated by one discipline and ten-
dency is increasing over the time and complexity.
Table II presents the result of a reasonable categorisation
that has been found from practicing the knowledge resources
creation and use for several decades. It shows a more detailed
compilation of categorised features and components for an
expected actuality time range. In this context, the goal for
long-term means > 50 years, medium-term > 15 years, and
short-term < 15 years.

These components, described by a representative selection
in Table II, can cover all aspects of knowledge creation,
application, and system implementation. For example, with the
implementation, the resources and containers are consisting of
thousands of pages. For the presentation within the following
sections a small excerpt of the objects and classiﬁcation can
be shown.
The long-term objects must be able to contain the essential
knowledge, even as medium- and short-term objects cannot
be preserved or made persistent as, e.g., DOI (Digital Object
Identiﬁer), URN (Uniform Resource Name), URL (Uniform
Resource Locator), and PURL (Persistent Uniform Resource
Locator) will vanish and context and sources may fade away
as well as OS (Operating System) features used. Therefore, we
have to distinct between the real instance of a DOI and URL or
a context situation and a descriptive reference of these objects.
These descriptive references can contain as much information
and knowledge as possible (for example DOI, URL, context
description, sources).
VI.
ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE OBJECT CREATION
A. Knowledge objects
The LX Scientiﬁc Resources [14], [18] are used as base
knowledge resources for the following case studies, delivering
structure, content, classiﬁcation, and providing methodologi-
cally exploitable information. The elementary knowledge ob-
jects can have any required extent. Some objects are naturally
small, e.g., translations or acronym expansions, others can have
hundreds of pages with references and an arbitrary number of
subobjects.
An object may contain any number of subobjects. As soon
as it seems reasonable from the content and context a subobject
can become an object or a number of subobjects can be
grouped into a container. The object data excerpts show source,
structure, references, and other features used. Media samples
are referenced, but the extensive data is not explicitely given
here.
Objects and information are naturally distributed, for exam-
ple, spatially and logically. Ranking within any object matrix
is subjective, especially when only the information from a
few isolated and not comprehensive sources is considered.
This holds true for any object referred to, for example, media
objects, sources and publication. In the end, the isolated subset
leads to a reduced quality within the selection. Therefore, some
external resources have been included as examples.
B. Classiﬁcation
The operated knowledge resources, based on the LX Foun-
dation Scientiﬁc Resources [18], incorporate UDC classiﬁ-
cation for any discipline and purpose, e.g., for knowledge
discovery and workﬂows.
A practical summarising excerpt subset of UDC codes used
for computation with the available knowledge resources is
given in Table III. In this context, the following examples
explain multi-disciplinary documentation, views, and compu-
tational issues from several disciplines and topics, grouped by
application:
•
Digital archaeological library examples,
•
Computing aspects,
•
Knowledge resources and external information,
•
Mechanisms and workﬂow case study on geo-objects.

The ﬁgures shown in the case study examples are computed
from the content of knowledge resources and ﬁltered with the
Integrated Information and Computing Systems (IICS), using
photo media samples (media samples and object entries c⃝
C.-P. Rückemann, 2011, 2012, 2013). It must be emphasised
that the applications can provide any type of objects, high
resolution media, and detailed information. An example how
an environment and context can look like has been shown and
discussed with special features of the knowledge resources and
IICS (Figure 1 in [24]).
On the one hand, the object entries demonstrate the struc-
ture and references, e.g., to the attributes of the objects as
classiﬁcation, form, material, and location. On the other hand,
the ﬁgures illustrate the result matrices for collections, context,
and integration of multi-disciplinary information.
VII.
DIGITAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL LIBRARY EXAMPLES
In combination with the above shown features, objects in
digital archaeological libraries have been enriched with various
information, e.g., on museum, library information, archives,
network information, mapping services, locations and Points
Of Interest (POI).
Due to the knowledge resources organisation, the objects
can be used in references as well as in the cache for interactive
components at any stage within the workﬂow process. Com-
bining the structure and classiﬁcation with the silken selection
algorithms leads to very ﬂexible, multi-disciplinary interfaces.
Each group of digital images shows a result matrix from
a selection process. The following ﬁgures illustrate resulting
objects from the digital library of the LX Scientiﬁc Resources
with multi-disciplinary background, in these examples regard-
ing material, function, and model or reconstruction purposes.
A. Knowledge objects, classiﬁcation, and computation
The following example (Figure 2) shows two result matri-
ces from the pottery and amphores context for the presentation
of realia objects (row 1) and available documentation and
reconstruction presentation of realia objects (row 2). Both rows
of media samples in the computed result matrices are by option
aligned left to right from West to East:

The reference computed from the resources contains context
associated with the criteria and association.
2) UDC based completion: The potential to dynamically
create combined classiﬁcation and context information does
provide huge beneﬁts. The example ‘amphores in the net’ will
show how to ﬁnd classiﬁed information. There is no general
method nor a tool for systematically discovering classiﬁed
material in the Internet. Even the amount of material available
is not known as the awareness about classiﬁcation and as an
result the demand is not very developed. When looking for
information a search even not supporting classiﬁcation can
give some hints. Looking for examples of UDC amphores
classiﬁcation we have currently (2013-08-11) retrieved a few
slightly complex classiﬁcations via Google (Listing 6).

904:738(497.5-37 Rovinj)
2
904:738.8(497.5 Dalmacija)"-04/-01"

Listing 6. Amphores UDC classiﬁcation (retrieved via Google).
All three showing UDC classiﬁcations regarding amphores
context in Croatia, mediterranean area, using an explicit spec-
iﬁcation of the respective location. The classiﬁcation usage is
very well comparable with those commonly used for amphores
objects within the objects of the knowledge resources. This
increases the numbers of suitable positive results within the
results matrices, especially for the documentation information
on references and sources.
3) Knowledge based exploration: Listing 7 shows an ex-
cerpt of several amphores object entries. These object entries
do contain various information. In context with the request
on a certain region, these objects build a group by their
classiﬁcation and context and the information that additional
media data for these objects is not available and target of
further investigation.

Listing 7. Knowledge resources – Amphores exploration context.
E. On-water transport and utilisation
The knowledge resources provide information that am-
phores are tightly associated with on-water transport. Espe-
cially, the associations are:
•
Amphora sites :: ﬁnding historical transport routes.
•
Amphores :: geographic origin of the cargo.
•
Amphores :: valuable means for dating ship wrecks.
Selecting archaeological objects, watercraft engineering, ma-
rine engineering, boats, ships, boat building, ship building,
and being models having origin from ancient Egypt and the
Mediterranean (UDC:902+629.5+(32),(37),(38)) re-
sults in a subset from the ship model collection. The following
examples (Figures 5 and 6) show two subsets.
Figure 5. Result matrix – Ship + war.
Figure 5 presents a result matrix of media samples for
ancient war ships whereas Figure 6 presents a result matrix
for ancient civil transport ships.
Figure 6. Result matrix – Ship + civil transport.
Going into this result matrix, the ﬁrst sample shows a
Greek ship used for commercial trading, including amphores.
The classiﬁcation refers to this ship model into the amphores
context as it also carries amphores in this model. The second
sample shows a Roman commercial transport ship, also asso-
ciated with amphores transport. The third and fourth sample
are a Llagut type and an Egyptian ship.
F. Objects and geological information
Figure 7 excerpts a result on mills, stone, and crop. Adding
volcanic to the target matrix delivers a more speciﬁc object
(Figure 8), a rotary mill made from volcanic stone, found at
an excavation at Badalona, the historical Baetulo.
Figure 7. Result matrix – Mills + stone + crop.
Figure 8. Result matrix – Mills + stone + crop + volcanic (one object).
The object entry contains a reference to appropriate media
objects showing the realia object. The original label does not
contain the information on the speciﬁc material. The computed
object entry also holds the reference to an appropriate material
sample of the volcanic stone. It identiﬁes the stone as Basalt
and refers to further relevant geological objects. The computed
object also links to comparable material and sources where
those materials can be found and in this case it delivers reasons
why this material might have been used for this product.
Listing 8 shows an excerpt of the ﬁrst media object being a
subobject entry of the more comprehensive Baetulo object.

VIII.
COMPUTING: FEATURES AND COMPONENTS
The knowledge resources can be ﬂexibly accessed and
used for computational purposes. They have been used with
processing components on High End Computing resources,
e.g., dynamical and interactive support on the one hand and
diffraction support and seismic stacking on the other hand [26],
[18] and may be used for comparable concepts, e.g., the Smart
Stacking [27].
A. Selected features
The following passages present some features implemented
for processing of objects, e.g., translations and transcription
support, support of exceptions or correction, historical writing
support, and ranking. Many compute intensive methods of
extending the object pool for speciﬁc discovery workﬂows use
the modiﬁcation within the available resources. These can in-
clude correction or modiﬁcation of typographical appearances.
These methods can be used for content as well as for keywords
or classiﬁcation, in centralised or distributed resources. For
computational issues with data and computing centred work-
ﬂows dynamical process communication as well as batch and
envelope support is shown with the later examples.
1) Computing translations and transcriptions: The transla-
tion resources are one option to use translation and associated
transcription data (Listing 9, excerpt). The workﬂow compo-
nents can support computing references and links into multi-
lingual context by exploiting these resources.

Listing 9. Object translation and transcription data (LX Resources).
The entries amphores and basalt are examples from
knowledge resources objects. They show a subset of languages
and translation and transcription data. The data sets are inte-
grated within the appropriate knowledge objects and referenced
from an arbitrary number of associated objects. As shown in
the example, the transcriptions can be deﬁned generic and
portable. The data itself can be handled by various algorithms.
For example, the transcription data can be iterated automati-
cally with special algorithms in order to generate alternatives
for adding references as well as using the information for
typesetting or character replacements. Listing 10 shows an
excerpt of retrieved examples (lxaztrdb) from the general
purpose translation and transcription database.

Listing 10. Translation and transcription database (LX Resources).
The translation and transcription database allows to have an
arbitrary algorithm and structure for an implementation within
a workﬂow. It can also associate terms with the translations,
like associating “Garum” with “ancient Roman sauce” or
creating black lists for translations.
2) Computing keyword translation terms: Listing 11 shows
generated (lxazkw_de2en.sh) keyword translations.

translation and deﬁnition can therefore be separated from other
translations.
3) Computing translation groups: Comparable to the key-
word handling the resources allow for deﬁnition of translation
groups for strings, which might even not be translations.
Listing 12 shows an excerpt of translation groups.

used in both directions, separating and ligating. For example,
the ligating direction can be helpful for even ﬁnding links that
would not be recognised with a regular expression search on
documents coded with different ligations.

Listing 15. Typographical correction algorithms (LX Resources, excerpt).
The tycorr routines based on this database can be used
for extending workﬂows at any step, from input, content,
context, intermediate data up to ﬁnals results. With non-batch
workﬂows the same database is used for editing corrections
and publishing support. Any object, attribute or component
can be handled that way. On the one hand, even objects or
keyword labels as generated for special languages only can be
integrated into a regular discovery. On the other hand, original
and historical writing, different transcriptions or “authentic”
errors can be included in the discovery process and used
within workﬂows. With the existing components many thou-
sands of variants, transcription sets, and automatic corrections
have been created and build an extended representation of
the knowledge resources content. Applying these within the
workﬂows can improve the quality of the discovery, exactly
for the purpose of the application scenario.
7) Ranking:
Algorithms applied to isolated input data
stored in proprietary database cannot result in a generally valid
data ranking. This ranking is only appropriate for the speciﬁc
limited context of the collected data. Any comparisons of the
ranking between separate groups of data is not reasonable.
The basic environment is made up by the algorithm and the
input data. Input data consists of the knowledge resources and
external data. Everything that may be used for discovery can
be integrated with the knowledge resources. Besides data sets
from natural sciences modelling or simulation, and documen-
tation also references, descriptive data, citations, publications
with content and bibliographic information can be exploited.
•
Alphanumeric ranking,
•
Ranking based on context,
•
Ranking based on classiﬁcation,
•
Ranking based on number of items, like regular ex-
pressions or references,
•
Silken selection, like phonetic algorithms support.
B. Components
Using the following concepts, we can implement for mostly
any system:
•
Application communication via IPC.
•
Application triggering on events.
•
Storage object requests based on envelopes.
•
Compute requests based on envelopes.
For demonstration and studies ﬂexible and open Active Source
Information System components have been used for maximum
transparency. This allows OO-support (object, element) on
application level as well as multi-system support. Listing 16
shows a simple example for application communication with
framework-internal and external applications (Inter-Process
Communication, IPC).

Listing 18. Storage object request (OEN).
OEN are containing element structures for handling
and embedding data and information, like Filename and
Content. An end-user public client application may be im-
plemented via a browser plugin, based on appropriate services.
With OEN instructions embedded in envelopes, for example as
XML-based element structure representation, content can be
handled as content-stream or as content-reference. Algorithms
can respect any meta-data for objects and handle different
object and ﬁle formats while staying transparent and portable.
Using the content features the original documents can stay
unmodiﬁed. The way this will have to be implemented for
different use cases depends on the situation, and in many cases
on the size and number of data objects. However, the hier-
archical structured meta data is uniform and easily parsable.
Further, it supports signed object elements (Signature),
validation and veriﬁcation via Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
and is usable with sources and binaries like Active Source.
Compute requests for distributed resources are handled via
CEN interfaces [28]. Listing 19 shows a generic CEN ﬁle with
embedded compute instructions.

Content can be handled as content-stream or as content-
reference (Content, ContentReference). Compute in-
struction sets are self-descriptive and can be pre-conﬁgured
to the local compute environment. In this case, standard
PBS batch instructions like walltime and nodes are used.
The way this will have to be implemented for different use
cases depends on the situation, and in many cases on the
size and number of data objects. An important beneﬁt of
content-reference with high performant distributed or multicore
resources is that references can be processed in parallel on
these architectures. The number of physical resources and the
transfer capacities inside the network are limiting factors.
IX.
INTEGRATION OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION
Besides the computational aspects, it had to be analysed if
and how external structures of traditional information sources
can contribute to the knowledge resources. The following ex-
ample describes how an intelligent use of Integrated Informa-
tion and Computing Systems knowledge resources can support
on-site knowledge discovery as well as external distributed dis-
covery. Regarding the examples in the last section, information
from an external resource has been analysed and compared
for ﬁnding complementary references for objects and result
matrices of the knowledge database and for detecting targets
for future enhancements of the object and media database.
Using the LX Scientiﬁc Resources and data from external
sources, in this case the publicly available Leibniz information
(concept glossaries [29], manuscript collections and catalogues
[30], [31], and critical editions [32], emended and commented),
several new references can be created for the resources. The
critical editions contains the texts on base of the original
drafts. As there is no ﬂexible interface or standard format
available, the referenced ﬁles have to be fetched, processed,
and evaluated in order to retrieve the required information.
A. Leibniz and archaeology case
The knowledge resources have been used for discovering
paths into external resources. Listing 20 shows an excerpt
of the object paths used in context with Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz (1646–1716).

These refer to the appropriate descriptions and sources, e.g.,
[34], [35], [36], [37] and [38], [39], [40], [41] as well as [42]. It
is signiﬁcant that some important passages are not containing
the terms in either language or transcription but some context
of these. In the case of [36] neither “Venedig”, “Venice” or
another term is mentioned in the texts but the term “Golphe”,
which in this case refers to the “Gulf of Venice”. Therefore, it
is most important to have a context description and to process
this description for a successful discovery.
B. Leibniz and geo resources case
The knowledge resources not only enclose textual refer-
ences. They can also deliver references and context for non-
textual material, different terminology, and sources:
Within the knowledge resources, the context of the “Leib-
niz” object also delivers references to non-textual material
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz had access to, e.g., the Witsen
Map [43]. The knowledge resources can provide transfer of
context and terminology, e.g., for different disciplines, epochs,
languages, and cultures. For example, it refers the term “seis-
mology” to the term “terrae motus” used in that time [44],
[45], as has been shown in [24]. It further links the term
to the “Vesuvius” and earthquake related context and from
this delivers source, e.g., for the correspondency Leibniz had
regarding geoscientiﬁc phenomena [46], [47].
C. Integration of the Leibniz resources
The external resources themselves have revealed some
deﬁcits, especially the do not use a unique terminology. In
addition, the structure of these resources is not unique. There
is no general harmonisation of the implementations. The
implementations show that different institutions and projects
with different intentions have been working on the topic. Only
a low level of interoperability is available. The preparation of
the data in its current organisation and formatting is not well
suited for further electronical use in information systems. The
numbering of sources and references is not intended to be used
automatically. The provided implementation of transcriptions,
translations, and references to original sources, scans, and
bibliographic data is not consistent. In addition, it cannot be
interfaced in order to enable a full discovery of the content.
X.
MECHANISMS AND WORKFLOWS CASE STUDY
A ﬁlter chain can be used to compute resulting object
sets. Based on the available system the following steps can be
separated, in an example from geosciences and archaeology:
•
Select topic from knowledge base (volcanology).
•
Select region from results (Europe, Caribbean).
•
Select volcano from results (Vesuvius, La Soufrière).
•
Select object entries (geosciences and archaeology).
•
Select media objects and references.
•
Select application resources and interfaces.
A. Workﬂows and algorithms
The knowledge resources block is the central resource in
the long-term strategy. The knowledge resources can contain
any kind of content. Application components can be migrated
into the knowledge resources for documentation purposes
and re-use. The services can access archived and historical
data as well as live data and feed it into the workﬂows.
Services interfaces allow to build complex workﬂows using
arbitrary algorithms. The knowledge resources can be accessed
from applications to extract suitable information and trigger
the use of compute and storage resources. Objects can be
selected by any algorithm, e.g., combinatory, search, and ﬁlter
algorithms. Examples for the universal use of documentation
and algorithms as used with the disciplines presented here
are media data like digital images, video, hypertexts, Portable

Document Format (PDF) documents, LATEX documentation and
sources, implementations of algorithms in Perl, Tcl, Fortran,
and C programming languages as well as references to digital
object and realia objects. The results can be delivered to a
deﬁned location or service.
B. Resulting cross-links calculated
The knowledge resources organisation allows to create
all structures and references possible for information science
purposes, besides content and taxonomy. Table IV shows
an excerpt of the references and cross-links calculated from
the knowledge resources for a “Vesuvius” object with some
applications and originary resources, media information and
illustrative examples.

[compute and storage resources]
[workstation]
A small subset of knowledge space objects is less suitable for
providing the necessary depth for building facets and referring
to appropriate multi-disciplinary objects. Therefore, even a
basic example needs an extended knowledge environment.
The secondary references (symbol:
) for an object are
calculated from the respective reference matrix in the knowl-
edge resources. The cross-links are extracted from the long-
term knowledge resources and are usable with available data
by any application components. Available example instances
from the application components set, media resources, and
originary sources (realia) are listed. In this context cross-
linked subentries, keys and, for example, in case of volcanic
features the classiﬁcation (UDC) and the Volcano Number
(VNUM) can be integrated in the analysis for computation
and processing via the reference to the appropriate container,
the volcano compendium. Applications and interfaces (e.g.,
Active Source, actmap [17]) can access any available data,
as creating index compilations, retrieving online maps and
satellite imagery. Media are, e.g., video data and photo images.
Originary sources of objects are, e.g., realia, in the case with
the volcanic material here, the objects are volcanic samples,
respective stones. These objects are referred to in an appropri-
ate archive, e.g., a collection, library or museum. The bottom
row shows how the services and resources are used (e.g., local
workstation access, special compute and storage resources).
C. Resulting object classiﬁcations and processing
Listing 27 shows a simple UDC-Context sample subentry
from the LX Resources. This example expresses a basic
“Europe : America” relation.

UDC-Context:(4):(7)
Listing 27. UDC-Context sample (LX Resources).
Classiﬁcation patterns are suitable to select objects with any
algorithm and pattern matching rules. Listing 28 shows a basic
grep-ﬁlter within a classiﬁcation set of UDC samples.

The following object entries are excerpts from the cal-

satellite image reference. The references for the geopositioning
are created via classiﬁcation and can be used for any purpose.

distribution maps for classiﬁed objects in the result matrix.
The classiﬁcation groups themselves show references to
associated objects. The data and media object in a processed
reference chain can be used for further analysis, creating
special features. That way, using UDC classiﬁcations, e.g.,
places from a region or context that can be associated with
volcanology and associated with archaeological sites can be
selected and media objects can be processed and realia re-
ferred.

Dynamical components can even beneﬁt from precalculation
and precomputation of objects. This includes precalculated
classiﬁcation and weights (“PreUDC”). The following section
presents examples calculated from the above classiﬁed objects
and the ﬁgures are showing the results of selected attributes,
including the classiﬁcation and geo-references used basic vi-
sualisation.
E. Resulting features selection for cross-links processing
The following (Figure 9) is an excerpt of the secondary
objects computed above for the Caribbean region volcanoes
and a selection with “UDC:(23),(24)”.
Figure 9. Topicview – volcanoes, La Soufrière (left), Mt. Scenery (right),
VIEW-TO (green), VIEW-FROM (blue).
Figure 10 illustrates the computed objects (Topicview),
e.g., here volcanic samples after processing, all showing the
variety of material from the top of the La Soufrière volcano.
Figure 10. Topicview – related volcanic samples (La Soufrière, 2011).
Any of these objects being part of the resulting matrix for a
request, e.g., photos for object entries as well as media data for
physically available samples, have been found via references
and UDC from the knowledge base. The realia references
for the objects refer to a collection where the samples are
stored. Further analysis for the samples is available via the
knowledge resources. Figure 11 shows the geo-locations [14]
for computed geoscientiﬁc and archaeological object samples
on a conﬁgurable object map.
Figure 11. Objectmap – computed map for related objects (red, excerpt).
A sample distribution of volcanic features is depicted
in Figure 12. It shows a comparison of volcanic data in a
projection identical to the computed Objectmap (Figure 11).
Although the knowledge matrix of this example is most
complex (Table IV), the workﬂow for producing a view can
be speciﬁed very easy like for spatial presentation. The map
generated with the workﬂow as described with the case study
presents the related objects from the context available in
the geophysical research database. It can visualise various
aspects of the classiﬁed objects. In this case of volcanoes and
geological samples a reasonable view is the spatial distribution
of the referenced selection.
Anyhow it must be emphasised that the number of possible
views is not limited, neither from the knowledge base nor from
the implementation. Spatial and cartographic methods provide
only a very restricted tool set for supporting sciences for their
complex tasks. For example, more complex examples from the
same context could use more advanced presentation methods
than available from spatial procedures. As it is obvious from
this, the implementation of the knowledge resources architec-
ture can be used for any purpose.
With the suggested workﬂow, the objects from the knowl-
edge resources can be processed by any means like phonetic
search, e.g., via classical or modiﬁed Soundex algorithms. This
includes the ﬂexible development of a non-limited number
of extensions for dynamical search and analysis. It, too,
provides a multiplicity of granularity regarding objects and
classiﬁcation.
Any features and data shown, based on the knowledge
resources [14] and further sources, even if much less struc-
tured like online encyclopedia material, are resulting from the
request and workﬂow, e.g., selection of classiﬁcation, topics,
object, secondary data, area, map projection, applications and
so on [48], [49], [50].
One possible example of an algorithm for the interface
workﬂow, with one request iteration is:
•
Knowledge base request,
•
Keyword ﬁltering,
•
Object processing,
•
UDC ﬁltering,
•
Object element processing,
•
Object container retrieval,
•
Media retrieval,
•
Media and
•
Container processing,
•
Building resulting media,
•
Visualisation,
•
Provisioning results.
This can be used to create multi-disciplinary text and media
results, e.g., dynamical distribution maps, from requests, using
calculation, processing, and computation of objects. A work-
ﬂow can enter the knowledge matrix from different directions,
e.g., from topic to related topic or from overview to detailed
view as well as vice versa.

XI.
EVALUATION
The architecture and resources have been able to support
any development required so far. Even as it is not possible
in any paper to describe all disciplines and features, the case
study shows the important features of the solution regarding
the involved disciplines! Especially, the solution including the
appropriate architecture and implementation does have all the
required features, presented and discussed in the case studies
allowing:
•
A universal classiﬁcation of all possible multi-
disciplinary objects and views,
•
To integrate and use any known type of document and
structure, e.g., media and realia,
•
Multi-disciplinary knowledge documentation, e.g.,
with archaeology and geosciences,
•
To address any type of resources, e.g., computation
and storage, including a feasible concept for collabo-
ration and operation,
•
To create, describe, and execute workﬂows, e.g., for
discovery and development.
The means are not limited in any way to the presented
examples. The facilities are only limited by the inventive spirit
of the implementing groups.
The integration of structure and classiﬁcation allows to use
the beneﬁts of algorithms like ﬁltering for any possible use of
processing and computing. Structuring the content and context
documentation allows a ﬂexible balance for redundancy of data
and compute requirements for various application scenarios,
even with identical data.
The facetted classiﬁcation and multi-disciplinary data have
proved to provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts for knowledge re-use and
discovery. This includes various ways of describing aspects
correctly. From one view a glass of water is half full. From
another view the same glass of water is half empty. The two
groups representing the classical views might argue that the
other view is unintelligible. Both are generally not good as they
only represent views. An alternative view will be describing
the status giving a ﬁlling percentage. In addition, this reduces
the limitation of unprecise references.
Most content, tasks, and developments handled with in-
formation and computing systems are not suitable for any
long-term use, the more there are requirements for functional
long-term documentation. The use of the universal knowledge
resources and collaboration framework has shown to be very
ﬂexible and extendable with implementations and technologies
over several decades.
It has been found that standard search and pattern recogni-
tion on information is by far not sufﬁcient to gain reasonable
results for long-term knowledge herding and evaluation pro-
cesses. In contrast, the implementation shows excellent results
with opening multi-discipline data for IICS, advanced comput-
ing, and processing. Statistically, ﬁltering 1 GB of unstructured
data delivers less quality than using 10 MB structured classiﬁed
knowledge base data. The Quality of Data (QoD) must be
drastically improved in order to get better results. This can
help to reduce compute times, storage volume, and besides
overall costs it can help to decrease energy consumption in the
end. Using UDC in this context, the availability of a full UDC
catalog, and an implementation allowing classiﬁcation views,

2013, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
combined classiﬁcation, and ranking priority has proven to
drastically increase the QoD. With multi-disciplinary networks,
there is even need for a tolerance of individual classiﬁcation.
In common environments it is only feasible to do one
implementation for a speciﬁc application, as has been done
with these components. Anyhow it has been possible to im-
plement the applications on various architectures providing
different resources. Workﬂows support the use of remote
resources (Table V). In case of a 1000 knowledge-objects
reference chain, with 1–10 elements per object, performance
will increase much with low latencies.

When using one of the described very basic application
scenarios on a certain resources architecture the efﬁciency
mostly depends on the decision for the depth of the cross-links
to be considered and on the processing requirements for the
media data for the originary resources. With current sizes for
digital photos and a low depth of ﬁve to ten for the cross-links
a medium sized application can easily use about one-hundred
parallel processes. On a common compute resource without a
queue conﬁgured for the jobs the response time will be less
than a minute.
That way, implementing components with IICS on many
compute nodes can proﬁt from using various technologies as
suited for different purposes, using task and thread parallelism
to the extend needed to handle a problem remotely:
•
High level: Integrated Systems, collaboration frame-
works, dynamical application components, Partitioned
Global Address Space (PGAS) models.
•
Virtualisation level: Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM).
•
Low level: Message Passing Interface (MPI), OpenMP,
and comparable.
Increasing requirements on resources are mostly focussed
on compute, communication, and storage. The requirements
can increase by various reasons, from classical High End
Computing, currently Peta-Scale or towards Exa-Scale, or
Advanced Scientiﬁc Computing components up to multi-user
performance within an application or resource. The concept
can handle
•
many computation tasks associated with a process,
•
many processes associated with a workﬂow,
•
many workﬂows associated with an application in-
stance,
•
many application instances associated with an appli-
cation scenario.
The integrated and dynamical concept allows a scalable use
of components, implementing components based on the ap-
propriate level. Besides this, the components, which require
an appropriate physical conﬁguration of the resources, for
example, in order to be usable with interactive dynamical
applications are considered are considered challenging at the
lower level.
XII.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
It has been demonstrated how complex systems for multi-
disciplinary documentation and computing can be built, devel-
oped, and extended based on creating long-term-knowledge
resources supported by a universal classiﬁcation and imple-
menting IICS systems. This paper presented the successful
implementation of a new universal framework for an integrated
system, integrating knowledge resources and implementation
components for long-term knowledge creation and use, in-
cluding the facilities for High End Computing and processing
resources.
The geoscientiﬁc and archaeological knowledge resources
have been, structured, extended, and developed for several
decades now, having been successfully used with various
technology over time. Huge beneﬁts creating new instances
of objects and components result from enabling a long-term
stepwise development for all parts of the knowledge and
application space and a free extendability of the knowledge
base. The previous work, which this implementation is built
on has been discussed.
The architecture allows any kind of documentation and al-
gorithm for content, context, information and resources usage.
The services and resources usage is very economic and only
limited by the limiting implementation factors, e.g., capacities
and policies. This solution goes far beyond data and text
mining or image analysis and pattern recognition. As shown,
classiﬁcation, as well as spatial data should be integrated with
the objects. In no case is it suitable regarding the long-term
goals of knowledge creation to “ﬁx” knowledge objects with
an application or implementation, neither simple or complex,
nor closed or open licensed.
The comparison showed that the possibility of combin-
ing methods (UDC, keyword, full-text analysis) does lead
to unique beneﬁts. Comparable precision, reliability, perfor-
mance, and scalability is not available from any isolated
method. For any advanced knowledge resources and improved
QoD, a ﬂexible classiﬁcation is undispensable. Bringing the
integration of universal classiﬁcation and IICS into wider
acceptance can provide a time-capsule against the transience
of knowledge and open new synergetic long-term possibilities.
Complex systems can be created and extended over the nec-
essarily long periods of time, using IICS and UDC. Advanced
scientiﬁc computing is supported by interfaces, accessing
compute and storage resources. With the available architecture
implementations of these compute and storage resources are
meant to be short- to medium-term tools for supporting the
long-term knowledge resources. Further it has been shown
what information and knowledge on content and context can
be preserved for medium- and long-term usage even for large
complexity of an overall system.
With collaborative implementations a catalog of universal
criteria is needed for feature development and exploitation
of knowledge resources. This catalog has to consider long-
term multi-disciplinary and international aspects. The overall

operative system components must be self-learning. Anyhow,
central components will always afford an editorially managed
operation.
The case study on knowledge resources and external infor-
mation showed a number beneﬁts. Especially the workﬂows
and results can very much proﬁt from an integration. Re-
garding the external Leibniz resources, an impressive amount
of valuable data has been collected by various institutions
within the last decades. Currently, only a small percentage is
being developed for exploitation and further integration. Based
on the vast experiences gathered within the last generations,
clearly structured resources, interfaces, and tools are required
for future knowledge discovery. For sustainability issues it will
be very desirable to see a suitable long-term data structure
being created in the future, using a unique terminology and
supporting an improved knowledge discovery and reuse.
Workﬂows utilising future storage and computational re-
sources can proﬁt from autonomous intelligent units, e.g.,
multi-agent system components [51].
The basic architecture has been presented using a long-
term knowledge base (LX), documentation, and classiﬁcation
of objects, the “Collaboration house” framework, ﬂexible al-
gorithms, workﬂows and dynamical and Active Source com-
ponents for creating future IICS. Besides that, there is a strong
demand for future education and teaching in all disciplines of
academia and research in order to mediate and disseminate the
basics of knowledge creation and classiﬁcation.
