Abstract—This paper describes the possible location methods 
available in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) 
when the Ultra Low Cost (ULC) mobile phone is not equipped 
with a Global Positioning System (GPS) system. The proposed 
simplified location procedure is to be used especially in the case of 
emergency calls, but also in the scope of other applications.

 INTRODUCTION  
In the last years, the wireless communication systems had a 
continuous evolution driven by the user increased requirements 
and expectations: more data throughput everywhere and 
anytime, mobility support at higher and higher speed, enhanced 
applications providing a huge amount of all types of 
information. And of course, the paid price was an increase 
complexity of the equipments, both on network and on user 
sides. So, it comes naturally to request many things from an 
expensive User Equipment (UE) belonging Universal Mobile 
Telecommunications System (UMTS) with High Speed Packet 
Access (HSPA+ ) or Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) 
communication systems. And one of most important aspect 
refers to positioning capability. Having a GPS system included 
in the UE allows fast positioning when the link is available and 
even in deep indoor situations, when the link is not available, 
the Assisted GPS (A-GPS) feature provides good results. So, all 
the commercial applications based on UE positioning work fine 
in almost all the cases. But one more important aspect is that 
the positioning may be obtained precisely and very fast during 
emergency calls (911 for US or 112 for Europe), and this can 
save human lives. 
If the above mentioned characteristics correspond to latest 
wireless communications systems, the main question is what is 
happening in the case of initial GSM system? Can a 2G only 
ULC mobile phone, without General Packet Radio Service 
(GPRS) or Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) 
capabilities and without a GPS system, benefit from the same 
positioning features as an expensive UE? To launch such a 
question today is not something out of interest. Although not 
too many 2G only mobile phones are designed anymore, there 
are still a lot of 2G chipsets used in Machine to Machine 
(M2M) applications (for example emergency systems installed 
on cars which activate in case of crush). Based on this remark, 
the goal of this paper is to list the potential positioning methods 
available in a 2G network and to select one of them and to 
present a simplified version and the obtained results when a 2G 
network topology is simulated. 
This paper is organized as following: Section II describes 
the most important positioning methods available for a GSM 
network, Section III presents the Enhanced Observed Time 
Difference (EOTD) method in details and the proposed update, 
Section IV provides the obtained results when two cases were 
simulated and Section V includes the conclusions of the study. 
II. 
POSSIBLE LOCATION METHODS USED IN GSM 
The most important and also the well known location 
methods in GSM can be organized in two categories, based on 
the principles they are applying [1][2][3] and based on the place 
inside the network architecture where they are being executed 
[4]. 
A. Possible location methods in GSM 
• 
Cell-ID and Timing Advance (TA) is the simplest, but 
also the less accurate positioning method. Cell-ID is a 
procedure based on knowing which cell sector the 
Mobile Subscriber (MS) belongs to. The sector is 
known only during connected state (voice or data call) 
and with this method no air interface resource is 
required to obtain cell sector information (if the user is 
active). Since the location is not accurate at all (a 
complete sector is the place where the MS may be), 
additional information can be added to increase the 
performances. Timing Advance represents the round 
trip delay between the MS and the serving GSM Base 
Transceiver Station (BTS) and it is the time MS 
advances its transmission with. Using Cell-ID and TA, 
the MS position is narrowed down to a band within a 
sector.  
Another approach to improve accuracy is based on an 
additional radio link quality indicator. The RxLEV is a 
GSM parameter used to describe the received signal 
strength. With suitable propagation models, the 
distance between MS and BTS can be estimated. Figure 
1 depicts the stages of this Cell-ID based method. 
• 
Time of Arrival (TOA) determines the mobile phone 
position based on the intersection of the distance 
circles. The distance is related to the propagation delay, 
so knowing the time on the radio link provides the 
distance between BTS and MS, i.e., there is a circle 
around BTS where the MS can be placed. 3 
measurements are required, so 3 circles to be 
intersected (same principle applies also in GPS, but in 
that case circle becomes sphere), as depicted in Figure 
2.

• 
A-GPS is a method that is used when the mobile phone 
is equipped with a GPS system. Usually the positioning 
is made in this case with the information obtained from 
the GPS satellites. But when the Line of Sight (LOS) to 
the satellites does not exist, like in deep indoor 
situations, or when the procedure to get a fix on mobile 
phone position is too long, the needed information may 
be received via the wireless communication system. 
This method is not of interest for this paper since a 2G 
ULC mobile phone is considered, without having a 
GPS system available. 
• 
EOTD is based on Time Difference of Arrival 
(TDOA), so a time difference measurement is required 
instead an absolute one. It is called the hyperbolic 
system because the time difference is converted to a 
constant distance difference to 2 BTSs to define a 
hyperbolic curve. The intersection of 2 such hyperbolas 
indicates the MS position, as described in Figure 3. The 
details of EOTD will be provided in Section III. 
B. Types of positioning methods 
• 
MS – based with/ without Network – assisted: for this 
type of methods the position is computed at MS end 
based on measurements performed on MS side and 
with/ without  inputs received from network side 
• 
Network – based with/ without MS – assisted: for this 
type of methods the position is computed at network 
end based on measurements performed on network side 
and with/ without  inputs received from MS side

ENHANCED OBSERVED TIME DIFFERENCE 
A. EOTD parameters 
There are 3 timing values required for this feature. The first 
one is the Observed Time Difference (OTD) and it represents 
the time interval observed by a MS between the bursts coming 
from 2 different BTSs. 
The second parameter is Real Time Difference (RTD) and it 
represents the relative synchronization interval in the network 
between 2 BTSs. This time interval has to be measured by a 
Location Measurement Unit (LMU) on network side as the time 
difference between the moment when BTS1 is sending a burst 
and the moment when BTS2 is sending a burst. 
The third parameter is the Geometric Time Difference 
(GTD) and it is the time interval measured at MS between 
bursts from 2 BTSs due to geometry. In other words:

where d1 and d2 are the distances between BTS1 and BTS2 and 
the MS and c represents the speed of light. In this context PD1 
and PD2 are the propagation delays between BTS1 and BTS2 and 
the MS. 
The following relation applies: 
 
GTD
OTD
RTD

(2) 
In order to better understand the above explanations and the 
meaning of each of the 3 timing parameters, the following 2 
examples are given in Figure 4. The first one considers the case 
when the timing relations between the 2 bursts from BTS1 and 
BTS2 is changed until MS reception due to propagation delays, 
while the second one keeps the same timing relation between 
the 2 bursts on MS reception as it was on BTSs transmission. 
In Figure 4, one can observe how the timing relation 
between the two considered bursts was measured on LMU side 
and how, after the propagation delay effect was introduced by 
the radio channel, the bursts timing difference was observed on 
MS side.

B. How EOTD works? 
In order to understand how EOTD really works, the 3GPP 
specifications [5] related to this feature will be also presented.  
The first step of the EOTD procedure is when MS receives 
from network the RTDs values between neighbour cells and 
serving cell. 3GPP TS 44035, Section 4.1.1 describes the 
Broadcast Assistance Data received by MS from network, as 
presented in Table 1, with details in Section 4.1.1.12 where the 
Channel RTD Value IE is presented, as in Table 2.

At the second step the MS measures the OTD between the 
same neighbour cells and the serving cell from which it already 
received RTDs. 
At the third step the MS computes for each neighbour cell a 
GTD related to the serving cell. 
At the last step, the intersection of the obtained hyperbolas 
will provide the MS position (see Figure 3). 
C. The math behind the TDOA principle 
This section will explain in detail what computation is 
needed to apply the above described principle if additional 
BTS-MS distance information is available (extracted from TA 
information). The complexity of computational effort in this 
case is lower than the classical way of solving the problem [6]. 
The scope of this section is just to give an example of how this 
positioning problem can be solved on MS side. 
Considering the notation from Figure 5, the distances 
between each BTS and the MS can be computed as

SIMULATION RESULTS 
For simulation purposes, a 2D space between –N:N units on 
x axis and –N:N units on y axis was considered. N parameter 
and the value of one unit depend on the cell radius. In the below 
simulations N was considered 10 for better results analysis. In 
real life, the value of N should be aligned with the resolution 
provided by the network parameters (RTDs) and with the one of 
the MS measured parameters (OTDs). In other words, if the 
resolution for algorithm inputs is for example 3 meters, N will 
be chosen in such a way so that, dividing the considered 
distance in N units to obtain squares of at least 3 meters. The 
simulations below will show that the correct square is found. 
This means that the MS will be placed correctly inside a square, 
but the exact position in that square will remain unknown, this 
being the localization resolution. 
In Figures 5 to 8, the BTSs are depicted with higher 
amplitude and with red color, while the MS is represented with 
lower amplitude and with green color. In both cases, Figure 5 
and 7 described the considered scenario and on Figures 6 and 8 
are the obtained results after applying the previously described 
procedure. 
The first scenario corresponding to Figure 5 considered 
BTS1(-1,-1), BTS2(2,2), BTS3(3,4) and placed the MS(7,8).  
The second scenario corresponding to Figure 7 considered 
BTS1(-6,8), BTS2(-4,-7), BTS3(8,8) and placed the MS(2,3).

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper summarized the main positioning methods used 
in a GSM wireless communication system when no GPS 
module is available on MS side. It described in details the 
EOTD method and it provided a very simple procedure of 
location with low computation effort based on TA usage over 
the classical EOTD. Two simulated cases were presented, 
showing the performances of the proposed procedure. The main 
goal of this paper was to provide a simple positioning method 
suitable for 2G ULC mobile phones to be used especially in 
case of emergency calls, so that a tragedy effect to be limited.
