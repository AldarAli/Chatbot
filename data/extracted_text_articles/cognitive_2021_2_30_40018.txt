Abstract—Radicalized communities are actively using the in-
ternet to preach their ideas within society. Hence, it is crucial
to research the content of such communities to understand their
agenda and potentially take actions. The discussion is spread
out in different forums on the Internet, but in this study, we
used natural language processing technologies for revealing topics
discussed in the oldest right-wing forum StormFront. As a result,
we found the co-occurrence of discussed topics and real-world
events, which means that the method can be used to track the
agenda and changes in the community.
Keywords-StormFront; topic model; information extraction;
NLP; LDA
I. INTRODUCTION
Although most of the population uses the internet in a
benign manner, there are groups, like political extremists of
any conviction, that (ab)use the internet in order to facilitate
the organization of violent events. In addition to simple
coordination, extremists have been found to use the internet
for all manner of beneﬁts to their group, such as information
provisioning, ﬁnancing, networking, recruitment and informa-
tion gathering [1]. Recently, there has also been evidence of
some violent political extremists and terrorists being online
immediately prior to their attacks [2], such as the Christchurch,
New Zealand shooter in 2019 who, before live-streaming his
attack on two mosques, posted his manifesto and shooting
intentions on the imageboard “8chan” [3]. Further studies
have also shown that, especially in extremist communities,
online education, communication, and training are much more
prevalent [4]. For example, of the extremists who plotted to
attack government targets (as opposed to civilian targets) 83%
“displayed traits of online learning”, and in the context of
violent extremism using Improvised Explosive Devices (IED),
those who plotted to use the IEDs were 3.34 times more likely,
while those who actually used IEDs were 4.57 times more
likely, to use online sources for their information [4]. Clearly,
extremists in general, make extensive use of the internet for
their preparations.
As empirical research is suggesting that online resources
are increasingly playing important roles in mobilizing extrem-
ists to violence, and that groups and movements mobilize
themselves online, law enforcement agencies are increasingly
recognizing the need to better understand these online mobi-
lization efforts [5]. Online indicators of malicious behaviour
are being developed by multiple law enforcement agencies
(for an example, see [6]) to try to detect imminent dangers,
by looking for speciﬁc actions by users, such as the posting
of martyrdom videos or statements, attempting to mobilize
others, or engaging in ideological discussions.
These indicators of imminent dangers are highly qualitative
and difﬁcult to detect. They are usually simple posts on online
discussion forums or social media. One way to detect such
dangers is to look for shifts in patterns in discussion. For ex-
ample, a sudden shift from election to a discussion around the
topic of “attacks” and “shooting” could be interesting. These
sudden shifts in topics of discussion could indicate that the
community is suddenly aware of a new trend or topic, which
could be of interest to law enforcement. Thus, by monitoring
online discussion forums, establishing baseline measures, and
then comparing sudden changes in topics of interest, it should
be possible to detect emerging threats. This is already in
action in other domains, such as Google Trends [7] or Twitter
Hashtag Trends [8] being used to model the emergence of
news. In this paper, we evaluate the viability of using a similar
approach using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect
emerging trends within the online right-wing discussion forum
StormFront with the eventual goal of creating a near-real-time
monitoring system capable of identifying trends in discussion
forums, as they emerge, giving law enforcement and security
organizations the awareness capability to act as something is
unfolding, rather than forensically after-the-fact.
In Section 2, we present a review of previous approaches to
researching StormFront and its agenda. Section 3 introduces
the method used to achieve the goal of the study. Section 4
provides a discussion on data exploration and data preparation.
In Section 5 we review results of the study and ﬁnally in
Section 6 we conclude the paper.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Communities like StormFront can be analysed for the
purpose of extracting information that help to describe them,
to understand their motivations and progression. A traditional
avenue of research is the manual gathering and processing
of information. Dentice [9] performed a manual approach
conducting interviews with representatives of different groups
related to right-wing communities and by manual exploration
of web resources, including the StormFront forum. The re-
search provided an understanding of right-wing communities
in Canada. Another manual approach analysed discussions
from StormFront to reveal the understanding of the forum
members’ behaviour [10].

Manual approaches provide interesting and veriﬁable re-
sults, but the main drawback is the poor scalability in terms of
high frequency data and the large volume of posts. Resource
allocation provides a limit to manual research for analysing
social media post en mass and may hinder the analysis of
communities were the number of posts may be in the millions.
One way to overcome this is to perform processing based on
machine learning of the community data.
In one study, the effects of intergroup conﬂicts on Storm-
Front and the behaviour of members were analyzed using NLP
techniques (including sentiment analysis and word frequency)
[11]. Another study described right-wing communities’ be-
haviour using sentiment analysis on data from the StormFront
forum [12]. Yet another approach used NLP and support vector
machine to classify the StormFront posts depending on the
rhetorical change in the posts [13]. However, the results of
these studies provide a general description and understanding
of right-wing communities; they do not provide the speciﬁcs of
discussion topics and their temporal shift. We address this gap
in our study of right-wing posts and detail a topic modeling
approach and trend analysis for StromFront forum discussions.
III. METHOD
Topic modelling is an NLP task to discover abstract topics
in a collection of documents. It assumes that each document in
a set of documents (corpus) contains one or more topics that
humans can understand; usually, those topics can be described
by a set of interrelated keywords.
Latent Semantic Analysis [14] is a statistical approach
that studies semantic distributions, relations between sets of
documents and words that form concepts. The assumption is
that closeness in meaning is related to closeness in textual
distance. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [15] is a topic
modelling method, which is an extension of Probabilistic
Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) [16]. LDA uses Dirichlet
priors for the document-topic and word-topic distributions,
which creates an improved generalisability compared to PLSA,
i.e., it performs better on new data.
LDA and PLSA are both based on the assumption that each
document in a corpus is a mixture over K topics, each topic,
in turn, is a mixture over all the words from the dictionary.
LDA is a generative model. Generative models work by ﬁrst
determining the input and output distributions and then uses
these distributions to generate additional synthetic input data.
Then, the algorithm determines if the generated data represents
the given data with an acceptable level of conﬁdence. If the
conﬁdence level is not acceptable, then the model generates
new data. This process runs in a loop.
In our case, the model generates bag-of-words distribution
using topics per document distribution Θ and words per topic
distribution ϕ. Θ and ϕ, in turn, are generated from a Dirichlet
distribution with the parameters α and β.
Figure 1 shows the graphical representation of this process
[15], where Z is topic-word and W word-document identities
for a particular word in a document. M and N are a number of
documents and a number of words in a particular document,
respectively.
Figure 1. Graphical representation (plate notation) for LDA [15].
The next step is the estimation, whether the generative
process has generated data close enough to the given data.
There are various ways of performing this task. The LDA
implementation, which we used, does it with the variational
Bayes algorithm.
LDA takes a ”bag of words” text representation as an input,
which is a drawback of LDA because a large vocabulary
grows the dimensionality, and as a result the computational
performance of the method. LDA takes at minimum one hyper-
parameter, the number of topics. The optimal number of topics
can be determined with perplexity as a metric. Perplexity is a
measurement of how good a probability distribution predicts
a sample.
IV. DATA
The goal of this paper is to identify emerging trends within
online right-wing communities to detect possible new events
and/or problems. A number of different right-wing online
forums exist online, and for this paper a speciﬁc right-wing
site, the online community StormFront, was chosen.

and contain approximately 12 million posts spread over 1
million threads by almost 360,000 users. The full dataset
consists of posts from the Stormfront forum from the 28th
of August of 2001 to the 29th of April 2020. The dataset
captured contains all thread and post information, containing
post-date, author of the post, post content, thread and sub-
forum information. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of posts
by year.
In this study, only data from 2015 onwards were con-
sidered. All posts containing only links, emojis, and those
with less than ﬁve words were excluded since they do not
tend to represent any topic but instead provide sentiments.
Furthermore, the dataset contained posts created in several
languages. Various languages in a corpus can confuse almost
all the vocabulary-based NLP models because each language
signiﬁcantly enlarges a corpus’s vocabulary. Therefore for each
post from the resulting dataset, the language was identiﬁed
using the fasttext model [19] [20]. Table I shows the top ten
languages and corresponding numbers of posts written in each
language. Only posts in English were used, resulting in a ﬁnal
total post count of 2,036,430.
V. RESULTS
A. Determining the number of topics
One of the hyperparameters for Latent Dirichlet Allocation
is the number of topics. To ﬁnd the best value, the perplexity
metric was used. Perplexity for a topic modelling model shows
an ability to generalise the results, that is, it shows how a
model performs if it were to be applied to data, which was
not used for training. For the experiment, the data were split
into training and testing data sets, 75% and 25% respectively.
Then LDA was trained on the training data, and applied to
the test data with the following numbers of topics 5, 10, 30,
40, 50, 70, 100 and 200, we calculated perplexity for each of
these values on the test set. The lowest perplexity value was
for 40 topics, and thus was the value that was used in the
following analysis.
B. Topics between January 2015 and April 2020
Once the model is trained and the hyperparameter value
was selected, an exploratory analysis was performed to get
preliminary insights from the matrix of the probability distri-
bution of topics for each document. Each value in this matrix
is the probability that the document belongs to the topic.
Figure 3 demonstrates the average probability for each topic.
The top three values of the average probability are for topics
30, 33 and 38, meaning that more posts tended to belong to
these topics. Consequently, these topics are discussed more
often than others in the forum. Table II shows the top ﬁfteen
keywords for these topics.

The general picture about topic distribution showed how
topics are distributed against each other, we wanted to identify
individual topics and determine if they can be used to detect
events, which happened from 2015 to 2020. Thus, monthly
average probabilities were calculated for each topic. It was
found that, as a way of presenting the level of discussion of a
particular topic, if the average probability of a topic is higher
in one period than in another then that topic was discussed
more during that period. In other words, posts had a higher
chance of belonging to this topic than to others; consequently
it means that the topic appeared more frequently in this period.
Figure 4 shows the comparison monthly average probabilities
of the most discussed topic (number 30) and the least discussed
(number 36). As shown on the plots, one line is higher than
the other in all the points, meaning that topic 30 was always
discussed more than topic 36 since 2015. Words on the top of
each plot are the top keywords for the topic.
For example, a randomly selected post from topic 30 stated:

I was on my way back from the gym today when I could see
two negro boys walking towards me. I knew, but absolutely
knew, they were going to say something to me. As soon as
they get within ﬁve feet of me they start grunting and looking
at my shirt and reading the letters on it out loud. What is it
with Negro kids? Whites never seem to do that kind of thing.
It’s like the Negro can’t let anyone walk in peace. They HAVE
to be noticed or afﬁrmed. Even if it means embarrassing a
complete stranger.
While a randomly selected post from topic 36 stated:
Quote: Bolivia plans to ask for a public meeting of the
United Nations Security Council after U.S. President Donald
Trump announces on Wednesday that the United States rec-
ognizes occupied Al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the capital of the
Zionist entity and will move its embassy there. Bolivian U.N.
Ambassador Sacha Sergio Llorentty Soliz said it would be a
“reckless and a dangerous decision that goes against inter-
national law, the resolutions of the Security Council, it also
weakens any effort for peace in the region and also upsets the
whole region.” Bolivia to Seek UN Security Council Meeting

The probabilities of some of the topics have spikes, which
indicate that it is likely that some disruption occurred around
that time, reﬂecting the events in the real world. For example,
Figures 5 and 6 show spikes in the second half of 2016, and it
is likely that both topics are related to the 2016 United States
presidential election [21], meaning that in the second half of
2016 the election-related these topics were being discussed a
lot. This is a completely expected result, which validates the
methods presented here.
Topic 16 contained a series of health-related keywords (ex:
drug, medical, disease). Throughout 2015-2020, this topic was
relatively consistent, and a relatively minor topic. However, at
the beginning of 2020, discussions around this topic increased
ﬁve-fold (Figure 7), exactly coinciding with the emergence of
the COVID-19 pandemic [22].

Several other topics also had spikes in August 2017; there-
fore, they were analysed in more detail to check if there is a
relationship among them. Figures 9 and 10 show the weekly
data for 2017 for two topics; both of which increased in August
2017. The spike for the topic with keywords ”car shot dead
ﬁght” happens around week 33 (corresponding to the week
of August 13, 2017) and most probably reﬂects discussions
around Barcelona’s crowd rammings, which occurred August
17, 2017 [24]. Another topic with keywords ”hate speech
media university” has posts related to the Unite the Right rally
in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017 [25] and the Annual
Stormfront Smoky Mountain Summit in September 2017. All
the spikes in August-September 2017 have different natures,
and thus it was concluded that the spikes are not related to
each other.

C. Weekly topics in 2019
The analysis of long periods is essential because it
shows the general patterns, but the detection of smaller-scale
events would allow security organizations to potentially detect
quickly emerging threats or problems. Therefore data from
January 2019 to May 2020 (non-inclusive) was selected, and
the same trained model was applied. When all the topics were
returned, the weekly average probabilities for each topic were
calculated.
Figure 11 demonstrates the topic’s results with keywords

coincides with a United States drone strike near Baghdad
International Airport, resulting in an assassination of the major
general Qasem Soleimani [26].

increase in June 2019 is likely related with Trump’s launch

Moreover, two peaks, at the beginning of July 2019 and end of
September, coincide with his July 4th speech and with the 74th
Session of the United Nations General Assembly, respectively.
VI. CONCLUSION
The models’ and further analysis’ results demonstrate that
there is a correlation between real events and topics discussed
on the forum; however, correlation does not imply causation,
and thus we do not claim that the topics within the discussions
lead to actions. We can see what speciﬁc topics have peaks at
the time when something happens.
The distribution of topics (the vector of average probabilities
of each topic within a certain period) can represent a snapshot
of the community agenda, which in turn shows a general
picture of the community members’ attention. The model and
further analysis of its results can show how the community
reacts to the events - if it is a brief blimp, quickly reverting to
average, then it disappeared from the agenda pretty quickly,
see Figure 8, or if there is a sudden surge gradually decreasing
to average after the event then it was an impactful event of
great interest within the community, see Figure 5.
However, the proposed work has several areas of improve-
ment. First of all, it is based on a bag-of-words representation
of text, it works well for English because it is an analytical
language, but if the intention is to use the model with more
synthetic languages, for example Finnish, then changes are
required, which help to reduce vocabulary of the corpus
(for example, lemmatisation). Further, the model should be
retrained from time to time to stay relevant, and ﬁnally, the
model depends on some random processes so results can differ
from run to run.
In conclusion, we can claim that anyone who analyses
large-scale communities like StormFront - researchers, law
enforcement, and security organisations - can use the proposed
methods to detect changes in discussion topics, and detect new
topics of interest.
