Abstract—Cloud cost optimization is an important issue having
also impact on the economy of the Cloud service, since it
enables the Cloud service provider the service provisioning at
minimum cost. This paper provides the performance analysis
and cost optimization of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud
model with a capacity control policy. The Virtual Machines are
modelled as parallel resources, which can be either in active
or in standby state. The capacity of the cloud is controlled
by changing the number of active Virtual Machines. The cost
model, which the cloud provider encounters, takes into account
both energy consumption and performance measures. The major
objective of the work is to provide a tractable analytic model,
which is suitable for practical use. For this purpose, we model
the Cloud services by an M/M/M/K queue. We propose a
simple control policy, in which a predeﬁned portion of Virtual
Machines are always active. The remaining ones are activated
simultaneously when the number of requests reaches a threshold
and deactivated when the number of requests falls below the
predeﬁned portion of active Virtual Machines. We call this policy
as shifted N-policy. We provide the stationary analysis of the
model and derive closed form results for the distribution of the
number of requests as well as for several performance measures.
The cost model leads to a discrete optimization task, which
we approximate by a nonlinear continuous optimization task.
After applying numerous approximations, we provide, in form
of solution formulas, approximate solutions of the optimization
task in the two most relevant trafﬁc ranges. We give illustrating
examples for the most important approximations and properties
of the model as well as validate the approximate solution formulas
by numeric optimization. The major results of the work are
the closed form approximate solution formulas, which give the
optimal threshold under the most relevant ranges of parameters
and provide insight into the dependency of the optimum on the
model and cost parameters.
Keywords—optimization; cloud model; queueing model; N-
policy.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cloud cost optimization is an important issue having also
impact on the economy of the Cloud service, since it enables
the Cloud service provider the service provisioning at mini-
mum cost. This paper is an extension of our previous work [1],
in which we provided a performance evaluation and optimiza-
tion of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Cloud model with
a proposed simple threshold based resource control. The major
objective of this research is to establish a tractable analytic
model, which is also suitable for practical use.
The growing demand for computational resources lead to
a concept of Cloud computing. With a wide spreaded use
of computer networks, new applications emerged in the ’90-
s in many areas, e.g., business, science or web-applications.
They created a growing demand for computational resources,
which does not necessarily locate locally. This lead to a new
distributed computing paradigm called Cloud computing [2]
[3] [4] [5]. In this work, we focus on IaaS type Cloud service,
in which computing resources are delivered to customers. Be-
sides of the physically distributed character of Cloud services,
another key attribute of clouds is the virtualization, which
enables to decouple the computing resources from the physical
hardware and deliver them to customers as Virtual Machines
(VM).
The users want guaranteed performance and the Cloud
service provider want to ensure it and supervise the operation.
These require proper performance modelling and evaluation
enabling to get insights into the relationships among the used
resources and the performance.
However, the performance evaluation of Cloud services is
a complex issue, since it depends on many factors. Ana-
lytic models are either too simpliﬁed to obtain meaningful
relationships or lead to rather complex numeric solution,
which does not provide an explicit relationships among the
used resources and the performance. There are many research
works on performance modelling of clouds. An advanced work
on performance analysis is [6], which provides a numeric
solution. An outstanding work is [7], in which a multi-
level interacting stochastic sub-models approach is proposed,
leading to a numeric method to compute the performance
measures. For an overview on research works on performance
evaluation of clouds the reader is referred to the survey [8]
and the references herein.
Cloud cost optimization requires a resource management
technique. The work [9] provides an approach to predict
resource usage in Cloud computing, which can be seen as a
simplest way to enable the managing of the system. Resource
scheduling techniques are proposed in [10], [11] and [12].
Energy-aware resource allocation mechanism for management
of clouds is proposed in [13]. Energy efﬁcient resource man-
agement and allocation policies for clouds are summarized
in [14] [15]. One recent efﬁcient resource control mechanism
for clouds is the threshold based activation and deactivation of
VMs, proposed e.g., in [16]. This mechanism can be modelled
by hysteresis queue and in [16] computational algorithms are
provided for computing the optimal thresholds. For another
numerical approaches to cloud cost optimization we refer to
[17] and [18]. As expected, optimization of clouds is even
more complex issue than its performance evaluation. There-
fore, the vast majority of works on Cloud cost optimization

proposes a computational solution.
In this paper, we present a performance evaluation and
optimization of an IaaS Cloud model with a proposed simple
threshold based resource control, but in contrast to the vast
majority of relevant works, we provide approximate explicit
formulas for determining the only threshold of the control
mechanism. The formulas hold in most relevant range of
parameters. The resource control mechanism, introduced in
[1], is called as shifted N-policy. According to this policy, a
predeﬁned portion of VMs are always active. The remaining
ones are activated simultaneously when the number of requests
reaches a threshold N (like in N-policy) and deactivated when
the number of requests falls below the predeﬁned portion of
active VMs. This explains the name of the policy. The cloud
is modeled by multi-server M/M/M/K queue. Note that, as
pointed out in [19], the M/M/m queue can be an acceptable
approximation of the GI/GI/m queue until the coefﬁcient of
variations of both the interarrival and the service times are not
far from 1.
In [1], we presented closed form results for the stationary
distribution of the number of requests and several performance
measures in the shifted N-policy M/M/M/K model. The
cost model lead to a discrete optimization task, which we
approximated by a nonlinear continuous optimization task. We
provided a closed form approximate solution formula for the
high trafﬁc range, in which the utilization is higher than a
model parameter dependent threshold.
In this work, we recall the results of [1] and extend the
solution of the optimization task to the low trafﬁc range,
i.e., in which the utilization is lower than the above model
parameter dependent threshold. Additionally, we generalize
the former approximate solution formula for the high trafﬁc
range by relaxing its restrictions by omitting the condition on
cost parameters. Moreover, we also provide the details of the
stationary analyis and the derivations both in the former and
new optimization parts.
The major contributions of this research are the closed form
approximate solution formulas for the optimal value of the
threshold N under the most relevant ranges of parameters.
The secondary contribution of this research is the proposal
of the shifted N-policy control mechanism and its stationary
analysis in the context of M/M/M/K model. The advantage
of using the proposed shifted N-policy control is that it
makes the cloud resource management very simple due to
the approximate analytic formulas for the optimal threshold,
i.e., no need for computational algorithm. On the other hand,
it leads to somewhat higher optimal cost than other more
complex computational solutions, e.g., the hysteresis policy
with multi-thresholds. The proposed optimization can be used
for example for the use case ”Enabling add-on services on top
of the infrastructure”, e.g., computing-as-a-service, analytics
or Business Intelligence(BI)-as-a-service.
We also provide illustrating examples for the approxima-
tions and the most important properties of the model as well
as validate the approximate solution formulas by numeric
optimization in the relevant range of parameters.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II is
devoted to the description of the model. The stationary analysis
of the queueing model is given in Section III. In Section IV, we
construct the cost function to be optimized. The dependency
of the probability of the empty system on threshold N, as
fundamental building block of the optimization, is investigated
in Section V. The approximate minimization for high trafﬁc
range is presented in Section VI. This is followed by estab-
lishing the approximate minimization for low trafﬁc range in
Section VII. In Section VIII, we illustrate the approximate
solution formulas as well as provide their numeric validation.
The work is concluded in Section IX.
II. CLOUD MODEL DESCRIPTION
In this section, we give the description of the IaaS Cloud
model and the shifted N-policy queueing model.
A. IaaS Cloud model
The IaaS Cloud delivers low-level computational resources
to the users. The Physical Machines (PMs) are grouped into
two pools: active (running) and standby machines. The PMs
in standby can represent either turned-on (but not ready) or
turned-off machines. The computational resources are pro-
vided to users in the form of VMs. Total number of available
VMs is M > 100, from which 0.1M ≤ L ≤ 0.5M VMs are
always active. The resource control is realized by threshold
based activation and deactivation of the remaining M − L
VMs. The model has buffer with capacity for K − M ≫ 1
users. When all active VMs are busy upon arrival of a new
request then it is directed into the buffer, where it waits until
getting an access to a VM becoming free. When the buffer is
full upon arrival of a new request, then the request is lost.
B. Shifted N-policy queueing model
The queueing system modelling the IaaS Cloud is an
M/M/M/K queue with shifted N-policy. In the queueing
context the VMs are called as servers. The request arrive
according to Poisson process with rate λ > 0 and the service
times are exponentially distributed with parameter µ > 0.
The arrival process and the service process are assumed to
be mutually independent. The system has M ≥ 1 servers and
buffer capacity for K − M ≫ 1 requests. When the servers
and the buffer are full upon arrival of a new request, then the
request is lost.
The control of the VMs is realized by the newly proposed
shifted N-policy. According to this policy L < M servers
are always active. When the queueing system is empty then
the remaining M − L servers are in standby. They will be
activated simultaneously when the number of requests in the
system reaches the threshold L + 1 ≤ N ≤ M. After having
all the M servers active, M − L servers will be deactivated
simultaneously, when the number of requests in the system
reaches again L. This policy has hysteresis-like characteristic
(in number of requests), which makes it suitable to use as
energy efﬁcient resource control. However, it is much simpler

than the hysteresis queue, which could facilitate the developing
of analytically tractable approximation.
The queue is always stable due to the ﬁniteness of the
underlying Continuous-Time Markov chain (CTMC) model
(see in Section III). The (approximate) utilization of the
system, denoted by ρ is given by
ρ =
λ
Mµ.
(1)
Although this expression would be exact only in case of
K − M = ∞, otherwise the blocking probability should be
also taken into account to get an exact expression, under the
model assumption K − M ≫ 1 the expression (1) can be
considered as a good approximation of the utilization.
III. ANALYSIS OF THE QUEUING MODEL
Let n ≥ 0 be the number of requests in the system. The
process {n(t), t ≥ 0} is a ﬁnite state CTMC.

Figure 1. State diagram.
Basically the states are denoted according to the number of
requests in the system. However, the notation of the states,
in which the L < n < N, depends on the number of active
servers. If there are L active servers then the states are denoted
by the number −(N − n). Otherwise (i.e., there are M active
servers) the default numbering, n is used. On this way the
states can be described as a contiguous range [−(N − L −
1), . . . , −1, 0, 1, . . . , K].
B. Stationary analysis
We perform the stationary analysis rather by utilizing the
principle of global balance equations instead of applying the
standard way by means of equilibrium equations. This results
in shorter derivations for the stationary distribution of the
number of requests in the system. We deﬁne the stationary
probability, pi as the probability that the system is in state i,
for −(N − L − 1) ≤ i ≤ K.
1) Global balance equations: We marked the selected set
of states used for the balance equations on the state diagram.
Each case is marked by a separator line and an associated
number in small square, which is used to identify the case.

2) Lµp−(N−L−1) + λp−1 = λpL,

7) Mµpt+1 = λpt, t = M, . . . , K − 1.
2) Stationary distribution of the number of requests: By
solving the balance equations by applying standard techniques
(see in Appendix (I)), we get the stationary distribution of the
number of requests as

IV. COST FUNCTION
In this section, we establish the cost model of the cloud
provider and apply it to the shifted N-policy queue. This results
in the cost function.
A. Cost model
The cloud provider encounters different type of costs with
different weights. These are taken into account by the help of
cost parameters, which are deﬁned by
• Con - cost of an active VM/time unit,
• Coff- cost of a standby VM/time unit,
• CW - cost of waiting of a request/time unit
(= holding a request in the buffer/time unit),
• CR - cost of loss of an arriving request,
• CA - activation cost of a VM (changing from standby to
active state),
• CD - deactivation cost of a VM (changing from active to
standby state).
Using these parameters the cloud cost can be speciﬁed by
the following function
Ccloud = E[ number of active servers ] Con
(4)
+ E[ number of standby servers ] Coff
+ E[W] CW + ploss λ CR,
+ ( activation rate of standby VMs ) (M − L) CA
+ ( deactivation rate of active VMs ) (M − L) CD,
where E[ ] stands for the expected value of a random variable,
W is the waiting time of the requests in the buffer and ploss
is the probability of loss.
Note that the operation of N-policy implies that one of the
major trade-off of the model is the relation Con −Coff versus
CW , which in fact appears also in the approximate solution
formulas for computing the threshold N (via parameter A
see in subsections VI-F and VII-D, where parameters b and c
depend on A).
B. Constructing the cost function
The cost function, to be optimized, can be constructed by
applying the cost model (4) to the shifted N-policy queue.
1) Adapting the cost model to the shifted N-policy queue:
The so far unknown terms arising in (4) can be expressed
with the help of parameters, stationary probabilities and per-
formance measures of the shifted N-policy queue as follows.
E[ number of active servers ] = L + (1 − ps1)(M − L), (5)
E[ number of standby servers ] = ps1(M − L),
( activation rate of standby VMs ) = λ p−1,
( deactivation rate of active VMs ) = (L + 1)µ pL+1,
where ps1 = P { the number of active VMs = L }.
Substituting the expressions (5) into (4) we get the cost
function, F1 as
F1 =

L + (1 − ps1)(M − L)

Con + ps1(M − L) Coff
+ E[W] CW + ploss λ CR
+ λ p−1 (M − L) CA+(L + 1)µ pL+1(M − L) CD. (6)
2) Performance measures: The performance measures ps1,
ploss and E[W] inﬂuence the cloud cost. They are given by

3) Final form of the cost function F1: Applying the balance
equation (L + 1)µpL+1 = λp−1, the expression of p−1 from
(3), (9) and (8) in (6) as well as performing rearrangements
yields

V. CHARACTERIZING p0 AS A DEPENDENCY OF N
Unfortunately p0, which is involved in almost every term
of (13) via the expression of pL, depends on N. Now we
characterize p0 as a dependency of N in order to identify
parameter regions, in which p0 is approximately independent
of N. This leads to further restriction on the parameter range.

which are the terms of the coefﬁcient of p0 in the normaliza-
tion equation, i.e., pswp0 = 1, where psw = ps1w + ps2w +
ps3w + ps4w and it is referred as psum. Moreover, the values
ps1w, ps2w, ps3w and ps4w are referred as psum1, psum2,
psum3 and psum4, respectively, or simple psum parts.
We assume K−M ≫ 1. Under this assumption ρK−M ≪ 1
holds for the whole trafﬁc range ρ < 1 and thus the term
ρK−M can be neglected comparing to 1. Using it, the approx-
imation of ps4w, denoted by p∗
s4w, for the whole trafﬁc range

The evaluation of the N dependency of the psum parts
requires further approximations. However, these approxima-
tions themself depend on the trafﬁc range. Therefore, in the
following we split the investigation of the N dependency of
p0 according to the trafﬁc ranges determining the appropriate
approximations.
A. Trafﬁc range
λ
Lµ > 1
We assume N−L ≫ 1. Under this assumption ( λ
Lµ)N−L ≫
1 holds for the trafﬁc range
λ
Lµ > 1 and thus the term
( λ
Lµ)N−L dominates over 1. We make use of this in the

1) Approximation for ps1 and α: Using ( λ

second term of ps1 in (7) can be approximated as

Note that

λ , for
λ
Lµ > ξ with ξ = 1.2, is small
compared to (N − L) due to N − L ≫ 1 and hence the effect
of the overestimation by the upper limit can be neglected.
Similarly, by using ( λ

this trafﬁc range as
α ≈

By using the above approximations of ps1 and α, the
approximations of the terms ps1w, ps2w and ps3w, denoted
by p∗
s1w, p∗
s2w and p∗
s3w, respectively, can be given as

2) Behavior of ps2w + ps3w in dependency of N: Here-
inafter it will be shown that the sum p∗
s2w + p∗
s3w is approx-
imately independent of N when ρ is above some threshold,
which depends on M
L .
Taking the difference of p∗
s2w and p∗
s3w with respect to N
gives

Now we compare ∆N(p∗

can be approximated as

because

depending on the value of N. Thus for the trafﬁc range, for
which f1 > 1 holds, ∆N(p∗
s2w + p∗
s3w) can be neglected
comparing to p∗
s2w(L + 1) + p∗
s3w(L + 1). Applying it
recursively to p∗

This means that the sum ps2w + ps3w approximately inde-

of 1, and therefore ∆N(p∗

compared to p∗

the value ps2w + ps3w depends on N in the trafﬁc range, for
which f1 < 1 holds.

f1 is close to 1, still have to be estimated. An upper limit

for q at f1 close to 1 (see in Appendix III-C) to q = λ
µ and
A = L leading to λ
µ < Le
5.5
L . In order to ensure the validity of
the above approximations the value of f1 must be somewhat
above 1, thus we set f1 = 1.1. Taking into account that, by
neglecting the dependency of f0 on
λ
µ, f1 is approximately
proportional to λ
µ we get an upper limit at the trafﬁc range
boundary, denoted by ρc, as
ρc =
λ
Mµ < L
M 1.1e
5.5
L ⪅ L
M 1.2 for L ≥ 60.
Although the above factor 1.1e
5.5
L ≈ 1.2 increases for L <
60, the quotient M
L also increases and thus it causes a counter-
effect due to higher overestimation of λ
µ by the upper limit,
which together justify the keeping of the approximate factor
1.2.
3) The sum ps2w+ps3w versus ps1w: If f1 > 1 then p∗
s2w+
p∗
s3w ≈ f M−L+1
1
f1−1 (1 − Lµ
λ ) pL
p0 due to M − L ≫ 1. In this case
the major term f M−L+1
1
≫ (N −L) and hence p∗
s2w+p∗
s3w ≫
(N −L) pL
p0 = p∗
s1w, which implies that p∗
s1w can be neglected
comparing to p∗
s2w + p∗
s3w.
On the other hand, if f1
< 1 then p∗
s2w + p∗
s3w
≈
f1
1−f1 (1− Lµ
λ ) pL
p0 and the coefﬁcient
f1
1−f1 (1− Lµ
λ ) becomes less
than N − L. It follows that p∗
s1w dominates over p∗
s2w + p∗
s3w
and hence p∗
s1w + p∗
s2w + p∗
s3w depends linearly on N in the
corresponding trafﬁc range.
4) Effect of ps4w: Observe that the expression of ps4w∗ in
(15) without the ﬁrst multiplication factor
ρ
1−ρ is the same
as the value of the expression of ps3w in (14) for k = M.
The item
( λ
µ )k
k!
in the sum PM
k=L+1
( λ
µ )k
k!
takes its maximum
at k ≈ λ
µ, since
λ
µ
k > 1 for k < λ
µ and
λ
µ
k < 1 for k > λ
µ.
It follows that the major part of p∗
s3w is determined by the
items ( λ
µ − ∆) ≤ k ≤
λ
µ + ∆) for some ∆. The last item
with k = M can contribute to the sum practically only if
λ
µ > M − ∆. For such a case ρ =
λ
Mµ is close to 1 for which
also the multiplication factor in (15),
ρ
1−ρ, has a value ≫ 1.
It follows that ps4w can emerge to the magnitude of the
value of ps3w, and thus that of the sum ps2w + ps3w, only for
ρ close to 1, otherwise it is negligible compared to that sum.
On the other hand, we show that ps4w is independent of
N for values of ρ close to 1. Applying the formula for
PB
k=A+1
k!
qk
qA
A! (see in Appendix III-D) to A = L − 1,
B = N − 1, the expression of p∗
s4w, (15), can be rearranged

It can be seen from the above formula that, for values of ρ

5) Illustrating
the
relations
of
the
magnitudes
of
ps1w, ps2w, ps3w, ps4w
and
their
sum:
The
magnitudes
of ps1w, ps2w, ps3w, ps4w and their sum compared to each
other are illustrated on Figures 2, 3 and 4. The ﬁgures
were created by varying ρ under the parameter setting
M
= 200, L = 50, K = 300, µ = 1. It can be seen
on Figure 2 that the sum ps3w + ps4w is approximately
independent of N and dominates over the other terms as
expected due to ρ = 0.6 > 1.2 L
M = 0.3. These relations
start to change as ρ gets closer to 1.2 L
M , where the sum
ps3w + ps4w starts to depend on N and ps1w starts to emerge
comparing to ps3w + ps4w as well as starts to affect the
overall sum psw to become linear with N.

on Figure 4 with ρ = 0.3, where the dependency of the overall
sum psw on N becomes clearly linear.
B. Trafﬁc range
λ
Lµ < 1
We assume again N − L ≫ 1. Under this assumption
( λ
Lµ)N−L ≪ 1 holds for the trafﬁc range
λ
Lµ < 1 and thus
the term ( λ
Lµ)N−L can be neglected compared to 1.

Using the notations h =
λ
Lµ and z = N −L the derivative of
the major part of the last term in (16) with respect to z is given
by (zhz)′ = hz(z ln(h) + 1). Thus, a condition for z ln(h) +
1 < 0 is z >
−1
ln(h), since ln(h) < 0. The inequalities ln(h) <
−0.22 and
−1
ln(h) < 4.5 hold for h < 0.8, and hence z > 10 is
sufﬁcient for (zhz)′ < 0. It follows that for N − L ≫ 1, e.g.,
for N − L > 10, the nonnegative term (N − L)( λ
Lµ)N−L is
monotone decreasing with increasing N −L. Then it is enough
to compute the values of the middle and the last terms of (16)
for several values of
λ
Lµ with N −L = 10 to see the magnitude
of the last term comparing to the middle one. It turns out that
except for high
λ
Lµ (above 0.8) and low (N − L) (⪅ 40) the
last term of (16) can be neglected compared to the middle one.
Taking it into account, we get another approximation for ps1
as
ps1 ≈

the approximation of α in this trafﬁc range as
α ≈

1 − λ

(18)

The formula (19) also shows that ps1w is approximately
independent of N in the trafﬁc range of
λ
Lµ < 1, except for
the rather small sub-range mentioned at the derivation of (17).
In the following we establish a lower limit for the ﬁrst term
of ps1w for λ

(20)
Therefore, the magnitude of the multiplication factor of pL

in the ﬁrst term of ps1w falls in the magnitude of ten and
above.
3) The sum ps2w + ps3w compared to ps1w: The approxi-
mate expression p∗

This implies ρ ≤ 0, 5 in the trafﬁc range of

The

other are illustrated on Figures 5, 6 and 7. The ﬁgures
were created by varying ρ under the parameter setting
M = 200, L = 100, K = 250, µ = 1. It can be seen on
Figure 5 that the probability coefﬁcient ps1w is approximately
independent of N and dominates over the other terms as
expected due to

ρ ≤ 0.8 L
M = 0.4. This
independence start to change as ρ becomes higher than

the overall sum psw start to depend on N for low N − L.

on Figure 7 with ρ = 0.45, where also the starting increase of

that p0 is independent of N for N ⪆ 110, which corresponds
to N − L ≈ 10 ≫ 1.

Figure 9. Probability p0 in dependency of threshold N, low

For the ﬁrst sight it seems that there is a dependency on N
in the range of 100 ≤ N ⪅ 130. However, the value of p0
changes in relative less then 0.3%. Therefore, the ﬁgure shows
that p0 is independent of N practically in the whole range of
N > 100.
VI. APPROXIMATE MINIMIZATION - IN TRAFFIC RANGE
λ
Lµ > 1
In the N independent regions of p0 also pL is independent of
N. Hence, the function to be minimized, (13), can be reduced
by omitting the N independent term MCon and dividing it by
pL. This results in a function F2, to be minimized, as
F2 =

λ(CA + CD)(M − L) + η sL,N

α + CW τ

− (Con − Coff)(M − L)ps1
pL
.
(23)
The optimization of (23) with respect to N still seems
not to be tractable on analytic way due to the complex
dependency of several of its terms on N, like sL,N or τ.
Therefore, we simplify the optimization task by applying
approximations, like the ones for α and ps1. On the other
hand, these approximations will restrict the parameter range,
for which they hold.
A. Approximating the function to be minimized
Besides of the approximations for α and ps1, we need
approximation also for τ.
1) Approximation for τ:
When N − L
≫
1 then
( λ
Lµ)N−L ≫ 1 holds for the trafﬁc range
λ
Lµ > 1 and thus the
term 1 − ( λ
Lµ)N−L can be approximated by −( λ
Lµ)N−L. Uti-
lizing it in the expression of τ in (10) gives the approximation
for τ as

2) Applying the approximations for p0, α, τ and ps1: The
minimizing task can be signiﬁcantly reduced by applying the
approximations of α, τ and ps1 in (23). This leads to the
approximate objective function F2app as

B. Approximate equation for determining the local minimum

minimum of (24) by taking its difference with respect to N
and setting ∆NF2app ≈ 0. Evaluating ∆

gives

In order to get closer to the solution of equation (25) ﬁrst
we investigate its structure.
C. Structure of the equation
To identify the structure of equation (25), we simplify its
form by applying further approximations. The relation K −
M − 1 >> 1 holds usually under practical settings. Hence,
the term ( λ
Mµ)K−M+1 can be neglected due to ρ =

which gives an approximation for σ as

constitutes the structure of the equation. Its magnitude varies
in a huge range for larger M and N depending on the value
of the parameters. Therefore, we also use its natural logarithm
in the course of the analysis. By introducing the notation
p(ρ, N) =
( λ

( λ

the equation (27) can be given in a short form as
p(ρ, N)u0(ρ) = r(ρ, N).
(28)
D. Properties of function p(ρ, N)
The approximate global solution of the considered mini-
mization task requires the knowledge of several properties of
function p(ρ, N).
1) Dependency on ρ: Applying the Stirling formula n! ≈

p(ρ, N) gives an approximation as

It can be seen from (29) that the dependency of p(ρ, N) on
ρ follows power law. This leads to rapid changes under the
typical model parameter settings, e.g., increasing ρ by 2.5%
at M − N + 1 = 95 leads to 10 times multiplication due to
1.02595 ≈ 10.
2) Dependency of p(ρ, N) on N: Taking the natural loga-
rithm of (29) we get
ln [p(ρ, N)] = (M − N + 1)

ln(ρ) + 1

By introducing the notation

this can be rewritten as

,
since in the typical model parameter ranges β ≥ L
M ≥ 0.1 and
M > 100 and thus, except in the small sub-range β ≈ ρ, the
term
1
2∗M∗β can be neglected. The ﬁrst derivative of p(ρ, N)
with respect to N comes by using ∂ p(ρ,N)
∂N

∂(eln[p(ρ,N)])

p(ρ, N) ∂ ln[p(ρ,β)]

, which yields
∂ p(ρ, N)

β


.
(31)
The sign of ln( β
ρ ) divides the β − ρ plane into two disjunct
sub-areas regarding the characteristic of p(ρ, N) with respect
to N as
p(ρ, N) is

monotone decreasing, if β < ρ
monotone increasing, if β ≥ ρ

.
(32)
Moreover the dependency of p(ρ, N) on N is faster than
exponential, since | ln( β
ρ )| is increasing with decreasing N
(increasing N) in the range β < ρ (β ≥ ρ).
3) The ”low magnitude range”: We investigate the case
when p(ρ, N) = econst holds, where const is a given real
constant. With the notation of β this equation can be given by
M

(1 − β)

ln(ρ) + 1

+

β +


ln(β)

= const.
(33)
Observe that this equation implicitly deﬁnes a boundary func-
tion β(ρ) (or equivalently ρ(β)), which separates the ”low
magnitude range” p(ρ, N) ≤ econst from the complementer
range, in which p(ρ, N) > econst. In the range p(ρ, N) ≤
econst the magnitude of ln(p(ρ, N)) is less than const, which
explains the name ”low magnitude range”. We say that a β−ρ
point is inside and outside of the ”low magnitude range”
if p(ρ, β) ≤ econst holds and does not hold for that point,
respectively. By rearranging (33) we get the expression of
ln(ρ) along the boundary function as
ln(ρ) =
const
(1 − β) M −
β
1 − β ln(β) − 1
−

(1 − β) 2 M ln(β).
Therefore, the sensitivity of ln(ρ) with respect to the const,
ζ is given by
ζ =
1
(1 − β) M .
(34)
An upper limit for the factor ln( β
ρ ) determining the relation
between p(ρ, N) and its ﬁrst derivative with respect to N (see
(31)) along the boundary function can be obtained as

boundary curve, the ”low magnitude range” is located above
the red marked boundary curve. Note that for const ≥ 0, the
whole range above the boundary curve belongs to the ”low

β above β = ρ and ln(p(ρ, 1)) = 0 ≤ const.
4) Monotonicity of ρ(β): The ﬁrst derivative of the bound-
ary function ρ(β) with respect to β can be determined from
(33) by applying the implicit function’s derivative rule. This
leads to

The relation (36) implies that ρ is monotone increasing with

E. Constructing the approximate minimization
1) Solution regimes: For the sake of better understanding
of the idea of the solution, ﬁrst we consider a modiﬁed form
of the equation (28) as
p(ρ, N) = r(ρ, N).
(37)
The idea of the approximate solution is based on the concept
of ”low magnitude range”. Let Ns stand for the solution of
r(ρ, N) = 0. Since d r(ρ,N)
dN
= −CW , the value of r(ρ, N)
changes from 0 up to CW while decreasing N from Ns
to Ns − 1. On the other hand, the value of p(ρ, N) falls
between 0 and CW everywhere in the ”low magnitude range”
with const = ln(CW ). Hence, if Ns − 1 falls inside of
the ”low magnitude range” then it follows that r(ρ, N) must
cross p(ρ, N) somewhere between Ns and Ns − 1 due to
the continuity of r(ρ, N). Therefore, Ns can be considered
as approximate solution of (37).
We denote the value of N on the boundary curve by Nb,
which depends on ρ. Due to (35), | ln( β
ρ ) |⪅ 0.5 and hence,
along the boundary curve, the ﬁrst derivative of p(ρ, N) is in
the magnitude of −CW and the dependency of p(ρ, N) on N
is faster than exponential. Let us investigate a case, for which
Ns − 1 falls inside the ”low magnitude range”, i.e., it locates
above the boundary curve for some value of ρ. By decreasing
N, at N = Nb, we have r(ρ, Nb) > CW = p(ρ, Nb). By
further decreasing N, the ﬁrst derivative of p(ρ, N) becomes
in absolute value greater than that one of r(ρ, N), and hence,
afterwards an other cross point of the functions p(ρ, N) and
r(ρ, N) must exist, let us say at N = N1. This is a maximum
point of the cost function, since at this point (in N), with
decreasing N, the sign of p(ρ, N) − r(ρ, N) changes from
negative to positive. After further decreasing N it reaches the
point, N = N2, where the value of the cost function falls
under Ns. The situation is illustrated on Figure 12.

N_b
Figure 12. Example cost function.
The above discussed decrease from Nb to N2 in any range
of N, in which p(ρ, N) is monotone decreasing with respect
to N, causes an increase in the value of p(ρ, N), which
equivalently can be also considered as an increase in const
of (33). This change in const corresponds to a shift of the
boundary curve to right (see (34)). Hence, the points with N2
in a dependency of ρ lie on another boundary curve with an
increased const, where ∆const (= the increase in const) is
determined by the change p(ρ, Nb) → p(ρ, N2).
If ρ > ρb then the point in β corresponding to N1 (locating
under the boundary curve) can fall over the βlow line. Until
N2 falls still below the βlow line, the value of the cost
function at βlow is still higher than at βs (corresponding to
Ns), and therefore the global minimum of the cost function
is still at Ns. However, if N2 also falls above βlow line then
the global minimum of the cost function is just above βlow
(corresponding to N = L + 1). If ρ > ρb, it can also happen
that βs falls outside of the ”low magnitude range” (= under
the boundary curve and above the βlow line). In this case
| d p(ρ,N)
dN
| is either still ≤ CW or it is also possible, with
βs far under the boundary curve, that it is > CW . In the later
case there is no cross point at all, as well as the cost function
is monotone increasing with respect to N and hence the global
minimum is just above βlow. Note that in the range N > Ns
there can not be any cross point of the functions p(ρ, N) and
r(ρ, N), since p(ρ, N) > 0 and r(ρ, N) < 0 in that range.
It follows from the above argumentation that the global
minimum of the cost function is approximately at Ns in the
range of ρ < ρb and βlow ≤ βs < 1, since in this case
the boundary curve locates under the horizontal βlow line and
hence βs always falls in the ”low magnitude range”. Above
ρb there is a gap in ρ until a speciﬁc point, ρs, at which N2
reaches the βlow line and hence in this gap βs can fall also
below the boundary curve. However, the derivative of p(ρ, N)
with respect to N is in absolute still less then CW while Ns
not much less than Nb (see (35)) and therefore we assume
that the global minimum of the cost function still close to Ns.
Finally above ρs the position of the global minimum of the

cost function changes to N = L + 1.
The position of ρs depends on ∆const, which, as change
in const, causes a shift of the boundary ρ, from ρb to ρs.
2) The magnitude of ∆const: The change in const is a sum
of the changes due to p(ρ, Nb) → p(ρ, N1) and p(ρ, N1) →
p(ρ, N2) on ln level.
The ﬁrst part of the sum counts for the increase p(ρ, Nb) →
p(ρ, N1) on ln level. During Nb → N1 the value of p(ρ, N)
increases from Cw up to (Ns − N1)CW . Hence, the ﬁrst part
of change in const is given by
ln
p(ρ, N1)
p(ρ, Nb)

= ln
(Ns − N1)Cw
Cw

= ln(Ns − N1). (38)
The second part of the sum stands for increase p(ρ0, N1) →
p(ρ, N2), on ln level. During N1 → N2 the cost function
F2app decreases so much as its increases during Ns → N1.
The major term of ∆F2app during the transition Ns → N1 is
r(ρ0, N), which is linear with N, and its value changes from 0
to (Ns − N1)CW . Therefore, the increase of the cost function
F2app during Ns → N1 is overestimated as
F2app(N1) − F2app(Ns) ⪅ (Ns − N1)2CW
2
.
(39)
In the range N ≤ N1, the change of F2app is dominated
by p(ρ, N) due to its over-exponential character against the
linear character of r(ρ, N). Therefore, we model the change
of F2app during the transition N2 → N1 by p(ρ, N) ⪆ eχN
with χ equal to the derivative factor at N = N1, i.e., χ =

(42)
Due to the over-exponential character of p(ρ, N) the value
of N1 is close to N2 in general. We will use the estimation of
∆const to determine the value of ρs at which the boundary
curve (with const including also ∆const as additive term)
crosses the βlow line. Thus around that speciﬁc value of ρs
we have N2 ≈ L. Therefore, N1 can be approximated by L

where ∆N = Ns − L.

r(ρ, Ns) = 0, can be given from (27) as
Ns = A(M − L) +

Hence, ∆N can be expressed as

4) Relation for ρs: So far we discussed the way of solution
without considering the term u0(ρ) on the lhs of equation (28).
Now we take into account also the term u0(ρ). In this case
ln [p(ρ, 1)] ln [u0(ρ)] can be greater than ln(CW ) for β close
to 1, but Ns can be considered as approximate solution also
in this case, since the derivatives of r(ρ, N) and p(ρ, N)u0(ρ)
have different signs in that range. By including the term u0(ρ),
the relation for the boundary curve crossing the βlow line at

ρs ≤ 0.9 can be justiﬁed by the approximate solution of
(49) for ρs by assuming that its rhs ≤ 0.1M. Utilizing that
ρs is monotone increasing with respect to βlow (see (36)),
and setting max(βlow) = 0.5, according to (34) we get

3) ρ ≥ βlowξ with ξ = 1.2,

(52)
Note that the condition N − L ≫ 1 refers to Ns and hence
Nopt = L + 1 < L + 10 in the solution formula does not
violate this condition.
Observe that the approximate optimal N does not depend
on CA, CD and CR. This is because they have no impact on
N in the considered range of parameters. The cost parameters
CA, CD inﬂuence N only via p0 and hence they effect the
optimal N in the range, in which p0 depends on N. The cost
parameter CR has impact on the optimal N via η and hence
it is effective only for small values of K − M (see in (26)).
VII. APPROXIMATE MINIMIZATION - IN TRAFFIC RANGE
λ
Lµ < 1
For the N independent regions of p0 the function to be
minimized, (13), can be reduced to the minimization of (23)
like we did it for the trafﬁc range
λ
Lµ > 1. In order to further
simplify the optimization task, we establish an approximate
equation for determining the local minimum for (23). Of
course this approximation restricts the parameter range, for
which it holds.

A. Necessary approximations
In this subsection, we establish the approximations, which
are needed to establish the approximate equation for deter-
mining the local minimum. Again, we make use that under
the assumption N − L ≫ 1 the relation ( λ
Lµ)N−L ≪ 1 holds
for the trafﬁc range
λ
Lµ < 1 and thus the term ( λ
Lµ)N−L can
be neglected compared to 1.

are independent of N. Thus, using the expression based on
the second approximation form (17) for taking ∆N would
neglect the major term of ∆N

The ﬁgure shows a very good match. The mismatch on
the left side of the curve is caused by violating the condition
N − L >> 1, which was utilized by the approximations, as
N becomes close to L.

C. Constructing the approximate minimization
As we will see, the construction of the approximate mini-
mization is based on the existence of range of N, in which
the cost function is almost constant, and the properties of the
quadratic equation q(ρ, N) = 0.
1) Existence of almost constant cost ranges: The term
( λ
Lµ)N−L−1 decreases rapidly with increasing N in the range
of
λ
Lµ < 1. Hence, after enough large values of N, at the
latest when N − L − 1 reaches several tens, it supresses the
rhs of (62). Thus in that range ∆F2 ≈ 0 and therefore the cost
function is almost constant. The range of N, in which the cost
function is almost constant will be called as ”almost constant
cost range”.
In general the value of the factorial terms in (62) can vary
in a huge magnitude range. However p(ρ, N) =
( λ
µ )M
M!
(N−1)!
( λ
µ )N−1
is monotone increasing in the range of β > ρ (see (32), which
is the case due to β ≥ βlow
⇔
N − 1 ≥ L and 1 >
λ
Lµ ⇔ βlow > ρ, and thus p(ρ, N) ≤ p(ρ, M) = 1. Also the
term u1(ρ) is upper limited by u1(ρ) <
ρ
(1−ρ)2 <
0.5
(1−0.5)2 = 2
for ρ < βlow ≤ 0.5. It follows that the term
( λ
µ )M
M!
(N−1)!
( λ
µ )N−1 u1(ρ)
can not grow any large in the allowed trafﬁc range and hence
it will be also suppressed by term ( λ
Lµ)N−L−1 when N −L−1
reaches several tens depending on the value of ρ.
Figures 14 and 15 illustrate the existence of ”almost con-
stant cost range” for two typical form cost function curves.

Figure 14 and 15 were created by using the parameter set-
tings M = 100, L = 50, K = 150, µ = 1, CW = 50, Coff =
15, Con = 50, Ca = 30, Cd = 20, CR = 200, ρ = 0.3 and
M = 200, L = 100, K = 250, µ = 1, CW = 10, Coff =
0.01, Con = 0.02, Ca = 0.03, Cd = 0.02, CR = 200, ρ = 0.4,
respectively.
In the range of N−L−1 ≫ 1, e.g., N−L−1 > 10, the term
( λ
µ )M
M!
(N−1)!
( λ
µ )N−1 u1(ρ) falls in a very low magnitude range and
thus it can be neglected comparing to q(ρ, N). Hence, in that
range the maximum value of ∆F2 is determined by q(ρ, N).
Due to the parabolic character of q(ρ, N) the maximum of its
absolute value in the range of x = 0, . . . M − L − 1, denoted
by qul, is upper limited by the maximum of its absolute value
at x = 0, at x = M − L − 1 and at its local extremum, which
is at x =
b
2a due to ∂q(ρ,N)
∂x
= 0 ⇔ 2ax − b = 0. Therefore,
qul can be given by
qul =
(63)
max

| c |, | a(M − L − 1)2−b(M − L − 1) + c |, | c − b2
4a |

.
Let Nuccl stand for an upper limit on the lower boundary
of the ”almost constant cost range”. This upper limit is
determined by the equation
qul
 λ
Lµ
Nuccl−L−1
= ϵ,
where ϵ is the required precision, e.g., ϵ = 0.01. Solving the
above equation results in Nuccl as
Nuccl = ⌊
ln( ϵ
qul )
ln( λ
Lµ) + L + 1⌋ with ϵ < qul.
2) The concept of the approximate solution: The existence
of almost constant cost ranges implies that either there is a cost
minimum at Nopt below the lower boundary of the ”almost
constant cost range” or the cost at any N in the whole ”almost
constant cost range” can be considered as minimal.
The situation is determined by the properties of ∆NF2 in
the range of N below the lower boundary of the ”almost
constant cost range”. In the majority of that range the term
( λ
µ )M
M!
(N−1)!
( λ
µ )N−1 u1(ρ) can be neglected comparing to q(ρ, N) and
therefore the properties (sign and position of roots) of the
parabola q(ρ, N) determines the situation as follows:
Let xl and xh stand for the real roots of the quadratic
equation q(ρ, N) = 0 with xl < xh, if they exists. Similarly,
let Nl and Nh stand for the corresponding values in N, i.e.,
Nl = xl + L + 1 and Nh = xh + L + 1.The coefﬁcient
of x2 in the above quadratic equation is positive, since a is
positive due to
λ
Lµ < 1. Therefore, in the range x < xl and
x > xh the value of q(ρ, N) is positive. Similarly, in the range
xl < x < xh the value of q(ρ, N) is negative.
It follows from the above argumentation that the approxi-
mate solution can be constructed as follows.
1) The quadratic equation q(ρ, N) has two real roots and
xh ≥ 0 ⇔ Nh ≥ L + 1.
• If Nh < Nuccl then the cost function F2 has local
minimum at Nh,
• otherwise any N in the ”almost constant cost range”
is a local minimum.
Moreover if xl < 0 or xl ≥ 0, but it lies close enough to
0 then the above local minimum places are also global.
Otherwise it is also possible that the value of F2 at x = 0
is less then at the above local minimum places.
2) In any other case (two real roots and xh < 0, one real
root or no real root) q(ρ, N) > 0 and thus F2 is mono-
tone increasing in the range of x > 0 ⇔ N ≥ L + 1,
and hence it has global minimum at N = L + 1,
3) Condition for discriminant of the quadratic equation
to be positive: The coefﬁcients of the quadratic equation
q(ρ, N) = (ax2 − bx + c) = 0 can be rearranged as

quadratic equation q(ρ, N) = (ax2 −bx+c) = 0 are given by

b2 − 4ac
2a
.
Assuming D > 0 the quadratic equation has two roots. The
upper root xh can be nonnegative in two cases.
Case 1. The condition b < 0 holds.
In this case a second condition D ≥ b2 is also required to
have nonnegative upper root. It also ensures D ≥ 0.
Due to (1 −
λ
Lµ) > 0 the condition b < 0 yields
A(M − L) < 1
2.
The second condition is equivalent to 4ac ≤ 0, and due to
a > 0 leads to c ≤ 0, which results in the condition

Note that in this case the lower root is always negative and
hence the local minimum at Nh or in the ”almost constant
cost range” is also a global one.
Case 2. The condition b ≥ 0 holds.
In this case xh = b +
√
D > 0 holds always due to D > 0.
Thus no additional condition is necessary. The condition b ≥ 0
leads to
A(M − L) ≥ 1
2.
The conditions both for b ≥ 0 and D > 0 for this case can
be summarized as

5) The effect of the lower root on the global minimum:
Herein we investigate the magnitude of the lower root for the
case b ≥ 0 and D > 0. First, we provide a lower limit for D
by applying D > 0 in (66). If E < 0 then D = (b−1)2−E >
(b − 1)2. Otherwise E ≥ 0 and we can establish a lower limit
D = (b − 1)2 − E = (b − 1)2 − (

Hence, the lower limit for D > 0 can be summarized as

four cases comparing to the range of N, and thus the chance
of having lower cost at N = L+1 than the local minimum at
Nh or in the ”almost constant cost range” can be neglected. It
follows that the local minimum can be considered as a global
one.

arguments we get the approximate solution formula.

The approximate optimal N does not depend on CR also
in this trafﬁc range. The cost parameter CR has impact on the
optimal N via η and hence it is effective only for small values
of K − M.
VIII. NUMERICAL COMPARISONS
In this section, we illustrate the approximations and validate
the approximate solution formula by numeric optimization.

Lµ > 1
The setting Con = 50, Coff = 15 Ca = 30, Cd = 20
and CR = 20 was used for all experiments. The parameters
Ca, Cd and CR have no impact on the approximate solution
formula in the considered range of parameters.

Figure 17 shows the exact and approximate optimal value
of F1 in dependency of ρ for different values of M with the
parameter setting L = 50, K = M + 100, CW = 50, µ = 1
and ρ > 0.25 = L
M .
Both ﬁgures show a very good match.
C. Validation of the approximate formula
We validated the approximate solution formula by numeric
optimization in the considered range of parameters. Figure 18
shows the ratio of the approximated and the exact optimal
value of F1 for the range of parameters 100 ≤ M ≤ 700 and
ρ >
L

CW = 50, µ = 1.

Similarly, Figure 19 shows the ratio of the approximated

0.1 ≤ CW ≤ 100 and ρ > 0.25 =
L
M with the parameter
setting L = 50, M = 200, K = 300, µ = 1.
Both ﬁgures show a very good match until approaching the
ρ boundary L
M , where the condition 3, does not hold any more.
D. Low trafﬁc range -
λ
Lµ < 1
We used two basic parameter settings and their variations for
all experiments. One of them is M = 100, L = 50, K = M +
50, µ = 1, CW = 50, Coff = 15, Con = 50, Ca = 30, Cd =
20, which represents a typical cost function curve of Type 1.
The other one is M = 200, L = 100, K = M + 50, µ =
1, CW = 10, Coff = 0.01, Con = 0.02, Ca = 0.03, Cd =
0.02 and it belongs to cost function curves of Type 2. Although
the parameter CR was set to 200 in both cases, it has no impact
on the approximate solution formula in the considered range
of parameters due to condition 5.
E. Illustration of the approximate solution formula
First, we illustrate the approximate solution formula for
typical cost function curve of Type 2 (see Figure 15) under
the parameter setting M = 200, L = 100, K = M + 50, µ =
1, CW = 10, Coff = 0.01, Con = 0.02, Ca = 0.03, Cd =
0.02, CR = 200, while ρ is varied in the low trafﬁc range.
Figure 20 shows the approximate optimal N and the upper
limit on the lower boundary of the ”almost constant cost
range”, Nuccl, both as a function of ρ.

It can be seen on the ﬁgure that higher the ρ, higher the
upper limit on the lower boundary of the ”almost constant
cost range”. Additionally it can be also observed on the ﬁgure
that there exists a global optimum point above some ρ, for
cost function curves of Type 2, which is also expected from
the form of the cost curve.
Figure 21 shows the exact and approximate optimal N in
dependency of ρ, while keeping the above parameter setting
for the cost function curve of Type 2.

Figure 21. Exact and approximate optimal N in dependency

If the approximate optimal N equals to Nuccl then the whole
”almost constant cost range” is a range of optimal N-s, for
which the value of the cost function is approximately the
same, i.e., it changes only in a negligible magnitude. Note
that this range can fall also below Nuccl, since Nuccl is only
an upper limit on the lower boundary of the ”almost constant
cost range”. This explains the mismatch between the exact
optimal N and the approximate one, which is set simple to
Nuccl, in the trafﬁc range ⪅ 0.15. In fact the lower boundary
of the ”almost constant cost range” can be below its upper
limit, Nuccl, also for the values of ρ somewhat above 0.15,
which explains that the mismatch continues up to ≈ 0.21.

However this mismatch does not have any signiﬁcance,
since the value of the cost function is approximately the
same in the whole range of optimal N-s. It follows that the
approximate optimal N for the trafﬁc range ρ ⪅ 0.21 is
irrelevant and the exact and approximate optimal value of F1
show a good match, as it can be seen on the lowest curve (with
M = 200) in Figure 22. In the next trafﬁc range ρ > 0.21
the exact and approximate optimal N show a good match
until approaching ρ = 0.4. Above that point the condition 3.
does not hold any more, which causes a mismatch between
the exact and approximate values not only in optimal N but
also in optimal value. Therefore, we focus on the trafﬁc range
ρ ≤ L
M ψ with ψ = 0.8.
Figure 22 compares the exact and approximate optimal
value of the cost function in dependency of ρ for different
values of M with the above parameter setting and ρ ≤

The ﬁgure shows a good match for all three values of M.
Next we illustrate the approximate solution formula for
typical cost function curves of Type 1 (see Figure 14) under
the parameter setting M = 100, L = 50, K = M + 50, µ =
1, CW = 50, Coff = 15, Con = 50, Ca = 30, Cd = 20, CR =
200, while ρ is varied in the low trafﬁc range.

Figure 23 plots the approximate optimal N and Nuccl as a

optimal N-s for cost function curves of Type 1 with any value
of ρ, which is expected again from the form of the cost curve.
In this case the approximate optimal N is irrelevant since any
value in the range of optimal N-s can be considered as optimal
N. Therefore, we focus on the approximate optimal value.
The exact and approximate optimal value of the cost func-
tion in dependency of ρ are plotted on Figure 24 for different
values of Cw, with the above parameter setting and ρ ≤ L
M ψ.
The ﬁgure shows again a good match.

F. Validation of the approximate formula
We validated the approximate solution formula for the trafﬁc
range
λ
Lµ < 1 again by numeric optimization in the considered
range of parameters.
First, we validate it by the help of the parameter set for
cost function curve of Type 2, M = 200, L = 100, K =
M + 50, µ = 1, CW = 10, Coff = 0.01, Con = 0.02, Ca =
0.03, Cd = 0.02, CR = 200.
Figure 25 and 26 show the ratio of the approximated and
the exact optimal N and the ratio of the approximated and
the exact optimal value of F1, respectively, for the range of
parameters 200 ≤ M ≤ 800 and ρ ≤ L
M ψ.
Figure 25. Ratio of the approximated and exact optimal N for
200 ≤ M ≤ 800 and ρ ≤ L
M ψ.
It can be seen on Figure 25 that the approximated optimal
N deviates from its exact value by a factor 0.95−1.2 for low
values of ρ. This is due to the existence of range of optimal
N making the approximate optimal N irrelevant as explained
at Figure 21. For higher values of ρ (up to ρ ≤ L
M ψ) the exact
and approximated optimal N show a good match.
Figure 26. Ratio of the approximated and exact optimal value
(F1) for 200 ≤ M ≤ 800 and ρ ≤ L
M ψ.
The approximated and exact optimal value of F1 show a
very good match, as it can be seen on Figure 26.
Now we validate the approximate solution formula also by
the help of the parameter setting for cost function curve of
Type 1, M = 100, L = 50, K = M + 50, µ = 1, CW =
50, Coff = 15, Con = 50, Ca = 30, Cd = 20, CR = 200.
In this case the approximate optimal N is irrelevant for the
whole range of ρ due to the existence of a range of optimal
N-s and therefore we validate only the optimal value of the
cost function.
Figure 27 shows the ratio of the approximated and the exact
optimal value of F1 for the range of parameters 100 ≤ M ≤
700 and ρ ≤ L
M ψ.

The approximated and exact optimal value of the cost

also in Figure 26) can be observed in the parameter area
of approaching the trafﬁc boundary
L
M ψ, above which the
condition 3, does not hold any more.
Keeping the parameter setting for the cost function curve
of Type 1, Figure 28 shows the ratio of the approximated and
the exact optimal value of the cost function F1 for the range
of parameters 0.1 ≤ CW ≤ 100 and ρ ≤ L
M ψ.
Figure 28. Ratio of the approximated and exact optimal value

The ﬁgure shows a very good match of the approximated
and exact optimal values of cost function F1.
IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we continued our previous work [1]. We
extended the solution to the low trafﬁc range and generalized
the approximate solution formula for the high trafﬁc range
by omitting the condition on the cost parameters. Moreover,
we also provided the details of the stationary analysis and the
derivations both in the former and new optimization parts. The
ﬁrst contribution of this research is the proposal of the shifted
N-policy for a simple, but energy efﬁcient control of number of
active VMs in the IaaS Cloud. A secondary contribution is the
stationary analysis of the underlying queueing model. How-
ever, the major contributions are the approximate formulas
for computing the optimal threshold N, which minimizes the
cloud provider’s cost, in the most relevant parameter ranges.
The validation of the approximate solution formulas by means
of numeric optimization show good match. The closed form
approximate solution formulas enable a simple management
of the cloud and give an insight into the dependency of the
optimal threshold N on the model and cost parameters.
A future research work is to investigate the validity of the
solution formulas outside of the parameter ranges deﬁned by
the conditions of the solution formulas. A second potential
research topic is to establish an approximate solution also for
the trafﬁc range around λ
µ = L ⇔ ρ =
L
M . Further future
research topics are the optimization of L besides ﬁxed N and
the rather more difﬁcult joint optimization of parameters L
and N.

The k-th term of the sum has the form

thus it decreases with incresing k due to e

determine the value of k, as a function of q and A, at which
the k-th term equals to 1.

Around f1 ≈ 1 the magnitude of the sum PB

qk

qA
changes from ≪ 1 to ≫ 1 with increasing f1 (and q). This
can be taken into account by setting k ≫ 1, since in this case
the ﬁrst k terms are ≥ 1 implying PB
k=A+1
qk
k!
A!
qA > k ≫ 1.
In fact the k-th term will be even higher than 1 due to the
the overestimations of the terms with the form 1 + x by ex.
Therefore, setting a value lower than k ≫ 1 is enough to have
PB
k=A+1
qk
k!
A!
qA > k ≫ 1 and thus 2A ln(q/A) − 1 is a lower
limit for k. We count for k ≫ 1 by setting k = 10. This leads
to the upper limit of q as
10 > 2A ln(q/A) − 1 ⇔ ln(q/A) < 5.5
A
⇔ q < Ae

Note that with increasing B−A

A − 1 increases also the
overestimation of q by the above limit.
