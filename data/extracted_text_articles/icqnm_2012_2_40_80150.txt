Abstract—The 
mechanisms 
influencing 
the 
erythrocyte 
sedimentation and aggregation still remain unclear despite 
considerable research effort. In this study, we determined the 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) by measuring the 
electrical conductivity of blood in a miniature chamber with 
two planar electrodes on the bottom. As the red blood cells 
settle towards the bottom, the hematocrit (HCT) or 
erythrocyte volume fraction increases continuously with the 
time in the lower part of volume. The measured conductivity of 
blood in the chamber slightly increased during the first minute 
of observation and then decreased for more than 1.5 h. The 
dielectric theory was applied to determine the effective 
conductivity of blood. We have shown the increase of blood 
conductivity due to aggregation by both experimentally and 
theoretically. We have investigated the ESR at different HCT 
levels by using experimentally measured decreasing of blood 
conductance with time. A particle dynamic model (PDM) was 
developed 
to 
elucidate 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
microfluidic interaction of red blood cells (RBCs) and 
macroscopic ESR tests. We estimated the initial velocity and 
acceleration 
of 
erythrocytes 
and 
completion 
time 
of 
sedimentation.

INTRODUCTION 
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a simple and 
inexpensive laboratory test for assessing the inflammatory or 
acute 
response. 
The 
International 
Committee 
for 
Standardization in Hematology recommends the use of the 
Westergren method [1]. The duration of the Westergren test 
is one hour. The idea of shortened erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate evaluation (about 30, 20, 10 min or shorter) was 
discussed in several works [2-4]. However, the acceleration 
and automation of the ESR test encounters difficulties 
because the mechanisms influencing the erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate still remain unclear, despite considerable 
research efforts. A critical review of current models of the 
erythrocyte sedimentation is given in a recent work [5]. 
Several investigators have measured the time dependence 
of the blood conductivity. These studies based on the 
phenomenon that, as the red cells settle, hematocrit (HCT) 
decreases in the upper region of the blood column [5-9]. In 
the present work, we study the changes in blood conductivity 
during the aggregation and sedimentation in a small chamber 
with two planar electrodes on the bottom. The measured 
conductance of blood in the chamber increases slightly 
during the first minute of observation and then decreases 
longer than one hour. 
In this work, we try to find the relation between ESR and 
blood conductivity during the sedimentation. We consider 
the 
effective 
medium 
theory 
describing 
electrical 
conductivity of coated ellipsoidal particle suspensions. We 
compare our experimental data with theoretical prediction of 
blood conductivity. We develop a particle dynamic model 
(PDM) to elucidate the relationship between the microfluidic 
interaction of red blood cell (RBC) and macroscopic ESR 
test. We estimate the initial velocity and acceleration of 
erythrocyte and the time taken for sedimentation. 
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II 
describes material, methods, and measuring changes in the 
blood conductivity. The effective medium theory and its 
application to calculate the conductivity are given in Section 
III. The influence of RBC aggregation and sedimentation on 
the blood conductivity is also considered in this Section. The 
estimation of RBC sedimentation speed is given in Section 
IV. Section V offers the particle dynamic simulation of RBC 
aggregation and sedimentation. In addition, different ways of 
describing the aggregation of particles is discussed here. Our 
conclusions appear in Section VI.

CHANGES IN BLOOD CONDUCTIVITY DURING 
AGGREGATION AND SEDIMENTATION 
A. Measurement System 
The schematic drawing of fabricated device is shown in 
Fig. 1. The device is fabricated by conventional MEMS 
process. It is consists of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
chamber (5mm-wide and 5mm-deep) and two gold-paleted 
2D planar electrodes, each of width 300 m with gap 1200 
m apart. The 200 nm thick gold film was sputtered and then 
wet etched to the shape of electrodes. 
To record a data, an impedance analyzer (4294A, Agilent 
technologies) [10], and a data acquisition system (National 
Instruments, LabVIEW) [11] were used.

conductivity of blood 
B. Preparation of Blood Samples 
Venous blood samples were drawn from the antecubital 
vein of healthy volunteers and collected in vacutainers (6 ml, 
BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), which contained (K2) 
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the anti-
coagulant.  
In order to prepare the samples with different 
concentrations of fibrinogen, the whole blood was 
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and then the plasma and 
buffy-coat were removed. The erythrocytes were washed 
three times with an isotonic phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 
pH=7.4, 290mOsmol/kg) to eliminate fibrinogen on their 
surface. The erythrocytes, plasma, and PBS were then mixed 
in desired proportion. 
C. Time Dependence of Blood Conductivity 
We measured the conductivity  of whole blood samples, 
with HCT values of 35, 45, and 55%, respectively, over a 
period of 5000 s. The results are shown in Fig. 2. The initial 
change in conductivity is shown in the inset. 
 
Figure 2.  Changes in the conductivity of blood during sedimentation. 
The effective conductivity has a physical meaning only 
for a homogeneous suspension of mixed particles. During 
sedimentation, the conductivity of blood varies on height. 
However, we prefer to use a unit of conductivity, because at 
the initial time the conductivity corresponds to the 
conductivity of a homogeneous blood suspension and at the 
end of sedimentation it is very close to the conductivity of 
deposit. 
Fig. 2 shows that the conductivity of the blood in the 
chamber increased during the first minute of observation. 
The conductivity then decreased, and continued to do so for 
more than 1.5 h. The conductivity for the period during 
which it was increasing is shown in more detail in the inset 
to Fig. 2. 
We injected the erythrocyte suspension into the chamber 
using a pipette, and immediately began recording the 
conductivity. In our experiments, the conductivity remained 
constant during the first few seconds. We attribute this to the 
initial movement and mixing of the suspension after it had 
been injected into the chamber (prior to any aggregation). 
III. 
CONDUCTIVITY OF WHOLE BLOOD 
A. Effective Medium Theory of the Electrical Conductivity 
of Blood  
Erythrocytes make up ~ 99% of the total amount of cells 
in the blood plasma. Thus, the physical properties of red 
blood cells and plasma have a decisive influence on the 
aggregation, 
the 
sedimentation, 
and 
the 
electrical 
conductivity of blood. 
The human erythrocyte is a conducting biconcave discoid 
coated with a thin insulating membrane. We have based our 
method for calculating the effective conductivity of whole 
blood on effective medium theory. It seems accurate to 
assume that blood may be considered to be a mixture of 
randomly oriented spheroidal particles (Fig. 3) [12, 13]. 
 
Figure 3.  Model of coated spheroidal particles for red blood cells. 
We define the axes of the ellipsoids to be ax = ay, and az 
(aligned with the x, y, and z axes of the reference frame), in 
order to model spheroidal inclusions. 
The thickness  of the erythrocyte membrane is very 
small (Fig. 3). In this case /ax, /ay, /az << 1, and the 
volume ratio v of the inner ellipsoid to the outer ellipsoid is 
approximately given by 

v≈axayaz

The equivalent conductivity of the coated ellipsoid has 
three components px, py, and pz. Each component pk for 
the k- axis (k = x, y, z) is expressed as:

where f is the conductivity of plasma, p is the volume 
fraction of erythrocytes and  is the conductivity of blood. 
Equation (3) is similar to that proposed by Giordano et al. 
[16] if we use (2) for the principal conductivities. 
B. Comparison of Theoretical and Experimental Data 
Analyzing the published data, we selected the following 
average values of blood parameters: conductivity of the 
erythrocyte cell membrane m = 510-5 S/m and of the RBC 
cytoplasm cp = 0.5 S/m; radius of red cells RRBC = 4 m and 
thickness  = 2 m; membrane thickness  = 7.510-3 m. 
The conductivity of plasma at T = 24 and 37 C was 
assumed to be f = 1.2 and 1.57 S/m, respectively. All our 
experiments were performed at room temperature 24±1 C. 
Equation (3) predicts conductivities that closely match the 
experimental values of the disaggregated erythrocyte 
suspensions. 
A comparison of the blood resistivity for a range of HCT 
from published experimental data and our study (3) is given 
in Fig. 4. 
 
Figure 4.  Dependence of the blood resistivity on HCT. 
The red dotted line corresponds to Geddes and Kidder 
empirical formula [17]. The orange long-dashed line is 
Mohapatra and Hill data [18]. The green dashed-dotted line 
shows Sandberg et al. dependence [19]. The blue dotted line 
is Visser’s experimental data [20]. The violet solid line 
shows the results generated using (3). Our approximation 
demonstrates a good agreement with experimental data. 
C. Influence of RBC Aggregation on the Conductivity 
Erythrocytes can aggregate to form rouleaux. We use the 
term aggregation number to specify the number of ‘coins’ in 
an aggregate. Fig, 5A depicts an aggregate in which the 
aggregation number is 5 A disaggregated mixture has 
aggregation number 1. A good approximation for such pile 
would be a heterogeneous cylinder shown in Fig. 5B. The 
equivalent conductivity of the heterogeneous cylinder has 
three components px = py, and pz (see Fig. 5C). Applying 
(2) in limits when ax and ay tend to infinity and when az tends 
to infinity, we have px = py = 0.0253 S/m and pz = 
0.00658 S/m. Next, we use the model of prolate ellipsoids 
instead of cylinders (Fig. 5D). 
 
Figure 5.  Models for an erythrocyte aggregation in rouleaux (A)-(D) and 
increasing in blood conductivity with aggregation nubmer (E). 
Our calculation of changing in the whole blood 
conductivity with aggregation number is shown in Fig. 5E. 
The maximum increase in conductivity is approximately 
0.075 S/m at aggregation number 4 for all levels of HCT. In 
our experiment we observe the maximum increase of 0.02 
S/m (Fig. 2). We explain this deviation by the fact that in our 
experiment we have the mixture of RBCs with various 
aggregation numbers. 
D. Decreasing of Conductivity with RBC Sedimentation 
In our experiments, the conductivity approached a 
minimum of approximately 0.225 S/m at the end of 
sedimentation. Analyzing results calculated by (3) we can 
conclude that the HCT of deposit is H = 70%. We 
analytically approximated the change in conductivity with 
time using the following exponential dependence: 

 = A1exp(–B1t) + C1

where C1 = 0.225 S/m is the blood conductivity at H = 70%.

The coefficients A1 and B1 we obtained for different HCT

ESTIMATION OF SEDIMENTATION SPEED 
A. Model of Sedimentation 
In Fig. 6A we present a simple model of a column of 
blood during sedimentaion. The blood column has three 
separate zones: the up zone of pure plasma, the middle part 
of initial HCT, and the deposit of hematocrit H = 70% at the 
bottom of column. In reality, the boundaries between zones 
are slightly blurred. 
 
Figure 6.  Simple model of RBC sedimentation (A) and approximation of 
conductivity dependence on sedimentation of blood (B). 
We have shown that the blood conductivity only 
increases slightly during aggregation (see Fig. 3 and 5E). We 
can therefore assume that a constant electrical conductivity is 
maintained in the middle part of the blood column during 
deposition. The height of plasma zone, hp and the height of 
sediment, hs both increase, but the thickness of middle part, 
hb decreases over time (Fig. 6A). The total height of the 
blood column is h = hp + hb + hs. We determine the 
percentage 
of 
sedimentation 
as 
follows: 
S = (h - h0) / h100%. For speed of sedimentation we use a 
series expansion v = v0 + t, where v0 is the initial speed of 
sedimentation in %/s and  is the acceleration of 
sedimentation in %/s2. Acceleration takes place due to 
aggregation, which increases the mass of the falling particles. 
The time dependence of sedimentation is given by:

B. Settling Velocity 
For small Reynolds number, Re < 1, the drag force of 
spherical particle obeys to the Stokes’ law: 

FD = 6Rw

where  is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, R is the sphere 
radius, and w is the mean velocity of the sphere relative to 
the fluid. If the drag force equals to the gravity force and 
21

buoyancy force, then the resulting terminal velocity, wt is 
given by: 

wt = 2(p – f)R2g/9

where p and f are the densities of particle and fluid, 
respectively, g is the gravity acceleration. 
Equation (9) indicates that particles with a greater mass 
will have a higher velocity. The relaxation time of a 
spherical particle is given by: 

2(p – f)R2/9

A sphere of equivalent volume to a red cell has radius R 
= 2.78 m. We can estimate the terminal velocity of 
individual insulated erythrocyte as wt = 0.561 m/s = 2.02 
mm/h. The relaxation time of single erythrocyte is RBC = 
1.34 s. This relaxation time is very short, compared to the 
time taken for sedimentation. We therefore conclude that 
RBCs have a finite initial speed. 
A large number of experiments have demonstrated that a 
dense cloud of particles settling in a fluid has the terminal 
velocity lower than it is given by the Stokes’ law. It has been 
empirically found that the reduction in terminal velocity 
mainly depends on the volume fraction of the particles in the 
system. The semi-empirical Richardson-Zaki equation [21] is 
one of the most commonly used correction factors: 

ws = wt(1 – p)n

where ws is the settling velocity at a high volumetric 
concentration of particles, n is an empirically determined 
exponent. Richardson and Zaki showed that n is a function 
only of the Reynolds number (in the absence of the wall 
effects) [21]. The empirical value for the exponent n for low 
Reynolds number conditions (Re < 0.2) is n = 4.65, and this 
is the value that we use in our analysis. Calculated settling 
velocity of erythrocyte sedimentation at different HCT is as 
follows: ws(0%) = 0.415, ws(35%) = 0.0599 m/s, ws(45%) = 
0.0282, and ws(55%) = 0.0114 m/s. It agrees well with 
experimental data (see Table II).

PARTICLE DYNAMIC SIMULATION OF RBC 
AGGREGATION AND SEDIMENTATION 
A. Elastic and Aggregation Forces between RBCs 
Following Fenech et al. [22] we define the elastic and 
aggregation forces. The elastic force is given by: 

fe = (2R – dij)3/2, if dij < 2R and 0 otherwise 

where dij is the distance between the centers of RBCs i and j, 
 is the elastic modulus. 
The attractive/repulsive Morse potential is:

For calculation of the hydrodynamic interaction forces 
between particles we used a method based on Stokesian 
Dynamics approach [23-25]. We implemented the method 
[24] to calculate the lubrication forces in simulations of 
sedimenting particles. 
B. Simulation of Aggregation and Sedimentation 
Fig. 7 shows the snapshots of RBC motion at first five 
minutes of deposition at hematocrit H = 45%. Two 
dimensional aggregation and sedimentation was modeled by 
spheres of radius R = 2.78 m to match RBC volume. 
We applied periodical boundary conditions in the particle 
dynamic simulation to consider the middle part of settling 
particles. In Fig. 7, we show the calculation only with 81 
RBCs to make a clear image. The initial positions of RBCs 
were determined by random placing the spheres in a 
rectangular cell. 
C. Characterization of Settling Particles 
Many different ways were suggested for characterization 
of aggregation: AI, aggregation index; AR, aggregation 
radius; AAS, average aggregate size; SAF, small aggregate 
fraction; MAF, medium aggregate fraction; LAF, large 
aggregate fraction; VR, vacuum radius. 
In the left panel of Fig. 7, the number of RBC in 
aggregate is expressed by gradation of red. The right panel of 
Fig. 7 indicates the number of neighbours connected with the 
erythrocyte. The empty circle represents an individual 
erythrocyte. Yellow, orange, red, and reddish-brown circles 
indicate that cell is surrounded by 1, 2, 3, and 4 neighbours, 
respectively. Changes of VR are also given in Fig. 7. 
The increase in the average settling velocity at different 
HCT with time is shown in Fig. 8. One can see a good 
agreement between calculated and experimental data.

Figure 7.  Snapshots of sedimentation and aggregation. 
The change in velocity over time is largely dependent on 
the initial distribution of particles in the computational cell, 
but on average corresponds to uniformly accelerated motion. 
We believe that an important characteristic of the 
aggregation and sedimentation is the fraction of particles 
surrounded by different number of neighbours (Fig. 9). We 
assume that acceleration of settling velocity takes place due 
to aggregation, which increases the mass of the falling 
particles. 
By comparing Fig. 8 with Fig. 9, it clearly shows that the 
settling velocity and the number of aggregated particles are 
strongly related. 
Analysis of the simulation also shows that some particles 
sometimes rise up. We observed the formation and collapse 
of a RBC networks. The sedimentation rate demonstrates a 
complex stochastic behavior in time.

CONCLUSION 
We studied the changes in blood conductivity during 
aggregation and sedimentation in a miniature chamber with 
two planar electrodes on the bottom. The dielectric theory 
was applied to determine the conductivity of the whole 
blood. The erythrocytes were modeled as conducting oblate 
spheroid coated with a thin insulating membrane. The 
conductivity of erythrocyte rouleaux formations was 
described by prolate spheroids with different components of 
conductivity. The experimentally measured conductance of 
blood in the chamber slightly increases during the first 
minute of observation and then decreases for more than 1.5 
h. We attribute the slight increase in blood conductivity 
within the first minute to erythrocyte aggregation. Our 
theoretical calculations predict increase in conductivity with 
the number of erythrocytes aggregated. The calculation 
results are in good agreement with experiment. Further

decrease in electrical conductivity is caused by deposition of 
red cells at the bottom of chamber. We analytically 
approximated the change in the blood conductivity on time 
and dependence between conductivity and sedimentation. 
Using these approximations we estimated the initial velocity 
and acceleration of erythrocyte sedimentation. A particle 
dynamic 
model 
was 
developed 
to 
investigate 
the 
microfluidic RBC interaction. We estimated the initial 
velocity and acceleration of erythrocytes and completion 
time of sedimentation. As a result, the relation between the 
ESR and the blood conductivity was found. It is likely that 
our method could also be applied to accelerated ESR tests.
