Abstract- Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable
cause of mortality. Smokers who quit smoking reduce
their risk of developing and dying from tobacco-related
diseases. Smoking cessation outpatient clinics play an
important
role
for
cessation
of
smoking.
Health
information systems such as Electronic Health Records
(EHRs), computerized decision support systems, and
electronic prescribing are increasingly identified as
potentially valuable components to improve the quality
and efficiency of patient care. The paper-based methods
which are used in Smoking Cessation Outpatient Clinics
(SCOCs) are time and resource expensive and unlikely
to be performed consistently. EHRs provide a systematic
mechanism to improve patient care. In this study, a Web
based software is developed for use of primary health
care physicians and other health workers to implement
smoking cessation for addicts. The system which was
developed will be used for recording therapy, following
up with the patient and evaluating the quitting process
of smokers. Electronic health records computerized
decision
support
systems
are
potentially
valuable
components to improve the quality and efficiency of
clinical interventions for tobacco use. This software is
developed
with
Microsoft
Visual
Studio
2015
C#
programming language as a Web application.

INTRODUCTION
It is a known fact that both active and passive smoking
are
damaging
to
human
health
and
have
associated
economic costs. Cigarette smoking is the cause of many
preventable
diseases, leads
to
premature
deaths,
and
accounts for a significant proportion of many health
inequalities. The World Health Organization currently
estimates that each year smoking accounts for about ~6
million deaths worldwide and causes about half a trillion
dollars in economic damage annually [2]. This number of
smoking-attributable deaths is expected to rise to 7 million
by 2020 and to more than 8 million a year by 2030 if the
current rate of smoking continues unabated [3].
Health information systems such as Electronic Health
Records [1], computerized decision support systems, and
electronic
prescribing
are
increasingly
identified
as
potentially valuable components to improve the quality and
efficiency of patient care. EHRs are also very likely to
disseminate rapidly, at least in developed countries, as
healthcare systems modernize away from paper records [4].
In this study, a Web based software is developed for use
of primary health care physicians and other health workers to
implement smoking cessation for addicts. The idea is to
combine the power of the Web based environment with
primary health care specialists. With these approaches,
dependent patients will not only use a computer program,
they will also communicate with their physicians for several
problems in a easy to use environment. Currently, there is no
computer application used by physicians for managing
patients in Smoking Cessation Outpatient Clinics. For that
reason, it is impossible to retrieve patient’s records online
since
the
information
is
currently
stored
in
paper
environment. On the other hand, to analyze patient records is
very difficult and having reports about several patients is
almost impossible.
Our software is developed with intensive aids of primary
care physicians. During the development phase, first of all,
the Smoking Cessation process is observed for several

physicians,

are
developed for modelling processes. Finally, the beta version
of the software is completed for test usage.

BACKGROUND
In 2012, an estimated 31.1% of men and 6.2% of
women worldwide were daily smokers [5]. Although daily
smoking has been reduced among men and women,
population growth has led to a significant increase in the
number of smokers around the world [5]. Tobacco use
currently kills more than five million people each year and
this number is expected to increase substantially [6]. Even if
prevalence rates remain unchanged, an estimated 500
million people will die as a direct result of tobacco usage
over the next fifty years [7]. The healthcare setting remains
an underused venue to provide cessation assistance to
tobacco users, particularly in developing countries.
Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for tobacco
cessation support recommend systematic identification and
intervention for tobacco use. Changes in health systems
operations that institutionalize the identification and clinical
treatment of patients using tobacco are a particularly
promising way to take advantage of the primary care visit to
help patients quit tobacco use [8]. A system level change
that might increase the frequency of effective cessation
delivery is to take advantage of the electronic medical
record for clinician reminders, linking patients to cessation
services, monitoring performance, and providing feedback.
Treatment for tobacco use in a healthcare setting first
requires
an
assessment
of
tobacco
use
and
patient
willingness to stop using tobacco [9]. Healthcare clinician
advice has a small effect on cessation - leading to
approximately three to six per cent of patients stopping
using tobacco [10]. However, higher rates of cessation are
achieved when a coordinated system within the healthcare
setting facilitates evidence-based actions such as cessation
counselling and use of cessation medications [8]. In the
absence of electronic records, a stamp or similar visual aid
in a paper chart can serve as a clinician reminder to discuss
tobacco use, to provide treatment, and to facilitate referrals.
Chart audits by hand can also provide performance measure
information needed for quality improvement. However,
these paper-based methods are time and resource expensive
and unlikely to be performed consistently. EHRs provide a
systematic mechanism to improve the fidelity of following
clinical practice guidelines consistently [11].
In many countries, a large investment is being made in
technology to computerize patient medical records. One
potential of electronic health records is that they could be
used to remind doctors and other clinic staff to record
tobacco use, to give brief advice to quit, to prescribe
medications and to refer to stop smoking counselling. They
could also help refer people to these services and be used to
measure how well a clinic was doing. EHRs could also help
make the delivery of tobacco use treatments standard
practice by providing electronic referrals for additional
treatment services (e.g., referral to a telephone tobacco quit
line). Specifically, documentation of tobacco uses and
referral
to
cessation
counselling
appear
to
increase
following EHR changes [3].
Edward G. Feil et al. developed a cessation Web site and
examined recruitment approaches on a short time evolution.
They proposed a therapy from Internet and observed the
results were encouraging however, outcomes were assessed
only by self-report for that reason. They cannot conclude that
quitting smoking was a function of their Web site [12].
Victor J. Strecher et al. proposed smoking-cessation
interventions should be generalized to other cessation
interventions. They demonstrated the importance of tailoring
for smoking cessation program. They also used a novel
fractional factorial design for examining the aims of their
study. The aims of the study identifying active psychosocial
and communications elements of a web-based smoking-
cessation intervention and testing the impact of tailoring
depth on smoking cessation [13].
The
World
Health
Organization proposed
specific
obligations concerning smoking dependence and cessation.
The obligations are listed below, as follows:
a) Designing effective smoking cessation program in
locations such as educational institutions, health care
centers, workplaces and sporting environments.
b) Including
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
smoking
cessation
programs
in
national
health
and
education
programs.
c) Establishing programs for diagnosing and treating
smoking
cessation
in
health
care
facibilities
and
rehabilitation centres.
d) Collabrating
with
other
parties
such
as
pharmaceutical products (14).
Freedom from Smoking Online software is a Web
based software for adult smokers. This software is for users
who have regular access to a computer and are comfortable
with others through online environment [15].
Stop
Smoking
Center
is
a
Web
based
software
developed in 2000. The software is still enhancing through
methodologies from their clinical advisers, technology
experts and other program members [16].

Methods of Our Software
Figure 1.
All Steps of our software
Figure 1. shows all steps of Smoking Cessation Process
in SCOC. In the first case, the patient visits the outpatient
clinic for first time. Patients records are stored the system
for future use. In the second case, the patient comes with
laboratory and other results. The physician gives related
materials and/or therapy. In the last case, after a period of
time, the physician checks the patient’s current status and
physician should request a new laboratory examination if
necessary.
•
Users of our Software
There are two types of users: Physicians and Clinic
Secretary. To start, the patients first records are
entered into the system by the secretary. If the
patient comes again, it will not be necessary to enter
the same information into the system. The secretary
will only find the related records of the patient
before
treatment.
Finally,
the
physicians
will
continue the treatment using related Web pages.
Figure 2. shows the data entry page of the software.

Functions of our Software
There are three types of physicians: Treatment
Specialist
Doctor,
Physician
Assistant
and
Physician Instructor. In our software, three different
parts exist for each of them. In addition, three types
of patient’s visits exist: for first time patients our
software
has
a
section
for
having
personal
information and background data collected, as
shown in Figure 3. For patients with laboratory
examination
results,
there
is
another
section.
Finally, for follow up patients, there is another page
to record current situations.

First time patient record page.
•
Query and Reports of our Software
There
are
two
ways
for
accessing
stored
information. In the first case, using patient’s ID, it
is possible to have all the information of the related
patient. In the second case, it is possible to have
patient’s information summary by selecting the
date, as shown in Figure 4. In the second case, it is
also possible to select one patient for accessing
detailed information.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Because smoking is one of the most important health
issues in the world, smoking cessation treatments are
intensively studied areas in medicine. Electronic health
records are considered for every aspect of health, such as
patient registration, patient follow up, etc. A smoking health
record system that can be used in SCOC will influence the
treatments success. Firstly, the application is programmed as
a recording system and allows easy usage for the physicians.
Secondly, clinical decisions can be used in accordance with
clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients is the first
step in the creation of support systems. Additionally,
collected patient data will consist of data banks and will
allow the emergence of new therapies and new approaches to
smoking cessation.
As a future work, collected patient records will be
analyzed by machine learning techniques for implementing a
Decision Support System. With this system, common
characteristics of smokers will be discovered and also
treatment methods should be customized for related patient
clusters.
