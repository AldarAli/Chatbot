Abstract—We developed a respiration-posture feedback system 
to control breathing involuntarily. In this system, a rubber air 
chamber placed under a subject’s back inflates or deflates to 
adjust a subject’s chest position slightly. By adequately 
regulating the movement of this air chamber in synchrony with 
actual respiration, respiration was successfully lengthened and 
deepened, just like voluntary deep breathing. Moreover, the 
analysis of the heart rate signal indicated that the 
parasympathetic nervous system, which is a prominent 
nervous system in the body, was also activated. This 
respiration-posture feedback system can be used for an at-
home adaptive health care interface as part of an ambient 
system.

 INTRODUCTION 
Across generations and continents, breathing control has 
been introduced as one of the easiest and most effective 
approaches toward controlling the mental and somatic states. 
The unique breathing styles are developed when doing 
activities such as yoga, martial arts, marathon running, and 
even religious meditation. There is increasing scientific 
evidence in the field of biofeedback showing that breathing 
control affects behaviour, mental state, physiology, etc., such 
as the performance of tasks [1], quality of sleep, anxiety [2-
5], heat rate [6-8], blood pressure [5, 9] and even immune 
functioning [10-12]. 
Moreover, the numerous medical observational and 
clinical studies have revealed that adequate breathing control 
of patients who experience a breathing-related disorder, such 
as obstacle sleep apnoea (OSA) or central sleep apnoea 
(CSA), which are prominent risk factors of cardiovascular 
disease [13], can significantly reduce this risk [14, 15]. Thus, 
developing a breathing control method is quite beneficial for 
maintaining health clinically and in daily life. 
The wide-ranging physiological effects of breathing 
control are mediated by vagus nerve (parasympathetic 
nervous system) activation [16]. The vagus nerve, the most 
important nervous system in the body, is a single 
transduction pathway of the nerve signals that convey 
physiological information to the brain stem. Respiration is 
regulated via the parasympathetic nervous system as follows: 
(1) respiration induces changes in the pressure in the lung 
and pH in the blood, (2) these physiological changes are 
detected 
by 
mechanoreceptors 
and 
chemoreceptors, 
respectively, and then (3) the signal from each receptor is 
conveyed to the respiratory centre at the brain stem via the 
(afferent) parasympathetic nervous system (Fig. 1). Because 
nerves innervating the body and brain interconnect at the 
brain stem, respiration may be able to regulate the entire 
body and even mind. In other words, voluntary control of 
respiration could affect the entire body and the mind. 
The challenge of this study is to develop a system to 
involuntarily (or unconsciously) control respiration. The 
voluntary control of respiration, e.g., biofeedback training, 
sometimes requires substantial effort and concentration.

Moreover, the mechanical respiration control systems that 
physically provide airflow to patients in the clinic, such as 
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Adaptive 
Servo-Ventilation (ASV), require patients to be fitted with a 
nasal cannula or respirator. Although CPAP and ASV can be 
the most effective treatments for patients with OSA and CSA 
[14, 15], they are not suitable for daily, at-home use. 
We, thus, propose a respiration-posture feedback system 
as a novel and easy-to-use home health care system. With 
this system, we hypothesized that regulation of the user’s 
posture stimulates mechanoreceptors, which then induces 
vagus nerve activation, unconsciously. 
In the following sections, we describe the schema of our 
respiration-posture feedback system, present the experiment 
to verify the feasibility of this system and its results, and 
conclude by discussing the results and limitations of the 
study. 
II. 
METHOD 
A. Respiration-posture Feedback System 
We developed a respiration-posture feedback system to 
control subject’s respiration. This system comprises a 
respiration sensor unit, a posture regulation unit, and an 
interface, as shown in Fig. 2. The respiration sensor unit uses 
a force-sensing device (FSR400, Interlink Electronics, Inc., 
USA, [17]) and an electric signal amplifier to convert the 
movement of the subject’s chest that accompanies respiration 
into an electric signal. The interface (NI USB-6008 DAQ, 
National Instruments Co., USA, [18]) converts the analogue 
signal derived by the respiration sensor unit into a digital 
signal (12-bit resolution, 1000-Hz sampling rate). Using our 
algorithm 
(described 
later), 
the 
digital 
respiration 
information can be used for the posture regulation unit. 
Posture is regulated by a rubber air chamber (Fig. 3a) placed 
under the subject’s back and is inflated and deflated by a pair 
of air pumps (Fig. 3b) (YP-20A, Yasunaga Air Pump Inc., 
Japan, [19]). 
B. Regulation of Respiration-posture Feedback System 
The challenge of this feedback system is to lengthen and 
deepen a subject’s breathing. To achieve this goal, we 
introduced posture regulation because physical movement 
accompanies respiration, and posture, to some extent, affects 
respiration. We then designed an algorithm in which the 
inflation and deflation of the air chamber is appropriately 
regulated as follows: (1) the air chamber is inflated when the 
subject’s respiration is about to reach its peak of inspiration 
to extend slightly the inspiration time, and on the other hand,

and (2) the chamber is deflated gradually to slow the 
subject’s expiration. It is not necessary for human respiration 
to be a regular cycle, so this regulation is implemented as a 
real-time feedback system. The system continuously 
monitors the subject’s respiration via the respiration sensor 
unit. The signal is differentiated to determine the change in 
breathing speed during inspiration and overall respiration. By 
comparing this breathing speed signal with the subject’s 
normal breathing speed profile that is recorded in advance, 
the system predicts the timing of peak inspiration and 
respiration during the relevant respiration cycle. The air 
chamber is inflated or deflated to shift this predicted 
respiration peak later. 
Typical respiration and air pump regulation profiles are 
shown in Fig. 4. It should be noted that the airflow to the 
rubber chamber via the pump has a certain time delay, so the 
On/Off signal of the pump does not imply the time of 
inflation and deflation. Moreover, the inflation of the rubber 
chamber is limited to avoid placing too much pressure on the 
subject’s back. 
The regulation algorithm described here was developed 
using a visual programming language (LabVIEW, National 
Instruments Co., USA, [18]). We then conducted an 
experiment to confirm the effectiveness of the feedback 
system. 
C. Experiment 
Four male undergraduate students (age, 20–22 years) 
voluntarily participated in the experiment. After electrodes 
for obtaining the electrocardiogram (ECG, the heart beat 
signal) and the respiratory sensor unit were attached, the 
subjects were instructed to lie on a bed with the posture 
regulation unit (the rubber air chamber) placed under their 
back. As shown in Fig. 5, the experiment consists of a 5-min 
initialization period, followed by the regulation period, and 
then a 5-min recovery period (15 min in total). The 
respiration-posture regulation algorithm functioned only 
during the target period. There was no regulation at all 
during the initialization and recovery periods. 
Subjects were instructed to stay calm and relax on the 
bed for the entire 15-min period, and were informed that the 
air chamber would be inflated and deflated during the middle 
of the experimental period. However, they were not told in 
advance how the chamber was regulated. 
The experiment was conducted in the afternoon in an 
environmentally controlled room. 
III. 
RESULTS 
Fig. 6a and 6b shows the results of the peak-to-peak 
interval and the amplitude of the respiration, respectively. It 
should be noted that the amplitude in Fig. 6b is shown in the 
form of an electric potential observed by the sensor unit of 
our system; it proportionally increases as the chest 
circumference increases. As these figures show, the peak-to-
peak interval and the amplitude of the subjects’ breathing 
lengthened and increased in magnitude, respectively, during 
the target period compared with initialization and recovery 
periods. This indicates that the subjects’ respiration was 
slowed and deepened using our system, as we expected. 
Fig. 7a shows the results of the heart rate. The heart rate 
declined during the period of regulated respiration compared 
with the initialization and recovery periods. The frequency 
component analysis of the heart rate variability (HRV) was 
also performed. Fig. 7b shows the results of the high-
frequency component. The high-frequency component 
(range, 0.15–0.40 Hz) of the variation in the peak-to-peak 
interval of the heart beat in a time series, called the HRV, 
represents the activation of the heart-related parasympathetic 
nervous system [20, 21]. The vagus nerve works to slow the 
heart beat and increase the variation in heart beat intervals, 
called respiratory arrhythmia. Therefore, these heart beat 
profiles imply the increment of vagus nerve activity during 
respiration regulated by our respiration-posture feedback 
system. 
Fig. 8 shows the ratios of the test period over the 
initialization and recovery periods. Although a decline in the 
heart rate was not observed for all subjects, a significant 
change in the respiration and the vagus nerve activation was 
observed. 
With regard to subjective scoring, no subject reported 
any discomfort with the air chamber placed under his back.

The subjects were not aware of the feedback regulation of 
the system. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The aim of this study was to test the plausibility of our 
respiration-posture feedback system for controlling a 
subject’s respiration, and, in turn, the accompanying vagus 
nerve activation. By regulating the inflation and deflation of 
the rubber air chamber in relation to inspiration and 
expiration peak timing, the subject’s breathing was 
lengthened and deepened, as we expected. Moreover, the 
heat rate and its variability profile indicated that the 
parasympathetic 
nervous 
system 
was 
activated 
simultaneously. Therefore, it is suggested that respiration-
posture feedback regulation could affect not only breathing 
but also human parasympathetic nervous system activity. 
The parasympathetic nervous system is a prominent 
system of afferent nerves in the body, and conveys and 
aggregates the internal states of the entire body to the brain 
stem. Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) technology, for 
example, employs this afferent property to stimulate the 
brain of a patient with symptoms of epilepsy. This is 
accomplished, not by stimulating the brain itself, but by 
stimulating the patient’s vagus nerve using an electrical 
device implemented in the neck [22, 23]. However, it has 
been reported that VNS could have a side effect of the 
symptoms of apnoea syndrome, a pathological respiration 
disturbance [24]. This comes from the wide and complex 
network of the parasympathetic nervous system in the body, 
and it represents the risk of direct electrical stimulation. In 
contrast, our system controls the respiration, which is also 
closely related to parasympathetic nervous system activation, 
and thus stimulates the vagus nerve indirectly. Therefore, our 
system might stimulate the brain stem indirectly via 
parasympathetic nervous system activation. To verify this 
theory, further study is needed on a variety of physiological 
functions. For example, in the endocrine system, secretion of 
stress-related hormones [25, 26] using respiratory control is 
envisioned. 
Implementing our respiratory control system as an 
ambient system for promoting daily health care at home 
would have an advantage compared with yoga, meditation, 
or conventional biofeedback training introducing breathing 
control. Respiration is controlled both voluntarily and

involuntarily. Individuals use these relaxation activities to 
control their breathing by voluntary ventilation, so it requires 
a sufficient effort and higher concentration to maintain ideal 
breathing. In contrast, our system targets controlling 
involuntary ventilation by respiration-posture feedback 
regulation, which should stimulate mechanoreceptors in the 
body that sense the change in the air pressure and induce a 
variety of reflex responses needed to maintain respiration 
involuntarily. The user would achieve breathing control with 
less conscious effort, and for a longer time. 
A recent population-based sleep study reported that 
approximately 20% of business men at a company had at 
least one symptom of severe or moderate OSA, and that the 
severity of OSA is related to metabolic syndrome [27]. A 
direct airflow apparatus such as CPAP or ASV is not 
practical for installation in a large number of patients’ and/or 
pre-patients’ homes. In contrast, because our system is a 
real-time feedback system that monitors the subject’s 
respiration continuously, it could easily detect OSA and 
adequately inflate or deflate the air chamber to change 
posture and stimulate recovery from apnoea. Therefore, by 
developing our system, it could contribute to the field of 
public health and preventive medicine at both the clinic and 
at home. 
The limitations of our study are the small number of 
subjects, the use of the same air chamber and its regulation 
algorithm for subjects with different physical attributes, and 
the use of a wired respiration sensor. These limitations 
should be improved in future studies. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Our respiration-posture feedback system successfully 
lengthened and deepened subjects’ respiration, which 
implied vagus nerve activation. 
The number of health care devices used at home is 
increasing, many of which can be interconnected via a 
wireless network [28]. Thus, the integration of biomedical 
engineering and information and communication technology 
for home health care would be an important and future 
direction for an ambient system, of which our system could 
be a part.
