Abstract—The paper describes the study in which end users’ 
trust and feeling of security in regard to cloud services are 
examined. Trust and security are one of the key issues within 
cloud where people use a shared pool of computing resources 
for the storage of their data and thus do not have control over 
the management of their own data content. An online survey 
was conducted in three countries (Finland, USA and Japan) 
with more than 3000 respondents. The twelve cloud trust 
creators that were identified by cloud software experts in our 
earlier study were picked, and asked the end users to rank how 
important those factors are for them when deciding if it is 
secure to use a service in the cloud. The results show that ease 
of use has the biggest effect on the secure feeling towards cloud 
services, followed by the language and the price of the service. 
Some differences were visible between the countries. These as 
well as the differences for the results between genders, age 
groups and expertise levels of the respondents are presented in 
this paper.

 INTRODUCTION 
Within the cloud, software, infrastructure and platforms 
are offered as a service. [1] In cloud services, content (for 
example, music, email, files), personal information and 
programs are stored on Internet servers instead of the user’s 
own computer. [2] The cloud services and the content in 
them are accessible from various devices anytime and 
anywhere through the Internet. 
The cloud environment relies heavily to the notion of 
trust. People often find it harder to trust on-line services than 
off-line services. [3] Cloud computing introduces a whole 
ecosystem of clients, services and infrastructure, where trust 
boundaries are moved into realms where physical locations 
and even ownerships are unknown. [4] Establishing, 
expressing and maintaining trust by technological methods 
has always been challenging. The traditional question on 
where are the limits to presenting, simplifying and 
visualising security without losing trust or creditability, 
receive a new life within the cloud environment. [5] 
Since there are no deterministic means of revealing the 
factors affecting the human perception of security or trust on 
cloud environment, security experts and user experience 
experts who have some familiarity with clouds were first 
interviewed. Their views on the role of trust in cloud services 
were then analysed. After that, the results of these 33 
interviews [5] were verified by conducting an online survey 
with end users. Our objective for this study was to 
investigate what aspects and to what extent contribute and 
affect to the secure feeling in the cloud. 
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 
2, the background literature in relation to cloud services as 
well as trust is discussed. Section 3 describes the research 
methodology used in this study. Section 4 presents study 
results which are then further discussed in Section 5. Section 
6 summarizes the study results. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
In this section, a brief background to two main subjects 
of the study – cloud services and trust – is presented. 
A. Cloud Services 
Cloud services and cloud computing are today’s reality; 
typical web users use cloud services daily whether they 
know it or not. [2] The cloud concept is still changing but 
several early definitions for cloud computing and cloud 
services exist.  
Weiss [6] states that cloud computing  is a paradigm 
where software functionality, hardware computing power, 
and other computing resources are delivered in the form of 
service so that they become available widely to consumers. 
In [7], the following definition is constructed: Clouds are a 
large pool of easily usable and accessible virtualized 
resources (such as hardware, development platforms and/or 
services). These resources can be dynamically re-configured 
to adjust to a variable load (scale), allowing also for an 
optimum resource utilization. Breiter and Behrendt [8] take 
the user point of view to cloud services: “The emerging style 
of cloud computing provides applications, data, and 
information technology resources as services of a network. 
The cloud services approach focuses on a positive user 
experience while shielding the user from the complexity of 
the underlying technology.“ In [9], it is continued that 
services such as free email services, Internet portal services, 
web hosting services, computing infrastructure services, etc. 
are all cloud services. NIST [10] defines cloud services from 
the consumers’ perspective as follows: “The capability 
provided to the consumer to use the provider’s applications 
running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are 
accessible from various client devices through a thin client 
interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email). The 
consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud 
infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems,

storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the 
possible exception of limited user-specific application 
configuration settings.”  
The main message for the cloud users based on various 
cloud definitions seems to be that, in the cloud, the end users 
do not need to worry about the underlying technology and 
infrastructure details but just rely on the cloud services as a 
huge storage area of their data, resources and software. This 
relying is calling for trust. 
B. Trust and Secure Feeling 
Although a concise and universally accepted definition of 
trust has remained elusive [11][12], most definitions include 
an aspect of perceived risk of vulnerability, and also an 
element of psychological security.  
Trust can be said to be a belief, attitude, or expectation 
concerning the likelihood that the actions or outcomes of 
another individual, group or organization will be acceptable 
or will serve the actors interests. [13] 
In [14], it is said that trust is letting other persons (natural 
or artificial, such as firms, nations, etc.) take care of 
something the trustor cares about, where such ’caring for’ 
involves some exercise of discretionary powers. 
Fogg and Tseng [15] define trust as an indicator of a 
positive 
belief 
about 
the 
perceived 
reliability 
of, 
dependability of, and user confidence in himself being able 
to control the technology. 
Trust assessment on 
the cloud environment is 
complicated by the fact that in the digital world one is faced 
with the absence of physical cues and the establishment of 
suitable centralized authorities 
such as 
certification 
authorities is still evolving and not always applicable. [16] 
In [17], it is summarised that trust becomes increasingly 
important as mobile services get more and more involved in 
the personal life of people and as these services increasingly 
collect, analyse and store personal data. This is just as well 
true with not only mobile but all cloud based services. 
Building trust in the cloud is not a straightforward task 
and there are a lot of issues to be solved before a user can 
truly feel safe towards services in the cloud. 
III. 
RESEARCH METHOD 
As the target of the study was to examine the feelings of 
cloud service end users, and as the cloud is a worldwide 
concept, a broad and representative sample of end users in 
several countries was needed. Hence, a quantitative research 
approach was chosen. A web-based survey was used to 
conduct the quantitative 
study. 
According 
to 
[18] 
quantitative 
data 
enable 
standardized 
and objective 
comparisons and the measurement of quantitative research 
permits overall descriptions of situations or phenomenon in a 
systematic and comparable way. There are several 
advantages of web-based surveys. As stated in [19], in a 
web-based survey the speed of recruitment is very fast and 
travel cost and time are eliminated. [19] This was important 
as an international study with respondents in several different 
countries was meant to be conducted. 
A web-based survey was seen as an appropriate way to 
go deeper from the interview results gotten earlier. [5] It 
must be noted that the survey consisted of several other 
dimensions beside the trust and security issues; e.g., our 
results of today’s usage of cloud services based on the survey 
are already published in [2]. 
A. Data Sources and Collection 
The survey design process adopted from [19] and [20] 
was followed. When designing the sampling for the survey 
the sampling design process adopted from [20] was used.  
The survey was decided to be conducted in three 
different countries: Finland, Japan and USA. Decision of 
choosing these three countries was due to the fact that each 
of them had acted as a pacesetter in many ICT fields, e.g., in 
mobile technology and services usage.  As these countries 
have been in the forefront of technology use and acceptance 
in the consumer sector, they present fruitful contexts for 
analyzing consumers’ use of and perceptions towards new 
technologies such as cloud services. Furthermore, all of these 
three countries are so dissimilar with each other concerning 
the location and the cultural background that it was thought 
to be interesting to find out possible differences when 
comparing the results of these countries. 
The original survey was made in English; the Finnish and 
Japanese versions were translated by experts. The 
questionnaires for each of the three countries were identical 
except for the background question about the annual income 
of the respondents where the currency was localised for each 
country. Each of the three language versions was then 
created to be an individual online survey by one market 
research company in each of the countries who also took 
care of finding the respondents matching the pre-defined 
criteria from their customer registers and closing the polls 
after the desired sample size was acquired. 
The sample size was decided to be approximately one 
thousand respondents from each country. This size is typical 
for surveys that are nationwide, regardless of the size of the 
country. Thus, the overall sample size was ca 3000 
responses. The survey was generated and data gathered with 
Digium Enterprise data collection service. A total of 3187 
responses, all of them acceptable, was received between the 
time period of 10 June and 21 June 2010. There were 1005 
respondents from Finland, 1089 from USA and 1093 from 
Japan. 
The criterion for selecting the survey respondents was to 
get a representative sample from each country based on the 
demographics of the countries. The gender, age and self 
evaluated cloud service expertise distribution of respondents 
from different countries can be seen in Table 1. Furthermore, 
the demographic information of the gender and age of the 
population for each country is shown in brackets (for more 
information see [21][22][23]).  
B. Data Analysis Method 
The quantitative analysis of the survey was made using 
SPSS Statistics 17.0 computer software. At the first stage of 
the analysis frequency distributions and other descriptive 
statistics were obtained. Also several cross tabulations, t-
tests and analysis of variances (ANOVA) were made to 
compare the samples.

IV. 
SECURE FEELING IN THE CLOUD 
Our research question regarding trust and secure feeling 
in the cloud was about the factors that could contribute and 
affect to the user’s secure feeling in the cloud. The question 
was phrased in the following way:  
How important are the following factors when deciding if 
it is secure to use a specific cloud service (for example, 
webmail or music library)? 
A 7 step Likert scale, where 1=Not important at all, and 
7=Extremely important, was used. Also a Not applicable 
option was given. The cloud trust affect factors found in our 
earlier interview [5] were used as a basis for the options 
which the respondents was asked to value.  These 12 affect 
factors were: 
x 
Own experiences 
x 
Friends’ recommendation 
x 
Brand reputation, image and name 
x 
Background and home country of the company 
x 
A critical mass of users 
x 
Search engine results 
x 
User license agreements 
x 
Price  
x 
Ease of use 
x 
Visual image of the service web page 
x 
Transparency  
x 
Language 
A. Overall Results 
According to the survey, the factors having an effect on 
the overall users’ experience about the secure usage of cloud 
services are ranked in the order of importance in Table 2. 
When looking at the average results of the whole 
respondent group the most significant factor in trust creation 
is stated to be the ease of use. It received the mean value of 
5,91, Two out of every five (40,1 %) of the respondents had 
valued this factor as Extremely important (value 7 in the 
Likert scale). 
The ease of use was closely followed by the language 
issues. The respondents feel that when deciding if it is secure 
to use a specific cloud service the fact that the service uses 
their own language is important by an average of 5,86. As 
many as 43,1% of the respondents had given the highest 
importance value for this factor. 
Maybe the most surprising factor is the price, which was 
ranked as the third in the most important factor list ranked by 
the average values, with the mean of 5,72, and 37,1% of the 
respondents given the highest possible importance value to 
this factor.  
When taking a look at the last factors on that list it is 
noted, also quite surprisingly, that the recommendation from 
one’s friends receives the lowest markings out of these 
suggested factors. 
B. Results divided by countries 
These twelve affect factors divided by countries are 
presented  in  Figure  1.  The  ease  of  use  as  well  as  
understandable user license agreements are appreciated the 
most in Finland. The language issues are considered 
extremely important, especially in USA. For the American 
respondents it is also significantly more important that the 
company is located in their home country than for the 
Finnish or Japanese respondents.  Finnish respondents value 
their own and their friends’ experiences more than other two 
countries; actually, in Japan, the recommendation from one’s 
friends receives the lowest markings out of all the questions 
and all the countries. The Japanese respondents, on the other 
hand, have more faith in the search engine results than the 
other two countries, and do not care as much about the 
appearance of the web page as the others.

C. Results divided by genders, age groups and expertise 
levels of the respondents 
As can be seen in Figure 2, the main difference between 
the genders was that the female respondents had given higher 
values to all the factors than the males.  
No similar dependencies could be seen when comparing 
the results between the age groups, presented in Table 3. 
However, there were significant differences in some of the 
factors, especially between the youngest and oldest age 
groups. When looking at the most evident (more than half a 
unit difference between the averages) differences between 
the age groups it can be noticed that the youngsters and the 
elderly people have different attitudes towards a few of the 
factors. The young people (below 35 years) respect their own 
and their friends experiences more than the old ones (over 65 
years) while the opposite is true with the home country and 
language of the service. The results between the different 
self-evaluated expertise groups are shown in Figure 3.  
For the novice users, their own and their friends’ 
experiences, appearance of the service web page, or 
company’s reputation were not as important as for the more 
advanced  users  when  deciding  if  it secure to use a specific

cloud service. On the other hand, the language of the service 
or the location of the service provider did receive lower 
average values from the advanced users than from the novice 
or intermediate users. These results imply that users prefer to 
begin their trust creation process by gaining experiences 
from local service providers who offer services in users’ 
mother tongue. Only when enough experience has been 
collected can the users have confidence to their capabilities 
to judge the security of a service based on their prior 
experiences and knowledge. 
The results divided between the age groups and the 
expertise are strikingly similar. This of course is partly due 
to the fact that there is a correlation between those to 
variables; a bigger percentage of the older people judged 
themselves to be novice users than of the younger people. 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
People are already in the cloud even if they might not 
know it. They use cloud services such as webmail or social 
networking sites without thinking of the underlying 
technology.  Majority of cloud end users still evaluate 
themselves as novice users. [2] In this environment people 
are drawn into services that they trust and feel secure 
towards.  
Our objective for this study was to investigate what 
aspects and to what extent contribute and affect to the secure 
feeling in the cloud. 
The fact that ease of use got the highest average value as 
a factor affecting to end user’s trust and secure feeling 
towards services in the cloud is by no means an unexpected 
result. Already, Fogg and Tseng [15] noted that one of the 
elements   included   in   user   trust   experience   is  that  the

users can trust themselves of being able to control the 
technology. Also, Kaasinen [17] states that the users have to 
have a clear conception of the functionality of the service 
even if they do not need to know all the details. In [24], 
convenience of use was identified as one of two key success 
factors of mobile Internet services.  
It is interesting, though, that ease of use showed to be of 
different importance level with different respondent groups. 
This factor has significantly more importance for the Finns 
than to the Japanese respondents. Some of this may be 
explained by the fact that this factor was more important for 
the advanced users of cloud services than for the novice 
users, and in Finland a considerably larger percentage of 
respondents evaluated themselves to be advanced cloud 
service users than in Japan. 
 
 
Figure 3.  The factors of secure feeling divided by end users’ self-
evaluated experience within cloud services. 
The ease of use was closely followed by the language of 
the service. Especially the American respondents felt 
strongly that when deciding if it is secure to use a specific 
cloud service it is important that the service uses their own 
language. This is quite obvious as English language has such 
a strong ground in ICT sector. The end users have grown 
used to using English in the internet environment. 
It was somewhat surprising that the low price was ranked 
to be the third important factor in this context. 
Conventionally, low price is thought not to increase trust. It 
might be that the fact that many of the largely popular cloud 
services (e.g., Facebook, Gmail and Youtube) are free has 
affected the general atmosphere and consumers are willing to 
lay trust on the free or low priced services more than before 
cloud era. However, low price has also earlier been noted to 
act as one of the key success factors of a specific internet 
solution. [25] 
Limitations of the study mainly rise from the fact that our 
study was conducted as an online survey, which excludes the 
group of people not active in the Internet. Nevertheless, as 
the target of the survey was to study the end users’ attitude 
towards online services it was only natural to choose the 
online method for conducting the survey.

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Our study examined end users’ trust and secure feeling in 
regard to cloud services. An online survey was conducted in 
three countries (Finland, USA and Japan) with more than 
3000 respondents. The twelve factors that create trust in the 
cloud, which were identified by cloud software experts in our 
earlier study, were taken and asked the end users to rank how 
important those factors are for them when deciding if it is 
secure to use a specific cloud service. 
The results show that in general the ease of use has the 
biggest effect on the feeling of security towards cloud 
services, followed by the language and the price of the 
service.  
Some differences were visible between the countries. The 
ease of use as well as understandable user license agreements 
are appreciated the most in Finland. The language issues are 
considered extremely important especially in USA. For the 
American respondents it is also significantly more important 
that the company is located in their home country than for 
the Finnish or Japanese respondents. The Japanese 
respondents, on the other hand, have more faith in the search 
engine results than the other two countries, and do not care 
as much about the appearance of the web page as the others. 
The main difference between the genders was that the 
female respondents had given higher values to all the factors 
than the males. The differences between the age groups and 
expertise were significant between the youngest and oldest 
respondents as well as the self-evaluated novice and 
advanced cloud service users. The young as well as the 
advanced users respect their own and their friends’ 
experiences more than the oldest age group and the novice 
users, while the opposite is true with the home country and 
language of the service. 
These results will be taken a deeper look at our future 
research where we will be studying end users’ perceptions 
towards cloud services and their security using an online
