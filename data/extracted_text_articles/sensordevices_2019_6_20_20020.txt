Abstract—A new single-chip silicon 2D in-plane sensitive Hall-
effect device having the form of a Greek-cross surrounded by a 
deep p-zone is proposed. In each of the four ends of the n-Si 
cross, one ohmic contact is available. Through the original 
design and circuitry, two independent currents with non-
standard topology sharing the same active region are formed. 
The contacts are connected to one load resistor each, whereas 
the resistors with the opposite contacts are fed into one supply 
terminal, and the resistors with the other two contacts are 
connected to the other supply terminal. The pairs of opposite 
contacts are the outputs for the two orthogonal in-plane 
magnetic-field components at sensitivities SRI ≈ 110 V/AT. The 
channel offsets are fully compensated by trimming and the 
contact numbers are only 4. The non-linearity is small and 
does not exceed 0.5 % within the range + 0.6 T ÷ - 0.6 T. The 
cross-talk is very promising and is no more than 2.3% at 
induction B = 1.0 T, the spatial resolution is high compared to 
the standard solutions, reaching 70 x 30 x 40 μm3, and the 
lowest detected magnetic induction with signal – to – noise 
ratio equal to 1 at supply current of 3 mA is Bmin ≈ 11µT. 
Keywords - multidimensional magnetometry; 2D in-plane 
sensitive Hall device; Lorentz force action; three-contact Hall 
element;  functional integration.

 INTRODUCTION  
The most advanced 2D and 3D vector microsensors are 
those using the Hall effect principle, since their action 
involves only one simple and well-defined physical 
phenomenon. Some of the major advantages are: the position 
of the multidimensional device with respect to the magnetic 
source is not as critical as in the case of a 1D sensor, the 
better orthogonality determined by the planar process, the 
perfect matching of the channel sensitivities and more. 
Irrespective of the pronounced progress, these integrated 
vector transducers feature some essential drawbacks. They 
have complicated design containing many contacts and 
numerous connections between them, which restrict 
fabrication technology and reduce spatial resolution. Another 
problem is the channel cross-talk and offsets, which impede 
metrological accuracy. All 2D and 3D Hall devices suffer 
from these drawbacks [1]–[15]. For example, the contact 
numbers are 8 – 10 and even more, while the average cross-
talk and offsets without compensation reaches around 3.5 -   
4 % at induction B = 1.0 T and 7-9 mV, respectively. The Bx, 
By and Bz components of field B can be measured via 
functional integration of orthogonal and in-plane sensitive 
Bipolar Magneto Transistors (BMTs) located into a single 
substrate. Two in-plane differential BMTs with central 
emitter, a common active region and mutually perpendicular 
orientations of the other contacts (collectors and bases) are 
sufficient for the in-plane detection of components Bx and 
By. Unfortunately, the main sensor problems remain, and 
these are: channel offsets, cross-talk, strong temperature 
dependence of sensitivities.

device. 
The key reason for these drawbacks is the complicated 
transducer mechanisms acting in the magnetotransistor 
substrate. That is why the Hall principle of operation remains 
very frequently used for multidimensional magnetometry. In 
this paper, we present a novel single-chip sensing device for 
measurement of two orthogonal in-plane magnetic field 
components using one and the same transducer region, 
featuring simple design, high spatial resolution and improved 
characteristics.  
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section

IV, we describe the experimental results. We conclude the 
work in Section V. 
II. 
CONCEPT AND FABRICATION OF THE 2D HALL DEVICE 
The new multidimensional device consists of an n-Si 
Greek-cross surrounded by a deep p-zone. In each end of the 
cross, symmetrically to its centre O, there is one ohmic n+-n 
contact C1, C2, C3 and C4, which is connected to one load 
resistor R1 …R4. Resistors R1 and R2, which are located 
opposite to contacts C1 and C2, are fed into one terminal of 
supply ES, while resistors R3 and R4 are connected to the 
other ends, as shown in Figure 1. The pairs of contacts C1-
C2 and C3-C4 are the differential outputs VHx(Bx) and 
VHy(By) for the two in-plane components Bx and By of the 
magnetic-field vector B.  
Notwithstanding the lack of a central supply electrode 
as with conventional 2D and 3D Hall magnetometers [6]-[9] 
[11]-[15], through the original design and circuitry, 
mutually perpendicular current couples IC3O and IOC1, and     
I C4O and IOC2 respectively, are formed, as shown in Figure 1. 
The experimental prototype has been implemented using 
part of the processing steps applied in bipolar Integrated 
Circuits (IC) technology. The low-doped n-Si plates are 300 
μm thick, with resistivity ρ ≈ 7.5 Ω.cm. The carrier’s 
concentration is n ~ 4.3 х 1015 cm-3. Similar to [17] [18], four 
masks are employed in the fabrication process. Mask 1 
determines the n+-implanted zones for ohmic electrical 
contacts C1…C4 with the substrate, as the depth of the ohmic 
n+-n junctions is about 1 μm. Mask 2 forms areas for the 
deep Greek-cross p-ring. The p-ring constricts the effective 
volume of the sensor and prevents the surface current 
spreading. All this increases the transducer efficiency of the 
novel 2D device. Mask 3 defines the metallization layer and 
bonding pads. Mask 4 is intended for the contact opening in 
the surface layer SiO2 for the electrical contact between the 
metal and the n+ zones. The width of the deep surrounding p-
ring at the surface is about 20 μm (on the mask). The dopant 
donor concentration of the n+-n junctions is n ≈ 1020 cm-3. 
The size of the ohmic contacts C1…C4 is 20 х 5μm2; the 
length and the width of the Greek-cross are 70 μm and 30 
μm. The thickness of the effective area is defined in first 
approximation by the trajectory of currents IC3,C1 and IC4,C2 
penetrating in the n-Si substrate with depth of 30 – 40 µm 
[15]. As a result, the effective operational volume of the 
cross is about 70 x 30 x 40μm3, which provides high spatial 
resolution of the new device. The sensor has the following 
internal resistances: RC1,2  ≈  RC3,4  ≈  860 Ω. Resistors R1… 
R4 are at least by one order of magnitude greater than the 
effective resistance between ohmic contacts C1 …C4, their 
value being equal to 10 kΩ. At this stage, the 2D in-plane 
sensitive Hall device is in hybrid realization (resistor 
elements R1 …R4 are discrete). 
III. 
OPERATING PRINCIPLE 
The current paths in the device from Figure 1 start and 
end on the heavy-doped n+ contacts C1 …C4. The planar 
ohmic electrodes C1 …C4 represent equipotential planes to 
which, in the absence of external magnetic field В, В = 0, 
current paths IC1, IC2, and IC3, IC4 respectively, flow 
perpendicularly to the upper surfaces of the n-Si slab, deeply 
penetrating into the bulk of 30 – 40 µm [15]. The current 
lines IC1,2 and I C3,4 in the other parts of the substrate in first 
approximation are parallel to the upper surface. Therefore, 
the two trajectories IC1,2 and IC4,3 are curvilinear. As a result 
of the uniformity of the structure, as well as of contacts       
C1 …C4, the two currents components IC1,2 and - I C3,4 are 
equal in value and opposite in sign. As a result of 
technological imperfections, mechanical strain and stress 
during chip metallization and capsulation, temperature 
gradients and the like [1] [2] [4] [12] [15] [16], at outputs 
VHx(Bx = 0) and VHy(By = 0) of the device, at field B = 0, 
offset VH(B = 0) ≠ 0 appears, notwithstanding the fact that 
load resistors R1… R4 are equal. Full compensation of the 
offset at the differential channel outputs is carried out by 
connecting to the load resistors of low-ohmic trimmers. By 
varying the trimmer values, the offsets vanishes, VHx(Bx = 0) 
= VHy(By = 0) = 0. The original structure from Figure 1 
forms, irrespective of the absence of supply electrode in 
centre 
О, 
two 
identical 
3-contact 
(3C) 
mutually 
perpendicular in-plane sensitive Hall devices, possessing two 
end contacts each, C1–C2 and C3-C4, [1] [2] [19] [20]. This 
unexpected solution results from the fact that, with respect to 
centre О of the cross, current components IOC1 and - IOC2, and 
IOC3 and - IOC4, respectively, feature equal values and 
opposite directions. The topology of these current paths is 
the same as in the case where, in centre О, there is a third 
supply contact. Such innovative structure of the 3С sensor is 
described for the first time. 
In magnetic field B, Bx > 0 and By > 0, the well-known 
Lorentz force FL = qvdr x Bx and FL = qvdr x By controls the 
lateral and vertical components of the drift velocity vdr [1] [2] 
[19] [20]. In the trajectory parts O – C1 and O – C2, as well 
as O – C3 and O – C4, respectively, the force FL acts in 
opposite directions. Therefore, the force FL shrinks or 
expands the trajectories towards the surface of the substrate, 
or towards the bulk. As a result, Hall potential appears on the 
boundary near to electrodes С1 and С2, and С3 and С4, 
respectively, and additional (e.g. negative) non-steady-state 
charges proportional to fields Bx and By, and current IC1,2 
arise. Thus, opposite-sign Hall potentials are generated on 
the respective contacts C1–C2 and C3-C4. This operation is as 
in three-contact in-plane sensitive Hall element [19] [20]. 
Through the circuitry connections, the opposite-sign 
potentials along the two axes х an y form the respective Hall 
voltages on the two differential outputs VHx(Bx) and VHy(By) 
for fields Bx and By, as shown in Figure 1. Thus, magnetic 
field В generates in the х-y plane simultaneously linear and 
odd output voltages in the channels. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The output characteristics VHx(Bx) and VHy(By) of the new 
Greek-cross Hall configuration are presented in Figure 2. 
The channel sensitivities are equal to SRI ≈ 110V/AT. The 
non-linearity is small and does not exceed 0.5 % within the 
range + 0.6 T ÷ - 0.6 T. The effective spatial resolution is 
high, constituting about 70 x 30 x 40 μm3, which allows to 
detect more detailed magnetic-field topology.

the nullification of the two output offsets, using the 
following approach. 
The first step is experimental determination of the 
channel characteristics of the two outputs – the sensitivity by 
Hall voltages VHx(Bx) and VHy(By). The next step is applying 
homogeneous variable magnetic induction B parallel to one 
of the axes x or z. The other output (parasitic) the signal from 
the y-channel is measured.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Cross-sensitivity C.S. (cross-talk) of the two-axis device from 
Figure 1 as a function of induction B, T = 20 ºC. The cross-talk at induction     
B = 1 T reach no more than 2.3 % 
Figure 4.  The measured power spectral density of noise of one channel 
VHy(By = 0) without magnetic field, the supply current Is is as a parameter, 
T = 20°C. The noise density for channel VHx(Bx = 0) is the same. 
The procedure described is repeated for the other 
orthogonal direction x. The cross-sensitivity in our case is 
mainly due to the geometrical magnetoresistance MR ~ B2, 
reaching no more than 2.3 % at induction B ≤ 1.0 T, as 
shown in Figure 3. This is a very promising result. 
The internal noise of the 2D Hall device without interface 
circuitry within the range 10 Hz < f ≤ 1 kHz is of the 1/f type, 
as shown in Figure 4. With the increase of bias current Is, the 
noise increases, too. The mean lowest detected magnetic 
induction Bmin over a ∆f  = [5Hz ÷ 500 Hz] bandwidth with 
signal-to-noise ratio S/N = 1 at supply current of 3 mA is 
Bmin ≈ 10 – 11 µT, where SA = ∆VH/∆B is the absolute 
magnetosensitivity, and SNV(f) is the voltage noise spectral 
density across the respective output contacts of the new 
configuration. The induction Bmin is determined at fully 
compensated offset in an appropriate magnetic shielded box. 
The measured power spectral density of the internal noise 
in channels VHx(Bx) and VHy(By) is shown in Figure 4, where 
the supply current Is is a parameter at T = 20 °C.  
The temperature coefficient of the magnetosensitivity 
reaches about 0.1 %/ °C. The established temperature 
coefficient of the device resistance is TCR ≈ 0.1 %. 
The thermal behaviour of the fully compensated outputs 
VHx(Bx) = VHy(By) = 0 at a given temperature T0 originates 
from the same active transducer region. In our case, the 
offset compensation is carried out at T0 = 20 °C. The 
obtained output voltage-to-residual offset ratio, for example 
at T = 40 °C, reaches about 6 x 103 at induction B = 1 T. This 
is a optimal result, as shown in Figure 5. With the increase of 
supply current Is, as typical for Hall sensors [1] [2], the 
temperature drift at the output increases. For this reason, a 
trade-off between drift and sensitivity should be sought. In 
our case, this situation is achieved at current Is ≈ 2 mA. 
According to the results, the value of the temperature drift is 
low. The temperature coefficient of the offset drift reaches 
no more than 0.1 %/°C. 
All measurements of the characteristics of the new 2D 
device were performed in full compliance with the 
methodology explained in detail in [1] [2].

CONCLUSION 
The novel 2D silicon magnetometer for simultaneous 
measure of two orthogonal components of the magnetic field 
using a common sensor zone provides good prospects for 
many applications. Comparing the obtained results with the 
state-of-the-art shows that the novel 2D Hall sensor 
possesses at least 15 % better cross-talk, the channel offsets 
are fully compensated easily by trimming, and the contact 
numbers are only four. A detailed study of temperature 
influence on the 2D microsensor characteristics behavior is 
forthcoming. These results will be used in low-field 
magnetometry. The fabrication of a fully integrated version 
of the new 2D sensor is underway. The repeatability of 
magnetosensitivity and temperature coefficient of sensitivity, 
in our case, are defined as the maximum variation in the 
channel output readings when induction B is constant, B = 
const. At least two calibration cycles are needed [1]. The 
repeatability of the new device will be determined in the 
future. The obtained performance is appropriate for 
contactless applications, such as in robotics and industrial 
control, tactile systems, space orientation, measurement of 
angular and linear displacements, speed sensors, end-of-
travel transducers, compass, unmanned flight vehicles, 
navigation, automobiles – ignition timing, Anti-lock Braking 
System (ABS) systems and more.
