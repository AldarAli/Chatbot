Abstract - Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is major 
method for decision making now and decision maker’s  
answers are strongly related to his or her cognitive abilities. 
Inner dependence AHP is used for cases in which criteria or 
alternatives are not independent enough. In the process, 
calculations and compositions of weights are very important 
steps. Using the original AHP or inner dependence AHP may 
cause results losing reliability because the comparison matrix 
is not necessarily sufficiently consistent. In such cases, fuzzy 
representation for weighting criteria or alternatives using 
results from sensitivity analysis is useful. In the previous 
papers, we defined local weights of criteria and alternatives for 
inner dependence AHP via fuzzy sets. In this paper, we deal 
with overall weights of alternatives for double inner 
dependence structure AHP (among criteria and among 
alternatives respectively). Results show the fuzziness of double 
inner dependence structure AHP in different way of 
composition of weights.  
Keywords - decision making; AHP; fuzzy sets; sensitivity 
analysis. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) proposed by 
T.L. Saaty in 1977 [1][2] is widely used in decision making, 
because it reflects humans feelings “naturally”. A normal 
AHP assumes independence among criteria and alternatives, 
although it is difficult to choose enough independent 
elements. Inner dependence method AHP [3] is used to 
solve this problem even for criteria or alternatives having 
dependence.  
A comparison matrix may not, however, have enough 
consistency when AHP or inner dependence is used because, 
for instance, a problem may contain too many criteria or 
alternatives for decision making, meaning that answers from 
decision-makers, i.e., comparison matrix components, do 
not have enough reliability, they are too ambiguous or too 
fuzzy [4]. To avoid this problem, we usually have to revise 
again or abandon the data, but it takes a lot of time and 
costs[2][3]. 
Then, we consider that weights should also have 
ambiguity or fuzziness. Therefore, it is necessary to 
represent these weights using fuzzy sets. 
Our research first applied sensitivity analysis [5] to inner 
dependence AHP to analyze how much the components of a 
pairwise comparison matrix influence the weights and 
consistency of a matrix [6]. This may enable us to show the 
magnitude of fuzziness in weights. We previously proposed 
new representation for criteria and alternatives weights in 
AHP, also representation for criteria weights for inner 
dependence, as L-R fuzzy numbers [7]. In the next step, we 
stated deal with double inner dependence structure [8]. In 
this paper, we consider composition of weights to obtain 
over all alternative weights for double inner dependence 
structure AHP, using results from sensitivity analysis and 
fuzzy operations. We then consider fuzziness as a result of 
double inner dependence AHP when a comparison matrix 
among alternatives does not have enough consistency.   
In Section II, we introduce AHP and its inner 
dependence method. The sensitivity analyses for AHP are 
described 
in Section III. Then the 
fuzzy weight 
representation is defined in Section IV, and Section V is a 
example and conclusions. 
 
II.  INNER DEPENDENCE  AHP AND CONSISTENCY 
In this section, we introduce process of AHP, 
consistency of data (comparison matrix) and inner 
dependence method.  
A. 
Process of Normal AHP 
 (Process 1) Representation of structure by a hierarchy. 
The problem under consideration can be represented in a 
hierarchical structure. At the middle levels, there are 
multiple criteria. Alternative elements are put at the lowest 
level of the hierarchy. 
(Process 2) Paired comparison between elements at each 
level. A pairwise comparison matrix A is created from a 
decision maker's answers. Let n be the number of elements 
at a certain level, the upper triangular components of the  
matrix aij (i< j = 1,…,n) are 9, 8, .. , 2, 1, 1/2, …, or 1/9. 
These denote intensities of importance from element i to j. 
The lower triangular components aji are described with 
reciprocal numbers, for diagonal elements, let aii = 1.  
(Process 3) Calculations of weight at each level. The 
weights of the elements, which represent grade of 
importance among each element, are calculated from the 
pairwise 
comparison 
matrix. 
The 
eigenvector 
that 
corresponds to a positive eigenvalue of the matrix is used in 
calculations throughout in this paper. 
(Process 4) Priority of an alternative by a composition of 
weights. With repetition of composition of weights, the 
overall weights of the alternative, which are the priorities of

the alternatives with respect to the overall objective, are 
finally found. 
B. 
Consistency 
Since components of the comparison matrix are obtained 
by comparisons between two elements, coherent consistency 
is not guaranteed.  In AHP, the consistency of the 
comparison matrix A is measured by the following 
consistency index (C.I.) 
where n is the order of comparison matrix A, and λA is its 
maximum eigenvalue (Frobenius root). 
If the value of C.I. becomes smaller, then the degree of 
consistency becomes higher, and vice versa. The omparison 
matrix is consistent if the following inequality holds. 
1.0
C.I.
                  (2) 
C. 
Inner Dependence Structure  
The normal AHP ordinarily assumes independence 
among criteria and alternatives, although it is difficult to 
choose enough independent elements. Inner dependence 
AHP [3] is used to solve this type of problem even for 
criteria or alternatives having dependence.  
In the method, using a dependency matrix F={ fij }, we 
can calculate modified weights w(n) as follows, 
where w is weights from independent criteria or alternatives, 
i.e., normal weights of normal AHP and dependency matrix 
F is consist of eigenvectors of influence matrices showing 
dependency among criteria or alternatives.  
If there is dependence both lower levels, i.e., not only 
among criteria but also among alternatives, we call such 
kind of structure ”double inner dependence”. In the double 
inner dependence structure, we have to calculate modified 
weights of criteria and alternatives,  w(n) and ui
(n). Then we 
composite these 2 modified weights to obtain overall 
weights of alternative k,

where m is number of criteria. 
III. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES 
When we actually use AHP, it often occurs that a 
comparison matrix is not consistent or that there is not great 
difference among the overall weights of the alternatives. In 
these cases, it is very important to investigate how 
components of the pairwise comparison matrix influence on 
its consistency or on the weights. To analyse how results are 
influenced when a certain variable has changed, we can use 
sensitivity analysis.  
In this study, we use a method that some of the present 
authors have proposed before. It evaluates a fluctuation of 
the consistency index and the weights when the comparison 
matrix is perturbed. It is useful because it does not change a 
structure of the data. 
Since the pairwise comparison matrix is a positive 
square matrix, Perron-Frobenius theorem holds. From 
Perron-Frobenius theorem, following theorem about a 
perturbed comparison matrix holds. 
Theorem 1 Let A = (aij), (i, j = 1,…, n) denote a comparison 
matrix and let A(ε) = A+εDA, DA=(aijdij) denote a matrix 
that has been perturbed. Let λA be the Frobenius root of A, 
w be the eigenvector corresponding toλA, and v be the 
eigenvector corresponding to the Frobenius root of A'. 
Then, a Frobenius root λ ( ε ) of A( ε ) and a 
corresponding eigenvector w( ε ) can be expressed as 
follows

B.   Analysis for Weights of AHP  
About the fluctuation of the weights, following corollary 
also can be obtained from Theorem 1. 
Corollary 2 Using appropriate hij
(k), we can represent the 
fluctuation w(1)=(wk
(1)) of the weight (i.e., the eigenvector 
corresponding to the Frobenius root) as follows

From the equation (6) in Theorem 1, the component that 
has a great influence on weight w(ε) is the component 
which has the greatest influence on w(1). Accordingly, from 
Corollary 2, how components of a comparison matrix 
impart influence on the weights, can be found, to see hij
(k) in 
the equation (10). 
 Calculations or proofs of these theorem and corollaries 
are shown in [7]. 
    
IV.  FUZZY WEIGHTS REPRESENTATIONS 
A comparison matrix often has poor consistency (i.e.,  
0.1<C.I.<0.2) because it encompasses several criteria or 
elements. In these cases, comparison matrix components are 
considered to be fuzzy because they are results from human 
fuzzy judgment. Weights should therefore be treated as 
fuzzy numbers.

B. Fuzzy Weights of Criteria or Alternatives of Normal 
AHP 
From the fluctuation of the consistency index, the 
multiple coefficient gijhij
(k) in Corollary 1 and 2 is 
considered as the influence on aij . 
Since gij is always positive, if the coefficient hij
(k) is 
positive, the real weight of criterion or alternative k is 
considered to be larger than wk. Conversely, if hij
(k) is 
negative, the real weight of criterion or alternative k is 
considered to be smaller. Therefore, the sign of hij
(k) 
represents the direction of the fuzzy number spread. The 
absolute value gij | hij
(k)| represents the size of the influence. 
On the other hand, if C.I. becomes bigger, then the 
judgment becomes fuzzier. 
Consequently, multiple C.I. gij|hij
(k)| can be regarded as a 
spread of a fuzzy weight   concerned with aij. 
Definition 1 (fuzzy weight) Let wk
(n) be a crisp weight of 
criterion or alternative k of inner dependence model, and gij | 
hij
(k)| denote the coefficients found in Corollary 1 and 2. If 
0.1<C.I.<0.2, then a fuzzy weight

V.  EXAMPLE AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this section, we introduce an example of the leasure. 
Criteria are {congestion, good for rain (rain), trouble, cost} 
and alternatives are {Theme park (park), Indoor theme park 
(indoor),  Movie, Zoo}. 
Table I shows a comparison matrix of criteria and weights, 
where its consistency is not so good (C.I. >0.1). Then using 
results of sensitivity analyses of consistency and weights, 
we can calculate fuzzy weights. Next using a dependency 
matrix, modified fuzzy weights are obtained as shown in 
Table II. There is bad dependency and dependency between 
alternatives with only respect to criterion “congestion”, we 
also calculate fuzzy modified weights of alternatives shown 
in Table III. Finally, we evaluate overall fuzzy weights of 
alternatives as in Table IV. 
On the other hand, TableV shows a comparison matrix and 
weights of criteria with enough consistency.

In this case, overall fuzzy weights are shown in Table VI. 
(lower weights are same as fuzzy criteria weight case). 
There are a lot of cases that data of AHP do not have 
enough consistent or reliable. We propose these 2 
compositions of weights, and our approach can show how to 
represent weights and will be efficient to investigate how 
the result of AHP has fuzziness when data is not sufficiently 
consistent or reliable.
