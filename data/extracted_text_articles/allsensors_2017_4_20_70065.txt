Abstract—This 
research 
is 
devoted 
to 
the 
investigation of the toxic CO gas adsorption mechanisms 
on the tin dioxide (SnO2) semiconductor. We used 
density functional theory (DFT) to describe adsorption 
processes and found out that the Mars-van Krevelen 
(MvK) adsorption mechanism is not responsible for 
adsorption on (101) and (001) surface orientations of 
SnO2, unlike  for (110), (100), where CO2 molecule 
forms and desorbs from the surfaces. Electronic density 
of states (eDoS) calculation and Bader charge analysis 
were 
done 
to 
explain 
the 
increase 
of 
surface 
conductance.

 INTRODUCTION  
Carbon 
monoxide 
(CO) 
is 
tasteless 
and 
transparent substance, which is known as an 
“invisible killer” due to the high level of toxicity. It is 
extremely poisonous and can even cause health 
effects up to a certain extent - 9ppm, therefore, the 
detection of CO in the environment is quite vital. For 
the above reasons, chemical sensors are used to 
precisely monitor the concentration of the target 
compounds 
in 
the 
air. 
Usually, 
the 
SnO2 
semiconductor is used as a sensing material in such 
detectors, because of high sensitivity and low 
response time for wide variety of molecules, such as 
CO, H2, CH3OH, NOx, etc. [1]–[8]. In order to 
increase the sensitivity of the detectors, it is crucial to 
deeply investigate adsorption mechanism of CO 
compounds. 
 Several models, which are named as  Langmuir 
Hishelwood [9][10], Eley Redeal [11] and the MvK 
[12], 
have 
been 
developed 
to 
describe 
the 
mechanisms that are responsible for CO adsorption 
on oxide semiconductors. The MvK adsorbtion 
mechanism is in a good agreement with the 
experiments 
on 
SnO2–(110) 
surface 
[13][14]. 
Apparently, the MvK mechanism consists of 
following steps; I) adsorbed CO molecule is reacting 
with tin dioxide oxygen and forms CO2 compound, 
leaving oxygen vacancy in the material; II) then 
remained vacancy fills by adsorbed O2 molecule from 
the environment; III) and finally, another CO 
molecule is reacting with already bonded O2 and 
forms CO2, leaving material in its initial undisturbed 
state.  
We would like to stress that there are plenty of 
manuscripts dedicated to the investigation of CO 
absorption on SnO2 surfaces, using first principle and 
ab 
initio 
DFT 
calculations 
[15][16]. 
Some 
calculations were done particularly for pristine (110) 
surface orientation [17], oxygen reach [18] and 
tainted surfaces [19]. However, very few are devoted 
to other surface orientations (100), (101) [5] and 
(001) [6]. In practice, surface orientation immensely 
influences sensor parameters such as sensitivity, time 
response etc.  
In this manuscript, we explore CO adsorption on 
various surface orientations (110), (100), (101), (001) 
of 
SnO2 
and 
determine 
the 
most 
optimal 
configurations for adsorption, using ab initio DFT 
calculations in order to shed the light on the atomic 
scale processes that still remains elusive and unclear. 
Here, we will rise following issues: I) Does MvK 
mechanism similarly describing adsorption processes 
for all surface orientations of SnO2? II) What is the 
exact amount of charge transferred between the 
surface and adsorbed   CO molecule? III) Which 
surface orientation is more prominent to the 
interaction with the CO molecule? 
 The paper is organized in the following way: 
Section II) is devoted to computational methods and 
surface/bulk structure of SnO2 sensing material. 
Section III) is devoted to the adsorption processes, 
eDoS calculations for the various surface orientations 
of SnO2. Section IV) is dedicated to discussions and 
conclusions. 
II. MODELS AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS 
Calculations were done using conventional ab 
initio DFT [20][21] method implemented in Vienna ab 
initio Simulation Package (VASP) [22]–[24]. DFT 
relaxations were done within Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof 
(PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) 
[25]. The 500eV cutoff energy was chosen due to the 
total energy convergence from that value. Surface 
structures were relaxed until the threshold net force on 
atoms become less than 0.01 eV/A. The Monkhorst-
Pack scheme [26] was used to sample the Brillouin 
zone, using 6x6x1 k-points mesh. After relaxation, the

Bader charge analysis was done to find out charge 
transfer [27]–[29].  
Stable adsorbed configurations were found using 
the following equation: 
 
Eads=Esurf – Eclean – ECO , 
 (1) 
where Eads is adsorption energy, Esurf is total energy of 
SnO2 surface and adsorbed CO,  Eclean is total energy 
of pure surface without CO and ECO is total energy of 
the gas molecule. It is clear from this equation that if 
Eads is negative the configuration of adsorbed site is 
stable, in other words, the process is exothermic. In 
the case of positive Eads,  the process is endothermic: 
the molecule will not adsorb to the surface and will 
remain in the non-interacting state.  
 Bulk SnO2 has rutile, tetragonal structure, 
corresponding to the P42/mnm space group. The lattice 
parameters of SnO2 from [30]–[32] are a = 4.82 Å, 
c = 3.23 Å and u = 0.607. In our calculations (see Fig. 
1) each (110), (100), (101), (001) surface consists of 4 
layers and relative stability has the following sequence 
(110), (100), (101), (001) [6].  Here, number of layers 
was tuned to check the convergence of surface energy. 
However, after getting all results, we double checked 
the obtained data by recalculating stable structures 
with a big substrate of 12 atoms of tin and 24 atoms of 
oxygen and make sure that the results are reliable. For 
all calculations, we choose vacuum thickness of 15 Å, 
which is greater than substrate thickness. For each 
surface, the electronic density of states (eDoS) was 
calculated and established that the gap between 
valence and conduction bands was underestimated, 
because of the self-consistency of DFT calculations. 
From experiments, it is known that value of band gap 
is 3.6 eV, but we get 1 eV, which is in accordance 
with previous DFT calculations [33]. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this section, each surface orientation would be 
described separately. Bader charge analysis, eDoS 
and stable structures would be presented as well. 
A. SnO2 (110) surface 
This surface orientation consists of 4 layers, each 
comprising of 3 subsequent layers. Top sublayer 
represents oxygen, where each atom (O2c) is 
connected by the covalent bond to 2 Sn atoms. The 
Second sublayer has 2 Sn atoms and 2 oxygen atoms. 
Third one is similar to the first layer. So, together 
these 3 sublayers can be treated as one layer which is 
continually repeated 4 times (see Fig1 a). There are 3 
possible adsorption sites: top site (t), bridge site (br), 
three-coordinated oxygen site (3c). For each site, we 
consider 2 configurations: I) C atom in a CO 
molecule is closer to the surface (C down 
configuration) and II) the vice versa configuration (O 
down configuration). Thus, we end up with 6 possible 
configurations for (110) surface. 
 For each separate configuration calculated 
adsorption energies are given in Table I. As we can 
clearly see the O down configuration for all surfaces 
is completely unstable.

In the case of C down configuration, (110) surface 
has 3 stable sites. However, there is only one that is 
transferring the charge form molecule to the surface, 
and it is corresponding to the event when molecule 
approaches to br-site, reacts with oxygen and takes it 
away forming a CO2 molecule and leaves oxygen 
vacancy on the surface.  Here, vacancy could be an 
adsorption site for O2 or CO molecule, as described in 
[15][18]. The 
eDoS 
of 
surface 
reveals 
that 
conductivity of the surface increases by decreasing of 
the band gap. The Bader charge analysis shows 
charge transport to the surface of 1.7e. Such processes 
examined in a number of experimental and theoretical 
studies [13][15][18]. It is important to note, that for 
this particular configuration and surface orientation 
the first step of MvK mechanism is preserved, and the 
distance between CO2 molecule and surface is 3.1 Å. 
For other sites (top and 3c) the CO molecule does 
not 
exchange 
electrons, 
which 
serves 
as 
a 
confirmation that we have physisorption process onto 
the surface. In these cases, band gap does not change 
and distances from carbon to tin atoms are 2.46, 
2.61 Å, respectively.

B. SnO2 (100) surface 
For (100) surface orientation the unit cell also 
consists of same 4 layers, where each layer can be 
divided into 3 sublayers: O-Sn-O layers. The top atom 
of the surface is 2 coordinated oxygen as in (110) 
surface, see Fig. 1 b. Adsorption energies for possible 
two site configurations are given in Table II. 
According to the calculations interaction of CO with 
the O2c site of oxygen leads to the formation of CO2 
molecule and also leaves a vacancy on the surface 
(Fig. 2 a).

In this case, the first step of MvK mechanism is 
also conserved and it leads to charge transfer of 1.6e to 
the surface. Therefore, the surface conductance is 
increasing, because of transferred charge leading to 
the band gap reduction by 0.1eV in comparison to the 
uncharged surface, see Fig. 2 b. Here, the blue lines 
represent the eDoS after desorption that correspond to 
3.25 Å distance from CO molecule to surface.  
The Second possible adsorption site is top(t) on Sn 
atom. Here as for (110), the CO is physisorbed and no 
charge 
transfer 
has 
been 
observed. 
Due 
to 
physisorption, the distance from a carbon atom of CO 
molecule to the oxygen atom of the surface is 2.65 Å.

C. SnO2 (101) surface 
In the case of (101) surface orientation, each of 4 
layers consists of 3 subsequent layers of 2O, 2Sn, 2O. 
There are 3 possible sites of adsorptions O2c, Sn atom 
and 3 coordinated O, which is located in third sub 
layer as it is shown in Fig. 1 (c). Here, only one 
configuration has negative adsorption energy and it is 
O2c (TABLE III).

 The CO molecule adsorbs by the surface and 
remains connected to it in O2c site with a distance of 
1.18 Å (see Fig. 3). During that process, the distance 
between O2c oxygen and Sn atom increases up to 
2.5 Å. The Bader charge analysis shows that there is 
1.9e charge transferred to the surface, which make it 
more conductive. Thus, adsorption mechanism on 
(101) surface differs from MvK, because no CO2 
desorption observed. Conductivity increases and band 
gap decreases due to transferred charge, see Fig. 3 
(b), where blue lines represent eDoS after adsorption 
and have more states around Fermi level (Energy = 0 
in the horizontal axis). 
D. SnO2 (001) surface 
In this case, we have a completely different 
situation. Instead of 4 layers that consist of 3 
subsequent layers, we have got only one that consists 
of one atom of Sn and 2 oxygen atoms. There are two 
possible sites: on top of Sn (t) site and O2c (2c) site 
Fig. 1 (d). Moreover, there are 2 equivalent 2c sites in 
one unit cell, thus we should take into account two 
possible coverages. The first is when both sites are 
occupied by the CO molecule and form one mono 
layer (ML=1). The second possible coverage is when 
only one site is occupied and half mono layer of CO 
forms (ML = 0.5). For ML = 0.5, carbon monoxide 
adsorbed and stay bounded with a distance of 1.16 Å 
(Fig. 4) to the O2c atom, transferring 2e charge to the 
substrate (see TABLE IV). 
 For ML = 1, one CO molecule adsorbed and one 
physisorbed in a 1.255 and 2.6 Å distances, 
respectively. In fact, for (001) only ML=0.5 coverage 
can happen, because when one CO adsorbed, the 
second one will be physisorbed. Bader charge 
analysis shows that 1.83e was transferred to the 
surface.

In both cases, surface conduction increases and 
band gap decreases due to charge transfer from the 
CO molecule. On Fig. 4 (b)(d), the red lines represent 
eDoS of undistorted surface and blue correspond to 
the eDoS after adsorption, which has more states 
around Fermi level compared to undistorted surfaces 
eDoS. Physisorption occurs for the top site with 
distance 2.41 Å. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Previously, it was considered that adsorption on 
SnO2 surfaces follows MvK mechanism; however, 
here we have proven that CO adsorption on 
SnO2(101), (001) is different.  Here, the C atom of the 
CO molecule remains bonded to surface’s O atom. 
Also, we find out that in the case of (001) surface 
orientation CO coverage can be only half mono layer 
(ML = 0.5). For (110) and (100) surfaces, we establish 
that adsorption obeys MvK mechanism, where its first 
stage CO2 molecules are forming during CO-surface 
interaction. For all adsorption cases, O down 
configuration was not stable, due to positive 
adsorption energy. 
The Bader charge analysis reveals that charge 
transfer to (101), (001) surfaces are 1.9e, 2e 
respectively and 1.7e, 1.6e for (110), (100) surfaces. 
The eDoS combined with Bader analysis shows that 
(101), (001) surface orientations gather more electrons 
than the rest orientations, thus, those should be 
considered as a better platform for the interaction of 
the CO molecules with SnO2 surfaces. We believe 
that our findings will pave the way for the fabrication 
of SnO2 based CO sensors with higher sensitivity and 
lower response time.
