Abstract— We report on a new design for near-field sensing 
based on a fiber-coupled microcavity. The device operates on 
the bases of sensing in the evanescent near-field zone and offers 
a robust portable probe solution for in-vivo sensing and 
diagnostics. In preliminary tests, the first generation device has 
already demonstrated sensitivity in the range of 10-3 and 10-4 
refractive index units (RIU) and 20 nm/RIU. Using this device, 
we have also observed, through spectral shift, the binding of a 
self-assembled monolayer (~ 5 Ǻ thickness) of amino-silane.

INTRODUCTION  
    The proliferation of optical bio-sensors has made point of 
use diagnostics a reality. Label free bio-sensors interact with 
biological materials often times in bulk solution without the 
need for any fluorescent bio-markers or dyes, allowing for a 
more elegant detection or diagnostic protocol [1].  
    Though many breakthroughs have been made in regard to 
detection sensitivity, bringing this technology from a lab 
(optical table) setting into a scalable and robust micro-
device remains a challenging problem [2]. Furthermore, 
there exists a demand for in-vivo or in-situ use for real-time 
monitoring of cellular environments. Fiber-optic based 
platforms with sub-micron sized dimensions prove to be one 
of the more promising technologies due to their needle-like 
geometries [3]. Despite the functional advantages and 
published sensitivities around 10-4 to 10-7 RIU, optical fiber 
based platforms still remain several orders of magnitude less 
sensitive than other bio-sensing technologies such as 
Surface Plasmon Resonance sensors, Whispering Gallery 
Mode sensors, and interferometric sensors [4].   However, 
novel fiber-based platforms could increase the capacity for 
sensitivity and serve as a more robust and low-cost bio-
sensor solution. A portable high-sensitivity in-vivo device 
could have immense impact in driving down the cost of 
healthcare and guiding vaccine and medicinal distribution 
networks [5].  
    This work-in-progress report presents a novel bio-sensor 
with a probe structure that has the potential for in-vivo or in-
situ sensing and probing of bio-environments. This simple, 
portable, micro-scale device can pick up minute changes, 
via phase-shift and amplitude change, in its microcavity’s 
immediate vicinity (evanescence zone).  It could be used   
for diagnostics or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and protein 
assays, and as a possible low-cost tool to aid in the 
understanding of binding events of specific target 
molecules. The micro-probe consists of a micro-cavity 
formed at, and optically coupled to, the tip of an optical 
fiber, resulting in a compact, simple, and bio-compatible 
design for refractive index sensing. Preliminary experiments 
for the first generation device have yielded an initial, non-
optimized limit of detection of 10-3 to 10-4 RIU with 20 
nm/RIU.   
    This manuscript will discuss the fabrication and structure 
of the fiber-coupled micro-cavity probe, the working 
principles, and provide experimental validations and 
preliminary detection capabilities

DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
The micro-probe is made by tapering hollow borosillicate 
tubes (1mm OD, .75 mm ID) down to tip diameters of 25-50 
µm. The tapering was achieved using a Sutter Instrument P-
2000 Micropipette Puller. A 20W Class IV CO2 laser was 
used as the heating source while the borosilicate tube was 
pulled from both sides as shown in Fig. 1. Custom programs 
were written for the pipette puller to achieve long and 
gradual tapers. The tapered tips were then melted with a 
gentle flame from standard butane lighter, whereupon the 
molten glass forms a solid glass spherical tip due to surface 
tension. The symmetry of the spherical tips was maintained 
by constant spinning of the tips during the melting process. 
The total resulting structure consists of a finely tapered air 
cavity that extends into a solid glass spherical tip, as seen in 
Fig. 2.

Then, standard SMF-28 telecom fibers were stripped, 
cleaved and inserted into this tapered cavity, eventually 
becoming wedged. The optical fiber remains stationary due 
to the cylindrical geometry of the tapered air cavity and

WORKING PRINCIPLES 
A.  Fizeau  Interferometry 
   The resulting spherical probe structure contains two 
effective reflection surfaces for incident light through the 
optical fiber [6]. The first interface is between the end of the 
cleaved fiber and the air cavity, and the second interface is 
between the edge of the solid glass spherical tip and the 
outside environment, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, when 
incoming light through the fiber enters the device, the 
reflection from the second interface recombines with the 
reflection from the first interface described by the reflection 
from an effective Fabry-Perot cavity. 
    The second interface is an effective one that is subjected 
to change by the material in the evanescence-zone of the 
probe tip.  The spherical tip forms a secondary (weak Q) 
cavity for the entering light scattered from the sharp air-tip.  
 
 
Figure 3.  Ray-optics of light propagation in probe geometry. 
    Surrounding the outer surface of this microcavity is the 
aforementioned evanescence-zone. A change of material, 
temperature, or pH, even a minute one, in this zone would 
effectively change the size of this cavity, which translates 
into a phase-shift that can be measured from the overall 
interference pattern. 
 
B. Use as a Sensor 
    Increasing the refractive index of the environment outside 
of the spherical tip naturally decreases the reflection 
coefficient for reflections below the critical angle and thus 
decreases the amplitude of the interference signal. However, 
this is not the only effect. Experiments show a clear phase 
change with changing refractive index in exterior 
environments. 
    Due to the unique geometry of the sharply tapered air 
cavity between the two reflection interfaces, this device is 
able to bend the wave fronts of the fiber-outputted light in 
such a way that allows for multiple reflections in the 
spherical silica tip and probe neck, eventually coupling the 
light back into the optical fiber. This light propagates in the 
spherical tip with a refractive index, n1, through a series of 
reflections with non-normal incident angle, θi, allowing the 
reflections which meet the total internal reflection criteria 
are greatly affected by the Goos-Hänchen effect [7]. 
Changing the refractive index, n2, at the interface along the 
spherical tip will modulate the Goos-Hänchen shift, thus, 
shifting the interference pattern by a phase, δ, described by, 
    
 
 
 
where n = n2/n1. 
    Treating the device as an effective Fabry-Perot cavity [6], 
the total reflected intensity could be derived using the Airy 
Summation Method, 
 
  
 
 
where r1 and r2 represent the reflection coefficient of the two 
interfaces of an asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavity. Substituting 
r1 = – r2 into (2) would recover the standard equation for the 
reflection of a symmetric Fabry-Perot cavity. Fig. 4 shows 
the model interference patterns produced from (2) for n2 of 
air, water, and ethanol. The experimentally obtained 
interference patterns for the same environment are shown in 
Fig. 5.

    This effective F-P model worked remarkably well, 
despite the complex structure and geometry, and can be 
used as a tool by which to measure material changes in the 
probe’s immediate vicinity or specific binding events.

EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATION  
A. Experimental Set-Up 
    The experimental set-up to demonstrate the interference 
properties of the fiber-coupled micro-sphere tip is illustrated 
in Fig. 6. An Ando AQ4320D Tunable Laser Source was 
wired to a 2×1 fiber optic coupler. The output of the coupler 
was sent to the SMF-28 fiber wedged in the micro-sphere 
tip. The reflected signal from the tip was measured by an 
Ando AQ6317 Optical Spectrum Analyzer wired to the 
second output of the coupler.

interference measurements. 
    Both the Tunable Laser Source and the Optical Spectrum 
Analyzer were connected to a PC and controlled by a 
LabVIEW VI. Spectra collection was also accomplished by 
the same program. 
B. Refractive Index Sensing  with Ethanol-Water Mixture 
    For a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of this 
device, the probe was submerged in 0.5 mL DI water and 
then subsequently submerged in incremental concentrations 
of ethanol-water mixtures ranging from 0 to 50% volume 
fraction of ethanol. In each mixture, a 3 nm spectral sweep 
was performed centered around 1550 nm with 1 mW laser 
power. The reflected power was measured and demonstrated 
a red spectral shift with increasing ethanol concentration, as 
shown in Fig. 7.  
 
Figure 7.  Blue to red shift of interference pattern show incremental 10-3
 
RIU changes in each  measured ethanol-water mixture. 
    The refractive index of each ethanol-water mixture was 
measured using a Fisher Scientific Abbe Benchtop 
Refractometer.  Fig. 8 plots the peak-to-peak amplitude of 
the spectrums and the peak wavelength as a function of 
mixture refractive index. Both the intensity change and 
spectral shift demonstrated a near-linear change with 
increasing refractive index, demonstrating a sensitivity of 
~10-3 RIU, and 20 nm/RIU.

the corresponding wavelength at each interference peak (spectral shift). 
    Deviations from the linearity could be due to temperature 
fluctuations during testing as well as non-uniform mixing in 
the ethanol-water samples. Further testing must be done in a 
flow-system for temperature and mixing control in order to 
experimentally demonstrate a higher Limit of Detection 
(LOD).  
 
C. Monitory Formation of Self-Assembled Monolayer 
     The probe surfaces were cleaned in Piranha solution (3:1 
v/v of H2SO4:H2O2) and then placed in a solution of 2% v/v 
of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in acetone [8]. 
The 
solution 
was 
sealed 
with 
a 
molded 
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stopper and PTFE thread 
seal tape to avoid evaporation. Silanization of APTES refers 
to the binding of APTES molecules onto a substrate surface. 
It is often used to functionalize silica substrates for selective 
immobilization of protein bio-targets [9]. The probe was 
submerged in the solution for 12 hours as continuous 3 nm 
spectral sweeps, centered around 1550 nm with 1 mW laser 
power, were taken. The interference patterns obtained 
during the 12-hour APTES silanization exhibit blue spectral 
shift, as shown in Fig. 9. 
 
 
Figure 9.  Spectral shift of interference pattern due to silanization during 
the first 12 hour of incubation. 
    This result is counter to the spectral shifts observed in 
typical 
resonance 
sensors, 
caused 
by 
an 
effective 
lengthening of the optical path due to the presence of the 
monolayer [10][11][12]. However, this counter-intuitive 
effect was reproduced in multiple molecular binding 
experiments, and could be caused by a lessening of optical 
tunneling into the bulk solution due to the higher Δn 
between the APTES layer and the bulk solution (assuming 
that nAPTES > nGlass). 
 
 
Figure 10.  Reflected power at single wavelength during silanization 
process plotted at (a) the 12-hour incubation period and (b) during the first 
30 minutes of incubation. 
     The reflected power change at 1549.5 nm (rising 
inflection point) of the interference pattern, shown in Fig. 
10, illustrates the self-assembly of the APTES monolayer in 
the first 30 minutes, and subsequent intermolecular 
interactions of APTES molecules on top of this monolayer 
in the 12-hour period after the monolayer formation, 
resulting in a total spectral shift of ~0.2 nm. This observed 
monolayer binding time-scale (~30 minutes) agrees with the 
standard binding protocol time-scale for a 5 Å monolayer 
formation of APTES on a silica substrate [9].  
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
    Demonstrating the mode coupling between an optical 
fiber and microcavity sphere works to bring the high 
sensitivity of microcavity sensors, particularly Whispering 
Gallery Mode sensors, off of the optical table and into a 
robust integrated microprobe [13]. The probe design has the 
distinct advantage of use in vivo without the need of 
microfluidics or alignment of evanescent coupling, and can 
be implemented for sample volumes on the order of nano-
liters. The first generation microprobes demonstrated 
sensitivity in the range of 10-3 and 10-4 RIU and 20 nm/RIU 
in bulk solutions. In addition, monitoring of the spectral 
shift during the salinization process confirms a high degree 
of near-field (evanescent) sensitivity due to immobilized 
surface molecules as the formation of the 5 Å self-

assembled APTES monolayer was detected in real-time. 
Thus, the experimental results demonstrates the proof-of-
concept that this fiber-coupled microcavity probe can be 
used for detection of specific immobilized bio-targets, and 
even has potential use in studying real-time surface reaction 
kinetics. 
    Furthermore, though exhibiting sensitivity in bulk 
solution less than that achieved in other optical biosensors 
such as Surface Plasmon Resonance sensors, ring resonator 
sensors and interferometric sensors, which are able to detect 
down to 10-7 RIU, the data recorded thus far is from proof-
of-concept hand-made microprobes that are yet to undergo 
optimization as far as their cavity size and geometric effects 
on mode coupling [4]. For example, by fabricating smaller 
diameter spherical tips, we will be able to increase the 
nm/RIU limit of detection due to a shorter effective cavity 
length. Similarly, implementing a controlled and mechanical 
method for melting and shaping the tapered tube, we hope to 
optimize the geometry of the tapered air cavity and probe 
curvatures. This optimization could lead to enhanced mode 
coupling between the fiber and the spherical tip. The 
geometric variations of the tapered air cavity and probe 
curvature could allow for tunability between the competing 
effects of the reflection coefficient modulation and Goos-
Hänchen phase shift for the creation of far field and near 
field sensors respectively.
