Abstract—Robust and practical device authentication is an 
essential security feature for cyber physical systems and the 
Internet of Things. After giving an overview on device 
authentication options, several proposals for advanced device 
authentication means are presented to increase the attack

A 
well-known 
cryptographic device authentication using a symmetric 
cryptographic key or a digital certificate for device 
authentication can be extended with additional validations to 
check the device identity. Ideas from advanced human user

INTRODUCTION 
The need for technical information technology (IT) 
security measures increases rapidly to protect products and 
solutions from manipulation and reverse engineering [1]. 
This scope is further broadened to also include operational 
technology (OT). Cryptographic IT security mechanisms 
have been known for many years, and are applied in smart 
devices (Internet of Things, Cyber Physical Systems, 
industrial and energy automation systems, operation 
technology) [2]. Such mechanisms target authentication, 
system and communication integrity and confidentiality of 
data in transit or at rest. 
A central security mechanism is authentication: By 
authentication, a claimed identity is proven. Authentication 
of a person can be performed by verifying something the 
person knows (e.g., a password), something the person has 
(e.g., a physical authentication token, smart card, or a 
passport), or something the person is (biometric property, 
e.g., a fingerprint, voice, iris, or behavior).  
Advanced authentication techniques make use of 
multiple 
authentication 
factors, 
and 
performing 
authentication continuously during a session. With multi-
factor authentication, several independent authentication 
factors are verified, e.g., a password and an authentication 
token. With continuous authentication, also called active 
authentication, the behavior of a user during an authenticated 
session is monitored to determine if the authenticated user is 
still the one using the session. 
While advanced authentication techniques like multi-
factor authentication and continuous authentication are 
known for human users, it seems that these technologies 
have not yet been applied for device authentication. 
With ubiquitous machine-oriented communication, e.g., 
the Internet of Things and interconnected cyber physical 
systems, devices have to be authenticated in a secure way. 
This paper presents and investigates approaches for 
advanced device authentication. 
After describing single device authentication means in 
Section II, the combination of authentications is covered in 
Section 
III. 
The 
advantages 
of 
enhanced 
device 
authentication factors to increase the security level of 
Internet of Things systems and Cyber Physical Systems is 
investigated in Section IV. Section V summarizes related 
work. Section VI concludes with a summary and an outlook. 
Note that the paper investigates different options for 
providing enhance authentication from a conceptual point of 
view. The options are discussed in the context of system 
design and require an implementation as the consequent next 
step. 
II. 
DEVICE AUTHENTICATION MEANS 
As for users, authentication of a device can be based on 
different authentication factors, similar to user authentication 
means [8]: 
 
Something the device knows: credential (device key, 
e.g., a secret key or a private key)  
 
Something the device has (integrated authentication 
IC, authentication dongle) 
 
Something the device is (logical properties, e.g., the 
device type, configuration data, firmware version; 
physical properties: physical unclonable function 
(PUF), radio fingerprint)  
Besides these well-established authentication factors, 
more unconventional authentication factors can also be used: 
 
Something the device does (behavior, functionality, 
e.g., automation control protocol) 
 
Something the device knows about its environment 
(sensors) 
 
Something the device can (functional capability, 
actuators)

The context of the device (neighbors, location, 
connected periphery) 
Different 
usages 
in 
IoT 
systems 
apply 
device 
authentication: 
 
Identity Authentication toward a remote system 
(access control, communication security). May be a 
supervisory system, or a peer device. 
 
Network access security (IEEE 802.1X [3], mobile 
network access authentication [4]). 
 
Original device authentication 
 
Attestation of device integrity 
 
Attestation of device configuration 
The remainder of this section provides an overview about 
device authentication means. The authentication would 
typically be performed by an authentication server that, after 
successful authentication, may allow access to further system 
specific data directly or issues a temporal token (e.g., SAML 
assertion [5], OAUTH token [6], short-term X.509 certificate 
[7]).  
A. Cryptographic Device Authentication 
The authentication of a device allows a reliable 
identification. For authentication, a challenge value is sent to 
the object to be authenticated. This object calculates a 
corresponding response value, which is returned to the 
requestor and verified. The response can be calculated using 
a cryptographic authentication mechanism, or by using a 
PUF [1].  
For cryptographic authentication, different mechanisms 
may be used. Examples are keyed hash functions like 
HMAC-SHA256 or symmetric ciphers in cipher block 
chaining (CBC-MAC) mode, or symmetric ciphers in Galois 
counter mode (GMAC) up to digital signatures. For the 
symmetric ciphers, AES would be a suitable candidate. 
Common to keyed hashes or symmetric key based 
cryptographic authentication approaches is the existence of a 
specific secret or private key, which is only available to the 
object to be authenticated and the verifier. One resulting 
requirement from this fact is obviously the need for robust 
protection of the applied secret key. Also, asymmetric 
cryptography can be used for component authentication. A 
suitable procedure based on elliptic curves has been 
described in [24]. Also in this use case, the secret key has to 
be protected on the authenticating component.  
The device is authenticated as only an original device can 
determine the correct response value corresponding to a 
given challenge. The verifier sends a random challenge to the 
component that determines and sends back the corresponding 
response. The verifier checks the response. Depending on the 
result, the component is accepted as genuine/authenticated or 
it is rejected.  
Various 
approaches 
are 
available 
to 
realize 
a 
cryptographic device authentication: 
 
Software credential: Credentials are hidden in 
software, configuration information, or the system 
registry. Be aware that practices of storing 
cryptographic credentials in firmware or cleartext 
configurations 
are 
weak 
[11][12]. 
However, 
techniques for whitebox cryptography are available 
that hide keys in software [13].  
 
Central processing unit (CPU) and microcontroller 
integrated circuits (IC) with internal key store: Some 
modern CPUs resp. microcontrollers include battery-
backed SRAM or non-volatile memory, e.g., security 
fuses, that can be used to store cryptographic keys on 
the IC [14]. Also, an internal hardware security 
module (HSM) or secure execution environment can 
be included (e.g., Infineon Aurix with integrated 
HSM [15], or ARM TrustZone [16]). 
 
Separate authentication ICs can be integrated (e.g., 
Atmel CryptoAuthentication ECC508A [17] , 
Infineon Optiga Trust E [18]).  
 
Crypto controller (e.g., Infineon SLE97 [19]). 
 
Trusted platform module (TPM 1.2 [20], TPM 2.0 
[21], TPM automotive thin profile [34]). 
B. Device Authentication based on Device Properties 
Physical and logical properties of a device can be verified 
as part of a device authentication. For this purpose, 
information about the device properties can be provided in a 
cryptographically protected way. In particular, an attestation, 
a digitally signed information confirming properties of a 
device, can be created by a protected component of the 
device.  
Properties of the device can be logical information 
(software version, device configuration, serial number of 
components of the device) or physical properties of the 
device that can be determined by sensors or a PUF [9].

properties
 
Figure 1. Challenge-Response-PUF 
Fig. 1 shows the basic concept of a PUF [1]. A PUF 
performs a computation to determine a response value 
depending on a given challenge value. Intrinsic device 
properties influence the PUF calculation so that the 
calculation of the response is different on different devices, 
but reproducible – with some bit errors – on the same device.  
A PUF is used here for device authentication in a 
different way: It is by itself not a strong authentication. 
Instead, a cryptographically protected attestation can be used 
to attest physical properties of a device that are measured 
using a PUF. So, a PUF is not used directly for 
authentication, but indirectly as integrated device sensor to 
measure physical properties of the device. It can be 
considered as a “two-factor device authentication” where the 
PUF is used as second authentication factor.

C. Authentication based on Device Context and Monitoring 
Information 
Information about the context of a device can be used, 
e.g., the device location, or information about the 
environment of neighbor devices, the network reachability 
under a certain network address, or over a certain 
communication path. 
The device context is determined and checked. The 
context information can be provided by the device itself, or 
the device’s context information can be requested from a 
context server. One example from industrial environments is 
the system and device engineering, which basically provides 
information about the type and functionality of connected 
devices. Hence, it can be used to retrieve information about 
the devices deployment environment. The device location 
can be obtained using known localization technologies, e.g., 
global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) as GPS, 
GALILEO, BEIDOU, GLONASS, or localization using base 
stations (WLAN, cellular, broadcast) and beacons [22].  
Furthermore, the device operation can be monitored: The 
behavior of the main, regular functionality of the device can 
be monitored and checked for plausibility.  
 
 
Figure 2. Validation of Device Monitoring Data  
Fig. 2 shows an example for an IoT system with IoT 
devices (ID1, ID2, etc.) that communicate with an IoT 
backend platform. The devices provide current monitoring 
information about their status, measurements, etc. to the 
backend platform (e.g., for predictive maintenance). The 
backend platform maintains the data for the IoT devices (ID1 
SD, ID2 SD, etc.) as IoT device supervisory data (“digital 
twin”). 
Furthermore, 
context 
information 
about 
the 
environment of a device can be provided by the device itself 
using its sensors, or by neighboring devices.  
The devices authenticate, e.g., using a device certificate, 
towards a device security service that maintains information 
about registered devices and their permissions. Furthermore, 
the device security service can issue and revoke device 
credentials (e.g., device certificate, authentication tokens).  
In addition, a device data validation service can ensure 
that the device operation can be monitored, supporting also a 
continuous verification of the devices purpose. The 
validation service requests information about the IoT device 
supervisory data of supervised devices and checks it for 
validity using a configurable validation policy. Hence, the 
behavior of the main, regular functionality of the device can 
be monitored and checked for plausibility. Additionally, 
some arbitrary dummy functionality can be realized for 
monitoring purposes (e.g., predictable, pseudo-random 
virtual sensor measurement). 
If a policy violation is detected, a corrective action is 
triggered: provide alarm message for display on a dash board 
(the alarm message can be injected in the device supervisory 
data set of the affected device maintained by the IoT backend 
platform). Furthermore, an alarm message can be sent to the 
IoT backend platform to terminate the communication 
session of the affected IoT device. Moreover, the device 
security service can be informed so that it can revoke the 
devices 
access 
permissions, 
or 
revoke 
the 
device 
authentication credential. 
D. Authentication based on Device Capability 
The authenticity of a control device can be verified by 
checking that a device can in fact perform a certain 
operation. The device is given an instruction to perform a 
certain test operation. It is checked that the device can 
perform a certain computation on provided test data: The 
device is given a set of input parameters (test data) and has to 
provide the correct result that is a valid result of the 
computation. The computational function could be a 
cryptographic puzzle involving a secret. The functionality 
can be realized by software/firmware on the control device, 
by a programmable hardware (FPGA), or by a periphery 
device (e.g., separate signal processor or IO device). 
Furthermore, it can be verified that a device can act on the 
expected physical environment (proofing that it has control 
on a certain effect in the physical world). The effect is 
observed by a separate sensor device. In an embodiment, the 
separate sensor device may provide an assertion.

Fig. 3 shows a possible message exchange. The 
functional 
capability 
check 
is 
performed 
over 
a 
cryptographically authenticated communication link (e.g., 
transport layer security (TLS) protocol [25]). A device 
passes the authentication if both its cryptographic 
authentication is valid and its functional operation (FO) is 
verified successfully. For a successful attack, where a fake 
device is to be accepted, it is not sufficient that the attacker 
has access to the used cryptographic key. In addition, the 
attacker has to realize the expected functionality of the real 
device. 
An example for combining authentication and the 
property to control a specific environment can be given by 
the recently established letsencrypt [38] infrastructure. Here, 
a (web)server applies for an X.509 certificate to be used for 
authentication in the context of https connections made to the 
web server. The certificate will be issued once the server can 
prove that it controls the domain it is requesting a certificate 
for. The proof is provided by putting dedicated information 
onto a random address in the applying servers address space. 
If this information can be retrieved externally, the proof of 
control is provided.  
III. 
COMBINED DEVICE AUTHENTICATIONS 
This section describes various advanced options for 
device authentication where multiple device authentications 
are combined.  
A. Multi-Factor Device Authentication  
A 
device 
can 
support 
multiple 
independent 
authentications. These authentication options may be 
performed iteratively.  
In 
particular, 
an 
initial 
cryptographic 
device 
authentication can be used to setup an authenticated 
communication session with an authentication server. 
Additional checks can be performed to complete the device 
authentication, e.g., in the scope of a specific application.  
B. Separate Re-authentication Connection 
In communication security, a secure session is 
established by an authentication and key agreement protocol 
(e.g., IKEv2, TLS authentication and key agreement). The 
authentication 
is 
typically 
performed 
for 
each 
communication session.  
It is proposed that a single device has to set-up multiple 
authenticated communication sessions. The device has to re-
authenticate regularly towards a backend system respectively 
a separate authentication server using a first communication 
session. If this is not done, the second communication 
session is terminated or blocked by the backend system. This 
realizes a form of continuous device authentication where a 
device 
is 
continuously 
re-authenticated 
during 
a 
communication session, but without degrading the main 
communication link for which delays and interruptions shall 
be avoided.  
The second communication session can be used for real-
time / delay sensitive control traffic. The communication 
session will often be established for a long time (e.g., 
months). The re-authentication of the device can be 
performed independently using a second communication 
session without interfering with the second communication 
session (interruptions, delays during re-authentication). Note 
that the different communication sessions may terminate at 
different points in the backend systems. Hence, besides the 
multiple authentication sessions from the device, there needs 
to by a synchronization of the authentication sessions in the 
backend. 
Also, the re-authentication of the first connection may be 
used to create a dynamic cryptographic binding with a 
further (separate) security session. This property can be used, 
to ensure that the entities involved in a separate security 
session know, that there is a persistent first session with 
either the same entity or a different entity. This approach 
may be used for instance in publish/subscribe use cases to 
ensure, that there is a persistent connection with the 
publish/subscribe server, while actually having an end-to-end 
communication session between the clients. 
C. System Authentication 
In industrial control systems and the Internet of Things, 
often a set of field devices will be used to realize a system. It 
is proposed to check the authentication of a set of devices 
(system authentication) that have to authenticate towards a 
backend system. A single device is accepted as authenticated 
only as long as a defined set of associated devices, forming 
the system, authenticates as well (with plausible context of 
the devices, e.g., network connectivity, location). The 
devices may have a different criticality assigned to enable a 
distinction between necessary and optional devices.  
The communication link of a device (as member of a 
group) is set to an active state (permission to send/receive 
data) only if all required devices of the group have 
authenticated successfully. Thereby, an attacker cannot 
perform a successful attack by setting up only a single fake 
device. A single device is accepted as authenticated only as 
long as a defined set of associated devices authenticates as 
well (with plausible context, e.g., network connectivity, 
location). 
IV. 
EVALUATION 
The security of a cyber system can be evaluated in 
practice in various approaches and stages of the system’s 
lifecycle: 
 
Threat and risk analysis (TRA) of cyber system 
 
Checks 
during 
operation 
to 
determine 
key 
performance indicators (e.g., check for compliance 
of device configurations). 
 
Security testing (penetration testing) 
During the design phase of a cyber system, the security 
demand is determined, and the appropriateness of a security 
design is validated using a threat and risk analysis. Assets to 
be protected and possible threats are identified, and the risk 
is evaluated in a qualitative way depending on probability 
and impact of threats. The effectiveness of the proposed 
enhanced device authentication means can be reflected in a 
system TRA. The proposed enhancements to simple 
cryptographic device authentication can lead to a reduction

of the probability and/or the impact of a threat, so that the 
overall risk for successful attacks is reduced.  
Two exemplary threats affecting a device are given 
(using for this example a simple qualitative assessment 
metric of low/medium/high): 
 
An attacker obtains device authentication credential 
by attacking the authentication protocol (probability: 
medium, impact: high; risk: high). 
 
An 
attacker 
succeeds 
in 
exploiting 
an 
implementation vulnerability of a device to get root 
access to the device and manipulate the device 
functionality (probability: high, impact: high; risk: 
high). 
With selected additional protection measures, the risk can 
be reduced to an acceptable level: A device authentication 
credential cannot be used by an attacker for a successful 
attack as the device credential alone does not allow for a 
successful device authentication. With functional verification 
of device capability, a manipulated device can be detected. 
For a successful attack, the attacker would have to ensure 
continuously the correct operation of the device as verified 
by the capability check, which increases the effort for the 
attacker. While in real-world attack models, it is never 
possible to prevent all attacks, the presented countermeasures 
help to increase the required effort for a successful, 
undetected attack.

RELATED WORK 
Authentication within the Internet of Things is an active 
area of research and development. Gupta described multi-
factor authentication of users towards IoT devices [29]. The 
Cloud Security Alliance published recommendations on 
identity and access management within the IoT [30]. Ajit and 
Sunil describe challenged to IoT security and solution 
options. Authentication systems for IoT where analyzed by 
Borgohain, Borgohain, Kumar and Sanyal [32].  
Al Ibrahim and Nair have combined multiple PUF 
elements into a combined system PUF [33].  
An “automotive thin profile” of the Trusted Platform 
Module TPM 2.0 has been specified [34]. A vehicle is 
composed of multiple control units that are equipped with 
TPMs. A rich TPM manages a set of thin TPMs, so that the 
vehicle can be represented by a vehicle TPM to the external 
world.  
For electric vehicle charging, a vehicle authentication 
scheme has been described by Chan and Zhou that involves 
two 
authentication 
challenges, 
sent 
over 
different 
communication links (wireless link, charging cable) to the 
electric vehicle. 
Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) as 
SAMHAIN [36] and OSSEC [37] analyze the integrity of 
hosts and report the results to a backend security monitoring 
system. 
Continuous user authentication, i.e., the checking during 
a session whether the user is still the same as the 
authenticated one, has been described by [26] and [27].  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Robust and practical device authentication is an essential 
security feature for cyber physical systems and the Internet 
of Things. The security design principle of “defense in 
depth” basically means that multiple layers of defenses are 
designed. This design principle can not only be applied at the 
system level, but also at the level of a single security 
mechanism.  
This paper proposed advanced device authentication 
means to increase the attack robustness of device 
authentication. 
A 
well-known 
cryptographic 
device 
authentication can be extended with additional validations to 
check the device identity. The paper described how ideas 
from advanced human user authentication like multi-factor 
authentication and continuous authentication can be applied 
to device authentication. 
The consequent next step addresses the integration of a 
selection of enhanced authentication means as proof of 
concept to verify the concept as such and also the supremacy 
in comparison with single authentication schemes.
