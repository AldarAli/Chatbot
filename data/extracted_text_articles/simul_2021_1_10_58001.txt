INTRODUCTION 
 There is high variability in obstetrics performance within 
the 
United 
States, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
egregious 
underperformance of the US against developed countries 
and of developing countries against developed countries, all 
of which suggest that the current approach to obstetrics 
training could be improved. Specifically, Glance et al found 
that 13 percent of the four million US women giving birth 
annually experience one or more major complications [1]; 
they used multivariable logistic regression to assess the 
variation in obstetric complication outcomes across US 
hospitals (based on 750,000+ deliveries) and found an 
alarming disparity between high and low-performing 
hospitals. Lower-graded hospitals had complication rates  
double those of better hospitals in vaginal deliveries, at 
22.55% and 10.42%   respectively, as well as five times 
those of better hospitals in cesarian deliveries: 20.93% vs. 
4.37%. In addition, a comparison study found the US to be  
the worst-performing in maternal mortality in a group of 11 
developed countries [2]: in 2018, there were 17 maternal 
deaths for every 100,000 births in the US, a ratio more than 
double that of most other high-income countries [2]. 
Furthermore, 
obstetric 
complications 
in
developing 
countries are also distressing, with 530,000 women 
worldwide dying annually and 95% of these deaths 
occurring in Africa and Asia [3]. 
An important risk factor in labor is shoulder dystocia, 
depicted in Figure 1, a difficulty in the delivery of the fetal 
shoulders after delivery of the head. Shoulder dystocia is 
characterized by approximate incidences of 1% for babies 
under 4 kg [4][5], 5% for babies between 4 and 4.5 kg, and 
10% for babies heavier than 4.5 kg [5] respectively. 
Neonatal complications include death and cerebral palsy due 
to loss of oxygen to the baby's brain, from the dystocia 
itself, and brachial plexus injury complications such as 
Klumpke’s paralysis and Erb's palsy caused by the action of 
the obstetrician. Maternal complications include vaginal and 
cervical lacerations as well as post-partum hemorrhage [6].  
The current emphasis in simulation-based obstetrics training 
is on mannequins [7][8], as seen in Figure 2. These trainers 
are limited by the paucity of clinically relevant complication

models, their inextensibility to specific patients, and 
prohibitive costs precluding third world applications. A 
seasoned obstetrician confronted with shoulder dystocia can 
draw from a set of appropriate corrective procedure such as 
the McRoberts maneuver, suprapubic pressure, delivery of 
the posterior arm, and a corkscrew maneuver, just to name 
four. Mannequins often enable only one correct procedure 
that can be invoked, which restricts the instruction. In 
contrast, 
VR 
simulation 
flexibly 
accommodates 
an 
inventory of solutions, predictive of the expert’s approach. 
The consideration of competing treatment options is readily 
supported in a suitable VR setting; it is infeasible on a 
mannequin. VR simulation can be personalized by warping 
multi-surface anatomies to a fetal medical image, enabling 
practice on a patient of particular interest. One can 
retroactively warp a set of fetal and maternal anatomies to 
MRI datasets associated with complications [9], accounting 
for risk factors like maternal obesity and twin or premature 
pregnancies, systematically preparing obstetricians for  
worse-case scenarios. Fast-forwarding a few years, this 
project could potentiate midwives worldwide, namely in 
developing countries, through a suite of complication-
embedding patient-specific simulations running on a tablet 
or cellphone, and personalized simulation of their patient of 
interest, imaged with a portable ultrasound scanner [11], 
feasible via Anatomy Transfer (AT) [12].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A.  Building on Medical Ontologies and on a Descriptive 
Offline Birthing Simulation 
This paper will sketch a high-level picture of the nascent 
project and preliminary design objectives, while also 
alluding to resources available either through project 
members or open-source tools. The starting point for this 
planned interactive simulation is the work of Parente, Natal 
Jorge et al., [13], the offline birthing simulation represented 
in Figure 3, along with the biomechanical finite elements 
simulation of the maternal pelvic floor, during a simulated 
birth. The main components of the simulation are intended 
with practical clinical requirements in mind. In general, we 
advocate designing a medical simulation based on rigorous 
constraints founded on medical ontologies [14], which 
describe the intervention of the physician in terms of a 
sequence of discrete steps, within an algorithmic workflow. 
To this end, it is useful to exploit as a starting point a typical  
Figure 3. Prior results of Parente, Natal Jorge et al. [13] demonstrating 
birthing simulation under occipito-anterior neonate position and the 
biomechanical impact of these scenarios as pelvic floor stresses.   
workflow that governs the actions of an obstetrician 
confronted with a shoulder dystocia case. In general, to 
make the simulator extensible in the future as well as 
representative of other complications, such as perinatal 
asphyxia uterine rupture, or excessive bleeding, this 
ontological workflow has to embed the typical response, 
such as found in a textbook or paper, to common 
complications. As shoulder dystocia is concerned, the 
workflow depicted in Figure 4 is considered typical [15] and 
can serve as a basis for our clinical requirements. In 
particular, the clinical response emphasizes the gradual 
application of maneuvers of increasing severity from the 
repositioning of the mother and suprapubic pressure, to the 
Corkscrew Maneuver, to Posterior Arm Delivery, to the 
Zavelli Maneuver and cesarean delivery, just to mention 
these few. The decision to transition to the next option, 
more drastic than the current technique, depends on the 
response of the fetus, as to whether or not it advances 
successfully. The implication of such a flexible, responsive 
approach on the part of the expert obstetrician, as a desirable 
training outcome, argues in favor of a VR-based interactive 
simulation, given the relative inflexibility of mannequin-

based training, which tends to emphasize a single solution 
or maneuver. Our expert clinician (AA) argues that the 
Posterior Arm Delivery and corkscrew maneuvers must be 
emphasized in particular by the simulation.  
B. Preliminary Work in Predictive Simulation 
In the prior work of Parente, Natal Jorge et al., [13][16], the 
fetus was considered has having a high stiffness, being 
controlled trough the usage of four control points. The fetus 
movements were optimized and defined in order to present 
the birth canal, the smallest possible fetus head diameter. 
After this manual optimization process, the final childbirth 
simulation was obtained, which included the deformation of 
the pelvic floor muscles. For these muscles a hyperelastic, 
transversely isotropic, constitutive model was used, which 
included the muscles fibers. Therefore, although being an 
advancement in term of childbirth simulation, this initial 
work contained several limitations and shortcomings, that 
we intend to improve upon.

as ontological basis for the simulation. 
C. Overview of Design Approach and High-level Features 
One of the immediate implications of the clinical 
requirements alluded to above is that the anatomical model 
of the fetus used in the VR simulation must be as faithful as 
possible to the biomechanics of the live neonate, in manner 
consistent with a real-time application, in order to enable 
some of the maneuvers encoded in this ontological 
workflow depicted in Figure 4. In particular, while the finite 
elements-based 
birthing 
simulation 
of 
Parente 
[13] 
corresponds to the state-of-the-art so far, despite a simple 
four-segment fetal model with folded arms as in Figure 3b, 
the interactive obstetrics simulator underway must have a 
fetus with fully animated limbs, especially biomechanically 
faithful arms, to enable training on the Posterior Arm 
Delivery. If the ObGyn resident were to reach for the 
posterior arm and manage to grip it, the arm must be 
movable and responsive to the intended maneuver. The 
anatomy of the fetus must also realistically respond to being 
nudged outward by the arm. As a result, it is apparent that 
one of the cornerstones of the simulator must consist of a 
dynamic piecewise-rigid simulation of the skeleton, in the 
style of Stanford University’s OpenSim [18], with a haptic 
response provided by a pair of gloves such as Haptx [19].  
Moreover, the original simulation of Parente took 
several hours to run [16], while we must strive to use every 
efficiency possible in order to achieve a real-time response, 
i.e. at least several times a second, with interpolative tricks 
to maintain visual and haptic feedback at suitable rates 
(30Hz,  200 Hz). This real-time requirement leads to several  
Figure 5. Main design features. From top to bottom: 1) patient-specific 
anatomical modeling, via Ziva Dynamics Anatomy Transfer, emphasizing 
a whole-body fetal model and a portion of the maternal anatomy; 2) 
haptics-driven fetal skeletal dynamics based on OpenSim [17]; 3) Deep 
Learning-based simulation of soft-tissue biomechanics based on IMSTK; 
4) bimanual haptics via Haptx gloves.   
important design choices, which are made explicit in Figure 
5, which describes the high-level architecture and design 
features. First, this real-time consideration justifies a highly 
efficient approach to skeletal mechanics of the fetus, based 
on OpenSim [18]. One of the main challenges to this project 
will be to integrate OpenSim musculoskeletal simulation 
with haptics, even simple 6 degree-of-freedom haptics, to 
which end we will first integrate OpenSim with a real-time 
biomechanics simulation platform that also supports haptics: 
the Interactive Medical Simulation Toolkit (IMSTK) [20]. 
Second, and perhaps more critical given the likely soft-

tissue bottleneck, real-time constraints presuppose that we 
adopt the fastest soft-tissue simulation techniques available, 
in conjunction with IMSTK, without which this project 
would be an exercise in futility. To this end, we will be 
exploiting a Deep Learning approach to soft tissue finite 
elements analysis, in the manner pioneered by Mendizabal, 
Cotin et al recently [21], which runs on a comparable real-
time biomechanics platform SOFA. They were able to 
demonstrate two orders of magnitude acceleration over 
comparable finite elements engines: a volumetric beam 
simulation that would typically iterate at 0.5 second on 
SOFA ran at roughly at 4 ms based on Mendizabal’s deep 
neural network implementation. While the SOFA deep 
learning FE synthesis is not yet available in open source, 
there are several DL-based finite elements simulation 
implementations available on GitHub, which could serve as 
a template for IMSTK’s DL approach to finite elements 
analysis, whose implementation details are also published, 
such as Ononenko’s MLFEM in 3D [22][23] and Xu’s  
Figure 6. High-level approach to personalized anatomy computation: 
beginning with a fetal MRI volume, segment the fetal sac and the fetus, 
using a DL approach, trained with a deformable surface model [27] 
[28], use Anatomy Transfer to identify the fetus’ skin surface, register 
bones in a piecewise-affine manner, warp soft tissues to the layer 
between bone and skin, and proceed likewise with maternal anatomy 
visible in the MRI. 
NNFEM in 2D [24][25]. Briefly, the Mendizabal method, 
termed U-Mesh, and the competing techniques also cited 
here all apply a U-Net architecture [26] to estimating 
deformations from a mesh coinciding with the elastic solid 
of interest, based on training achieved by finite elements 
simulations. The original U-Mesh is a parameterized 
function that accepts a {3 x nx x ny x nz} force tensor f as 
input and produces a displacement tensor u of the same size 
as output. Training data for U-Mesh are generated by 
solving a discretized boundary value problem (BVP) with 
the FE method. U-Mesh computations ran over 100 times 
faster than comparable FE simulations also designed for 
interactive processing, typically under 0.01 seconds, with 
graphical processor unit hardware [21]. The difference with 
this application, compared to any other DL elastic response 
simulation that preceded it, is that the fetal soft-tissue 
“envelope” must track the piecewise-rigid motion of the 
limbs: the estimation of the elastic tissue response would be 
intractable without first modeling the skeletal piecewise-
rigid transform, which justifies the use of OpenSim. Ideally 
a detailed representation of muscles of the fetus and their 
activation should serve as the basis for the DL training. 
However, it may in fact be computationally onerous to 
model every muscle in such a detailed manner; an alternate 
solution may lie in an anatomically terse soft tissue layer, 
based on thick shell elements, which wraps over the bone 
scaffold and tracks the motion of the skeleton, in a manner 
first proposed by Parente.  
D. Anatomical modeling and musculoskeletal simulation 
A detailed approach to modeling the musculoskeletal 
anatomy and its corresponding function could involve the 
warping of a descriptive model of the human body and 
associating the activation of each muscle with a tensing or 
flexing of that muscle, as implemented respectively with 
Ziva Dynamics’ Anatomy Transfer technique, as depicted in 
Figures 6 and 7, and Muscle Firing simulation [29]. Our plan 
is to purchase an anatomist-drawn musculoskeletal model of 
a baby, from a digital content company such as TurboSquid 
or CGHero [30][31]. The first author has prior contacts with 
CGHero in particular, such as a ligamentoskeletal model of 
the spine and torso, which is being warped to target CT 
images for scoliosis surgery planning [32][33]. A naïve but 
more quickly computed soft-tissue representation would 
simply involve a simple soft-tissue layer covering the 
skeleton, whose thickness would vary anatomically: thin at 
the hands and feet, slightly thicker in the rest of the limbs 
and head, thickness around the torso. Such an approach 
could be computed as a distance map from the MRI-derived 
bone anatomy of the fetus and modeled with a collection of 
thick shell elements. IMSTK would produce the initial 
simulations that would serve to train the DL-based finite 
elements synthesis.   
In addition to the above strategy for modeling the 
dynamics of the bones and soft tissue, the actual 
personalization of the fetal model will require some form of 
Anatomy Transfer (AT) technique, based on the original AT 
pioneered by Dicko et al., [12], and implemented by Ziva 
Dynamics, as shown in Figure 7.    
The AT technique  consists of an image analysis 
pipeline that uses as inputs a multi-surface musculoskeletal 
atlas and a putative skin surface of the subject, erodes the 
contained volume to model a fat layer, then applies a 
piecewise-affine registration followed by a relatively stiff 
elastic  transformation to map a skeletal model within that 
inner layer, followed by an adjustment of the bone model 
based on a constrained, shape-preserving constrained 
registration and a final soft-tissue interpolation to scale and 
position the soft-tissue (muscle) layer within the fat layer.

This technique will be refined further over time based on 
two research tangents: i) accuracy improvements based on 
multi-surface deformable models developed by the author, 
which will imbed shape and pose statistics derived from 
fetal MRI and expert correction, and ii) surface mesh-based 
neural network-mediated automation, founded on a platform 
such as MeshCNN [35], which will obviate user supervision 
for the AT approach. 
E. OpenSim-based Musculoskeletal Simulation 
 Stanford’s OpenSim is the leading open-source dynamic 
musculoskeletal simulation platform (Figure 8). An 
OpenSim 
Model 
is 
a 
codified 
description 
of 
a 
musculoskeletal system and its dynamics, and represents a 
topological graph of interconnected components [36]. Each 
component represents a self-contained module (biological 
structure, mechatronic device, etc.) comprising the Model, 
and contributes to building the computational system. The 
computational system consists of two parts: (1) the system 
of equations (“System”), which includes constant physical

image analysis pipeline, adapted by the first author from Dicko [12]. (b)

parameters (mass, dimensions, etc.); and (2) the State, 
which includes all variables in the System that vary over 
time (e.g. joint angles). The developer designs an OpenSim 
Model that represents the physical system; OpenSim 
constructs the computational system of differential and 
algebraic equations that describe Model dynamics. This 
infrastructure will enable us to simulate the piecewise-rigid 
motion of the fetal and maternal skeletons, which will then 
determine deformations undergone by their respective soft 
tissues.   
F. Virtual Reality-based Viewing and Bimanual Kinematics 
Integration with Leap Motion  
Virtual Reality-based viewing and integration with 
bimanual kinematics tracking based on Leap Motion were 
recently proposed in a thesis at University of Porto (M.P). 
This VR application leverages the generic anatomy of the 
mother’s pelvis and the fetal anatomy developed by Parente, 
Natal Jorge and their collaborators. It is described next. 
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The current VR application emphasizes surface rendering of 
the boundaries of the fetal and maternal finite elements 
model, based on a series of multi-surface snapshots, or static 
visualization models, obtained from the finite elements 
volumetric simulation, in conjunction with the Unity engine 
and a suitable colormap for visualizing biomechanical

recently developed a template for our future bimanual 
simulation, based on Leap Motion tracking of the users 
hands, as shown in Figure 9 [38][39]. Obviously, the 
LeapMotion only keys on kinematics but does not imbed 
force feedback, which will be a requirement that is provided 
by the Haptx gloves, which will be supported in our final 
implementation [38]. IMSTK supports Unity-based 3D 
graphics as well as a variety of haptic devices [20].

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This paper centered on the nascent development of an 
interactive, patient-specific obstetrics simulator, based on 
substantial clinical justification. The foundation of this effort 
is the work of the Porto-based senior author’s on predictive 
birthing simulation, featuring generic models of the fetus and 
of the mother. A second cornerstone that now makes this 
project feasible is the advent of deep learning-based 
approaches to simulating biomechanical finite elements, 
some of which is publicly available on GitHub. In addition, 
leveraging leading simulation toolkits, namely IMSTK and 
OpenSim, also is essential to achieving success. The bulk of 
the future work will center on the challenge of this 
integration between skeletal motion and soft-tissue layers 
surrounding this motion. Lastly, the application of a medical 
image analysis pipeline for personalizing these anatomical 
models, including the use of Ziva Dynamics’ Anatomy 
Transfer software, as well as tools like SLICER and Insight 
Toolkit for medical image analysis, is also essential to 
achieving clinical relevance. The advantage of proceeding 
this way, while determining the requirements of the 
simulation based on medical ontologies, is that worst-case 
scenarios can be effectively synthesized, by artificially 
worsening cases of shoulder dystocia (increasing the size of 
the fetus’ head for example) or making the umbilical cord 
take an inopportune path.  Downstream of this simulation 
implementation, it will also be feasible to exploit portable 
ultrasound scanners, while potentiating the work of 
midwives in countries with limited access to obstetricians.
