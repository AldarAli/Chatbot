Abstract—In IEEE 802.16j networks, radio wave interference
between wireless links must be taken into account when radio
resources are assigned to network links. The protocol model,
which deﬁnes the transmission and interference ranges as
circles, is well-known as one of the major radio interference
models. Although a lot of related studies on IEEE 802.16j
networks use the protocol model, they do not consider the
presence of obstacles. In this paper, we ﬁrst investigate the
performance of IEEE 802.16j networks considering the effect
of obstacles. For that purpose, we deﬁne an obstacle model
and extended protocol model for accommodating obstacles,
where radio waves propagation is obstructed by obstacles.
Next, the performance of IEEE 802.16j networks is evaluated
through simulation experiments using the obstacle model and
the extended protocol model. Additionally, we present a method
for estimating the performance of IEEE 802.16j networks
with obstacles. Then, we use multiple regression analysis
based on simulation results and construct regression equations
for network service ratio and power-to-throughput ratio. By
evaluating the accuracy of the developed equations based on
real-world environment, we conﬁrm that the service ratio
can be estimated with a high degree of accuracy when the
distribution density of obstacle is small.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid progress of networking technologies, the
demands for broadband access network environment is
growing at various places such as home, ofﬁce, and public
areas. Wireless communication technologies are important
to accommodate such services and users’ demands. IEEE
802.16j [1][2] has attracted much attention to satisfy such
demands, providing wider-area broadband wireless access
environment. The IEEE 802.16j protocol utilizes multi-hop
wireless networks for extending the network service area
[3][4][5].
Generally, IEEE 802.16j wireless multi-hop relay net-
works (hereinafter, relay networks) consist of two types
of nodes: gateway and relay nodes. As shown in Figure
1, there is a wired connection between the gateway node
and an external network, while relay nodes communicate

with the gateway node through wireless links. These nodes
construct a tree topology where the root is the gateway
node and there is a wireless multi-hop transmission path
from any relay node to the gateway node [6][7][8]. A client
terminal can access the external network by connecting to
one of these nodes whose service area covers the client
terminal [9]. One advantage of relay networks is that it
is possible to extend the network service area by adding
relay nodes without additional wired network facilities. In
other words, the relay networks can provide wireless access
environment by using multi-hop relaying to the area to
which the radio waves cannot be directly reached from the
gateway node. Therefore, the relay network is considered
as possible networking technologies especially for thinly-
populated regions and the area where the radio wave of
gateway node is hard to reach due to underground and shades
of buildings.
In relay networks, obstacles, which refer in this paper to
physical objects such as residential, ofﬁce and commercial
buildings, largely affect the connectivity between relay nodes
and radio wave interference among wireless links. For
example, even when two nodes exist in the transmission

range of each other, the obstacles can prevent the nodes
from communicating with each other. Furthermore, obstacles
can reduce the size of the service area. On the other
hand, the obstacles can increase network performance by
reducing the occurrence of radio wave interference since
the interference range is limited by the obstacles. Therefore,
since the obstacles have both advantage and disadvantage
on the network performance, it is important to consider
the presence of obstacles and their inﬂuence on radio wave
propagation for assessing the network performance.
In wireless networks, there is a general problem related
to radio wave interference. Speciﬁcally, multiple nodes
that exist in the interference range of each other cannot
successfully transmit the radio waves at the same time
[10][11]. To avoid this problem, relay networks use an
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
protocol [12], which gives radio resources to network links
as transmission opportunities [13]. Previous studies on relay
networks have focused on preventing radio wave interference
by introducing concepts such as link scheduling [14][15][16]
and power control [17][18][19].
The protocol model [20], which deﬁnes the transmission
and interference ranges as circles, is well-known as one of
the major radio interference models. In the protocol model,
whether a transmission succeeds or encounters interference
depends on only the distance between nodes, which are
obtained through comparison with the transmission and
interference ranges of other nodes. Therefore, the connec-
tivity between relay nodes and radio wave interference
among network links can be easily determined. Although
a lot of studies on relay networks use the protocol model
[21][22][23][24][25], they did not consider the presence of
obstacles.
In this paper, extending the paper [1], we investigate
the performance of IEEE 802.16j networks considering the
effect of obstacles. First, we deﬁne an obstacle model which
determines location and size of obstacle in the network.
Then, we extend the function of the protocol model for
accommodating obstacles. Speciﬁcally, radio waves propa-
gation is obstructed by the obstacles in the extended protocol
model. Next, we consider both positive and negative aspects
for the relay network due to radio wave obstruction. Using
the obstacle model and the extended protocol model, the per-
formance of relay networks is evaluated through simulation
experiments in terms of network service ratio and power-to-
throughput ratio.
Furthermore, we propose a method for estimating the
performance of relay networks. In the network construction
process, it is helpful to estimate the network performance
before the network is actually constructed. For example,
the performance estimation enables the number of nodes
deployed in the network or the transmission range of the
nodes to be adjusted in order to achieve pre-determined
performance goals such as service ratio, network throughput,

and power consumption. For this purpose, by using multiple
regression (polynomial regression) analysis of numerical
results of simulation experiments, the regression equations
are derived to estimate the performance of relay networks.
We conﬁrm the effectiveness of the estimation method by
evaluating the accuracy of regression equations. Speciﬁcally,
we conduct simulation experiments based on the real-world
environment to assess the estimation accuracy of the pro-
posed method.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we introduce the network model of the relay networks.
Section III introduces the obstacle model and the extended
protocol model. The simulation results based on the pro-
posed models are given in Section IV. Then in Section V,
we present a method for estimating the performance of relay
networks and evaluate the effectiveness of method. Finally,
Section VI concludes this paper and describes future work.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
This section describes the network model, the radio inter-
ference model, and time slot assignment mechanism utilized
in this paper.
A. Network model
The network is assumed to consist of N nodes, where vi
(0 ≤ i ≤ (N − 1)) denotes both the i-th node and the
point of the node’s location in a ﬁeld. One node in the
network, denoted as v0, serves as the gateway node, and
the remaining nodes function as relay nodes, constructing
a network topology that describes the communication be-
tween all nodes in the form of a directed graph. In relay
networks, the gateway node is connected to an external
network, and the relay nodes communicate with the gateway
node either directly or via other relay nodes along the
path between the relay node and the gateway node. There
are two kinds of communications: upward communication
and downward communication. In upward communication,
data is transferred from relay nodes toward the gateway

node. Conversely, data is transferred from the gateway node
toward relay nodes in downward communication. The path
is determined by a routing algorithm, and the directed graph
is constructed as a tree structure whose root is the gateway
node v0. Note that we do not consider the user clients which
connect to the relay node.
Figure 2 shows an example of a network topology where
a gateway node and nine relay nodes are deployed. In the
ﬁgure the link between nodes means two directed links.
In the ﬁgure, the red circle indicates the gateway node,
gray circles indicate relay nodes, and solid lines indicate
communication links respectively. Here, a communication
link from node vi to node vj is denoted as li,j.
B. Radio interference model
In this paper, the propagation and interference of radio
waves are modelled by the protocol model [20]. The trans-
mission and interference range of node vi is deﬁned as the
following sets of points.
Ti = {p | Dvip ≤ ti}
(1)
Ri = {p | Dvip ≤ ri}
(2)
Here, Dab is the the distance between a and b. In addition, ti
and ri represent the transmission range and the interference
range of node vi, respectively. In general, ri > ti, and the
ratio of the interference range to the transmission range for
node vi is set to be between around 2 and 4 depending on
the environment [26].
Based on the protocol model, the conditions to determine
the succeess of transmission and the occurrence of the inter-
ference are as follows. Node vj can receive a transmission
from node vi when vj ∈ Ti is satisﬁed. Figure 3 shows
an example of radio interference between communication
links. In this ﬁgure, there are four nodes maintaining two
communication links li,j and lp,q. The protocol model de-
ﬁnes the radio interference between li,j and lp,q based on
the distances between the four vertices vi, vj, vp, and vq.
When vq ∈ Ri is satisﬁed, link li,j interferes with link lp,q.
C. Time slot assignment mechanism
The IEEE 802.16j protocol uses the OFDMA mechanism
to control the ability of nodes to transmit by assigning
radio resources for transmission. In the OFDMA mechanism,
radio resources are divided along both frequency and time

dimensions. For simplicity, in this paper, each divided radio
resource is regarded as a time slot. In the relay networks,
time slots are assigned to wireless links as transmission
opportunities. Then, different time slots are assigned to
wireless links that interfere with each other in order to
prevent radio wave interference. On the other hand, multiple
links can communicate simultaneously within the same time
slot as long as the time slot is assigned to the links that do
not interfere with each other. This mechanism is known as
spatial reuse of wireless resource [27][28].
The performance of relay networks can be improved by
spatial reuse with concurrent transmissions since such an
approach reduces the total number of time slots assigned
to all communication links in the network. The time slot
assignment problem with consideration of spatial reuse is
regarded as a vertex coloring problem [29] of the conﬂict
graph [30]. In the conﬂict graph, a vertex represents a
link in the network and an edge between two vertices is
constructed when the corresponding links interfere with each
other, and time slots can be assigned to links in the network
by allocating different colors to adjacent vertices in the
conﬂict graph. However, since the vertex coloring problem
is known to be NP-hard [31][32], heuristic algorithms have
been proposed for solving the problem [33][34][35][36]. In
this paper, we use the method proposed in [35] to assign
time slots to links for performance evaluation.
III. PROPOSED MODELS
This section introduces an obstacle model utilized in this
paper, followed by the extension of the protocol model for
accommodating the effect of the obstacles on radio wave
propagation. Finally, using the obstacle model and extended
protocol model, the inﬂuence of obstacles on network per-
formance is discussed.
A. Obstacle model
Figure 4 depicts the obstacle model, where rectangular
obstacles are deployed in the ﬁeld. In the model, two
placement patterns are considered. In random placement,
the obstacles are deployed at random in the ﬁeld. In grid
placement, on the other hand, the obstacles are deployed

in a grid pattern. In both placements, the obstacles are not
deployed at the center of the ﬁeld, where the gateway node
is located. The side lengths of the obstacles are chosen
at random from within a certain range, and the obstacles
are placed parallel to the ﬁeld. The relay nodes cannot be
deployed at locations occupied by obstacles. The height
of the obstacles is ignored since the network model is
constructed in a plane. Here, the following function O(k)
is deﬁned whether or not a point k in the ﬁeld is occupied
by obstacles.
O(k) =
{
1
point k is occupied by obstacles
0
otherwise
(3)
B. Extended protocol model
In general, the effects of obstacles on radio waves include
obstruction, reﬂection, and diffraction. We consider only
radio wave obstruction in this paper since it has great effects
on relay network performance.
For evaluating the effects of obstacles, we extend the
protocol model considering radio wave obstruction by obsta-
cles. The modiﬁed model is crefered to as extended protocol
model. In this model, the transmission and interference range
of node vi are also deﬁned as sets of points. The sets T ′
i
and R′
i are described as follows.
T ′
i
=
{p′ | p′ ∈ Ti and C(vi, p′) = 0}
(4)
R′
i
=
{p′ | p′ ∈ Ri and C(vi, p′) = 0}
(5)
Here, C(a, b) is the following function that determines the
presence of obstacles between two points a and b.
C(a, b) =
{
1
∃k(Dak + Dbk = Dab and O(k) = 1)
0
otherwise
(6)
where Dak, Dbk, and Dab, means the distance between
points a and b.
Figure 5 shows an example of the extended protocol
model. The limitation of the transmission and interference
range of node vi by obstacles is conﬁrmed in this ﬁgure.

C. Effect of obstacles on relay network performance
Figure 6 shows the combined image of the obstacle model
and the extended protocol model. The effect of obstacles on
the connectivity between relay nodes is represented in this
ﬁgure. For example, in the left panel of Figure 6, l1,6 and
l7,8 become disconnected due to radio wave obstruction by
obstacles. In this case, v6 can connect to the network via
v4. On the other hand, v8 is completely disconnected from
the network by another obstacle. This is a negative aspect of
obstacles in relay networks, owing to the increased number
of isolated nodes and the higher average hop count between
relay nodes and the gateway node.
On the other hand, Figure 7 shows an example of a
beneﬁcial effect of radio wave obstruction. Although in
Figure 7(a) li,j and lp,q interfere with each other, by adding
obstacles as shown in Figure 7(b), the interference range of
vi is limited and vq is not affected by the interference from
vi. As a result, the addition of an obstacle allows these two
links to transmit simultaneously, which is a positive aspect
of obstacles.
As described above, obstacles entail both advantages and
disadvantages in terms of network performance. Therefore,
it is important to consider the presence of obstacles and
their inﬂuence on radio wave propagation for assessing the
network performance.

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we evaluate the inﬂuence of obstacles
on the performance of relay networks through simulation
experiments by using the obstacle model and the extended
protocol model proposed in the previous section. We utilized
the simulator built in our labortory since there is no existing
simulator which can simulate thedetailed behavior of IEEE
802.16j networks with obstacles.
A. Evaluation settings
In the simulation experiments, one gateway node was
placed at the center of a 1 × 1 square area, and 99 relay
nodes were distributed at random locations in the ﬁeld. The
transmission range was set to 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, or 0.35,
where all relay and gateway nodes utilize the same value for
each experiment. The ratio of the interference range to the
transmission range was set to 2.0 for all nodes. Note that
we have conﬁrmed the setting of this ratio does not change
the overall tendency of the following results. A network
topology was constructed such that the hop count between
the gateway node and each relay node was minimized.
The number of obstacles was set to be from 0 to 250 at
intervals of 25 in the case of random placement. For the grid
placement, we choose one the following placement patterns:
3 × 3 (8 obstacles), 5 × 5 (24 obstacles), and 7 × 7 (48
obstacles). The length of the sides of each obstacle was
set to a random value between 0.004 and 0.04, assuming
that the obstacles are placed in 2000m×2000m area of real-
world environment. We determine the trafﬁc demand from
relay nodes to the gateway nodes according to the Voronoi
diagram for each relay node, where we assume the user
clients are distributed uniformly in the area and they generate
the same amount of trafﬁc to the gateway node.
We
observed
the
service
ratio
and
the
power-to-
throughput ratio as network performance metrics. The ser-
vice ratio is the ratio of the area where the relay network
can provide service to the overall ﬁeld area, excepting
the area of the obstacles. The power-to-throughput ratio
is the value of the total power consumption of the nodes
divided by the gateway throughput. Here, the total power
consumption is simply deﬁned as the sum of the squares
of the transmission ranges of all connected nodes, and the
gateway throughput is deﬁned as the ratio of the number
of time slots assigned to links directly connected to the
gateway node against the number of slots assigned to all
communication links in the network. We focused only on the
downward communication and conducted 100,000 iterations
of the simulation experiments for each set of parameter
settings and the all results were divided according to the
number of connected nodes excluding isolated nodes, and
the average values were used for performance evaluation.
B. Effect of the number of obstacles
Figure 8 depicts the service ratio and the power-to-
throughput ratio in the random placement pattern as a
function of the number of connected nodes when the trans-
mission range is set to 0.20. The x-axis of graph means the
number of connected nodes. Note that the x-axis value of
less than 100 means that there are some nodes disconnected
from the network due to radio wave obstruction by obstacles.
As shown in Figure 8, both metrics increase as the number
of connected nodes increases, but there are differences in
their increase tendency. The service ratio in Figure 8(a)
decreases as the number of obstacles increases regardless of
the number of connected nodes since radio wave propagation
is obstructed by obstacles. On the other hand, the power-to-
throughput ratio in Figure 8(b) does not show such a simple
trend. When the number of obstacles increases from 0 to
150, the power-to-throughput ratio decreases, whereas in the
case of the increase in the number of obstacles from 150 to
250, the power-to-throughput ratio increases together with
the number of obstacles. The reason for this is as follows.
When the number of obstacles increases from 0 to 150,
multiple wireless links in the network come to be able to
transmit simultaneously due to the limitation of the interfer-
ence range by obstacles. As a result, the network throughput
is improved. On the other hand, as the number of obstacles
increases further, the links between nodes are likely to
become disconnected due to the radio wave obstruction by
obstacles. It leads to the decrease in the network throughput.
C. Effect of the obstacle placement pattern
Figure 9 represents the effects of obstacle placement pat-
tern on the network performance where the results of random
and grid placement patterns with similar number of obsta-
cles. In terms of service ratio, the obstacle placement pattern
and the number of obstacles have little impact as shown in
Figure 9(a). This is because the number of obstacles is small
as compared with Figure 8, and the service ratio is mainly
dependent on the number of connected nodes. On the other
hand, Figure 9(b) shows that the decrease trend of the power-
to-throughput ratio as the number of obstacles increases is
different in the two placement patterns, and when comparing
the same number of obstacles in both patterns, the grid
placement pattern shows lower power-to-throughput ratio.
This is because in the grid placement pattern the number
of connected nodes is barely affected since the obstacles
are regularly spaced. As a result, the network throughput is
improved and the power-to-throughput ratio decreases since
the interference is reduced effectively due to the presence
of obstacles.
D. Effect of the transmission range
Figure 10 shows the relationship between the service ratio
and the power-to-throughput ratio when the transmission
range of the nodes is set to 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, and

nodes is indicated for each plot, where it increases from left
to right and the rightmost point indicates the average value
when the number of connected nodes is 100.
We focused on the plots denoted with squares in the ﬁgure
when the number of connected nodes is 95. Here, there are
two methods for improving the service ratio. One involves
increasing the transmission range of each node, and the
other involves deploying additional nodes in the network. As
shown in Figure 10, when the transmission range becomes
large, the power-to-throughput ratio increases rapidly while
the service ratio increases. On the other hand, by deploy-
ing additional nodes in the ﬁeld, the service ratio can be
enhanced with a small increase of the power-to-throughput
ratio. Also, we can see from this ﬁgure that the power-to-
throughput ratio does not so increased as transmission power
increases, compared with the case of no obstacles where

the power is proportional to the square of the transmission
range. This is because of the another effect of the obstacles.
However, we conclude that the deployment of additional
nodes can improve the service ratio more effectively than
the increase in the transmission range of nodes.
V. ESTIMATION OF NETWORK PERFORMANCE
As described in Section IV, the performance of relay net-
works is largely affected by the various network parameters
such as the number of connected nodes, a transmission range
of each node, and distribution density of obstacles. In this
section, we propose a method for estimating the performance
of relay networks on the basis of the regression analysis
of the simulation results. The accuracy of the analysis is
then evaluated using both obstacle model and the real-world
environment.

As a method for estimating network performance, regres-
sion equations are derived based on the simulation results
presented in the previous section. Speciﬁcally, the equations
for the service ratio and the power-to-throughput ratio are
denoted as S(n, t, d) and P(n, t, d), where n, t, and d
represent the number of connected nodes in the network, the
transmission range of the nodes, and the distribution density
of obstacles, respectively. We take there three parameters
since they affect the performance of the relay network
considered in this paper. The distribution density of obstacles
is deﬁned as the ratio of the area of obstacles to the overall
area. All parameters are normalized to fall within the range
between 0 and 1 based on the maximum values in the
simulation experiments. By using these network parameters
and the network performance as explanatory variables and
objective variables, respectively, multiple regression analysis
is conducted.
We conducted Microsoft Excel for regression analysis. As
the result, we obtain the following equations to estimate the
service ratio and the power-to-throughput ratio.
S(n, t, d)
=
7.78 + 92.54n + 34.95t2 − 27.9d
(7)
P(n, t, d)
=
−1.21 + 2.42n + 9.25t − 2.14d
(8)
B. Accuracy of the regression equations
In order to examine the accuracy of the regression equa-
tions, the estimation values from the equations are compared
with the simulation results. In detail, for each experiment,
the obstacle placement pattern is ﬁrst determined based on
the obstacle model or the real-world environment. Next,
on the basis of each obstacle placement pattern, simulation
experiments are conducted, where the number of nodes
is 100, and the transmission range of each node is set
from 0.15 to 0.35. As a result, the service ratio and the
power-to-throughput ratio are obtained as simulation results.
Moreover, by using the regression equations in Equations (7)
and (8), the estimation values are calculated based on each
parameter setting utilized in the simulation experiments.
Finally, the estimation accuracy of the regression equations
is evaluated through comparison with the simulation results
and estimation values. Here, as a metric of the accuracy, the
relative error Er in Equation (9) is utilized, where Vr and
Vs indicate the simulation result and the estimation value,
respectively.
Er = |Vr − Vs|
Vs

1) Evaluation results based on the obstacle model: Fig-
ures 11(a) and 11(b) depict the distributions of the relative
error for the service ratio and the power-to-throughput ratio,
respectively, with several values for the number of obstacles
in the case of both placement patterns. From the ﬁgures, it is
observed that the accuracy of the equations is high regardless
of the obstacle placement pattern. However, the ﬁgures also
represent that the increase in the number of obstacles leads to
deterioration of the accuracy in both metrics. This is because
when the number of obstacles is large, the obstacles have
greater impact on these network performance than expected.
Therefore, these results show that the proposed methods
can provide accurate estimates of network performance with-
out simulation experiments when the number of obstacles is
small.
2) Evaluation results based on the real-world environ-
ment: Next, the accuracy of the equations is evaluated based
on the real-world environment. For this purpose, we obtained
obstacle placement patterns from maps in the real world
by using Google Maps API [37]. In detail, 2000m×2000m
square areas are randomly chosen from the ﬁeld, ranging
from Osaka Prefecture to Mie Prefecture in Japan, which
satisﬁes the conditions that the latitude ranges from 34.5
to 35.5 degrees north and the longitude ranges from 135.5
to 136.5 degrees east, which corresponds to the residential
area of the north part of Osaka, Japan. The ﬁelds whose
distribution density of obstacles is from 1% to 25% are
utilized for evaluation.
Figure 12 shows the distribution of relative error of the
service ratio and the power-to-throughput ratio, where each
plot represents the average of the results when the number
of connected nodes is more than 30 in the simulation exper-
iments. Although, in terms of the service ratio, the relative
error is within 0.1 when the distribution density of obstacle
is small, it becomes large as the distribution density of
obstacle increases due to the biased tendency of distribution
of obstacles. As a result, when the distribution density of
obstacles is small, the service ratio can be estimated with
a high degree of accuracy using the proposed method in
real-world environment.
On the other hand, the relative error for the power-to-
throughput ratio varies as shown in Figure 12(b) even when

Distribution of relative error for the obstacle model
the distribution density of obstacles is small. The possible
reason is as follows. In the ﬁeld where there is a lot of
obstacles concentrating around the gateway node, the link
directly connected to the gateway node is likely to become
disconnected due to the radio wave obstruction by obstacles.
Although the regression equations are constructed based on
simulation results including such situations, the decrease in
the number of links of the gateway node has a great impact
on the throughput beyond the expectation especially when
the distribution density of obstacles is large. Therefore, the
accuracy of the proposed method becomes worse in terms
of the power-to-throughput ratio.
Figure 13 represents the examples of this case, where
black part means the obstacles. 1Although the distribution
density of obstacles in both cases is around 17%, the
estimation accuracy is different. In Figure13(a), the relative
error is 0.0285, while it is 0.471 for Figure 13(b), where
many obstacles located at the center area of the ﬁeld.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the performance of IEEE 802.16j multi-
hop networks was investigated by considering the presence
of obstacles. We ﬁrst deﬁned the obstacle model which
determines location and size of each obstacle in the network,
and extended the protocol model for determining the connec-
tivity and interference relationships considering radio wave
obstruction by obstacles. Simulation experiments using the
proposed models revealed that the deployment of additional
relay nodes improves the service ratio more effectively than
an increase in the radio transmission range of each relay
node. We also revealed the effects of the network parameters,
such as the number of connected nodes, a transmission range
of each node, and distribution density of obstacles, on the
performance of IEEE 802.16j networks.
In addition, a method for estimating the performance of
relay networks on the basis of regression analysis was also

proposed. By comparing between the simulation results and
the estimation values derived from the regression equations,
we conﬁrmed that the equations can yield an accurate esti-
mation of network performance when the number of obsta-
cles is small. This results help us estimate the performance
of relay networks with obstacles in designing step. However,
the accuracy of the proposed equations was deteriorated
in terms of the power-to-throughput ratio using the real-
world environment even when the number of obstacles is
small, since the links directly connected to the gateway node
are likely to become disconnected due to the radio wave
obstruction by obstacles.
Future work will be directed toward applying more precise
radio interference models, including signal-to-interference-
plus-noise ratio (SINR) model in order to consider other
effects of obstacles, such as reﬂection and diffraction of
radio waves. We need to evaluate the validity of the
regression model and to consider more detailed obstract
model which accommodate the reﬂection and diffraction
of radio waves. We also plan to evaluate of the proposed
model with packet-level performance metric such as packet
delivery delay and packet loss ratio. Furthermore, we need to
apply the proposed scheme to multi-carrier OFDMA system,
whereas in this paper we implicitly assume the single-carrier
OFDMA where the radio resources are only time slots. Node
replacement for obtaining better performance based on the
proposed regression model is another interesting topic.
