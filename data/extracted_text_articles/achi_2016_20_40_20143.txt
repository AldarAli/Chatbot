Abstract‚ÄîIn recent years, several researches of haptic devices 
have been conducted. By using conventional haptic devices, 
users can perceive touching an object, such as Computer 
Graphics (CG) by a force feedback. Since conventional haptic 
devices provide a force feedback from a single point on an 
object surface where users touch it, users touch an object by 
point contact. However, conventional haptic devices cannot 
provide users with a sense such as humans touching an object 
with a finger pad because a finger pad does not touch an object 
by point contact but surface contact in reality. In this paper, 
we propose a novel haptic device. By using this haptic device, 
users can perceive the slope of a CG object surface when they 
put fingers on it without tracing. Moreover, users can perceive 
grabbing a CG object with finger pads. To grab CG object, we 
mount the plane interface of the haptic device on each two 
fingers. Then, users can perceive the slope of a CG object 
surface where users are touching. Each plane interface 
provides users with the slope approximated to a tangent plane 
of area where they touched. In the evaluation experiments, the 
subjects in this experiment evaluated this haptic device. From 
the results, the subjects could perceive the slope of a CG object 
surface. In addition, they could perceive grabbing a CG object.

 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, researches of human interface using 
Augmented Reality (AR) have been conducted. In order to 
touch CG objects that are drawn by AR, haptic devices have 
been developed. By using a haptic device, users can perceive 
touching CG objects by processing a force feedback. 
Therefore, haptic devices are expected to be used in 
applications such as remote control of robots and computer 
games. 
Examples of conventional haptic devices include Falcon 
[1], PHANToM [2] and Dexmo [3]. Falcon and PHANToM 
are classified into a grounded type. This type can provide 
users with accurate force feedback because its fulcrum is 
fixed on the table. Dexmo is classified into a finger mounted 
type. This type can provide users with perception of grabbing 
CG objects easily. In addition, users can operate the device 
without operating range limitation. These haptic devices 
have been developed as a point contact haptic device. By 
using this type of haptic device, users can perceive touching 
CG objects because they are provided with a force feedback 
from a single point on the CG object surface where they 
touched. In case of perception of an objects shape, from 
visual information, users perceive CG objects shape of 
visible part. As invisible part, users must perceive CG 
objects shape by touching the surface. However, in a point 
contact type, to perceive CG objects shape, users must trace 
the surface because they perceive only touching CG objects. 
Therefore, they cannot work smoothly in that part. In order 
to perceive CG objects shape without tracing the surface, the 
direction of a force feedback must change according to a 
surface shape where users touched. Our laboratory focused 
on this characteristic. In addition, our laboratory has 
developed a haptic device based on an approximated plane 
(HaAP) [4] that is shown in Figure 1. HaAP is a grounded 
type. Moreover, HaAP is a surface contact type haptic device 
which has a plane interface that is shown in Figure 1-(a). 
Since as shown in Figure 1-(b), the plane interface provides 
users with a force feedback by being approximated to the 
tangent plane on a CG object surface where they touched, 
users can perceive the shape from the surface slope without 
tracing the surface. In this device, users are limited to operate 
HaAP in range of the HaAP vertical mechanism within 10 
cm.

haptic device realizes three things. First, users are provided 
with a force feedback by the plane interface providing the

slope approximated to the tangent plane on a CG object 
surface. Second, users can operate this haptic device without 
operating range limitation. Third, by using this haptic device, 
users can perceive grabbing a CG object. To realize that, we 
develop a haptic device having characteristics of a finger 
mounted type and a surface contact type. 
This paper is structured as follows: First, the outline of 
the proposed haptic device is explained in section II. In 
section III, the hardware construction, the system overview 
and the system flowchart are proposed. Evaluation 
experiments are carried out for the proposed haptic device in 
section IV. Finally, conclusions and future works end this 
paper.

OUR APPROACH 
Figure 2 shows the outline of the proposed haptic device. 
This device uses a plane interface having four movable 
points. These four movable points operate up and down 
separately.

Figure 2-(a) shows the initial state. In this state, the user 
is not touching a CG object. Figure 2-(b) shows the operating 
state. In this state, the user is touching a CG object. The 
plane interface provides a finger pad with a force feedback 
by approximating the tangent plane on the CG object.

THE PROPOSED SYSTEM 
A. Hardware condtruction 
Figure 3 shows the appearance of the proposed haptic 
device.  
 
Figure 3.  Appearance of the proposed haptic device. 
This device is a glove type and composed of Arduino 
Uno, four servo motors (GWS Servo PIC+F/BB/F), four 
springs and a plane interface for each finger. Eight motors 
are mounted in the back of the hand. In addition, each motor 
is connected to Arduino Uno for the index finger and 
Arduino Uno for the thumb, respectively. Arduino Uno 
controls four motors in each finger. These motors pull up 
the movable points of the plane interface with wires. When 
motors pull up, wires hang at the fulcrum part. Each spring 
adheres to each movable point.  
B. System overview 
Figure 4 shows the system overview. This system 
consists of PC, Display, Web-Camera and the proposed 
haptic device. The user attaches markers on fingers and 
wears the proposed haptic device.

1) Initialization of the haptic device: Arduino Uno 
controls motors to make springs natural length. 
2) Drawing a CG object: Based on the reference marker, 
ARToolkit [5] draws Sphere CG object or Sin-cos curve CG 
object that is shown in Figures 6 and  7, respectively. 
    
Figure 6.  Sphere CG object 
 
Figure 7.  Sin-cos CG object 
3) Detecting finger position and posture: Figure 8 
shows detecting the marker on each finger position and 
posture. The system recognizes the reference marker and the 
marker on each finger from the image that is captured by the 
web camera. By using ARToolKit, the system obtains 
position (X,Y,Z) of the marker on each finger from the 
reference marker. In addition, by using ARToolKit, the 
system also calculates ùêπùëü that denotes the roll angle and ùêπùëù 
that denotes the pitch angle of the marker on each finger. 
 
Figure 8.  Detecting the finger position and posture. 
4) Judgement of contact: In the case of a Sphere CG 
object, as shown in Figure 9, when the length between the 
marker on the finger position and the center of Sphere CG 
object is within radius of Sphere CG object, the system 
judges contact.  
 
Figure 9.  Touching Sphere CG object 
In case of Sin-cos curve CG object, the system calculates 
Z-coordinate on Sin-cos curve CG object. The following is 
the equation of Sin-cos curve. 
ùê¥ ùë†ùëñùëõ ùëã ùëêùëúùë† ùëå = ùëç, 
(1) 
where A is amplitude and X, Y and Z are X, Y and Z-
coordinate on Sin-cos curve CG object. By substituting X 
and Y-coordinate of the marker on the finger for this 
equation, the system obtains Z. As shown in Figure 10, 
when Z-coordinate of the marker on the finger is under Z, 
the system judges contact. 
 
Figure 10.  Touching Sin-cos curve CG object. 
5) Calculation of the motor rotation angle: The system 
calculates the normal vector on touching point. 
In case of a Sphere CG object, the vector from the center 
of Sphere CG object to the touching point is defined as the 
normal vector on the touching point. 
In case of Sin-cos curve CG object, Sin-cos curve CG 
object is composed of many planes. Figure 11 shows 
calculation of the normal vector on the touching point. The 
system uses the equation of vector product 
ùëµ = ùë® √ó ùë©,

where A and B are the vectors from the touching point to 
other points on the plane that includes the contact point. The 
system obtains the normal vector from right hand screw rule. 
 
Figure 11.  Calculation of the normal vector. 
From the normal vector, the system calculates the roll 
angle and the pitch angle of the tangent plane on touching 
point. Figure 12 shows the calculation of the tangent plane 
slope on touching point in X-Z plane and Y-Z plane. The 
system uses 
ùëáùëù = 90¬∞ ‚àí ùúÉùë¶, 
(3) 
ùëáùëü = 90¬∞ ‚àí ùúÉùë• 
(4) 
to obtain the roll and pitch angle of the tangent plane. ùúÉùë• 
denotes the angle between x-axis and the normal vector and 
ùúÉùë¶ denotes the angle between y-axis and the normal vector. 
Using (3) and (4), the system obtains ùëáùëü that denotes the roll 
angle of tangent plane and ùëáùëù that denotes the pitch angle of 
the tangent plane. 
 
Figure 12.  Calculation of the tangent plane angle. 
Using equations (5) and (6), the system calculates the 
difference between the angle of the marker on the finger and 
that of the tangent plane. 
 
ùê∑ùëù = |ùëáùëù ‚àí ùêπùëù|, 
(5) 
ùê∑ùëü = |ùëáùëü ‚àí ùêπùëü|. 
(6) 
This difference is the plane interface slope that is shown 
in Figure 13. ùêπùëù and ùêπùëü are shown in Figure 8. Figure 13-(a) 
shows ùê∑ùëù that denotes the difference between ùêπùëù  and ùëáùëù . 
Figure 13-(b) shows ùê∑ùëü that denotes the difference between 
ùêπùëü and ùëáùëü. 
 
(a). Difference of the pitch angle. 
 
(b). Difference of the roll angle. 
Figure 13.  Calculation of the plane interface slope. 
The system calculates the operation length of movable 
point from the plane interface slope. Figure 14 shows two 
lengths (L1 and L2). These two lengths are defined 
L1 =
ùê¥
2 sin(|ùê∑ùëù|) +
ùê¥
2 sin(|ùê∑ùëü|),

L1 = |

as the operation length of movable points. Where A is the 
length of one side on a plane interface. Using (7) and (8), 
the system calculates these lengths.

to calculate the angle of motor rotation, where R denotes the 
length of servo horn. A1 and A2 are the amount of 
controlling motors. The system sends this amount to each 
Arduino Uno by serial communication.

amount of controlling motors and controls motors. Motors 
pull up each movable point with wires. Figure 16-(a) and (b) 
shows providing a finger with a force feedback when users 
touched Sphere CG object in Y-Z plane and X-Z plane 
respectively. Figure 16-(c) and (d) shows providing a finger

EVALUATION EXPERIMENTS 
A. Overview of the experiments 
We had an evaluation experiment for the proposed 
haptic device. Sin-cos curve CG object is used in order to 
evaluate whether users can perceive the slope of the CG 
object surface or not. In addition, a Sphere CG object is 
used in order to evaluate whether users can perceive 
grabbing a CG object or not. Eleven subjects used the 
proposed haptic device. After that, they evaluated following 
items with a 5-grade score: 
In case of Sin-cos CG object, 
ÔÇ∑

object with one finger, you perceived the asperity of the 
CG object surface (Item2).

ÔÇ∑

ÔÇ∑

ÔÇ∑ 
When you touched the CG object with two fingers, you

Evaluation values are from 1 to 5 (1 : ‚ÄùStrongly 
disagree‚Äù, 2 : ‚ÄùDisagree‚Äù, 3 : ‚ÄùNeutral‚Äù, 4 : ‚ÄùAgree‚Äù, 
5 : ‚ÄùStrongly agree‚Äù). 
B. Discussion 
Table 1 shows the results of Sin-cos curve CG object. 
Table 2 shows the results of Sphere CG object. Each result 
shows the average score and the standard deviation.

From these results, in Item1 of Tables 1 and 2, we see 
that users perceived the slope of CG object without tracing 
the surface. In Item2 of Tables 1 and 2, the results show that 
users perceived the asperity by tracing the surface. In 
addition, in Item3 and Item4 of Table 2, we see that users 
perceived grabbing a CG object. Therefore, we consider that 
the proposed haptic device can provide users with 
perception of the CG object surface slope. Moreover, we 
consider that users can perceive grabbing a CG object by 
using the proposed haptic device. In addition, from Tables 1 
and 2, we see that the average score in Table 1 is higher 
than that in Table 2. Since the surface of Sin-cos curve CG 
object is more complex than that of Sphere CG object, the 
accuracy of the proposed haptic device is improved when 
CG object have complex surface. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
In this paper, we proposed a novel haptic device. The 
proposed haptic device has a plane interface to provide a 
slope approximated to the tangent plane of the CG object 
area where users touched. In addition, to perceive grabbing 
a CG object, the proposed haptic device is designed as a 
finger mounted type. After evaluation experiments, we see 
that the proposed haptic device can provide users with 
perception of the CG object surface slope without tracing 
the surface and perception of grabbing the CG object. 
However, we consider that users cannot grasp the sense of 
the distance between finger and a CG object easily. To solve 
the issue, we improve the proposed haptic device to grasp 
the sense of the distance more easily by using Head 
Mounted Display (HMD). In the future, we will improve the 
operability of the proposed haptic device by lightening the 
device. In addition, by using Leap Motion, we will improve 
the accuracy of detecting finger position and posture.
