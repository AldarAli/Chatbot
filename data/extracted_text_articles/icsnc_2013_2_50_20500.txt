 Abstract - In this paper, a different scheme of encoding 
digital data using wavelet functions instead of sinusoidal 
waves is explained. Data communications use various modes 
of encoding the data bits into a frequency signal.  Phase shift 
keying of various forms such as Binary Phase Shift Keying, 
Quaternary Phase Shift Keying, etc., are in vogue in several 
current communication schemes, such as Global system for 
mobile communication. Errors in bits at the received end 
through a wireless channel are common in such data 
communication. These errors are mainly caused by improper 
phase changes in the detected audio signal.  Since the method 
presented here with the use of wavelet functions provides 
several clues for identification of the data symbol instead of 
just by one criterion viz., the phase of the carrier as in the 
Phase shift keying  schemes, this method is found to be better 
in performance. Simulation of the scheme was made with 
Matlab and the results provide an improved bit error ratio. 
Also, by varying the wavelets as per the user’s choice, 
provides a higher level of security.

INTRODUCTION 
 
       Data communication has been employing several 
modes of encoding the data bits into an analog signal.  
Phase shift keying (PSK), in its various forms, such as 
Binary PSK,  Quaternary Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), 
etc., use a baseband sine waveform with different phase 
positions to encode the data bits[1]. So far, alternatives to 
the sine wave signal for modulation have not been 
considered in any existing communication scheme, wired 
or wireless.  All of the current methods employ a 
combination of phase shifting and amplitude changes for 
encoding the data bits.  For example, in Figure 1, the 
QPSK modulation method uses four phases of the sine 
wave, with 90o phase difference between symbols. In 
phase notation, the four waves can be represented as 
0.7+0.7j, 0.7-0.7j,-0.7+0.7j, and -0.7-0.7j (Fig.2).

            proposed wavelet modulation. 
 
 
 
Fig. 2.   The phase plot of QPSK symbols are having values in the     
complex plane marked. 
 
     When symbols of various values are thus encoded as 
analog sine modulation signals, we get a problem of 
spectral leakage, since there are discontinuities from 
symbol to symbol waveforms.  This introduces errors in 
the case of transmission with multiple carriers. For 
instance, a truncated sine wave for symbol 01 will have a 
spectrum which spreads and is not confined to a single 
point.  The shape of the spectrum will be somewhat 
similar, as shown in Figure 3. 
        
 
Fig. 3. The Fourier Transform (absolute value) of a data stream in a plain  
             QPSK encoding modulating method is shown. 
     An alternative modulation scheme using waveforms of 
standard wavelet functions of the Daubechie (DB) type is 
shown in Figure 1. These functions are mathematically 
well defined and possess properties suitable for encoding 
and decoding.  Four such wavelets, the DB4, DB6, DB8 
and DB10 are shown as used for the same four symbols of 
data (00, 01, 10, and 11). 
     Trying such alternative modulation is done with a view 
to provide fewer errors in reception and also with some 
security provisions. This is done by using wavelets 
assigned to the bit patterns that can be of user centric.  
      Amongst the different wavelets known, such as Meyer 
[5], Coiflet [5], etc., the Daubechie wavelet [5], alone 
have several waveforms available for its different K-
values and thus, it enables encoding more bit patterns per 
symbol. 
      To understand the genesis and properties of Daubechie 
wavelets, one can refer Addison [2].  During the symbol 
time, the end points of the waveform reach zero level and 
there is no discontinuity from symbol to symbol. This

` 
helps in having a spectrum without any leakage.  Well 
defined spectra result for such waveforms.  So, in multiple 
carrier modulation methods as used in 802.11 and related 
schemes, the method can be applied with definitely much 
better results.  
    To point out the lacuna in an existing 802.11 multi 
carrier scheme, consider how the time signal is formed in 
that method, as clearly depicted in Figure 4. In this figure, 
for simplicity, five subcarriers are shown.  Each subcarrier 
can have a particular phase angle of a few cycles of the 
sine wave used for modulation and this is represented as a 
phase with a real part and an imaginary part, as shown in 
the spectral representation as I and Q.   
    Each carrier is at a frequency range which is twice, 
thrice etc. of the first carrier. In order to generate the total 
time signal, which will include all the carrier frequencies, 
from the low to the highest, in it, the present method just 
assumes that the symbol waveform can be represented as 
a phase of single value, such as 0.707+0.707j for one such 
QPSK symbol. From Figure 3, we note that is incorrect, 
because of the discontinuous nature of the segment of a 
QPSK 
signal. 
 
In 
Global 
System 
for 
Mobile 
Communication (GSM), a Gaussian filter is applied to the 
symbol waveform called Gaussian minimum shift keying. 
Even still, there are discontinuities between symbols in 
the signal in time domain. 
 
 
Fig. 4. The present method of forming a time signal for RF modulation 
in a Multi-carrier baseband scheme [3]. 
 
     The mistake committed in the present scheme for 
getting the time signal from multiple QPSK (or even 
higher density schemes like 16QAM, 64QAM, etc.) lies in 
assuming that the spectrum of each carrier is a single 
point phase.  Only if the sine wave is continuous for all 
time, the Fourier spectrum will be a single phase. So, 
combining these single phases at f1, f2, f3… etc. through 
an inverse Fourier Transform (FT) to generate the total 
time slot signal is having spectral leakage errors.  These 
spectral leakage errors can definitely contribute to inter-
symbol interference while decoding the signal at the 
received end.  
     The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section II 
gives a comparison of errors for standard QPSK and 
wavelet modulation. Section III deals with the bit error 
estimates for the proposed method. Then, the following 
Sections IV and V deal with wavelet shift keying multi-
carrier communication as compared to sine phase shift 
modulation. The test implementation is discussed in 
Section VI and the comparison with sine modulation is 
detailed in Section VII.  Section VIII deals with other 
attempts [12] bearing the name wavelets [13][14] and 
finally, the paper ends with a conclusion section. 
 
II. ERRORS IN SYMBOLS – A COMPARISON 
      The process of decoding a standard sine modulated 
(QPSK, 16 QAM) signal first requires the generation of 
the reference sine wave from the first few data symbols, 
which are the initialization symbols. A Costas loop is a 
technique [4] that is also used to generate this reference 
wave. If the reference signal is slightly out of phase, that 
gives errors throughout the data. 
     Then, a multiplication of the signal received with this 
reference is performed.  The average of this product is 
proportional to the cosine of the phase difference between 
the reference and the received segment of the phase 
shifted sine wave in that time slot. For each time slot, the 
phase is thus obtained. From this phase, the data symbol is 
decoded. With additional amplitude modulation as in 
QAM mode, the amplitude of the signal is also used to 
determine the symbol value. 
      In other words, the only information used for decoding 
is the phase of the signal.  Phase of a sine wave is often 
subject to delays and changes en-route that is the reason 
for the errors in the received data. 
      Let us now describe the decoding method when 
wavelet signals are used. A wavelet signal is a well 
defined mathematical signal, which has a compact support 
and a finite spectrum without spreading like the phase 
shifted sine wave segments.  The pattern of each of the 
Daubechie signals is different and specific [5]. Thus, there 
are several criteria available for determining, in any one 
time slot, which wavelet is received. 
     First of all, from the received data, which is converted 
into digital numbers from the analog to digital convertor 
in the receiver, we have to isolate the symbols.  This is the 
process of synchronization. In this case, it is much easier 
than for sine phase modulated signals.  The first few data 
symbols are known and are identical. The first peak and 
then the peak of the second symbol are fetched.  The 
midpoint of data is a starting point for the second symbol.  
We know the number of data points in a symbol from the 
two peak positions. From then on, the data samples can be 
isolated easily.   
    The wavelet functions possess several peaks. The 
following criteria for decoding have been used by the 
authors. 
  
i). RMS value of the autocorrelation function:   
      This calculation resembles the calculation made in the 
sine 
modulation 
existing 
methods. 
Correlation 
is 
multiplication, shifting and addition, and the estimation of 
the Root Mean Square (RMS) value. 
 
ii). Peaks their ratios and spacing is another criterion:  
      Among the DB4 to DB20 wavelets, the peaks differ.  
The number of peaks increases for the higher degree 
wavelets. To determine the peaks is a simple calculation. 
By comparing with the values of the received data in each 
time slot, the correct symbol value is found.

` 
     A check on the results of the above two methods is 
able to infer plausible symbol errors.

our wavelet modulation schemes for different signal to noise 
ratios. 
 
     We conducted the tests with 16 wavelets representing a 
four bit data symbol and obtained good results. , 
For example, the Matlab sample demo program for 
QPSK [6] sine phase shift modulation scheme gives error 
rates more than our 4 bit wavelet based keying method, as 
shown in the graph of Figure 5.We note the good 
reduction in errors with the method.  
 
III. BIT ERROR ESTIMATE COMPARED TO PLAIN 
QPSK 
 
     In sine modulated QPSK transmission, the bit error is 
estimated as the probability of finding the phase position 
correctly. This is based on the conditional probabilities of 
two vector positions [7], i.e., the two axes of the phase.  
The probability of error per symbol is denoted by Pe     and 
is given by   
  
 
   Pe  = erfc (√E/N0)                        (1) 
 
     Where a white Gaussian noise (variance No /2) is 
assumed to affect the transmitted signal. This result was 
obtained by integrating up to infinity, since the vector can 
take a position all along the axis of the phase. Such a 
result has also been verified by Matlab’s simulations 
using the Monte Carlo method [6]. 
 
       In this WSK method, the probability of getting a 
wrong wavelet symbol instead of the correct symbol at 
any instant depends on the probability of nearness to the 
right symbol.  The root mean square criterion of the 
autocorrelation function of the received symbol has the 
values, 
which 
decrease 
from 
DB4 
to 
DB32, 
monotonically. These values are stored by a priori 
calculations.  
     The probability of the value deviating far from the 
right symbol’s value depends on the noise.  The integral 
of the probability function of this Gaussian random 
variable is a definite integral between the two fixed values 
only and not from 0 to infinity as in the derivation of the 
QPSK bit error probability.

    Thus, the value is definitely less than in the case of the

for Monte-Carlo simulation for QPSK and the wavelet 
modulation scheme is shown in Figure 5. Table I above

symbol synchronization, detection of symbol, etc., 
between the 16QAM and 16WSK.  
 
IV. PROPOSED WAVELET BASED SCHEME 
SIMILAR TO OFDM IN SINE PHASE SHIFT 
MODULATION 
 
      In the 802.11 a-g WLAN example, there are 48 
subcarriers. The symbol time is 4 μs. The carrier spacing 
is 312.5 KHz [8]. 
      Similar to this, if we want to implement the wavelet 
based keying scheme, let us examine the details of its 
implementation in what follows. For each time slot, there 
are many subcarriers with a spacing of frequency between 
them.  We have to generate the time signal for all such

` 
carriers put together. As the example from Figure 6a 
shows, addition of a second carrier with a DB8 waveform 
to the first carrier will mean adding a shifted version of 
the spectrum of the DB8 signal to the total spectrum.  
Thus, there are two spectral peaks shown for two carriers 
numbered 1 and 2 in Figure 6a.  The time signal for this 
will be as in Figure 6b. This is obtained by the inverse 
Fourier transform.

frequency. 
      Fig. 6(b). The time signal obtained by using the above two sub 
carrier modulations. Only 2 subcarriers are shown for 
clarity. 
 
     For example, let us take for simplicity an eight carrier   
system. There will be eight symbols sent in one time slot. 
These eight symbols will be formed by the data at the 
current time slot. Let the data for these 8 carriers are, say, 
DB4, DB8, DB12 …… DB20.  We have pre-calculated 
spectra for each of the several encoding wavelets.  We just 
position these spectra at the frequency slots 1 to 8 in this 
order.  For Figure 6a, it was done for just two carriers. For 
three carriers, Figure 7a illustrates the signals for each of 
the carriers.  The process of positioning the spectra peaks 
and arriving at the overall spectrum at any one time slot is 
a simple operation. The Inverse Fast Fourier Transform 
(IFFT) of the total set of such spectrum will give the total 
time signal.   
       The points in the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform 
(IDWT) will be just the product of the number of 
subcarriers and the number of data points in one symbol. 
In Figure 7, 128 point IFFT space is chosen. This gives 64 
points upto the folding frequency.  If 8 subcarriers are 
used, each subcarrier space is 8 points in the total of 64, 
being half the total IFFT space. When combining the data 
for each subcarrier, we have to shift the spectrum of the 
corresponding wavelet for its symbol. Thus, the 
positioning of the pre-stored spectra for all the 16 
wavelets (in a scheme similar to 16QAM) can be done to 
form the spectrum of the total time signal. This is inverted 
and it is a 128 point IFFT. This signal is modulated with 
the RF and transmitted. 
     Instead of this complicated method involving time for 
IFFT calculation, the following method is adopted here.  
     We know the wavelets used for encoding and also the 
subcarrier frequencies. The received RF demodulated 
signal would be a time signal comprising of all these 
wavelets. To retrieve each of the subcarrier data, we do an 
FFT of that signal. That FFT signal has to be separated 
into 8 different spectra by splitting the same. That requires 
a splitting program. Each of the split spectra is inverted to 
yield the DB waveforms for each subcarrier symbol. The 
illustration in Fig. 7b shows how the waveforms for three 
subcarriers merge very well with the original waveforms 
for the symbol. Thus, the symbols could be retrieved from 
all the subcarriers.

 signal created by a truncated IFFT. 7a ii) The DB8 signal   if  
it  is shifted one subcarrier right then shows higher frequency 
                 waves in it after the IFFT. 7a iii) The DB12 signal shifted two  
                  subcarriers right then it indicates still higher frequencies. 
Fig.7 b (i), 7b(ii), 7b(iii)  Shows the respective received signal after 
                    frequency separation, the received data merges with the  
symbol data perfectly. 
 
    The above Figure 7 just illustrates the method, though, 
in practice, the data is actually collected from more 
subcarriers and then decoded. The above simulation is just 
to illustrate that inter carrier interference is totally absent 
here. For sine modulation schemes, the OFDM simulation 
is found in [9]. 
 
 
V.  MULTIPATH ERROR ESTIMATION 
      Whenever multiple carriers are used, multipath 
reception always leads to errors more than desirable.  The 
estimate of multipath errors for a general sine modulated 
multicarrier signal is discussed elsewhere [10].  To make  
a comparison of the OFDM or QAM schemes  with  this 
proposed WSK scheme,  let us  examine  the  effect  of  a 
second  path signal adding to the direct  path. Let us 
assume that, as usual, the second path arrives at the next 
53

` 
time slot and hence, in the second timeslot, we have a 
reception of the combination of two symbol signals. 
      Let us compare the performance with respect to inter-
symbol interference for the sine and wavelet based 
schemes. 
i)  Sine phase modulation method: 
     Let us consider that the second (longer) path signal is 
attenuated by about 50% to that of the directpath signal 
and that the phase of that symbol is likely to be any one of 
the constellation points in phase space. If the two phases 
are very adjacent ones, then the error in phase by 
combining the two path signals will be less than half the 
phase difference between these two phases. But, if the 
previous symbol is a far apart symbol in phase diagram, 
say 135o away from the current signal, then the addition of 
the two phases moves the net phase by as much as 450 out 
of correct position (see Fig.8). 
ii) Wavelet based MWSK  scheme: 
      In the proposed WSK method, the two symbols could 
be say DB8 and DB4 on the direct and secondary paths, 
which when added gives a composite signal. With a 50% 
of the latter signal which is a wrong signal, the net root 
mean square values of the two will be obtained by 
squaring and summing and again taking the root.  
    Thus, for example if 352 for DB4 and 115 for DB8 are 
used for this Fig.8, we get the net Fig. as 
Rms =√1152+(352/2)2 = 210               (2) 
 
     which is nearer to the DB8 and hence it still yields the 
correct data.  It can be similarly shown in all cases, with 
even 50% indirect path signal, the correct results are 
obtainable, which is one of the merits of the proposed 
scheme. This compares favorably with the sine modulated 
scheme. 
 
Fig. 8.  In an 8 Phase Shift Keying sine modulation scheme, the path 2 
        signal belongs to no.4 and hence is at 135o to the horizontal. 
 
     The signal on the direct path is a no.1 signal, which is 
horizontal and is the true signal. Since the combination of 
even a 50% attenuated path 2 signals (note the inclined 
phase  is  half in  length)  would shift  the net  phase by 
45o  as  shown by  the  parallelogram diagonal,  the 
received symbol suffers an error. The comparison features 
of the proposed wavelet based scheme with sine based 
modulation scheme for multicarriers are given below in 
Table II.

is 
no 
merging of the 
subcarrier 
frequency 
spectra as seen 
from Figure 6a. 
Thus, 
subcarrier 
signals 
are 
separable 
without 
any 
mixing. 
Hence, 
the 
performance is 
likely 
to 
be 
better. 
 
Here, 
the 
addition of a 
reduced 
amplitude 
signal 
with 
delay from a 
reflected 
path 
will not affect 
the calculation 
involved 
in 
deciding 
the 
symbol.  
We 
have 
multiple criteria 
for 
decoding 
and hence the 
decoding 
is 
more 
definite 
and 
with 
plausible errors, 
confidence 
levels can be 
obtained 
by 
combining the 
results of the 
multiple 
decoding 
criteria. 
 
The 
power 
level of the 
signal 
waveform 
from 
a 
wavelet used 
for encoding 
is less than 
that 
of 
a 
continuous 
sine 
wave.  
Thus, 
we 
have 
less 
modulating 
power in the 
scheme. 
  
      The method of combining the multiple subcarriers is 
through a look up table data, after encoding the symbols 
as wavelets for these multiple symbols.

    The waveforms of the time signals are pre-stored and 
hence just addition of the waveforms will yield the 
composite waveform in time. This is shown in Figure 9,

     At the receiving end, the total demodulated time signal 
is transformed in Fourier space and the different symbol 
subcarriers are separated in this space. Each of them is 
inverse transformed to get back the wavelet waveform.  
By comparing the wavelet received with the encoding 
wavelets (Fig. 10), the symbol values are separately 
found.  
 
 
VI. TEST IMPLEMENTATION 
 
      From the Matlab program, which generates the 
waveform of the time signal, we considered the 
transmission of the analog data through a RF signal 
generator with amplitude modulation facility. The signal 
is generated from the sound card of the computer using 
WINSOUND command on the Matlab. The sampling 
frequency is low, but is enough for testing; the sampling 
frequency value is 44.1 KHz.Therefore, we could send 
only 4 subcarriers fs = 44100 and sound sc (signal, fs) are 
the commands. 
    The signal from the sound card audio jack is connected 
to the modulator of the RF generator. The RF frequency is 
set to a radio frequency in the near short wave. 
       The receiver is tuned to this frequency, which is a 
communications receiver. The received data is again fed 
through the line input of the sound card of the PC. The PC 
reads the sound card audio using the command Analog 
input (AI) and other related win-sound commands. The 
audio signals are stored in user specified files. These 
signals are processed and the recognition of the wavelet is 
made, thus the data is created. 
 
      Digital data for wireless communication have to be 
converted to analog signals for modulation over a RF 
frequency for transmission.  The method of encoding data 
bits has all along been using merely the phase shift and 
amplitude of a baseband (low frequency) sine wave.  
Alternative to the sine wave no other waveform has so far 
been tried out. 
    
      In our paper, we present the use of wavelets for 
modulation. We choose a particular type of wavelet for 
each data symbol (Table III). With 16 wavelet signals, we 
can encode four bits of data.

VII. COMPARISON WITH SINE MODULATION 
SCHEME 
     
     Thus, wavelet based modulation has been shown to 
provide a better symbol error and also reduces multi path 
distortion compared to the existing sine modulation 
method. 
 
     Secondly, we consider how a security aspect can be 
included in the scheme. For this, let us consider how the 
standard QAM modulation scheme encodes the data bit 
values. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 12. Bit patterns used in the conventional 64QAM Modulation. 
 
 
     For example, the bit patterns versus the phase positions 
are indicated in Figure 12. It is noted that the data bit 
patterns have fixed positions in the constellation with a 
view to make only one bit change between adjacent phase 
points. 
     But, with our wavelet based functions, we have no 
such restriction. The wavelets assigned to the bit patterns 
can be the user’s choice at any time and thus, by varying 
the pattern versus wavelet function table from time to 
time, an additional level of security is obtained [11]. 
 
VIII.   OTHER ATTEMPTS BEARING THE NAME 
WAVELETS 
      From Figure 5, it is noted that the signal in time 
course is evaluated by an IFFT at transmitter; the FFT is 
done at receiver.  Looking at the transform pair (FFT-
IFFT), some authors have thought of replacing this by 
other known transforms. Immediately it suggests the 
ubiquitous wavelet transform. The ordinary wavelet 
transform however reduces the number of points and so 
the wavelet packet transform comes to mind. This 
principle is like the analogy of traveler carrying cash from 
country to another. If he goes to Europe, he can carry 
Euros, pounds, dollars or even some material of value. 
But, other than the Euro, all the rest suffer losses in 
transfer. Thus, in the WPT imagination, the difference 
coefficients are always small in value compared to the 
approximation coefficients and the small values get easily 
masked by even a limited amount of noise.  The 
reconstitution using the approximation and differences 
will yield considerably large errors. The authors 
propounding such methods could only treat their concept 
at theoretical and partial simulation level and not even a 
baseband actual transmit receiver session could be 
reported by them. In the proposed method, the multi 
carrier scheme uses merely the Fourier space and the time 
signals are normal. Only in the symbol level, we use the 
waveforms of the scaling functions of the DB wavelets.  
The scenario of our scheme is useful at single carrier for 
cellular 
communication 
and 
with 
multi 
carrier 
communication for short range wireless in-house and 
wired LAN. 
     Most literature cites the use of Daubechie wavelets for 
reasons already mentioned. The other wavelets may not 
provide for our use as much as sixteen different patterns 
for encoding. Hence, the proposed work rests mainly on 
the DB wavelet scaling function waveform modulation. 
So, comparing with other possible wavelets was felt 
unnecessary. 
 
      In the paper by Matthieu Gautier, Marylin Arndt and 
Joch Lienard [12], the signal is viewed as a sum of 
modulated wavelet packets.  They suggest using the IWPT 
and WPT pair at transmitter and receptor. The concept is 
dealt with mathematically and so is their simulation.  But, 
the details of an implementable scheme are left out in so 
far as actual waveforms for encoding a message is 
concerned and no techniques as to decode the signal at 
reception are given. The work [13] is also a very similar 
attempt.  In another paper [14] it describes the possibility 
of 
the 
same 
WPT 
transforms 
for 
multicarrier 
communication by the similar WPT reception but they do 
not give of any decoding of neither symbols nor do they 
deal with how many bits are encoded in a symbol and in 
what manner the signal based on the DWT is generated.  
This paper is a conceptual account with more details of 
the wavelets filter functions and spectral overlaps of the 
multiple carriers. The bit error curves given are based 
only on their assumed theoretical Gaussian error formulas.

IX. CONCLUSION 
 
        Data communication in a security system, separately 
set up for a private or similar requirement, can exploit the 
advantage of such a different modulation scheme over 
conventional PSK based schemes. The encoding scheme 
method using 4, 8 or 16 wavelets in schemes with 2 bits, 3 
bits, or 4 bits encoding in a symbol can be selected by the 
user and the assignment of bit patterns for the data symbol 
can also be the user’s choice and can be varied from time 
to time to provide a level of security. 
    The usage scenario of the scheme can be anything, such 
as in-house, short range wireless or cellular wireless.  The 
plain wavelet encoding without multiple subcarriers will 
suffice as is employed presently in wireless cellular 
systems.  In short range wireless, as in 802.11 schemes, 
the multiple subcarrier wavelet schemes is applicable 
equally well as the present sine modulated scheme. 
      Additional bonus in the scheme is the better decoding 
possibilities leading to fewer errors, as seen in Figure 5, 
even in the case of basic QPSK verus 4-WSK scheme.
