Abstract—Super-resolution (SR) is a technology to create high-
definition images. According to television (TV) manufacturer's 
advertisements, TVs sold recently in Japan have SR functions. 
In Japan, when such TVs are sold, SR is aggressively advertised 
on a large scale; however, in countries other than Japan, SR is 
not mentioned in similar TV manufacturer's advertisements. In 
previous research, real-time processing to generate SR images 
has been found to be difficult. It is necessary to verify whether 
SR advertised by TV manufacturers exhibits its original 
performance in a TV that requires a real-time processing. 
However, an objective assessment of SR on TVs cannot be 
conducted because images processed in TVs cannot be extracted. 
Therefore, in our previous work, a subjective assessment of 
Learning-Based Super-Resolution (LBSR) was conducted, and 
it was shown that the subjective assessment is effective in 
performance verification of SR on a TV. Moreover, we 
conducted a subjective assessment of LBSR and Non-Linear 
Signal Processing (NLSP) using a 4K TV to evaluate the image 
quality of each SR image produced via up-conversion from HD 
video to 4K. In this study, the image quality of each SR when 
improving resolution of 4K video is evaluated by the subjective 
assessment. Furthermore, the performance results of both 
LBSR and NLSP for resolution improvement on a 4K TV are 
reported.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Super-Resolution (SR) is a technology for improving the 
resolution of images and videos. In recent years, research and 
development of SR for 4K television (TV) has been 
increasingly active. Most 4K TVs currently sold have SR 
functions; SR on a 4K TV is used to up-convert low-resolution 
content to 4K. SR on 4K TV is used to up-convert low-
resolution content to 4K. Broadcasting and Blu-ray content 
typically use high-definition (HD) resolution and because 4K 
content has been insufficient until only a few years ago, most 
content for 4K TV must be up-converted from HDTV content. 
However, recently, 4K content is increasing and is being 
streamed over the Internet. Further, test broadcasting for the 
practical use of 4K broadcasting has been actively conducted. 
Therefore, we expect 4K content to be increasingly common 
in the future. 
SR can also improve resolution. When 4K content 
becomes more widespread in the future, SR on 4K TV will be 
needed for resolution improvement. SR is uniquely developed 
by TV manufacturers to include resolution improvement 
functions. Most TV manufacturers focus their development of 
SR on Learning-Based Super-Resolution (LBSR) [1][2][3].  
In Japan, when TVs are sold, SR is aggressively advertised 
on a large scale. However, in countries other than Japan, SR 
is not mentioned in similar TV manufacturer's advertisements 
[4][5][6][7]. It is necessary to verify whether SR advertised by 
TV manufacturers exhibits the original performance in the TV 
that requires real-time processing. 
Performance of SR is generally measured using Peak 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The authors conducted an 
objective assessment using PSNR about performance of 
LBSR [8]. In [8], real-time processing of SR has been found 
to be difficult. However, the performance of SR developed by 
the TV manufacturers is not published in advertisements. 
Additionally, the objective assessment of SR on a TV cannot 
be conducted because images processed in the TV cannot be 
extracted. Therefore, the authors conducted a subjective 
assessment to measure performance of SR on a TV [9]. In [9], 
performance of LBSR and Non-Linear Signal Processing 
(NLSP) [10] were evaluated when HD video was up-
converted to 4K. It is possible to compare performance of each 
SR by analyzing statistically subjective assessment data.  
Accordingly, the subjective assessment is effective in 
performance verification of SR on a TV. In related research, 
subjective assessments of SR image Reconstruction (SRR) 
and NLSP have been completed using methods that up-
convert (i.e., HD to 4K) and resolution improvement (i.e., 4K 
to 4K) [11][12]. Further, a subjective assessment of LBSR in 
up-converting HD to 4K was completed and compared to 
NLSP; 
however, 
LBSR 
performance 
for 
resolution 
improvement is yet to be evaluated. 
Therefore, in this study, we focus on a subjective 
assessment of resolution improvement. The subjective 
assessment comprises an experiment for collecting data 
subjectively assessed by study subjects. Assessment targets of 
our experiment comprise the following three methods: a 4K 
original signal; NLSP; and LBSR. The collected assessment 
data is statistically analyzed and LBSR performance on a 4K 
TV is quantitatively shown. Significance tests using Analysis 
of Variance (ANOVA) and a yardstick graph are then 
performed; a significant difference between each the 
technique is obtained. Finally, we prove that LBSR is inferior

to NLSP and conclude that NLSP is useful as a SR resolution 
improvement technique for 4K TV. 
The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, the 
subjective assessment experiment is explained. In Section III, 
experiment results are analyzed by statistical methods are 
explained. In Section IV, the analyzed results are discussed. 
Finally, Section V presents a conclusion about this study. 
II. 
SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT EXPERIMENT 
In this section, the subjective assessment method and the 
experiment overview are explained. 
A. Subjective assessment method 
In [9][11][12], subjective assessments via paired 
comparisons are conducted. In this study, to quantitatively 
assess LBSR performance for resolution improvement, 
Scheffe’s paired comparison, ANOVA, and the yardstick 
graph are adopted. Each of these methods is described in the 
next section. 
B.  Experimental method 
 Assessment targets in this study are OFF (i.e., the original 
4K signal), NLSP, and LBSR. The subjective assessment 
method is Scheffe’s paired comparison in which assessment 
pairs are created and compared to one another when three or 
more assessment targets are present. A relative comparison in 
this experiment is a method to assess the other target using a 
five-step scale (i.e., -2 to 2) when one side of the targets is a 
criterion (i.e., 0 points). The assessment scale is shown in 
Table 1, with the five steps defined as Excellent, Good, Fair, 
Poor, and Bad. As an example, when evaluating NLSP as 
compared to LBSR, an assessment score of 2 is assigned if 
NLSP has a higher definition than LBSR, 0 if NLSP is the 
same as LBSR, and -2 if NLSP has a lower definition than 
LBSR. Here, high definition is a state in which fine 
components of a given video are more clearly displayed. 
 Assessment data obtained via the subjective assessment 
are then applied to a significance test using ANOVA. Further, 
experimental results having significant differences are ranked 
via the yardstick graph. 
In the subjective assessment of the video, there is a 
possibility that the assessment score is changed because of the 
evaluation order. Therefore, it is conducted our experiments 
using various combinations to increase the reliability of the 
assessment data. More specifically, one subject assesses the 
following six patterns: NLSP and LBSR when the criterion is 
OFF; OFF and LBSR when the criterion is NLSP; and OFF 
and NLSP when the criterion is LBSR. Because the subjects 
are not experts, an oral description regarding the resolution of 
the video is provided before each experiment, and the subjects 
understand the differences in resolution via a demonstration. 
Moreover, in this experiment, because the subjects provide 
their assessments by replaced the criterion, they often get 
confused. Therefore, the subjects are instructed to assess only 
after correctly understanding the given criterion target. 
Further, the subjects are instructed to ignore the differences in 
color temperature, color tone, and noise during the 
reproduction.

C. Experimental equipment 
In this section, our experimental equipment is described. 
Figure 1 shows a block diagram summarizing our 
experimental equipment. In the figure, the HDTV player is 
able to reproduce video in an uncompressed form, unlike a 
conventional DVD player. Although experimental videos 
were recorded in MPEG-4 format, such videos were never 
compressed during reproduction while using this player. 
Details of the experimental videos are described later. 
Figure 2 shows the NLSP hardware; here, NLSP and OFF 
are able to switch a single TV ON and OFF via this hardware. 
An indicator displaying ON-OFF is present, enabling us to 
understand whether the subjects have watched either NLSP 
results or the 4K original signal. Here, ON indicates NLSP, 
whereas OFF indicates the 4K original signal. 
As shown in Figure 3, two 4K TVs are used in this 
experiment. Here, the manufacturers of the two 4K TV sets 
are the same, but because the model numbers differ, each 4K 
TV's color temperature and color tone differs slightly. The 
liquid crystal panel does not exist exactly the same thing, even 
if the model number or the product lot are the same. Therefore, 
using different model numbers is not problem. 
D. Experimental videos 
 The experimental videos were shot using a consumer 4K 
video camera with fine components to easily confirm 
differences in resolution but also with coding deterioration of 
MPEG-4. Here, flickers or deformations of high-frequency 
components are caused by the coding degradation. In this 
experiment, videos that included these degradations are 
assessed. Note that there were no large movements such as 
panning or tilting in any of the experimental videos. 
Reproduction time was 10-15 seconds and each video is 
looped. The input resolution was 4K resolution (i.e., 3840 × 
2160) and was improved to 4K resolution by each of the 
resolution enhancement processes. Figure 4 summarizes the 
videos used in our experiments. Regions indicated by white 
circles in the figure include a fine pattern of bricks in Scene 1, 
passengers and details of window frames in Scene 2, the 
appearance and character of a ship in Scene 3, the characters 
on a bus in Scene 4, fineness of petals in Scene 5, and fineness 
of the framework in Scene 6. All such scenes help the subjects 
to easily confirm the differences in resolution. The subjects 
performed their assessments while primarily watching these 
regions. 
E. Experimental subjects 
Experimental subjects are 30 non-experts, both men and 
women of 20s with no problems in visual acuity, color vision, 
and field of view. 
F. Experimental environment 
As shown in Figure 5, to reproduce the environment in 
which a consumer selects a TV in a shop, the viewing 
environment is bright. Although the viewing distance was not 
fixed, the subjects always assessed the TVs by standing in 
front of them.

III. 
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 
In this study, the assessment data obtained in the 
subjective 
assessment 
are 
analyzed 
and 
statistically 
quantified. Below, the results of our analysis is presented. 
A. Cross table 
A cross table is used to organize the assessment data. The 
cross tables shown in Table 2 provide summed values of the 
assessment data. In Table 2, typical results are shown and 
other results are similar to these results. Below, the use of a 
cross table is explained using Scene 1 of Table 2. In the table, 
OFF, NLSP, and LBSR in the first column show the criterion 
methods, whereas OFF, NLSP, and LBSR in the first row 
show the assessment targets. Each value is the sum of the 
assessment scores of each subject. For example, the score of 
56 in row two, column three is the sum of the assessment 
scores for NLSP when the criterion is OFF. Conversely, the 
score of -54 in row three, column two is the sum of the 
assessment scores of OFF when the criterion is NLSP. In 
general, Xi is the sum of the assessment scores in each row 
and Xj is the sum of the assessment scores in each column. 
Further, X… is the sum of Xi and Xj. As an example, -150, 
162, and -12 scores in the sixth row (i.e., Xj - Xi) are 
calculated from the difference of each Xj and Xi; these values 
are used for ANOVA and the yardstick graph. 
B. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
Table 3 shows our typical results of ANOVA. Using 
Scene 1 of Table 3, the ANOVA table is explained. In this 
study, the factors analyzed by ANOVA are the main effect, 
main effect × individual, combination, order effect, and order 
effect × individual; these are shown in rows two through six 
of the ANOVA table. The factor shown represents the cause 
that affected each assessment score. The seventh row is a 
residual, and the eighth row is a total. The second column is 
the sum of squares (S), the third column is the degree of 
freedom (DoF), and the fourth column is variance (V). The 
main effect is calculated as follows: 
𝑆 =
1
2𝑛𝑁 ∑(𝑋𝑗 − 𝑋𝑖)2                          (1) 
𝐷𝑜𝐹 = 𝑛 − 1                                                    (2) 
𝑉 = 𝑆/𝐷𝑜𝐹                                                 (3) 
In (1) and (2), n is the number of assessment targets and N is 
the number of subjects. In our experiments, n = 3 and N = 30 
are set. Further, the values shown in Table 2 as Xj - Xi values 
are used. In the fifth column, F represents the variance ratio, 
which is the quotient obtained by dividing the variance of each 
factor by the residual. As an example, F (506.41) of the main 
effect in Scene 1 of Table 2 was calculated by dividing 
variance (135.80) by residual (0.27); however, an error occurs 
if F is calculated using this value, because the values in Table 
3 are rounded off. In the sixth column, F1% represents the 
variance ratio (i.e., boundary value) of each factor with a 
significance level of 1% calculated using the FINV function 
of Excel. For the significance test of ANOVA, we used the F 
value of the main effect, noting a significant difference at F > 
F1%. As an example, in Scene 1 of Table 3, F was 506.41 and 
F1% was 4.85. Here, because F is larger than F1%, a 
significant difference exists between the assessment targets 
with a significance level of 1%. Similar to Scene 1, in Scenes 
2 through 6, because F is larger than F1%, the presence of a 
significant difference has successfully been shown.

C. Yardstick 
Given that a significant difference is proved in the main 
effect via ANOVA, detailed significance tests are conducted 
between each assessment target via the yardstick graph. 
Accordingly, existence of significant difference is proved 
visually. 
Here, a scale value is calculated to create the yardstick 
graph. The scale value in this study quantifies the performance 
of the resolution enhancement processing of the assessment 
target, wherein the height of this value represents the height 
of performance. The scale value is calculated as follows: 
α =
1
2nN (𝑋𝑗 − 𝑋𝑖)                                 (4) 
Here, n, N, and Xj - Xi are the same as above. Table 4 shows 
the scale values for each experimental video. 
A graph using this scale as its horizontal axis is a yardstick 
graph. Figure 6 shows yardstick graphs for each experimental 
video. In the figure, a rhombus indicates OFF, a triangle 
indicates LBSR, and a square indicates NLSP. Values 
between the assessment targets represent the distances of the 
scale value. According to Figure 6, for all experimental videos, 
scale value ranking was OFF, LBSR, and NLSP in ascending 
order. Regarding the distance between the assessment targets, 
differences between NLSP and the other two methods were 
large, which indicated a particularly good performance of 
NLSP in resolution enhancement processing. Similarly, it can 
be confirmed that LBSR was better than OFF. 
From the yardstick graph, performance differences are 
quantitatively showed. To confirm the presence of significant 
differences in these performance differences, a significance 
test is conducted using assessment standard value Ya, as 
calculated below. 
𝑌𝛼 = 𝑞√ 𝑉𝜀
2𝑛𝑁                                        (5) 
Here, q is the q value of the studentized range, Vε is the 
variance of the residual shown in the ANOVA table, and n and 
N are the same as above. Table 5 shows assessment standard 
values Y1% for all experimental videos with significance 
levels of 1%. 
A significant difference is observed in significance level 
1% when the distance between the assessment targets was 
greater than Y1%. In Scene 1 of Figure 6, the distance 
between NLSP and LBSR (0.97) is bigger than Y1% (0.16). 
In addition, the distance between LBSR and OFF (0.77) is also

bigger than Y1% (0.16). Therefore, the significant difference 
is observed in significance level 1%. The two asterisks in each 
yardstick graph of Figure 6 represent the existence of a 
significant difference with a significance level of 1%. As a 
result of the significance tests for all experimental videos, a 
significant difference is found with a significance level of 1% 
between NLSP and LBSR, as well as LBSR and OFF. This 
result shows that resolution enhancement processing of NLSP 
and LBSR is statistically effective. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
Based on the results obtained from our experiments and 
analysis, it is discussed about the significance of each 
resolution enhancement method. 
LBSR has significant differences in the significance level 
of 1% as compared with that of the 4K original signal, thus 
showing the resolution enhancement processing of LBSR to 
be statistically effective. Further, according to our analysis 
results of the yardstick graphs, the performance of NLSP is 
better than LBSR. More specifically, we statistically and 
quantitatively showed that NLSP is better than LBSR. 
In a recent study, using deep convolutional neural 
networks, more advanced LBSR techniques have been 
proposed [13] on the premise of applying such techniques to 
still images. As long as the approach is learning based, 
processes will require longer processing times, such as for the 
analysis of an input image, a database search, and block 
matching. Therefore, LBSR does not meet the real-time 
requirements for TV. In LBSR on a TV, manufacturers expect 
that a dedicated large-scale integrated processor could solve 
the problem of real-time processing; however, there is a limit 
to what can be solved via hardware. To realize effective real-
time processing, it can be considered that there is a possibility 
that some process has been simplified. On the other hand, 
NLSP that we have proposed is able to create components are 
exceeded the Nyquist frequency in real-time. It has been 
proved in [10]. In addition, NLSP is able to process in real-
time even if it is mounted on a conventional simple device 
because it is very simple signal processing. Therefore, it can 
be said that a hardware cost is low. 
In addition, from the opinions provided by our test 
subjects, problems in NLSP and LBSR need to be solved. In 
the videos processed by LBSR, image artifacts are present. 
Such artifacts are image disturbances such as block noise and 
aliasing. When conducting subjective assessments, it was 
necessary to select areas that did not have many artifacts as 
one’s focal point. Therefore, in LBSR, we require processing 
to reduce aliasing and other such artifacts. In the experimental 
video of the cherry blossoms with many high-frequency 
components processed by NLSP, we heard opinions noting 
that a subject’s eyes were tired because of excessive emphasis 
on the image. Therefore, we conclude it necessary to find 
optimum processing parameters for each video. 
In the future, after resolving the aforementioned problems, 
we plan to conduct further subjective assessments for various 
types of images. We also plan to increase the accuracy of our 
evaluation experiment. In particular, we conclude that videos 
with a face and text are preferred.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, we conducted a subjective assessment of 
NLSP and LBSR on 4K TV. Analyzing the assessment results 
obtained in our experiments, we quantitatively showed the 
performance of NLSP and LBSR incorporated into a 4K TV. 
It was found that NLSP was better than LBSR. Further, it was 
found that LBSR was statistically more effective as compared 
with the original 4K signals. Therefore, we conclude that SR 
for resolution improvement on 4K TVs is indeed effective. In 
the future, we plan to implement more accurate assessment 
experiments by increasing the number and variety of 
assessment videos.
